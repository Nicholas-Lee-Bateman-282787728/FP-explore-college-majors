The standard fare is on display - a mysterious disease, for which there is no cure and little understanding, has ravaged humanity, leaving society completely devastated as governments crumble and social structures between people break down overnight. With social structures completely dissolved, it's obviously time for the inevitable raping, pillaging, suiciding, and so forth in order to make some sort of statement about the state of the human condition in the face of an apocalypse... which might be kind of innovative, except that it's already been done several times over, particularly withBlindness.Fundamentally, ""Carriers"" seems to think that it's terribly edgy and clever, but there's nothing here that you haven't seen a hundred times before. Frequently mentioned ""rules"" for survival and goofball destruction of property for the fun of it, straight out ofZombieland. A more organized and serious group that initially seems to have its act together, but is all too willing to crack from the strain and start raping and pillaging, fresh from28 Days Later. And you have the ""survivors"" slowly becoming infected and hiding the fact from the rest of the group, as in every other zombie/contagious illness movie ever made, ever.Derivative isn't bad - taking elements that have worked before and sticking them together in new and interesting ways is a tried-and-true, if unoriginal, way to make your movie. But ""Carriers"" seems to think sp highly of itself, with far too many ""you can't handle the truth"" speeches to drive how that, gosh, the apocalypse *sucks*, and the smug writing and contrived situations meant to show the downfall of the survivors' humanity just comes across as tired, forced, and poorly done compared to better offerings out there.~ Ana Mardoll",2,"Adds nothing to the zombie genre, nor to cinema as a whole",1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,1865,"['Carriers', '/', 'B002TZS5GU', 'Carriers', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'highly', 'do', 'standard', 'fare', 'display', 'mysterious', 'disease', 'cure', 'little', 'understanding', 'ravaged', 'humanity', 'leaving', 'society', 'completely', 'devastated', 'governments', 'crumble', 'social', 'structures', 'people', 'break', 'down', 'overnight', 'social', 'structures', 'completely', 'dissolved', 'obviously', 'time', 'inevitable', 'raping', 'pillaging', 'suiciding', 'so', 'forth', 'order', 'make', 'sort', 'statement', 'state', 'human', 'condition', 'face', 'apocalypse', 'might', 'be', 'kind', 'innovative', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'several', 'times', 'particularly', 'withBlindness.Fundamentally', 'Carriers', 'think', 'terribly', 'edgy', 'clever', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'Frequently', 'mentioned', 'rules', 'survival', 'goofball', 'destruction', 'property', 'fun', 'straight', 'out', 'ofZombieland', 'more', 'organized', 'serious', 'group', 'initially', 'have', 'act', 'together', 'too', 'willing', 'crack', 'strain', 'start', 'raping', 'pillaging', 'fresh', 'from28', 'Days', 'Later', 'have', 'survivors', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'infected', 'hiding', 'fact', 'rest', 'group', 'other', 'zombie/contagious', 'illness', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'ever.Derivative', ""n't"", 'bad', 'taking', 'elements', 'have', 'worked', 'sticking', 'together', 'new', 'interesting', 'ways', 'tried-and-true', 'unoriginal', 'way', 'make', 'movie', 'Carriers', 'think', 'sp', 'highly', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'truth', 'speeches', 'drive', 'how', 'gosh', 'apocalypse', '*sucks*', 'smug', 'writing', 'contrived', 'situations', 'meant', 'show', 'downfall', 'survivors', 'humanity', 'just', 'across', 'tired', 'forced', 'poorly', 'done', 'compared', 'better', 'offerings', 'out', 'there.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

It seemed right up my alley, but I was surprised that I had never heard of it before, especially since it stars the new Captain James Tiberius Kirk. My expectations were very low. Seemed like it was going to be a cheap little independent film with no substance. But I was wrong: it's a cheap little independent film that's actually pretty smart.The premise is a tad cliche. It takes places after a devastating and extremely-contagious virus has decimated the planet. We never get an explanation for the outbreak or how our main characters have survived up until now--true to post-apocalyptic form. I would agree that sometimes it's a pain when a filmmaker tries to explain everything when the audience can usually fill in the blanks themselves, but still, we're getting to the point were it's expected.The story itself follows four young adults: two brothers and their respective girlfriends. They're on their way to a beach that the brothers used to frequent in their younger days, and doing their best to scavenge for food and gas enroute. Semi-weak premise, semi-weak story, and semi-weak characters. Luckily, the writing and directing are good enough to see this movie through all 85 minutes of its running time.For the most part, it's all about the little encounters along the way to this beach of theirs. The people that they meet and the situations that they get themselves into during their most desperate times play out very well. It starts out kind of slow, but it finds its feet fast enough. These encounters are very tense and well shot. And they very expertly provide us post-apocalypse aficionados with what we always look for in a movie like this: Situations that force us as viewers to question how we would handle such a thing. Would we really resort to such strict utilitarianism, or would we do ""the right thing?"" They're interesting to think about, to me, at least.So, for a rental, I certainly think I got my money's worth. The ending was rushed and ill-conceived, which was extremely unfortunate, since it deterred me from thinking of purchasing it. This is a shame, since halfway through, it was almost looking like America's answer to 28 DAYS LATER. Better characterization, a better ending, and a longer running time would have made this a winner. The directors are definitely talented, and I hope they consider making a sequel of some kind.Maybe four stars is a little high, but this movie was great for what it was. It was short, had some great moments, and it's one of the better movies in the genre to have been released lately.

My review is concerned with the film's entertainment value only.'Carriers' takes a limited, although interesting, one-track approach to the apocalypse genre, which is to ask the question, 'Are any relationships strong enough to trump survival?'.  In a world where a plague is in the process of wiping out the last remaining survivors, two brothers, along with their girlfriends, are attempting to reach the vacation spot they remember from childhood, while at the same time avoiding plague victims, and, just as dangerous if not more so, other survivors.  Chris Pine, as the older brother and default leader Brian, is forced to make increasingly more difficult moral decisions for the group as the film progresses, and though younger brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci) struggles to maintain his humanity in the process, he is also finally forced to choose between survival and fraternal affection.Production values and the competent young actors make this film stand out over many of the schlocky, B-movie efforts that dominate the post-apocalyptic genre, yet the movie's very slickness helps disguise 'Carriers' essentially superficial presentation.  The themes and questions are interesting in and of themselves - and asking them in this setting is an effective way of highlighting this aspect of human behavior.  Yet once the characters are established, the rest of the film follows in a predictable pattern to its conclusion.  In other words, the film goes no farther than raising the question in the viewer's mind of whether or not there are any ties that truly bind.  The film answers - not if you want to survive.Films of this type don't have to ask and answer complex ethical questions - and simply as entertainment, 'Carriers' is above average for this genre.  Perhaps the best description of its overall value is that I remember that I was attentive and interested during the film, though now that a few days have gone by, many of the its images are starting to fade.  Satisfactory as a rental, especially for fans of the genre, but not enough depth - nor mayhem for those most interested in that aspects of these types of films - for multiple viewings.",3,"3 1/2 Stars - Competent, Middling entry in the genre.",1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,2301,"['Disclaimer', 'viewed', 'film', 'streaming', 'rental', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'disc', 'extras', 'review', 'concerned', 'film', 'entertainment', 'value', 'only', ""'Carriers"", 'limited', 'interesting', 'one-track', 'approach', 'apocalypse', 'genre', 'ask', 'question', 'relationships', 'strong', 'enough', 'trump', 'survival', 'world', 'where', 'plague', 'process', 'wiping', 'out', 'last', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'two', 'brothers', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'attempting', 'reach', 'vacation', 'spot', 'remember', 'childhood', 'same', 'time', 'avoiding', 'plague', 'victims', 'just', 'dangerous', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'survivors', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'older', 'brother', 'default', 'leader', 'Brian', 'forced', 'make', 'increasingly', 'more', 'difficult', 'moral', 'decisions', 'group', 'film', 'younger', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', 'maintain', 'humanity', 'process', 'also', 'finally', 'forced', 'choose', 'survival', 'fraternal', 'affection.Production', 'values', 'competent', 'young', 'actors', 'make', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'many', 'schlocky', 'B-movie', 'efforts', 'dominate', 'post-apocalyptic', 'genre', 'movie', 'very', 'slickness', 'disguise', ""'Carriers"", 'essentially', 'superficial', 'presentation', 'themes', 'questions', 'are', 'interesting', 'asking', 'setting', 'effective', 'way', 'highlighting', 'aspect', 'human', 'behavior', 'once', 'characters', 'are', 'established', 'rest', 'film', 'predictable', 'pattern', 'conclusion', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'farther', 'raising', 'question', 'viewer', 'mind', 'not', 'are', 'ties', 'truly', 'bind', 'film', 'answers', 'not', 'want', 'survive.Films', 'type', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ask', 'answer', 'complex', 'ethical', 'questions', 'simply', 'entertainment', ""'Carriers"", 'above', 'average', 'genre', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'description', 'overall', 'value', 'remember', 'was', 'attentive', 'interested', 'film', 'though', 'now', 'few', 'days', 'have', 'gone', 'many', 'images', 'are', 'starting', 'fade', 'Satisfactory', 'rental', 'especially', 'fans', 'genre', 'not', 'enough', 'depth', 'mayhem', 'most', 'interested', 'aspects', 'types', 'films', 'multiple', 'viewings']",N/A
1289201,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B002TZS5GU,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","In CARRIERS, a viral infection has destroyed all of mankind, leaving only a few survivors to fend for themselves as they attempt to find a safe haven free from contagion. Fear and paranoia set in as a group of four find out that their precautions have failed and one of them has contracted the deadly disease, putting the others in immediate danger. CARRIERS does an amazing job at conveying a post-apocalyptic wasteland on a very modest budget. The ravished streets and empty buildings give a true sense of devastation on a grand scale. Each of the actors put forth strong performances as they balance the lighter moments in the script with the psychological struggles later on. What makes the film the most difficult to watch are the scenes involving the infected children, where the adults that are conscious of the terminal effects of the disease must make heartbreaking decisions in order to end their suffering. Unlike in 28 DAYS LATER, the infected only pose a risk of contamination rather than creating bloodthirsty monsters, which forces the plot to rely on the darker aspects of humanity to drive the tension and suspense.

There isn't much gore, not a lot of scary monsters chasing people. Rather the monsters are those few people who are left after a virus with a 100% kill rate has raced through the world like wildfire. Among the survivors are 4 young people, whose only goal is to get to the beach, the place where they were happy as children. Along the way, they have to overcome the problems that would arise with a worldwide epidemic--no gas, no electricity, infected people who are not yet dead, and so forth.Where the film shines is in the relationships between the 4 kids, two brothers and their girlfriends. They are all well-drawn, complex characters with complex interactions. Their fear of being infected is matched by their fear that their moral sense has been distorted, that the will to survive has transformed them from good people into craven, immoral ghosts of their former selves. And this is very well done.If you're expecting a loud monster movie with lots of chases and zombies, this isn't it.

It's right up my alley, viruses or zombies or post-apoclyptic nightmare, etc. But it's also really another genre I love, emotional dramas. I didn't know much about it when I bought it but I'm glad I wasn't expecting a zombie horor film, it's a more personal drama about the four main characters.No plague set-up or explanation, we're dropped right into the middle of the aftermath in the beginning of the film. There's a lot of cliched behavior from other post-apoc movies. The reckless driving, the drinking and who gives a s*** attitude towards life, the gas rationing and (my least favorite part), the golf course montage.Would I behave that way? I never can decide. I might be like a kid in a candy store, or paranoid hyper-vigilant beyond my wits. The characters seem to let their guard down too often, another cliche. The diving board scene for instance.But the actors and the characters rise above the cliches, a great performance by Chris Meloni as well. I still had questions throughout about the disease and especially the spreadability of it, but oh well. Re: my title, it does work well as a small screen drama.

Some disease has wiped out most of the human race. The rest are either dying or trying not to become infected. Two brothers are trying to make their way, along with their female companions, back to 'Turtle Beach', the one place of which they have fond memories and a place that might make them feel safe.The road is bumpy. Every person whose path they cross might be infected or might be hostile. Gas is in real short supply as is food and water.

You'll probably recognize many of the faces if not the names themselves. The situations are tense but not overly so. The writers/directors do a decent job of keeping things from getting too Hollywood. The production values, music, etc. are all good enough.On the bad side, this needed something else. Something more.

1289211,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B002TZS5GU,General Zombie,"[5, 6]","Though clearly the victim of distribution company turmoil, the impressively despairing ""Carriers"" would've been commercial poison even if properly released. Some reviewers evidently believed this was a zombie movie, and, had it been widely released, the promotion would surely have sold ""Carriers"" as such despite the absence of any zombies. That crucial absence aside, ""Carriers"" is rooted in the tradition, but from a more thematic perspective. Though there's no danger from the living dead, the quartet of travelers in ""Carriers"" live in a world after civilization, where paranoia rules and even the slightest contact with the infected can bring death. Unsurprisingly, this makes ""Carriers"" much less action-oriented than a zombie flick and heavier on the existential despair. As much as I like zombie movies, I've always felt the genre moved too far from the grim atmosphere of ""Night of the Living Dead."" and ""Carriers"" gives the viewer more than enough of that even as it jettisons the subgenre's core.Co-directors/writers Alex and David Pastor wisely avoid any background and immediately throw the viewer into a near-future world of despair. We open on the road in America's southwest following a pair of brothers. We have the older, harsher Brian (Chris Pine) and more sympathetic and sensitive Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci). With them are two females, Brian's girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo) and the rather faceless Kate (Emily Van Camp), who is evidently a recent arrival to the group. A nameless plague has wiped out society, and the group travels in a moving quarantine, sterile masks on, tubs of bleach available to wash away the pestilence. Brian has devised a series of rules to survive the apocalypse, with one central rule: ""The infected are already dead."" And since it's nearly impossible to say definitively that someone is not infected, this proves to be a substantial strain on interaction with those outside the group. Merely surviving is something of a chore, but the four also have a goal: to return to an abandoned, coastal hotel the brothers frequented as children and wait out the end of the world.The film's narrative is fairly thin and episodic, and ""Carriers"" is primarily a mood piece. As such the film is consistently low-key, with sharp but never flashy cinematography and a generally moody, understated score. Pics like ""28 Days Later"" (the most obvious recent influence) prefer to display the vast emptiness of the dead cities, but ""Carriers"" remains mostly in the open, emphasizing with endless, lifeless expanse ahead and behind. The wasted cities mean nothing to them because they have fled humanity, have escaped from civilization altogether. Nevertheless, a few other refugees remain, and here is where the conflict begins. As is often the case in such films, the conflicts are often moral: early on the quartet meet Frank (Christoper Meloni) and his obviously infected daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka). First they leave the pair alone in the middle of the road but, after their car fails them (with a little help from the enraged Frank), the quartet return, taking Frank's SUV and stuffing him and the sick little girl in back, sequestered behind a thick plastic sheet, promising to take her to receive an experimental treatment. This is actually the most accommodating encounter depicted in the film, and the struggle for gasoline and safety often turns suddenly violent.As is common to zombie and post apocalyptic films, the question as to whether human decency can survive under such circumstances is key to the film. The answer is, as it almost always is in such films, ""no,"" but ""Carriers"" treats this question in a bleaker and more intelligent way than most. While too many films glibly suggest that the end of law turns men into fascists, ""Carriers"" acknowledges a darker truth: under the worst circumstances, the choice between callousness and decency is the choice between life and death. Callousness, rather than hatred or violence, is the defining characteristic of the survivor: they are inclined not so much to brutalize the others, but instead to leave them behind, to simply drive away while the other stands alone on the empty highway with nothing but desert for miles in every direction. (W/o giving too much away, one particular abandonment scene has got to be one of the worst gut-punch scenes I've come across in recent memory.)In spite of the emphasis on mood, ""Carriers"" still contains some fine set pieces. There's one fantastically eerie scene in an abandoned hospital and a somewhat clich&eacute;d but still effective confrontation between the travelers and a trio of HazMat suit bedecked survivalists. Nevertheless, the climax moves for a more low-key, dialogue-oriented approach, and while the conclusion is perhaps a bit on the nose precise, it has a real emotional impact.In spite of my praise for the film, I can hear the critics' responses: ""Too slow, story too thin, too derivative, thin characters etc."" These criticisms aren't w/o merit. Though it is a reconfiguration of old tropes, precious little is truly new, not that much happens and the characters other than the brothers can be a bit thin. (The solid performances across the board, particularly from Perabo and Meloni, add humanity to sometimes underwritten characters.) More important than the limitations, however, is the totality of the film. ""Carriers"" is a tapestry of despair, with virtually every element builds towards this goal, all w/o much violence, any real gore or much melodrama. This is perhaps not what most viewers want, but it makes for an affecting experience.Grade: A-",5,A Celebration for the Death of Man,1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,5615,"['clearly', 'victim',

This was a nice try, but no cookie.The acting was decent, I'll say that. It at least had a few recognizable faces and they gave a good performance. The script was ok, and the plot was a bit sluggish. The production values were nothing to complain about nor the special effects. The story line as a whole just missed the mark and needed more substance, less predictability. It undoubtedly referenced several other movies, leaving hard core genre fans with nothing new to experience. Those that haven't seen as many zombie/Apocalypse virus movies, might find it more interesting.

The cast of young actors are talented and deserved a better script but as is so often the case with such ""end of the world"" scenarios, the movie industry demands a certain formulaic plot line.

Basic premise is that four travelers are attempting to hit a possibly safe/tucked away location from the lead character's childhood - all the while trying to steer clear of infected people. Naturally, this proves hard to do.One of the things you notice about this film is that the cast is very strong and very believeable. These are just regular people who are just trying to survive as society completely disintegrates and the rules change.  The director made smart choices in my opinion with no few special effects - and thus making the film simply more realistic, barren, and terrifying.  The film raises the question of what would you do if faced with the same situation? And it does make you think.Choices and rules are difficult and they have to be. Chris Pine is very strong in the lead role and it's a great change from his role as Jim Kirk.

A story about two siblings traveling across a devastated and depopulated United States to visit a theme park in California that reminds them of childhood. The movies even share the same fetish for a nerdy character that has come up with all the rules to keep them alive.While Zombieland was filmed in early 2009 and released later that year on 3000 plus screens; Carriers was filmed in 2006 and released on a hundred screens in 2009 to virtually no fanfare. Only actor's Chris Pine's recent starring role in the Star Trek movie caused it to be released theatrically at all.The other main difference is while Zombieland on the surface may appear to be a horror-comedy along the lines of Shaun of the Dead it really is more of a straightforward comedy with gore and zombies. Carriers also certainly appears to be a horror film on the surface but it really isn't. This is large D drama that starts off serious and gets quite disheartening before the end credits role.Carriers is a medical drama writ large mixed with a post-apocalyptic future. There are no zombies or even 28 Days Later pseudo zombies. This is not an exploitation film as there is no nudity nor violence; there is also very little action. There is simply a small handful of sick people, a small handful of not yet sick people and a copious amount of dead people. It is more a sequel to a bird flu movie than a Dawn of the Dead film.Carriers biggest problem is it simply is hard to root for any of the characters. Chris Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci play the siblings heading to their childhood vacation spot (of which we see strange seventies era super 8 nostalgia footage though judging by the age of the characters their childhood was in 1995). Pucci is the rules nerd while Pine is a super jerk (or as TV Tropes wisely points out a Psycho Party Member).Then you have the ladies. Emily VanCamp plays what would seem to Pucci's girlfriend but she is frigid, preppy, and possibly a lesbian. At the very least the ""I wouldn't kiss you if you were the last man on earth"" rule seems to apply here. Piper Perabo as Pine's girlfriend is borderline likable but she is whiny and a liar and I really am grading on a curve here.Only Christopher Meloni as a father with an already sick daughter seems to pull on the heart strings; but he isn't a member of the core group and they separate ways halfway through.The acting is good across the board with Meloni and VanCamp the standouts. The film also seems much grounded in its reality and logic is safely tucked into bed every night. I simply wish the movie was about a different group of survivors.",3,Wayward Son,1270252800,"04 3, 2010",2010,2700,"['Carriers', '6', '10', 'What', 'Carriers', 'how', 'exact', 'same', 'plot', 'Zombieland', 'A', 'story', 'two', 'siblings', 'traveling', 'devastated', 'depopulated', 'United', 'States', 'visit', 'theme', 'park', 'California', 'childhood', 'movies', 'even', 'share', 'same', 'fetish', 'nerdy', 'character', 'come', 'up', 'rules', 'keep', 'alive.While', 'Zombieland', 'was', 'filmed', 'early', '2009', 'released', 'later', 'year', '3000', 'screens', 'Carriers', 'was', 'filmed', '2006', 'released', 'hundred', 'screens', '2009', 'virtually', 'fanfare', 'Only', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'recent', 'starring', 'role', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'caused', 'be', 'released', 'theatrically', 'all.The', 'other', 'main', 'difference', 'Zombieland', 'surface', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'horror-comedy', 'lines', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'really', 'more', 'straightforward', 'comedy', 'gore', 'zombies', 'Carriers', 'also', 'certainly', 'be', 'horror', 'film', 'surface', 'really', ""n't"", 'large', 'D', 'drama', 'serious', 'quite', 'disheartening', 'end', 'role.Carriers', 'medical', 'drama', 'writ', 'large', 'mixed', 'post-apocalyptic', 'future', 'are', 'zombies', 'even', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'pseudo', 'zombies', 'not', 'exploitation', 'film', 'nudity', 'violence', 'also', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'simply', 'small', 'handful', 'sick', 'people', 'small', 'handful', 'not', 'yet', 'sick', 'people', 'copious', 'amount', 'dead', 'people', 'more', 'sequel', 'bird', 'flu', 'movie', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'film.Carriers', 'biggest', 'problem', 'simply', 'hard', 'root', 'characters', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', 'play', 'siblings', 'heading', 'childhood', 'vacation', 'spot', 'see', 'strange', 'seventies', 'era', 'super', '8', 'nostalgia', 'footage', 'judging', 'age', 'characters', 'childhood', 'was', '1995', 'Pucci', 'rules', 'nerd', 'Pine', 'super', 'jerk', 'TV', 'Tropes', 'wisely', 'out', 'Psycho', 'Party', 'Member', '.Then', 'have', 'ladies', 'Emily', 'VanCamp', 'what', 'would', 'seem', 'Pucci', 'girlfriend', 'frigid', 'preppy', 'possibly', 'lesbian', 'very', 'least', 'would', ""n't"", 'kiss', 'were', 'last', 'man', 'earth', 'rule', 'apply', 'here', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Pine', 'girlfriend', 'borderline', 'likable', 'whiny', 'liar', 'really', 'am', 'grading', 'curve', 'here.Only', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'father', 'already', 'sick', 'daughter', 'pull', 'heart', ""n't"", 'member', 'core', 'group', 'separate', 'ways', 'halfway', 'acting', 'good', 'board', 'Meloni', 'VanCamp', 'standouts', 'film', 'also', 'much', 'grounded', 'reality', 'logic', 'safely', 'tucked', 'bed', 'night', 'simply', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'group', 'survivors']",N/A

1289220,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B002TZS5GU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","""Carriers"" is not really a good title for this movie, because even though one look at the DVD cover makes it clear this is not aboutWorld War II flattops, you still do not get a real sense what this 2009 film is about.  Once again most everybody in the world is dead and the focus is not on latter-day Thyphoid Marys but rather a quartet of survivors who are trying to make it from New Mexico to Texas to get to the beach.  In that regard it is similar to ""The Road,"" which I just happened to watch last week, but without the landscape being totally decimated and scavengers having already picked everything clean.  Packed into car are Brian Green (Chris Pine) and his brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), along with Brian's girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo) and a classmate of Danny's, Kate (Emily VanCamp).  Thoughts of being the next Adam and Eve have not popped up yet, and at this point the goal is survive and reach their destination, although it is just the beachhouse were the boys were happy as kids and not a true place of possible salvation.  But when Brian ennunciates the five rules by which he insists they live, everybody who has ever seen ""Gremlins"" or any of the hundreds of other films that takes as its dramatic impeteus the dictum that rules exist to be broken, knows what is going to happen between now and the end of the movie.Written and directed by the Pastor brothers Alex and David, this movie is the series of encounters that the four have with other people.  Danny is the sort who things that human beings should look out for each other, but whereas he was to believe the glass is half full, brother Brian knows that proverbial glass is not just empty but broken beyond possible repair.  But Brian is such a disagreeable person that it is hard to take his pragmatic perspective, even though you know he is right (plus, there is the sense that it is the times that have tried Brian's soul and that he was not always this way).  Then again, kind-hearted Danny is not going to survive if he does not get a serious attitude adjustment.  To further complicate things, each brother is paired up with the wrong woman, because Bobby is the compassionate one and Kate the one who is deadly serious about the rules.  Something has to give between here and the Texas coast.  The most ironic line in the film is also the grimmest, when Bobby tells Brian, ""I think we need to start seeing other people.""  Tell me about it.""Carriers"" belongs in the viral pandemic sub-genre of post-apocalyptic films, which puts it in the tradition of Stephen King's ""The Stand,"" and which also makes it a relatively rare exception these days to the zombie movies from ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ""Zombieland"" currently dominating end-of-the-world films.  With these latter films switching to postmodern zombies that are now quick and dead (e.g., ""28 Days Later),"" it is actually nice to get back to something relatively ""normal"" for the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it.  Ultiamtely, that is the main attraction for me in this film, because I like to be able to rumminate about what the hell would I do in such a situation, and I would rather deal with the problems presented by simple survival and debating the attempt to rekindle the spark of human kindness in others than having to contend with a geometrically progressing horde of speed racing evil dead.

However, it shares the same basic premise as most flicks from the ""infected"" sub-genre of zombie movies.There's an infection. It's deadly. It's not well-explained. People are panicky, stupid, dangerous and potentially deadly (whether from a gunshot or from a cough). Everyone wants to find a safe haven and avoid getting dead. Everyone is in survival mode, squabbling over resources, etc. There is little hope in sight.Like Zombieland and any number of ""infected"" movies, it's about a small group of people (two brothers and their girlfriends [or not]) traveling across the country, trying to find someplace safe to hunker down and ride out the course of the disaster. Along the way they meet a number of people, most of whom end up being at least somewhat adversarial. Over the course of the movie, most of the characters get dead...This movie is largely about the characters, as such things go. So, it's at least partly a drama of interpersonal relationships during a biohazardous crisis, though it's mainly a horror/suspense movie. Not so much scary as mildly unsettling at times, and with some obviously disturbing imagery.That said, it's pretty decent as far as such things go, without actually BEING a zombie movie.

1289229,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B002TZS5GU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[7, 7]","On the surface, Carriers appears to be a very shallow movie.  We have the typical road trip mix of daredevil jock (Chris Pine as Brian Green) and his loose girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo), nebbish nerd and Brian's brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), and pretty-but-distant blonde Kate (Emily VanCamp).  As the film progresses it becomes clear that the Greens stole the car, that they're on a road trip to a distant beach, and that asking ""alive or dead?"" when playing twenty questions is a ""trick question."" And that's the moment when we realize a plague has brought about the end of the world.The brothers abide by three rules: 1) Avoid the infected at all costs because their breath is highly contagious. 2) Disinfect anything an infected person has touched in the last 24 hours.  3) The sick are already dead.This is a movie about stupid people teetering on the brink of insanity. Brian's gung-ho exterior hides a scarred soul that has buried too many bodies.  Danny's cowardly quiet conceals a calculating intellect.  Bobby seeks refuge in the possibility of having children with Brian, while Kate tries every payphone she can find to call her family in the vain hope that the line still works...and that there's anyone left to call.  These are deeply flawed survivors who have only made it so far because they flee at a moment's notice.In our fast-food, GPS-guided, mobile phone culture, our cars are oases in a sea of parkways. We have no idea who lives in the towns we pass through; the people we speak to at a rest stop or a restaurant we may never see again.  In Carriers, to stop moving is death, which is why rule number one is so important - in a world where everyone is infected, avoiding them means driving forever.Early on, the four survivors encounter Frank Holloway (Christopher Meloni) and his infected daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka).  Frank is convinced that if he can just get his daughter to a CDC hospital she will be cured. The four initially flee Frank's vehicle, only to return to it when they ruin their own.  Frank and his daughter are the first of a series of ethical choices the group will have to make about how far they will take the rules. The decision to bend those same rules slowly tears the group apart.When it becomes clear that there is no serum, no cure, and no hope, Frank - and the audience - faces the stark realization that life is not about survival.  It's about dying with dignity. As the doomed doctor at the CDC bivouac (Mark Moses) puts it, ""sometimes choosing life is just choosing a more painful form of death.""  But instead of facing that terrible truth, the survivors hop in the car and run, again...This is probably the most depressing movie I've ever seen.  Children of Men and The Road are uplifting in comparison. Carriers may not have zombies, an antidote, or an uplifting ending, but it does have an uncompromising vision of an apocalypse that is truly personal. When the end comes, the foolish hop in their cars.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 3]","Usually when a distributor dumps a movie into a handful of theaters with little to no screenings, it usually winds up being a dreadful waste.  Not so with Carriers, which winds up being a surprisingly taut, and incredibly bleak, take on the whole pandemic outbreak theme.  Written and directed by the Pastor brothers, Carriers revolves around a group of survivors (Lou Taylor Pucci, Chris Pine, Piper Perabo, and Emily VanCamp) traversing the hazardous land and following a set of rules that is helping keep them alive.  A chance encounter with a stranded motorist (Law & Order: SVU and Oz vet Christopher Meloni) begins to change all that however, as things start to go from bad to worse for everyone involved.

It eschews much in the way of an exploration of the condition that has decimated humanity, simply sketching out the scenario as background to the smaller scale human drama at its heart.  The four leads are all excellent--notably Chris Pine who plays Brian with much of the same bravado that he brought to the young Kirk in what was to be his next role--which is just as well given this is mostly a character piece.  As such it plays out its themes of compassion, euthanasia, responsibility and coming-of-age and explores just what kinds of actions and decisions it might take to survive in a post-apocalyptic society in which all the comforts and niceties of day-to-day life as we know it have gone to hell.

1289238,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002TZS5GU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Carriers (Alex and David Pastor, 2009)NOTE: this review contains spoilers. They are not specific to the plot, but the revelations in the first paragraph may diminish your enjoyment of the film; you may want to watch the movie first. (You do want to watch the movie.)Carriers is the most interesting example of a bait-and-switch movie I've ever seen. When I sat down to watch it, I was all set to start off with an opening paragraph excoriating the filmmakers for giving away one of the film's main spoilers in its very title, not to mention doing the same to the guy at Netflix who wrote the plot synopsis. After all, the film&#8212;supposedly&#8212;turns on the idea that its four principal characters are trying to stay alive during a pandemic, then discover that they are actually patient zero (or, well, patient zero through three), and they're actually giving it to everyone they come into contact with. This is not the case, which makes me wonder why they chose that name in the first place. It also sets the viewer up to expect a certain kind of film. Carriers is not that film. It is, instead,  a drama&#8212;I hesitate to use the term &#8220;moral drama&#8221;, but if the shoe fits&#8212;about various people and how they react to surviving in a post-apocalyptic landscape. It has far more in common with Tim Fehlbaum's moody German thriller Bright than it does with the current spate of zompocalypse movies.Plot: two brothers and the girlfriends&#8212;Danny and Brian (Evil Dead's Lou Taylor Pucci and Star Trek's Chris Pine) and Kate and Bobby (Brothers and Sisters' Emily VanCamp and Coyote Ugly's Piper Perabo)&#8212;are, as we open, speeding through the desert in a stolen Mercedes. Not that anyone notices the car is stolen; they are four of the last survivors in America. A pandemic (I have read online synopses that say it's a strain of bird flu, though I don't remember hearing that in the movie) has devastated the populace; as far as we can tell, the number of human beings left alive in America at the opening of the film can be counted in the dozens. (Towards the end of the movie, as some of the remaining survivors are driving through Texas, we hear a radio broadcast from a woman who reports that she is the last person left alive in Corpus Christi.) Brian has formulated a number of rules for survival that have kept them alive; he also half-believes, since neither he nor his brother have been infected, that the family is &#8220;chosen&#8221;, and that they and the ladies will be ultimately responsible for repopulating America. (The first part of that sentence is explicitly stated in the movie. The second part is not, but looking at it like that puts a whole lot of the first half of the movie into perspective.) As we open, they have been driving for an undetermined, but lengthy, amount of time without having encountered anyone else. That changes when they run across Frank (Law and Order: SVU's Christopher Meloni) and his daughter Jodie (Flowers in the Attic's Kiernan Shipka), who are on their way to a nearby town where, supposedly, a team of doctors have come up with a new serum that is helping. Teaming up with Frank and Jodie would break...most of them. Circumstances, however, force an alliance, and the foursome take a detour from their west coast destination to get Frank and Jodie to the medical complex.It's tough to give a plot synopsis because&#8212;and, like the opening paragraph, this could be construed by some people to be a major spoiler&#8212;Carriers is an episodic film. Our protagonists move through the film, and other characters surround them, but the way the movie is structured emphasizes their aloneness on this roadtrip through a blasted desert landscape; all of their relationships are temporary, and ultimately, the central question posed by the movie is whether these characters are capable of forming permanent relationships, including with each other. That may seem an odd central question in a movie focused on two brothers, but as time goes on, the companionship between Danny and Brian frays. Given the context, there's a real air of menace about fights that would, in most other movies, seem kind of trivial. Here, they work.The best shot in the movie comes about two-thirds of the way through. The band as it stands at that point are running low on gas, and they stop at a gas station. The sign at the roadside says &#8220;MICHAEL DEAD/MEAT IN TOWN.&#8221; Instead of an A, it's an upside-down V. The letters are in two colors. You've seen a hundred gas station signs with two-colored letters and misspelled words in real life.

For this is a contagious virus end-of-the-world-zombie-movie with no zombies.  The suspense of zombie attacks has been replaced by the danger that one might at any moment catch a pretty bad virus and die a slow excruciating death. We, for the most part, are subjected to watching the antics of four incredibly, irresponsible, stupid and cantankerous protagonists. The only suspense comes from waiting to see which one of these very deserving folks will be the next to catch the disease due to multitude of dumb actions. This is pretty much the entire film.This a good looking film and the director Alex Pastor can tell a story (in an annoying sort of way) and he keep things moving along (in an annoying sort of way). The film really does not look bad and even has a professional look and feel for a low budget indie horror film. There is a bit of cleverness here and there. I particular liked the opening sequence where the sky does a flip from the seashore to a desert road.The actors (although no standout performances)are not without talent - as I do not believe it is the actors' faults that they are so very annoying - I believe the actors are for the most instructed to play a bunch of irritating dopes...that are...well...irritating.  And they do it very well.For example: the four actors are required to behave on one hand like four people who's goal is do everything they can to survive and reach a safe destination and on the other hand behave like four drunks at a New Years Eve office party.  Ahh...that is one of the many rubs. For these two behaviors are a contradiction and watching these folks act out this contradiction gets on your nerves very fast. This also creates a big plot hole as you begin realize that there is no way that these jackasses could have survived as long as they have with their ludicrous behavior and minimal safety precautions.Now for the next problem...how to say this without spoilers.  There is an awful lot of things that make no logistical or logical sense or are completely implausible.  There is also to many contrived dangerous situations which were obviously filler in order to pad out a very thin plot.  The diving board scene for one - the breaking into a boarded up house for another.  Climb on the roof? when the flimsy wood could have been easily removed from the front door and windows. OK, you'll know it when you see it.  There is also the fact that this disease is so damn contagious but the cheapest Lowe's dust mask and little Clorox is all you need for protection. Doesn't sound so bad to me.The final problem - while I'm at it - is the ending - this is dark pessimistic movie - so if you going to do a dark pessimistic movie - you might as well go for a pay-off with a nice dark pessimistic twisty ending.  (Check out the film Shuttle for dark pessimistic twisty ending...or maybe better not) Anyway, I was really hopping for a knock-your-sox-off dark ending but instead the film peters out blandly with one of the characters (who we don't care about) waxing nostalgic in a long over dub.OK I said allot of negative stuff about the film (did I mention that it kind of gave me headache?)  But if you like dooms day films, with a professional look, that are sometimes clever, with a little gore, and a Dawn of the Dead feel - then Carriers is not too bad.  Carriers can't hold a candle to 28 Days or The Dawn of the Dead films or either one The Crazies films but its light years better then that ludicrous Ebola film with Dustin Hoffman.

1289244,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B002TZS5GU,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 4]","Carriers takes place shortly after a horrible new virus has devastated the United States (and presumably, the rest of the world), causing the infected to rot away while still alive.  They look like zombies, but they're not, and they don't come lurching after people to eat them; their ony danger is that they're highly infectious, so you don't want to be anywhere near them.  The movie follows four friends traveling cross-country in a van looking for a safe haven.First problem - the four characters.  I want to say that this isn't any fault of the actors, but these are four of the least sympathetic protagonists for any movie I've seen.  If it's the movie's intention to show that in this apocalyptic situation, the virus isn't the only threat, that the dark side of humanity is, they succeed, but they succeed too well.  Although there are a few likable characters here and there, their time is short-lived, as we find the four leads increasingly willing to go to any level of ruthlessness, to stoop to any low, and to turn on one another, to even marginally increase their chances for survival in an increasingly desperate situation.  It sounds like something that might have potential, that might come off as tragic, but they're just too willing to sacrifice anyone, to sacrifice their own loved ones, to sacrifice children, even when the threat to themselves is only suspected and not definate.  The movie may be trying to make some kind of statement about the state of the world, but if so, it doesn't really hit the target.  Any idea that there's a message behind this is only surmise, buried under a very nihilistic and gritty journey of four characters that one is pressed hard to care about.  And it's not just that they don't come off as 'good guys', because you can make a movie focusing on the bad guys and still have them interesting, with or without redeeming values.  It's a credit to the cast that they manage to turn in noticeably strong performances while playing characters who are neither likable nor interesting.Good points - this movie is very well made.  The acting, production values, special effects and all that are done well.  Chris Pine in particular turns in an impressive performance.  And the idea that this is trying to ask a question about the world - say, ""how far do we, and should we, go to protect ourselves from what may or not be a threat?"" or even ""from a real threat?""  There's potency in that, because it's a very valid question in a world where you have to weigh a lot of different factors, and would LIKE to do what's best for not just yourself but for everybody, but can't quite figure out exactly what that is.  In the example portrayed in this movie, the characters seem to end up attaching huge importance to their own chances for survival (even if it's just extending their life by one more day), a vastly smaller amount on the lives of those closest to them, and none whatsoever for the lives of strangers.  This might have been an effective characterization for 1 or 2 characters, but for ALL the main players?So it's quite depressing.  Not sad or tragic, just depressing, there's a big difference.  And although it's clearly a horror movie, it's not scary or suspenseful either, at least not to me.  Those into ultra-gritty dramas about humanity's dark side, or very into movies that serve as cautionary tales about that dark side, might find Carriers a bit more appealing than I did.  Also, if you just want to watch something to see a fine cast do a great job with very difficult material, this isn't a bad pick.  For me personally, the nihilistic/depressing aspects just too completely overwhelm everything else.  On the other hand, it's impossible to ignore the techical aspects of the show, and if a 'cautionary tale' is what they were going for, then they to some degree succeed.  So just because I wasn't that into this one, doesn't mean others won't like it more.  Personally though - not exactly a favorite, but not the worst either.",2,Well-Made But Depressing,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,3997,"['Carriers', 'place', 'shortly', 'horrible', 'new', 'virus', 'devastated', 'United', 'States', 'presumably', 'rest', 'world', 'causing', 'infected', 'rot', 'away', 'still', 'alive', 'look', 'zombies', ""'re"", 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'lurching', 'people', 'eat', 'ony', 'danger', ""'re"", 'highly', 'infectious', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'four', 'friends', 'traveling', 'cross-country', 'van', 'looking', 'safe', 'haven.First', 'problem', 'four', 'characters', 'want', 'say', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actors', 'are', 'four', 'least', 'sympathetic', 'protagonists', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'intention', 'show', 'apocalyptic', 'situation', 'virus', ""n't"", 'only', 'threat', 'dark', 'side', 'humanity', 'succeed', 'succeed', 'too', 'well', 'are', 'few', 'likable', 'characters', 'here', 'there', 'time', 'short-lived', 'find', 'four', 'leads', 'increasingly', 'willing', 'go', 'level', 'ruthlessness', 'stoop', 'low', 'turn', 'one', 'even', 'marginally', 'increase', 'chances', 'survival', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'situation', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'potential', 'might', 'come', 'off', 'tragic', ""'re"", 'just', 'too', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'anyone', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'loved', 'ones', 'sacrifice', 'children', 'even', 'when', 'threat', 'only', 'suspected', 'not', 'definate', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'trying', 'make', 'kind', 'statement', 'state', 'world', 'so', ""n't"", 'really', 'hit', 'target', 'idea', 'message', 'only', 'surmise', 'buried', 'very', 'nihilistic', 'gritty', 'journey', 'four', 'characters', 'one', 'pressed', 'hard', 'care', 'not', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', ""'good"", 'guys', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'focusing', 'bad', 'guys', 'still', 'have', 'interesting', 'redeeming', 'values', 'credit', 'cast', 'manage', 'turn', 'noticeably', 'strong', 'performances', 'playing', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'likable', 'interesting.Good', 'points', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'particular', 'turns', 'impressive', 'performance', 'idea', 'trying', 'ask', 'question', 'world', 'say', 'how', 'far', 'do', 'should', 'go', 'protect', 'what', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'threat', 'even', 'real', 'threat', 'potency', 'very', 'valid', 'question', 'world', 'where', 'have', 'weigh', 'lot', 'different', 'factors', 'would', 'LIKE', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'not', 'just', 'everybody', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'example', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'characters', 'seem', 'end', 'up', 'attaching', 'huge', 'importance', 'own', 'chances', 'survival', 'even', 'just', 'extending', 'life', 'one', 'more', 'day', 'vastly', 'smaller', 'amount', 'lives', 'closest', 'none', 'whatsoever', 'lives', 'strangers', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'characterization', '1', '2', 'characters', 'ALL', 'main', 'players', 'quite', 'depressing', 'Not', 'sad', 'tragic', 'just', 'depressing', 'big', 'difference', 'clearly', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'least', 'not', 'ultra-gritty', 'dramas', 'humanity', 'dark', 'side', 'very', 'movies', 'serve', 'cautionary', 'tales', 'dark', 'side', 'might', 'find', 'Carriers', 'bit', 'more', 'appealing', 'did', 'Also', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'see', 'fine', 'cast', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'very', 'difficult', 'material', ""n't"", 'bad', 'pick', 'personally', 'nihilistic/depressing', 'aspects', 'just', 'too', 'completely', 'overwhelm', 'everything', 'else', 'other', 'hand', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'techical', 'aspects', 'show', ""'cautionary"", 'tale', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'then', 'degree', 'succeed', 'So', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'one', ""n't"", 'mean', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'more', 'Personally', 'not', 'exactly', 'favorite', 'not', 'worst']",N/A

Along the way we get peppered with the usual long string of irritating moments and self defeating actions amongst this isolated crew. There are no zombies or nasty critters anywhere, just an infrequent mixing of other survivors out to save themselves. Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci play the brothers that lead this group, and they both give decent performances. The pace is not meant to be scary, and there is no horror (as the cover art would make you think - it shows the only real ""jumper"" moment with a dying person zombie look-alike). Some brief performances by Chris Meloni and a couple ofMad Men: Season 2regulars in Moses and Shipka.The 84 minutes seems short, but for what they made the film about in ambiguity and lack of closure or big picture items, it fits.

1289246,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B002TZS5GU,Stuart Conover,"[0, 0]","Written and directed by the brothers &Agrave;lex and David Pastor this was their first film to get a large showing at the box office. While not the first project either of the two have worked on it easily proves that they know exactly how to put together a well laid out post apocalyptic film.Set shortly after an unknown outbreak spread across the land killing a majority of the populace we follow a group of 4 friends (two brothers and their women they are dating) who are trying to reach an old beach house they know of which is so secluded they believe they can live there peacefully. One of my favorite aspects of this is we never see exactly the horrors of the outbreak - just the immediate after effects. It is not so far past the occurrence that everything has been looted, destroyed, or worn down due to time, but far enough that seeing other humans is rare. When we do see remnants of humanity - it's a world where clearly everyone is out for themselves.We are introduced to Brian (Chris Pine) the outgoing brother, Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci) who is more the brain to Brian's brawn, Brian's girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo), and the girl Danny is interested in Kate (Emily Vanvamp) and are easily shown who is who, their personalities, and how they interact with one another. It's four people in a very tense situation and they show how it can grate on their nerves and still have them come together. As mentioned above it's a very desolate area they are in and while they do meet up with 3 separate groups of people it is just to help advance the story - the story being our set of 4 friends.Most post apocalyptic films take the easy way out and bring up zombies or man v man with everyone out for themselves. This story shows how the group progresses from trying to help others, to being harmed by others, to blatantly in one case on Brian's part just taking what they need. Even when this happens though the true fleshing out of both caring, understanding, and all of the `good' parts of human nature has not been left out. I am not going to focus much on the three groups of people they meet up with (aside to point out that less time is spent with each group as time goes on) aside from the first group as it was a father (Christopher Meloni) and his infected daughter (Kiernan Shipka.) These were the most interesting of the non-main characters in the film as Christopher's character is just a man who wants to save his daughter who won't take no for an answer and is able to do so with words while Kiernan, for being so young, was able to play such a perfect roll.The movie knew how to bring up tension, show off human nature, and kill off important cast members without it seeming abrupt or without purpose. Everything fit well together and I cannot wait to see what the Pastor brothers put together next and can only hope that it is in the horror genre.

We watched the latter first and whilst it is a high octane, action fest amid an orgy of CGI it was ultimately uninspiring and vapid.Then we watched the low budget CGI and action free zone that is 'Carriers'. This is nearly a brilliant film but for all the reasons that most lovers of the sci-fi horror genre will not like. This is the relatively short story of a group of four teenagers on a road trip to the coast in a post pan endemic afflicted world where (like 'Survivors')most of the worlds population has died or is likely to be dead any time soon. I can see why so many people felt disappointed with this film as it was billed as some sort of Zombie/ horror flick and actually is neither.That is the backdrop but this is actually more of a moral study on how selfish and fragile we are as people. They are all rather unlikeable as characters but the more that comes out the more you can understand them. The two brothers are the central characters but the character development is done in tiny snap shot exchanges and you have to concentrate to pick it all up, there is little in the way of flash backs. Brian (the elder jock type - goes on to be the young Capt Kirk in one of the Star Trek spin offs) seems to be running away from the past as well as the disease and he is the alpha male who lays down the rules that ultimately mean they will all lose so were the rules right in the first place? Was anything right in the first place could be a secondary underlying question? But the human spirit certainly takes a kicking in this film, and you might need a cheer up afterwards. That said I found this totally watchable, and even a bit brave in the way it did not pander to the mid ground and very much like 'The Road' tries to show just how bad it would be and the heart rending decisions that you would need to do to survive. So I actually liked it, but so many people don't that you would probably be able to pick up one 'as new' from Amazon Market Place for a song.",4,"Not really a horror film, but so what",1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,2103,"['am', 'not', 'fan', 'modern', 'sci-fi', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'particularly', 'see', 'had', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'brought', '2012', 'watched', 'latter', 'first', 'whilst', 'high', 'octane', 'action', 'fest', 'orgy', 'CGI', 'was', 'ultimately', 'uninspiring', 'vapid.Then', 'watched', 'low', 'budget', 'CGI', 'action', 'free', 'zone', ""'Carriers"", 'nearly', 'brilliant', 'film', 'reasons', 'most', 'lovers', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'genre', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'relatively', 'short', 'story', 'group', 'four', 'teenagers', 'road', 'trip', 'coast', 'post', 'pan', 'endemic', 'afflicted', 'world', 'where', ""'Survivors"", 'most', 'worlds', 'population', 'died', 'likely', 'be', 'dead', 'time', 'soon', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'film', 'was', 'billed', 'sort', 'Zombie/', 'horror', 'flick', 'actually', 'backdrop', 'actually', 'more', 'moral', 'study', 'how', 'selfish', 'fragile', 'are', 'people', 'are', 'rather', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'more', 'out', 'more', 'can', 'understand', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'central', 'characters', 'character', 'development', 'done', 'tiny', 'snap', 'shot', 'exchanges', 'have', 'concentrate', 'pick', 'up', 'little', 'way', 'flash', 'backs', 'Brian', 'elder', 'jock', 'type', 'be', 'young', 'Capt', 'Kirk', 'one', 'Star', 'Trek', 'spin', 'offs', 'be', 'running', 'away', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'disease', 'alpha', 'male', 'who', 'rules', 'ultimately', 'mean', 'will', 'lose', 'so', 'were', 'rules', 'right', 'first', 'place', 'Was', 'anything', 'right', 'first', 'place', 'could', 'be', 'secondary', 'underlying', 'question', 'human', 'spirit', 'certainly', 'kicking', 'film', 'might', 'need', 'cheer', 'up', 'afterwards', 'said', 'found', 'totally', 'watchable', 'even', 'bit', 'brave', 'way', 'did', 'not', 'pander', 'mid', 'ground', 'very', 'much', 'Road', 'tries', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'would', 'be', 'heart', 'rending', 'decisions', 'would', 'need', 'do', 'survive', 'actually', 'liked', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'one', ""'as"", 'new', 'Amazon', 'Market', 'Place', 'song']",N/A

Would you curl up in a ball and hope for the end, or would you make a run for something comforting, knowing that the world is going to dissolve anyway? That's the problem that we find two brothers and their companions facing as they track into the great wide open, because the world has indeed been flushed down the cosmic potty. It has no rules, either, and it has nothing to quarantine that tomorrow will truly come. The only thing that seems to work, at least in our group's favor, is rules. Clean - a lot whenever you touch anything. If a person becomes infected, they are dead.  Do not mourn the dead and do not come in contact with them. Do not break these rules (and I am, of course, paraphrasing). These sound good, right? The problem is that there is a real world out there, and the real world has little kids and nice people and shortages all around. What would you be willing to do to make it to the place that you have always dreamed of going?When I picked up Carriers, I thought I was picking up one thing but picked up something totally different altogether. Instead of your typical ""end of the world"" scenario, you find yourself riding shotgun with four people - with four personalities - as they try to do the best they can while approaching a dream two brothers still share. It involves childhood and a beach and the fact that, once there, the two can never die. The problems come quickly, however, and they are relentless. First, they run into a dad and a little girl who need their help. What do they do? They have someone get infected. What value does love have? Things like this keep on coming and, sometimes, hell is paved with the best of intentions. And breaking the rules, well, that seems to be a good way to end up on a slab.When acting in a movie like this, you really have to sell the part you are playing. That seems to be the thing that divides B-movies from the big kids and it also seems to be the thing that keeps the momentum from falling by the wayside. I have seen that happen in quite a few movies and was scared that it could happen here but, much to my surprise, Carriers pulls off some amazing things. It takes something that is simply about a sickness killing everyone and it makes you think and feel. It also showed you the dark side of caring and what not caring can do to you, giving you the duality that is really the a-bomb inside the Cheerios. I liked that, too, because I thought that everyone could relate to something inside the film.If you are expecting a lot of violence, chuck that out and think of something fresh. Instead of smelling the flowers think of a new arrangement altogether, where the world intruders and the world excludes but where the canvas is totally unique. It is death that is coming from somewhere that nobody really understands and, in that context, it is unlike anything that we have seen in a while. There are no undead or plague-riddled things spreading the virus. There are simply people - children and parents and doctors and teachers - and they are all dying. And it is consuming the world, almost assuring you that you will die as well. That's the thing about the movie - there is no happy ending. There is only the now and, in the end, we see what the now can cost us as humans. It is beautiful and poetic and sad, too, and I personally found that almost overwhelming.I loved that about Carriers - it made me feel and it made me think about when another day of breathing would stop being worth the cost. Watched with an open mind, I think you would enjoy it as well.",5,When is the cost too much?,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,3614,"['What', 'would', 'do', 'humanity', 'started', 'die', 'Would', 'curl', 'up', 'ball', 'hope', 'end', 'would', 'make', 'run', 'something', 'comforting', 'knowing', 'world', 'going', 'dissolve', 'anyway', 'problem', 'find', 'two', 'brothers', 'companions', 'facing', 'track', 'great', 'wide', 'open', 'world', 'indeed', 'been', 'flushed', 'down', 'cosmic', 'potty', 'rules', 'nothing', 'quarantine', 'tomorrow', 'will', 'truly', 'come', 'only', 'thing', 'work', 'least', 'group', 'favor', 'rules', 'Clean', 'lot', 'whenever', 'touch', 'anything', 'person', 'becomes', 'infected', 'are', 'dead', 'Do', 'not', 'mourn', 'dead', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'contact', 'Do', 'not', 'break', 'rules', 'am', 'course', 'paraphrasing', 'sound', 'good', 'right', 'problem', 'real', 'world', 'there', 'real', 'world', 'little', 'kids', 'nice', 'people', 'shortages', 'around', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'make', 'place', 'have', 'always', 'dreamed', 'going', 'When', 'picked', 'up', 'Carriers', 'thought', 'was', 'picking', 'up', 'one', 'thing', 'picked', 'up', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'altogether', 'Instead', 'typical', 'end', 'world', 'scenario', 'find', 'riding', 'shotgun', 'four', 'people', 'four', 'personalities', 'try', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'approaching', 'dream', 'two', 'brothers', 'still', 'share', 'childhood', 'beach', 'fact', 'once', 'there', 'two', 'can', 'never', 'die', 'problems', 'come', 'quickly', 'however', 'are', 'relentless', 'First', 'run', 'dad', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'need', 'help', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'have', 'someone', 'get', 'infected', 'What', 'value', 'love', 'have', 'Things', 'keep', 'coming', 'sometimes', 'hell', 'paved', 'best', 'intentions', 'breaking', 'rules', 'well', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'slab.When', 'acting', 'movie', 'really', 'have', 'sell', 'part', 'are', 'playing', 'be', 'thing', 'B-movies', 'big', 'kids', 'also', 'be', 'thing', 'momentum', 'falling', 'wayside', 'have', 'seen', 'happen', 'quite', 'few', 'movies', 'was', 'scared', 'could', 'happen', 'here', 'much', 'surprise', 'Carriers', 'amazing', 'things', 'something', 'simply', 'sickness', 'killing', 'everyone', 'think', 'feel', 'also', 'showed', 'dark', 'side', 'caring', 'what', 'not', 'caring', 'can', 'do', 'giving', 'duality', 'really', 'a-bomb', 'Cheerios', 'liked', 'too', 'thought', 'everyone', 'could', 'relate', 'something', 'film.If', 'are', 'expecting', 'lot', 'violence', 'chuck', 'think', 'something', 'fresh', 'Instead', 'smelling', 'flowers', 'think', 'new', 'arrangement', 'altogether', 'where', 'world', 'intruders', 'world', 'where', 'canvas', 'totally', 'unique', 'death', 'coming', 'somewhere', 'nobody', 'really', 'understands', 'context', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'are', 'undead', 'plague-riddled', 'things', 'spreading', 'virus', 'are', 'simply', 'people', 'children', 'parents', 'doctors', 'teachers', 'are', 'dying', 'consuming', 'world', 'almost', 'assuring', 'will', 'die', 'as', 'well', 'thing', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'only', 'now', 'end', 'see', 'what', 'now', 'can', 'cost', 'humans', 'beautiful', 'poetic', 'sad', 'too', 'personally', 'found', 'almost', 'overwhelming.I', 'loved', 'Carriers', 'made', 'feel', 'made', 'think', 'when', 'day', 'breathing', 'would', 'stop', 'being', 'cost', 'Watched', 'open', 'mind', 'think', 'would', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well']",N/A

1289255,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002TZS5GU,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","In a nutshell ""Carriers"" is a George A Romeo film without zombies. Or maybe ""28 Days Later"" without undeads for that matter. The first feature film (by the Spanish-born &Agrave;lex Pastor and David Pastor) feels less like a horror movie than a character study drama, about ordinary people under the most horrific circumstances. This is not to say that ""Carriers"" is without scares. Also, the film has its own peculiar charm and the filmmakers did a cleaver job of creating a very bleak post-apocalyptic world within limited budget, but as you watch the film, you might get a strong feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again.Meet four young travelers Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), Brian (Chris Pine), Bobby (Piper Perabo) and Kate (Emily VanCamp). They are actually survivors of a global pandemic and they know any physical contact with the ""carriers"" means death, which, it is suggested, a slow one. Now they encounter a father (Christopher Meloni) and his daughter (Kiernan Shipka) stranded on the desert road. Their best option is to leave and forget them. They could have done so if it had not been a small accident.The rest of the film's story is fairly predictable. I don't reveal too much here, but suffice it to say that most episodes of the film have already been done in other end-of-the-world movies. I can also point out that Danny and Brian are brothers with very different personalities, a wild and reckless type and a silent and contemplative type. Actors did a fine job, but their journey's end is nothing surprising.Some say people exhibit extraordinary courage and strength in facing great dangers. The Pastor brothers seem not to believe that. That is OK with me as long as the filmmakers provide something new. The beautiful cinematography of Benot Debie (""Irr&eacute;versible"" ""Innocence"") is worth a look and fans of Chris Pine will enjoy watching his fine acting (the film was completed in 2007 before he became internationally famous as a new James T. Kirk), but ""Carrier"" is a thriller that is decent but a bit too familiar.",3,Thriller Decent But a Bit Too Familiar,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,2050,"['nutshell', 'Carriers', 'George', 'A', 'Romeo', 'film', 'zombies', 'maybe', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'undeads', 'matter', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Spanish-born', 'Agrave', 'lex', 'Pastor', 'David', 'Pastor', 'less', 'horror', 'movie', 'character', 'study', 'drama', 'ordinary', 'people', 'most', 'horrific', 'circumstances', 'not', 'say', 'Carriers', 'scares', 'Also', 'film', 'own', 'peculiar', 'charm', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'cleaver', 'job', 'creating', 'very', 'bleak', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'limited', 'budget', 'watch', 'film', 'might', 'get', 'strong', 'feeling', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'again.Meet', 'four', 'young', 'travelers', 'Danny', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', 'Brian', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Bobby', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Kate', 'Emily', 'VanCamp', 'are', 'actually', 'survivors', 'global', 'pandemic', 'know', 'physical', 'contact', 'carriers', 'death', 'suggested', 'slow', 'one', 'Now', 'encounter', 'father', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'daughter', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'stranded', 'desert', 'road', 'best', 'option', 'leave', 'forget', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'small', 'accident.The', 'rest', 'film', 'story', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'say', 'most', 'episodes', 'film', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'end-of-the-world', 'movies', 'can', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'Danny', 'Brian', 'are', 'brothers', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'wild', 'reckless', 'type', 'silent', 'contemplative', 'type', 'Actors', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'journey', 'end', 'nothing', 'surprising.Some', 'say', 'people', 'exhibit', 'extraordinary', 'courage', 'strength', 'facing', 'great', 'dangers', 'Pastor', 'brothers', 'seem', 'not', 'believe', 'OK', 'as', 'long', 'filmmakers', 'provide', 'something', 'new', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Benot', 'Debie', 'Irr', 'eacute', 'versible', 'Innocence', 'look', 'fans', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'fine', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'completed', '2007', 'became', 'internationally', 'famous', 'new', 'James', 'T.', 'Kirk', 'Carrier', 'thriller', 'decent', 'bit', 'too', 'familiar']",N/A

The father should have made the little girl potty right there by the car (blocking her from sight as much as possible) because HE KNEW they would drive away abandoning them if he left the car to take his daughter to the bathroom.  And, for a man concerned with saving his own life, Brain recklessly risks his life by wasting bullets which would be needed later and goofing off tipping over a golf cart/falling out and later almost falling off a pool diving board into infected water.Bobbie, Brian's girlfriend, is compassionate and wants to help the little girl and her father.  She convinces Brian and the others to take them using plastic clear wrap or something to separate their seat from the others.  The father/daughter needed gas and used their car to block the road so when Brian's car came by, they would trade for gas for water.  Instead, Brian leaves them but returns after his oil pan leaks.  They use Brian's gas and the father/daughter SUV.  Bobbie later tries to help the girl when she is choking and the girl spit up on her giving Bobbie the disease.  The brother and his friend Kate convince Brian to abandon Bobbie like they did the father/daughter earlier.Danny was supposed to the be compassionate brother compared to Brian but that was a lie.  They BOTH deliberately left their parents to die.  Danny also didn't stop Brian from driving away leaving the father/daughter and bother Danny and his friend Kate - another loser - convince Brian to dump Bobby.  He lies constantly to screw others over.  I can only HOPE that the starving dog that bit Danny when he broke into a farm house gave him rabies or that sickness because the dog was eating an infected body.  Danny tries to steal Brian's gun when Brian is running an infection from the bullet wound.  Danny and his friend Kate steal the gun, shoot Brian and abandon him.  I don't know why Danny got upset when his brother shots two women when he is as bad as his brother is.Kate - a real loser.  Selfish to the core.  She is despicable and I hoped throughout the film she would get sick or hurt and die.  There is still hope she got sick from sitting next to Bobbie or gets sick from Danny who got splashed with infected dog blood and bit by that same dog that was eating infected bodies.Ironically, after Brian/Kate/Danny steal the father/daughter car and abandon them and then later dump Bobbie, they need gas.  Brian cuts off the road from the 2 women driving in a car just like a desperate father did earlier to them.  The two women say no and Danny lies and says he is Christian and that his wife (no wife) is pregnant trying to convince them to stop when they were going to STEAL the gas or the car or both and abandon both women.  When the 2 women try to drive away, Brian shoots the driver dead.  It was GREAT when the passenger SHOOTS Brian in the kneecap before he shoots her.  Then Kate steals their gas and they leave them there to suffer and die slowly if they weren't dead already.The disease can't be too infectious because they remove the keys from an ignition with a dead guy behind the wheel and the keys didn't infect them.  They sat next to Bobbie in the car for days when she was infected and didn't get infected.  Danny takes a rifle from an infected man's hands (in 2nd story of house) and didn't get infected.  But there is still hope that Danny and Kate still die.  Hopefully, they will.",1,Unsavory Characters,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,3577,"['ALERT', 'MOVIE', 'SPOILERS', 'BELOWWhat', 'bunch', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'Brian', 'selfish', 'jerk', 'who', 'vehicle', 'father', 'trying', 'save', 'infected', 'daughter', 'leaving', 'later', 'die', 'father', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'little', 'girl', 'potty', 'right', 'there', 'car', 'blocking', 'sight', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'HE', 'KNEW', 'would', 'drive', 'away', 'abandoning', 'left', 'car', 'take', 'daughter', 'bathroom', 'man', 'concerned', 'saving', 'own', 'life', 'Brain', 'recklessly', 'life', 'wasting', 'bullets', 'would', 'be', 'needed', 'later', 'goofing', 'off', 'tipping', 'golf', 'cart/falling', 'out', 'later', 'almost', 'falling', 'off', 'pool', 'diving', 'board', 'infected', 'water.Bobbie', 'Brian', 'girlfriend', 'compassionate', 'help', 'little', 'girl', 'father', 'Brian', 'others', 'take', 'using', 'plastic', 'clear', 'wrap', 'something', 'separate', 'seat', 'others', 'father/daughter', 'needed', 'gas', 'used', 'car', 'block', 'road', 'so', 'when', 'Brian', 'car', 'came', 'would', 'trade', 'gas', 'water', 'Instead', 'Brian', 'returns', 'oil', 'pan', 'leaks', 'use', 'Brian', 'gas', 'father/daughter', 'SUV', 'Bobbie', 'later', 'help', 'girl', 'when', 'choking', 'girl', 'up', 'giving', 'Bobbie', 'disease', 'brother', 'friend', 'Kate', 'convince', 'Brian', 'abandon', 'Bobbie', 'did', 'father/daughter', 'earlier.Danny', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'compassionate', 'brother', 'compared', 'Brian', 'was', 'lie', 'BOTH', 'deliberately', 'left', 'parents', 'die', 'Danny', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Brian', 'driving', 'away', 'leaving', 'father/daughter', 'bother', 'Danny', 'friend', 'Kate', 'loser', 'convince', 'Brian', 'dump', 'Bobby', 'constantly', 'screw', 'others', 'can', 'only', 'HOPE', 'starving', 'dog', 'bit', 'Danny', 'when', 'broke', 'farm', 'house', 'gave', 'rabies', 'sickness', 'dog', 'was', 'eating', 'infected', 'body', 'Danny', 'steal', 'Brian', 'gun', 'when', 'Brian', 'running', 'infection', 'bullet', 'wound', 'Danny', 'friend', 'Kate', 'gun', 'shoot', 'Brian', 'abandon', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Danny', 'got', 'upset', 'when', 'brother', 'shots', 'two', 'women', 'when', 'as', 'bad', 'brother', 'is.Kate', 'real', 'loser', 'Selfish', 'core', 'despicable', 'hoped', 'film', 'would', 'get', 'sick', 'hurt', 'die', 'still', 'hope', 'got', 'sick', 'sitting', 'next', 'Bobbie', 'sick', 'Danny', 'who', 'got', 'splashed', 'infected', 'dog', 'blood', 'bit', 'same', 'dog', 'was', 'eating', 'infected', 'bodies.Ironically', 'Brian/Kate/Danny', 'steal', 'father/daughter', 'car', 'abandon', 'then', 'later', 'dump', 'Bobbie', 'need', 'gas', 'Brian', 'road', '2', 'women', 'driving', 'car', 'just', 'desperate', 'father', 'did', 'earlier', 'two', 'women', 'say', 'Danny', 'lies', 'Christian', 'wife', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'trying', 'convince', 'stop', 'when', 'were', 'going', 'STEAL', 'gas', 'car', 'abandon', 'women', 'When', '2', 'women', 'try', 'drive', 'away', 'Brian', 'driver', 'dead', 'was', 'GREAT', 'when', 'passenger', 'SHOOTS', 'Brian', 'kneecap', 'shoots', 'Then', 'Kate', 'steals', 'gas', 'leave', 'there', 'suffer', 'die', 'slowly', 'were', ""n't"", 'dead', 'already.The', 'disease', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'infectious', 'remove', 'keys', 'ignition', 'dead', 'guy', 'wheel', 'keys', 'did', ""n't"", 'infect', 'sat', 'next', 'Bobbie', 'car', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'infected', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'infected', 'Danny', 'rifle', 'infected', 'man', 'hands', '2nd', 'story', 'house', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'infected', 'still', 'hope', 'Danny', 'Kate', 'still', 'Hopefully', 'will']",N/A
1289257,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B002TZS5GU,Wuchak,"[2, 2]","2009's ""Carriers"" is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic films. The story involves four youths in Southwest USA seeking sanctuary from a lethal virus that has wiped out much of the population and continues to do so. To all intents and purposes Government no longer exists and society is now a world without laws. To survive, they live by a set of rules of their own making: Avoid anyone with the disease, trust no one (not even your friends/family), immediately sterilize anything a carrier touches and realize that anyone with the disease is already dead.The four youths are Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), his brother Brian (Chris Pine), his girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo) and Danny's school friend Kate (Emily VanCampo). Over the course of a handful of days they are continually forced to make difficult moral decisions that no human being should ever have to make. They soon discover that the real enemy is not the sinister pandemic, but the darkness within their very own hearts.Unlike semi-goofy post-apocalyptic films like the Mad Max series (Mad Max (Special Edition),The Road Warrior / Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome), ""Carriers"" is deadly serious from beginning to end. This works in the film's favor because if the filmmakers take the material seriously the viewer can as well.One of the moral conundrums explored is what do you do if a loved one gets the disease? Since anyone with the disease is as good as dead, do you mercifully kill them? Leave them behind to suffer and die alone? Or stay with them, which is tantamount to suicide since you'll catch the virus as well?The film also explores one's reaction to such a pandemic: Do we forsake all sense of morality in an attempt to survive -- lie, steal, forsake and murder -- or do we hold on to our moral compass, come what may? Is life worth living if you must become an immoral, wicked savage to survive? Isn't it better to live with dignity at all costs -- fight with nobility and die with dignity when and if we must?""Carriers"" is to be commended for provoking such poignant questions.Some denounce the film on the grounds that it's too downbeat and depressing, but wouldn't a lawless society with a highly contagious lethal virus on the loose be a very dire situation? In other words, the downbeat vibe reflects the reality of the story. This doesn't mean that every character has to be some moralless savage, as one of the main characters becomes, but it definitely makes the proceedings believable for the viewer. That said, I admit that I would have preferred if the film offered more glimpses of hope, faith and human dignity, but the filmmakers obviously wanted to explore the near-hopeless-situation element and the film should be accepted and respected on that level.One obvious plothole is the perfectly maintained lawn of the golf course at the abandoned resort.The film was shot in desolate regions of New Mexico & Texas and runs a short-but-sweet 84 minutes.FINAL SAY: ""Carriers"" is an excellent -- albeit decidedly melancholic -- depiction of a post-apocalyptic world where conventional law & order are non-existent. The film successfully stimulates moral reflection and is engrossing from beginning to end. Although it looses points for being too downbeat...!!ENDING SPOILER ALERT!!...especially the climax. C'mon, the dude makes it to the remote beach and he has a hot lass at his side; they could be the new Adam & Eve, but all he does is whine like it's the end of the world or something.GRADE: A-",5,Post-Apocalyptic Horror,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,3479,"['2009', 'Carriers', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'post-apocalyptic', 'films', 'story', 'four', 'youths', 'Southwest', 'USA', 'seeking', 'sanctuary', 'lethal', 'virus', 'wiped', 'out', 'much', 'population', 'do', 'so', 'intents', 'purposes', 'Government', 'no', 'longer', 'society', 'now', 'world', 'laws', 'survive', 'live', 'set', 'rules', 'own', 'making', 'Avoid', 'anyone', 'disease', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'friends/family', 'immediately', 'sterilize', 'anything', 'carrier', 'touches', 'realize', 'anyone', 'disease', 'already', 'dead.The', 'four', 'youths', 'are', 'Danny', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', 'brother', 'Brian', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'girlfriend', 'Bobby', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Danny', 'school', 'friend', 'Kate', 'Emily', 'VanCampo', 'course', 'handful', 'days', 'are', 'continually', 'forced', 'make', 'difficult', 'moral', 'decisions', 'human', 'being', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'make', 'soon', 'discover', 'real', 'enemy', 'not', 'sinister', 'pandemic', 'darkness', 'very', 'own', 'hearts.Unlike', 'semi-goofy', 'post-apocalyptic', 'films', 'Mad', 'Max', 'series', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Road', 'Warrior', '/', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Beyond', 'Thunderdome', 'Carriers', 'deadly', 'serious', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'favor', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'material', 'seriously', 'viewer', 'can', 'well.One', 'moral', 'conundrums', 'explored', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'loved', 'one', 'disease', 'anyone', 'disease', 'as', 'good', 'dead', 'do', 'mercifully', 'kill', 'Leave', 'suffer', 'die', 'alone', 'stay', 'tantamount', 'suicide', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'virus', 'well', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'reaction', 'pandemic', 'Do', 'forsake', 'sense', 'morality', 'attempt', 'survive', 'lie', 'steal', 'forsake', 'murder', 'do', 'hold', 'moral', 'compass', 'come', 'what', 'may', 'Is', 'life', 'living', 'must', 'become', 'immoral', 'wicked', 'savage', 'survive', ""n't"", 'better', 'live', 'dignity', 'costs', 'fight', 'nobility', 'die', 'dignity', 'when', 'must', 'Carriers', 'be', 'commended', 'provoking', 'such', 'poignant', 'questions.Some', 'denounce', 'film', 'grounds', 'too', 'downbeat', 'depressing', 'would', ""n't"", 'lawless', 'society', 'highly', 'contagious', 'lethal', 'virus', 'loose', 'be', 'very', 'dire', 'situation', 'other', 'words', 'downbeat', 'vibe', 'reality', 'story', ""n't"", 'mean', 'character', 'be', 'moralless', 'savage', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'becomes', 'definitely', 'proceedings', 'believable', 'viewer', 'said', 'admit', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'film', 'offered', 'more', 'glimpses', 'hope', 'faith', 'human', 'dignity', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'explore', 'near-hopeless-situation', 'element', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'accepted', 'respected', 'level.One', 'obvious', 'plothole', 'perfectly', 'maintained', 'lawn', 'golf', 'course', 'abandoned', 'resort.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'desolate', 'regions', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Texas', 'short-but-sweet', '84', 'minutes.FINAL', 'SAY', 'Carriers', 'excellent', 'decidedly', 'melancholic', 'depiction', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'where', 'conventional', 'law', 'order', 'are', 'non-existent', 'film', 'successfully', 'moral', 'reflection', 'engrossing', 'beginning', 'end', 'points', 'being', 'too', 'downbeat', 'ENDING', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'especially', 'climax', ""C'mon"", 'dude', 'remote', 'beach', 'hot', 'lass', 'side', 'could', 'be', 'new', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'whine', 'end', 'world', 'something.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
