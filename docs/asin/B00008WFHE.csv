748271,A1O3ONM1MJM7EM,B00008WFHE,"C. Marsteller ""Cafreen""","[8, 8]","Ever since Disney's takeover, the old original Baby Einstein style is now just the skeleton of this latest addition to the series. The puppetry is completely different, kind of like ""Johnny Quest"" meets claymation. It's sort of odd to watch at first, but you will eventually get the hang of it (hey, it's for our kids, right?) It's the kind of jerky motion that you'd see in the old claymation cartoons. Well, I think I remember someone complaining about the bad puppetry in the previous Baby Neptune, they have definitely addressed this issue, for now they are moving with less of a sock-puppet feel and more of a marionette. (I kind of miss those sock-puppets!)It's disappointing to hear them use the same classical music as in the other DVDs, there are *some* new songs, but LOTS of recycled music. With all the beautiful classical music available, it's surprising that they didn't care to find different songs to fit the Galileo theme.You will also notice the backdrop to be dark. I think they are trying to hone in on the ""night sky"" feel / Galileo theme compared to the stark white backgrounds from before. It's as if it's been planned by some slick sophisticated advertising executive, it really has a different feel to it.With the puppet interludes in between various scenes, they use the same (if not completely identical) scene with Baby Galileo (who is a baby kangaroo) holding a balloon and letting it go. Over and over, at least 4 times! It was kind of neat in Baby Beethoven how they had varying scenes with the duck and the dog. If you have Baby Beethoven, you'll see what I mean.Well, all my criticisms are just MY criticisms. I think the real indicator of whether or not this is a hit is my 14 month old daughter! As with any new DVD, she's a little apprehensive and sometimes scared at first, but with multiple playings, this particular Baby Einstein has been as captivating as the rest of them. This also keeps her engaged, and I guess that's the opinion that really counts!

I bought this video when it first came out since my daughter loves to look at the moon in the  sky with her father. To my surprise she had no interest in this video and whined until I shut it. I then read the reviews here and realized my daughter wasn't the only one who disliked this one. So we put it away and watched her other faves. I could only take so much of the others before I decided to try this one again. My daughter sat through half of it. Next time she watched it completely. I haven't had a problem since. This one now captivates her. We've had problems getting her to sleep on her own. We always have to rock her to sleep which is much harder now that she's older. Now we give her a bath, tuck her favorite doll under her arm and we watch this video. It calms her completely and when it's over we put her to bed and she'll go to sleep on her own. I couldn't be happier. She may not understand much about the sky but she has learned how to concentrate and we now have a great bedtime ritual. Hopefully in a while she won't need the video to be put down to bed for sleep. Baby Einstein has come through yet again. So to all the discouraged buyers, I advise you to try again.

Reviewers are saying how aweful it was, but are giving no explanation as to why, so I'm going to explain why it worked for me and my child.I was extremely pleased with the Baby Galileo video.  My daughter is three and a half years old and soaks in anything she sees. Although she is on the older end of the suggested ages for these videos, she still is learning from them and enjoying them.  This video was a great way for her to learn the general ideas about the sky.  The video opens with puppets, which are a trademark in Julie Clark's videos. There are narrations by children, and 15 different pieces of classical music ranging from Claire De Lune to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  There are several chapters in the video introducing a new concept- those being the sky, the sun, the clouds, the stars, the moon, the planets, the galaxy and space. There are real pictures and video of the sun, moon and others while they are supplemented with toys, graphics and music that go along with the sky/space theme.I am an early childhood educator, and I see these videos as being some of the most developmentally appropriate videos out there for children to watch.  The video expresses many subjects, textures, colors and most of all, beautiful classical music to soothe your child and spark their interest and attention.  I'm not quite sure why these videos haven't worked for other parents, but they've been successful in my family and many others that I know.

I have found it to be quite interesting myself.  I love the beautiful scenes of the sun rising and setting, the clouds going by, the moon rising, the stars filling the sky, the planets, and especially the gorgeous scenes of different galaxies.I don't see a problem with having vocabulary that young kids aren't likely to get.

The video seems slow in parts and not so visually stimulating as other Baby Einstein videos.  A friend of mine who works for a local newspaper loaned me an advance copy of a wonderful new DVD entitled, ""MY FANTASTIC FIELD TRIP TO THE PLANETS.""  This DVD not only grabbed the interest of my baby, but my four year old and seven year old cannot get enough.  In this DVD, the planets are characters with faces which really helps my kids identify them.  Baby Galileo shows planets that to a baby are hard to focus on.  That's why the faces on the planets in ""MY FANTASTIC FIELD TRIP TO THE PLANETS"" was a great idea.  After watching only once, they knew all nine planets!  The songs are terrific and have fun, fact-ladden lyrics that my older children now sing all the time.  I am very impressed.  My baby enjoys the planet faces, while my older children are really learning from the DVD.  So, Baby Galileo is just okay for very young babies, but the favorite in our house and one that will not be quickly outgrown is ""MY FANTASTIC FIELD TRIP TO THE PLANETS.""",2,Good for introducing babies to planets but not super exciting.,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,1125,"['eight', 'month', 'old', 'video', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'long', 'video', 'slow', 'parts', 'not', 'so', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'other', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'videos', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'local', 'newspaper', 'loaned', 'advance', 'copy', 'wonderful', 'new', 'DVD', 'entitled', 'MY', 'FANTASTIC', 'FIELD', 'TRIP', 'TO', 'THE', 'PLANETS', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'grabbed', 'interest', 'baby', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'DVD', 'planets', 'are', 'characters', 'really', 'kids', 'identify', 'Baby', 'Galileo', 'planets', 'baby', 'are', 'hard', 'focus', 'why', 'planets', 'MY', 'FANTASTIC', 'FIELD', 'TRIP', 'TO', 'THE', 'PLANETS', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'watching', 'only', 'once', 'knew', 'nine', 'planets', 'songs', 'are', 'terrific', 'have', 'fun', 'fact-ladden', 'lyrics', 'older', 'children', 'now', 'sing', 'time', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'baby', 'planet', 'older', 'children', 'are', 'really', 'learning', 'DVD', 'So', 'Baby', 'Galileo', 'just', 'okay', 'very', 'young', 'babies', 'favorite', 'house', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'quickly', 'outgrown', 'MY', 'FANTASTIC', 'FIELD', 'TRIP', 'TO', 'THE', 'PLANETS']",N/A
