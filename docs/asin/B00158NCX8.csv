1149030,A3HD7M4B50KVE9,B00158NCX8,anonymous,"[51, 53]","Update 1-23-13 - I still use this program almost daily 19 months later and plan to the rest of my life.  The length of the program, the moves included and the measured deep breathing throughout are exactly what I need to keep going.  I've tried about every other senior yoga program there is and don't like any of them except for John Schorletzer (sp?) Ageless Yoga which I sometimes alternate with - his really isn't yoga but a gentle exercise program that increases mobility which I also need.  Anne's is true healing Iyengar yoga and I don't think you can find anything better. :o)My review from 8-2-11 not long after I started it:  I highly recommend this program by Anne Burnell for anyone with fibromyalgia.  It is not advertised for FMS, but it should be - it has worked an absolute miracle on me.  I've tried a couple of other DVDs and both made the pain much worse.  19 years of ""fibro-fog"" disappeared during the very first session 7 weeks ago, and hasn't returned.  Headaches and chest pains (anyone with FMS will know what I'm talking about) were gone after two sessions, crippling back pain was nearly gone by two weeks.  I could also bend over to pick up something out of the floor with no pain for the first time in 8 years.  Amazing improvements in flexibility and energy level allow me to spend some time on enjoyable craft projects now instead of spending all my time on the sofa taking non-restorative naps.  It doesn't cure FMS, but it keeps the symptoms at bay temporarily if I faithfully do it first thing in the morning.  Certain activities can cause flareups of back pain and fatigue as before, but not as severe, and the next session will usually settle it back down.This is true healing yoga on a simplified scale. I don't understand how something that looks so easy can have any affect on your well-being, but it definitely does. Soothing music and a beginning relaxation session get your body and mind ready for the exercises.  Easy gentle moves all while seated in a chair with emphasis on deep breathing gets oxygen to all the muscles that are being stretched and creates the miracle :o)  And the time flies by - total of 40 minutes including the ending relaxation, but it seems more like only 5 minutes have passed so don't be afraid it will take too long and that you will get bored.  It's the best 40 minutes I could ever spend. I haven't gone past the basic session yet but hope to soon start making use of Anne's other DVD set for seniors, called Stretch & Strength, on alternate days.  I had so much improvement in the first couple of weeks I have since bought 8 DVDs as gifts for family and friends that I thought might get some benefit from it.  Before receiving this DVD,  I thought the rest of my life would be spent on the sofa. Thank you Anne for saving my life!

So I went through the physical theraphy which helped my shoulder and back to heal. Yet the doctor told me the pain would be chronic for the rest of my life. And I was not going to let this pain stay with me. So I tried many things, and then discovered this Chair Yoga Program. It is meant for really any age from young to old who have limited range of movement. This program is very gentle for me and is easy to follow. After using this for about a month at 6 days of the week, found that my range of motion has improved.If you purchase this, start by just doing this for one half of the time for the first 4 - 6 days, then gradually get into doing the whole program. This way it will be easier to use and follow and you will work your way up to the whole program.What I have found is that this is similar to a type of Yoga Theraphy Class that I take a gym. It is a great therapy for me to use for my shoulder and back and now, I am almost pain free and have my full motion back in my shoulder, right arm and back areas.One more thing: I have had this program for over one year. Just got around to doing a review for it. Noticed that this is kind of hard to find.
