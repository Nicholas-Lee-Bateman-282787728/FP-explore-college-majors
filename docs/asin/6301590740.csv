257130,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6301590740,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 7]","Peter Sellers stars as Chance, a learning disabled man who is evicted by lawyers from his landlord's estate after his benefactor dies.  Simple, yet dignified, his only recourse is to leave with nothing but his umbrella and a suitcase with his sparest belongings.  He comes across tough neighborhoods asking people for food and a place to stay with a garden until he has a minor accident where a limousine backs up into his leg.  Passenger Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine) is so taken in by him, she  offers to bring him to a hospital.  Seeming so innocent, she takes him instead to their estate where her husband tycoon, Ben (Melvyn Douglas) is bedridden with a blood disease often associated with children.  Knowing nothing much more than what he sees on television and his own gardening skills, Chance (renamed Chauncey Gardener by his own conversational mishaps) talks about seasons and gardening growth until he meets the President of the United States (Jack Warden) who visits Ben seeking his economic advice.  Once able to impress the President, everyone (including a television audience) thinks they're hearing profound financial advice from an inside man.  In the meantime, Eve becomes infatuated with someone whom she only half knows to rejuvenate her life from her older, sick husband; while the rest of the world tries to figure out the identity of this new, stellar personality.`Being There' is so sweet it takes off any of the cynical edge of the satire.  Hardly plausible, the actors and script do well enough to suspend our disbelief, nevertheless.  The movie is quirky and innovative for its time.  Afterall, when the world waits to hear each work (literally) uttered from Chance's mouth, we know that they had first dibs before 'Forrest Gump'.  Shirley MacLaine and Peter Sellers show a diversity in their acting range that is genuine and refreshing.",3,Sweet Satire,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,1862,"['Peter', 'Sellers', 'Chance', 'learning', 'disabled', 'man', 'who', 'evicted', 'lawyers', 'landlord', 'estate', 'benefactor', 'dies', 'Simple', 'yet', 'dignified', 'only', 'recourse', 'leave', 'nothing', 'umbrella', 'suitcase', 'sparest', 'belongings', 'tough', 'neighborhoods', 'asking', 'people', 'food', 'place', 'stay', 'garden', 'minor', 'accident', 'where', 'limousine', 'up', 'leg', 'Passenger', 'Eve', 'Rand', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'so', 'taken', 'bring', 'hospital', 'Seeming', 'so', 'innocent', 'instead', 'estate', 'where', 'husband', 'tycoon', 'Ben', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'bedridden', 'blood', 'disease', 'often', 'associated', 'children', 'Knowing', 'nothing', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'television', 'own', 'gardening', 'skills', 'Chance', 'renamed', 'Chauncey', 'Gardener', 'own', 'conversational', 'mishaps', 'talks', 'seasons', 'gardening', 'growth', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'who', 'Ben', 'seeking', 'economic', 'advice', 'Once', 'able', 'impress', 'President', 'everyone', 'including', 'television', 'audience', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'profound', 'financial', 'advice', 'inside', 'man', 'meantime', 'Eve', 'infatuated', 'someone', 'whom', 'only', 'half', 'rejuvenate', 'life', 'older', 'sick', 'husband', 'rest', 'world', 'figure', 'out', 'identity', 'new', 'stellar', 'personality.', 'Being', 'so', 'sweet', 'cynical', 'edge', 'satire', 'Hardly', 'plausible', 'actors', 'script', 'do', 'well', 'enough', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'nevertheless', 'movie', 'quirky', 'innovative', 'time', 'Afterall', 'when', 'world', 'hear', 'work', 'literally', 'uttered', 'Chance', 'mouth', 'know', 'had', 'first', 'dibs', ""'Forrest"", 'Gump', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'show', 'diversity', 'acting', 'range', 'genuine', 'refreshing']",Being There VHS

257134,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301590740,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","There is something really special about `Being There'.  It is a sharply written film about the power of just being in the right place at the right time.  It reminded me of `Forrest Gump', just a good movie.  Yes, my loathing of `Forrest Gump' (which I've deemed `well done mediocrity') knows no bounds, but when I see a film like `Being There' is further cements my sentiments because it becomes clear that the idea or premise involving an unsuspecting simpleton making an unexpected difference on the world is a doable and certainly a moving idea that had rich promise.Peter Sellers, Jerzy Kosinski and Al Ashby pull that promise out and hand it to the audience in spades.`Being There' tells the story of a gardener named Chance.  Chance has been raised by a wealthy man all his life, tucked away in large home filled with dusty furniture and a bounty of television sets.  Chance has never left the home.  He has tended to the man's garden, clothed himself with the man's clothing (found in the attic) and loved on a schedule of television and prepared meals by the man's maid Louise.  On the film's outset, the old man dies and Chance is left homeless.  He doesn't understand the outside world, but by a stroke of luck he happens to have a run in with Eve, the wife of a wealthy stock broker, and he has found a new home just like that.  His demeanor and his nonsensical rambling about gardening and television is mistaken by men in power as insightful and profound and soon he has made an impact on the entire nation; completely unbeknownst to him.The ensemble is wonderful.  Peter Sellers completely owns this beautiful performance.  He doesn't resort to gimmicks that loaded down Hanks performance, but instead he finds so much genuineness in Chance.  You can feel the weight of everything completely escaping Chance as he takes it in in the only way he knows how.  Shirley MacLaine is also fantastic here, completely owning Eve in a way that plays off the subtle and injects a ferocity that feels so natural (where was her Oscar nomination?).  I really liked Melvyn Douglas, although his Oscar win was unnecessary (especially when you consider that both MacLaine and Sellers delivered finer turns).In the end, this film is just beautiful.  The depth of character development is incredible, and the religious allegory that swells in the films finale (talk about a simple trick that makes you reevaluate the entire film) makes for a film that is not only poignant and profound but timely and, well, timeless.",5,Take a bow...,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,2512,"['something', 'really', 'special', 'Being', 'sharply', 'written', 'film', 'power', 'just', 'being', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'reminded', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'just', 'good', 'movie', 'Yes', 'loathing', 'Forrest', 'Gump', ""'ve"", 'deemed', 'well', 'done', 'mediocrity', 'bounds', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'Being', 'further', 'cements', 'sentiments', 'clear', 'idea', 'premise', 'involving', 'unsuspecting', 'simpleton', 'making', 'unexpected', 'difference', 'world', 'doable', 'certainly', 'moving', 'idea', 'had', 'rich', 'promise.Peter', 'Sellers', 'Jerzy', 'Kosinski', 'Al', 'Ashby', 'pull', 'out', 'hand', 'audience', 'spades.', 'Being', 'story', 'gardener', 'named', 'Chance', 'Chance', 'been', 'raised', 'wealthy', 'man', 'life', 'tucked', 'away', 'large', 'home', 'filled', 'dusty', 'furniture', 'bounty', 'television', 'sets', 'Chance', 'never', 'left', 'home', 'tended', 'man', 'garden', 'clothed', 'man', 'clothing', 'found', 'attic', 'loved', 'schedule', 'television', 'prepared', 'meals', 'man', 'maid', 'Louise', 'film', 'outset', 'old', 'man', 'Chance', 'left', 'homeless', ""n't"", 'understand', 'outside', 'world', 'stroke', 'luck', 'have', 'run', 'Eve', 'wife', 'wealthy', 'stock', 'broker', 'found', 'new', 'home', 'just', 'demeanor', 'nonsensical', 'rambling', 'gardening', 'television', 'mistaken', 'men', 'power', 'insightful', 'profound', 'soon', 'made', 'impact', 'entire', 'nation', 'completely', 'him.The', 'ensemble', 'wonderful', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'completely', 'beautiful', 'performance', ""n't"", 'resort', 'gimmicks', 'loaded', 'down', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'instead', 'so', 'much', 'genuineness', 'Chance', 'can', 'feel', 'weight', 'everything', 'completely', 'escaping', 'Chance', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'also', 'fantastic', 'here', 'completely', 'owning', 'Eve', 'way', 'subtle', 'ferocity', 'so', 'natural', 'where', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'really', 'liked', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Oscar', 'win', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'MacLaine', 'Sellers', 'delivered', 'finer', 'turns', '.In', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'beautiful', 'depth', 'character', 'development', 'incredible', 'religious', 'allegory', 'films', 'finale', 'talk', 'simple', 'trick', 'reevaluate', 'entire', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'poignant', 'profound', 'timely', 'well', 'timeless']",Being There VHS

No, I am not a fan of Peter Sellers and I am hardly familiar with his works in the industry, but it was his presence throughout the film that made me just sit and stare at the screen. Mr Sellers as 'Chance' can be described as a plain human being, just like you or me and how he can inspire the world with just a simple statement. Fabulous performances from Melvyn Douglas and Shirley Mclaine, the two support Peter Sellers into making this film a priceless gem in the history of cinema.

257138,ALR35EFI69S5R,6301590740,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[54, 70]","I recently read a review by a young movie critic who had the honesty to admit being baffled by the final scene in Peter Seller's celebrated last movie, ""Being There"". In this scene Sellers' character Chauncy Gardener  strays away from the funeral party to walk in the woods of the estate he  may inherit based on the wishes of his dying benefactor's and the prurient  interest the benefactor's new widow has in Chauncy. He blithely strolls  across the surface of a pond like a squire surveying his acreage, stopping  to stab his umbrella into the depths. We're astonished, of course, when his  `brolly' disappears up to its handle.This, of course, implies Chauncy  is walking on water. Is this intended as a biblical reference?  I think  not. More likely, it's the director's way of visually depicting the same  surreal theme he has been developing throughout the movie: All things are  possible to one whose own perceptions and understanding is so retarded and  child-like as to believe in both everything and nothing at once. The viewer  understands from the movie Chauncy is no one spectacular, a bit retarded  intellectually, totally naive, without any formidable experience or  understanding in the outside world. It is precisely this lack of merit, his  obtuseness, which makes him the perfect foil for everyone he comes into  contact with. The others lay their own biased perceptions, understandings,  and imaginings onto him, so he is seen as being everything they  superficially suppose him to be based on his outward appearance; his suit,  his visage, and his mannerisms. He who they see as everything is in  actuality nothing. Nothing but the perfect fool.He succeeds not because  of his native ability, but because he has none.  He rises to prominence  because our culture has become so artificial, so intellectually bankrupt,  and so superficial that all anyone around him relates to is his image, his  superficial appearance, his innocent charm and lack of self-consciousness.  He's a chameleon, the &quot;tabula rasa&quot; they then write the script  for. To the dying billionaire industrialist, he's a caring friend, to his  wife an erotic tease, to the President, a witty raconteur. When the other  characters in the movie overlay their own human foibles and shortcomings  into the equation of interacting with him, superimposing their own  corrupted values and ideas onto Chauncy's blithe but transparently idiotic  behavior, his nonsensical utterances become transformed into clever  witticisms, witty, thoughtful and politically adept observations. He is  &quot;everyman&quot; precisely because he is no one.When people no  longer ground their perceptions, actions or behaviors on reliable,  objective and well-educated abilities to decipher and determine the truth,  when they abandon the laws of gravity and chance, they enter into a  cultural purgatory bounded chiefly by their own ignorance. They travel at  their own peril through a strange and quite unpredictable world filled with  artifice and illusion. Such a description also fits the way the world is  depicted in the stylized fantasies and superficial plot lines of many  mainstream movies, videos and TV.Unfortunately, the consequence of a  steady diet of such palpable nonsense is nothing to laugh about. The use of  such superficial and stylized models as guidelines for operating in the  real world is becoming much more common. Indeed, we're living in a culture  virtually transfixed by simple surface impressions of what things appear to  be rather than with what they actually are. Like Chauncy, we walk blithely  on the surface of our world, never bothering to look at the dangers in the  depths below. Unlike our fearless celluloid hero, though, we cannot  necessarily evade the dangers of an incredibly complex and increasingly  disintegrating contemporary society by merely ignoring them.At the  surface all shades of subtlety are muted and lost; the rich panoply of  shades, colors and hues characteristic of a complex world are stylized into  simple pastel monochromes, representing a gauze-filtered replica of a world  that's unclear, indistinct, and out of focus. This loss of clarity about  the nature of the world and its basic reality leads inevitably to dangerous  over-simplifications of complicated realities.We would do well to  remember that ours is a complex, multilayered world; forgetting this fact  is a well-documented recipe for social, economic, and political disaster.  As George Santayana warned us long ago, ""Those who cannot remember the past  are condemned to repeat it"". We must remember that sometimes things are  profoundly different from the way they appear, that appearances may often  deceive and mislead even the best trained and the most sophisticated eye.  We must recognize  these negative social forces for what they really are;  arbitrary, indifferent, irrational, and profoundly anti-human. Mistaking  them for anything less (or more) could be a truly fatal mistake. Perhaps  Sellers was trying to tell us something......",5,Peter Seller's Parting Shot At Greatness Fulfilled,958694400,"05 19, 2000",2000,5051,"['recently', 'read', 'review', 'young', 'movie',

As someone once said &#34;you don't need to know anything to have an opinion&#34;. Like John Wayne in &#34;The Shootist &#34; I feel Peter Sellers somehow knew this was to be his final film even if only subconsciously. Now, the final scene where Peter walks on water. I am of two minds about this. First, Peter is a godlike being having a giant cosmic joke on everyone, enjoying immensely the mortals reading profound meaning into his inane pronouncements about gardening. Thus the slight smile after he pushes his umbrella into the water to show he really is walking on water.Second, he really is as stupid as his black house keeper says. Ergo he can walk on water because he's too stupid to know he can't do it.As Yoda told Luke &#34;Don't try - Do or Do Not, that is why you fail. He was commenting on the total belief and commitment you need to do a seemingly impossible task. If only it was this easy for most of us to shed the mental garbage that holds us back from becoming what we could be.Of all sad words of tongue and pen - the saddest of these &#34;It might have been&#34;.This movie is a wonderful comment on how perception of reality is clouded by ones preconceived notions of what reality is. If Aliens landed in Central Park before the military could clamp down on the media boy I'd like to see that.

Peter Sellers gives the performance of a lifetime as Chance the gardener, a low-key performance that is essential to the film's purpose,  and Sellers doesn't fumble for a second. Also with an excellent supporting  cast, Shirley MacLaine and Jack Warden are excellent but Melvyn Douglas is  the one who delivers an excellent performance as the millionaire who takes  Chance in and presents him to the most powerful people in the country. The  film starts out as Chance's employer dies, the film insinuates but never  really affirms that he might be his father, it also tries to insinuate that  he might be God, by making him walk on water near the end. Then he meets  Shirley MacLaine by chance and his bumbling gardening ignorance is  misinterpreted as quiet wisdom and he is soon influencing the most powerful  people in the country, to the point where he is considered to be a  presidential candidate. The plot itself is a satire on the modern media and  the effect of constant bombardment of television and radio. A unique  comedy, that is treasured because of it's one-of-a-kind plot, calculated  performances and low-key tone of comedy that has it's hilarious moments of  humor and it's quiet moments of cleverness.

But more importantly, this is one of the best films of the past thirty years, with a flawless performance by the late great Peter Sellers as Chance the gardener, an elegant, polite gentleman who woos the elite in Washington, all of them blind to the fact that poor Chance is a sheltered simpleton who looks good on camera but hasn't the foggiest clue what's going on around him. He likes to watch tv. That's about it. Out on the streets for the first time in his fiftysomething years, he encounters a gang of hoodlums and tries to turn them off with the remote control he took from the house he was forced to vacate.

At first, the performance seems to be self-consciously tongue-in-cheeck.  Sellers' character (Chauncey) seems to smirk as he delivers his lines.  But as the movie drags on, the character never emerges from what seems to be an act he puts on.  Are we to believe that this character really doesn't know any better?  The character as written in the script is simply implausible.  The reactions by the other characters are totally unrealistic, too.  The situations are ridiculous.  That's okay for a screwball comedy, but this film wants to have a serious side.  Unfortunately, gardening metaphors aren't that novel or compelling, and neither is this bore of a movie. I normally like movies about eccentric, perplexing introverts, but this one, though sprinkled with amusing moments, just isn't credible as a story.  I especially loathe the absurdist ending, which has Chauncey performing a supernatural feat.

257146,A3KFIMCP87VH4U,6301590740,BookMan,"[3, 4]","It's been nearly three decades (ugh!) since I saw this film in the theater and always remembered it as being one of the great movies of all time - intelligent, witty, satirical, and thought-provoking. Sadly, I hadn't had a chance (no pun intended) to see it since and, while browsing for something to watch that would transport me to another place (something that all good movies should do), I remembered ""Being There."" To my great delight, I was surprised to find a copy.Needless to say, I was absolutely thrilled with my decision to buy this movie. The wit and humor remain as powerful today as it was when the movie was first shown. The only part that seemed ""dated"" where the 70's clothes and styles but that only ads to the movie's ""character.""Granted, the movie may appear ""slow"" to some but, like a good piece of music, every moment needs to be savored in order to fully appreciate every nuance of the magnificent script and brilliant performance of each actor; without question, this was Peter Sellers' finest performance, Shirley McLaine was magnificent, Melvyn Douglas was brilliant, and Richard Dysart was superlative.The film is fraught with all kinds of unanswered (but intriguing) questions which leave intelligent audiences with countless topics for discussion. For example, just who (or what) was Chauncey Gardner? Other reviews (rather disturbingly) refer to Sellers' character as ""learning disabled,"" ""retarded,"" a ""simpleton,"" and other epithets and yet, other than the hilarious comments by the maid that Gardner ""has no brains at all. Stuffed with rice pudding between the ears. Short-changed by the Lord and dumb as a jackass"" we really don't know why he led such a bizarrely sheltered life that centered on his need to watch TV and his childlike behavior that exuded strength and confidence to so many others. Why was ""Chancy"" left alone? By whom? Why did the maid leave Chauncey after having taken care of him for so many years?Of course, that's all part of the mystery that makes this such a sublime masterpiece - there are a lot of questions for which answers are not needed in order for the genius of this film to succeed. People will continue to debate the mysteries of the film including such things as who stated """"I understand"" at the death bed of one of the characters, or the meaning of very last scene, forever. Obviously, there are no real answers to these and trying to answer them is simply futile. I would strongly suspect that that was exactly what this film was trying to accomplish - to get people to argue over something that really doesn't exist (or doesn't matter) - while, at the same time, ignoring more important issues. The real brilliance of the movie; however, is found with the amount of satire - almost nothing is sacred in this movie if one has that courage to really take a good look at exactly what is being said. Every word (especially those uttered by Sellers) is spoken with precisely the right amount of meaning, nuance, and inflection required. Some may feel that this movie is ""slow"" but the slothfulness of the main character and his careful, yet simplistic, dialog with others (in contrast to the constant cacophony of a blaring TV which he surrounds himself with), is precisely what makes this movie so great.",5,Subtle and Sublime Masterpiece!,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,3273,"['been', 'nearly', 'three', 'decades', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'always', 'remembered', 'being', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'time', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'satirical', 'thought-provoking', 'Sadly', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'pun', 'intended', 'see', 'browsing', 'something', 'watch', 'would', 'transport', 'place', 'something', 'good', 'movies', 'should', 'do', 'remembered', 'Being', 'great', 'delight', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'copy.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'absolutely', 'thrilled', 'decision', 'buy', 'movie', 'wit', 'humor', 'remain', 'powerful', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'only', 'part', 'seemed', 'dated', 'where', '70', 'clothes', 'styles', 'only', 'ads', 'movie', 'character', 'Granted', 'movie', 'may', 'appear', 'slow', 'good', 'piece', 'music', 'moment', 'be', 'savored', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'nuance', 'magnificent', 'script', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'actor', 'question', 'was', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'finest', 'performance', 'Shirley', 'McLaine', 'was', 'magnificent', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Richard', 'Dysart', 'was', 'superlative.The', 'film', 'fraught', 'kinds', 'unanswered', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'leave', 'intelligent', 'audiences', 'countless', 'topics', 'discussion', 'example', 'just', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'Chauncey', 'Gardner', 'Other', 'reviews', 'rather', 'disturbingly', 'refer', 'Sellers', 'character', 'learning', 'disabled', 'retarded', 'simpleton', 'other', 'epithets', 'yet', 'other', 'hilarious', 'comments', 'maid', 'Gardner', 'brains', 'Stuffed', 'rice', 'pudding', 'ears', 'Short-changed', 'Lord', 'dumb', 'jackass', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'led', 'bizarrely', 'sheltered', 'life', 'centered', 'need', 'watch', 'TV', 'childlike', 'behavior', 'exuded', 'strength', 'confidence', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'Why', 'was', 'Chancy', 'left', 'alone', 'whom', 'Why', 'did', 'maid', 'leave', 'Chauncey', 'having', 'taken', 'care', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'course', 'part', 'mystery', 'such', 'sublime', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'lot', 'questions', 'answers', 'are', 'not', 'needed', 'order', 'genius', 'film', 'succeed', 'People', 'will', 'continue', 'debate', 'mysteries', 'film', 'including', 'such', 'things', 'who', 'stated', 'understand', 'death', 'bed', 'one', 'characters', 'meaning', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'forever', 'Obviously', 'are', 'real', 'answers', 'trying', 'answer', 'simply', 'futile', 'would', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'get', 'people', 'argue', 'something', 'really', ""n't"", 'exist', ""n't"", 'matter', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'ignoring', 'more', 'important', 'issues', 'real', 'brilliance', 'movie', 'however', 'found', 'amount', 'satire', 'almost', 'nothing', 'sacred', 'movie', 'one', 'courage', 'really', 'take', 'good', 'look', 'exactly', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'Every', 'word', 'especially', 'uttered', 'Sellers', 'spoken', 'precisely', 'right', 'amount', 'meaning', 'nuance', 'inflection', 'required', 'may', 'feel', 'movie', 'slow', 'slothfulness', 'main', 'character', 'careful', 'yet', 'simplistic', 'dialog', 'others', 'contrast', 'constant', 'cacophony', 'blaring', 'TV', 'precisely', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'great']",Being There VHS

257148,A2CZPM110DW516,6301590740,"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks""","[3, 4]","Peter Sellers' final film role came in 1980's disastrous ""The Fiendish Plot of Fu Manchu,"" but I suspect he would have preferred to be remembered for the previous year's ""Being There,"" for which he earned his second Oscar nomination. The role of Chauncey Gardiner didn't win him that prize (Dustin Hoffman was cited for ""Kramer vs Kramer""), but he was voted best actor by the National Board of Review and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (in the musical/comedy category).Chauncey, a.k.a. Chance, was the brainchild of Jerzy Kosinski whose novel found a passionate fan in Sellers. At the time of the book's publication, neither Sellers nor the author had the clout necessary to get a film made (Sellers' career was sliding downhill by 1968 and wouldn't recover until 1975's ""The Return of the Pink Panther""), but they promised each other that whoever got ""hot"" first would set the project in motion. By 1979, both had their share of clout and the film was a hit with both critics and the public.Chance the gardener is a slow-witted, mildly retarded man who has spent his life in a rich man's house, tending the garden and watching television, his only source of knowledge. When his benefactor dies, Chance is expelled from his Garden of Eden and left to wander the streets of Washington D.C. where he is struck and mildly injured by a limousine belonging to one of the country's most powerful financiers. Guilt stricken, the financier's wife (Shirley Maclaine) takes him home where his innocent words about gardening impress her influential husband (Melvyn Douglas) as brilliant, symbolic pearls of wisdom. Before long, the president of the U.S. (Jack Warden) is quoting the gardener who becomes a media sensation.Whether Winston Groom, the author of ""Forrest Gump,"" read Kosinski's novel or saw the film it inspired is unclear, but there are similarities. But ""Being There"" has a darker, more cynical edge, and is the superior film. It lambasts the shallow times in which we live as effectively as Paddy Chayefsky's earlier ""Network,"" but explores it from a different angle and avoids being a shadow of any film that came before.

They sure were not in any of the audiences I was with, as everyone with me was absolutely broken up laughing.  So many of the people involved in &quot;Being There&quot; have been dead for awhile, including Peter Sellers, the star, Melvyn Douglas, the costar, Hal Ashby, the director, and I believe the writer as well.  For every single one of these people, &quot;Being There&quot; stands as one of their final works and also their best.  But the key was Peter Sellers, who was wildly uneven in his total body of work but 100% &quot;on&quot; for this movie. That he had to play it straight for virtually the entire movie too is further credit to his ample comedic talents.  Outtakes shown at film's end include his breaking into laughter while delivering some of his memorable lines, which ruined those takes. So even he wasn't immune from the comedy of his character, Chauncy Gardener.  The reality of casting though was that there wasn't anyone but Sellers capable of playing this role whereas the other roles could have been cast with others. Chauncy Gardener takes his name from his sole occupation during life, tending a garden in a Washington DC home for a man who sheltered him all of his life because he was mentally slow or &quot;challenged,&quot; in the vernacular of today.  When his guardian dies, Chauncy &quot;Chance,&quot; takes to the streets of DC and ends up in the hands of Douglas and his wife (Shirely McLaine), who are key players in the Washington DC political scene.  Douglas adores Chauncy and takes all of his statements about his gardening as political statements and soon has all of Washington, including right up to the President himself, listening to Chauncy's advice.  The President is hilariously played by Jack Ward.  McLaine's character meanwhile is busy falling in love with Chauncy, putting all sorts of sexual innuendo implications into his lengthy silences while he is watching tv. He is literally addicted to tv whereas she interprets his addiction as his being &quot;hard to get&quot; and the &quot;strong, silent&quot; type. This acts on her libido like a Spanish fly.  (I can't imagine that there is a woman alive who can't relate to her reading too much into him.)  At one point in the film, Chauncy gets to literally walk on water. Since he's pulled off everything but that prior to his doing so, it now seems natural that he can walk on water too!

This occurs principally via the vulnerabilities and loneliness of those around him, but occassionally on account of the silliness that accompanies arrogance and pomp.  Kosinski's scathing indictment of television, journalism, politics, consumerism, and power is fun to watch as social commentary; the humorous treatment of the daily lunacies in our lives accounts for the film's now iconic stature.  But it is a slowly paced story, about moments, and momentariness.  How the film fills those moments is critical.  And it is Sellers' performance as the half-wit who wins over hearts, while inadvertently disguising his true mental capacity, which is the film's emotional life blood that fills those moments brilliantly.  Film-making lore says Sellers lobbied hard for the role, feeling he had one more great character to introduce to the world.  Whether people actually feel such looming deadlines is a matter of debate.  But Sellers knew he was a sick man and had already suffered a number of heart attacks.  So much has been written about his performance that it's easy to forget that there is no Chauncey Gardiner without all of the people around him who create the character he becomes, leaving the cast's ensemble performance a keen requirement for the story's success.  Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine Being There without Peter Sellers.  The way the celebrity of an under achiever is launched via his ""natural"" way and our gullibility foresaw a more recent real-life rising political celebrity and her own ""folksy"" way.  As the protagonist's name implies however, Being There may be nothing more than a story about chance.  Nevertheless, whether it is Kosinski's characters, Deschanel's cinematography, Sellers' performance, or the intersection of all these things, there's a charm about Being There that casts a spell which stays on the viewer for a long time to come.",5,Caught in Sellers' Spell,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,2048,"['Sellers', 'spot', 'humble', 'amusing', 'simple-minded', 'Chance', 'who', 'circumstances', 'not', 'own', 'doing', 'up', 'woven', 'lives', 'rich', 'powerful', 'principally', 'vulnerabilities', 'loneliness', 'occassionally', 'account', 'silliness', 'arrogance', 'pomp', 'Kosinski', 'scathing', 'indictment', 'television', 'journalism', 'politics', 'consumerism', 'power', 'fun', 'watch', 'social', 'commentary', 'humorous', 'treatment', 'daily', 'lunacies', 'lives', 'accounts', 'film', 'now', 'iconic', 'stature', 'slowly', 'paced', 'story', 'moments', 'momentariness', 'How', 'film', 'fills', 'moments', 'critical', 'Sellers', 'performance', 'half-wit', 'who', 'hearts', 'inadvertently', 'disguising', 'true', 'mental', 'capacity', 'film', 'emotional', 'life', 'blood', 'moments', 'brilliantly', 'Film-making', 'lore', 'Sellers', 'lobbied', 'hard', 'role', 'feeling', 'had', 'one', 'more', 'great', 'character', 'introduce', 'world', 'people', 'actually', 'feel', 'such', 'looming', 'deadlines', 'matter', 'debate', 'Sellers', 'knew', 'was', 'sick', 'man', 'had', 'already', 'suffered', 'number', 'heart', 'attacks', 'So', 'much', 'been', 'written', 'performance', 'easy', 'forget', 'Chauncey', 'Gardiner', 'people', 'who', 'create', 'character', 'leaving', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'keen', 'requirement', 'story', 'success', 'Nevertheless', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Being', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'way', 'celebrity', 'achiever', 'launched', 'natural', 'way', 'gullibility', 'foresaw', 'more', 'recent', 'real-life', 'rising', 'political', 'celebrity', 'own', 'folksy', 'way', 'protagonist', 'name', 'however', 'Being', 'may', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'story', 'chance', 'Nevertheless', 'Kosinski', 'characters', 'Deschanel', 'cinematography', 'Sellers', 'performance', 'intersection', 'things', 'charm', 'Being', 'spell', 'viewer', 'long', 'time', 'come']",Being There VHS

When this film was released the misinterpretation of the language used by the protagonist ""Chance the Gardener"" seemed to paralleled the next President's use of language in my opinion. While Ronald Reagan was running for president his language just had to be misinterpreted. During his debate with Jimmy Carter he was asked what he would do to quell the racial tensions in America and Regan confidently said ""In my world there is no racial problem"" & everyone applauded interpreting what was said as that Reagan would create a utopian world free of racial prejudiced. What I believe he was actually saying was -In my world I am sheltered from poverty and I live in world of jelly beans and limousines. This is why I compared the film with Reaganomics. Being there features Peter sellers as a man who repeatedly said ""I like to watch"" which may as well have been ""I don't recall"" which Regan repeatedly said under oath during the Iran Contra Trials. Being There"" seems to parallel how limited use of language can have a misinterpretation in the most ironic consequences.

Unable to offer more to a conversation than a few remarks about gardening, Chance ends up being a rising political star, as his interlocutors (and eventually the American public) treat him as the mirror of their own opinions.All in all, I found BEING THERE an enjoyable film but no unmissable classic. The cinematography isn't memorable, and there are two exceedingly lame scenes of sexual humour.

The qualities of the film are projected, they are mere opinion, they are not intrinsic to the film and I think the author of the book/screeplay knew this and has the last laugh for what I believe is the point of the whole film (and here I am projecting too) is summed up in the final words 'Life.....is a state of mind'.

257163,AGHJ9BMVMGIOL,6301590740,colinwoodward,"[1, 5]","As with its title character (Chance the Gardener or ""Chauncey Gardner"" as he's mistakenly called), I found Being There amiable, but slow. The movie did evoke some chuckles from me, but I didn't find myself laughing that hard and it's pace was too slow for my tastes. Granted, it's not a joke-filled movie. The humor comes from the characters, not one-liners. The plot: a men with the mind of a child is left to his own devices after his rich but reclusive caretaker dies. After being accidentally hit by a car belonging to a wealthy woman, he is taken in and soon has access to the rich and famous. Everyone loves Chancey's innocent, simple, good cheer. They mistake his innocent words as great wisdom. The largest problem I had with it was the premise, which I found very hard to believe. Only one person in the movie is on to Chauncey from the beginning, but doesn't say anything so as to not rock the boat. But other events are hard to believe. First of all, would lawyers evict a man from a home even though he is clearly not competent to live on his own? Could a middle-aged man--retarded or not--never have been taken outside the place he lives?  How could there be no paper trail detailing Chancey's existence? Could a ""slow"" person like Chauncey really get access to the president within a day of leaving his home? And would people really seriously consider him for becoming president himself? My answer to these questions is no. But the movie must stretch our disbelief for the sake of its plot and to make a social/political statement about people liking mindless optimism. Unfortunately, the movie says nothing new. It's a cynical belief that the people in power are dumber than those they lead and that politics is about choosing the most inoffensvie candidate possible. There's some truth in these views, but I believe the opposite. I think politicans are shrewd people who are forced to pander and oversimplify in order to get anything done. Some may see this movie as a great statement about how personality matters in politics. But Chauncey is the kind of guy who wouldn't last two seconds in the slice em and dice em world of American politics.",3,"Slow, but amiable",1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,2161,"['title', 'character', 'Chance', 'Gardener', 'Chauncey', 'Gardner', 'mistakenly', 'called', 'found', 'Being', 'amiable', 'slow', 'movie', 'did', 'evoke', 'chuckles', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'laughing', 'hard', 'pace', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'tastes', 'Granted', 'not', 'joke-filled', 'movie', 'humor', 'characters', 'not', 'one-liners', 'plot', 'men', 'mind', 'child', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'rich', 'reclusive', 'caretaker', 'dies', 'being', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'car', 'belonging', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'taken', 'soon', 'access', 'rich', 'famous', 'Everyone', 'Chancey', 'innocent', 'simple', 'good', 'cheer', 'mistake', 'innocent', 'words', 'great', 'wisdom', 'largest', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'premise', 'found', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'Only', 'one', 'person', 'movie', 'Chauncey', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'so', 'not', 'rock', 'boat', 'other', 'events', 'are', 'hard', 'believe', 'First', 'would', 'lawyers', 'evict', 'man', 'home', 'even', 'clearly', 'not', 'competent', 'live', 'own', 'Could', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'retarded', 'not', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'place', 'How', 'could', 'there', 'be', 'paper', 'trail', 'detailing', 'Chancey', 'existence', 'Could', 'slow', 'person', 'Chauncey', 'really', 'get', 'access', 'president', 'day', 'leaving', 'home', 'would', 'people', 'really', 'seriously', 'consider', 'becoming', 'president', 'answer', 'questions', 'movie', 'must', 'stretch', 'disbelief', 'sake', 'plot', 'make', 'social/political', 'statement', 'people', 'liking', 'mindless', 'optimism', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'nothing', 'new', 'cynical', 'belief', 'people', 'power', 'are', 'dumber', 'lead', 'politics', 'choosing', 'most', 'inoffensvie', 'candidate', 'possible', 'truth', 'views', 'believe', 'opposite', 'think', 'politicans', 'are', 'shrewd', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'pander', 'oversimplify', 'order', 'get', 'anything', 'done', 'may', 'see', 'movie', 'great', 'statement', 'how', 'personality', 'matters', 'politics', 'Chauncey', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', 'two', 'seconds', 'slice', 'em', 'dice', 'em', 'world', 'American', 'politics']",Being There VHS

I remember hearing about it when it first came out but I just never got around to watching it.  Recently I was reading Shirley Maclaine's book ""Out On A Limb"" and there were several pages regarding Peter Sellars and some extraordinary spiritual experiences he had shared with her during the filming of this movie. That intrigued me enough to want to watch it.The character played by Peter Sellars, ""Chauncey (Chance) Gardiner"", is a man who is more like a child. He can't read or write but learns most of what he knows from watching T.V. He is childlike in the best sense, in the way a Zen master would be. Totally present and innocent.Thru strange circumstance he ends up living in a mansion owned by a dying and good hearted industrialist who becomes enamored with  Chauncey's ""realness"" and takes him in. Not only that Chauncey ends up somehow in a position where people from the President of the United States and others are influenced by his innocent wisdom. Shirley Maclaine as the wife of this industrialist also falls under the spell of this innocent Gardiner (without any effort from him).This movie is just one that you have to watch to really appreciate it, there's no way I can do justice to this masterpiece in words. It is so well written, acted and produced that you just have to experience it.Peter Sellars IS Chauncey Gardiner, he is brilliant. Shirley Maclaine and the rest of the cast are right up there with him, they truly became their characters.This movie is very subtle and strange so you have to just flow with it.

257169,A23DFB8IUTIZM0,6301590740,Dan Sherman,"[14, 16]","This film came out in 1979 and seems to get better every year.  It is the bizarre story of a blank slate of a gardner who literally has never been outside of the walls of a single house until he is in his 40s or 50s.  The entire view of this man comes from watching television.The basic story is quite simple. As Chance the gardner is forced to leave the house he has lived in as a child, he is hit by a limosine transporting the wife of a dying plutocrat.  Taken to the home of the plutocrat, he eventually meets the rich and powerful of the land (the president included)and is taken to be an oracle of wisdom with his simple statements about gardening and the television he has watched. It is a great satire that just keeps getting better as we rely more and more on soundbites for our information.The best part of the film is Peter Sellers who plays this absolutely blank, innocent, and slow-witted person with complete aplomb.  I remember an interview with Sellers when the movie came out, and he said it was a real struggle to develop an accent that had no roots at all -- a perfect blend of voices heard on television.  He plays the movie absolutely straight, the comedy being how people react so seriously to his child-like comments.  For example, in a television interview about the economy, people take his comments that &quot;there is always growth in the spring&quot; to mean an end to a recession when he is simply talking about his garden.This is a unique film with lots and lots of subtle humor (no slapstick ala Clouseau). There are some very funny moments as people react to Peter Sellers, but the humor always comes back to how we choose to see the world. There is no deception of the part of the character of the gardner -- it is everybody else who plays the fool here.This is a definitely a movie to own and to watch over and over. I know some people who have found it a bit slow, in that very little really happens -- it is almost a comedy of manners. It is a great memorial to Peter Sellers from one of his very last movies.",5,Excellent  Satire - Incredible Acting from Peter Sellers,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,2045,"['film', 'came', 'out', '1979', 'get', 'better', 'year', 'bizarre', 'story', 'blank', 'slate', 'gardner', 'who', 'literally', 'never', 'been', 'walls', 'single', 'house', '40s', '50s', 'entire', 'view', 'man', 'watching', 'television.The', 'basic', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'Chance', 'gardner', 'forced', 'leave', 'house', 'lived', 'child', 'hit', 'limosine', 'transporting', 'wife', 'dying', 'plutocrat', 'Taken', 'home', 'plutocrat', 'eventually', 'rich', 'powerful', 'land', 'president', 'included', 'taken', 'be', 'oracle', 'wisdom', 'simple', 'statements', 'gardening', 'television', 'watched', 'great', 'satire', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'rely', 'more', 'more', 'soundbites', 'information.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'who', 'absolutely', 'blank', 'innocent', 'slow-witted', 'person', 'complete', 'aplomb', 'remember', 'interview', 'Sellers', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'said', 'was', 'real', 'struggle', 'develop', 'accent', 'had', 'roots', 'perfect', 'blend', 'voices', 'heard', 'television', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'straight', 'comedy', 'being', 'how', 'people', 'react', 'so', 'seriously', 'child-like', 'comments', 'example', 'television', 'interview', 'economy', 'people', 'take', 'comments', 'quot', 'always', 'growth', 'spring', 'quot', 'mean', 'end', 'recession', 'when', 'simply', 'talking', 'garden.This', 'unique', 'film', 'lots', 'lots', 'subtle', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'ala', 'Clouseau', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'people', 'react', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'humor', 'always', 'back', 'how', 'choose', 'see', 'world', 'deception', 'part', 'character', 'gardner', 'everybody', 'else', 'who', 'fool', 'here.This', 'definitely', 'movie', 'own', 'watch', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'bit', 'slow', 'very', 'little', 'really', 'almost', 'comedy', 'manners', 'great', 'memorial', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'one', 'very', 'last', 'movies']",Being There VHS

""Dr. Strangelove"" may have been Sellers' finest film but his work here as Chance the gardener is his most challenging role.  I've seen this film a number of times over the years and the most common perception of Chance is that he is a stupid man.  Upon further viewing I'm not so sure that Chance is unintelligent but a man sheltered from life's harsh realities and forcefed an alternate reality of banal television.  I think Sellers understood this distinction and from that he taps into the pathos of Chance and gains the audience's sympathy.  I used to take a harsh view of Chance's wealthy patron's, the Rands(Shirley MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas) as ignorant dupes.  On further review these are lonely people whose high station in life has isolated them from the larger society from all but the sycophants and yes-men.  So what if Chance's banal allusions to gardening is misinterpreted as something profound?  If their interpretation brings joy to their otherwise depressing lives then so be it.  I also do not take as harsh a view of the public at large who like the Rands have also misinterpreted Chance's non-profundities.  From my understanding the intention of author Jerzy Kosinski was to satirize the television generation and that Kosinski was a bit contemptuous of Chance.

Knouse,"[5, 6]","If ""Dr. Strangelove"" was a Peter Sellers showcase for his wide-ranging talents as both an actor and comedian, then his performance in ""Being There"" is a magnificent contrast of reserved genius.  The rest of the cast in this film ranges from good to passable, but Peter Sellers is the reason to own this strangely captivating film.  He plays a feeble-minded gardener whose only experience in the outside world has been through watching hours of television.  His elderly guardian dies and he is then cast out into the ""real"" world with only his clothing, his umbrella and hat...and his channel-changer.  He begins a surreal journey that eventually leads him to another wealthy, elderly gentleman who eventually considers Chauncy Gardner (Peter Sellers) a good friend and confidant.  This wealthy gentleman has links to the Presidency, as well, and what follows is pure political satire.  Chauncy is considered a thoughtful political analyst, often unwittingly comparing the government to a garden in wintertime, and is thereby thrust into the limelight as a potential candidate for the Presidency.  The satire is intelligent and well-written, Peter Sellers carrying the film with an under-stated performance that garnered him yet another Oscar-nomination.  It is remarkable how many different characters Peter Sellers has portrayed.  His work in ""Being There"" is superb and the political satire laced throughout the script is dead-on.

In the past, when I thought of Peter Sellers (who plays lead character &quot;Chance the Gardener&quot;), my mind automatically went to Inspector Clouseau from the Pink Panther series.  I thought of the bumbling, clumsy and silly detective in hot persuit of the pink panther jewel.  What a terrific change of pace!  I really got a sense of Peter Sellers' depth as an actor in this brilliant film.  Sellers, Melvyn Douglas, and Shirley Maclaine were all strong leads in this story, along with a great supporting cast.BEING THERE tells the story of Chance, the Gardener, a simple man who spends his entire life gardening in the backyard of his boss' house, until one day the old man passes away.  When a couple of journalists come around to find out more about the former master of the house, Chance is the only one there.  The house must close, and for the first time the man must make strides into the big, wide world.  This world is like nothing he could have ever imagined outside of the house where he worked.  One thing that keeps him tranquil and holds his attention is the television.  As Chance says, &quot;I like to watch.&quot;  (this line is misinterpreted a few times during the course of the movie.) By chance, Chance meets up with Shirley Maclaine the wife of an elderly billionaire.  This is just the beginning of an intriguing series of events where Chance--renamed Chauncey Gardner--the simple man who speaks of plants and their growth (the only real knowledge he has about the world) becomes central as wise sage in one of the most intriguing political ventures.This film has moments of laugh-out-loud comedy, and serious elements as well.

""Being There"" is different, completely different. Here the universe is waiting for Peter Sellers in a rare, less-is-more performance where the theme could rightly be called, ""A Charmed Life.""

Peter Sellers is simply startling as a soft-spoken, well-dressed, gentleman's gardener who knows nothing more about the world than what he sees on TV.

Don't miss it.'BEING THERE' IS THE DEFINITIVE CHARACTER DRIVEN BLACK COMEDY - -Call it a black comedy, a cross-over film, a poltical satire, or anything you like. This film simply works as an example of the actors making the film with the help of excellent direction by Hal Ashby and an excellent adapted screenplay by the book's author Jerry Kosinski.

257187,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,6301590740,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[2, 4]","According to his biography, Peter Sellers had dreamed of playing the roll of Chance Gardner as far back as the early '70s, and would actually go around pretending to be him for years and years, gradually refining the role... by the time the film was shot, he was almost devestated when he was told he was too old, fortunately, however, the director came around to his way of thinking, and hence the realization of a novel with a character perhaps only a genius like Sellers could play - - Sellers portrays an emotionless dimwit savant gardner who grew up isolated on an estate without having ever seen the outside world beyond the garden he tended to and the images on TV with which he has a strange obsession with (he walks around with a remote control, turns on every TV he sees and mimics whatever he sees while watching with his face devoid of expression or emotion.)  - - When his wealthy benefactor dies, he is set out into the world for the first time at middle age.  Immaculately dressed in an expensive suit, umbrella and bowler hat, he wanders through the ghettoes of Washington D.C., his first views and strange encounter with the real world accompanied by the famous disco/funk version of Thus Spake Zarathrustrata (the theme from 2001 : A Space Odyssey.)  It becomes clear that he is convinced that he has actually stepped into the TV and has no ability survive in the absence of the maid who fed and cared for him all his life.  By happenstance, however, he winds up in the estate of a wealthy dying billionaire where his silence and simple minded utterences about ""the garden"", ""seasons"" and ""growth"" are believed to have deep meaning beyond their simplistic intentions.  A powerful black comedy, he serves as a reassuring mirror to the vain and powerful people who come to surround him as theyread their own interparatations into his simple utterences.  He comes to be mistaken as a deep thinking genius among the ruling elite in Washington, and eventually rises to the highest levels of power, even offering advice to the President - - in reality, though, he is seeking nothing more than to find a garden to work in.Though the film does not feature Seller's trademark madcap slapstick, it is clearly one of his best films.  Seller's does do some interesting physical routines (imitating in gesture whatever he sees on any TV set within vision even in the course of serious conversation), but in contrast to his other films, rather than creating madness and chaos in the world around them, the idiocy of his character is simply overlooked - - a metaphor of the blindness and stupidity of the powerful people surrounding him who are only capable of seeing what they want to see.All in all, if you're looking for Dr. Strangelove or Inspector Clouseau, you'll probably be let down (as many of the critics were when the film came out), however, if you're looking to see a brilliantly acted, brilliantly written and brilliantly directed cinematic masterpiece with a deep message, this will definitely be a film to remember.Now, my question is :  What's the strange TV cartoon with the kids playing basketball from ?

Lyman,"[5, 8]","Part Forrest Gump and part Life of Brian, part the fable of The Emperor Has No Clothes and part parody of the story of Christ, Being There leaves a lot of room for meaning in a simple, artful, and seamless script. And the acting is suburb: I consider it to be on par with Dr. Strangelove as Peter Sellers' finest film.Being There is a must-see for anyone who appreciates comic subtlety and dark humor.My favorite interpretation of the film is that of Mr. Sellers' character -- Chance the gardener, or, later, Chauncey Gardiner -- as a Christ-like figure. The film's magnificent ending supports that take, and subsequent viewings reveal more evidence earlier in the motion picture of Chance as a reluctant savior, an increasingly in vogue interpretation of the Biblical Christ.From a different view, I guess it's a stretch as a political metaphor. After all, who would believe that such a simple man with such a limited vocabulary and an inability to grasp even moderately complex issues could find a place in the public's political consciousness? Heh heh.But I think Mr. Sellers, who is best known as the bumbling and hapless Jacques Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies, would warn against taking his work too seriously. Maybe it's best to take the film as it is: a simple and understated story made great by one of the 20th century's acting geniuses.Regarding the DVD, the film quality is fine but the overall package is a little short on extras. I know that few DVDs of films more than 20 years old carry things like behind-the-scenes filming or director's commentary, but it would have been nice for the producers of the DVD to do a little more to take advantage of the medium besides including the original trailer.

257191,A92MWK7R10H6L,6301590740,Eric Williams,"[5, 19]","I can't see how so many people found this movie to be so great. I'm not trying to bash it or anything, I just can't understand it. The hallmark of a great movie is its ability to wrap you up in the plot, and suspend your disbelief long enough to make you feel as if what's happening in the movie is reality. Unfortunately, this movie does not accomplish that goal, although it most definitely wants to. The beginning scenes of Chance in the city are certainly realistic, especially his confrontation with the punks, since their reactions are certainly what one would expect. However, from this point on the film goes from cold realism to blissful fantasy without ever giving the viewer a chance to transition between the two. Chance is mistaken for the second coming by the rich elites, when in reality, their reactions to him should've been as apprehensive and suspicious as the punks were. This harsh transition from reality to fantasy is too quick and abrupt to afford any understanding by the viewer, and one is left with the recurrant, nagging feeling of ""oh come on"" throughout the rest of the movie. The film takes a disturbing turn at the end, when Ben is to be entombed in a pyramid with an all seeing eye atop (possibly an Illuminati reference?). Chance, completely oblivious to the machinations of the political puppetmasters (""Is America really a democratic Republic?"" is what's seemingly said here) simply walks away, and on water for that matter, just like he did in the beginning. Unfortunately the ending does nothing to clarify what was happening throughout the movie, and viewers are left with the infamous ""that's it?"" impression. This movie does contain a few humorous scenes, but nothing outright riotous, not even the masturbation scene involving Eve, which just comes across as sad and pathetic. One is tempted to analyze her pyschologically, given the fact that she has a tendency toward unfulfilling romantic relationships.

257195,ACVNA57PI4DLV,6301590740,Francois Tremblay,"[2, 5]","Being There is the story of Chance (Peter Sellers), a slightly retarded man who has been gardener all his life, and is only interested in television. When the house owner dies, Chance is forced to go out in the real world. One freak accident involving a television later, he enters the life of the Rand family. His dress and demeanour makes everyone believe him a patron of industry, and soon his mundane and rote gardening pronouncements are revered as profound statements.Being There is the story of a cypher who becomes popular because he appears to be powerful, and not despite but rather because of his pronouncements (such as &quot;I like to watch TV&quot;, perhaps the most wildly interpreted of Chance's statement in the entire movie). As such, it is mostly reactive : everyone bounces on Chance, his appearance and his pronouncements.There are many scenes to talk about : although it rarely deviates from its main theme (the wish-fulfillment of people who interpret banalities as profound, both politically and socially), this movie is very interesting philosophically. For instance, Also Sprach Zarathustra with modern rythms superimposed on it plays throughout Chance's first forays in the &quot;real world&quot;. Chance tries to &quot;turn off&quot; a gang member with his remote control, or enters a car for the first time. But the story doesn't dwell too much on Chance's inexperience : he doesn't know how things are supposed to feel, but he does know things from television.Being There is suppored by Peter Sellers' performance. It's not a hard role, but he plays it perfectly. The movie is about interpretation of the mundane and the limits of semantics, about our limited views of the world, and has often been interpreted as a shot against politics and &quot;a thinking man's Forrest Gump&quot;.Interestingly, one review I read compared Chance to the Buddha - he certainly sees the world through &quot;new eyes&quot;, and is perfectly at peace with himself. He is incapable of thinking far beyond what he can perceive, like most people, but that is due to his retardation, not his will - in that sense at least he has an excuse ! Indeed, it seems a strong analogy between Chance and the people around you can be drawn as well, and that is because Chance's retardation is shown clearly enough that it can withstand very interesting analogies. Should we consider mindlessness as a mental problem ?The story doesn't make everything tidy (for one thing, it doesn't clearly explains Chance's early life or his mental problem), and in that respect it provokes reflection in more than one aspect. Movies shouldn't explain everything or tie loose ends : that's boring. Being There is not only intellectually satisfying and interesting, but it's also not boring.Chance : &quot;In a garden, growth has its season... as long as the roots are not severed, all is well, and all will be well in the garden.&quot;",5,A thinking man's Forrest Gump,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,2917,"['Being', 'story', 'Chance', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'slightly', 'retarded', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'gardener', 'life', 'only', 'interested', 'television', 'When', 'house', 'owner', 'Chance', 'forced', 'go', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'One', 'freak', 'accident', 'involving', 'television', 'later', 'life', 'Rand', 'family', 'dress', 'demeanour', 'everyone', 'believe', 'patron', 'industry', 'soon', 'mundane', 'rote', 'gardening', 'pronouncements', 'are', 'revered', 'profound', 'statements.Being', 'story', 'cypher', 'who', 'popular', 'be', 'powerful', 'not', 'rather', 'pronouncements', 'such', 'like', 'watch', 'TV', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'most', 'wildly', 'interpreted', 'Chance', 'statement', 'entire', 'movie', 'such', 'mostly', 'reactive', 'everyone', 'bounces', 'Chance', 'appearance', 'pronouncements.There', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'talk', 'rarely', 'main', 'theme', 'wish-fulfillment', 'people', 'who', 'interpret', 'banalities', 'profound', 'politically', 'socially', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'philosophically', 'instance', 'Also', 'Sprach', 'Zarathustra', 'modern', 'rythms', 'superimposed', 'Chance', 'first', 'forays', 'quot', 'real', 'world', 'quot', 'Chance', 'quot', 'turn', 'off', 'quot', 'gang', 'member', 'remote', 'control', 'car', 'first', 'time', 'story', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'Chance', 'inexperience', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'know', 'things', 'television.Being', 'suppored', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'performance', 'not', 'hard', 'role', 'perfectly', 'movie', 'interpretation', 'mundane', 'limits', 'semantics', 'limited', 'views', 'world', 'often', 'been', 'interpreted', 'shot', 'politics', 'quot', 'thinking', 'man', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'quot', '.Interestingly', 'one', 'review', 'read', 'compared', 'Chance', 'Buddha', 'certainly', 'world', 'quot', 'new', 'eyes', 'quot', 'perfectly', 'peace', 'incapable', 'thinking', 'far', 'what', 'can', 'perceive', 'most', 'people', 'due', 'retardation', 'not', 'will', 'sense', 'least', 'excuse', 'Indeed', 'strong', 'analogy', 'Chance', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'drawn', 'as', 'well', 'Chance', 'retardation', 'shown', 'clearly', 'enough', 'can', 'withstand', 'very', 'interesting', 'analogies', 'Should', 'consider', 'mindlessness', 'mental', 'problem', 'story', ""n't"", 'make', 'everything', 'tidy', 'one', 'thing', ""n't"", 'clearly', 'Chance', 'early', 'life', 'mental', 'problem', 'respect', 'reflection', 'more', 'one', 'aspect', 'Movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'explain', 'everything', 'tie', 'loose', 'ends', 'boring', 'Being', 'not', 'only', 'intellectually', 'satisfying', 'interesting', 'also', 'not', 'boring.Chance', 'quot', 'garden', 'growth', 'season', 'as', 'long', 'roots', 'are', 'not', 'severed', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'garden.', 'quot']",Being There VHS

Unspoilt by intellect, education, or experience of society, Chance the Gardener has been raised in a protective environment where he main concern is for plants, other living things coming close to simple being, and for a mindless attentiveness to the television that washes over him like a halo, providing him with sufficient information to make others around him believe he is wise and knowledgeable.In the film we come upon Chance as 'the old man' has died, and the lawyers are coming in to close the house. As a man apart from society, there is no record of Chance even existing (which becomes important later). He is a mystery from the beginning, made all the more mysterious by his completely innocent, non-evasive manner. This is rare for Washington, D.C.!Having been turned out of the house, Chance begins his partial discovery of the real world. He experiences hatred, deprivation, and solitude for the first time, but all of this leaves little impact upon him. He continues his solitary journey until stopped by a store display of television sets, at which time he backs up to watch himself being displayed from the video camera, and is injured by a passing car belonging to Benjamin Rand, wealthy financier and kingmaker. Mrs. Rand is in the car (played astutely by Shirley MacLaine), and insists on taking Chance (who, while taking his first alcoholic drink, garbles the words to the degree that she mishears his name, becomes at this point Chauncey) back to the Rand estate, where doctors and nurses are in attendance at the sick-near-dying bed of her husband Benjamin.Chauncey floats effortlessly through this world. Without apprehension and without an image to protect and project, he is simply himself, and in so being, becomes a mirror to project the hopes of those around him. While he speaks in terms of gardening almost exclusively, others, from Mrs. Rand to the President of the United States (who ends up quoting him in a speech) believe he is a master of metaphor, and, much like a mystical text, are quick to assign their own meanings to his words.Because Chauncey is without affectation, well-mannered and, above all, a curious listener, people are charmed by him. The policeman outside the White House respond when he reports a sick tree in the park. The Russian ambassador responds when Chauncey laughs at his Russian jokes. The Rands respond because they both need, above all, hope. Chauncey becomes a cipher for all.Chance is a mystery. The President quotes him in a speech, after meeting him at the Rand estate. But who is he? The CIA and the FBI cannot find any information on him. Thus, both decide he must be an ex-agent who has 'wiped the slate clean'.Ultimately, it is unclear, purposefully so, if Chance is in fact mentally deficient or spiritually enhanced. The disturbing message of the film and novel is that even a little learning can be a soul-destroying force; ignorance is bliss, and enables one to walk on water when one doesn't know one can't.Will Chance succeed, by Chance? Will the Randian consortium in fact propel him into the Presidency? Would you, the viewer, want him as President?Filmed largely at the Biltmore Estate (pictured as if it were in the centre of the District of Columbia), this is a visually interesting film as well as an intriguing story, with superb acting performances and an ambiguous moral at the end.

The comedy? Political satire? The Drama? Gospel according Jerry, Hal and Peter? What is it about Chance the Gardner aka Chauncey Gardiner (Peter Sellers) simple minded, possibly retarded character that everyone admires so much?It is a prophetic film - how often we've seen individuals that have been elevated to high political office for simply looking good and smiling nice on television. It is a story of a man who was an embodiment of purity and child-like innocence of such high concentration that he could be called a retard - depending on your state of mind. Chance is always himself - he never pretends to be something other than a gardener. All he wants is to watch TV and work in a garden taking care of the plants and flowers. Having meals on time would not hurt, either. Whatever happened to Chance only happened because he was there - in the right time in the right place. But was it a right time and place for anybody? Was Chance the answer to the problems the country was going through? Of course, not. I agree with the comments that the society has the rulers it deserves - if we believe that Chance's messages are profound and deep, we very much deserve him as our leader. It is very sad film, I think. It has many hilarious scenes, jokes, and dialogs but it is not a comedy, and not a feel good movie. It is a sublime, intelligent meditation on very serious matters - politics and media and how they relate to each other; the great power of being there and projecting the image the public wants to admire and follow. How easy is it for us to be fooled, especially when we want to be fooled?Peter Sellers is magnificent. I don't think that anybody else could've done what he did with the character.

Simon ""Mr. Gfunk""","[3, 4]","While Dr. Strangelove is his best known performance and is arguably the funniest film ever made, Being There is Peter Sellers greatest perfomance.Based on the Kosinski novel, Sellers stars as Chance the gardener at the estate of ""the old man"" who dies just before the film starts. Forced into the world by the estate lawyers who come to settle the old man's affairs, Chance must learn to live in the world beyond the walls of his garden. A simple man, all he knows about life in the real world is based on what he has seen on television. All Chance's reactions and observations are what he thinks he should be saying based on what characters have said in similar situations. Since he has, basically, the social comprehension of a small boy, he dosn't really understand what he is saying. Through a series of remarkable coincidences (Chances) he comes to the home of one of the most powerful men in the country and is introduced to the President of the United States.Since Chance dosn't really understand the world he is thrust into, all he can do, again, is respond how he thinks he should. His simple honesty is viewed by those around him as subtle metaphor and his gardening advice becomes the cornerstone of the President's economic policy.An allegorical tale, this film was Sellers' dream. He had to fight hard to get it made and eventually succeded. A perfectly serious performance, Sellers finally got to do what he always wanted, to be himself, a scared, confused man cught up in a world that dosn't really get him, existing only as an idea in other peoples' minds.While the book is one of the greatest works of fiction of the twentieth century, Sellers' personal connection to and instant love of this character is truly remarkable and makes for one of the most bittersweet performances any actor has ever given.Think I'm being melodramatic?

I was wrong.  I just saw it again, and I am completely redoing my review.The 2nd time I saw this film, I saw and felt a poignant undercurrent to it.  There's poetry in it, and I'm not so sure that my first impression was correct.  Many saw the film (and still do) as a satire on American stupidity and our adoration of television.  Many compare (even myself) Chance (Peter Sellers's character) to George W. Bush.  It is a false comparison.  While Chance seems to be raised on TV, he also comes across almost as a ""holy fool"" (a term used in Russian literature), a person who is seen by many as an idiot but who is spiritually and morally strong.  Many who watch this film think he's an idiot, but there's something poignant, humanistic, and really childlike about the character, as if maybe he is a little more than just an idiot who made good.  Someone will tell me that I'm falling for Chance's ""folksy wisdom"", but I'm not.  I'm as jaded and as cynical as anyone.  There's a meditative quality about this film, a poetic quality that I don't believe was an accident.  Some have said that Sellers is a Christ like character (especially when he walks on water at the end), and others have said it just shows how stupid Chance is at the end by walking on water.

""Being There"" is different, completely different. Here the universe is waiting for Peter Sellers in a rare, less-is-more performance where the theme could rightly be called, ""A Charmed Life."" After all, how else could a seemingly-autistic person take on knife-wielding street-gangsters, political heavyweights, and romance with no more emotion than when he walked on water, stopped to check the depth of the water with his umbrella, and then simply continued.IN A NUTSHELL:""Being There"" is about the impossible being not only plausible, but completely accepted on face value.

257210,AOSIEAVE18JCA,6301590740,Hoyt Harris,"[5, 8]","BEING THERE was my first and last film. But what a film for a debut! While news anchoring at WLOS-TV in Asheville, N.C., I was cast by Hal Ashby himself to play Riff, head of the Secret Service detail that comes to the Biltmore House (stand-in for the Rand mansion in the movie) to ""case it"" before the U.S. president (Jack Warden) visits.  As the only TV anchor/reporter in the cast, I had a ""leg up"" in getting stories for my newscasts. When the casting director called to tell me to be at the Biltmore House the next morning at 6--""for wardrobe and make-up""--I didn't dare call my bosses at the TV station for fear they wouldn't let me do the movie. I was going to be in this film if it meant quitting my day job. And now, some 27 years later, how glad I am that I am in it, if only in a small speaking role. All I had hoped for was to be chosen to appear an an extra in the funeral scene (they were casting several dozen locals) and wound up cast as a ""day player"" with my own dressing room, for God's sake. The high point for me was doing a TV report on makeup legend Charlie Schram, who had been the head of MGM's make-up department during its golden years, making up the likes of a teen-age Judy Garland, Ava Gardner, Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West in the ""Wizard of OZ"", among actors in many now-classic films.

257213,A17JVI15BRY90P,6301590740,James T. Wheeler,"[51, 54]","""Being There"" is one of my favorite movies of all time, starring Peter Sellers in his last major film role.  How Sellers was cheated out of an Oscar is still a mystery to me, as this has to be one of the greatest performances by an actor in the last 40 years.  Maybe voters for the Academy Award weren't in the mood for a black comedy, which this show is, or maybe they didn't like its political overtones?  Or, maybe they just couldn't give such a serious award to someone who'd played Inspector Clouseau?  In any case, this movie was way before its time in style and substance; Academy voters missed the boat.  Among other things, they should have asked themselves if anyone else could have played this part so well?  Could anyone else have done the blank, languid stares so convincingly?  Could anyone else have delivered the dead-pan lines so flawlessly?  The answers would have been a resounding, No.The movie tells the story of a half-retarded gardener, Chance, whom one supposes is the illegitimate son of a prominent business man in Washington, D. C.  This occurs in 1979, when the Carter Administration was in its last stages of faded glory.  Chance, played by Peter Sellers, is left homeless when the old man dies.  He then wanders the streets of the big city in search of his new life.  Whatever he has learned has come from watching TV and he uses his remote control to change channels.  While roaming the streets of Washington, Chance even tries his clicker in real life situations, which is very funny.Chance then stumbles upon one of the main power brokers in D. C., a gravely-ill Ben Rand.  He is played by Melvyn Douglas who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this portrayal.  Rand's wife Eve, played by Shirley MacLane, falls for Chance and a tawdry affair (on her side) ensues.  Later on, Chance becomes a media sensation, of sorts, and appears on late-night TV to present his simplistic views.  They're all couched in terms of keeping a garden prosperous which rings a responsive chord with all concerned.  Almost everyone takes Chance for a modern day genius when he really is just the opposite.  Various private and government security agencies do research on Chance's background and can find nothing.  He wears expensive clothes and underwear, dating from the 1930's, that apparently are hand-me-downs from the old man.  It's as if Chance suddenly dropped out of the sky, which he practically has.At Mr. Rand's funeral, the surviving power brokers talk of making Chance the next U. S. President.  The closing scene shows Chance stepping out onto a lake appearing to walk on water.  Maybe this is to serve as final proof that he deserves the #1 job?  As far as I know, no one has ever explained the significance of the scene which is as it should be.  As with the best art, it's up to the viewer to decide its meaning.To me the movie shows the power of television and other forms of mass media in shaping the public mind.  Taken to the extreme, a total idiot might be foisted off on the public to hold the highest political office if only he has the right handlers and avoids any whiff of scandal.  The biting sarcasm and irony of ""Being There"" would not appeal to everyone's taste but most thinking adults should be captivated by the story and by Sellers' amazing performance.Before buying the DVD, I tried to find out either on websites or on the outside of the package, if the hilarious out-takes appear on this recording.  These were superimposed over the closing credits in the original version shown in theaters but often do not appear when the film is shown on TV.

His career more than likely gave Peter Sellers a profound understanding of acting, film making, and other business side details; making him a savvy individual with worthwhile mentoring skills.  I'm talking about the man, not a role he played.  Peter Sellers served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, rising to the rank of corporal.  His comic genius in the ""Pink Panther"" series of films has yet to be rivaled.  Peter Sellers had friendship ties with George Harrison and Ringo Starr of the Beatles notoriety, as well as Roman Polanski, Princess Margaret, and Sophia Loren.  Peter Sellers was the first man to appear on the cover of Playboy magazine (April 1964 with Karen Lynn), and purportedly socialized on at least one occasion to have tea with the Queen Mother at Clarence House.  Peter was married to Anne Howe, divorced, remarried to Britt Ekland, divorced, remarried to Miranda Quarry (now the Countess of Stockton), divorced, and remarried to Lynne Frederick.  He passed away in July of 1980, leaving behind an estate worth an estimated 4.5 million.Which brings us to the 1979 release of ""Being There"" which must have been very enjoyable for Peter Sellers to challenge himself in such a role as Chauncey Gardner, a simple, totally without education man who grew up on a humble estate and as servant there, and had never left the property throughout his lifetime.  All he knows about life is what he has seen on TV.  Now Chauncey Gardner is in his 60's, and the property owner dies, which means Peter Sellers's character has been evicted out onto the street with no place to go, no direction, no explanation, and totally clueless altogether about what happens next.  Supported by a cast such as Shirley MacLaine, Jack Warden, Richard Basehart, Richard Dysart, Melvyn Douglas, and others, ""Being There"" is a film based upon a book by the author Jerzy Kosinski, and two things stand out in the critical reviews of this film regarding Peter Sellers's performance.  Some say this film was the crowning triumph of his remarkable career, whereas others have said this film's fantastic black comedy premise would never have been as credible without Peter Sellers achieving a pinpoint sharp exactitude of nothingness.  Simply stated, the character of Chauncey Gardner is one of a helpless childlike simpleton, who accidentally ends up as advisor to the President of the United States.This is in my top 20 favorite movies of all time.  Peter Sellers surpassed my expectations in ""Being There"" and I can't recommend this movie highly enough for those who appreciate irony, satire, dark comedy, and understand the genius that is Peter Sellers.  It doesn't hurt that Shirley MacLaine is a high-society wife of a prominent rich business tycoon, and as the elderly tycoon's life is ebbing away (Melvyn Douglas), Shirley MacLaine's character (Eve)  is drawn emotionally and passionately to the character played by Peter Sellers - which ends up wonderfully because of misunderstandings and the two consummate professional actor/actress stars displaying a geometric progression of their individual talent which culminates in ""Being There"" as multi-level entertainment you'll watch many, many times.

Russell,"[0, 0]","This is a very well-done movie of a very funny, very disturbing, very chilling book by a very disturbed author.Peter Sellers plays Chance, who, while still young enough to have no earlier memories, ended up in the house of a very rich, powerful man in Washington, D.C. where nobody paid him much attention and, like Topsy, he just growed.The movie opens with him watching a TV as some other somber, well-dressed people come in and explain that they are lawyers and that he must pack his belongings and leave.Wearing his benefactor's clothes (the 1920's wardrobe of &#34;a man of parts,&#34; now come round to be fashionable again) he steps through the gate in the estate's garden wall and steps into the Hieronymus Bosch hell of late 20th Century Washington, D.C.His first experience is with an encounter with some street punks who try to shake him down. He has seen this before on the only place he has seen anything: TV. He resorts to the only keepsake he was allowed to bring out of the old man's house: the TV remote control. He doesn't like the gang confronting him so he knows how to make them go away. He points the remote at them and presses a button.There are computer programs which start out &#34;knowing&#34; nothing. They learn by watching you. They learn the goal and the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe by watching what their opponent does. Thus does Chance learn.He ends up a guest at the house of a Washington heavy-weight and, like the computer program, copies the actions of the people around him without having the slightest idea of what he is doing or saying.The last scene has a troop of Washington insiders planning to run him for President.",5,If You Like This Depiction of Politics You May Keep It.

257224,A168VXSISJWQN9,6301590740,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[5, 7]","I can see why some people don't like this movie. If the themes don't resonate with you, it's not really strong enough as a story; and, of course, if your comedic horizons end at 'Jackass', you'll find it awfully slow. Personally, I think it's a great movie and Peter Sellers should have won the Oscar for it- the Academy gave the award to Dustin Hoffman for one of his more pedestrian performances, presumably because he had been nominated and lost 3 times previously.I won't repeat the plotline, it's been dealt with extensively already. One of the strengths of the movie is that it means different things to different people. Here's what it means to me. I see Chance the gardener, aka Chauncey Gardner, as representing life. The film shows how other people perceive him and, sure enough, he is what each person perceives him to be. He's wise, he's philosophical, he's a great lover, he's down to earth, he's politically astute, he's underhanded, he's ambitious...... in reality, he's none of these things. He's a blank canvas on which others paint their pictures- and what they see is different in every case. Only one person sees him as he is, and sensibly keeps quiet about it. The message is that life is how it appears to you- and most people see what they want to see.Chance is also an individual experiencing life, and in this capacity life becomes what you make of it. Chance, in his state of innocence, doesn't have any preconceptions about his limitations. He simply does what he wants to do or is asked to do. When he's asked questions, he answers in the only way he knows how without wondering what others will think of his answers. When he wants something, he asks for it. Nothing intimidates or scares him. When he's asked to appear on a talk show or to advise the President, he isn't afraid that he will make a fool of himself. In the final, consummate act of innocence, he walks out on the water, simply because he doesn't know he can't. Chance shows what life could be if we were unbounded by convention or fear, things that constrain most of us and limit what we achieve.The film's messages are brilliantly realized by Hal Ashby, and make this movie one of the few (A Room With A View would be another) which outshine the book from which they are derived. He draws a wonderful performance from Sellers, who is completely convincing as the man/child, and excellent performances from the great supporting cast. If you want belly laughs, the only scene in this movie you'll enjoy is the one with Shirley MacLaine pleasing herself. If you want thoughtful, subtle comedy with a message, try Being There.

257225,A3CLUIYGGD44IR,6301590740,John McConnell,"[8, 9]","The novel Being There is dark farce. The film Being There is an epiphany of light. As the film proceeds, we settle down quite comfortably into our own stereotypes - We're watching a sweet but dim-witted man innocently get the better of all his betters. Yes, absolutely, that's just what it is. But when the movie reaches its finale, we see with mild shock our perceptions were just as proud, just as superficial, just as wrong as those of the worldly people surrounding the ""dim-witted"" man. We - like they - never realized we were in the presence of spiritual majesty, in the presence of a living miracle. The movie thus holds up a mirror to the viewer.Some amazon reviewers don't see themselves in this mirror. They don't understand this film for just that reason - they watched it through from beginning to the end with blinders on - and declined to take them off at the finale - even when the blinders were pointed out to them. Some folks apparently want more car chases, light saber battles, or good old-fashioned CGI explosions; others seem to consider the profound ignorance of a dim-wit as capable of producing miracles.(Plot spoiler below... Please stop here unless you've watched the film.)* * *The walking on water scene - the miracle - at the film's close is the crux of what separates this Peter Sellers film from the Jerzy Kosinski novel. This closing scene was a brainstorm of pure genius. Unlike Jerzy Kosinski's novelBeing There- which leaves a poor warped innocent doomed to disgrace in an unsustainable social impasse - this film delivers a transcendent, triumphant Innocence. This film can speak to and affirm what is best in you and the human race, remind you of the supreme, simple dignity of Humility, and warn you against the sin of human respect. Being There, because of its sweetness and humor and innocence and profundity, is one of my favorite films.

Peter Sellers died soon after this role and never lived to reap the rewards of this stellar performance.""  Great insight!  But...Well, it depends on your viewpoint.  The recent ""Life and Death of Peter Sellers"" HBO film puts another depth to it:  that Sellers was fascinated by the Chauncey Gardener character because it represented his own father.  If you loved this movie (as I do), you will love Rush's depiction of this dimension.In light of the raucous, gaudy and chaotic life that Sellers led, the place of quiet simplicity he explores in this film is all the more extraordinary and beautiful.  Yes, he invites us to laugh at Chauncey and, derivatively, his own father and himself personally.

Cardwell ""ghosthead101""","[0, 1]","tHIS is one of the few satires that is actually thought-provoking and flat out funniest as could have POSSIBLy been thought of.  The story is somewhat like 15-years'-laters' FORREST GUMP, but is not unecessarily sappy and intentionally hoky...it doesn't judge people, it just makes fun of 'them'.  It lets us see a bunch of people who think they've got it all under control, but are really just a bunch of baffoons!  It's touching in some ways, to see how innocent Peter Sellers' character is, and how he maintains his stamina (what little he has) throughout the what-must-have-seemed-weird-to-HIM situations he encounters.  He doesn't lie, he just doesn't understand the need to contradict the liars (who don't know what kind of lies their weaving!).  I actually laughed so hard it hurt to watch anymore of the 135(?) mins of movie this presentation offered (this one being some premium channel via a special offer from Charter Communications...the DVD should be 'very similiar'...anyway).  It's that good; I enjoyed it the 1st time VERY much, although it beatus the hellush outta me as to why the MPAA didn't take back it's flip-of-the-coin 'rating' (PG)/(back then it was either PG or R, unless it was DELIBERATELY made for children or went unrated...PG-13 was not around then...).  ERotica isn't a myth in this film, it's a full blown passion!

257230,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6301590740,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","""Being There"" features one of Peter Sellers' best and final performances as a simple, stupid man who climbs up the political food chain. A movie with an ending that has been the subject of endless discussion for years. The thing that makes Sellers' performance so good is not that it's showy or flamboyant, but that it's quiet. He plays the role the same throughout, with the same speech pattern. Not once does he change his cadence or raise his voice or lower it. He talks like a machine and that's pretty much what his character Chance the Gardener is. Sellers got the role by sending a telegram to the writer of the book (who ended up writing the screenplay), saying he was perfect for it. That's an understatement. I don't think anyone else could play this role. As I said, Sellers plays Chance the Gardener. Chance lives in a big mansion with ""the old man"" and Louise, the maid. All he knows he has learned from T.V. So when the old man dies and Chance is evicted he finds himself on the streets for the first time. He's never left the mansion. The problem is, Chance presents himself like a typical well-to-do man. He dresses in the old man's clothing and his speech sounds intelligent. When he's accidentally hit by a car, he finds himself befriended by a dying millionaire named Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas) and his wife Eve (Shirley MacLaine). When he introduces himself to Eve, he begins choking so when he says ""Chance the Gardender"" she hears ""Chauncey Gardiner."" Pretty soon, Chance finds himself meeting with the President (Jack Warden) and ending up on T.V. By the end of the film, people are thinking about nominating him as a presidential candidate. Chance, despite being stupid and illiterate, responds well to cues which is  how he makes it around these people. His scenes are written perfectly, because you can see how people could be fooled by his demeanor. It's never overplayed. ""Being There"" is considered a classic, but isn't seen by many people anymore. It would be a perfect film, but a couple needless subplots (like the president's impotency) slow it down a bit. Any good actor is capable of giving a great performance, but few performances are capable of getting you to have your eyes glued to the screen. Two examples of these kind that pop into my head are Ben Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast' and Al Pacino in 'Dog Day Afternoon.' Sellers' gives one of those performances, because it's so unlike anything you've seen. The ending is the perfect way to end the film. A lot of people try to explain the scene logically, but no explanation convinces someone else. It's obviously a metaphor, but sometimes the smartest film watchers don't know what it means. A lot of people try to say Chance is standing on something, but doesn't work. The final scene is an image that we're presented with. It's for us to interpret, but, theoretically, we're not allowed to pry deeper into the image we're given. And speaking of images, another thing that makes this film so good is the photography by Caleb Deschanel (whose recent works include 'The Passion of the Christ' & 'Ask the Dust'). All the photography in this film is superb, but there are two examples in this film that wow me. One being the final scene and the other fairly early on when Chance walks down a busy street. ""Being There"" is a satire, when you get right down to it. It's a great film, with some minor flaws. Douglas, Warden, and MacLaine also deliver memorable performances, so I recommend you see this.GRADE: B+",4,A Unique Little Film...Sellers is Amazing.,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,3495,"['Being', 'one', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'best', 'final', 'performances', 'simple', 'stupid', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'political', 'food', 'chain', 'movie', 'ending', 'been', 'subject', 'endless', 'discussion', 'years', 'thing', 'Sellers', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'not', 'showy', 'flamboyant', 'quiet', 'role', 'same', 'same', 'speech', 'pattern', 'Not', 'once', 'change', 'cadence', 'raise', 'voice', 'lower', 'machine', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'character', 'Chance', 'Gardener', 'Sellers', 'got', 'role', 'sending', 'telegram', 'writer', 'book', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'saying', 'was', 'perfect', 'understatement', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'play', 'role', 'said', 'Sellers', 'Chance', 'Gardener', 'Chance', 'big', 'mansion', 'old', 'man', 'Louise', 'maid', 'learned', 'T.V', 'So', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'Chance', 'evicted', 'streets', 'first', 'time', 'never', 'left', 'mansion', 'problem', 'Chance', 'typical', 'well-to-do', 'man', 'old', 'man', 'clothing', 'speech', 'intelligent', 'When', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'car', 'befriended', 'dying', 'millionaire', 'named', 'Benjamin', 'Rand', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'wife', 'Eve', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'When', 'Eve', 'choking', 'so', 'when', 'Chance', 'Gardender', 'Chauncey', 'Gardiner', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Chance', 'meeting', 'President', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'ending', 'up', 'T.V', 'end', 'film', 'people', 'are', 'thinking', 'nominating', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'Chance', 'being', 'stupid', 'illiterate', 'well', 'cues', 'how', 'people', 'scenes', 'are', 'written', 'perfectly', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'fooled', 'demeanor', 'never', 'overplayed', 'Being', 'considered', 'classic', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'people', 'anymore', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'film', 'couple', 'needless', 'subplots', 'president', 'impotency', 'slow', 'down', 'bit', 'good', 'actor', 'capable', 'giving', 'great', 'performance', 'few', 'performances', 'are', 'capable', 'getting', 'have', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'Two', 'examples', 'kind', 'pop', 'head', 'are', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', ""'Sexy"", 'Beast', 'Al', 'Pacino', ""'Dog"", 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Sellers', 'one', 'performances', 'so', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ending', 'perfect', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'try', 'explain', 'scene', 'logically', 'explanation', 'someone', 'else', 'obviously', 'metaphor', 'sometimes', 'smartest', 'film', 'watchers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'try', 'say', 'Chance', 'standing', 'something', ""n't"", 'work', 'final', 'scene', 'image', ""'re"", 'presented', 'interpret', 'theoretically', ""'re"", 'not', 'allowed', 'pry', 'deeper', 'image', ""'re"", 'given', 'speaking', 'images', 'thing', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'photography', 'Caleb', 'Deschanel', 'recent', 'include', ""'The"", 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Dust', 'photography', 'film', 'superb', 'are', 'two', 'examples', 'film', 'One', 'being', 'final', 'scene', 'other', 'fairly', 'early', 'when', 'Chance', 'walks', 'down', 'busy', 'street', 'Being', 'satire', 'when', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'great', 'film', 'minor', 'flaws', 'Douglas', 'Warden', 'MacLaine', 'also', 'deliver', 'memorable', 'performances', 'recommend', 'see', 'this.GRADE', 'B+']",Being There VHS

I help myself in check and kept repeating, ""Just wait, it gets better.""And I'll say that to you, too.

This particular gardener, however, has never ventured outside the four walls of the estate and only knows the world through what he sees on TV.What follows is a series of serendipitous adventures reminiscent of Forrest Gump. Chauncy sees the world in a child-like way, greets everyone with a smile and unknowingly speaks in gardening metaphors that are interpreted as high wisdom -- even by the President of the United States.This is Sellers' finest role, revealing more depth and skill than any other role of his I can think of.Although the movie seems long at times (a few scenes could have been cut to give it a quicker pace), it unfolds in a most endearing way.The ending of this movie is one you'll never, ever forget.

257240,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,6301590740,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[4, 5]","BEING THERE is a wonderful film; simple, quiet, and extremely though provoking.  One of Peter Sellers' final and, perhaps, best performance, the role of Chance the gardener is a huge departure from the typical, over-the-top, slapstick comedic roles for which he is so well known and loved.  An amazing mixture of political satire, social commentary, and Biblical metaphor, BEING THERE is strangely prophetic and very relevant to our own current political drama.In BEING THERE, we meet Chance the Gardener (Peter Sellers), a mentally handicapped man who has learned everything he knows from TV and has had no other interaction with the outside world.  Chance appears to have been born in the garden, and has never been outsides its walls.  When his employer, the Old Man, dies, Chance is thrown into the real world. Chance's initial interactions with the outside world are very innocent, simplistic, and very literal.  When the wife (Shirley MacLaine) of a wealthy power broker (Melvyn Douglas) accidently hits Chance with her car, he finds himself hanging out with the rich and famous.  To Chance, these are just people, people whose kindnesses and words he takes at face value.  Yet these people believe that Chance is great man and a great scholar; they believe that his simple observations about plants are rich metaphors for life, business, and politics.  Chance becomes a valued and well known advisor to the rich and famous, to the country, and to the world.While Peter Sellers is always fun, in BEING THERE the humor is more muted and subtle.  BEING THERE is a successful mockery of political conceit and the effects of seeing what you want to see. The character of Chance is a mirror; the people who go to him for advice see what they want to see - what they NEED to see - whether the subject is political, business, or just plain life.  To me, BEING THERE is a new, updated version of the old fable The Emperor's New Clothes.Peter Sellers is outstanding in this, his penultimate role. His performance is subtle, calm, and nuanced to near perfection.  He makes you want to laugh, to cry, and to just plain hope.  Shirley MacLaine as a woman looking for love and Melvyn Douglas as her dying, powerful husband are both superb.  In fact the entire cast does a marvelous job.As previously stated, BEING THERE is thoughtful, understated film, brilliant in its simplicity.

For the first time, Seller really seems to reveal his true nature on screen, ironically by portraying a man who really WASN'T all there emotionally, closely parallelling Seller's own personality (see the recent HBO movie about him,The Life and Times of Peter Sellers, to get a more detailed look at Sellers' life and personality) in so many ways.The basic premise of the movie is simple - a gardener has been kept secluded from the world, exposed only to television. As a result, his view of things is rather flat, not fully fleshed out. His personality is equally flat but also serene and straightforward. When he encounters the outside world, his simplicity is seen as wisdom and Sellers makes this odd scenario...well, believable.This movie was made during a particularly turbulent period in Seller's personal life and yet he manages to be serene, even placid, on film, giving no hint at the emotional turmoil in his offscreen life. Just as Sellers defied categorization (he is, after all, the same actor who made The Pink Panther movies with Blake Edwards as well as Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, this movie is in a class all its own.Those who love Popular Culture should have a field day analyzing how television can affect one's view of the world, for better or worse.

Peter Sellers is a riot as the deadpan Chance Gardener whose endless pontificating on the welfare of plant-life becomes a potent metaphor for 80's politics, granting him national attention thanks to the endorsement of a dying codger and his concupiscent wife. The film is timeless, save one walking montage early on that seems like it was scored by a malfunctioning machine. The action is primarily contained to a cold, ornate mansion, though it does not seem catastrophic, instead casting a wide sense of exposure due to the fact that most plot points revolve around television and its ability to manipulate the truth--if the truth ever even existed to begin with! Much has been made of the film's final shot with its Christ-like implications. For me, the last few frames make the movie--elevating the proceedings to a level not quite broached by all the network-TV nudging and winking when Chance says things like ""All Is Well In The Garden"" a phrase you might find yourself constantly regurgitating long after the credits have rolled. If you don't mind a slow-boiling storyline and are excited by good old fashioned acting, you will find much to love here.

Put out on the street (literally) when the owner dies with nothing but a suitcase full of the owner's custom made suits (perfect fit except about 3 inches short in the legs) he tries to find what life has next.

I can't say that about the vast majority of movies I see, obviously. Peter Sellers is diabolically good as Chance the gardener, a sheltered nitwit who has spent his entire life in a townhouse, working for an old and presumably once-wealthy man. Upon the man's death, Chance is cast out into the world.A truly chance encounter then occurs; he is hit by the chauffeur-driven car of a wealthy couple living in the Washington, D.C., area. Just as he's telling the wife his name, he begins coughing because of the alcohol she's served him, and when he says ""Chance the gardener,"" what she hears is ""Chauncey Gardener."" She -- Eve Rand -- takes him home to be cared for by a medical team in the employ of her husband, multimillionaire Ben Rand, who , considerably older than she, is dying.What ensues is a run-on case of mistaken identity. Chance is just a gardener, but his homespun sayings are taken as wise philosophy by those who insist on seeing meaning and metaphor in everything. Chance is only a gardener, yes, but in the wishful minds of those he meets, he is the mysterious Chauncey Gardener, man of few -- but sage! -- words. Chance really is talking about gardening, but Chauncey becomes a Candide to those who think his voice is the very sound of enlightenment. We must cultivate our garden, indeed!""Being There"" is a black comedy. Whether you find it funny, along with disturbing, depends in great part on your world view.

257257,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,6301590740,Marty Gillis,"[8, 9]","'Being There' has always been my favorite Peter Sellers movie, right next to 'A Shot in the Dark'.  I was very excited about finally being able to watch it in wide screen and with much better picture quality than the endless showings I saw on HBO back in the 80's.  This review pertains to the actual Blu Ray quality and features, rather the movie itself.  Hopefully this will help other fans of Peter Sellers and this film decide if this upgrade is money well spent.'Being There' arrives on a 50 GB dual layer disc with a 1080p/VC-1 encode.  So far, so good. So how does it actually look?Well, sadly, 'Being There' is not up to the visual quality you would wish for.  It appears some idiot at Warner Brother's decided that the natural film grain was BAD and decided to eliminate it with copious amounts of the dreaded DNR, the enemy of all film fans everywhere!  I agree DNR has it's place but I prefer to be the one to use it and to decide how MUCH of it I use on problematic source material.  The colors are fine, the image is pretty stable (not perfect) and overall it is miles ahead of what I remember from my many HBO screenings of yesteryear.  Because of the amount of DNR used, you get motion artifacts including slight blurring at times during motion and that plain out sucks.  I did my best to overlook all the shortcomings of the video while watching and at times there are a few shots and scenes here and there that seem untouched and make you wish they left the film alone and just gave us what was there after a bit of cleaning.  Honestly, it isn't horrible, but it isn't all that good either.  Luckily for me anyway, I find the film is so great that the dip in video quality (by Blu Ray standards) is something I can pretty much ignore and just enjoy the movie.We are NOT talking about the poor video quality of titles like 'Uncle Buck' or 'National Lampoon's Vacation' here, it is MUCH better than those titles at least. Thank goodness!For audio you get a choice of the original Mono in  Dolby Digital quality encode, or you can opt for the better Dolby TruHD 2.0 track. Be aware that this is NOT a stereo mix , but rather something akin to 'dual mono' but in a nice high resolution format. This film was never presented in anything other than mono during it's theatrical run or subsequent endless showings on cable.  I assume the original sound elements (stems) were not available for remixing or that Warner Home Video just decided not to bother as this is a catalog title and an obscure one at that to all but Peter's devoted fans and fans of the film.  (not to me though)  No matter, it sounds fine.  I tried both flavors and and honestly there is only a slight different between the original mono and the Dolby Tru HD with the uncompressed HD soundtrack winning out but just by a nose really.If you remember watching this on your old tube TV sets back in the day, you will be happy with the audio results, it DOES sound much better than I remember and it is mostly crisp and clear, although some of the TV clips can get a bit screechy at times.I was not expecting an action movie mix and therefore was not disappointed in the least with the sound provided on this Blu Ray.There are a few extras.  You get the famous outtakes at the end of the film, only more of them. You get a few additional scenes, none which add anything special to the plot but cool to see nevertheless.  You get a few rarities including the director Hal Ashby and Peter Sellers goofing around in a little promo skit.  You also get the original trailer (in SD) and you get the alternate ending.  I am glad they stuck with the ending I have come to know and love!  The extras are no great shakes, but for fans of the film they are pure gold.Bottom line, if you LOVE 'Being There' this purchase is pretty much mandatory.  If you are not sure about the film and want to see if you like it or not, rent it or pick up a used copy.  As for me, 'Being There' on Blu Ray will be a yearly viewing event and a most pleasurable one at that!  For fans, recommended!!",5,Being There on Blu!

Instead, what you'll find is an elaborate, satirical, postmodern fairy tale that operates under the following premise: The kind, naive, half-wit played by Peter Sellers is so completely out of contact with reality that all he can do is repeat what he's seen on TV. Yet his pronouncements, as vague and infantile as they are, produce sound-bites and are vapid enough to allow his admirers (just about everyone admires him!) to project whatever meaning they want to, so that he is considered some sort of genius, even a Christ figure. To further my point, I am reminded of the cartoon Mr. McGoo where the blind McGoo avoids accident after accident by sheer luck. Peter Sellers avoids verbal accident after verbal accident by the sheer luck of people misinterpreting everything he says so that he comes off as a genius. If that premise sounds funny to you for 130 minutes, you'll like this movie.

Other films have used the idea since - 'Forrest Gump' is the most obvious, but there are bits of it in 'Rain Man', 'Bulworth' and, oddly, 'The Truman Show' (in that the latter was a 'serious comedy'). The comedic heritage of Sellers tends to overshadow the rest of the film, and the critics have generally either ignored it, or puzzled as to why it wasn't funnier.Like 'Network', it makes even more sense today - witness, as someone else here notes, the rise of George Bush - and it's very much a 70s film, in that it has a measured pace, doesn't have a CGI lizard at any point, and features precisely no action. Chance is iconic and ironic, heroic and alarming at the same time, and the film has an abivalent message. Should we celebrate instinct over reason, or challenge our supposed betters with more vigour? It's impossible not to like Chance (there's a bit of him in all of us), and the thought that he might be a more effective leader of men than a career politician is both depressing and amusing, but is he something to be embraced or guarded against?The final scene is almost as ambivalent as that of 'American Psycho' - is Chance merely lucky, or an allegory, or something else?

What emerges is a truly witty and triumphant story. `Being There' allows us to look at what we have become as a society and tears down the ladders we are expected to climb. What is left is a revealing look at the common denominator and the math involved in obtaining it. Along the way, it becomes clear that friendship, understanding and love are unaffected by the simplicity of one's actions. Indeed, we find that it sprinkles the pathway with a chance to read one's intent not through words, but by thinking, searching one's eyes and trusting our instincts.Peter Sellers is deeply entrenched in a character that may be the hardest role for someone of his intellect, oratory gifts, and physical presence to inhabit. I am not sure that I have ever seen a film that so brilliantly uses reactions as a major part of the script. This also makes for hilarious `what if' scenarios. Sellers' talent for this goes without saying. He is joined by an impressive array of old Hollywood talent who compliment his every gesture.Melvyn Douglas rightfully earned the Oscar for his portrayal of Benjamin Rand, somewhat of a J. Paul Getty industrialist who has one foot in the grave and the President's ear as well. Shirley MacLaine is wonderful as Eve, Rand's devoted but antsy wife. Ms. MacLaine is always a good bet to take over any film she is cast in, and she steals several scenes. In one, she leaves us rolling on the floor laughing.Jack Warden builds a role as the crafty and cranky President into a fine performance. Initially, it appeared that he would be used sparingly, but his subsequent scenes were very good. Ruth Attaway portrays Louise, a woman burdened by the truth, yet rightfully embittered by it. Richard Dysart provides intrigue as the skeptical Doctor Allenby.`Being There' was directed by Hal Ashby. He was afforded an excellent script, cast, and crew. I think one of the reasons that great actors require great directors is due to their immersion into their roles. Mr. Ashby had the ability, as they say in sports, to `see the whole field'. It was an essential ingredient to making this a classic film. The movie was filmed in 1979, and there is much to date it. Yet, the core elements are timeless.The movie is now on Blu-ray. There are a few extras, such as memories of the filming, an alternate ending and deleted scenes. It does look nice, but do not expect the normal HD experience. It was filmed almost 30 years ago.

Firstly it's very good - the acting and direction are excellent, it's funny, it's a clever story, and it makes you think. All pretty good credentials for any film. Secondly - and here's where its true brilliance lies - its underlying message hasn't dated at all and, if anything, is more relevant and effective than it was when it was made.And the message itself? Superficially, it's an exploration of how, in a world dominated by the fleeting demands of mass media, someone with absolutely no knowledge at all can become a megastar and, once established as such, can demand respect and gain power far beyond their capabilities. And, beneath that... well, that's where the fun starts. Is it an exploration of the shallowness of western society? Is it a study of people's weaknesses & needs? Is it a religious allegory? Is it, in terms of most of the characters, a huge tragedy? Is it all or none of these?The ending, which generates much debate about its ""meaning"" - is he walking on water in a messianic way or is he simply so stupid that he doesn't realise he's walking, by accident, on a submerged jetty? - is quite brilliant as are the final ""over the titles"" cuts of Sellers being unable to deliver his deadpan lines without laughing at them, leaving you with the uncomfortable feeling that the ""joke"" might be on you in trying to read too much into what's on offer here.

257275,A3TO3AY1UFM83U,6301590740,"not a natural ""Bob Bickel""","[1, 3]","Being There is the most charming movie I've ever seen.  Peter Sellers, as Chauncy Gardener, is at his very best playing a character totally devoid of guile, innocent in the ways of the world, and unself-consciously forthcoming.  Through happenstance, coincidence, and uncontaminated trust he comes to the attention of an aged and infirm man of great wealth who has the political power of a king-maker, ably played by Melvyn Douglas who is a perfect fit for the role.Before we meet him, Chauncy was a man of unknown provenance who had spent his adult life as the gardener for a rich benefactor whose death leaves him jobless, homeless, and on his own.  Chauncy is a good gardener who knows nothing more than his work and what he has seen watching television.  His lack of experience with the world at large accounts for his ingenuous frankness and winsome good cheer.It is easy, and probably correct, to construe Chauncy as simple-minded, witless, and slow, but Melvyn Douglas' character and his circle of politically powerful associates see intelligence and wisdom in the calmness and pastoral metaphors that come so easily to a man of the soil.  Soon, absurd though it is, there is talk of promoting Chauncy as a candidate for the presidency.When Chauncy appears on a national TV talk show, his audience is similarly won over.  His sure-handed rendering of the notion that for everything there is a season is nothing more than a commonsense observation from his years as a gardener, but viewers interpret it as a manifestation of temperate even-handedness and non-ideological good sense.  Chauncy's vagueness does not put off prospective voters, who understand it as reflecting depth and honesty. Yet Chauncy's delivery is really no less abstract and subject to any and all interpretations than the meaningless oratory of contemporary politicians.  Chauncy, however, is speaking of something concrete, his garden, and he seems much more plausible and sincere than those who have no specific referent in mind, but seek only to manipulate prospective voters, a notion that is not part of Chauncy's hopelessly simple worldview.Melvyn Douglas' wife, played exceptionally well by Shirley Maclaine, falls in love with Chauncy.  As far as love making is concerned, Chauncy, true to his TV-based former life, is limited to watching.  ""I like to watch,"" he tells Shirley Maclaine's character, who comes to revel in it, never having been so satisfied as she does whatever it is she has to do to take care of her self while Chauncy looks on.  Probably a scene that the Being There could have done without.Some viewers may quite understandably take Being There as a cynical affirmation of our ability to see what we want to see and believe what we want to believe.  I think, however, that the film is better understood as a testimonial to a yearning for true innocence, unvarnished honesty, a fundamental simplicity in a thoroughly corrupted world. suffused with dissembling, temporizing, lying, and brutality masquerading as hard-nosed realism.  Unfortunately, However, in the 21st Century each of us needs a thick carapace of pretense and artificial polish to keep from being crushed.  However, without being sappy or maudlin, Being There shows us the attraction of an alternative.  I'm the most cynical person I know, but you don't have to be squishy soft and hopelessly deluded to appreciate Being There; you just need to be imbued with a last faint trace of wistful idealism.The final scene, in which Chauncy literally walks on water, is problematic.  Is this a metaphorical testimonial to the power of innocence, honesty, and lack of guile in an ugly world where nothing is what it seems and all is self-seeking and corruption?  Or is it an hallucination of a man so limited in experience and lacking in worldly scope that he sees what he wants to see?  I think it's the former.If we take Being There literally, it's just another characterization of the ease with which we are manipulated and the stupidity of the categories we bring to bear on interpreting the world.

257279,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,6301590740,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[1, 2]","I'm a big fan of both Peter Sellers and Hal Ashby, so this was a real treat.  Ashby's simple, straightforward filmmaking perfectly backs up a simple, straightforward character played honestly and charismatically by Sellers.  Just like how the characters use Chance as a way of projecting their needs outwards and clearing up their fears, the film is readily willing to allow you to put whatever you want into it, whether it be the nature of simplicity, the effects of television on people, and like themes.But overall, it's a heartwarming and wonderful parable, something that, despite its sometimes sexual content, is really open for anybody to enjoy (though I don't know, kids or such might be a little bored by the prolonged way it presents its story).Only because I saw the latter recently, I thought I'd mention that this seems an interesting precursor to a Japanese movie that came out last year named Bin-jip (3-Iron).  Both deal with invisible characters living on the fringe of society who eventually take in all that the other characters give them (kindness in Being There, hatred in Bin-jip) and transcend to another plane of existence.  In Being There, Sellers' transcendence is Biblical, while in Bin-jip the mute is Buddhist.  Both of them are really good movies and make interesting companion pieces, so if you were awed by this movie, you should check out the other one.Anyway, the key thing I got out of this movie was that Chance, being unable to really communicate the way people expect of him, is unaware that he makes the perfect listener.  His ""I like to watch"" line is taken just as the characters take it: he is meant to provide the necessary objectivity needed in a room so that the characters can subjectively clear out their own anxieties and conscience.  The familiar and warm presence of Sellers works great for this, because he of all people is really comforting to watch in his various roles.--PolarisDiB",4,Transcendence,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,1935,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Hal', 'Ashby', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'Ashby', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'filmmaking', 'perfectly', 'up', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'character', 'played', 'honestly', 'charismatically', 'Sellers', 'Just', 'how', 'characters', 'use', 'Chance', 'way', 'projecting', 'needs', 'outwards', 'clearing', 'up', 'fears', 'film', 'readily', 'willing', 'allow', 'put', 'want', 'be', 'nature', 'simplicity', 'effects', 'television', 'people', 'themes.But', 'overall', 'heartwarming', 'wonderful', 'parable', 'something', 'sometimes', 'sexual', 'content', 'really', 'open', 'anybody', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'kids', 'such', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'bored', 'prolonged', 'way', 'story', '.Only', 'saw', 'latter', 'recently', 'thought', ""'d"", 'mention', 'interesting', 'precursor', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'named', 'Bin-jip', '3-Iron', 'deal', 'invisible', 'characters', 'living', 'fringe', 'society', 'who', 'eventually', 'take', 'other', 'characters', 'give', 'kindness', 'Being', 'hatred', 'Bin-jip', 'transcend', 'plane', 'existence', 'Being', 'Sellers', 'transcendence', 'Biblical', 'Bin-jip', 'mute', 'Buddhist', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'movies', 'make', 'interesting', 'companion', 'pieces', 'so', 'were', 'awed', 'movie', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'one.Anyway', 'key', 'thing', 'got', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'Chance', 'being', 'unable', 'really', 'communicate', 'way', 'people', 'expect', 'unaware', 'perfect', 'listener', 'like', 'watch', 'line', 'taken', 'just', 'characters', 'take', 'meant', 'provide', 'necessary', 'objectivity', 'needed', 'room', 'characters', 'can', 'subjectively', 'clear', 'out', 'own', 'anxieties', 'conscience', 'familiar', 'warm', 'presence', 'Sellers', 'great', 'people', 'really', 'comforting', 'watch', 'various', 'roles.', 'PolarisDiB']",Being There VHS

I now understand the reputation it has accrued and I must say that I really did enjoy it.  I can't see my way to rating it with ""5 Stars"" but ""4 Stars"" is certainly an indication of my respect and appreciation of this quality film.  I laughed out loud on several occassions but the more common reaction I got was one of curiosity.  Although everything that takes place in ""Being There"" seems to be normal, I never knew what to expect next.  That's because, in the midst of all these characters who play their expected roles, there is one person who is completely out of place.  Right from the beginning we are aware of who this character is and why he is so out of place.  We just aren't prepared for the places he goes, the people he meets and the things he does.  At times we see the parody of lifestyles, at times the parody of philosphies, at time the parodies of relationships, and at times the parodies of something else (we may not fully grasp what the parody is of...but we know it must be a parody).The movie, will draw you in if you let it.  Although I am often too pragmatic for my own good, I found it easy to be drawn into ""Being There"".  A cursory look at some other reviews tells me others were not.  I think the way this movie succeeds is the way the character was set up for us.  I recall seeing ""The Sixth Sense"" years ago when it came out.  I was insulted not by the movie but by a trailer in which the writer and director reviewed scenes in which a deceased character was able to believe that he was actually alive based on his perceived interaction with living persons.  Their contention was; See! You doubted that this could happen but we just showed you how it could!  OK, I thought, that proves your point for those 7 or 8 scenes but they took place over several days at least and you don't account for what this character did the rest of his time.  In ""Being There"" we never need to concern ourselves with such pragmatic issues because we know that Chance Gardner is usually going to be off by himself watching TV.  We can accept that the only scenes with him interacting with others were the only ones that actually occurred.  (My pragmatism often works overtime).  We can accept him as he is which enables viewers like myself to then accept everything else that happens as well.The ending is a bit peculiar and left me reviewing what I had seen.  There is an opportunity to elevate the meaning of ""Being There"" depending on how you react to that final scene.

It shares much in common with ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" (1837), except there is no Honest Boy to point out that Chauncy Gardner is not whom he is assumed to be. Actually, Jerzy Kosinski wrote the novel on which this film is based and it was skillfully directed by Hal Ashby. The acting throughout the cast is outstanding. Douglas received an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role, Sellers a nomination for best actor in a  leading role. MacLaine is also terrific. Obviously, Eve is devoted to her husband as well as very fond of him but starved for attention and affection when Chauncy appears in her life. She is attracted to him just as everyone else is. (I have already noted that this is a fable.) I should point out, now, that at no time and in no way does Chauncy consciously and deliberately attempt to deceive anyone. Yes, he really is THAT dim.

So what if everything you know was learned through watching television; what kind of person would you be?  That is the lure of Being There (although by no means is it the entire movie).  Peter Sellers (in a performance proving yet again how invalid the Academy Awards are in judging the ""best"" of anything) plays ""Chance"", a quiet gardener put out of work and home when his elderly employer dies.  Not really all that harrowing until you realize ""Chance"" has no understanding of a world without commercial interruption or the convenience of changing the channel with a remote control.The ability of mankind to see and hear what it wants is definitely the underlying theme to this film.  When befriended by an ailing millionaire with extreme political influence ""Chance's"" every word is viewed by the media (and subsequently the world) as that of a philosophical genius.  Everything ""Chance"" says is relevant to gardening which gives him the appearance of being steadfast in his philosophy.It's very rare that a movie comes along with such amazing acting, writing, and direction.  Peter Sellers gives the performance of a lifetime and I can't imagine anyone else ever playing ""Chance"" with more conviction or nuanced aplomb.The script is amazing, providing a thought provoking introspection of our own assumptions of the everyday.  The ending of this film is one of the best I've ever seen, as it makes you rethink every interaction and smile, because it all makes sense.Being There is a must see film for anyone who is fed up with the vice grip television has on the world mindset and how we are more often than not misinformed and deluded with it's freely provided misconceptions.""This is just like television, only you can see much further.""",5,No One Reads,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1893,"['age', 'where', 'are', 'seemingly', 'governed', 'what', 'flickers', 'idiot', 'box', 'reality', 'tv', 'anyone', 'movie', 'sadly', 'still', 'extremely', 'relevant', 'today', 'So', 'what', 'everything', 'know', 'was', 'learned', 'watching', 'television', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'lure', 'Being', 'means', 'entire', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'performance', 'proving', 'yet', 'again', 'how', 'invalid', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'are', 'judging', 'best', 'anything', 'Chance', 'quiet', 'gardener', 'put', 'work', 'home', 'when', 'elderly', 'employer', 'dies', 'Not', 'really', 'harrowing', 'realize', 'Chance', 'understanding', 'world', 'commercial', 'interruption', 'convenience', 'changing', 'channel', 'remote', 'control.The', 'ability', 'mankind', 'see', 'hear', 'what', 'definitely', 'underlying', 'theme', 'film', 'When', 'befriended', 'ailing', 'millionaire', 'extreme', 'political', 'influence', 'Chance', 'word', 'viewed', 'media', 'subsequently', 'world', 'philosophical', 'genius', 'Everything', 'Chance', 'relevant', 'gardening', 'appearance', 'being', 'steadfast', 'philosophy.It', 'very', 'rare', 'movie', 'along', 'such', 'amazing', 'acting', 'writing', 'direction', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'ever', 'playing', 'Chance', 'more', 'conviction', 'nuanced', 'aplomb.The', 'script', 'amazing', 'providing', 'thought', 'provoking', 'introspection', 'own', 'assumptions', 'everyday', 'ending', 'film', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'rethink', 'interaction', 'smile', 'sense.Being', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'vice', 'grip', 'television', 'world', 'mindset', 'how', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'misinformed', 'deluded', 'freely', 'provided', 'misconceptions', 'just', 'like', 'television', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'much', 'further']",Being There VHS
257293,A3B6D3A01L2AAD,6301590740,"Sal Magnum ""refugee from Babylon""","[6, 11]","""Being There""-- so what DOES the title mean? Ilana Douglas, (real-life granddaughter of Melvyn Douglas, whose impeccable portrayal of the old tycoon justifiably won him his second Oscar in a long and worthy career) in the short reminisce that comprises the entirety of the ""special features"", said that to her ""Being There"" meant being in the moment. That Peter Sellers' characterization of the man known alternately as Chance the Gardener and Chauncey Gardener was so strong it kind of drug everyone else in and there was a kind of onscreen reality, if you will, a ""being in the moment"" that happened and made this film the profound masterpiece that it is.I am not one to disagree with that take. It is equally viable as any of my own thoughts on the subject, (depending on your point of view) yet perhaps there is more to it than that. I have found that many trully great pieces of art posses a certain ambiguity about them that goes beyond anything the author originally intended. A meaning that is only revealed through the realization of the work itself, a force which surpasses any conceptual inspiration. I think this is the ""Being There"" that Ilana Douglas refers to. When Peter Sellers went ""full-on retard"", as it were, ""full-on shut-in"" rather, the rest of the cast could not but help to follow suit in their portrayals of what are essentially cultural caricatures, and magic was made in front of the camera lens. No denying that. However, there is another aspect of ""Being There"", something that may in fact be more intentional and blatant as conceived by the author of the book this film is based on, yet, because most people aren't willing to climb the ladder's top rung, usually remains much more evasive.Follow me if you will down this rabbit hole;I couldn't help thinking that it harks back to the old adage about ""being a fly on the wall"". Have you ever had that notion when thinking about how the corporate sector and the political structure of our country and the world is really run at the top? To be a fly on the wall during those subtle, intimate moments when old, bloodless creatures congregate and deals are struck, policies are shifted and Atlas shrugs? Of course we are able to see the aftermath of many of these moments, which allows those of us who get beyond the smoke and mirrors and dog and pony tricks to understand the nature of the course our society is on, and where it is being steered-- but to hear it from their own curmudgeonly lips! To hear them acknowledge public sentiment against their tyranny yet justify it as necessary for the good of the species in the long run!-- perhaps just after they've been pumped full of another fresh batch of blood to keep them in good spirits as per Chance's first encounter with old Ben Rand. ""Some call me a 'kingmaker', but I've stayed true to myself, and that's what matters most of all , my boy.""Wasn't this concept (the fly on the wall, the emotionless being who likes to watch, etc.) the onus of what this film was actually all about? One of the most cleverly disguised depictions of what life is really like at the top? To be a master of the world, to live as if life will never end, as if you will be at the controls forever, and yet, to still be powerless against death when your time has come. To have it all, to live in opulence and luxury while the rest of the world goes to the dogs,(as so poignantly depicted when the Gardener leaves the house he's spent his whole life shut up in for the first time) yet, in the end, to be drug down to Sheol with the rest of us.So it is that we get to observe our overlords (or at least their caricatures) throught the glinted eyes of a perpetual voyeur (the fly on the wall), the only one of us ""down-to-earth"" enough to be allowed within their hallowed walls. A character sought after and hobknobbed by the upper eschalon by virtue of his rare optimism and seeming lack of judgementalism, a trait which tends to infect all those of us not quite placated enough to be content to just watch.Which begs the question concerning the ""common man""'s role in modern civilization; are we nothing more than voyeurs? Our thoughts shaped and controlled by the fabricated envoirnment we live in on this tedius journey through life, watching the big men make their moves on deck while kept safely locked away down in the holding regions below?How about that tomb, eh? A beautiful, little beady eye that makes the one on the back of the dollar bill look like a pale imitation. A legacy for a proud, life-long upholder of The Code, a fitting monument, built in finely hewn stone, built to last. The pallbearers hastily deciding momentous strategy in hushed tones while bringing the old man to his tomb-- er, ah...""final resting place"". The show must go on, plenty more runners to snatch up the baton and carry on.Jack Warden as president!! The first time he appears onscreen is from afar, yet I recognized his craggy features (talk about finely hewn!)from that instant and it filled my heart with glee. What a man, eh? From ""Twelve Angry Men"", to ""...And Justice For All"", to ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"", one was never disappointed with a performance from old Jack. Or his cousin Robert Loggia, for that matter. (Somehow the two are inexplicably linked within the caverns of my mind.) Fitting how his character eulogized the deceased, his own doubts and impotence weighing on him like a roped man at the gallows.Yes, a lot to digest in this flick, many a hearty meal for the cranial sponge to soak in. Watch it again and again, let it marinate your senses.Other musings gleaned in passing: *The firm handshake and stiff upper lip. *An ascot and fine taste in all things good. *The rich are fanciful creatures-- they can afford to be. *A proper gentleman, a pillar of stregth to those that succomb easily to temptation and desperation.

Moreover, the film-making technique--with it use of visual and aural space (the constant ticking of clocks counterpointing Chauncey's &quot;natural&quot; relation to time)--is far superior to today's films with their over-reliance on special effects, unremitting close-ups (for the video aftermarket), and mindless editing.  Finally, Chauncey Gardiner is not merely a device for political satire.  He is, in many respects, a genuine hero.  He confronts mortality, looks death in the face without reliance on sentiment, cosmetics, or baby boomer cliches comparing life's unpredictabilities to a box of chocolates.

The good news is that he finished the film first. I had always believed, since his days in THE PARTY, that Sellers was a highly nuanced actor, with more authority and talent that he was often given credit for, in part due to his love of---and great skill at---farce. BEING THERE is a classic vindication, proving once and for all what a very great acting talent Sellers possessed.It had been several years since I'd watched the movie.

Smith-Peter,"[8, 9]","After I finished watching this movie, I thought of the Tao te Ching, which says that that which is low will be raised up, and that softness will outlast hardness. This movie fable shows how that can happen, while having a sense of the larger social structure that mean some benefit and others don't.  Chance the gardener is sent out from the house where he's lived his whole life.  He's not quite right in the head and only knows what he's seen on TV.  A chance encounter with Eve (Shirley McClaine) brings him into the world of the rich and famous and renames him Chauncey Gardiner.  Everyone sees in him what they want to see and what they want to be.  He is a blank screen for their projections, and by the end of the film he's gone from a nobody to being bandied about as the next president.There are a lot of funny moments here, but underneath it is a very dark view of human nature.  Chance is separate and untouchable, and others feel a connection, but it is mainly through their ego and the pleasure of projecting on him what they want.  The clearest example comes when Eve throws herself at Chance, then pleasures herself alone.  She thinks he's watching, but he's really watching TV and at one point he withdraws his hand so he can do the yoga he sees on the screen. So even the act of love, which could be a moment of great connection, is emphatically made of two different and completely separate experiences.  Here I disagree with Roger Ebert, who says the two sex subplots are unnecessary.  They both show the lack of connection between people, but in very different ways.

It's a movie that probably will not appeal to everyone's taste.The comedy-drama is about a man named Chance (Peter Sellers), the gardener of a small estate that he has lived and worked on all his life.  (In fact, he has never left the estate because all his needs, even meals, were provided for.)  When the owner (the ""old man"") of the estate dies, the truthful, well groomed, well dressed but illiterate Chance is evicted.Chance knows only about three things: gardening, watching television, and the environment of the estate where he lived and worked.  That's it!!By chance, he becomes involved with a dying billionaire (Melvyn Douglas) and his wife (Shirley MacLaine).  The billionaire is also an economic advisor to the US president (Jack Warden).  Everything that Chance says is misinterpreted as profound and ""sage wisdom.""  (Even his name is misinterpreted as ""Chauncey Gardiner."")  The billionaire's wife becomes interested in him romantically.  By the end of the story, Chance is considered to be the next president.To get an understanding of how Chance or Chauncey is misinterpreted, consider this dialogue between him and a worker at a publishing house.  (Notice that Chance is absolutely truthful in this conversation):WORKER: Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you would consider writing a book for us, something about your political philosophy.  What do you say?CHANCE: I can't write.WORKER: Heh, heh, of course not, who can nowadays?  Listen, I have trouble writing a postcard to my children.  Look, we can give you a six-figure advance.  I'll provide you with the very best ghost-writer, proof readers...CHANCE: I can't read.WORKER: Of course you can't!  No one has the time!  We glance at things, we watch television...CHANCE: I like watching TV.WORKER: Oh, sure you do.  No one reads!The very ending of this movie has Chance walking on water.  Actually, he's walking on the surface of a lake and he reveals to us that the lake has depth not just a surface.  This ending is open to many interpretations but for me it summarized the entire movie beautifully.Sellers gives a superb, subtle comic performance.  This was truly the last great movie Sellers made.  All supporting actors (especially MacLaine and Douglas who won an Oscar for his performance) do terrific jobs.The music is said to be by Johnny Mandel.  I think this means he's just performing it because the main music seems to be that of composer Eric Satie, who wrote beautiful, non-complex music.  The music in this movie adds to each scene.The only problem I had with this movie was when the end credits rolled.  Comical outtakes are shown.  These are hilarious but I feel that these broke the mood of the movie.Finally, the DVD is perfect in picture and sound quality.  Unfortunately, it has minimal extras.In conclusion, this is a great movie that will probably not appeal to everyone's taste.  In my opinion, this movie serves as a tribute to the comic genius of Peter Sellers!!(1979;  2 hr 10 min:  widescreen;  36 scenes)+++++",5,Take a chance on being there with...Chance,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,3154,"['+++++This', 'movie', 'based', '1970', 'novel', 'Being', 'Jerzy', 'Kosinski', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'movie', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'taste.The', 'comedy-drama', 'man', 'named', 'Chance', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'gardener', 'small', 'estate', 'lived', 'worked', 'life', 'fact', 'never', 'left', 'estate', 'needs', 'even', 'meals', 'were', 'provided', 'When', 'owner', 'old', 'man', 'estate', 'dies', 'truthful', 'well', 'groomed', 'well', 'dressed', 'illiterate', 'Chance', 'evicted.Chance', 'only', 'about', 'three', 'things', 'gardening', 'watching', 'television', 'environment', 'estate', 'where', 'lived', 'worked', 'chance', 'involved', 'dying', 'billionaire', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'wife', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'billionaire', 'also', 'economic', 'advisor', 'US', 'president', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Everything', 'Chance', 'misinterpreted', 'profound', 'sage', 'wisdom', 'Even', 'name', 'misinterpreted', 'Chauncey', 'Gardiner', 'billionaire', 'wife', 'interested', 'romantically', 'end', 'story', 'Chance', 'considered', 'be', 'next', 'president.To', 'get', 'understanding', 'how', 'Chance', 'Chauncey', 'misinterpreted', 'consider', 'dialogue', 'worker', 'publishing', 'house', 'Notice', 'Chance', 'absolutely', 'truthful', 'conversation', 'WORKER', 'Mr.', 'Gardiner', 'editors', 'have', 'been', 'wondering', 'would', 'consider', 'writing', 'book', 'something', 'political', 'philosophy', 'What', 'do', 'say', 'CHANCE', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write.WORKER', 'Heh', 'heh', 'course', 'not', 'who', 'can', 'nowadays', 'Listen', 'have', 'trouble', 'writing', 'postcard', 'children', 'Look', 'can', 'give', 'six-figure', 'advance', ""'ll"", 'provide', 'very', 'best', 'ghost-writer', 'proof', 'readers', 'CHANCE', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read.WORKER', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'one', 'time', 'glance', 'things', 'watch', 'television', 'CHANCE', 'like', 'watching', 'TV.WORKER', 'Oh', 'sure', 'do', 'No', 'one', 'reads', 'very', 'ending', 'movie', 'Chance', 'walking', 'water', 'Actually', 'walking', 'surface', 'lake', 'lake', 'depth', 'not', 'just', 'surface', 'ending', 'open', 'many', 'interpretations', 'summarized', 'entire', 'movie', 'beautifully.Sellers', 'superb', 'subtle', 'comic', 'performance', 'was', 'truly', 'last', 'great', 'movie', 'Sellers', 'made', 'supporting', 'actors', 'especially', 'MacLaine', 'Douglas', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'do', 'terrific', 'jobs.The', 'music', 'said', 'be', 'Johnny', 'Mandel', 'think', 'just', 'performing', 'main', 'music', 'be', 'composer', 'Eric', 'Satie', 'who', 'wrote', 'beautiful', 'non-complex', 'music', 'music', 'movie', 'scene.The', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'end', 'rolled', 'Comical', 'outtakes', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'hilarious', 'feel', 'broke', 'mood', 'movie.Finally', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'Unfortunately', 'minimal', 'extras.In', 'conclusion', 'great', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'taste', 'opinion', 'movie', 'tribute', 'comic', 'genius', 'Peter', 'Sellers', '1979', '2', 'hr', '10', 'min', 'widescreen', '36', 'scenes', '+++++']",Being There VHS

He is a simple man and apparently doesn't understand the concept of lying. When someone tells him anything, he takes it literally. He suffers a minor injury when a car hits him and the owner, Eve (MacLaine), offers to have him checked out by her doctor.Although Chance knows nothing of the real world and just talks about his former job as a gardener, others take his words to heart and think that he's using metaphors. It's funny to see how much of an impact his innocent remarks have on the people around him.Sellers was nominated for his performance and Melvyn Douglas won an Oscar for his portrayal of Eve's dying husband.",5,Sellers shines,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,1177,"['Being', '1979', 'Drama', 'Comedy', '130', 'minutesDirected', 'Hal', 'AshbyStarring', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Melvyn', 'DouglasBeing', 'unusual', 'movie', 'told', 'understated', 'way', 'events', 'unfold', 'slowly', 'viewer', 'left', 'reflect', 'meaning', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Chance', 'garden', 'old', 'man', 'left', 'homeless', 'when', 'man', 'relationship', 'never', 'explained', 'man', 'son', 'story', 'off', 'when', 'Chance', 'comfort', 'only', 'surroundings', 'ever', 'known', 'real', 'world', 'simple', 'man', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'understand', 'concept', 'lying', 'When', 'someone', 'anything', 'literally', 'minor', 'injury', 'when', 'car', 'owner', 'Eve', 'MacLaine', 'have', 'checked', 'out', 'doctor.Although', 'Chance', 'nothing', 'real', 'world', 'just', 'talks', 'former', 'job', 'gardener', 'others', 'take', 'words', 'heart', 'think', 'using', 'metaphors', 'funny', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'impact', 'innocent', 'remarks', 'have', 'people', 'him.Sellers', 'was', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Eve', 'dying', 'husband']",Being There VHS

Like Dustin Hoffman in `Rainman' and Tom Hanks in `Forrest Gump,' two other movies I'm not that crazy about, Sellers tones it down considerably.  Smartly decked out in dark brown business suit and derby - thirty years out of days, cast offs from the Old Man's attic - Sellers swiftly becomes involved with the rich and powerful when a car driven by an industrialist's chauffeur pins him against another car and injures him.  The old man is dying and the woman invites Chance (Sellers) to her home to be seen by her husband's live-in physician.  Melvyn Douglas plays the dying man, Shirley MacLaine his wife.  While there the old man becomes enraptured by Chance's simple, plant related philosophy.  Even the President (Jack Warden,) an old friend of industrialist Douglas, is impressed.I've watched BEING THERE three times since it was released in 1979.  Each time I finished watching it I think, I know, I'm missing something.  I figured maturity would reveal it to me, but now I'm afraid I'll have to wait for my dotage to figure out this ones appeal.  There are some very nice scenes, especially Douglas's last, understated one.  As always MacLaine dances between great and brilliant. I can't even find anything to fault Sellers for - this is as subdued a part as he's ever played.  I'm in the minority on this, but I think the plot is contrived and bends over backwards, finally snapping, to sustain the unsustainable and convince us that a simple-minded gardener could rise so high, so quick and gull so many so completely.

257312,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,6301590740,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[18, 23]","Hal Ashby's ""Being There"" is often referred to in the same breath as ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) due to the similarity of each film's lead character. However, close inspection of both films reveal that there is little in common besides the surface similarity. ""Being There"" is a story of a man who does not evolve as he goes through life. The character of Chance (Peter Sellers) is the exact same person he was when the film began as he is when it ends, and audiences are left with a tantalizing final image as to the meaning of this ""stagnant"" growth. Is Chance canonized because of his uncompromising purity? Or is Chance beyond evolving further because he is already something much more than the rest of us? Or perhaps the final image is only an illusion - we think we are seeing what we see in much the same way that Chance's words of wisdom were thought to mean something else. It is this open-endedness that distinguishes ""Being There"" as a film all its own.The film follows the exploits of Chance ""Chauncey Gardener,"" a simple gardener who is thrown out into the street after his employer passes away. Chance is hopelessly ignorant of how the world works and is immediately dumbfounded upon meeting a group of potential muggers. He casually points a television remote at them and tries to click them away and is confused when they refuse to disappear. This incident soon leads to a meeting with a millionaire's wife (Shirley MacLaine) who takes him to meet her husband (Melvyn Douglas). The millionaire becomes mesmerized by Chance's honesty and straightforwardness and soon Chance is moving in powerful circles, rubbing shoulders with the most powerful people in the world.The catch throughout the entire film is that all of the people who come into contact with Chance (except for a doctor who ultimately figures things out) misinterpret his simple remarks as profound words of wisdom. This running joke might seem outrageous and broad but when you consider the volume of ""talking heads"" and ""sound bites"" that have permeated the public consciousness in the current day, then this film comes across more as prophetic than satiric. Sellers' single note performance is a wonder to behold. He manages to create genuine affection for his character without resorting to making viewers feel sorry for him. Chance always maintains an air of dignity that prevents him from turning into a sympathetic figure. Watching this master actor apply himself would have been reason enough to see this film, but the added ""questions"" evoked by its closing image makes watching the film an even more worthwhile endeavor. You'll be thinking about it for a few days after seeing it.",3,"""As long as the roots are not severed, all is well.""",1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,2663,"['Hal', 'Ashby', 'Being', 'often', 'referred', 'same', 'breath', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '1994', 'due', 'similarity', 'film', 'lead', 'character', 'However', 'close', 'inspection', 'films', 'reveal', 'little', 'common', 'surface', 'similarity', 'Being', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'evolve', 'life', 'character', 'Chance', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'exact', 'same', 'person', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'began', 'when', 'audiences', 'are', 'left', 'tantalizing', 'final', 'image', 'meaning', 'stagnant', 'growth', 'Chance', 'canonized', 'uncompromising', 'purity', 'Chance', 'evolving', 'further', 'already', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'rest', 'perhaps', 'final', 'image', 'only', 'illusion', 'think', 'are', 'seeing', 'what', 'see', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Chance', 'words', 'wisdom', 'were', 'thought', 'mean', 'something', 'else', 'open-endedness', 'Being', 'film', 'own.The', 'film', 'exploits', 'Chance', 'Chauncey', 'Gardener', 'simple', 'gardener', 'who', 'thrown', 'out', 'street', 'employer', 'away', 'Chance', 'hopelessly', 'ignorant', 'how', 'world', 'works', 'immediately', 'dumbfounded', 'meeting', 'group', 'potential', 'muggers', 'casually', 'television', 'remote', 'tries', 'click', 'away', 'confused', 'when', 'refuse', 'disappear', 'incident', 'soon', 'meeting', 'millionaire', 'wife', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'meet', 'husband', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'millionaire', 'mesmerized', 'Chance', 'honesty', 'straightforwardness', 'soon', 'Chance', 'moving', 'powerful', 'circles', 'rubbing', 'shoulders', 'most', 'powerful', 'people', 'world.The', 'catch', 'entire', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'Chance', 'doctor', 'who', 'ultimately', 'things', 'out', 'misinterpret', 'simple', 'remarks', 'profound', 'words', 'wisdom', 'running', 'joke', 'might', 'seem', 'outrageous', 'broad', 'when', 'consider', 'volume', 'talking', 'heads', 'sound', 'bites', 'have', 'permeated', 'public', 'consciousness', 'current', 'day', 'then', 'film', 'across', 'more', 'prophetic', 'satiric', 'Sellers', 'single', 'note', 'performance', 'wonder', 'behold', 'create', 'genuine', 'affection', 'character', 'resorting', 'making', 'viewers', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Chance', 'always', 'air', 'dignity', 'turning', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'Watching', 'master', 'actor', 'apply', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'enough', 'see', 'film', 'added', 'questions', 'evoked', 'closing', 'image', 'watching', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'endeavor', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'few', 'days', 'seeing']",Being There VHS

Some think it's pretentious, and maybe it is. Some think it moves too glacially, and maybe it does. It's flawed, it's repetitive, but it's still an audacious masterpiece in its own way. The premise behind the film is so singularly brilliant, and it remains one of the few modern satires, a genre that filmmakers (or maybe more accurately, studio moguls) have never been eager to embrace. But Being There came out during a particularly unusual period in American film, when unconventional projects like All That Jazz, Network, and Chinatown, were made, before the juvenilia took over Hollywood, and slow-motion explosions and martial arts performed in black patent leather and wire harnesses became the norm. This movie would never be made today. Yet, when I hear just as I write this that the person who was mobbed and applauded by corporate CEOs at the World Economic Forum was rocker Bono, who uttered profound things such as, ""I really believe if we all gather forces on this and we don't create easy bad guys and good guys on this ... we can make progress on this,"" --well, could Chance have said it any better?I won't rehash the plot, and I won't even say Sellers was superb. He was fine, but other actors probably could have played Chance, as well as any of the other major roles except maybe Shirley MacLaine's. (Who else is offbeat enough, yet also *not* ditzy?) But the acting really isn't the point of Being There. It's the intellectual power of the idea behind the script (and book). It's really a re-telling and expansion on the idea of the emperor's new clothes. And despite the lessons of the film, we still see mindless sheepish behavior today in politics, in the media, in pop culture. We still see people judged by how they look, talk and walk. We still see a political system that doesn't know what to do, but always must look like it does. Being There holds a mirror up to society. It's a twisted mirror that, like the mirror in a fun house, distorts its subjects, but that's what satire is.The transfer to DVD, in a 1.85:1 format, is decent but not great. There are a few nicks and scratches, the color is a bit faded, the film shows its age. The audio hasn't been refurbished as far as I can tell in any way, and it's average late 70s sound, but since this isn't Star Wars it hardly matters. The disc also includes cast bios (only for a few of the players, though, and it mistakenly calls Alfred Hitchcock's The Trouble With Harry a ""thriller"") and the theatrical trailer, which is actually quite well done in its own right. Peter Sellers said this film was his proudest achievement, and he even sent cryptic letters to Jerzy Kozinsky and Hal Ashby signed ""Chance"" with his phone number, telling them he wanted the part. Don't expect a barrel of laughs from Being There, but there are many wry chuckles. (By the way, you might want to read up on the life of Jerzy Kozinsky after seeing this film. Talk about life imitating art! He slipped us a semi-autobiograhpical film and no one at the time knew it.)",5,"As relevant now as ever, considering who's in the White House",1012608000,"02 2, 2002",2002,3117,"['like', 'watch', 'film.In', 'fact', 'push', 'came', 'shove', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'think', 'pretentious', 'maybe', 'think', 'too', 'glacially', 'maybe', 'flawed', 'repetitive', 'still', 'audacious', 'masterpiece', 'own', 'way', 'premise', 'film', 'so', 'singularly', 'brilliant', 'one', 'few', 'modern', 'satires', 'genre', 'filmmakers', 'maybe', 'more', 'accurately', 'studio', 'moguls', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'eager', 'embrace', 'Being', 'came', 'out', 'particularly', 'unusual', 'period', 'American', 'film', 'when', 'unconventional', 'projects', 'Jazz', 'Network', 'Chinatown', 'were', 'made', 'juvenilia', 'took', 'over', 'Hollywood', 'slow-motion', 'explosions', 'martial', 'arts', 'performed', 'black', 'patent', 'leather', 'wire', 'harnesses', 'became', 'norm', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'today', 'when', 'hear', 'just', 'write', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'mobbed', 'applauded', 'corporate', 'CEOs', 'World', 'Economic', 'Forum', 'was', 'rocker', 'Bono', 'who', 'uttered', 'profound', 'things', 'such', 'really', 'believe', 'gather', 'forces', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'easy', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys', 'can', 'make', 'progress', 'well', 'could', 'Chance', 'have', 'said', 'better', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'Sellers', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'fine', 'other', 'actors', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Chance', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'major', 'roles', 'maybe', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Who', 'else', 'offbeat', 'enough', 'yet', 'also', '*not*', 'ditzy', 'acting', 'really', ""n't"", 'point', 'Being', 'intellectual', 'power', 'idea', 'script', 'book', 'really', 're-telling', 'expansion', 'idea', 'emperor', 'new', 'clothes', 'lessons', 'film', 'still', 'see', 'mindless', 'sheepish', 'behavior', 'today', 'politics', 'media', 'pop', 'culture', 'still', 'see', 'people', 'judged', 'how', 'look', 'talk', 'walk', 'still', 'see', 'political', 'system', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'always', 'must', 'look', 'Being', 'mirror', 'up', 'society', 'twisted', 'mirror', 'mirror', 'fun', 'house', 'subjects', 'what', 'satire', 'is.The', 'transfer', 'DVD', '1.85:1', 'format', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'are', 'few', 'nicks', 'scratches', 'color', 'bit', 'faded', 'film', 'age', 'audio', ""n't"", 'been', 'refurbished', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'way', 'average', 'late', '70s', 'sound', ""n't"", 'Star', 'Wars', 'hardly', 'matters', 'disc', 'also', 'cast', 'bios', 'only', 'few', 'players', 'mistakenly', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Trouble', 'Harry', 'thriller', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'own', 'right', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'proudest', 'achievement', 'even', 'sent', 'cryptic', 'letters', 'Jerzy', 'Kozinsky', 'Hal', 'Ashby', 'signed', 'Chance', 'phone', 'number', 'telling', 'wanted', 'part', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'barrel', 'laughs', 'Being', 'are', 'many', 'wry', 'chuckles', 'way', 'might', 'want', 'read', 'up', 'life', 'Jerzy', 'Kozinsky', 'seeing', 'film', 'Talk', 'life', 'imitating', 'art', 'slipped', 'semi-autobiograhpical', 'film', 'one', 'time', 'knew']",Being There VHS

I'm still scractching my head as to why this movie was/is characterized as 'dark comedy'. There are comedic moments, but like many great dramas, this is a film that may stay with you for days after viewing it. I won't go into plot details, as you can read other reviews for this, but it's an overall gorgeous look at a simple man who has been sheltered from the real world for so long that all he can relate to, and relate to others, is what he has seen on TV. The comedic mishaps that result, and the profound statements he makes to the rest of the jaded world (especially in Washington, DC, where the film takes place) are completely unknown to his character. Shirley MacLaine is wonderful in her role as the wife of the bigwig businessman that takes him in, her interplay with Sellers makes both characters take on whole other levels, each adding to the other.The cinematography and film score really complete the mood, and the ending scene, with Sellers walking off into the water, umbrella (earlier a cane) in hand, it seems an ode to Chaplin as 'The Little Tramp', his signature striding off into the distance, with only our imaginations to help us wonder what will happen to this sad, singular fellow.Brilliant...understated, subdued, and yet with enough emotional force to really make you think about all the subtexts it carries, like the meaning of life, death, truth, and character.A really lovely film.",5,Sellers' Finest Hour...,1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,1793,"['Peter', 'Sellers', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'film', 'akin', 'watching', 'someone', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'go', 'comedic', 'mania', 'subtle', 'character', 'very', 'much', ""'in"", 'character', 'due', 'great', 'understated', 'role', ""'One-Hour"", 'Photo', 'Sellers', 'role', 'Gardener', 'named', 'Chance', 'changed', 'soon', 'reservations', ""'Chauncey"", 'Gardiner', ""'m"", 'still', 'scractching', 'head', 'why', 'movie', 'characterized', ""'dark"", 'comedy', 'are', 'comedic', 'moments', 'many', 'great', 'dramas', 'film', 'may', 'stay', 'days', 'viewing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'details', 'can', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'overall', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'simple', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'sheltered', 'real', 'world', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'relate', 'relate', 'others', 'what', 'seen', 'TV', 'comedic', 'mishaps', 'result', 'profound', 'statements', 'rest', 'jaded', 'world', 'especially', 'Washington', 'DC', 'where', 'film', 'place', 'are', 'completely', 'unknown', 'character', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'wonderful', 'role', 'wife', 'bigwig', 'businessman', 'interplay', 'Sellers', 'characters', 'take', 'whole', 'other', 'levels', 'adding', 'other.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'score', 'really', 'complete', 'mood', 'ending', 'scene', 'Sellers', 'walking', 'off', 'water', 'umbrella', 'earlier', 'cane', 'hand', 'ode', 'Chaplin', ""'The"", 'Little', 'Tramp', 'signature', 'striding', 'off', 'distance', 'only', 'imaginations', 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'sad', 'singular', 'fellow.Brilliant', 'understated', 'subdued', 'yet', 'enough', 'emotional', 'force', 'really', 'make', 'think', 'subtexts', 'meaning', 'life', 'death', 'truth', 'character.A', 'really', 'lovely', 'film']",Being There VHS
257318,A4YXKE5F62II8,6301590740,Visual Bureau,"[0, 4]","""Peter Sellers' last feature film, Being There, served as a much more believable and less annoying film to his catalogue compared to the ambitious yet frustrating Dr. Strangelove.Being There features Sellers as a soft-spoken gardening enthusiast who ends up being evicted and encountering a bourgeoisie couple in Washington D.C. which then turns his life around. Much of the film focuses on his quirky episodes to dealing with the real world as much of the enclosure he experienced in the early years still encompasses him like a shadow (going on a talk show, speaking to the President). Strange indeed with memorable scenes involving him walking down a black neighbourhood in D.C. using street talk, hearing Shirley MacLaine receiving an indirect orgasm (probably too kinky for a PG these days), and watching the Basketball Jones music video and Looney Tunes' cartoons on his favourite little obsession, the television. But even with its highlights, the film suffers through an inconsistent and very naturalistic plot that almost feels like it is going nowhere other than following the warm waves of a radiator.Interesting and enticing at first but rather dull as a whole. It is unfortunate to claim such a thing about a film like this (often having so much grandeur and recognition from film associations, critics, and the Academy) but Sellers is best when doing a rather witty caricature. This is all too much like a drama than a comedy if that is how someone puts it and the political subtext behind the film feels incidental or momentary and not worthy of being listed as a ""political satire"" on some people's lists.

Sellers plays Chance a mentally handicapped gardener for a wealthy man who has learned everything he knows from TV and has had little interaction with the outside world. When his employer dies, Chance is thrown into the real world. When the wife (Shirley MacLaine)of a wealthy power broker (Oscar winner Melvyn Douglas) accidently hits Chance with her car, he finds himself hanging out with the rich and famous. Everyone believes that Chance's simple observations about plants are rich metaphors for life making him something of a celebrity.Hal Ashby's film receives a sharp looking transfer and while the film may have faded a bit, the muted tone suit the film I just can't recall if it looked quite this dull in its original release. The film has been cleaned up for its high definition debut and doesn't look overprocessed. Audio sounds quite good and is presented with its original mono soundtrack.The extras on the Blu-ray are quite good but not qutie as extensive as I would have hoped given the reputation of the film. We get a featurette on the making of the film with Douglas' granddaughter actress Ilena Douglas sharing her memories of the making of the film. MacLaine is curiously absent. We also get a pair of deleted scenes that were recently discovered as well as the gag reel which ran during the credits in the original film (they are still there, too) and a pair of interviews with Sellers and Ashby tacked on to this section as well. The original theatrical trailer is included.I'm disappointed that there wasn't anything on Sellers' next-to-last role. He had lobbied for the part when he first read Jerzy Kosinki's novel back in the early 70's but couldn't get anyone to finance it with him in the part. Although MacLaine is the only surviving major cast member there are others that could have commented on the film, Sellers' performance and Ashby's career as a direcor.

257323,ARFCORBCTKX1J,6301590740,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[3, 8]","As the film and the novel differ only sligthly, I've decided to post the same review for both.Kosinski's satire isn't limited to the effects of media culture on people and society -- it productively branches off into related areas. The satire is so rich for such a short novel that it becomes difficult to provide a coherent exegesis. But I'll try.There's nothing cryptic about the title's meaning. A man who's ""experienced"" life vicariously only through what he's seen on television, suddenly finds himself ""being there"", in the ""real"" world, which he has essentially no understanding of. He has trouble making the distinction, as we see when he uses a remote control to try to shut off a disagreeable young man.Chance isn't congenitally stupid -- he's been ""stupi-fied"" by watching so much TV. This is not accidental. The Old Man who took him in as a child paid no attention to his education. Chance provided labor for nothing more than the cost of feeding and clothing him; his development as a human being was of no importance. (It's noteworthy that Louise, the Old Man's black maid, though claiming to have raised Chance, made no effort to teach him to read and write.) The poke at capitalism is obvious -- even heavy-handed -- but it could apply to any society in which the worth of the indvidual is not of primary importance. *Chance's vapidity is a ""tabula rasa"" on which others' values and views are written. But the projection is largely due to the listener's unwillingness to hear what the speaker is actually saying. People hear what they want to hear, and ""Being There"" is also an indictment of our failure to ""be there"" with those with whom we engage in conversation.Chance's repeated ""I like to watch"" has obvious voyeuristic connotations, which were confirmed in a Dick Cavett interview where Jerzy Kosinki revealed that he liked to go to public baths to watch people having sex. Most people found (and still find) this shocking, but I've never understood why ""voyeurism"" is considered a disorder (unless it replaces sex). Humans are highly visual animals, and we all ""like to watch"" all sorts of things, which is one of the reasons television has taken over so much of our lives.The projection of our inner lives on the outer world of television and movies can block the development of an ""inner dialog"" that can help us make sense of our own lives and what is going on around us. (Fundamentalist religion also has this effect.) Chance is lost in the outer world, in part because he has no inner world in which to retreat and figure out things. His is the ultimate ""candidness"", in which everything is on the surface. ""There is no there, there"", as Gertrude Stein said about Oakland.It is all-too tempting to paint Ronald Reagan as a real-life Chance, and I won't resist the temptation. It is difficult to understand why such a vacuous idiot was elected to the Presidency, but it was partly due to his very shallowness, which allowed even people who disagreed strongly with his policies to find him ""likeable"". How can one like a stupid person who has nothing of any value to contribute? It is no surprise that, at the end, the power brokers are thinking that Chance should run for the Presidency.The film was made at Peter Sellers' encouragement, as he viewed the novel as a vehicle for his acting skills. It's a near-perfect performance (unlike, say, Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", where we're constantly aware we're watching an actor pretend to be something he isn't). Although the novel describes Chance as handsome and athletic, the older and somewaht vacant-looking Sellers is a better choice for the film, as removes the possibility people think well of him simply because he's good-looking. The other performances are mostly good, with Maclaine, Dysart, and Douglas standing out. Douglas's Oscar-winning performance, in particular, is a fine example of acting without appearing to act.The ending -- not in the novel -- spins the story in a direction Kosinski did not intend. Is Chance the fool of God? Is he so cut off from the material world that its laws no long apply to him, and he can walk on water -- perhaps because he doesn't understand it isn't possible (as suggested by the tag line on Rand's tomb, ""Life is a state of mind"")? Either way, the story's meaning is softened and blunted. Chance is neither hero nor divine.Other than this misstep, Ashby's direction is spot-on, giving the material the weight it needs to be believable. A lighter tone would call too much attention to the satire. The Blu-ray transfer is beautiful, highlighting Caleb Deschanel rich photography.Thematically, ""Being There"" recalls ""Rear Window"" (voyeurism) and ""Network"" (media corruption of the ""inner self"").The film is very good, and the novel great, arguably one of the best of the 20th century.* ""Individualism"" and ""individuality"" are not the same thing.",5,"""Candide"" for the media

In the ending of his biopic, they did an reenactment of a scene from Being There in which the maid Louise said goodbye to Chauncy Gardener(Sellers) for the last time. It was  a very touching scene. He's a kind, non-judgemental, compassionate, and loving man. He's lived in the Old Man's house, and worked as the gardener. For the first time he has to embark a life outside the house. He has no real experience of the outside world, and had only seen life on TV.Chauncy's life is changed completely when he met Eve(Shirley MacLaine) and her wealthy politician husband. His unusually down-to-earthness and fondness for gardening instantly impressed the couple, and they took him to live with them. Eventually, he's introduced to other powerful figures in the political world and managed to inspired the president, as well he attracted the mass media to interview him and go on TV. Chauncy Gardener instantly became a sensation and influence to the citizens who saw his interviews. Meanwhile, Eve was falling in love with Chauncy when her ailing husband was bed-ridden, and encouraged her to go on a date with Chauncy.....Peter Sellers gave the performance of his career that garnered him an Oscar nomination, and this is a very different role compared to his snapstick comedies.

Jamison""","[4, 7]","I would rather think of this movie not as dark comedy, though I am sure that would be the correct genre, but as enlightening comedy. ""Life is a state of mind."" So what kind of mind have you? We as the audience are invited in to see ""Chance"" as he is and then observe how everyone interprets him from their own perspective. On a practical level, knowing estimates of the mentally ill in my state range around 25%, it suggests how we may wrongly interpret those around us by universalizing our sense of everything and presupposing it is the sense of others too - without ever really finding out what they understand and how they intend what they say. It is clear to me from observing mentally ill people in conversation with those that do not understand the mental illness of the person they are speaking to just how accurately the movie depicts the results. In this sense, the movie is a training film for those who would work with the mentally ill and that should cover everyone! On another level the movie points out that as we see the world so it is. Life is a state of mind. But you can change your state of mind. When you change your state of mind you change your world. As invited guests into the mind of ""Chance"" we are offered the opportunity to elevate our mind to another level of perception. This level enables us to perceive the perspective of others and remove us from the box that was our own previous limit. This is a great teaching device for those who are attempting to show this to someone who is not aware of the technique - having never done it before. The movie shows them they can do it and should.Further, the movie is commentary and suggestion. I fail to see that the interpretation is forced. Interpret the last scene as you will - it still drives home the thesis just blatantly depicted on the Rand Memorial ""Life is a state of mind"" also repeated for emphasis by the presidential remarks.

The comedy is muted; the movie goes from being serious and thoughtful to screamingly funny (the ""bear rug"" scene with Shirley MacLaine for example).Regarding the blu-ray -- I found the digital transfer lacking. Specifically contrast, depth and detail (edge sharpness). The picture had a muted, washed out, grainy look to it that was, while better than DVD, not up to the level I've seen with transfers of other movies which are much older. One reviewer here mentioned excessive use of DNR -- I'm wondering if perhaps the master they had to work with was degraded and required serious work to make it presentable. Whatever, I am not an expert, just giving my lay impressions.Despite the lackluster video quality, still a great movie to own.",4,"Great movie, blu-ray transfer so-so",1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,803,"['Great', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'comedy', 'muted', 'movie', 'being', 'serious', 'thoughtful', 'screamingly', 'funny', 'bear', 'rug', 'scene', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'example', '.Regarding', 'blu-ray', 'found', 'digital', 'transfer', 'lacking', 'Specifically', 'contrast', 'depth', 'detail', 'edge', 'sharpness', 'picture', 'had', 'muted', 'washed', 'out', 'grainy', 'look', 'was', 'better', 'DVD', 'not', 'level', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'transfers', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'much', 'older', 'One', 'reviewer', 'here', 'mentioned', 'excessive', 'use', 'DNR', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'perhaps', 'master', 'had', 'work', 'was', 'degraded', 'required', 'serious', 'work', 'make', 'presentable', 'Whatever', 'am', 'not', 'expert', 'just', 'giving', 'lay', 'impressions.Despite', 'lackluster', 'video', 'quality', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'own']",Being There VHS

Being There is the story of an ignorant politician from the Lone Star State who served as President for two terms with a total lack of curiosity and without any clue about how to govern a nation. Unfortunately, he was not the first U.S. President to hold those credentials: Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan come immediately to mind (the last two come from California I am sorry to say).But I digress... Peter Sellers was amazing as Chance the gardener. But I have to give this performance second place to his brilliant acting in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, where he plays three characters that carry the entire film. Third place would go to another Kubrick movie, Lolita, where Sellers plays writer Clare Quilty.I also don't want to overlook the hilarious Pink Panther series, where Sellars plays Clouseau, the inept police inspector.
