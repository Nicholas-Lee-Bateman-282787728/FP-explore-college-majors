AND, the music is unbelievably wonderful. I am buying copies of the dvd disc from PBS to use to promote human rights in Minnesota.

I love mariachi music and it was fun watching these young people dedicate themselves to their music and work at being the best they could be. I love seeing teens spend time and energy on pursuits such as these rather than getting involved with drugs. crime, etc. Hope these kids continue to be winners.",4,Great video for teens,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,440,"['Watched', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'imvolved', 'music', 'stage', 'productions', 'high', 'school', 'Brought', 'back', 'lots', 'memories', 'love', 'mariachi', 'music', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'young', 'people', 'dedicate', 'music', 'work', 'being', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'love', 'seeing', 'teens', 'spend', 'time', 'energy', 'pursuits', 'such', 'rather', 'getting', 'involved', 'drugs', 'crime', 'etc', 'Hope', 'kids', 'continue', 'be', 'winners']",N/A

This film traces the trials, disappointment, and triumph of a group of American kids (of Hispanic descent except for one of them) as they mold themselves into a high-class mariachi band.  Their dedicated teacher proved to them that they could attain any goal they all worked together for.  I have to congratulate PBS because they usually focus on the negative aspects of multi-culturalism.  This was a feel-good movie that all can be proud of and I venture, they will enjoy.",4,A Good Documentary,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,532,"['Mariachi', 'Zapata', 'Texas', 'high', 'school', 'elective', 'Yes', 'film', 'trials', 'disappointment', 'triumph', 'group', 'American', 'kids', 'Hispanic', 'descent', 'one', 'mold', 'high-class', 'mariachi', 'band', 'dedicated', 'teacher', 'proved', 'could', 'attain', 'goal', 'worked', 'together', 'have', 'congratulate', 'PBS', 'usually', 'focus', 'negative', 'aspects', 'multi-culturalism', 'was', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'venture', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A
1541431,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B0081NAUMG,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 4]","This 55-minute documentary is being first shown on broadcast TV on PBS as part of their Arts Summer Festival. It follows the high school mariachi band at Zapata High School as it enters two major competitions in Texas in 2010. Their leader - a music teacher - has led this school through many championship wins and tries to do it again. (To give you the answer, would spoil the fun.). We get to meet selected students in this low economic community and hear their plans and aspirations. And we get to hear some great music - though only one number is presented complete.With under an hour - as compared to the longer time length of similar ""teacher trains the students in a school to both win a competition and mature"" documentaries - there is not a lot of time for both the story and music.I really enjoyed getting to know the students, though there is never a point where you feel these kids are in danger. (The only parent you meet is one who owns a horse farm.)The other thing that is missing is an ""epilogue"". Most of those students followed were seniors. We hear that most went on to higher learning. But we want to know more. One talented young girl wanted to go to Harvard. (So, where did she go after graduation.)The DVD won't be released until September 11th. I hope that are some bonus features included filling us in on the kids. Meanwhile, it's worth catching on your local PBS station.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Think of it as ""Hoop Dreams"" with Mexican Music.",1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,1490,"['55-minute', 'documentary', 'being', 'first', 'shown', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'PBS', 'part', 'Arts', 'Summer', 'Festival', 'high', 'school', 'mariachi', 'band', 'Zapata', 'High', 'School', 'two', 'major', 'competitions', 'Texas', '2010', 'leader', 'music', 'teacher', 'led', 'school', 'many', 'championship', 'wins', 'tries', 'do', 'again', 'give', 'answer', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun.', 'get', 'meet', 'selected', 'students', 'low', 'economic', 'community', 'hear', 'plans', 'aspirations', 'get', 'hear', 'great', 'music', 'only', 'one', 'number', 'presented', 'complete.With', 'hour', 'compared', 'longer', 'time', 'length', 'similar', 'teacher', 'students', 'school', 'win', 'competition', 'mature', 'documentaries', 'not', 'lot', 'time', 'story', 'music.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'getting', 'know', 'students', 'never', 'point', 'where', 'feel', 'kids', 'are', 'danger', 'only', 'parent', 'meet', 'one', 'who', 'horse', 'farm', 'other', 'thing', 'missing', 'epilogue', 'Most', 'students', 'followed', 'were', 'seniors', 'hear', 'most', 'went', 'higher', 'learning', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'One', 'talented', 'young', 'girl', 'wanted', 'go', 'Harvard', 'So', 'where', 'did', 'go', 'graduation', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'released', 'September', '11th', 'hope', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'included', 'filling', 'kids', 'Meanwhile', 'worth', 'catching', 'local', 'PBS', 'station.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

Children need extra activities other than just academic studies. Not just in one place, but everywhere. If a child has a goal to play sports, music, art, ect... then they will do whatever it takes to get there, since most activities require higher grades, then the child will make every effort to make the grades to participate in their choice activity.This movie is about a group of dedicated teens in a music program, which includes going to competitions.Music, talent, and dedication all while maintaining high grades in school academics.",5,"Higher grades, better attendance, and happier kids... good movie",1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,637,"['outstanding', 'way', 'increase', 'school', 'attendance', 'having', 'programs', 'encourage', 'kids', 'excel', 'Children', 'need', 'extra', 'activities', 'other', 'just', 'academic', 'studies', 'Not', 'just', 'one', 'place', 'everywhere', 'child', 'goal', 'play', 'sports', 'music', 'art', 'ect', 'then', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'get', 'there', 'most', 'activities', 'require', 'higher', 'grades', 'then', 'child', 'will', 'make', 'effort', 'make', 'grades', 'participate', 'choice', 'movie', 'group', 'dedicated', 'teens', 'music', 'program', 'going', 'competitions.Music', 'talent', 'dedication', 'maintaining', 'high', 'grades', 'school', 'academics']",N/A
