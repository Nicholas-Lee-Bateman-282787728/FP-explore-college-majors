1536206,A2VFBU6CVZ2QUR,B007R5A1YG,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","I rented this on Amazon Instant video based on the 4 star rating most reviewers seem to give this film. Oh my God! Awesome! Zak Kilberg is gorgeous in this movie! He really, really knows how to act. The movie is great because there aren't a heck of a lot of characters. It's mostly about Jacob and what he has to go through to realize that whoops, yes he IS a vampire. The dialogue is sparse but powerful. The film is shot very professionally. I was afarid it was going to be a low-budget deal but it sooo wasn't! Squee! I just love discovering new gems!Wonderful though, and very different from the run of the mill vampire junk out there. Warning, spoilers ahead. Jacob is a night security guard and an artist. He hooks up with a club-kid-type woman named Mary who struggles with an addiction of her own while trying to help Jacob out during his misery of not knowing what is wrong with him.It's a story of Jacob discovering his true nature and his true place in the world.Mary sees something in him and in his art and helps him get recognition for his paintings.Unfortuantely some bad stuff happens the deeper Jacob and Mary go into vampire-land. The LAPD's on Jacob's tail, he has a gangsta-type guy selling him expired blood packets from a hospital who gets meaner and meaner as the movie goes on. Jacob wrestles with his own conscience.Excellent ending too that I won't spoil here. If you don't believe the reviews, rent the film for 3 bucks. It is more than worth it. I just purchased the DVD right after watching the rental I liked it that much! I've seen a LOT of vampire movies so it takes quite a story to make a good impression on me. I'm extremely critical of vampire films because there is so much trash out there, but this one sent shivers up my spine and left me with a smile on my face wanting more.Only drawback to the film...never mentions how Jacob got ""infected"" with the vampire-like disease. Shows a pic of him as a young boy with a bandage on his arm from a burn from the sun so we assume he's always been this way. I'd kind of like to see a sequel just to have a little more background about this character. Not enough to dim the light on this beautiful movie though! GO!

1536208,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B007R5A1YG,Carl Manes,"[0, 1]","Not since George Romero's MARTIN has there been a vampire film quite like this one! MIDNIGHT SON tells the tale of Jacob, a lonely security guard whose nocturnal existence is turned upside down when he meets the girl of his dreams. The only thing standing in the way of true love is the insatiable bloodlust that consumes him. Scott Leberecht's breakthrough feature Horror film is an Indie sensation, a bold new take on the vampire film that proves, once again, that story and character win out over big-budget effects. Jacob, like the audience, is unsure of the nature of his existence, despite a number of telling signs that lead us to believe he is a vampire. It requires much convincing before anyone will know the truth, but no one is more shocked at the outcome than our troubled protagonist. Leberecht's subtle script leaves plenty to the imagination, dropping ambiguous clues that leave us guessing until the very end. The character of Jacob is brought to life through Zak Kilberg's understated performance, which becomes increasingly more powerful as he continues to draw from the audiences' sympathies. The glamour of the Hollywood vampire has been stripped away to reveal the loneliness and despair of living such a solitary existence. Maya Parish mixes it up by adding an element of excitement and chaos into Jacob's life as Mary in another great performance. In the decades to come, MIDNIGHT SON will be found standing beside films like MARTIN, BLOOD MOON, and LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH for the high levels of originality, effectiveness, and atmosphere that have been achieved on such a low budget.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,Midnight Son,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1645,"['Not', 'George', 'Romero', 'MARTIN', 'there', 'been', 'vampire', 'film', 'quite', 'one', 'MIDNIGHT', 'SON', 'tale', 'Jacob', 'lonely', 'security', 'guard', 'nocturnal', 'existence', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'girl', 'dreams', 'only', 'thing', 'standing', 'way', 'true', 'love', 'insatiable', 'bloodlust', 'Scott', 'Leberecht', 'breakthrough', 'feature', 'Horror', 'film', 'Indie', 'sensation', 'bold', 'new', 'take', 'vampire', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'story', 'character', 'win', 'out', 'big-budget', 'effects', 'Jacob', 'audience', 'unsure', 'nature', 'existence', 'number', 'telling', 'signs', 'lead', 'believe', 'vampire', 'much', 'convincing', 'anyone', 'will', 'know', 'truth', 'one', 'more', 'shocked', 'outcome', 'troubled', 'protagonist', 'Leberecht', 'subtle', 'script', 'plenty', 'imagination', 'dropping', 'ambiguous', 'clues', 'leave', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'character', 'Jacob', 'brought', 'life', 'Zak', 'Kilberg', 'understated', 'performance', 'increasingly', 'more', 'powerful', 'draw', 'audiences', 'sympathies', 'glamour', 'Hollywood', 'vampire', 'been', 'stripped', 'away', 'reveal', 'loneliness', 'despair', 'living', 'such', 'solitary', 'existence', 'Maya', 'Parish', 'mixes', 'up', 'adding', 'element', 'excitement', 'chaos', 'Jacob', 'life', 'Mary', 'great', 'performance', 'decades', 'come', 'MIDNIGHT', 'SON', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'standing', 'beside', 'films', 'MARTIN', 'BLOOD', 'MOON', 'LET', ""'S"", 'SCARE', 'JESSICA', 'TO', 'DEATH', 'high', 'levels', 'originality', 'effectiveness', 'atmosphere', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'low', 'budget.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A
