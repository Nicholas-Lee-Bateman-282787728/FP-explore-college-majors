There is a part where Kenny Loggins stops playing and lets the audience ask questions. This was really hoaky and the questins seemed staged. Other than that the music is so good.,4,Great Show,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,316,"['have', 'had', 'cd', 'concert', 'years', 'always', 'wished', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'When', 'found', 'dvd', 'could', 'finally', 'see', 'whole', 'show', 'part', 'where', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'playing', 'audience', 'ask', 'questions', 'was', 'really', 'hoaky', 'questins', 'seemed', 'staged', 'Other', 'music', 'so', 'good']",Outside: From The Redwoods

434882,A211VSXEOIPJQF,6304756186,"Lyn ""musicolit""","[6, 6]","Like many others I only knew Kenny from Footloose, Danger Zone and an energetic performance on 'Live Aid'. Doing some DVD exploration I decided to risk a concert. It was one of those happy finds.This is a really good concert and I liked the setting under the redwoods. He began strongly with 'Conviction of the Heart' which I really liked and it went from there.He has a strong presence and a lot of heart and enthusiasm. Great upbeat rock type numbers and some gentler stuff too - often sung with guests who complemented him well.His sharing of personal philosophy that other reviewers have referred to only happened, and then very briefly, about twice and was no distraction or discomfort for me.Footloose is there but not Danger Zone. He had recently been compiling an album of children's songs that parents could comfortably sit through and included 'House at Pooh Corner' from it.The audience is a family one sitting on rugs under the trees. There is a lovely cameo when a little girl in the audience is seen dancing unselfconsciously: singing all the words as if she knew them intimately.This is a good concert if you like adult contemporary rock or country ballads (though the emphasis isnt really that way majorly), if you are a former hippie or Earth lover, or just if you have heart and enjoy solid entertainment.",5,Definitely worth risking,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,1323,"['many', 'others', 'only', 'knew', 'Kenny', 'Footloose', 'Danger', 'Zone', 'energetic', 'performance', ""'Live"", 'Aid', 'Doing', 'DVD', 'exploration', 'decided', 'risk', 'concert', 'was', 'one', 'happy', 'finds.This', 'really', 'good', 'concert', 'liked', 'setting', 'redwoods', 'began', 'strongly', ""'Conviction"", 'Heart', 'really', 'liked', 'went', 'there.He', 'strong', 'presence', 'lot', 'heart', 'enthusiasm', 'Great', 'upbeat', 'rock', 'type', 'numbers', 'gentler', 'stuff', 'too', 'often', 'guests', 'who', 'complemented', 'well.His', 'sharing', 'personal', 'philosophy', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'referred', 'only', 'happened', 'then', 'very', 'briefly', 'twice', 'was', 'distraction', 'discomfort', 'me.Footloose', 'there', 'not', 'Danger', 'Zone', 'had', 'recently', 'been', 'compiling', 'album', 'children', 'songs', 'parents', 'could', 'comfortably', 'sit', 'included', ""'House"", 'Pooh', 'Corner', 'it.The', 'audience', 'family', 'one', 'sitting', 'rugs', 'trees', 'lovely', 'cameo', 'when', 'little', 'girl', 'audience', 'seen', 'dancing', 'unselfconsciously', 'singing', 'words', 'knew', 'intimately.This', 'good', 'concert', 'like', 'adult', 'contemporary', 'rock', 'country', 'ballads', 'emphasis', 'isnt', 'really', 'way', 'majorly', 'are', 'former', 'hippie', 'Earth', 'lover', 'just', 'have', 'heart', 'enjoy', 'solid', 'entertainment']",Outside: From The Redwoods
434883,A19ZH8QFM5M28F,6304756186,"N. Mann ""Music Lover""","[0, 0]","I was a little disappointed. But first the good....A beautiful setting in Santa Cruz, CA, all of his guests were great, and Kenny looks very fit.  The bad?  Except for three songs near the end, all the songs were very, very s-l-o-w.  I guess he was being artistic?  I didn't even recognize ""What a Fool Believes"" until almost the end because he and Michael MacDonald were singing it so slowly.  And I was stunned at the end when an entire band appeared because during the first two thirds of the show there was only a guitar being strummed, or a xylophone being hit with giant que-tips.  And there was an older lady wearing a gingham dress (she looked like the women from the polygamous set we see on T.V.) playing a tambourine or hitting a brass triangle.  Then we find out there is, indeed, a full orchestra who must have just arrived for the end of the show.  All the people in the audience were laying on the grass and didn't sit up or get on their feet until he played ""Footloose"" and ""I'm Alright"" at the very end.  I found it to be a real snore.  A shame because he has had so many hit songs and I was looking forward to a lively concert.",3,Smoothe Jazz Version of a small selection of his songs....,1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,1145,"['was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'first', 'good', '.A', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'Santa', 'Cruz', 'CA', 'guests', 'were', 'great', 'Kenny', 'very', 'fit', 'bad', 'three', 'songs', 'end', 'songs', 'were', 'very', 'very', 's-l-o-w', 'guess', 'was', 'being', 'artistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'What', 'Fool', 'Believes', 'almost', 'end', 'Michael', 'MacDonald', 'were', 'singing', 'so', 'slowly', 'was', 'stunned', 'end', 'when', 'entire', 'band', 'appeared', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'show', 'was', 'only', 'guitar', 'being', 'strummed', 'xylophone', 'being', 'hit', 'giant', 'que-tips', 'was', 'older', 'lady', 'wearing', 'gingham', 'dress', 'looked', 'women', 'polygamous', 'set', 'see', 'T.V', 'playing', 'tambourine', 'hitting', 'brass', 'triangle', 'Then', 'find', 'out', 'there', 'indeed', 'full', 'orchestra', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'just', 'arrived', 'end', 'show', 'people', 'audience', 'were', 'laying', 'grass', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'up', 'get', 'feet', 'played', 'Footloose', ""'m"", 'Alright', 'very', 'end', 'found', 'be', 'real', 'snore', 'shame', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'hit', 'songs', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'lively', 'concert']",Outside: From The Redwoods
434884,A1JAJSZM5K2IVK,6304756186,Rezaul Hasan Laskar,"[4, 4]","If you're expecting an adrenaline-driven outing featuring all of Kenny Loggins' uptempo numbers like &quot;Danger Zone&quot; and &quot;Playing With The Boys&quot;, this DVD isn't for you.It is, however, a fine unplugged-style performance filmed agianst the gorgeous backdrop of the Redwoods, with Kenny backed by a truly talented bunch of musicians and some outstanding guests, including Michael McDonald and Windham Hill Records' founder Will Ackerman.Beginning with the anthemic &quot;Conviction Of The Heart&quot;, carrying on through &quot;What A Fool Believes&quot; (performed as a duet with Michael McDonald), and a zydecko-influenced &quot;Footloose&quot;, this concert is just great to watch.Other stand-out tracks include &quot;Will Of The Wind&quot; (featuring Will Ackerman) and &quot;Watching The River Run&quot;.The sound comes in two flavours, stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1. Skip the stereo track and stick to the 5.1, which has great ambience and just opens up the sound.The video is pretty ok, though not of reference quality. Part of the concert was filmed during the day, and part of it night.
