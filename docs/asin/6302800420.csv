336068,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302800420,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I adore Dustin Hoffman and count him as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big screen, and even though his recent choices are less than impressive (what has happened to these acting giants; ala Robert De Niro and Al Pacino?) I am still enamored by just about everything he's done pre-2000.  His comedic performance in `Tootsie' is certainly one of his grandest.Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a hard to get along with actor who cannot seem to find work because of his reputation.  His talent precedes him but his arrogance and stubbornness have caused him to become unwanted.  With this weighting heavily over his head, and the desire to help his friend launch his own stage-play, Dorsey decides to go undercover (way undercover) to get a job, and so that is how Dorothy Michaels comes about, a hotheaded older woman who nabs the new role on a soap.  Her success is instantaneous, fans flocking to her and costars befriending her, not the least of which is Julie Nichols who also manages to catch Dorsey's eye.The main plot of Dorsey falling for Nichols but being unable to confess his feelings for her without compromising his paycheck really play second fiddle to the real meat of Dorsey's transformation while disguised as Michaels.  Dorsey is able to separate himself from his actions and view the world through a new set of eyes, waking himself to his own inadequacies, but also giving strength to his female fans, on and off the screen, to fight against the stereotypes that bind them so tightly.The performances are all outstanding, especially from Hoffman who is not only hilarious but also very connected to the emotional journey both of his characters are going through.  Jessica Lange won an Oscar for her performance, and while I don't consider it `amazing' it was tender and genuine and deserving of admiration (but I'm not so sure of an Oscar).  Actually, second to Hoffman is Charles Durning who really should have nabbed a nomination for his wonderfully complete portrayal of Nichols lonely father Les, who happens to take a liking to Dorothy.  His performance is so sincere and moving that the Academy should be ashamed for passing him over.The rest of the supporting cast is also wonderful, from the late Sydney Pollack to Teri Garr, Bill Murray and a pre-stardom Geena Davis.The script is brilliantly crafted to be both comedic and heartwarming, and when the Dorsey/Michaels revelation is finally revealed you will find yourself on the floor in the most painfully side splitting uproarious laughter that you will feel compelled to watch the whole film all over again just so you can see that scene in all its glory (you have to watch the whole film for a proper setup).  Hoffman and company really deliver a film that is more than just a comedy, it is a landmark and one of the most influential and recognizable films to the 80's.",5,"Funny, heartwarming and poignant; `Tootsie' has it all...",1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,2857,"['adore', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'count', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'ever', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'even', 'recent', 'choices', 'are', 'less', 'impressive', 'what', 'happened', 'acting', 'giants', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'am', 'still', 'enamored', 'just', 'everything', 'done', 'pre-2000', 'comedic', 'performance', 'Tootsie', 'certainly', 'one', 'grandest.Hoffman', 'Michael', 'Dorsey', 'hard', 'get', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'find', 'work', 'reputation', 'talent', 'arrogance', 'stubbornness', 'have', 'caused', 'become', 'unwanted', 'weighting', 'heavily', 'head', 'desire', 'help', 'friend', 'own', 'stage-play', 'Dorsey', 'go', 'undercover', 'way', 'undercover', 'get', 'job', 'so', 'how', 'Dorothy', 'Michaels', 'about', 'hotheaded', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'new', 'role', 'soap', 'success', 'instantaneous', 'fans', 'flocking', 'costars', 'befriending', 'not', 'least', 'Julie', 'Nichols', 'who', 'also', 'catch', 'Dorsey', 'eye.The', 'main', 'plot', 'Dorsey', 'falling', 'Nichols', 'being', 'unable', 'confess', 'feelings', 'compromising', 'paycheck', 'really', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'real', 'meat', 'Dorsey', 'transformation', 'while', 'disguised', 'Michaels', 'Dorsey', 'able', 'separate', 'actions', 'view', 'world', 'new', 'set', 'eyes', 'waking', 'own', 'inadequacies', 'also', 'giving', 'strength', 'female', 'fans', 'screen', 'fight', 'stereotypes', 'bind', 'so', 'tightly.The', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'hilarious', 'also', 'very', 'connected', 'emotional', 'journey', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'amazing', 'was', 'tender', 'genuine', 'deserving', 'admiration', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'Oscar', 'Actually', 'second', 'Hoffman', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'nabbed', 'nomination', 'wonderfully', 'complete', 'portrayal', 'Nichols', 'lonely', 'father', 'Les', 'who', 'take', 'liking', 'Dorothy', 'performance', 'so', 'sincere', 'moving', 'Academy', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'passing', 'over.The', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'wonderful', 'late', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'pre-stardom', 'Geena', 'Davis.The', 'script', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'be', 'comedic', 'heartwarming', 'when', 'Dorsey/Michaels', 'revelation', 'finally', 'revealed', 'will', 'find', 'floor', 'most', 'painfully', 'side', 'splitting', 'uproarious', 'laughter', 'will', 'feel', 'compelled', 'watch', 'whole', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'just', 'can', 'see', 'scene', 'glory', 'have', 'watch', 'whole', 'film', 'proper', 'setup', 'Hoffman', 'company', 'really', 'deliver', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'comedy', 'landmark', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'recognizable', 'films', '80']",Tootsie VHS

I don't know if that's true or not, but if it is true, it's a real tragedy. In my opinion, this is one of the best comedies ever made. It's somewhere between the blatant slapstick of &quot;The Great Race&quot; and the witty sophistication of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, and it doesn't have a car chase in it, but this movie is nonstop funny from beginning to end. There is humor in just about every scene, and funny lines abound. Dustin Hoffman, one of the best actors of his generation, gives one of his best peformances as a tempermental actor who can't get a job and secretly tries out for a female role on a big daytime soap opera in drag. Of course, he gets the part and becomes enormously popular, largely because he refuses to put up with the crap that other actresses put up with. Not only is Hoffman excellent, but the rest of the cast is also outstanding. Jessica Lange got a best supporting actress oscar. The oscar for best picture should have landed here, as well.

In a desperate act to get work he disguises himself as Dorothy Michaels, an older Southern woman, and lands a job in a soap opera. Soon he finds not only is he a better person as a woman, but he is falling in love with his costar, played by Jessica Lange.TOOTSIE has a complex and superb script, and great performances all around. Bill Murray is a standout as Hoffman's writer/roomate, as is Sydney Pollack who cast himself as the troublesome actor's agent, who has to cope with his client's antics. Also, surprisingly, TOOTSIE's cinematography is very expressive and of a high quality.The real highlight of TOOTSIE is not Dustin Hoffman in a dress, but rather the film's complex messages. One thing TOOTSIE comment's on is society's resentment of powerful or assertive women, and how meeker or more submissive women are often times used and taken advantage of. The film also relates how unattractive women are usually overlooked by men, because they are judged physically and not by their personalities.TOOTSIE is a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of MRS.

Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray and Teri Garr star in this keenly observed Sydney Pollack gem with a genuine New York showbusiness background.Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is New York's most untouchable, unemployable actor.  No one in the business is prepared to work with him, and he's reduced to operating as an acting coach for others who can't seem to land a break in the industry, including painfully awkward Sandy (Teri Garr).  Finally, in a last-ditch bid to find a role - any role - Michael frocks up as ""Dorothy Michaels"" and lands a job on top-rating TV soap ""Southwest General"".Playing the no-nonsense chief of staff Emily Kimberley, ""Dorothy"" wins thousands of female fans all over the country.  But when Michael starts falling in love with co-star Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange) - who has well and truly taken the endearing ""Dorothy"" to heart as her best friend - how on earth will Michael reveal himself without destroying his/her trust relationship with Julie in the process?...TOOTSIE is one of those rare films I could sit through several times a week and never get bored with.  This is mainly due to the incredible performances but props must also be given to the outstanding screenplay from Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal.

The first extras that I looked at were the deleted scenes; there are quite a few short ones here, none of which really deserved to be inserted. Some are mildly amusing, some shouldn't have even been shot in the first place. OK, one extra down, two to go. Next I looked at Dustin Hoffman's ""screen test."" Source material are original betamax tapes of Dustin first doing the Dorothy Michaels character. Although theses tests are very short, they are extremely relevatory into the talents of Hoffman. Between the time he filmed these initial test and the time that his final character was put on film, Hoffman transitioned from a bad drag queen into a believable female. Truly incredible to compare the two performances which are roughly 3 years apart. 2nd extra down, last one to go: ""The Making Of"" documentary. I had no expectations of this whatsoever; expecting a 20 minute assortment of clips and a little narration, instead, we are treated to about an hour and a half of indepth interviews and insight into the creation of this comedy classic. There are current interviews from Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Terri Garr, and Sydney Pollack. The only major player missing is Murray, but it doesn't detract from the documentary. We learn that this movie is one of those amazing occurrances where the right creative team comes together; Hoffman is a difficult to control idea-man who definitely needs to be steered and somewhat restrained. As the Director, Pollack supplied this excellent guidance, and rather than play the movie for bawdy laughter, he went for honesty and truth. Elaine May also apparently gave the film its momentum and helped build all of the intertwined stories that lead to the exciting conclusion of the live Soap Opera reveal at the climax. Bill Murray and Terri Garr gave many classic improv moments, and Jessica Lange gives a very sweet and honest ""straight"" performance. In the interviews, Dabney Coleman tells how nobody ever laughed on the set; it was the editing of Pollack that made all the humor work, and when looking at the movie after hearing this, it is obvious to see the truth in his statement. This documentary all has many behind-the-scenes clips and confrontations between Pollack and Hoffman, who pushed the director to try every possible route and questioned everything about the movie. Large gripe - why couldn't the theatrical trailer have been put on here? It was on the barebones previous release...surely it could have fit on this DVD, too.For those not familiar with the plot, here it is: Michael Dorsey is a talented but exasperating NYC actor (much like Hoffman apparently) who nobody wants to work with; he drives up budgets and is difficult to work with. Desperate for money, he disguises himself as a woman to win a role on a soap opera. After he gets the role, he must keep it a secret from his girlfriend (Terri Garr), his costar Julie (Jessica Lange) with whom he has fallen for, and from Julie's dad (Charles Durning) who has fallen for him, thinking he is a woman.

Pawl ""Dani""","[1, 1]","It was a close race for Dustin Hoffman, in 1982, when he was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award, along with Ben Kingsley, for Ghandi.  Kingsley went on to win the award for his brilliant performance as the revolutionary Indian peace maker, but, if it hadn't been for that tough shut out in the Oscars race, Hoffman could've taken home the little golden man for himself, that year.  This is a great, great film that I think is enjoyable on many levels.  For starters, Hoffman's comic timing is showcased here, as his character, Michael Dorsey, an unemployed, down-on-his-luck actor takes on an alter ego in Dorothy Michaels.  Michaels is an outspoken, dowdy and very sassy middle aged woman who lands a major part on a daytime soap--launching his/her career.Not only is the humor fast and furious, in this movie, but it is also a touching portrayal of a man best-described as a chauvinist, who goes through an epiphany when he takes on the identity of a woman.  He has to do some soul searching as to how he relates to women in the world, and the general attitude men in society have toward the ""weaker/second sex.""I highly reccomend this.",5,"sooooo funny, entertaining and marvelous",1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,1146,"['was', 'close', 'race', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', '1982', 'when', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Ghandi', 'Kingsley', 'went', 'win', 'award', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'revolutionary', 'Indian', 'peace', 'maker', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'tough', 'shut', 'out', 'Oscars', 'race', 'Hoffman', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'home', 'little', 'golden', 'man', 'year', 'great', 'great', 'film', 'think', 'enjoyable', 'many', 'levels', 'starters', 'Hoffman', 'comic', 'timing', 'showcased', 'here', 'character', 'Michael', 'Dorsey', 'unemployed', 'down-on-his-luck', 'actor', 'alter', 'ego', 'Dorothy', 'Michaels', 'Michaels', 'outspoken', 'dowdy', 'very', 'sassy', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'who', 'major', 'part', 'daytime', 'soap', 'launching', 'career.Not', 'only', 'humor', 'fast', 'furious', 'movie', 'also', 'touching', 'portrayal', 'man', 'best-described', 'chauvinist', 'who', 'epiphany', 'when', 'identity', 'woman', 'do', 'soul', 'searching', 'how', 'women', 'world', 'general', 'attitude', 'men', 'society', 'have', 'weaker/second', 'sex', 'highly', 'reccomend']",Tootsie VHS

I think this is probably his best acting ever.  He is hilarious as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels.He is playing an out of work actor, a very out of work actor who wants a  job so desperately.  He decides to dress in women's clothes and try to get  a job as a woman.  He does a better job there!  He lands a job on a soap  opera, and his character, Dorothy Michaels is adored by the fans, and one  older doctor on staff, played by Uncle Henry from Punky  Brewster.Dorothy/Michael takes things in stride and soons learns a great  deal about himself and how he is with women.I recently viewed Tootsie  again.  I had seen it in the movies when it came out at least twice. This  is one of the best comedies of all time.  The screenplay for this movie is  awesome. Hoffman gets some of the best lines ever heard on film. Bill  Murray gets a couple of good lines too.  He was very good in this movie.  Jessica Lange was outstanding, and very deservant of her Best supporting  Actress award.  She was perfect in this film, not a single flaw.  The  acting from everyone was just great.  When &quot;Dorothy&quot; decides to  reveal the real truth on live t.v. is one of the best movie scenes of all  time.  There isn't a scene in this movie I didn't like.

336109,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,6302800420,Frederick Baptist,"[1, 1]","I'm not sure which film came out first but the similarities between the two are obvious: Man pretends to be a woman to get a desperately needed job but ends up falling in love with a woman and doesn't know how to tell her resulting in humourous events versus woman pretends to be a man who pretends to be a woman to get a desperately needed job but ends up falling in love with a man and doesn't know how to tell him resulting in humourous events.  The most important similarity though is that both films age pretty well and remains entertaining to this day although ""Victor/Victoria"" in my opinion has the edge in terms of better aging and retention of entertainment value.I found ""Tootsie"" extremely side-splittingly funny the first time I saw it many years ago but as is to be expected with comedies in general in that they are made for the audiences of that time i.e. 1980s here and there are only so many times you can hear a joke before it becomes cliched and just contempt-inducing which is why ""Tootsie"" is so good in that it is still able to retain much of its humour and entertainment value like all classic films should.  The scenes with Pollack and Hoffman I found to be the most entertaining and humourous and I was impressed at director Pollack's acting skills as I thought he was very, very funny in his role as Michael Dorsey's agent.  The cast in general was also very good which is not surprising when you have Bill Murray, Jessica Lange and Teri Garr on board.The sound quality of this dvd version is pretty good having been given the 5.1 Surround treatment although the picture quality has not been restored giving it a very good VHS quality feel although thankfully very few imperfections such as white spots are noticeable so that overall the picture quality is acceptable.  There are no special features to mention although the anamorphic widescreen side of the disc is the much better way to view this as the full screen version side of the disc just takes too much of the picture away to the point that whole actors are left out of many frames when you compare it with the widescreen version.Overall an acceptably good dvd standard format version of a good comedy that ages well although the great Dave Grusin soundtrack does have a downside of dating this film with its 80s sounding theme making sure you know that this is an 80s flick.

This movie has  perfect timing -- just that rhythm that makes you laugh. I won't  overanalyze. But man, it works. Scene after scene just works. You never hit  a false note.What movie ever kick started more character actors'  careers? Dabney Coleman made hay for about a decade in spinoffs of his  creepy director. Geena Davis had just a few lines, but her career really  only started when Dorothy Michaels gave her some &quot;tips&quot; in the  dressing room. Doctor Brewster is a blustery, flustered riot; he got some  TV roles from this movie. Jessica Lange got an Oscar -- maybe the only one  for this movie, which was a travesty. Sidney Pollack, playing Michael  Dorsey's agent while he directed, gets some amazing laughs. And when you  watch the movie, you'll see a bunch more little gems of performances. The  producer of the soap is great. And what about Bill Murray? I almost forgot  him. Somebody really cast this movie incredibly well. Oh, and Charles  Durning. Oh, and Teri Garr is perfect. And... and...Amazon maybe isn't  the place to pick apart a bunch of serious themes, but Tootsie also packs  some ideological bang. The whole premise is that Dustin Hoffman's actor is  a self centered perfectionist, and that he figures a lot of things out  (about women, about himself) while he's wearing his wig to make a buck.  You're going to laugh when Michael's desperate to do the Eleanor Roosevelt  story, sure, but there's something there, too. If there's another, better  movie about the relationship between the sexes I haven't seen it.Cutting  it short: Tootsie is the only romantic comedy I can think of that really  deserved a Best Picture award.

Ok, the deleted scenes aren't much cop (5 brief scenes - mention of ""Terry Bishop"" but not much else - Terry Bishop we learn is Michael's old roommate who took his role on The Iceman Cometh, which is why Michael was so furious and had to see his agent early on in the movie..Ok - well, what can you say? One of the best films ever made? with an unbilled Bill Murray (Jeff) (not listed in the credits! what gives?!) I remember reading in one of Roger Ebert's reviews or something how Bill didn't ask for a credit. He very nearly steals the film!He's kind of a Greek Chorus, commenting on the action here and there, very wittily too I might add: ""You slut!""It probably is the best film he has ever been in. Rushmore is great but the replay factor isn't so great as Tootsie's.What I like most about this package is that theres an hour long Making of Tootsie. This is the best bonus feature on this dvd (the deleted scenes are about 10 minutes, not really watching more than once to be honest; and theres a few minutes of Dustin Hoffman's screen tests as Dorothy Michael, fairly early on?)But quite a lot of interesting stuff gets covered - first, the script.. It went through many different hands, lotta different perspectives. An (uncredited) woman writer fleshed out the female characters (Sandy (Teri Garr), etc))You get Dabney Coleman, Jessica Lange, Dustin Hoffman, Teri Garr talking about the film, and its clear they absolutely love it, thoroughly enjoyed their time acting in it, that it was just a breeze to do so. Hoffman's talking about his alter ego Dorothy, and you can tell hes very close to her, discussing who she was and what made her tick (and how she would have a difficult time finding a love, in his opinion, cos she really wasn't physically attractive, which upset him when talking it over with his wife)WELL worth watching, this making of..Back to Bill Murray - probably his best role. I know its a supporting character, and hes only in it here and there, but hes really quite wonderful. The voice of sanity throughout the film: ""Do not do this!"" he tells Michael at one point when hes about to go away with Julie upstate, eating lemons (a detail which makes for a richer film, though of course it makes no sense, and noone knew Bill would be eating them in that shot.. Murray seems to have had the filmmakers in thrall - at one point its mentioned how Murray was pissed off with his room in the apartment in the film and TRASHED IT!The apartment is on 17th street, which is an interesting detail - as this is a New York City film. The Russian Tearoom is where Dorothy accosts his agent of course. You get the action of the film ending on a street with passers by, very rich detail. Very moving stuff. You totally buy into the reality of the film because it looks so real. The apartment kitchen is tiny, hardly a mirror to look at yourself into, wonderful improvised scene with Sandy there..I remember watching this on laserdisc.. I don't still have laserdisc, but I think the picture quality is better than the old video (widescreen of course, with subtitles if you like)The music is lovely (sadly the soundtrack cd is out of print and only available as a Japanese import). And Dabney Coleman plays a jerk so wonderfully! ""Tootsie take ten!""A few bits were late additions to the film, curiously: Jeff's rambling on at the party in the beginning (where hes rambling on about wanting to open a play ""only when it rains""); Michael Dorsey's teaching of actors (actually, he was addressing actual acting students.. this undoubtedly adds to the films reality)The film could've gone wrong so many ways. Dustin could have looked perfectly ridiculous in drag (he does mention Some Like It Hot as reference, another wonderful screwball comedy). But the story if affecting, the support work is wonderful.

As I watch it now on DVD, the film still holds up exceptionally well.  Surprisingly, the jokes, the relationships, and the theme of the movie don't seem dated at all.  That's probably why ""Tootsie"" is the number two comedy of all-time according to the AFI (""Some Like It Hot"" being number one, with a theme not too coincidentally similar to Tootsie's).Dustin Hoffman turns in one of his best performances as a womanizing, self-centered actor who learns what it's like to be the opposite sex.  After all these years, this movie still makes me laugh out loud.My only complaint with the DVD is that there are not many features on it.  There was a lot of notoriety surrounding the production of the film, and it seems that there were a countless number of screenwriters who were hired to polish the script.

Boullosa,"[2, 2]","Like ""Moonstruck"", ""Some Like it Hot"", and a very small handful of other rare gems in the comedy/satire genre, ""Tootsie"" is a perfect movie from the first frame to the last.  From concept to script to cast to production, the result is a flawless and often hilarious film that (like the aforementioned efforts) you will probably end up watching many times.  Sydney Pollack gets it wrong now and then (ugh, the dreadful remake of ""Sabrina""!) but he often gets it right, and in this instance got it sublimely right - and that includes his own on-the-nose supporting performance as Hoffman's theatrical agent.Dustin Hoffman, in a brilliant and unforgettable performance, plays Michael Dorsey, the gifted but cranky and out-of-work actor who, in desperation, disguises himself as a mature character actress to land a lucrative role in a television soap opera.  Michael's success and growing nationwide fame in the role, however, generate a host of unforeseen problems, not least his growing passion for the soap opera's leading lady (Jessica Lange), whose father (the inimitable Charles Durning) develops a parallel passion for the ""actress"" he thinks his daughter works with.  Eventually, Michael begins racking his brains for a way to get out of his contract without sending his agent and himself to prison for fraud.  His solution, revealed toward the end of the film, has become a classic scene.  Along the way, gender inequality is slyly and cleverly explored, but the issue is never used to beat the viewer over the head.  The message and the narrative are seamlessly entwined.A faultless supporting cast, headed by Bill Murray as Hoffman's playwright roommate, Teri Garr as Michael's despairing protegee, and Dabney Coleman as the obnoxious, chauvinist television director, make substantial contributions to the delightful experience that this movie is with performances that could have been two-dimensional, but aren't.

Even though Tootsie is #62 on the list, somewhere in the middle, we ended up watching it at the tail end of the process. As part of our AFI watching, for fun we were evaluating each movie on the Bechdel test. The Bechdel test is extremely simple - it really is just trying to see if a movie has two named females who ever talk with each other about something other than a male. The vast majority of AFI movies failed this test. Heck, many of them didn't even have two females with names in them.So I was fascinated to see how Tootsie would do, and of course to watch the movie. I've seen Tootsie several times in the past, but we were watching them fresh so we could see them all in a row and examine how they compared.The story here of course is one of gender reversals. Hoffman is a brilliant but tempermental actor that nobody will work with any more. He suddenly gets the idea to disguise himself as a woman so he can get work. I wish they went more into that process. In the movie, he pretty much talks to his agent (an equally brilliant Pollack), is told there's no work, and POOF the next morning he decides to be a middle-aged woman. I would have liked at least a little more insight into the progression there. But in any case, of course, the usual shenanigans erupt with women thinking he's got a strange woman going into his apartment, men being attracted to his ""female self"", and so on.The acting is brilliant here from all sides. Whether it's Murray, Lange, Garr, Coleman, Durning, Hoffman, they all are spot-on with their emotions and relationships. The dialogue is great as well. It's a joy to watch. I was laughing out loud all through it, even though I knew the story and lines.But what had me laughing even more was the fact that I kept thinking it was passing the Bechdel test in amazing, flying colors - because I kept getting sucked in and viewing Tootsie as a female! Up until now, pretty much every single AFI movie completely lacked female-female dialogue. Even classic strong-female movies like Annie Hall barely passed - the only time a female talked with another female was in a montage scene where one mom makes a comment and another mom makes a responding comment. It is staggering how rare a female-to-female talk is. So I kept being joyfully staggered at how women were actually TALKING in this movie - only to realize with amusement that it was actually a male-female discussion! That's the only reason it was being shown. A man was involved :).Still, it's hard to fault Tootsie for something that pretty much every single AFI movie has challenges with. It is sad, through, that with two spectacular actresses in it - Lange and Garr - it could still not manage to have the two have even one talk together. A movie about gender roles and how women aren't appreciated still managed not to appreciate women fully.So that is definitely something to ponder. But in the meantime, the movie is quite funny, very engaging, and it lifts my spirits to watch it.

336155,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6302800420,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[20, 24]","In 1982, Dustin Hoffman played one of his most memorable roles as Michael Dorsey in the hilarious comedy, ""Tootsie"".  As an out-of-work actor, Michael teaches acting classes because no director will hire him due to his somewhat peremptory attitude, or so says his agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack, who also directed the film).  Frustrated with being undesirable and wanting to prove himself, Michael dons a dress and high heels so that he can apply for a female role in a television soap opera.  Calling himself Dorothy Michaels, the soap opera director, Ron (Dabney Coleman), thinks that Dorothy is too ugly for the part, but Dorothy's dominance earns 'her' the right to a screen test and 'she' gets hired!  As the film progresses, Michael's pretense as a woman earns him the stardom and recognition that he longed for.  However, it also gets him into trouble not only with a woman that he's dating, Sandy (Teri Garr), but also with two of the regular stars from the soap opera, Julie (Jessica Lange) and John Van Horn (George Gaynes).With an excellent script, superb acting and a hilarious story, it was completely unsurprising that ""Tootsie"" earned 10 Oscar nominations, including nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (Syndey Pollack), Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay.  Dustin Hoffman was nominated for Best Actor and both Teri Garr and Jessica Lange were nominated for Best Supporting Actress.  Of all the Oscar nominations, only Jessica Lange won the Oscar.  Dustin Hoffman won the Golden Globe for Best Actor, as did Jessica Lange for Best Supporting Actress.  The number of Oscar nominations that the film earned demonstrated the many strengths of the film, not to mention that the film will keep you laughing and fully engaged!Other very memorable characters in the film include Julie's father Les (Charles Durning), Michael's roommate Jeff (Bill Murray), soap opera producer Rita (Doris Belack) and soap opera nurse April (a young Geena Davis).If you enjoy films such as ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959) and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" (1993), you will more than likely enjoy ""Tootsie"" equally as well.

I'm not sure if I'd rank it that high, but I do agree, it's a great, almost perfect comedy. There's a lot of movies built around a similar premise of a man trying to impersonate a female, but what makes ""Tootsie"" stand out is how it never gets too low-brow and how it explores every worthy nuance of that premise.It's pretty amazing how well this film works as both popcorn entertainment and as a feminist classic. Lots of pictures have tried to be both, like ""What Women Want,"" but fail miserably because they're either not funny/entertaining at all or really shallow or even dumb. The comedy never lets up in ""Tootsie,"" but Michael's (Dustin Hoffman's character) growing sympathy and understanding of what it's like to be a woman is always there. I was pretty surprised at how much this picture meant to Hoffman when he interviewed for it on CBS. A surprisingly emotional interview, he basically said that before the picture, he was 'brainwashed' at how he was supposed to perceive women, and coming out of it, he felt guilty for having ignored/shortchanged/misjudged so many people before because of that mindset he used to have.I don't want to ruin any jokes, so I'll just repeat that it's a very funny picture. All the performances are excellent, especially Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange. The only real complaint I have is the music, which feels a bit too dated.As for the DVD, this was released fairly recently, and it seems to be a good transfer from an excellent print. You get an anamorphic picture, which is great if you have a widescreen set, and there's a new 5.1 mix but it's not exactly a sophisticated soundtrack. It's also a two-sided disc, full-frame on one side, widesceen on the other, but each side only has about 4.1 GB of data, meaning the resolution isn't going to be great, and it shows in the long-shots and even medium shots where the facial details don't seem very defined. No real extras, which is unfortunate because even if they can't get Pollack, Hoffman, Lange, Garr, Murray, etc. to do commentary, there's plenty of available material that would've been nice (like Hoffman's emotional interview).

He is temperamental and demanding, refusing to cooperate with direction and will not compromise his art.  When his agent, Sidney Pollack, tells him that he will never be hired for any job, Michael decides to show him.  In a classic &#34;Say WHAAAA???!&#34;  moment when we see him emerge from a crowd scene dressed as a woman, Michael reinvents himself as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and auditions for a soap.  He gets the part and now has steady work, but he becomes a phenomenon with the public.  She's not afraid to stand up and speak her mind to anyone, especially to her sexist director Dabney Coleman or challenge anyone, she becomes a force to be reconed with.  There are so many screwball comedy antics and hilarious things going on you almost can't name them all.  She becomes so many things you almost can't count them.  Michael is a neurotic guy who can't seem to hold it all together but recovers as best he can here and there.  Terri Garr has a nice role as his all of a sudden girlfriend (in one of the greatest recovery scenes ever when she catches him about to try on her dress), and Bill Murray, the only one who knows the secret, plays his typical exasperation and subtle humor that only he can deliver.  They ever made it a romantic comedy with him falling for Jessica Lange, his costar, who is almost too sweet and simple for words.  And that song &#34;It Might Be You&#34; just might be one of the prettiest love songs to this day I have ever heard without being too sappy.  One night he experiences perhaps the craziest of crazy situations when he makes a move on Jessica Lange as Dorothy, is proposed to by her father, rejects the advances of her lecherous costar, and is nearly caught by Terri Garr as Dorothy.Words of criticism?  There wasn't anything that kind of lead to the decision for Michael to decide to become a woman to get parts.  It just seemed like BANG he decided to do this.  And of course let's not forget the fact that he is intending to get away with the lie the entire time until that climactic revealing on the soap in a live broadcast which is hysterical!  And the special features show Dustin Hoffman's transformation from a scary drag queen to a more believable one which is a must see as they test shots.  Have a good time with this.

336168,ADDBX5P9ME978,6302800420,Nick Zegarac,"[1, 1]","Like Billy Wilder&#8217;s Some Like It Hot (1959), Sydney Pollack's Tootsie (1982) uses the &#8216;fish out of water&#8217; patina of a man in drag merely as its crutch rather than making it the crux of the story. Therein lays the strength of the movie: also in Dustin Hoffman&#8217;s monumental performance &#8211; playing it &#8216;straight&#8217; as it were - as the guy who reaffirms his own manhood by getting in touch with his feminine side. Tootsie is so rife with moments of sheer comedic brilliance it catches the viewer almost by surprise.Oh sure, we&#8217;re expecting a comedy. But the origin of our laughs is discovered in more unlikely places than under the wig and girdle. What is quite miraculous about Tootsie &#8211; especially for someone who has seen the movie now more than twenty times &#8211; is Hoffman&#8217;s ability to so completely immerse us in his character and his alter ego that somewhere along the way we can still forget this is Hoffman playing a part. George Masters&#8217; impressive makeup can only go so far. The rest of the assimilation from man into woman comes entirely from within Hoffman&#8217;s ability to get inside Dorothy Michaels; to transfer the best elements of his presence as a star and as an actor into this curious &#8216;looking glass&#8217; sense of self re-conceptualized as an unattractive female that most men would find threatening to their own fragile impressions of masculinity.Indeed, Tootsie aims at loftier ambitions; its social critique of men judging women as sex objects fueled by Hoffman&#8217;s inspiring and proactive &#8216;take charge&#8217; gal with an agenda. At increments the screenplay touches upon issues of gender inequality, mixed messages emanating between the sexes, a near rape situation, transgender confusion and transsexualism; hardly expected fodder from a frothy romantic/comedy. Some thirty plus years after its debut, Tootsie&#8217;s social critique remains fresh and as plainly astute as ever. It really is difficult to critique a film as well-rounded as Tootsie. It's as real and as perfect as movies get; an embarrassment of riches: heart, class and something meaningful to say. Comedies tend to date. But Tootsie remains the gold star standard bearer by which most any other before or since can be judged.Sony Home Entertainment continues its rather frustrating trend of releasing some of its finest movies in hi-def only overseas.  The Blu-ray marginally bests Sony&#8217;s North American 25th Anniversary on DVD but it&#8217;s hardly perfect and that&#8217;s a shame. At some level, the 1080p transfer is at the mercy of less than stellar existing elements. The color, processed at MGM&#8217;s labs, falters throughout this presentation. While some scenes look remarkably vibrant and exhibit very fine tonality, contrast and a good solid smattering of film grain, others appear with wan colors, heavy grain and even a visible age-related artifact or two. Montages suffer from weak contrast brought on by inferior optical printing methods back then. Sony could have gone back to the drawing board and spent its money correctly on cleaning up and stabilizing these sequences so that they more seamlessly blend with the rest of the movie. They haven&#8217;t and frankly, it stinks!  The 5.1 DTS audio is a vast improvement over the Dolby Digital tracks on the 25th Anniversary DVD. Occasionally, however, dialogue sounds ever so slightly muffled.Sony&#8217;s import jettisons its 25th anniversary DVD audio commentary but retains the &#8216;making of&#8217; documentary that offers some fascinating insight from Hoffman and other principle cast and crew. If you don&#8217;t already own Tootsie then this Blu-ray is the way to go. It&#8217;s not a reference quality disc, but the movie alone comes very highly recommended.

His agent, George Fields (the film&#65533;s director Sydney Pollack), is exasperated and can&#65533;t even get Michael work in commercials.  Dorsey learns of an opening on a popular daytime soap opera, but it is for a woman&#65533;s part.  He decides to dress up as a woman and auditions as Miss Dorothy Michaels.  He wins the part and in the process, becomes quite popular in the role.  On the set, he meets castmate Julie (a luminous Jessica Lange) for whom he falls in love with.  Of course, Julie has no idea that Dorothy is a man and she confides many things to him.  Complications ensue when Julie&#65533;s widowed father, Les (Charles Durning), falls in love with Dorothy and pursues her.  In the end, Michael reveals himself to Julie and exclaims that being a woman has made him a better man.  The rest of the supporting cast is quite good in the film especially Bill Murray as Michael&#65533;s roommate Jeff and Teri Garr as a neurotic actress, Sandy.  Tootsie was co-written by M*A*S*H creator Larry Gelbart and directed by Sydney Pollack and was widely acclaimed upon its release.  The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Actor for Mr. Hoffman, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture and two Best Supporting Actresses, Ms. Garr and Ms. Lange, but Ms. Lange took home the film&#65533;s only Oscar.  While Tootsie is well acted and funny, it is very contrived.  The film relies on most of the same old jokes that have appeared in most other movies or TV episodes where cross-dressing is involved, but instead of giving in to the silliness like a film like Some Like It Hot does, it tries too be highbrow humor.  The film deserves recognition because many of the performances as first rate, but the overall film is highly overrated.

An actor has perhaps too much pride in his art for his own good and subsequently alienates any director he ever could've hoped to work for. He needs to finance his friend's play, but he can't find work. The obvious solution: disguise himself as an actress and get a part on a daytime drama.In the wrong hands, this could've played out like a daytime drama, but smart dialog, careful direction, and brilliant performances give the film a clever grace that raise it above the trappings of its plot. Watching Dustin Hoffman obliviously speak out against his own discretions force us to somewhat reevaluate our own views about gender. I can't think of another actor who could've pulled off that character, even those who have given great drag performances (I'm not referring to the Wayans brothers, in case you were wondering).

To be sure, I found the humor hilarious, the cross-dressing and gender-bending clever, and all of the performances first-rate. I have the same opinion today. However, in ways and to an extent no previous film had done, Tootsie makes certain assertions which have serious implications, then and now. For example, that at least some men can more fully develop their masculinity by recognizing their femininity, as indeed Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels (Dustin Hoffman) does. And the same is also true of at least some women. Moreover, this film effectively demonstrates how difficult it can often be to gain and then sustain another's complete trust. To salvage his acting career, Michael repositions himself as Dorothy so he will be hired to play a character in a soap opera. As Dorothy, he establishes an especially close relationship with another cast member, Julie (Jessica Lange), and falls in love with her while continuing to deceive her. Later, her widower father Les (Charles Durning) falls in love with Dorothy and thus becomes another unwitting victim of Michael's deceit. The eventual happy ending does not include Les.Shakespeare never devised for his Italian comedies a plot as complicated as the one Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal provided for Tootsie. Under Pollack's direction, all of the cast members provide brilliant performances, notably Bill Murray as Michael's friend Jeff and George Gaynes as John Van Horn, another cast member. Jessica Lange was selected to receive an Academy Award as best actress and deserved it. Much of this film is hilarious, it is always entertaining, but as I indicated previously, having seen it again recently, I find it much bolder and more thought-provoking now than I did 21 years ago.

Capping all of the luminous achievements here is Dustin Hoffman's most  gigantic, wholehearted, and expansive role.  His Tootsie (Dorothy Michaels)  is such a rich-blooded and fully developed character that you would swear  she existed outside the body of Michael Dorsey (Dustin's character in the  film).  The journey of one man, who is passionate about his craft -- acting  -- coming to grips with his often unstable love life, and the reasons for  it, is nuanced, clever, inventive and so very funny, filled with superb  performances.  Jessica Lange provides a mysterious and melancholy allure as  Michael's object of affection; Dabney Coleman is perfectly repulsive as a  chauvinist pig (he plays them so well); Bill Murray has some of the movie's  best lines as Michael's grunge room-mate.  Still, Teri Garr emerges above  nearly everyone with her vulnerable, hilarious and utterly truthful  portrayal of a woman clearly in love with her best friend.  Complications  ensue beyond your wildest imagination, and the comic unfolding -- before  your eyes -- of every plot twist is a wonder to behold.  This movie also  makes a heartfelt and delicate statement about the woman and man in all of  us. Though it clearly is set in the late 70s/early 80s, the story and  characters have simply not aged.

336192,A1IMNNBC4ME0NB,6302800420,ShamayimBlue,"[0, 1]","The premise of Tootsie is as follows.  Middle-aged actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is having great difficulty finding employment.  Although he is talented at his craft, he is very difficult to work with - he often criticizes and faults the logic of his directors and co-actors, and has acquired a reputation in the theater business and every other acting venue as someone prickly and unpleasant.  Though Michael gets by with his day job as a waiter, he now needs extra money in order to produce a play written by his roommate, Jeff (Bill Murray).  Out of desperation, he finds himself auditioning for a role in a day time soap opera.  The role, however, is meant to be filled by a woman.  Undeterred, Michael disguises himself as a woman, an actress by the name of Dorothy Michaels, and by sheer will and pluck, lands the lucrative role on the show.  Only his roommate and his long-suffering agent know of the scheme.  Soon Michael finds that what he thought would be a temporary supporting role as a firm, no-nonsense hospital administrator has turned into a sensation, his character inspiring millions of people.  He also falls in love with one of his co-workers, the lovely Julie (Jessica Lange).Material such as this has the potential to be treated in a lame or stupid way, but 'Tootsie' is a smart film; the screenwriter and director obviously understood the characters, and knew what missteps and pitfalls to avoid.  The humor is wonderful, oftentimes relying on subtle timing and inflections of tone, and the way the characters and story evolve is captivating.  Take the relationship between Julie and Michael.  She knows him as her matronly co-worker, and begins to lean upon him as a friend.  He is growing increasingly attracted to her but, in order to keep up his disguise, cannot act on his impulses; instead, he uses his role as a woman to truly listen to Julie and get to know her as a person.  In his disguise of Dorothy Michaels, Michael Dorsey finds himself responding with genuine compassion and understanding to another person.The performances are wonderful.  Dustin Hoffman plays his role with force, energy, conviction and humor.  Jessica Lange brings warmth and thoughtfulness to her character, and Bill Murray is a riot as the deadpan roommate.  The screenplay gives them intelligent things to talk about, and explores not only what it's like to be a struggling actor, but issues of personal identity and gender politics.

Having seen it a long time ago, I felt it must've been very much like an older version of Mrs Doubtfire, but this marvellous film has a lot more going for it than the female impersonation angle.When a failing actor cross dresses to get a job, he also discovers the inconveniences of being a &quot;woman of the 80s&quot;. Throughout the film, there's always a pleasing sense of cynical humor (e.g., &quot;I dont believe in hell. I believe in unemployment, but not in hell&quot;) and Hoffman is topnotch in his role.The from Morricone has a somewhat grating refrain of Stephen Bishop's &quot;It might be you&quot; but I guess it perfectly serves its purpose, providing the touching backdrop to the actor's increasing awareness of the strength of feminine qualities -- the touch of the baby to his cheek, the poignant sight of Julie's skirt swishing in the kitchen, the offering to Dorothy of her chocolate-covered finger to suck, etc.I can see that Hoffman must have committed to this movie bigtime, and I notice that there's a book that describes the making of this film but is currently out of print.

I refuse to buy a copy because that somehow makes it less special than just happening on it while channel surfing.I do not particularly like Dustin Hoffman - he's a great actor but he just never quite does it for me.  BUT I love him in Tootsie.  Actually, I differentiate between Tootsie and Michael Dorsey.  As Michael Dorsey Hoffman is okay; as Toosie he is superlative.  And I make the distinction because this is the only cross-dressing film where I totally buy into the reality of the character.  The role of Tootsie is the part of lifetime -and Hoffman is outstanding in it.  He has us laughing, crying, cheering, and even producing outrage.  We sympathize with his rejection by Jessica Lange (she's not a lesbian) and wait anxiously for Bill Murray's ""You [...]"" in response to Tootsie's almost rape by her plummy co-star in the soap opera.Every actor in this film is perfect - from cameos by Sydney Pollack (director) as Michael Dorsey's agent to Terri Garr as the confused and desperate actress/girlfriend to Bill Murray as the slightly spacy roommate.

The only difference in the film is Bill Murray's character: in the script he's described as the stereotypical New York playwright with a pipe and a tweed jacket with elbow pads, but his lines are the same.  Bill Murray gives the role some of the film's biggest laughs, but it's also fun to picture a droll, academic-looking guy saying his lines.The casting is wonderful.

Up against the historical powerhouse GANDHI, it didn't stand much of a chance.  But in any other year, it would clearly have swept the statuettes off the stage.This sublime comedy is a must for every aspiring actor, not only for the message it delivers about the need for talent to be tempered by professionalism, but also for the sheer quality of the acting on display.  There's not a single actor in the entire piece who fails the script.  The editing is particularly crisp, often adding a comic punctuation of its own.For me, the standout actor is not Dustin Hoffman but the highly underrated Sydney Pollack.  As Michael Dorsey's frustrated agent, and the only character actually in opposition to Dorsey's impersonation, his sense of frustration and confusion provides, I think, the funniest moments in the film.  What's even more impressive is that his character echoes his behind-the-scenes role.  As the film's director, his principle duty is to make sure that the film coheres into a logical narrative.  Similarly, as Dorsey's agent, he provides a lot of that necessary narration.  Though many of Pollack's lines are not only hilariously funny, they also serve to better define Dorsey and provide answers to fill in potential plot holes.  In the end, the audience is twice served by Pollack.  Not only does he direct with great comic assuredness, his character crucially makes Dorsey's madness believable.What makes this DVD disappointing is not its film.

He is an actor who can't get a job as a man but through circumstances, ends up getting a woman's part in a soap opera.  The cast thinks he is a woman and it really was funny watching Hoffman try to keep them from learning he was a man.  This movie was really funny and yet it had a lot of drama and humanity included.I found his portrayal of a woman more interesting and likable than that of the male character, in fact, there were times that I would get so wrapped up in the character, Dorothy, that I would forget that he was a man acting as a woman.  The cast, Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Bill Murray, Charles Durney, Geena Davis, were all great.This is one of those movies that will be remembered for years to come!

I  proudly own one of the funniest films, and it is gets watched over and over  - still to this day.  Why?  Dustin Hoffman features as an out of work actor  who takes a up a role as female lead on a TV soap.  Sound easy?  Not at  all.  To achieve this, he has to become a woman and that is where the film  achieves so much magic.  Watching Hoffman play Dorohty is so convincing  that by the end of the movie you forget it's him - Dorothy takes on a life  of her own.  The story is never short of entertaining, and features other  stars such as Jessica Lange, and Dabney Corman.  I must admit, I am not a  big fan of Lange but this movie doesnt let her steal the thunder - that is  for Hoffman and Dorothy.  Without giving too much of the film plot away, I  promise those that have not seen it a fantastic 90+ minutes of film. You'll  understand why they call Hoffman a character actor even more after seeing  it. 5+ stars in fact for this movie !",5,Dorothy Michaels is a legend,961459200,"06 20, 2000",2000,1013,"['Tootsie', 'where', 'would', 'film', 'world', 'be', '1982', 'comedy', 'proudly', 'own', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'watched', 'still', 'day', 'Why', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'work', 'actor', 'who', 'up', 'role', 'female', 'lead', 'TV', 'soap', 'Sound', 'easy', 'Not', 'achieve', 'become', 'woman', 'where', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'magic', 'Watching', 'Hoffman', 'play', 'Dorohty', 'so', 'convincing', 'end', 'movie', 'forget', 'Dorothy', 'life', 'own', 'story', 'never', 'short', 'entertaining', 'other', 'stars', 'such', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Dabney', 'Corman', 'must', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Lange', 'movie', 'doesnt', 'let', 'steal', 'thunder', 'Hoffman', 'Dorothy', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'plot', 'away', 'promise', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'fantastic', '90+', 'minutes', 'film', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'call', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'actor', 'even', 'more', 'seeing', '5+', 'stars', 'fact', 'movie']",Tootsie VHS
