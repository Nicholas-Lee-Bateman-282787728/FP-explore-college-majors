The storyline is very good.. what's not to like? I'm 2 seasons in now.. maybe three. Is it for kids?? absolutely NOT.

This show has it.Despite the &#34;drama&#34; going on, there's always a sense of hope.. a sense of shame, people striving to do the right thing at the end of the day.. and that's something a lot of other tv shows lack.. they have no moral compass, but this show seems to have a sense of direction.. they at least acknowledge and take responsibility for some of their &#34;less than perfect&#34; choices in life.. they acknowledge the affair or adultery as wrong, they acknowledge that maybe sex outside of marriage is less than ideal.. do not come watching this show expecting it to be rated G.  This is not some Christian tv show---definitely not, not your &#34;TGIF/Family Matters/Boy Meets World/Full House,&#34; no.. ... but. There is a sense of morality which is refreshing..

Occasionally this questionable parenting style actually works, resulting in some heartwarming moments of reconciliation, but even then they are just solving problems that they themselves have exacerbated. The next generation, the grandchildren, are fun little characters who seem to have an inner wisdom that their parents lack. (Just once I'd like to see a family show where the parents are not idiots!

I wasn't diagnosed until I was in my 40's.I really empathize with the characters, not just Max, but his parents and all the others as they respond to Max with his focus on rules, getting upset when other people don't do as they promised, and many other ways that he interacts with society around him. In Season Two, Max knows there's something different about his mind, though he still doesn't know as much as we do, or as much as his parents do.As I watch his parents respond to his behavior, and his occasional tantrums, I regret that I can no longer talk to my parents about how my behavior affected them when I was growing up. I see so much of myself in Max.I focused on Max because I identify so much with him, but there are so many other realistic story lines that many others will be able to identify with. Kids growing up, dealing with one-parent households, grandparents not always understanding grandkids, grandpa thinking he's always right when we, the audience, can see how often he had been wrong.

This is the most genuine, layered, heartfelt portrayal of family life and parenthood in primetime. Every week, the plotlines, writing, and character development are thoughtful and relevant... there is no need for melodramatic, soapy stories when the production and acting are top-notch. The way that the multiple storylines weave into one another is artful and carefully considered. There is a perfect balance between authentic heart and witty humor, thanks to the producers' insistence on improvisation between the actors. Bravo to the creators & production team!Further, I am floored by this beautiful and talented cast of actors... from the stunning Lauren Graham, who has me in tears every week with her portrayal of flawed but brilliant Sarah Braverman, to the fantastic Peter Krause, whose rendering of Adam Braverman's role as a father is remarkable, down-to-earth, and not at all over-the-top (he so reminds me of my dad). Bonnie Bedelia and Craig T. Nelson handle their roles with such thoughtful skill and grace. Among other standouts are the marvelous Monica Potter and a remarkably talented group of young actors, including Mae Whitman, Sarah Ramos, and Max Burkholder.The storylines in season two continue to prove that there is much creative energy left in this show... there is so much potential for further plot and character development.

1351000,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B003L77G42,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 0]","""Parenthood, Seasons 1-3"". . . .I had started watching ""Parenthood"" when it first broadcast in 2010, but got distracted by another show - ""The Wire,"" perhaps? - and it fell off my radar after the first few weeks. Recently while hitting a lull in my binge-watching, I heard a glowing review on NPR of the series, which praised the ensemble cast and mentioned that the series had been created by producer Jason Katims, who was also the creative force behind the ""Friday Night Lights"" series. That got my attention.  So, I decided to go for it, and delve into ""Parenthood"" as well.Having just finished Season 1-3, I am definitely hooked, though there are a few minor details that keep getting in the way.The show is generally pretty strong... Although new plot elements are sometimes introduced with a slightly forced feel (""Haddie will now have a black boyfriend. Amber will develop an Attitude Problem."") and are often dropped rather quickly (""Things are OK now."") Probably this is more a reflection of the difference between writing for a weekly TV audience, as opposed to viewers who binge-watch entire seasons on DVD - three weeks as opposed to three hours makes a big difference in how story arcs play out, and whether they ""feel real"" or not.Overall, though, the show is remarkable for its depth and honesty in exploring an amazing range of topics, showing a frankness about the difficulties of parenting, of negotiating sexuality and romance at a variety of ages, and about mental health and disability issues such as substance abuse and autism, all dealt with with a frankness that is surprising for network TV.  Even with its occasional dramatic flaws, the show has a profound authenticity: like many viewers, my wife and I often found ourselves nodding and saying, ""yep! that happened to us!""A universal theme among the large cast is of discovering and re-shaping one's identity, an issue that comes up at every age on a variety of fronts: teenagers test boundaries and take risks, parents set boundaries and often make mistakes, retired couples find that old issues still need to be ironed out, and can put even seemingly rock-solid relationships at risk. For each character new choices come up constantly, challenging established self-images and social roles. The ramifications of ""parenthood"" are explored in every generation, on a variety of levels: the youngest children innocently mirror their parents while teenage siblings are constantly in conflict with these same parents and struggle to establish their own autonomy, while the four grown-up siblings in the Braverman family are perpetually tested by parental responsibilities, and even by their relationships to their own parents. Meanwhile, Grandma and Grandpa have their own roles to play for all these children and grandchildren, and even their own issues with their own parents. (In one poignant episode, the family patriarch, played by Craig T. Nelson, agonizes about his need to connect emotionally with his own distant, disapproving 86-year old mother: it never stops, really.)My criticisms mostly have to do with the show's choice of locale: supposedly this is all taking place in Berkeley, California, a city I am quite familiar with. Why Jason Katims decided to place the show there is a little mysterious, given his apparent lack of knowledge about the town. To start with, ""Parenthood"" is constantly geographically challenged when it comes to Berkeley and the Bay Area: one night the teenagers sneak out to go to a fraternity party ""across the Bay,"" which is ridiculous, since all the frat houses are here in Berkeley, not in SF or Marin. Likewise in another early episode, one kids' parents have to drive to Fremont (which is like fifteen miles away, all horrible freeway driving) to pick up a birthday cake, which is nuts since there are dozens of great bakeries in Berkeley itself, a town that is possibly the food snob capitol of America. (The long drive was just a plot device to get the parents out of the party scenes...) Visually it's all wrong as well: the show is not actually filmed in Berkeley, and characters frequently refer to locations that don't exist, such as ""the corner of College and 8th"" while exterior shots -- street scenes, houses -- almost always look like LA. (On occasion you can spot LA landmarks in the background, such as the Caioti pizza restaurant in Laurel Village... Likewise, there are frequent scenes of busy intersections with strip-mall backgrounds that you simply don't see in NIMBY-centric, no-growth Berkeley.)Of course, that's all small-ball nitpicking to most viewers - the differences between urban planning in Northern California vs. Southern California don't mean much to viewers in Iowa, but the show also has a big problem thematically. ""Berkeley"" is often used as a pop-culture shorthand for something ""weird"" or alterna and totally out of the mainstream, for ethnic diversity and political activism.  But there is very little in ""Parenthood"" that merits such a distinction. Yeah, there are two interracial couples and one family has a kid with Aspergers, but it's not like that stuff isn't happening pretty much everywhere in America anyway.Meanwhile, in supposedly wacky, alterna Berkeley, we see practically no people of color other than the two African-American love interests. A couple of Asian-Americans have cameos as teachers or school parents, one Latino guy who works in a warehouse semi-dates one of the Braverman sisters, but vanishes after a couple of episodes. In Season Three we finally have one Latina woman with depth emerge - a pregnant, working-class teenager who offers to let one of the couples adopt her baby -- but her character is semi-stereotyped and meanwhile no Latinos or Asian-American professionals seem to be in the Braverman orbit. Really? This big, hip Berkeley family and they don't have *any* friends who are people of color, other than the two black people they fall in love with? For real?Of these two love interests, the character of Jasmine, played by Joy Bryant, is by far the strongest: she emerges as a fully-formed, multi-dimensional person, fluent and comfortable in both ""black"" and ""white"" culture, and seems like a completely authentic, realistic, contemporary Bay Area person. Jasmine exists as an unapologetic equal to the other characters in the predominantly white cast and she's never given any stupid, forced, stereotypical issues that revolve around her race -- she doesn't preach about race issues, she doesn't have a drug problem or a chip on her shoulder about anything, she doesn't go through any of the same-old tiresome motions of black-culture-as-seen-by-Hollywood.  It's very refreshing.In contrast, the kid-from-the-hood Alex, as played by Michael B. Jordan (an alumnus of ""Friday Night Lights"") is disappointing. He dates the high-school aged Haddie, and while their courtship provides a foil for the questionable overreactions of Haddie's parents, the relationship goes nowhere. Alex is a big bundle of troubles -- though amazingly polite and a perfect gentleman, he is economically disadvantaged, a recovering alcoholic, and so morally pure and self-sacrificing that he finally breaks up with Haddie rather than drag her down with his own real-world worries, just as she's just starting out on her own life. Their relationship had glimmers of great potential - it would have been so cool if the writers just made it work out, rather than have it turn into some big over-the-top melodrama, but the show's producers weren't able to hit that particular note of restraint. Oh, well.Finally, I have a big, big, big problem with the fact that, having finished the third season, we still haven't seen one single gay or lesbian character on the whole show, not even a random gay parent at any of the public and private schools the various Braverman kids attend. ""Oh, but this is a show about parenting,"" some may say. ""Why would you have gay characters on a show like that?""  Um, hello?  2014 calling. Not all parents are heterosexual. Your show is supposedly set in Berkeley. This is your big chance to ""be Berkeley"": there are nothing BUT gay parents in Berkeley, California. So where are they on ""Parenthood?"" Seriously: WTF?Overall, though, this is an excellent series which explores a wide range of contemporary family issues, and though the orientation is pretty lily-white and upper-ish middle-class, many of the themes are fairly universal and may strike a chord with a wide range of viewers. In particular, the portrayal of Max, an adolescent boy with Asperger's syndrome, is a breakthrough for mainstream television, and may be a comfort to families coping with various kinds of autism or other behavioral spectrum disabilities. Max's diagnosis was a central focus of Season One, and slips in and out of focus in S2 and S3. While the writers could probably hammer it home a little bit more, they don't shy away from the very real and very difficult issues at hand.Producer Jason Katim's child apparently has Aspergers, so there are scene here that will ring true because they are true: I think these may resonate mostly with families that have similar issues. While I understand the impulse to underplay some of the heartbreaking dysfunctions in order to make the show ""play"" better for a mainstream audience, I think ultimately it might be stronger dramatically to show even more of Max's problems. This is particularly true of his outbursts and tantrums, a problem that has more to do with neurology (wiring) than with ""bad parenting"" which is what folks on the outside often think is happening. Still, seeing these issues portrayed realistically on network TV is pretty profound, and remains one of the elements that makes ""Parenthood"" stand out. Also, there are lots of great performances, with my personal favorites being actors Joy Bryant, Bonnie Bedelia, Sam Jaeger, Mae Whitman, Tina Lifford, Max Burkholder and Jason Ritter, pretty much in that order. And Craig T. Russell's performance as the grandad is also a nice surprise. It's a good show - if you're on the fence, check it out.

It is alternately moving, annoying, heartwarming and infuriating.  What makes the show work is the crackling dialogue that punctuates the numerous confrontations between the characters.  The acting is also superb, even on a show the quite often strains credibility.  Is the show ""realistic""? No, this is television.  Any real life family that had this many conflicts and this much drama would be spending most of their waking hours in a psychiatrist's office, but no matter.  ""Parenthood"" is well-crafted adult television (it is not a family show) that will make you happy, sad and angry all at once.

From it's face, it looks like a total ""chick"" show.If you are married, have kids and experience the trials and tribulations of dealing with family, this is an insightful show that accurately mirrors what it is like to be married.The series revolves aroung the ""Braverman"" family. They have four kids, who all have their own families with their own problems so, with three generations to focus on, there are plenty stories to tell.The second season is superior to the first simpy because of the natural development of the characters and their corresponding families. Once you get to know and understand them, you care a lot more of what they go through.Some of the characters are overly melodramatic and annoying. That would include;the [seemingly] bored matriarch ""Camille"",""Julia"" the anal retentative and overambitious daughter (that is a lawyer) with her stay-at-home, take-care-of-their-child husband,""Max"" the difficult to care for (difficult to watch) autistic grandchild,  and""Christina"" the former mover and shaker, daughter in law.These are the weak links of the show.However, the stong, interesting to watch characters are great since they are easy to empathize with.There is ""Adam"", the most mature and clear leader of the four siblings,his sister ""Sarah"", a single mother that has made all the wrong moves yet is the closest to her parents, and""Zeke"", the patriarch of this clan that has made some made some harrowing moves that has endangered a lifetime of raising a family.As a parent, I find the story lines somewhat realistic and I'm able to relate or have an emotional connection to these antics, so therefore, for a limited audience, this can be a compelling drama that warrants tuning in every week.",3,"Reporting from the man's perspective, this will grow on you and a worthwhile series",1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,1815,"['self-ordained', 'typical', 'man', 'man', 'normally', 'would', 'should', 'have', 'interest', 'face', 'total', 'chick', 'show.If', 'are', 'married', 'have', 'kids', 'experience', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'dealing', 'family', 'insightful', 'show', 'accurately', 'what', 'be', 'married.The', 'series', 'Braverman', 'family', 'have', 'four', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'families', 'own', 'problems', 'so', 'three', 'generations', 'focus', 'are', 'plenty', 'stories', 'tell.The', 'second', 'season', 'superior', 'first', 'simpy', 'natural', 'development', 'characters', 'corresponding', 'families', 'Once', 'get', 'know', 'understand', 'care', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'go', 'through.Some', 'characters', 'are', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'annoying', 'would', 'include', '[', 'seemingly', 'bored', 'matriarch', 'Camille', 'Julia', 'anal', 'retentative', 'overambitious', 'daughter', 'lawyer', 'stay-at-home', 'take-care-of-their-child', 'husband', 'Max', 'difficult', 'care', 'difficult', 'watch', 'autistic', 'grandchild', 'Christina', 'former', 'mover', 'shaker', 'daughter', 'law.These', 'are', 'weak', 'links', 'show.However', 'stong', 'interesting', 'watch', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'easy', 'empathize', 'Adam', 'most', 'mature', 'clear', 'leader', 'four', 'siblings', 'sister', 'Sarah', 'single', 'mother', 'made', 'wrong', 'moves', 'yet', 'closest', 'parents', 'Zeke', 'patriarch', 'clan', 'made', 'made', 'harrowing', 'moves', 'endangered', 'lifetime', 'raising', 'family.As', 'parent', 'find', 'story', 'lines', 'somewhat', 'realistic', ""'m"", 'able', 'relate', 'have', 'emotional', 'connection', 'antics', 'so', 'therefore', 'limited', 'audience', 'can', 'be', 'compelling', 'drama', 'warrants', 'tuning', 'week']",N/A

1351055,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003L77G42,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I only started watching Parenthood because Lauren Graham, one of my favorite TV actors (from her days on Gilmore Girls) was in it. The show's storyline which is based on the Braverman family, explores the dynamics of being part of a large extended family, single parenting, teen angst, and marital difficulties. Also, this is one of the few shows on television that explores what it is like to have a special needs child. The storyline each week is interesting, keeps viewers engaged, and the acting by the ensemble cast has grown from strength to strength.Craig T. Nelson plays Zeke, the patriarch of the Braverman clan, who is married to sweet and gentle Camille (Bonnie Bedelia). The couple have four adult children - Adam (Peter Krause, one of my favorite actors in this show), Sarah (Lauren Graham), Erika Christensen (Julia), and Crosby (Dax Shepard). Adam is a senior executive at a shoe manufacturing company and is married to housewife Kristina (Monica Potter) and they have a teenage daughter and a young son. Sarah is the 'problem child' who married young, moved away, and then gets divorced and moves back into her parents' home with her two teenage children, Amber (Mae Whitman) and Drew. Sarah has her own set of problems - can't seem to find a job that really brings out her potential, isn't sure what exactly she's meant to do, and her teenage daughter Amber is quite a handful in this first season. Then there's high achiever Julia, who is a hot-shot attorney, married to a building contractor turned stay-at-home dad, Joel Graham (Sam Yaeger), and they have a precocious young daughter. Finally, the youngest in the family is carefree, wild child Crosby, who grows-up over the course of the show.In the second season of Parenthood, Adam and Kristina find out that having a special needs' child means making some accommodations to their lives and Kristina finds herself being overly protective of Max (Max Burkholder), finding herself irate when she discovers Max has been deliberately left out of another child's party. Their teenage daughter, Haddie (Sarah Ramos) used to be the perfect, obedient daughter, but she finds herself getting distracted by a youth worker at a local shelter, and when she begins to see him despite her parents' disapproval, this begins to affect her relationship with her parents.Julia and Joel's relationship flounders a little when Julia begins to see how Joel's stay-at-home role is fostering a closer relationship with their daughter, and how his own self-esteem seems to be affected by the perceived imbalance in their relationship. Sarah finally gets her act together and decides to go back to school, and may have found a new career opportunity. Crosby meanwhile questions his commitment to Jasmine when he finds some elements of her behavior to be rather overbearing.The stories play out well, and mostly don't come across as contrived. The ensemble cast does a wonderful job, especially Nelson, Bedelia, Krause, Graham, and Potter. It is such a refreshing change from all the trashy reality TV that passes off as TV programming these days. I'm still a fan after three seasons, and look forward to another great season with the Bravermans.",5,The second season of Parenthood sees the Bravermans facing challenges,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,3193,"['only', 'started', 'watching', 'Parenthood', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'actors', 'days', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'was', 'show', 'storyline', 'based', 'Braverman', 'family', 'dynamics', 'being', 'part', 'large', 'extended', 'family', 'single', 'parenting', 'teen', 'angst', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'Also', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'television', 'what', 'have', 'special', 'needs', 'child', 'storyline', 'week', 'interesting', 'viewers', 'engaged', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'grown', 'strength', 'strength.Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Zeke', 'patriarch', 'Braverman', 'clan', 'who', 'married', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'Camille', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'couple', 'have', 'four', 'adult', 'children', 'Adam', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'show', 'Sarah', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Julia', 'Crosby', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'Adam', 'senior', 'executive', 'shoe', 'manufacturing', 'company', 'married', 'housewife', 'Kristina', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'have', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'young', 'son', 'Sarah', ""'problem"", 'child', 'who', 'married', 'young', 'moved', 'away', 'then', 'divorced', 'back', 'parents', 'home', 'two', 'teenage', 'children', 'Amber', 'Mae', 'Whitman', 'Drew', 'Sarah', 'own', 'set', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'job', 'really', 'out', 'potential', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'exactly', 'meant', 'do', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Amber', 'quite', 'handful', 'first', 'season', 'Then', 'high', 'achiever', 'Julia', 'who', 'hot-shot', 'attorney', 'married', 'building', 'contractor', 'turned', 'stay-at-home', 'dad', 'Joel', 'Graham', 'Sam', 'Yaeger', 'have', 'precocious', 'young', 'daughter', 'Finally', 'youngest', 'family', 'carefree', 'wild', 'child', 'Crosby', 'who', 'grows-up', 'course', 'show.In', 'second', 'season', 'Parenthood', 'Adam', 'Kristina', 'find', 'out', 'having', 'special', 'needs', 'child', 'making', 'accommodations', 'lives', 'Kristina', 'being', 'overly', 'protective', 'Max', 'Max', 'Burkholder', 'finding', 'irate', 'when', 'Max', 'been', 'deliberately', 'left', 'out', 'child', 'party', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Haddie', 'Sarah', 'Ramos', 'used', 'be', 'perfect', 'obedient', 'daughter', 'getting', 'distracted', 'youth', 'worker', 'local', 'shelter', 'when', 'see', 'parents', 'disapproval', 'affect', 'relationship', 'parents.Julia', 'Joel', 'relationship', 'little', 'when', 'Julia', 'see', 'how', 'Joel', 'stay-at-home', 'role', 'fostering', 'closer', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'how', 'own', 'self-esteem', 'be', 'affected', 'perceived', 'imbalance', 'relationship', 'Sarah', 'finally', 'act', 'together', 'decides', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'new', 'career', 'opportunity', 'Crosby', 'meanwhile', 'questions', 'commitment', 'Jasmine', 'when', 'elements', 'behavior', 'be', 'rather', 'overbearing.The', 'stories', 'play', 'out', 'well', 'mostly', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'contrived', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'job', 'especially', 'Nelson', 'Bedelia', 'Krause', 'Graham', 'Potter', 'such', 'refreshing', 'change', 'trashy', 'reality', 'TV', 'off', 'TV', 'programming', 'days', ""'m"", 'still', 'fan', 'three', 'seasons', 'look', 'forward', 'great', 'season', 'Bravermans']",N/A
