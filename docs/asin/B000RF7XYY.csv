To see it again after 30 years was just as thrilling as the first time! Genevieve Bujold is simply wonderful - she portrays her character, Anne Boleyn, with such passion and fire. Such a powerful performance from such a tiny person. The costumes and scenery are just lovely. Richard Burton is Richard Burton being whatever character he is suppose to portray. But all in all, a great movie. The other movie, Mary Queen of Scots is another gem I hadn't seen in 30 years. Once again, costumes and scenery breathtaking, but the acting wasn't the greatest. Vanessa Redgrave was Vanessa Redgrave portraying Mary, Queen of Scots. They took poetic license in making her a blonde, but what the hey, it's Hollywood, afterall! Glenda Jackson is just superb as Queen Elizabeth, same acting as in the PBS television series sans the false nose prop, but an excellent performance just the same.

""Anne of the Thousand Days"" and ""Mary Queen of Scots"" are independent enough to stand alone, but even more charming when watched back to back, since the latter references minor details in the former.""Anne of the Thousand Days"" is the story of Anne Boleyn and how she was pursued by Henry VIII at the cost of his marriage and the fate of England's understanding with the Catholic church. It is both a charming retelling and one that has a particular bite to it, particularly as Anne's world starts to fall apart when Henry's eye is cast upon the beautiful Jane Seymour. For a late sixties production, the value of filmmaking is excellent; the costuming is absolutely gorgeous, and the performances are memorable. If nothing else, Anne's final speech to her husband while imprisoned in the Tower of London will linger with you -- that it will be their daughter, Elizabeth, who is remembered for her reign.""Mary Queen of Scots"" does not deal merely with the title lady, but also her cousin Elizabeth, whose performance is beyond brilliance. It does dally a bit with the facts but no one really cares since it is presented in such an interesting manner. There are some gruesome aspects that seem a bit startling in contrast with the beauty of the film, but nevertheless it carries quite an impact, and the chance to see Mary and Elizabeth head to head in a couple of different scenes is well worth your time. I particularly liked the depiction of Elizabeth as something of a jealous, temperamental woman, since she was known for her tantrums, just like her dear father.I pre-ordered this the moment I learned about it, and look forward to viewing both films in all their former glory.

1081315,A1QSZ53SD7QIRD,B000RF7XYY,"empressT ""Luv2Read""","[4, 8]","""Anne of the Thousand Days"" and ""Mary, Queen of Scotts"" (late '60s and early 70s) stand up very well in terms of filmmaking done today. The costuming is rich, the attention to detail is evident in the speech patterns, even the technical quality isn't sorely lacking. The fact that these 2 films are packaged together is a boon to the viewer; they are 2 stories on divergent paths with interweaving themes. The problems arise with some of the OTT acting and numerous historical inaccuracies spouted as gospel truth.First up is ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" (ATD). Portrayed with a gayness and stiffer than one would think backbone, Genevieve Bujold has a grand time prancing, flirting and storming her way to the top of the food chain in Henry VIIIs heart (Richard Burton). The portrayal is a good one, the issue (especially on the heels of Natalie Dormer's spot-on characterization in televisions 'The Tudors') is a lack of the intellectual factor that Anne Boleyn was so noted for. Yes, she was playful, prone to jealous fits, and sometimes self-absorbed, but she was also fiercely proud of the fact that she could hold her own with anyone in the political or spiritual arena. ""ATD"" fails to bring that across. The fact that they have Henry VIII speak with Anne while she is imprisoned in the Tower is in bitter contradiction with what he ACTUALLY did. He didn't see her, contact her, nor spend anytime with their daughter, Elizabeth. Good King Hal was too busy becoming engaged to wife #3, Jane Seymour. Strong performances were given though, a 3.5 star effort.The accompanying DVD, ""Mary, Queen of Scots"" is lucky to boast the woman synonymous with Elizabeth Is portrayal, Glenda Jackson. Vanessa Redgrave is beautiful as the doomed Queen of Scots, but her accent is all over the place, and she looks like a deer in the headlights for about 85% of the film. Once again the research teams romanticize a queen's relationships and volunteer that Mary left with the Earl of Bothwell willingly after the murder of her husband Lord Darnley. This contradicts historical evidence that in fact shows Mary was more than likely abducted and sexually assaulted by Bothwell, a fact the film ignores. Having the 2 queens meet is a popular piece of fiction (HBO's ELIZABETH, with Helen Mirren, did the same thing), but nothing could be farther from the truth. QE1 would NEVER meet Mary Stewart because she understood how that could compromise her throne.""MQS"" is a film that ends up all over the place, with no real foundation unless Glenda Jackson is onscreen. I'm unsure why Redgrave was nominated for an Oscar (unless 1971 was a really poor year for women's roles in films) as her portrayal fell very flat. One bonus was the late Patrick McGoohan as Mary's half-brother, James Stuart, Earl of Moray. A 2.5 star film.Average for both-3 stars.

1081316,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B000RF7XYY,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[1, 1]","Two for a great priceAnne of the Thousand DaysWe own the Show time series, The Tudors, and are simply fascinated about the life of Henry VIII.Now, by owning ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" we have another interpretation of the life of Anne Boleyn, pursued by the king at all costs, for he destroys his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the daughter of King Ferdinande II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castille.In 1502, Arthur, brother to Henry VIII, dies of an unknown disease, throwing young Henry into having to fulfill the royal duties. To maintain the alliance between England and Spain, Henry marries Catherine but in order to do so, he obtains special dispensation from the Pope because under Cannon law to marry the widow of a brother, was then considered illegal and incestuous.Catherine swore that her marriage to Prince Arthur was not consummated and that her marriage to Henry VIII was therefore, her only real union. Time passes and Catherine does not produce male sons and Henry VIII no longer cares about maintaining a relationship with Spain and to marry Anne Boleyn, he tries to annul his marriage, claiming that it is based on sin.King Henry VIII is key to understanding the history of the English monarchy for he is responsible for the separation of the Anglican Church from Rome and for establishing the English monarch as the Supreme Head of the Church of EnglandWe see Anne Boleyn discovering that by withholding all favors from the King, she is able to capture and sustain his interest, by her public disdain of his favor; he literally becomes the king's obsession. From her sister's affair with the king, she had learned that any woman that gave herself to the king was soon discarded for another conquest. Anne Boleyn promises to give Henry many sons and finally, she is crowned Queen of England.Anne's world starts to unravel when she produces a daughter, Elizabeth I, and a son who dies at birth. Soon, the king starts to consider an affair with Jane Seymour, his fifth cousin three times removed. Jane Seymour was a lady-in-waiting for Catherine of Aragon. As Anne's marriage to Henry VIII falls apart, Henry believes the accusations of adultery placed against Anne Boleyn by Cromwell probably because he now wants to marry Jane Seymour.The movie is beautifully filmed, the costumes are superb, and the performances exquisite.  Richard Burton provides an unforgettable Henry VIII. Don't miss it!Mary, Queen of ScotsNow we see Elizabeth, daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn crowned as Queen of England. Glenda Jackson is powerful as Elizabeth I, and Vanessa Redgrave is wonderful in her role of Mary, Queen of Scots.Mary was raised in France as a Catholic and was said to be vivacious, pretty and clever, therefore she was a favorite at French court. She received the best education and mastered several languages, able to converse in French, Latin, Greek, Spanish and Italian. Mary was also able to play several musical instruments and was gifted in poetry, an ability to ride horses and falconry.Mary marries the Dauphin Francois and becomes Queen consort of France. Upon the death of her mother, Mary is brought back and crowned Queen of Scots. Mary was the next in line to the English throne after her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I, who in the eyes of many was illegitimate.Being a devout Roman Catholic, Mary runs against religious prejudice by many of her subjects and by Elizabeth, who rules Protestant England.Mary is no match to Elizabeth who is masterful in her understanding and ability to handle palace intrigue.Mary marries an English subject, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who is her first cousin but the marriage gets Elizabeth upset because she was not asked for permission. Elizabeth is now threatened not only by her cousin's claim to the English throne, but by the marriage because both Henry Stuart and Mary Queen of Scots are descendants of the Tudor line and their children would have the right to claim the English throne.James Stewart, Mary's half brother and a protestant, sees the marriage as a clear threat because they are both Catholics, and he joins other Protestant Lords in open rebellion against his half sister. Mary becomes pregnant but by then, her husband has openly become arrogant and demanding of more power, namely wanting the title of King. The performances are superb and we see Timothy Dalton deliver a powerful, yet pitiful interpretation of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley.In the pursuit of power, lots of palace intrigue takes place and Darnley conspires to have David Rizzio murdered because by being so close to Mary, he has become jealous and resentful. A plot to murder Darnley is initiated and he is found dead soon after. James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell marries Marry but he is seen by many as an adventurer who is guilty of the assassination of Darnley.Mary is captured but refuses to acknowledge the power of any court to try her because she is an anointed Queen, something Elizabeth is ill prepared to dismiss because she too, shares the feeling.  Finally, Mary Queen of Scots is tried and executed and the movie delivers powerful performances by both Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson. Without a doubt, this is a collectible item. Don't miss these two movies!",5,Two masterpieces for a great price!,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,5239,"['Two', 'great', 'priceAnne', 'Thousand', 'DaysWe', 'Show', 'time', 'series', 'Tudors', 'are',

Stathis,"[14, 15]","The film world in the 1960s and 1970s exhibited a fascination with Tudor England as demonstrated by a number of fine films and PBS/BBC television productions:  A Man for All Seasons (1966), Anne of the Thousand Days(1969), Mary Queen of Scots(1971), Elizabeth R (1972). And The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970).  Recently that fascination has returned with cable productions of Elizabeth I, and The Tudors, and the anticipated Elizabeth the Golden Age.  Universal Studios has determined to use two of the earlier films in part as promotion for this October's release of Elizabeth the Golden Age.  The fact that Anne of the Thousand Days and Mary Queen of Scots should be released on a single DVD set would otherwise be curious indeed.  Together as a promotional DVD or separate, no matter, many viewers will just be happy to see these films released in this format.  They are both tour de force productions that show off the acting talents of major actors.  And it should be noted neither pretends to be purely historical; they are historical dramas.  And both are commendable even with the passing of time.  Anne of the Thousand Days gives us one of the better later performances of Richard Burton as Henry VIII, and a young Genevieve Bujold as Anne Boleyn, a sound script (based on an earlier play), solid production values, and a wonderful score by Georges Delerue (who also scored A Man for All Seasons).  Mary Queen of Scots suffered from a bit of a convoluted plot but a literate script nevertheless (also loosely based on a prior play), and still had dependable performances across the board with Glenda Jackson reprising her portrayal of Elizabeth I from Elizabeth R with great gusto, and Vanessa Redgrave in a very believable interpretation of Mary (ironically, she did a cameo as Anne Boleyn in A Man for All Seasons).  Many of the supporting roles are notable as well, Patrick McGoohan, Trevor Howard, Daniel Massey and Nigel Davenport.  The production is grand, and the score by John Barry is one of the highlights of the film, so much so that Universal has provided the musical track only option (with commentary) on this disc which is an unexpected treat.  This is one of Barry's best works!  The music of Delerue and Barry really set the standard for films in this genre, and nothing has really equaled them to date.  The two films counted fifteen Academy Award nominations between them.

Baker ""book addict""","[2, 2]","I never realized how immoral and deplorable were most English male Monarchs until I watched what Hal did to his wives who bore him dead or no sons. He was a demon possessed man bent on a male heir but in the end Elizabeth I, The Virgin Queen, ruled England with somewhat questionable diplomacy and grace. If I were in England, I would much rather have a female Queen if one at all. I think the so-called royals are a bore and expensive to the populous. If they were not so brainwashed by the press and their lame tradition of giving titles, they would have been thrown out long ago. Richard Burton is a perfect Hal. He was gross and weighty as was Henry. His evil shines as Burton puts his entire heart into this most famous of all roles. It is too bad his genius was not rewarded with even ONE award. He would die with no recognition as being the finest Shakespearean actor of his day and ours. I gave the acting a five but NOT the history. It is a dark time for England when so many died for nothing but fights and squabbles between the church and crown. Breaking with the Romish Church was Henry VIII finest hour. It had to be done and God evidently picked him to do it. The Pope had no right to overrule the desires of the King of England or any country. But, in this case, divorce was wrong and I do have to admire the members of his council for their decisions in NOT voting for his many divorces and marriages. He was a rogue King and a philanderer. I just think it is so wonderful that his daughter Elizabeth became queen and if he knew it, I am sure he would have turned over in his grave.Bujold did a fine acting job of playing the unloved, beheaded queen. Liz wanted the role but was too old by this time and as I watched Genevieve and Burton together, I had to wonder if her fears were well founded and that they were involved as he always was with his leading ladies. I hear she was one the set at all times watching every move the two made so how could they have gotten together with her under foot. She as even in the crowd scenes if you can imagine that? It makes for an intriguing story. The two were not yet married at the time of shooting. Trivia!I recommend this film, not for the despicable historical tale it tells but for the acting of most involved. Cromwell, the most evil lawyer in the court, was well acted by John Colicos and Anthony Quayle plays Henry's personal Bishop who was thrown out of his many manses, stripped of wealth and power and sent packing. He was a conniving old man with wealth beyond that of anyone in the realm including the King! Does that surprise any of us? Rome.

It's almost shocking to see how much dialogue is in the films compared to films in 2007.  No farts or ""Whatevers!"" either.  The history in the films really aren't that bad and pretty accurate from what I've learned.  It is true that Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots never met but I haven't seen a film yet which hasn't been compelled to put them together.  Anne of the Thousand Days sets up a more logical premise for Henry VIII's love for Anne than The Tudors TV show (which I enjoy too).  I think in this day and age find it hard to understand how a woman can dangle herself before a man for almost 8 years on the promise of bearing sons.  When she failed, she was rejected and scorned.  I think her behavior and attitude had something to do with it also.  She was a commoner who wasn't considered adequate for the throne in the first place.  Henry VIII just put another one just like her on the throne.  She was honored by bearing a son and dying in childbirth.  It is the great revenge that his daughter by the ""whore"" ended up being the great monarch.  The story of Mary and Elizabeth continues the story of two queens, one was exceptional and one was dismal.  Elizabeth was a reason to argue that women could rule, Mary, an example of a woman who badly ruled.  The movies are great and all actors are exceptional.

1081338,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B000RF7XYY,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[12, 12]","Here we have two terrific films, appropriately packaged together. You get two DVDs packaged in a single case, each individually labeled. Perhaps if the distributor would have includedCromwell(1970, Richard Harris) it would have been the ultimate CD package ever, (considering the great price in this instance).""Anne of the Thousand Days"" is the superior of the two entries for a couple of reasons. First, it stars Richard Burton whom, as expected, plays his role brilliantly. Secondly, all the scenes are brightly lit and colorful, thereby overcoming a frequent problem with films such as these.The story is a well-known one about the first failed marriage of Henry VIII of England and his solution to rid himself of this unwanted wife so that he could pursue his lust with a second, the lovely Anne Boleyn (circa 1525 C.E.) The tale is a complicated one but this film yields the story in a coherent and comprehensible manner. Henry was initially guided to marry his recently dead older brother's wife (Catherine, a Catholic), a princess of Spain whom was said to have not consummated her marriage with Henry's brother. She had a child, Mary, but produced no male heir which Henry desperately desired.In order to rid himself of Catherine and marry Anne, Henry had to proclaim himself to be head of the church of England, thus the Pope had him ex-communicated. Still, he married Anne who produced yet another female child, Elizabeth. (So do you see why the next film in this package is ""Mary Queen of Scots""?). You probably know what happened with Anne as a result of her failure to produce a male heir for Henry but I'll stop there anyway.The focus of this 1969 film is centered on how Anne, having seen her own older sister's mistake of becoming Henry's mistress and receiving nothing, learned to exploit her own sexual power over the King to entice him into marriage. She is portrayed as both evil (in her power-monging) and good (as a devoted mother). This is a pretty fair rendering of the actual story.This film was directed by Charles Jarrott and the original music (very good!) was composed by Georges Delerue. It runs at an epic length for a full 2 hours, 26 minutes.The second film of the package, ""Mary Queen of Scots,"" is of course a follow-up to the first movie, albeit Henry VIII had many wives after Anne Boleyn and a great deal of politics transpired in the period between the two. Still, ""Mary Queen of Scots"" seems a natural sequence for this movie package.The cinematography in this 1971 feature is excellent and the brisk writing moves this one right along, again a frequent complication with such films. The scenes, sets, scenery, and casting are all excellent here. Vanessa Redgrave plays Mary Queen of Scots (Mary Stuart) and Glenda Jackson plays her cousin, Elizabeth I.This film was more difficult for the writers in that Mary Stuart was looked at, and is still viewed, differently by various people and factions -- some still consider her to be conniving and evil while others see her as a heroine and a heraldic victim of Elizabeth I. This film leans more toward the latter view, so the correctness of the history here is somewhat called into question. You can tell which way the wind is going to blow in the film, though, because Elizabeth is made up to LOOK mean and evil while Mary's appearance is lovely.Mary returns to Scotland from France where her husband (the king) had died and so she accedes as the rightful heir to the Scottish throne. Her half-brother becomes her advisor but he clearly has his own agenda. Mary makes some missteps in love and in marriage which is mostly what led to her ultimate demise.At one point, she is forced to meet with her cousin Elizabeth face-to-face in England (a ""fact"" which many astute historians still assert never happened) and the meeting does not turn out to Mary's benefit. I'll stop there to avoid a spoiler but most folks are aware of the conclusion of this sordid tale.Again, this is a fine film and while it's not quite as good as ""Anne of the Thousand Days,"" it still fully earns the five stars. It was directed by Charles Jarrott and the original music was by John Barry and Sidney Margo (the latter being uncredited). This film runs for 2 hours, 12 minutes.Both movies are Universal releases and they are beautifully conveyed in color, letterbox format. When I received this DVD package, the shrink wrap had a ""Made in Mexico"" sticker on it, a fact that appears not at all to have affected the quality of these excellent film prints.These two DVDs (in a single package) are high-up amongst the treasures of my ever-expanding film collection and I highly recommend them.",5,One more and it would have been a hat trick!,1221350400,"09 14,

Mary, Queen of Scots tends to make Mary seem a victim and much too nice to have come to such an end. Nothing could be further from the truth. She purported to be a faithful Catholic, but didn't hesitate to attempt to murder her second husband and commited adultery with her, later to be, third husband. She also attempted to organize the assasination of Queen Elizabeth I at least twice. These things are brought out in the film, but are glossed over as the follies of youth. Since the life expentency at the time was an average of 35 years, I wonder how old one need be to be called a youth. Still , the actual history of her life is mostly accurate.

1081341,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000RF7XYY,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 4]","These two films, which I loved when I was beginning to get interested in history, have met the test of re-viewing as an adult.  They blew me away, yet again.  Anne1000 is perhaps the finer film (with 2 fabulous actors), but the duel between Eliz 1 and MQS makes for wonderful drama.  Indeed, they are also complementary, as E 1 appears in both and you see her origin.Anne1000 is about Anne Bolyne, who was one of the causes of the Reformation in England.  Hungry for power, she played a dangerous game with Henry8, leading him on, seducing him for love, and then grasping for the queenship.  Once there, she lost control, much because she was unlucky in the children to whom she gave birth.  H8 then lost interest, passing on to others as he was bound to do, given his appetites and character.  To be sure, Boleyn was naive and arrogant, paving the way for her annihilation by her political faults, but she is also sympathetic and strong, like a proto-feminist.  We also see the atmosphere in which E1 had to survive, which may explain some of her political genius.  It is very moving, beautifully shot, and psychologically real.  The BEST.MQScots is very different.  E1 has a shakey hold on power, being a protestant while MQS is a Catholic allied to the superpower neighbor, France.  In comparison to E1, who is wholly a creature of her office having suppressed any interfering human emotion to politics, MQS wants to live and follows her sentiment.  MQS is seen as a rival to the English throne, making her a mortal enemy of E1 and clearly out of her political depth.  The 2 engage in a terrible struggle for power that could only lead to death.  The drama is wonderfully taut.Warmly recommended.

Both films take enormous liberties with history, but the results are fascinating. The production values on both films are excellent, and the performances are very good--with one notable exception. As Anne Boleyn, Genevieve Bujold is considerably more than good, she's simply magnificent.

1081346,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000RF7XYY,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 5]","Anne of the Thousand Days is an enjoyably lavish entertainment from the days when duelling kings and commoners were all the rage at the box-office - Beckett, A Man For All Seasons, The Lion in Winter - before Cromwell and Mary Queen of Scots all but killed off the genre. As history, its better at the general details than the specifics, but it's magnificently staged and not without some dry wit and humour (""We used the incest excuse last time. We can't make a habit of it.""), most of it intentional - there's not a writer alive who wouldn't be aware of the effect that giving Richard Burton dialog like ""Divorce is like killing - after the first time it's easy"" would have on an audience. There's even some pathos in the final image of Henry callously riding off to his next bride as his last one's blood stains the hay on the executioner's scaffold. Burton is on good form before he lurched into drunken autopilot mode, and Genevieve Bujold does well as the alternately innocent and vindictive Anne Boleyn. Even the usually arch and hammy John Colicos is fine as the overambitious Thomas Cromwell, but it's the eternally undervalued Anthony Quayle who steals the acting honors as Cardinal Wolsey, even making you feel for the old monster as he falls from favor.The only extra is a brief teaser trailer.Mary, Queen of Scots was critically reviled when it opened - possibly because audiences had overdosed on period epics with downbeat endings by the early seventies, but just as likely because it lacks enough of a central performance to carry the picture. Vanessa Redgrave has always been an extremely mechanical screen actress, to put it mildly, and looking at her screen work it's hard to understand how she ever got a reputation as a great actress. With her vocal inflection veering up and down like an Innsbruck ski jump before travelling north, south, east, west and all points of the compass inbetween in the space of a single line and her movements occasionally awkward, she rarely seems in command of her performance, let alone possessing either the grace or the star quality the part demands. While never as bad here as in Camelot or The Charge of the Light Brigade, she does have a couple of spectacularly awful moments - most notably the would-be dramatic scene when she seizes real power from her half-brother for the first time - where her amateur dramatics make Keira Knightley at her worst look good by comparison. Yet between them Charles Jarrott's direction and John Hale's script for the most part manage to use her weaknesses in the film's favor, offering an impulsive, none-too-bright ""pampered woman demanding that all indulge her"" who is never the equal of any of the challenges she faces as she wildly rushes to her own destruction, easily outwitted and outmatched at every turn by Glenda Jackson's rather splendid Elizabeth I, who commands her every scene and effortlessly walks away with the movie.The script itself is problematic. Although it writes its way around the film's most glaring historical error, Mary and Elizabeth meeting not once but twice (secret meetings, you see), it's never good enough to avoid the feeling that it's winding down like a clockwork toy en route to a dreary last 15 minutes where everyone seems to lose interest: even Mary's yearning for martyrdom seems motivated by a tired desire for the whole thing to be over and done with so they can all go home. For a life steeped in blood and violence, few scenes are particularly memorable or vivid despite a couple of assassinations (Ian Holm unfortunately turning the murder of David Riccio into an unintended moment of high camp), numerous (offscreen) revolts, an execution and openly bisexual and syphilitic characters. There's also no sense of how disastrous her troubled reign was for Scotland, the drama seen purely through the eyes of Mary, Elizabeth and various plotting nobles, the people themselves glimpsed only briefly as extras in a mere couple of scenes, giving it a slight feel of historical soap opera.At one point this was an Alexander MacKendrick project with a much darker vision - he wanted to cast Jeanne Moreau as a French-speaking queen surrounded by Scottish gangsters running the country like a protection racket, with squalid, violent, muddy battle scenes that would make Chimes at Midnight look like whitewashed Hollywood glamour - before producer Hal Wallis decided the best way to have another Anne of the Thousand Days-scale hit was to hire that film's director instead and throw the battles and the history book out the window. The result is a romantic spectacle that relies on star power and screen chemistry that the film doesn't really possess. None of her three leading men strike any sparks with Redgrave - understandable in the case of Timothy Dalton's weak and eternally treacherous Darnley but much more of a problem with Nigel Davenport's Bothwell, fine with the brash stuff but lacking fire or much interest in the love scenes. But then, few of the cast seem particularly enthused by their roles, Patrick McGoohan and Trevor Howard standing out from the crowd of adequate performers without being particularly outstanding.Aside from Jackson's star turn, the film's real triumph is John Barry's beautiful Oscar-nominated score, helpfully given an isolated score track on the DVD (the only other extras are the trailer - wrongly listed on the packaging as a 'promotional featurette' - and a six-minute trailer for Elizabeth: The Golden Age). It's watchable enough but it's hard to shake the feeling that once they'd spent the money on the cast, costumes and locations there wasn't much left for anything else.",5,Excellent double bill - just
