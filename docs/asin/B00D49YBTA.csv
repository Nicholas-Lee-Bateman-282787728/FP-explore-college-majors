Sorry for the jump in genres, but he's more like Captain Picard (with an extra dose of Counselor Troi) than Kirk.  For me, it was a bit over the top (e.g., ""I'm going to make Pat feel bad for doing that!"") but it fits in the story. (BTW, the line is paraphrased from the movie and I chosea gender neutral nameto not give anything away.)And the story, actually 1.5 stories, is compelling.  There are several twists and a turn or two. Your interest will be held for the 90 minutes, whether you like to figure out what's going to happen of go along for  the ride.  It's also refreshing to see a ""copper"" portrayed who gets into the occasional fight and isn't that good at it.The acting is also quite good.  There is a fair amount of chemistry between Thompkinson (DCI Banks) and Lowe (feisty and headstrong DS Cabbot).  With the exception of Sian Breckin the supporting cast did a nice job rounding out this enjoyable, and ultimately successful pilot episode.The BBC sent me a copy of this movie to review and I'll be looking for where I can get the remaining episodes.",4,"Good, not great.

However good (or poor) the books may be,  these adaptations meet the Brits high standard of production displayed in their better mystery-detective series. These are sober, serious approaches to law enforcement and the consequences of crime for the public, the criminal, and the police officers involved. As one will never confuse Morse with Frost, one will not confuse DCI Banks with any other of the elite fictional-amateur or professional-televised crime-fighters. His character, as it appears in this stand-alone, two episode story (90 minutes), is distinctive. As with some of the others, the central foci of the professional and the private person, are often at war with each other; he is anything but a robotic instrument of justice. That makes him interesting. The lead is admirably played by a performer who makes his character apppear as a seasoned professional who is still very much human. There are some other quite adept actors/actresses, providing support, but  I will have to go to Season 1 (which Amazon writes is in pre-sale now) to know just who has made the grade to be permanent.I don't know about the forthcoming series, but feel confident that regular viewers of the more serious British Imports will find this one worthy of an audience over here in the U.S.",4,Another Fine British Import,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,1399,"['have', 'not', 'come', 'writings', 'Peter', 'Robinson', 'previously', 'seen', 'adaptations', 'made', 'British', 'TV', 'However', 'good', 'poor', 'books', 'may', 'be', 'adaptations', 'meet', 'Brits', 'high', 'standard', 'production', 'displayed', 'better', 'mystery-detective', 'series', 'are', 'sober', 'serious', 'approaches', 'law', 'enforcement', 'consequences', 'crime', 'public', 'criminal', 'police', 'officers', 'involved', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'confuse', 'Morse', 'Frost', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'confuse', 'DCI', 'Banks', 'other', 'elite', 'fictional-amateur', 'professional-televised', 'crime-fighters', 'character', 'stand-alone', 'two', 'episode', 'story', '90', 'minutes', 'distinctive', 'others', 'central', 'foci', 'professional', 'private', 'person', 'are', 'often', 'war', 'other', 'anything', 'robotic', 'instrument', 'justice', 'interesting', 'lead', 'admirably', 'played', 'performer', 'who', 'character', 'apppear', 'seasoned', 'professional', 'who', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'human', 'are', 'other', 'quite', 'adept', 'actors/actresses', 'providing', 'support', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'Season', '1', 'Amazon', 'pre-sale', 'now', 'know', 'just', 'who', 'made', 'grade', 'be', 'permanent.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'forthcoming', 'series', 'feel', 'confident', 'regular', 'viewers', 'more', 'serious', 'British', 'Imports', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'worthy', 'audience', 'here', 'U.S']",DCI Banks: Aftermath

1653626,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00D49YBTA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 20]","If you love contemporary cop shows and you haven't checked out the ""DCI Banks"" series, I'd strongly recommend that you take a look into it!  This intense and no-nonsense offering from Britain plays by the rules of typical TV crimes procedurals, to be sure, but it does so with a refreshingly hard edge.  ""DCI Banks"" ran for two six episode seasons in 2011 and 2012, but it kicked off in 2010 with the effective two-parter ""Aftermath"" (here combined and released at the feature length of ninety minutes).  Some people, therefore, might consider this Season One of the Banks saga but really it's just a movie that introduces the primary characters who will extend into the following TV series.  But whatever you want to call it, ""Aftermath"" is a gritty and entertaining film adapted from the popular novel by Peter Robinson.  It may not necessarily be my favorite Banks case, but it does a great job introducing the characters and setting the mood that serves the series so well.  First and foremost, an impassioned Stephen Tompkinson headlines the piece.  He plays a fairly typical archetype: a disillusioned cop right on the edge of reason.  But Tompkinson imbues Banks with just the right mix of integrity and volatility.  You never know quite which way he's going to go.""Aftermath"" gets off to a quick and bloody start.  When a woman hears a scream from across the street, she reports a domestic violence charge to the police for that address.  When two patrol officers respond, they find the wife beaten on the ground and a macabre murder tableau in the basement.  Just as they are taking in the sight of a tortured body, however, they are viciously attacked by the husband.  It turns out that the police have been investigating the disappearance of five local women and they've just stumbled across the culprit.  It's never that simple, though, is it?  The primary mystery is given away right from the start.  But there are still plenty of loose ends.  One of the girls is still missing, the cops suspect an accomplice, and how much did the wife know about what transpired in the basement.  As the story unfolds, several of the major players seem to be hiding secrets.  Banks is on the case, it's a personal mission for him.  He is haunted by the fact that he didn't come to a speedier resolution.  But he is also hampered with the British equivalent of Internal Affairs (Andrea Lowe) investigating the charge of excessive force.  In the end, some of the major revelations aren't incredibly surprising but it's definitely a journey worth taking.Tompkinson exudes compassion and is obsessed with justice at any cost.  Lowe is more pragmatic, seeking to move her career to the next level with single-minded determination.  Adversaries will learn to respect one another (Spoiler Alert: she's a regular on the TV series) and each brings something to the table that benefits the other.  Sounds like a classic pairing, doesn't it?  In addition to the leads, the supporting cast is also very solid.  The reliable Charlotte Riley (why isn't she a bigger star?) takes on the meatiest role as the abused wife of the deranged madman.  And Barry Sloane, who has since hit U.S. primetime on ABC's Revenge as Aiden, has a memorable turn as the father of the girl who remains missing.  ""Aftermath"" is intense, well acted, and mightily enjoyable.  It's a great introduction to what I might consider a five star series.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[43, 46]","Unlike my fellow Amazon Top 100 reviewer, K Harris (whose reviews I admire) , I was unfamiliar with the character of Chief Inspector DC Banks before seeing this film. Research after watching this DVD (I'm not a fan of ""spoilers""  and trusted the BBC label to give me a good detective story) I learned that this was a two-part ""pilot"" for a series that ran two seasons. (It was edited into one 90 minute ""film"" - I did notice a brief ""pause"" in the middle).  So, if you are new to the character, I can only recommend that - like any good mystery - you go in knowing as little as possible before watching it.There is a murder (in fact a few) and they are bloody (no spoiler here) and the story is told using flashback at points (in a creative way). The only thing that made me drop a star in my rating is that the action takes time out for a ""romantic interlude"" which detracts from the flow. (At least for me.)The film is based on a novel (which I guess gets expanded in the subsequent ""series"", which I pan to look into watching; the main character did interest me.).The DVD has no special features - just scene index and subtitle option (in case the accents are too thick for you.).This is one of those crime series that the British do so well. Actually it was created by the commercial ITV Network but aired on cable on the BBC America channel and now released on the BBC Home Entertainment imprint.If you want to know more about the plot I'll refer you to K's review.
