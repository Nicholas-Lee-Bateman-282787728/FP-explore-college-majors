Filmed in a lot of darkness with jerky camera work and annoying fadeouts, the movie tries hard for suspense but ultimately fails miserably.  An ecoterrorist group breaks into a facility to release test animals; they are aided by the security guard who is dating the big shot's daughter.  They find no animals but when their computer geek opens all the doors, they release a secret genetic experiment---a girl who injects her victims with a poisonous toxin that liquefies their innards and is contagious as well.  Seems like the father of the heroine has been trying to cure this girl for ten years---we never know what he's curing her of or who she is.  Needless to say, the girl gets out and eats up most of the cast.  Edward Furlong, whose career has pretty much gone down hill since his TERMINATOR days is the security guard and he is as bad as the rest of the unknowns cast.

Unfortunately, it seems that special effects guru Dave Bonneywell and TV-series script editor Jeremy Boxer got ahold of a copy before obscurity could hit, decided they could combine it with a far more popular film from a few years previous, Species, and come up with a North American pseudo-remake. That this was a bad idea should be evident to all, especially those (like me) who have actually seen LD 50, which was a deathless cinema classic compared to this waste of time and money.Edward Furlong heads a cast of what can loosely be called actors (save the always-entertaining Rothaford Gray) in this tale of a radical animal-rights group who set their sights on breaking into a supposedly-unbreakable lab. (Furlong plays a security guard there; he's their inside man.) Once they get in, however, they find out that what they thought was in there to liberate and what really is are two entirely different things...Everything about this movie is either shoddy or worse. The camerawork is often excruciating, and the lighting is phenomenally bad. Combine the two whenever the bad guy pops up on screen, and wow, is this silly. The acting is awful (save Gray), the script worse. The set is about as generic as it gets for these kinds of movies. Really, did anyone put an iota of thought into this? Attempts at making a quick buck at their worst. Fortunately for you, I watched it so that you don't have to.
