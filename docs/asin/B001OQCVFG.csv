1224795,A1IAMLP0Y3DN52,B001OQCVFG,Ben Monaghan,"[12, 15]","For those looking for conflict resolution or some sort of psychological undressing of Jackie - you have the wrong show. Jackie is too hard for that sort of Oprah candy. She has been hardened by the life she has lived in the Emergency Room. Like a soldier on the frontlines of battle, she is undergoing horrific trauma on a daily basis with no time to process or find healthier ways of coping. Clearly she is spiraling towards some sort of crash, which she is doing her best to stem off with drugs. But it is inevitable. This is what drives the show - how close can the writers take Jackie to the brink but not push her over? (When and if they do push her over that brink and into rehad, the show will lose its momentum - not sure what season two will look like.) I don't think the writers intended her to be some sort of ""character"" tied up in a neat bow of conflict, conflict resolution - hopefully in the third act. This show is more like The Wire, it intends to show life as it  is in certain segments of our society and people, flawed people, doing whatever it takes to deal with it and cope - not always successfully. An Emergency Room in Queens is the belly of this beast that is our healthcare system and society - characters like Jackie are intended to reflect the sickness that is the system.",4,No Conflict Resolution Here - And the Better For It!,1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,1301,"['looking', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'sort', 'psychological', 'undressing', 'Jackie', 'have', 'wrong', 'show', 'Jackie', 'too', 'hard', 'sort', 'Oprah', 'candy', 'been', 'hardened', 'life', 'lived', 'Emergency', 'Room', 'soldier', 'frontlines', 'battle', 'undergoing', 'horrific', 'trauma', 'daily', 'basis', 'time', 'process', 'find', 'healthier', 'ways', 'coping', 'Clearly', 'spiraling', 'towards', 'sort', 'crash', 'doing', 'best', 'stem', 'off', 'drugs', 'inevitable', 'show', 'how', 'close', 'can', 'writers', 'take', 'Jackie', 'brink', 'not', 'push', 'When', 'do', 'push', 'brink', 'rehad', 'show', 'will', 'lose', 'momentum', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'writers', 'intended', 'be', 'sort', 'character', 'tied', 'up', 'neat', 'bow', 'conflict', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'hopefully', 'third', 'act', 'show', 'more', 'Wire', 'show', 'life', 'certain', 'segments', 'society', 'people', 'flawed', 'people', 'doing', 'whatever', 'deal', 'cope', 'not', 'always', 'successfully', 'Emergency', 'Room', 'Queens', 'belly', 'beast', 'healthcare', 'system', 'society', 'characters', 'Jackie', 'are', 'intended', 'reflect', 'sickness', 'system']",N/A

1224799,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001OQCVFG,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[9, 24]","This show has tons of focus, which is usually good.  It is all laser like upon Nurse Jackie.  Over the episodes we discover that Nurse Jackie is a cheating spouse who is primarily having an affair with a pharmacist so she can score prescription drugs for herself.  Although she acts like a good nurse a lot of the time, can she be one since she pops pills constantly and is having sex during her hours on duty? This show NEVER addresses a prime question-why does she act this way?I loved Edie Falco in the SOPRANOS. On the SOPRANOS, characterized by its excellent writing, I knew exactly why Carmella Soprano developed into the woman she became, married to Tony Soprano.I do not think there is anything likable or admirable about this character. There is also not a shred of evidence as to why she acts not only self destructively but also destructively towards her husband, her daughters and her patients. She is just using her paramour, the pharmacist, for the drugs. Although the sexual encounters may have been enjoyable for him, she sure did not look like a woman who was mad with passion or desire. Jackie acts like someone in deep anesthesia and numbness nearly all of the time. I do not find it sufficient motivation that she has been a nurse. There are plenty of nurses who work high stress wards and hospitals who do not put their patients, colleagues and families in daily danger by taking heaps of drugs all day long.There is another show, BREAKING BAD, which has been scooping up Emmys, because the drug dealing lead character, a high school chemistry teacher, gives a deeply layered, nuanced tragic performance from an extremely well written script. I suggest you watch that show and then compare it with this show. In my mind, there is no comparison, although both deal with characters who daily engage in incredibly self destructive and destructive-to-others behaviors.This show needs radical rewriting or Edie Falco needs a new show.",3,Focused But You Don't Like Nurse Jackie or Understand Her (or want to?),1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,1950,"['show', 'tons', 'focus', 'usually', 'good', 'laser', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'episodes', 'discover', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'cheating', 'spouse', 'who', 'primarily', 'having', 'affair', 'pharmacist', 'can', 'score', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'herself', 'good', 'nurse', 'lot', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'pills', 'constantly', 'having', 'sex', 'hours', 'duty', 'show', 'NEVER', 'prime', 'question-why', 'act', 'way', 'loved', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'SOPRANOS', 'SOPRANOS', 'characterized', 'excellent', 'writing', 'knew', 'exactly', 'why', 'Carmella', 'Soprano', 'developed', 'woman', 'became', 'married', 'Tony', 'Soprano.I', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'anything', 'likable', 'admirable', 'character', 'also', 'not', 'shred', 'evidence', 'why', 'not', 'only', 'self', 'destructively', 'also', 'destructively', 'husband', 'daughters', 'patients', 'just', 'using', 'paramour', 'pharmacist', 'drugs', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'sure', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'mad', 'passion', 'desire', 'Jackie', 'someone', 'deep', 'anesthesia', 'numbness', 'nearly', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'sufficient', 'motivation', 'been', 'nurse', 'are', 'plenty', 'nurses', 'who', 'work', 'high', 'stress', 'wards', 'hospitals', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'put', 'patients', 'colleagues', 'families', 'daily', 'danger', 'taking', 'heaps', 'drugs', 'day', 'show', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'been', 'scooping', 'up', 'Emmys', 'drug', 'dealing', 'lead', 'character', 'high', 'school', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'deeply', 'layered', 'nuanced', 'tragic', 'performance', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'suggest', 'watch', 'show', 'then', 'compare', 'show', 'mind', 'comparison', 'deal', 'characters', 'who', 'daily', 'engage', 'incredibly', 'self', 'destructive', 'destructive-to-others', 'behaviors.This', 'show', 'radical', 'rewriting', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'new', 'show']",N/A

The titular character, played to perfection by dynamite Edie Falco (completing shedding Carmela Soprano as effectively as Michael C. Hall shed David Fischer), is a character unlike we've ever seen on TV. She's not a virtuous heroine, she's not a villianess, and she's not really an anti-heroine either. She's actually mostly like a real person. She's so full of contradictions, virtues, and vices that she really seems less like a character and more like someone you know. And what's great is that the show doesn't try to give pat answers as to why Jackie is the way she is ... why she's a tough, compassionate caregiver and mother who also happens to be an adulterous opiate addict.While Nurse Jackie and Edie Falco are superb, the rest of the characters are merely good, which is why this is a four star and not a five star review. Some of the characters shine (brainiac idiot Dr. Cooper and doe-eyed Zoe)whereas others still seem 2-dimensional or stereotypical (Miss Akalitus and Mo, the token gay nurse).

For some reason this week, I started watching it again, then had to buy Season 1.  I am not sure why I liked it so much.  Some of it reminds me why I left the nursing field.  Some of it is totally unrealistic. I never worked in a place where so many narcotics could have gone missing, however I was always in a small town hospital or nursing home, so I have no idea about the big hospitals.  I do know lots of nurses are in NA and AA.  But there are lots of pharmacists, mailmen, store clerks, ordinary people also.  Realistically those people get the meds somehow. Its a TV show, I never watch reality TV, so why do I want this show to be reality anyway?  I don't!  I could totally see Jackie as a human being working in a hospital in New York.  I spent 360 minutes in another world like I rarely find.  I think this was money well spent, and look forward to Season 2.  I love the characters, the layers.  My favorite is the new nurse, and her idealistic view of how nursing should be, in such contrast to Jackie.

And when the opening moments of a show's debut episode features the theme from ""Valley of the Dolls"" (one of my favorite bad movies ever) I knew it couldn't be anything but great!I never watched ""The Sopranos"" so I don't have anything to compare Edie Falco's performance to, but here she's just perfect playing the drug-addicted, overworked, underpaid nurse toiling at a New York hospital. She's also carrying on a sexual relationship with Eddie the pharmacist, even though she's married with two kids.The supporting cast is also excellent and it's fun to see Jackie and her gay co-worker Mo-Mo lying in the chapel pews on their break philosophizing; or Jackie and best pal Dr. O'Hara running to each other whenever they need some friendly support for their personal crises. The running gags in the show are fresh like young Dr. Cooper's nervous tic of inappropriate sexual touching whenever he's in a tense situation.The show can make you laugh one moment and cry the next; especially when Jackie goes above and beyond by doing something small like mailing a patient's due bills for them after they've died; or giving their survived loved ones cab fare home.The best episode features the always-dependable Judith Ivey guest-starring as a foul-mouthed former colleague suffering from lung cancer who checks in to ask for Jackie's help in ""checking out"".I also appreciated the show's basic filming technique; no done-to-death CSI-type editing here, so bravo to the producers for that.Overall, a great series that is well worth seeing.

They have a point - Jackie cheats on her husband with a pharmacist who thinks he is her main squeeze, so that Jackie can be kept with a steady supply of narcotics.But like the proverbial onion, Jackie has layers, and like another of my favorite Showtime eponymous characters, Dexter Gordon, Jackie is not by any stretch ""all evil"" and she is never, ever boring.Jackie's an adulterous druggie - but she's more.  Years of having to literally manhandle patients in the Emergency Room more than twice her size have left Jackie with an aching back, and she could pursue more permanent treatment, but she and her family need this week's paycheck, so she masks her painful back with ill-gotten hard stuff.  Merritt Wever plays Zoey, a young nurse who is everything Jackie is not - nave, inexperienced, and as likely to want to cuddle her patients as treat them.  The interactions between the experienced Jackie and the still-learning Zoey are one of the cornerstones of the show.Jackie does things on the other side of ""ethical"", but like Robin Hood, she does them because her heart is in the right place.  She knows desperate patients wait for potential donors, so when a brain-dead bicycle courier is brought to her ER, Jackie forges the dying man's signature onto an organ donor card.If she sees nurses or doctors doing wrong or even not doing as well as they should, Jackie gets in their face.  She is not the touchy-feely one in her department.  But she is the one the others go to if they're in a tough spot.Eve Best plays Dr. Eleanor O'Hara, an experienced New York doctor who is as anxious to use her doctor's wages to buy the latest fashions as her doctor's skill to take care of patients.  Peter Facinelli plays Dr. Fitch Cooper, a new and inexperienced E.R. doc who finds himself often on the receiving end of Jackie's verbal and physical barbs.  Haaz Sleiman is great as Mohammed ""Mo-Mo"" De La Cruz, another ER RN with a heart of gold who has fought in the trenches with Jackie for years.  Paul Schulze plays Eddie the pharmacist boyfriend.  Dominic Fumusa plays Jackie's solid gold husband, Kevin.

Wrong.I really, really wanted to like this show, but it's just missing something. The story revolves around Jackie (Falco), a nurse at a New York City hospital. Although she appears to be happily married with two kids, Jackie's also having an affair with Eddie (Paul Schulze), the hospital pharmacist, who has no idea his lover has a family waiting for her at home. Meanwhile, Jackie also has a nasty little addiction to painkillers, and she uses her job and her relationship with Eddie to secure regular fixes.""Nurse Jackie"" also boasts a colorful supporting cast, but quite frankly, I don't really care for any of the characters on this show, Jackie included. I think one of the biggest problems with the entire series is that the majority of the characters are extremely annoying, or just downright unlikeable. In fact, the only two characters I care for are Elenor (Eve Best) and Cooper (Peter Facinelli), who bring some much-needed comic relief to the show. The other characters are amusing at times and Falco has some good one-liners, but for the most part, this show just doesn't do it for me. I don't feel invested in any of the characters, and their motivations are never clearly defined throughout the course of the first season. Why is Jackie having an affair? Why is she addicted to drugs? I don't know, and I really don't care, because I don't like her character. It's such a disappointment, because the series has so much potential, but just sort of fell flat from the very beginning.The one good thing I can say is that the last two episodes of the season were definitely the best of the bunch, so perhaps there is hope for ""Nurse Jackie.""

It isn't so much that there's a Mother with two school aged daughters in it who cheats on her loving husband.  It's her place in the show.

I certainly wouldn't want her to be my nurse in a hospital or anywhere else.  Perhaps she would be tolerated in a New York hospital, but I would hope not.  In fact, I doubt that she could hide her faults in any hospital.Nurse Jackie is first of all a drug addict.  She needs a hit before she can go to work, and she needs several more hits during her workday.  Worst of all, the drug addiction is used for comedic effect, and there's nothing funny, to my thinking, about a druggie or a drunk.  For example, Jackie's supervisor accidently puts Jackie's drugs in her coffee, thinking she is using an artificial sweetener.  Suddenly, the supervisor turns into a giggly girl in lala land, rather than a dragon lady.  As Queen Victoria allegedly said, ""we are not amused.""  Patients could be jeopardized while she has the giggles.And then Nurse Jackie is having a torrid sexual affair at work, despite the fact that she is married to a man who loves her and whom she loves.  They have two small daughters.  Jackie's paramour and her husband do not know about each other.  It's amazing that she finds time to take care of patients, with all this jiggling and juggling and hot text messages.  I'd want a nurse who had her focus on me, the patient, not one who was planning her next love tryst in the supply closet or looking forward to her next snootfull.The atmosphere and sets are good.  Falco's acting is excellent as always.  She looks like a real nurse, not some starlet who was cast for her implants.  The problem is with the view the writers had of the central character.  Among medical programs, I prefer House, ER, and Grey's Anatomy.

1224852,A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2,B001OQCVFG,Storm,"[76, 82]","Having never watched the Sopranos (heresy, I know), I didn't have any preconceived notions of what type of person Edie Falco should or should not be playing. Many of my friends tell me that the character of Nurse Jackie is a far cry from her Carmelo Soprano alter-ego.Jackie is a full time nurse in a public hospital in New York City.  Like most nurses and emergency medical workers, she is overworked and underpaid and trying to make do with what life has handed to her.  On the surface, she is hardworking nurse who is a loving mother of two little girls and a devoted wife to Kevin Payton who runs a local bar. Scratch the surface just a little bit and the perfect facade peels away to reveal a drug addicted adulterer who regularly breaks the laws in order to suit her own perceived morals.Nurse Jackie tackles quite a few heavy subjects during its initial season including assisted suicide, underage children caring for their parents, as well as the rigors of raising children who aren't quite perfect.  Medical dramas are a dime a dozen and the comedy versions just always seem to be lacking substance, however the staff writers of Nurse Jackie do a masterful job of mixing the heavy subjects in with very lighthearted, almost slapstick humor.While the Peyton household hasn't been expanded on very much (honestly you could replace the husband and two little girls with bricks and you probably wouldn't notice much difference), the hospital staff shines in every way. Doctor O'Hara is the archetypal rich doctor as well as the ""straight man"" for most of Jackie's exploits.  While her character was explored a little bit in season one, there wasn't a lot invested yet.  Doctor Cooper is the hotshot doctor straight out of Med School looking to make his mark.  He's cute and naive and looking to make sure everyone thinks of him as their buddy while trying to become a serious doctor at the same time.  Zoey is the nurse counterpart to Cooper; the truly naive nursing student straight from school who hasn't had her spirit crushed by the real world. The rest of the hospital staff, Miss Akalitus, Mo-Mo, and Thor, all play delightful comedic foils throughout the season.  The cast list would not be complete without the mention of Eddie, the hospital pharmacist who ""supplies"" prescription pills to Jackie because he believes he is doing his duty as a good boyfriend.  Eddie unfortunately does not know that he is being used by Jackie who has a happy family at home as well as a husband with whom we are led to believe she is still in love with.Fans of shows like ER will appreciate the drama, however it should be noted that Nurse Jackie is relatively light on the medical science side of the house.  While drugs are described, procedures mentioned, there is very little step-by-step-to-recovery type documentation on a per patient level.  You'll see gunshot wounds come in, chest tubes inserted, CBC and toxicity reports ordered but not a lot of breakdown into why a doctor orders which test, why they should look at alternatives, etc like in ER.  Nurse Jackie was written in order to revolve around the nurse not the doctor, and as such there is a much higher emphasis placed on patient care rather than just medical procedures.My only gripe with Nurse Jackie is that there is zero conflict resolution throughout the entire season.  Season one ended with a cliffhanger and as with all other Showtime/HBO episodic shows, the next season will not premier until sometime in the next year. All of the ""will she get caught?"" questions that you develop from episode one will still be there after you finish episode twelve (with a few dozen extra questions thrown in by then for good measure). Other than that, Nurse Jackie is a great show, and I suppose that the fact that I want Season Two to start right now! attests to how addicting the series is.",4,Awesome show - can't wait for season 2!,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,3851,"['Having', 'never', 'watched', 'Sopranos', 'heresy', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', 'type', 'person', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'playing', 'Many', 'friends', 'tell', 'character', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'far', 'cry', 'Carmelo', 'Soprano', 'alter-ego.Jackie', 'full', 'time', 'nurse', 'public', 'hospital', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'most', 'nurses', 'emergency', 'medical', 'workers', 'overworked', 'underpaid', 'trying', 'make', 'do', 'what', 'life', 'handed', 'surface', 'hardworking', 'nurse', 'who', 'loving', 'mother', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'devoted', 'wife', 'Kevin', 'Payton', 'who', 'local', 'bar', 'Scratch', 'surface', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'perfect', 'facade', 'peels', 'away', 'reveal', 'drug', 'addicted', 'adulterer', 'who', 'regularly', 'laws', 'order', 'suit', 'own', 'perceived', 'morals.Nurse', 'Jackie', 'quite', 'few', 'heavy', 'subjects', 'initial', 'season', 'including', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'underage', 'children', 'caring', 'parents', 'as', 'well', 'rigors', 'raising', 'children', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'perfect', 'Medical', 'dramas', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'comedy', 'versions', 'just', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'lacking', 'substance', 'however', 'staff', 'writers', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'do', 'masterful', 'job', 'mixing', 'heavy', 'subjects', 'very', 'lighthearted', 'almost', 'slapstick', 'humor.While', 'Peyton', 'household', ""n't"", 'been', 'expanded', 'very', 'much', 'honestly', 'could', 'replace', 'husband', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'bricks', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'much', 'difference', 'hospital', 'staff', 'shines', 'way', 'Doctor', ""O'Hara"", 'archetypal', 'rich', 'doctor', 'as', 'well', 'straight', 'man', 'most', 'Jackie', 'exploits', 'character', 'was', 'explored', 'little', 'bit', 'season', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'invested', 'yet', 'Doctor', 'Cooper', 'hotshot', 'doctor', 'straight', 'Med', 'School', 'looking', 'make', 'mark', 'cute', 'naive', 'looking', 'make', 'sure', 'everyone', 'thinks', 'buddy', 'trying', 'become', 'serious', 'doctor', 'same', 'time', 'Zoey', 'nurse', 'counterpart', 'Cooper', 'truly', 'naive', 'nursing', 'student', 'straight', 'school', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'spirit', 'crushed', 'real', 'world', 'rest', 'hospital', 'staff', 'Miss', 'Akalitus', 'Mo-Mo', 'Thor', 'play', 'delightful', 'comedic', 'foils', 'season', 'cast', 'list', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'mention', 'Eddie', 'hospital', 'pharmacist', 'who', 'supplies', 'prescription', 'pills', 'Jackie', 'doing', 'duty', 'good', 'boyfriend', 'Eddie', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'know', 'being', 'used', 'Jackie', 'who', 'happy', 'family', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'husband', 'whom', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'still', 'love', 'with.Fans', 'shows', 'ER', 'will', 'appreciate', 'drama', 'however', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'relatively', 'light', 'medical', 'science', 'side', 'house', 'drugs', 'are', 'described', 'procedures', 'mentioned', 'very', 'little', 'step-by-step-to-recovery', 'type', 'documentation', 'per', 'patient', 'level', ""'ll"", 'see', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'come', 'chest', 'tubes', 'inserted', 'CBC', 'toxicity', 'reports', 'ordered', 'not', 'lot', 'breakdown', 'why', 'doctor', 'orders', 'test', 'why', 'should', 'look', 'alternatives', 'etc', 'ER', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'was', 'written', 'order', 'revolve', 'nurse', 'not', 'doctor', 'such', 'much', 'higher', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'patient', 'care', 'rather', 'just', 'medical', 'procedures.My', 'only', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'zero', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'entire', 'season', 'Season', 'one', 'ended', 'cliffhanger', 'other', 'Showtime/HBO', 'episodic', 'shows', 'next', 'season', 'will', 'not', 'premier', 'sometime', 'next', 'year', 'will', 'get', 'caught', 'questions', 'develop', 'episode', 'one', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'there', 'finish', 'episode', 'twelve', 'few', 'dozen', 'extra', 'questions', 'thrown', 'then', 'good', 'measure', 'Other', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'great', 'show', 'suppose', 'fact', 'want', 'Season', 'Two', 'start', 'right', 'now', 'attests', 'how', 'addicting', 'series']",N/A
