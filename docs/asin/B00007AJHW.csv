726323,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00007AJHW,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[1, 2]","Pure sweat is an intense yoga practice which will test your strength, particularly in the lower body.  Instructor Rainbeau Mars begins in chair pose, and for the first half of the video, she gradually introduces the poses from sun salutation B--including down dog, plank, push-up pose, and cobra--finally putting all of these poses together in a more flowing series.  Next comes a series of standing poses, including warrior 2, side angle warrior, crescent lunge, and chair pose variations.  You will also do a balance sequence (includes 3-legged dog pose and leg lifts while in standing forward bend) as well as several standing twists.  In addition, short vinyasas from chair to plank to push-up to cobra to down dog are interspersed throughout the practice.  At the end of the standing flow series, Rainbeau guides you down to the floor for child's pose and then leads you into a nice relaxation to end the practice at 35 minutes.  If you are looking for an intermediate practice to challenge your lower body and leave your thighs burning, Pure Sweat will fit the bill perfectly.",4,Intense practice concentrating on the lower body,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,1082,"['Pure', 'sweat', 'intense', 'yoga', 'practice', 'will', 'test', 'strength', 'particularly', 'lower', 'body', 'Instructor', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'chair', 'pose', 'first', 'half', 'video', 'gradually', 'poses', 'sun', 'salutation', 'B', 'including', 'down', 'dog', 'plank', 'push-up', 'pose', 'cobra', 'finally', 'putting', 'poses', 'together', 'more', 'flowing', 'series', 'Next', 'series', 'standing', 'poses', 'including', 'warrior', '2', 'side', 'angle', 'warrior', 'crescent', 'lunge', 'chair', 'pose', 'variations', 'will', 'also', 'do', 'balance', 'sequence', '3-legged', 'dog', 'pose', 'leg', 'lifts', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'standing', 'twists', 'addition', 'short', 'vinyasas', 'chair', 'plank', 'push-up', 'cobra', 'down', 'dog', 'are', 'interspersed', 'practice', 'end', 'standing', 'flow', 'series', 'Rainbeau', 'down', 'floor', 'child', 'pose', 'then', 'nice', 'relaxation', 'end', 'practice', '35', 'minutes', 'are', 'looking', 'intermediate', 'practice', 'challenge', 'lower', 'body', 'leave', 'thighs', 'burning', 'Pure', 'Sweat', 'will', 'fit', 'bill', 'perfectly']",N/A
726324,A35ROK8CVWNF62,B00007AJHW,"Buggy ""SUNNIE Day reader""","[2, 2]","That's what Rainbeau Mars reminds us throughout this inspirational and invigorating 35 minute workout. I enjoyed PURE SWEAT however it didn't actually make me sweat. It was however somewhat challenging especially in the lower body and hips and I wouldn't recommend this to beginners because of the difficulty level and lack of detailed instruction. A problem for me was that Rainbeau doesn't always tell you which leg to move foreword she just says ""other leg"" and I often forgot which leg I had already done. The length of this program was just right for me to be able to fit into my schedule and the windy Hawaiian beach, gorgeous. The entire practice has dubbed in cuing and Rainbeau does tend to talk a lot but I enjoyed her spiritual motivation.15 minute gradually building Sun Salutations15 minute Standing series5 minute Savasana including cool downBeginning in Chair pose Rainbeau leads us through 15 minutes of gradually building Sun Salutations (Down dog, Push up, Cobra) before putting them all together into a nice flow. We then start the 15 minute standing pose section which includes;  Warrior 2, Side Angle, a very difficult 3-legged dog pose (which is also done to the side) Standing prayer twists, ending in Childs pose, some brief stretching and a delicious 5 minute savasana. All the standing poses are interspaced with Vinyasas and I definitely felt this in my legs and hips.A Short yet challenging workout with beautiful scenery and inspiration, Namaste",4,ENJOY YOUR BREATHE,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,1474,"['what', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'inspirational', 'invigorating', '35', 'minute', 'workout', 'enjoyed', 'PURE', 'SWEAT', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'make', 'sweat', 'was', 'however', 'somewhat', 'challenging', 'especially', 'lower', 'body', 'hips', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'beginners', 'difficulty', 'level', 'lack', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'problem', 'was', 'Rainbeau', ""n't"", 'always', 'tell', 'leg', 'move', 'foreword', 'just', 'other', 'leg', 'often', 'forgot', 'leg', 'had', 'already', 'done', 'length', 'program', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'be', 'able', 'fit', 'schedule', 'windy', 'Hawaiian', 'beach', 'gorgeous', 'entire', 'practice', 'dubbed', 'cuing', 'Rainbeau', 'tend', 'talk', 'lot', 'enjoyed', 'spiritual', 'motivation.15', 'minute', 'gradually', 'building', 'Sun', 'Salutations15', 'minute', 'Standing', 'series5', 'minute', 'Savasana', 'including', 'cool', 'downBeginning', 'Chair', 'pose', 'Rainbeau', '15', 'minutes', 'gradually', 'building', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'Down', 'dog', 'Push', 'up', 'Cobra', 'putting', 'together', 'nice', 'flow', 'then', 'start', '15', 'minute', 'standing', 'pose', 'section', 'Warrior', '2', 'Side', 'Angle', 'very', 'difficult', '3-legged', 'dog', 'pose', 'also', 'done', 'side', 'Standing', 'prayer', 'twists', 'ending', 'Childs', 'pose', 'brief', 'stretching', 'delicious', '5', 'minute', 'savasana', 'standing', 'poses', 'are', 'interspaced', 'Vinyasas', 'definitely', 'felt', 'legs', 'hips.A', 'Short', 'yet', 'challenging', 'workout', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'inspiration', 'Namaste']",N/A

726326,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B00007AJHW,CPTScott,"[32, 33]","This tape which is the fourth in Rainbeau Mars ""Sacred Yoga"" series is really great for those looking for a challenging, flow style practice.One of the things I really like about her approach is how she gradually eases you into the Sun Salutations. This tape focuses a lot at the beginning on what would traditionally be called the B series salutations (which starts with the ""Powerful"" pose (aka Utkatasana (Chair Pose), a squatted position with the arms reaching upwards, palms together).She moves you slowly enough at the beginning to give your body an opportunity to open up before moving into the faster paced and fully flowing salutations. This makes the practice much more enjoyable and considerably safer!This tape has a wide variety of poses to work your body thru a wide range of movements with vinyasa throughout (which are a connecting series of poses which usually consist of: Plank lowered down, then to cobra (or ""Up Dog"") to down dog). The vinyasa helps maintain heat in the body between the poses that are held for longer periods of time (Done correctly though, even the longer held poses should never be static but should always be done with the breath moving the body internally and active ""lines of energy"" moving thru the body as well with subtle adjustments as you work in the ""edges"" of each pose).The instructions are really helpful and encouraging throughout and she brings many details to the poses that were fresh (and I have over 50 videos and study with a teacher weekly). For example, a simple but helpful point she brings out is to move your knee slightly towards the little toe of the bent leg in a warrior pose. This subtle movement really helps to open up the hip of that front leg.There are many wonderful ideas she brings to her teaching that I found made an immediate impact on the poses. There are also some interesting variations of poses that she presents here that I've not seen on other tapes before.She stresses breathing throughout and that the flow of asanas should be done as a meditation.The tape (and the others in this collection) are beautifully filmed in a tropical setting and has music that is really nice to practice with. All things being equal, I do prefer a nice setting to a plain studio set (though I love the ""Total Yoga"" tapes and others done in studios as well). Still, it's especially nice to see that tropical setting on a snowy January morning:)As with all the tapes in this series she ends with a relaxation segment.If you're looking for a challenging yoga practice that is still done within a practical time frame (around 30 or so minutes) then I think you'll love this tape.Nasmaste.",5,Challenging Vinyasa Flow with a Wonderful Teacher!!,1042761600,"01 17, 2003",2003,2651,"['tape', 'fourth', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'Sacred', 'Yoga', 'series', 'really', 'great', 'looking', 'challenging', 'flow', 'style', 'practice.One', 'things', 'really', 'approach', 'how', 'gradually', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'tape', 'lot', 'beginning', 'what', 'would', 'traditionally', 'be', 'called', 'B', 'series', 'salutations', 'Powerful', 'pose', 'aka', 'Utkatasana', 'Chair', 'Pose', 'squatted', 'position', 'arms', 'reaching', 'upwards', 'palms', 'together', '.She', 'moves', 'slowly', 'enough', 'beginning', 'give', 'body', 'opportunity', 'open', 'up', 'moving', 'faster', 'paced', 'fully', 'flowing', 'salutations', 'practice', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'considerably', 'safer', 'tape', 'wide', 'variety', 'poses', 'work', 'body', 'thru', 'wide', 'range', 'movements', 'vinyasa', 'are', 'connecting', 'series', 'poses', 'usually', 'consist', 'Plank', 'lowered', 'down', 'then', 'cobra', 'Dog', 'down', 'dog', 'vinyasa', 'maintain', 'heat', 'body', 'poses', 'are', 'held', 'longer', 'periods', 'time', 'Done', 'correctly', 'even', 'longer', 'held', 'poses', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'static', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'done', 'breath', 'moving', 'body', 'internally', 'active', 'lines', 'energy', 'moving', 'body', 'as', 'well', 'subtle', 'adjustments', 'work', 'edges', 'pose', '.The', 'instructions', 'are', 'really', 'helpful', 'encouraging', 'many', 'details', 'poses', 'were', 'fresh', 'have', 'over', '50', 'videos', 'study', 'teacher', 'weekly', 'example', 'simple', 'helpful', 'point', 'out', 'move', 'knee', 'slightly', 'little', 'toe', 'bent', 'leg', 'warrior', 'pose', 'subtle', 'movement', 'really', 'open', 'up', 'hip', 'front', 'are', 'many', 'wonderful', 'ideas', 'teaching', 'found', 'made', 'immediate', 'impact', 'poses', 'are', 'also', 'interesting', 'variations', 'poses', 'here', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'tapes', 'before.She', 'breathing', 'flow', 'asanas', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'meditation.The', 'tape', 'others', 'collection', 'are', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'tropical', 'setting', 'music', 'really', 'nice', 'practice', 'things', 'being', 'equal', 'do', 'prefer', 'nice', 'setting', 'plain', 'studio', 'set', 'love', 'Total', 'Yoga', 'tapes', 'others', 'done', 'studios', 'well', 'Still', 'especially', 'nice', 'see', 'tropical', 'setting', 'snowy', 'January', 'morning', 'tapes', 'series', 'relaxation', 'segment.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'challenging', 'yoga', 'practice', 'still', 'done', 'practical', 'time', 'frame', '30', 'so', 'minutes', 'then', 'think', ""'ll"", 'love', 'tape.Nasmaste']",N/A

The workout is roughly 30 minutes long, which is good, if you're starting out, or just want variety.

While there are many many poses I have yet to master, chaturanga being my current challenge, I did not find this video tape too difficult for an average beginner.  There are modifications given for most of the more difficult poses.Yes, it is very challenging, particularly towards the end, but it's doable with some determination.  IMO, it's pretty much basic poses that focus on lower body strength.  There were two poses that were very challenging, the 3 legged down dog and one where you lift one leg to the side in a forward bend.  There's no way I looked like Rainbeau did on the DVD but I went at my own pace, lifted my leg as far as I could without losing form and accepted my current level of ability.I really like Rainbeau Mars as an instructor she has the ability to talk a lot during the practice but it's not annoying chatter.  Instead she motivates you with the beautiful things she says.  The fact that she sometimes tells you what benefits you get from particular poses as you are in them is a big plus to me.I did notice some dubing issues and usually I prefer a longer workout with more floor poses after a vigorous flowing sequence but the length of this video, @35 min, is perfect so that you can do a gentler more restorative practice afterwards if you want to.  As to the ""sweat"" part of the workout, I didn't really break a sweat until 20 minutes into it but once it started, it kept on comin'!!  I felt invigorated afterwards!I'd say this is a nice challenging workout in which there is room for me to grow and improve my poses!  There are many reviews here that would scare off the average beginner, I almost didn't even try this, but I would encourage anyone with who is moderately fit and has some basic knowledge of poses to try it.

Or at least, I felt this workout was a challenge for me and I've been doing yoga for years. Rainbeau Mars really likes ""chair pose.""Let's just say you do a lot of push-ups without realizing it and I felt like I was upside down for a lot longer in many of the poses. The Vinyasa Flow consists of a lot of down dog and cobra poses. Your face will just be glowing from the increased blood flow/oxygen.The Ashtanga method tends to produce internal heat and a purifying sweat to detoxify your muscles and organs. You will notice improved circulation and you might even feel a little nauseous or heady at first.Yoga can heal you when other exercises can just make you stressed. It depends on the level. This workout will help you detoxify, listen to your body, send oxygen to all the body?s tissue and enhance a state of serenity. Yoga helps to clear your mind for days after you workout. You will learn to love this calm state in your mind. You will crave it.After doing this video, I feel stronger and yet really, really tired. This is a complete all-over body workout. In fact, I think this is comparable to walking on your treadmill for 30 minutes although it is a lot more enjoyable to do yoga.The setting is spectacular, so if you are looking for an outdoor setting by the ocean, this is one of the Natural Journeys Sacred Yoga videos you will want to own.Advanced ""Ashtanga-inspired"" Yoga Workout.
