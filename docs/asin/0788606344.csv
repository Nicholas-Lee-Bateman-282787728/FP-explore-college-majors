It has all 28 episodes of the first season + Bonus features in a four disc set.....that's 13hrs!I've watched the bonus features and three episodes and I'm already hooked. The only downfall I've seen so far is that they play the opening/ending credits before every single episode but no biggie.

I remember the theme song ""Que Sera Sera"""" while she was roaming through the rural area where the show took place bring supplemented by two children (in the cast?) and I remember the dog Tiger and the grumpy old man. For some reason, this show made me feel very warm and fuzzy as a small child watching this with my parents.I saw it again in the 1980s when CBN was running it. It still made me feel warm and fuzzy and it was fascinating to see these images that were lodged in the back of my brain from my very early childhood, but alas, that was the only real value of it as a whole.

I had just bought the 6 DVD box set of her movies & loved that so I decided to buy this TV series. It is so awful words can't describe it. It's not because it's ""dated"" because I Love Lucy is alot older & sheer perfection. It's initially nice to see Doris in another genre but this first series just doesn't work for me for many reasons. The subject matters chosen are thoughtful(that's the reason I gave it TWO stars & the presence of Doris)..I'll tell you the show just bored me & I found myself fast forworded through  the last 10 episodes.the DVD extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting. There's NO new interviews with Doris(that's an old interview they put on there).I think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dogs",2,Save your money you have to be a HUGE Doris Day fan to buy this!!,1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,805,"['start', 'am', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'Doris', 'Day', 'yeays', 'had', 'just', 'bought', '6', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'movies', 'loved', 'decided', 'buy', 'TV', 'series', 'so', 'awful', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'not', 'dated', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'alot', 'older', 'sheer', 'perfection', 'initially', 'nice', 'see', 'Doris', 'genre', 'first', 'series', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'many', 'reasons', 'subject', 'matters', 'chosen', 'are', 'thoughtful', 'reason', 'gave', 'TWO', 'presence', 'Doris', '..I', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'show', 'just', 'bored', 'found', 'fast', 'forworded', 'last', '10', 'episodes.the', 'DVD', 'extra', 'interviews', 'two', 'members', 'cast', 'are', 'interesting', 'new', 'interviews', 'Doris', 'old', 'interview', 'put', '.I', 'think', 'only', 'thing', 'new', '8x10', 'shot', 'dogs']",Doris Day Show Season 1
78104,A2FL0EKQ2EQ9E6,0788606344,"a viewer ""a viewer""","[60, 64]","Compared to today's awful television (CSI, REBA, WILL& GRACE, SEX & THE CITY, etc) this new release of ""The Doris Day Show"" (1968-1973) is a step back to a time when television WAS INDEED family friendly.  I remember watching this show as a child when it first premiered and I fell in love with it.  The show has lost nothing of its magic.  This is a DVD set well worth owning to introduce today's immoral generation to a clean, wholesome, decent program about a ""functional"" family for a change with episodes that vary from slapstick funny to heartwarming and sentimental to sometimes sad and moving.  Doris wanted a good, clean family show and she got it.  There are 28 episodes in the first season set on a farm in the rural town of Cotina near San Francisco.  Doris plays Doris Martin a widow with two sons Billy (Phillip Brown) and Toby (the late Todd Starke killed at the age of 21 in a motorcycle accident.  Doris was reportedly shocked and saddened when she heard about his death).  Denver Pyle is her father Buck played in his irascible style, James Hampton plays Leroy B. Simpson, a bungling handy man with a heart of gold and for the first ten episodes their housekeeper is played by Fran Ryan (Aggie).  The next 18 episodes feature Naomi Stevens as Juanita, the housekeeper.  Why they changed housekeepers is a mystery as Aggie's departure was never explained with Juanita replacing her.  (One of the great television mysteries).  Truthfully Fran Ryan's portrayal as Aggie was a bit cynical and ascerbic while Naomi Steven's portrayal as Juanita was warm and loving.  Here is a list of the episodes with their plot lines and how I rate them on a scale of one to five.1.  Dinner For Mom --  Toby and Billy take Doris out to dinner for her birthday, insisting they pay the bill with money they have earned.  ****1/2 stars.  A truly heartwarming story with Doris interacting beautifully with her onscreen children.2.  The Uniform --  When Billy comes home with a baseball uniform, Toby becomes jealous of all the attention his big brother receives so he tries out for the school choir which leads to complications.  *****  A truly outstanding episode with a great message!!3.  The Friend --  In return for a donation of milk for the school kinds, Doris agrees to pose with her family for an advertising picture.  ****  This episode is fine dealing with interracial friendship and prejudice.  Truly ahead of its time.4.  The Matchmakers --  Billy and Toby play cupid for their widowed mother, choosing the local deputy sheriff to be their future stepfather.  **1/2.  Not the best episode.  The payoff is disappointing.5.  The Songwriter --  After receiving a glowing acceptance of one of his songs, Leroy fancies himself becoming a successful music composer.  *****  My favorite episode of the season.  Hilarious and heartwarming at the same time.  Watch this one!!!!6.  The Antique  -- When two old ladies con Billy and Toby out of a valuable antique from the attic, Doris has to plot to get it back.  *****  Another outstanding and funny episode with the great Estelle Winwood playing one of the old ladies.  Hilarious!!7.  Leroy B. Simpson --  A flashback recalls how Leroy became hired with the help of Billy and Toby.  ***1/2.  Slapstick antics with Bungling LeRoy and Buck going at it.8.  The Black Eye  --  Ater Billy comes home from school with a black eye and admits he didn't fight back, Buck fears he is a coward.  ****  A great lesson to be learned here but I didn't find the payoff believable.9.  The Librarian  -- Leroy has a crush on a librarian so he tries to make her believe he is an expert on 19th century poetry.  *****  Another outstanding entry that leaves you teary eyed at the end.10.  The Camping Trip  --  When Buck invites Billy and Toby on a camping trip, the boys become enthralled with Buck's friend, Indian Joe.  ***  It has its moments but not the best entry.11.  The Job  --  (Naomi Stevens first appearance as Juanita).  Doris returns to New York to help her former employer for a week but the woman wants her back permanently.  ****  A great episode dealing with family communication.12.  Buck's Girl  --  Buck and the local veterinarian vie for the affections of the town's new manicurist. **1/2  A tepid episode.13.  Love a Duck --  Tyrone Lovey (Strother Martin)  is suspected of shooting ducks on the Martin's property, prompting Doris to take action.  ***  The payoff here is disappointing but this episode shows Doris's affinity for animals.14.  Let Them Out of the Nest --  Once Billy and Toby get themselves an egg delivery route, Doris cannot restrain herself from helping them too much.  *****  An outstanding episode with a great lesson dealing with responsibility.  A hilarious, excellent entry!!!  Not one wasted frame in the entire episode!!15.  The Clock  --  Tyrone Lovey convices Leroy to buy Doris an antique clock, a gift that backfired when Doris is unable to sleep.  ****1/2  Another great slapstick performance from Doris!16.  The Buddy  --  With Doris away, Buck and the boys find themselves at the mercy of an old female Marine who takes charge.  ****1/2 guest stars in this episode and she is wonderful!!  A solid entry.17.  The Fly Boy --  An airforce colonel becomes smitten with Doris and bets his flying buddies that he will romance her on the first date.  ***1/2  An o.k. episode reminiscent of Doris's films ""Pillow Talk"" and ""Send Me No Flowers"".18.  The Tournament --  After Leroy accidently injures Buck's horsehoe partner, Leroy is recruited once his special ability is discovered.  ****  A good, solid entry and a lesson in self-confidence.19.  Love Thy Neighbor --  Doris reviews the farm's financial accounts, discovers an outstanding debt from a neighbor and sets out to collect it.  ** A weak episode that could have benefited from better writing.  The premise starts off good but the payoff is extremely disappointing.20.  The Con Man --  When Doris is put in charge of raising funds for a new convention center, she is taken in by a handsome architect.  **1/2  Another weak entry.  Joe Campanella plays the Con Man and though he is redeemed he doesn't seem to ever pay for his past sins.21.  The Musical  --  Buck volunteers Doris to direct the grammar school musical.  ***  A so-so entry with Doris tackling the issue of the generation gap.  Could have been better.22.  The Baby Sitter  --  Doris finds herself in the middle of chaos while taking care of the children of a neighbor about to have a baby.  *****  Another superior effort with Doris at her slapstick best.  This episode is a laugh-riot!!23.  The Still  --  Doris tries to help two elderly ladies get rid of their moonshine still and liquor before federal agents discover them.  *****  Another hilarious offering.  My sides ached from laughing so much!!24.  The Gift  --  Doris and the family decide to give Leroy a surprise on his first anniversary, but he thinks he's being fired.  *****  Another heartwarming episode!!25.  The Tiger  --  While Doris is shopping, an escaped circus tiger slips into the back of her van.  ****1/2  Another great episode showing Doris's love for animals.26.  The Date  --  Doris sets up Juanita on a blind date.  ****A fine entry showcasing Naomi Stevens.27.  The Five Dollar Bill  --  Billy returns a wallet he has found to a neighborhod woman who later accuses him of stealing five dollars from it.  *****  Another superior effort with a great message!!  Outstanding!!28.  The Relatives --  When Buck, Leroy and the boys go camping, Leroy's cousins arrive and try to help Doris to work on the house.  ****  Another slapstick filled offering.  Harmless bucolic stuff.Extras:  A message from Doris Day about her Animal League.  Two television promos.

It became ""fashionable"" to ""hate Doris Day"" during the sexual revolution when people were freely falling into bed with every stranger they met and people were smoking pot up a storm.  Doris Day's ""image"" didn't fit into what they described as ""cool.""  Comics in nightclubs made Miss Day a target.  They ridiculed her ""virginity,"" her wholesomeness and innocense...the usual nonsense.Even though she was the #1 Female Movie Star in the history of films, her status was often dismissed by those who felt they were ""in the know,"" including a lot of film critics who dismissed Doris.Today, she is getting the recognition she so richly deserves.  Even thought she has not received a special Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, no Kennedy Center Honor, no American Film Institute tribute, no Grammy Lifetime Achievement recognition, I understand that those honors were offered to Doris Day, but she had declined to accept.Day has worked hard all of her life.  And before her son, Terry Melcher died, he arranged to have a wealth of material on his mother to be released to the public.  He was smart to wait until now with his mother's popularity growing by leaps and bounds by younger people who have just discovered the magic of Doris Day.Her records are selling as are her movies on DVD.  Now her TV show and I understand, her TV specials will also become available on DVD.  I recently received the Doris Day first season and was very impressed by the QUALITY of the packaging AND by the professionlism of Miss Day's performance on the series.  Damn, she was GOOD!  She is such a real and natural actress, it must have been elevating to work with her.  As a former actor, myself, I know what it's like to work with other good actors...they give you what you need.

Why?  Not because the scripts are extraordinary - they aren't, but because the DVD is so lovingly presented and contains such great bonus material as well as yet another glimpse into the incredible star power of Miss Doris Day.""The Doris Day Show"" was conceived without Miss Day's knowledge by her late husband Martin Melcher.  Until his passing in the spring of 1968, she had no idea she had been signed to star in this sitcom. Production commenced in the early summer of 1968 and despite her personal trauma as a result of her husband's passing after 17 years of marriage and some of the revelations about him that she was discovering, Doris plunged into this new venture with her characteristic pluck and determination.Still a considerable superstar in films, Miss Day had two hits playing in theatres in the summer of 1968. ""Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?"" was breaking all-time records at New York's Radio City Music Hall and ""With Six You get Eggroll"" released in August of 1968 was packing theatres nationwide and would eventually turn out to be one of the 12 top moneymaking films of Miss Day's 39 film career.""The Doris Day Show"" debuted on CBS in September, 1968 to great ratings but indifference and in some cases outright nastiness from some critics.While hardly the greatest project of Miss Day's career, it is a warm, sweet, buccolic, nicely cast comedy about a recently widowed mom of two, living on a farm in California with her sons, her dad, a handyman, housekeeper and a large dog.The plotlines are set around the always real occurrences of their lives. There may not be a lot of rip-roaring laughs but the viewer will find themself smiling broadly and nodding approvingly at what happens.The show's strength lies in its cast headed by Miss Day who looks amazing. From the opening credits - Miss Day warbling her signature hit, ""Whatever Will Be Will Be"" (Que Sera Sera) while frolicking in a lovely field, to the closing credits, she is never less than a delight. She makes every scene seem real. She is natural, endearing, never affected and instills more life into the sometimes corny dialogue than one would believe possible. She is a national treasure.Her scenes with Denver Pyle who plays her dad make one believe they are really father and daughter.Her boys are never sicky-sweet and their scenes with Doris are among the show's best. Miss Day had a wonderful onscreen affinity with those who played her on-screen offspring whether in ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies"", ""The Thrill of it All"" or the aforementioned ""Eggroll"". Few actresses can be as convincing.During the first season the guest stars ranged from Jodie Foster, just starting her career, to Mary Wickes, veteran of four Doris Day films.The bonus material includes two appearances by Miss Day on ""What's My Line"" the popular game show of the 50's, as well as a movie trailer, interviews with cast members and a preview of Season Two of the series, slated for release in October.""The Doris Day Show"" never aspires to be anything but a feelgood, lighthearted family show. On that level, it will provide many hours of satisfying entertainment starring a Hollywood legend whose artistry will amaze.",5,"DORIS SAVES THE ""DAY""!!",1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,3332,"['new', 'DVD', 'Release', 'first', 'season', 'popular', 'CBS', 'comedy', 'series', 'late', '60', '70', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Show', 'five', 'stars', 'Why', 'Not', 'scripts', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'are', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'so', 'lovingly', 'presented', 'contains', 'such', 'great', 'bonus', 'material', 'as', 'well', 'yet', 'glimpse', 'incredible', 'star', 'power', 'Miss', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Show', 'was', 'conceived', 'Miss', 'Day', 'knowledge', 'late', 'husband', 'Martin', 'Melcher', 'passing', 'spring', '1968', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'been', 'signed', 'star', 'sitcom', 'Production', 'commenced', 'early', 'summer', '1968', 'personal', 'trauma', 'result', 'husband', 'passing', '17', 'years', 'marriage', 'revelations', 'was', 'discovering', 'Doris', 'plunged', 'new', 'venture', 'characteristic', 'pluck', 'determination.Still', 'considerable', 'superstar', 'films', 'Miss', 'Day', 'had', 'two', 'hits', 'playing', 'theatres', 'summer', '1968', 'Where', 'Were', 'When', 'Lights', 'Went', 'Out', 'was', 'breaking', 'all-time', 'records', 'New', 'York', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'Six', 'get', 'Eggroll', 'released', 'August', '1968', 'was', 'packing', 'theatres', 'nationwide', 'would', 'eventually', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'one', '12', 'top', 'moneymaking', 'films', 'Miss', 'Day', '39', 'film', 'career', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Show', 'debuted', 'CBS', 'September', '1968', 'great', 'ratings', 'indifference', 'cases', 'outright', 'nastiness', 'critics.While', 'hardly', 'greatest', 'project', 'Miss', 'Day', 'career', 'warm', 'sweet', 'buccolic', 'nicely', 'cast', 'comedy', 'recently', 'widowed', 'mom', 'two', 'living', 'farm', 'California', 'sons', 'dad', 'handyman', 'housekeeper', 'large', 'dog.The', 'plotlines', 'are', 'set', 'always', 'real', 'occurrences', 'lives', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'lot', 'rip-roaring', 'laughs', 'viewer', 'will', 'find', 'themself', 'smiling', 'broadly', 'nodding', 'approvingly', 'what', 'happens.The', 'show', 'strength', 'cast', 'headed', 'Miss', 'Day', 'who', 'amazing', 'opening', 'Miss', 'Day', 'warbling', 'signature', 'hit', 'Will', 'Be', 'Will', 'Be', 'Que', 'Sera', 'Sera', 'frolicking', 'lovely', 'field', 'closing', 'credits', 'never', 'less', 'delight', 'scene', 'seem', 'real', 'natural', 'endearing', 'never', 'affected', 'instills', 'more', 'life', 'sometimes', 'dialogue', 'one', 'would', 'believe', 'possible', 'national', 'treasure.Her', 'scenes', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'who', 'dad', 'make', 'one', 'believe', 'are', 'really', 'father', 'daughter.Her', 'boys', 'are', 'never', 'sicky-sweet', 'scenes', 'Doris', 'are', 'show', 'best', 'Miss', 'Day', 'had', 'wonderful', 'onscreen', 'affinity', 'who', 'played', 'on-screen', 'offspring', 'Please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Eat', 'Daisies', 'Thrill', 'All', 'aforementioned', 'Eggroll', 'Few', 'actresses', 'can', 'be', 'convincing.During', 'first', 'season', 'guest', 'stars', 'ranged', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'just', 'starting', 'career', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'veteran', 'four', 'Doris', 'Day', 'films.The', 'bonus', 'material', 'two', 'appearances', 'Miss', 'Day', 'What', 'My', 'Line', 'popular', 'game', 'show', '50', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'trailer', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'preview', 'Season', 'Two', 'series', 'slated', 'release', 'October', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Show', 'never', 'be', 'anything', 'feelgood', 'lighthearted', 'family', 'show', 'level', 'will', 'provide', 'many', 'hours', 'satisfying', 'entertainment', 'starring', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'artistry', 'will', 'amaze']",Doris Day Show Season 1

It's wholesome, charming... it's family.In the first season (1968/69), Doris Martin is a widow with two boys, Billy (Philip Brown) and Toby (Tod Starke), and has come home to live with her father (Denver Pyle) on his farm.  The majority of the storylines are about farm life, the boys' activities and life around their little town.  The episodes are often endearing; such as ""Dinner for Mom,"" where the boys take Doris out for a birthday dinner and don't have enough money to pay.  For those used to the Doris of say ""Pillow Talk,"" she's different here:  a mom and a farm girl.  But she's still Doris - beautiful, glowing and with a personality to match.  There is one touch of glamour in an episode called ""The Fly Boy.""  She has a date with an air force colonel and turns up in a gorgeous dress, solidifying what I always thought...Barbie's got nothin' on Doris.  What a living doll.There are 28 episodes, the DVD quality is great and the color jumps off of the screen.  Bonus features include some enjoyable cast interviews with James Hampton, who played farmhand Leroy, and Philip Brown, who played oldest son Billy.  By the way, ""Billy"" grew up to be very attractive.  You will recognize him from several commercials that are currently airing.A true tribute to this show is that I've never been much of a farm girl, but it somehow seems so inviting.  I find myself wanting to hang around the farm with Doris and her family.

I can see why I didnt - its as corny as hell. I also see why Doris hated it. To her credit she gives it her all with all the ease of a pro. The casting and acting was pretty good. Pity about the storylines. I doubt this would do much on cable either. Its way too dated. They just dont make them this corny and this dull anymore.

I was so overjoyed when they put this series from yester-year on DVD.  I have all of Doris Day's movies.  I watch them on rainy days and during difficult times.  They uplift and entertain.  I especially like Pillow Talk.  Although she is also a dramatic actress, I enjoy her in comedys.  Her films always put me in a better mood.  Her films are very family friendly.  Television is so difficult to watch, and I know that is the fault of my generation.  We're the television executives and business persons putting all those horrible shows on T.V.--the other side of the baby boomers. I feel so badly for today's generation.  They have lost their sense of wholesome humor.

78130,A5LK5ZWKQ6SYQ,0788606344,Tiffany Hawk,"[0, 0]","I also published about this on tcm.com -- Turner Classic Movies website.Doris Day wrote in her own book how she didn't know her late husband Marty Melcher signed her up for a television series and that the script was disappointing. However, Doris also wrote in her book how the first season really helped her cope with her husband's death as it kept her mind off things. Regardless, I really enjoyed watching the first season of this show. It reminds me of shows like Andy Griffith with that warm family-quality to it. Denver Pyle does a great job playing Doris' father, his character being Buck Webb. Denver just has that rustic look to him. Philip Brown and Todd Starke portray Doris's two sons Billy and Toby. Phillip Brown has a special feature discussing how much he enjoyed working with Doris and how she was a mother-figure to him. The opening episode is very sweet with the two boys taking Doris out to dinner for her birthday. James Hampton plays Leroy, the helper on the farm. He's a funny character and I enjoyed watching him.... he also has a special feature discussing his work on the show. There are two housekeepers - Fran Ryan playing Aggie (she lasted a few episodes and then was gone with no mention but honestly I didn't care for her) and Naomi Stevens playing Juanita. Naomi to me was just better in the role as she played more a &#34;warm&#34; character and I liked her scenes with Doris Day.The second season does have Doris Day commuting to the city to take a job as a secretary at a magazine company called Today's World. There is a preview of the second season included.Overall, I really liked it. Very enjoyable and appropriate for all ages.
