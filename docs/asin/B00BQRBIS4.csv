1637639,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00BQRBIS4,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 2]","JAYNE MANSFIELD'S CAR (USA/Russia-2012) stars Robert Duvall, John Hurt, Billy Bob Thornton (who also scripted and directed), Robert Patrick and Kevin Bacon, with small roles for Shawnee Smith (TV'sBECKER), Tippi Hedrin (THE BIRDS) and Brent Briscoe (A SIMPLE PLAN).It's a guy's film, but not in a disgusting or violent way. This drama explores with some sensitivity three generations of a family from a small Alabama town. The patriarch, Jim (Duvall) is a WWI vet who spends his days monitoring the police band so he can visit the scenes of car accidents.His oldest son (Thornton) is 50 and still at home. ""Skip"" was a WWII pilot who crashed and sustained major burns. He's very much lost in the past, is like a big child and has three sports cars that are named for various fighter planes. The youngest, Carroll (Bacon), also a WWII vet, is now a dedicated anti-war protester and a hippie in his personal life. Carroll's own son is 18 and he's thinking of enlisting for service overseas. Naturally his peacenik dad hates the idea. The middle son (Patrick), Jimbo has a weight problem (it's strange seeing the T-1000 fromTERMINATOR 2looking portly). The only Caldwell male who never served in the military, he's ashamed of that and resentful of his brothers.Their mom, Naomi (Hedrin) left while the three were young. After a divorce from Jim she met an Englishman while vacationing in London. They married and had a family. Now it's over a quarter-century later and Naomi has died of cancer. Her last request was to be buried in her hometown, so the British family are coming to stay for a while. Each of them is equally quirky.The main tension of the story is how both family groups interact, collectively and one-on-one. It's clear the Alabama family wants to hate their guests, yet a couple of unusual relationships quickly develop. (The one involving Skip may be a main reason this picture is rated R.)I liked the story. It's no classic, but it's also not a bore.

1637646,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00BQRBIS4,DVD Verdict,"[1, 3]","While the premise of opposing families &#34;coming together&#34; is the conceit, Jayne Mansfield's Car is, at its core, a film about men who cannot let go of war. The problem is we don't know why they can't let go.Jim was a medic in World War I and now has a fascination with racing to car crash scenes to witness the devastating aftermath. (Remind me never to visit Morrison, by the way&#8212;too many car crashes around there.) His being &#34;traumatized by war&#34; is a good place to start, but writer/director/star Billy Bob Thornton (Sling Blade) simply expects us to accept that as the answer, and it isn't good enough. We don't know what happened to him decades prior to make him act this way.The same approach applies to Thornton's own character, Skip Caldwell (another of Jim's sons), who flew planes for the Navy in World War II. Skip is so obsessed with his naval career that he names his cars after planes and wears his dress whites to his mother's funeral. It's later suggested that he is looking for his father's approval, but it is also suggested that he has some type of psychological issue (which is also not examined). The latter is not only evidenced by general odd behavior, it's also on display when he asks his late mother's British stepdaughter, Camilla Bedford (Frances O'Connor, A.I. Artificial Intelligence), to recite literature to him in her British accent, while naked, so he can masturbate to that.Skip's brothers, Jimbo (Robert Patrick, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Carroll also served in WWII and are no better developed. Jimbo saw no action in the war yet he is their father's favorite (why?), and while Carroll saw action, he came home and became a hippy stoner peacenik (why?) who protests Vietnam because, well, protesting Vietnam is the default go-to for hippy stoner peaceniks. (His overall timeline strains credulity as well.) The Brits are no better. Kingsley is also a WWI vet and his son, Phillip (Ray Stevenson, Thor), is a WWII vet, and they don't get along either, to the point of airing their dirty knickers in front of their host family.As for the three women in the film (not counting the maid), two of them are promiscuous. It's perfectly fine for a woman to be promiscuous, of course, but at least give us some reason as to why, at least for the married one.This is what you get throughout the whole film from Billy Bob the Writer: tired facsimiles of characters we have seen in other movies, most of which were done better or at least fleshed out more than here. It's as if Thornton bought a book for first-time writers about creating fictional characters and this is what the book told him to do. He then leaves the rest up to you to flesh out. Billy Bob the Director isn't much better. His technical execution lacks any kind of flow, with odd shot choices, overly lengthy lingering, and a fixation on random slow-motion shots. This two-hour movie would have been better served&#8212;for what that's worth&#8212;by shaving 20 minutes of uselessness (including a ridiculous sequence where Jim winds up on an accidental acid trip).Thornton, like many of the other actors in this film, has an impressive resume, but when history revisits Jayne Mansfield's Car, it will be remembered as merely a footnote.The anamorphic 1080p imagery is sharp, which is a mixed blessing. While it presents the viewer with a great picture&#8212;particularly in the darker scenes&#8212;it exposes some of the worst lighting choices I've seen in film this year. The crisp picture also exposes the sets. They don't look fake, they just don't look genuine. I kept thinking of historic vacation spots where tourists can walk through rooms &#34;just like folks had back then.&#34; It's almost as if the designers tried so hard to get it right that they got it too right. All of the dialogue and ambient noise from the disc's Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio track are clear and discernible.There is only one extra (seriously; there aren't even any trailers for other DVDs). It's a 9-minute behind-the-scenes that offers film clips and footage interspersed with actor interviews. It's remarkably vanilla.-Michael Nazarewycz, DVD VERDICTSee full review at dvdverdict.com",2,A film about men who cannot let go of war.

1637647,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00BQRBIS4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 6]","JAYNE MANSFIELD'S CAR (Writ./Dir. Billy Bob Thornton, 2012, 123 minutes) ~One thing to say about this refreshing dark comedy right off the bat is that it deals with generations we have mostly forgotten. This film concentrates on a wealthy Alabama family, with the patriarch (Robert Duvall) a WWI vet and his three sons veterans of WWII. The year is 1969 and his two sons who saw combat (Billy Bob Thornton and Kevin Bacon) remain extremely close while the son who did not see WWII combat sits sourly at home, living with his father as does Billy Bob.The ""hippy"" son, Kevin Bacon, has a fine mansion of his own where he and all his WWII vet buddies smoke dope and drop acid all night--and for all the world they are like our generation of Vietnam vets, protesting the war (which those WWII vets originally started). But the big hit comes with news of the family mother's death. Having left the family and run off to England, she returned only to obtain a divorce. The story picks up when the family is notified that she has died of cancer--and her English family honors her wish to be returned to and buried in Alabama.Thornton, it is sad to say, has relatively unknown or lousy writing and directing credits. This, for a change, is a true masterpiece. While I anticipated what a stuffy little English family would be like in the climactically hostile environs of the South, I totally forgot the WWII vets' generation and horrors they suffered. Within this film, Thornton reminds us that the parents of that generation fought WWI and were equally affected.Finally he squeezes in a message about how the innocent young third generation will go off to fight in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. As usual, I perceive Thornton to be sensitive to all types of people though he seems to have obsessions as an actor, director and writer that I have seen all too often: the deep South, graphic accidents on the road, blood, and sex. I have observed also that Thornton sometimes zeroes in on perverted personalities and what might have made them that way.He handles the English family (headed up by the immortal John Hurt) with equal understanding and tact. One thing I never even dreamed I'd see was John Hurt and Robert Duvall together in a film--yet here they are, and they shine, shine, shine! Same can be said, though, when I think of Kevin Bacon and Billy Bob Thornton himself, handing in smash performances. This film is one of those that made me laugh, cry and feel creeped out simultaneously. Good ole Billy Bob!Yet I have an example of the wholseome kind of belly-laugh Thornton can induce: in a scene with him and the young British lady, he croons over her accent, then looks away wistfully and says, ""I wish I could speak English."" And the beauty is it is immediately understandable and makes perfect sense. A sad example that made me ache with sympathy is when he visits his brother (Kevin Bacon) and asks, ""Have ya got any medicine?""--his brother says yes and gives him some marijuana, which is obviously for his pain both inner and outer.Thornton seems attracted to people who are severely damaged, perhaps not broken but about-to-be-broken, and therein lies his strength as a writer and director. He takes these characters and shows us ourselves, then he veers off into deeper waters. Though Thornton plays a WWII vet and his brother played by Kevin Bacon is a Nam vet, in so many ways Bacon is his caretaker.If Thornton continues to do stories like this, he will surely follow on the heels of Clint Eastwood.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[6, 6]","JAYNE MANSFIELD'S CAR is a film filled with many pleasures, including a host of brilliant performances and an uncanny recreation of a past time and place.Set in 1969 rural Alabama, the multi-character story deals, in part, with how different generations of a family deal with the experience of war.  In this case, it&#8217;s the wealthy, dysfunctional Caldwell clan, headed by Robert Duvall, a WWI vet, father of three sons (Robert Patrick, Kevin Bacon and Billy Bob Thornton) and a daughter (Katherine LaNasa).The three brothers are still suffering, in different ways, from their experiences during WWII, while the daughter is trapped in a marriage with two daughters and a boorish husband.The death of Duvall&#8217;s long estranged wife and the children&#8217;s mother forces many unspoken truths into the open.  The deceased woman&#8217;s second husband (John Hurt) and his two grown kids (Ray Stevenson, Frances O&#8217;Connor) by his first wife travel from their home in England to attend her burial in her Alabama.  This family has its own dysfunctional elements that spark unexpected collisions, some of them romantic, with and within the Caldwell clan.More of a black comedy rather than a straight drama, JAYNE MANSFIELD'S CAR was co-written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton.  Unfortunately, the parts (e.g. performances, individual scenes) are more effective than the film as a whole, which runs far too long and can&#8217;t really decide on an ending.  Although all of the actors are superb and their scenes are well written, the overall movie might have been better served without such an abundance of intriguing characters.  By eliminating three or four of them, Thornton would have wound up with a tighter, less meandering picture.The problem is: Which characters do you cut?The Blu-Ray disc from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a &#8220;Behind the Scenes&#8221; featurette.

As the movie opens, we are told that we are in &#34;Alabama, 1969&#34; and we get to know the Caldwell clan, with Jim Caldwell (played by Robert Duvall) as the patriarch, and his kids, including brothers Skip (played by Billy Bob Thornton), Carroll (played by Kevin Bacon) and Alan (played by Marshall Allman). One day, a phone call comes in the England, with the new that Jim's ex-wife (she had divorced him and remarried some guy in England) has died and her will was to be buried in Alabama. Her English husband and his (adult) son and daughter are soon arriving in Alabama, and a clash of cultures sets in. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie was directed and co-written by Billy Bob Thornton, so you can say that this is his labor of love. Second, it takes quite a while for this movie to &#34;find its groove&#34; but when it does, I was actually taken in by it. Indeed, while there is quite a bit of attention to the culture clash and the fact that Americans and Brits are &#34;separated by language&#34; (Skip to the British woman: &#34;your accent sure is pretty!&#34;), the main theme that emerges is that all the men were involved in one way or another in WWII. The best moment of the movie comes when Skip and the British woman are alone, and Skip finally lets his guard go and recounts the full story of what happened to him as a Navy pilot in WWII, more than 25 years ago. Be ready to be surprised...This movie was announced sometime in Fall of 2013 at my local art house theatre here in Cincinnati as &#34;coming soon&#34;, but for whatever reason never made it here. I had pretty much forgotten about this when I happen to notice the DVD, so I just had to pick it up and check it out. Bottom line: yes, there are weak stretches in this movie, in particular in the first hour, but the second hour made up for it in my book. If you are interested in a different take on how war affects people's lives over the long run and in some unexpected ways, I'd say this is worth checking out.",4,3.5 stars...

This film is a muddled mess.  And, yes, I lived through the era (in college from 1967 - 1971).  While I knew some Viet Nam vets who were against the VN war, I never met a WWII vet who was, at least not militantly so.  So that removed any validity or honesty from Kevin Bacon character for me.  And while Robert Duvall is a great actor, he is given little to work with here, other than much muttering and gazing at the horizon.For the record, I get why the patriarch is fascinated with carnage.  Has something to do with his seeing so much death in France as a medic during WWI.  Thus the title of the film, and the viewing of the car(s) and bodies.  This whole enterprise, however, is just too self-important.  As one who grew up in the north but has chosen to live in the deep south for the past 45 years, I see the typical Hollywood errors, such as the usage of &#34;y'all&#34; in the singular and accents which are slightly off.

1637660,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00BQRBIS4,Sheryl Fechter,"[4, 4]","Billy Bob Thornton, co-wrote, directed, and acts in this depiction of a military family during 1969 in Morrison Alabama.  A character study, of sorts, about the diverse ways each of the family members considers their present day lives through the looking glass of their individual pasts, mainly their time spent in the military.  The vast differences shown in these people culminate in the death of Naomi.  She was the mother of the three boys, Jimbo (Robert Patrick), an Army man not seeing in any combat, Skip (Billy Bob Thornton), a Navy man, Carroll (Kevin Bacon), a Marine and presently a Vietnam protester, and daughter, Donna (Katherine LaNasa). Also included in the cast is Donna's husband, Neal (Ron White).  He adds realistic comic relief into this familial themed and darkly comedic look into dysfunctional family life after having returned home from the wars (WWI and WWII).  That isn't to say that this movie does not have its lighter moments as there are plenty.Naomi's ex-husband, Jim Caldwell (Robert Duvall), was not the sort of person that could give her what she needed.  He is very short on patience, emotion, or the display of it, and certainly, tolerance.  Because she needed so much more in her life, she divorced him and moved on to remarry Kingsley Bedford (John Hurt, in a multilayered role) in England and continue her life there with his family, Phillip (Ray Stevenson), and Camilla (Francis O'Connor).  Jim and Naomi's relationship isn't shown, but is spoken of often. Jim remained in Alabama raising their children to adulthood and watched them each head off into one or another part of military service.  All three of the sons, along with their father, differ in their personal conclusions of wartime except for knowing that it equally changed their opinions on life.Jim Caldwell is a complicated, and, mostly, an uncompromising man except during the hours he obsessively listens to his radio.  He endlessly waits for an automobile accident or a tragic local wreck, sometimes being the first to arrive at the scene.  While many may find this a very obsessive commitment, I saw it much differently.  During his time in the war Jim was a medic caring for soldiers in urgent need of medical care, some near death if even alive.  Much later in the film he states to Kingsley, with great compassion, that there were times the wounded men were only offered a short drink of booze and a prayer.  He goes to the scenes of accidents now for these injured people because it gives him the purpose which he had in the Army; a much higher purpose than a complacent family life which seems to just frustrate him.The two separate families of Naomi come together for the funeral and things finally take a friendly turn for the lively blend especially the husbands, past and most recent.  They begin a familiar discourse, an ability to see that a thing such as communication within a family is strained regardless of nationality, history, and children.  Take the character of Skip, a complex and intricate man who actually made my heart hurt with his sufferings.  For that matter, so did Carroll.  Their private pain is intolerable.  The very last scene of the movie concerning Carroll absolutely stole my breath away; I could not tear my eyes from his face.This is an intriguing, ensemble cast movie for those who do enjoy thinking about all of the reasons why.  I found myself asking questions constantly while at first some things seemed so very odd then soon made perfect sense.  That goes for the title of the movie also, ""Jayne Mansfield's Car"".",5,"""Is It Really That Cold And Dark Inside You That You Can't Even Hug Your Son?"" - Carroll",1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,3565,"['Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'depiction', 'military', 'family', '1969', 'Morrison', 'Alabama', 'A', 'character', 'study', 'sorts', 'diverse', 'ways', 'family', 'members', 'considers', 'present', 'day', 'looking', 'glass', 'individual', 'pasts', 'mainly', 'time', 'spent', 'military', 'vast', 'differences', 'shown', 'people', 'culminate', 'death', 'Naomi', 'was', 'mother', 'three', 'boys', 'Jimbo', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Army', 'man', 'not', 'seeing', 'combat', 'Skip', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Navy', 'man', 'Carroll', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Marine', 'presently', 'Vietnam', 'protester', 'daughter', 'Donna', 'Katherine', 'LaNasa', 'Also', 'included', 'cast', 'Donna', 'husband', 'Neal', 'Ron', 'White', 'realistic', 'comic', 'relief', 'familial', 'themed', 'darkly', 'comedic', 'look', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'life', 'having', 'returned', 'home', 'wars', 'WWI', 'WWII', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'lighter', 'moments', 'are', 'plenty.Naomi', 'ex-husband', 'Jim', 'Caldwell', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'was', 'not', 'sort', 'person', 'could', 'give', 'what', 'needed', 'very', 'short', 'patience', 'emotion', 'display', 'certainly', 'tolerance', 'needed', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'life', 'divorced', 'moved', 'remarry', 'Kingsley', 'Bedford', 'John', 'Hurt', 'multilayered', 'role', 'England', 'continue', 'life', 'family', 'Phillip', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Camilla', 'Francis', ""O'Connor"", 'Jim', 'Naomi', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'shown', 'spoken', 'often', 'Jim', 'remained', 'Alabama', 'raising', 'children', 'adulthood', 'watched', 'head', 'one', 'part', 'military', 'service', 'three', 'sons', 'father', 'differ', 'personal', 'conclusions', 'wartime', 'knowing', 'equally', 'changed', 'opinions', 'life.Jim', 'Caldwell', 'complicated', 'mostly', 'uncompromising', 'man', 'hours', 'obsessively', 'radio', 'endlessly', 'automobile', 'accident', 'tragic', 'local', 'wreck', 'sometimes', 'being', 'first', 'arrive', 'scene', 'many', 'may', 'find', 'very', 'obsessive', 'commitment', 'saw', 'much', 'differently', 'time', 'war', 'Jim', 'was', 'medic', 'caring', 'soldiers', 'urgent', 'need', 'medical', 'care', 'death', 'even', 'alive', 'Much', 'later', 'film', 'Kingsley', 'great', 'compassion', 'were', 'times', 'wounded', 'men', 'were', 'only', 'offered', 'short', 'drink', 'booze', 'prayer', 'scenes', 'accidents', 'now', 'injured', 'people', 'purpose', 'had', 'Army', 'much', 'higher', 'purpose', 'complacent', 'family', 'life', 'just', 'frustrate', 'him.The', 'two', 'separate', 'families', 'Naomi', 'come', 'together', 'funeral', 'things', 'finally', 'take', 'friendly', 'turn', 'lively', 'blend', 'especially', 'husbands', 'past', 'most', 'recent', 'begin', 'familiar', 'discourse', 'ability', 'see', 'thing', 'such', 'communication', 'family', 'strained', 'regardless', 'nationality', 'history', 'children', 'Take', 'character', 'Skip', 'complex', 'intricate', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'made', 'heart', 'hurt', 'sufferings', 'matter', 'so', 'did', 'Carroll', 'private', 'pain', 'intolerable', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'concerning', 'Carroll', 'absolutely', 'stole', 'breath', 'away', 'could', 'not', 'tear', 'eyes', 'face.This', 'intriguing', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'movie', 'who', 'do', 'enjoy', 'thinking', 'reasons', 'why', 'found', 'asking', 'questions', 'constantly', 'first', 'things', 'seemed', 'so', 'very', 'odd', 'then', 'soon', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'title', 'movie', 'also', 'Jayne', 'Mansfield', 'Car']","Jayne Mansfield's Car [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.4 Import - Australia ]"

You might be surprised what happens.&#34; A family that is already at odds with each other is dealt another big blow. Their mother, who they haven't seen in a long time (because she moved to England and remarried) has died and wishes to be buried in Alabama. To make matters worse her new family is coming as well and the old and new meet for the first time. This is a difficult movie to explain. It's not bad but it's not that good either. The acting is great but the story is weak. There doesn't seem to be a flow from one scene to the other but I stayed interested. The movie is really one big contradiction to itself. If you watch it you will see what I mean. I will say that I thought the movie was OK but nothing I would watch again or bring up in the &#34;have you seen this lately&#34; conversation, but on the other hand it is full of some great acting and it's worth seeing for that reason alone. This is nothing more then a family trying to figure itself out and Duvall plays the same part he did in Slingblade...but this time he talks. Overall, a hard movie to explain because nothing really happens but I did think it was OK. Watch it and you will see what I mean, but it's hard to recommend.
