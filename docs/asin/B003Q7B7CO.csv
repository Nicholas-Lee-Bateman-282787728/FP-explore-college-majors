Other than that, a large part of the movie was taken up by showing the ""emotional issues"" christians were having gambling and being in a casino to begin with.  In my view there is some serious contridictions in what their doing and what they profess to believe. But I am basicaly interested in card counting and not interested in watching a bunch of confused christian nuts having issues with what they were doing. (obviously greed) One interesting part was when a non-christian was admitted to the team and one of the hardcore team member nutjobs, heard God ""talking to him"" and told all the other christans that ""God told him this non-christian  was stealing money"" and the rest of them, including the leaders kicked him off the team without any proof whatsoever that the poor guy did anything wrong outside of not being a born again chrisitan. Really made the team look SUPER LAME. The team leaders, Ben and Colin were not impressive and lost control of their team, what was going on, and how weak the ""counters"" on the team actually were and begin relying on prayer and chrisitianity to get thier problems fixed...All in all, for the person with a serious interest in card counting, the movie is a complete and total waste of time.

1358766,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B003Q7B7CO,Doctor.Generosity,"[3, 6]","Although many will see this film simply as a true crime drama and classic collision of good and evil, it is more, perhaps more than the creators even intended. Here is a new take on Jewish religious life today - or even on all religious life in the world today.Set in the New York Hasidic community, it tracks a true story from 1999 how a few young Orthodox boys, those who were either disaffected or naive, were somehow drawn into a world of illegal drug smuggling between NY and Amsterdam. What better disguise for a drug smuggler than the clothes and demeanor of an extreme religious sect? The producer of the movie, Danny Abeckaser, also acts in it as the underworld mastermind Jackie Solomon. Abeckaser is by far the best actor here, convincing as the non-religious Israeli tough guy who is cynical enough to manipulate naive young Orthodox boys for his own benefit - while at the same time holding a cultural affection for them. (I found Jesse Eisenberg - who later become better known as the lead playing Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network - much less convincing, swooning his way pathetically from one crisis to another.) The movie gets its resonance from being a true story; you can't make this stuff up. For those who know the New York black-hat Jewish community, it is a dismaying tale, showing shortcomings of the Hasidic way of life where young people have no secular education, not even exposure to television. They learn only religious law and ritual, the idea being to keep them untainted by the darkness of the world. But here we see it backfire; a few of them at least did not seem to grasp that aiding criminals in smuggling contraband is also forbidden by the Ten Commandments. Even more depressing, the story from 1999 was repeated in 2009 when two Hasidic boys from Jerusalem were arrested in Tokyo with suitcases full of ecstasy. They remain in prison.There is something implied here about the bifurcated role of religion in the modern world, not only Judaism but also Islam and Christianity. While the world as a whole becomes more secularized, religious minorities become more extreme, more fundamentalist, more isolated and more withdrawn from everyday life. This story is a stark lesson of the fragility which results.Final note: movie would have been more successful with a better title - 'holy rollers' has a different connotation.",5,When a religious way of life meets the dark side,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,2363,"['many', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'simply', 'true', 'crime', 'drama', 'classic', 'collision', 'good', 'evil', 'more', 'perhaps', 'more', 'creators', 'even', 'intended', 'Here', 'new', 'take', 'Jewish', 'religious', 'life', 'today', 'even', 'religious', 'life', 'world', 'today.Set', 'New', 'York', 'Hasidic', 'community', 'true', 'story', '1999', 'how', 'few', 'young', 'Orthodox', 'boys', 'who', 'were', 'either', 'disaffected', 'naive', 'were', 'somehow', 'drawn', 'world', 'illegal', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'NY', 'Amsterdam', 'What', 'better', 'disguise', 'drug', 'smuggler', 'clothes', 'demeanor', 'extreme', 'religious', 'sect', 'producer', 'movie', 'Danny', 'Abeckaser', 'also', 'underworld', 'mastermind', 'Jackie', 'Solomon', 'Abeckaser', 'far', 'best', 'actor', 'here', 'convincing', 'non-religious', 'Israeli', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'cynical', 'enough', 'manipulate', 'naive', 'young', 'Orthodox', 'boys', 'own', 'benefit', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'holding', 'cultural', 'affection', 'found', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'who', 'later', 'become', 'better', 'known', 'lead', 'playing', 'Mark', 'Zuckerberg', 'Social', 'Network', 'much', 'less', 'convincing', 'swooning', 'way', 'pathetically', 'one', 'crisis', 'movie', 'resonance', 'being', 'true', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'stuff', 'up', 'who', 'know', 'New', 'York', 'black-hat', 'Jewish', 'community', 'dismaying', 'tale', 'showing', 'shortcomings', 'Hasidic', 'way', 'life', 'where', 'young', 'people', 'have', 'secular', 'education', 'not', 'even', 'exposure', 'television', 'learn', 'only', 'religious', 'law', 'ritual', 'idea', 'being', 'keep', 'untainted', 'darkness', 'world', 'here', 'see', 'few', 'least', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'grasp', 'aiding', 'criminals', 'smuggling', 'contraband', 'also', 'forbidden', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Even', 'more', 'depressing', 'story', '1999', 'was', 'repeated', '2009', 'when', 'two', 'Hasidic', 'boys', 'Jerusalem', 'were', 'arrested', 'Tokyo', 'suitcases', 'full', 'ecstasy', 'remain', 'prison.There', 'something', 'implied', 'here', 'bifurcated', 'role', 'religion', 'modern', 'world', 'not', 'only', 'Judaism', 'also', 'Islam', 'Christianity', 'world', 'whole', 'more', 'secularized', 'religious', 'minorities', 'become', 'more', 'extreme', 'more', 'fundamentalist', 'more', 'isolated', 'more', 'withdrawn', 'everyday', 'life', 'story', 'stark', 'lesson', 'fragility', 'results.Final', 'note', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'better', 'title', 'rollers', 'different', 'connotation']",N/A
1358767,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003Q7B7CO,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","HOLY ROLLERS (dir. Kevin Asch, 2010, 89 minutes) based on a heartbreaking true story. Jesse Eisenberg plays Sam Gold, a young Hasidic Jew from Brooklyn who gets almost imperceptibly sucked into the ugly world of drug trafficking. Along with his rather devil-may-care fellow Hasid Yosef (an incongruously scary Justin Bartha), he becomes entangled in a web of international drug smuggling, specifically Ecstasy.Set in 1998, the story goes that innocent Hasidic Jews were being convinced to be mules for the traffickers. They'd get sucked into thinking they were smuggling medicines for wealthy people - it is probably the central definition of a mule. Sam courts and eventually partners with the evil drug lord, who happens to be a 'fallen' Jew, and soon becomes the snare to trap innocent people into muling for the drug ring.For all the hype that this is a true story, and Sam Gold finds his way clear to a good life after serving some time, the film unsettled me with its lousy home-video quality and style. The soundtrack is a nice reminder of the cool 90s techno (that was already on its way out in 1998). The cinematography is good, but not good enough. Of course I asked myself, how else would a story like this be shot? Theater-style? Mockumentary style, which I hate?There's a little poem I sometimes say to myself after a film like this: They did what they could, and some of it is good. I don't think Eisenberg was a major player at the time, but he does carry the film. He's just not a very good actor. He is able to run through Hebrew prayers fairly expertly, but then I suspect he's run through them for real so that is no major accomplishment.Get this: it is an invaluable lesson, it certainly teaches certain things extremely well. The identification and ending of Jewish-on-Jewish abuse has been a major campaign of mine for over a decade, and this film shows Jews at their worst. Only the documentary IN SATMAR CUSTODY (not available from Amazon, sorry folks, complain to Amazon already) shows the problem even better. The main issue - drugs and smuggling - is terribly clear in this film.What is odd is I saw this while reading Harry Kemelman's Rabbi Small mystery, SUNDAY THE RABBI STAYED HOME -- BARGAIN BOOK (see my review), which deals with drug dealing in the Jewish community. If Kemelman ever knew anything about THIS true story, it must have whitened his hair!With the talents of Ari Graynor, Jason Fuchs, and Bern Cohen.",4,"In the Garden, G-d called out to Adam, ""Where are you?""",1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,2447,"['HOLY', 'ROLLERS', 'dir', 'Kevin', 'Asch', '2010', '89', 'minutes', 'based', 'heartbreaking', 'true', 'story', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Sam', 'Gold', 'young', 'Hasidic', 'Jew', 'Brooklyn', 'who', 'almost', 'imperceptibly', 'sucked', 'ugly', 'world', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'rather', 'devil-may-care', 'fellow', 'Hasid', 'Yosef', 'incongruously', 'scary', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'entangled', 'web', 'international', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'specifically', 'Ecstasy.Set', '1998', 'story', 'innocent', 'Hasidic', 'Jews', 'were', 'being', 'convinced', 'be', 'mules', 'traffickers', ""'d"", 'get', 'sucked', 'thinking', 'were', 'smuggling', 'medicines', 'wealthy', 'people', 'probably', 'central', 'definition', 'mule', 'Sam', 'courts', 'eventually', 'partners', 'evil', 'drug', 'lord', 'who', 'be', ""'fallen"", 'Jew', 'soon', 'snare', 'trap', 'innocent', 'people', 'muling', 'drug', 'hype', 'true', 'story', 'Sam', 'Gold', 'way', 'clear', 'good', 'life', 'serving', 'time', 'film', 'unsettled', 'lousy', 'home-video', 'quality', 'style', 'soundtrack', 'nice', 'reminder', 'cool', '90s', 'techno', 'was', 'already', 'way', '1998', 'cinematography', 'good', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'course', 'asked', 'how', 'else', 'would', 'story', 'be', 'shot', 'Theater-style', 'Mockumentary', 'style', 'hate', 'little', 'poem', 'sometimes', 'say', 'myself', 'film', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Eisenberg', 'was', 'major', 'player', 'time', 'carry', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'able', 'run', 'Hebrew', 'prayers', 'fairly', 'expertly', 'then', 'suspect', 'run', 'real', 'major', 'accomplishment.Get', 'invaluable', 'lesson', 'certainly', 'certain', 'things', 'extremely', 'well', 'identification', 'ending', 'Jewish-on-Jewish', 'abuse', 'been', 'major', 'campaign', 'mine', 'decade', 'film', 'Jews', 'worst', 'Only', 'documentary', 'IN', 'SATMAR', 'CUSTODY', 'not', 'available', 'Amazon', 'sorry', 'folks', 'complain', 'Amazon', 'already', 'problem', 'even', 'better', 'main', 'issue', 'drugs', 'smuggling', 'terribly', 'clear', 'film.What', 'odd', 'saw', 'reading', 'Harry', 'Kemelman', 'Rabbi', 'Small', 'mystery', 'SUNDAY', 'THE', 'RABBI', 'STAYED', 'HOME', 'BARGAIN', 'BOOK', 'see', 'review', 'drug', 'dealing', 'Jewish', 'community', 'Kemelman', 'ever', 'knew', 'anything', 'THIS', 'true', 'story', 'must', 'have', 'whitened', 'hair', 'talents', 'Ari', 'Graynor', 'Jason', 'Fuchs', 'Bern', 'Cohen']",N/A

1358769,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B003Q7B7CO,Jason Bean,"[4, 7]","I love independent films and 'Holy Rollers' is a good, indie crime-thriller in the best sense. It uses it's minimal budget quite well drawing us into the everyday life of it's protagonist then using character-development and good direction to tell a crime-story that, while familiar never gets boring.'Holy Rollers' is about Shmuel (or ""Sam"") a Hasidic Jew who's studying to become a rabbi and wants to start his own family in his community. When he starts to get frustrated with his family's traditional ways (and lack of money) and his failure with an arranged marriage Sam meets his neighbor, Yosef who draws him into the criminal world of smuggling drugs. While you can pretty much guess how this story plays out it's the film's contrasting of these two worlds (the slow, difficult traditional life vs. the fast and easy criminal life) that make it so engaging. I myself am unfamiliar with the Jewish and Hasidic traditions and was fascinated with the film's portrayal of this community. You really feel Sam's frustrations and restlessness with his family and can understand why he makes the choices he does.Jesse Eisenberg is getting a lot of recognition for his performance in 'Social Network' but I think he's equally good as Sam giving a sort of 'every-person' performance that I found perfectly relatable. Also good is Justin Bartha as Yosef who's eager to take Sam under his wing but starts to get uncomfortable when Sam proves the smarter criminal.While 'Holy Rollers' doesn't exactly tell an original story and is a bit lower-key than a lot of other crime films it is very well-made and gives us a look into a community that rarely gets explored in film.

1358770,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B003Q7B7CO,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 1]","Set in 1998, our story (inspired by true events) follows a twenty year old Hasidic Jew (Sammy) who is every bit as quirky as the actor playing the role (Jesse Eisenberg; Roger Dodger, Zombieland, The Social Network)--but, then, Eisenberg is always twitchy, isn't he?  Feeling the normal Hasidic coming-of-age pressures as he is about to be married, he is morally taunted by his rebellious, fast-talking, unorthodox neighbor Yosef (Justin Bartha; National Treasure 1 & 2, The Hangover, The Hangover 2) who watches reality shows, talks about fake titties, and smokes.  Just FYI, these do not follow the typical Hasidic canon.Living in a financially struggling household and helping with the family business, Sammy worries about providing for his future arranged wife.  So, he naively accepts an offer from Yosef to import ""medicine"" from Amsterdam.  Upon their return, Sammy discovers that they had been moving drugs (ecstasy) and feels conflicted about it.  From this point, we see Sammy slowly transform, shedding his morals one by one, into a drug dealer's right hand man.Sammy and his humble father wrestle about the importance of money versus happiness as he lies to him about his whereabouts.  The father's character, while little more than ancillary, brings a strong sincerity to the film; a moral compass that keeps the audience from becoming slowly corrupted without noticing the change--much as Sammy is, scene by scene, throughout the story.  Sammy slips smoothly into the clothes of another personality completely unaware until he turns and sees his former self in his wake, like a hollow cast chrysalis.As Yosef, Bartha, whom we're accustomed to seeing in more charming roles innocently sporting an ""aw shucks"" smile, performs brilliantly as Sammy's loose cannon field trainer.  Jackie (Sammy and Yosef's dealer-employer) is a noteworthy character as well. And his girlfriend, Rachel, is much like Almost Famous' Kate Hudson.A few jabs were taken at the Jewish community by way of some well-placed lines...Referring to a drug dealer, Eisenberg asks ""Do you trust him?""Bartha replies with ""Of course. He's Jewish.""Bartha, insinuating that no one would suspect the Jewish people of moving drugs, advises Eisenberg to ""Relax, mind your business, and act Jewish.""Drug Dealer: ""I've never heard Jews complain so much about making money. Jesus Christ!""Bartha, rationalizing his profession, explains ""You know, Jews have been smuggling for thousands of years.""Most good movies allow us to watch characters develop.  In Holy Rollers, we see Eisenberg transform.  Other character-transformative films include Almost Famous, Donnie Brasco and The Devil's Double.  The parallels between these movies and Holy Roller are strong.  See this movie.

1358774,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003Q7B7CO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 2]","Note: The product page has combined two DIFFERENT movies with the same title.  This is for the Jesse Eisenberg drama, not the card counting documentary.  I informed the big A, but it doesn't look like they're inclined to separate the reviews.In truth, I had never heard of the picture ""Holy Rollers"" but the idea of Jesse Eisenberg as a Hasidic Jew who becomes entrenched in a drug mule operation held an undeniable appeal. And this film is one of those undiscovered little gems--it may not rock your world, but it's a solidly constructed character study based on a real world case. Funny, moving, and suspenseful--I quite enjoyed this film. The depiction of Eisenberg's orthodox upbringing is well served, but his decision to color outside the lines is also believably demonstrated. As he is seduced to the dark side, the transition is well wrought. In fact, I think this is one of Eisenberg's most well rounded performances--one that uses his offbeat mannerisms to good affect.The story, in and of itself, is undeniably fascinating--it documents a ring of Ecstasy smugglers in the late nineties who transported their wares internationally using the least likely suspects. Justin Bartha colorfully portrays the neighborhood bad boy who eschews the conventional expectations of the Hasidic community. Eisenberg is his neighbor and friend who becomes a bit disillusioned as his life does not seem to be going precisely as planned. When Bartha proposes an opportunity for Eisenberg to score some cash for traveling to Amsterdam, he is reluctant. But after an initial foray into this new venture, he begins to embrace it more and more. The corruption of innocence and the seduction of power are primary themes in this tale of lawlessness. But how far is he willing to go? And is there any way out?A taut and succinct screenplay maintains the film's momentum as Eisenberg rises in importance. The movie does a great job documenting the real danger of the enterprise and undeniable allure it holds for our young protagonist. Wrestling the classic demons of evil versus good, Eisenberg relates the moral and ethical dilemma with precision. But Bartha also steals just about every scene he's in! Clearly on a path to destruction, he nevertheless maintains a charisma and likability that keeps the film grounded. The film doesn't provide an easy out and everyone must face the consequences of their choices. ""Holy Rollers"" is quite entertaining and an easy recommendation, but beware of the hyperbole of one critic that is printed on the DVD. Comparing this to ""Scarface"" or ""The Godfather"" will set unreasonable expectations. It shares some of the same basic themes, but this small and understated film is much more specific in its tone and modest in its goals!

1358775,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B003Q7B7CO,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 7]","This recent 2010 film is based on a true story that happened in the late 1990s.  A group of Hasidic Jews from Brooklyn were used as couriers to smuggle large quantities of ecstasy from Amsterdam into the United States.  They were able to get away with it for a while because with their distinctive way of dressing they do not meet the profile of drug dealers.  Jessie Eisenberg is cast in the role of Sam,  the innocent who gets corrupted.  He is 20 years old, shy around women, and dislikes working in his father's fabric business.  His friend, Yosef, played by Justin Bartha, is also an orthodox Jew  but is much more worldly. He recruits Sam by telling him he is importing medicine.  That ruse works for only a little while and then the young Sam gets smarter, is introduced to the high life in Amsterdam and starts to enjoy the money and the criminality.How this all turns out is predictable, of course, but I really did enjoy this film.
