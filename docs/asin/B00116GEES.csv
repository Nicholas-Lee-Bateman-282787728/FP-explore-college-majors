1130028,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00116GEES,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[21, 21]","By 1991 The Cosby Show was not exactly the commercial powerhouse it had been in the mid to late 80's but remained the hottest game in town. As with many a last season this series ties up many loose ends. There are five main plot points the generally extend throughout the seasons,sort of as mini story arcs: Cousin Pam trying to apply to collage and coping with Charmaine going away to collage,Cliff trying to build a private room for Clair now that most of the kids are away,Theo preparing for his upcoming graduation,somewhat of a teenage ""love traigle"" between Rudy,Kenny and their respective loves interests and new collage student Vanessa's truly bizzare relationship with the older but self sufficiant Dabnis,whom Cliff takes a shining to because of his abilities as a tinker. There are some funny moments this season but for the most part the episodes concentrate on developing and closing the story arcs and thus the characters themselves. Another important part of this season is that this is the very first season of The Cosby Show where Lisa Bonet doesn't make even a single physical appearance in the show;Dennise is only refered to casually in select episodes and is only spoken to over the phone (we don't hear her voice) in the finale. That finale is the 44 minute ""And So We Commence"",involving Theo's collage graduation and Olivia departing to join Dennise and Martin in Singapore (as well as finding out she's becomming a big sister). So this is a pretty good season but the wacky humor and individually great episodes are sacrificed in favor to tieing up the loose ends for the shows enevitable conclusion. It was kind of a sad day when the Huxtables left the airwaves in 1992;I personally believe prime time family comedy just hasn't been the same since then.",4,The Curtain Goes Down On The Huxtables,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,1779,"['1991', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'commercial', 'powerhouse', 'had', 'been', 'mid', 'late', '80', 'remained', 'hottest', 'game', 'town', 'many', 'last', 'season', 'series', 'up', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'five', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'generally', 'extend', 'seasons', 'sort', 'mini', 'story', 'arcs', 'Cousin', 'Pam', 'trying', 'apply', 'collage', 'coping', 'Charmaine', 'going', 'away', 'collage', 'Cliff', 'trying', 'build', 'private', 'room', 'Clair', 'now', 'most', 'kids', 'are', 'away', 'Theo', 'preparing', 'upcoming', 'graduation', 'somewhat', 'teenage', 'love', 'traigle', 'Rudy', 'Kenny', 'respective', 'loves', 'interests', 'new', 'collage', 'student', 'Vanessa', 'truly', 'bizzare', 'relationship', 'older', 'sufficiant', 'Dabnis', 'whom', 'Cliff', 'shining', 'abilities', 'tinker', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'season', 'most', 'part', 'episodes', 'concentrate', 'developing', 'closing', 'story', 'arcs', 'thus', 'characters', 'important', 'part', 'season', 'very', 'first', 'season', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'where', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', ""n't"", 'make', 'even', 'single', 'physical', 'appearance', 'show', 'Dennise', 'only', 'refered', 'casually', 'select', 'episodes', 'only', 'spoken', 'phone', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'voice', 'finale', 'finale', '44', 'minute', 'So', 'Commence', 'involving', 'Theo', 'collage', 'graduation', 'Olivia', 'departing', 'join', 'Dennise', 'Martin', 'Singapore', 'as', 'well', 'finding', 'out', 'becomming', 'big', 'sister', 'pretty', 'good', 'season', 'wacky', 'humor', 'individually', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'favor', 'tieing', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'shows', 'enevitable', 'conclusion', 'was', 'kind', 'sad', 'day', 'when', 'Huxtables', 'left', 'airwaves', '1992', 'personally', 'believe', 'prime', 'time', 'family', 'comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'been', 'same', 'then']",The Cosby Show: Season 8
1130029,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B00116GEES,andy8047,"[19, 22]","The Cosby Show began its eighth and final season on September 19,1991. The opening and closing montages intended for the season 7 run are finally used this season. Again,the cast is moving in rhythm to hip-hop featuring a trumpet and a snare drum. The reason for the delay of this opening's use:a mural seen in the background was not an original created by a group of artists. Bill Cosby finally received permission from the artists to use the facsimile(the group,in fact threatened NBC with a lawsuit if this was done without permission). This montage contained appearances by Lisa Bonet and Joseph C. Phillips which were deleted due to Bonet's termination and Phillips' write-out as a regular after season 7. So we see Erika Alexander in face and name this season(due to the recycling of the season 6 opener last season,only she appeared in name). So the regular cast went from eleven members(in 1990-91) to nine(this season). Gordon Cartrelle served as executive producer this season,succeeding Steve Kline(in 1990-91). Cartrelle was even a fashion designer and mentioned in the season 1 episode A SHIRT STORY. Now for the highlights:in the premiere episode,Vanessa(Tempest Bledsoe) announces her engagement to her college Lincoln University custodian Dabnis Brickney(William Thomas,recurringly). Cliff(Bill Cosby) and Clair(Phylicia Rashad) were not very delighted by the news,probably due to the fact that Vanessa was only 18 years old. It was written that Bonet's and Phillips' characters,Denise Huxtable Kendall and her lieutenant husband Martin had moved to Africa since Martin had been assigned to a naval base there. Martin's daughter Olivia(Raven Symone) was not allowed to join him and her stepmother,so she remained in Brooklyn with Cliff,Clair,Rudy(Keshia Knight Pulliam) and Clair's cousin Pam Tucker(Alexander). Martin(recurringly) visited 10 Stigwood Drive to see Olivia and everyone else when he was in the vicinity. Martin was in town when African singer Miriam Makeba(as herself in a guest appearance) visited the Huxtable household. He happened to see her perform live in Africa! This legendary series ends with Theo's(Malcolm Jamal Warner) graduation from New York University. In this syndicated two-part episode which premiered April 30,1992,Theo had a bunch of tickets to give for the ceremony. The graduates receive their diplomas by section instead of individually like middle and high school. Cliff had flashbacks of what he went through with Theo in the series premiere episode,which we see(back then,Theo had no intention of attending college). Also,Denise,unseen,announces on the phone to the Huxtable household that she and Martin are expectant parents,which means a half-sibling for Olivia. After the ceremony,Theo attends a party at the home of a fellow graduate. Cliff finally had repaired the Huxtables' ill-functioning doorbell,with a different melody now. He and Clair share one last romantic moment and ""break the fourth wall"". That means Cosby and Rashad broke character after their dance and walked by the studio audience with long,loud applause. The Cosby Show set another all-new low,finishing at #18. Although the rating wasn't too bad,Cosby decided he had enough of the sitcom and personally pulled the plug. NBC aired TCS for the very last time on September 17,1992 and on the following Thursday,he hosted the short-lived return of the game show,YOU BET YOUR LIFE on NBC. TCS's sitcom A DIFFERENT WORLD ran for one more season(in 1992-93) and Cheers got the Nielsen axe as well. The A LOOK BACK special,which NBC premiered in May 2002,would have been appropriate for this set,but instead it came with the season 1 episodes. Cosby and Rashad became a TV couple again in 1996 for the four-season run of CBS's Cosby(this should be available on DVD). Rashad even continued working in the New York theatre,frequently. Also,post-TCS,Tempest Bledsoe had a short run of her own morning talk show,THE TEMPEST BLEDSOE SHOW. Malcolm Jamal Warner,continued acting,later starring on WB's MALCOLM & EDDIE,even guest-starring on various shows such as THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR,another NBC property. MJW,is also a musician,in the studio and on the stage. KKP attended Spellman College in Atlanta. In fact,TCS season 3 finale HILLMAN was filmed at Spellman,marking her first visit. Bonet,changed her stage name and spends time with her daughter Zoe,whose father is rocker Lenny Kravitz,from whom Bonet is divorced from. Sabrina LeBeauf focused on interior decorating and did guest-star on one episode of COSBY(as did KKP). Geoffrey Owens works primarily as a theater director. RS is now a big Disney star,the star of THAT'S SO RAVEN. She's a recording artist herself,releasing THIS IS MY TIME in 2004,for one. Long live the Huxtables! And Brooklyn!",5,Farewell to a memorable piece of television history,1197590400,"12 14, 2007",2007,4778,"['Cosby', 'Show', 'began', 'eighth', 'final', 'season', 'September', '19,1991', 'opening',

1130030,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B00116GEES,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[2, 3]","The final season of the Cosby Show was a terrific season. The Cosby Show definitely went out with a bang and had a classy ending to a classy show. But it still wasn't as good as the previous seasons, and it showed in the ratings, it slipped down to eighteen and the writers and cast thought this was a good time to end the show. There were a few final changes, Theo is preparing to graduate, Lisa Bonet (Denise) has left the show for a final time, Vanessa is in love with a much older man named Dabnis Brickey, much to the dislike of Cliff and Clair, and Rudy is in love with a kid from the community center named Stanley. Meanwhile, through all these life changes Cliff is just trying to build a room for Clair. After finishing season eight I was entirely satisfied with the ending, it truly is one of the best finale's there can be. But this DVD is unfortunately disappointing, there could have been a lot of bonus material for the final season but Urban Works decided to keep it like the previous seasons, we only get the episodes, but that's reason enough to buy this set. Each episode has episode descriptions on the DVD episode menu but I'll still list them below just in case you're interested.With This Ring? - Airdate: 9/19/1991 - 18 year old Vanessa reveals that she is engaged to a 29 year old head maintenance man of her University... and has been for six months.There's No Place Like This Home - Airdate: 9/26/1991 - Cliff announces plans to add a new room to the house for Clair... and only Clair.

""Cosby"" as Hilton Lucas and Bill has also done several movies since, but for me he'll always be remembered as Heathcliff Huxtable, and to own the complete series on DVD is just fantastic, if you found this show to be special go out and buy the DVD's and have a good time.",4,The Cosby Show Season Eight,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,5948,"['final', 'season', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'was', 'terrific',

Just as many changes with just as many laughs as the previous three seasons.  Who would ever have guessed at the beginning of the series that Theo would get anywhere close to earning his bachelor's degree?  Or that litle Rudy would go through the usual trials and tribulations of a typical American teenager?  And, what about Vanessa's of-again-on-again engagement to an older guy that finds her annoying?  And, watching all of them is as funny as ever.We don't actually see Denise Kendall on camera throughout this season, as she and Martin are now living in Singapore (Theo and Olivia plan to visit them at the show's close).  And, who ends up moving into the house in their place?  Sondra, Elvin - Winnie and Nelson.  Who else could bring Dr. Huxtable first to put a playpen over their heads, then to point a dust buster at his own skull?  (I ask you, folks!)But, nothing in the world, funny, dramatic, surrealistic, whatever can match the last scene when Cliff finally repairs the doorbell (malfunctioning throughout that season), grabs hold of Clair and literally dances her out into the audience and through the studio exit.  Dancing to the showtune, ""If I Were a Bell...""One of the details of the series finale,""And So, We Commence"" is a flashback to the series pilot, when Theo has gotten a report card full of D's and tries to pass it off as a result of not being brilliant like Cliff & Clair.  This detail gives this reviewer a certain attitude about the series on the whole.  It really wasn't as much about Dr. Huxtable or the family on the whole.  It was about Theo and his struggles to harness his true intellectual potential.  [Certainly, he had the greatest character arc and was the focus of both the first and last episodes.]  I wonder if Malcolm realizes this.",5,If I Were a Bell . . .,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,1871,"['So', 'last', 'season', 'worth', 'hurrah', 'principal', 'cast', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Just', 'many', 'changes', 'just', 'many', 'laughs', 'previous', 'three', 'seasons', 'Who', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'guessed', 'beginning', 'series', 'Theo', 'would', 'get', 'anywhere', 'close', 'earning', 'bachelor', 'degree', 'litle', 'Rudy', 'would', 'go', 'usual', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'typical', 'American', 'teenager', 'what', 'Vanessa', 'of-again-on-again', 'engagement', 'older', 'guy', 'annoying', 'watching', 'as', 'funny', 'ever.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'Denise', 'Kendall', 'camera', 'season', 'Martin', 'are', 'now', 'living', 'Singapore', 'Theo', 'Olivia', 'plan', 'visit', 'show', 'close', 'who', 'up', 'moving', 'house', 'place', 'Sondra', 'Elvin', 'Winnie', 'Nelson', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'bring', 'Dr.', 'Huxtable', 'first', 'put', 'playpen', 'heads', 'then', 'point', 'dust', 'buster', 'own', 'skull', 'ask', 'folks', 'nothing', 'world', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'surrealistic', 'can', 'match', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'Cliff', 'finally', 'doorbell', 'malfunctioning', 'season', 'grabs', 'hold', 'Clair', 'literally', 'out', 'audience', 'studio', 'exit', 'Dancing', 'showtune', 'Were', 'Bell', 'One', 'details', 'series', 'finale', 'So', 'Commence', 'flashback', 'series', 'pilot', 'when', 'Theo', 'gotten', 'report', 'card', 'full', 'D', 'tries', 'pass', 'off', 'result', 'not', 'being', 'brilliant', 'Cliff', 'Clair', 'detail', 'reviewer', 'certain', 'attitude', 'series', 'whole', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'Dr.', 'Huxtable', 'family', 'whole', 'was', 'Theo', 'struggles', 'harness', 'true', 'intellectual', 'potential', '[', 'Certainly', 'had', 'greatest', 'character', 'arc', 'was', 'focus', 'first', 'last', 'episodes', ']', 'wonder', 'Malcolm']",The Cosby Show: Season 8

We want the Fatherhood cartoon and Little Bill to be released on DVD. Both were great shows!We own seasons 1-6 and we just purchased seasons seven and eight as we want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and funny! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.We read a review saying how this show used to be on Netflix and was for some reason taking off of Netflix, don't know why... But it is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and The Cosby Show saved the day! We started season one and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like the Cosby show so it is in demand!While shopping on Amazon we selected the used copy we wanted and while still shopping someone else purchased the copy we had in our cart so we lost that copy and had to select another copy that cost more. I guess that goes to show how great this show is, everyone is grabbing copies of it.(demand for this show is good)(which is good, because this should show producers that people really want to watch).Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find a used copy for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show! This show could even go for parental education!Happy viewing! And if you are looking for more funny shows, don't for get The PJ's with Eddie Murphy, Martin, My wife and Kids, Jamie Foxx, and What's happening! Great shows, real T.V.Shipping was as expected and we are in the process of viewing all the DVD's so we can see how they play!thanks.",5,Get Your Laugh on with clean T.V. show! Love It!

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[4, 6]","This season was a pretty good season to me, even though I was disappointed that Pam went without a boyfriend and we stopped seeing her on the quirky episodes with Sly, but I got two new couples to look at. Rudy with Stanley (played by the late Merlin Santana) and Kenny with Deidre. Those four were amusing, specifically the ongoing beef between Kenny and Stanley, and my favorite episodes were ""Particles in Motion"" and ""Some Gifts Aren't Deductible."" The looks Stanley would give Kenny would crack me up more than the dialogue; Santana was dead-on with his acting.I was also excited to see Special Ed on ""WARNING: A Double-Lit Candle Can Cause a Meltdown"" and really interested in Theo as a teacher. I enjoyed the group of kids Theo mentored as well as Cliff's ""For Men Only"" when talking about the ""lost generation."" Not too many shows talked about the stereotypes that brothas were getting at that age as deadbeat dads, the job issues, and talent.Cons: I outgrew the look-how-cute-the-kids-are episodes quickly and fast-forwarded through those. After Rudy became a preteen, I just wanted to see the grown-ups, so I wasn't really interested in Olivia and the twins. Olivia was a recyled version of Rudy, so most of Olivia's episodes seemed like deja vu (ex. both of them wanted dogs [although Rudy got hers], both had best friends who were boys [runaway Peter and Bud for Rudy], both of them irritated the next oldest person, both did the grown-up woman singing performance), and I was content with leaving Rudy as the baby, plus I think I wanted Claire and Cliff to have the house to themselves too so the writers would have them doing new stuff. And somehow, Vanessa and Sandra were kinda boring as they got older.This season was a little weird for me. I liked it, but I wasn't in love with the show the way I was in a few previous seasons. If not for Rudy's relationship with Stanley, I might've just went directly to ""A Different World"" when I was younger.
