The characters are developed well, I feel as if I know each one of them personally.  New characters have been introduced, and the storyline changes, not always revolving around the main character.  The 'background' of England going through changes after the war adds to the story, it shows the growth of socialized medicine in England, the good and the bad.  If you like mystery and surprises, this is not for you--it is not very 'deep'.  I do not sit on the edge waiting for the next episode, and for me, in this series it is just what I want--simple stories, mostly 'feel good', but always feeling real.

The series is created & written by Heidi Thomas, which is based on the memoirs (Call the Midwife, Shadows of the Workhouse, and Farewell to the Eastside) by the late Jennifer Worth.Call the Midwife is set in the poverty-stricken East London in the 1950's, where Jenny Lee (played by Jessica Raine), works at the Nonnatus House, a convent that serves as a hospital for the poor. Along side her are her fellow nurses Trixie, Cynthia, Chummy, and the Sisters, Julienne, Evangelina, Bernadette and Monica Joan, who are all midwifes, but attend to other medical situations that occur around the poor neighborhoods.Season two brings many more challenges to the midwives as each patient comes with their own problems which eventually become the midwives' problems. Nurse Chummy and her husband PC Noakes head off to Africa for missionary work, but they later return with life changing news. Sister Monica Joan's age is quickly catching up with her. Sister Bernadette has a health crisis as she struggles with her feelings for Dr. Turner. Jenny's best-friend, Jimmy, is getting married, which stirs past feelings for her.Disc One:Christmas SpecialEpisode OneEpisode TwoDisc Two:Episode ThreeEpisode FourEpisode FiveDisc Three:Episode SixEpisode SevenEpisode EightSpecial Feature:Midwifery Adaptation & DetailI loved watching the first season last year on DVD and I eagerly watched the Christmas Special on PBS back in December, but I missed out on watching the eight episodes of season two, mostly due to a family emergency. I was looking forward to watching the Call the Midwife: Season Two DVD, which I received free of charge from BBC Home Entertainment in exchange for my honest review.I never would have thought a television show about midwives would be interesting to me, but just like season one, I was hooked from the very first episode, which each one plays out more like a mini-movie. The cast is excellent, all giving wonderful performances; even the guest-stars are great. Heidi Thomas has creatively brought Jennifer Worth's memoirs to life.

Action comes out of the Nonnatus House, but births take place in the dwellings of the pregnant women, or worse. Less than hospitable for a newborn, but whatever it takes, the nurses are up to the task.Romance tickles the non-nun nurses adding a sub-plot, as do other medical conditions, and community situations. Episodes have multiple story threads at the same time, like contemporary novels. Viewers quickly learn personalities of regulars. Sometimes events are heartbreaking, sometimes heart warming. Sadness to LOL joy. Births and sometimes death. A lady's 1st child to 25th, literally. Triplets? Father's optional. Secrets and rampant gossip. It's all a part of the lives of these street nurses of the late 1950s. The settings are perfection, but not always idyllic. Many births are shown, with discrete use of camera angles. Delightful fifties Rock-n-roll music accompanies the episodes in all the right places. Beginning, ending, and other narration, given by the aged voice of the primary character, Jenny, is Vanessa Redgrave. The young girl, Jenny, is played by the lovely Jessica Raine, her first large role. Done well. She carries on through the first 2 seasons.This show may give Downton Abbey a run for its historic sterling money. Ten cast members are in all (or just missing one) episodes of season 1 and 2.

Season 2 continues on with the heart rending stories about life in the poor side of London in the 1950's.  This series is based on a book by Jennifer Worth about her real life experiences in east London after the war.  The series is filled with drama, suspense with storylines that contain love and sadness mixed in together.One of the unique parts of the show is the set of young midwife nurses living with nuns at the Nonnatus House.  It is a clash of cultures and generation gaps that is comedic and entertaining.  Season 2 starts off with a culture and age clash between Trixie Franklin and one of the older nuns.  They are kept busy dealing with all of the children being born and in trying to provide the best conditions and health benefits that can be made available to the mothers and new born children.I love the role of Nurse Jenny Lee played by Jessica Raine and of Chummy Browne played by Miranda Hart.  The acting in the series is just outstanding and the storyline is rich with culture and history.  The settings and background for the show are just perfectly done.  We find it entertaining and enjoyable to watch.  It is one of our favorite series to watch on TV.Season 2 is every bit as good as Season 1 and the season kicks off with a distressing set of births in the first episode that set the stage for the rest of the season.

This beautiful dramatization of the memoirs of Jennifer Worth is one of the most spellbinding series I've ever seen on television.I'm glad to say that the second series is as wonderful as the first.  Most of the regular characters are back, starting with the heroine Jenny Lee, her fellow lay midwives Trixie, Cynthia, and Chummy, and the Anglican nuns who run Nonnatus House as a charity in the East London neighborhood of Poplar: wise Sister Julianne, practical Sister Evangelina, sweet Sister Bernadette, and of course the ethereally batty Sister Monica Joan. There are some new faces as well, most importantly Jane, a timid workhouse survivor who comes to Nonnatus House as a servant and finds love there when an overly talkative vicar becomes a chaplain.The seven episodes mostly focus on various aspects of midwifery, though one does show Jenny seconded to a large London hospital, where she discovers one of her patients is an old friend and former romantic interest. There are some heartrending stories that involve a ""ship's woman,"" a woman so desperate to end her ninth pregnancy that she seeks an illegal abortion, or a West Indian woman who has to face racial prejudice. There's love and laughter mixed in with the drama, too, and in the end we see new happiness for Chummy and Bernadette and possibly Jenny, too.  Each episode is about 70 minutes long.

I think that is the only thing that bothers me when I watch.  I'm a stickler for clothing authenticity.

1635001,A2L5GQ5753724,B00BIR130A,"Renee Chaw ""Black 'n Gold Girl's Book Spot""","[2, 2]","After the introduction to the series last year, I didn't think it could be topped, but with it's sometimes gritty, always touching stories Call the Midwife, Season Two has proven the series has staying power. It's easy to see why Call the Midwife is so popular in the States and abroad. Stories of sisterly bonds among friends and the miracle of childbirth never get old.Following the life of young midwife, Jenny Lee, this series is set barely a year following her arrival at Nonnatus House in London's East End. Judging by the title you may guess that this is a series about midwifery but it is so much more. From episode to episode, there are a variety of themes from poverty, to love to faith, family, and friendship. The stories have a nostalgic feel but each episode has themes that are relevant to this day. While there IS a lot pertaining to maternity care and nursing and the hardships that come with it, there's always an unflagging sense of hope.Each of the characters, the nurses, the nuns, and the residents of the East End; have their own special charms which are brought to life by a fine cast including veteran actors Jenny Agutter, Pam Ferris, and a personal favorite, Stephen McGann. Jessica Raine is a brilliant actress. It has been a joy to see what she brings to the role of Nurse Lee in each episode. She plays the competent, confident midwife well. She's evolved from the rather innocent and naive girl in season one. Having seen her in other brilliant roles outside of Call the Midwife (Doctor Who, etc.) she's fast becoming one of my favorite young actresses.While the series centers around Jenny Lee, my favorite character by far is Camilla Cholomondley-Browne -- also known as Chummy. She provides brilliant comic relief. Kind of uncomfortable in her own skin in the first season, it's lovely to see her come out of her shell and bloom while still keeping her ever present sense of humor. Actress Miranda Hart truly brings Chummy to life in all the best ways. For Chummy, this second series represents more than just a changes that affect her life and Constable Noakes's life but also huge changes for all at Nonnatus House. There was more than a couple romances that unfolded, one being a total shock! Since I'm such a hopeless romantic, it did my heart good to see all the love in the air.There is so much more to this series than I ever expected. It's drama, it's heartache but also about laughter and finding one's true calling. All in all, this series is unbeatable and refreshing in every way. With three additional episodes, including a Christmas special, up from last years six episode tally, this series is sure to please fans of the show and hopefully bring new fans on board. If you enjoy ""extras"", the Blu-ray and DVDs feature fun cast interviews and stories about how the series came to be and the best part -- 10 additional minutes per episode that didn't air in the US!
