I love it when the parents come and pick up the alphabet kids that fall out of the tree - they have bandages, etc., and even a ""black-eyed ""p."" That's just too funny in my book, no pun intended.  I didn't realize that three other stories were included and they're just as great.  Our particular favorite was the caterpillar and the polliwog.  It's just really cute for kids to watch and see how different animals and bugs change as they grow up.  Trashy Town was cute, seeing how Mr. Gilley picks up all the trash in the town and at the end of the day, gets to take a bath.  Rosie takes a walk is pretty cute too - all the colors are really nice.  Plus, she foils the fox that is chasing her all the time without even noticing.  This isn't a very long video but it is worth watching.  My little one didn't move throughout the whole thing.  My only complaint is that I wish they could have put all the credits at the end of the last video.  They put them after each story which makes it a little long for little ones to sit through.

I keep trying to like it because the idea of it sounds so cute. I originally bought a set with book and cassette tape.  My son likes to listen to me read the ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" rhyme but seems to find the drawings in the book uninteresting. I thought the drawings and rhyme in the book might improve with some snappy video animation and music--but the animation on this video is poor quality, cheap, and slow.  My husband calls the video, especially the music, ""odious."" So far, my 21 month old likes the first 2 cartoons on the video (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and Trashy Town) but he won't sit through the final two (I can't blame him).

We were not familiar with this story before but the lyrics and topic are marvelously catchy.""Dump it in... Smash it down... Drive around the trashy town.""Rosie's Walk is about a chicken that goes about her business in absolute ignorance of the pursuing fox and his travails.  The artwork is marvelous and reminds me of colonial stitchwork.The Caterpillar and the Polliwog and the Foolish Frog are in an older animation style, think early Sesame Street, but the stories are very good and Pete Seeger can really put out a fine toe-tapping tune.Joey Runs Away is a story about how a young kangaroo runs away to find a `room' he won't have to clean up.  All the other animals want to `rent' the pouch from Joey's mom, but of course she refuses.  Joey and mom are reunited when Joey realizes that there is no place like home and hearth, and besides his room wasn't *that* messy.Changes Changes is the wordless story of two little block people who make and remake their world each time out of the same set of blocks.  Through adversity and hardship they persevere with love and creativity to form a family.Simply a great collection of stories.

712391,A1425Y8X7PSF2L,B00006CY4Q,TG,"[3, 3]","This is one of the first DVDs we let our son watch (after only Baby Einsteins). We bought it because he loves the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom book. This disk did not disappoint, and all the stories were a big hit. Chicka Chicka is done as a musical video, with an added verse not in the book that is a great addition. The baby letters race up a coconut tree which eventually can't hold all of them (hence the 'boom boom'). The grown-up letters rush to the rescue and the little ones go home for the night, but mischievious little 'a' sneaks back out for a very cute ending.Rosie's Walk is my personal favorite. An unflappable chicken takes a walk, unaware of the unlucky fox who tries to sneak up on her. Great music and quite funny.The Caterpillar and the Pollywog is a great story, and the pollywog/frog is irristable in his enthusiasm.The Foolish Frog is a classic. Pete Seeger is a master storyteller, and the story is a lot of fun and hilarious.Joey Runs Away is very funny and sweet. Great narration!Changes was one we didn't take to right away, but after giving it a chance it is endearing and fun in it's own right.I would recommend this DVD highly to anyone with children 18 months to 4 or 5 years old. My 2 year old still asks for it on a regular basis (and we've watched it many many many many times!).
