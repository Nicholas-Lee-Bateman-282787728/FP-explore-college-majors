1328154,A24PTVSZSM8968,B0036K9CIM,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is the clean family version of the guy who gets to travel back in time and fix the past. George wants to marry his girlfriend who loves him, but she is afraid to take the plunge due to a very bad first marriage experience. A despondent George makes a wish as he goes through a yellow light. He wishes he met Jane before she was married the first time. He gets into an accident and wakes up ten years earlier. A number of typical time-travel situations ensue in which his knowledge of the future creates some funny scenes and gives him an advantage. He manages to make fast friends with Jane without telling her what happened. Without spoiling the ending, I will say it has a bit of an unusual twist and is happy. The movie is fairly well done and the characters have a decent bit of chemistry for a low-budget film. For me, the big distraction is that when George goes back to 1999 from the year 2009, he and Jane look about the same, not ten years younger. You also see a few post-1999 cars pass by on the street. I assume this is because a lack of budget didn't allow for more expensive effects and a whole caravan of pre-1999 cars. After the first few scenes in 1999, this shortfall subsides into the background and isn't a huge deal. Time travel stories always involve some suspension of disbelief and this one is no different, but the time travel aspect isn't so outlandish that it takes over the story. The focus continues to be on the relationships. Because there is a fairly lengthy pre-time-travel sequence, there isn't as much time to develop secondary storylines in the rest of the movie. Overall, this is a pretty decent television romantic comedy and it is definitely worth checking out.",3,Nice variation on a tried and true formula,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1705,"['clean', 'family', 'version', 'guy', 'who', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'fix', 'past', 'George', 'marry', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'afraid', 'take', 'plunge', 'due', 'very', 'bad', 'first', 'marriage', 'experience', 'despondent', 'George', 'wish', 'yellow', 'light', 'met', 'Jane', 'was', 'married', 'first', 'time', 'accident', 'up', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'number', 'typical', 'time-travel', 'situations', 'ensue', 'knowledge', 'future', 'funny', 'scenes', 'advantage', 'make', 'fast', 'friends', 'Jane', 'telling', 'what', 'happened', 'spoiling', 'ending', 'will', 'say', 'bit', 'unusual', 'twist', 'happy', 'movie', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'have', 'decent', 'bit', 'chemistry', 'low-budget', 'film', 'big', 'distraction', 'when', 'George', 'back', '1999', 'year', '2009', 'Jane', 'look', 'same', 'not', 'ten', 'years', 'younger', 'also', 'see', 'few', 'post-1999', 'cars', 'pass', 'street', 'assume', 'lack', 'budget', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'more', 'expensive', 'effects', 'whole', 'caravan', 'pre-1999', 'cars', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', '1999', 'shortfall', 'background', ""n't"", 'huge', 'deal', 'Time', 'travel', 'stories', 'always', 'involve', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'one', 'different', 'time', 'travel', 'aspect', ""n't"", 'so', 'outlandish', 'story', 'focus', 'be', 'relationships', 'fairly', 'lengthy', 'pre-time-travel', 'sequence', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'time', 'develop', 'secondary', 'storylines', 'rest', 'movie', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'decent', 'television', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Before You Say I Do

1328160,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0036K9CIM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 5]","Never mind that this film sidesteps the shouldering of real-life responsibility, that it instead tries to resolve a troubled relationship with a fantasy twist. 2009's BEFORE YOU SAY I DO is graced with two immensely likable romantic leads and a breezy tone and some good comic moments. The final decider for me, though, is that the premise rests on my favorite sci-fi conceit, that of time travel.George Murray is an adman. Jane Gardner writes a popular advice column. George and Jane are very much in love, and so it's no surprise that one night George breaks out the shiny rock and the proposal. What's eye-opening is Jane's response which is along the lines of ""Uhhh..."" Jane adores George, she does. But she's held hostage by her disastrous first marriage. She bears the emotional and psychological scars brought about by an unfaithful ex-husband. Jane adores George, but she runs away.George indulges one superstition. Did you know that if you make a wish while the traffic light is turning yellow, that chances are you'd get in a car accident? Driving in a frenzy to get to Jane's apartment, George suffers a fender bender and a concussion and, finally, unconciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself ten years ago, in 1999, three days before Jane gets married. But not if George can help it.You can see why it takes some time for him to accept that he'd time traveled to the past. He does all the logical things. He rushes over to Jane's apartment (only it's not Jane's apartment). He visits his advertising agency and is shocked when no one recognizes him or believes him. There's a fun sequence in which George is challenged to prove his advert creds and he reels off a series of catch phrases from upcoming classic TV campaigns (like ""Can you hear me now?"" and Budweiser's ""Whassup!?""). He walks away, having left a dubious impression. Nevertheless, the ad agency's boss thinks him an ""advertising savant"" and is anxious to hire him on. But George has more important things to do.He finally tracks Jane down in the struggling offices of the Don't Throw Away newspaper, and he manages to ingratiate himself as the latest paper delivery boy (he refers to himself as an ""overgrown circulation engineer""). He starts to work on Jane. Except Jane at this stage is committed to her dog of a fiance. She perceives George as this friendly but very odd subordinate. If Nicholas Sparks and H.G. Wells got together, they couldn't have set it up better.It's getting so that a romantic comedy featuring David Sutcliffe is a must-see for me (check out THE WISH LIST if you get the chance). Sutcliffe has got this laid back approach and comes across like a regular guy. He's got easy chemistry with his leading lady, Jennnifer Westfeldt who, by the way, is pretty dang lovable. This is one of those films in which you for one minute don't doubt there's a happy ending in store. Brad Borbridge and Lauren Holly play the respective best friends, and I don't mean to be a downer but what the hell happened to Lauren Holly's career that she's now relegated to these second banana roles?What distinguishes 1999? Off the top of my head, I couldn't tell you. Seems like the film establishes 1999 by the absence of smart cars and Hummers and a rampant social media. Whatever. I like this movie, mostly because I like the cast so much (and time travel). The ending does raise certain tricky questions for the persnickety time travel buff, to which I say, ""parallel timeline, pal, roll with it.""
