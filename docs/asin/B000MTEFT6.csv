Although supposedly modelled on Dicken's Great Expectations it really owes more to his friend Hans Christian Anderson.  It is a great story with a moral- the need to overcome the shackles that we place on ourselves through disappointment, resentment and fear in order to love.",5,A Great Modern Fairy Tale,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,317,"['NOT', 'formulaic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'supposedly', 'modelled', 'Dicken', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'really', 'more', 'friend', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Anderson', 'great', 'story', 'moral-', 'need', 'overcome', 'shackles', 'place', 'ourselves', 'disappointment', 'resentment', 'fear', 'order', 'love']",The Third Wish

I just watched this movie on Netflix though and I was beyond disappointed. I found the movie extremely strange and disjointed. It felt like the scene skipped around with no real rhyme or reason. The best part of the movie was the British lawyer she falls in love with, but for some reason I found myself not even rooting for the two of them to be together. The main idea of the movie had real potential, but it just seemed extremely poorly executed. I'm glad I watched this on Netflix, because I would have been really irked had I actually paid for this movie by itself.",1,I would pass on this one,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,731,"['am', 'total', 'sucker', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'do', 'magic', 'women', 'falling', 'love', 'men', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'polar', 'opposites', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'Netflix', 'was', 'disappointed', 'found', 'movie', 'extremely', 'strange', 'disjointed', 'felt', 'scene', 'skipped', 'real', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'British', 'lawyer', 'love', 'reason', 'found', 'not', 'even', 'rooting', 'two', 'be', 'together', 'main', 'idea', 'movie', 'had', 'real', 'potential', 'just', 'seemed', 'extremely', 'poorly', 'executed', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'Netflix', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'irked', 'had', 'actually', 'paid', 'movie']",The Third Wish
