586502,A2VMT89TCSF105,B00005JKI5,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[2, 6]","""Wild Orchid"" is an erotic movie starring Mickey Rourke and some other people. Essentially, it's a pornographic movie, another attempt to mainstream porn. Above all, it's a *failed* attempt to mainstream porn. The movie is really bad, and can almost be considered an unintentional parody of pornography. My favourite scene is when Young Woman enters car, and finds Older Woman having sex with Man. She is distressed and asks Rourke to stop them. Rourke responds, in a voice that's supposed to be erotic and passionate: ""I WANT TO, BABY. BUT I CAN'T. I JUST CAN'T"".HA HA HA HA HA.Mickey is a really bad First Lover.Later, the prudish Young Woman and Mickey (who both have sexual inhibitions of some kind) finally ""do it"". The trailer looked promising, but alas, you don't see much...Just as well. I mean, we can't mainstream porn, now can we?PS. I like orchids.

586503,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00005JKI5,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 7/07, 10/12Rate: 87/07: Having already built up my high expectations from 9  Weeks, I became highly disappointed with Wild Orchid and even much more so with Mickey Rourke. It's not his fault that the film failed, but it was rather the director's ineptitude that led to the demise of the picture. Zalman King should never work on movies ever again if he can't discern style from crap or smarten up that all sex and nothing else do not make a good film. Everything in Wild Orchid was based on zero amount of energy. The lead actresses in the picture, Carr&eacute; Otis was lifeless, and Jacqueline Bisset was totally unbearable. Neither could act so well nor expose any sexual energy required for this film. On the other hand, Mickey Rourke showed some flashes of brilliance, but his talent was wasted in Wild Orchid. Sometimes he could do it natural as he can, and other times, he looked very corny. I wish somebody would have told the director, in forms of suggestion, such as ""No...better this way"" or ""He looks like a clown."" Honestly, if the two female actresses were replaced with more polished ones with lots of sexual energy and the pointless view of parades, naked women, and lots of colors was reduced significantly, Wild Orchid would have been a sensational picture. But that's not the case. King just managed to ruin everything so easily because from start to end, it was a Wild Bore. It had no meaning, no artistry, and no feeling. Worst of all, lacking sensual energy between Mickey Rourke and Carr&eacute; Otis, I had a hell of a time trying to believe in them. Quite frankly, I couldn't. I didn't see anything in her or him or within anybody. Mickey Rourke is such a phenomenal actor, and I don't have a reason to doubt his ability. The failure of the film is largely attributed to Zalman King and the casting of the two female actresses. I don't know why Jacqueline Bisset was included since she doesn't possess the looks for James Wheeler to be interested in. Nor I could believe that he would be infatuated with Emily. I could have been easily mistaken to think Wild Orchid of soft porn kind, and it was basically the soft porn kind. When this happens, the movie ceases to make sense and directs its senses to sex only with a lot of empty passion and emotion. If and only if Wild Orchid was of 9  Weeks substance, then everything that had transpired would have been justified. Another thing I don't understand is why Mickey had to relive the same character that he played in 9  Weeks. Was it necessary for further explanation to provide closure in John? The setting is correct for usage, but everything else didn't really blend in except for Rourke. He had the perfect tan, body, and hair for Rio de Janeiro. I can almost see Kim Basinger pushing Carr&eacute; Otis off and telling her off, ""Let me show you how it is done, you stupid twit nerd."" Yeah, the writing was pitifully bad. I think very often I've been paying attention to Mickey's facial features and trying to figure out if he had heavy plastic surgery on his cheeks and elsewhere. I strongly believe that Stanley Kubrick saw Wild Orchid and learned from it in terms of what mistakes were made in the movie before he went on to direct far away a masterpiece Eyes Wide Shut. Another comparison is needed with Wild Orchid, and that is Sex, Lies, and Videotape. Zalman King thought that sex was needed to make Wild Orchid a film of interest, but he was dead wrong. It is about characterization and the aura of mysteriousness...stripping off layer by layer of the two very important characters, before climaxing to the highest point of innocence and finally to the end of sweetness. Wild Orchid had none of that. It was just raw sex, banging, and nakedness. I mean, what's the point? It's everywhere. So what? At least give a meaning of it. Sadly, the sexual content in Wild Orchid was frankly tedious. As a false sequel, Wild Orchid was in absence of sexual energy; as an arty film, Wild Orchid was a joke; and as a soft porno, Wild Orchid doesn't work on many levels.10/12: Seeing Wild Orchid again, my opinion improves. I notice more things that I did not at the first time around, and I take a different perspective on it. It is very clear that Mickey Rourke is in a different league, apart from everybody else in the cast. The way he acts, the way he moves, the way he shows his countenance, and the way he talks, what Mickey Rourke did is of the Method acting of Marlon Brando's school. Compare him with Carre Otis, there is just no way to take the girl's acting all that seriously. Mickey Rourke is perfect for the role and may have acted better than 9  Weeks. Of course, Zalman King tries hard to recapture the magic and does succeed in some ways. I think he got it pat down in Two Moon Junction the year before and Lake Consequence four years later. Basically, as most people are confused, Wild Orchid is about a woman being tested in terms of trust. If Russ Wheeler, emotionally insecure as he is, sees that she passes a series of tests, then he can open up to her more. In the end, he releases all. It sounds stupid because really it takes a lot of time for that to happen instead a matter of just few days. What's not so bad is Jacqueline Bisset's part in this love story because she isn't accepted by Wheeler since she failed the initial tests. She is too obvious and loud, and Wheeler is not interested in all of that. Anyway, I am a proponent of the concept that less is more. The ending, the sex scene is unnecessary. It should have ended right before that to put a final stamp of the movie's meaning just like how 9  Weeks. All in all, Wild Orchid is not bad at all, and I would gladly watch it again solely for Mickey Rourke's acting. I am raising the rating from `2' to `8'.",4,Mickey Rourke Blows Everybody Away.,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,5775,"['Viewed', '7/07', '10/12Rate', '87/07', 'Having', 'already', 'built', 'up', 'high',

586505,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B00005JKI5,Brett D. Cullum,"[105, 110]","WILD ORCHID was released in 1990 surrounded by controversy that the sex scenes between Carre Otis and Mickey Rourke were not faked.  They were a couple at the time, and it is possible that there is some truth to the rumor, but in the end does it matter?It's a typical Zalman King affair -- rather thin plot revolving around some business intrigue and mostly a sexual awakening of a girl from the country traveling to Rio.  The setting provides incredible material for the brilliant cinematography, and the music is sexy and moody.  A very fun role for Jacqueline Bisset, but unfortunately too little for anyone else to do other than pose and preen ... and ... well... do love scenes.  Zalman King movies are soft and sensuous, and revolve around mood and sex scenes.  Don't expect anything more than well-photgraphed love scenes, and you will be fine.To all you DVD geeks out there (like me) -- edge enhancemnet is at an all-time high here.  Colors are good, and its nice to see this movie in widescreen format.  You get both the R-rated version and the unrated versions, but this is done on sides of the disc and not by branching.  You get a 2 channel stereo mix that is not very good, but probably the original soundtrack without any remastering (pity because this one needs the extra ooomph in the sound department).

He was so sexy in the 80s that I even found him so in this movie, with a bad tan, slicked back hair and some weird clothes.  That's how hot he was! I really liked the sexual tension that built between him and Carre Otis, and the way it culminated was extremely hot (yes I would agree it was soft porn).  What bored me to death were all the dance scenes, as well as J. Bissett as Otis's boss.  I bought this PURELY to ogle MR, and I didn't get enough of that.  Plus, trust me, the plot is stupid and random and makes no sense, like other reviewers said.

586512,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00005JKI5,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","There's something that irks me about the film. First of all, I will say that I do admire the look of the film. The city of Rio de Janiero and other parts of Brazil are beautifully shot. The music is also pleasurable to listen to. Rourke and Bisset give very good performances, though there are a couple of moments where the former doesn't look like he wants to be on camera. Some of the dialogue is decent: nothing terrible, really. Wild Orchid excels with style, and it does its job well. But I couldn't really enjoy the rest of the movie. The plot is just an excuse for the love scenes to kick in. I know that a story like this doesn't really matter since the film's main purpose is to stimulate eroticism. But it would have been done nicely if the story involving Carr&eacute; Otis was given an improvement. It's a bit hard to believe that a Midwestern ""nobody"" became a lawyer at a young age. And it's not just the implausibility that bothers me. In other movies, lawyers are seen as intelligent and tough-minded. In THIS movie, Carr&eacute; Otis's character is a lawyer who literally doesn't look like she knows what she's doing. Much of it has to do with her questionable acting. It's barely believable: she looks so timid for most of the time. She certainly looks beautiful, but her acting is just plain awful.Did I like the film? Like I said, I do admire the look of the film. But unfortunately, anything that involved Otis is very bothersome. I'm sure she's a great person off-screen, but I do wish director Zalman King gave approval for a better casting choice.

Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. I don't mean to imply the movie is totally awful or the worst movie ever made. It's not. But the movie had nothing unique about it at all and lacked a certain something. The expression ""When you got it you got it"" holds true to movies and ""Wild Orchid"" didn't have it.It's not Mickey Rourke or Carre Otis fault. Their both attractive people who seemed to try hard with the material on hand. But the material just wasn't interesting. It lacked subtlety. The worst part of the film is the horrid, trite dialogue; 'I'm afraid if I touch you you'll disappear', 'If you want me, come and hold me right now'; you've *got* to be kidding me!! Zalman King should learn to quit while he's ahead (take a look at the Red Shoe Diaries, for example: the same story recycled multiple times, shamelessly using David Duchovney to draw viewers because it wouldn't attract a single one without him (or, at least none out of high school and not desperately looking for some late-night nudity...)This film is the same, it uses 9 1/2 Weeks, and Mickey Rourke, to draw viewers even though it can't stand on its own feet because it's so unoriginal and poorly written...never mind the acting (what was Bruce Greenwood *thinking*???)Wild Orchid held neither the fascinating complexities and characters of ""91/2 Weeks"" or the dreamlike imagery and compelling mystery of ""Two Moon Junction."" It was just sex. It held none of the sensuality of the above mentioned. It's too bad because there was a lot of potential there.

Hell, every movie Rourke was in he was playing the same character who got a different hot chick...They were big-screen soft core porn films. Problem is, Mickey Rourke is so good at playing these characters that the movies he's done aren't that bad. Here, Rourke plays Wheeler...Who won't really enter into the synopsis for a moment. Rourke's ex-wife Carre Otis plays Emily, a young International lawyer who recieves a job with a big firm in New York and is hastily sent to Rio De Janeiro. In Rio, with her boss Claudia (Jaqueline Bisset) away; Emily begins to come into contact with sex almost everywhere she goes. Then, she meets Wheeler. Wheeler is that odd, soft-spoken, rich, womanizer guy every guy wishes they could be. Wheeler is the guy who says stuff to women in movies that we would never be able to get away with, but onscreen it just looks so damned easy. Anyway, unlike ""9 1/2 Weeks"", Wheeler and Emily don't just begin having sex. In fact, the big sex payoff isn't until the final minutes of the movie. And let's face it, if you rent this movie...You're not renting it for the story. Truth is, the story's not even that intriguing or event good for that matter. The whole movie has a plot like a soft-core porn movie. Thing is, Otis and Rourke have enough charisma on screen to pull of a movie like this. So, even if you ignore the sex, the movie isn't that bad. I, personally, think it's better than 9 1/2 Weeks. Fact is, even if you don't give a damn about the story.

First off the scenery and the music are just beautiful and captavating. From the moment I saw Mickey Rourke and Carre Otis I was hooked. Both are uniquely interesting. Mickey Rourke is HOT, and Carre Otis is sensational and beautiful as attorney emily reed. When these two come together, for the duration of the story I desperatly wanted these two to get together and boy I was not disappointed. The atmosphere and scenery are steamy and sensual, and the main love theme is excellent I LOVE IT. And if you want to see these two in action your head is going to blow off. I have not seen a sex scene shot so superbly, sexy and beautiful in my life, with a soundtrack to complement it beautifully. And for the die hard fans who buy this YOU GET BOTH VERSIONS OF THE UN-RATED AND THE R-RATED VERSIONS OF THE FILM. The R-rated is just as mesmerising as the un-rated one, it is maybe more passionate, more kissing and holding each other which I LOVE and can't get over. I'm SO in Love with this movie and scenes from this film are mesmerising. Mickey and Carre are excellent. I'v read reviews where Carre Otis is put down, but in my opinion I don't believe a word of it. Carre Otis is the BEST. A very talented actress, a beautiful women and model. I loved Carre as Emily Reed, no one else could of played Emily as well as Carre. She has a  special quality to her that leaves you wanting more, to watch more of her.

Some of it doesn't fit, some of it doesn't make sense and some of it is just plain dumb. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I like Mickey Rourke. Even though he does look at bit beat up in this movie and kind of scary looking at first with the slicked down hair he is practically oozing sex. Carre Otis's character, Emily, seems a bit aloof and childlike. She is bombarded by scenes of people having sex in an abandoned building, watching 2 people have sex in a limo. Wheeler (Mickey Rourke) almost seems to enjoy watching Emily squirm a bit. Wheeler is sort of detached, but wanting someone he can trust. Its tough to make sense of this movie because honestly the best part is the end. Now I have the unrated version so it shows more than the R-rating (for a movie like this one - unrated or NC-17 is the way to go)-the part where Wheeler and Emily make love finally. It is very arousing to say the least. I must give it to Zalman King. He knows how far to go to where the movie gets into your mind, but yet he doesn't go for the gratuitous sex.

Despite all the eye candy, nudity, and the occasional carnal relation, one reviewer said that Wild Orchid ""...wilts, flaccid, on the stem."" LOL.Well, a great move it's not, but there is certainly no dearth of voyeuristic pleasures to be had, either. The plot is pretty thin gruel, and the characters aren't very credible, either, but it's obvious that's not the point of the movie. Set against the backdrop of carnival or mardi gras time in Rio de Janeiro, there's plenty of eye candy what with all the beautiful women running around in skimpy outfits, but there's not much else of any substance in this oddball, mildly steamy movie.As for the acting, most of it is just too affected for me, as Mickey Rourke attempts to project a persona that is both sexually aloof and decadently sophisticated at the same time, while Carre Otis, who is certainly easy to look at, seems to spend most of the movie with a look of suppressed eroticism combined with naive bewilderment on her face.Despite all the nudity and the occasional sex scene, the movie is as much about unrequited love and desire as anything else. The two main characters, played by Mickey Rourke and  Carre Otis, have intimacy issues and so spend most of their time voyeuristically watching other couples rather than getting romantically involved themselves, although in the end they finally do. So you basically have a voyeuristic movie that is about a couple of voyeurs themselves. :-)This is a little bit too much self-reflexive voyeurism for me, but there was nothing on HBO that I hadn't seen last night and so ended up watching this. I give it two and a half stars because the women certainly aren't hard to look at and the several scenes with hundreds of people dancing in brilliant mardi gras costumes are actually pretty spectacular. But if you're looking for something more substantial in the way of a decadent, steamy, romantic movie like ""Last Tango in Paris,"" this isn't it.",2,A very mixed bag,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,1992,"['movie', 'garnered', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'eye', 'candy', 'nudity', 'occasional', 'carnal', 'relation', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Wild', 'Orchid', 'wilts', 'flaccid', 'stem', 'LOL.Well', 'great', 'move', 'not', 'certainly', 'dearth', 'voyeuristic', 'pleasures', 'be', 'had', 'either', 'plot', 'pretty', 'thin', 'gruel', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'credible', 'either', 'obvious', 'not', 'point', 'movie', 'Set', 'backdrop', 'carnival', 'mardi', 'gras', 'time', 'Rio', 'Janeiro', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'what', 'beautiful', 'women', 'running', 'around', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'substance', 'oddball', 'mildly', 'steamy', 'movie.As', 'acting', 'most', 'just', 'too', 'affected', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'attempts', 'project', 'persona', 'sexually', 'aloof', 'decadently', 'sophisticated', 'same', 'time', 'Carre', 'Otis', 'who', 'certainly', 'easy', 'look', 'spend', 'most', 'movie', 'look', 'suppressed', 'eroticism', 'combined', 'naive', 'bewilderment', 'face.Despite', 'nudity', 'occasional', 'sex', 'scene', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'unrequited', 'love', 'desire', 'anything', 'else', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Carre', 'Otis', 'have', 'intimacy', 'issues', 'so', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'voyeuristically', 'watching', 'other', 'couples', 'rather', 'getting', 'romantically', 'involved', 'end', 'finally', 'do', 'So', 'basically', 'have', 'voyeuristic', 'movie', 'couple', 'voyeurs', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'self-reflexive', 'voyeurism', 'was', 'nothing', 'HBO', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'last', 'night', 'so', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'give', 'two', 'half', 'stars', 'women', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'hard', 'look', 'several', 'scenes', 'hundreds', 'people', 'dancing', 'brilliant', 'mardi', 'gras', 'costumes', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'spectacular', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'substantial', 'way', 'decadent', 'steamy', 'romantic', 'movie', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', ""n't""]",N/A

Rourke's ego is the size of Texas in this film and it does not help, in fact it hurts the film. Far to much posing and showing the haircut (this doesn't help either). All the Zalman King pictures I've seen take this same ""road"". They seem to start with a plot and then the plot quietly slips away amid steamy sex scenes and sexy music. It's almost as if the director puts in these scenes and hopes that one doesn't notice that the film plot slips away. Carre Otis is breathtakingly beautiful and in fact close-ups of her lovely face and the shots of Brazil are what I enjoy the most about the movie. If I could I would order a copy with 90% of Rourke's scenes taken OUT and replace them with scenes of Carre Otis and Jacqueline Bisset (memories of those great scenes of her in ""The Deep"").

586531,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,B00005JKI5,Zoe Paris,"[12, 13]","So, it's a little dated but this movie is still HOT! It's twisted tale of lust as a kinky rich guy (Rourke) gets a shy, sexually inhibited young lawyer (Carrie Otis) to drop her inhibitions and do things 'good' girls don't do. Otis's character is HOT and one wonders how Wheeler (Rourke) can resist her charms as he plays an emotionally unavailable guy with some serious intamacy issues. He watches in the background as he persuades her to do nasty things with another guy and lives 'through' her as she enjoys herself. Emily seems frightened of her own desires at first as she sees the sexy people of Rio being free and letting loose and having a good time and she ultimately is unable to resist her urges. Meanwhile, Jaquiline Bisset's character is and older lady obsessed with Wheeler, who is trying to throw the young and gorgeous Carrie Otis at him to see if he can resist. I didn't find this movie insulting to women or perverted, it's just a sexy film about people who enjoy sex and there is nothing wrong with this. Anyone who is seriously offended by this is probably not very comfortable with sexuality on screen in general. It's really a pretty tame movie by today's standards, though I DO beleive the Rourke/Otis love scene was not faked. Overall, I found this a sexy movie I would watch it again. The plot is not great but the visuals are awesome, the bodies are HOT and all natural (before this dreadful 'breast implant' craze took over and made all women in nude scenes look like they have grapefruits in them!) and the chemestry between the characters is awesome!
