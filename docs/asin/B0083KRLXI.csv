1545249,ARY2N4CX3AON6,B0083KRLXI,katherine mitchell,"[5, 6]","Mary Marie is a really interesting independent movie, obviously made by people who love good story telling. It is quite mysterious because you don't really know what Mary and Marie's relationship is? The filmmakers are aiming high and they mostly pull it off.The acting is really good and the film makers set up their shots well and are decent editors. Quite professionally done for a small film. It is really intriguing and dreamy the two woman flirt with a guy and bring him into their relationship/friendship and mess around with his affections. Their bond seems really strong and it it cool that their relationship remains a mystery till the end. The two actresses are really beautiful woman and it is interesting to see a movie that doesn't feel that you have to spell everything out. We all have imaginations after all.
