Those who refused to ""cooperate"" were sent to prison for contempt. No one could work unless they cooperated by naming their friends as known Communists. In 1951 one man refused to cooperate, Larry doesn't want to be an informer. How did they get his name? Guilty by association? Then David Merrill returns from France. There is a surprise party. Outside somebody writes down the license plate numbers. [Its best to park on the next block to avoid a parking problem.] Redheaded Dorothy says goodbye. Larry burns his books. David meets his sone and ex-wife Ruth. David will make a picture for Darryl Zanuck. ""Now this."" David must see a lawyer to clear his name from guilty by association. He is told what he must do to ""be reasonable"".Can someone be called to testify if they didn't do anything? [Is he naive?] They want the $50,000 advanced to David back. Is Dorothy temperamental? She has a family problem. Jerry will leave the country to avoid testifying. Bunny Baxter is scared. David is now banned from the film factory. Nobody wants him now. David has some personality flaws [pride?[. David visits New York to see old friends. Who is following David? They're after him. He returns to Los Angeles. Dorothy has dreams for her future. Is she OK? David has a job offer at Monogram Studios to direct a low-budget Western. [Does it remind you of ""High Noon""?] Television is winning the hearts and minds of America, movies have a declining box office. David is under stress!David sees an old friend, the lawyer Felix Graff. He advises David to answer questions, else he is guilty by suspicion. ""Is it worth all this?"" Bunny tells what happened to him after he cooperated. Will he turn on David? Darryl Zanuck offers him another chance is he cooperates. David goes to Washington to star in this drama. He will not name the people he visited! David does not cooperate with the committee. It is a dramatic scene. Bunny refuses to name names. The last words say the people on the Hollywood blacklist were ""vindicated"" in 1970, but they don't say what happened. Did they tack on a happy ending?Hollywood movies are a money-making machine for the investors who put up the funds. The producer is responsible for running the operation, the director for producing the story. They use paid workers like actors, writers, etc. Their personal lives are seldom a concern unless it costs money. The audience for movies declined before the war ended. Hollywood had excess employees on their payrolls. The new television entertainment industry needed talent that would work for less. Those who couldn't find work in Hollywood often went into television.The hidden agenda behind these investigations was an attack on democratic rights to make people afraid of signing a petition or organizing for political purposes (First Amendment rights). There was also an economic campaign to attack small businesses to favor corporate chains. In the 1940s most people walked to shop at local small businesses. That soon changed in just a few decades so shopping meant driving to a mall. Corporate chains sucked the profits from localities so they ended up poorer overall. You can compare your small town from the 1940s to today.",2,Hollywood History of the Blacklist,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,3299,"['1947', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Committee', 'HUAC', 'held', 'hearings', 'Communist', 'influence', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'refused', 'cooperate', 'were', 'sent', 'prison', 'contempt', 'one', 'could', 'work', 'cooperated', 'naming', 'friends', 'known', 'Communists', '1951', 'one', 'man', 'refused', 'cooperate', 'Larry', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'informer', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'name', 'Guilty', 'association', 'Then', 'David', 'Merrill', 'France', 'surprise', 'party', 'somebody', 'down', 'license', 'plate', 'numbers', '[', 'best', 'park', 'next', 'block', 'avoid', 'parking', 'problem', ']', 'Redheaded', 'Dorothy', 'goodbye', 'Larry', 'books', 'David', 'sone', 'ex-wife', 'Ruth', 'David', 'will', 'make', 'picture', 'Darryl', 'Zanuck', 'Now', 'David', 'must', 'see', 'lawyer', 'clear', 'name', 'guilty', 'association', 'told', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'be', 'reasonable', '.Can', 'someone', 'be', 'called', 'testify', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', '[', 'naive', ']', 'want', '50,000', 'advanced', 'David', 'back', 'Dorothy', 'temperamental', 'family', 'problem', 'Jerry', 'will', 'leave', 'country', 'avoid', 'testifying', 'Bunny', 'Baxter', 'scared', 'David', 'now', 'banned', 'film', 'factory', 'Nobody', 'now', 'David', 'personality', 'flaws', '[', 'pride', '[', 'David', 'New', 'York', 'see', 'old', 'friends', 'Who', 'following', 'David', ""'re"", 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Dorothy', 'dreams', 'future', 'OK', 'David', 'job', 'offer', 'Monogram', 'Studios', 'direct', 'low-budget', 'Western', '[', 'remind', 'High', 'Noon', ']', 'Television', 'winning', 'hearts', 'minds', 'America', 'movies', 'have', 'declining', 'box', 'office', 'David', 'stress', 'David', 'old', 'friend', 'lawyer', 'Felix', 'Graff', 'David', 'answer', 'questions', 'else', 'guilty', 'suspicion', 'Bunny', 'what', 'happened', 'cooperated', 'Will', 'turn', 'David', 'Darryl', 'Zanuck', 'chance', 'David', 'Washington', 'star', 'drama', 'will', 'not', 'name', 'people', 'visited', 'David', 'not', 'cooperate', 'committee', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'Bunny', 'name', 'names', 'last', 'words', 'say', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'blacklist', 'were', 'vindicated', '1970', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'happened', 'Did', 'tack', 'happy', 'ending', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'are', 'money-making', 'machine', 'investors', 'who', 'put', 'up', 'funds', 'producer', 'responsible', 'running', 'operation', 'director', 'producing', 'story', 'use', 'paid', 'workers', 'actors', 'writers', 'etc', 'personal', 'lives', 'are', 'seldom', 'concern', 'money', 'audience', 'movies', 'declined', 'war', 'ended', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'excess', 'employees', 'payrolls', 'new', 'television', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'needed', 'talent', 'would', 'work', 'less', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'went', 'television.The', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'investigations', 'was', 'attack', 'democratic', 'rights', 'make', 'people', 'signing', 'petition', 'organizing', 'political', 'purposes', 'First', 'Amendment', 'rights', 'was', 'also', 'economic', 'campaign', 'attack', 'small', 'businesses', 'favor', 'corporate', 'chains', '1940s', 'most', 'people', 'walked', 'shop', 'local', 'small', 'businesses', 'soon', 'changed', 'just', 'few', 'decades', 'so', 'shopping', 'meant', 'driving', 'mall', 'Corporate', 'chains', 'sucked', 'profits', 'localities', 'ended', 'up', 'poorer', 'overall', 'can', 'compare', 'small', 'town', '1940s', 'today']",N/A

It has received lots of negative reviews, but don't listen to them. It is the best movie I have seen about the times and it captures the essence of Hollywood during the 1950s when McCarthy and the House Un-American Committee were at the peak of power. Robert De Niro is excellent, as always, as David Merrill, a director with success, fans, and he is living his dream. Then he goes on a vacation, and when he returns, the town is different. The movie opens up with a typical Committee meeting in which David's friend Larry is spooked by the committee. Before long he is burning his books and disowning his wife as a communist. Red Fever has hit town, and David is next in line. Somebody has named him as a Communist sympathyzer, and he refuses to testify to the Committee because he is angry and doesn't want to hurt his friends. Before long he finds he cannot get a job, not directing, producing, or even working in a film repair shop. His life is turned upside down, and he decides finally to testify to the Committee. The acting is what makes this movie, De Niro, but also Annette Bening, George Wendt, Martin Scorsese is great in a cameo. My favorite part is when one cast member is called a commie by the producer for siding with David. &quot;I turned in commies without the government even asking. If you want to call me a commie, you got to back it up.&quot; David replies, &quot;If he wants to call you a commie, he doesn't need to back it up.&quot; Some people say it is contrived or unbelievable, but the transformation in David, from materialistic director to a man seeing the need to defy the McCarthyists is done well.

The movie is set in the times when the sole mention of the term &quot;communist&quot; was seen as synonymous of &quot;evil&quot;. The film is a critique to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), when it created a Hollywood blacklist, which included Hollywood celebrities considered as communists, banning their works and denying them the opportunity of getting new jobs, until they provided names of more people that &quot;attempted against the American Way Of Life&quot;.Despite the fact that a lot of people mistakenly relates the communism with the word &quot;criminal&quot;, actually the communism is another way of life of some countries, mostly Europeans. &quot;Guilty By Suspicion&quot; criticizes the paranoia that a lot of people suffered when they heard the word &quot;communism&quot;. The thing is that there were (and there are) some criminal communists, as well as there were (and there are) some criminal German, Americans, Mexicans, English, Asians, etc., in all the world there are criminals. But is ridiculous to judge a whole culture with a different way of life based on a few bad people.Perhaps &quot;Guilty By Suspicion&quot; is not the best political drama movie, but its message is clear, and also features good performances (the fantastic Robert De Niro and the attractive Annette Bening), interesting situations, and a Martin Scorsese cameo.

421850,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6304437277,Annie Van Auken,"[3, 3]","Written and directed by Irwin Winkler, GUILTY BY SUSPICION (1991) is an ""inside Hollywood"" story of a most grim nature that's inspired by actual events. It stars Robert De Niro as David Merrill, a fictitious movie director who is implicated by a friend as a member of the Communist Party.1951 is an unsettling time in Tinseltown. The so-called Hollywood Ten have been convicted as Communists or for non-cooperation and are sitting in jail. Others called before an investigating committee ""purge"" themselves to prove they're loyal Americans by symbolically throwing their friends and acquaintances into the roaring Red Scare bonfire. Merrill is just one of several in this current round of investigations who must decide to either stand on principle, say nothing and thus get blacklisted, or betray as many people as the Committee demands.It's an incredibly sad story of careers ruined and lives shattered in a country where an individual's Constitutional right to free thought apparently doesn't apply if he's a Communist Party member, or even casually attended a few Party meetings decades earlier.A superior cast includes Annette Bening, George Wendt, Patricia Wettig, Sam Wanamaker, Chris Cooper, Tom Sizemore and in a very fine performance, Martin Scorsese as an openly Communist director who flees to Europe rather than satsfy the witchhunters.

I think many of the negative reviews are from people unacquainted with the era of McCarthy and his cohorts.  I had to live through it.  My family and I were affected by the Unamerican Subcommittee procedings and their effects.  The ridiculousness lasted past the 50's.  As a senior in college I was threatened by an FBI plant who was passing as a dumb college senior.  He blew his cover and failed to show up at graduation.  When he approached me I refused to believe good old J. Edgar wpoui;s be stupid enough to employ anyone as stupid as this kid.  How could anyone who had first hand contact with the minions of that great institution have dfoubted the idiocy of Hoover?  This kid proved me wrong,  when I questioned the legitimacy of his badge he pulled an automatic pistol from his pocket and removed the clip, then handed tit to me saying, ""They don't give this to fakes.""  I have never liked being threatened.  When another FBI genius showed up at my dorm to question me about my cousin, I complained to him.  The junior g-man was pulled from school and sent back to the Washington funny farm I assume.My complaint about this film is it plays up the problems the ineffective right wing idiots like McCarthy did to other lesser humans who had nothing to do with Hollywood.  My father had a sensitive job as an elementary scvhool teacher in a backwater town in Florida.  The FBI came to his school to question him.  When he informed them he did not know anything, the brilliant G-man told him if he wanted to keep his hight profile job pushing a broom, he would cooperate like any good citizxen would or never work anywhere again.  Dad knew the power of the idiots and made some vague remarks of some intelligence.  He told the FBI he knew communists by name only and named the leading politicians of the defunct American Communist Party.There are great Americans running aound this country still who realize they can influence a great many people through fear and loud talking.  They have changed their names from the JohnBirch Society to Fox News, but they are just as dangerous.  If you want to see at least some of the harm done by blowhard politicians see this movie.

What was never asked was, &#34;when is enough enough?&#34; If the standards were low for determining witches and communists, then potentially everyone can get hanged.But there is a life lesson here--one among many. If you try and hurt a media person they will get back at you in the form of a movie or song--just read some of Taylor Swift's lyrics about ex-friend Drew to confirm this. &#34;Guilty By Suspicion&#34; falls into this category.

Nothing is mentioned about the strained relationships betwen the US and Russia, how many Americans were building bomb shelters in their back yard, how there were communists in Hollywood, how Russia threatened to bury the US, and how many by name in Hollywood did testify as friendly witnesses at the HUAC meetings. This is a lot of information to leave out. There is no context for this movie or background information, no balanced perspective, or why people like Walt Disney and Gary Cooper said what they said.While it can and should be said that what happened was not the best way to deal with suspicions like this, consider the times. Would you lock up a certain people in jail if their country had bombed or threatened to bomb and destroy the United States with Atomic Weapons? This is more likely to happen in times of national stress.Hollywood has long been an elitist group. They consider themselves to be experts on war, oil, economics, poverty, hunger, gun control, and and the environment. They don't want guns in America, but want to make exceptions for themselves, because they are famous. Its not nice to criticise Hollywood, and if anyone disagrees with the morality displayed in movies its not the fault of Hollywood, but of the common person who is not as enlightened as Hollywood is.Thus, there is an element of propaganda in this movie. Its only seen from the side of those who were blacklisted and harrassed. Its a one sided picture of the times, with no context of the times in which this happened. Its a shame that what did happen was done in a very poor fashion by the powers that be who seemed more interested in making a name for themselves than seeking genuine truth. But this is not all that happened, and it may be for the reasons of what were left out of the movie that gives it a slight stogy feel. If this film is so great, how come its never been released on blu ray?",4,Guilty of Propaganda,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,2674,"['Guilty', 'Suspicion', 'time', 'late', '1940s', 'mid', '1950s', 'when', 'was', 'Communist', 'Witch', 'Hunt', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'been', 'compared', 'Salem', 'Witch', 'Trials', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'hanged', 'flimsiest', 'evidence', 'What', 'was', 'never', 'asked', 'was', '34', 'when', 'enough', 'enough', '34', 'standards', 'were', 'low', 'determining', 'witches', 'communists', 'then', 'potentially', 'everyone', 'can', 'get', 'hanged.But', 'life', 'lesson', 'here', 'one', 'many', 'try', 'hurt', 'media', 'person', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'form', 'movie', 'song', 'just', 'read', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'lyrics', 'ex-friend', 'Drew', 'confirm', '34', 'Guilty', 'Suspicion', '34', 'category', 'not', 'just', 'times', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'treated', 'movie', 'not', 'objective', 'Nothing', 'mentioned', 'strained', 'relationships', 'betwen', 'US', 'Russia', 'how', 'many', 'Americans', 'were', 'building', 'bomb', 'shelters', 'back', 'yard', 'how', 'were', 'communists', 'Hollywood', 'how', 'Russia', 'threatened', 'bury', 'US', 'how', 'many', 'name', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'testify', 'friendly', 'witnesses', 'HUAC', 'meetings', 'lot', 'information', 'leave', 'out', 'context', 'movie', 'background', 'information', 'balanced', 'perspective', 'why', 'people', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'said', 'what', 'said.While', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'deal', 'suspicions', 'consider', 'times', 'Would', 'lock', 'up', 'certain', 'people', 'jail', 'country', 'had', 'bombed', 'threatened', 'bomb', 'destroy', 'United', 'States', 'Atomic', 'Weapons', 'more', 'likely', 'happen', 'times', 'national', 'stress.Hollywood', 'long', 'been', 'elitist', 'group', 'consider', 'be', 'experts', 'war', 'oil', 'economics', 'poverty', 'hunger', 'gun', 'control', 'environment', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'guns', 'America', 'want', 'make', 'exceptions', 'are', 'famous', 'not', 'nice', 'criticise', 'Hollywood', 'anyone', 'morality', 'displayed', 'movies', 'not', 'fault', 'Hollywood', 'common', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'as', 'enlightened', 'Hollywood', 'is.Thus', 'element', 'propaganda', 'movie', 'only', 'seen', 'side', 'who', 'were', 'blacklisted', 'harrassed', 'one', 'sided', 'picture', 'times', 'context', 'times', 'happened', 'shame', 'what', 'did', 'happen', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'poor', 'fashion', 'powers', 'be', 'who', 'seemed', 'more', 'interested', 'making', 'name', 'seeking', 'genuine', 'truth', 'not', 'happened', 'may', 'be', 'reasons', 'what', 'were', 'left', 'movie', 'slight', 'stogy', 'feel', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'how', 'come', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'blu', 'ray']",N/A

421860,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6304437277,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 10]","""Guilty by Suspicion"" is one of those ""Historical Fiction"" films that ""The Rotten Review"" just can't get out of its hair.  Historical fiction is ironic enough a term for any subject, but especially so when brought to bear against the evils of the McCarthy era.  Like much historical fiction, the ""Big Red Scare"" mixed the true and the perhaps-no-true with little regard for distinguishing the one from the other.  ""Suspicion"" so strongly enmeshes itself in the intrigue of the 50's Witch-Hunts that it's difficult to comment on the film without getting into the larger argument of their merits.  On the other hand, this is a work of fiction, with invented characters, scripted dialog and its own form of a Hollywood ending.  History being as important as ""Suspicion"" suggests - ""The Rotten Review"" wonders why it should be forced to pick for history out of its uninspired script, one that visits no new territory.The story has noble (and fictional) Hollywood director David Merrill facing off against the House committee for Un-American Affairs long after he'd been stripped of his prestige and cozy life for refusing to name fellow Hollywood communists.  Merrill we learn is no hero - he had no interest in politics, but went to some meetings during the war when it was fashionable to support any anti-fascist cause.  But he doesn't want to name names.  Soon he's forced to work pseudonymously on low-budget Westerns, until his true name is revealed.  (His only defender, it turns out, is a Gary Cooper-like actor; even a similarly blacklisted friend played by Scorcese turns against him).  To add insult to industry, less-noble friends turn against him and name him as a communist (including a writer that Merrill had earlier refused to name to the committee).  Merrill decline works like a sort of trajectory - inevitably bringing him before the committee where scripted heroism will allow him to take an oral potshot at Hollywood-style politicians.The other question this flick raises (that is, after the whole history and fiction issue) is this - why was this movie made?  McCarthyism has been done to death - Woody Allen tackled this about 20 years ago with ""The Front"", a black-comedy also ending with the heroic showdown with HUAC.  ""Suspicion"" seems to understand how new it's not - the script is so light on the details, it likely presumes that we already know the important stuff (good guys from bad politicians; the movie doesn't take chances by casting any popular actors in unpopular parts like those of the anti-communist inquisitors; like the communists of that era - the Witch Hunters have become ""The Other"", the faceless embodiment of anti-patriotic evil).  Also, the watching this flick, it's easy to forget that the Red-Scare wasn't focused exclusively or even originally on Hollywood at all - early targets were the armed forces and the State Department.  (For Merrill's denouement, the script appropriates the famous rejoinder by Army AG Joe Welch to Joe McCarthy.)But worst of all, ""Suspicion"" is boring.  The story, though following well-worn trails against right-wing agitprop, never seems to be going in any direction, and reinforces nothing other than a sentiment I had before seeing this movie: Hollywood can't be trusted to document its own lamentable moments in history.",2,History...Hollywood style,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,3301,"['Guilty', 'Suspicion', 'one', 'Historical', 'Fiction', 'films', 'Rotten', 'Review', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'hair', 'Historical', 'fiction', 'ironic', 'enough', 'term', 'subject', 'especially', 'so', 'when', 'brought', 'bear', 'evils', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'much', 'historical', 'fiction', 'Big', 'Red', 'Scare', 'mixed', 'true', 'perhaps-no-true', 'little', 'regard', 'distinguishing', 'one', 'other', 'Suspicion', 'so', 'strongly', 'intrigue', '50', 'Witch-Hunts', 'difficult', 'comment', 'film', 'getting', 'larger', 'argument', 'merits', 'other', 'hand', 'work', 'fiction', 'invented', 'characters', 'scripted', 'dialog', 'own', 'form', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'History', 'being', 'as', 'important', 'Suspicion', 'Rotten', 'Review', 'wonders', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'forced', 'pick', 'history', 'uninspired', 'script', 'one', 'new', 'territory.The', 'story', 'noble', 'fictional', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'David', 'Merrill', 'facing', 'off', 'House', 'committee', 'Un-American', 'Affairs', 'long', ""'d"", 'been', 'stripped', 'prestige', 'cozy', 'life', 'refusing', 'name', 'fellow', 'Hollywood', 'communists', 'Merrill', 'learn', 'hero', 'had', 'interest', 'politics', 'went', 'meetings', 'war', 'when', 'was', 'fashionable', 'support', 'anti-fascist', 'cause', ""n't"", 'want', 'name', 'names', 'Soon', 'forced', 'work', 'pseudonymously', 'low-budget', 'Westerns', 'true', 'name', 'revealed', 'only', 'defender', 'out', 'Gary', 'Cooper-like', 'actor', 'even', 'similarly', 'blacklisted', 'friend', 'played', 'Scorcese', 'turns', 'add', 'insult', 'industry', 'less-noble', 'friends', 'turn', 'name', 'communist', 'including', 'writer', 'Merrill', 'had', 'earlier', 'refused', 'name', 'committee', 'Merrill', 'decline', 'sort', 'trajectory', 'inevitably', 'bringing', 'committee', 'where', 'scripted', 'heroism', 'will', 'allow', 'take', 'oral', 'potshot', 'Hollywood-style', 'politicians.The', 'other', 'question', 'flick', 'whole', 'history', 'fiction', 'issue', 'why', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'McCarthyism', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'tackled', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Front', 'black-comedy', 'also', 'ending', 'heroic', 'showdown', 'HUAC', 'Suspicion', 'understand', 'how', 'new', 'not', 'script', 'so', 'light', 'details', 'likely', 'already', 'know', 'important', 'stuff', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'politicians', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'chances', 'casting', 'popular', 'actors', 'unpopular', 'parts', 'anti-communist', 'inquisitors', 'communists', 'era', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'have', 'become', 'Other', 'faceless', 'embodiment', 'anti-patriotic', 'evil', 'Also', 'watching', 'flick', 'easy', 'forget', 'Red-Scare', 'was', ""n't"", 'focused', 'exclusively', 'even', 'originally', 'Hollywood', 'early', 'targets', 'were', 'armed', 'forces', 'State', 'Department', 'Merrill', 'denouement', 'script', 'famous', 'rejoinder', 'Army', 'AG', 'Joe', 'Welch', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'worst', 'Suspicion', 'boring', 'story', 'following', 'well-worn', 'trails', 'right-wing', 'agitprop', 'never', 'be', 'going', 'direction', 'reinforces', 'nothing', 'other', 'sentiment', 'had', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'trusted', 'document', 'own', 'lamentable', 'moments', 'history']",N/A

It would have been a much better movie if De Niro's character was a human being and not a preternatural being of infinite virtue and courage. He, with a steely gaze, destroys his own and his estranged wife's lives with his unyielding principles. St Thomas More would have to acknowedge that compared to the Robert Merrill character, he was a moral coward.HUAC is now an historical fact with the judgement of history revealing it as an hysterical reaction to a mythical threat.
