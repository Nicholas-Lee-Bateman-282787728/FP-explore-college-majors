1655229,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00DCRE590,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","What initially drew me to this film was its cast of whom I always enjoy, then its title.  With this film, directed by Maggie Greenwald, I first suspended a little disbelief, although I found that I actually did like this movie.  It is a magically different slice of life story about a young woman, Rhea Carver (Zosia Mamet), who begins a new journey in life with Oliver Sands (Sam Underwood).  He is besotted with her from the very beginning and she's immediately embarrassed in school over the situation.  This quickly changes for the couple. They fall in love with each other to her father, John Carver's (Aidan Quinn) happiness and her mother, Abigail's (Virginia Madsen), dismay about this new young man. Will he understand her? And what it is that makes her so unique?The family is a tight little unit coming from some extremely antiquated ways.  Being descendants from the generation of the witches which were basically put to death centuries before and presently these women are The Last Keepers of their beliefs.  Except for being very respectful of the earth and nature in all forms, and with their interesting rituals, they are not really that different. The family leads a beautifully colorful life and own the town's art gallery.  The film was intriguing to look at (Wolfgang Held) with its vibrantly hued visuals of single red berries, paintings, leaves during a brightly red, gold, and orange autumn season along with their homemade artwork.  The family's matriarch is Rosemarie Carver (Olympia Dukakis) in a happy and informative grandmother's portrayal.  She also takes the role of putting some sense into her brood.  Abby (or Abigail) doesn't want Rhea to go too far into this world today, she sees the faulted place it is and celebrates the ""energy"" these women are gifted with.  Each woman possesses a different gift and her grandmother offers her granddaughter so much guidance, love, acceptance and told her, ""You are not in nature, you are nature"".  While Abby can be very strict and wary of worldly things, Rosemarie and John are much more accepting especially because Rhea wants to go to college to study art.Halloween night soon comes and Rhea invites Oliver for the evening, their night is like any other dinner night until Abby has a terrifying vision and discovers that the neighborhood thugs have branded her family witches, destroying their yard and other personal cruelties.  Rhea being deeply affected and duly horribly shocked begins acting out.  She is very tired of being different, and will not talk with Oliver any longer as she believes he may have been at the cause of it.  When does a rebellion come for a girl her age wanting to explore other venues?  There always comes a time when a person needs to find themselves, no matter how difficult that may be.  Will Rhea accept her inherited place in life or make a change from the control of her mother and her giftedness?  Or can Rhea find a middle ground with the two?  The prophecy and these gifts are getting very old for Rhea who is still young and  just a girl wanting to go to college to the tune of, 'No' - from her mother.This movie is an easy, colorful, and engaging movie to watch when you feel like just viewing something uncomplicated and not having a dilemma or problem to solve within it.  Like I mentioned before, I didn't think I would like this, but it did surprise me, and I viewed this charmingly watchable cast twice noticing more the second time.  I found the music following nicely with the happenings. The clothing was especially distinctive and unique.  ""The Last Keepers"" does say much about the love of family, and with this idiosyncratic group, I'd say it's a keeper.",4,"""The Crazy Thing Is That You Took Trash And Made It Beautiful"" - Oliver",1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,3682,"['What', 'initially', 'drew', 'film', 'was', 'cast', 'whom', 'always', 'enjoy', 'then', 'title', 'film', 'directed', 'Maggie', 'Greenwald', 'first', 'suspended', 'little', 'disbelief', 'found', 'actually', 'did', 'movie', 'magically', 'different', 'slice', 'life', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'Rhea', 'Carver', 'Zosia', 'Mamet', 'who', 'new', 'journey', 'life', 'Oliver', 'Sands', 'Sam', 'Underwood', 'besotted', 'very', 'beginning', 'immediately', 'embarrassed', 'school', 'situation', 'quickly', 'couple', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'father', 'John', 'Carver', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'happiness', 'mother', 'Abigail', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'new', 'young', 'man', 'Will', 'understand', 'what', 'so', 'unique', 'family', 'tight', 'little', 'unit', 'coming', 'extremely', 'antiquated', 'ways', 'Being', 'descendants', 'generation', 'witches', 'were', 'basically', 'put', 'death', 'centuries', 'presently', 'women', 'are', 'Last', 'Keepers', 'beliefs', 'being', 'very', 'respectful', 'earth', 'nature', 'forms', 'interesting', 'rituals', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'different', 'family', 'beautifully', 'colorful', 'life', 'own', 'town', 'art', 'gallery', 'film', 'was', 'intriguing', 'look', 'Wolfgang', 'Held', 'vibrantly', 'hued', 'visuals', 'single', 'red', 'berries', 'paintings', 'brightly', 'red', 'gold', 'orange', 'autumn', 'season', 'homemade', 'artwork', 'family', 'matriarch', 'Rosemarie', 'Carver', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'happy', 'informative', 'grandmother', 'portrayal', 'also', 'role', 'putting', 'sense', 'brood', 'Abby', 'Abigail', ""n't"", 'want', 'Rhea', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'world', 'today', 'faulted', 'place', 'energy', 'women', 'are', 'gifted', 'woman', 'different', 'gift', 'grandmother', 'granddaughter', 'so', 'much', 'guidance', 'love', 'acceptance', 'told', 'are', 'not', 'nature', 'are', 'nature', 'Abby', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'strict', 'wary', 'worldly', 'things', 'Rosemarie', 'John', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'accepting', 'especially', 'Rhea', 'go', 'college', 'study', 'art.Halloween', 'night', 'soon', 'Rhea', 'Oliver', 'evening', 'night', 'other', 'dinner', 'night', 'Abby', 'terrifying', 'vision', 'discovers', 'neighborhood', 'thugs', 'have', 'branded', 'family', 'witches', 'destroying', 'yard', 'other', 'personal', 'cruelties', 'Rhea', 'being', 'deeply', 'affected', 'duly', 'horribly', 'shocked', 'begins', 'acting', 'out', 'very', 'tired', 'being', 'different', 'will', 'not', 'talk', 'Oliver', 'longer', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cause', 'When', 'rebellion', 'come', 'girl', 'age', 'wanting', 'explore', 'other', 'venues', 'always', 'time', 'when', 'person', 'find', 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'may', 'be', 'Will', 'Rhea', 'inherited', 'place', 'life', 'make', 'change', 'control', 'mother', 'giftedness', 'can', 'Rhea', 'find', 'middle', 'ground', 'two', 'prophecy', 'gifts', 'are', 'getting', 'very', 'old', 'Rhea', 'who', 'still', 'young', 'just', 'girl', 'wanting', 'go', 'college', 'tune', ""'No"", 'mother.This', 'movie', 'easy', 'colorful', 'engaging', 'movie', 'watch', 'when', 'feel', 'just', 'viewing', 'something', 'uncomplicated', 'not', 'having', 'dilemma', 'problem', 'solve', 'mentioned', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'like', 'did', 'surprise', 'viewed', 'charmingly', 'watchable', 'cast', 'twice', 'noticing', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'found', 'music', 'following', 'nicely', 'happenings', 'clothing', 'was', 'especially', 'distinctive', 'unique', 'Last', 'Keepers', 'say', 'much', 'love', 'family', 'idiosyncratic', 'group', ""'d"", 'say', 'keeper']",The Last Keepers
