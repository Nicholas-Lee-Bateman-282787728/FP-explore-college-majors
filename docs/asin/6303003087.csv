So far this family moves into a big house blowing all their lifes savings only to to move in and start having strange things happen around the house at night like flushing toilets, TV turning on by itself, shadows of a man walking through thier house, a old balck man apearing telling to not dig up thier yard because this couple is burried there then is gone when you look away and look back, just plain strange evil stuff.  The insurance company won't help, and all the nieghbors are suffering from the same goings-on so what do you think happens?  Yup, the Mom gets mad and  goes nuts and starts diggin them dead folks up!  As for any idea how the movie ends I don't know cause it's still on.  My hope is it ends good.

You'd be surprised what people are willing to do when it involves money. This show is very good and is a typical good scary film that addresses a real life issue. It's not really gross and was a good movie to watch on Mothers day.This kind of thing does not just happen in the area this is filmed but a lot of places. At 'Turkey Creek' in Mississippi they kept a few graves labeled but there now is an apartment building and other things on top of what used to be an African American cemetery. They detail it in the documentary film 'Come Hell or High Water: The Battle for Turkey Creek' which I also recommend highly and it has a part in the film where they talk about burrying over a grave yard.

Entertainment at best, disappointing waste of time at worse.As for reviewing this movie, it was somewhat entertaining and ""dated"" it indeed was.

Grave Secrets is based on a true event where the spirits of those buried come to haunt the houses on Hilltop Drive whose owners don't realize there is a cemetery under their houses. Patty plays a wife and mother who takes charge of her granddaughter while her daughter is away. right after moving in, Patty hears the sound of a toilet flushing, only there is no one there to flush it. Later, her granddaughter sees shadows on the wall no one else sees. As in any haunted-house movie, things build up until the climax and the secret of Hilltop Drive is revealed. While other movies were better, such as The Haunting and The Legend of Hell House, it is neverthless unnerving in part because this one is real, and in part because of the acting and special effects. I have it on a video along with Ghost Story, Poltergeist, The Haunted (not The Haunting, but based on fact) and The Uninvited (also based on fact). You can see I like haunted-house movies, and Grave Secrets is a satisfying end to the tape.

350253,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6303003087,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I love these 80s made-for-tv supernatural dramas, and ""Grave Secrets"" was an interesting watch, primarily because of the strong lead performances by Patty Duke and David Selby. Both actors play a middle-aged couple, Jean and Shag Williams, who pour their life savings into a new home situated in a new housing development. Their granddaughter (from their oldest daughter) and their younger daughter who is engaged to be married live with them. As soon as the family moves into their new home, strange events begin to plague the family - the daughter gets stricken by a rare type of cancer, the young granddaughter sees shadows moving around the house, Jean keeps hearing the bathroom toilet being flushed when no one else is around, and even Shag sees something bizarre.Initially, Shag refuses to buy into Jean's theory that the house may be haunted. But as Jean digs deeper, she makes some eerie discoveries. The neighbor across the street has his yard dug up and makes a gruesome discovery in the form of a pair of skeletal remains, and later Jean finds out that her home together with the homes of some of her neighbors were built on land that used to be known as the Black Hole Addition, and was the burial ground for hundreds of former slaves dating back to the Civil War era. As the hauntings become more malevolent in nature, Jean and Shag are desperate to move their family out, but with their financial resources stretched thin, they have limited options.The acting by Patty Duke and David Selby makes this an engrossing watch, and given that it is based on true life haunting accounts by residents of the real Black Hope area, it made it an even creepier viewing experience. There are some credible moments of suspense and reminded me of the more classic and atmospheric horror movies I've watched in the past. The movie also reminded me of the film Poltergeist, but a little more low-key, without the expensive special effects. If you enjoy suspenseful supernatural dramas and are tolerant of the 80s feel of this movie, then this might be worth your time.",4,Engrossing supernatural drama,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,2067,"['love', '80s', 'made-for-tv', 'supernatural', 'dramas', 'Grave', 'Secrets', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'primarily', 'strong', 'lead', 'performances', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'David', 'Selby', 'actors', 'play', 'middle-aged', 'couple', 'Jean', 'Shag', 'Williams', 'who', 'pour', 'life', 'savings', 'new', 'home', 'situated', 'new', 'housing', 'development', 'granddaughter', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'younger', 'daughter', 'who', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'live', 'As', 'soon', 'family', 'new', 'home', 'strange', 'events', 'begin', 'plague', 'family', 'daughter', 'stricken', 'rare', 'type', 'cancer', 'young', 'granddaughter', 'sees', 'shadows', 'moving', 'house', 'Jean', 'hearing', 'bathroom', 'toilet', 'being', 'flushed', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'even', 'Shag', 'something', 'bizarre.Initially', 'Shag', 'buy', 'Jean', 'theory', 'house', 'may', 'be', 'haunted', 'Jean', 'digs', 'deeper', 'eerie', 'discoveries', 'neighbor', 'street', 'yard', 'dug', 'up', 'gruesome', 'discovery', 'form', 'pair', 'skeletal', 'remains', 'later', 'Jean', 'out', 'home', 'together', 'homes', 'neighbors', 'were', 'built', 'land', 'used', 'be', 'known', 'Black', 'Hole', 'Addition', 'was', 'burial', 'ground', 'hundreds', 'former', 'slaves', 'dating', 'back', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'hauntings', 'become', 'more', 'malevolent', 'nature', 'Jean', 'Shag', 'are', 'desperate', 'move', 'family', 'financial', 'resources', 'stretched', 'thin', 'have', 'limited', 'acting', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'David', 'Selby', 'engrossing', 'watch', 'given', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'haunting', 'accounts', 'residents', 'real', 'Black', 'Hope', 'area', 'made', 'even', 'creepier', 'viewing', 'experience', 'are', 'credible', 'moments', 'suspense', 'reminded', 'more', 'classic', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'past', 'movie', 'also', 'reminded', 'film', 'Poltergeist', 'little', 'more', 'low-key', 'expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'enjoy', 'suspenseful', 'supernatural', 'dramas', 'are', 'tolerant', '80s', 'feel', 'movie', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'time']",N/A
