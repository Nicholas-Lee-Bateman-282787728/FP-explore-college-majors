If food and other provisions are not there for them, the Indians will take what they want.""Sitting Bull and 3000 Sioux crossed into Canada's Northwest territories to get help from the Blackfeet. Army General Alfred Terry, the man who sicked Custer on the Sioux, went after Sitting Bull to get him to return.

He fought to preserve their land, their way of life, their culture, but by 1890 saw everything he fought to preserve disappear.""By 1890, the cowboy saw everything he fought to preserve disappear, like open country where he could ride his pony as far as his pony could go in any direction.

1537051,A1Z2MZ9DV1K74T,B007RKFXQW,Lawrence Rapchak,"[19, 19]","DON'T BE DISCOURAGED, guys---""Westward the Women"" is as intense and harrowing as any film from Hollywood's Golden Age, and is so well written, directed and photographed, that you feel as if you are a part of this rugged, dangerous journey, especially after the brutal, unyielding (and very reluctant) Robert Taylor ends up driving off the men who have signed on to guard the wagon train, leaving the women alone with him to face the elements, the terrain, AND the maruading Indian tribes.But these are no ordinary, stereotypical Hollywood women, and I predict that anyone who appreciates great film-making will find themslves entirely engrossed in their story....a story, incidentally, written by none other than FRANK CAPRA. So you can be sure that the HUMANITY quotient is very high indeed in this intimate yet epic drama.My only reservation is the obligatory romantic subplot between Robert Taylor and Denise Darcel, which occasionally distracts from the main story. And, yes, the comic relief scenes with Ito, the Japanese cook, do get a bit tiresome. But the vast majority of the film is a powerful testament to the courage and endurance of 19th-Century American women, with actress Hope Emerson---against all expectations--practically STEALING THE SHOW as the emotional ""fortress"" and Mother Earth figure of the intrepid band.Other than the lovely opening and closing musical theme (sung by a female chorus which still, in 1951, maintains that classic ""heavenly"" sound from Hollywood's Golden Age), there is NO MUSIC in the film, until the action specifically requires it in the final scene----and what a scene it is.  I swear....when that little dance orchestra goes into ""Drink To Me Only With Thine Eyes"", I have to fight back the tears, every time. I wish that we would see a bit more of these wonderful ladies that we have to come to love and admire during this final scene (and a little LESS of the star romantic couple) but, again, it's a minor quibble.A first-rate film experience, now (finally) available on DVD.LR",5,"If this is what's meant by a ""Chick Flick"", COUNT ME IN!!",1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2029,"['DO', ""N'T"", 'BE', 'DISCOURAGED', 'guys', 'Women', 'intense', 'harrowing', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'photographed', 'feel', 'are', 'part', 'rugged', 'dangerous', 'journey', 'especially', 'brutal', 'unyielding', 'very', 'reluctant', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'up', 'driving', 'off', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'signed', 'guard', 'wagon', 'train', 'leaving', 'women', 'alone', 'face', 'elements', 'terrain', 'maruading', 'Indian', 'tribes.But', 'are', 'ordinary', 'stereotypical', 'Hollywood', 'women', 'predict', 'anyone', 'who', 'great', 'film-making', 'will', 'find', 'themslves', 'entirely', 'engrossed', 'story', '.a', 'story', 'incidentally', 'written', 'none', 'other', 'FRANK', 'CAPRA', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'HUMANITY', 'quotient', 'very', 'high', 'indeed', 'intimate', 'yet', 'epic', 'drama.My', 'only', 'reservation', 'obligatory', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'Denise', 'Darcel', 'occasionally', 'main', 'story', 'yes', 'comic', 'relief', 'scenes', 'Ito', 'Japanese', 'cook', 'do', 'get', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'vast', 'majority', 'film', 'powerful', 'testament', 'courage', 'endurance', '19th-Century', 'American', 'women', 'actress', 'Hope', 'Emerson', '-against', 'expectations', 'practically', 'STEALING', 'THE', 'SHOW', 'emotional', 'fortress', 'Mother', 'Earth', 'figure', 'intrepid', 'band.Other', 'lovely', 'opening', 'closing', 'musical', 'theme', 'sung', 'female', 'chorus', 'still', '1951', 'classic', 'heavenly', 'sound', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'MUSIC', 'film', 'action', 'specifically', 'final', 'scene', 'what', 'scene', 'swear', 'little', 'dance', 'orchestra', 'Drink', 'Me', 'Only', 'Thine', 'Eyes', 'have', 'fight', 'back', 'tears', 'time', 'wish', 'would', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'wonderful', 'ladies', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'admire', 'final', 'scene', 'little', 'LESS', 'star', 'romantic', 'couple', 'again', 'minor', 'quibble.A', 'first-rate', 'film', 'experience', 'now', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD.LR']",N/A

1537055,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B007RKFXQW,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This 1951 black and white film is a good, solid western, one of the few which tell the story of one of less known but absolutely crucial aspects of the conquest of the Far West - how wives were brought to the mostly male pioniers... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.This film takes place in 1851 and begins in a California valley owned mostly by a cattle baron named Roy Whitman (John McIntire), a very wealthy and powerful man, who is not young anymore and as old age closes on him, aspires to leave behind something more than just a ranch and a fortune.  He wants his men to settle arounde his estate so the little valley town grows and prospers - but there is no women in this place or anywhere nearby... So he decides to invite 138 marriageable women from Chicago to travel west in order to marry his men.Roy Whitman decides to make the travel himself and to assist him hires a skeptical, tough and unpleasant trail boss named Buck Wyatt (Robert Taylor). Women in Chicago can have a look at the pictures of the prospective mates and those who are interested, can pick a picture and sign - but only after listening to the warning, that those 2000 miles travels through merciless wilderness, roamed by hostile Indians, usually see the loss of 20% of women... Only ""good"" women are admitted - prostitutes and other saloon dancers are rejected. And then the film really begins...This is a good film, showing surprisingly well for a 1951 movie, how HARD and DANGEROUS were those travels to the west. Accidents involving unstable wagons and unruly animals (horses, mules and oxen) were the most frequent cause of death and injury, but there were also diseases, poisonous snakes, bear attacks, poisoning by foul water and food, Indian or outlaws attacks and also internal strife, as some of those ladies came with quite a history and could (and WOULD!) use gun or knife quite well - and with all the hardships tempers were getting shorter and shorter... And then of course there was always the possibility that some escorting guards, some of which were quite unsavory characters, decide to offer themselves a kind of ""prime in kind""...Even if Robert Taylor is the greatest star in this film, in fact he very deliberately accepted a smaller part of the time screen than one could expect - in fact this film focuses much more on women themselves. Even more surprisingly, it is not the drop dead gorgeous Fifi Danon (played by French actress Denise Darcel) who is the most important amongst them, but rather the much older Patience Hawley, played by definitely less attractive veteran actress Hope Emerson. In fact the film shows a remarkable gallery of women portraits!There are many impressive scenes in this film, but none is better that the aftermath of Indian's attack, when the names of the fallen are cried out loud - that is something that I NEVER saw in any other western and the power of this scene is immense!The one thing which I found really out of place is Ito (Henry Nakamura), the Japanese (!) cook who travels with the convoy. Now, granted, Ito is a great character and adds a lot to this film - but for love of God, in 1851 Japan was still a country CLOSED to the world and NO Japanese subject was EVER allowed to emigrate or even travel abroad, under pain of DEATH - and there were NO exceptions. So how did this guy found his way to America!? But OK, this is a detail - and to help me swallow this little detail, I convinced myself that maybe he simply hid on one of few Dutch ships allowed every year to trade with Japan...I liked this film A LOT and I will absolutely keep my DVD.

Finding a good husband was as difficult then as it is today but for different reasons. Everyone should be familiar with mail order brides that was necessitated out of an over population of women due to wars where the male population was decimated. If women wanted a good man for a husband, they had to be willing risk their lives to sail from the East Coast to the West Coast or as in this movie take a wagon train to a remote area in the untamed West where men had no female companionship whatsoever at the start of this movie. Either method of travel was filled with life threatening dangers in the 19th century. Most of the women who signed up for this hazardous journey were from the East Coast or immigrants from Europe and use to the civilities or genteelness of the developed East Coast or European comforts.The challenge for these ""soft"" women passengers was that they had to gut tough quick or find themselves dying or dead from hostile Indians wanting to take their scalps, rattlesnakes, lack of water in a hot dessert and flash floods all lethal elements in a hostile environment. The story stars Robert Taylor a rugged Wagon Master whose job was to get as many of the women in his charge back to the remote settlement in the rugged wilderness of the West. This band of sisters all rookies had to learn and do things quickly that an experienced pioneer woman would find challenging. The women fought all these hostile elements valiantly but a few were killed by Indians.Robert Taylor finally makes it back to the eagerly waiting men. Since the women made the sacrifice of the hazardous journey risking their lives, they got to choose their husbands from the collective group of men. A Parson was nearby and they all got on line to get hitched. Robert Taylor found himself heading to get on the end of that line with a hate/love relationship that ended in love.  Great movie, great action and romance at the end of the trail which is now Home Sweet Home for Westward the Women. Don't miss it.Hope this helps.  Blessings.

These women had it rough, and the movie convincingly portrays what it was like to go by wagon train for months at a time facing everything from floods, to Indians, to lack of water and snakes just to name a few, all for the opportunity to marry a stranger.  They start off with a group of men to help them on the trip, but when things get out of hand and trail boss Robert Taylor (one of the old handsome Hollywood actors of days gone by) makes it clear the women are off limits, the majority of the men leave so things get even tougher for these women.  There is humor, action, fights and friendships among the women and by the time they finally get there, you're as anxious as they are to see the men they've traveled all that way to meet.
