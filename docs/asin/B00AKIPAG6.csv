1612817,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00AKIPAG6,Doug Park,"[9, 12]","{3.5 stars}Semi-Spoiler: As you may already be aware, this is a Christian film based partly on the life and work of ""Papa Joe"" Bradford, a former convict who founded a special program for ""at risk"" children in Nashville, Tennessee. While there is a definite religious agenda here, it is not too preachy and avoids promoting any specific church or creed.The main reason why I give this as high a rating as I do is that the story of Samantha Crawford's search for her husband's murderer is quite riveting in places; there are some truly suspenseful and surprising moments here. Most of the acting is quite good, as is the cinematography, which shows some really captivating shots of storm clouds, waterfalls, and the like, as well as realistic filming of inner-city Nashville.Still, the plot is all over the place, and the stories of Samantha and her childhood friend Joe do not intertwine quite as well as they could. The pervasive schmaltzy soundtrack is distracting and seems a bit too intent on telling us how to feel about this and that. This entire film would have worked so much better if there had been more focus on simply relating the stories without trying to manipulate the audience's moods and perceptions. While, to its credit, the central Christian message keeps itself out of the film until toward the end, UNCONDITIONAL always seems to be on the verge of making some heavy-handed moral. The time-frame is also unclear; e.g., Bradford goes to prison for computer hacking, where they still play phonograph records (?)While the film tries to be grittily realistic in places, the final effect is  sugar-coated, i.e., ""We can show bloody murder, inner-city life in the 'projects,' and prison brawls, but _please_, no f-bombs, sexual references, or any of that type of stuff!!"" The dialogue is probably the most problematical element here. The creators were obviously trying to avoid an ""R"" rating, but this could have been better accomplished by simply having less (or at least less audible) dialogue in the rougher spots.Such is also the case with the ludicrously fake prison-yard fight scene. In the Special Features, one of the directors states that the actual fight that occurred during Joe Bradford's incarceration was ""much more brutal than we could show on film."" That being the case, it would have been more effective to just show the whole thing summarily and/or hazily, allowing the audience to tell what's going on without having to see it in graphic detail.All the same, UNCONDITIONAL has many fine moments. The children (and theme of childhood in general) are particularly great in every respect.",4,"Though ""Unconditional"" Is Unconvincing in Many Ways, I Still Found It Worth Watching",1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,2619,"['3.5', 'stars', 'Semi-Spoiler', 'may', 'already', 'be', 'aware', 'Christian', 'film', 'based', 'partly', 'life', 'work', 'Papa', 'Joe', 'Bradford', 'former', 'convict', 'who', 'founded', 'special', 'program', 'risk', 'children', 'Nashville', 'Tennessee', 'definite', 'religious', 'agenda', 'here', 'not', 'too', 'preachy', 'avoids', 'promoting', 'specific', 'church', 'creed.The', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'give', 'as', 'high', 'rating', 'do', 'story', 'Samantha', 'Crawford', 'search', 'husband', 'murderer', 'quite', 'riveting', 'places', 'are', 'truly', 'suspenseful', 'surprising', 'moments', 'here', 'Most', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'cinematography', 'really', 'captivating', 'shots', 'storm', 'clouds', 'waterfalls', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'realistic', 'filming', 'inner-city', 'Nashville.Still', 'plot', 'place', 'stories', 'Samantha', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Joe', 'do', 'not', 'intertwine', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'pervasive', 'schmaltzy', 'soundtrack', 'distracting', 'bit', 'too', 'intent', 'telling', 'how', 'feel', 'entire', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'focus', 'simply', 'relating', 'stories', 'trying', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'moods', 'perceptions', 'credit', 'central', 'Christian', 'message', 'film', 'end', 'UNCONDITIONAL', 'always', 'be', 'verge', 'making', 'heavy-handed', 'moral', 'time-frame', 'also', 'unclear', 'Bradford', 'prison', 'computer', 'hacking', 'where', 'still', 'play', 'phonograph', 'records', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'grittily', 'realistic', 'places', 'final', 'effect', 'sugar-coated', 'i.e.', 'can', 'show', 'bloody', 'murder', 'inner-city', 'life', ""'projects"", 'prison', 'brawls', '_please_', 'f-bombs', 'sexual', 'references', 'type', 'stuff', 'dialogue', 'probably', 'most', 'problematical', 'element', 'here', 'creators', 'were', 'obviously', 'trying', 'avoid', 'R', 'rating', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'accomplished', 'simply', 'having', 'less', 'least', 'less', 'audible', 'dialogue', 'rougher', 'spots.Such', 'also', 'case', 'ludicrously', 'fake', 'prison-yard', 'fight', 'scene', 'Special', 'Features', 'one', 'directors', 'actual', 'fight', 'occurred', 'Joe', 'Bradford', 'incarceration', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'brutal', 'could', 'show', 'film', 'being', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'just', 'show', 'whole', 'thing', 'summarily', 'hazily', 'allowing', 'audience', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'having', 'see', 'graphic', 'detail.All', 'same', 'UNCONDITIONAL', 'many', 'fine', 'moments', 'children', 'theme', 'childhood', 'general', 'are', 'particularly', 'great', 'respect']",Unconditional

1612832,A1VOPP2OFITP7D,B00AKIPAG6,June Bug,"[2, 3]","its most important point is lost due to the fact it is critical to be politically correct?  Or at least that is how it appeared to me.There are certain stories told in music, books and movies that touch you deeply.  This story is one of those instances.  Samantha ""Sam"" Crawford is a mess, still grieving from the loss of her husband, who was murdered by an unknown assailant in the projects.  She returns to the place where it happens and witnesses a young girl being hit by a speeding car and left for dead.  She takes her to the hospital and while awaiting an update sees Joe Bradford, a close childhood friend, who comes to get the girl.Sam visits the neighborhood to follow-up on the girl's recovery and ends up reconnecting with Joe.  He tells her of his life since they lost contact, which included a stint in prison and his life changing experience.  Now disabled because of kidney failure, he has become the adoptive father to the neighborhood children, few of whom have a father.  Through the witness of Joe's commitment to the children and his encouragement, she realizes she must forgive the murderer and move forward.  Sam believes she has located the murderer.  However, as she struggles with taking the law into her own hands, the situation rapidly shifts.  I don't want to spoil the ending, so I will state that this story is told to create tension and suspense but things aren't always as they seem.  There are more subplots in the story than what I am summarizing.The great downfall is the telling of Joe's experience in understanding God's love while doing time in solitary confinement.  The movie doesn't develop this experience in any depth though it is critical to the storyline.  Nor do we even have a certainty that his experience is with the Judeo-Christian God, since I guess the producers and/or director wanted to be Politically Correct.  All we know observe while he talks to Sam about serving in solitary confinement, is him sitting on his bed and he appears to be meditating? praying? next, we see a bright light shining in the room, he states as we view the ""light"" that his view of life has changed. I guess those who would be ""offended"" by this part of the story would jeopardize the ability to get theaters to carry it or the number of tickets sold.What a loss, since both Sam and Joe have powerful personal experiences with significant loss and wounds that result.  Their childhood stories were insightful and emotionally packed as the bond they shared allowed them both to grow further as adults and share a level of trust to encourage each to grow beyond their pain.  I cried because they realized that the power of love (agape) based on choice (which reflects God's love based on acceptance and not on behavior/works) and not on emotion/reactive feelings, which often drives our behavior.  Actions including forgiveness is a choice not a feeling.  Sam and Joe's reactions are incredible messages about choice as it relates forgiveness and life purpose that anyone could relate to in their own life.  Both are amazing people because of their response to their pain.Thus, in my opinion, the potential impact this could have made was watered down.  Don't let that stop you from watching the movie, however, be prepared to know that this isn't a movie, you would give to a person, who doesn't understand God's perfect, unconditional love.",3,"Clean Movie with Terrific Message, however,",1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,3373,"['most', 'important', 'point', 'lost', 'due', 'fact', 'critical', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'least', 'how', 'appeared', 'me.There', 'are', 'certain', 'stories', 'told', 'music', 'books', 'movies', 'touch', 'deeply', 'story', 'one', 'instances', 'Samantha', 'Sam', 'Crawford', 'mess', 'still', 'grieving', 'loss', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'unknown', 'assailant', 'projects', 'place', 'where', 'young', 'girl', 'being', 'hit', 'speeding', 'car', 'left', 'dead', 'hospital', 'awaiting', 'update', 'sees', 'Joe', 'Bradford', 'close', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'get', 'girl.Sam', 'neighborhood', 'follow-up', 'girl', 'recovery', 'up', 'reconnecting', 'Joe', 'life', 'lost', 'contact', 'included', 'stint', 'prison', 'life', 'changing', 'experience', 'Now', 'disabled', 'kidney', 'failure', 'become', 'adoptive', 'father', 'neighborhood', 'children', 'few', 'whom', 'have', 'father', 'witness', 'Joe', 'commitment', 'children', 'encouragement', 'must', 'forgive', 'murderer', 'move', 'forward', 'Sam', 'located', 'murderer', 'However', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'situation', 'rapidly', 'shifts', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'ending', 'will', 'state', 'story', 'told', 'create', 'tension', 'suspense', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'seem', 'are', 'more', 'subplots', 'story', 'what', 'am', 'summarizing.The', 'great', 'downfall', 'telling', 'Joe', 'experience', 'understanding', 'God', 'love', 'doing', 'time', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'movie', ""n't"", 'develop', 'experience', 'depth', 'critical', 'storyline', 'do', 'even', 'have', 'certainty', 'experience', 'Judeo-Christian', 'God', 'guess', 'producers', 'and/or', 'director', 'wanted', 'be', 'Politically', 'Correct', 'know', 'observe', 'Sam', 'serving', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'sitting', 'bed', 'be', 'meditating', 'praying', 'next', 'see', 'bright', 'light', 'shining', 'room', 'view', 'light', 'view', 'life', 'changed', 'guess', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'offended', 'part', 'story', 'would', 'jeopardize', 'ability', 'get', 'theaters', 'carry', 'number', 'tickets', 'sold.What', 'loss', 'Sam', 'Joe', 'have', 'powerful', 'personal', 'experiences', 'significant', 'loss', 'result', 'childhood', 'stories', 'were', 'insightful', 'emotionally', 'packed', 'bond', 'shared', 'allowed', 'grow', 'further', 'adults', 'share', 'level', 'trust', 'encourage', 'grow', 'pain', 'cried', 'realized', 'power', 'love', 'agape', 'based', 'choice', 'God', 'love', 'based', 'acceptance', 'not', 'behavior/works', 'not', 'emotion/reactive', 'feelings', 'often', 'behavior', 'Actions', 'including', 'forgiveness', 'choice', 'not', 'feeling', 'Sam', 'Joe', 'reactions', 'are', 'incredible', 'messages', 'about', 'choice', 'forgiveness', 'life', 'purpose', 'anyone', 'could', 'relate', 'own', 'life', 'are', 'amazing', 'people', 'response', 'pain.Thus', 'opinion', 'potential', 'impact', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'was', 'watered', 'down', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'watching', 'movie', 'however', 'be', 'prepared', 'know', ""n't"", 'movie', 'would', 'give', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'God', 'perfect', 'unconditional', 'love']",Unconditional

1612839,A36A7UXWAPM4JU,B00AKIPAG6,MariekevZ,"[1, 3]","Someone who gave this movie just 2 stars wrote:'The movie is designed to give you a warm and fuzzy feeling.' Well, actually that happened too, but my overal feelings were quite different because of the way the filmmakers made it possible to relate to Sam, who lost her husband to murder and was left with the maddening questions 'why?' 'who?' and 'how now?' I cried some of my own pain out over this broken world. I guess I needed a good cry. And don't you start making fun of my pain, cause you know nothing about it.Since it is based on a true story, I guess the 'candy coat' that writer saw in it, was earned through many hardships. That doesn't make them any lighter. But at least someone had the guts and power to at least try to overcome the bitterness, that is so often the only result.So no, I do not agree with that review. But do wish that 'old cynic', as he called himself, could cry out his own pain better.My review? This movie touched me somewhere deep, deep down and brought some of the issues up, that caused me to struggle in life. And through my tears I could also grasp some of that hope and faith. There are not many films that can do that! So I am deeply impressed with this piece of art. And thank the makers for allowing us a glimpse in their hearts. If you can't grasp that, I'm truly sorry for you. Luckily most people can, if you're reading the grades they give this film.By the way: I'm glad I didn't watch this with others, because now it could do its work in me. And I don't think it is suitable for kids under twelve for A) they probably cannot grasp this film, so they'll might think it boring and B) if they can grasp it, that probably has something to do with their own traumatic experiences and might in this age cause more pain. But smart kids will have left the room by then.To everyone over twelve: just relate to one of the characters and sort things out for yourselves. Turning pain into gain isn't cheap. It is a worthy cause, that needs more everyday-heroes. Maybe you are to be one of them too?Something weird happened while commenting on the review of that other guy. He didn't appreciate it much. He wrote me back that Sam's husband hat trusted God, and still he died. And how very sad that indeed is, I reminded him of Sam's husband's last words, that he would be walking on the clouds! Such hope lives inside of us. And so I encouraged this review-writer to make heaven his destiny too. Jesus paid for the sins of mankind on that cross. His answer was that I belonged in hell!!!!!Then he removed his review so that I could not reply on that anymore. So for the small chance he is still checking me out, here follows the comment I made on that, but could never post:""Hi, wanted to reply on your comment and saw you changed the number of stars from 2 to 1. You really make me laugh. Thank you.You wrote to me that I belong in hell. Yes, you are very right. So do you. So does all mankind.The question is: do you want to go?I don't. And guess what: I know a way out. Sam's husband knew it too. And I guess you know exactly what I mean. Yours for the taking...I would really love to see you there. In heaven I mean. Cause I'm definetely not going to hell. Thanks to... You know WHOM. I made 'reservations' when I was just 17 years old and hopelessly distressed with the way the world is nowadays. So loveless, don't you agree? Hell is supposed to be even worse. Sadly you do not even have to make reservations to go there. It's all prepared for us.You really want to go there? It's not meant for you, but for the fallen angels who deceive mankind, lying about God and His great love for us.God will really bless you, cause I'm praying for you. And know what, even if you do not believe me, I like you. You fight for the cause. I would pick another cause, but that doesn't change that I really appreciate your dedication. Have you ever heard about a guy named Saul? He didn't like them stupid Christians or their God either. But then he met Jesus. Boy, did that change something.

1612849,A18TSDA9ZRLKVM,B00AKIPAG6,"Robert S. ""geek hipster""","[11, 11]","I think this film is a very good example of it's genre.  I don't care for most faith-based films because too often I think they emphasize the spiritual over the material and the characters, they don't let you really get inside them first and understand their strengths and weaknesses so that their journey becomes yours.  That, or they explain God's love rather than showing an example of human love that informs us of the greater power of God's love. Put another way, I think when you start preaching to the audience in a film, it kicks the audience out of the film, rather than involving the audience so thoroughly with the characters and situations they forget they're being reminded of something basic about kindness.What did I like about this film?  Michael Ealy's performance.  He's outstanding.  I have a strong bias in favor of Lynn Collins  so I can't report accurately on her performance.  She's good with what she has to work with, though I think her character is a little hamstrung by the narrative of her wanting to track down the man who murdered her husband. It's not badly done, but the hot or hysterical emotions that come with pulling a gun don't seem to 'fit' with her character... maybe I'm reading too much into it. I would've liked a scene where she expressed to Joe her anger at her incomprehensible loss. That aside? The payoff of her journey to me was worthwhile, and I was so engrossed with it that the spiritual punchline caught me off guard, like I mentioned earlier.I liked that the film emphasized the importance of community outreach, of the need for good father figures, of the tragic loss of the same. That it related finding God's love in the worst circumstances.  I liked that the child actors in the film had some depth to their characters, particularly the boy named Macon, he pulled a terrific surprise tear-jerker moment that knocked me out.I liked it. It was simple, emotionally affecting and had an honest message about helping the poor.
