908174,A1FH14TQSVDH1X,B0009ML2JC,Anthony Sanchez,"[10, 12]","Island in the Sky is less a John Wayne film per se as it is a cavalcade of male character actors.  Andy Devine seems to have as much air time as does the Duke, and James Arness plays a happy-go-lucky sort of fellow that is far from his Gunsmoke character.  Lloyd Nolan also impresses and brings to mind how Nolan once turned down the title role of Stagecoach, which went to John Wayne and launched his career as an A-list actor.The film was made in 1953 and in black & white.  Given the scenery, I would have preferred the filming had been in color.  They could have made good use of the topography to illustrate the mixture of beauty and loneliness that Wayne's stranded party must have felt.  Much of the action, though, was in the studio and limited to closed shots of airplane cockpits.  Therefore, the film makers may have felt the B&W; film better characterized the somber mood of the rescuers.The film interspersed drama with comedy, mostly by Andy Devine and the reactions to him by his crew.  I would have rated the film higher, but was very annoyed by the producer's use of a narrator through out the movie.  I can't imagine what they were thinking.  The narration even went to the point of telling the viewer that Wayne felt bad disciplining his crew member, like the look on Wayne's face was not enough to express this emotion.Wayne, though, was most memorable to me because of 1) his taking less of a chunk of screen time in favor of the several other actors (this shows a good amount of confidence that is not often present with some actors), and 2) his moments in the movie when he expresses self-doubt and fear (it could be a trivia question for Wayne fans to name other roles of his showing similar vulnerability).

908175,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0009ML2JC,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","You know, John Wayne made quite a few movies that were not westerns. This is one of the best.Wayne plays Dooley, an experienced pilot who flies transport planes as a civilian for the military in World War II. His plane is on a mission into Canada when the plane starts icing up really bad. The wings are coated with ice, and as chunks break off, it renders the plane unstable for a moment, throwing them off course. As the propellers' ice breaks off, they fling it at the hull, sounding rather like gunshot. Also, the ice on the windshield ruins visibility, and the extra weight of the ice brings them down.So there they are, on a big stretch of snow, but where the heck are they? Due to problems with the radio, they have not been able to figure it. And the last message they were able to send was picked up and relayed by a radio station. Back at the base the commander figures this apparently puts them in the middle of a large stretch of the map that is literally unexplored. (Remember, this is before satellite photos and global positioning and all that high tech stuff.) The sky is not clear enough for them to plot their position by either the sun or the stars, but nonetheless some half a dozen planes take off looking for Dooley and his crew.Part of what makes this movie so grand is that many of the pilots are actors we can recognize. Wayne, of course, and Andy Devine, Lloyd Nolan, James Arness, Harry Carey, Jr., and most amusingly, the kid who played Alfalfa in the ""Our Gang"" comedies whose name escapes me.The story follows both the crew of the down plane and the searchers, but the audience does not know anything one or the other groups don't know. The most heartbreaking scene is when one of the crew, Frank, goes out with a rifle with the idea of bagging some food, and gets disoriented. He ends up following his own tracks in a circle, and as he lays down ""to rest,"" he remembers his wife at the carnival, riding the merry-go-round. Of course, he freezes to death. As the camera pans away from his frozen body, it turns out he was actually very close to the tail of the airplane. In the blizzard, he could not see what was probably less than 100 feet in front of him.When the downed crew has almost given up, and has run out of food, they hear a plane. No, three planes! Here they come! We are saved! There they go! They didn't even see us!As frustrating as this is for them, it causes a further dilemma when the search planes get back to base. Could they have missed the survivors? Should they search in the same area, or go somewhere else? They decide to go somewhere else, but apparently not so far that they cannot hear the hand-cranked emergency radio transmitter the survivors are working, and they tell the searchers to return to where they had been the day before.Interestingly, the last scene is where they drop supplies for the survivors. The movie does not follow up on their actual return home. Somehow, it would have been anti-climatic.",4,John Wayne in the Frozen North,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2970,"['know', 'John', 'Wayne', 'made', 'quite', 'few', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'westerns', 'one', 'best.Wayne', 'Dooley', 'experienced', 'pilot', 'who', 'transport', 'planes', 'civilian', 'military', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'plane', 'mission', 'Canada', 'when', 'plane', 'icing', 'up', 'really', 'bad', 'wings', 'are', 'coated', 'ice', 'chunks', 'break', 'off', 'plane', 'unstable', 'moment', 'throwing', 'off', 'course', 'propellers', 'ice', 'breaks', 'off', 'fling', 'hull', 'sounding', 'rather', 'gunshot', 'Also', 'ice', 'windshield', 'visibility', 'extra', 'weight', 'ice', 'down.So', 'are', 'big', 'stretch', 'snow', 'where', 'heck', 'are', 'Due', 'problems', 'radio', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'figure', 'last', 'message', 'were', 'able', 'send', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'relayed', 'radio', 'station', 'base', 'commander', 'apparently', 'middle', 'large', 'stretch', 'map', 'literally', 'unexplored', 'Remember', 'satellite', 'photos', 'global', 'positioning', 'high', 'tech', 'stuff', 'sky', 'not', 'clear', 'enough', 'plot', 'position', 'sun', 'stars', 'nonetheless', 'half', 'dozen', 'planes', 'take', 'off', 'looking', 'Dooley', 'crew.Part', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'grand', 'many', 'pilots', 'are', 'can', 'recognize', 'Wayne', 'course', 'Andy', 'Devine', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'James', 'Arness', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'most', 'amusingly', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'Alfalfa', 'Gang', 'comedies', 'name', 'me.The', 'story', 'crew', 'down', 'plane', 'searchers', 'audience', 'not', 'know', 'anything', 'one', 'other', 'groups', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'when', 'one', 'crew', 'Frank', 'out', 'rifle', 'idea', 'bagging', 'food', 'disoriented', 'up', 'following', 'own', 'tracks', 'circle', 'down', 'rest', 'wife', 'carnival', 'riding', 'merry-go-round', 'course', 'death', 'camera', 'away', 'frozen', 'body', 'out', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'close', 'tail', 'airplane', 'blizzard', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'less', '100', 'feet', 'front', 'him.When', 'downed', 'crew', 'almost', 'given', 'up', 'run', 'food', 'hear', 'plane', 'No', 'three', 'planes', 'Here', 'come', 'are', 'saved', 'go', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'As', 'frustrating', 'further', 'dilemma', 'when', 'search', 'get', 'back', 'base', 'Could', 'have', 'missed', 'survivors', 'Should', 'search', 'same', 'area', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else', 'decide', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else', 'apparently', 'not', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'hand-cranked', 'emergency', 'radio', 'transmitter', 'survivors', 'are', 'working', 'tell', 'searchers', 'return', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'day', 'before.Interestingly', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'drop', 'supplies', 'survivors', 'movie', 'not', 'follow', 'up', 'actual', 'return', 'home', 'Somehow', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'anti-climatic']",N/A

908179,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B0009ML2JC,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 1]","There's a rugged sense of authenticity throughout the 1953 adventure film ""Island in the Sky"" as World War II vets fly through brutal terrain. During an ice storm, a crew guiding a hulking C-47 is forced to crash land in uncharted Canadian wilderness. Trapped by the elements, they must survive sub-zero weather and pray for help. It's a simple set-up aided by the dependable presence of John Wayne as a no-nonsense pilot holding his grounded team together. It's clear the film was made by men who notched more than a few hours of flight time, and the efforts of a clique of fearless pilots attempting to find the lost crew are fascinating scenes of suspense.""Island in the Sky"" was one of a handful of Wayne films held out of circulation for decades and re-released to video with fanfare in 2005. While it's not a great film, it was piloted by a storied crew of legends. Foremost is Wayne, the gregarious workaholic lug who to this day is one of the most beloved actors in history. It's always a joy to run across his lessor-known films and see him out of his element, and sometimes they are surprisingly good (Trouble Along the Way). ""Island in the Sky"" has multiple, head-scratching elements severely dating it, most notably the surreal narration explaining the obvious. Director William Wellman voiced the dialogue, and there are times you wish you could throw a brick at him. There's not a single scene where narration was necessary, and it dilutes the drama. But that doesn't stop Mr. Wellman, who ponderously recites endless paragraphs as if reciting Shakespeare.Wellman was approaching the end of a long career perhaps best known for his colorful personality, an adventure-loving World War I flyboy in his youth. He famously landed an airplane near Douglas Fairbanks' home and insisted on a job in the movies. And so he was hired, working his way through the ranks with uncommon drink and tempestuous determination. In spite of himself, he forged more than a few classics (Wings,The Public Enemy,The Ox-Bow Incident). He was undoubtedly a fan of Ernest K. Gann, a scrappy author (The Aviator,FATE IS THE HUNTER) whose bookISLAND IN THE SKY (Bantam Air and Space)this film was based upon. Gann and Wellman were cut from the same cloth these two, and one can imagine these adventurers' arguments while hammering out the screenplay on a Corona Typewriter. Wellman recites dogged dialogue straight from the novel, itself based on a true story. He also injects multiple flashback sequences as ridiculous as that disco scene fromAirplane!. This opus is corny even by 1953 standards.Now for the good. Wellman and Wayne recruited one of the great supporting casts to portray the fearless flyboys risking their lives to find the missing crew. James Arness, Lloyd Nolan, Paul Fix, Harry Carey, Jr., Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer and the wonderful Andy Devine are equal parts hilarious and eccentric as they brave storms in their desperate quest. Devine, usually providing dramatic relief in a John Ford western, steals the film as the cool, no-nonsense pilot who treats the treacherous rescue as another day at the office. His character's quirks are so unique they must be based on fact, though I could have done without the shot of him in swim trunks. I appreciated the impressive on-location filming at Donner Lake, of all places. There's also a brilliant scene when the pilots gather around a map after a long, unsuccessful day. A prolonged silence reveals the harsh reality of their predicament. If they choose the wrong search area, their friends are going to die.Wayne, Wellman and Gann would team again a year later withThe High and the Mighty, another airline drama involving a pilot's attempt to muscle a crippled plane across the Pacific. A precursor to theAirport Terminal Pack (Airport/Airport '75/Airport '77/Airport '79 - The Concord)disaster films of the 1970s, it suffers from similar issues of endless narration, goofy flashbacks and mile-high corn. While fascinating time capsules, these Wellman/Wayne films are too turgid to be considered classics. Where ""Island in the Sky"" succeeds is its gritty portrayal of World War II-era pilots. One suspects Wellman, lounging in his director's chair, was adorned in a scarf and leather flyboy helmet while barking orders at the Duke.

According to the AMC channel, which played the film prior to the DVD release, it was the first time in 30 years it's been shown anywhere...respected film critic (pbffft) Leonard Maltin states in the introduction that the film has `languished in the vaults'...you really have to admire Leonard Maltin's ability to turn a dramatic phrase...I guess that's why he appears in DVD special featurettes, provides commentary tracks, and gets paid the big DVD bucks (how much do you think he got for his work here?)...I suppose it could have been worse...they could have gone with Gene Shalit...written by Ernest K. Gann (The High and the Mighty), the film features the direction of William A. Wellman (The Public Enemy, The Ox-Bow Incident, The High and the Mighty) and stars The Duke himself, John Wayne (he also listed as a co-producer). Appearing with Wayne is Lloyd Nolan (Airport), Walter Abel (Silent Night, Bloody Night), James Arness (The Thing From Another World), and Andy Devine (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance). Also appearing is Allyn Joslyn (The Fastest Gun Alive), Jimmy Lydon (""Rocky Jones, Space Ranger""), Harry Carey Jr. (The Exorcist III), Hal Baylor (Evel Knievel), Sean McClory (The Gnome-Mobile), Wally Cassell (Thunderbirds), Regis Toomey (Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea), and a whole bunch of other people most likely dead by now...including Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer of `The Little Rascals' fame, who died at the ripe old age of about 31 after sustaining a fatal gunshot wound in an argument over fifty bucks...but that is neither here nor there...The story begins as we see a crew in a plane, the captain being a man named Dooley (Wayne), trying to navigate some especially difficult weather. The aircraft and crew are a part of the Air Transport Command (ATC), a division of the U.S. military whose responsibility it is to deliver materials and men by air to where they're needed most...anyway, the aircraft, flying somewhere near the artic circle, is off course, and running low on fuel. To make matters worse, the wings are icing up and they're losing altitude quickly. The only thing left to do is attempt a landing, which they do, but guess what? They're in uncharted territory, or, as one man states, `A place not even the Eskimos would go'. Supplies are limited, and temperatures, at best, reach a high of about 40 below zero, but word has gotten back to command that `Dooley's down!', which mobilizes the group of highly dedicated pilots and their crews to quickly organize a search mission, knowing that Dooley and his men have precious little time. The task seems insurmountable (the search area is something like 10 thousand square miles), but with some prayers and a little luck, they'll be able to locate Dooley and crew before they turn into human Popsicles (I bet The Duke would make for an especially salty tasting frozen treat).All right, one thing to keep in mind is this movie was before the days satellite navigation and global positioning systems so if your plane went down, the radio was the best means to get found...that is until the battery goes dead...I really enjoyed this film, and I think it's probably something most any true John Wayne fan would get a kick out of it, specifically because it gives the rare opportunity to see him in a rather uncharacteristic role of not an action hero, but a fairly regular man stuck in an extreme situation, one which he seemed to handle really well. If you're just a fan of his western roles and have no interest in seeing him have to deal with issues that can't be solve with a rifle or six-shooter, then best skip this film, as you'll probably be bored and/or disappointed. I've seen where some have said this movie was corny, dated, and overly sentimental, but I don't think there's anything wrong with that...so it lacked the cynical and pessimistic attitudes so often seen in films nowadays...is it so hard to believe a group of airmen would go to the lengths they did to find one of their own? That's part of it...how many of us have ever belonged to a tightly knit group, one where the welfare of one is tied to the welfare of all? I don't know that I have, other than beside my own family...I'm sure this is something those who risk their lives on a regular basis for people they've never even met (firemen, policemen, servicemen) understand better than anyone, including myself. But I digress...what did I like about the movie? Well, after reading the description, I was expecting something like the film The Flight of the Phoenix (1965), but Island in the Sky was a lot different. The story not only focused on the stranded men, but also on those set out to find them. We get to witness a large and concerted effort put forth, and the sometimes difficult decisions that have to be made during an operation like this...I thought the voice over narrative was an interesting way to communicate Wayne's characters dilemmas in terms of keeping not only his stuff together, but also that of his crew, given the difficulties they faced, especially that of the incessant cold. Have you ever really been cold? Like so cold no matter what you did you could never get warm? The fierce, miserable cold does a lot of things, but one of the most dangerous is its ability to sap ones strength, along with their will to survive, something that came through clearly in this story. One last thing to those who've seen the film...am I the only one who cheered when Dooley smacked the increasingly unstable navigator Murray? Oooh, I wanted to beat on that guy but good with all his annoying babbling on...The Amazon website displays very well the extent of the copious extras available on this Paramount/Batjac release, so I won't rehash them, but I did really enjoy the featurette titled `Flying for Uncle Sam', which provided a brief history of the ATC and the importance of their contributions to modern, commercial aviation. The picture quality on this DVD is sharp, and the audio comes through very clean. As to why this film has gone unseen so many years, it's because it was more or less an independent film, owned by Batjac, which grew out of John Wayne's production company Wayne-Fellows, and was run by Michael Wayne until his death in 2003...and his wife Gretchen (The Duke's daughter-in-law) assumed control, made a deal with Paramount Home Entertainment, and Viola! Here we are...some other Paramount/Batjac releases to look for... The High and the Mighty (1954), Hondo (1953), McLintock! (1963), Man in the Vault (1956), Plunder of the Sun (1953), Ring of Fear (1954), Seven Men from Now (1956), and Track of the Cat (1954).Cookieman108By the way, I noticed one person had an issue with the planes at the end not landing...now I'm no pilot, but I think this was due to the fact they weren't equipped with skis on the landing gear, to allow for landing, and taking off again, in the snow, something that would have been impossible with the standard landing gear (taking off again, that is...)",4,"""Maybe I'm drinking the wrong kind of liquor but them mountains ain't on my

908181,AUHG8KSHI529U,B0009ML2JC,Craig Matteson,"[11, 11]","This is quite a good movie that is very much worth seeing because it could not and would not be made today.  When this film was made fifty-three years ago, in 1953, heavier than air flight had only been around for fifty years.  There was no GPS, no cell phones, none of the incredibly great survival gear we have today, and no beacons.  Just some talented and brave guys in some pretty incredible, but rather primitive airplanes.John Wayne is the pilot Captain Dooley.  He is part of air transport wing of the military that moves planes and goods and the shortest route goes through the northern routes (great circles and all).  Their plane ices up and has enough problems that they have to find a place to put their DC 3 down and find a frozen lake.  They have meager supplies and very little in the way of safety or survival gear - which seems preposterous nowadays, but was very real back then.  Their problem is that first they have to go missing and then they have to be found and the bitter weather has them trying to survive in a frozen wilderness at 40 below zero.Their friends in the other crews have many problems in trying to find them, the bitter and rapidly changing weather only being one of them.  How do you see them?  They have limited battery life without the engines running, so can they hear them and get them located in time?  The backup ""coffee grinder"" is hard for men without food to keep cranking.  The flight crews also have problems with navigation so close to the north pole.  The compass system used back them tended to wander as they flew and getting readings from the sun and stars was not trivial with the constantly shifting cloud cover.  So, there is plenty of material for dramatic tension in this film.The film problem, and one that would make it hard to get filmed today is that flyers tend not to move much, nor do men freezing on the ground.  There isn't much room in the planes nor in the shelter of men huddling together struggling to stay alive.  There are some scenes out in the storms and snow and the flight crews aren't always in the planes.  And the personalities of the men making up the flight crews are draw with enough variety and vividness to provide for interesting contrast.  Andy Devine's portrayal of Willie Moon is everyone's favorite and justly so - watch the movie to find out why.  There are many others including James Arness as the gargantuan and very physical Mac McMullen.  Lloyd Nolan also does a wonderful job as Capt. Stutz.  And if you look in the seat next to Stutz you can see the grown up Alfalfa (Carl Switzer - who died senselessly and far too young).This is a very good movie and the black and white actually adds to the power of the story.  All the scenes of these planes in the air would have meant much more to audiences in 1953 - almost none of them having ever been in a plane - than they do to us.  Although, those of us who enjoy vintage planes love seeing these wonderful machines.Enjoy this film because there is a lot to enjoy and you will never see a film like this made today - so enjoy it for the unusual things it has to offer the viewer.",4,So many wonderful things in this film - ENJOY,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,3126,"['quite', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'seeing', 'could', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'today', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'fifty-three', 'years', 'ago', '1953', 'heavier', 'air', 'flight', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'fifty', 'years', 'was', 'GPS', 'cell', 'phones', 'none', 'incredibly', 'great', 'survival', 'gear', 'have', 'today', 'beacons', 'Just', 'talented', 'brave', 'guys', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'rather', 'primitive', 'airplanes.John', 'Wayne', 'pilot', 'Captain', 'Dooley', 'part', 'air', 'transport', 'wing', 'military', 'planes', 'goods', 'shortest', 'route', 'northern', 'routes', 'great', 'circles', 'plane', 'up', 'enough', 'problems', 'have', 'find', 'place', 'put', 'DC', '3', 'down', 'find', 'frozen', 'lake', 'have', 'meager', 'supplies', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'safety', 'survival', 'gear', 'preposterous', 'nowadays', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'back', 'then', 'problem', 'first', 'have', 'go', 'missing', 'then', 'have', 'be', 'found', 'bitter', 'weather', 'trying', 'survive', 'frozen', 'wilderness', '40', 'zero.Their', 'friends', 'other', 'crews', 'have', 'many', 'problems', 'trying', 'find', 'bitter', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'weather', 'only', 'being', 'one', 'How', 'do', 'see', 'have', 'limited', 'battery', 'life', 'engines', 'running', 'so', 'can', 'hear', 'get', 'located', 'time', 'backup', 'coffee', 'grinder', 'hard', 'men', 'food', 'keep', 'cranking', 'flight', 'crews', 'also', 'have', 'problems', 'navigation', 'so', 'close', 'north', 'pole', 'compass', 'system', 'used', 'back', 'tended', 'wander', 'flew', 'getting', 'readings', 'sun', 'stars', 'was', 'not', 'trivial', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'cloud', 'cover', 'So', 'plenty', 'material', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'film.The', 'film', 'problem', 'one', 'would', 'make', 'hard', 'get', 'filmed', 'today', 'flyers', 'tend', 'not', 'move', 'much', 'do', 'men', 'freezing', 'ground', ""n't"", 'much', 'room', 'planes', 'shelter', 'men', 'huddling', 'together', 'struggling', 'stay', 'alive', 'are', 'scenes', 'out', 'storms', 'snow', 'flight', 'crews', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'planes', 'personalities', 'men', 'making', 'up', 'flight', 'crews', 'are', 'draw', 'enough', 'variety', 'vividness', 'provide', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'Andy', 'Devine', 'portrayal', 'Willie', 'Moon', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'justly', 'so', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'including', 'James', 'Arness', 'gargantuan', 'very', 'physical', 'Mac', 'McMullen', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'also', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Capt', 'Stutz', 'look', 'seat', 'next', 'Stutz', 'can', 'see', 'grown', 'up', 'Alfalfa', 'Carl', 'Switzer', 'who', 'died', 'senselessly', 'far', 'too', 'young', '.This', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'actually', 'power', 'story', 'scenes', 'planes', 'air', 'would', 'have', 'meant', 'much', 'more', 'audiences', '1953', 'almost', 'none', 'having', 'ever', 'been', 'plane', 'do', 'who', 'enjoy', 'vintage', 'planes', 'love', 'seeing', 'wonderful', 'machines.Enjoy', 'film', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'film', 'made', 'today', 'so', 'enjoy', 'unusual', 'things', 'offer', 'viewer']",N/A

I know John Wayne's work and enjoy some of it but have never been a huge fan (except for the Searchers, which I think is his best role).  This movie, based on an Ernest Ganns novel, is terrific.  It moves along well and really works to show the struggles that Wayne and his crew, along with the rescue teams, are up against in the cold bitter unexplored territory of Canada.  The black and white film is crisp and the images are powerful.  The supporting cast are all terrific and there are some very moving powerful scenes.  I won't give away the movie, but things happen that one would expect in a cold, unforgiving place with little food and no contact with any other people.  I found one of the scenes on that frozen tundra to be particularly powerful.  I suspect anyone who sees the movie will recall it.  The extras are wonderful and this disc is a great bargain.  Perfect for fans of Wayne, airplane films, the Director William Wellman, or anyone who enjoys films where the characters are put in difficult situations.

Great cast includes Andy Devine (Stage Coach), Lloyd Nolan (Peyton Place, Ice Station Zebra), James Arness (Gunsmoke) and Harry Carey, Jr. (The Searchers, Rio Grande). This movie is similar to the 60s ""Flight of the Phoenix"" except that it's not just the crew trying to survive in a severe climate but in this case there is a parallel story of an active and desperate search to find the downed craft is being conducted by a platoon of planes piloted by Devine, Nolan and company. Thus, the movie appears to have twice the action of the excellent and similar film, the Phoenix. It's a desperate attempt to stay alive on the ground while maintaining a weak radio signal while the air is another desperate battle as their comrades try to search beyond their fuel limits in repeated flights to find the lost crew.

When I began to be chilled watching Wayne and Company battling 40 to 70 degree below 0 Fahrenheit cold when it was 80 degrees above 0 in the apartment, I knew this was as a good one. The script is basically the same one used in hundreds of films, while the key performers, to a viewer who regularly attended neighborhood movie houses in the thirties and forties, were very familiar character actors (Andy Devine, Lloyd Nolan, Allen Joslyn) and a few newcomers, one fated to be a Very Big TV Star (James Arness). John Wayne is the glue that holds it all together, as he deftly handles the role of the ill-fated pilot of the plane lost in the brutal cold of the uncharted North. No doubt, he is playing John Wayne, we would miss him if did not do so, but it is a controlled Wayne, with only a few of the  familiar mannerisms.No doubt it is a relic of what be called the Traditional Era of Talking Pictures; the sentiments and values are residues of a period when it was still respectable to be a Man Among Men, although never a Men Without Women; in the films, at any rate, never mind what the reality was.Given these characteristics, see if your mind is sufficiently flexible to accept the customs of an earlier day (of a day going out of style, even as the picture was being made); if not, you will probably find the whole thing an archaic bore, if so, then you might well enjoy it.",4,John Wayne and his Buddies Make a Good One,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,1560,"['black', 'white', 'drama-killing', 'narration', 'overall', 'fine', 'crash-crisis-courage-buddy', 'film', 'B', 'picture', 'script', 'A-', 'picture', 'When', 'began', 'be', 'chilled', 'watching', 'Wayne', 'Company', 'battling', '40', '70', 'degree', '0', 'Fahrenheit', 'cold', 'when', 'was', '80', 'degrees', '0', 'apartment', 'knew', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'script', 'basically', 'same', 'one', 'used', 'hundreds', 'films', 'key', 'performers', 'viewer', 'who', 'regularly', 'attended', 'neighborhood', 'movie', 'houses', 'thirties', 'forties', 'were', 'very', 'familiar', 'character', 'actors', 'Andy', 'Devine', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'Allen', 'Joslyn', 'few', 'newcomers', 'one', 'fated', 'be', 'Very', 'Big', 'TV', 'Star', 'James', 'Arness', 'John', 'Wayne', 'glue', 'together', 'deftly', 'role', 'ill-fated', 'pilot', 'plane', 'lost', 'brutal', 'cold', 'uncharted', 'North', 'No', 'doubt', 'playing', 'John', 'Wayne', 'would', 'miss', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'controlled', 'Wayne', 'only', 'few', 'familiar', 'mannerisms.No', 'doubt', 'relic', 'what', 'be', 'called', 'Traditional', 'Era', 'Talking', 'Pictures', 'sentiments', 'values', 'are', 'residues', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'respectable', 'be', 'Man', 'Men', 'never', 'Men', 'Women', 'films', 'rate', 'never', 'mind', 'what', 'reality', 'characteristics', 'see', 'mind', 'sufficiently', 'flexible', 'accept', 'customs', 'earlier', 'day', 'day', 'going', 'style', 'even', 'picture', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'not', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'whole', 'thing', 'archaic', 'bore', 'so', 'then', 'might', 'well', 'enjoy']",N/A

Uneven in tone, swinging wildly from slapstick comedy (James Arness throwing his wake-up caller out a window), to uncharacteristically tearful (a desperate John Wayne who knows the Lord's Prayer by heart but not Psalm 23, arguably the most oft-quoted scripture used at funerals).  I don't know which was more unsettling; Arness grinning like a lunatic throughout or Wayne close to being weepy.  All this was made worse by a yappy, overly DRAMATIC narration that just did not know when to leave well enough alone.  When you have to map out the thoughts in character's heads rather than let their features say if for them it shows an incredible lack of trust in the material or the actor's ability to illustrate what was going on.  Far worse, some of the melodrama was punctuated by in-tandem reactions, everyone striking the same pose!  Corny was the least of their problems.  Where was the tension inherent in the situation?  This movie was strangely impersonal, filled instead with clich&eacute;s and unconvincing acting by most (as interesting as it was populating this movie with former child actors, some did not make the transition into adulthood as well as could be hoped).Yes, the Spam scene was funny, Andy Devine always produced good work, and the scene of the airman `lost' in the blizzard was heart wrenching.

908197,AKKSHEGRQVQRK,B0009ML2JC,Great Movie Addict,"[1, 1]","While mid-century Hollywood was churning out some of the worst films to hit the silver screen, maverick Warner studios was taking chances that resulted in some of the best work of the 1950`s, among which Wellman's ""Island"" is clearly one of the better, workmanlike examples. This rescue epic from Ernest Gann has Wayne in one of his most solid roles. He's ably supported by old pros like Lloyd Nolan, Walter Abel, Regis Toomey, Paul Fix, and others. Also note a sterling early endeavor by James Arness, whose considerable talent shown here seems wasted in light of his minimal-effort, wince-and-grunt stint as Matt Dillon (an oversight for which he was very, very well compensated). Bob Steele, one of many underused actors, is suitably grim and effective. Andy Devine plays a straight dramatic role instead of a moron, proving himself more than capable. Keep an eye on the minor players, which include many of tv's early Warner success stories and one half of the detective team from ""77 Sunset Strip"". Camera work by Archie Stout, who shot many of Wayne's clunky westerns in the early 30's, is superb. William Clothier's aerial shots are simply terrific, a real testament to the art of b&w that would rarely be seen today. Overblown action flicks and special effects can't match many of the less explosive but highly memorable dramatic scenes in this overlooked classic. Example: the pilots are searching for a 5-mile long lake on which they believe Wayne and his crew have landed - Clothier's splendid shot draws back from a handful of search planes, and still further, further back, until you see the chilling sight that frustrates the rescue effort, in no uncertain terms. Today's computer-obsessed movie makers could learn a great deal from work like this. The DVD print is a bit over sharpened but is otherwise as crisp and stark as the original I saw in 1953. Thanks to Paramount for a job well done. Considering the price and the extras, this package is a good deal.",4,A worthy tribute to expert movie making,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,1975,"['mid-century', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'churning', 'out', 'worst', 'films', 'hit', 'silver', 'screen', 'maverick', 'Warner', 'studios', 'was', 'taking', 'chances', 'resulted', 'best', 'work', '1950', 's', 'Wellman', 'Island', 'clearly', 'one', 'better', 'workmanlike', 'examples', 'rescue', 'epic', 'Ernest', 'Gann', 'Wayne', 'one', 'most', 'solid', 'roles', 'ably', 'supported', 'old', 'pros', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'Walter', 'Abel', 'Regis', 'Toomey', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'others', 'Also', 'note', 'sterling', 'early', 'endeavor', 'James', 'Arness', 'considerable', 'talent', 'shown', 'here', 'wasted', 'light', 'minimal-effort', 'wince-and-grunt', 'stint', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'oversight', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'compensated', 'Bob', 'Steele', 'one', 'many', 'underused', 'actors', 'suitably', 'grim', 'effective', 'Andy', 'Devine', 'straight', 'dramatic', 'role', 'instead', 'moron', 'proving', 'more', 'capable', 'Keep', 'eye', 'minor', 'players', 'include', 'many', 'tv', 'early', 'Warner', 'success', 'stories', 'one', 'half', 'detective', 'team', '77', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Camera', 'work', 'Archie', 'Stout', 'who', 'shot', 'many', 'Wayne', 'clunky', 'early', '30', 'superb', 'William', 'Clothier', 'aerial', 'shots', 'are', 'simply', 'terrific', 'real', 'testament', 'art', 'b', 'w', 'would', 'rarely', 'be', 'seen', 'today', 'action', 'flicks', 'special', 'effects', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'many', 'less', 'explosive', 'highly', 'memorable', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'overlooked', 'classic', 'Example', 'pilots', 'are', 'searching', '5-mile', 'long', 'lake', 'believe', 'Wayne', 'crew', 'have', 'landed', 'Clothier', 'splendid', 'shot', 'back', 'handful', 'search', 'planes', 'still', 'further', 'further', 'back', 'see', 'chilling', 'sight', 'rescue', 'effort', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'Today', 'computer-obsessed', 'movie', 'makers', 'could', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'work', 'DVD', 'print', 'bit', 'sharpened', 'otherwise', 'crisp', 'stark', 'original', 'saw', '1953', 'Thanks', 'Paramount', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'Considering', 'price', 'extras', 'package', 'good', 'deal']",N/A

908199,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0009ML2JC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Hurl that can of Spam away, John Wayne. I would've, too.ISLAND IN THE SKY, coming out in 1953, is John Wayne's long overlooked aviation drama, partly because Wayne's later and glossier aviation soap opera, THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY, garnered most of the pub and partly because ISLAND IN THE SKY hasn't been seen in decades. It's only recently that's it's been made available on DVD. If you're looking for a change of pace in your John Wayne viewing experience, then this might do ya. In this one, the Duke dabbles with acting more than he springs into action, and he is terrific.This is a man's film, yo, and devoid of jaded cynicism. Instead, it celebrates all those sterling qualities men hope they possess when the chips are down. Resourcefulness. Ruggedness. Loyalty. A certain stoic temperament. With all the hazards nature can muster to derail a safe flight, heavy ice is the most feared. ISLAND IN THE SKY charts the struggle for survival of the five-men crew of a DC3 transport plane which crash landed somewhere on the icy wastes of the Labrador peninsula. The film also tracks the aviation community as it learns of the downed aircraft and frantically organizes a search party. But imagine what it must have been like back then, the equipment that they had to work with, compared to today's aviation technology. Keep in mind, also, that back then, the vast Canadian wilderness was regarded as mostly uncharted geography. The airborne search teams find themselves fighting off fatigue and a dwindling of hope, not to mention contending with the hazards brought about by continuous flying in unforgiving climate.On the frozen crash site, Captain Dooley (John Wayne) tirelessly works to maintain morale and keep his men alive. On this last part, he won't entirely succeed. The odds are so stacked against them. Food running out. The wood won't burn. There's an impending arctic storm. Their communication devices are rapidly failing, and, eventually, they're down to a hand-cranked emergency radio. Thank goodness for the coffee grinder which ends up powering it. And to demonstrate that Dooley is only human, he later loses his cool enough that he lashes out at one of his crewmen. Mostly, though, the captain keeps it together (but this may be the movie in which the Duke shows fright the most often).One thing I really found hard to believe is that Dooley and his men were able to survive the sub-zero weather with nothing more than a dug-in refuge and blankets. But never mind.We note Dooley's occasional forays into introspection, in which his voice-over reveals his own white-knuckled fear and his concern for his men. The director himself, Mr. Wellman, takes a turn at voice-over narration. To keep things moving and to distract us from Wellman's almost preachy tone, the film regularly shifts the focus onto the rescue mission, and we take in that sense of camaraderie shared amongst these aviators. Dooley is a well-liked pilot, but it goes beyond that. The unspoken feeling is that it could be any one of them that could've gone down. Saving Dooley also becomes this affirmation, a way to allay their own fears. It's sort of like this ""All for one, and one for all"" mentality. I'll look for you today, so that you can look for me tomorrow.There are moments of levity, mostly brought about by the hulking James Arness, Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer (""Whatever's customary.""), and by Andy Devine (and this is one of Devine's best outings, by the way). But, mostly, the film clings to this almost dry, stripped-down documentary format. It lends a certain verisimilitude to the picture. And to demonstrate how old school this flick is, those aren't miniatures but real life DC3 planes you see soaring in the skies. Keep an eye out for one of the film's opening shots as the camera (rigged on another plane) majestically zooms in on Dooley's aircraft. It's a dramatic moment.No, ISLAND IN THE SKY isn't as showy or, frankly, as character-driven and entertaining as THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX. But it's a well-done film and a fine hearkening back to a time when men were hardy and loyal to each other and when, as supplies are parachuted down to the fallen crew, cans of Spam must still be hurled away with all one's might. Because Spam is just nasty.The DVD's extras:- Intro by film critic Leonard Maltin (00:03:58 minutes long)- Audio Commentary by Leonard Maltin, the director's son William Wellman Jr., actors Darryl Hickman & James Lydon, and aviation buff Vincent Longo- The Making Of ISLAND IN THE SKY breaks down into 4 featurettes, all introduced by Leonard Maltin (he's hard to get rid of, I guess): ""Dooley's Down"" - a behind-the-scenes overview (00:08:07 minutes); a profile of ""Ernest K.

John Wayne is the captain of the plane who is responsible for keeping everyone alive until they can be found by a rescue mission. This isn't always easy. Everyone is frightened and frightened men are wont to take stupid chances. In order to keep them under control, he is forced to be harsh and, sometimes, even cruel. This takes its toll. There is one point when one of the men freezes to death when the Duke seems close to tears. I have seen him portray many things but never before had I seen that.Much of the story is told through a narrator. This is done very effectively. The narrator describes the feelings and emotions of the characters as the camera portrays their actions. This does not often work but it does here.This has an all star cast for its time. It has the favorites and friends of both John Wayne and director William Wellman. Many may be thought of as character actors but some are well known.

908209,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0009ML2JC,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[54, 58]","A viewer can watch this movie in several ways.  As cinematic entertainment it is somewhat weak as the movie sometimes has a semi-documentary feel.  There are moments of philosophizing that slow the pace of the movie down, but sometimes people react to desperate situations by philosophizing, which may be that person's way of helping themselves.  However, there are wonderful scenes of DC-3s flying in formation and at various altitudes, including what appears to be very low level flying.  Also, the methodology used by John Wayne's men to survive after they crash remains as solid today as when this movie was made in 1953.Captain Dooley (John Wayne) is flying over Canada when his DC-3 transport develops problems.  He lands during the winter in an open area surrounded by trees.  Unfortunately for Dooley much of Canada is white with open areas surrounded by trees, and the technology that we take for granted today is decades into the future.  Thus, Dooley can only give minimal information about what he sees and where he thought he was.The movie spends time switching between Dooley and his men and the men searching for Dooley in the air, led by Stutz (Lloyd Nolan) and a cadre of actors.  This movie includes a host of famous actors including James Arness (McMullen -just a couple of years away from his first appearance in ""Gunsmoke""), Andy Devine (Moon), Hunt (Harry Carey, Jr. - who just had a role in the 2005 movie ""Comanche Stallion""), Gainer (Mike Connors, billed as Touch Connors, who would star in ""Mannix"" in another decade), Miller (Paul Fix, a veteran of nearly 250 movie and tv appearances), Fess Parker as a co-pilot (who would soon make Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone famous all over again), and others too numerous to mention.  This movie is worth watching for fans of classic movie stars.Dooley allows his men little time to ponder their situation.  He rapidly marshals the men to make a shelter and focus on the business of surviving.  He also followed the number one rule of survival, staying at the crash site.  Very likely the survivors were rescued because they remained with their downed plane.  The men also were careful how they used their remaining power to try and help their rescuers locate them.There are numerous excellent scenes of the rescuers trying to decide when and how to go find their downed friends, and even better scenes of them flying through clouds into uncertain terrain, with navigation equipment and knowledge of the area that we would consider primitive today.  For fans of the DC-3/C-47 this movie is a treasure trove.  There are numerous interior and exterior shots of the plane, and the reality of operating the plane in sub-arctic weather is well-documented as the men face iced windows and wings and the frigid temperatures of the interior of the plane.The search for the men on the ground is the highlight of the movie, and though the narration by director William A. Wellman, whose landmark movie ""Wings"" is famous for winning the first Academy Award, is sometimes intrusive, Wellman directed the film well.Critics often lampoon John Wayne for his macho characters, but in this movie he does an excellent job as a real person in a bad situation, reacting in a way more like an average person might react.  I find the character of Dooley well-acted and believable.  However, look for another Wayne aerial movie, ""The High and the Mighty,"" which is even better and received a number of Academy Award nominations.This movie was restored prior to its release, and the black and white images are outstanding.  While I am reluctant to recommend this film for entertainment value, fans of aviation movies, airplanes, the DC-3/C-47, John Wayne, character actors in general, and survival movies will find this movie at least interesting and hopefully enjoyable, as I did.",4,One to Watch for Aviation Fans,1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,3825,"['viewer', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'several', 'ways', 'cinematic', 'entertainment', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'semi-documentary', 'feel', 'are', 'moments', 'philosophizing', 'slow', 'pace', 'movie', 'down', 'sometimes', 'people', 'react', 'desperate', 'situations', 'philosophizing', 'may', 'be', 'person', 'way', 'helping', 'However', 'are', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'DC-3s', 'flying', 'formation', 'various', 'altitudes', 'including', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'low', 'level', 'flying', 'Also', 'methodology', 'used', 'John', 'Wayne', 'men', 'survive', 'crash', 'remains', 'solid', 'today', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1953.Captain', 'Dooley', 'John', 'Wayne', 'flying', 'Canada', 'when', 'DC-3', 'transport', 'problems', 'winter', 'open', 'area', 'surrounded', 'trees', 'Unfortunately', 'Dooley', 'much', 'Canada', 'white', 'open', 'areas', 'surrounded', 'trees', 'technology', 'take', 'granted', 'today', 'decades', 'future', 'Thus', 'Dooley', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'minimal', 'information', 'what', 'where', 'thought', 'was.The', 'movie', 'spends', 'time', 'switching', 'Dooley', 'men', 'men', 'searching', 'Dooley', 'air', 'led', 'Stutz', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'cadre', 'actors', 'movie', 'host', 'famous', 'actors', 'including', 'James', 'Arness', 'McMullen', 'couple', 'years', 'away', 'first', 'appearance', 'Gunsmoke', 'Andy', 'Devine', 'Moon', 'Hunt', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'just', 'had', 'role', '2005', 'movie', 'Comanche', 'Stallion', 'Gainer', 'Mike', 'Connors', 'billed', 'Touch', 'Connors', 'who', 'would', 'star', 'Mannix', 'decade', 'Miller', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'veteran', 'nearly', '250', 'movie', 'tv', 'appearances', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'co-pilot', 'who', 'would', 'soon', 'make', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'Daniel', 'Boone', 'famous', 'over', 'again', 'others', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'fans', 'classic', 'movie', 'stars.Dooley', 'men', 'little', 'time', 'ponder', 'situation', 'rapidly', 'men', 'make', 'shelter', 'focus', 'business', 'surviving', 'also', 'followed', 'number', 'one', 'rule', 'survival', 'staying', 'crash', 'site', 'Very', 'likely', 'survivors', 'were', 'rescued', 'remained', 'downed', 'plane', 'men', 'also', 'were', 'careful', 'how', 'used', 'remaining', 'power', 'try', 'help', 'rescuers', 'locate', 'are', 'numerous', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'rescuers', 'trying', 'decide', 'when', 'how', 'go', 'find', 'downed', 'friends', 'even', 'better', 'scenes', 'flying', 'clouds', 'uncertain', 'terrain', 'navigation', 'equipment', 'knowledge', 'area', 'would', 'consider', 'primitive', 'today', 'fans', 'DC-3/C-47', 'movie', 'treasure', 'trove', 'are', 'numerous', 'interior', 'exterior', 'shots', 'plane', 'reality', 'operating', 'plane', 'sub-arctic', 'weather', 'well-documented', 'men', 'face', 'iced', 'windows', 'wings', 'frigid', 'temperatures', 'interior', 'plane.The', 'search', 'men', 'ground', 'highlight', 'movie', 'narration', 'director', 'William', 'A.', 'Wellman', 'landmark', 'movie', 'Wings', 'famous', 'winning', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'sometimes', 'intrusive', 'Wellman', 'directed', 'film', 'well.Critics', 'often', 'lampoon', 'John', 'Wayne', 'macho', 'characters', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'real', 'person', 'bad', 'situation', 'reacting', 'way', 'more', 'average', 'person', 'might', 'react', 'find', 'character', 'Dooley', 'well-acted', 'believable', 'However', 'look', 'Wayne', 'aerial', 'movie', 'High', 'Mighty', 'even', 'better', 'received', 'number', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations.This', 'movie', 'was', 'restored', 'prior', 'release', 'black', 'white', 'images', 'are', 'outstanding', 'am', 'reluctant', 'recommend', 'film', 'entertainment', 'value', 'fans', 'aviation', 'movies', 'airplanes', 'DC-3/C-47', 'John', 'Wayne', 'character', 'actors', 'general', 'survival', 'movies', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'least', 'interesting', 'hopefully', 'enjoyable', 'did']",N/A
908210,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0009ML2JC,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","Although a big fan of John Wayne, I only recently discovered this relatively old, black and white movie about civilian pilots who, during World War II, served in Air Transport Command of US Army Air Force and flied supplies from USA and Canada to US bases in Greenland and Iceland, from where other pilots (both American and British) picked it up to bring it to United Kingdom.This was a dangerous service and some of those pilots died in accidents when flying over frozen emptiness of Greenland, Northern Canada or Northern Atlantic. Even if a damaged plane managed to land somewhere, its crew was still in great danger of dying from exposure and hunger, if not timely rescued. Ernest K. Gann, a renowned pilot of Air Transport Command, wrote in 1944 a novel inspired from a real tragedy (crash and following search and rescue operations) which occurred in 1943.Produced by John Wayne, who also played the main role, the adaptation of this novel to the cinema became in 1953 ""The Island in the sky"". It was a box office success and it paved the way to another succesful adaptation of one of Gann's novels in 1954 -it was ""The high and the mighty"", also produced by John Wayne.The film is quite realistic and you should not expect here any extravagant acts of heroism or huge display of action scenes. But still, the tension builds up pretty nicely and in the second half this film pinned me to the seat and I wouldn't (and couldn't) pause watching it.Now granted, this film is not the best of John Wayne movies and it is not a masterpiece. But still, there is something in it, which mostly is missing from more recent films - a kind of simplicity of story and message, without an ""F"" bomb every two minutes and mostly without cynicism. A story about tough men doing a very hard job and ready to go to the most extreme lenghts to save their buddies from horrible death. Also, a leader of men, who in a moment of doubt and weakness searches comfort and inspiration by saying ""Lord's Prayer"", this is not something that we can see often in recent films. John Wayne is excellent in this film and all other actors, much less known, did a very good job too.I liked this film and I am very happy that I bought it.

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","This film (along with its partner, &#34;The High and the Mighty&#34;, filmed a year later)is among the best aviation films ever made. And why shouldn't it be: it is directed by William &#34;Wild Bill&#34; Wellman, who crafted many fine aviation films, beginning w/&#34;Wings&#34; in 1927; it is adapted from a novel by Ernie K. Gann (who also wrote the screenplay) one of the finest aviation writers ever; and it is co-produced and stars John Wayne, who performs exceptionally well. Wellman and Gann were both pilots; Wellman earning his &#34;Wild Bill&#34; moniker as a combat pilot in WW I; and their combined aviation expertise is exhibited well in this film, as well as in &#34;High & Mighty&#34;. This film is less well known than the more highly regarded &#34;High & Mighty&#34;, but there's not much difference between them, quality wise. &#34;Island&#34; was out of circulation for many years, and now that it's available and beautifully restored on DVD, it is finally getting the critical acclaim it always deserved. As in all &#34;John Wayne Collection&#34; DVDs, this one has some quality special features, beginning w/the introduction by Leonard Maltin, and including the interview he conducts w/Harry Carey, Jr and the bio sketch of Ernie Gann. While Wayne plays the lead, it is really an ensemble work, featuring, in addition to Carey, Jr, appearances by Andy Devine, James Arness, Lloyd Nolan, Walter Abel, Mike Connors, Darryl Hickman and many others. Carl &#34;Alfalfa&#34; Switzer (&#34;Whatever's customary&#34;) and Fess Parker, both have roles as co-pilots on the rescue C-47s.

This one isn't quite as lame at THTM but it's still only minor entertainment. The story is about a bunch of commercial airline pilots that work flying transport planes out of greenland. John's plane gets lost and goes down in the northern part of apparently at that time uncharted Canada. It's cold and they only have a couple of cans of salmon to survive on. Interestingly, there is very little discussion of the fact that they are starving and freezing, and John and crew look pretty hale and lively hopping about in the snow having emotional issues. Meanwhile, the ""rowdy"" group of other commercial airline pilots all drop everything to look for the downed airplane. Clever methods to alert the other planes are used, there is one scene where you think they are recognized but they are not. One of John's crew wanders off and freezes in a not totally convincing manner, then they are all rescued...or not. I mean, the planes fly away without landing and picking them up! I guess they'll come back tomorrow, after John et al survive another freezing night in the wilds with a giant can of frozen spam that is dropped to them.The film is nice to look at, James Arness shows himself as capable of being lively, and Andy Devine shows up as a weirdly immobile pilot.

Wayne plays Dooley, a pilot transporting goods for the ATC.  When his plane flies into a bad storm, he sets down the plane in the uncharted area of Labrador with his crew.  They must try and survive the Arctic-like conditions with little heat and even less food.  While Dooley and his crew try to get by, Dooley's fellow pilots and friends embark on a search to find them before time runs out.  It is really great to see this movie released on DVD in such a format.  Island in the Sky is a beautifully shot movie, thanks to cinematographer William Clothier, with sweeping natural vistas and great aerial footage of C-47's, remember there was no CGI in 1953.  For a great movie about loyalty, friendship, and survival, this is a safte bet.John Wayne gives one of his best performances as Dooley, the pilot who crash lands in the freezing regions of Labrador and must will his crew to survive.  Some Wayne critics thought Wayne was not a great actor, but roles like this allowed him to show off his acting ability.  Watch the scene when it seems the rescue efforts are going to fail, and you'll see what I mean.  The great ensemble cast of rescue pilots include Lloyd Nolan, James Arness, Andy Devine, Walter Abel, Allyn Joslyn, Harry Carey JR, and Cass Gidley.  Dooley's crew includes Sean McClory as Lovatt, the co-pilot, Jimmy Lydon as Murray, the navigator, Hal Baylor as Stankowski, the engineer, and Wally Cassell as D'Annunzia, the radioman.  The long overdue Special Collector's Edition includes a restored and remastered full screen presentation, a great commentary track with film critic Leonard Maltin(among others), a 40-minute documentary about the making of the movie, Ernest K. Gann, author of Island in the Sky, aerial filming and an interview with Harry Carey JR.  Other extras include a featurette about the Air Transport Command, newsreel footage of the premiere, a Duke intro to Gunsmoke, a great montage of Batjac movies, theatrical trailer, and a photo gallery.
