It's amazing how someone like Eugene Brown could live a life of crime and also serve 17 years in prison and still come out from under and help the youth from following his footsteps. This movie has also taught me a lesson to not judge a persons past, encourage them to do better and not judge them if they stumble.A ex convict is hired as a high school janitor, being paid minimum wage and fighting for a relationship with his two kids are not the only things that worry him.  Ignoring the street life and trying to make all of his wrongs right, Eugene Brown is destined to be a better man and a better father.Eugene is requested by the school principal to step in and watch of a group of teenagers in detention. His past dealing with the street life equip him to handle the wannabe gangstas and he is slowly given a little respect.He uses the game of chess to help the troubled teens deal with making the wrong decesions in life.This was a great movie!

1683482,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00H47IXF6,Paul Allaer,"[11, 11]","&#34;Life Of A King&#34; (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story,  &#34;inspired by true events&#34; we are reminded as the movie opens, of Eugene Brown (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.). Brown is finishing his stint of a long prison term (we later learn it was 17 years) and we see him playing chess with another inmate. Upon Brown's release, the inmate tells him &#34;Take care of the King, everything else follows&#34;. Brown eventually gets a job as a janitor in a local high school (by lying on his application form when he is asked if he's convicted of a crime). The high school kids, most of them African-American, are a tough bunch to deal with but Brown eventually manages to mesmerize them during detention period by teaching them the game of chess. Then one day, the HS principal is tipped off that Brown is a convicted felon, and she fires him on the spot. At this point we are about 40 min. into the movie and to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out,Couple of comments: first of all, this is the Cuba Gooding show from start to finish, as he is in virtually every single frame of this movie. Second, the movie definitely feels like a modern version of &#34;To Sir With Love&#34;, as much of the movie centers around Brown's evolving relationship with the high school kids, in particular 3 of the more &#34;thug-ish&#34; boys, one of which seemingly having an amazing natural talent for chess. Third, the last half hour of the movie is rather predictable, as the chess club founded by Brown is entering various tournaments, yet it is also the most moving part of the movie. At the end of the movie, we are told what became of Eugene Brown in real life. Bottom line: I went to see this movie with little or no expectations, and walked out of the theatre rather surprised and moved by it all.This movie opened without any pre-release hype or advertising on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati this weekend. When I went to see it last night, I had a private showing, as in: I literally was the only person in the theatre. That is a shame, as this movie is much better than you might expect.

One mistake and it can be taken away.&#34; Eugene Brown (Gooding Jr.) is an ex-felon who is struggling to find a job and relate to his kids. After finding a job as a high school janitor he is asked to watch the detention kids one day until they can find a replacement. When he brings up the topic of chess he begins to change the lives of the &#34;troubled kids&#34; forever. I love movies based on true stories, but I was worried about seeing this going in. One one hand a true story with Cuba Gooding Jr, that is good. On the other hand though I thought how many times can they remake Lean On Me? After movies like that one and Dangerous Minds, Freedom Writers, Fame, etc... I wondered how different can this one be. While I have to admit it wasn't 100% different it was very very good and much much better then I was expecting. The best part about this movie is that it stayed just a step or two away from being way to cheesy to be enjoyed but it did a good job of changing things just enough to keep it feeling real while keeping the emotion that it needed. Different enough from the previous &#34;helping inner city kids&#34; movies to make it interesting and worth seeing. Overall, very good and never took the over-the-top cheesy way out that so many of these types of movies do. That is a good thing and because of that I highly recommend the movie.
