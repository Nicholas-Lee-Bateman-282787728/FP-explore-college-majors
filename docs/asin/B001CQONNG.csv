1177097,ATXNKCR0PMNMT,B001CQONNG,Oldskooljunkie,"[1, 1]",THIS is one of the best family shows to ever come on television. I absolutely love it. You can watch it with your children and not have to worry about their being ANY inappropriate content. I was soooooooooooooo excited when I saw that they released this on DVD however I was very upset that they have not released the rest of the seasons. PLease hurry and release the rest of the show so i can finish my collection.,5,AWESOME and APPROPRIATE FAMILY SHOW!,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,416,"['THIS', 'one', 'best', 'family', 'ever', 'come', 'television', 'absolutely', 'love', 'can', 'watch', 'children', 'not', 'have', 'worry', 'being', 'ANY', 'inappropriate', 'content', 'was', 'soooooooooooooo', 'excited', 'when', 'saw', 'released', 'DVD', 'however', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'have', 'not', 'released', 'rest', 'seasons', 'PLease', 'hurry', 'release', 'rest', 'show', 'i', 'can', 'finish', 'collection']","Sister, Sister: Season 1"
1177098,A3INQQEX56YKJV,B001CQONNG,PSF,"[0, 0]","From the opening scene of the series premiere when Tia, Tamera, Ray, and Lisa first meet in ""The Meeting"", to the Four Tops-Motown tribute (a recurring theme throughout much of the first season of Sister Sister) at the end of ""The Concert"", laughter is a guarantee for everybody in the house!Much of Season 1 focuses on twins-separated-at-birth-adopted-by-single-parents-then-reunited-by-coincidence, Tia and Tamera getting to know each other as people, and becoming awestruck at their profound differences and similarities.  Much of the former can be said about the girls' adoptive parents, Ray Campbell (Tim Reid) and Lisa Landry (Jackee Harry).  The best episode exemplifying this conflict is ""The Birthday""--when Lisa feels inferior to Ray due to his extravagant birthday treat to the girls and their friend, Sarah (the late Brittney Murphy), in the city of Chicago, and the two parents being forced to share a single hotel room.  Another recurring theme throughout the entire series that begins in ""Cheater Cheater"" and ""The Pimple"" involves the twins switching places (usually at Tamera's insistence) to avoid an unpleasant reality on one or both of their parts.  While this does prove comedic, it also instills an important life lesson about honesty and hard work.As does the entire premiere season of Sister Sister!  Whether you watched the show when it was on the air or not, you will definitely find yourself a charming, heartwarming, endearing experience in this DVD set.",5,Now everybody knows I ain't never gonna let you go!,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,1482,"['opening', 'scene', 'series', 'premiere', 'when', 'Tia', 'Tamera', 'Ray', 'Lisa', 'first', 'Meeting', 'Four', 'Tops-Motown', 'tribute', 'recurring', 'theme', 'much', 'first', 'season', 'Sister', 'Sister', 'end', 'Concert', 'laughter', 'guarantee', 'everybody', 'house', 'Much', 'Season', '1', 'focuses', 'twins-separated-at-birth-adopted-by-single-parents-then-reunited-by-coincidence', 'Tia', 'Tamera', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'people', 'becoming', 'awestruck', 'profound', 'differences', 'similarities', 'Much', 'former', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'girls', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'Ray', 'Campbell', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'Lisa', 'Landry', 'Jackee', 'Harry', 'best', 'episode', 'exemplifying', 'conflict', 'Birthday', 'when', 'Lisa', 'inferior', 'Ray', 'due', 'extravagant', 'birthday', 'treat', 'girls', 'friend', 'Sarah', 'late', 'Brittney', 'Murphy', 'city', 'Chicago', 'two', 'parents', 'being', 'forced', 'share', 'single', 'hotel', 'room', 'recurring', 'theme', 'entire', 'series', 'Cheater', 'Cheater', 'Pimple', 'twins', 'switching', 'places', 'usually', 'Tamera', 'insistence', 'avoid', 'unpleasant', 'reality', 'one', 'parts', 'prove', 'comedic', 'also', 'important', 'life', 'lesson', 'honesty', 'hard', 'work.As', 'entire', 'premiere', 'season', 'Sister', 'Sister', 'Whether', 'watched', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'not', 'will', 'definitely', 'find', 'charming', 'heartwarming', 'endearing', 'experience', 'DVD', 'set']","Sister, Sister: Season 1"
