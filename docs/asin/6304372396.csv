Hopkins is so letter-perfect he takes your breath away. Loud, brash, vain, arrogant, silly, clowning, crying, painting, loving, he is totally Picasso.

I disagree with some of the other reviewers- I think Hopkins did a great job at inhabiting Picasso's spirit.  Did the film ""explain"" him?  No- but Picasso was such an elusive  complicated man, it's not entirely surprising.  As when Hopkins did Nixon- sure, you don't totally forget it's Anthony Hopkins- but as with his Nixon, Hopkins is mezmorizing here.  Hopkins said after playing men like in Remains of the Day who were basically dead from the waist down, he relished the opportunity to play a man who was completely alive- and his joy here is apparent.  Beside Hopkins, Natascha McElhone is very intriguing, as are the rest of the supporting cast and the Parisian and Spanish locations.

I cannot even imagine what is going on in his head.The story is poor and came out of a self-serving book. Ladies who go to bed with rich old guys should not complain that they are misunderstood: it is a business. Hopkins, the best actor of his generation, cannot pull out being Spanish, which is probably impossible for an English gentleman. All his reactions are wrong, and if you had had a chance to see Picasso in person or in a movie, you would cringe at every gesture Hopkins makes. Being Spanish is a whole culture, the gestures are part of it.A portrait of Picasso as a brutal lover has no interest at all. And Picasso was not like that: he was selfish, but he was also very cunning, a man of very cold intelligence (where is that in the film?), maybe cruel but always calculating.

417244,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,6304372396,Edmonson,"[24, 24]","""Surviving Picasso"" (1996) is directed by James Ivory and produced by Ismail Merchant, the same two who gave us ""Howard's End"". This story tells of Picasso's (Anthony Hopkins) relationship with his mistress Francoise Gilot (Natasha McElhone), who was the mother to two of Picasso's children. The movie also introduces us to a number of the other women who encircled Picasso's life during the time of their relationship, including Olga Picasso (Jane Lapotaire), Dora Maar (Julianne Moore), Marie-theses Walter(Susannah Harker), and Jacquueline Rogue (Diane Verona), and some of his artist friends, such as Henri Matisse. The movie is an intimate and believable account of Picasso's life right down to details of the artist's paintings and the moments where he is creating his works of art. The producers may have had a great deal of trouble getting any rights to show Picasso's paintings but it doesn't show except for the fact that his more famous works are not illustrated. Great care was taken to show believable works of art as well as the artist's studio and life.This 2010 dvd disc is coded NTSC and so is playable on North American dvd players and looks very good. There are however no special features, not even a commentary for the film.

417245,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6304372396,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","SURVIVING PICASSO (Dir. James Ivory, a Merchant-Ivory Production, 1996, 125 minutes)~This fantastic though slightly frenzied and more-than-a-little sanitized adaptation of Franoise Gilot's bookLife with Picassowas just way too much fun for me. It is the story of the romance (some say marriage) between Picasso (a stunning, almost frightening Sir Anthony Hopkins) and small-fry artist Franoise Gilot (Natascha McElhone).Gilot, who I always hate to try to understand, but always seems to come off as a self-absorbed harpy-among-the-French-artists, was allegedly ""the only person to survive"" Picasso. Meaning the only person to ""survive"" a romance with him. It is true that one or two of his paramours committed suicide or else ruined themselves over him, but I always say it's because he chose girlfriends as whacked-out as he was. Gilot, a budding artist of some talent, fell into Picasso's hands but ultimately escaped.This, then, is her story.The film takes a good, leisurely pace through Picasso's life--not so much the romance as the polarization occurring between him and Gilot. I found it so wonderful just watching a thing like that. No other film of this intensity exists, and no one could dare play Picasso after Hopkins (unless in some future film he is portrayed in his youth). I simply loved all the familiar-looking places, in lots of the film actually being in those actual places. Golfe Juan is an example.Gilot's story, if you have ever read her book, is heartrending in the extreme. She claims Picasso ""branded his women""--usually by burning their cheeks with a cigarette--and she describes what is plainly a paranoid schizophrenic artist to a ""t"". How much of Gilot's story is true is open to debate. This film, however, is overall an excellent history lesson, actually brings to life some famous photos of Picasso, just has everything and then some.Best of all, it did not come out nearly as awful as I was afraid it was going to be. Get this, for the sake of art history, because you won't see its like again--unless you meet Picasso in Painter's Heaven.Since I have been asked questions about the DVD, let me say upfront: generally I review FILMS. DVDs, unless something is outstanding, I do not review. However, this film is in English, the film transfer is as good as any, and beyond that I say buy it if you want it. If not, or uncertain, do not expect my reviews to give every tiny detail.Honestly, I do not know why I would be asked about subtitles unless it is from someone who can't hear--in which case I can't help. I nearly always ignore whether a DVD has subtitles or not, but I have always assumed hearing-impaired film lovers have a DVD-buying system.",5,Don't fall for the notion Ariana Huffington wrote the book on which this is based,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,2684,"['SURVIVING', 'PICASSO', 'Dir', 'James', 'Ivory', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'Production', '1996', '125', 'minutes', '~This', 'fantastic', 'slightly', 'frenzied', 'more-than-a-little', 'sanitized', 'adaptation', 'Franoise', 'Gilot', 'bookLife', 'Picassowas', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'story', 'romance', 'say', 'marriage', 'Picasso', 'stunning', 'almost', 'frightening', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'small-fry', 'artist', 'Franoise', 'Gilot', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', '.Gilot', 'who', 'always', 'hate', 'try', 'understand', 'always', 'come', 'off', 'self-absorbed', 'harpy-among-the-French-artists', 'was', 'allegedly', 'only', 'person', 'survive', 'Picasso', 'Meaning', 'only', 'person', 'survive', 'romance', 'true', 'one', 'two', 'paramours', 'committed', 'suicide', 'else', 'ruined', 'always', 'say', 'chose', 'girlfriends', 'as', 'whacked-out', 'was', 'Gilot', 'budding', 'artist', 'talent', 'fell', 'Picasso', 'hands', 'ultimately', 'escaped.This', 'then', 'story.The', 'film', 'good', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'Picasso', 'life', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'romance', 'polarization', 'occurring', 'Gilot', 'found', 'so', 'wonderful', 'just', 'watching', 'thing', 'other', 'film', 'intensity', 'one', 'could', 'dare', 'play', 'Picasso', 'Hopkins', 'future', 'film', 'portrayed', 'youth', 'simply', 'loved', 'familiar-looking', 'places', 'lots', 'film', 'actually', 'being', 'actual', 'places', 'Golfe', 'Juan', 'example.Gilot', 'story', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'book', 'heartrending', 'extreme', 'Picasso', 'branded', 'women', 'usually', 'burning', 'cheeks', 'cigarette', 'what', 'plainly', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenic', 'artist', 't', 'How', 'much', 'Gilot', 'story', 'true', 'open', 'debate', 'film', 'however', 'overall', 'excellent', 'history', 'lesson', 'actually', 'life', 'famous', 'photos', 'Picasso', 'just', 'everything', 'then', 'some.Best', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'nearly', 'as', 'awful', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Get', 'sake', 'art', 'history', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'like', 'again', 'meet', 'Picasso', 'Painter', 'Heaven.Since', 'have', 'been', 'asked', 'questions', 'DVD', 'let', 'say', 'upfront', 'generally', 'review', 'FILMS', 'DVDs', 'something', 'outstanding', 'do', 'not', 'review', 'However', 'film', 'English', 'film', 'transfer', 'as', 'good', 'say', 'buy', 'want', 'not', 'uncertain', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'reviews', 'give', 'tiny', 'detail.Honestly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'asked', 'subtitles', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'nearly', 'always', 'ignore', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'not', 'have', 'always', 'assumed', 'hearing-impaired', 'film', 'lovers', 'have', 'DVD-buying', 'system']",Surviving Picasso VHS
