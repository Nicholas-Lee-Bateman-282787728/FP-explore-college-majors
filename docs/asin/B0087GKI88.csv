1547430,A1XOAWH42QK71Q,B0087GKI88,"Bob A. Gabbert ""Bob""","[0, 4]","I had only watched one or two shows all the way through when I stupidly bought all 9 seasons on DVD. I thought, since it had the same creator as JAG and was a JAG spinoff that it would be of the same quality of story and characters. Wrong! They have the same elements: a strong leader, a pretty boy, and his woman opposite, but that's where the similarity with JAG ends.Rather than Mark Harmon being a good leader, as the admiral was on JAG, he's just pissed off all of the time. And the Pretty Boy? How in the world did that jerk get on any show? There are a few good things about the show. The woman chosen for Sam's role is very good, and if the writers would give her some meat rather than forcing her to be the foil for the Jerk, she could make the show interesting. The two strongest bit players are the weirdo in the lab and the forensics expert. She's great; he's like listening to your too-old grandfather talk about the good old days, endlessly.Technically, several of the shows have sound problems just as other reviewers have stated, but some of the shows are so bad, you wish there were more technical problems. A pissed off leader, a jerk, and an old man who talks way too much doesn't cut it. Save your money unless you want a sure cure for insomnia.
