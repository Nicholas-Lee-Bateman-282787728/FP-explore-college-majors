While Combat was at the platoon level, but really concentrated on the squad, with Campbell being a captain it focused more on the company. The gallant men was typical warner brothers formula tv making with its stereotypical characters. Its quality couldn't be compared to the harsh realism of Combat. Its characters were finely created and the leads were quality actors..especially the great Sgt Saunders brought to full three dimension by a great actor. Combat's realism formed the template for Spielberg's Private Ryan. the jarring, heavy duty firepower of Kirby's B.A.R, Saunder's Thompson and the rest of the squad's M1 rifles still echo in my ears...Just a fantastic shows which is why the Gallant Men didn't last.

1571632,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B008NNY89A,Gary P. Cohen,"[31, 31]","I used to like to play tv trivia online.  One of my favorite questions was ""What was the other WWII infantry program that started the same year as Combat on ABC but only lasted 1 year to Combat's 5.  The answer is The Gallant Men.The Gallant Men premiered on ABC in 1962 at 7:30 Friday nights.  Combat premiered the same year on the same network on Tuesday night at 7:30.  They both were good shows, but Combat was better.Combat concerned an infantry squad slogging through France, The Gallant Men concerned a squad slogging through Italy.  The Gallant Men was produced by Warner Bros. It starred a Warner contract player, Robert McQueeney as an Ernie Pyle-type war correspondent, Conley Wright.  The war is seen through his eyes.  William Reynolds also starred as Capt. Jim Benedict.  (After this series, Reynolds replaced Stephen Brooks as Efrem Zimbalist's partner on The FBI.  Then like Brooks, he stupidly left the series early himself.)  The rest of the cast included ex-boxer Roland LaStarza as a GI, Richard X. Slattery as Sgt McKenna.  (Slattery played the James Cagney role as Capt. Morton on the tv version of Mr. Roberts.)  Another cast member was a singer Eddie Fontaine who, like Connie Stevens on Warners Hawaiian Eye, would every so often have a song for the squad or some pretty girl he would meet in a captured Italian town.  (Fontaine, like Connie Stevens, was probably signed to the Warner Bros label.)  Another cast member Roger Davis later replaced Peter Duel on Alias Smith and Jones after Duel committed suicide.The Gallant Men did not do well Friday nights so it was transferred by ABC to Saturday nights at 7:30 against Jackie Gleason on CBS, then the number one show on tv.  Soon after it was cancelled.  (I always enjoyed the Gallant Men more than Combat at the time.  I think it had something to do with not having school the next day that heightened my enjoyment.)During the 1980s, I managed to obtain about half The Gallant Men's episodes on videotape.  Later I purchased all of Combats seasons on DVD.  I came to the belated conclusion that Combat was the better show.  It had more action and even more, it had Vic Morrow.  I was in junior high school at the time and can remember discussing the previous night's Combat with my friends at school the next day.  We all thought Vic Morrow was the coolest guy on tv.  Watching Combat years later, Morrow is still cool even years after his premature death( making the terrible ""Twilight Zone"" film.)Another problem with The Gallant Men was that it had too many episodes where the squad is undergoing R&R; in a captured town and one of the members would fall for a pretty girl and get involved in some sort of a romantic triangle.  Combat just had way more action.  (By the way, if you come across a comedy-like episode guest starring Warner contract player and character actor John Dehner (The Roaring Twenties,) as a cowardly German officer, avoid it like the plague.  It is terrible.)Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised when Warners released The Gallant Men on DVD.  I greatly look forward to seeing the episodes that I was unable to obtain.  Now if only 20th. Century Fox would wake up and release the best WWII series of them all: 12 O'Clock High.",5,A Pleasant Surprise from Warner Bros.,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,3228,"['used', 'like', 'play', 'tv', 'trivia', 'online', 'One', 'favorite', 'questions', 'was', 'What', 'was', 'other', 'WWII', 'infantry', 'program', 'started', 'same', 'year', 'Combat', 'ABC', 'only', 'lasted', '1', 'year', 'Combat', '5', 'answer', 'Gallant', 'Men.The', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'premiered', 'ABC', '1962', '7:30', 'Friday', 'nights', 'Combat', 'premiered', 'same', 'year', 'same', 'network', 'Tuesday', 'night', '7:30', 'were', 'good', 'shows', 'Combat', 'was', 'better.Combat', 'concerned', 'infantry', 'squad', 'slogging', 'France', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'concerned', 'squad', 'slogging', 'Italy', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'was', 'produced', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'starred', 'Warner', 'contract', 'player', 'Robert', 'McQueeney', 'Ernie', 'Pyle-type', 'war', 'correspondent', 'Conley', 'Wright', 'war', 'seen', 'eyes', 'William', 'Reynolds', 'also', 'starred', 'Capt', 'Jim', 'Benedict', 'series', 'Reynolds', 'replaced', 'Stephen', 'Brooks', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'partner', 'FBI', 'Then', 'Brooks', 'stupidly', 'left', 'series', 'early', 'rest', 'cast', 'included', 'ex-boxer', 'Roland', 'LaStarza', 'GI', 'Richard', 'X.', 'Slattery', 'Sgt', 'McKenna', 'Slattery', 'played', 'James', 'Cagney', 'role', 'Capt', 'Morton', 'tv', 'version', 'Mr', 'Roberts', 'cast', 'member', 'was', 'singer', 'Eddie', 'Fontaine', 'who', 'Connie', 'Stevens', 'Warners', 'Hawaiian', 'Eye', 'would', 'so', 'often', 'have', 'song', 'squad', 'pretty', 'girl', 'would', 'meet', 'captured', 'Italian', 'town', 'Fontaine', 'Connie', 'Stevens', 'was', 'probably', 'signed', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'label', 'cast', 'member', 'Roger', 'Davis', 'later', 'replaced', 'Peter', 'Duel', 'Alias', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'Duel', 'committed', 'suicide.The', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'Friday', 'nights', 'was', 'transferred', 'ABC', 'Saturday', 'nights', '7:30', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'CBS', 'then', 'number', 'one', 'show', 'tv', 'Soon', 'was', 'cancelled', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'more', 'Combat', 'time', 'think', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'having', 'school', 'next', 'day', 'heightened', 'enjoyment', '1980s', 'managed', 'obtain', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'episodes', 'videotape', 'Later', 'purchased', 'Combats', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'came', 'belated', 'conclusion', 'Combat', 'was', 'better', 'show', 'had', 'more', 'action', 'even', 'more', 'had', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'was', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'time', 'can', 'remember', 'discussing', 'previous', 'night', 'Combat', 'friends', 'school', 'next', 'day', 'thought', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'was', 'coolest', 'guy', 'tv', 'Watching', 'Combat', 'years', 'later', 'Morrow', 'still', 'cool', 'even', 'years', 'premature', 'death', 'making', 'terrible', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'film', 'problem', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'was', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'where', 'squad', 'undergoing', 'R', 'R', 'captured', 'town', 'one', 'members', 'would', 'fall', 'pretty', 'girl', 'get', 'involved', 'sort', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'Combat', 'just', 'had', 'way', 'more', 'action', 'way', 'come', 'comedy-like', 'episode', 'guest', 'starring', 'Warner', 'contract', 'player', 'character', 'actor', 'John', 'Dehner', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'cowardly', 'German', 'officer', 'avoid', 'plague', 'terrible', 'Anyway', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'Warners', 'released', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'DVD', 'greatly', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'was', 'unable', 'obtain', 'Now', 'only', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'would', 'wake', 'up', 'release', 'best', 'WWII', 'series', '12', ""O'Clock"", 'High']",N/A

All 26 episodes are in the order in which they were originally shown on TV. I am watching them in order and have seen the first 16 shows.I was only 9 years old when the show was originally broadcast and don't remember much at all about it, so it is all pretty much new entertainment to me. The Gallant Men could have been titled ""Combat! The Musical.""  The GIs did spend a lot of time on R&R; behind the lines, and it seems like in every episode, there was an excuse for PFC D'Angelo (Singer Eddie Fontaine) to find a guitar and sing a song or two.  Also, Lt Kimbo (former singer Robert Ridgely)gets an occasional chance to croon as well.  And there was always comedic by-play between PFCs Lukavich and Hansen.  This cut down on the action scenes, but did allow for some character development.  There is a lot of actual war footage edited in for the general combat scenes and the show's action scenes were all well done.The acting is all very good, and the guest stars include: William Windom, Robert Conrad, Mala Powers, Dianne Foster, Gail Kobe, Peter Brown, and a host of other soon to be TV stars.It is too bad that The Gallant Men only lasted one season with 26 episodes.  Its main problem was its time slots.  First on Friday nights, it went against top-rated western Rawhide, and then moved to Saturday nights, where it could never make a beachhead against the wildly popular Jackie Gleason.Still, The Gallant Men was a good show and any fan of 1960s TV would enjoy watching this little-remembered series.",5,Very Pleased With The Gallant Men DVD Set,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,1650,"['DVD', 'set', 'contains', 'six', 'DVDs', 'very', 'nice', 'case', 'individual', 'DVD', 'disc', 'number', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', '26', 'episodes', 'are', 'order', 'were', 'originally', 'shown', 'TV', 'am', 'watching', 'order', 'have', 'seen', 'first', '16', 'shows.I', 'was', 'only', '9', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'pretty', 'much', 'new', 'entertainment', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'Combat', 'Musical', 'GIs', 'did', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'R', 'R', 'lines', 'episode', 'was', 'excuse', 'PFC', ""D'Angelo"", 'Singer', 'Eddie', 'Fontaine', 'find', 'guitar', 'sing', 'song', 'two', 'Also', 'Lt', 'Kimbo', 'former', 'singer', 'Robert', 'Ridgely', 'occasional', 'chance', 'croon', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'always', 'comedic', 'by-play', 'PFCs', 'Lukavich', 'Hansen', 'cut', 'down', 'action', 'scenes', 'did', 'allow', 'character', 'development', 'lot', 'actual', 'war', 'footage', 'edited', 'general', 'combat', 'scenes', 'show', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'done.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'guest', 'stars', 'include', 'William', 'Windom', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'Mala', 'Powers', 'Dianne', 'Foster', 'Gail', 'Kobe', 'Peter', 'Brown', 'host', 'other', 'soon', 'be', 'TV', 'stars.It', 'too', 'bad', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', '26', 'episodes', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'time', 'slots', 'First', 'Friday', 'nights', 'went', 'top-rated', 'western', 'Rawhide', 'then', 'moved', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'where', 'could', 'never', 'make', 'beachhead', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Jackie', 'Gleason.Still', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'was', 'good', 'show', 'fan', '1960s', 'TV', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'little-remembered', 'series']",N/A

It is in the original black and white, excellent audio + video quality. I had very good remembrances of this TV SERIES. In my country COSTA RICA it was exhibited around 1965-1966 in CHANNEL 6. I loved the very carismatic music at the end and, specially, the very IMPRESSIVE &#34;CANNON GUNFIRE&#34; presentations of the actors at the end of each episode. I was a kid by that time and I loved each episode, specially I liked that the Germans speaked in GERMAN which was very  impressive for me at that time , and, also, the soldiers speaking in REAL GERMAN, for me, gave a very elegant touch. So, I have present-realized my past remebrances. This show was exhibited at the same time, not the same hour, nor the same TV CHANNEL, that COMBAT and 12 O'CLOCL HIGH (Known in Spanish TV as &#34;COMANDO A&Eacute;REO&#34;), which were passed on TV CHANNEL 7. I liked very much the actuations of Conley Wright, the was correspondent, sargeant Mc kenna ( actor Slattery), Di Angelo and the blonde soldier GIBSON. Every episode is full of WAR-action, humanity interaction and PANZER-tanks combat. This TV Series lasted for only 1 season.I think this TV Series was from ABC and it was putted for competition with COMBAT. But I liked very much both TV SERIES.
