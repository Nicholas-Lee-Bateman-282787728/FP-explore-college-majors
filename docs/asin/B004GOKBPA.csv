1407061,A334ORI2SLEQAO,B004GOKBPA,Lost in Thawt,"[2, 2]","I had ""Midnight Run"" on VHS tape some years ago and either lost it when I moved across country or threw it out, so I was glad to get a new copy.  I have to say though, two of the other movies on these two disks are pretty much a waste of time.I don't see the problem as being the fault of Chris McDonald. He could only work with what he was given.  On both ""Another Midnight Run,"" and ""Midnight Run Around,"" the story/script was pitiful.  The Jack Walsh that was portrayed by Robert DeNiro in the initial Midnight Run movie would never have behaved like the ignorant person of the later films who repeatedly allowed his ""prisoners"" to escape on the most flimsy pretenses.  Once I got around to ""Midnight Run For Your Life,"" I was thoroughly annoyed.  However that movie, while not up to the standard of the first film, was at least not as bad as the 2nd and 3rd stories.  I almost felt sorry for McDonald because the Jack Walsh he was given to portray was truly a pitiful person, and he probably did the best he could with disastrous scripts.  While I will probably watch the DeNiro film now and then, I doubt I'll ever be tempted to watch the other three again.",3,Sort of Awful,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,1162,"['had', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'VHS', 'tape', 'years', 'ago', 'either', 'lost', 'when', 'moved', 'across', 'country', 'threw', 'out', 'was', 'glad', 'get', 'new', 'copy', 'have', 'say', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'two', 'disks', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'waste', 'time.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'being', 'fault', 'Chris', 'McDonald', 'could', 'only', 'work', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'Around', 'story/script', 'was', 'pitiful', 'Jack', 'Walsh', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'initial', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'behaved', 'ignorant', 'person', 'later', 'films', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'allowed', 'prisoners', 'escape', 'most', 'flimsy', 'pretenses', 'Once', 'got', 'around', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'Your', 'Life', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'annoyed', 'However', 'movie', 'not', 'standard', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'bad', '2nd', '3rd', 'stories', 'almost', 'felt', 'sorry', 'McDonald', 'Jack', 'Walsh', 'was', 'given', 'portray', 'was', 'truly', 'pitiful', 'person', 'probably', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'disastrous', 'scripts', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'DeNiro', 'film', 'now', 'then', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'be', 'tempted', 'watch', 'other', 'three', 'again']",N/A
1407062,AADLE7DA85OZ6,B004GOKBPA,Mr Dip,"[0, 0]","But it is not all McDonald's fault !  In the 3 TV movies, the cast was let down by lousy scripts and even worst directing.  It is hard to find anything positive to say about any of the 3 TV films.  Another Midnight Run (1st TV film) was watchable, but flat and slow moving.  The con artists were initially entertaining then they just became very annoying.  Midnight Run Around (2nd TV film) was just plain terrible in every regard.  Midnight Run for your life (Last TV film) was better than the 2nd film, but that is faint praise.  I did like the hired killer.

1407064,A21VZBNPKJKLUO,B004GOKBPA,Peter R. Mcguire,"[1, 1]","Of course, the original Midnight Run is a classic.  It is in my opinion, one of the best ""buddy"" movies of all time.  Both Deniro and Grodin are in excellent form, and they were well matched in casting.Many have criticized the Midnight Run tv movies.  The criticisms are not well founded in my opinion.  I found all three to be good solid comedies.In the first movie, the acting is a bit over the top, as the cast tries to find their place in the roles, but the stories in all three films are solid and the acting gets better and better as the films roll along.What makes the tv movies work is not necessarily the Deniro character (though Christopher Macdonald does his best and actually gets better as the movies progress, so that by the third film, he is comfortable in a role established by one of the finest actors of our generation).No, it is the bad guys who make the movie work.  In the first one, the con artist couple were hilarious.  In the second, the country boy bad guy was wonderful and the supporting cast were just as good.  and finally, in the third movie, the girl who is trying to ""off"" herself was very compelling.Give these movies a chance.  I ignored the bad reviews and as a result, was truly pleased.",5,well worth your time,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1224,"['course', 'original', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'classic', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'buddy', 'movies', 'time', 'Deniro', 'Grodin', 'are', 'excellent', 'form', 'were', 'well', 'matched', 'casting.Many', 'have', 'criticized', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'tv', 'movies', 'criticisms', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'founded', 'opinion', 'found', 'three', 'be', 'good', 'solid', 'comedies.In', 'first', 'movie', 'acting', 'bit', 'top', 'cast', 'find', 'place', 'roles', 'stories', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'solid', 'acting', 'better', 'better', 'films', 'roll', 'along.What', 'tv', 'movies', 'work', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Deniro', 'character', 'Christopher', 'Macdonald', 'best', 'actually', 'better', 'movies', 'progress', 'third', 'film', 'comfortable', 'role', 'established', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'generation', '.No', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'first', 'one', 'con', 'artist', 'couple', 'were', 'hilarious', 'second', 'country', 'boy', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'finally', 'third', 'movie', 'girl', 'who', 'trying', 'off', 'herself', 'was', 'very', 'compelling.Give', 'movies', 'chance', 'ignored', 'bad', 'reviews', 'result', 'was', 'truly', 'pleased']",N/A
