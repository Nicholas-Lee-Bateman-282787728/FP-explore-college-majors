1124777,AB7VG07ELQ4N1,B001053088,"CrazyJaime ""Polar Bear""","[2, 2]","It's hard going back to Saturday Night Live after watching this. Human Giant is much more consistently funny. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered Human Giant, Tim and Eric Awesome Show, and Whitest Kids You Know all about the same time. Tim and Eric Awesome Show is too weird, not funny enough, Whitest Kids You Know is a hoot, although they are a bit sophomoric, mean and immature. The Human Giant fellas are more polished and thought-out. I enjoyed them quite a bit. It's been really hard to sit through Saturday Night Live lately without groaning. Human Giant is up there with Mr. Show. Look for a great appearance by Jon Krasinski from the Office in the extras.",5,Makes SNL rather lame,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,667,"['hard', 'going', 'back', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'watching', 'Human', 'Giant', 'much', 'more', 'consistently', 'funny', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'ordered', 'Human', 'Giant', 'Tim', 'Eric', 'Awesome', 'Show', 'Whitest', 'Kids', 'Know', 'same', 'time', 'Tim', 'Eric', 'Awesome', 'Show', 'too', 'weird', 'not', 'funny', 'enough', 'Whitest', 'Kids', 'Know', 'hoot', 'are', 'bit', 'sophomoric', 'mean', 'immature', 'Human', 'Giant', 'fellas', 'are', 'more', 'polished', 'thought-out', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'been', 'really', 'hard', 'sit', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'lately', 'groaning', 'Human', 'Giant', 'there', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'Look', 'great', 'appearance', 'Jon', 'Krasinski', 'Office', 'extras']",N/A

It's not one of the greatest ever (Monty Python still holds that title), but I ended up liking it more than I thought I would, although by the last two episodes, it starts to become very repetitive.  Most sketch comedy today is quite lame, and some of it is abysmally bad (like IFC's Whitest Kids U Know), but this stuff is relatively watchable.  Not every sketch works.  The Illusionators sketch gets tired after a while, and one motif that the Human Giant boys do is they always put in the sappy music almost at the end of every sketch that ends with a death or something sad.  After 8 episodes of this motif, it becomes staid and stale.  The ""Kneel to Verg"" sketch is a parody of Superman II (!), nearly 30 years after it was made, and it's actually kind of boring.  Their Exorcist parody is also tired.  SNL parodied this brilliantly with Richard Pryor as the priest and Laraine Newman as Regan (she mouthed the famous line ""your momma eats kitty litter"", which is funnier than what the kid in Human Giant's version says).  The handheld camera, fast cuts, and overly slick feel to it (this is MTV, you know) is very distracting.  There are some good sketches, like Swindle Tips: Coffee (which has great dialogue by Aziz), Catching a Predator (which has a great twist at the end of it), and Sensitivity Training (my favorite).There are cameos by many in the comedy world such as Patton Oswalt, Jon Benjamin, Brian Posehn, and Mary Lynn Rasjkub (who gave me a dirty look in a comedy club once while I was talking to Janeane Garofalo.  They were both headlining a comedy show in December of 2007.  That wasn't very nice of Mary Lynn).  Out of the three actors, Aziz comes across the best.  He has a goofy, funny, almost magnetic presence to him.  So, this is OK sketch comedy, not classic sketch comedy.",3,Decent sketch comedy....,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,1920,"['watched', 'show', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'saying', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'ever', 'not', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'Monty', 'Python', 'still', 'title', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'become', 'very', 'repetitive', 'Most', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'today', 'quite', 'lame', 'abysmally', 'bad', 'IFC', 'Whitest', 'Kids', 'U', 'Know', 'stuff', 'relatively', 'watchable', 'Not', 'sketch', 'Illusionators', 'sketch', 'tired', 'while', 'one', 'motif', 'Human', 'Giant', 'boys', 'do', 'always', 'put', 'sappy', 'music', 'almost', 'end', 'sketch', 'death', 'something', 'sad', '8', 'episodes', 'motif', 'staid', 'stale', 'Kneel', 'Verg', 'sketch', 'parody', 'Superman', 'II', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'actually', 'kind', 'boring', 'Exorcist', 'parody', 'also', 'tired', 'SNL', 'parodied', 'brilliantly', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'priest', 'Laraine', 'Newman', 'Regan', 'mouthed', 'famous', 'line', 'momma', 'eats', 'kitty', 'litter', 'funnier', 'what', 'kid', 'Human', 'Giant', 'version', 'handheld', 'camera', 'fast', 'cuts', 'overly', 'slick', 'feel', 'MTV', 'know', 'very', 'distracting', 'are', 'good', 'sketches', 'Swindle', 'Tips', 'Coffee', 'great', 'dialogue', 'Aziz', 'Catching', 'Predator', 'great', 'twist', 'end', 'Sensitivity', 'Training', 'favorite', 'are', 'cameos', 'many', 'comedy', 'world', 'such', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Jon', 'Benjamin', 'Brian', 'Posehn', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rasjkub', 'who', 'gave', 'dirty', 'look', 'comedy', 'club', 'once', 'was', 'talking', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'were', 'headlining', 'comedy', 'show', 'December', '2007', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'nice', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'three', 'actors', 'Aziz', 'best', 'goofy', 'funny', 'almost', 'magnetic', 'presence', 'So', 'OK', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'not', 'classic', 'sketch', 'comedy']",N/A
