The episodes include: Special Forces Divers, Marine Recon, Air Force Pararescue, Navy EOD, Marine Snipers, and Army Rangers. My favorite hour long episode was the Navy EOD. Having never been in the Military, I can't attest to the ""accuracy"" of the program, but from what they do show, I've gained a whole new respect for the guys that are selected.All the episodes are very entertaining to watch, and will make you wonder how you would fare under the same circumstances. Inspirational in that sense. Demonstrating the remarkable ability of the body to undergo such high stress and physical endurance.If you're looking for an inside look into our Militarys Elite Soldiers grueling training,and what makes Americas Military so great, do yourself a favor and pick this show up!
