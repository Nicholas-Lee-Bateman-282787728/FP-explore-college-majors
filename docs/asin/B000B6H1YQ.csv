936727,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B000B6H1YQ,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[4, 6]","'Dot.Kill', yet another direct-to-video horror/psychological thriller , sports the most redundant film title of all time.  I mean really people, why do you have the word ""Dot"" and an actual ""."" in the title?  Wouldn't it be pronounced ""Dot Dot Kill"" this way?  I have some serious issues with this ridiculous title.Anyways, the film stars Armand Assante(doing his best Tony Soprano imitation)as an Italian New York City cop tracking a serial killer who kills his victims and simultaneously broadcasts their death live on the internet(and somehow on the big screen in Times Square).  Assante's character also is fighting lung and bone cancer.  His doctor wants him admitted to the hospital because Assante only has a week or two left to live, but Assante will hear none of it.  He just wants the doctor to give him some painkillers so he can keep working his case.  The doctor says no, so Assante calls a favor in on an ex-hooker he had previously busted to hook him up with some illegal morphine.  Meanwhile, the killer keeps killing people and Assante must fight his illness to catch him.Assante gives a decent performance.  He grumbles, he stalks around pissed at all times, yells at his family, etc.  He's not bad but it just seems like he based his character on the idea of ""What if Tony Soprano was a cop?"".  The supporting cast is surprisingly good.  I don't really recognize any of them from any other movies but they do a fine job, especially Assante's boss:  the guy is a mumbling, angry police cheif.  Hilarity.The movie is shot pretty well.  The filmmakers were obviously going for the whole dark, dank atmosphere of David Fincher's 'Seven'.  The camera work and editing is also pretty well done.  The script is good, although pretty obvious(if you can't figure out who the killer is at about the thirty minute mark then you shouldn't be allowed to watch movies).Overall, 'Dot.Kill'(ugh, that title just irritates me)isn't a bad flick, but you've seen the story before many times:  from episodes of televison shows like 'Millenium' and the 'X-Files' to movies like the Japanese 'Kairo' and another recently released DTV flick named 'Devour'.  The story has been done to death, but 'Dot.Kill' puts a slightly different spin on it.  This is not a must-see flick by any means, but its not a horrible way to spend an hour-and-a-half.  Assante is good, the script is interesting but predictable, and overall the production values are excellent for a DTV film.  Check it out if there's nothing else at the video store, but I definitely wouldn't buy this one.",3,Dot Dot Kill,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2563,"[""'Dot.Kill"", 'yet', 'direct-to-video', 'horror/psychological', 'thriller', 'sports', 'most', 'redundant', 'film', 'title', 'time', 'mean', 'really', 'people', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'word', 'Dot', 'actual', 'title', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'pronounced', 'Dot', 'Dot', 'Kill', 'way', 'have', 'serious', 'issues', 'ridiculous', 'title.Anyways', 'film', 'stars', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'doing', 'best', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'imitation', 'Italian', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'cop', 'tracking', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'simultaneously', 'broadcasts', 'death', 'live', 'internet', 'somehow', 'big', 'screen', 'Times', 'Square', 'Assante', 'character', 'also', 'fighting', 'lung', 'bone', 'cancer', 'doctor', 'admitted', 'hospital', 'Assante', 'only', 'week', 'two', 'left', 'live', 'Assante', 'will', 'hear', 'none', 'just', 'doctor', 'give', 'painkillers', 'can', 'keep', 'working', 'case', 'doctor', 'so', 'Assante', 'favor', 'ex-hooker', 'had', 'previously', 'busted', 'hook', 'up', 'illegal', 'morphine', 'Meanwhile', 'killer', 'killing', 'people', 'Assante', 'must', 'fight', 'illness', 'catch', 'him.Assante', 'decent', 'performance', 'pissed', 'times', 'yells', 'family', 'etc', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'based', 'character', 'idea', 'What', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'was', 'cop', 'supporting', 'cast', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'recognize', 'other', 'movies', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'especially', 'Assante', 'boss', 'guy', 'mumbling', 'angry', 'police', 'cheif', 'Hilarity.The', 'movie', 'shot', 'pretty', 'well', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'obviously', 'going', 'whole', 'dark', 'dank', 'atmosphere', 'David', 'Fincher', ""'Seven"", 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'also', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'script', 'good', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'killer', 'thirty', 'minute', 'mark', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'allowed', 'watch', 'movies', '.Overall', 'title', 'just', ""n't"", 'bad', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'many', 'times', 'episodes', 'televison', 'shows', ""'Millenium"", 'X-Files', 'movies', 'Japanese', 'recently', 'released', 'DTV', 'flick', 'named', ""'Devour"", 'story', 'been', 'done', 'death', ""'Dot.Kill"", 'slightly', 'different', 'spin', 'not', 'must-see', 'flick', 'means', 'not', 'horrible', 'way', 'spend', 'hour-and-a-half', 'Assante', 'good', 'script', 'interesting', 'predictable', 'overall', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'DTV', 'film', 'Check', 'out', 'nothing', 'else', 'video', 'store', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'one']",Dot.Kill
