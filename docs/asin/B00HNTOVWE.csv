Acting was decent which is typical for these films (don't expect Joan Crawford or Cary Grant)  but this film was played straight without the usual Wynorski touches. Hardly any gore and no nudity with his bodacious women. The monster is CGI and isn't bad overall. It's a really good looking Gila monster design.The setting takes place in the 50s (the women in the movie didn't look very 50s-esque however and one of them had a tattoo which wasnt commonplace in that era) just like the original film and there are many cool nod's to that film as well. The hot rods were beautiful to see in 2014 and the whole 1950s look was perfect, even the music in the background was spot on. Unlike many remakes this wasn't a complete revisionist effort like the Thing, the Fly but actually stuck with how the original was to an extent. We don't get a real lizard this time, but I think we can accept that :)Another movie if it peaks your interest enough - check it out...It's not that bad at all.

His barrels leak and leach the toxic waste in the mine and possibly the water table. This waste produces giant insects and a giant Gila Monster (wonder how that thing wound up in the upper midwest?) that wreaks havoc on the local townsfolk and their livestock.Yes it was a simpler time when most boy's and girls knew how to behave and treated their elders with respect except for a few of them HOT RODDER TYPES. Many of the youngsters don't even use swear words.The story also has racy girls who dress provocatively in public and &#34;don't act lady like at all&#34; and we have the good clean boy who's only vice is hot rods and drag racing pitted against the juvenile delinquent and his hussy of a girlfriend injecting their poisonous lifestyle onto the community.Its up to the All American Teen and the local Sheriff to come to the townsfolk's rescue and rid them of this menace to society with the help of AAT's girlfriend and a few others. The shunned town juvenile delinquent bad boy even pitches in to help save the locals from certain death!!!The production values are very good with a couple of exceptions in acting abilities and CGI (may be intensional), but overall the cinematography, direction, acting, story, hot rods and copious amounts of cheese all add up to a 500 acres of cheese covered yummy corn.If the kids would step through the time machine with their folks and watch this movie they may see what kind of rabble raisers their parents or grandparents were and get a good laugh.This one is for all ages if they can handle the time period because there is only some suggestive hints here and there about sex and with very little violence.
