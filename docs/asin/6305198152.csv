While I admire Troy's love of the wild and industrious methods of building a grizzly proof suit, what the hell is he thinking in building something that you can't walk around in? Did he expect to have a helicopter at the ready to fly him around? All he needs to do is put a jet powerpack on the thing and his problems would be solved! Seriously though, I really felt for the guy when he got so close to his goal of fighting a grizzly in his suit only to have to abandon the thing because he kept falling over. It's humours but also very painful to watch, his disapointment is obvious.This film is a look into the male mind, specifically those survivalist types who seem to be actually hoping that the world will descend into chaos so they can test all their commando techniques. But this film reveals that realty keeps getting in the way with these guys, the world is not a comic book story. As Troy is Canadian, he is rather harmless and is non uses of guns is commendable, if he were american, he would be armed to the teeth. Troy's stories of his seeming mental instability makes me also question the whole bear encounter entirely.My other concern with this movie is that $150,000 of tax payer money went into this crazy project, didn't anyone from the government question building a 200lb suit that you can barely move around in?Oh well, watch and enjoy, it's an interesting story and Troy is a fascinating character, if a bit nuts.",4,"Surreal Story, beware of the old man!",1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,1543,"['offence', 'Troy', 'obviously', 'movie', 'annoyed', 'bush', 'types', 'who', 'feel', 'pathetic', 'admire', 'Troy', 'love', 'wild', 'industrious', 'methods', 'building', 'grizzly', 'proof', 'suit', 'what', 'hell', 'thinking', 'building', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'Did', 'expect', 'have', 'helicopter', 'ready', 'fly', 'around', 'do', 'put', 'jet', 'powerpack', 'thing', 'problems', 'would', 'be', 'solved', 'Seriously', 'really', 'felt', 'guy', 'when', 'got', 'so', 'close', 'goal', 'fighting', 'grizzly', 'suit', 'only', 'have', 'abandon', 'thing', 'kept', 'falling', 'over', 'humours', 'also', 'very', 'painful', 'watch', 'disapointment', 'obvious.This', 'film', 'look', 'male', 'mind', 'specifically', 'survivalist', 'types', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'actually', 'hoping', 'world', 'will', 'descend', 'chaos', 'can', 'test', 'commando', 'techniques', 'film', 'realty', 'keeps', 'getting', 'way', 'guys', 'world', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'Troy', 'Canadian', 'rather', 'harmless', 'non', 'uses', 'guns', 'commendable', 'were', 'american', 'would', 'be', 'armed', 'teeth', 'Troy', 'stories', 'seeming', 'mental', 'instability', 'also', 'question', 'whole', 'bear', 'encounter', 'entirely.My', 'other', 'concern', 'movie', '150,000', 'tax', 'payer', 'money', 'went', 'crazy', 'project', 'did', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'government', 'question', 'building', '200lb', 'suit', 'can', 'barely', 'move', 'around', 'Oh', 'well', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'interesting', 'story', 'Troy', 'fascinating', 'character', 'bit', 'nuts']",Project Grizzly VHS
454257,A1WBRD0IDA97MS,6305198152,"M0rr1gan ""merseian""","[2, 8]","In the light that all of the reviews of this bonehead's performance come from south of the 49th, I felt honor bound to throw my two cents worth in.  This video clearly demonstrates how foolish people can be.  I find it  terribly amusing that our hero really believes that he can build a suit of  armor that will let him grapple with a grizzly, when we all know that Papa  bear would make short work of the suit in the Project Grizzly video.  In  fact, the real danger would be if to the bear, who risks dying laughing,  not whether the suit will work or not.  The commentary about Canada and  bears is about as ludicrous as can be.  It is very obvious that Hurtubise  has not researched his quarry, or come to the common sense conclusion that  you avoid a more powerful enemy.  Regardless of how protective the suit is,  ten men aren't as powerful as one middling grizzly.  Armor doesn't do any  good when Papa bear peels it off like an orange rind. Were it not for these  half-baked macho posturings (the comments about bowie knives are especially  hilarious), Project Grizzly would be actual comedy, instead of the  confused, rambling, John-Wayne home-movie that it is.",2,the voice from Canada,948585600,"01 23, 2000",2000,1171,"['light', 'reviews', 'bonehead', 'performance', 'come', 'south', '49th', 'felt', 'honor', 'bound', 'throw', 'two', 'cents', 'worth', 'video', 'clearly', 'how', 'foolish', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'find', 'terribly', 'amusing', 'hero', 'really', 'can', 'build', 'suit', 'armor', 'will', 'let', 'grapple', 'grizzly', 'when', 'know', 'Papa', 'bear', 'would', 'make', 'short', 'work', 'suit', 'Project', 'Grizzly', 'video', 'fact', 'real', 'danger', 'would', 'be', 'bear', 'who', 'dying', 'laughing', 'not', 'suit', 'will', 'work', 'not', 'commentary', 'Canada', 'bears', 'as', 'ludicrous', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'obvious', 'Hurtubise', 'not', 'researched', 'quarry', 'come', 'common', 'sense', 'conclusion', 'avoid', 'more', 'powerful', 'enemy', 'Regardless', 'how', 'protective', 'suit', 'ten', 'men', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'powerful', 'one', 'middling', 'grizzly', 'Armor', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'when', 'Papa', 'bear', 'peels', 'off', 'orange', 'rind', 'Were', 'not', 'half-baked', 'macho', 'posturings', 'comments', 'bowie', 'knives', 'are', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'Project', 'Grizzly', 'would', 'be', 'actual', 'comedy', 'instead', 'confused', 'rambling', 'John-Wayne', 'home-movie']",Project Grizzly VHS
454258,A2FS6OGMZMALTD,6305198152,Mojo Jojo,"[0, 0]","It would be easy to make fun of the subject of this doc.  It's about Troy, a Canadian who after a brush with a bear, decides to build a bear proof suit.  Yes, this was parodied beautifully on the Simpsons, but I can tell you right now, Troy is much more complex and compelling than Homer.Let's get something straight here.  Troy is not the mountain man / engineering genius he wants to be.  He's just a regular joe trying to be something more.  That he's chosen this road just shows how misguided we humans can sometimes be.  On the other hand, there's something truly compelling his quest.  Like Don Quixote, Troy lives largely in a fantasy world where he gets to be Davy Crocket and Jaques Costea at the same time.This movie has more than its share of silly moments.  Shots of Troy getting hit by cars or thrown off cliffs to test (uh, yeah that makes sense) his suit.  Watch Troy rant about knives or give a story of his dramatic bear encounter (which amounts to basically a bear pushed him down and walked away) or hear him talk about the ""Science"" of his bear suit.  All of which are absurd and unbelievable except that they are real moments.  I could not look away, and I can't tell you why.  And for some reason, by the end, I even respected misguided Troy because at least he's out there, trying to make his own legend.I also recommend listening to the commentary tracks.  The directer track sheds such fascinating light on this character that by the end, you realize there's more going on in Troy's head then even he knows.",4,Strangely hypnotic portrait of a strangely hypnotic man,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,1532,"['would', 'be', 'easy', 'make', 'fun', 'subject', 'doc', 'Troy', 'Canadian', 'who', 'brush', 'bear', 'build', 'bear', 'proof', 'suit', 'Yes', 'was', 'parodied', 'beautifully', 'Simpsons', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'Troy', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'compelling', 'Homer.Let', 'get', 'something', 'straight', 'here', 'Troy', 'not', 'mountain', 'man', '/', 'engineering', 'genius', 'be', 'just', 'regular', 'joe', 'trying', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'chosen', 'road', 'just', 'how', 'misguided', 'humans', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'other', 'hand', 'something', 'truly', 'compelling', 'quest', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'Troy', 'largely', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'be', 'Davy', 'Crocket', 'Jaques', 'Costea', 'same', 'time.This', 'movie', 'more', 'share', 'silly', 'moments', 'Shots', 'Troy', 'getting', 'hit', 'cars', 'thrown', 'off', 'cliffs', 'test', 'uh', 'yeah', 'sense', 'suit', 'Watch', 'Troy', 'rant', 'knives', 'give', 'story', 'dramatic', 'bear', 'encounter', 'basically', 'bear', 'pushed', 'down', 'walked', 'away', 'hear', 'talk', 'Science', 'bear', 'suit', 'are', 'absurd', 'unbelievable', 'are', 'real', 'moments', 'could', 'not', 'look', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why', 'reason', 'end', 'even', 'respected', 'misguided', 'Troy', 'least', 'out', 'there', 'trying', 'make', 'own', 'legend.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'listening', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'directer', 'track', 'sheds', 'such', 'fascinating', 'light', 'character', 'end', 'realize', 'more', 'going', 'Troy', 'head', 'then', 'even']",Project Grizzly VHS

454260,AAOF195P95ZVC,6305198152,Ross E. Nelson,"[0, 3]","Many a long year ago I saw some TV show about a man building a bear-proof suit.  Scenes of a pickup ramming this guy wearing what looked like football armor on steroids was a hoot.  Naturally I had to watch this DVD.Turns out the inventor of the suit, Troy Hurtubise, didn't know when to stop.  Several of his earlier suits appeared to allow some mobility, but the final version (to date) is so heavy and clunky he can barely move in it and is turtle-helpless when he falls.  His scary one-time encounter with a bear that swatted him must have overwhelmed his practicality.It's an intriguing idea, a suit that allows the wearer to survive a grizzly-mauling.  It'd have pretty darn limited demand, I suppose, but bear watchers might feel more secure in one.  Treadwell (in ""Grizzly Man"") could have used one.  But the suited-up Hurtubise cannot walk on any kind of slope or rough surface when he takes to the north woods to, he hopes, encounter a grizzly, and sets the suit aside.  Thus there's no climax, only scenes of various previous tests and Hurtubise's own slightly goofy commentary. He should have paid a zoo to let him enter a grizzly cage.Hurtubise's robot-like suit is a failure, although it reminds me of my mind's image of what Heinlein's starship troopers' exoskeletal armor looked like.  Too bad the grizzly armor doesn't have a similar power source.  Like the suit, the documentary is mildly entertaining but ultimately incomplete.",3,Roboflop,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,1446,"['Many', 'long', 'year', 'saw', 'TV', 'show', 'man', 'building', 'bear-proof', 'suit', 'Scenes', 'pickup', 'ramming', 'guy', 'wearing', 'what', 'looked', 'football', 'armor', 'steroids', 'was', 'hoot', 'Naturally', 'had', 'watch', 'out', 'inventor', 'suit', 'Troy', 'Hurtubise', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'Several', 'earlier', 'suits', 'appeared', 'allow', 'mobility', 'final', 'version', 'date', 'so', 'heavy', 'clunky', 'can', 'barely', 'move', 'turtle-helpless', 'when', 'scary', 'one-time', 'encounter', 'bear', 'swatted', 'must', 'have', 'overwhelmed', 'practicality.It', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'suit', 'wearer', 'survive', 'grizzly-mauling', ""'d"", 'have', 'pretty', 'darn', 'limited', 'demand', 'suppose', 'bear', 'watchers', 'might', 'feel', 'more', 'secure', 'one', 'Treadwell', 'Grizzly', 'Man', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'one', 'suited-up', 'Hurtubise', 'can', 'not', 'walk', 'kind', 'slope', 'rough', 'surface', 'when', 'north', 'woods', 'encounter', 'grizzly', 'suit', 'aside', 'Thus', 'climax', 'only', 'scenes', 'various', 'previous', 'tests', 'Hurtubise', 'own', 'slightly', 'goofy', 'commentary', 'should', 'have', 'paid', 'zoo', 'let', 'enter', 'grizzly', 'cage.Hurtubise', 'robot-like', 'suit', 'failure', 'mind', 'image', 'what', 'Heinlein', 'starship', 'troopers', 'exoskeletal', 'armor', 'looked', 'Too', 'bad', 'grizzly', 'armor', ""n't"", 'have', 'similar', 'power', 'source', 'suit', 'documentary', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'ultimately', 'incomplete']",Project Grizzly VHS
