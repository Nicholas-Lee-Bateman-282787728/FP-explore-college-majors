688079,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005V9HY,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[14, 15]","""Extremities"" is almost like a filmed play, with a marvelous 4-person cast, and it keeps one's interest even though most of the action takes place in 2 rooms of a small house. This very low budget production may have many flaws, but it is at times riveting viewing. Farrah Fawcett followed her critically acclaimed ""The Burning Bed"" with this film, and once again proved that she was much more than a ""Charlie's Angels"" pin-up. Along with Fawcett, James Russo is Joe, a truly creepy villain, and Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid are both terrific as Fawcett's housemates. Woodard is one of Hollywood's most beautiful and underrated actresses, and gives yet another wonderful performance, and Scarwid is very moving as she tells her personal history, and how she dealt with a similar trauma.This is a character study of a depraved man who sets his mind on terrorizing a woman, first by assaulting her in a car, and then in a home invasion. The violence that ensues sometimes feels quite real, and the interest in the film lies mostly in the reactions by the 3 women affected by the psychological rape, and the fear of being killed by this monstrous man. It is a curious film about power and submission that doesn't always work, but the parts that do are excellent, and definitely worth watching.Written by William Mastrosimone based on his play, and directed by Robert M. Young, ""Extremities"" is 89 minutes long, is often intense, and has great interaction between its 4 fine actors.",4,A Character Study of Violence and Submission,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,1481,"['Extremities', 'almost', 'filmed', 'play', 'marvelous', '4-person', 'cast', 'one', 'interest', 'even', 'most', 'action', 'place', '2', 'rooms', 'small', 'house', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'may', 'have', 'many', 'flaws', 'times', 'riveting', 'viewing', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'followed', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'proved', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'pin-up', 'Fawcett', 'James', 'Russo', 'Joe', 'truly', 'creepy', 'villain', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'are', 'terrific', 'Fawcett', 'housemates', 'Woodard', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'beautiful', 'underrated', 'actresses', 'yet', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Scarwid', 'very', 'moving', 'personal', 'history', 'how', 'similar', 'trauma.This', 'character', 'study', 'depraved', 'man', 'who', 'mind', 'terrorizing', 'woman', 'first', 'assaulting', 'car', 'then', 'home', 'invasion', 'violence', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'quite', 'real', 'interest', 'film', 'mostly', 'reactions', '3', 'women', 'affected', 'psychological', 'rape', 'fear', 'being', 'killed', 'monstrous', 'man', 'curious', 'film', 'power', 'submission', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'parts', 'do', 'are', 'excellent', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching.Written', 'William', 'Mastrosimone', 'based', 'play', 'directed', 'Robert', 'M.', 'Young', 'Extremities', '89', 'minutes', 'long', 'often', 'intense', 'great', 'interaction', '4', 'fine', 'actors']",N/A

No I am not biased being a fan. Here she is stripped of ALL glamour and make up and performs from the gut. If Charlize Theron could win an Oscar for Monster then surely Farrah deserved to be recognized for this performance, a repeat of a role she took in the Off Broadway production. Extremeties is the story of a woman to exacts revenge on a would be rapist and traps him in her fireplace. Much of the first half of the movie focuses on the abuse that Marjorie (Fawcett) endures at the hands of the 'rapist' (brilliantly played by James Russo) before she turns the tables on him and 'captures' him. Excellent support is provided by Alfre Woodward and Diana Scarwid as the room mates who become embroiled in the saga of whether to kill the rapist or call the police.Its a tough and brutal film which is hard to watch at times. But, its Fawcett who drives this movie with a solid gut wrenching performance that the influential TIME MAGAZINE described in their REVIEW thus: "" her unadorned artistry singes"" High praise indeed.It would have been great if MGM could have added 'extras' to this dvd...where are the commentary tracks or deleted scenes?",5,"Tough, brutal film with Fawcett deserving of Award",1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,1280,"['What', 'going', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'recognise', 'artistry', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'give', 'accolades', 'awards', 'due', 'am', 'not', 'biased', 'being', 'fan', 'Here', 'stripped', 'ALL', 'glamour', 'make', 'up', 'performs', 'gut', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'could', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Monster', 'then', 'surely', 'Farrah', 'deserved', 'be', 'recognized', 'performance', 'repeat', 'role', 'took', 'Off', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Extremeties', 'story', 'woman', 'exacts', 'revenge', 'would', 'be', 'rapist', 'fireplace', 'Much', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'abuse', 'Marjorie', 'Fawcett', 'hands', ""'rapist"", 'brilliantly', 'played', 'James', 'Russo', 'tables', ""'captures"", 'Excellent', 'support', 'provided', 'Alfre', 'Woodward', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'room', 'mates', 'who', 'become', 'embroiled', 'saga', 'kill', 'rapist', 'call', 'police.Its', 'tough', 'brutal', 'film', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'Fawcett', 'who', 'movie', 'solid', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'performance', 'influential', 'TIME', 'MAGAZINE', 'described', 'REVIEW', 'thus', 'unadorned', 'artistry', 'singes', 'High', 'praise', 'indeed.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'MGM', 'could', 'have', 'added', ""'extras"", 'dvd', 'where', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A
688081,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B00005V9HY,Carlisle Wheeling,"[0, 0]","Though this film was released in 1986, I watched it on Netflix a few nights ago for the very first time.  Farrah Fawcett had definitely outdone herself in this role as Marjorie, a woman who escaped a rape attack by a truly disgusting individual who had a wife and child at home.  As if this isn't bad enough the first time, in her escape, the perpetrator (James Russo) ends up with her wallet and begins to stalk her and her roommates until he comes to their house for a second attempt.  Talk about guts.After a very long and agonizing attempt at trying to make Marjorie submissive by various devices of torture, most notably how he uses her personal effects to taint her connection with them, she turns the tables in a battle royale in which you can't help but root for her and her roommates who end up coming home to the destruction that's been done to the house and Marjorie's mental condition.  This woman is MAD, and she wants revenge after being brushed off lightly by the cops the first time she reported him.  To this I say, sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands, and she does so in a way that leaves you exhausted but satisfied.This is an amazingly powerful story about predators and their victims, and one nobody should miss seeing at least once.  I will say now that I have a new and healthy respect for having spray chemicals around the house, and that women are not always the hapless victims some men want them to be.  Great performances by an excellent cast, and a very well written screenplay.  5 stars for a movie that's well worth the 95 minutes it takes to sit through it, and for the enlifting, frightening, and powerful message it conveys.

I feel that alot of the movie was mostly Language and violence. This seems like a continuation of ""The Burning Bed"", but it's not. It's a story of morals, and questioning the ""Eye for an Eye"" issue. Alot of elements from the burning bed come into play here where men feel entitled to dominate women, and that society is still backwards in their thinking of how a woman is to respond to her attacker. As the other 2 women with Farrah are telling her not to torture the guy who attecked her. There's an element here where woman's rights are attempted to be spelled out, but the question is will a woman listen? A woman who is wracked with a violent crime against her if she chooses to fight back will do so to the fullest extent, and then some. However, what the one characted was trying, and I mean trying to say to Farrah was that God would repay the man who attacked her that he would face justice. However, it was said in a secular tone.

688086,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005V9HY,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Back in the 1970s network television began to explore then-controversial subjects that ranged from homosexuality to wife-beating.  One of the most memorable of these was 1974's A CASE OF RAPE, starring Elizabeth Montgomery as a woman who is twice raped by the same stalker and humiliated by the way the police respond when she reports the crime.  It was very, very bold for its time and received numerous accolades for bringing the taboo subject of rape to the public eye.  Eight years later playwright William Mastrosimone shocked off-Broadway audiences with the same subject in EXTREMITIES, which was similar in tone and which gave the female lead the opportunity to enact justice on her own.  The play attracted a number of noted performers, including Susan Sarandon and Farrah Fawcett, and was particularly famous for stage violence, so demanding that the stars were often seen with broken fingers and toes and bruises and slings.  In 1986, with a few tweaks here and there, the play became a film, starring Farrah Fawcett and James Russo, who had played together in the stage production.But although the story remains essentially the same, it lacks the immediacy of a live-in-your-face stage performance, and as a result it has a ""haven't we seen this before?"" quality.  And the answer is yes, we have, over and over, in everything from WAIT UNTIL DARK, in which a vulnerable blind woman defeats a series of attackers, to the aforementioned A CASE OF RAPE, in which a woman is not only raped but must fight the system for justice.  And that's the real problem with this film: it doesn't introduce any new lines of thought.  Both Fawcett and Russo are memorable in their roles, and Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid offer strong support, but EXTREMITIES always seems to remind you that it's only a movie, and that undercuts the intensity we expect.  It is well done, but I didn't really believe any of it.  Frankly, the 1974 A CASE OF RAPE was much more shocking than the 1986 EXTREMITIES could be because in 1974 the subject was still shocking.  These days rape isn't a word that is whispered behind cupped hands, and--sadly--most of know about the subject too well, not just from novels and plays and movies, but from personal experience.  Recommended for the performances, but don't expect too much.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Mild Screen Version of Intense Stage Play,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,2324,"['Back', '1970s', 'network', 'television', 'began', 'explore', 'then-controversial', 'subjects', 'ranged', 'homosexuality', 'wife-beating', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'was', '1974', 'CASE', 'OF', 'RAPE', 'starring', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'woman', 'who', 'twice', 'raped', 'same', 'stalker', 'humiliated', 'way', 'police', 'respond', 'when', 'crime', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'bold', 'time', 'received', 'numerous', 'accolades', 'bringing', 'taboo', 'subject', 'rape', 'public', 'eye', 'Eight', 'years', 'later', 'playwright', 'William', 'Mastrosimone', 'shocked', 'off-Broadway', 'audiences', 'same', 'subject', 'EXTREMITIES', 'was', 'similar', 'tone', 'gave', 'female', 'lead', 'opportunity', 'enact', 'justice', 'own', 'play', 'attracted', 'number', 'noted', 'performers', 'including', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'was', 'particularly', 'famous', 'stage', 'violence', 'so', 'demanding', 'stars', 'were', 'often', 'seen', 'broken', 'fingers', 'toes', 'bruises', 'slings', '1986', 'few', 'tweaks', 'here', 'there', 'play', 'became', 'film', 'starring', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'James', 'Russo', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'together', 'stage', 'production.But', 'story', 'essentially', 'same', 'immediacy', 'live-in-your-face', 'stage', 'performance', 'result', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'quality', 'answer', 'yes', 'have', 'over', 'everything', 'WAIT', 'UNTIL', 'DARK', 'vulnerable', 'blind', 'woman', 'series', 'attackers', 'aforementioned', 'A', 'CASE', 'OF', 'RAPE', 'woman', 'not', 'only', 'raped', 'must', 'fight', 'system', 'justice', 'real', 'problem', 'film', ""n't"", 'introduce', 'new', 'lines', 'thought', 'Fawcett', 'Russo', 'are', 'memorable', 'roles', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'offer', 'strong', 'support', 'EXTREMITIES', 'always', 'remind', 'only', 'movie', 'intensity', 'expect', 'well', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'Frankly', '1974', 'A', 'CASE', 'OF', 'RAPE', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'shocking', '1986', 'EXTREMITIES', 'could', 'be', 'because', '1974', 'subject', 'was', 'still', 'shocking', 'days', 'rape', ""n't"", 'word', 'whispered', 'cupped', 'hands', 'sadly', 'most', 'know', 'subject', 'too', 'well', 'not', 'just', 'novels', 'plays', 'movies', 'personal', 'experience', 'Recommended', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Johnson""","[2, 2]","When I first saw this movie 22 years ago, I was very young and didn't appreciate the acting in what will be a classic. Now, older and wiser, I can say this is a damn good movie to have in your dvd and a must for your Farrah Fawcett collection. However, Farrah is not the only great actor or actress in this movie. The supporting cast balanced to Farrah's great acting. One wonders how she went from her silly sexy roles from Sunburn, Somebody Killed Her Husband, and Saturn 3 to become an excellent actress in this movie and later others. Unfortunately, Farrah never was given a serious Oscar main role in the movies, like Marilyn Monroe, Farrah reverted back being a sex symbol, when she an excellent actress. Farrah plays Marjorie, who is almost raped once to be denied protection by the police and followed by the rapist to her home. James Russo makes an excellent psycho villian in this role. Also, Diana Scarwid, (Christina, ""Mommie Dearest"") and Alfre Woodard, (Desparate Housewives) provide an excellent supporting cast as Marjorie's roommates. The acting is above average here. As we all know, the tables are turned from rape victim to rapist and Marjorie seeks justice and safety. The late Farrah Fawcett uses this movie to educate and inform viewers about the injustice rights of raped victims. As, unfortunately, she will later on use her own real life to educate viewers about facts and the injustice of not finding cures for cancer patients. Farrah will be go on enternal.

Another reviewer wrote, ""she's much sexier in anything other than this video."" Both were right. ""Extremities"" was an R-rated movie, and Farrah, while not in the buff, was sexy as hell (she was thirty-nine when it was filmed, while ""All of Me"" marked her fiftieth birthday). Better yet, her strong and believable performance made ""Extremities"" a surprisingly good thriller.

I read a lot of reviews on this one and thought it might be yet another academy award winner, but I simply do not see what all the fuss is about.  This film actually appears 'staged' and lacks the natural reality that 'The Burning Bed' portrays.  To me there is no comparison between the two and 'The Burning Bed' is a much better film.  I really don't know why this film was so hyped up, other than Hollywood hoping to gain some real bogus brownie points and more sales revenue.  Truly, if you want to see a great film, go with 'The Burning Bed'.  I know it's hard to get at a reasonable price on DVD, which is another retail getcha to justify the outrageous price on that version, but if nothing else rent it.  You will clearly see that these two films are as different as apples and oranges.  One is very good, and the other is just another movie.  I don't feel Fawcett's performance had anything to do with it, but I do feel supporting actors lacked and directorial abilities were by far inferior.  Again, that is my opinion only, and others may feel differently, but I very likely won't watch this film again, and I do feel the hype was way more than what this film justified.",4,"Not nearly as great as ""The Burning Bed"".",1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,1309,"['have', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'feel', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'great', 'actress', 'sexuality', 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'one', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'yet', 'academy', 'award', 'winner', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'about', 'film', 'actually', ""'staged"", 'natural', 'reality', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'portrays', 'comparison', 'two', ""'The"", 'Burning', 'Bed', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'hyped', 'up', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'hoping', 'gain', 'real', 'bogus', 'brownie', 'points', 'more', 'sales', 'revenue', 'Truly', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'go', ""'The"", 'Burning', 'Bed', 'know', 'hard', 'get', 'reasonable', 'price', 'DVD', 'retail', 'getcha', 'justify', 'outrageous', 'price', 'version', 'nothing', 'else', 'rent', 'will', 'clearly', 'see', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'apples', 'oranges', 'One', 'very', 'good', 'other', 'just', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Fawcett', 'performance', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'do', 'feel', 'supporting', 'actors', 'lacked', 'directorial', 'abilities', 'were', 'far', 'inferior', 'Again', 'opinion', 'only', 'others', 'may', 'feel', 'differently', 'very', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'do', 'feel', 'hype', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'what', 'film', 'justified']",N/A
