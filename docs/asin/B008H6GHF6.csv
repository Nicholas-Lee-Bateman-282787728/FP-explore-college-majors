1553277,A3A4IFAFACLCVL,B008H6GHF6,DanAMA MCLE,"[2, 3]","-Rescue Me: The Complete Series-Let me be very clear here - yes, the package that holds the set is sub-par...BUT, for the price you're paying for this complete set (my pre-Christmas 2012 price was under $32), people really should stop with their antics.This set: You get all 26 DVD discs that would come if one purchased all of the individual season sets.  The shows on these DVD's are anamorphic widescreen - they will show as widescreen on DVD players that are capable of handling this format (which should include even the cheapest models) on any widescreen TV.  I do own an older DVD player which does not handle the anamorphic format, and on that the show displays in letterbox format.  They have english closed-captioning which is switchable through your DVD player's settings (not on the discs themselves.)  The discs have all of the content that you would expect on the individual season sets - featurettes, gag reels, etc.There's nothing fancy here.  The only insert is a single page overlay that numbers the individual episode names for each season.  The box butterflies to expose the two spindles of DVD's.  The twin spindles hold the DVD's securely, with cardboard packaging inserts to hold each stack down.  That's it!In my opinion, any price under $75 would make this a worthwhile purchase.  As others have complained about, you might hope for better packaging - but I look at it as I'm getting everything that matters for a small percentage of the price of purchasing the individual season sets.  For all that money that I've just saved, I'll purchase aftermarket cases for my DVD's and still get to enjoy everything I loved about this great series...all of the extra content is just the cherry on top!If you loved the series, you'll love this set.  Buy it and ENJOY!

As many of you know Denis Leary and co-creator Peter Tolan decided to end this series when it was still on top. From the very beginning episode to finale you will enjoy this story.  To put it aside.  The fire fighting scenes are completely realistic, well filmed and gives you some idea of what real Firefighters deal with everyday.  The story line is great, of coarse featuring Denis Leary as Tommy Gavin.  Tommy is a raging alcholic dealing with demons from 9/11 and the overall stress and fears related to his job as a NY firefighter.  It that's not enough his personal life is a mess.  With a demanding wife, needy kids, mistresses and one-night stands.  Which half of the time just creates even more reasons for him to drink.  His entire family is as about dysfunctional, chemical dependent as he his.  There are only a few things Tommy lives for.  Fighting fires, drinking and sex.  He tries to change his life several times, just to be beaten down by some tradgedy or just about anything that makes it for a good excuse to drink. His firefighter co-workers knows he is a drunk.  They want to work with the guy because he's like teflon when it comes to fighting fires.  Some of my favorite scenes are of the guys in his crew busting each others ba--s! Funny timely stuff. I own all 7 seasons already and plan on buying this complete set and giving the single seasons to my parents who just love this show and miss it.  I would give this a 10++ in entertainment value and it has made me a big fan of Denis Leary and firefighters in general.  You can catch some of this on NetFlix first.
