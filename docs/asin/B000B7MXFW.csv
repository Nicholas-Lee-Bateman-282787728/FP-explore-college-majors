Our household is 'older' and we avoid the gratuitous violence, sex. horror and foul language that seems to make up so much of today's offerings.  This droll look at two men who only wanted 'to matter and make a difference' was a surprising breath of fresh air and have recommended it to our extended family.  Other reviewers have mentioned difficulty in understanding the accents, but as we frequently enjoy British productions we had no problem.

It was a belly buster for me, really funny, they they bungled across occupied France, and did a bunch of damage.  The wanted to fight but belonged to the medical corp.  They did a great job of character development, but I cannot believe these two people were that stupid.  They crossed the English Channel in a borrowed boat.Looking up the Sergeant, I cannot believe he was that old or that stupid, In reality he  went through Ranger training and ended up a Major. The script writer added his imagination upon a true story and added some color in the characters.

I rented this film, and in that short period of time, I watched it twice, and then when it was erased from my Kindle I felt such a loss that I bought  it so I can watch it again and again and again.I was also curious to know if this really happened.  And as incredible as it seems, the two characters in this film (Private Lesley Cuthbertson and Sargeant Peter King) really existed, and apparently they really did ""invade"" France in 1942.  And they really did escape being captured and they really did cross back  to England.  They were both court martialled so there has to be a written record of this somewhere to prove that it happend, and if it had been up to me, I would have given them both some kind of medal for giving the British a small victory at a time when there were very few British victories... even if this was absolutely crazy, crazy, crazy....Much of the charm of this film is due to the songs and newsreel clips which give us a feeling of those bad old days.  The dialogue, I suppose, is the writer's imagination but it is very , very funny.  Just imagine one old and brave but very crazy sargent leading another crazy but very young private, and both of them are impatient to go to war against Hitler... and so, they did.... that is what they did, they invaded France in order to fight the war.There is also a young girl in England, who is attracted to the young boy, and another young girl in France who is also attracted to the young boy... which make the situation even funnier....The ending is heartwarming, when these two crazy soldiers get punished for being A.W.O.L. but also applauded for their crazy adventure where they actually helped the cause and lived to tell about it... in jail, but not for long, and not too harshly, I presume.Don't miss it.  This is one in a million.  I really loved it.  Exceptionally funny, and based on a true incident of the Second World War.",5,"Absolutely British, absolutely funny, and absolutely a great (based on a true) story",1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,1955,"['are', 'not', 'many', 'movies', 'want', 'see', 'twice', 'rented', 'film', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'watched', 'twice', 'then', 'when', 'was', 'erased', 'Kindle', 'felt', 'loss', 'bought', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'again.I', 'was', 'also', 'curious', 'know', 'really', 'happened', 'as', 'incredible', 'two', 'characters', 'film', 'Private', 'Lesley', 'Cuthbertson', 'Sargeant', 'Peter', 'King', 'really', 'existed', 'apparently', 'really', 'did', 'invade', 'France', '1942', 'really', 'did', 'escape', 'being', 'captured', 'really', 'did', 'cross', 'back', 'England', 'were', 'court', 'martialled', 'so', 'there', 'be', 'written', 'record', 'somewhere', 'prove', 'happend', 'had', 'been', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'kind', 'medal', 'giving', 'British', 'small', 'victory', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'British', 'victories', 'even', 'was', 'absolutely', 'crazy', 'crazy', 'crazy', '.Much', 'charm', 'film', 'due', 'songs', 'newsreel', 'clips', 'give', 'feeling', 'bad', 'old', 'days', 'dialogue', 'suppose', 'writer', 'imagination', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'Just', 'imagine', 'one', 'old', 'brave', 'very', 'crazy', 'sargent', 'leading', 'crazy', 'very', 'young', 'private', 'are', 'impatient', 'go', 'war', 'Hitler', 'so', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'invaded', 'France', 'order', 'fight', 'war.There', 'also', 'young', 'girl', 'England', 'who', 'attracted', 'young', 'boy', 'young', 'girl', 'France', 'who', 'also', 'attracted', 'young', 'boy', 'make', 'situation', 'even', 'funnier', '.The', 'ending', 'heartwarming', 'when', 'two', 'crazy', 'soldiers', 'get', 'punished', 'being', 'A.W.O.L', 'also', 'applauded', 'crazy', 'adventure', 'where', 'actually', 'helped', 'cause', 'lived', 'tell', 'jail', 'not', 'long', 'not', 'too', 'harshly', 'presume.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'million', 'really', 'loved', 'Exceptionally', 'funny', 'based', 'true', 'incident', 'Second', 'World', 'War']",Two Men Went To War
