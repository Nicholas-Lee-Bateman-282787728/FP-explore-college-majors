1236584,A1ARPLFACHIK7Y,B001TK80FC,"apriles78 ""aes78""","[4, 6]","This DVD focuses more on Egyptian bellydance than on other forms. The set was nice and the costuming quite good. The sound quality was excellent ... there was none of that distracting exterior noise, such as passing traffic and sirens, that I've heard on other bellydance DVDs. I thought the section on arms was helpful, as was the section on hip circles. For a beginner, those sections would work well, I believe. Also, Leila's reminders to take it easy and not to strain were very useful. But two main issues detracted from the instruction: (1) Leila went on too long about what not to do, instead of focusing on what to do and showing it properly done and (2) she had a habit of saying ""Yeah"" all the time, which, after about 20 minutes, really made her hard to listen to.I do not see how anyone could possibly get much value from watching the DVD more than once, as it was not geared to help you practice the moves, but consisted mostly of Leila talking. There really should have been a drill section in which the steps were repeated without Leila interrupting herself with examples of what ""not"" to do. In addition, the section in which you normally can view and learn choreographed dances was nothing but improvisations. I certainly don't need to see the instructor improvise. I need to see her provide choreography I can follow. If I want to improvise, I'll do it myself. That's the whole purpose of improvisation, actually.On top of all this the video editors were too eager to make cuts that detracted from the video and made it hard for a viewer to follow Leila's movements. In one improvised dance, the video editing actually made her dancing look distorted, proving that just because editing software offers an effect doesn't mean someone should use it. As for the performance section, every time I thought I could see what was going on, the video would cut to another view, then cut again. That's not good instruction.This is the only DVD of Leila's that I've purchased, and it could very well be the last. It's a shame that with such a professional set there was not a more professional approach, and that includes video editing.",3,Needs choreography,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,2143,"['DVD', 'more', 'Egyptian', 'bellydance', 'other', 'forms', 'set', 'was', 'nice', 'costuming', 'quite', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'none', 'distracting', 'exterior', 'noise', 'such', 'passing', 'traffic', 'sirens', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'other', 'bellydance', 'DVDs', 'thought', 'section', 'arms', 'was', 'helpful', 'was', 'section', 'hip', 'circles', 'beginner', 'sections', 'would', 'work', 'well', 'believe', 'Also', 'Leila', 'reminders', 'take', 'easy', 'not', 'strain', 'were', 'very', 'useful', 'two', 'main', 'issues', 'detracted', 'instruction', '1', 'Leila', 'went', 'too', 'long', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'instead', 'focusing', 'what', 'do', 'showing', 'properly', 'done', '2', 'had', 'habit', 'saying', 'Yeah', 'time', '20', 'minutes', 'really', 'made', 'hard', 'listen', 'to.I', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'possibly', 'get', 'much', 'value', 'watching', 'DVD', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'not', 'geared', 'help', 'practice', 'moves', 'consisted', 'mostly', 'Leila', 'talking', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'drill', 'section', 'steps', 'were', 'repeated', 'Leila', 'interrupting', 'examples', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'addition', 'section', 'normally', 'can', 'view', 'learn', 'choreographed', 'dances', 'was', 'nothing', 'improvisations', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'instructor', 'improvise', 'need', 'see', 'provide', 'choreography', 'can', 'follow', 'want', 'improvise', ""'ll"", 'do', 'whole', 'purpose', 'improvisation', 'actually.On', 'top', 'video', 'editors', 'were', 'too', 'eager', 'make', 'cuts', 'detracted', 'video', 'made', 'hard', 'viewer', 'follow', 'Leila', 'movements', 'one', 'improvised', 'dance', 'video', 'editing', 'actually', 'made', 'dancing', 'look', 'distorted', 'proving', 'just', 'editing', 'software', 'effect', ""n't"", 'mean', 'someone', 'should', 'use', 'performance', 'section', 'time', 'thought', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'video', 'would', 'cut', 'view', 'then', 'cut', 'again', 'not', 'good', 'instruction.This', 'only', 'DVD', 'Leila', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'last', 'shame', 'professional', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'more', 'professional', 'approach', 'video', 'editing']",Belly Dance For Beginners

There is plenty of practise for each move.  I followed all the beginner practises easily.  When I got to the moving practises I had trouble with this, did them but struggled, which is good, so when I improve can come back to it (I think it takes time to learn and integrate the movements into muscle memory).  Haven't done the dances with no instruction yet, but they look really good and will when my basic skills improve.  Her peformance I thought was like watching someone in a restaurant dance, avoiding obstacles, it didn't seem to flow, it was like she was distracted and her costume was a little bit gaudy.  But she is very beautiful and has a nice voice and I felt uplifted by her positivity.  The menu is very slow, it fades in slowly so you have to wait when you want to click onto something, I just had a little rest while waiting.  There is no stretching or official warm-up.

1236592,A2W8EF4E3ZP3DC,B001TK80FC,Delos,"[1, 1]","In short - This would be great if you are looking to learn the basics to really learn and master this as a dance style, and don't have classes for personal instruction near you. This would not be a great choice if you have about 30 minutes and want a quick workout video with some variety to just pop in for some tone up (I'd recommend something more likeBellydance Fitness for Beginners: Slim Downif that's what you're looking for)In more detail - Did you ever learn a musical instrument as a kid? Remember how you had to go through hours and days of scales before you could play one song decently? This is similar. You'll really be working the basics, which is necessary to do the intermediate or advanced routines correctly. Like many other dance styles, it is deceptively simple-looking when you see someone perform it well.This is a good way to focus on and learn how to perform those basics correctly, rather than just launching basic routines and skipping some of the foundations like some belly dance workout videos may do. If you're going to cheat some of the finer points then it probably will seem overly simple to you (I'm thinking mainly of a correct shimmy, or traveling shimmy move, here.) It's harder than it seems, to do correctly, when she really breaks it down for you, but being able to do some of these moves correctly (subtly) and without tension are the main component of what gives an overall dance performance that riveting fluidity.As others have mentioned, this is not set up as a continuous flow through the chapters of a DVD; there are menus and submenus and short introductions to work your way through. But - this is ideal if you returning, or do have some basics down already, seeking a refresher, and/or just want to target certain moves - as you'll quickly be able to determine what parts you don't need, and skip to the chapter you want to play.",4,More instructional than a quick workout video,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,1880,"['short', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'are', 'looking', 'learn', 'basics', 'really', 'learn', 'master', 'dance', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'classes', 'personal', 'instruction', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'choice', 'have', '30', 'minutes', 'want', 'quick', 'workout', 'video', 'variety', 'just', 'pop', 'tone', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'something', 'more', 'likeBellydance', 'Fitness', 'Beginners', 'Slim', 'Downif', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'detail', 'Did', 'ever', 'learn', 'musical', 'instrument', 'kid', 'Remember', 'how', 'had', 'go', 'hours', 'days', 'scales', 'could', 'play', 'one', 'song', 'decently', 'similar', ""'ll"", 'really', 'be', 'working', 'basics', 'necessary', 'do', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'routines', 'correctly', 'many', 'other', 'dance', 'styles', 'deceptively', 'simple-looking', 'when', 'see', 'someone', 'perform', 'good', 'way', 'focus', 'learn', 'how', 'perform', 'basics', 'correctly', 'rather', 'just', 'launching', 'basic', 'routines', 'skipping', 'foundations', 'belly', 'dance', 'videos', 'may', 'do', ""'re"", 'going', 'cheat', 'finer', 'points', 'then', 'probably', 'will', 'seem', 'overly', 'simple', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'mainly', 'correct', 'shimmy', 'traveling', 'shimmy', 'move', 'here', 'harder', 'do', 'correctly', 'when', 'really', 'down', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'moves', 'correctly', 'subtly', 'tension', 'are', 'main', 'component', 'what', 'overall', 'dance', 'performance', 'riveting', 'fluidity.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'not', 'set', 'up', 'continuous', 'flow', 'chapters', 'DVD', 'are', 'menus', 'submenus', 'short', 'introductions', 'work', 'way', 'ideal', 'returning', 'do', 'have', 'basics', 'down', 'already', 'seeking', 'refresher', 'and/or', 'just', 'want', 'target', 'certain', 'moves', ""'ll"", 'quickly', 'be', 'able', 'determine', 'what', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'skip', 'chapter', 'want', 'play']",Belly Dance For Beginners

I have tried just about every other form of therapy per my doctors that are out there now and none of them have stuck.  I have had 5 Belly Dancing classes so far at a school here in town, the Disability company I work with for Insurance even agrees with using the dance as therapy, and so far I am doing far better than any other therapies I have tried.  Though due to my disabilities I was still lagging behind.  My Instructor advised me to purchase a video and to make sure it had good reviews and plenty of steps and was for beginners ONLY.  I found this one and just in one session with the DVD when I went back to class she and I both noticed a big difference.  I would highly recommend this video.

I've always been interested in Belly Dance, and used Belly Dance videos before, majority of them are pretty bad.Some of the ones I have are so bad I couldn't even call it Belly dance, just a lot of shaking. This DVD is nothing like that, she actually teaches real Egyptian belly dance! And it's great because I adore the Egyptian style style! The arms section is amazing, she goes slow and repeats each momment over and over. This is the only Belly dance DVD I have that actually teaches you how to do the movemens instead of just following along. Also Leila is so much fun and has a great personalty. She explains what your posture should be like and warns you of when something is hard on a certain body part. I like also how she keeps reminding you to take it easy and be relaxed. She is also a lot of fun. I did 40 minutes of the DVD and I had no idea that much time went by because I was having so much fun.I think this DVD though can only be used by begginers if you aren't a novice at Belly Dance you might be bored with it, but since I'm very new to it I don't find it boring at all. Although I didn't attempt the following along dance routine yet I did watch them and they seemed really fun, I hope I can learn fast so I can attempt them :D If you are looking for a cardio workout this really isn't for you, but I do have to say that I felt a lot of my muscles working.

So far, I have gotten the most use out of Sadie's Complete Belly Dance Guide and Hard Candy. I think this DVD is very informative. I especially like the instructor, who is very laid-back and conversational. She makes you feel like you're hanging out with her, gently drilling basic belly dance moves. The DVD is approx. 4 hours in length, which gives a beginner-level dancer plenty to work with. The first section comprises of individual movements, the second section covers how to layer those moves over footwork, and the third section offers several dances to follow along to that are based on mood. The dances are not broken down because, as Leila explains in the DVD, traditional Middle Eastern dance is learned by observation and not a technical step-by-step breakdown.What I liked about this DVD: The Instructor, Leila, is amazing. She has a warm, friendly personality, she is pleasant to look at, and she offers loads of information. Her segment on arm patterns/movements is AWESOME. The drills in this DVD are gentle and low-impact, but still give you a decent amount of exercise. In each segment, Leila gives you plenty of time to master the moves; she does not breeze through the explanation, breakdown, and drilling of any of the movements. NOTE: This DVD is great for people who are serious about learning how to belly dance. People who are looking for a fun belly dance workout  that gets them dancing immediately are probably better suited for Neon's DVDs (even though people would get more from the workout if they have a preexisting knowledge of the basic belly dance moves, in my opinion.) Belly Dance for Beginners isn't necessarily the kind of DVD you should expect a traditional workout from, due to its length and its relatively slow pace.What I don't like about this DVD: Every time a section ends, instead of moving on to the next one, it will go back to the main menu. This makes it difficult to really get into the flow of dance practice, for me at least.All in all, I think this is a great resource of information for beginner-level belly dancers, especially those wanting to learn in the Egyptian style. This DVD fits well in my collection because Leila covers moves that are not covered in my other belly dance instructional videos, such as arm movements/patterns and the large, sweeping hip circles. Also, she extensively covers shimmies, how to move with shimmies, etc. I have not yet danced to the choreographed dances, but I have watched all of them; they cover everything in the DVD, there are no surprises.",5,A geat source of information for beginner-level belly dancers,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,2673,"['addition', 'DVD', 'own', 'Amira', 'Belly', 'Dance', '101', 'Sadie', 'Complete', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Guide', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Workout', 'So', 'far', 'have', 'gotten', 'most', 'use', 'Sadie', 'Complete', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Guide', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'think', 'DVD', 'very', 'informative', 'especially', 'instructor', 'who', 'very', 'laid-back', 'conversational', 'feel', ""'re"", 'hanging', 'out', 'gently', 'drilling', 'basic', 'belly', 'dance', 'moves', 'DVD', 'approx', '4', 'hours', 'length', 'beginner-level', 'dancer', 'plenty', 'work', 'first', 'section', 'comprises', 'individual', 'movements', 'second', 'section', 'how', 'layer', 'moves', 'footwork', 'third', 'section', 'several', 'dances', 'follow', 'along', 'are', 'based', 'mood', 'dances', 'are', 'not', 'broken', 'down', 'because', 'Leila', 'DVD', 'traditional', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'dance', 'learned', 'observation', 'not', 'technical', 'step-by-step', 'liked', 'DVD', 'Instructor', 'Leila', 'amazing', 'warm', 'friendly', 'personality', 'pleasant', 'look', 'loads', 'information', 'segment', 'arm', 'patterns/movements', 'AWESOME', 'drills', 'DVD', 'are', 'gentle', 'low-impact', 'still', 'give', 'decent', 'amount', 'exercise', 'segment', 'Leila', 'plenty', 'time', 'master', 'moves', 'not', 'breeze', 'explanation', 'breakdown', 'drilling', 'movements', 'NOTE', 'DVD', 'great', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'serious', 'learning', 'how', 'belly', 'dance', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'fun', 'belly', 'dance', 'workout', 'dancing', 'immediately', 'are', 'probably', 'better', 'suited', 'Neon', 'DVDs', 'even', 'people', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'workout', 'have', 'preexisting', 'knowledge', 'basic', 'belly', 'dance', 'moves', 'opinion', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Beginners', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'kind', 'DVD', 'should', 'expect', 'traditional', 'workout', 'due', 'length', 'relatively', 'slow', 'pace.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', 'time', 'section', 'instead', 'moving', 'next', 'one', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'difficult', 'really', 'get', 'flow', 'dance', 'practice', 'least.All', 'think', 'great', 'resource', 'information', 'beginner-level', 'belly', 'dancers', 'especially', 'wanting', 'learn', 'Egyptian', 'style', 'DVD', 'well', 'collection', 'Leila', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'covered', 'other', 'belly', 'dance', 'instructional', 'videos', 'such', 'arm', 'movements/patterns', 'large', 'sweeping', 'hip', 'circles', 'Also', 'extensively', 'shimmies', 'how', 'move', 'shimmies', 'etc', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'danced', 'choreographed', 'dances', 'have', 'watched', 'cover', 'everything', 'DVD', 'are', 'surprises']",Belly Dance For Beginners
