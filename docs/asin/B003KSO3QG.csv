1348100,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B003KSO3QG,Byron Kolln,"[24, 25]","All seven seasons of SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH are included in this bundle pack.  I won't go into an in-depth analysis of each season (I have reviewed most seasons individually so you can check those out at your leisure), but needless to say if you've yet to buy this show, this is the probably the best one-click way to do so.Melissa Joan Hart's infectious screen persona and charm elevates this sweet little sitcom far beyond anything you'd expect from a series that circles around the day-to-day life of a teenage witch and all the baggage that goes along with it.  Based loosely on the Archie Comics franchise (with a slight nod to ""Bewitched""), SABRINA...  effortlessly mixed teen angst and magical mayhem.  The early seasons in particular were marked by clever writing and snappy dialogue.  Only when Sabrina moved to college in the fifth season did the well start to run dry.The best years of SABRINA, in my opinion, were Seasons Two and Three.  In addition to the imaginative story arcs (Sabrina studying for her Witches' License and tracking down the oft-fabled Family Secret), there's also the unique chemistry which Ms Hart shared with her co-star Lindsay Sloane, who plays Sabrina's best friend Valerie.  ""Friend"" characters in SABRINA didn't tend to last all that long (and got written out with very little fanfare or explanation - Jenny from Season One for example) but Valerie was the best of the bunch.  Jenna Leigh Green, playing Sabrina's snotty arch-rival Libby for the first three seasons, was another highlight.Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick are Sabrina's wacky aunts Hilda and Zelda; Nick Bakay is the voice of scheming feline Salem.  Nate Richert is dreamy boyfriend Harvey; and ""Punky Brewster"" herself--Soleil Moon Frye--is introduced as Roxie in the college years.A wise buy for those who've waited for the full series.",5,witchy fun with Melissa Joan Hart!,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,1848,"['seven', 'seasons', 'SABRINA', 'THE', 'TEENAGE', 'WITCH', 'are', 'included', 'bundle', 'pack', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'season', 'have', 'reviewed', 'most', 'seasons', 'individually', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'leisure', 'needless', 'say', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'buy', 'show', 'probably', 'best', 'one-click', 'way', 'do', 'so.Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'infectious', 'screen', 'persona', 'charm', 'sweet', 'little', 'sitcom', 'far', 'anything', ""'d"", 'expect', 'series', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'teenage', 'witch', 'baggage', 'along', 'Based', 'loosely', 'Archie', 'Comics', 'franchise', 'slight', 'nod', 'Bewitched', 'SABRINA', 'effortlessly', 'mixed', 'teen', 'angst', 'magical', 'mayhem', 'early', 'seasons', 'particular', 'were', 'marked', 'clever', 'writing', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'Only', 'when', 'Sabrina', 'moved', 'college', 'fifth', 'season', 'did', 'well', 'start', 'run', 'dry.The', 'best', 'years', 'SABRINA', 'opinion', 'were', 'Seasons', 'Two', 'Three', 'addition', 'imaginative', 'story', 'arcs', 'Sabrina', 'studying', 'Witches', 'License', 'tracking', 'down', 'oft-fabled', 'Family', 'Secret', 'also', 'unique', 'chemistry', 'Ms', 'Hart', 'shared', 'co-star', 'Lindsay', 'Sloane', 'who', 'Sabrina', 'best', 'friend', 'Valerie', 'Friend', 'characters', 'SABRINA', 'did', ""n't"", 'tend', 'last', 'long', 'got', 'written', 'out', 'very', 'little', 'fanfare', 'explanation', 'Jenny', 'Season', 'One', 'example', 'Valerie', 'was', 'best', 'bunch', 'Jenna', 'Leigh', 'Green', 'playing', 'Sabrina', 'snotty', 'arch-rival', 'Libby', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'was', 'highlight.Caroline', 'Rhea', 'Beth', 'Broderick', 'are', 'Sabrina', 'wacky', 'aunts', 'Hilda', 'Zelda', 'Nick', 'Bakay', 'voice', 'scheming', 'feline', 'Salem', 'Nate', 'Richert', 'dreamy', 'boyfriend', 'Harvey', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'herself', 'Soleil', 'Moon', 'Frye', 'introduced', 'Roxie', 'college', 'years.A', 'wise', 'buy', 'who', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'full', 'series']",N/A

I think this is a great show. I honestly remember watching it back on ABC TGIF line-up. So glad I got this when this set was on sale. This show is really funny. It also got me to love black kitty's because of Salem. The only things I didn't like of course was when they replaced Jenny with Valerie (who I found to be super annoying), and Sabrina's aunts MIA in Season 7. I felt they should have been in that season besides the brief cameo at the finale where Aunt Zelda appeared as a candle. Speaking of the finale, the biggest crush to me was that they replaced No Doubt's 'Running' with some stupid song. 'Running' was the perfect song to use. I can't believe they didn't get the copyrights to release that with the DVDs. Overall a great show, and a show that is perfect for the whole family. So happy to add this to my collection.

This series was perfect for that kind of evening or weekend. I enjoyed it very much and liked the more wholesome approach that was taken in regards to Sabrina's teenage crushes and dramas. It is nice not to have to watch teens destroying their lives with drugs and indiscrininate sexual exploits. I get really tired of seeing everybodies multiple peircings and tattoos and pregnancies or the 'oopsies' of bad abortions. In fact I get tired of the need for abortions.
