Unfortunately, by the time the episode aired, the tales are old stories. I've read about it many times over the years, and I am not surprised or shocked anymore. However, it was nice to see Bernie Kosar and Andre Rison again on the show; they were pretty good players back in their heyday. I really would have liked to see more and more former athletes participating in the show, just to spice it up. Notice that in the end of the episode there is a reel of names that have gone broke. I am like, ""Really? That's it?"" It should have been 30 minutes long of names. All in all, 30 for 30: Broke is entertaining but needs more substance.",4,Captivating But Needs More Substance and Variety.,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,840,"['Viewed', '7/13Rate', '4/57/13', '30', '30', 'Broke', 'captivating', 'watch', 'how', 'most', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'athletes', 'who', 'made', 'ungodly', 'amount', 'money', 'end', 'up', 'bankrupt', 'several', 'years', 'retirement', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'episode', 'aired', 'tales', 'are', 'old', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'anymore', 'However', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Bernie', 'Kosar', 'Andre', 'Rison', 'again', 'show', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'players', 'back', 'heyday', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'former', 'athletes', 'participating', 'show', 'just', 'spice', 'up', 'Notice', 'end', 'episode', 'reel', 'names', 'have', 'gone', 'broke', 'am', 'Really', 'should', 'have', 'been', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'names', '30', '30', 'Broke', 'entertaining', 'more', 'substance']",N/A

First of all, you never give anyone TOTAL control over ALL of your money.  If you grew up poor, wouldn't common sense tell you to put a small amount away every payday, if you suddenly become rich? That same common sense should tell you that every house will have yearly taxes and monthly costs. That same common sense should tell you put the government's money( big chunk of your money) away every payday. If none of your relatives were great profit making business people before your big paydays , what makes you think they will become geniuses on Wall Street after your big paydays? C'mon. Most of these people did silly things. It was interesting  and informative to see how the mighty fell.  I would never invest, until, at a minimum. I learned about investments, spreadsheets, stocks, and every place  my money would be going. That means classes. No time? Then don't invest. I am not talking about your cousin Willie taking classes for you. I wonder why none of these people sought advice from other athletes who are successful investors? Ego. Bad adbice? Crooked money mongers? Probably a little of all three. Those on this documentary will help others, but there will still be those who get that first taste of riches and splurge,show off, reward themselves with unwise purchases and investments, then wonder where it all went. I am not talking about not enjoying the fruits of your labor, but if you spend  over one hundred thousand in one month, as one former athlete said he did, and not know where it went, then you are enjoying your fruits in the wrong way.This is a perfect dvd for  athletes and non athletes alike. This problem is not unique to athletes. But that ""one day poor/the next day rich"" does not happen in any other field like it does in sports. Egotistical, poor and immature decisions was the theme of most everyone on this dvd. Of course there were other factors, like divorces.This dvd held my interest from beginning to end. I don't think most viewers will empathetic. In fact,most will probably be jealous and want the opportunity. Some on the dvd, like Michael Vick, has gotten a second chance. Most of the rest will not.

More than 30 years before this documentary was put together, while he was doing color commentary for ABC's Baseball Game of the Week, I remember hearing Major League Baseball Hall-of-Famer Reggie Jackson say, &#34;By the time a young athlete learns how to properly invest his money  --he doesn't have any.&#34;I don't know if it's true, but someone said Shaquille Oneal, in giving his philosophy on safe-guarding his earnings said, &#34;pay all your taxes and put the rest in the bank.&#34;  Simple but sound advice.  It seems some of the former professional athletes featured in this documentary had the twisted and self-destructive notion that wasting and throwing money away improved self esteem and self worth.  It's too bad most of the people around them in their &#34;Hey Day&#34; were leeches, takers, gold diggers, and yes men.  And since most of them attended those Division-One colleges and universities because of the top-notch multi-million dollar athletic programs, NCAA championship tournaments, or nationally-televised Bowl games, getting an education was secondary  -if not passed up and ignored altogether.  So after their &#34;15 minutes&#34; of well-paid fame in the spotlight as a sports celebrity is gone, they have virtually nothing to fall back on.

1597793,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B009L9LC4E,Patrick L. Randall,"[3, 4]","ESPN's 30 for 30 series continues to be one of the best documentary shows there is (this includes historical and political documentary series, as well).  Unlike the very shallow Sports Century snippets they began running in 1999, 30 for 30 delves deep into major moments, personalities and issues in sports.  ""Broke"" is one of the best episodes the series has produced.Directed by Billy Corben, who produced the enormously entertaining episode on the Miami Hurricanes called ""The U"", ""Broke"" chronicles an ongoing, mind-boggling problem with professional athletes:  how can they may so much money in their careers and still end up 'broke'.  There may be the occasional Sports Center feature on this, or the a piece in Sports Illustrated but, those don't come close to the visual commentary provided by athletes who held on to their money, athletes who lost it all, coaches and agents who have tried to educate them, and financial experts providing background on how this happens in the first place.  You get horror stories about players like Bernie Kosar, Andre Rison and Keith McCants.  You also see the success of players who managed to avoid the pitfalls, like Reggie Wilkes and Jamal Mashburn.An initial reaction from the average person may be to feel no sympathy for these individuals who got enormously rich playing a children's game.  To react that way would be a mistake.  While these travails are magnified when professional athletes endure them, it reveals a much greater problem affecting society in all walks of life:  financial illiteracy.  It doesn't matter if you're making $10 an hour as a waiter for $15 million a year as a quarterback, if you don't understand how money works and how to make it work for you, you will end up in horrible financial straits.The underlying message that one should come away from ""Broke"" with is how important financial education is.  Unfortunately, schools (be it colleges or high schools) don't pay it much mind, otherwise it would be included in core classes.  A documentary like ""Broke"" is not likely to change the attitudes of the powers that be but, armed with this knowledge, the general populace can start taking care of themselves.",5,Shocking expose on a problem that runs much deeper than pro athletes,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,2187,"['ESPN', '30', '30', 'series', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'documentary', 'shows', 'historical', 'political', 'documentary', 'series', 'well', 'very', 'shallow', 'Sports', 'Century', 'snippets', 'began', 'running', '1999', '30', '30', 'delves', 'deep', 'major', 'moments', 'personalities', 'issues', 'sports', 'Broke', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'produced.Directed', 'Billy', 'Corben', 'who', 'produced', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'episode', 'Miami', 'Hurricanes', 'called', 'U', 'Broke', 'chronicles', 'ongoing', 'mind-boggling', 'problem', 'professional', 'athletes', 'how', 'can', 'may', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'careers', 'still', 'end', 'up', ""'broke"", 'may', 'be', 'occasional', 'Sports', 'Center', 'feature', 'piece', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'visual', 'commentary', 'provided', 'athletes', 'who', 'held', 'money', 'athletes', 'who', 'lost', 'coaches', 'agents', 'who', 'have', 'tried', 'educate', 'financial', 'experts', 'providing', 'background', 'how', 'first', 'place', 'get', 'horror', 'stories', 'players', 'Bernie', 'Kosar', 'Andre', 'Rison', 'Keith', 'McCants', 'also', 'see', 'success', 'players', 'who', 'managed', 'avoid', 'pitfalls', 'Reggie', 'Wilkes', 'Jamal', 'Mashburn.An', 'initial', 'reaction', 'average', 'person', 'may', 'be', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'individuals', 'who', 'got', 'enormously', 'rich', 'playing', 'children', 'game', 'react', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'travails', 'are', 'magnified', 'when', 'professional', 'athletes', 'endure', 'much', 'greater', 'problem', 'affecting', 'society', 'walks', 'life', 'financial', 'illiteracy', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'re"", 'making', '10', 'hour', 'waiter', '15', 'million', 'year', 'quarterback', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'money', 'how', 'make', 'work', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'horrible', 'financial', 'straits.The', 'underlying', 'message', 'one', 'should', 'come', 'away', 'Broke', 'how', 'important', 'financial', 'education', 'Unfortunately', 'schools', 'be', 'high', 'schools', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'included', 'core', 'classes', 'documentary', 'Broke', 'not', 'likely', 'change', 'attitudes', 'powers', 'be', 'armed', 'knowledge', 'general', 'populace', 'can', 'start', 'taking', 'care']",N/A
