The film The Rose Rent, based  upon the book of the same name by Ellis Peters, (Edith Pargiter, 1913-1995)  is incredibly authentic and colorful.  The different orders of society: nobleman, servant, military man, tradesman, artisan, abbott, monk, and priest are carefully wrought to produce a period piece with more detail and clearer dialogue than a Shakespearean play.  It would be a wonderful way of introducing young people to history.The setting is 12th Century England, a period of particular turmoil.  Henry I had died without a legitimate male heir, and he had designated his daughter Matilda as his successor, binding his nobles by oath to support her.  Although many of them did, including her very able half brother, an illegitimate son of Henry made an Earl by his father, many of them threw their support behind her cousin, Steven.  The warfare that ensued turned most of England into a battle ground and life for everyone a matter of ceaseless uncertainty.Cadfael, the central character of the series, is a Dominican monk and herbalist, and Dereck Jacobi is the perfect personification of him.  He has a presence which suggests strength, wisdom, and compassion.  Unlike most of the other brothers, Cadfael had spent most of his life in the secular world where he participated in the crusades, had adventures, fell in and out of love, and took his order after finding the ways of the world wanting.  He comes from a different culture, that of Wales and sees that of England through an outsiders more objective eyes.  His experience with life and the motives of men and his keen awareness of detail makes him the perfect sleuth, and when murder is committed, the civil authorities, often personified by Hugh Beringer (Eorin McCarthy),  are often more than willing to have him clear things up for them.In Rose Rent, a lovely widow has given the home and land that she shared with her beloved spouse to the Abbey for a single rose from its garden to be delivered to her yearly on the anniversary of his death.  Unknown to her several of the men in the village have their eye on her and her wealth, and see her devotion to her deceased spouse as an obstacle to their designs.  Murder is done, and it is left to Cadfael to discover the guilty party before another dies and before the pretty lady takes herself into holy orders because she considers herself a danger to others.  The tableau created is a rich tapestry of loss, greed, lust, violence and love.  An interesting way to spend an hour.",5,A visit to the 12th Century,1027123200,"07 20, 2002",2002,2611,"['enjoy', 'good', 'murder', 'mystery', 'classical', 'type', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'series', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'Rose', 'Rent', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Ellis', 'Peters', 'Edith', 'Pargiter', '1913-1995', 'incredibly', 'authentic', 'colorful', 'different', 'orders', 'society', 'nobleman', 'servant', 'military', 'man', 'tradesman', 'artisan', 'abbott', 'monk', 'priest', 'are', 'carefully', 'wrought', 'produce', 'period', 'piece', 'more', 'detail', 'clearer', 'dialogue', 'Shakespearean', 'play', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'way', 'introducing', 'young', 'people', 'history.The', 'setting', '12th', 'Century', 'England', 'period', 'particular', 'turmoil', 'Henry', 'had', 'died', 'legitimate', 'male', 'heir', 'had', 'designated', 'daughter', 'Matilda', 'successor', 'binding', 'nobles', 'oath', 'support', 'many', 'did', 'including', 'very', 'able', 'half', 'brother', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Henry', 'made', 'Earl', 'father', 'many', 'threw', 'support', 'cousin', 'Steven', 'warfare', 'ensued', 'turned', 'most', 'England', 'battle', 'ground', 'life', 'everyone', 'matter', 'ceaseless', 'uncertainty.Cadfael', 'central', 'character', 'series', 'Dominican', 'monk', 'herbalist', 'Dereck', 'Jacobi', 'perfect', 'personification', 'presence', 'strength', 'wisdom', 'compassion', 'most', 'other', 'brothers', 'Cadfael', 'had', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'secular', 'world', 'where', 'participated', 'crusades', 'had', 'adventures', 'fell', 'love', 'took', 'order', 'finding', 'ways', 'world', 'wanting', 'different', 'culture', 'Wales', 'England', 'outsiders', 'more', 'objective', 'eyes', 'experience', 'life', 'motives', 'men', 'keen', 'awareness', 'detail', 'perfect', 'sleuth', 'when', 'murder', 'committed', 'civil', 'authorities', 'often', 'personified', 'Hugh', 'Beringer', 'Eorin', 'McCarthy', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'willing', 'have', 'clear', 'things', 'up', 'them.In', 'Rose', 'Rent', 'lovely', 'widow', 'given', 'home', 'land', 'shared', 'beloved', 'spouse', 'Abbey', 'single', 'rose', 'garden', 'be', 'delivered', 'yearly', 'anniversary', 'death', 'several', 'men', 'village', 'have', 'eye', 'wealth', 'see', 'devotion', 'deceased', 'spouse', 'obstacle', 'designs', 'Murder', 'done', 'left', 'Cadfael', 'discover', 'guilty', 'party', 'dies', 'pretty', 'lady', 'holy', 'orders', 'danger', 'others', 'tableau', 'created', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'loss', 'greed', 'lust', 'violence', 'love', 'interesting', 'way', 'spend', 'hour']",Brother Cadfael - The Rose Rent

I think someone different is playing Hugh Berenger, but that could just be the natural aging of the actor. In any case, the writers seem to have matured some. This is a satisfyingly complicated plot, and while the actual murderer was one I sort of suspected early on, I had not stuck to him. The raising and dashing of suspicions went on very well in this one.Edward Perle is suffering horribly from some clearly terminal disease. His wife Judith, who loves him, is agonized that she can do so little to help him. But Brother Cadfael is there with his potions. He gives Judith a small vial and says to give him just a thimbleful, which should ease the pain, at which Edward cries out that nothing eases the pain. But, says Cadfael, be very careful, because two thimblefuls might well ease his pain forever.Next scene we are attending Edward's funeral, with his beautiful widow in elegant weeds, and several characters discussing how beautiful she is and how much she will need a new husband. Godfrey Fuller, the wool merchant, is fat and, in his own words, has much to offer her in material goods. Thomas Hynde, a rather useless dandy who has been disinherited by his father, says that he can give her what she ""really"" needs, since she already has wealth. Miles Colier, her cousin, knows she will not accept a close kin for ""fear of madness."" Bertrad, her workman in the weaving shop she inherited from her husband, just sort of leers.OK, so there are quite a few people interested in her. But she's not only grieving for her husband, she's suffering from guilt which she discusses with Brother Cadfael, who implies that he knew darn well she gave Edward enough potion to end his pain permanently, and does not disapprove. Edward was dying anyway, and she only did it to end his pain.She decides to deed her home to the Abbey, save only that they are to pay her one white rose from her husband's garden to remind her of him, once a year on the first of July. Young Brother Eluric has been tending the roses and praying fervently for Edward Perle's soul. So he is assigned the task of taking the first year's rent to Judith. Unfortunately, here is one more man bewitched by her beauty and fine character. He suffers terrible guilt for it, however, as he has taken a vow.So the brothers at the abbey are only too quick to assume he is a suicide when he is found dead, the knife covered with blood by his hand. But Cadfael is not fooled, and notes several bits of evidence that show he was murdered instead.OK, I've got you up to the first murder. There's another. Plus someone poisoning the rose bush. It's enough to keep you guessing right to the end.",5,Loved the Whole Series of Mysteries,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2773,"['one', 'three-year', 'break', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'show', 'ran', 'three', 'years', 'not', 'think', 'someone', 'different', 'playing', 'Hugh', 'Berenger', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'natural', 'aging', 'actor', 'case', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'matured', 'satisfyingly', 'complicated', 'plot', 'actual', 'murderer', 'was', 'one', 'sort', 'suspected', 'early', 'had', 'not', 'stuck', 'raising', 'dashing', 'suspicions', 'went', 'very', 'well', 'one.Edward', 'Perle', 'suffering', 'horribly', 'clearly', 'terminal', 'disease', 'wife', 'Judith', 'who', 'agonized', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'little', 'help', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'there', 'potions', 'Judith', 'small', 'vial', 'give', 'just', 'thimbleful', 'should', 'ease', 'pain', 'Edward', 'out', 'nothing', 'pain', 'Cadfael', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'two', 'thimblefuls', 'might', 'well', 'ease', 'pain', 'forever.Next', 'scene', 'are', 'attending', 'Edward', 'funeral', 'beautiful', 'widow', 'elegant', 'weeds', 'several', 'characters', 'discussing', 'how', 'beautiful', 'how', 'much', 'will', 'need', 'new', 'husband', 'Godfrey', 'Fuller', 'wool', 'merchant', 'fat', 'own', 'words', 'much', 'offer', 'material', 'goods', 'Thomas', 'Hynde', 'rather', 'useless', 'dandy', 'who', 'been', 'disinherited', 'father', 'can', 'give', 'what', 'really', 'needs', 'already', 'wealth', 'Miles', 'Colier', 'cousin', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'close', 'kin', 'fear', 'madness', 'Bertrad', 'workman', 'weaving', 'shop', 'inherited', 'husband', 'just', 'sort', 'leers.OK', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'interested', 'not', 'only', 'grieving', 'husband', 'suffering', 'guilt', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'who', 'knew', 'darn', 'well', 'gave', 'Edward', 'enough', 'potion', 'end', 'pain', 'permanently', 'not', 'disapprove', 'Edward', 'was', 'dying', 'anyway', 'only', 'did', 'end', 'pain.She', 'deed', 'home', 'Abbey', 'save', 'only', 'are', 'pay', 'one', 'white', 'rose', 'husband', 'garden', 'remind', 'once', 'year', 'first', 'July', 'Young', 'Brother', 'Eluric', 'been', 'tending', 'roses', 'praying', 'fervently', 'Edward', 'Perle', 'soul', 'assigned', 'task', 'taking', 'first', 'year', 'rent', 'Judith', 'Unfortunately', 'here', 'one', 'more', 'man', 'bewitched', 'beauty', 'fine', 'character', 'terrible', 'guilt', 'however', 'taken', 'vow.So', 'brothers', 'abbey', 'are', 'only', 'too', 'quick', 'assume', 'suicide', 'when', 'found', 'dead', 'knife', 'covered', 'blood', 'hand', 'Cadfael', 'not', 'fooled', 'notes', 'several', 'bits', 'evidence', 'show', 'was', 'murdered', 'instead.OK', ""'ve"", 'got', 'first', 'murder', 'someone', 'poisoning', 'rose', 'bush', 'enough', 'keep', 'guessing', 'right', 'end']",Brother Cadfael - The Rose Rent

Cadfael welcomes them while some of the other Brothers find it a nuisance.Within a short while, a body is found in a leather sack amongst the visitors. No body is to leave. In an attempt to discover the culprit Cadfael boils down the man's body to inspect the bones and uncovers two possible explanations for his death. And yes they did leave.Once again many things are not what they seem and it is up to Brother Cadfael to bring then to light. There are also parallel stories that may or may not have a bearing on the murder. One is of a seller of bogus relics. The other two brothers that are on a pilgrimage.If you do not compare to the book it is a good film and well balanced. The movie has to tighten the story so some good guys in the book may have to go bad.

679645,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B00005RIWZ,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[9, 13]","THE ROSE RENT consists of a single rose the Abbey of Saint Peter must pay each year for the use of a cottage owned by a devout and beautiful young widow (she who played the wise-cracking leftist journalist Anne in THE ICE HOUSE). The young widow no longer wishes to live in the home she once shared with her beloved husband..much to the sorrow of her cousin who would like to marry her himself (he played Mr. Bingham in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE). Having received permission to use the cottage to generate revenue, the Abbey leases the property to a middle-age craftsman and newcomer who is given to strange midnight rides into the nearby forest.A young novice from the Abbey is drafted to tend the rose bushes at the cottage and appropriately he is also given the task of snipping and delivering the single &quot;rose rent&quot; each year on the anniversary of the death of the husband. The novice, who was himself &quot;given&quot; to the Abby when he was a small boy finds himself attracted to the beautiful young widow. Others detect his interest and soon he is accused of &quot;lusting after the flesh&quot; by one of the more puritanical of the Abbey Fathers.The plot thickens when an untimely death occurs, and the cause of the death seems &quot;unnatural&quot;...in fact Brother Cadfael (Derek Jacobi) suspects the death has been caused by arsenic the young novice has been using to dress the rose bushes. Has the novice taken leave of his senses and killed his accuser as Father Jerome insists, or are other forces at work? What of the craftsman? Where was he on the night of the murder which occurred in his own back yard? And the cousin? Has his desire for the young widow driven him to commit murder?THE ROSE RENT is one of the most interesting and emotionally satisfying of the Cadfael stories. Those who have not read the books or who have difficulty following the machinations of the politics of the era will enjoy this film because it truly considers human emotions, desires, and character and is less reliant on some of the &quot;historical&quot; elements that drive the other stories (in other words one does not have to understand  the civil war between Stephen and Maude to follow the storyline).I love the Cadfael stories no matter what..but this is one of my favorites and the cast is steller.",5,Beautiful and faithful film...,1006387200,"11 22, 2001",2001,2309,"['ROSE', 'RENT', 'single', 'rose', 'Abbey', 'Saint', 'Peter', 'must', 'pay', 'year', 'use', 'cottage', 'owned', 'devout', 'beautiful', 'young', 'widow', 'who', 'played', 'wise-cracking', 'leftist', 'journalist', 'Anne', 'THE', 'ICE', 'HOUSE', 'young', 'widow', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'home', 'once', 'shared', 'beloved', 'husband..much', 'sorrow', 'cousin', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'marry', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Bingham', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'Having', 'received', 'permission', 'use', 'cottage', 'generate', 'revenue', 'Abbey', 'property', 'middle-age', 'craftsman', 'newcomer', 'who', 'given', 'strange', 'midnight', 'rides', 'nearby', 'forest.A', 'young', 'novice', 'Abbey', 'drafted', 'tend', 'rose', 'bushes', 'cottage', 'appropriately', 'also', 'given', 'task', 'snipping', 'delivering', 'single', 'quot', 'rose', 'rent', 'quot', 'year', 'anniversary', 'death', 'husband', 'novice', 'who', 'was', 'quot', 'given', 'quot', 'Abby', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'boy', 'attracted', 'beautiful', 'young', 'widow', 'Others', 'detect', 'interest', 'soon', 'accused', 'quot', 'lusting', 'flesh', 'quot', 'one', 'more', 'puritanical', 'Abbey', 'Fathers.The', 'plot', 'thickens', 'when', 'untimely', 'death', 'occurs', 'cause', 'death', 'quot', 'unnatural', 'quot', 'fact', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'death', 'been', 'caused', 'arsenic', 'young', 'novice', 'been', 'using', 'dress', 'rose', 'bushes', 'novice', 'taken', 'leave', 'senses', 'killed', 'accuser', 'Father', 'Jerome', 'are', 'other', 'forces', 'work', 'What', 'craftsman', 'Where', 'was', 'night', 'murder', 'occurred', 'own', 'back', 'yard', 'cousin', 'desire', 'young', 'widow', 'driven', 'commit', 'murder', 'THE', 'ROSE', 'RENT', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'Cadfael', 'stories', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'who', 'have', 'difficulty', 'following', 'machinations', 'politics', 'era', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'considers', 'human', 'emotions', 'desires', 'character', 'less', 'reliant', 'quot', 'historical', 'quot', 'elements', 'drive', 'other', 'stories', 'other', 'words', 'one', 'not', 'have', 'understand', 'civil', 'war', 'Stephen', 'Maude', 'follow', 'storyline', 'love', 'Cadfael', 'matter', 'what..but', 'one', 'favorites', 'cast', 'steller']",Brother Cadfael - The Rose Rent
