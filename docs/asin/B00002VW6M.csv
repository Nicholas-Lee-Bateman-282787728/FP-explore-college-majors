The other themes of the film, class distinctions etc. are still valid...but  it will be Simone, touching the heart of this callow young man and making  him better for it, feeling their age difference yet unable to stop herself  from loving and hoping for happiness against her own experience, that will  haunt you.

515471,A106016KSI0YQ,B00002VW6M,Jay Dickson,"[0, 0]","Jack Clayton's remarkable 1958 film changed British cinema, and brought a new understanding of the role of sex in postwar society. Set in the years after the war, the film is primarily about the changes in the class system wrought by the Second World War and the new Atlee government: the working-class hero of the film, Joe Lampton, released from a POW camp at the war's end, works in an accounting firm and dreams of making good by marrying the pretty daughter (Heather Sears) of the richest manufacturer in town. His sounding board for his ambitions, a married older Frenchwoman Simone Signoret) living in his Yorkshire town, progresses from being the erotic outlet for his frustrations to being the genuine object of his true love once he realizes the insipidity of the millionaire's daughter, but he is unable to make good on his promises to his sentimental educator and opts instead for the easy life when he gets the younger woman pregnant.The story of this ambitious handsome boy making good, as Pauline Kael has pointed out, is an old one, common to novelists as diverse as Stendhal and Theodore Dreiser. What makes it special here is the splendid acting of Harvey and Signoret, the tactful direction of Clayton, and the genuinely stunning cinematography of Clayton's frequent partner Freddie Francis. The film treats its story maturely and freshly, and the lovemaking and squabbling scenes between Harvey (here much more virile and less pinched than usual) and Signoret (as dreamy and carnal as ever) seem as sophisticated as anything else from the period. The film suffers only at the end when nemesis comes to dog Harvey's Joe for his selfishness and the realistic tone of the first three-quarters of the film becomes compromised by the overapplication of dramatic irony. But it's still one of the best films dealing with that tremendously sociologically rich period in Britain after the Second World War.",4,Local boy makes good,1185408000,"07 26, 2007",2007,1917,"['Jack', 'Clayton', 'remarkable', '1958', 'film', 'changed', 'British', 'cinema', 'brought', 'new', 'understanding', 'role', 'sex', 'postwar', 'society', 'Set', 'years', 'war', 'film', 'primarily', 'changes', 'class', 'system', 'wrought', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'new', 'Atlee', 'government', 'working-class', 'hero', 'film', 'Joe', 'Lampton', 'released', 'POW', 'camp', 'war', 'end', 'accounting', 'firm', 'dreams', 'making', 'good', 'marrying', 'pretty', 'daughter', 'Heather', 'Sears', 'richest', 'manufacturer', 'town', 'sounding', 'board', 'ambitions', 'married', 'older', 'Frenchwoman', 'Simone', 'Signoret', 'living', 'Yorkshire', 'town', 'being', 'erotic', 'outlet', 'frustrations', 'being', 'genuine', 'object', 'true', 'love', 'once', 'insipidity', 'millionaire', 'daughter', 'unable', 'make', 'good', 'promises', 'sentimental', 'educator', 'opts', 'instead', 'easy', 'life', 'when', 'younger', 'woman', 'story', 'ambitious', 'handsome', 'boy', 'making', 'good', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'pointed', 'out', 'old', 'one', 'common', 'novelists', 'as', 'diverse', 'Stendhal', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'What', 'special', 'here', 'splendid', 'acting', 'Harvey', 'Signoret', 'tactful', 'direction', 'Clayton', 'genuinely', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'Clayton', 'frequent', 'partner', 'Freddie', 'Francis', 'film', 'story', 'maturely', 'freshly', 'lovemaking', 'squabbling', 'scenes', 'Harvey', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'virile', 'less', 'pinched', 'usual', 'Signoret', 'dreamy', 'carnal', 'ever', 'seem', 'as', 'sophisticated', 'anything', 'else', 'period', 'film', 'only', 'end', 'when', 'nemesis', 'dog', 'Harvey', 'Joe', 'selfishness', 'realistic', 'tone', 'first', 'three-quarters', 'film', 'becomes', 'compromised', 'overapplication', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'dealing', 'tremendously', 'sociologically', 'rich', 'period', 'Britain', 'Second', 'World', 'War']",Room at the Top

515475,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00002VW6M,Robert Morris,"[44, 49]","Throughout the 1950s, a group of young British writers were referred to as ""angry young men"" because, in their novels and plays, they excoriated what they perceived to be the dominant materialistic values of their society following World War Two. They included playwrights John Osborne and Kingsley Amis and novelists John Braine, John Wain, and Alan Silitoe. This film is based on Braine's novel Room at the Top; Neil Patterson received an Academy Away for best adapted screenplay. Joe Lampton (Laurence Harvey) is the focal point. Driven by smoldering ambition to overcome his modest circumstances and deeply resentful of the wealthiest man in a North Country village (Brown, played by Donald Wolfit), he finally obtains a position in Brown's company and begins his difficult journey to ""the top"" while including marriage to Brown's daughter Susan (Heather Sears) among his ultimate objectives. Along the way, he meets an older but still attractive Frenchwoman, Alice Aisgill (Simone Signoret) with whom he has an affair. For Joe, it is a mere dalliance along his career path; she, however, falls in love with him. Beyond the passionate sex which she enjoys as much as he does, Alice also helps Joe to refine his social graces and increase his understanding and appreciation of the cultural arts. (Signoret received an Academy Award as best actress for her performance in this film.) Joe seems grateful for her contributions to his self-improvement but really has no long-term interest in her. He remains obsessed with reaching ""the top"" with wife Susan at his side, possessing great wealth, power, and prestige.And then he learns from Susan that....Alice is the most sympathetic character in the film, largely because Joe exploits her so callously. As for Brown, ""what you see is what you get"": a class-conscious, hard-driving, no-nonsense capitalist. Unlike Joe, no need for dissembling. Brown is at ""the top"" and (by God) he intends to remain there. Susan is of great importance to Joe (and to her father, of course) but is of little importance to the film's story line except as one of the ambitious goals which motivate Joe. He really cares little for her as a person, one way or the other. Were she in his own social class, Joe would probably have little to do with her...except, perhaps, for occasional sexual gratification (for himself). At least Alice offered more than sex...she offered unconditional love. Only at the end of the film does Joe begin to realize what he has gained by reaching ""the top"" and at what a cost. Both in the novel and in this film, Joe symbolizes just about everything which enraged Braine and other British writers.Years later, in a brief excerpt from ""The Paradox of Our Time,"" George Carlin observes that ""We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've added years to life, not life to years.""

515477,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00002VW6M,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 2]","""Room at the Top,"" (1959) is considered a classic British film by many.  It's a taut 115 minute black and white dramatic romance that is sometimes described as a kitchen sink drama; other times as an angry young man drama.  It stars Laurence Harvey as Joe Lampton, an ambitious young accountant of working class origins, scheming to marry the daughter, Susan Brown, of the wealthiest, most influential local factory owner.  Unfortunately, Lampton falls in love with the wife of another influential local man, Alice Aisgill, played by Simone Signoret in a deservedly Oscar-winning performance, only the second given to a Frenchwoman since one was given to Claudette Colbert in 1934. The film was based on the novel of the same name by author/screenwriter John Braine,Room at the Top.  It was directed by Jack Clayton, who replaced Peter Glenville.Many people consider this the best performance of the normally dour Harvey (The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)), although he lost out Oscar-wise to Charlton Heston in BEN HUR.  (And it was a year in which every male actor nominated was a heavyweight.)  But there's never been any question that Signoret (Casque d'Or (The Criterion Collection),Diabolique (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]), whose face and eyes speak volumes, is the heart of the movie, playing a part not written for a Frenchwoman, first offered to Vivian Leigh.  In fact, in an article entitled ""In Praise of Older Women,"" ""Time Magazine"" once remarked that Simone Signoret was ""everywoman's Bogart, in a trench coat, dangling a cigarette, in `Room at the Top.'""  Stalwart British supporting players Donald Wolfit, Allan Cuthbertson and Raymond Huntley provide strong performances as well. As does Hermione Baddeley, (also up for an Oscar, for the shortest performance ever nominated, at two minutes, 32 seconds, as Alice's friend Elspeth). Ian Hendry makes his film debut here.The film was made in 1958, and its women are in the styles of 1958, confusingly enough to current viewers.  But ROOM is actually set in 1947, as, knew audiences upon its release, was the novel it is based upon, and as we are told in a briefly-glimpsed letter.  Therefore, Lampton is a 25 year old World War II veteran, who got his accountancy certificate during a three-year imprisonment as a prisoner of war.  On the strength of that certificate, he's left his downtrodden, down market hometown of Dufton, for Warnley, apparently a much pleasanter, better-off town.  (The movie was filmed in Bradford, West Yorkshire.)  Lampton quickly sets his sights on nave young Susan, and joins the local theatrical club to meet her, but inadvertently meets, has an affair with, and falls in love with sexy married, older woman Alice.  This film features the first open reference to the sex act in a British picture, and was therefore given an X certificate by the British Board of Film Classification.  So no British cinema chain would touch it.  Eventually the ABC chain took a chance and got a huge critical and commercial hit for its pains.  Sex always sells, we know.Aside from its commanding performances, I find the movie somewhat dated.  Women have made loveless marriages to acquire wealth, power and status since time immemorial.  Men have, less frequently, done the same.  Extra-marital relationships are not unknown.  It all hardly seems a tragedy to me.",3,"Aside From Its Commanding Performances, Somewhat Dated",1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,3357,"['Room', 'Top', '1959', 'considered', 'classic', 'British', 'film', 'many', 'taut', '115', 'minute', 'black', 'white', 'dramatic', 'romance', 'sometimes', 'described', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'drama', 'other', 'times', 'angry', 'young', 'man', 'drama', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'Joe', 'Lampton', 'ambitious', 'young', 'accountant', 'working', 'class', 'origins', 'scheming', 'marry', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Brown', 'wealthiest', 'most', 'influential', 'local', 'factory', 'owner', 'Unfortunately', 'Lampton', 'love', 'wife', 'influential', 'local', 'man', 'Alice', 'Aisgill', 'played', 'Simone', 'Signoret', 'deservedly', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'only', 'second', 'given', 'Frenchwoman', 'one', 'was', 'given', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', '1934', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'author/screenwriter', 'John', 'Braine', 'Room', 'Top', 'was', 'directed', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'who', 'replaced', 'Peter', 'Glenville.Many', 'people', 'consider', 'best', 'performance', 'normally', 'dour', 'Harvey', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'Special', 'Edition', 'lost', 'out', 'Oscar-wise', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'BEN', 'HUR', 'was', 'year', 'male', 'actor', 'nominated', 'was', 'heavyweight', 'never', 'been', 'question', 'Signoret', 'Casque', ""d'Or"", 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Diabolique', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'face', 'eyes', 'speak', 'volumes', 'heart', 'movie', 'playing', 'part', 'not', 'written', 'Frenchwoman', 'first', 'offered', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'fact', 'article', 'entitled', 'Praise', 'Older', 'Women', 'Time', 'Magazine', 'once', 'remarked', 'Simone', 'Signoret', 'was', 'everywoman', 'Bogart', 'trench', 'coat', 'dangling', 'cigarette', 'Room', 'Top', 'Stalwart', 'British', 'supporting', 'players', 'Donald', 'Wolfit', 'Allan', 'Cuthbertson', 'Raymond', 'Huntley', 'provide', 'strong', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Hermione', 'Baddeley', 'also', 'up', 'Oscar', 'shortest', 'performance', 'ever', 'nominated', 'two', 'minutes', '32', 'seconds', 'Alice', 'friend', 'Elspeth', 'Ian', 'Hendry', 'film', 'debut', 'here.The', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1958', 'women', 'are', 'styles', '1958', 'confusingly', 'enough', 'current', 'viewers', 'ROOM', 'actually', 'set', '1947', 'knew', 'audiences', 'release', 'was', 'novel', 'based', 'are', 'told', 'briefly-glimpsed', 'letter', 'Therefore', 'Lampton', '25', 'year', 'old', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veteran', 'who', 'got', 'accountancy', 'certificate', 'three-year', 'imprisonment', 'prisoner', 'war', 'strength', 'certificate', 'left', 'downtrodden', 'down', 'market', 'hometown', 'Dufton', 'Warnley', 'apparently', 'much', 'pleasanter', 'better-off', 'town', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Bradford', 'West', 'Yorkshire', 'Lampton', 'quickly', 'sights', 'nave', 'young', 'Susan', 'local', 'theatrical', 'club', 'meet', 'inadvertently', 'meets', 'affair', 'love', 'sexy', 'married', 'older', 'woman', 'Alice', 'film', 'first', 'open', 'reference', 'sex', 'act', 'British', 'picture', 'was', 'therefore', 'given', 'X', 'certificate', 'British', 'Board', 'Film', 'Classification', 'So', 'no', 'British', 'cinema', 'chain', 'would', 'touch', 'Eventually', 'ABC', 'chain', 'took', 'chance', 'got', 'huge', 'critical', 'commercial', 'hit', 'pains', 'Sex', 'always', 'know.Aside', 'commanding', 'performances', 'find', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'Women', 'have', 'made', 'loveless', 'marriages', 'acquire', 'wealth', 'power', 'status', 'time', 'immemorial', 'Men', 'have', 'less', 'frequently', 'done', 'same', 'Extra-marital', 'relationships', 'are', 'not', 'unknown', 'hardly', 'tragedy']",Room at the Top

Laurence Harvey gives a masterful performance as an opportunistic young man who, on the surface, has apparently succeeded, but yet, if this is so, why does he have a funereal look on his face as he is being transported from the church sitting next to beautiful Heather Sears, his new bride and daughter of the wealthiest man in town?The answer to that question lies in the woman who took her life, and was Harvey's true love, Simone Signoret, who delivered one of the most captivating performances of the post-World War Two period in achieving a notably deserved ""Best Actress"" Oscar.  When Harvey arrives in the small English factory town he resents the lowly position he has, seeking to graduate to the world of wealth.  The restrictive surroundings mandate that the only way for him to do so in that town is to successfully romance Sears, the daughter of a wealthy factory owner, which he does.  Eventually he impregnates her and the two marry after her father, who earlier sought to get rid of Harvey by arranging a possible position for him in another town at an excellent salary, rescinds his opposition.The heart and soul of the movie is Signoret, whom Harvey meets at a local drama club, where they appear in a play together and immediately establish a torrid romance.  Harvey knows that, from the standpoint of a deep, abiding, romantic love, he vibrates with the older French woman in a way he never can with Sears.  It all comes down to ultimate opportunity, and so Harvey leaves the woman he deeply loves.  When the heartbroken Signoret takes her life Harvey is left with the trappings of success while enduring a painful inward death.As a form of expiating what he has done, Harvey seeks out physical punishment by behaving in an unruly manner at a local pub.  His actions invite reprisal from a group of young toughs, who resent him as an interloper from the upper class who has come to sneer at them.  He is savagely beaten on a bridge near the bar a few minutes after his departure from the pub.  He makes no attempt to defend himself and encourages the beating, his eyes containing a dead look as he thinks about the recently deceased Signoret.  The scene contains such a realistic ring that, when director Jack Clayton and crew were shooting it late one evening, townspeople confused it for the real thing and contacted the police.Clayton directed with a sure hand, insuring that the emotions appeared genuine, always asserted with tangible meaning at the proper level with none of the overacting of soap opera.  Harvey is seen as a young man torn emotionally between his genuine feelings for Signoret and his quest to escape a humdrum life in a small town, the prospect of which clearly terrifies him.",5,The Angry Young Man Succeeds?,1013040000,"02 7, 2002",2002,2854,"['was', 'era', 'John', 'Osborne', 'Britain', 'Angry', 'Young', 'Man', 'influence', 'was', 'becoming', 'so', 'widespread', 'post-Suez', 'period', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'masterful', 'performance', 'opportunistic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'surface', 'apparently', 'succeeded', 'yet', 'so', 'why', 'have', 'funereal', 'look', 'face', 'being', 'transported', 'church', 'sitting', 'next', 'beautiful', 'Heather', 'Sears', 'new', 'bride', 'daughter', 'wealthiest', 'man', 'town', 'answer', 'question', 'woman', 'who', 'took', 'life', 'was', 'Harvey', 'true', 'love', 'Simone', 'Signoret', 'who', 'delivered', 'one', 'most', 'captivating', 'performances', 'post-World', 'War', 'Two', 'period', 'achieving', 'notably', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'When', 'Harvey', 'small', 'English', 'factory', 'town', 'lowly', 'position', 'seeking', 'graduate', 'world', 'wealth', 'restrictive', 'surroundings', 'mandate', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'so', 'town', 'successfully', 'romance', 'Sears', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'factory', 'owner', 'Eventually', 'two', 'marry', 'father', 'who', 'earlier', 'sought', 'get', 'rid', 'Harvey', 'arranging', 'possible', 'position', 'town', 'excellent', 'salary', 'opposition.The', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'Signoret', 'whom', 'Harvey', 'local', 'drama', 'club', 'where', 'appear', 'play', 'together', 'immediately', 'establish', 'torrid', 'romance', 'Harvey', 'standpoint', 'deep', 'abiding', 'romantic', 'love', 'older', 'French', 'woman', 'way', 'never', 'can', 'Sears', 'down', 'ultimate', 'opportunity', 'so', 'Harvey', 'woman', 'loves', 'When', 'heartbroken', 'Signoret', 'life', 'Harvey', 'left', 'trappings', 'success', 'enduring', 'painful', 'inward', 'form', 'expiating', 'what', 'done', 'Harvey', 'out', 'physical', 'punishment', 'behaving', 'unruly', 'manner', 'local', 'pub', 'actions', 'invite', 'reprisal', 'group', 'young', 'toughs', 'who', 'resent', 'interloper', 'upper', 'class', 'who', 'come', 'sneer', 'savagely', 'beaten', 'bridge', 'bar', 'few', 'minutes', 'departure', 'pub', 'attempt', 'defend', 'beating', 'eyes', 'containing', 'dead', 'look', 'recently', 'deceased', 'Signoret', 'scene', 'contains', 'such', 'realistic', 'ring', 'when', 'director', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'crew', 'were', 'shooting', 'late', 'one', 'evening', 'townspeople', 'confused', 'real', 'thing', 'contacted', 'police.Clayton', 'directed', 'sure', 'hand', 'insuring', 'emotions', 'appeared', 'genuine', 'always', 'asserted', 'tangible', 'meaning', 'proper', 'level', 'none', 'overacting', 'soap', 'opera', 'Harvey', 'seen', 'young', 'man', 'torn', 'emotionally', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'Signoret', 'quest', 'escape', 'humdrum', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'prospect', 'clearly']",Room at the Top
