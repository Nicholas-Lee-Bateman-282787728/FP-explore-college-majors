I couldnt put my finger on it, there was something ""different""... I really enjoyed the story, even though the acting was OFF, but just the same, it wasnt bad acting -like Ben Afleck in the movie ""DareDevil"". It was another kind of ""Bad Acting"". So I go to the Review section on Netflix where someone alerts us all, that Locked Up, is a cut up version of a Gay Porno Film called ""In The Hole"".  So I purchased ""In The Hole"" and LO AND BEHOLD, it is true. Locked Up is just a porno film minus the graphic sex.  WOW. In The Hole is the movie Locked Up, with all of the scenes that LETS FACE IT, you really want to see.  But dont skip Locked Up and just buy ""In The Hole"". ""In The Hole"" is not the complete story and it is NOT in english. Buy both, it really completes the collection. You really dont see the WHOLE movie unless own both versions.But seriously once you climb over the terrible acting, it really is a thought provoking story.

Apart from being hopelessly miscast (ie: the English accent and about as tough as a powder puff) he cannot act his way out of a paper bag. Apparently he is an artist - well hopefully he is better at that than acting.I struggle to see why he was cast in the role. The cast interviews on the dvd show him saying he disagreed with the director and was accused of being a diva on set - so why on earth didn't they fire him and get someone else?!Mike Sale ruins every scene he is in and if someone else had been in the role, the movie might have been much better than it is.  Sure it is your typical cliche prison movie (shower nudity,pack-rape scene, etc) but Marcel Schlutt is gorgeous and plays his role convincingly.  (Be sure to watch the cast interviews as he looks much sexier in those with his short hair!)The other thing I found a bit odd was that the ""big sex scene"" that the two actors talk about in their interviews is actually cut from the movie!  It is there in the deleted scenes, but I can't see why the director left it out - its abscence leaves the final farewell lovemaking scene look like something out of some sloppy Danielle Steel miniseries - especially the dreadful after sex cuddle!If you buy this as part of the 3 movie 'Guilty Pleasures' set it is great value for money and there are some nice cock and body shots in the movie (especially the masterbation scenes), but don't set your expectations too high - because of Mike Sale it is pretty bad!",2,Laughable casting,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,1556,"['Mike', 'Sale', 'British', 'black', 'guy', 'playing', 'American', 'worst', 'thing', 'movie', 'Apart', 'being', 'hopelessly', 'miscast', 'ie', 'English', 'accent', 'as', 'tough', 'powder', 'puff', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'Apparently', 'artist', 'well', 'hopefully', 'better', 'acting.I', 'struggle', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'cast', 'interviews', 'dvd', 'show', 'saying', 'disagreed', 'director', 'was', 'accused', 'being', 'diva', 'set', 'so', 'why', 'earth', 'did', ""n't"", 'fire', 'get', 'someone', 'else', 'Mike', 'Sale', 'scene', 'someone', 'else', 'had', 'been', 'role', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Sure', 'typical', 'cliche', 'prison', 'movie', 'shower', 'nudity', 'pack-rape', 'scene', 'etc', 'Marcel', 'Schlutt', 'gorgeous', 'role', 'convincingly', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'cast', 'interviews', 'much', 'sexier', 'short', 'hair', 'other', 'thing', 'found', 'bit', 'odd', 'was', 'big', 'sex', 'scene', 'two', 'actors', 'talk', 'interviews', 'actually', 'cut', 'movie', 'there', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'director', 'left', 'out', 'abscence', 'final', 'farewell', 'lovemaking', 'scene', 'look', 'something', 'sloppy', 'Danielle', 'Steel', 'miniseries', 'especially', 'dreadful', 'sex', 'cuddle', 'buy', 'part', '3', 'movie', ""'Guilty"", 'Pleasures', 'set', 'great', 'value', 'money', 'are', 'nice', 'cock', 'body', 'shots', 'movie', 'especially', 'masterbation', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'set', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'Mike', 'Sale', 'pretty', 'bad']",Locked Up

859421,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00064AFF0,Grady Harp,"[7, 8]","GEFANGEN (LOCKED UP) is a testy little German film that dares to push the envelope of NR rating, and given the concept of the story and the background of the writer/director J&ouml;rg Andreas making his first legitimate (ie non-porn) movie, it succeeds despite some technical shortcomings.  No, it is not a film for those with issues concerning same-sex films, but for the target gay audience and for that audience eager to see innovative independent filmmaking adventures, LOCKED UP  is well worth watching!The setting is a prison somewhere in Germany and the story begins with the handcuffed young credit card fraud 'criminal' Dennis (Marcel Schlutt) encountering his first entry into a prison.  The tone of the film is set at the induction desk where Dennis is stripped and zealously 'inspected!' by the eager prison guards. He is then placed in a cell and begins his two-year prison term.  Naturally the other prisoners (all body builders) on his bloc intimidate him into submission to their rules of the house.  Through his cell window Dennis gazes on a fellow inmate, an African American hunk named Mike (Mile Sale),  in prison for a fifteen-year sentence for the murder of his wife, digging trenches.  They make eye contact and there is a mutual interest.  Gradually the two meet under the rigid time frames for the prisoners, talk, share coffee in Mike's room, and eventually respond to their mutual attraction. During one interlude they are observed by a guard envious of Mike's attention and affection for Dennis. And as the routine prison dramas go, the inmates polarize over the two men's connection.  Dennis is brutally raped, talked into cooperating with the drug ring, but Dennis' growing love for Mike is stronger than the resistance of both inmates and prison officials and they are eventually able to share a cell.Dennis' mother visits her son, encourages him, and arranges for a lawyer to gain a shortened term for Dennis, a favor that Dennis greets with mixed emotions, as he does not want to leave his lover Mike as others have done.  But in a tender scene Mike convinces Dennis that he is young and should accept the early release, an act of love that Dennis finally accepts.  Dennis is released, but continues to visit Mike whom he loves and his love is reciprocated.  The manner in which the film ends is yet another act of sacrifice and love and is best left unsaid.Both Marcel Schlutt and Mike Sale are handsome of face and body and spirit and the story benefits from their on-screen chemistry.In an extended Feature on the DVD each actor (both openly gay) discusses his approach to making the film, and as in the movie itself, these dialogues are in both German and English.  The men speak frankly and bravely about their participation in gay porn movies, stating the sex scenes  in the film are real-time and not simulated.  People will argue about the propriety of this but keep in mind the story and the director's background and perhaps the film will be more readily viewed as an experimental genre.  This is a different kind of love story and I think it works!

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[16, 17]","German Caucasian Dennis (Marcel Schlutt) gets sent to a German prison for credit-card fraud and falls for Mike (Mike Sale), an African American (?) who is serving a sentence of fifteen years for murdering his wife. What you expect in a prison movie is here: the gang cliques, the drug activity, the violence, the crooked guards and of course more sex than on a Saturday in a New Orleans House of Prostitution.Although this film is not rated, there is frontal and backal nudity galore, some S & M activity-- for instance, a scene where the bigger, stonger inmates line up and spit on one of their ""punks""-- visual masturbation and a gang rape. So is the movie pornographic? You be the judge. Pornography, for my money, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. A supreme court justice once said he couldn't define pornography but he knew it when he saw it. The photographer Tom Bianchi would say that whether or not something is pornographic depends on the artistic ability of the artist. Certainly Robert Mapplethorpe photographed and exhibited in world class galleries images that make some of these look tame by comparison.Not everybody acts in this film.

859424,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B00064AFF0,James Morris,"[1, 1]","This film is more than a bit amateurish, and not particularly well acted.  The plot, such as it is, is standard prison fare, and offers nothing fresh in the way of insight, plot or situation.  If you are looking for some soft-core gay porno with an entirely disposable plot, you may find that it's worth the investment, but I wouldn't describe it as much more than that.  Both leads are fairly nice looking, but I am tired of gay video producers who think all they need to ""sell the product"" are pretty faces and developed muscles.Also, if you're going to present a character as someone who was born in the US and raised in NYC, it's not a good idea to cast someone with a thick cockney accent, as the producers did with the black character here.  There are those film buffs who seem to be satisfied as long as a gay film has sexy people or situations, and I am weary of video productions that take this for granted.I agree with the reviewer who suggested that you make sure to watch the ""interview"" section of the special features - it's a hoot.  The two leads confess that they were really having sex in the sex scenes (something I've never heard of in a non-porno film).  In fact, the white guy didn't seem to be very sure whether or not this is a porno film, while the other clearly cared only about his paycheck.  Really funny moments occur in the interviews when the white guy relates that things really heated up when he confessed to his co-star that he has fantasies about having sex with black men.  In the next interview, the black guy says everything was fine until his co-star confessed his fantasies, and it's a real turn-off for him when white men approach him and say they have fantasies about black guys.

I really enjoyed it even though I don't speak German. The plot is very good. It is not boring at all. The guys are very good looking with nice bodies. There is a good amount of frontal nudity. They try to give good shots of the naked, nicely built guys.I can't criticize this movie because I don't know if my experience was due to the Amazon's VIDEO ON DEMAND rental or if it was the movie itself. I will criticize ON DEMAND below. But my problem with the video was that although you got good shots of the men's bodies (and quite often), the details of their genitals were not clear--such as the distinction between the head and the shaft. It was hard telling for sure who was circumcised and who was not. So those details were not clear. But their bodies were nice and I enjoyed the movie anyway.The movie contains one rape scene, sodomy, several masturbation scenes, and nice shower scenes. I don't remember seeing any oral sex.

I thought I'd try another to be sure it was NOT the movie. The pictures are not sharp and you may have to spend time adjusting the lighting to get the best picture.2) Although the UnBox player will allow you to maximize the picture to fill the screen, the resolution Amazon provides is not good enough to benefit from the feature. They give you just enough but nothing more. When i maximized the screen, the movie was HORRIBLE. I could not tell the different between the people and the white wall behind them. Sunlight or any type of light was too bright and prevented the people from being seen.  So the movie has to be watched without the greatest possible viewing space.3) The subtitles weren't always legible because of the bad resolution and quality of the downloads.

The black character from ""New York"" with a very proper vocabulary, British Accent and not a masculine streak in his body, made this a comedy for me.  I guess he grew up on tea and a bisquit in the Bronx.  The story possibly had potential but was completely ruined.  The ""romantic gaze"" when the 2 prisoners see each other was ackward and unless you know that's what it's supposed to be you'd think they were crusing or maybe just slow.  The acting was HORRIBLE and I am not sure about prisoner's making coffee in their cells and eating together at a lovely little gay table in the cell.  AND YES!  The subtitles had spelling errors!  It only deserves 1 star but REALLY IS worth seeing just for laughs.  There is A LOT of frontal nudity (why I bought it!) and that was hot and the only reason I gave it 2 stars.  HBO and OZ should sue this film maker for putting their name on the case of the DVD!

Do they put prisoners guilty of credit card fraud in with hardened, violent criminals?  Maybe they do.  It's been a long time since I was in a German prison, but do they really let you pick your own cellmates, bring your own furniture, decorate the walls, have your pets, make your own coffee?  The warden asks at what point, ""What do you think this is?  A hotel?""  The answer is, I guess, ""Yes!""The actors were horrible, with a couple of exceptions.  Mike Sale is the worst offender.  He sounds about as American as Queen Elizabeth.  David Parstein gives a sympathetic performance as the wimpy little doormat Kevin.  Better still is Marcel Schlutt.  Yes, he is apparently a big porn star in Europe and is very nice looking, but in this movie at least, he is actually quite sweet and vulnerable.  It would be interesting to see if he would be able to make it in more mainstream movies.  Probably not, but it would be nice to see him in something better.I think this turkey deserves one star, but I'm giving it two because of Schlutt's performance.
