I really enjoy Ana Caban as an instructor; years ago, I started doing Pilates with another video series on which she was the teacher, and both her explanations and her manner were great.  We got this video to help my husband get started, because he has a lot of back and ankle problems.  Thanks to the gentle introduction and instruction, he no longer walks crookedly when he gets up in the morning, he hasn't thrown his back out shoveling all the snow this winter, and his flexibility is remarkably improved.  Men should take notice! Pilates isn't a &#34;girly&#34; exercise!  (It took me a long time to convince him, but it finally paid off.)",5,"Very easy level, but a great teacher",1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,899,"['true', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'very', 'long', 'catch', 'techniques', 'forms', 'quickly', 'having', 'correct', 'form', 'body', 'positioning', 'very', 'important', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'most', 'benefit', 'not', 'injure', 'Pilates', 'exercises', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'instructor', 'years', 'started', 'doing', 'Pilates', 'video', 'series', 'was', 'teacher', 'explanations', 'manner', 'were', 'great', 'got', 'video', 'help', 'husband', 'get', 'started', 'lot', 'back', 'ankle', 'problems', 'Thanks', 'gentle', 'introduction', 'instruction', 'no', 'longer', 'walks', 'crookedly', 'when', 'up', 'morning', ""n't"", 'thrown', 'back', 'out', 'shoveling', 'snow', 'winter', 'flexibility', 'remarkably', 'improved', 'Men', 'should', 'take', 'notice', 'Pilates', ""n't"", '34', 'girly', '34', 'exercise', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'convince', 'finally', 'paid', 'off']",Easy Pilates
801066,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B0001DHSFQ,C. Daly,"[58, 59]","For those who are new to exercise in general and want to try Pilates out, this DVD can't be beat.  Ana discusses the Pilates method and gives an overview of basic exercises that show up often in Pilates workouts (the hundred, roll-ups, single leg circles, rolling like a ball, single leg stretch, double leg stretch, spine stretch, and the saw).  She does each movement slowly to emphasize the importance of proper form.  Furthermore, she does half the reps in an easier, modified way, then half in the traditional way, although she says you can continue to do the modifications if that's what you feel comfortable with.This is mainly an instructional video.  It is 30 minutes, but Ana is talking much of that time.  It is not much of a workout, instead the emphasis is on learning to do the exercises correctly.  Learning this is extremely valuable to a Pilates practice, but once you get the movements down, this DVD is quickly outgrown.  I'm glad I only rented it because I probably won't use it again, since I already know the basics and require a somewhat more challenging workout.  However, I rate it five stars because it is so valuable to those who are totally new to the practice and not in shape.For some people, this DVD will be way too easy even if they have never taken Pilates.  I also recommend Ana's Beginning Mat Workout, which still contains a lot of instruction and modification options for beginners, but is more challenging and has more exercises.",5,Thorough but quickly outgrown overview,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,1468,"['who', 'are', 'new', 'exercise', 'general', 'want', 'try', 'Pilates', 'out', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'Ana', 'Pilates', 'method', 'overview', 'basic', 'exercises', 'show', 'up', 'often', 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'hundred', 'roll-ups', 'single', 'leg', 'circles', 'rolling', 'ball', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'double', 'leg', 'stretch', 'spine', 'stretch', 'saw', 'movement', 'slowly', 'emphasize', 'importance', 'proper', 'form', 'Furthermore', 'reps', 'easier', 'modified', 'way', 'then', 'half', 'traditional', 'way', 'can', 'continue', 'do', 'modifications', 'what', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'with.This', 'mainly', 'instructional', 'video', '30', 'minutes', 'Ana', 'talking', 'much', 'time', 'not', 'much', 'workout', 'instead', 'emphasis', 'learning', 'do', 'exercises', 'correctly', 'Learning', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'Pilates', 'practice', 'once', 'get', 'movements', 'down', 'DVD', 'quickly', 'outgrown', ""'m"", 'glad', 'only', 'rented', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'use', 'again', 'already', 'know', 'basics', 'require', 'somewhat', 'more', 'challenging', 'workout', 'However', 'rate', 'five', 'stars', 'so', 'valuable', 'who', 'are', 'totally', 'new', 'practice', 'not', 'shape.For', 'people', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'even', 'have', 'never', 'taken', 'Pilates', 'also', 'recommend', 'Ana', 'Beginning', 'Mat', 'Workout', 'still', 'lot', 'instruction', 'modification', 'options', 'beginners', 'more', 'challenging', 'more', 'exercises']",Easy Pilates

I was already doing a lot of core type work with programs like Baron Baptiste's ""Core Power"" and others, but Pilates has added another dimension to my daily practice that has been profound! I'm seeing muscles in my torso that were never as pronounced before and theres no doubt that Pilates has been the key!I found this program to be very gentle and could be used by someone brand new to Pilates as well as someone already familiar with the system. It can also be used as a gentle and relatively short routine to use on days when someone wants to do some Pilates but doesn't want to push too hard.This program begins with Ana Caban explaining the basic principles of Pilates before leading you through a gentle series of exercises. All are shown with modifications so they should be doable by anyone in reasonably good health. Even though these are simple exercises you can really get in touch with your core.Ana Caban is a really pleasent and inspiring teacher to practice with and I look forward to working with this some more. I can see that I may add this to the collection for days when I want to go easy but get some Pilates in (I do already have her beginning and intermediate matwork programs.)I would also recommend reading Alycea Ungaro's ""Pilates, Body In Motion"" if you'd like to get even more detailed, pose by pose instruction on this wonderful system of self care.

I had 15 years of yoga experience and 10 of dance and I went out and got an intermediate DVD thinking I was ready for anything. Wrong. I found myself confused about what to do with my feet, and what's this leg squeezing talk all about? What the heck is the ""powerhouse"" exactly? Years of ballet had taught me to ""turn out"", but was that the same as a Pilates turn out?I decided to go back to square one and really learn Pilates. I have no regrets. Now I have beginner DVDs to loan friends!This DVD clearly lays out the principles and gets you going.  If you are out of shape, you will feel this. If you have poor posture, you will notice that your alignment is getting better. I am now doing advanced Pilates, but there are some things on this DVD that I still go back to.

It is for real beginners, but is great if you are just starting out on pilates like me. Ana Caban goes through all the basics slowly, I found it very helpful in isolating my powerhouse.After my workout yesterday I felt it...there are a few moves that I find challenging as I am not very flexible. I have just had my second c-section, so some workouts are just impossible for me. Anyone needing a bit of a challenge sould not get this, but if you are like me (just staring out...it is great) another great one is Gaiam's &quot;Pilates for beginners&quot;. It has 3 people at different levels that are all doing the same routine, so you can work up to the advanced level all with the one DVD, it also goes through the fundamentals step by step first.I will most likely only use this DVD until I get a bit more limber and then move onto something a bit more challenging. One more thing...if you have both a VCR and a DVD player, get the VHS tape as there is no extras on the DVD...just the workout. save yourself some money!!Best of luck!!",4,great for real beginners!,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,1091,"['have', 'just', 'completed', 'second', 'workout', 'DVD', 'real', 'beginners', 'great', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'pilates', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'basics', 'slowly', 'found', 'very', 'helpful', 'isolating', 'powerhouse.After', 'workout', 'yesterday', 'felt', 'are', 'few', 'moves', 'find', 'challenging', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'flexible', 'have', 'just', 'had', 'second', 'c-section', 'workouts', 'are', 'just', 'impossible', 'Anyone', 'needing', 'bit', 'challenge', 'sould', 'not', 'get', 'are', 'just', 'staring', 'out', 'great', 'great', 'one', 'Gaiam', 'quot', 'Pilates', 'beginners', 'quot', '3', 'people', 'different', 'levels', 'are', 'doing', 'same', 'routine', 'can', 'work', 'up', 'advanced', 'level', 'one', 'DVD', 'also', 'fundamentals', 'step', 'step', 'first.I', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'only', 'use', 'DVD', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'limber', 'then', 'move', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'have', 'VCR', 'DVD', 'player', 'get', 'VHS', 'tape', 'extras', 'DVD', 'just', 'workout', 'save', 'money', 'Best', 'luck']",Easy Pilates
