(It's the equivalent to criticizing Apple!) Clearly his fans are as bitter and distrustful as he is in this show. I love George - I agree with him more than I don't. But this outing is full of venom and is sometimes painful to watch. It's not because he's wrong - he's mostly right. But he used to make his point without being so over-the-top. He just sounds like a bitter old man who didn't get what he wanted out of life. He's got a major chip on his shoulder and vomits the result all over the audience. He was more effective when his sledgehammer was covered with a velvet sock. Once in a while he throws in the odd, subtle, sarcastic bit of old but then falls right back into this major rant that reasonable people would tend to want to dismiss. One of George's problems is that his target audience is college students. And we all know how useless they've become at effecting change. Heck, he even insults them point blank and they continue hooting and hollering, blissfully oblivious to George's message. This is much more apparent in his ""Back in Town"" concert. As much as I like him I doubt he converted anyone who was not already on his side.",3,Not George's best,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,1289,"['Judging', 'for/against', 'ratings', 'given', 'negative', 'clear', 'one', 'MUST', 'NOT', 'AT', 'ALL', 'COST', 'diss', 'George', 'god', 'Carlin', 'equivalent', 'criticizing', 'Apple', 'Clearly', 'fans', 'are', 'bitter', 'distrustful', 'show', 'love', 'George', 'agree', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'outing', 'full', 'venom', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'watch', 'not', 'wrong', 'mostly', 'right', 'used', 'make', 'point', 'being', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'just', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'wanted', 'life', 'got', 'major', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'result', 'audience', 'was', 'more', 'effective', 'when', 'sledgehammer', 'was', 'covered', 'velvet', 'sock', 'Once', 'while', 'odd', 'subtle', 'sarcastic', 'bit', 'old', 'then', 'right', 'back', 'major', 'rant', 'reasonable', 'people', 'would', 'tend', 'want', 'dismiss', 'One', 'George', 'problems', 'target', 'audience', 'college', 'students', 'know', 'how', 'useless', ""'ve"", 'become', 'effecting', 'change', 'Heck', 'even', 'insults', 'point', 'blank', 'continue', 'hooting', 'hollering', 'blissfully', 'oblivious', 'George', 'message', 'much', 'more', 'apparent', 'Back', 'Town', 'concert', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'doubt', 'converted', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'already', 'side']",N/A

Yes, I'm old.I saw him in concert the day my dad died (talk about going from a high to a low!), and so admired him when he announced he was taking a break and proceeded to sit on his stool on stage, drinking water and doing nothing.  The audience loved it!I've always considered this man a genius in his ability to see things as they really are and not be afraid to express his opinions.This dvd is no exception.  He is hysterically funny.... until the very end.  Then you can sense his anger.  I heard that he'd never been the same since the death of his wife, however I've never checked Snopes. That might explain this.It didn't turn me off, but rather I wondered how the rest of his audience reacted to some of the things he was saying.  And honestly it made it hard for me to figure out which side of the fence he was on.But all in all I'm so glad I bought this dvd.  Like I said, I always admired and respected the man.  And I love anyone who can make me laugh.If you feel the same, by all means get this dvd.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of honest, raw, and cynical humor, with a warning that the end is a little different.God Bless George!May he rest in peace.xox",4,In Memory of George,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,1287,"['have', 'loved', 'George', '50', 'when', 'did', 'Ozark', 'Airline', 'commercials', 'billboards', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'old.I', 'saw', 'concert', 'day', 'dad', 'died', 'talk', 'going', 'high', 'low', 'so', 'admired', 'when', 'announced', 'was', 'taking', 'break', 'proceeded', 'sit', 'stool', 'stage', 'drinking', 'water', 'doing', 'nothing', 'audience', 'loved', ""'ve"", 'always', 'considered', 'man', 'genius', 'ability', 'see', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'express', 'opinions.This', 'dvd', 'exception', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'very', 'end', 'Then', 'can', 'sense', 'anger', 'heard', ""'d"", 'never', 'been', 'same', 'death', 'wife', 'however', ""'ve"", 'never', 'checked', 'Snopes', 'might', 'explain', 'this.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'rather', 'wondered', 'how', 'rest', 'audience', 'reacted', 'things', 'was', 'saying', 'honestly', 'made', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'side', 'fence', 'was', 'on.But', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'dvd', 'said', 'always', 'admired', 'respected', 'man', 'love', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'same', 'means', 'get', 'dvd', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'type', 'honest', 'raw', 'cynical', 'humor', 'warning', 'end', 'little', 'different.God', 'Bless', 'George', 'May', 'rest', 'peace.xox']",N/A
