369198,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6303323197,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 5]","Working my way through a list of independent films missed through the ages, I stumbled upon this well placed little feature that has a strong cult following, but seemingly missed through my previous channels.  I had to see Lou Ferrigno fight Andy Dick.  This could not be a missed opportunity.  So, in one quick evening, it was watched.  Chuckles happened, funny moments were remembered, and, alas, this film won't be watched again.  ""...and God Spoke"" has a great concept, a dedicated cast, but where it falls short is the potential.  The idea of making a grandiose big-budget feature of ""The Bible"" is comic genius, and our two guides through this project, Michael Riley and Stephen Rappaport, are perfect as the producer/director pair.  What makes ""...and God Spoke"" work is that it takes you from pre-production of this epic disaster all the way through distribution and finally reaching the status it deserves.  Typically, with a film like this, it ends on a goofy note that is both unbelievable and sappy, but this one will remind the viewer of any cult phenomenon and what steps needed to happen (or stories) to allow it to reach such proportions.  It has been said that this film carries quite a cult standing in LA and the film regions of California due to how it shows the interaction of all levels on a film set.  The arguing of an AD to the obnoxious behavior of the crew, this film apparently does a great job of showing the detailed background of film production.  For this, I applaud ""...and God Spoke"".  It is a dedicated comedy that tries hard to force the laugh, genuinely does at most points, but remains true to the finer points of the story.As mentioned before, ""...and God Spoke"" is a decent entry into the mockumentary category for 1993, but alas, it has not held up well over time.  With the birth of Christopher Guest, and his growing popularity with mimic B-films, coupled with instant classics like ""This is Spinal Tap"", you can literally drop your hand into the hypothetical film bowl and pull one out every time.  It either has to be completely indie-cult in today's terms or so ""big-name"" (i.e. Guest's cronies or David Wain's group) for it to stick and stay.  ""...and God Spoke"" seemed to have that potential, but used backwards thinking which ultimately hurt the overall picture.  They used smaller names, of which had trouble being ""funny"" on camera, and instead of laughing I found myself just chuckling at the thick comedy.  Because of the lack of quality with the actors and the jokes, the presentation was drowning and hurting the film.  There were funny moments, but what made me chuckle the most were not the actors (sorry, the AD Michael Hitchcock, a Guest regular, was the only one giving 100%), but the ideas behind the story.  The zany mistakes that these two professionals were creating were funny, the cinematographer was not funny, but the fact that he idolized Bergman was funny.  The actors playing Adam & Eve, or even Jesus for that matter, were not funny, but the situations they were placed in were funny.  Their costumes were funny, their special effects were funny, their placement into the film was funny, but they - the actors themselves - were not as funny as they could be.  Andy Dick is funny, but he seemed to be swimming in a shallow pool with this film.  Soupy ... well ... I don't even think he knew what he was doing in this film.What was most enjoyable about this film was the ending.  Without giving it away, I liked the direction that ""...and God Spoke"" pushed itself into.  There could have been a very dark element looming overhead near the end, but instead it really demonstrated the birth of something different.  One could watch this film and question if ""Donnie Darko"" fell prey to similar stories during its production, and now see where it is today.  It was almost like watching the birth of ""cult"".  Again, there were elements in this film that made me laugh, and I will always remember the fight over how many apostles there were and how that final scene of Jesus in the water was cut - these were funny moments.  I just wish the actors pushed their characters a bit more.  One could argue that there were no defined characters, but outside of Rappaport and Riley, the others just walked through hoping the audience would continue to laugh, even though their comedy button was obviously in the ""off"" position.Overall, I was neutral about this film.  I laughed.  I chuckled.  I watched all 80+ minutes of this film, but I don't think I could do it again.  ""...and God Spoke"" begins with a running start, but finishes with a brisk walk.  It had concepts that were hysterically funny if put with better composed comedy actors, but those involved either didn't understand the full purpose of the picture, or were just trying to upscale those in the scenes before.  There was a lack of conformity between everyone, and it blasted through the screen as I watched.  Did it want to be a mockumentary or something in the same category as ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" - the world may never know.  On the other side, there are moments that will keep me chuckling for days (Noah's complaining about the animals, Jesus walking on water), but there were other moments that just seemed more like ""ugh"" instead of comedy.  I blame a bit of this one time and expansion of the style of this film.  It doesn't stand us as well over the past 14 years, and Guest has taken it to a new level.  I couldn't personally watch it again, but could suggest a friend or two to pick it up.  Watch it, but don't expect to love it.  I can see the cult following, but it is more regionalized.Grade: ** out of *****",2,What? No behind the scenes to this behind the scenes film?

That is the plot, but that is only the spine that holds all the gags together.  The characters are the main attraction here.Clive Walton (the ""director"") and Marvin Handleman (the ""producer"") are from the start obviously not fit to handle this kind of undertaking--their previous films were all bad genre flicks.  But Marvin thinks that this will be a great idea because of the target audience (""the biggest selling book in the world times seven dollars a ticket...you do the math"").  The caterer designs refreshments that follow the biblical theme (rolls and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish for the ""loaves and fishes"" motif, and a cooler labeled ""Wine"" that he says is ""really just water""); ""Adam"" is a method actor who walks around the set nude; and ""Eve"" has a full-body tattoo.  Not to mention the cinematographer who thinks he is shooting a Bergman film, ""God"" played by a tripped-out ex-hippie, Eve Plumb from The Brady Bunch as ""Mrs. Noah,"" and Soupy Sales as ""Moses"" (who receives Coca-Cola in addition to Commandments from the mountaintop).It's a consistently funny look at moviemaking behind the scenes when everything that can go wrong does.

A film-making team--comprised of a director and producer whose resumes consist primarily of ultra-forgettable, less-than-B movies--basically are stricken with oversized egos and attempt to make the ultimate Bible epic. Of course, during the process everything goes wrong (think of the ""stonehenge"" debacle in Spinal Tap). For those not familiar with this film, I think an example or two may be in order just as a teaser:--""Does anybody know how many disciples there were?""--As the budget starts getting tight on the production, they start cutting out major portions of the story, and nearly decide to cut Jesus out of the picture entirely!!!--The actor who plays Abel (none other than scrawny Andy Dick) thinks that his character actually wins the fight with Cain (played by Lou ""The Hulk"" Ferrigno), and is excited to finally be playing a ""tough guy"" after consistently playing nerdy characters in his film career. Then, of course, he learns the truth....The main problem, as evidenced by the examples, is that nobody involved in the film production actually has any real knowledge of what it is they are filming. I think that should give you some idea of the utter chaos which that creates.This is an absolutely HILARIOUS film, and deserves much more recognition from the entertainment world.

White ""impossiblefunky""","[0, 0]","Arthur Bowman's mockumentary chronicles the troubled production of filmmakers Clive Walton (Michael Riley) and Marvin Handleman's (Stephen Rappaport) biblical epic, ...AND GOD SPOKE.  Playing like a THIS IS SPINAL TAP for the indie movie crowd, Bowman's film is a witty farce which undoubtedly inspired films like LIVING IN OBLIVION, THE INDEPENDENT, HOLLYWOOD NORTH, and THE REAL OLD TESTAMENT.Rather than setting Clive and Marvin up for eventual failure, the audience is made privy to their previous stellar achievements (DIAL ""S"" FOR SEX and NUDE NINJAS).  We know that these guys are clueless as they wax philosophic about the built-in audience for a Bible picture (""You can't lose adapting that book"").  While the initial draft of their script came in at over two thousand pages, Clive and Martin cut out some of the slower moving scenes from Acts and Deuteronomy.Between the dysfunctional crew led by assistant director Bob (Michael Hitchcock of BEST IN SHOW fame) and the never-ending incompetence (only eight disciples have been cast), the studio bankrolling...AND GOD SPOKE quickly loses the confidence in the production. Reminiscent of the Exodus, Moses soon becomes the last, best hope for Clive and Marvin.  Putting in an incredible performance as the liberator of the Israelites, Soupy Sales nearly steals the show from his perch on Mount Sinai's stand-in.Other highlights include the overly-choreographed fight between Cain (Lou Ferrigno) and Abel (Andy Dick), the savvy dialogue (""Doing the Bible without Jesus is like doing FITZCARRALDO without the boat!"") and the oddly familiar faces of the cast (look for Chris Kattan as a disappointed movie patron and Leonard Walsh, the unofficial spokesman for Wendy's, as an obsessive caterer).  ...AND GOD SPOKE is a movie made for movie lovers.",4,chronicles the troubled production of filmmakers,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,1802,"['Arthur', 'Bowman', 'mockumentary', 'chronicles', 'troubled', 'production', 'filmmakers', 'Clive', 'Walton', 'Michael', 'Riley', 'Marvin', 'Handleman', 'Stephen', 'Rappaport', 'biblical', 'epic', 'GOD', 'SPOKE', 'Playing', 'THIS', 'IS', 'SPINAL', 'TAP', 'indie', 'movie', 'crowd', 'Bowman', 'film', 'witty', 'farce', 'undoubtedly', 'inspired', 'films', 'LIVING', 'IN', 'OBLIVION', 'THE', 'INDEPENDENT', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'NORTH', 'THE', 'REAL', 'OLD', 'TESTAMENT.Rather', 'setting', 'Clive', 'Marvin', 'up', 'eventual', 'failure', 'audience', 'made', 'privy', 'previous', 'stellar', 'achievements', 'DIAL', 'S', 'FOR', 'SEX', 'NUDE', 'NINJAS', 'know', 'guys', 'are', 'clueless', 'wax', 'philosophic', 'built-in', 'audience', 'Bible', 'picture', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', 'adapting', 'book', 'initial', 'draft', 'script', 'came', 'two', 'thousand', 'pages', 'Clive', 'Martin', 'cut', 'out', 'slower', 'moving', 'scenes', 'Acts', 'Deuteronomy.Between', 'dysfunctional', 'crew', 'led', 'assistant', 'director', 'Bob', 'Michael', 'Hitchcock', 'BEST', 'IN', 'SHOW', 'fame', 'never-ending', 'incompetence', 'only', 'eight', 'disciples', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'studio', 'bankrolling', 'GOD', 'SPOKE', 'quickly', 'confidence', 'production', 'Reminiscent', 'Exodus', 'Moses', 'soon', 'last', 'best', 'hope', 'Clive', 'Marvin', 'Putting', 'incredible', 'performance', 'liberator', 'Israelites', 'Soupy', 'Sales', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'perch', 'Mount', 'Sinai', 'stand-in.Other', 'highlights', 'include', 'overly-choreographed', 'fight', 'Cain', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'Abel', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'savvy', 'dialogue', 'Doing', 'Bible', 'Jesus', 'doing', 'FITZCARRALDO', 'boat', 'oddly', 'familiar', 'cast', 'look', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'patron', 'Leonard', 'Walsh', 'unofficial', 'spokesman', 'Wendy', 'obsessive', 'caterer', 'GOD', 'SPOKE', 'movie', 'made', 'movie', 'lovers']",And God Spoke VHS

However, those things aside, I love this film.It's a hilarious mockumentary detailing the making of a Bible movie by two Jewish filmmakers.  This minor detail is never mentioned in the movie, but it informs a lot of what happens, such as no one knowing how many disciples Jesus had.Basically, it goes like this:  if you like satire and witty dialogue, you'll like this film.  I'd reccomend it to fans of movies as diverse as the Player and Dogma.  If you like big slapstick comedies, avoid this like plague.Personally I like both.  But a friend who loves the Farrelly brothers above all things found it boring.  So be warned, grasshopper, before taking a plunge into 'the greatest non-denominational bible story ever filmed.
