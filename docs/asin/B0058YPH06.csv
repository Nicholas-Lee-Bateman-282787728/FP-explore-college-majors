What I liked best about this show was that it incorporates characters and issues about being deaf into the show itself. Too often these days you do not see deaf characters in shows so the deaf culture in America remains invisible. I commend this show for bringing this into the show. Outside of this though I found the characters to be completely believable and the plot of the story was engaging and entertaining. You will find that the messages with the show are family friendly and that it does get into issues of relating adoption as well as family values, parenting and unconditional love.

1445913,A1OR572N2VTUAD,B0058YPH06,David Patrick,"[1, 2]","I don't watch a lot of current TV, preferring some of the older, classic stuff.  But I became very fond of this show very, very quickly.  It's not without the occasional contrivances, and there are times when a ""situation"" is conveniently wrapped up in 45 minutes, but this is a TV show, after all.  All around, though, this program has some of the best characters - both written and acted - that you are likely to see.  The two lead actresses are really worth their weight in gold, but the whole ensemble cast is really well drawn out - not a bad actor among them.  I liked this show so much that I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop: For it to start out good and then turn silly, but so far it hasn't happened.  My only quip with this DVD is that it only contains 10 episodes.  Why not just include all the episodes from the TOTAL first season once they've aired?

1445914,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0058YPH06,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","""Switched at Birth"" is a unique teen drama series that manages to capture the life of the American teenager but also inclusion of storylines that center around those who are deaf.The opening premiere gave the ABC Family network its highest-rated premiere with 22-episodes being planned for release in 2012, ABC Family is now releasing the first ten episodes on DVD via ""Switched at Birth: Volume One"".""Switched at Birth"" is a series that focuses on two families, one family is the wealthy Kennish family featuring former Kansas City Royals baseball player John Kennish (played by D.W. Moffett, ""Thirteen"", ""Traffic"", ""Falling Down""), his wife Kathryn Kennish (played by Leah Tompson, ""Back to the Future"" films, ""Caroline in the City""), their daughter Bay Kennish (played by Vanessa Marano, ""The Clique"", ""The Brooke Ellison Story"") and son Toby Kennish (played by Lucas Grabeel, ""High School Musical"" films, ""Milk"").The other family is the Vasquez family which consists of single mother Regina Vasquez (played by Constance Marie, ""George Lopez"", ""Selena"") and her daughter Daphne (played by Katie Leclerc, ""Veronica Mars"", ""Flying By"") and Selena's mother Adriana (played by Ivonne Coll, ""Lean on Me"", ""The Godfather: Part II"").The series begins with Bay Kennish wanting to know why she looks so different from her parents. It has always bothered her but when she asks her parents for a favor to do DNA testing, her parents do just that and they find out that Bay is not their true blood daughter and that the hospital made a mistake and their baby was switched at birth with the Vasquez family.So, immediately both families meet and despite Bay initiating the tests, she is not too thrilled that she is not the real blood daughter and to see Daphne, a redhead young woman being raised by a Puerto Rican mother.  She is also deaf.Immediately, after discovering who their true blood daughter is and that their children were switched at birth, knowing that the Vasquez are not in the best financial state, offers to let the Vasquez family to live in the guest room.  Also, it can help the Kennish family get to learn more about their daughter.But immediately, the Kennish family wants Daphne to go to the best school, consider having surgery to give her a chance to hear and a lot of parenting things that go against how Regina has raised her daughter and sure enough, this leads to various rifts between both Regina and Kathryn on how Daphne is to be raised.Meanwhile, Daphne  starts to learn that she gets her fiery temper but also her interest in art through her real blood mother Regina.  And as quick as she found her real mother, Bay now wants to find who her real father is.But because Bay tends to do things without thinking about if first, she and Daphne tend to clash. Especially when it comes to guys as Daphne starts to take a liking to Bay's ex-boyfriend Liam and Bay takes an interest in Daphne's childhood friend Ty.Meanwhile, as the Kennish family are pursuing a lawsuit against the hospital and wanting nothing more but a public apology, they receive distressing news that their lawsuit may not go far, because of something that Regina has done in the past.""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" DVD comes with a total of 10 episodes on two DVD's. Here is a spoiler-less summary of each episode:DISC 1:EPISODE 1 - This is Not a Pipe - Lives change for the Kennish and Vasquez family when they find out that their daughters are not their true daughters but were accidentally switched at birth.EPISODE 2 - American Gothic - While getting used to the Vasquez living with them, for the Kennish family, they are not too sure how they feel about Daphne riding on a motorcycle with Emmett.EPISODE 3 - Portrait of My Father - Bay starts to ask Regina's questions about her biological father, meanwhile John starts to watch Daphne's basketball playing.EPISODE 4 - Dance Amongst Daggers - Bay finds out that Daphne is dating her ex-boyfriend Liam and Daphne finds out that Bay is dating her good friend Ty.EPISODE 5 - Dogs Playing Poker - Toby tries to use Daphne and Emmett face reading skills in winning at gambling.DISC 2:EPISODE 6 - The Persistence of Memory - Kathryn gets Daphne to try out a cooking class at Buckner Hall.EPISODE 7 - The Stag Hunt - Bay and Emmett, along with Daphne go to find out who her father is.  Meanwhile, John and Kathryn's lawsuit against the hospital starts to go awry when it is revealed they have something on Regina.EPISODE 8 - Pandora's Box - Daphne opens Regina's guitar case to find pictures of Bay whens she was younger.  And Regina's secret is revealed.EPISODE 9 - Paradise Lost - After being kicked out of the Kennish home, Regina is trying to make amends with her daughters and with the Kennish family.EPISODE 10 - The Homecoming - Bay's real father Angelo (played by Gilles Marini) comes out of nowhere to visit his daughters.  But does he have other ulterior motives?VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) and for the most part, the picture quality is satisfactory for this drama series. Also, it helps that the series features various settings, including many outdoor shots which definitely makes the PQ for the DVD much better.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven, dialogue is clear and understandable and music comes out quite clear from the front channels. The series is not the type of series that utilizes special effects or the use of the surround channels but if you have a modern home theater receiver and a 5.1 or 7.2 setup, definitely worth selecting audio on all channels on the receiver for a more immersive soundscape.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" surprisingly comes with no special features at all.EXTRAS:""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" comes with a slip cover case plus ""Switched at Birth"" iPod stickers.JUDGMENT CALL:I am definitely enjoying ABC Family's ""Switched at Birth"".  I love the characters but I also love the complexity of how things are between family and friends.For example, to compare with another ABC Family show ""The Secret Life of an American Teenager"", I dislike how everyone from different circles manages to be stuck within their circle (including main characters dating each other within that circle) and everyone gets a long so perfectly.  As much as I have enjoyed the show, those situations tend to be a major pet peeve of mine when it comes to that series.With ""Switched at Birth"", the writers are not afraid to bring in newer characters, even for love interests but then not afraid to move on without certain characters.  Also, nothing is hunky dory with these characters.  There is always drama and just when you think these families are going to click with each other, something will drive them apart.If anything, life is not perfect and writers are not quick to submit to happy endings for these characters.Also, it's interesting how they take on the characters that are deaf.  The series looks convincingly real and I thought that actress Katie Leclerk (who plays Daphne) was actually deaf, until she had a dream she was a normal girl and was talking perfectly.  So, for her to play a deaf girl and having that similar speech pattern, I was quite impressed.  She does a fantastic job playing the role.  As well as actor Sean Berdy who play the role of Emmett.  He may be able to hear, but he can't talk and if anything, his face really tells you what kind of emotion he is feeling.But so far, casting has been spot-on with this series.  Both young and older talents of the series do a wonderful and believable job so far in these ten episodes.While, there are some major developments that take place towards the final three episodes, it'll be interesting to see how the series will go, once the series comes back to television in Jan. 2012.  Things have not always been the best between the Kennish and Vasquez families, especially between Bay and Daphne....but obviously, how things ended in episode 10, you have a feeling that something bad is going to happen between these two characters?But with ten-episodes, I watched each of these episodes in a quick marathon and was pretty captivated to the storyline from beginning to end.  I just wished there was more added to the DVD.  May it be interviews or even special features or gag reel, that would have been great to see.Overall, ""Switched at Birth""  is an enjoyable drama series on ABC Family and I'm hooked!  If you are looking for a very good family drama on television, don't hesitate in giving ""Switched at Birth"" a try!Definitely recommended!",4,"""Switched at Birth"" has quickly become one of my favorite drama series from ABC Family.",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,8660,"['Switched', 'Birth', 'unique', 'teen', 'drama', 'series', 'capture', 'life', 'American', 'teenager', 'also', 'inclusion',

There are so many cases where hearing people can use this (scuba divers for one) and I think it would help the deaf community beyond measure.

The plots twists and the real people situations are done with a great deal of intelligence.  There is great depth in a lot of the dialogue - I absolutely LOVE the signing dialog as well.

The acting is strong, especially the teenage characters, who convey a maturity far beyond their years. The production quality is very good. The soundtrack is usually a subtle piano but really adds a lot.The show is obviously about two families whose kids were switched at birth. However, one of the daughters is deaf and so the show is as much about coping with deafness as it is about the switch at birth. Generally, the show handles deafness tactfully. It's not just the ""poor little deaf girl"". The deaf characters aren't saints and actually have their own foibles.The show does suffer a bit in its plots. The writers seemed to want to give each episode crazy twists, a la Desperate Housewives, but it just doesn't work as well in this show. This isn't a comedy, it's a drama. There aren't that many funny moments. As such, the crazy, out of left field plot twists come off as poorly conceived rather than clever. If anything, it makes the characters themselves look stupid because they always end up making such horrible choices. The show has enough weight just with the acting and emotional drama. I think less ridiculous plots would add, not subtract, from the rest of the show.Overall, this show is one of the more wholesome things on TV these days.",4,drama queens unleashed,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,1329,"['wife', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'were', 'immediately', 'impressed', 'acting', 'strong', 'especially', 'teenage', 'characters', 'who', 'convey', 'maturity', 'far', 'years', 'production', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'usually', 'subtle', 'piano', 'really', 'lot.The', 'show', 'obviously', 'two', 'families', 'kids', 'were', 'switched', 'birth', 'However', 'one', 'daughters', 'deaf', 'so', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'coping', 'deafness', 'switch', 'birth', 'Generally', 'show', 'deafness', 'tactfully', 'not', 'just', 'poor', 'little', 'deaf', 'girl', 'deaf', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'saints', 'actually', 'have', 'own', 'foibles.The', 'show', 'suffer', 'bit', 'plots', 'writers', 'seemed', 'want', 'give', 'episode', 'crazy', 'twists', 'la', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'show', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'drama', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'such', 'crazy', 'left', 'field', 'plot', 'twists', 'come', 'off', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'rather', 'clever', 'anything', 'characters', 'look', 'stupid', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'such', 'horrible', 'choices', 'show', 'enough', 'weight', 'just', 'acting', 'emotional', 'drama', 'think', 'less', 'ridiculous', 'plots', 'would', 'add', 'not', 'subtract', 'rest', 'show.Overall', 'show', 'one', 'more', 'wholesome', 'things', 'TV', 'days']",N/A

Talk about stereotyping!  I also think that Katie LeClerc (Daphne) doesn't really look like a sixteen year-old high school girl.  Perhaps that's because she's really 25.
