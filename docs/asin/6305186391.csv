453780,A34Q0S8PKOJEKP,6305186391,Fred W. Anson (aka &#34;Mr. IT&#34;),"[4, 16]","ELO was one of my ""High School"" bands. I saw them at the Anaheim Convention Center in 1976 and remember it as one of the best rock concerts that I had the privilege of experiencing first hand - hence my interest in this DVD.Seeing this performance through a contemporary lens made me wonder, ""What were we thinking?""  For a start, the musicianship was pretty boring and pedestrian - even hilarious.  Can anything be more amusing than watching classically trained cellists drag their instruments around stage with ""genius in pain"" facial expressions while sawing away (badly) at nothing but whole notes? If there were ever a case for why those of us who play a violin family instrument should stay more focused on good technique than bad showmanship it is ELO!  However if you enjoy watching a bunch of beginning players tear up their bows (literally) by wildly overstated maniacal playing of simple pieces you'll eat this stuff up. (Note: After they broke up I wondered why no orchestras picked  up ELO's string players - now I know)Then there are Jeff Lynne's ""complex"" compositions and arrangements. Perhaps we've become more sophisticated in the ensuing decades but I don't think back in 1979 having all the instruments droning away on simple, predictable chord progressions and silly end of phrase flourishes qualified as complex, creative, or even very interesting. (However I must say that it DID sell a lot of records didn't it?)Another problem with this DVD is the overall production. The sound quality here is just plain awful! It sounds like a really bad ""made for TV"" concert movie. To add insult to injury the cinematographer chose to ""impress us"" with circa 1979 ""state of the art"" visual effects. By today's standards they are ugly, distracting, and annoying.However, I must say that it was a guilty pleasure watching this silly little time capsule of a by-gone era. Yes, indeed the Seventy's were indeed the decade that time forgot BUT here is proof positive that our drug challenged memories aren't lying to us - for better or worse, the `70's really DID happen bad taste and all!",2,Here's proof that the '70's was the decade that taste forgot,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,2096,"['ELO', 'was', 'one', 'High', 'School', 'saw', 'Anaheim', 'Convention', 'Center', '1976', 'remember', 'one', 'best', 'rock', 'concerts', 'had', 'privilege', 'experiencing', 'first', 'hand', 'hence', 'interest', 'DVD.Seeing', 'performance', 'contemporary', 'lens', 'made', 'wonder', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'start', 'musicianship', 'was', 'pretty', 'boring', 'pedestrian', 'even', 'hilarious', 'Can', 'anything', 'be', 'more', 'amusing', 'watching', 'classically', 'trained', 'cellists', 'drag', 'instruments', 'stage', 'genius', 'pain', 'facial', 'expressions', 'sawing', 'away', 'badly', 'nothing', 'whole', 'notes', 'were', 'ever', 'case', 'why', 'who', 'play', 'violin', 'family', 'instrument', 'should', 'stay', 'more', 'focused', 'good', 'technique', 'bad', 'showmanship', 'ELO', 'However', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'bunch', 'beginning', 'players', 'tear', 'up', 'bows', 'literally', 'wildly', 'overstated', 'maniacal', 'playing', 'simple', 'pieces', ""'ll"", 'eat', 'stuff', 'up', 'Note', 'broke', 'up', 'wondered', 'why', 'orchestras', 'picked', 'up', 'ELO', 'string', 'players', 'now', 'know', 'Then', 'are', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'complex', 'compositions', 'arrangements', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'become', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'ensuing', 'decades', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'back', '1979', 'having', 'instruments', 'droning', 'away', 'simple', 'predictable', 'chord', 'progressions', 'silly', 'end', 'phrase', 'flourishes', 'qualified', 'complex', 'creative', 'even', 'very', 'interesting', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'DID', 'sell', 'lot', 'records', 'did', ""n't"", 'problem', 'DVD', 'overall', 'production', 'sound', 'quality', 'here', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'really', 'bad', 'made', 'TV', 'concert', 'movie', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'cinematographer', 'chose', 'impress', 'circa', '1979', 'state', 'art', 'visual', 'effects', 'today', 'standards', 'are', 'ugly', 'distracting', 'annoying.However', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'silly', 'little', 'time', 'capsule', 'by-gone', 'era', 'Yes', 'indeed', 'Seventy', 'were', 'indeed', 'decade', 'time', 'forgot', 'BUT', 'here', 'proof', 'positive', 'drug', 'challenged', 'memories', 'are', ""n't"", 'lying', 'better', 'worse', '70', 'really', 'DID', 'happen', 'bad', 'taste']",N/A
453781,A3L49ID7CT6JB3,6305186391,"GaryShawn ""GC""","[4, 4]",This video was a fantastic find for me. I always loved the &quot;DISCOVERY&quot; album and I thought as a bleary eyes 16 uear old in 1981 I saw on late night television a whole Video Album version of the album but never heard or saw it ever again so i always thought that maybe I had been dreaming until this DVD surfaced. The Wembley concert while not state of the art in quality compared to today's newer concerts is nonetheless fun to watch. Bev Bevan and Jeff Lynne at their peak. The Discovery videos are wonderful in their simplicity and the music is beautiful. if you have never heard this CD in it's entirity buy it the remastered version and listen to it...All I can say is that this is one of my favorite DVDs,5,GREAT!! a wonderful and rare find for ELO fans,1031270400,"09 6, 2002",2002,719,"['video', 'was', 'fantastic', 'find', 'always', 'loved', 'quot', 'DISCOVERY', 'quot', 'album', 'thought', 'bleary', 'eyes', '16', 'uear', 'old', '1981', 'saw', 'late', 'night', 'television', 'whole', 'Video', 'Album', 'version', 'album', 'never', 'heard', 'saw', 'ever', 'again', 'so', 'i', 'always', 'thought', 'maybe', 'had', 'been', 'dreaming', 'DVD', 'surfaced', 'Wembley', 'concert', 'not', 'state', 'art', 'quality', 'compared', 'today', 'newer', 'concerts', 'nonetheless', 'fun', 'watch', 'Bev', 'Bevan', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'peak', 'Discovery', 'videos', 'are', 'wonderful', 'simplicity', 'music', 'beautiful', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'CD', 'entirity', 'buy', 'remastered', 'version', 'listen', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'DVDs']",N/A

I gave this DVD 4 stars only because of the cinematography. With that said... this is definitely a must for any ELO  fan and fans of music from the '70s.For a concert from 1979, I found the  sound quality very good. Don't buy this DVD if you are looking for a  concert originally recorded digitally. It's from the '70's, when the only  things digital were clocks!I did however, find the cinematography POOR  in parts. The director did not seem content on showing the concert, so he  &quot;added&quot; special effects and layering. All he managed was to add  distraction! I found myself yelling at the screen during  &quot;Rockaria!&quot;. Why he just didn't show the band playing is beyond  me.The music and performance make up for the directing bungle. The songs  are great with a finale' that is second to none!I wish their earlier  concerts were available, even if the filming was poor and the sound was  analog.",4,"Roll over Ludwig, ELO has arrived on DVD!

This is nice to have in your collection for ELO/classic rock fans. The sound and picture need some remastering, but this is vintage footage w/great performance. I highly recommend the Zoom DVD between the two, simply because it's the greatest concert I've ever seen on DVD or in person, but this ""Out of the Blue"" DVD does give you a couple of different songs than that one like ""Sweet Talkin' Woman"", which sounded great.
