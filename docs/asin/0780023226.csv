27259,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,0780023226,Blue Leaf,"[0, 0]","VAGABOND is one of my Top 10 favorite films from one of my favorite directors, Agnes Varda. Sandrine Bonnaire won a Cesar award for her cold yet candid portrayal of Mona, a young drifter who wanders the french countryside, void of emotion and indifferent to most of the people she meets. The plot is seemingly simple yet elicits a strong feeling from the audience. The telling of the story is unique in that it begins at the end of the story and works forward. The cinematography depicts the cruel and often empty world that Mona finds herself enveloped by. The story is told in small sections while the audience is held entranced hoping for a glimpse as to why and how the young girl ends up dead, in a frozen ditch, by the side of a road, (this is shown at the very beginning of the film so I am not spoiling anything by revealing it). We care about this young girl even though there is nothing in her personality that should evoke sympathy. Possibly Varda is trying to force the film viewer to see the part of ourselves that feels alienated from the structured indifference of today's society towards the individual and in particular the wounded individual. Vardas direction, along with the superb performance by Bonnaire and the breathtakingly stark cinematography gives us a true masterpiece of French cinema.",5,Varda's Hypnotic Realism,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,1314,"['VAGABOND', 'one', 'Top', '10', 'favorite', 'films', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'Agnes', 'Varda', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'won', 'Cesar', 'award', 'cold', 'yet', 'candid', 'portrayal', 'Mona', 'young', 'drifter', 'who', 'french', 'countryside', 'void', 'emotion', 'indifferent', 'most', 'people', 'plot', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'yet', 'strong', 'feeling', 'audience', 'telling', 'story', 'unique', 'end', 'story', 'forward', 'cinematography', 'cruel', 'often', 'empty', 'world', 'Mona', 'enveloped', 'story', 'told', 'small', 'sections', 'audience', 'held', 'entranced', 'hoping', 'glimpse', 'why', 'how', 'young', 'girl', 'up', 'dead', 'frozen', 'ditch', 'side', 'road', 'shown', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'revealing', 'care', 'young', 'girl', 'even', 'nothing', 'personality', 'should', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'Possibly', 'Varda', 'trying', 'force', 'film', 'viewer', 'see', 'part', 'ourselves', 'feels', 'alienated', 'structured', 'indifference', 'today', 'society', 'individual', 'particular', 'wounded', 'individual', 'Vardas', 'direction', 'superb', 'performance', 'Bonnaire', 'breathtakingly', 'stark', 'cinematography', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'French', 'cinema']",N/A
27260,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,0780023226,"Daniel S. ""Daniel""","[23, 25]","After CLEO FROM 5 TO 7, Criterion released a few weeks ago another movie of french director Agn&egrave;s Varda : VAGABOND. The original title of the movie is SANS TOIT NI LOI which could have been translated WITHOUT ROOF NOR LAW. I don't know whether this last translation makes any sense in english but it sure does in french emphasizing the rebellious side of Sandrine Bonnaire's character.Still at the beginning of her career, Sandrine Bonnaire gives here a performance that deserves the utmost respect. Surrounded by semi professionals or amateurs, she brings Mona to life and death in a stellar performance. Of course, first you have to accept Agn&egrave;s Varda's style, a mixture of (false) documentary and fiction.VAGABOND is the anti-romantic movie by essence. The glorious nature so often depicted by writers and the postcards sent by your lucky friends is replaced by an hostile environment made of mud or frozen water. Sandrine Bonnaire is not wandering through France for fun, she's not heading to the southern part of France in a symbolic search for hope. She just wants to be free and alone. She's the last rebel.No extra-features with this Criterion release except for english subtitles. Great sound and images which will plunge you deep into the sadness of a cold winter.A - no hope - DVD.",4,TO  LIVE  AND  DIE  IN  FRANCE,972259200,"10 23, 2000",2000,1306,"['CLEO', 'FROM', '5', 'TO', '7', 'Criterion', 'released', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'movie', 'french', 'director', 'Agn', 'egrave', 's', 'Varda', 'VAGABOND', 'original', 'title', 'movie', 'SANS', 'TOIT', 'NI', 'LOI', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'translated', 'WITHOUT', 'ROOF', 'NOR', 'LAW', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'last', 'translation', 'sense', 'english', 'sure', 'french', 'emphasizing', 'rebellious', 'side', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'character.Still', 'beginning', 'career', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'here', 'performance', 'utmost', 'respect', 'Surrounded', 'semi', 'professionals', 'amateurs', 'Mona', 'life', 'death', 'stellar', 'performance', 'course', 'first', 'have', 'accept', 'Agn', 'egrave', 'Varda', 'style', 'mixture', 'false', 'documentary', 'fiction.VAGABOND', 'anti-romantic', 'movie', 'essence', 'glorious', 'nature', 'so', 'often', 'depicted', 'writers', 'postcards', 'sent', 'lucky', 'friends', 'replaced', 'hostile', 'environment', 'made', 'mud', 'frozen', 'water', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'not', 'wandering', 'France', 'fun', 'not', 'heading', 'southern', 'part', 'France', 'symbolic', 'search', 'hope', 'just', 'be', 'free', 'alone', 'last', 'rebel.No', 'extra-features', 'Criterion', 'release', 'english', 'subtitles', 'Great', 'sound', 'images', 'will', 'plunge', 'deep', 'sadness', 'cold', 'winter.A', 'hope', 'DVD']",N/A
27261,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,0780023226,.fgd,"[0, 0]","Wow...I saw this film in the 1980s and have been haunted by it since. I have no idea how Sandrine Bonnaire can portray Mona's disassociation and mental illness so convincingly. It would almost take method acting. Yet her remoteness from others is acute or pervasive throughout. The only time Mona pulls together is when she has music or better still music and weed. But as Mona says, she has never enough money to score and portable music players had barely been invented at the time of the film.Some reviews dislike the way some people who knew her talk to the camera because it confuses with the documentary style of others interviewed. Whatever.....this drama has a very real feel to it. I think the philosopher goatherd had it right when he retorted that she had been reading too much trash after listening to her freedom rant. She was a very average young woman who went on the road and got more than she bargained for. He even warned her she would  end up burnt out on it.The saddest aspect is the film is a homage to all those poor folks who fall through the cracks. It is far safer to be diagnosed with a mental disorder and know that you have one than be treated like a normal person who deserve the outcome of poor choices in life and having a bad attitude. Meanwhile Mona acts selfish and willful and her lack of empathy makes her difficult to empathize with at times. Yet even at the start of the film when she is still in good shape, the remote disassociation is evident in her eyes. No-one in the film mentions a borderline or latent mental disorder. I think the director made a film to example those in society who fall between the cracks. Mona looks after number one because she nor anyone else addresses her dilemma. Even the smart philosopher goatherd misses it despite some very  shrewd advice. In her own way she was correct to dismiss him therefore.On the other hand Mona touches us when she responds and seeks non judgmental kindness.The film is enlivened by a quiet ironic humor at times; it is not all doom and gloom.My own theory is a mental disorder or latent one caused by all those mothers who think having a baby is the cutest thing and then an unconditional child for 10 years is rewarding because it is all on their own termsa. But don't want to deal withthe hassel of a developing young adult let alone a grown up daughter.The film is a warning that not all vagrants are  what they seem even if some  are on it to feed addiction. Rather than homeless shelters doubling up as out patient mental institutions, there should be a clearer distinction and better funding",5,Tour de force acting by Bonnaire,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,2596,"['saw', 'film', '1980s', 'have', 'been', 'haunted', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'can', 'portray', 'Mona', 'disassociation', 'mental', 'illness', 'so', 'convincingly', 'would', 'almost', 'take', 'method', 'acting', 'remoteness', 'others', 'acute', 'pervasive', 'only', 'time', 'Mona', 'together', 'when', 'music', 'better', 'still', 'music', 'weed', 'Mona', 'never', 'enough', 'money', 'score', 'portable', 'music', 'players', 'had', 'barely', 'been', 'invented', 'time', 'film.Some', 'reviews', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'talk', 'camera', 'documentary', 'style', 'others', 'interviewed', '..this', 'drama', 'very', 'real', 'feel', 'think', 'philosopher', 'goatherd', 'had', 'right', 'when', 'retorted', 'had', 'been', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'trash', 'listening', 'freedom', 'rant', 'was', 'very', 'average', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'went', 'road', 'got', 'more', 'bargained', 'even', 'warned', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'burnt', 'out', 'it.The', 'saddest', 'aspect', 'film', 'homage', 'poor', 'folks', 'who', 'fall', 'cracks', 'far', 'safer', 'be', 'diagnosed', 'mental', 'disorder', 'know', 'have', 'one', 'be', 'treated', 'normal', 'person', 'who', 'deserve', 'outcome', 'poor', 'choices', 'life', 'having', 'bad', 'attitude', 'Meanwhile', 'Mona', 'selfish', 'willful', 'lack', 'empathy', 'difficult', 'empathize', 'times', 'even', 'start', 'film', 'when', 'still', 'good', 'shape', 'remote', 'disassociation', 'evident', 'eyes', 'No-one', 'film', 'mentions', 'borderline', 'latent', 'mental', 'disorder', 'think', 'director', 'made', 'film', 'example', 'society', 'who', 'fall', 'cracks', 'Mona', 'number', 'one', 'anyone', 'else', 'dilemma', 'Even', 'smart', 'philosopher', 'goatherd', 'very', 'shrewd', 'advice', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'correct', 'dismiss', 'therefore.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Mona', 'touches', 'when', 'non', 'judgmental', 'kindness.The', 'film', 'enlivened', 'quiet', 'ironic', 'humor', 'times', 'not', 'doom', 'gloom.My', 'own', 'theory', 'mental', 'disorder', 'latent', 'one', 'caused', 'mothers', 'who', 'think', 'having', 'baby', 'cutest', 'thing', 'then', 'unconditional', 'child', '10', 'years', 'rewarding', 'own', 'termsa', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'deal', 'withthe', 'hassel', 'developing', 'young', 'adult', 'let', 'alone', 'grown', 'up', 'daughter.The', 'film', 'warning', 'not', 'vagrants', 'are', 'what', 'seem', 'even', 'are', 'feed', 'addiction', 'Rather', 'homeless', 'shelters', 'doubling', 'up', 'patient', 'mental', 'institutions', 'should', 'be', 'clearer', 'distinction', 'better', 'funding']",N/A

The characters lack any development and the storyline suffers from basic stupidity.  We follow a vagrant girl, Mona, who doesn't seem to have any direction in life and no real purpose for being in a film.  In this respect, her character mirrors to actual film.  You watch and wonder what is the point?She seems to always find a source of food though she has no job and no desire to leave her vagrant lifestyle.  She smokes like a chimney and never seems to bathe or change clothes.  She's not respected by anyone she meets.  Then the end gets real weird.  She's attacked in a village by tree people who seem to genuinely scare her (at least she screams when all the other odd-ducks she met didn't seem to phase her).

She doesn't like crowds, she can't be responsible with any money, she smells.I've read a few reviews that put credit in ""how she touches the lives of others.""

Because Hollywood loves and idolizes the free-spirit hippie lifestyle.

He suddenly comes upon a woman, sprawled dead in the frost covered ditch, nothing but an old dirty blanket on her back. Her face is contorted with pain from the cold she suffered. Her hair looks almost gray from being frozen.The police come to investigate, she's got no identification with her.But as the film progresses we learn her name is Mona, short for Simone. In flash backs we see her traveling like a leaf on the wind, never staying in one place for too long, hitching rides, and pitching her tent. Bumming cigarettes, and getting water and bread (sometimes dope) from kind strangers, a few she gets to know, but they never really figure out who she is. But, they agree as they talk to the camera, she's someone they'll never forget.The film takes place during winter, Mona says she likes to travel then because there aren't that many people out, and it's easier to get a ride. Those who she meets, are mostly good, but some bad. She experiences the perils of a young woman traveling alone. Hunger, cold, rape...
