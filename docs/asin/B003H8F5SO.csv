1345773,A91BK8S5QH98K,B003H8F5SO,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[0, 0]","The plot of this movie is really about grief.  As a social worker ends ups caring for a young girl who has just lost her Mother in an unexpected accident.  The social worker lost her own son about two years before and so she has a lot of grieving that she is still going through.  In fact, she and her husband are even feeling the strain on their marriage since they have both been grieving and just wish the ""pain would go away.""  For anyone who has lost someone close to them, that expression alone will echo in their own hearts.  Through a series of events the healing process begins for all involved and they are able to enjoy Christmas.  The main flaw I see in the movie is that at first it is hard to follow who is who.  And the acting in the beginning is a little unemotional and uninvolved.  I will say that all of the female actresses in the movie have massive quantities of very beautiful hair. So in closing, the movie is a good one for those who have experienced grief.  As far as being a good movie in and of itself, it has a lot of potential.  But I do think the lackluster acting in the beginning is a drawback.",3,A Movie About Grief During The Christmas Season.,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,1126,"['plot', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'grief', 'social', 'worker', 'ups', 'caring', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'Mother', 'unexpected', 'accident', 'social', 'worker', 'lost', 'own', 'son', 'two', 'years', 'so', 'lot', 'grieving', 'still', 'going', 'fact', 'husband', 'are', 'even', 'feeling', 'strain', 'marriage', 'have', 'been', 'grieving', 'just', 'wish', 'pain', 'would', 'go', 'away', 'anyone', 'who', 'lost', 'someone', 'close', 'expression', 'alone', 'will', 'echo', 'own', 'hearts', 'series', 'events', 'healing', 'process', 'involved', 'are', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Christmas', 'main', 'flaw', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'hard', 'follow', 'who', 'who', 'acting', 'beginning', 'little', 'unemotional', 'uninvolved', 'will', 'say', 'female', 'actresses', 'movie', 'have', 'massive', 'quantities', 'very', 'beautiful', 'hair', 'So', 'closing', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'experienced', 'grief', 'As', 'far', 'being', 'good', 'movie', 'lot', 'potential', 'do', 'think', 'lackluster', 'acting', 'beginning', 'drawback']",Christmas Hope

I was disappointed on how the movie was not true to the books, the actors were different from the previous movies and did not even fit the physical description of the other books and stories.  The story was a bit changed.  For example, in the book:Emily is five years old and not nine.Justin is a lot younger and story line is completely different in the book.I do not want to spoil the plot for other viewers, so I will end this review with this.
