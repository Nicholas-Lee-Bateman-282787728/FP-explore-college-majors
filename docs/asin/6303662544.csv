384355,A8S11VP9Z36D6,6303662544,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[1, 1]","""The Best of Everything"" is a classic 1959 romantic melodrama featuring the best talent: Joan Crawford, Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, directed by Jean Negulesco, an Oscar-nominated title song sung by Johnny Mathis, and a beautiful score by Alfred Newman. Based on a novel by Rona Jaffe, it is the story of 5 young girls working their way up the steno pool at a publishing firm in New York City. The movie mainly focuses on these 3: Gregg (Parker) who really wants to be an actress, April (Baker) who wants to find Mr. Right, and Caroline (Lange) the main heroine, who initially is just working until her fiance comes back to marry her. Once the fiance unceremoniously dumps her, Caroline becomes a little bitter and decides to climb her way up to the top and replace her boss, the bitchy Amanda Farrow (Joan Crawford). Most of the men in this movie are heels; Louis Jordan plays a theatrical director who Gregg falls in love with, and Robert Evans is a rich playboy who only wants to fool around with April, not marry her. Brian Aherne is the lecherous yet somehow likeable boss of the firm who can't keep his hands off the ladies. Stephen Boyd plays a handsome office drunk who somewhat secretly carries the torch for Caroline.Although the story is a little over the top and of course somewhat predictable, and many will find offense with its less-than positive view on the female role in society, but one must remember that this is a snapshot of the period in which this movie was made. And what a snapshot! The acting is top notch; Crawford gives the character of Amanda Farrow much depth; although we see her bitchy office personna, we also hear her behind-closed-doors phone call to the married man that she loves deeply but is unable to spend time with because she will always be second-rate to him. Crawford is able to generate a level of sympathy for a character that easily could have been 100% rotten. Hope Lange is just glowing in this movie; she is the core of the trio; the one girl who we know in the end will make the best decisions and stick to her moral code. Diane Baker convincingly plays a naive girl who just wants to fall in love, and it is easy to believe her wide-eyed innocence. Suzy Parker is just gorgeous with her mane of red hair cascading all over the place.The widescreen picture and sound are excellent; the colors jump off the screen. This disc features a commentary track that alternates between author Rona Jaffe and film historian Sylvia Stoddard. Each one gives excellent details on the production. Jaffe is able to contrast the book and the movie, and Stoddard gives excellent tidbits about Crawford, deleted scenes, production design, and much more. There is also the theatrical trailer, newsreel footage ""Fox Movietone News: The Best of Everything Premiere,"" as well as trailers for a number of other 20th Century Fox Classics (""All About Eve,"" ""An Affair to Remember,"" ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" ""How Green was my Valley,"" ""How to Steal a Million,"" ""Laura"").Highly recommended as a vintage classic!",4,Classic 50's Drama; A Few Extras,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,3043,"['Best', 'Everything', 'classic', '1959', 'romantic', 'melodrama', 'featuring', 'best', 'talent', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Suzy', 'Parker', 'directed', 'Jean', 'Negulesco', 'Oscar-nominated', 'title', 'song', 'sung', 'Johnny', 'Mathis', 'beautiful', 'score', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'Based', 'novel', 'Rona', 'Jaffe', 'story', '5', 'young', 'girls', 'working', 'way', 'steno', 'pool', 'publishing', 'firm', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'movie', 'mainly', '3', 'Gregg', 'Parker', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'actress', 'April', 'Baker', 'who', 'find', 'Mr', 'Right', 'Caroline', 'Lange', 'main', 'heroine', 'who', 'initially', 'just', 'working', 'fiance', 'back', 'marry', 'fiance', 'unceremoniously', 'Caroline', 'little', 'bitter', 'decides', 'climb', 'way', 'top', 'replace', 'boss', 'bitchy', 'Amanda', 'Farrow', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Most', 'men', 'movie', 'are', 'heels', 'Louis', 'Jordan', 'theatrical', 'director', 'who', 'Gregg', 'love', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'rich', 'playboy', 'who', 'only', 'fool', 'April', 'not', 'marry', 'Brian', 'Aherne', 'lecherous', 'yet', 'somehow', 'likeable', 'boss', 'firm', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'hands', 'ladies', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'handsome', 'office', 'drunk', 'who', 'somewhat', 'secretly', 'torch', 'Caroline.Although', 'story', 'little', 'top', 'course', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'offense', 'less-than', 'positive', 'view', 'female', 'role', 'society', 'one', 'must', 'remember', 'snapshot', 'period', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'what', 'snapshot', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'Crawford', 'character', 'Amanda', 'Farrow', 'much', 'depth', 'see', 'bitchy', 'office', 'personna', 'also', 'hear', 'behind-closed-doors', 'phone', 'call', 'married', 'man', 'deeply', 'unable', 'spend', 'time', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'second-rate', 'Crawford', 'able', 'generate', 'level', 'sympathy', 'character', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', '100', '%', 'rotten', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'just', 'glowing', 'movie', 'core', 'trio', 'one', 'girl', 'who', 'know', 'end', 'will', 'make', 'best', 'decisions', 'stick', 'moral', 'code', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'convincingly', 'naive', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'fall', 'love', 'easy', 'believe', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'Suzy', 'Parker', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'mane', 'red', 'hair', 'cascading', 'place.The', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'colors', 'jump', 'screen', 'disc', 'commentary', 'track', 'author', 'Rona', 'Jaffe', 'film', 'historian', 'Sylvia', 'Stoddard', 'one', 'excellent', 'details', 'production', 'Jaffe', 'able', 'contrast', 'book', 'movie', 'Stoddard', 'excellent', 'tidbits', 'Crawford', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'production', 'design', 'much', 'more', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'Fox', 'Movietone', 'News', 'Best', 'Everything', 'Premiere', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'number', 'other', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Classics', 'Eve', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'How', 'Green', 'was', 'Valley', 'How', 'Steal', 'Million', 'Laura', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'vintage', 'classic']",The Best of Everything VHS
384356,A2HB5ENM2PJAHL,6303662544,Dory P.,"[8, 11]","I am still trying to figure out why I like this film (and so many like it), when in truth, the submissiveness of females and their dependence on the love of a man really sicken me.  The depiction of women in this film is perhaps a bit more progressive than that in other films of this genre, as the women are, at least, ""career women"", and much of the story is set in the office, of a large publishing firm, Fabian Publishing.  However, among the three key friends and principal characters (played by Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, and Diane Baker), Lange's character Caroline Bender is the only one determined to be an editor.  However, at the same time, when her colleague Mike Rice (Stephen Boyd) asks her if she has any ambitions beyond working a year or so, she quite adamantly says ""no..none at all""...so, it's a bit contradictory, and frustrating. And he, of course, says it's ""wonderful"" when she agrees with him that it would be quite satisfying for her to ""get her feet wet in publishing for a year or two to prove what she has ""to prove"", marry a doctor or lawyer, and have babies"".  UGH!!!  But, it's 1959, so, you have to keep it in perspective.Some of the dialog is beyond hope, but I inexplicably continue to watch this film, every so often.  Maybe it's the women's clothing...I love suits, and I miss dressing up for work.  (Business casual has been one of several downfalls of today's workplace, as far as I'm concerned).  No, but really...perhaps it is because I want to see if at least one of these women wakes up and takes stock in her own life, and throws back all of the garbage that her ""sweetheart"" dishes out at her.  Hope Lange does so to a degree when she rhetorically asks her slime-bucket hometown beau Eddie, in paraphrase, ""what is it about men that they think they deserve the most refined, cultured, ""respectable"" women from the ""best schools and the best families"" only ""part-time"", for only fun, but ignore all of the attendant responsibilities that would turn frolic into long-term, serious relationships.""  She then goes on to say that a number of women will play the same game as men, for a while, but eventually, they'll have to pick up a few extra men of their own, to fill in the time when they're not with the one they really want.  I at least admire her honesty about the pitfalls and emptiness of ""casual dating"" and ""hooking up"".The opening credits are very nice...Manhattan in the spring/summertime is always glorious.  Though I need to laugh that it's Johnny Mathis singing the title song, ""The Best of Everything"" (I've always thought that he was a very funny singer...he often breaks what should be long-held notes with silence...perhaps he's breathing, but we don't hear him inhale), it's also perfect....who else would be singing this song for a 1950's movie about finding your way in life and in love.Joan Crawford's boss is in many ways no different from some of the tyrannical maniacs for whom I've had the complete displeasure to work.  Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow was more or less a direct, no holds barred, right-in-your face ""meanie"", telling Hope Lange that she does not have what it takes to become a Reader, much less an Editor.  And, she did it in front of the rest of the typing pool (how unprofessional is that?).  In the 80's, people stabbed you in the back.  In the 90's, and to a degree, now, people smile at you directly, and let you believe all is well, until you're laid off in one life-altering second.I found it inconsistent how the Suzy Parker character started out as an independent, career-minded, aspiring actress, who prided herself on never having needed a man (""to love, and to let go...that's me""), but ended up becoming the most debilitated by the rejection of a man with whom she had fallen in love.  And of course, it's also amazing how Diane Baker, fresh from being thrown out of a speeding car and losing a baby (out of wedlock, no less, in the 1950's!) manages to attract the attention and heart of a young, studly doctor when she's still wearing bandages and no make-up in her hospital bed.

Aren't we the special ones from the best homes and the best colleges? I know the world outside isn't full of rainbows and happy endings, but to you, aren't we even decent?"" ~from ""The Best of Everything"" (1959)The more things change, the more they stay the same. When watching ""The Best of Everything"" it is striking how much things have indeed changed from the days when women went to work in offices wearing with hats and gloves to go with their tailored suits, even in the summer. It is interesting how the girls mostly saw the secretarial jobs as something to do while waiting to get married, not as careers. Some of the older executives took liberties which today would result in a lawsuit. On the other hand, the way women allow themselves to be used by men under the guise of romance and independence is an element of the film which finds an echo in our own time.Based upon the novel by Rona Jaffe, ""The Best of Everything"" deals with the lives of three young women in the jungle of Madison Avenue in the late fifties. Considered scandalous in its time, in some ways it was prophetic of things to come, followed by films such as ""The Apartment"" (1960) and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (1961) about other young females lost in Manhattan. Hope Lange stars as the Ivy League heroine, Caroline Bender who, abandoned by her fianc&eacute;, has to find a way to occupy her time, so she takes a secretarial job at a publishing house. Of all the girls, she becomes enthralled by the challenge of the work itself and begins to aim for success. She is befriended by Mike Rice (Stephen Boyd) who is one of the few gentlemen in the film, in spite of being a bit of a drunk. He does not take advantage of Caroline when, in a heartbroken and intoxicated state, she throws herself at him. Caroline finds herself turning into her boss, Amanda Farrow, played with ferocity by Joan Crawford. Miss Farrow is an independent, powerful executive whom Caroline aims to be and yet, like the other young women, dreads to emulate. Miss Farrow has a glamorous and successful life but no domesticity, which the trio of heroines, whether they want to admit it or not, all long for. Caroline has to decide whether she wants to devote herself totally to glittering success, with uncommitted lovers on the side, or whether she wants to make the compromises demanded by marriage.Caroline's friend April (Diane Baker) is the type of girl who hardly exists anymore, a total innocent. Even the guidance of her slightly more savvy friends cannot deliver her from the seductions of wealthy playboy Dexter, the absolute creep of the movie. April thinks she has found a great romance but in the end, as she says from her hospital bed, ""Now I'm just another person who has had an affair.""Suzy Parker, who was a model and Dorian Leigh's sister, plays the most truly modern heroine, Gregg, of whom there are legions of contemporary counterparts. In her quest to become an actress, Gregg works as a secretary to support herself, but otherwise she wants nothing more from life than fun. The product of a broken home, Gregg, with zesty independence, is willing to play the field in the same way as the men, no strings attached. When she does fall in love, she casts all ambition, dignity, and self-respect aside to become the obsessed handmaid of her lover. When her boyfriend, a Broadway director portrayed by Louis Jourdan, tires of her, Gregg is shattered. Some commentators have said that the Gregg's breakdown is a bit too melodramatic. However, having witnessed friends in the past go through similar anguish, I would hesitate to say that her mental state is entirely far-fetched.By the end of the film, marriage with a respectable man looks almost too good and too unattainable to be true. Ultimately, it is what the heroines were all striving for in their own way, along the crooked paths of modernity, which promise success and sex without enduring love and happiness.",5,The more things change....,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,4016,"['Caroline', 'Bender', 'What', 'women', 'make', 'hold', 'so', 'cheaply', 'Are', ""n't"", 'special', 'ones', 'best', 'homes', 'best', 'colleges', 'know', 'world', 'outside', ""n't"", 'full', 'rainbows', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'decent', 'Best', 'Everything', '1959', 'more', 'things', 'change', 'more', 'stay', 'same', 'When', 'watching', 'Best', 'Everything', 'striking', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'have', 'indeed', 'changed', 'days', 'when', 'women', 'went', 'work', 'offices', 'wearing', 'hats', 'gloves', 'go', 'tailored', 'suits', 'even', 'summer', 'interesting', 'how', 'girls', 'mostly', 'saw', 'secretarial', 'jobs', 'something', 'do', 'waiting', 'get', 'married', 'not', 'careers', 'older', 'executives', 'took', 'liberties', 'today', 'would', 'result', 'lawsuit', 'other', 'hand', 'way', 'women', 'allow', 'be', 'used', 'men', 'guise', 'romance', 'independence', 'element', 'film', 'echo', 'own', 'time.Based', 'novel', 'Rona', 'Jaffe', 'Best', 'Everything', 'deals', 'lives', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'jungle', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'late', 'fifties', 'Considered', 'scandalous', 'time', 'ways', 'was', 'prophetic', 'things', 'come', 'followed', 'films', 'such', 'Apartment', '1960', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', '1961', 'other', 'young', 'females', 'lost', 'Manhattan', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'Ivy', 'League', 'heroine', 'Caroline', 'Bender', 'who', 'abandoned', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'find', 'way', 'occupy', 'time', 'secretarial', 'job', 'publishing', 'house', 'girls', 'enthralled', 'challenge', 'work', 'aim', 'success', 'befriended', 'Mike', 'Rice', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'who', 'one', 'few', 'gentlemen', 'film', 'spite', 'being', 'bit', 'drunk', 'not', 'take', 'advantage', 'Caroline', 'when', 'heartbroken', 'intoxicated', 'state', 'Caroline', 'turning', 'boss', 'Amanda', 'Farrow', 'played', 'ferocity', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Miss', 'Farrow', 'independent', 'powerful', 'executive', 'whom', 'Caroline', 'be', 'yet', 'other', 'young', 'women', 'dreads', 'emulate', 'Miss', 'Farrow', 'glamorous', 'successful', 'life', 'domesticity', 'trio', 'heroines', 'want', 'admit', 'not', 'long', 'Caroline', 'decide', 'devote', 'totally', 'glittering', 'success', 'uncommitted', 'lovers', 'side', 'make', 'compromises', 'demanded', 'marriage.Caroline', 'friend', 'April', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'type', 'girl', 'who', 'hardly', 'anymore', 'total', 'innocent', 'Even', 'guidance', 'slightly', 'more', 'savvy', 'friends', 'can', 'not', 'deliver', 'seductions', 'wealthy', 'playboy', 'Dexter', 'absolute', 'creep', 'movie', 'April', 'found', 'great', 'romance', 'end', 'hospital', 'bed', 'Now', ""'m"", 'just', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'affair', 'Suzy', 'Parker', 'who', 'was', 'model', 'Dorian', 'Leigh', 'sister', 'most', 'truly', 'modern', 'heroine', 'Gregg', 'whom', 'are', 'legions', 'contemporary', 'counterparts', 'quest', 'become', 'actress', 'Gregg', 'secretary', 'support', 'otherwise', 'nothing', 'more', 'life', 'fun', 'product', 'broken', 'home', 'Gregg', 'zesty', 'independence', 'willing', 'play', 'field', 'same', 'way', 'men', 'strings', 'attached', 'When', 'fall', 'love', 'ambition', 'dignity', 'self-respect', 'aside', 'become', 'obsessed', 'handmaid', 'lover', 'When', 'boyfriend', 'Broadway', 'director', 'portrayed', 'Louis', 'Jourdan', 'tires', 'Gregg', 'shattered', 'commentators', 'have', 'said', 'Gregg', 'breakdown', 'bit', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'However', 'having', 'witnessed', 'friends', 'past', 'go', 'similar', 'anguish', 'would', 'hesitate', 'say', 'mental', 'state', 'entirely', 'far-fetched.By', 'end', 'film', 'marriage', 'respectable', 'man', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'too', 'unattainable', 'be', 'true', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'heroines', 'were', 'striving', 'own', 'way', 'crooked', 'paths', 'modernity', 'promise', 'success', 'sex', 'enduring', 'love', 'happiness']",The Best of Everything VHS

This is a glossy soap opera of sorts, which reminds me a lot of films like ""Peyton Place,"" and ""Valley of the Dolls.""  The best scenes in the movie, however, are the ones with ""bitch boss"" Ms Farrow (played wonderfully by screen legend Joan Crawford).  In one memorable scene Joan is on the telephone with her lover, who won't leave his wife for her, so Joan screams into the phone: ""You and your rabbit faced wife can go straight to hell!"" Classic!  And the funny thing is she slams the phone down before she completely finishes her sentence! Hilarious!Caroline is torn between her dreamy ex-fianc&eacute;e Eddie Harris (Bret Halsey ""Return to Peyton Place"" (1961) and office hunk Mike Rice (Stephen Boyd ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964) while moving swiftly up the corporate ladder and into Ms Farrow's office!  Gregg Adams wants to become the toast of Broadway by allowing herself to fall into the hands (and the bed) of the play's director, David Savage (Louis Jourdan ""Gigi"" (1958) which ends in tragedy.  April is seduced by rich and suave Dexter Key (Robert Evans) and believes after she tells him that she is pregnant, they are off to be married -sorry, another tragedy!  It seems Ms Farrow has come to her senses and is giving up the glamorous life for the married life -but then she returns to the office for her old job and says, ""it's just too late for me.""  Caroline comes to her senses and realizes she must give up her dream of winning back Eddie and she and Mike go walking together down the busy New York streets as the credits roll.The dvd transfer is clear and the Technicolor brilliant!

384359,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6303662544,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 2]","Throughout much of the 20th Century, society dictated that a woman's preferred career should be that of wife and mother, and women who worked outside the home were frequently pitied.  THE BEST OF EVERYTHING has precisely this mindset as it follows the unsavory romantic adventures of various women employed by a New York publishing company.  Amanda (Joan Crawford) and Barbara (Martha Hyer) offer cautionary tales of women who have fallen in love with married men, but the story focuses on three younger women who experience romantic disasters of their own.Caroline Bender (Hope Lang) is working until her boyfriend returns returns from out-of-country studies.  When he jilts her, she proves she has both the drive and talent to make a career.  She also attracts the attention of executive Mike Rice (Stephen Boyd), who feels she is wasted in the business world.  April Morrison (Diane Baker) is a somewhat air-headed young woman who slides into an affair with the slimy Dexter Key (Robert Evans) and gets in trouble in more ways than one.  Drop-dead-beautiful Gregg Adams (Suzy Parker) has aspirations of stage stardom and runs afoul of slimy stage director David Savage (Louis Jourdan.)  In between these unpleasantnesses they must endure the pinches and pats of a genuinely male-chauvanist business society and do their best to stay ahead of the boss when he chases them around the desk.Lang, Baker, and Parker are enjoyable, but the real knock-out performance belongs to Joan Crawford, who has less than ten minutes of screen time but who--as one critic famously commented--makes almost everything else about the film seem irrelevant.  She is an embittered woman whose married lover will not leave his wife and she takes out her frustration on various underlings.  Say what you like about Crawford, she never gave less than one hundred and ten percent, and she plays her first scenes with Hope Lang as a smiling, bejeweled cobra; later, when she tells her married lover to go to hell during a telephone call, her intonation is such that one imagines him stewing in the flames already.  It really is an astonishing performance, and in a perfect world Crawford would have been nominated as Best Supporting Actress for the role.The film makes a powerful, if somewhat unintentional and distinctly melodramatic, statement about the hell women endured in the male-dominated work place of the 1950s, but this and Crawford aside, it is an extremely stodgy movie that is best remembered for its visual design.  The gleaming offices are memorably post-war, the costumes are indicative of the era, and New York's cityscape has seldom been so effectively filmed.  Both picture and sound are excellent.  The DVD includes a bonus audio track by Rona Jaffe, who wrote the novel, and film historian Sylvia Stoddard.  Its worth a listen and quite often more entertaining than the film itself.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Webster Armstrong",3,"""What is it about women like us that make you hold us so cheaply?""",1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,2929,"['Throughout', 'much', '20th', 'Century', 'society', 'dictated', 'woman', 'preferred', 'career', 'should', 'be', 'wife', 'mother', 'women', 'who', 'worked', 'home', 'were', 'frequently', 'pitied', 'BEST', 'OF', 'EVERYTHING', 'precisely', 'mindset', 'unsavory', 'romantic', 'adventures', 'various', 'women', 'employed', 'New', 'York', 'publishing', 'company', 'Amanda', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Barbara', 'Martha', 'Hyer', 'offer', 'cautionary', 'tales', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'married', 'men', 'story', 'three', 'younger', 'women', 'who', 'experience', 'romantic', 'disasters', 'own.Caroline', 'Bender', 'Hope', 'Lang', 'working', 'boyfriend', 'returns', 'returns', 'out-of-country', 'studies', 'When', 'drive', 'talent', 'make', 'career', 'also', 'attention', 'executive', 'Mike', 'Rice', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'who', 'wasted', 'business', 'world', 'April', 'Morrison', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'somewhat', 'air-headed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'affair', 'slimy', 'Dexter', 'Key', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'trouble', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Drop-dead-beautiful', 'Gregg', 'Adams', 'Suzy', 'Parker', 'aspirations', 'stage', 'stardom', 'afoul', 'slimy', 'stage', 'director', 'David', 'Savage', 'Louis', 'Jourdan', 'unpleasantnesses', 'must', 'endure', 'pinches', 'pats', 'genuinely', 'male-chauvanist', 'business', 'society', 'do', 'best', 'stay', 'ahead', 'boss', 'when', 'desk.Lang', 'Baker', 'Parker', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'real', 'knock-out', 'performance', 'belongs', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'who', 'less', 'ten', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'who', 'one', 'critic', 'famously', 'commented', 'almost', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'seem', 'irrelevant', 'embittered', 'woman', 'married', 'lover', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'wife', 'out', 'frustration', 'various', 'underlings', 'Say', 'what', 'like', 'Crawford', 'never', 'gave', 'less', 'one', 'hundred', 'ten', 'percent', 'first', 'scenes', 'Hope', 'Lang', 'smiling', 'bejeweled', 'cobra', 'later', 'when', 'married', 'lover', 'go', 'hell', 'telephone', 'call', 'intonation', 'such', 'one', 'stewing', 'flames', 'already', 'really', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'perfect', 'world', 'Crawford', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'role.The', 'film', 'powerful', 'somewhat', 'unintentional', 'distinctly', 'melodramatic', 'statement', 'hell', 'women', 'endured', 'male-dominated', 'work', 'place', '1950s', 'Crawford', 'aside', 'extremely', 'stodgy', 'movie', 'best', 'remembered', 'visual', 'design', 'gleaming', 'offices', 'are', 'memorably', 'post-war', 'costumes', 'are', 'indicative', 'era', 'New', 'York', 'cityscape', 'seldom', 'been', 'so', 'effectively', 'filmed', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'audio', 'track', 'Rona', 'Jaffe', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'film', 'historian', 'Sylvia', 'Stoddard', 'worth', 'listen', 'quite', 'often', 'more', 'entertaining', 'film', 'itself.GFT', 'Amazon', 'ReviewerIn', 'Memory', 'Webster', 'Armstrong']",The Best of Everything VHS

I love Johnny Mathis singing the title song, juxtapositioned with the street scenes in New York of the many people coming from the subway, bus, and walking down the street.  And as the mail clerk tells Carolyn Bender when she arrives at the empty Fabian offices, ""give it two minutes, then run for cover!""  He does not exaggerate.  I watched this movie some years ago because Joan Crawford was in it--and she does not disappoint, though I wish she'd had a more prominent role.The music is beautiful as Carolyn (Hope Lange) surveys some of the offices and looks around the typing pool mere minutes before all the employees arrive.  Though not often mentioned, I think Sue Carson (Mary Agnes--head of the typing pool) is great, and as Stephen Boyd (Mr. Rice) remarks during her pre-wedding office party, ""She's the smartest one here.""  I don't think she was in any other films for some reason.One question I had about the fashion of the time, which I've discussed with a friend on here, concerns the hatboxes one sees many women carrying during the initial street scenes.  I have the idea that they were often used as forerunners to today's backbacks (which fortunately, finally, gives us guys something to use for the same purpose.)  Something large enough to carry a lunch, newspaper, and anything else one may have wished to take to work--but too large for a purse.

384361,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6303662544,JGC,"[13, 13]","I first watched this movie because cinamatic legand Joan Crawford was one of the stars in it. Joan plays Amanda Farrow, a rather bossy publishing executive. However, her part is small and the movie has little to do with her character. It's a fine picture, though.At first glance, ""The Best of Everything"" looks like ""9 to 5"" meets ""The Devil Wears Prada."" But after the first twenty minutes I was convinced that this was a much more complicated tale about relationships taking place in the Big Apple.The main plot focused on three clerical workers at the same publishing firm, played by Hope Lange, Diane Baker, and Suzy Parker. Each women has their own trials and tribulations. But I think the one thing that they all have in common is that the men in their lives are all cads. I would say that just about all the men in this film are rather unsympathetic and uncaring. Is this how men really were in the 1950's? I hope not.Normally I'd reserve two maybe three stars for a picture like this. But since it's Joan's ""last great picture"" (not counting ""Baby Jane,"" of course) it deserves four.",4,See you in the snake pit...,1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,1091,"['first', 'watched', 'movie', 'cinamatic', 'legand', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'one', 'stars', 'Joan', 'Amanda', 'Farrow', 'rather', 'bossy', 'publishing', 'executive', 'However', 'part', 'small', 'movie', 'little', 'do', 'character', 'fine', 'picture', 'though.At', 'first', 'glance', 'Best', 'Everything', '9', '5', 'meets', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'tale', 'relationships', 'taking', 'place', 'Big', 'Apple.The', 'main', 'plot', 'focused', 'three', 'clerical', 'workers', 'same', 'publishing', 'firm', 'played', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Suzy', 'Parker', 'women', 'own', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'men', 'lives', 'are', 'cads', 'would', 'say', 'just', 'men', 'film', 'are', 'rather', 'unsympathetic', 'uncaring', 'how', 'men', 'really', 'were', '1950', 'hope', 'not.Normally', ""'d"", 'reserve', 'two', 'maybe', 'three', 'stars', 'picture', 'Joan', 'last', 'great', 'picture', 'not', 'counting', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'course', 'four']",The Best of Everything VHS
384362,A3FGIDFZA4U3O2,6303662544,"Joan Crawford ""Jon""","[4, 7]","There are some wonderful reasons to add the newly released-on-DVD ""The Best of Everything"" to your film library. For one, it is a glittering and colorful glimpse into New York City circa 1959. Fox certainly has done a commendable job with the DVD--the picture quality and sound are both crystal clear. Cinemascope has rarely been this fun to watch, because now one can see it digitally mastered in widescreen with vivid color photography by Deluxe brought to sparkling life.The film is very, very lush. From the beginning, when the screen fills with a sunny view of the Manhattan skyline to the sounds of Johnny Mathis crooning the Oscar-nominated theme song, you know you are in for grand entertainment. All of the performances are fine, with Crawford a standout.I think it's funny that although Joan Crawford only has five to ten minutes of screen time in ""The Best of Everything,"" her picture is featured very prominently on the back and front covers of the DVD. The casual watcher may never know that the ultimate movie star had a only a supporting role, yet with that tiny role she managed to steal the entire picture and make it her own!  That's star power!As enjoyable as the film is, it is incredibly flawed. If one was interested in sexist attitudes (concerning men AND women) and how they have changed since the 1950s, there couldn't be a more relevant movie to watch. It is shocking, and sometimes disturbing, how much attitudes have changed.For example, at one point during the movie, Catherine (played by lovely Hope Lange) is told by David, one of her romantic interests, that once she has proven to herself she can make it in the publishing world (which, in his view, could be the only reason a woman might have some kind of ambition) she should quit it all, get married, and ""love happily ever after."" Now there is nothing wrong with wanting to be in love happily ever after, but it certainly represents a double-standard. Who would ever tell a man such a thing?  Could you imagine Hope Lange telling David that a man's ambition is only him trying to prove himself, and that he should cut it out and love happily ever after? (now I can imagine Joan Crawford saying that to Clark Gable, but there weren't any characters with that kind of will or independence in this film).So much of the dialogue and morality in the film is dated, and some of it is very disturbing, but there are still some good things about the story. There are some great viewpoints on love, and how casual dating and hookups can hurt people, and my favorite line has to be, ""Here's to men, with their clean-shaven faces and their dirty little minds."" It's funny to say the least!",4,A very silly but lovely 1950s soap opera,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,2665,"['are', 'wonderful', 'reasons', 'add', 'newly', 'released-on-DVD', 'Best', 'Everything', 'film', 'library', 'one', 'glittering', 'colorful', 'glimpse', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'circa', '1959', 'Fox', 'certainly', 'done', 'commendable', 'job', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Cinemascope', 'rarely', 'been', 'fun', 'watch', 'now', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'digitally', 'mastered', 'widescreen', 'vivid', 'color', 'photography', 'Deluxe', 'brought', 'sparkling', 'life.The', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'lush', 'beginning', 'when', 'screen', 'sunny', 'view', 'Manhattan', 'skyline', 'sounds', 'Johnny', 'Mathis', 'crooning', 'Oscar-nominated', 'theme', 'song', 'know', 'are', 'grand', 'entertainment', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'Crawford', 'standout.I', 'think', 'funny', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'only', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Best', 'Everything', 'picture', 'featured', 'very', 'prominently', 'back', 'front', 'covers', 'DVD', 'casual', 'watcher', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'ultimate', 'movie', 'star', 'had', 'only', 'supporting', 'role', 'yet', 'tiny', 'role', 'managed', 'steal', 'entire', 'picture', 'make', 'own', 'star', 'power', 'As', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'incredibly', 'flawed', 'one', 'was', 'interested', 'sexist', 'attitudes', 'concerning', 'men', 'AND', 'women', 'how', 'have', 'changed', '1950s', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'relevant', 'movie', 'watch', 'shocking', 'sometimes', 'disturbing', 'how', 'much', 'attitudes', 'have', 'changed.For', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'Catherine', 'played', 'lovely', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'told', 'David', 'one', 'romantic', 'interests', 'once', 'proven', 'herself', 'can', 'make', 'publishing', 'world', 'view', 'could', 'be', 'only', 'reason', 'woman', 'might', 'have', 'kind', 'ambition', 'should', 'quit', 'get', 'married', 'love', 'happily', 'ever', 'Now', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'wanting', 'be', 'love', 'happily', 'ever', 'certainly', 'double-standard', 'Who', 'would', 'ever', 'tell', 'man', 'thing', 'Could', 'imagine', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'telling', 'David', 'man', 'ambition', 'only', 'trying', 'prove', 'should', 'cut', 'out', 'love', 'happily', 'ever', 'now', 'can', 'imagine', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'saying', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'were', ""n't"", 'characters', 'kind', 'will', 'independence', 'film', 'much', 'dialogue', 'morality', 'film', 'dated', 'very', 'disturbing', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'things', 'story', 'are', 'great', 'viewpoints', 'love', 'how', 'casual', 'dating', 'hookups', 'can', 'hurt', 'people', 'favorite', 'line', 'be', 'Here', 'men', 'clean-shaven', 'dirty', 'little', 'minds', 'funny', 'say', 'least']",The Best of Everything VHS

See aspiring actress with a jealous streak and broken heart rummage through X-boyfriend's trash (and I thought I was the only one who did that!), see jilted girlfriend drink one too many and end up in her boss's apartment, where they (gasp!) kiss, see hurt/confused/morally compromised lover leap from moving car and more!  It's all good stuff, if a bit melodramatic and contrived.That's what makes it so bee-you-tee-ful. Well, that and Joan Crawford's eyebrows.

It was about the world of New York secretaries.  And it seemed to speak directly to me as I was then working as a secretary for a large management-consulting firm.  I loved it then because it seemed so real.  Now, 44 years later, I'm reminded of that reality.I remember wearing white gloves and a hat to work each day, even in the summer.  I remember setting my hair in pincurls.  I remember my electric typewriter, which was the latest technological advance.  I was married then and remember being addressed as &quot;Mrs.&quot; by my boss, even though I was only 19 years old.  All the secretaries had desks next to each other in one open room; it was years before the advent of cubicles made famous by the Dilbert cartoon.  And years before any of my fellow co-workers aspired to anything other than marriage and children. The one female executive was pitied and looked at as a sour old maid.In the film Joan Crawford is cast as that one office &quot;witch&quot;, who had not married because she was involved with a married man and was paying for her bad decision.  Indeed, there was more than one married man involved in affairs in the film, but it was always the woman who was made to suffer.  Hope Lange had the role of the young hopeful who, because of being jilted by her boyfriend, starts to achieve some success in business.  Then there is Diane Baker, fresh faced and innocent at the beginning, but whose life is almost ruined by the wrong man.  Most pitiful of all though is Suzy Parker, who gives up her secretarial job to be an actress and is used and then dropped by an important director.  The men are all cads with the exception of Stephen Boyd who accuses Hope Lange of wanting to achieve success because she's afraid of being a &quot;real woman&quot;.  Brian Ahern is a lecher who is always pinching the girls; their reaction though is typical of the times --they just laugh it off and don't take him seriously.  Robert Evans is a seducer with no morals.  And Louis Jourdan is the director who keeps a girl around only for as long as she amuses him.This is a film that could never have be made today.  All the women are secretaries.  All the men are bosses.  Everyone is white and middle class.  They all have the same values.  However, in spite of all that, it is a really good story.  It moves fast and held my interest throughout.  And the acting is quite good.  In a limited way I found myself really caring about the characters.  I really do know people who were just like those depicted on the screen.

In the latter two movies, there is the idea that the guys might WANT to sleep with the career girls, but they never can get to first base, not without the old wedding ring pay-off, that is. They are movies made still in the spirit of censorship, where the worried audience can sigh, ""Oh thanks heavens!"" as certain sexual situations are always diffused.But that's not what happens with ""The Best of Everything"". Suzy Parker tries to play it cool with her lover, Louis Jourdan, but descends into madness because he loves and leaves her; Diane Baker ""goes all the way"" with Bob Evans, and finds herself ""in a fix""; and heroine Hope Lange resists the advances of both Brian Aherne and Stephen Boyd only to find herself in a sordid affair with her old, now married, fiancee. I guess it's movies like this that illustrated why sex ed needed to be included in the public school curricula. All three gals are downright stupid where men are concerned--didn't their mothers teach them ANYTHING?Now, you'll see that Joan Crawford is pictured rather large on the advertisement. It's true that she's the biggest star in the movie, but it's a supporting role for her. In a way, it's too bad that she didn't get more roles like this as she got older, because she is the one person comporting herself with dignity at the publishing house where all these dopey women work. She's one of the head editors who put career before family, and now what has she got to show for it? She really ought to have a banner on her door proclaiming, ""Abandon hope, all ye career girls who enter here!"" Poor Joan must take the crusts thrown her by HER married lover, whom she beseeches on the phone.

Being only 23 years old, I can't imagine living in a time where women were confined to only being secretaries or fashion editors when in the working force. I can't imagine being chased around a desk by my boss and constantly being talked down to, pinched, and patronized just because it was what they did back then.This movie really opened my eyes to what went on the in the working world in the 50's. It was also interesting to see how topics such as sexual harrassment, abortion, dependency (on men), and sex, period were handled approximately 50 years ago.

Men are lecherous, chain-smoking booze-hounds with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, pass&eacute; way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack. I want to jump right into some scenes, filmed on N.Y. streets, circa 1959 & experience a time I've only seen on film & in photographs. Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith's ""Working Girl."" Especially when Hope Lange (who's a cross between Grace Kelly & Dolores Hart) gets bombed in handsome Stephen Boyd's apartment, he tucks her in & just watches her sleep (like Melanie, she wants to know if ""anything"" happened between them the following day). Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to Sigourney Weaver's horrible female boss except she was outwardly nasty (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was sweet on the outside & horrible on the inside. I found it distressing how the Suzy Parker character (Gregg) started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress, who supposedly didn't need a man to complete her, ended up. She becomes a stalker/lunatic/nut-job when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her bananas after he's done with her. I loved the character Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her thick New Yawk accent. If you enjoy films like ""Valley Of The Dolls"", ""Where The Boys Are"", & ""Come Fly With Me"" you'll like this one too. (BTW I don't know why Joan Crawford is on the cover of this DVD! Her role is small, much like Susan Hayward's in ""Valley of The Dolls"". Here's alittle bit of trivia: Hope Lange & Diane Baker stroll down Christopher Street chatting about 30 minutes into the film.

384378,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,6303662544,octobercountry,"[0, 0]","I've mentioned previously how much I enjoy the very particular style of melodrama that was popular from the mid 1950's through the mid 1960's. This was a transitional period, where (year by year) films were gradually becoming more daring in discussing adult themes and situations. These pictures may seem a bit quaint when compared to the anything-goes style of cinema that had developed by the early 1970's, but they're a heck of a lot of fun to watch.So, I just settled back to enjoy the soapy goodness of ""The Best of Everything,"" a late 1950's entry in the genre. While I can't say it was the best of these melodramas that I've seen---there have been others that I've liked better---there was still much to appreciate in this tale of three young women finding that life in the big city is not what they had hoped. And if you're looking for it, you can see elements of later films already in place here---think of this as a sort of fifties version of The Devil Wears Prada. Heck, I even see a bit of Valley of the Dolls here, though this film is more straightforward and doesn't come anywhere near the campiness of Dolls.I really did appreciate the view this film afforded of life nearly 55 years ago. The exterior location shots give us glimpses of a New York City that has disappeared forever, and all the interiors are VERY 1950's modern; how chic! (and pleasantly nostalgic overall).For a bit of social commentary, you get a look at office politics of the time---and it's not a pretty picture. The atmosphere is a bit misogynistic, and also features a working environment where casual sexual harassment is a matter of course---I daresay women today would not tolerate situations like these for an instant.Anyway, for a bit of fun period melodrama by all means give it a try. If you're the type who enjoys things likePicnic : RestoredorPeyton PlaceorA Summer Placeand the like I'll happily recommend this one.(Man, the office environment has changed in more ways than one---do large corporations have huge open work areas like this anymore, for the secretarial pool, or is it all cubicals now? You know, I had TOTALLY FORGOTTEN how very loud a room full of typewriters is---it's like listening to hail on a tin roof. Now that sound took me right back---and also makes me feel incredibly old. Ha! Well, you know you're getting on in years when you realise that things that were commonplace to you are completely unknown to the current generation ---- like the sound of a multitude of typewriters all going at once.....)The artwork for the picture prominently features Joan Crawford's image, but she really only has a guest-starring sort of role; the story focuses on a very attractive group of up-and-coming Hollywood hopefuls.",4,Enjoyable 1950's soap,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,2732,"[""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'previously', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'very', 'particular', 'style', 'melodrama', 'was', 'popular', 'mid', '1950', 'mid', '1960', 'was', 'transitional', 'period', 'where', 'year', 'year', 'films', 'were', 'gradually', 'becoming', 'more', 'daring', 'discussing', 'adult', 'themes', 'situations', 'pictures', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'quaint', 'when', 'compared', 'anything-goes', 'style', 'cinema', 'had', 'developed', 'early', '1970', ""'re"", 'heck', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch.So', 'just', 'settled', 'back', 'enjoy', 'soapy', 'goodness', 'Best', 'Everything', 'late', '1950', 'entry', 'genre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'best', 'melodramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', '-there', 'have', 'been', 'others', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'better', 'was', 'still', 'much', 'appreciate', 'tale', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'finding', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', ""'re"", 'looking', 'can', 'see', 'elements', 'later', 'films', 'already', 'place', 'here', '-think', 'sort', 'fifties', 'version', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Heck', 'even', 'see', 'bit', 'Valley', 'Dolls', 'here', 'film', 'more', 'straightforward', ""n't"", 'come', 'anywhere', 'campiness', 'Dolls.I', 'really', 'did', 'appreciate', 'view', 'film', 'afforded', 'life', 'nearly', '55', 'years', 'ago', 'exterior', 'location', 'shots', 'give', 'glimpses', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'disappeared', 'forever', 'interiors', 'are', 'VERY', '1950', 'modern', 'how', 'chic', 'pleasantly', 'nostalgic', 'overall', 'bit', 'social', 'commentary', 'get', 'look', 'office', 'politics', 'time', '-and', 'not', 'pretty', 'picture', 'atmosphere', 'bit', 'misogynistic', 'also', 'working', 'environment', 'where', 'casual', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'matter', 'course', '-I', 'daresay', 'women', 'today', 'would', 'not', 'tolerate', 'situations', 'instant.Anyway', 'bit', 'fun', 'period', 'melodrama', 'means', 'give', 'try', ""'re"", 'type', 'who', 'things', 'likePicnic', 'RestoredorPeyton', 'PlaceorA', 'Summer', 'Placeand', 'like', ""'ll"", 'happily', 'recommend', 'one', 'Man', 'office', 'environment', 'changed', 'more', 'ways', 'one', '-do', 'large', 'corporations', 'have', 'huge', 'open', 'work', 'areas', 'anymore', 'secretarial', 'pool', 'cubicals', 'now', 'know', 'had', 'TOTALLY', 'FORGOTTEN', 'how', 'very', 'loud', 'room', 'full', 'typewriters', '-it', 'listening', 'hail', 'tin', 'roof', 'Now', 'sound', 'took', 'right', 'back', '-and', 'also', 'feel', 'incredibly', 'old', 'Ha', 'Well', 'know', ""'re"", 'getting', 'years', 'when', 'realise', 'things', 'were', 'commonplace', 'are', 'completely', 'unknown', 'current', 'generation', 'sound', 'multitude', 'typewriters', 'going', 'once', '..', 'artwork', 'picture', 'prominently', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'image', 'really', 'only', 'guest-starring', 'sort', 'role', 'story', 'very', 'attractive', 'group', 'up-and-coming', 'Hollywood', 'hopefuls']",The Best of Everything VHS

I expected a fun movie but was thrilled with the fine performances of so many in the film, particularly Diane Baker. The movie also makes me sad there weren't more big film roles for the lovely Suzy Parker. The scene in which she first appears in the film will bowl you over.After you've watched the film treat yourself to watching it again with the Sylvia Stoddard/Rona Jaffe narrative turned on. All the fun things you'll pick up about the movie, the cast, the set, and the times in general are priceless.Tip: If after watching the movie you have the wonderful soundtrack stuck in your mind you'll want to grab a copy of the 2002 CD right away as they are already getting pretty hard to find.I bought The Best of Everything early last fall and have already watched it 4 times, or 6 if you count the times with commentary on.",5,Transcends Its Genre,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,1535,"['Most', 'insist', 'lumping', 'Best', 'Everything', 'soap', 'category', 'think', 'labeling', 'anything', 'well', 'acted', 'written', 'directed', 'scored', 'anything', 'less', 'simply', 'drama', 'doing', 'movie', 'potential', 'viewers', 'huge', 'disservice.The', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'opening', 'sequence', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'experience', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', '1959', 'Best', 'Everything', 'wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'so', 'well', 'think', 'would', 'need', 'time', 'machine', 'do', 'better.I', 'had', 'been', 'interested', 'movie', 'ever', 'seeing', 'clip', 'film', 'TCM', 'fascinating', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'bio', 'coincidentally', 'bonus', 'flip', 'side', '2003', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'dvd', 'expected', 'fun', 'movie', 'was', 'thrilled', 'fine', 'performances', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'particularly', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'movie', 'also', 'sad', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'big', 'film', 'roles', 'lovely', 'Suzy', 'Parker', 'scene', 'first', 'film', 'will', 'bowl', 'over.After', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'treat', 'watching', 'again', 'Sylvia', 'Stoddard/Rona', 'Jaffe', 'narrative', 'turned', 'fun', 'things', ""'ll"", 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'cast', 'set', 'times', 'general', 'are', 'priceless.Tip', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'stuck', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'want', 'grab', 'copy', '2002', 'CD', 'right', 'away', 'are', 'already', 'getting', 'pretty', 'hard', 'find.I', 'Best', 'Everything', 'early', 'last', 'fall', 'have', 'already', 'watched', '4', 'times', '6', 'count', 'times', 'commentary']",The Best of Everything VHS
384385,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6303662544,Simon Davis,"[3, 4]","The old saying ""My how times have changed!"" could easily have been coined after a viewing of 20th Century Fox's plush melodrama ""The Best of Everything"".  It is a fascinating time capsule showing workplaces as perhaps they once were in the late 1950's inhabited by the ""working girls"" waiting for marriage, dressed to the nines and gossiping about their latest dates, and their male bosses who saw it as their absolute God given right to indulge in a bit of sexual hanky panky between board meetings with those girls working for them. As I said how times have changed! I found a recent viewing of this terrific film a fascinating and highly enjoyable experience. It was especially  interesting that while the women were almost all portrayed as victims every male in the story, with the exception of Stephen Boyd's character, was depicted as a leering sexual predator who was incapable of commitment. ""The Best of Everything"" depicts the intermingled personal and professional stories of three young working girls (Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Suzy Parker) at the Fabian Publishing Company in New York. While dealing with the various destructive relationships each is involved in they must also contend at work with aggressive and demanding editor Amanda Farrow played by Hollywood legend Joan Crawford who is involved in her own one sided love affair with a married man. Tragedy mixes with happiness in equal portions in the girl's lives as they steer their way through the sexual jungle of big business circa 1959 in their search for the ""best of everything"".The great strength of ""The Best of Everything"" apart from great location photography and sumptuous colour is its superb cast. Rising Hollywood actresses Lange, Baker and Parker all deliver excellent performances showing ""working girls"" from very diverse backgrounds coping with the same issues of love vs career. However the real standout is of course the incomparable Joan Crawford in the smallish part of Amanda Farrow. Despite her limited screen time Joan really  shows what star quality is all about and I found myself missing her during her frequent absences from the action on screen. Joan reportedly had a number of difficult situations while on the set and argued with Jerry Wald about the size of her part saying that the character of Amanda needed to be explained more to make her more sympathetic and also needed to be more involved in the lives of the younger women in the story. I totally agree with her as it would have provided an even more dramatic element to the finished product. While Joan developed a lifelong friendship with Diane Baker working twice more with her in ""Straitjacket"" and TV's ""Della"" she apparently had conflicts with Hope Lange over positioning, camera angles etc, and was often not granted her requests which sadly signified a sort of ""changing of the guard"" in Hollywood's pecking order of who was currently ""hot"" and who was not in 1959. However despite Joan's small role the film really comes alive during her scenes and she makes the most of them. The film is memorable today solely because of her participation in it. She is both commanding and yet vulnerable as Amanda and despite her characters harsh exterior she certainly made me care about and have sympathy for her characters situation. It's also nice to see Joan reunited with her leading man from 1935's ""I Live My Life"" Brian Aherne who despite being depicted as a frightful old sexual harrasser in the film has great chemistry still with Joan making their scenes together have the feel of two comfortable old comrades interacting well with each other. For all his characters faults Aherne also helps in bringing out the softer elements to Joan's character in their brief time together on screen helping make Amanda a more multi dimensional individual.For their Studio Classics DVD release of ""The Best of Everything""  20th Century Fox have really made a great effort in showing the film in all its restored beauty. The Fox colour has never been more brilliant with both New York and all the beautiful clothes (Oscar nominated) displayed in the film shown to their best advantage. Visually this film is a treat in every way. Originally released in cinemascope what we have here is a very fine widescreen edition of the film. The sound is clear and crisp with Johnny Mathis' memorable theme song ""The Best of Everything"" (Oscar nominated)  never sounding better than it is here playing over the opening credits. Extras wise this DVD release is a bit of a mixed bag. We have the Movietone News footage of the premiere of ""The Best of Everything"" which is interesting but lacks the presence of many of the stars of the film . There is also an excellent audio commentary on the film from author Rona Jaffe and film historian Sylvia Stoddard and also some very battered trailers from such Fox classics as ""Laura"" and ""All About Eve"". All in all a good  package for a film that deserves to be better remembered as a memorable statement of how life once possibly was for both women and men in big business. All fans of Joan Crawford and indeed even those interested in the history of American business are sure to get lots of entertainment value from this Fox ""Studio Classics"" release.",5,"Compelling

Jerry Wald, who helped to get Joan the starring role in ""Mildred Pierce"", hired Joan for a minor role in ""The Best of Everything"". The film featured a bunch of new Hollywood stars with Joan starring as Amanda, the head of a publishing house in New York City where the movie was set. Amanda was a tough-as-nails woman who put her employess though hell. Many critics and fans felt that Joan's role in this film was a step down for her as she didn't even receive top billing, but Crawford would go on to believe, and rightly so, that she stole the movie from her younger co-stars because she had the experience and the guts they didn't have.""The Best of Everything"" would spawn an ABC daytime soap opera of the same name in 1970 that only lasted six months. Another Joan Crawford film would also spawn the primetime serial ""Flamingo Road"", and would debut in 1980 starring Morgan Fairchild.Diane Baker, who plays one of Joan's employees in ""The Best of Everything"", would become a Crawford friend and co-star with her in 1963's ""Straight Jacket"" and the 1964 TV movie ""Fatal Confinement"", also known as ""Della"".This DVD comes in beautiful widescreen format and looks impeccable.",5,"""Joan Crawford In Color!""",1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,1269,"['Joan', 'Crawford', 'husband', 'Al', 'Steel', 'died', '1959', 'Joan', 'was', 'left', 'broke', 'needed', 'job', 'Jerry', 'Wald', 'who', 'helped', 'get', 'Joan', 'starring', 'role', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'hired', 'Joan', 'minor', 'role', 'Best', 'Everything', 'film', 'featured', 'bunch', 'new', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'Joan', 'starring', 'Amanda', 'head', 'publishing', 'house', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'Amanda', 'was', 'tough-as-nails', 'woman', 'who', 'put', 'employess', 'hell', 'Many', 'critics', 'fans', 'felt', 'Joan', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'step', 'down', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'receive', 'top', 'billing', 'Crawford', 'would', 'go', 'believe', 'rightly', 'so', 'stole', 'movie', 'younger', 'co-stars', 'had', 'experience', 'guts', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Best', 'Everything', 'would', 'spawn', 'ABC', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'same', 'name', '1970', 'only', 'lasted', 'six', 'months', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'spawn', 'primetime', 'serial', 'Flamingo', 'Road', 'would', 'debut', '1980', 'starring', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild.Diane', 'Baker', 'who', 'one', 'Joan', 'employees', 'Best', 'Everything', 'would', 'become', 'Crawford', 'friend', 'co-star', '1963', 'Straight', 'Jacket', '1964', 'TV', 'movie', 'Fatal', 'Confinement', 'also', 'known', 'Della', '.This', 'DVD', 'beautiful', 'widescreen', 'format', 'impeccable']",The Best of Everything VHS

Almost all the men in this picture were either boozers or just total DOGS!  Often the men were both boozers and dogs.  Ths movie had such bad stereotypes of old boy sexual harrassment that it likely could not be made today.  The thing that shocks me most about this movie is that it got made at all.  I mean this movie talks openly about shallow self absorbed rich boys who tell ladies whatever they want or need to hear just to go all the way with them.  Then when a baby results they force the young lady of now soiled virtue to sneak off to some back alley abortionist.In this case the young lady in question bolted but not without losing the baby rseolving the rich jerks issue.  Of course this was a 1950's era movie so all the bad girls had to meet somewhat tragic ends or be scared for life.  The star of the picture is dutifully rewarded at the end of the picture by seeming to achieve the beginnings of a beautiful friendship with a co-equal at work after reaching success in business.  She is last seen leaving her office for the night having won the respect of the typing pool ladies from which she came.  She makes firends with the office sour puss, who finds weird solace in the arms of the booze hound womanizer, who I suspect has a rabbit faced wife.The movie ends with her finding solace in the arms of a hard drinking but lovable clod of a co-worker.  Is the acting wooden for the most part you bethcha. Joan Crawford really did carry this picture.  Her few moments in the picture tried it together in a rather masterful way.  Joan did not have very much actual FACE time on the picture but her small parts had so much power that she stole the show.  If you wanted to see what male sexist pig really means that you must buy this DVD because its all here.
