282011,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6301971345,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 8]","""If I thought my reply were meant for one/ who ever could return into the world,/ This flame would stir no more; and yet, since none/--if what I hear is true--ever returned/ Alive from this abyss, then without fear/Of facing infamy, I answer you"" Dante's `Inferno' Canto 27, lines 61-66(2 1/2 *'s) Enjoying `Mr. Brooks' in many ways has to do with your take on Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner).  At first conversing with his alter ego, Marshall (William Hurt), one wonders if he has flipped out or made a major pact with the devil.  One thing's for sure, it doesn't take us long to find out the answer.  Mr. Brooks is in many ways a respectable man.  He is loved by his wife, Emma (Marg Hegenberger), and he truly loves his spoiled, wayward daughter who has mysteriously dropped out of her first semester of college. His inner life and his outward appearance are like a case study from Psychiatrist M. Scott Peck's book, 'People of the Lie'.We know he is having internal conversations with his alter ego, for on the way home from an awards' dinner done in his honor, Brooks is talking to Marshall about his next murder. Marshall is in the back seat while his wife is in the front seat, oblivious to anything but changes in her husband's facial expressions.  In another scene Brooks and Marshall are sitting side by side and both turn their heads in synch, like they're one.By outward appearances, the only indication of anything amiss in his life are his frequent AA meetings, which vex Marshall, but please him with each new resolution of reform.  Much like the pact made in 'Ghost Rider,' Brooks seems uncomfortable with his real addiction, which in this case is to murder.  Oddly, as a homicidal addict he has enough composure to keep himself from leaving any traces he might leave behind.  Going for a second dessert after the awards dinner, Mr. Brooks spots a couple at a dancing school on a loft within sight of the ice cream parlor.  They will be his next victims.  At home he has a wardrobe room that keeps all the means to keep all traces of his crime behind.  Later, catching the couple at their apartment having sex, he coldly announces himself and shoots them dead.As his first murder in two years, things start to stick.  Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) has been on his trail for years.  She is no closer to finding ""The Thumbprint Murderer"" than before.  Brooks is scot-free until a man, Bafford (Dane Cook), shows up at work delivering pictures of Brooks at the scene of the crime.  Bafford is a voyeur, one who enjoyed the open curtain bedroom scenes of the deceased and found an extra thrill with their demise. Bafford (bka ""Mr. Smith"") offers Brooks a proposition:  In exchange for the camera's memory and all the pictures, Brooks will allow him to tag along his next homicide.Bafford causes great problems for Brooks who argues against Marshall's persistent wishes.  He's on the wagon and has great difficulty fulfilling Bafford's part of the bargain.  For his part, Marshall only offers murder as a constant solution every time Brooks' gets closer to suspicion.  Meanwhile, Atwood has more than serial murderers on the loose:  She's distracted by a harassing ex-husband who is trying to extract inheritance money from her in a divorce settlement. How these plot lines come together, including the daughter's, is both amazing and unbelievable at the same time.Watching `Mr. Brooks' I kept thinking that most films would have been made from Detective Tracy Atwood's point-of-view.  She'd be the protagonist, and we'd see her go through corridors with a gun in her hand.  Maybe that film was done with Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins, and it was called `Silence of the Lambs,' a brilliant movie.Why see `Mr. Brooks`?  As a twisty plot movie, it offers a couple new ideas.  Is it plausible?  Probably not, but there's enough suspension of disbelief to find it reasonably entertaining.  Yet, there are too many plot points that neatly intersect together.  Just like the classic Faustus story of a man making a blood pack with the devil, is it a modern fable?  Possibly, but that's not the focus or import of the movie.  Is it a fascinating portrait of a man gone wrong?  I was intrigued, but only for so long.  Mr. Brooks brings some mystery, but I was absorbed and fascinated about him until the end.  Then, I was disappointed.  He loves his daughter; he wants to go straight; but in the end he doesn't care anything more than about his reputation.  (See Dante quote at the beginning of the review.)  It's understandable that Mr. Brooks is conflicted.  He couldn't be anything less, but when he can't decide what's most important hiding his reputation from his family or never receiving proper recognition from the detectives, we start to lose interest.  Okay, so there's the ""banality of evil"" presented, but realism does not always a good movie make.  There's something about the movie that lacks tension and cohesiveness.  Almost entirely devoid of sympathy, we do end up caring about Detective Atwood.  As an arcade, almost every picture I can think of is better developed.As talented as William Hurt is, he never brings the script home the way 'Danny Darko' did.  Not his fault.  This voyeur ride isn't as entertaining (much less suspenseful) as 'Disturbia'.  After being on the edge of my seat with fascination, 'Mr. Brooks' bored me, and a comparison with the relationship of a Faustian figure and the Devil in a more effective movie like 'Angel Heart' with Mickey Rourke and Robert DeNiro reminded me why.",2,Reprobate,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,5527,"['thought', 'reply', 'were', 'meant', 'one/', 'who', 'ever', 'could', 'return', 'world', '/', 'flame',

First things last, this movie is chock-full of bad acting...I mean `BAD'. I couldn't get the notion out of my head that Demi Moore and Kevin Costner were desperate for `Relevancy', hence the title for my review. Demi Moore? Did she forget how to act? I never really cared for her credentials any way...what was she in last? That `Charlie Angels' sequel? Anyhow, her bad acting was contagious, anyone around her suffered. Kevin Costner felt very one dimensional to me, he didn't bring much to the table and was the ""best"" character throughout most of the doldrums...i mean movie. The official case to seal the deal was `Dane Cook' using this as a vehicle to expand on his already flat credentials.

Another person, Marshall, talks to Earl. ""What's wrong?"" [Talking to an imaginary man!] We slowly learn about Earl's secret life. Brooks changes to dark clothes then enters an apartment. Two shots [that no one hears?]. Then he drives away with his pictures. The imaginary man talks to him. The police investigate the crime scene and recognize the modus operandi. ""Nobody saw a thing."" We see Earl at a meeting, he admits to being an addict. We see his large factory. His daughter visits him with news about leaving school. ""College is a waste of time."" A visitor brings a packet of surprising photos! We see how spoiled his daughter is. ""Mr. Smith"" tells Earl what he wants! ""Do we have a deal?"" They talk and make an appointment.Detective Atwood and her lawyers discuss a divorce settlement. ""Get over it!"" A dangerous convict escaped and could threaten Tracy! Brooks visits ""Smith"" at night. [How did he get in?] The daughter tells the truth to her parents. They accept this news. The detective examines the scene of the double murder, and across the street. The pair will drive around and look for a victim in the rainy night! ""Never kill someone you know."" A pickup truck presents a victim. They will research the victim to avoid loose ends. [Can they get all that information from the Internet?] There is a shocking surprise on the street when a man grabs a woman. [Were you lulled by the preceding conversation?] This exciting action should wake you up! The two wait for their selected victim when they see a couple.The police continue to search for the ""Thumbprint Killer"". Brooks explains his reasons to Mr. Smith. Two detectives from Palo Alto want to question Jane. Emma calls a criminal lawyer for Jane. What will the detectives do? [The apple falls near the tree?] Brooks makes new plans. Detective Atwood follows ""Mr. Smith"", she has a hunch. A newspaper has a coded message for ""Mr. Smith"". Atwood questions ""Mr. Smith"" again! They search for Meigs and find a shocking surprise! Brooks returns from Palo Alto. He is unhappy with his existence. There was another murder with a hatchet last night, Jane had an alibi. What will Brooks do now? [Is the talk confusing?] We see the selected victims. ""Hello!"" Mr. Smith is excited afterwards. Bafferd is gone! Detective Atwood gets shocking news!There is a surprise in the car. Brooks explains how he will disappear. Atwood searches for Bafferd and gets a lucky break to solve a case! Brooks visits a cemetery. There is another surprise! [Didn't you suspect this would happen?] Brooks resolves to end his addiction. He makes a call using Bafferd's cell phone and explains what he did! Atwood asks his location; no reply. Later there is a final shocking surprise! [I didn't expect this.] What a nightmare ending!I think this would be better as a short story than a full-length movie (where you can question some of the assumptions). I don't think its probable that a successful businessman could be serial killer (as shown here). His time would be taken up by normal activities so wouldn't have time to spare for his addiction. I would not recommend this movie, but is has some interesting plot features that make up for the time spent watching it. There are better movies to watch.

282018,A2XXV9HF169LCF,6301971345,A. Trotter,"[1, 1]","I hate Kevin Costner. I hated his smug romance-figure status from the 90's; I hated his arrogance and his acting and his hair and all of his movies post-Dancing with Wolves. This made me doubtful about watching this movie, despite my general liking for clever murder in the movies. So it took em a good long while to get this movie, and then another long period of looking at it doubtfully every time I walked past my DVD's before I actually got bored enough to put it in.And it was fantastic. There's only one real flaw, and that's the loose end of his daughter; it's not a bad plot device but they leave it hanging there like an Irish pennant on a fine suit.

Along the way, or rather, after the first killing that we see in the movie, he meets someone who's apparently a photographer.The guy happened to take a picture of the killer shooting a couple... um... ""doing it"" in a bedroom.  He even positioned the bodies in a sick sexual way after killing them so the cops would see the bodies in that position when they arrived to the scene.The story gets interesting when the killer meets the guy who snapped the picture of him in the middle of the killing, because it turns out the photographer doesn't have ANY plans to turn the killer in after showing him pictures of the killing he just committed.  Instead, the photographer actually wants to go with the killer on his next ""kill job"".So the killer and the photographer go around town searching for the next victim.  This takes up a good portion of the movie, building suspense the entire time.This movie is great because it builds suspense and shows you what's it like to get inside the head of someone who has no compassion for human life.

282022,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,6301971345,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[1, 2]","There are several sub-genres of films that I generally have little or no interest in watching (especially if there is a ticket or rental price involved).  Among these are the stories about assassins / hitmen as the protagonists, and films about serial murderers, including the slasher films that the horror genre has mostly devolved into.  The 2 main reasons for this are: (A) both of these character types are essentially devoid of any redeeming qualities, and the notion or glorifying or glamorizing what they do is counter-intuitive at best and objectionable otherwise.  And, (B) both types of films with very few exceptions have proven to have a significant lack of imagination and originality, with scripts that stress the action or violence or gore, but are rather mundane in terms of plot and characters.[...]This film (MR. BROOKS) was better than expected, although it should be pointed out the expectations for it (at least in this household) weren't exactly sky-high.  Along with THE GUARDIAN (Costner's best film in years) however, MR. BROOKS might possibly be among Costner's best film and performance in quite some time.  He uses the same generally low-key, understated, acting style as Robert Redford, but with even more of an identifiable everyman aspect, and less of the cool aloofness that Redford effectively uses (though that's pretty much Redford's whole repertoire ).  In this film, Costner's persona as Mr. Brooks was not only useful but ideal, and probably essential.The plot of the film MR. BROOKS - for those who don't already know and are in fact interested - revolves around a seemingly normal and nice guy who is a devoted husband & father, a highly successful businessman, and regarded as a pillar of the community... but who is also a highly skillful and clever prolific serial murderer.  What makes this a slight variation from the tired and unimaginative slasher sub-genre is the empathy the character tries to elicit from the viewers/audience: he sees himself as an addict to a terrible habit (homicide) which he loathes and feels remorse about, rather than revels in.  He even goes to various support group meetings and introduces himself as an addict.  The character is portrayed as someone who seems to earnestly try and beat or at least control his compulsions to indulge his most dark impulses, but who also inevitably falls short on occasion.  Not making this task any easier is the malevolent influence of his alter-ego/imaginary friend (played by William Hurt), who constantly tries goading Mr. Brooks towards diabolical temptation, and undermining Brooks's efforts at staying on the straight & narrow path of decency and abstinence (from murder).[...] Overexposed & irritatingly unfunny comic Dane Cook plays ""Mr. Smith"", a creepy blackmailer who inadvertently sees (and photographs) Mr. Brooks at the scene of a double homicide.  Rather than report this horrific crime to the police, `Mr. Smith' has another sinister agenda.The surprisingly taut and engaging tension in the film comes from 4 sources of conflict: Mr. Brooks's struggle with his homicidal tendencies (both internally and depicted by his conversations with the manifested alter persona), the tenacious police detective investigating the homicides, the blackmailing creep who tries to foist his sinister agenda upon Mr. Brooks, and another growing crisis which hits alarmingly close to home for Mr. Brooks.There are a few relatively minor lapses of logic and realism in the plot, but these can be overlooked for the sake of an otherwise competent story and film with good pacing and effective performances.While I find the premise of a guilt-ridden serial-killer who sees his condition as a regrettable addiction rather than a hobby or pastime he revels in as an interesting take on what is otherwise a trite and uncreative genre, what bothers me is the objectionable suggestion by/of implication that he is in some way a victim.  Our society - or more accurately a misguided liberal segment's notion of displaced pity - has far too much of an irresponsible tendency to automatically impute virtue to victimhood (without taking into account the victims' culpability in cases where it applies), and even worse is the odious inclination to try moral equivocation by inappropriately and illogically conferring some status of `victim' to those who actually perpetrate crimes and harm upon others (the actual victims).  The murdered victims in the film are shown either as little more than mobile and briefly auditory props, or portrayed as somewhat dubious characters that somehow deserve or have a part in bringing about their demises.That having been said, the director does a good job of maintaining suspense throughout the film once the dark truth about Mr. Brooks is known.  It is also impressive to some degree the way that the film presents the premise in which the protagonist is a doer of evil deeds, yet still manages to persuade (at least some of) the audience to root (counter intuitively, I would hope)  for him.  This works because of the skillful & capable way the character of Mr. Brooks is written and portrayed as complicated, complex, multi-dimensional, who possesses some decent and even to some degree - dare I say - identifiable traits.  The credit and kudos for this goes to Costner and the director, with some going to the writer(s) as well.  Though this film will probably find more favor with those who value suspenseful drama than it likely will with those who prefer gory sensationalism, as the murders shown are not especially graphic.  Whether or not you are a fan of the horror genre, most people will likely approve of a movie with a good pacing, an effectively sustained sense of suspense, and a well-written script that features capably developed characters.  This film is deserving of 3.5 stars if this were an option on Amazon.com, but I am feeling a bit charitable, partly due to the unexpected appreciation of this movie, as well as for seeing a movie that had shown at least a shred of originality and imagination during an ongoing creativity drought in the cinematic realm that has for several years been relying on remakes, adaptations, sequels, and insipidly indistinctive cookie-cutter banalities.",4,different and interesting variation on a tired and uninspiring genre,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,6242,"['are', 'several', 'sub-genres', 'films',

282024,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,6301971345,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***Having heard the thriller nature of MR. BROOKS, I had my doubts that someone as feel-goody as Kevin Costner could pull off such a role. I was wrong. Costner his loving, creepy, and pathologic all in the same breath.Mr. Brooks (Costner) has a loving wife, a strong local business, is a respected community leader, and he has an addiction problem. An unusual one: he loves to kill people. We catch up with Mr. Brooks at an awards ceremony where he's being presented an award for citizen of the year. But on the way home, something (someone?) lurks in the back of his mind. This something/someone is named Marshall (William Hurt,Into the Wild) and he is part of Mr. Brooks' broken psyche. Not having killed in nearly two years, Marshall wants to be let out to play (reflections ofDr. Jekyll & Mr. Hydeare easily seen).Mr. Brooks battles Marshall but, in the end, loses to his darker side and begins killing again. But, unfortunately for all concerned, someone witnesses the murder and wants to blackmail him. But not in the way most would think. Mr. Smith (Dane Cook,Good Luck Chuck) wants Mr. Brooks to teach him how to kill. A strange method of blackmail to be sure, but Mr. Brooks takes this would-be killer under his wing and begins showing him the bloody ropes.Trying to hunt down Mr. Brooks (the police have dubbed him `The Fingerprint Killer' because he does some interesting things at the crime scene with the victims' fingerprints) is Detective Atwood (Demi Moore,Bobby). The meticulous nature of Mr. Brooks, though, makes her job exceptionally tough. No stray hairs (Mr. Brooks vacuums the crime scene prior to leaving), no gun shells (he's got a special way making sure the shells stay with him), nothing to show who this killer might be. Atwood, though, also has problems of her own. She's going through a messy divorce while trying to solve The Fingerprint Killer crimes. For Mr. Brooks, her marital discord becomes an avenue of surprising revelations.The story of Mr. Brooks is morbidly fascinating. He's the guy next door. The successful business man. The good-looking success story. A family man. But he's also a damaged dude. This gives the story a nice multi-facetedness that many movies lack. The added tension surrounding his only daughter who may have inherited some of Daddy's traits makes it even more so.I was surprised again and again by the strong performances from previously unknown areas. As noted earlier, Kevin Costner tends to lean toward the cute-and-fuzzy, but here takes on a role that is anything but, and does some exceptionally great work. Dane Cook, best known as a comedian, plays the role of a twisted wannabe killer with an amazing quality. Demi Moore as a roughshod cop who wants to do it her way and be damned the consequences is very believable.The only problem I had with the film is that every time Mr. Brooks gets ready to kill someone, the people he's ready to rub-out are having sex.

I cannot buy the premise of serial killing as an addiction akin to alchohol or drug addiction.  That is the direction this movie appears to take.Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a successful, wealthy businessman with a loving wife (Marg Helgenberger) and daughter (Danielle Panabaker).  He leads a double life--head of a loving family in one life, serial killer in the other.  Mr. Brooks has an alter ego.  In the few other movies I've seen where a character has one, the alter ego has been played by the same actor.  In an interesting turn, Earl Brooks' alter ego is played chillingly, and somewhat humorously, by William Hurt. The main detective in the story is played by Demi Moore.  Although a multi-millionaire, with obviously no need to work, she is on a quest to prove herself to her father who, at least to her way of thinking, made it clear that he would have preferred a son.Mr. Brooks attends AA meetings, simply identifying himself as an addict, and periodically says 'The Serenity Prayer' in an apparent effort to rid himself of his proclivity for killing other human beings.While I found the movie engrossing, I'm not able to accept that killing other people can be an addiction like, say, alcholism, especially when the killer loves his family and seemingly is normal in every other respect.  How can a man love his family and, at the same time, get his highs from killing other people's loved ones?  I can buy loving your family to distraction and being an alcholic or even a drug addict.  But surely, at some point, you would say to yourself, ""I am ending forever the life of another human being.""

282036,A18G7GG53G2X8A,6301971345,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 6]","""Mr. Brooks"" presents us with fascinating dualities, which in turn shows a depth and complexity that's rarely seen in films about serial killers. For cardboard tycoon Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner), there's a duality between his everyday life and his secret life as the Thumbprint Killer: the former is picture perfect, a wealthy man with a loving wife and daughter; the latter is an unfeeling monster who readily admits that he's addicted to murdering. I initially thought that I was supposed to choose a version of this man to root for. I eventually came to the realization that making this choice would be pointless. I say this because this story is not meant to instill sympathy or even hatred; it merely wants to show Mr. Brooks for who he is, in both good and bad ways. This is very appropriate because, when you get right down to it, there's very little about this man to emotionally invest in.The biggest duality is between Brooks' rational state of mind and his deep-seeded, animalistic urges. His murderous tendencies very cleverly manifest themselves as a man named Marshall (William Hurt), who can only be seen and heard by Brooks. Marshall acts as a driving force, temping Brooks simply because murdering is so much fun. The dynamic between these two characters is incredibly unique, especially since one is nothing more than the other's subconscious mind. In a sense, Marshall is the true serial killer; Brooks is merely a tool, a physical means to commit murder. It's obvious that, at times, Brooks is purposely not trying hard enough to control Marshall--taking a life is just so intoxicating.At other times, Brooks genuinely tries like hell to fight against his urges; on some level, he knows that what he's doing is wrong. At the film's start, we learn that he had managed to avoid temptation for two years, and by then, the possibility of relapsing seemed remote. But then he learns of a young couple attending a dance school, and the urge proves too strong to fight off. With the extreme precision of a master calculator, he's able to break into their apartment and shoot them as they make love. As an extra thrill, he poses their bodies and photographs them. His final touch--his trademark--is to press each victim's thumb into a bloodstain, leaving behind a print.If only Brooks had noticed that the couple left their bedroom drapes open. His carelessness comes back to haunt him in the form of a young voyeur only known as Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). He presents Brooks with incriminating photos; the couple's apartment complex is within range of Smith's camera, and apparently, he had been photographing them for months (they always had sex with their drapes open). But Smith is not interested in turning Brooks in; rather, he wants to join Brooks during his next murder spree. There's a restrained intensity to this character that I really liked, suggestive of an immature teenager desperate to prove himself when he's clearly not ready. Cook played this character brilliantly, giving him just the right mix of arrogance, anger, and naivety. Brooks does agree to Smith's terms, but not before discussing the situation with Marshall. Let's just say that everyone here has a few hidden agendas.All this paves the way for some interesting scenes of victim hunting. At one point, Brooks describes the process as something similar to falling in love: you come across many people, but only a select few have the ability to make your heart pound with excitement. I must admit, I've never heard it put that way before. I must also admit, I loved it; there's a definite charm to this character that shines through despite the fact that he's a sociopath. This doesn't make him a likeable character by any means, but it certainly makes him a bit more compelling. One wonders if he's capable of feeling any emotion, especially when it comes to his family. Without giving too much away, a subplot involving his college-age daughter (Danielle Panabaker) leads him to question certain things; even after moments of reflection, his feelings remain unclear.Hot on the Thumbprint Killer's trail is Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), who's involved in her own subplots: one is about a bitter divorce; the other is about an escaped criminal threatening to track her down. When Brooks is made aware of her, he finds her more fascinating than problematic (the same can't be said for Marshall). Her father is a wealthy businessman, and because of that, she's worth millions. But instead of following in his footsteps, she decided to be a cop. Why is this? Indeed, she is a fascinating character, someone so fragile despite her tough-as-nails appearance.

They're our life, our hope for the future, our legacy.Even after we leave this mortal coil, part of us will live on in our offspring. That's why we will, for the most part, do whatever it takes to protect them and to nurture them.However, we ourselves are the children of our parents. What did we inherit from them? Did we learn to distinguish between right and wrong from them? We didn't just inherit our genetic makeup from our parents.Sadly, strength and weakness is something that we occasionally do inherit.But, as parents, we do try to teach our offspring the difference between what's right and wrong.Part of the movie Mr. Brooks deals with this. I won't explain how - you'll have to watch it for yourself.As a society, we also have to deal with those who are mentally ill. Is crime something that is caused by neurons misfiring, a chemical imbalance? Who knows. Some of the most heinous crimes known today have been caused by mental illness.And then there are people who don't seem to have any sort of illness that commit crime simply because they want to. Maybe these people just get a sick thrill out of hurting others.Sort of like an addiction.Mr. Brooks is a combination of these. He's clearly mentally ill, and he even admits that he's an addict. He gets such a rush out of killing people. But he's smart about it. He's methodical and he goes out of his way to leave no trace behind.After two years of not killing a soul, he finds the urge irresistible and once again targets a couple for death. But this time around, he gets sloppy and leaves the windows open while he commits the murder.Of course, a voyeur took some pictures of him in the act and is able to track him down. Instead of threatening him with blackmail or the like, he wants to become his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.See, this is where the story gets complex. Mr. Brooks is a family man, a very rich and successful business man as well. He loves his family and his outward appearance is that of a great human being.But he has his mental illness and addiction. And his illness manifests itself in the form of Marshall (Portrayed by William Hurt). Together, they're quite the pair and it is very entertaining to watch Earl Brooks interact with the figment of his mental derangement.Throw into the mix a stubborn cop who's been trying to track him down for over two years, who happens to be going through a very nasty divorce at the time.As the plot unfolds, it gets more and more complicated.But in the end, Earl goes out of his way to protect what's his for various reasons, even after he realizes something that horrifies him.More than his addiction to murder.The special features were pretty standard. Director's commentary, as well as three featurettes.There were six deleted scenes to view as well. Most of the scenes had little to do with the advancing of the plot, although one between the detective (played by Demi Moore) was quite interesting, although pointless.And, there was an alternate opening sequence that I found was more entertaining and would have suited the movie more than the original. But, once again, that's entirely my own personal opinion.Overall, it wasn't a dull movie, and it did hold my interest for the full two hours it ran. There was some nudity in the film, and at least they didn't show off Mr. Costner's full body. He's getting a little old for that.Worth watching if you're in the mood for a murder thriller.2.5 out of 5",3,Not your average serial killer,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,3520,"['are', 'few', 'things', 'most', 'decent', 'people', 'world', 'possess', 'more', 'children', ""'re"", 'life', 'hope', 'future', 'legacy.Even', 'leave', 'mortal', 'coil', 'part', 'will', 'live', 'offspring', 'why', 'will', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'whatever', 'protect', 'nurture', 'them.However', 'are', 'children', 'parents', 'What', 'did', 'inherit', 'Did', 'learn', 'distinguish', 'right', 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'inherit', 'genetic', 'makeup', 'parents.Sadly', 'strength', 'weakness', 'something', 'occasionally', 'do', 'inherit.But', 'parents', 'do', 'try', 'teach', 'offspring', 'difference', 'what', 'right', 'wrong.Part', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'yourself.As', 'society', 'also', 'have', 'deal', 'who', 'are', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'Is', 'crime', 'something', 'caused', 'neurons', 'misfiring', 'chemical', 'imbalance', 'Who', 'most', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'known', 'today', 'have', 'been', 'caused', 'mental', 'illness.And', 'then', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'sort', 'illness', 'commit', 'crime', 'simply', 'want', 'Maybe', 'people', 'just', 'get', 'sick', 'thrill', 'hurting', 'others.Sort', 'addiction.Mr', 'Brooks', 'combination', 'clearly', 'mentally', 'ill', 'even', 'addict', 'rush', 'killing', 'people', 'smart', 'methodical', 'way', 'leave', 'trace', 'behind.After', 'two', 'years', 'not', 'killing', 'soul', 'urge', 'irresistible', 'once', 'again', 'couple', 'death', 'time', 'around', 'sloppy', 'windows', 'open', 'murder.Of', 'course', 'voyeur', 'took', 'pictures', 'act', 'able', 'track', 'down', 'Instead', 'threatening', 'blackmail', 'like', 'become', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'where', 'story', 'complex', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'family', 'man', 'very', 'rich', 'successful', 'business', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'outward', 'appearance', 'great', 'human', 'being.But', 'mental', 'illness', 'addiction', 'illness', 'manifests', 'form', 'Marshall', 'Portrayed', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Together', ""'re"", 'pair', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Earl', 'Brooks', 'interact', 'figment', 'mental', 'derangement.Throw', 'mix', 'stubborn', 'cop', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'two', 'years', 'who', 'be', 'going', 'very', 'nasty', 'divorce', 'time.As', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'more', 'more', 'complicated.But', 'end', 'Earl', 'way', 'protect', 'what', 'various', 'reasons', 'even', 'something', 'him.More', 'addiction', 'murder.The', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'pretty', 'standard', 'Director', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'were', 'six', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'view', 'as', 'well', 'Most', 'scenes', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'advancing', 'plot', 'one', 'detective', 'played', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'pointless.And', 'was', 'alternate', 'opening', 'sequence', 'found', 'was', 'more', 'entertaining', 'would', 'have', 'suited', 'movie', 'more', 'original', 'once', 'again', 'entirely', 'own', 'personal', 'opinion.Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'dull', 'movie', 'did', 'hold', 'interest', 'full', 'two', 'hours', 'ran', 'was', 'nudity', 'film', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'off', 'Mr.', 'Costner', 'full', 'body', 'getting', 'little', 'old', 'that.Worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'mood', 'murder', 'thriller.2.5', '5']",Mr. Brooks

Co-writer and sole director, Bruce A. Evans has created something a little original with this genre; a successful pillar of the community: loving husband, father, philanthropist, self-made man and apparently humble about his success; Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is not exactly what he seems to be because, like a lot of people, we have our addictions and like normal middle-class families, keep them from public view: alcohol, drugs, dangerous sporting activities and sex... et al. Mr. Brook's ""addiction"", however, is serial murder.Contrary to the fantasies of literature and film, most career criminals are stupid and usually spend the greater part of their lives in jail. Except those, of course, who work for powerful governments and trained in the art of subterfuge and murder in the name of patriotism. But normally, as the stats reveal, most murders, somewhere around 90%, are so-called crimes of passion or ""drug-crazed"" related. True pre-meditated murder, popularly known as ""joy killing"" or the other, assassination for hire, lies somewhere around 5 to 10%... Mr. Earl Brooks is addicted to joy killing and does it extremely well.The originality of Mr. Brooks is the character's alter ego, Marshall (William Hurt), who, like the ""monkey on the back"", prompts Brooks to commit more killings. Hurt is excellent in this role, pushing, seducing, persuasive and charming to pull Mr. Brooks into another random killing. The dialogue between Brooks and Hurt was performed with utter believability, giving this film-goer hope that Kevin Costner still has something to give us as an actor. Costner did not play Costner in this film but became the character of Mr. Brooks: our faith in this actor has now been restored.Despite the great acting talent, credit should go to writer's Evans & Gideon for a well paced and sharp script. To the point, dialogue without fillers, yet relevant at every turn of the plot. There was never a second in this film where it was thought: ""Ok, c'mon people, get to the point."" The audience sat captivated from start to surprise ending.Most reviews never focus on the finer aspects of a film. Conversely, the brilliant editing in this film by Miklos Wright was outstanding: tight, appropriate and right on the mark.One of the clever ironies of Mr. Brooks is that he attends AA Meetings to stop his ""addiction"" of murder. He goes and stands up and says, ""Hi, I'm Earl and I'm an addict."" The man never goes into his ""story"", however, which in real life would make fascinating listening. ""Serial Killer's Anonymous""... now that would certainly be interesting.Mr. Brooks is well acted, superbly executed and a great surprise.",4,Costner makes come back in good film...,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,2777,"['When', 'finally', 'decide', 'serial', 'killer', 'genre', 'film', 'exhausted', 'possibly', 'avenue', 'one', 'along', 'Co-writer', 'sole', 'director', 'Bruce', 'A.', 'Evans', 'created', 'something', 'little', 'original', 'genre', 'successful', 'pillar', 'community', 'loving', 'husband', 'father', 'philanthropist', 'self-made', 'man', 'apparently', 'humble', 'success', 'Mr.', 'Earl', 'Brooks', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'be', 'because', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'addictions', 'normal', 'middle-class', 'families', 'keep', 'public', 'view', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'dangerous', 'sporting', 'activities', 'sex', 'al', 'Mr.', 'Brook', 'addiction', 'however', 'serial', 'murder.Contrary', 'fantasies', 'literature', 'film', 'most', 'career', 'criminals', 'are', 'stupid', 'usually', 'spend', 'greater', 'part', 'lives', 'jail', 'course', 'who', 'work', 'powerful', 'governments', 'trained', 'art', 'subterfuge', 'murder', 'name', 'patriotism', 'normally', 'stats', 'reveal', 'most', 'murders', 'somewhere', '90', '%', 'are', 'so-called', 'crimes', 'passion', 'drug-crazed', 'related', 'True', 'pre-meditated', 'murder', 'popularly', 'known', 'joy', 'killing', 'other', 'assassination', 'hire', 'somewhere', 'around', '5', '10', '%', 'Mr.', 'Earl', 'Brooks', 'addicted', 'joy', 'killing', 'extremely', 'well.The', 'originality', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'character', 'alter', 'ego', 'Marshall', 'William', 'Hurt', 'who', 'monkey', 'back', 'Brooks', 'commit', 'more', 'killings', 'Hurt', 'excellent', 'role', 'pushing', 'seducing', 'persuasive', 'charming', 'pull', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'random', 'killing', 'dialogue', 'Brooks', 'Hurt', 'was', 'performed', 'utter', 'believability', 'giving', 'film-goer', 'hope', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'still', 'something', 'give', 'actor', 'Costner', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'Costner', 'film', 'became', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'faith', 'actor', 'now', 'been', 'restored.Despite', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'credit', 'should', 'go', 'writer', 'Evans', 'Gideon', 'well', 'paced', 'sharp', 'script', 'point', 'dialogue', 'fillers', 'yet', 'relevant', 'turn', 'plot', 'was', 'never', 'second', 'film', 'where', 'was', 'thought', 'Ok', ""c'mon"", 'people', 'get', 'point', 'audience', 'sat', 'captivated', 'start', 'surprise', 'ending.Most', 'reviews', 'never', 'focus', 'finer', 'aspects', 'film', 'Conversely', 'brilliant', 'editing', 'film', 'Miklos', 'Wright', 'was', 'outstanding', 'tight', 'appropriate', 'right', 'mark.One', 'clever', 'ironies', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'AA', 'Meetings', 'stop', 'addiction', 'murder', 'up', 'Hi', ""'m"", 'Earl', ""'m"", 'addict', 'man', 'never', 'story', 'however', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'make', 'fascinating', 'listening', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'Anonymous', 'now', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'interesting.Mr', 'Brooks', 'well', 'acted', 'superbly', 'executed', 'great', 'surprise']",Mr. Brooks

282042,AOYL9IEFOZ92K,6301971345,Corpsie,"[1, 1]","Ok, I'm going to admit it here. I like Kevin Costner. Sure he isn't the best actor in the world and he's been in some stinkers (I'm talking romantic comedies here, not his killer post-apocalyptic flicks - I'm sure my credibility just flew out the window), but there's something about him that I like. Maybe because he slightly resembles my good ol' pop (RIP) or perhaps it's his nonchalant demeanor that oozes from his ""various"" performances. Either way, the guy has presence on screen.Costner plays Earl Brooks, a loving family man and successful entrepreneur. Unfortunately he suffers from a sort of schizophrenia where William Hurt (Marshall), the evil ""Hyde"" side of Brooks, consistently urges him to kill. We learn that Earl Brooks is actually the ""Fingerprint Killer"" and has been killing for years. It's not a sexual thing as with most serial killers but an addiction. Brooks even attends Alcoholics Anonymous just so he can help control the addiction (though he never reveals his secret).""Mr. Brooks"" is a moral dilemma for the watcher of the film. On the one hand, Brooks is a friendly character who loves his wife and college age daughter and exudes a certain likability. But on the other hand, he is a cold-blooded killer. We see this first hand as he ruthlessly kills a couple in their own home. Brooks is the quintessential ""anti-hero."" He is a man torn by his monstrous addiction and sickness but still lives with his own set of personal moral and family values. He wishes to escape, disappear, or even die because of what he has done, but the presence of his alter-ego Marshall pushes him over the edge. Even Marshall himself is an interesting beast. At first slightly annoying, we, as the audience, wish for Brooks to escape from Marshall's incessant ramblings. But as scenes play out, we come to like the conversations between the two. Marshall's insight is of course Brooks' own internal struggle visualized as a separate being and we discover that this separate being, while cold and ruthless, is incredibly intelligent and cunning.The strengths of this film are of course the main storyline involving a psychopath equally, if not more screwed up than Brooks, who tries to blackmail our main anti-protag and the creepy and very cool sub-story with his daughter.Weaknesses fell with Demi Moore's role as the cop who is obsessed over the ""Fingerprint Killer"" and her impotent attempts to catch him. But this sub-story is overshadowed by a divorce she is going through and another killer who has escaped from prison and stalks her. This specific sub-story could easily have been cut from the film or modified to interweave better with the main story. As it stands now, it's more of an annoyance and I found myself wanting to fast forward past it to the excellent story which it just interrupted.Another weakness was Dane Cook. He added nothing to his ""Mr. Smith"" part and I wonder at the casting of such a weak ""actor."" I say ""actor"" loosely because Cook is anything but. At times it felt like Cook was reading off of cue cards and at others, it seemed like he felt like he had to amp things up until he came off very animated and cartoonish. A poor choice. I read a rumor that Zach Braff was actually picked to carry the role of ""Mr. Smith"" originally.

282044,AUHG8KSHI529U,6301971345,Craig Matteson,"[2, 4]","I liked the psychological and suspense aspects of this movie quite a bit.  However, I marked it down a star because there is a scene of a couple engaging in sex that is unnecessarily graphic and two scenes of murder that have more blood that your local Red Cross.  Explicit sex scenes in ""mainstream"" movies seem silly since our society is so saturated by porn.  Hollywood can't really compete with it (and shouldn't), and half-measures have the worst of both worlds.  They offend people like me and can't titillate those seeking porn.  I will just point you back to ""North by Northwest"" and the steamy sexual tension that passed between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint.  Nothing was shown but the adults had no doubt what passed between them without having to shove anything in anyone's face.  As for the gore in this film, well, it just spoils the psychological elegance the suspense has put in place.  Remember ""Jaws"" worked well because we rarely saw the shark!What is best about the film is the way Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) and his psychopathic alter ego Marshall (William Hurt) work together, talk to each other, and struggle against each other as Earl continues his career as a serial murderer while trying to resist it (by going to AA meetings).  Dane Cook plays a Mr. Smith who becomes aware of who Earl really is behind his Citizen of the Year reputation and tries to blackmail him into allowing him to participate in a murder.We also have Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) who is a millionaire heiress nutjob who has decided to be a cop to work out her issues with her dead father.  She is also trying to work through a divorce (she picks men poorly, too) from a boytoy who wants millions to go away and she doesn't want to give it.  She is bent on solving the ""thumbprint"" murders and begins closing in on Earl Brooks.  However, she also has to look out for an escaped prisoner who is determined to kill her for putting him away in the first place.On top of all this we have Earl's home life.  He is a rich businessman with a wonderful wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger), and a troubled daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker) who has dropped out of her freshman year of college for reasons beyond what she is willing to admit to her parents.How all this mixes together and comes to a head is quite entertaining, at least as entertaining as serial murder can get.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",3,Wonderful interplay between Costner and Hurt that is damaged by some unnecessarily graphic scenes,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,2412,"['liked', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'aspects', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'However', 'marked', 'down', 'star', 'scene', 'couple', 'engaging', 'sex', 'unnecessarily', 'graphic', 'two', 'scenes', 'murder', 'have', 'more', 'blood', 'local', 'Red', 'Cross', 'Explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'seem', 'silly', 'society', 'so', 'saturated', 'porn', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'compete', 'should', ""n't"", 'half-measures', 'have', 'worst', 'worlds', 'offend', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'titillate', 'seeking', 'porn', 'will', 'just', 'point', 'back', 'North', 'Northwest', 'steamy', 'sexual', 'tension', 'passed', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Nothing', 'was', 'shown', 'adults', 'had', 'doubt', 'what', 'passed', 'having', 'shove', 'anything', 'anyone', 'face', 'gore', 'film', 'well', 'just', 'psychological', 'elegance', 'suspense', 'put', 'place', 'Remember', 'Jaws', 'worked', 'well', 'rarely', 'saw', 'shark', 'What', 'best', 'film', 'way', 'Earl', 'Brooks', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'psychopathic', 'alter', 'ego', 'Marshall', 'William', 'Hurt', 'work', 'together', 'talk', 'other', 'struggle', 'other', 'Earl', 'career', 'serial', 'murderer', 'trying', 'resist', 'going', 'AA', 'meetings', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'who', 'aware', 'who', 'Earl', 'really', 'Citizen', 'Year', 'reputation', 'tries', 'blackmail', 'allowing', 'participate', 'murder.We', 'also', 'have', 'Detective', 'Tracy', 'Atwood', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'who', 'millionaire', 'heiress', 'nutjob', 'who', 'decided', 'be', 'cop', 'work', 'out', 'issues', 'dead', 'father', 'also', 'trying', 'work', 'divorce', 'men', 'poorly', 'too', 'boytoy', 'who', 'millions', 'go', 'away', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'bent', 'solving', 'thumbprint', 'murders', 'closing', 'Earl', 'Brooks', 'However', 'also', 'look', 'out', 'escaped', 'prisoner', 'who', 'determined', 'kill', 'putting', 'away', 'first', 'place.On', 'top', 'have', 'Earl', 'home', 'life', 'rich', 'businessman', 'wonderful', 'wife', 'Emma', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'troubled', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'who', 'dropped', 'freshman', 'year', 'college', 'reasons', 'what', 'willing', 'admit', 'parents.How', 'mixes', 'together', 'head', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'least', 'as', 'entertaining', 'serial', 'murder', 'can', 'get.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",Mr. Brooks

282054,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,6301971345,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 3]","Two hours of non-stop anxiety . . . that pretty much sums up Bruce Evan's psychological jaunt, ""Mr. Brooks"" starring Kevin Costner in the title role.  Earl Brooks has just been named businessman of the year.  The owner of a carton manufacturing firm, he lives quite the life; married to the more than attractive Marg Helgenberger with a fine Portland, Oregon home, and a cutsey-tootsey college aged daughter who wants nothing but to quit school and get down to business, following in her father's illustrious footsteps.  Calm and collected as only Kevin Costner can play it, Earl seems a portrait of the all American dream incarnate.Except for one thing--he blows off steam in a profoundly interesting way.  Reminiscent of Brett Easton Ellis' American Psycho, Earl cruises about town accompanied by Marshall (the diabolically amusing William Hurt) the definitive backseat driver who acts not only as Earl's confidant but the ultimate pusher--egging Earl to treat himself to a little well-deserved R&R--in; the form of a well-planned murder.  In fact, Earl has stymied the police for years--known as the Thumbprint Killer, he remains virtually undetectable.Cleverly Marshall acts ala Howard and Glazer's ""A Beautiful Mind,"" as Earl's other persona--existing only in Earl's mind but entirely visible to the audience.  Together Hurt and Costner gleefully feed off each other in a titillating pas-de-deux that illuminates the dark side of the typical Costner role.  Usually taciturn and noble, this Costner plans his murders with a fiendish abandon while Hurt plays the goading devil's advocate.  As the brains and catalyst, Hurt often enables with the frenetic energy of a naughty child; Costner brilliantly plays his part with more stoicism, but frequently and delightfully cannot contain himself.  His bursts of maniac laughter are well worth the price of admission.Alas, all good fun must come to an end when the criminal duo commits a faux pas that has the potential to bring them down.  Voyeur photographer Mr. Smith (comedian Dane Cook) captures Earl on film at the scene of the crime.  He desires a small recompense for keeping his mouth shut--Earl's watcher fancies himself as a serial killer wannabe.  His price for silence?--being able to participate in the next murder and learn from Earl's years of grisly experience.In addition to this, Mr. Brooks must attend to a little problem on the home front. Imagine the tumultuous conversation between Earl and Marshal when Earl sniffs blood on Daughter Dearest's hands and comes to the rather 21st century conclusion that he has passed on his murder addiction to her genetically.What a hoot!  An extremely tired looking Demi Moore ups the fascination ante as the police officer that swears to apprehend the Thumbprint Killer.  Burdened by a wayward husband and side issues of her own, her character, albeit it as ludicrous as the rest maintains this wild ride's momentum to the very end.Most satisfactory however remains Kevin Costner.  An actor that I have never liked, he excels in this role, shining like a multi-faceted jewel, he shifts from stodgy and austere, distraught and distracted to frenetic and abstracted.  Brilliant!  Bravo, Mr. Costner.Okay, the film may suffer from a little too many plot twists and turns.  But rather than make this film less enjoyable, this overkill technique serves to render ""Mr. Brooks"" with a graphic novel-esque feel not unlike `A History of Violence', especially with Hurt again hamming it up in a campy cameo type performance that is hard to beat.  In the same comic book sense, the idea that murder can be a byproduct of success like alcoholism or white collar drug addiction and curbed by regular meetings at the local AA hammers my funny bone to the point where I cannot stop giggling and letting out an occasional howl that sounds much too similar to the vulgar laughter Hurt and Costner share while in Marshal and Earl personae.Bottom line?  `Mr. Brooks' sparkles with a Sweeney Todd type humor that toys with the graphic novel technique employed in ""A History of Violence.""

Keven Costner leads as Mr. Earl Brooks, a mild-mannered box manufacturer and philanthropist with a secret ""addiction"" to serial murder.  His addiction manifests itself in part as an alternate personality, Marshall (well-played by William Hurt), with whom he conducts internal debates over his killing.After a two-year lull, Mr. Brooks indulges his need to kill, but gets careless.  A peeping tom photographer named Smith (Dane Cook) blackmails Brooks for a piece of the action.  To complicate matters, Mr. Brooks' daughter unexpectedly comes home from college, pregnant and trailed by a murder investigation.  Mr. Brooks himself is under suspicion from a Detective Atwater (Demi Moore), a good cop with a tangled personal life.  Mr. Brooks will attempt to resolve the conflicts in his life in the way he knows best, playing a cat-and-mouse game with Atwater and Smith.Costner is superbly convincing in the role, playing loving husband, father and serial killer in a way that likely earns sympathy from a reluctant audience.  His meticulous execution of his crimes has a chilling fascination of its own, while his final confrontations with Smith and Atwater are priceless set-pieces.  William Hurt is equally convincing as Brooks' alter ego.  Since we know from the beginning who the murderer is, the suspense is in whether he will be caught, and how.  A trick double-ending adds to the suspense.  The story might have been streamlined by eliminating at least one of the sub-plots.

BROOKS is a surprisingly good film, one that from the response of critics and audiences at the time of the theatrical release last Spring might make the casual viewer pass by the DVD.  But step into this strange world of the successful, philanthropic, loving husband and father Mr. Brooks and discover one of the more clever twists on the themes of addiction and serial killings, courtesy of a smart script by writer/director Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon.Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner, in what may be his best role) has it all: wealth, fame, Man of the Year, a gorgeous home in Portland, a stunning wife Emma (Marg Helgenberger), a perky college freshman daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker) - and a secret: though he has not been active for two year while attending AA meeting for his addiction to killing, Brooks has a history of being a serial 'Thumbprint' killer.  Brooks is accompanied in his darker life by an alter ego Marshall (William Hurt) who encourages him to take up his old addiction to killing 'because he is so good at it'.  Brooks follows the need and performs another staged murder of a couple during intercourse.  Mistake - he forgets to close the drapes in the room, opening the possibility that he has been seen, a possibility which is realized when he encounters a funky young 'Mr. Smith' (Dane Cook) who just happened to have photographed Brooks' latest adventure and blackmails him into promising to allow 'Mr. Smith' to accompany him on his next murder!Twists and turns occur: daughter Jane returns from college having dropped out apparently because she is pregnant, though there are darker reasons for her move.  A spunky detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), a distraught woman plowing her way through an ugly divorce, takes interest in the newest episode of the return of the Thumbprint killer and faces her own demons from her past experiences as a policewoman. Feeling that Atwood may uncover his crime and thus history, Brooks plans a strange caper that includes 'Mr. Smith' and fearing that daughter Jane may have inherited his bad genes for killing addiction, he takes care of her threatening business before the surprise conclusion of the story.To tell more of the plot would deprive the viewer of the any secrets that unfold in the hands of Brooks and his man Marshall.  The story is smart, well scripted, intense, and exciting.  And in addition to the very fine performances by the stars, there are excellent cameos by Yasmine Delawari, Aisha Hinds, Jason Lewis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Matt Schulze.  Give this poorly reviewed little thriller a chance.  It is very much worth watching on every level.

Demi Moore is a homicide cop, going through a very messy divorce, is running from a mass murderer, and she is a millionare. She is very unlikeable and tougher than any man.

Everyone in the neighborhood knows that this couple has sex with the lights on and the drapes open. Brooks misses this fact in his research? This lapse makes it convenient for the neighbor who is a photogapher to catch him the act. However, the photographer wants to join in with the killing and not turn him in. This is lucky for Mr. Brooks and is unlucky for the photographer of course. How could the photograper plausibly think he could escape being murdered?The only thing this movie has going for it is that Costner does a decent job holding the movie together.

Mr Brooks starring Kevin Costner as the titular character, is a 2007 film that follows a successful local businessman in Portland, Oregon who has a terrible addiction; that addiction being murder.Mr Brooks feeds his addiction and alter-ego (personified here by the brilliant William Hurt) by giving in to these urges and meticulously plans each murder, evading capture by the police and earning himself the moniker, the ""Thumbprint Killer""So far, this sounds awfully like everyone's favourite carrot-topped killer, Dexter right?I'd suggest that this movie is not simply a Dexter clone but a smart little two hour movie with an anti-hero that's a little less endearing than Dexter but makes for compelling viewing and Costner as the serial killer is very believable. His portrayal of Mr Brooks is very human; a family man struggling to control his addiction and hide it from his loved ones, the authorities and the world at large. Empire called this ""The performance of Costner's career"" and I genuinely can't think of a role that he's played which has been more suited to his particular demeanour.I watched this with Mrs Milton and although she enjoyed the movie on the whole, the scenes of violence (although relatively few) shocked her with their graphic nature. The violence is not gratuitous and I would suggest to you that it is very much necessary to illustrate the story that is being told. Speaking of the plot, it is always fairly clear how things are progressing but you are never quite sure how things will turn out. Definitely a bonus.Negatives to this movie? Easy. Demi Moore. I have nothing against the woman but simply think she was mis-cast as the cop chasing the Thumbprint Killer while trying to contend with a messy divorce action at the same time.Many would say this movie isn't a horror... It's about a serial killer that appears for all intents and purposes to be the guy next door.

In writing, whether it's a script, a short story, an essay, a novel, or a simple Freshman Comp assignment, first, second, and third drafts often contain unrealistic or extraneous information that eventually is weeded out by good, solid editing. This script obviously lacked good, solid editing.

Very typical of the very old bit where a devil sits on one shoulder egging the person on to do horrible or dishonest things, and an angel on the other trying its always futile best to dissuade. The battle itself wasn't interesting, because it didn't introduce anything new, and Costner simply wasn't the right actor this role. He's not an ""actor's actor"", someone who can comfortably fit into many different roles. He's more like Brad Pitt, an actor who can shine in certain films, and stink up others to the point of nausea. Costner was terrific in Bull Durham and Tin Cup, not so good in Wyatt Earp, JFK, or Robin Hood. William Hurt, an excellent actor with terrific range (see Kiss of the Spider Woman) didn't do much with what he was given, although to be fair, he wasn't given much. Make no mistake: watching Hurt and Costner duel wasn't like watching Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino (now THAT would be interesting...perhaps even with bad material).This story line should have been enough. But it wasn't. There was the addition of female cop, Demi Moore, who was worth $60+ million dollars, but because she wanted to prove to her father that she was as good as any boy, was a cop. This was supposed to create some interesting tension between Costner's character and Moore's, at least on Costner's side, but didn't. There was also *another* serial killer who had just escaped, one who vowed to get back at Moore.In addition, there's a photographer who liked to watch a certain couple ""get it on"", who was watching when Mr. Brooks killed the couple, and he too wants to become a serial killer.But wait! There's more. I won't say who (even though it's not much of a surprise)...but we have FOUR serial killers, or would-be serial killers, in one movie.I'm a believer in listening to stories. Only give a story what it needs. Nothing more, nothing less. And every element needs to be absolutely believable. If one story line in a story isn't cutting it, if it doesn't make sense, or doesn't have enough to make it stand on its own, then it needs to either take a hike, or have something else removed so that it receives the attention it deserves.That's what I felt happened here. There was too much going on, and most of it was unnecessary and unbelievable. Perhaps if the story focused only on Mr. Brooks himself, and the specific struggle he had, there could have been a good story. The story did not, however, and it suffered.

For about two years he has been able to resist until he listens to his alter ego (played devilishly by William Hurt) to play again.

Truncale ""warriorwriter""","[1, 1]","I have seen Kevin Costner in numerous movies over the years and I have mixed feelings about many of the movies he has starred in; however, this movie (Mr. Brooks) he is perfect for the part.  In this study of deviant behavior, Kevin plays Earl Brooks, who is a successful and respected  businessman, who lives in a beautiful house and is married to a devoted wife and also has  a college age daughter.  He also has another secret life which is being an intelligent and cunning psychopath who loves killing people at various times.  William Hurt plays his realistic alter ego who is always encouraging Brooks to kill again and again.  When he is seen doing one of his murders by a photographer it becomes a cat and mouse game.There is another twist in this story when Brooks finds out his college aged daughter may also take after her father (Like father like daughter) when it comes to killing people.  Demi Moore plays a determined detective who knows she is after a dangerous psychopath, but never seems to nail him.  What makes this movie so unique is that it shows clearly why psychopaths are so dangerous in a society.They are ruthless and cunning people who have absolutely no conscience when it comes to meeting their personal warped needs.In conclusion, this is a movie that everyone, especially law enforcement officers, should see to better understand just how a psychopath's mind works and why they are so dangerous.Rating:  5 Stars.

This dubious premise of the film strains credulity right off the bat.  Then the subsequent plot elements really don't help.  It has the look and feel of an extended cheesy CSI episode, with wealthy perpetrator, an attractive head detective on the case who looks like a model playing at detective and acting tough (Demi Moore), 3/4 of the police being women etc.  It just doesn't wash overall.If you suspend credulity to accept the ridiculous premise, then I grant that Kevin Costner does a credible job as Mr. Brooks and William Hurt as his mental alter-ego, always egging him on to do more crimes.  Costner/Brooks keeps saying that killing is his ""addiction"", just like alcohol, for which he goes to AA meetings so that he can (unsuccessfully) keep it under control.  He does a ""job"" and a younger, slimy, geeky peeping Tom (Dane Cook) photos him doing it.  The peeping Tom then blackmails Mr. Brooks into bringing him along on his next job.(Warning:  Spoiler Alerts Ahead)  The film is mildly entertaining, but is ruined by silly, unrealistic plot elements.  For example: Demi Moore's character is kidnapped by a muscle-bound escaped convict and somehow, though handcuffed, she escapes the getaway van by being flung out the door at 40 mph and smacking into the windshield of a parked car!  This would break multiple bones and cause massive internal injuries in any person, but the beautiful Ms. Moore just gets a superficial head gash and jumps back into action.  Then she's going through a divorce (because she has inherited $60M!!) and her ex is a ridiculous, primping, pretty-boy with a 21-something girlfriend lawyer, negotiating with Moore's own lawyer, a young black woman with no hair and huge earrings.  C'mon!  It seems purposefully unrealistic.  (Of course the smirking boy-toy husband is doomed because he's so unlikeable.)  The final super-ridiculous element is Mr. Brook's spoiled BMW-driving college freshman daughter, a skinny model-type herself, who, the plot would have you believe, has the serial killer ""gene"" and knocked someone off with a hatchet when at college at Stanford.  I'm just thinking, ""Ridiculous!""So I didn't like the set-up of the perpetrator as the serial killer, because he's unrealistically portrayed as a wealthy industrialist and community leader.  The movie didn't convince me on that.  But of course, the public doesn't want to see lonesome losers or black or latino gang members as the perps; the White Upper-class Successful Rich Perp is so much more interesting and PC at the same time! (see The Lincoln Lawyer).And I didn't like the set-up of the detectives on the case because Moore's character is too unbelievably in the CSI mold (Pretty Woman Acting like a Tough Detective and out-machoing the men).  And I didn't like the plot element of the skinny, wealthy college daughter turned serial killer, because it likewise doesn't seem realistic.  And the characters involved in Moore's divorce seem be put there mainly to irritate and strain credulity even more.  (Full disclosure I don't watch CSI-type TV shows for the same reasons I mention here.)As for the three Star actors in this movie, I'm wondering if they took the roles because their careers are fading and they have to settle for second-rate movies.  2 stars for cheesiness.",2,Cheesy Serial Killer Flick Not Helped by Cast of Stars,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,3401,"['Aw', ""C'mon"", 'super-successful', 'president', 'manufacturing', 'facility', 'Man', 'Year', 'serial', 'killer', 'dubious', 'premise', 'film', 'strains', 'credulity', 'right', 'bat', 'Then', 'subsequent', 'plot', 'elements', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'look', 'feel', 'extended', 'cheesy', 'CSI', 'episode', 'wealthy', 'perpetrator', 'attractive', 'head', 'detective', 'case', 'who', 'model', 'playing', 'detective', 'acting', 'tough', 'Demi', 'Moore', '3/4', 'police', 'being', 'women', 'etc', 'just', ""n't"", 'wash', 'suspend', 'credulity', 'accept', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'then', 'grant', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'credible', 'job', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'William', 'Hurt', 'mental', 'alter-ego', 'always', 'egging', 'do', 'more', 'crimes', 'Costner/Brooks', 'saying', 'killing', 'addiction', 'just', 'alcohol', 'AA', 'meetings', 'so', 'can', 'unsuccessfully', 'keep', 'control', 'job', 'younger', 'slimy', 'geeky', 'peeping', 'Tom', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'photos', 'doing', 'peeping', 'Tom', 'then', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'bringing', 'along', 'next', 'job', 'Warning', 'Spoiler', 'Alerts', 'Ahead', 'film', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'ruined', 'silly', 'unrealistic', 'plot', 'elements', 'example', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'kidnapped', 'muscle-bound', 'escaped', 'convict', 'somehow', 'handcuffed', 'getaway', 'van', 'being', 'flung', 'out', 'door', '40', 'mph', 'smacking', 'windshield', 'parked', 'car', 'would', 'break', 'multiple', 'bones', 'cause', 'massive', 'internal', 'injuries', 'person', 'beautiful', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'just', 'superficial', 'head', 'gash', 'jumps', 'back', 'action', 'Then', 'going', 'divorce', 'inherited', '60M', 'ex', 'ridiculous', 'primping', 'pretty-boy', '21-something', 'girlfriend', 'lawyer', 'negotiating', 'Moore', 'own', 'lawyer', 'young', 'black', 'woman', 'hair', 'huge', 'earrings', ""C'mon"", 'purposefully', 'unrealistic', 'course', 'smirking', 'boy-toy', 'husband', 'doomed', 'so', 'unlikeable', 'final', 'super-ridiculous', 'element', 'Mr.', 'Brook', 'spoiled', 'BMW-driving', 'college', 'freshman', 'daughter', 'skinny', 'model-type', 'who', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'serial', 'killer', 'gene', 'knocked', 'someone', 'off', 'hatchet', 'when', 'college', 'Stanford', ""'m"", 'just', 'thinking', 'Ridiculous', 'So', 'did', ""n't"", 'set-up', 'perpetrator', 'serial', 'killer', 'unrealistically', 'portrayed', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'community', 'leader', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'convince', 'course', 'public', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'lonesome', 'losers', 'black', 'latino', 'gang', 'members', 'perps', 'White', 'Upper-class', 'Successful', 'Rich', 'Perp', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'PC', 'same', 'time', 'see', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', '.And', 'did', ""n't"", 'set-up', 'detectives', 'case', 'Moore', 'character', 'too', 'unbelievably', 'CSI', 'mold', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Acting', 'Tough', 'Detective', 'out-machoing', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'plot', 'element', 'skinny', 'wealthy', 'college', 'daughter', 'turned', 'serial', 'killer', 'likewise', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic', 'characters', 'involved', 'Moore', 'divorce', 'seem', 'be', 'put', 'there', 'mainly', 'irritate', 'strain', 'credulity', 'even', 'more', 'Full', 'disclosure', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'CSI-type', 'TV', 'shows', 'same', 'reasons', 'mention', 'here', 'three', 'Star', 'actors', 'movie', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'took', 'roles', 'careers', 'are', 'fading', 'have', 'settle', 'second-rate', 'movies', '2', 'stars', 'cheesiness']",Mr. Brooks
282088,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,6301971345,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","Kevin Costner is one of those actors that I never quite know what to expect from his movies. He's had plenty of hits throughout his relatively long career, yet he's also had his fair share of stinkers to balance things out. This is the man who made the terrific film's ""The Bodyguard"" and ""Wyatt Earp"" that were well received by fans, yet followed them up with movies like ""The Postman"" and ""Waterworld"" that were utterly horrible. He's the kind of actor that after certain movie roles such as, ""Dragonfly"", you just want to go, ""What the heck were you thinking when you made that movie? Did you actually think that sounded like a winner?"" But then he'll turn around and crank out a hit like ""The Guardian"" and you'll feel like saying ""Now that's more like it. That was a good movie from start to finish."" Anyways, with all that being said, when I saw the trailers for Costner's first truly villainous role in the thriller ""Mr. Brooks"", I was truly intrigued to see just what he'd do with such a part, because if handled properly this could prove to be one of his best roles to date. Yet, at the same time I was a little skeptical about the quality of this obviously serious movie with the likes of Dane Cook in the film, I thought maybe Costner had once again chosen a stinker to follow up his last couple of hits.""Mr. Brooks"" is the story of a successful businessman named Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) who has his own business, a lovely wife (Marg Helgenberger), and college age daughter, essentially he has a perfectly normal, happy life. But on the inside Earl struggles with a very dark, evil side that is embodied by a creation he calls Marshall (William Hurt). Earl struggles on a daily basis to overcome Marshall's dark desires of murder, he prays often and attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly, but both to no avail, in the end Marshall seems to win out, and Earl is growing tired of his weakness. During an attempt to sate Marshall's thirst for blood, Earl makes a costly error by killing a couple whose window shades are open, and to Earl's dismay a man across the street saw everything. Now that same man (Dane Cook) is blackmailing Earl into taking him along for the ride during his next murder, a fact that further complicates Earl's life since he had decided the previous murder would be his last no matter what. On top of all of this a detective (Demi Moore), who is struggling through a nasty divorce, is on the trail of Earl, and will not rest until this elusive murderer is brought down once and for all.As unsure as I was in regards to what my thoughts would be on ""Mr. Brooks"", after watching the movie I must say that this film is definitely one of Kevin Costner's best movies, and definitely his best performance to date. All of the actors in this movie are in exceptional form; each brings such richness to their individual characters making it easy to become completely enthralled in the movie. As I said Kevin Costner gives the best performance of his career, his character of Earl is so complex with so many different identities to comprise him, from businessman, to loving husband and father, to cold and calculating killer. Each identity Costner handled so well, of course most were not unfamiliar to him as he had played the businessman, husband and father in previous movies, but playing a killer is new territory and Costner plays it to eerie perfection. Each of the supporting actors were equally solid in their roles, with Dane Cook being the biggest surprise, who knew he had such a knack for drama. But the best supporting performance would have to be that of William Hurt's devilish portrayal of Mr. Brooks' dark side, Marshall. Hurt's performance was so engaging that he stole every single scene he was in, and he delivered every line with a hint of malice and complete disregard for human life, that you'd swear if this guy was in complete control of Earl, he would be the kind of guy that would rather kill you than talk to you.What's surprising is that director Bruce A.

Overall, Mr. Brooks is a pretty good movie, though I do have two major reservations.The first is a subplot involving an escaped murderer named Meeks who, with his psychotic girlfriend, make it their mission to exact revenge on Detective Atwood (Demi Moore). The problem here is that this subplot never even intersects the main story in an integral way. It seemed an excuse to throw two over-the-top action sequences into a movie that otherwise would (and should) have none. This subplot is eventually forced to resolution with the main story in off-screen actions made by the titular character (for no clear reason aside from his admiration for Atwood) and it could have been entirely edited out of the film (for want of about 7 minutes of footage) and none would have been the wiser. If they had done this, I would have given the movie 4 stars.The second problem I have with this movie is the way they handle the cemetery scene. I'm sure the writers thought it was clever to have Brooks play with ""Smith"" a while, but the sequence felt cheesy and the drama was forced. The handling of this scene, along with the inclusion of the final ""dream-sequence"" (dream-sequences are cop-outs with very few exceptions) detracted from my sense of satisfaction at having watched this movie. The omenous atmosphere around Brooks' daughter was already established and palpable, making the dream sequence entirely unnecessary.Mr. Brooks is not worth buying, but definitely worth renting.",3,"Interesting and entertaining, but with serious flaws.",1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,1594,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'film', 'inplausible', 'situations', 'film', 'are', 'exception', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'major', 'reservations.The', 'first', 'subplot', 'involving', 'escaped', 'murderer', 'named', 'Meeks', 'who', 'psychotic', 'girlfriend', 'make', 'mission', 'exact', 'revenge', 'Detective', 'Atwood', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'problem', 'here', 'subplot', 'never', 'even', 'main', 'story', 'integral', 'way', 'seemed', 'excuse', 'throw', 'two', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'would', 'should', 'have', 'none', 'subplot', 'eventually', 'forced', 'resolution', 'main', 'story', 'off-screen', 'actions', 'made', 'titular', 'character', 'clear', 'reason', 'aside', 'admiration', 'Atwood', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'edited', 'film', 'want', '7', 'minutes', 'footage', 'none', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wiser', 'had', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '4', 'stars.The', 'second', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'way', 'handle', 'cemetery', 'scene', ""'m"", 'sure', 'writers', 'thought', 'was', 'clever', 'have', 'Brooks', 'play', 'Smith', 'while', 'sequence', 'felt', 'cheesy', 'drama', 'was', 'forced', 'handling', 'scene', 'inclusion', 'final', 'dream-sequence', 'dream-sequences', 'are', 'cop-outs', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions', 'detracted', 'sense', 'satisfaction', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'omenous', 'atmosphere', 'Brooks', 'daughter', 'was', 'already', 'established', 'palpable', 'making', 'dream', 'sequence', 'entirely', 'unnecessary.Mr', 'Brooks', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'definitely', 'worth', 'renting']",Mr. Brooks

Well the laugh was on me, for after about ten minutes you know you're watching something really special.  I've always liked Costner, but even his mother might tell him that in recent years it seems he's lost his way, but without all that baggage, say if he was a new actor, the critics might have noticed that this performance here is worthy of an Oscar, as the businessman tamped down tight as a drum.  He runs a box factory which is perfect for his part, for he is like Pandora's box, pretty on the outside but with all the evils in the world just waiting to be tapped and let loose on an unsuspecting world.His opposite number, Demi Moore, is awesome also.  Again, another stunning actress who doesn't get the praise people award say, Dame Helen Mirren and why?  Bad choices in the past methinks!  If you have the DVD be sure to watch the deleted scenes feature--practically all of them feature Demi's character, Tracy Atwood, and at least one of them has a splendid and unexpected twist in Atwood's character--all I can say is, for an actress to have so many meaty bits left on the cutting floor is a real slap in the face, and the wonder is, the movie didn't even need those missing parts and neither did Demi's performance, though if she's annoyed I can't blame her!Though they make a big deal out of the fact that Costner is Portland's man of the year, the landscape looks very un-Portland.  I was expecting to see a motice at the end of the movie that the location scenes were filmed in Vancouver or Toronto...  the way most pictures for the past 20 years have been--to save money I guess.  Perhaps the falling dollar has made Canada not so attractive to film companies nowadays?  I was thunderstruck to see that the footage in question was filmed in Shreveport Louisiana!  No wonder it looks nothing like Portland!  You'd think they could just tweak the script a little and instruct the actors to play it Southern style.

It isn't so much of a thriller, as it is a different take/point of view on the serial killer that we normally don't see in most Hollywood films of today.Kevin Costner plays Mr. Brooks and this is one of Costner's best performances to date. Mr. Brooks is a respectable business man, whom has won a business man of the year award, is a loving husband & father. He seems like the guy next door, whom you could trust with your life. Yet Mr. Brooks has another darker, secret side of his life, that of a serial killer and he somehow has managed to compartmentalize his two different lifestyles. One lifestyles never meets the other one.Mr. Brooks sees himself more of an addict, much like that of an alcoholic or drug addict and attends meetings aimed for recovering substance abusers in hopes that a 12 step program will help him curb his addiction to killing (Of course, Mr. Brooks never states he is a serial killer at the meetings, just that he's an addict).Another interesting aspect of this movie is William Hurts role, which is that of Mr. Brooks' conscience/counterpart. We see the two interact throughout the movie and are given insight to what Mr. Brooks is thinking and feeling, which is an interesting perspective and nicely done.This movie is very captivating/engaging throughout its entirety and keeps you guessing to the end as to how it will turn out.... will the police catch him or will he get away with his crimes?",5,I'm Addicted....,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,1564,"['really', 'captivating', 'original', 'movies', 'great', 'screenplays', 'meaningful', 'dialogue', 'great', 'acting', '..', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'thriller', 'different', 'take/point', 'view', 'serial', 'killer', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'today.Kevin', 'Costner', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'one', 'Costner', 'best', 'performances', 'date', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'respectable', 'business', 'man', 'whom', 'won', 'business', 'man', 'year', 'award', 'loving', 'husband', 'father', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'whom', 'could', 'trust', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'darker', 'secret', 'side', 'life', 'serial', 'killer', 'somehow', 'managed', 'compartmentalize', 'two', 'different', 'lifestyles', 'One', 'never', 'meets', 'other', 'one.Mr', 'Brooks', 'more', 'addict', 'much', 'alcoholic', 'drug', 'addict', 'meetings', 'aimed', 'recovering', 'substance', 'abusers', 'hopes', '12', 'step', 'program', 'will', 'help', 'curb', 'addiction', 'killing', 'course', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'never', 'serial', 'killer', 'meetings', 'just', 'addict', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'movie', 'William', 'Hurts', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'conscience/counterpart', 'see', 'two', 'interact', 'movie', 'are', 'given', 'insight', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'nicely', 'done.This', 'movie', 'very', 'captivating/engaging', 'entirety', 'guessing', 'end', 'how', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'will', 'police', 'catch', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'crimes']",Mr. Brooks

282104,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6301971345,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 5]","Director Bruce A. Evans' previous project behind the camera was the 1992 movieKuffswith Christian Slater.  After 15 years, he helms ""Mr. Brooks.""  Perhaps by 2022, he'll direct again.  While he did have an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for ""Stand By Me"" & is one of two writers for this film, the major flaw for the movie is its premise.  One cannot successfully have a main character through which the audience views the action that is a serial killer.  Whoopi Goldberg tried it inHomer and Eddie, playing a character whose brain tumor caused her to kill.  That film didn't work either.  The fatal flaw is that you can't root for a serial killer.  Yes, Earl Brooks does TRY NOT to kill, but he isn't successful.  Trying to suggest prescriptive screenwriting, we could twist motivation where the character is killing for a higher purpose, such as a soldier in war or a patriotic spy on a mission.  The screenwriters could have shifted viewpoint and seen the movie through Tracy Atwood's eyes.  But as is, ""Mr. Brooks"" simply doesn't work.  It is a well-done failure, but the film does not work because of the screenwriting.Demi Moore may or may not have been the actress chosen if her character Tracy Atwood had been our focal point.  Moore has had some great films including the classic ""Ghost"" and a couple of very interesting films likeThe Butcher's Wife&The Scarlet Letter.  She even played bad girl in ""Charlie's Angels.""  As Tracy Atwood, she has an edge, going through a divorce.  She plays a detective who is wealthy and yet has something to prove, which causes her to catch bad guys.  One of the thrilling film sequences comes from a convict's vendetta as she is abducted in a great car chase.Kevin Costner is the star of the film.  As a movie star, we like to root for Kevin.  His Oscar is for Best Director for ""Dances with Wolves,"" and we like to see him cast as the good guy.  As Mr. Brooks, he's simply too nice.  He is not the quiet guy next door.  He's the man of the year.  He heads a major business.  The part could have been written for a man bored who needs sport to add spice to his life.  Instead, we have a psychologically splintered murder addict.  The screenwriters try to make him nicer, even sending him to AA meetings.  The scariest part of his performance is when at several times he breaks out into a big laugh at something that's not funny.  Other than those few moments, he seems sane.William Hurt plays his alter ego Marshall that urges him to satiate his craving.  Hurt won his Best Actor Oscar back in 1985 for ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" and was nominated in 2005 forA History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series).  As Marshall, he is creepy.  Maybe if we'd seen Marshall enter Brooks' body and actually commit the murders, the film might have worked better.  Hurt does a good job playing someone who is not actually there.The supporting players do good work.  Comic Dane Cook who had the small part of George in ""London"" is immensely unlikable as Mr. Smith.  Marg Helgenburger who has two Golden Globe nominations for TV's ""CSI"" looks great as trusting wife Emma.  Danielle Panabaker from ""Yours, Mine & Ours"" & ""Sky High"" is somewhat spooky as Jane.  The film never totally lets you know if she's actually inherited her father's penchant for gore or not.  There is always a question mark.  Jason Lewis who had a small part in ""The Jacket"" has a cameo as Tracy Atwood's husband.  He looks good and does an adequate job in a small role.  Reiko Aylesworth who has played on several episodes of TV's ""24"" does a VERY nice job as Jessie's lawyer, anxious to screw Tracy Atwood financially on behalf of her client as well as some extraneous screwing around.From cinematography to sound, the technical aspects of the film are excellent.  It does provide a few scares along the way.  Unfortunately, while well done in many ways, it is fatally flawed because of the screenplay.

We also find out that he is a devoted husband and father, a dedicated community philanthropist, and terrified at the prospect that he will be exposed as a killer.His character is the best thing in the movie, even if it makes the audience uncomfortable that you are pushed into identifying with a murderer.  The most interesting thing about the writing is that a second character, played by William Hurt, is created only to represent that part of Mr. Brooks that is compelled to do bad things.  It's tricky and as you watch you have to accept that Brooks is ""talking"" to ""Marshall"" (sometimes in extended sequences) while other characters in the room not only don't see ""Marshall"", but don't notice that Mr. Brooks is taking time off from his conversation with a ""real"" character to dialogue his inner demon.Mr. Brooks is good at being a serial killer, choosing his victims so carefully and leaving no condemning evidence behind that the police are not sniffing his trail.  He's more careful and anal than ""Dexter"". (Perhaps more narrative tension would have been generated if the police WERE closer to catching him.) He hasn't killed for two years when the movie opens.  He attends AA meetings trying to shed his addiction to murder.  (""Marshall"" sarcastically chides him that he is a hypocrite in the sense that he only says that he is an ""addict"" and not ""I killed two people last night"".) Mr. Brooks is deliberately careless in his return to murder, and has his picture taken by photograph voyeur Dane Cook from the apartment building across from his latest murders.  Rather than informing the police (believable), saying nothing (believable in our real world), trying to blackmail Mr. Brooks for money (certainly believable in a movie world), or selling his photos on ebay (believable given the intelligence of Mr. Cook's character), Cook's voyeur instead blackmails Mr. Brooks into making him an apprentice.I don't know how many serial killers a movie needs, but ""Silence of the Lambs"" got it right and Mr. Brooks misses by at least one.An interesting subplot develops with a daughter who abruptly drops out of her freshman year of college after a mysterious murder of a classmate.As I mentioned, the police are not close to catching Mr. Brooks.  The cop most closely following the ""Thumbprint Killer"" is played by Demi Moore, and a sharply written deftly performed female detective would have added another satisfying dimension to the film.  Unfortunately, ""Detective Atwood"" is written as a 2-dimensional rich Daddy's girl who became a cop because Daddy never loved her otherwise, although he left her 60 million dollars, which her dirtbag restaurateur about-to-be 2nd ex-husband is trying to get in negotions.  Even more unfortunately, this shallow character is portrayed by Demi Moore with little more skill than a cardboard cutout.  Where is Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling (or even Julianne Moore's?) when you need her?So - do I recommend it?  Yes, but not enthusiastically, and I lament what this movie COULD have been.",4,An interesting character study of a serial killer could have been better,1220659200,"09 6, 2008",2008,3134,"['find', 'opening', 'moments', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'title', 'character', 'serial', 'killer', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'devoted', 'husband', 'father', 'dedicated', 'community', 'philanthropist', 'terrified', 'prospect', 'will', 'be', 'exposed', 'killer.His', 'character', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'even', 'audience', 'uncomfortable', 'are', 'pushed', 'identifying', 'murderer', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'writing', 'second', 'character', 'played', 'William', 'Hurt', 'created', 'only', 'represent', 'part', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'compelled', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'tricky', 'watch', 'have', 'accept', 'Brooks', 'talking', 'Marshall', 'sometimes', 'extended', 'sequences', 'other', 'characters', 'room', 'not', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Marshall', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'taking', 'time', 'off', 'conversation', 'real', 'character', 'dialogue', 'inner', 'demon.Mr', 'Brooks', 'good', 'being', 'serial', 'killer', 'choosing', 'victims', 'so', 'carefully', 'leaving', 'condemning', 'evidence', 'police', 'are', 'not', 'sniffing', 'trail', 'more', 'careful', 'anal', 'Dexter', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'narrative', 'tension', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'generated', 'police', 'WERE', 'closer', 'catching', ""n't"", 'killed', 'two', 'years', 'when', 'movie', 'AA', 'meetings', 'trying', 'shed', 'addiction', 'murder', 'Marshall', 'sarcastically', 'hypocrite', 'sense', 'only', 'addict', 'not', 'killed', 'two', 'people', 'last', 'night', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'deliberately', 'careless', 'return', 'murder', 'picture', 'taken', 'photograph', 'voyeur', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'apartment', 'building', 'latest', 'murders', 'Rather', 'informing', 'police', 'believable', 'saying', 'nothing', 'believable', 'real', 'world', 'trying', 'blackmail', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'money', 'certainly', 'believable', 'movie', 'world', 'selling', 'photos', 'ebay', 'believable', 'given', 'intelligence', 'Mr.', 'Cook', 'character', 'Cook', 'voyeur', 'instead', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'making', 'apprentice.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'serial', 'killers', 'movie', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'got', 'right', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'least', 'one.An', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'daughter', 'who', 'abruptly', 'freshman', 'year', 'college', 'mysterious', 'murder', 'classmate.As', 'mentioned', 'police', 'are', 'not', 'close', 'catching', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'cop', 'most', 'closely', 'following', 'Thumbprint', 'Killer', 'played', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'sharply', 'written', 'deftly', 'performed', 'female', 'detective', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'satisfying', 'dimension', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Detective', 'Atwood', 'written', '2-dimensional', 'rich', 'Daddy', 'girl', 'who', 'became', 'cop', 'Daddy', 'never', 'loved', 'otherwise', 'left', '60', 'million', 'dollars', 'dirtbag', 'restaurateur', 'about-to-be', '2nd', 'ex-husband', 'trying', 'get', 'negotions', 'Even', 'more', 'unfortunately', 'shallow', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'little', 'more', 'skill', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'Where', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Clarice', 'Starling', 'even', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'when', 'need', 'So', 'do', 'recommend', 'Yes', 'not', 'enthusiastically', 'lament', 'what', 'movie', 'COULD', 'have', 'been']",Mr. Brooks

Smith,"[2, 2]","This is the best thing Kevin Costner has done in some time and he's entirely believeable as Earl Brooks, Portland's Businessman of the Year, and very experienced serial killer. It's an addiction with him, one he's been able to control for two years by going to AA meetings (and praying a lot), but now he's fallen off the wagon. And even though he takes extreme precautions -- and has remained free because of them -- now someone has seen him. In exchange for keeping his secret, ""Mr. Smith"" wants to ride along on Brooks's next homicidal outing. What really makes the film, though, is William Hurt as Earl's alter ego. (Superego? ""Dark Passenger,"" in the Dexter sense?) Hurt gives us a marvelous insight on how Earl's mind works, and is sort of a foil for what the viewer wants to know. Demi Moore, as the independently wealthy detective trying to track down the serial killer while also being involved in a messy, greedy divorce, is much less good. She's also -- the third thread -- involved in trying to locate a previous killer she had captured and sent to prison, which doesn't actually have anything to do with Brooks. And I was sure Brooks was going to arrange that particular psychopath's death, but no; he has a different target in mind. Then there's yet another sub-plot involving Earl's daughter, a college freshman, who has quit school and come home pregnant, and who may have murdered another student in her dorm. Or may not have. Her father thinks she did, and goes to some lengths to protect her. But his certainly (which he sees as her inheriting his ""murder"" gene) may be only in his own mind. There are some plot holes here and there -- we all know that obtaining the camera's memory stick doesn't mean having ""all the copies,"" and there was a lot of traceable blood left on the ground and on the shovel at the cemetery -- but this is generally a very well written, well acted, and thought-provoking film.

The trouble is that this is not reality, and the movie trades on our affection for these actors to cover the heinousness of their deeds and the absurdity of the movie's proposition.William Hurt's role as Costner's imaginary, sly alter ego is also strongly reminiscent of the Paul Bettany role of imaginary friend in A Beautiful Mind; with a different purpose.

From a psychological standpoint, its an extremely intriguing film delving into such issues as whether someone can pass along sociopathic tendencies to one's children, how a murderer can maintain ""normal"" relationships with family members, the stereotypical serial killer mentality of wanting to show off his acts by taunting police/investigators, etc., whether or not someone with homicidal tendancies is an ""addict,"" etc.  Also, from a legal and criminological standpoint this film is also interesting, with many twists and turns as the plot unfolds.Overall, I thought the acting was great, the concepts terrifying and the movie truly an exciting ride.

Truth be told, I picked this up at the video store the other night and decided to give it a whirl.  It's ten years after Waterworld, and I was a bit disappointed to see that Kevin Costner's acting skills have not changed.  Still, this was a good movie.Kevin Costner is Mr. Brooks, a white collar Oregon businessman who seems to have everything - a successful business, wealth, a wonderful wife, etc.  He is hiding a dark secret, unknown to all.  He is a serial killer known locally as the Thumbprint Killer.  William Hurt is his alter ego, the little devil on his shoulder who is egging him on to give into his urges and invisable to all.  He's resisted temptation (in physical form of Hurt) for two years, but one night he gives into his urges and kills again.It's hard to read into this too deeply, because the story eventually becomes convoluted and a little too hoaky.  Demi Moore is the ambicious policewoman after him, dealing with her own personal issues (the cheating husband she is slugging it out in divorce court with, her boss, her father, etc.).  A man across the street from the house where Mr.Books murders a couple just happens to be taking pictures and attempts to blackmail Mr.Brooks into teaching him how to.  Mr.Brook's daughter returns from college, announcing that she is dropping out and clearly hiding something from her family.  Here Mr.Brooks attempts to play several roles.  He is the father trying to make everything alright for his daughter; but, I guess if your father is a serial killer and you as the child have inherited his need to kill, the only solution is to kill someone else at the college and lead the police investigation someplace else.  When Mr.Smith chooses someone to kill, you know who he chooses is going to somehow interlock with the rest of the story.  And the circumstances about Demi Moore's father issues are just a rip off of Clarice Starling (just like every movie with a female cop has been since).It is a good movie.  It makes some valid points about addiction and how people are willing to do anything and everything to satisfy their wants.

282131,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,6301971345,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[1, 1]","Mr. Brooks has a disease: he is addicted to murder.  He tries to treat himself by going to AA meetings and prayer, but eventually he will give in.  His alter-ego, played quite well by William Hurt, is the side of him that he doesn't like to let out.  The chemistry between his two selves works well -- and the filmmakers do a good job allowing his conversations with his other self to integrate seemlessly into the action, so that he can think out loud in the presence of others and not be heard.  To others he simply appears distracted.Probably the best thing about this film is the brilliant casting of William Hurt as Kevin Costner's alter-ego. Costner has been criticized for only playing variations on the same part in all his films: handsome, charming, pleasant but giving off the impression that he's not saying all he thinks, that there is a brooding undercurrent.  In some roles he plays up the charm and in others the brooding undercurrent -- here, it seems, William Hurt gives voice to the brooding and dark and sly hidden persona underneath all of the charm.  He is also charming, but much more sinister -- an ideal counterpart to Costner's screen persona.  One important touch on the part of the filmmakers was to make clear that it was Costner as Brooks who ultimately made all the decisions and committed all of the murders -- his alterego could suggest, encourage, even beg, but he himself was conscious of and took responsibility for all of his crimes.So far this makes for an interesting twist on the serial killer theme that has become a staple of Hollywood film.  It establishes clearly the internal conflict and allows the audience (at least the non sociopaths among us) to achieve the necessary partial identification with the main character -- since he hates what he sometimes allows himself to do, when he yields to the urgings of his alter ego.  The complication arises when he messes up and someone sees him -- but instead of wanting to bribe him, ""Mr. Smith"" (played convincingly by comedian Dane Cook) wants in: he wants to go along for the next time.  This is another intriguing twist, so at least this far the movie sounded like something different and interesting -- I'm not generally a huge fan of serial killer films but at least this one seemed unique.  There is a bit of a reflexive moment here: ""Mr. Smith,"" like us, was watching the crime through a window just as we are watching on the screen, he was entertained and wanted more, just as, presumably, we are being entertained and will wait eagerly for more action and violence.The real trouble is that the filmmakers try to build a series of subplots into the story that are increasingly implausible.  There is the cop (a badly miscast Demi Moore) who is investigating the ""thumbprint murderer"" (Mr. Brooks), whose first husband was killed, who is extremely wealthy but feels the need to be a cop, is now involved in a painful divorce with a former male model who apparently married her for her money, is being hunted down by another serial killer who she had put in prison but recently escaped, ... it all starts to seem a bit hokey.  Then add in the story of the daughter, who has recently withdrawn from college, and is apparently pregnant, and is being questioned in relation to a brutal homicide with an ax ... it started to feel like some kind of absurd parody of serial killer film plots, but it was all played so seriously that I think the absurdity was unintended.  At times the film really seemed to switch genres -- as when the cop (Moore) gets into an intense, MTV style shootout with a couple of killers in a hall, with flickering flourescent lights creating a strobe-like effect.This is not without some entertainment value, and has a few things about it that are interesting from the standpoint of thinking about film, but I can't say I found much else to be valuable here.  It wants to be a film suggesting that all of us have a darker side, that at the very least all of us get turned on or entertained a bit by violence or we wouldn't be watching this film.  I don't know, though -- I'm not sure I find that message enlightening or convincing (and how many times have filmmakers tried to ""enlighten"" their audience about their own complicity in the subject matter of the film -- as if the filmmaker were seeking to exculpate themselves for making a film about violence by saying to the audience: ""isn't this what you want to see?  It's not my fault then that I make it for you.""). I picked this film up because I like the doppelganger theme, and am generally intrigued by William Hurt's performances and thought the pairing of William Hurt and Kevin Costner would be interesting -- not because I enjoy watching violence (not to say that I am generally put off by it either -- it just has to work in the context of the film).  It is to the filmmaker's credit that they don't push too hard on the ""everybody has a dark side"" theme -- at least there is no condemnatory monologue or anything like that.  A few intriguing performances, and a few interesting twists, but as a whole I just don't think it all worked together in a satisfying way.",3,"Somewhat intriguing twist on the serial killer theme, but

Dane Cook is surprisingly good, not great, though, and the film would have benefited from a deeper actor and I would have to say the same for Demi Moore.The film is shot/directed and written well.....as long as the self-indulgences of the writers' comments in the Special Features interviews aren't swallowed.  It is a nitpicking on my part, but here goes:  the writers refer to Mr. Brooks' being ""desperate"" in dealing with his problem....eh, not quite.  Where there is a fascinating view into the facets of his struggle, ""desperate"" is not an adjective I would use with confidence...that conjures up a greater complex approach to his crimes and the ""voice"" and so forth, i.e. what Hurt's character says to him at the A.A. meeting regarding Brooks' dishonesty or even William Hurt's comment in his interview regarding Brooks' strategy of attending an A.A. meeting to deal with his psychopathology as being ""absurd"".  I mean, let's be real here!IF the writers' opinion of ""desperation"" were infused within the storyline as to sell us on a greater compassion towards Mr. Brooks with no accompanied complexities of that ""desperation"", then I would level a low rating. The film does not do that.  It depicts the twisted/despicable acts on its face without minimizing his darkness or simplistically converting him to the light.

In Mr. Brooks, Costner goes from the wealthy family man stereotype to hideous fiend in a flash. You have never seen Costner like this and never in a film that lets the sets spray red.The story is about the mild-mannered family man and wealthy entrepreneur Mr. Brooks who harbours a dark secret double life as `the thumbprint killer' (beastly played by William Hurt). He kills young couples in their bedrooms to satisfy his ferocious hunger for murder. Even though he has managed to abstain for a number of years, through alcoholic anonymous group therapy, he returns to his nasty misbehaviour only to be caught in the act by a wannabe killer who blackmails Brooks into taking him on a murder spree. Demi Moore appears as the detective who has devoted her life to tracking down the thumbprint killer. A third killer emerges on the scene to make things even more complex.It is a very good story for the most part and there is a subplot involving Brooks' daughter possibly committing a murder.

That's all I could think every time she appeared.The film seems undecided between making Moore a central focus, an almost equal or equal storyline, and relegating her to entire secondary status. It comes closer to the latter when it comes to screen-time -- but there's been no proportionate scaling down of script and plot.

We asked each other this question three times as the film got stupider and stupider. It was like watching a traffic accident: You know better, but you want to see what happens.Well, nothing happens, unless you enjoy seeing a 20-year old girl stabbing her father in the neck with a pair of scissors.This film is an amoral piece of trash.

Costner, as Brooks, goes to AA meetings because of his ""addiction,"" which is serial killing. The moron played by Dana Cook just likes to see people getting killed because it's fun. William Hurt is an embarrassment as Brooks' alter ego.

282150,A1HWIMNX1N9CF2,6301971345,Raz,"[2, 3]","Some good ideas become too wrapped up in themselves and then lost - thus is the case with Mr. Brooks.  Let's start off with the concept.Decent idea - let's have a serial killer (Kevin Costner) who's evil alter-ego (William Hurt), is a tangible, real person who actually appears standing, sitting and walking besides our killer, encouraging him every step of the way.  Cool.  Good idea and concept - now what?What happens next is the movie takes a sudden plunge and never recovers the instant Demi Moore's character is introduced.  Demi plays the part of a completely unbelievable detective whose task it is to solve the serial murders.  The part of the investigator could have, and certainly should have, been played by anyone other than Demi.  But let's assume that Demi simply acted out the part that was scripted for her - if so, she overacted and ruined any shred of believability with her character.The part of Moore's detective character takes us on side trips that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, the murders and the film as a whole.  Demi Morre simply becomes a waste of time and completely unnecessary.  We are subject to her divorce disposition - why?  Who cares?  We are subject to watching some whack-o that she put in jail, chase after her with his steroid-bound-blonde - why?  Who cares?  We are forced to watch Demi's entire investigative process to solve these murders boil down to asking two residents of a nearby apartment building ""if they saw anything""... Gee - some great detective work there - had me on the edge of my seat.  Take out her character and you're left with a better movie than you are with her in it.To make it all worse, if possible, they try to some how meat-grind all of Demi's side plots into the last fifteen minutes of the movie, as if by some stroke of brilliance it's all going to make sense.  It doesn't work, and you're left snickering to yourself - yeah, how coincidental can THAT that get!It was good to see Kevin try a role that was different than what you have come to expect from him, but he never pulls it off in a convincing role.  He continues to act as the lovable, tender, sweet - `give-me-a-hug-and-call-me-Daddy' character.  He never really has you believing that he is some monster that blows people away for a few seconds of orgasmic pleasure.  I give him kudos for trying, but it doesn't work as well as it could have.The only truly believable character in this movie belongs to that of William Hurt.  Great job as an evil conscious!  The problem is that we don't get to see enough of Hurt's character to save the movie.  If you want to get the most out of this movie, watch the first 30 minutes and then turn it off - your imagination will give you a better `film' than this one turned out to be.As for the Blu-Ray - hey it's a Blu-Ray... how can you go wrong!?

282153,ABBBP0HLLXJZ9,6301971345,"Rhonda Poynter ""gannon'smom""","[2, 3]","There's a great clip in a ""Family Guy"" episode where the character Chris Griffen comes out of the Costner movie, ""No Way Out"" and yowls, ""How does Kevin Costner keep getting work????"". That pretty much sums up what I have always thought about Kevin's pinball-like quality of his projects: for every ""Dances With Wolves"", which I thought in fact did deserve its' praise and awards, there's a ""Tin Cup"". His acting ability has always come across onscreen as though Kevin himself knows, if he wasn't so damned good looking, he'd be relegated to background scenes and the best friend of the movie's hero. Not here: He makes what is, really, not that great a storyline - there are far too many side plots, red herrings, coincidences to move the script forward, etc. -, and puts it up at the four star, very close to the five star rating. Had he had better material to work with, and had this movie completely concentrated on Costner's serial killer character, I'd have given it that last star in a heartbeat. He plays, as other reviews note, Man Of The Year Earl Brooks, and while he has money, respect, a loving wife and many other perks, Mr. Brooks also has...issues. He likes to murder people, and he has been trying to beat that demon down for the last couple of years, but he's unfortunate enough to have a yappy, absolutely never-let-up id that only he can see and hear that is played to brilliance by William Hurt (As a matter of fact, why didn't Hurt get more praise for this turn? There's talk of his great, evil take all over the cult chat boards which follow this movie, but Hurt definitely deserved more than cult praise for this film). He gets hold of Kevin's Earl Brooks like a dog with a bone and just never lets up - Mr. Brooks thinks his main problems are being blackmailed and a daughter who may have possibly inherited the killing gene? Uh-uh, he's got the King of Looney Tunes in his own backseat, laughing, pouting and telling Earl to push that accelerator down through to the metal. Whether it is what I have always thought was a somewhat wooden acting ability on Kevin Costner's part finally finding the right role to showcase it - the uptight, perfect ""You have no idea what's going on inside me"" killer, or if he's a better actor than I ever gave him credit for, I have to admit, I don't know. But I do know that the entire movie could have and should have been about Earl Brooks and his crazy-as-hell alter ego, with Dane Cook as a blackmailer who has no idea what gate of Hell he's just opened (also, surprisingly good - see, I'm willing to admit when I've judged somebody incorrectly) as the one most important side plot, I'd have been more than happy with the screenplay. The detective sideline with Demi Moore is unnecessary, and even the exit ramp added regarding the pregnant daughter and her possible tendencies to follow in her dad's footsteps (or thumbprint, as it were) seems to be padding. They didn't need it with this movie - ""Mr. Brooks"" is a good/close to great movie because of Kevin Costner and William Hurt, and, since Kevin's the name that brings in the most Googling and queries about this film, you've got to be fair and give the majority of praise to him. It's his movie, he holds it together and he should do movies like this much more often.

282160,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6301971345,Roland E. Zwick,"[26, 28]","***1/2Bruce A. Evans' ""Mr. Brooks"" deserves praise for at least bringing a certain degree of freshness to the well-worn serial-killer genre.Kevin Costner portrays Earl Brooks, a devoted husband and father and the recent recipient of the Man of the Year Award from the city of Portland, Oregon for his work as a successful businessman.  He also just happens to be a cold-blooded murderer, known to the media and the law enforcement community as the Fingerprint Killer, so named because he leaves that telltale sign behind at each of his crime scenes (we must assume it is not his own fingerprint, although the script never actually spells that out for us).  As the movie opens, Brooks hasn't killed anyone for two years, having chosen to resist the temptation by attending AA meetings and focusing on his wife and daughter.  However, lately, Brooks has begun to succumb to the pull of his ""addiction,"" once again allowing his darker angel to lure and goad him into seeking out unsuspecting victims as a means of alleviating the pressure.What separates ""Mr. Brooks"" from all other previous serial-killer thrillers is that it has chosen to actually incarnate that bad angel on screen in the form of an unnerving William Hurt, who appears by Brooks' side at strategic moments in the movie to advise, berate and commiserate with Brooks as he contemplates his next homicidal action.  Generally, in these movies, we rarely get a sense of the intense mental struggle taking place within the deeply disturbed, psychotic mind of the killer.  Through the use of Hurt's character (referred to by Brooks as Marshall), however, the writers, Evans and Raynold Gideon, are able to verbalize that conflict and show us the two warring factions co-existing within this single warped psyche.  Despite the absurdity of it, Brooks truly believes that his ""condition"" can be ""cured"" if he regularly and faithfully attends a self-help group for alcoholics.  Thus, against our better judgment, perhaps, we find ourselves almost feeling sorry for the man, a position one rarely finds oneself in in a tale such as this one.The complex plot also includes a wannabe young killer (Dane Cook) who blackmails Brooks into taking him out on his next killing spree; an expert homicide investigator (Demi Moore) who was investigating the Fingerprint Killer case until the trail turned cold; and Brooks' own college-aged daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker), who may have inherited her dad's killer ""gene"" and might just possibly have a murder or two of her own to account for.The storyline may not always pass the credibility threshold (particularly in the suggestion that psychosis might have a genetic component and can be passed down from generation to generation), but the cleverness of the approach and the genuine creepiness of many of the scenes go a long way towards mitigating the imperfections.  Moreover, Costner, Hurt, Moore and Cook give spellbinding performances as the killer and the various persons and pseudo-persons caught in the bloody web he has woven.Working as a team, Costner and Hurt bring complementary opposing qualities to their roles which, when taken together, add up to a single, well-rounded character.  In a complex variation on the Jekyll and Hyde, Faust and Mephistopheles dichotomy, Costner conveys the poignancy and vulnerability of the ""good"" Brooks, while Hurt shows us the steely-eyed cold-heartedness of the ""bad"" Brooks.  Yet, there are times when even those roles switch, as when Costner coldly laughs at the prospect of a victim's potential suffering and Hurt provides words of comfort to a hurting Costner.Together, the two talented stars create a complex symbiotic relationship that lifts ""Mr. Brooks"" several rungs above the ordinary.",3,nice spin on the serial killer formula,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,3743,"['***1/2Bruce', 'A.', 'Evans', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'praise', 'least', 'bringing', 'certain', 'degree', 'freshness', 'well-worn', 'serial-killer', 'genre.Kevin', 'Costner', 'Earl', 'Brooks', 'devoted', 'husband', 'father', 'recent', 'recipient', 'Man', 'Year', 'Award', 'city', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'work', 'successful', 'businessman', 'also', 'just', 'be', 'cold-blooded', 'murderer', 'known', 'media', 'law', 'enforcement', 'community', 'Fingerprint', 'Killer', 'so', 'named', 'telltale', 'sign', 'crime', 'scenes', 'must', 'assume', 'not', 'own', 'fingerprint', 'script', 'never', 'actually', 'out', 'movie', 'Brooks', ""n't"", 'killed', 'anyone', 'two', 'years', 'having', 'chosen', 'resist', 'temptation', 'attending', 'AA', 'meetings', 'focusing', 'wife', 'daughter', 'However', 'lately', 'Brooks', 'begun', 'succumb', 'pull', 'addiction', 'once', 'again', 'allowing', 'darker', 'angel', 'lure', 'goad', 'seeking', 'out', 'unsuspecting', 'victims', 'means', 'alleviating', 'pressure.What', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'other', 'previous', 'serial-killer', 'thrillers', 'chosen', 'actually', 'incarnate', 'bad', 'angel', 'screen', 'form', 'unnerving', 'William', 'Hurt', 'who', 'Brooks', 'side', 'strategic', 'moments', 'movie', 'advise', 'berate', 'commiserate', 'Brooks', 'next', 'homicidal', 'action', 'Generally', 'movies', 'rarely', 'get', 'sense', 'intense', 'mental', 'struggle', 'taking', 'place', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'psychotic', 'mind', 'killer', 'use', 'Hurt', 'character', 'referred', 'Brooks', 'Marshall', 'however', 'writers', 'Evans', 'Raynold', 'Gideon', 'are', 'able', 'verbalize', 'conflict', 'show', 'two', 'warring', 'factions', 'co-existing', 'single', 'warped', 'psyche', 'absurdity', 'Brooks', 'truly', 'condition', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'regularly', 'faithfully', 'self-help', 'group', 'alcoholics', 'Thus', 'better', 'judgment', 'perhaps', 'find', 'almost', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'man', 'position', 'one', 'rarely', 'tale', 'such', 'one.The', 'complex', 'plot', 'also', 'wannabe', 'young', 'killer', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'who', 'Brooks', 'taking', 'out', 'next', 'killing', 'spree', 'expert', 'homicide', 'investigator', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'who', 'was', 'investigating', 'Fingerprint', 'Killer', 'case', 'trail', 'turned', 'cold', 'Brooks', 'own', 'college-aged', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'inherited', 'dad', 'killer', 'gene', 'might', 'just', 'possibly', 'have', 'murder', 'two', 'own', 'account', 'for.The', 'storyline', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'pass', 'credibility', 'threshold', 'particularly', 'suggestion', 'psychosis', 'might', 'have', 'genetic', 'component', 'can', 'be', 'passed', 'generation', 'generation', 'cleverness', 'approach', 'genuine', 'creepiness', 'many', 'scenes', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'mitigating', 'imperfections', 'Moreover', 'Costner', 'Hurt', 'Moore', 'Cook', 'give', 'spellbinding', 'performances', 'killer', 'various', 'persons', 'pseudo-persons', 'caught', 'bloody', 'web', 'woven.Working', 'team', 'Costner', 'Hurt', 'bring', 'complementary', 'opposing', 'qualities', 'roles', 'when', 'taken', 'together', 'add', 'up', 'single', 'well-rounded', 'character', 'complex', 'variation', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'Faust', 'Mephistopheles', 'dichotomy', 'Costner', 'poignancy', 'vulnerability', 'good', 'Brooks', 'Hurt', 'steely-eyed', 'cold-heartedness', 'bad', 'Brooks', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'even', 'roles', 'switch', 'when', 'Costner', 'coldly', 'prospect', 'victim', 'potential', 'suffering', 'Hurt', 'words', 'comfort', 'hurting', 'Costner.Together', 'two', 'talented', 'stars', 'create', 'complex', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'several', 'rungs', 'ordinary']",Mr. Brooks

Mr. Brooks, although prominent and successful, is otherwise an ordinary Joe.  Maybe a little too ordinary.  He is efficient, loves his family and is a mild-mannered, low keyed guy.  Unfortunately, he has an alterego in the form of a man, more forward and assertive than Brooks, constantly giving him dangerous advice.His advice is to give into his impulses, track down people and kill them in cold-blood.  Brooks does it, too, swearing each will be his last.  He doesn't enjoy it, he tells his alterego, but justifies it as an addiction.  Unfortunately, he is identified at the scene of one of his kills by a young voyeur.  This man, quite unexpectedly, blackmails Brooks into taking him along on a thrill-kill.  Brooks toys with the blackmailer, taking him along to scope things out and track people.  The younger man is frustrated.  He wants it now!Brooks, by now, fearing the humiliation of discovery is considering the possibility of suicide...maybe the young guy will help him out.As I said, it's a good movie but it's not fast paced.  Also, as an exposition of serial homicide it is not characteristic.  Almost all of these guys are serial sexual psychopaths.  They sexually abuse and torture their victims before they murder them.  Brooks doesn't.  I think this is cinematically explainable.

It's a very good psychological thriller with some superb acting.As an alter-ego or imaginary ""friend,"" William Hurt beams his counsel, like dangerous moonlight, over the shoulder, into the ear of Kevin Costner. He is the undermining Iago of this drama. But at the same time, his whispered warnings are amazingly astute, always right on target. Except for the fact that he often urges giving vent to homicidal impulses, that he plies Costner with justifications and permissions to proceed into psychopathology - he might be the ideal imaginary playmate carried over into adulthood. He would be the sort of conjured companion we'd all like to have.Danielle Panabaker is similarly brilliant as Costner's daughter. The exchanges of subtle, knowing looks between Costner and Hurt, between Costner and his daughter, make for chilling preludes, almost more frightening than the actual murders. This movie might in fact be all prelude, because in the DVD commentary, it's mentioned that some of the actors were specifically chosen based on their likely availability for a sequel.As absorbing as this movie is though, it does suffer from some serious lapses in logic. For one thing, it is strongly suggested that Costner comes by his nearly uncontrollable urge to commit murder - as a result of genetics. Well, that sort of theory of specific inheritance went out a long time ago. A number of otherwise good movies made in the 30s now look laughable and dated because their tragic drama revolved around the tendency to inherit ""madness."" Leading ladies were consigned to spinsterhood more than once because there was insanity in their families. Most doctors would now dismiss such determinism as an absurdity. However the producer and director of this movie still maintain this kind of inheritance as a definite possibility.Then it doesn't seem likely that a serial killer could, in reality, lead such a compartmentalized life - a sincerely loving soccer-Dad by day - an orgiastic killer by night. It's true that many serial killers might appear to the outside world to be normal, devoted husbands and fathers. But somehow, their wives must almost always suspect, their wives who are privy to the sorts of pornography their husbands revel in, the sorts of midnight indulgences they solicit. Mr. Brooks so successfully becomes another person in his workaday life though, that his wife, well-played by Marg Helgenberger, could have no inkling. I don't think so.But who knows? For all the CSI serial killers that we've been awash in over recent years, there are still precious few episodes that truly illuminate the motives of a serial killer, that truly put us in the mind, in the shoes of a serial killer. Mr. Brooks takes a good stab at doing just that - eerily, evilly, imaginatively.",4,"The Dark Side of  ""Our Miss Brooks""",1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,2850,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'splash', 'theaters', 'very', 'good', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'superb', 'acting.As', 'alter-ego', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'William', 'Hurt', 'beams', 'counsel', 'dangerous', 'moonlight', 'shoulder', 'ear', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'undermining', 'Iago', 'drama', 'same', 'time', 'whispered', 'warnings', 'are', 'amazingly', 'astute', 'always', 'right', 'target', 'fact', 'often', 'giving', 'vent', 'homicidal', 'impulses', 'Costner', 'justifications', 'permissions', 'proceed', 'psychopathology', 'might', 'be', 'ideal', 'imaginary', 'playmate', 'carried', 'adulthood', 'would', 'be', 'sort', 'conjured', 'companion', ""'d"", 'have.Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'similarly', 'brilliant', 'Costner', 'daughter', 'exchanges', 'subtle', 'knowing', 'looks', 'Costner', 'Hurt', 'Costner', 'daughter', 'make', 'chilling', 'preludes', 'almost', 'more', 'frightening', 'actual', 'murders', 'movie', 'might', 'fact', 'be', 'prelude', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'mentioned', 'actors', 'were', 'specifically', 'chosen', 'based', 'likely', 'availability', 'sequel.As', 'absorbing', 'movie', 'suffer', 'serious', 'lapses', 'logic', 'one', 'thing', 'strongly', 'suggested', 'Costner', 'nearly', 'uncontrollable', 'urge', 'commit', 'murder', 'result', 'genetics', 'Well', 'sort', 'theory', 'specific', 'inheritance', 'went', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'number', 'otherwise', 'good', 'movies', 'made', '30s', 'now', 'look', 'laughable', 'dated', 'tragic', 'drama', 'revolved', 'tendency', 'inherit', 'madness', 'Leading', 'ladies', 'were', 'consigned', 'spinsterhood', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'insanity', 'families', 'Most', 'doctors', 'would', 'now', 'dismiss', 'such', 'determinism', 'absurdity', 'However', 'producer', 'director', 'movie', 'still', 'maintain', 'kind', 'inheritance', 'definite', 'possibility.Then', ""n't"", 'seem', 'likely', 'serial', 'killer', 'could', 'reality', 'lead', 'compartmentalized', 'life', 'sincerely', 'loving', 'soccer-Dad', 'day', 'orgiastic', 'killer', 'night', 'true', 'many', 'serial', 'killers', 'might', 'appear', 'outside', 'world', 'be', 'normal', 'devoted', 'husbands', 'fathers', 'somehow', 'wives', 'must', 'almost', 'always', 'suspect', 'wives', 'who', 'are', 'privy', 'sorts', 'pornography', 'husbands', 'revel', 'sorts', 'midnight', 'indulgences', 'solicit', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'so', 'successfully', 'person', 'workaday', 'life', 'wife', 'well-played', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'could', 'have', 'inkling', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.But', 'who', 'CSI', 'serial', 'killers', ""'ve"", 'been', 'awash', 'recent', 'years', 'are', 'still', 'precious', 'few', 'episodes', 'truly', 'illuminate', 'motives', 'serial', 'killer', 'truly', 'put', 'mind', 'shoes', 'serial', 'killer', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'good', 'stab', 'doing', 'just', 'eerily', 'evilly', 'imaginatively']",Mr. Brooks

It begins sinister and ends creepy, with the ride between vacillating from dull to melodramatic.  The high point of this flick is the story, not the acting.  Costner played the straightman half of his serial killer persona with the same flat, deadpan delivery he's played every character he's played in the last decade.  It works to a degree, as he is after all the passionless half of his persona.  He hits his stride in the scenes where he loses his cool.  Hurt, however, is very compelling in his role as the half of Brooks' that is the inner crazed killer.  He's got some great lines.  I do think that with both playing different sides of the same character, often in tandem, that brings a new challenge to being in the same scenes.  They had great timing and were the only actors who seemed to have chemistry in the film.  Mrs. Brooks may as well have been a prop, for all of her function surrounded validating the normality of Mr. Brooks.  His daughter's secrets brought the story to life, and in many ways her character was the real foil to Mr. Brooks and not the inner persona played by Hurt.  Moore overacted most of her role and just generally did not bring her to life at all.  That was a disappointment.  The story is incredibly sinister, which did not leave its visual needing much in the way of graphic gore.  However, the final hardcore scene of the film is definitely gratuitous shock, so much so that it detracted rather enhanced Mr. Brooks' fears of the future.

But unfortunately what Mr. Brooks is addicted to isn't killing *him*...it's killing unsuspecting, innocent people.Kevin Costner is fabulous as Mr. Brooks. In Costner's last movie (The Guardian) he was an instructor (reluctantly) at The Coast Guard Academy (teaching Ashton Kutcher); in Mr. Brooks he is being hunted by Kutcher's beau Demy Moore, and Costner has again been (reluctantly) put into an 'instructional' role.Instead of the traditional Hollywood approach of following the cops hunt for the serial killer, you're mainly with Mr. Brooks during his daily routines.Writer/Producer Bruce Evans takes the directorial reins for only his second time in 15 years, and the job that he did with Mr. Brooks just goes to show that you don't need a popular, long-time director to get a great movie.In Mr. Brooks there are terrific thrills. Excellent twists. And there's plenty of action. Some of the situations require a stretch of the imagination, but the acting by a great A-list company and the fast-paced story flow keep viewers from spending too much time deciding whether it's 100% believable or not.Mr. Brooks is one of the better, more entertaining movies that I've watched in 2007.

He here plays a driven serial murderer, nicknamed the Fingerprint Killer, in Portland, Oregon, where he lives: the movie opens on an awards dinner, during which he is named the town's man of the year.The movie's plot is gratifyingly complex, with several of what seem to me to be new ingredients.  We soon learn that Earl Brooks (Costner), has been trying to keep his murderous impulses at bay, and has succeeded in so doing for two years, by going to Alcoholics Anonymous.  But his dark side -- the film takes the interesting step of having its protaganist's dark side personified, rather like the famous Robert Louis Stevenson novel, ""Jekyll and Hyde;"" as played by William Hurt, who does a good job of playing menacing himself, will not be denied.  Both are supported by an able cast: Marg Helgenberger as Emma Brooks, the murderer's wife, who doesn't seem to have a clue.  Danielle Panabaker, as Jane, the murderer's daughter, who may have inherited some real bad genes.  Demi Moore as Detective Tracy Attwood, who knows there's something going on; Lindsay Crouse as her supervisor, Captain Lister.  Dane Cook turns in a multi-layered performance as ""Mr. Smith,"" who doesn't know when he's not wanted.

282177,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,6301971345,Steven Hancock,"[2, 2]","With all of these different versions of slasher and serial killer films out there today, ""Mr. Brooks"" is an overall breath of fresh air. Rather than focusing on the victims of the killer, the film focuses on the killer himself. This gives Kevin Costner, an underrated actor in Hollywood, a chance to play a character that is different from any he has played before, and does so surprisingly well. While the crimes he commits are truly horrible and unforgivable, Costner's performance allows us to empathize a little bit with the character. At the same time, there are scenes where he really creeps the audience out. While his performance isn't perfect, it is overall powerful and chilling.The supporting cast for the film is also worthwhile. Dane Cook's Mr. Smith is great, while Demi Moore turns in a surprisingly good performance as Detective Atwood, who is hell-bent on bringing Brooks, who is known only as the ""Thumbprint Killer"" by the cops, to justice, while also struggling with personal problems, and another killer bent on destroying her. Marg Helgenberger and Danielle Panabaker are good as well. But the real treat among the supporting performances is William Hurt as Marshall, Brooks' alter ego. He is at once chilling, but frighteningly likable at the same time.The script itself, which focuses on the power of addiction, is a bit of a let-down in some places. There are some slow passages that drain the tension at times, and there are some truly unbelievable moments as well. But the fantastic performances, coupled by some truly shocking and surprising moments, make up for these slower passages. Overall, ""Mr. Brooks"" is a fascinating look at one man's addiction to murder, and how he tries to hide it from his loved ones while fighting the urges. Even if you don't typically watch this kind of film, it is still worthwhile to check it out.Movie/DVD Grade: B+",4,AN INTERESTING TAKE ON THE SERIAL KILLER FILM.,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,1877,"['different', 'versions', 'slasher', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'today', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'overall', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Rather', 'focusing', 'victims', 'killer', 'film', 'killer', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'chance', 'play', 'character', 'different', 'played', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'crimes', 'are', 'truly', 'horrible', 'unforgivable', 'Costner', 'performance', 'empathize', 'little', 'bit', 'character', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'really', 'audience', 'out', 'performance', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'overall', 'powerful', 'chilling.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'also', 'worthwhile', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'great', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'Detective', 'Atwood', 'who', 'hell-bent', 'bringing', 'Brooks', 'who', 'known', 'only', 'Thumbprint', 'Killer', 'cops', 'justice', 'also', 'struggling', 'personal', 'problems', 'killer', 'bent', 'destroying', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'real', 'treat', 'supporting', 'performances', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Marshall', 'Brooks', 'alter', 'ego', 'once', 'chilling', 'frighteningly', 'likable', 'same', 'time.The', 'script', 'power', 'addiction', 'bit', 'let-down', 'places', 'are', 'slow', 'passages', 'drain', 'tension', 'times', 'are', 'truly', 'unbelievable', 'moments', 'well', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'coupled', 'truly', 'shocking', 'surprising', 'moments', 'make', 'up', 'slower', 'passages', 'Overall', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'fascinating', 'look', 'one', 'man', 'addiction', 'murder', 'how', 'hide', 'loved', 'ones', 'fighting', 'urges', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'typically', 'watch', 'kind', 'film', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'check', 'out.Movie/DVD', 'Grade', 'B+']",Mr. Brooks

Unbelievably, he is turned on to murder after seeing Costner's Mr. Brooks do away with his neighbors and wants him to take him under his wing or he will go to the police with his proof that puts Brooks at the scene of his last murder.  Mr. Brooks decides to string this guy along until he is no longer useful and that is where some really decent plot twists take place.  One significant plot twist is that Mr. Brooks' daughter, well played by Daniella Panabacker, is accused of murder back at her college dorm.  Is she innocent or just like her father?Mr. Brooks is a compelling film that has a few distracting and significant problems.  This film is both graphic in its violence and sexual scenes, but neither seems really gratuitous.  That's a plus for me.  In addition, Costner's brilliant performance is absolutely captivating, especially to his long-term followers who have never seen him in a role like this one.  He has definitely grown as an actor and this is one juicy role for him.  The performances by all others in this film, including Demi Moore's are good, if nothing special.  The problems come from some unbelievable elements within the plot and one actor who is a great distraction, William Hurt.Plot Problems:(1) What are the odds that a neighbor who witnesses a murder would get so turned on by it that he would contact the killer to seek ""training""?  That is just too far-fetched even for me.(2) Why does Demi Moore's character of a cop have to also be a millionaire, be going through a divorce, and have a convicted killer be after her?  It is all just too much for this story.  The film comes close to sinking under its own unnecessarily heavy plot weight.(3) The film comes off as being too contrived like many of Alfred Hitchcock's films had been.  All enjoyable, but you feel very manipulated afterwards.Acting Problems:(1) Dane Cook as the guy blackmailing Mr. Brooks to teach him murder is never quite convincing in the role, but perhaps that is because his role, as a whole, is just too far beyond belief to take seriously anyhow.  To his credit he does play ""slimy"" pretty well.(2) I swear to God that if I never see William Hurt in this kind of role again, I'd die a happy man.  He's done this bad guy with no conscience thing to death in his older years that he now comes off as a parody of himself.  He is a distraction in what should have been a key and captivating role as Mr. Brooks' alter ego convincing him to keep on killing (no one sees or hears him but Mr. Brooks).  An unknown actor might have been a better choice for this role.Well, in spite of its serious flaws, this was still a riveting thriller and well worth your viewing.  In a year of so-so films and no big standout performances, Kevin Costner's work here is Oscar nomination worthy (and about time too).",4,"An odd, disturbing and unrealistic film, but compelling nevertheless.",1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,3463,"['Thanks', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'psycho-killer', 'film', 'worth', 'watching.We', 'are', 'very', 'familiar', 'Costner', 'gosh', 'gee-whiz', 'persona', 'early', 'career', 'withField', 'DreamsandSilveradoand', 'later', 'playing', 'villain', 'inA', 'Perfect', 'World', 'very', 'flawed', 'unfriendly', 'hero', 'was', 'inWaterworld', 'have', 'never', 'quite', 'seen', 'complex', 'psychopathic', 'villain', 'Mr', 'Brooks', 'Here', 'Costner', 'stab', 'pun', 'intended', 'serial', 'killer', 'trying', 'stop', 'murderous', 'addiction', 'up', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'witness', 'oddly', 'played', 'comedian', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'last', 'murder', 'Unbelievably', 'turned', 'murder', 'seeing', 'Costner', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'do', 'away', 'neighbors', 'take', 'wing', 'will', 'go', 'police', 'proof', 'Brooks', 'scene', 'last', 'murder', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'string', 'guy', 'along', 'no', 'longer', 'useful', 'where', 'really', 'decent', 'plot', 'twists', 'take', 'place', 'One', 'significant', 'plot', 'twist', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'daughter', 'well', 'played', 'Daniella', 'Panabacker', 'accused', 'murder', 'back', 'college', 'dorm', 'innocent', 'just', 'father', 'Mr', 'Brooks', 'compelling', 'film', 'few', 'distracting', 'significant', 'problems', 'film', 'graphic', 'violence', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'neither', 'really', 'gratuitous', 'plus', 'addition', 'Costner', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'captivating', 'especially', 'long-term', 'followers', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'role', 'one', 'definitely', 'grown', 'actor', 'one', 'juicy', 'role', 'performances', 'others', 'film', 'including', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'are', 'good', 'nothing', 'special', 'problems', 'come', 'unbelievable', 'elements', 'plot', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'great', 'distraction', 'William', 'Hurt.Plot', 'Problems', '1', 'What', 'are', 'odds', 'neighbor', 'who', 'murder', 'would', 'get', 'so', 'turned', 'would', 'contact', 'killer', 'seek', 'training', 'just', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'even', '2', 'Why', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'cop', 'have', 'also', 'be', 'millionaire', 'be', 'going', 'divorce', 'have', 'convicted', 'killer', 'be', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'film', 'close', 'sinking', 'own', 'unnecessarily', 'heavy', 'plot', 'weight', '3', 'film', 'off', 'being', 'too', 'contrived', 'many', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'had', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'feel', 'very', 'manipulated', 'afterwards.Acting', 'Problems', '1', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'guy', 'blackmailing', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'teach', 'murder', 'never', 'quite', 'convincing', 'role', 'perhaps', 'role', 'whole', 'just', 'too', 'far', 'belief', 'take', 'seriously', 'anyhow', 'credit', 'play', 'slimy', 'pretty', 'well', '2', 'swear', 'God', 'never', 'see', 'William', 'Hurt', 'kind', 'role', 'again', ""'d"", 'die', 'happy', 'man', 'done', 'bad', 'guy', 'conscience', 'thing', 'death', 'older', 'years', 'now', 'off', 'parody', 'distraction', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'key', 'captivating', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'alter', 'ego', 'convincing', 'keep', 'killing', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'unknown', 'actor', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'role.Well', 'spite', 'serious', 'flaws', 'was', 'still', 'riveting', 'thriller', 'well', 'viewing', 'year', 'so-so', 'films', 'big', 'standout', 'performances', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'work', 'here', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'worthy', 'time', 'too']",Mr. Brooks

282185,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,6301971345,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 3]","A brilliantly clever thriller, Mr. Brooks delivers enough shocks and revelations that you'll never know what's going to happen next. Kevin Costner is at his absolute best as the crafty Brooks, and William Hurt's supporting performance is equally magnificent. Perhaps the most innovative and unique film involving a split personality, Mr. Brooks introduces us to an antagonist we simply have to side with and one that is comparable to cinema's most fascinating villain, Hannibal Lector.Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) leads a normal life, running his box design business, admiring his lovely wife and coping with a typical troubled teenage daughter. Normal, that is, except for Marshall (William Hurt), his alternate personality, who continues to coerce him into murder. Constantly fighting his addiction, he is photographed one night committing a particularly grisly murder, by ""Mr. Smith"" (Dane Cook) who blackmails Earl into taking him along on the next murder. Meanwhile, Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is in search of the mysterious ""Thumbprint Killer"" and believes Mr. Smith is harboring some undisclosed clues. As Mr. Brooks' family life and his life of crime slowly converge, he must decide how to permanently stop his literally murderous addiction.Kevin Costner's performance is nothing short of phenomenal. He captures the screen and portrays a wickedly clever character that you simply can't take your eyes off of. Cold and ruthless as a murderer, yet also calm, collected and grotesquely artistic, he calculates every possibility and scenario to plan the perfect murders. Having a unique idiosyncrasy, the ""Thumbprint Killer"" (as dubbed by the authorities) repositions the victim's bodies into various poses after he kills them. And of course the major twist to this psychopath is his alternate personality, here played by a separate actor, also mustering up an outstanding performance. William Hurt is Marshall, Earl's darker, more malevolent alter ego who instructs and advises him, especially when it comes to murder. His role is used for comic relief at times and to demonstrate Earl's complex thinking. The most innovative aspect of this split personality concept is that Marshall truly exists only in Earl's mind. He cannot control Earl, he can't physically interfere with anything, and Earl is constantly aware of him.Much like the demon and angel that sits on either shoulder of the lead character in countless cartoons and comedies, Marshall influences Earl's decisions but is unable to physically alter anything. And yet Mr. Brooks enjoys killing enough that even without his alter ego we are lead to believe that serial killing is not beyond his reach, which conflicts with the popular Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy; both personalities instead lean toward psychotic dispositions. Marshall's personality doesn't actually progress the story, essentially making it ironically unnecessary, except for how engrossing and innovative that particularly uncommon aspect is portrayed.Demi Moore is Tracy Atwood, who has been investigating the Thumbprint Killer for years. Easily the weakest link in the film, her character takes a backseat even to Hurt's alter ego (who is most often literally in the backseat). At several points in the film she dons the armor of a serious action star, which feels sorely misplaced. Her subplot could have been cut entirely to shorten the running time of the film.I was a bit worried about Dane Cook's appearance in a serious thriller but he pulls off his role without a hitch. And the reason is once again because of a twist. A hilariously eccentric take on the blackmailer, Cook doesn't want money; rather he wants to accompany Brooks on his next murder. Obtaining a similar adrenaline rush for killing, he is a bold new form of accomplice.Director Bruce Evans throws in an ample helping of comedy elements into the violence and murders, presumably to break up the occasional incredibly graphic bloodshed. Brooks is perhaps even scarier because his family life is so normal. He has seemingly basic problems controlling his teenage daughter, and a healthy relationship with his wife.Mr. Brooks is complex and morbidly intriguing and is perhaps the most innovative twist on a serial killer movie in decades. Brooks prays for forgiveness and prays to God to cease his never-ending killing spree, but his guilty conscience continually haunts him. A Hannibal Lector of sorts, Costner's Brooks is a bad guy so ingeniously scripted that we root for him even though he is the most psychotic of all the characters introduced. Curiously, we prefer to see him get away with murder just like Hannibal, and side with him not for his obviously flawed morals, but because he's just so much fun to watch.- Mike Massie",4,Mr. Brooks

282186,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6301971345,the masked reviewer,"[3, 4]","Costner stars as Earl Brooks, founder of a prosperous Portland, Ore., box factory and all-around pillar of the community. He's an uptight, doting dad with a weird aversion to contractions and a fondness for bow ties. Our first glimpse of Earl comes when he's getting ready to receive a Man of the Year award for his extensive philanthropy work. But something seems a bit off straight away, as Costner's huddled in the bathroom chanting the Serenity Prayer while William Hurt is lurking over his shoulder, making all sorts of lurid insinuations.It turns out Earl is a bit of an addict, and though he's been going to plenty of meetings, tonight he's fired up and ready for a relapse. The only catch is instead of booze or gambling, our Mr. Brooks happens to be hooked on murder. Yes, this humble aw-shucks Oregon businessman secretly doubles as the notorious ""Thumbprint Killer""--a local legend who grooves on shooting couples midcoitus, and then arranging their corpses in erotic tableaux while twirling his arms and groaning in orgasmic fits of glee. (Seriously.) Also, Hurt isn't real. He's a black-clad manifestation of Earl's sinister subconscious, and the two actors often have lengthy discussions through mirrors and other reflective surfaces. So if you were ever wondering what might've happened if Jiminy Cricket was played by that whack job from A History of Violence, here's your answer.Earl's latest slip-up just so happens to be caught on camera by a jittery pervert amateur photographer, played here (in a stroke of casting genius) by jittery pervert amateur comedian Dane Cook. Instead of heading straight to the cops with the evidence, Cook's overenergetic shutterbug goes the blackmail route, demanding a voyeuristic ride-along during Costner's next ritual execution. We dare you to find a single line delivered by Cook that isn't riddled with some sort of manic hambone affectation, just like his alleged comedy routines. In fact, the best gag comes from Mr. Brooks pitting Cook's frenetic, exhausting mugging against Costner's laid-back socio-pathy and Hurt's wry malignancy. If anything, this movie seems designed to prove the strange, unseemly notion that even bloodthirsty serial killers are more enjoyable company than bad MySpace comedians. Or as Hurt puts it when sizing up Cook: ""Even if he was funny and charming, I still wouldn't like him.""Meanwhile, (in a so-bad-it's-good story line), police detective Tracy Atwood (a hilarious, haggard Demi Moore, Botoxed beyond recognition ) is obsessively following Earl's bloody trail while dealing with (a) the fallout of her divorce from a smarmy playboy (Jason Lewis ), (b) an escaped killer (Matt Schulze ) who wants revenge, and (c) the burden of being an independently wealthy civil servant. Any one of these would suffice for its own movie, but our Tracy's a multitasker. Indeed, Moore is so grimly purposeful that it's hard not to get the giggles. The older she gets, the more the actress reminds us of a late-period Joan Crawford : same rigid face and bulldog ferocity, same air of lunatic conviction. Whatever movie Moore's in, or thinks she's in, she's the queen bee.If all that's not enough, the youngest baby Brooks (Danielle Panabaker) has just dropped out of college after a coed was murdered with a hatchet, and Daddy's starting to wonder about what just might run in the family.Mr. Brooks goes berserk -- quite spectacularly so -- in a bizarre pigpile of clashing plotlines and camp-classic set pieces. We could lie and pretend we weren't riveted, but there's something strangely invigorating about watching a movie where you can simply throw back your arms and surrender, understanding you have no idea what the hell is going to happen next because the screenwriters are obviously on hallucinogens.",5,ABSOLUTELY OUT-OF-ITS-TREE HYSTERICAL!,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,3782,"['Costner', 'stars', 'Earl', 'Brooks', 'founder', 'prosperous', 'Portland', 'Ore.', 'box', 'factory', 'all-around', 'pillar', 'community', 'uptight', 'doting', 'dad', 'weird', 'aversion', 'contractions', 'fondness', 'bow', 'ties', 'first', 'glimpse', 'Earl', 'when', 'getting', 'ready', 'receive', 'Man', 'Year', 'award', 'extensive', 'philanthropy', 'work', 'something', 'bit', 'off', 'straight', 'away', 'Costner', 'huddled', 'bathroom', 'chanting', 'Serenity', 'Prayer', 'William', 'Hurt', 'lurking', 'shoulder', 'making', 'sorts', 'lurid', 'insinuations.It', 'out', 'Earl', 'bit', 'addict', 'been', 'going', 'plenty', 'meetings', 'tonight', 'fired', 'up', 'ready', 'relapse', 'only', 'catch', 'instead', 'booze', 'gambling', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'be', 'hooked', 'murder', 'Yes', 'humble', 'aw-shucks', 'Oregon', 'businessman', 'secretly', 'notorious', 'Thumbprint', 'Killer', 'local', 'legend', 'who', 'shooting', 'couples', 'midcoitus', 'then', 'arranging', 'corpses', 'erotic', 'tableaux', 'twirling', 'arms', 'groaning', 'orgasmic', 'fits', 'glee', 'Seriously', 'Also', 'Hurt', ""n't"", 'real', 'black-clad', 'manifestation', 'Earl', 'sinister', 'subconscious', 'two', 'actors', 'often', 'have', 'lengthy', 'discussions', 'mirrors', 'other', 'reflective', 'surfaces', 'So', 'were', 'ever', 'wondering', 'what', 'might', ""'ve"", 'happened', 'Jiminy', 'Cricket', 'was', 'played', 'whack', 'job', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'here', 'answer.Earl', 'latest', 'slip-up', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'caught', 'camera', 'jittery', 'pervert', 'amateur', 'photographer', 'played', 'here', 'stroke', 'casting', 'genius', 'jittery', 'pervert', 'amateur', 'comedian', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Instead', 'heading', 'straight', 'cops', 'evidence', 'Cook', 'overenergetic', 'shutterbug', 'blackmail', 'route', 'demanding', 'voyeuristic', 'ride-along', 'Costner', 'next', 'ritual', 'execution', 'dare', 'find', 'single', 'line', 'delivered', 'Cook', ""n't"", 'riddled', 'sort', 'manic', 'hambone', 'affectation', 'just', 'alleged', 'comedy', 'routines', 'fact', 'best', 'gag', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'pitting', 'Cook', 'frenetic', 'exhausting', 'mugging', 'Costner', 'laid-back', 'socio-pathy', 'Hurt', 'wry', 'malignancy', 'anything', 'movie', 'designed', 'prove', 'strange', 'unseemly', 'notion', 'even', 'bloodthirsty', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'company', 'bad', 'MySpace', 'comedians', 'Hurt', 'when', 'sizing', 'up', 'Cook', 'Even', 'was', 'funny', 'charming', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'Meanwhile', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'story', 'line', 'police', 'detective', 'Tracy', 'Atwood', 'hilarious', 'haggard', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Botoxed', 'recognition', 'obsessively', 'following', 'Earl', 'bloody', 'trail', 'dealing', 'fallout', 'divorce', 'smarmy', 'playboy', 'Jason', 'Lewis', 'b', 'escaped', 'killer', 'Matt', 'Schulze', 'who', 'revenge', 'c', 'burden', 'being', 'independently', 'wealthy', 'civil', 'servant', 'one', 'would', 'suffice', 'own', 'movie', 'Tracy', 'multitasker', 'Indeed', 'Moore', 'so', 'grimly', 'purposeful', 'hard', 'not', 'get', 'giggles', 'older', 'more', 'actress', 'late-period', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'same', 'rigid', 'face', 'bulldog', 'ferocity', 'same', 'air', 'lunatic', 'conviction', 'movie', 'Moore', 'queen', 'bee.If', 'not', 'enough', 'youngest', 'baby', 'Brooks', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'just', 'dropped', 'college', 'coed', 'was', 'murdered', 'hatchet', 'Daddy', 'starting', 'wonder', 'what', 'just', 'might', 'run', 'family.Mr', 'Brooks', 'berserk', 'quite', 'spectacularly', 'so', 'bizarre', 'pigpile', 'clashing', 'plotlines', 'camp-classic', 'set', 'pieces', 'could', 'lie', 'pretend', 'were', ""n't"", 'riveted', 'something', 'strangely', 'invigorating', 'watching', 'movie', 'where', 'can', 'simply', 'throw', 'back', 'arms', 'surrender', 'understanding', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'screenwriters', 'are', 'obviously', 'hallucinogens']",Mr. Brooks

His adoring wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger, TV's ""CSI"") looks on as he receives his award for running a successful box manufacturing company. But Mr. Brooks has a secret; he likes to kill people and his alter ego, Marshall (William Hurt) will not let him escape this addiction, goading him to kill again and again. He tells his wife he is going out to the pottery studio to glaze some pots when in fact, he is staking out and figuring out how to kill his next victim. When the alter ego convinces him to kill again, independently wealthy detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) realizes the Thumbprint Killer has returned. But Mr. Brooks desperately wants to lead a normal life, which means he has to struggle to stop the killing, and `Mr. Smith' (Dane Cook) might just be the answer; he has pictures of Mr. Brooks killing the last couple, a pair of lovers he was spying on anyway, and confronts the businessman/ killer. He doesn't want money; he wants to be shown how to kill, for the thrill of it. As Mr. Brooks is trying to escape this addiction, this isn't necessarily good news. As all of this happens, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker) returns home from college, dropping out because she is pregnant. But that isn't all she is hiding.""Mr. Brooks"" is better than you might think. It is a good movie, telling an involving, complicated story, with a lot of plot twists. Most of these twists resolve nicely in the end. Yes, there are a couple that don't connect, and this mars the film. But the film also deserves credit for its tongue-in-cheek narrative; ""Brooks"" takes some `narrative license' and seems to challenge you to laugh at it. The good outweighs the bad, but just barely.Costner goes dark with his role as Mr. Brooks. It is always a little interesting to see a movie star play against his established persona and here Costner takes on the seldom seen dark side of a character. As Mr. Brooks, he is a successful businessman, very successful judging from the look of his corporate headquarters, they look like they were designed by Frank Gehry. But he has this little addiction he has to deal with. To help with it, he attends AA meetings and verbally spars with Marshall, his alter ego.We get the idea that Mr. Brooks is a very careful killer. He thinks out every detail, which is how he has eluded the police for so many years. When he returns from a murder, there is a plastic sheet laid out at the precise spot he will step out of his car. He immediately removes his shoes and clothes and takes the clothing to the pottery kiln (an elaborate machine that looks more like a crematorium) and disposes of them. He is such a careful killer that he has even taken up the hobby which he uses as a cover.But he also wants a normal life, and starts to feel resentful that he doesn't have this. So he starts to get sloppy, perhaps in an effort to convince Marshall he should stop or they might get caught. He forgets to pull the curtains of his last kill, which leads to Mr. Smith's pictures and a wrinkle to his plan.When Mr. Brooks completes the kill, he shakes a bit with near orgasmic pleasure. This is where I began to have a problem with Costner's performance. This is a hammy role, but there is a fine line between acceptable hammy and just plain hammy. Mr. Brooks already has an alter ego, whom we see and he talks to. They chat, laugh together and exchange ideas and barbs. This is hammy enough, but it works. I get the idea they are trying to put across with Brooks' orgasmic shaking. But it just seems silly. It isn't enough that he has this little shake. He has it again after he strips his body and stands naked in front of his kiln. If a film is going to play fast and loose with the characters, there is a limit and this moment goes beyond that.At one point, Mr. Brooks tells his wife ""I'm going to try out some glazes on a pot. I have this Chinese glaze I'm trying to get just right"" and she accepts this and goes to bed. Of course, Brooks is using this as an excuse, to get out of the house and satisfy his addiction. This line of dialogue would probably make most people laugh, but all of the characters deliver and react to these types of lines with such seriousness that they seem perfectly natural.William Hurt plays Marshall, Brooks's alter ego. Appearing when the businessman needs confirmation, or as a sounding board for his problems, he goads Mr. Brooks into feeding his hunger. But like any true psychotic, he also has a mind of his own and pushes Brooks to do things against his will. This is a superb showcase for Hurt. Much like his brief role in David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"", Marshall is a memorable, off the wall performance that will be one of the most memorable things about ""Mr. Brooks"". At one point, as Marshall and Brooks are talking, they turn to each other and start laughing hysterically.Demi Moore plays a detective who has been tracking the Thumbprint Killer for years. Just as he reappears, and it looks like the investigation will continue, her impending divorce from her younger, philandering restaurateur husband threatens to sideline her. He is trying to extract every penny he can from her, and his lawyer seems to be holding out for $5 million dollars. As this storyline continued to cut a swath through the film, I was getting ready to turn to my companion and ask ""Where in the hell does a police detective have enough money to pay her spouse $1.5 million dollars in a divorce?"" Then the film establishes how and why this is possible. Yes, they tie it in, but it also seems like an unnecessary distraction.  Then there is also the problem of another killer she helped put away. See, that killer has just escaped and could be out trying to find and kill her. This distraction plays better and ties into the rest of the story more completely.As Moore's character investigates, and deals with her divorce, we realize she is a very complex character, and I'm sure this attracted her to the role. She does a good job, but she doesn't seem to be a very good detective. And there are just too many things going on with her character.My biggest problem with ""Mr. Brooks"" lies with his daughter. Jane returns home from school, ready to quit after only a few months. As she makes her case to her parents, Marshall turns to Brooks and says, ""She's hiding something"". She's actually hiding two things and to talk about either would reveal too much about the plot. I won't do that. But this is another case where this storyline is not tied in as well to the rest. Because of this, this character just doesn't work and brings down the rest of the film.Dane Cook is surprisingly good as Mr. Smith, the smarmy voyeur who stumbles onto Mr. Brooks and realizes he may have a way to finally realize the ultimate thrill. As he explains his proposal to Brooks, he is extremely confident, but as they go about the `training', he becomes more nervous and nervous. Then, when he participates for the first time, he is thrilled and quickly becomes addicted.Perhaps the best thing about ""Mr. Brooks"" is the fact that even with all of these story lines; most are tied into the main story very nicely, providing a tight, amusing, mostly satisfying ending. The writer and director have done a nice job of making almost all of these story lines connect. Too bad they didn't exactly tie up everything, and make the `daughter' storyline more believable.

282189,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,6301971345,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[1, 2]","I'm one of those people that didn't mind seeing Kevin Costner fall from grace in the post Dances With Wolves orgy of pee-drinking fish men and roles stolen from Kurt Russell. But part of me was always hoping that he'd climb back on that horse. This is similar to the 1980s Steve Martin.What I like about this movie is that the director manages to use Kevin Costner's main weakness to his advantage. Kevin Costner has been compared to Jimmy Stewart since his first role. However, that Jimmy Stewart persona conveyed a certain amount of arrogance as time wore on. He was still doing the ""Gee Shucks Ma'am"" routine but you didn't buy it. So having Kevin Costner playing a very well hidden serial killer is genius. That's the bit that's been off all this time. He's really evil.And even better is Dane Cook's role. He's one of those divisive comedians in that for every one person that loves him, there are about 3 that want to punch him in the mouth. As the serial killer tag-along (the one that witnesses the murders but gets off on them) he's the perfect foil as the funny guy that you just want to hurt badly. And oh does he ever get hurt.Oh and William Hurt as Kevin Costner's Mr. Snuffalupagus - awesome in so many ways. William Hurt is usually pretty bland for me, but what better companion to Kevin Costner than a slightly bland but ultimately malevolent character?Beyond that, it's a fairly taut thriller with enough surprises to keep you going. There are many silly moments such as Demi Moore's multi-millionaire police woman and the weird subplot about Costner's daughter but you pretty much expect silly moments when you have a serial killer movie.  Oh and the plot tries to incorporate all these elements and a few other serial killers that Demi Moore has to chase down (as well as an ex-husband that wants her money) and it all comes together at the end - more or less. It's still an enjoyable ride.",5,Surprisingly effective,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,1909,"[""'m"", 'one', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'fall', 'grace', 'post', 'Wolves', 'orgy', 'pee-drinking', 'fish', 'men', 'roles', 'stolen', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'part', 'was', 'always', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'climb', 'back', 'horse', 'similar', '1980s', 'Steve', 'Martin.What', 'like', 'movie', 'director', 'use', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'main', 'weakness', 'advantage', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'been', 'compared', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'first', 'role', 'However', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'conveyed', 'certain', 'amount', 'arrogance', 'time', 'wore', 'was', 'still', 'doing', 'Gee', 'Shucks', ""Ma'am"", 'routine', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'So', 'having', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'playing', 'very', 'well', 'hidden', 'serial', 'killer', 'genius', 'bit', 'been', 'off', 'time', 'really', 'evil.And', 'even', 'better', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'role', 'one', 'divisive', 'comedians', 'one', 'person', 'are', '3', 'want', 'punch', 'mouth', 'serial', 'killer', 'tag-along', 'one', 'murders', 'off', 'perfect', 'foil', 'funny', 'guy', 'just', 'want', 'hurt', 'badly', 'oh', 'ever', 'get', 'hurt.Oh', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Mr.', 'Snuffalupagus', 'awesome', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'William', 'Hurt', 'usually', 'pretty', 'bland', 'what', 'better', 'companion', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'slightly', 'bland', 'ultimately', 'malevolent', 'character', 'Beyond', 'fairly', 'taut', 'thriller', 'enough', 'surprises', 'keep', 'going', 'are', 'many', 'silly', 'moments', 'such', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'multi-millionaire', 'police', 'woman', 'weird', 'subplot', 'Costner', 'daughter', 'pretty', 'much', 'expect', 'silly', 'moments', 'when', 'have', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'Oh', 'plot', 'incorporate', 'elements', 'few', 'other', 'serial', 'killers', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'chase', 'down', 'as', 'well', 'ex-husband', 'money', 'together', 'end', 'more', 'less', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'ride']",Mr. Brooks

Only they don't call HIM the killer; they just refer to some of the handy work he seems to have left behind and this addiction keeps him killing. He doesn't like to do it, mind you, going to AA meetings because he is trying to keep his addiction in check. Still, an addiction is an addiction is an addiction and relapses to occur. His latest relapse, a dancer he sees and her lover, change things when something changes in his pattern.Namely, a loose end comes to visit and builds a world within his world by asking him to show off what killing is made of.And that's where things get started.When I first rented the movie, I didn't expect that much. Costner is oftentimes hit-or-miss and, frankly, I was afraid he would miss in this role. Happily I have to say I was wrong, with Costner making an excellent killer and also kicking it in a dual role. One of the many things Costner showcases in this movie is the way he can play with the mentality within a role - here Mr. Brooks has an imaginary friend we are lucky enough to see and the two of them share laughs and plans and suspicions on what is what. Honestly these are some of the best scenes in the business, making you really like Mr. Brooks and appreciate his humor. Costner does great work making Mr. Brooks a sympathetic character, too, with his murderous life balanced well by a family he sees to really love.Along the way, we pick up a counterpart to Costner, one Demi Moore, and she does some good work in this venture, too. I was equally surprised by this because I didn't expect to be able to take her seriously in any sort of way as an officer, much less an officer with a plethora of secrets. One of those things is a little bit of a distraction, mind you, one called The Hangman, but that just seems to be a little piece of a giant puzzle trying to keep the audience engaged.I'm glad the writers at least remembered that Mr. Brooks was the focal point of the tale.For people wanting some hardcore murder, this is a mainstream piece and doesn't offer up a thick helping of doom. It does have its moments and it does have its beauty, and it should still offer up something to that side of the spectrum. People who don't like graphic horror should be able to keep on keeping on with their watching, able to love Costner and able to watch some death together.I liked the movie - it had a lot to give to - and think people should check it out.",5,Invest in Things People Need - Water and Cemeteries,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,2578,"['Mr.', 'Brooks', 'Man', 'Year', 'award', 'loving', 'family', 'seemingly-mundane', 'hobbies', 'little', 'nickname', 'papers', 'use', 'calling', 'Thumbprint', 'Killer', 'Only', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'HIM', 'killer', 'just', 'refer', 'handy', 'work', 'have', 'left', 'behind', 'addiction', 'killing', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', 'mind', 'going', 'AA', 'meetings', 'trying', 'keep', 'addiction', 'check', 'Still', 'addiction', 'addiction', 'addiction', 'relapses', 'occur', 'latest', 'relapse', 'dancer', 'lover', 'change', 'things', 'when', 'something', 'changes', 'pattern.Namely', 'loose', 'end', 'visit', 'builds', 'world', 'world', 'asking', 'show', 'off', 'what', 'killing', 'made', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'started.When', 'first', 'rented', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Costner', 'oftentimes', 'hit-or-miss', 'frankly', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'miss', 'role', 'Happily', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'wrong', 'Costner', 'making', 'excellent', 'killer', 'also', 'kicking', 'dual', 'role', 'One', 'many', 'things', 'Costner', 'movie', 'way', 'can', 'play', 'mentality', 'role', 'here', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'are', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'two', 'share', 'plans', 'suspicions', 'what', 'what', 'Honestly', 'are', 'best', 'scenes', 'business', 'making', 'really', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'Costner', 'great', 'work', 'making', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'too', 'murderous', 'life', 'balanced', 'well', 'family', 'really', 'love.Along', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'counterpart', 'Costner', 'one', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'good', 'work', 'venture', 'too', 'was', 'equally', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'seriously', 'sort', 'way', 'officer', 'much', 'less', 'officer', 'plethora', 'secrets', 'One', 'things', 'little', 'bit', 'distraction', 'mind', 'one', 'called', 'Hangman', 'just', 'be', 'little', 'piece', 'giant', 'puzzle', 'trying', 'keep', 'audience', 'engaged.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'writers', 'least', 'remembered', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'was', 'focal', 'point', 'tale.For', 'people', 'wanting', 'hardcore', 'murder', 'mainstream', 'piece', ""n't"", 'offer', 'up', 'thick', 'helping', 'doom', 'have', 'moments', 'have', 'beauty', 'should', 'still', 'offer', 'up', 'something', 'side', 'spectrum', 'People', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'graphic', 'horror', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'keeping', 'watching', 'able', 'love', 'Costner', 'able', 'watch', 'death', 'together.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'give', 'think', 'people', 'should', 'check', 'out']",Mr. Brooks

282200,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6301971345,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","A well made unusual thriller ""Mr Brooks"" features Kevin Costner in the title role in a fascinating conceit--serial killing is like an addiction and like addicts Mr. Brooks believes he can reform.  Although the various subplots don't always quite gel, ""Mr. Brooks"" is still a fascinating thriller with a trio of strong performances. Costner's performance is a complete contrast to Anthony Hopkins turn as Hannibal Lecter which, along with the unusual approach to the character, gives ""Mr. Brooks"" a very refreshing take on a popular subject.LikeDexter - The First Season, ""Mr. Brooks"" takes an unusual approach to its subject that pays off in the end.  I have to give Evans and Gideon credit for such an ambitious film tweaking Costner's nice-guy personna. Even if the two parts don't fit together seamlessly, ""Mr. Brooks"" is still a terrific thriller that coasts along on the strong performances of the actors even when the film doesn' quite gel. I was a bit surprised by the negative critical reaction to the film given the strong writing and performances.SPOILERS IN THE NEXT TWO PARAGRAPHS:What's a conflicted serial killer who wants to just be ""normal"" to do when he's forced to kill again a blackmailer? Or does Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner giving a terrific performance) want to give up killing? He says he does and yet he and his alter ego Marshall (William Hurt equally marvelous)slip opening the door to a fan ""Mr. Smith"" (Dane Cook in an excellent oily, slimy performance)a wanna-be serial killer that wants to learn the tricks of the trade.The problem is that Mr. Brooks has Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore)a troubled cop that wants to put him behind bars. Complications result when his daughter returns from college with a dark secret of her own.END OF SPOILERS:Directed and co-written by Bruce Evans (""Stand By Me"", ""Starman"")and William Gideon, this psychological thriller is well worth a rental if nothing else. The DVD has some nice extras--there's a featurette ""The Birth of a Serial Killer: The Writing of Mr. Brooks"" where Evans and Gideon discuss the genesis of the project and how they really wanted to get away from the sweet and adolescent ensemble films they had written in the past.We also get ""Murder on Their Minds: Mr. Brooks, Marshall and Mr. Smith"" which allows the Costner, Hurt and Cook to discuss their characters and their approach to playing the roles.We also get a commentary track with Evans & Gideon. They make some pretty intelligent observations about the film and how it turned out. We also get deleted scenes as part of the package.although ""Mr. Brooks"" is flawed by two very different tones for its plot and subplot (the latter feels like it was lifted from a different movie), Evans and Gideon manage to bring it together to a surprisingly firm and powerful conclusion. The performances of Costner, Hurt, Cook and a scenery chewing Moore will pull in viewers.",4,"A serial killer who wants to reform but gets dragged back into action.

Now it has to be 50 or 100 or 800 million dollars.It's not enough in movies today to blow up a building.  Now it has to be the whole block, or if not the whole block the whole town.It's not enough in movies today for someone to be shot or stabbed, they have to be shot or stabbed in the most gory, graphic way possible.  And then the photos of the dead, mangled bodies have to be shown to the audience slowly and in lingering close-ups.What does all this say about the American culture?Specifically, whaty does it say that where once the United States led the world in manufacturing, exporting all kinds of products and services, today the only two things the US exports are fast food and Hollywood movies -- the more violent, the more juvenile, the more meaningless the movies the better.It's not just that Hollywood today makes gory, violent, pointless movies.  It's that they *also* assiduously avoid making movies about real people in real life situations.The fact that over the past 40 years the living standards of people in the United States have declined *dramatically* doesn't find its way into the dramas created by mainstream filmmakers.  Instead they go looking for dramas elsewhere. ... As for example, re. this movie, in the lives of serial killers.If this wasn't so pathetically idiotic it would be laughable.By contrast, back in the 1930 and 1940s, Hollywood had writers and directors who posed first-order challenges to the stauts quo.  While, ""back in the day"" the left-leaning writers and directors who saw their work come to the screen didn't advocate overthrowing the capitalist system, they were part of a broad-based movement that resulted in the enactment of major social reforms all throughout the 1930s and 40s.Presently, the political climate amongst mainstream filmmakers is either reactionary or else the work of ""soft-left liberals"" that far from promoting social change in fact *hold back* the struggles of workingclass activists to effect significant changes vis-a-vis status quo.Many of the people who made movies in the 30s and 40s -- along with the audiences who viewed their movies -- were greatly influenced by not just working class struggles but, more generally, by the growing influence of the socialist and revolutionary movements that existed in the early 20th century.  Whereas today mainstream filmmakers, insulated as they are from the felt-lives of millions of people, have virtually no contact (and certainly no great concern) for the lives lived by the people in their audience.In short, none of what comes out of today's mainstream filmmaking is in any way subversive.  Nothing challenges the status quo.  Nothing rocks the boat.  Insulated, rich and self-satisfied, today's filmmakers have no interest whatsoever in raising the consciousness of the general public.In the past 40 years, the financial domination of big business and Wall Street have coincided with a staggering growth of social inequality and a dramatic decline in the living standards of workingclass Americans.  And yet virtually nowhere in mainstream media is there even a *hint* that such a dramatic economic decline exists!Instead we get movies about serial killers; buildings exploding; billions of dollars robbed from banks; cute, ditzy employees in cute unrealistic economic situations -- and befuddled couples endlessly trying to figure out how to ""relate"" to each other; with, if all else fails, Oprah waiting in the wings to straigthen them all out.Modern days mainstream movies are in no way related to or sympathetic with the plight of working class people -- whereas back in the 20s and 30s and 40s, even amongst mainstream filmmakers, there was a sympathy toward socialist and even revolutionary ideas.  For example when Mister Smith went to Washington, even its right-wing director Frank Capra questioned, via the film, whether democracy can co-exist with political and financial inequalities.By contrast, nowhere today are there films coming out of Hollywood  that sugges that democracy and economic inequality are antithetical.Not even from the soft left in Hollywood.  In fact, ESPECIALLY by the soft left in Hollywood.Instead we get people like the people who made ""Mr. Brooks"" telling us in the DVD commentary -- and, mind you, in the most *profound* tones of voice! -- how fulfilling it was to make this movie, how much they ""put into it,"" how simply *marvelous* it was working with such *marvelous* people!And all this with their heads up their you-know-whats.",1,To What End?

After a run as the most notorious serial killer in his home town, ""Costner"" thought he had put those demons to bed...only to be reacquainted with them once again, this time with a thriving career and family.Two psychological factors really made this movie memorable to me: First, is how absolutely compelling ""Costner's"" murdering impulses are.  No matter what he tries (until the end, when his entire life is thrown into question), he can't seem to shake them.  Secondly, because of that absolute obsession, Costner's character actually becomes sympathetic.  Despite the fact that he is murdering people in cold blood, he still feel for him, knowing that in some way he wants to break free as much as we want him to.Overall, this film stuck with me awhile after viewing it, as it grapples with the age-old philosophical debate of why humans kill other humans?
