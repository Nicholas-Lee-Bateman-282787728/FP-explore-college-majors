1682479,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00GV8B17Q,Doug Park,"[1, 3]","{3.25 stars}Gritty yet inspiring, based-upon-a-true story of an angry young gangster-criminal who gets paroled, faces the hardships of being a parolee, and manages to stay out despite the temptations of going back to his old ""friends"" and lifestyle. The time-shifts between James as a delinquent at 14 and James as a convict several years later are well-synchronized even though his appearance hardly changes over the years. Violent with some fairly mild gore, it goes no further in those areas than is really necessary. JAMESY BOY is quite watchable, but it has neither the impact nor the originality that it aims for.Both the script of protagonist ""Jamesy Boy"" and Spencer Lofranco's performance as same are so-so, by-the-numbers. We simply don't get to know this character as well as we should. More on his earlier life and background might have helped. Some of the supporting cast, particularly Taissa Farmiga as James's friend, might-have-been girlfriend or even wife Sarah, and Ving Rhames as the tough old convicted murderer who encourages James to pursue the catharsis of writing --something he's always halfheartedly done--give excellent performances. I agree: We hear very little of James's poetry and musings, and more in that area might have been a plus. Yet, the whole point seems to be that, even though his writing is nothing exceptional and he doesn't have any big dreams of ""making it"" as a poet/author, the very act of writing still gives James a means of expression and purpose that saves him in the end.Probably worth seeing if you generally like crime drama with young gangster characters and prison settings.",3,"""You keep writing--It don't even matter if it's good or not""",1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,1630,"['3.25', 'stars', 'Gritty', 'yet', 'inspiring', 'based-upon-a-true', 'story', 'angry', 'young', 'gangster-criminal', 'who', 'paroled', 'hardships', 'being', 'parolee', 'stay', 'temptations', 'going', 'back', 'old', 'friends', 'lifestyle', 'time-shifts', 'James', 'delinquent', '14', 'James', 'convict', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'well-synchronized', 'even', 'appearance', 'hardly', 'years', 'Violent', 'fairly', 'mild', 'gore', 'further', 'areas', 'really', 'necessary', 'JAMESY', 'BOY', 'quite', 'watchable', 'impact', 'originality', 'script', 'protagonist', 'Jamesy', 'Boy', 'Spencer', 'Lofranco', 'performance', 'same', 'are', 'so-so', 'by-the-numbers', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'More', 'earlier', 'life', 'background', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'supporting', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Taissa', 'Farmiga', 'James', 'friend', 'might-have-been', 'girlfriend', 'even', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'tough', 'old', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'who', 'James', 'pursue', 'catharsis', 'writing', 'something', 'always', 'halfheartedly', 'done', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'agree', 'hear', 'very', 'little', 'James', 'poetry', 'musings', 'more', 'area', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'plus', 'whole', 'point', 'be', 'even', 'writing', 'nothing', 'exceptional', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'dreams', 'making', 'poet/author', 'very', 'act', 'writing', 'still', 'James', 'means', 'expression', 'purpose', 'end.Probably', 'worth', 'seeing', 'generally', 'crime', 'drama', 'young', 'gangster', 'characters', 'prison', 'settings']",N/A

This is done rather plainly, i.e. they didn't try to tie lessons learned in the street to doing things in prison. James is a troubled youth with an ankle bracelet. He starts a life of crime, gets caught and writes poetry, of which we hear very little. He is supposedly mentored in prison by Ving Rhames, but those scenes are infrequent, and the relationship is not well established.His mom (Mary-Louise Parker) stood by him when nobody else would. Jamesy shows that while he is a criminal who deals drugs and robs people, he is basically a softy at heart. A so-so plot of a mixed up kid who did time in prison.

I think I let them down by convincing myself I never had a choice to begin with.&#34; James (Lofranco) has been in and out of correction facilities his entire life since he was 8. After his latest stunt lands him in prison he looks back over his life and his choices. He sets out to straighten out his life, but it's not as easy as he was hoping. I knew nothing about this story going in. Once again though the fact that this is a true story made me more excited about it going in. While not nearly as powerful the movie did remind me a little of American History X in the the way that a person can live his life one way without apologizing but when removed from that life he realizes the error in his ways and tries everything he can to change. There are some pretty big names in this movie but the kid that plays James is a perfect choice and really carries as well as outshines everyone else. While this is in no way a perfect movie I do recommend this and was surprised by how good it was. Overall, a lighter version of American History X that I recommend. The fact that this was a true story helped as well. I give this an A-.",4,This isn't a perfect movie but I do recommend this & was surprised by how good it was.
