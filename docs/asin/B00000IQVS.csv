Although some of the dialogue is stilted (such as a &quot;prodigal son&quot; line thrown in just because), and the climax is a letdown considering the ominous narration of Dafoe, this film is expertly made and acted.

504948,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00000IQVS,A Customer,"[1, 6]","Summary:Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) is something of a 'do everything man' in a small town in New Hampshire (crossing guard, policeman, snow plower, etc.).  The problem is that he has never been able to get out of the town.  He has a daughter with a woman that lives elsewhere and is currently seeing Margie Fogg (Sissy Spacek).  His brother, Rolfe Whitehouse (Willem Dafoe) is a history professor at Boston University and his father, Glen Whitehouse (James Coburn), is abusive.  The movie focuses on a very short period in Wade's life when everything just kind of falls apart.  He is trying to get his teenage daughter to spend time with him, but she doesn't want to and he can't really get visitation rights because he gave those away in the divorce hearing.  His best friend, Jack Hewitt (Jim True), takes a man out hunting and the man accidentally shoots himself.  Wade thinks that Jack did it.  Wade also finds out that his boss, Gordon LaRiviere (Holmes Osborne) is in cahoots with another man and together they are buying up all of the town property to develop it.  Then when his mother dies, perhaps due to neglect on the part of his father, and Wade moves in with his father, everything begins to collapse.  He loses his job, loses Margie, then loses his daughter and his sanity.  This is when Glen pushes him over the edge by hitting him over the head with a bottle of whiskey.  Wade finally retaliates and, in doing so, kills his father.  He then sets his father on fire and burns down the barn his dad in it.  We find out later that Wade, still convinced that his best friend Jack killed the wealthy hunter, kills Jack and skips town.My Comments:The story is definitely very complicated, but not necessarily hard to follow.  A lot of time is spent in vehicles, driving here and there as Wade tries to work out his life.  In watching some of the special features on the DVD, it becomes apparent that this movie is all about what abusive parenting does to children (perhaps saying something about me that I needed the special features to really bring that out for me).  I can't even imagine what it is like, though I'm sure this movie probably hits home for some people.  I didn't grow up with an abusive father so the movie didn't resonate with me.  I just kept thinking that the movie was about a bunch of messed up people, which, as it turns out, was the whole point of the movie.Overall, the acting is convincing.  James Coburn and Nick Nolte in particular, are very good.  The story usually keeps you interested, but not always.  It almost seems like it is supposed to be a murder mystery and you would think that that plot line would drive the story, but it isn't about the murder in the end, it is about Wade dealing with the abuse, which is what is really driving the erratic story.  The movie is worth seeing, but I don't know that I would highly recommend it.  Well-done, but unless you can really relate, it is probably just a sad, hard-to-understand story.",3,"OK movie, just couldn't relate.",1047686400,"03 15, 2003",2003,2978,"['Summary', 'Wade', 'Whitehouse', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'something', ""'do"", 'everything', 'man', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'crossing', 'guard', 'policeman', 'snow', 'plower', 'etc.', 'problem', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'town', 'daughter', 'woman', 'elsewhere', 'currently', 'seeing', 'Margie', 'Fogg', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'brother', 'Rolfe', 'Whitehouse', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'history', 'professor', 'Boston', 'University', 'father', 'Glen', 'Whitehouse', 'James', 'Coburn', 'abusive', 'movie', 'very', 'short', 'period', 'Wade', 'life', 'when', 'everything', 'just', 'kind', 'falls', 'apart', 'trying', 'get', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'spend', 'time', ""n't"", 'want', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'visitation', 'rights', 'gave', 'away', 'divorce', 'hearing', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Hewitt', 'Jim', 'True', 'man', 'hunting', 'man', 'accidentally', 'Wade', 'thinks', 'Jack', 'did', 'Wade', 'also', 'out', 'boss', 'Gordon', 'LaRiviere', 'Holmes', 'Osborne', 'cahoots', 'man', 'together', 'are', 'buying', 'up', 'town', 'property', 'develop', 'Then', 'when', 'mother', 'dies', 'perhaps', 'due', 'neglect', 'part', 'father', 'Wade', 'moves', 'father', 'everything', 'begins', 'collapse', 'job', 'Margie', 'then', 'daughter', 'sanity', 'when', 'Glen', 'edge', 'hitting', 'head', 'bottle', 'whiskey', 'Wade', 'finally', 'doing', 'so', 'father', 'then', 'father', 'fire', 'burns', 'down', 'barn', 'dad', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'Wade', 'still', 'convinced', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'killed', 'wealthy', 'hunter', 'Jack', 'skips', 'town.My', 'Comments', 'story', 'definitely', 'very', 'complicated', 'not', 'necessarily', 'hard', 'follow', 'lot', 'time', 'spent', 'vehicles', 'driving', 'here', 'there', 'Wade', 'tries', 'work', 'out', 'life', 'watching', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'apparent', 'movie', 'what', 'abusive', 'parenting', 'children', 'perhaps', 'saying', 'something', 'needed', 'special', 'features', 'really', 'bring', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'imagine', 'what', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'probably', 'home', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'abusive', 'father', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'just', 'kept', 'thinking', 'movie', 'was', 'bunch', 'messed', 'up', 'people', 'out', 'was', 'whole', 'point', 'movie.Overall', 'acting', 'convincing', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'particular', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'usually', 'interested', 'not', 'always', 'almost', 'supposed', 'be', 'murder', 'mystery', 'would', 'think', 'plot', 'line', 'would', 'drive', 'story', ""n't"", 'murder', 'end', 'Wade', 'dealing', 'abuse', 'what', 'really', 'driving', 'erratic', 'story', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Well-done', 'can', 'really', 'relate', 'probably', 'just', 'sad', 'hard-to-understand', 'story']",Affliction VHS

504950,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000IQVS,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","I want to start by saying that on paper, `Affliction' is one of the most impressive character studies I've ever had the privilege of reading.  The novel, written by Russell Banks (that author I keep touting as the greatest American writer of all time), is an outstanding piece of literature; a marvelous study of the slow progression of anger, pain, misery and ultimate insanity.  On paper, `Affliction' is a masterpiece; on the screen, `Affliction' is merely a good movie.It is a good movie, don't get me wrong, but this is not a great movie.The problem lies in the pacing, so honestly I guess I can heap all the blame on director Paul Schrader.  The thing about the novel is that Banks has this beautiful way of allowing his characters to stew in their own predicaments.  There are long passages that seem to just build more tension and cast more darkness over the story and the characters within it.  I think back to what Atom Egoyan did with `The Sweet Hereafter', allowing the sweeping views of the snow covered town to bring to life the `stillness' of Banks novel.  He complemented the script with his expert direction.  `Affliction' seems a little too rushed.  The script is impeccable, much like `The Sweet Hereafter', changing very little in adaptation and staying very true to what Banks originally penned.I can't help but think that this film would have been perfect had it added about thirty minutes of silence; interjecting random scenes of serene camera movement throughout the bustle of the story to establish the mood needed to elevate this film and bring it to the novel's level.The film tells the story of Wade Whitehouse, a man pushed to the edge of his very sanity thanks to the people all around him.  He lives in the same small town in which he grew up.  He works the same dead end thankless job he's worked almost all his life.  He's tormented by memories of an abusive childhood and he's struggling to win the war against his ex-wife over the affections of their daughter Jill.  A series of events (an accidental death of a well respected man and the death of Wade's mother) start a domino effect almost, causing Wade to drift rapidly into the depths of insanity.The film lacks the emotional impact the novel did, for the novel allowed us time to appreciate the mental deterioration overtaking Wade, and it gave us enough background in order to understand it.  Here, his freefall seems almost too sudden at times.Performance wise though, this is a goldmine.  I am not a fan of Nick Nolte.  I find his breed of overacting to be a hindrance to the films he inhabits.  In fact, aside from his rather surprisingly controlled performance in `Cape Fear' I have hated everything he's done.  This though, is a masterclass.  Honestly, the fact that this is Nolte floors me.  He has such deep understanding of Wade's character (maybe even more so than Schrader) and he exhibits that knowledge in every movement he makes.  He delivers such a grounded and emotionally rich performance here; I'm stunned.  James Coburn won the Oscar for his sadistic portrayal of Wade's abusive father, and while I'm not sure I'd hand him the Oscar I do believe he is marvelous here.  Sissy Spacek is not the face I pictured when reading the novel, and so casting her as Margie seemed a bit off, but she works wonders with the part.  These performances feel so small yet hit you very hard.  They work far better than the film itself.In the end I have to say that this is a very good movie, and if you have not read the novel you may even consider this a great movie.  I was expecting a little more time invested in establishing the dark serenity that comes from reading Banks' work, so I was disappointed with Schrader direction.Still, the film is a solid B, but the novel is an A+.",4,With a little more silence this movie would have been perfect...,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,3776,"['want', 'start', 'saying', 'paper', 'Affliction', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'character', 'studies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'privilege', 'reading', 'novel', 'written', 'Russell', 'Banks', 'author', 'keep', 'touting', 'greatest', 'American', 'writer', 'time', 'outstanding', 'piece', 'literature', 'marvelous', 'study', 'slow', 'progression', 'anger', 'pain', 'misery', 'ultimate', 'insanity', 'paper', 'Affliction', 'masterpiece', 'screen', 'Affliction', 'merely', 'good', 'movie.It', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'great', 'movie.The', 'problem', 'pacing', 'so', 'honestly', 'guess', 'can', 'heap', 'blame', 'director', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'thing', 'novel', 'Banks', 'beautiful', 'way', 'allowing', 'characters', 'stew', 'own', 'predicaments', 'are', 'long', 'passages', 'seem', 'just', 'build', 'more', 'tension', 'cast', 'more', 'darkness', 'story', 'characters', 'think', 'back', 'what', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'did', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'allowing', 'sweeping', 'views', 'snow', 'covered', 'town', 'bring', 'life', 'stillness', 'Banks', 'novel', 'complemented', 'script', 'expert', 'direction', 'Affliction', 'little', 'too', 'rushed', 'script', 'impeccable', 'much', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'changing', 'very', 'little', 'adaptation', 'staying', 'very', 'true', 'what', 'Banks', 'originally', 'penned.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'had', 'added', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'silence', 'interjecting', 'random', 'scenes', 'serene', 'camera', 'movement', 'bustle', 'story', 'establish', 'mood', 'needed', 'elevate', 'film', 'bring', 'novel', 'level.The', 'film', 'story', 'Wade', 'Whitehouse', 'man', 'pushed', 'edge', 'very', 'sanity', 'thanks', 'people', 'same', 'small', 'town', 'grew', 'up', 'same', 'dead', 'end', 'thankless', 'job', 'worked', 'almost', 'life', 'tormented', 'memories', 'abusive', 'childhood', 'struggling', 'win', 'war', 'ex-wife', 'affections', 'daughter', 'Jill', 'A', 'series', 'events', 'accidental', 'death', 'well', 'respected', 'man', 'death', 'Wade', 'mother', 'start', 'domino', 'effect', 'almost', 'causing', 'Wade', 'drift', 'rapidly', 'depths', 'insanity.The', 'film', 'emotional', 'impact', 'novel', 'did', 'novel', 'allowed', 'time', 'appreciate', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'overtaking', 'Wade', 'gave', 'enough', 'background', 'order', 'understand', 'Here', 'freefall', 'almost', 'too', 'sudden', 'times.Performance', 'wise', 'goldmine', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'find', 'breed', 'overacting', 'be', 'hindrance', 'films', 'fact', 'aside', 'rather', 'surprisingly', 'controlled', 'performance', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'have', 'hated', 'everything', 'done', 'masterclass', 'Honestly', 'fact', 'Nolte', 'floors', 'such', 'deep', 'understanding', 'Wade', 'character', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Schrader', 'knowledge', 'movement', 'grounded', 'emotionally', 'rich', 'performance', 'here', ""'m"", 'stunned', 'James', 'Coburn', 'won', 'Oscar', 'sadistic', 'portrayal', 'Wade', 'abusive', 'father', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'hand', 'Oscar', 'do', 'believe', 'marvelous', 'here', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'not', 'face', 'pictured', 'when', 'reading', 'novel', 'so', 'casting', 'Margie', 'seemed', 'bit', 'off', 'wonders', 'part', 'performances', 'feel', 'so', 'small', 'yet', 'hit', 'very', 'hard', 'work', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'may', 'even', 'consider', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'invested', 'establishing', 'dark', 'serenity', 'reading', 'Banks', 'work', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Schrader', 'direction.Still', 'film', 'solid', 'B', 'novel', 'A+']",Affliction VHS

The movie is a fairly straight/monotonic adaptation of an interesting, if exceedingly harsh, Russell Banks novel. It's semi-bulletproof, safely within a current critical comfort zone. Call it snow + Snopes = horror? Those who dislike complication can conveniently duck (&amp;/or complain about) a twisted closing voiceover, immerse themselves in cinema horror. Coburn/Nolte play Snopes father/son without hitches, glitches, or complications. Both performances are excellent, fine single-note acting. Nolte's constable/laborer character &amp; a sensibly estranged ex-wife have a daughter old enough to do miner's canary duty. Her increasing fear of Daddy combines with the ambiguously accidental death of a weekend fatcat/developer/sportsfop hunter to accelerate impending doom. What Sissy Spacek, good at projecting shy but not nearly so good at projecting high specific density, is doing within conversing distance of the bomb seems mysterious, but small town choices ARE limited.Zero suspense (gothics are inexorably predictable), but the closing deconstruction, by a son/brother who has escaped (detached from) the violence, become a Boston academic, is effectively dissonant, indirectly asks questions strictly implicit in slicker variations on the theme. Nolte plays a son who remains, steadfast, bearing/carrying affliction, becoming LIKE his proudly ignorant self-absorbed/reliant toughguy drunk father, but the tale is framed by a prodigal son/brother who MAY too blithely gloss over, in closing, his own known (&amp; better understood than he claims, for his record?) contribution to the chain of events. Yes the rich DO get richer, not to mention more corrupt/arrogant/careless, but what are the costs/wages of trying to normalize, become LIKE the rich?

As ""Affliction"" events transpired, brother academic perhaps carelessly encouraged a complex speculative righteousness in brother constable/plowman/victim[izer] suffering from HORRIFIC toothache. He mentions personal complicity as he sums up the tale, intellectually. Expresses regret/sorrow (feels genuine debt to a brother who sometimes shielded him from the rage of the patriarch?), dismisses a shady landgrab by local yokel smart money as business as usual, strictly officially legal, but will NOT sell the family farm for ski resort development.

Now, don't get me wrong, the film is a compelling, well-made portrait of man's descent into madness, but the tone and subject matter are designed to disturb, and that's exactly what they do.Nick Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse, the only policeman in the kind of small New Hampshire town where a lone policeman has enough time on his hands to also act as a school crossing guard and plow the snow off the streets. A hunting accident leaves a rich man visiting town dead, but the man who was with him - Wade's best friend Jack - didn't see it happen, so he assumes that the man accidentally shot himself. Wade thinks there is more to it than that, and that Jack may have killed him for money.As Wade continues to think about the crime, he gradually loses more and more touch with reality. It doesn't help that since his mother's death, he's been spending more time with the abusive father (James Coburn in a brilliant performance) who has had more influence on him than he'd like to think. Wade never even sees it coming that he's turning into his old man. As Wade's delusion increases, his relationships with his daughter and his girlfriend (Sissy Spacek) deteriorate.Nolte delivers powerfully in the lead role. It's a terribly difficult part to pull off, but he plays it with the exact amount of nuance that few actors can deliver. He makes us truly feel for Wade, especially during the scenes with his daughter, where he's just trying to be a good father, but he has no blueprint for good fatherhood because his own was so awful.James Coburn plays the constantly-drunk father who has no need for anybody or anything except himself and his alcohol. The first time we meet the distant old man in the present day, he doesn't even need heat in his house - even if it kills his wife. Only as we learn more about the father do we learn more about Wade's affliction.There is what I feel is unnecessary narration at a few points throughout the film. This is done by Willem Dafoe as Wade's brother Rolfe. Despite this, I know that this is what critics would describe as a ""good"" film, but I feel I can only recommend it to those who would like to trek into highly unconventional territory - the kind that digs under your skin and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.",4,"Disturbing, disturbing, disturbing, but top-notch acting",1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,2348,"['were', 'pressed', 'describe', 'Affliction', 'one', 'word', 'think', 'word', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'film', 'compelling', 'well-made', 'portrait', 'man', 'descent', 'madness', 'tone', 'subject', 'matter', 'are', 'designed', 'disturb', 'exactly', 'what', 'do.Nick', 'Nolte', 'stars', 'Wade', 'Whitehouse', 'only', 'policeman', 'kind', 'small', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'town', 'where', 'lone', 'policeman', 'enough', 'time', 'hands', 'also', 'act', 'school', 'crossing', 'guard', 'plow', 'snow', 'streets', 'hunting', 'accident', 'rich', 'man', 'visiting', 'town', 'dead', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'Wade', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'happen', 'man', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'Wade', 'thinks', 'more', 'Jack', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'money.As', 'Wade', 'think', 'crime', 'gradually', 'more', 'more', 'touch', 'reality', ""n't"", 'help', 'mother', 'death', 'been', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'abusive', 'father', 'James', 'Coburn', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'who', 'had', 'more', 'influence', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'Wade', 'never', 'even', 'coming', 'turning', 'old', 'man', 'Wade', 'delusion', 'increases', 'relationships', 'daughter', 'girlfriend', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'deteriorate.Nolte', 'delivers', 'powerfully', 'lead', 'role', 'terribly', 'difficult', 'part', 'pull', 'off', 'exact', 'amount', 'nuance', 'few', 'actors', 'can', 'deliver', 'truly', 'feel', 'Wade', 'especially', 'scenes', 'daughter', 'where', 'just', 'trying', 'be', 'good', 'father', 'blueprint', 'good', 'fatherhood', 'own', 'was', 'so', 'awful.James', 'Coburn', 'constantly-drunk', 'father', 'who', 'need', 'anybody', 'anything', 'alcohol', 'first', 'time', 'meet', 'distant', 'old', 'man', 'present', 'day', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'heat', 'house', 'even', 'wife', 'Only', 'learn', 'more', 'father', 'do', 'learn', 'more', 'Wade', 'affliction.There', 'what', 'feel', 'unnecessary', 'narration', 'few', 'points', 'film', 'done', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Wade', 'brother', 'Rolfe', 'know', 'what', 'critics', 'would', 'describe', 'good', 'film', 'feel', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'trek', 'highly', 'unconventional', 'territory', 'kind', 'digs', 'skin', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth']",Affliction VHS

Which makes me wonder what went wrong. The film boasts great location work, actors who are up to the task, and a functional script. So what makes it just an average film?The only thing I can think of is the pacing--the rhythm of the drama unfolding and the space surrounding the performances. Schrader and his editor just don't seem to feel the weight of incidents. They don't understand actors' reactions and the importance of pauses. They seem to think verisimilitude requires abstaining from manipulation (art!).I also have problem with the all-bad father, the petulant daughter, and the general sense that we are dealing with stock-characters. Spacek seems wasted, Cobburn a caricature. Nolte does fine, but would make a stronger impression under the guidance of a better director (an actor's director?). Schrader seems almost uninterested in his characters individuality, as opposed to their narrative positions.The transfer itself is mediocre. To some extent its hum-drum quality reflects the intended dull look of the film. I'm all for mat finish, but not at the expense of detail and presence.If I had to sum it all up, I would say the film lacks PRESENCE, without being able to say with certainty how that's possible.

In this film, he keeps it going, giving a great performance. Watching him as Wade Whitehouse is fun, because he's so good. But in this film, he's also hard to watch. Well, the character is. At first, you feel bad for him, as his daughter clearly doesn't want to spend time with him. However, about three minutes into the film, you discover what a piece of crap this guy is. He's the local cop, but he smokes weed, drives drunk, attacks his ex-wife's new husband for no reason, has no control over his emotions, and without giving it all way, does a lot more idiotic and rude things. Usually, the main character is the person you root for, but in this film, it's simply impossible. They made this character go too far and not retain any qualities worth admiring. A Simple Plan got it right with Bill Paxton's character, who is a good enough man that the audience can forgive him for the bad things he sometimes does. Not the case with Wade Whitehouse. Another aspect about this character that was annoying was his bluntness. Usually, a person (especially a police officer) that is becoming suspicious of a situation and the people involved will keep their suspicions at bay. Wade can't keep his stupid mouth shut and blurts them out in front of everyone, even the people he is suspicious of. Moving on to other aspects, the dialogue, acting, and direction are good, as is the story. I just think it could have been better if they took some other turns. Sure, the end explains it all quite well, but it just doesn't seem very satisfying for some reason. Sissy Spacek, Willem Dafore, and James Coburn are also great, but they can't save this from being a three-star picture. It runs a tad long, as there are some unnecessary scenes that really don't help the story in any clear way. Would I watch it again? No. Am I upset that I did watch it? No. It was worth checking out, at least just to see Nolte's awesome performance. I'm still shocked he hasn't keeled over.

It all goes along by the numbers, Wade alienating himself from everyone  around him. Then at the end it seemed as though they cut out 15 or 20  minutes. It had no &quot;final confrontation&quot;, no &quot;moment of  enlightenment&quot; that would justify what we had just witnessed.  Apparently the screenwriter thought that the burning of the garage was the  climax, and there was no point in going on. If that's true, then he should  have made up an ending. I don't know if a stand off would have worked  because that's not really what this movie is about. Maybe if he went after  his ex and got shot or something. I don't know, some kind of finality.

504970,A1UYL5GIQ8YE77,B00000IQVS,Fred L. Houpt,"[2, 2]","Some films are just escapist fun and make us laugh, sometimes cry, just so that we can forget our daily realities.  Some films are full of fleshy textures that grab our psyche in some hidden recess of the mind and we are transfixed, unable to turn our eyes away, like we often do when passing a terrible road accident or taking notice of a long convoy of mourners on their way to a burial.  The title of this film ""Affliction"" is so perfectly apt and descriptive and sets the tone immediately.  Throughout the film there is a relentless, twisting anxiety that disturbs and sets our nerves on edge.  The premise of the film vibrates on a scale larger than most lives and it takes on a slightly metaphorical and almost dream like quality.  Which is not to say that some lives don't unravel as badly as Nick Nolte's character.  His characters decline is like a slow-motion avalanche, cascading down a very large mountain, picking up mass and momentum with each new twist and turn.  When the end finally comes to the character it is not anticlimatic but feels inevitable.This film can be very disturbing to those who have suffered brutality from the hands of a close family member, especially when they were young.  It is passing strange that another of Nolte's famous characterizations, in ""The Prince of Tides"" also touches on exactly the same nightmarish childhood traumas.  Nolte's acting techniques, as much as they are often explosive on the outside, with rapid body gestures and movements, with that strained smokers voice....they are here. But the substantial power is all internalized; one look at that face and we know how much pain is registered at the moment it penetrates, deep inside.  He is a very open and emotive actor who makes room in himself for the story to work its alchemy.  James Coburn's leering, sickly, dangerous, almost psychopathic character makes everyone on edge when he is awake.  That one scene where Nolte and girlfriend (Cissy Spacek) go to visit his parents and they can't help but notice that the house is freezing cold....and they find his dad drunk asleep but unharmed....and we just know that something terrible has happened upstairs.  This type of gut wrenching drama drives the story into the despair that lies at the core of the family.  Nolte's brother (in the film: Willem Dafoe) portrays the calm and detached spirit of someone who long ago removed himself from the family quicksand.  However, in a telling scene where he tells his brother (Nolte) that at least he didn't grow up suffering from the brutality of his father, Nolte laughs, asking him ""is that what you think,eh?""  One wonders which one of the brothers were more fully engaged with the family traumas?This a very powerful and unsettling film, with a tense angst shot through from the beginning to the end.  The cast is strong throughout.  Many have commented that this might be Nolte's finest performance.  His role in ""The Thin Red Line"" is equally moving and gut wrenching.  This is an adult drama that lingers in the mind and is worthy of a good film library.  Highly recommended....and shot up in Quebec, of all places.",5,The dark soul of family shadows,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,3129,"['films', 'are', 'just', 'escapist', 'fun', 'make', 'sometimes', 'cry', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'forget', 'daily', 'realities', 'films', 'are', 'full', 'fleshy', 'textures', 'grab', 'psyche', 'hidden', 'recess', 'mind', 'are', 'transfixed', 'unable', 'turn', 'eyes', 'away', 'often', 'do', 'when', 'passing', 'terrible', 'road', 'accident', 'taking', 'notice', 'long', 'convoy', 'mourners', 'way', 'burial', 'title', 'film', 'Affliction', 'so', 'perfectly', 'apt', 'descriptive', 'tone', 'immediately', 'film', 'relentless', 'twisting', 'anxiety', 'nerves', 'edge', 'premise', 'film', 'vibrates', 'scale', 'larger', 'most', 'lives', 'slightly', 'metaphorical', 'almost', 'dream', 'quality', 'Which', 'not', 'say', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'unravel', 'as', 'badly', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'character', 'characters', 'decline', 'slow-motion', 'avalanche', 'cascading', 'down', 'very', 'large', 'mountain', 'picking', 'up', 'mass', 'momentum', 'new', 'twist', 'turn', 'When', 'end', 'finally', 'character', 'not', 'anticlimatic', 'inevitable.This', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'disturbing', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'brutality', 'hands', 'close', 'family', 'member', 'especially', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'passing', 'strange', 'Nolte', 'famous', 'characterizations', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'also', 'exactly', 'same', 'nightmarish', 'childhood', 'traumas', 'Nolte', 'acting', 'techniques', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'often', 'explosive', 'outside', 'rapid', 'body', 'gestures', 'movements', 'strained', 'smokers', 'voice', '.they', 'are', 'here', 'substantial', 'power', 'internalized', 'one', 'look', 'face', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'pain', 'registered', 'moment', 'deep', 'inside', 'very', 'open', 'emotive', 'actor', 'who', 'room', 'story', 'work', 'alchemy', 'James', 'Coburn', 'leering', 'sickly', 'dangerous', 'almost', 'psychopathic', 'character', 'everyone', 'edge', 'when', 'awake', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Nolte', 'girlfriend', 'Cissy', 'Spacek', 'go', 'visit', 'parents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'house', 'freezing', 'cold', '.and', 'find', 'dad', 'drunk', 'asleep', 'unharmed', '.and', 'just', 'know', 'something', 'terrible', 'happened', 'upstairs', 'type', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'drama', 'story', 'despair', 'core', 'family', 'Nolte', 'brother', 'film', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'calm', 'detached', 'spirit', 'someone', 'who', 'long', 'ago', 'removed', 'family', 'quicksand', 'However', 'telling', 'scene', 'where', 'brother', 'Nolte', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'suffering', 'brutality', 'father', 'Nolte', 'asking', 'what', 'think', 'eh', 'One', 'one', 'brothers', 'were', 'more', 'fully', 'engaged', 'family', 'traumas', 'very', 'powerful', 'unsettling', 'film', 'tense', 'angst', 'shot', 'beginning', 'end', 'cast', 'strong', 'Many', 'have', 'commented', 'might', 'be', 'Nolte', 'finest', 'performance', 'role', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'equally', 'moving', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'adult', 'drama', 'mind', 'worthy', 'good', 'film', 'library', 'Highly', 'recommended', '.and', 'shot', 'up', 'Quebec', 'places']",Affliction VHS

504975,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00000IQVS,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 2]","A film about the impossible relations between a father and a son, with a second younger son in the background. The father is an alcoholic. He is violent and brutal. He educates his sons, always under the influence, with the most tyrannical hand he can manage in that state. He terrorizes his wife and he blocks his sons in defensive attitudes. The elder son will turn aggressive and paranoid. The younger son will remain aloof and protect his sanity by this distance. The mother will suffer and eventually die. The elder son reproduces his father's domineering attitude with his wife and daughter and gets into a divorce that he negociates wrongly, accepting everything from his wife not to appear like his father, but to appear like a good father. This leads to impossible relations with his daughter that reacts defensively at once, keeping her distance with this father of hers she probably loves, because she needs him, and hates because she cannot communicate with him. He tries to do good but imposes it so harshly at times that a treat at a restaurant becomes an ordeal. Then he has to take care of his widowed father and that makes him jump over the edge of the abyss. A hunting accident becomes for him the core of a plot against him and teh community, and he becomes Jesus Christ the justice maker in his village. He sees some speculation but misses the point, which is the development of a skiing resort in the village, promoting it into a rich community. He does not want any change : he wants his explosive self to keep the environment that produced that explosive nature of his, which is morbid. This leads to his justice trip, killing the cause of his paranoia, killing a presumed assassin that is no assassin at all, and disappearing in the limbos of anonimity with two deaths on his conscience. This film could have been a masterpiece if it had not been told from the point of view of the younger son, but from the point of view of the elder son, which means from these limbos of society where he has finally recovered some distanciation that could produce a perspective, a vista back over his life.

Everyone that comes into contact with Coburn's character is left wounded.It's a story about a cop in a small town who is trying to connect with his daughter, fight his ex-wife for custody, begin a new life with a new woman, tend to his father who has just lost his wife, investigate a hunting accident involving his best friend and coming to grips with his past, his family and his future.This is no light hearted movie. There is depth and feeling. This movie might not make you feel happy, but it succeeds in reaching into your emotions and forcing you to feel what the main character is feeling. Not always pretty, but very effective.This is one of the better movies I have seen. The acting is superb, the story is meaningful, the scenery makes you feel cold. 5 stars for this film for having the ability to bring out emotions in the viewer.

He is divorced and trying and to get custody of his young  daughter who rejects his fumbling efforts to be nice to her.  James Coburn  is excellent as Nick Nolte's father, a brutal and angry old man who  typifies a sick machismo which has in turn afflicted his son.  His acting  is extraordinary as is Nolte's although their styles are different. Noltle  is subtle; his facial expressions are controlled and typical of a man who  has learned to hold in emotion.  Coburn's face, on the other hand, is more  deeply expressive;  his eyebrows move, his mouth hardens, his eyes  glare.This is the kind of dark, brooding movie that I like.  For a brief  few hours I enter its world and get completely absorbed in the characters  in the way I did with &quot;A thousand Acres&quot; or &quot;The Horse  Whisperers&quot;.

The movie starts in gray and ends in black, without virtually any brighter momenent.Nick Nolte's performance as Wade, a man who wasted his life and is unable to save anything from the wreckage is one of the saddest things I saw on the screen those last years. James Coburn gives a GREAT performance as Wade's old father, a violent, bad mouthed and bad tempered drunk without anything good in him. Sissy Spacek plays Wade's girlfriend, his last chance to save something from the catastrophy that was his life, a chance he will finally not seize.Willem Dafoe plays a little but significant role, as Wade's younger brother, who without even really wanting it actually will push him over the edge, to the abyss... Finally Jim True-Frost (credited as Jim True), who later landed a big role as detective Roland Pryzbylewski in HBO's series ""The Wire"", plays the role of Jack Hewitt, Wade's best friend, who has the bad luck to be in the wrong place at a wrong time during a hunt...This is the kind of movie I didn't really realise was made in USA anymore - it shows the poor, rural, mostly white America (here the New Hampshire), where a local businessman and mayor can really rule as a feudal lord in the Dark Ages and where there is so much misery (social as well as economical) that one of characters actually freezes to death in her house in winter, because there is no money to repair the heating - and her relatives have all but forgotten about her...In a way this film was more horrifying to watch than most of the horrors I saw. Seeing the total destruction of a man, who already was down, is a horrible vision - but it can make a really good movie.

He is fighting it, and is therefore at  hearta brave man. But why is it a monumental battle of will for him to  risist as millions do the world over? WHY IS HE HAVING WITHDRAWEL SYMPTOMS?  In agony, like a heroin addict resisting the drug, the release that an  outburst of violence would provide. Perhaps he does because he is an  intelligent man and can see the consequences , but many drug addicts ae  intelligent people too. Perhaps because he's been on the recieving end of  his father's vicious beating, a fact that makes brute force repulsive to  him, but also makes it come naturally.It is in his genes now.  Like  pregnant mother using heroin, in a way voilent fathers pass a drug to the  children they beat, one that like its chemical counterpart requires rehab.  Wade (Nick Nolte) the tragic center of Paul Shrader's film tries and fails  to fight his upringing or as it is referred to here Affliction. In one of  the film's most harrowing scenes when Wade finally beats up those who are  close to him, his father (James Coburn) looks at him and says &quot;There's  my boy.&quot; Later Nolte hits him on the head with a log of wood and says  &quot;I love you&quot; and MEANS IT.  Nick Nolte's performance is perhaps  one of the decade's finest. He roams through the streets of this little  town, gradually losing control, nursing a vicious toothache, begging for  dignity and respect of the townfolk. He acts childish, paranoid, vicious  and angry all in one monumental performance. By the end of the film he is  almost literally possesed by the old man's spirit, with those face  contortions he starts to look like what he has become, his father.  If the  film has one flaw, it is the character of Rolf (Willem Defoe) who was the  protected brother that the father wouldn't touch. He seems a tad  hipocritical when in the voice-over narration he acuses his brother of  chasing fantasies about a murder plot, when at the time he suggested it, it  made sense to him and to us as an audience. Still this is a minor  contrivance to make a thematic point about Wade's decent.

Nick Nolte is a favorite and he certainly delivers a powerfull, deeply human performance here.  James Coburn is perfect as his truly odious abusive father.  Nolte has a way of making his characters sympathetic even when they are doing horrible things.  We can see from the opening scene, a Halloween party where he tries to amuse his daughter, that the guy is trying to do the right thing but that he's never going to make it.  He has the ""affliction"" and nothing he does works out.From this unhappy start things only get worse.  That's the problem with the film--there's no contrast between light and dark, tragedy and happiness.  No one grows, develops, changes.  I'm not saying that every film has to have a happy ending but just watching someone go down and down before your eyes isn't worth watching.  Yes, it makes the point---that abusive fathers breed flawed children--but this is hardly news.Some good actors are wasted.  Sissy Spacek didn't seem right for the part.  I kept wondering what such a nice girl saw in this train wreck of a guy.

It staid with me and, as I had a chance to see it again tonight, it still makes a very strong impression.The premise of the movie sounds like the old Biblical proverb that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the sons.  Most of us have seen a lot of truth in that adage.  Likewise most of us never had a father like Wade did in ""Affliction"".  This is an extreme lesson in that Wade's father (played excellently by James Coburn) is an alcoholic, abusive, #%@**&$.The movie develops the theme extremely well.  We start out with seemingly but tellingly innocent glimpses of Wade's incompetance as a father.  He is divorced, his young daughter is with him for Halloween, he can't think of much to say to her and keeps finding ways to leave her to go out and gab with the guys.  The movie gets our attention with the emergance of a somewhat interesting plot.  However, all along we become a bit more uncomfortable with the character of Wade.  Yet, if we think Wade is weird, we KNOW that his father is psychotic.  Coburn won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant and haunting preformance an the evil father.  Events create the need for Wade to move back home with his father and that's when things really go downhill for him.  Enough about the plot!  The power of ""Affliction"" is in the characters of the father and son.  This movie will disturb you and some may want to challenge the message.  Fair enough.  I certainly can't complain about my upbringing so I don't have a point of comparison.  However, I have noticed, over the years, little picadillos that confuse me until I remember their origen im my childhood.  I believe that the basic premise is true and the auther, to make a point, picked a extreme example.Watch ""Affliction"" for its' excellence in acting, writing, and directing.

Putting the two of themtogether, one would assume that the resulting film hadan above-average chance of being godawful. And yetsomehow, what they ended up with was Affliction, amovie that garnered Best Actor noms for Nolte fromeveryone who matters and most who don't, and actuallygarnered a Best Supporting academy award for JamesCoburn. The Academy, of course, have never been theworld's best judges of taste, but they hit the markthis time.Wade Whitehouse (Nolte) is a part-time cop and cityworker in a small town in upstate New Hampshire. He'sburderned with a pain-in-the-ass ex-wife (Mary BethHurt), a new girlfriend (Sissy Spacek), a boss who's abit too slick for his own good (Homes Osborne), and analcoholic father (Coburn) whose path he's dangerouslyclose to treading himself. When deer season beginswith a suspicious hunting accident, both Whitehouseand his boss resent the State Police horning inimmediately, and Whitehouse starts investigating.Ultimately, the movie is a character study ofWhitehouse and his relationship to his father, and themystery of the dead deer hunter takes, or should take,second stage to this. And this is the film's onlymajor failing; Schrader and Russell Banks (adaptinghis own short story) feel the need, after sublimatingthe mystery in the film's climax, to tie up the looseends the script has spent two hours demanding be leftat the end. Losing the last two minutes of narrationwould have done this film a world of good. But thoselast two minutes aren't enough to undercut the firsthundred sixteen, which are excellent through andthrough. I'm not normally a fan of Nick Nolte in anyway, shape, or form, but he's excellent in here, as isCoburn. Sissy Spacek shows us why she never shouldhave fallen into obscurity after an all-too-shortstint on the A-list, and Willem Dafoe, who playsWade's brother Rolf, does his usual excellent jobdespite having very little screen time. Aside from thewealth of starpower, the cinematography is grand.Well, as long as you like snow, snow, and more snow.Nice to see someone using something other thandarkness to give a feeling of claustrophobia.The climax, in this Oprah-infested age, ispredictable, especially to anyone who's even vaguelyfamiliar with Russell Banks.

Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) is a second-rate sheriff in wintry, upstate New Hampshire who doubles as a worker for a landscaping contractor (Holmes Osborne) to make ends meet. He lives in a trailer. He wears flannel sweatshirts and raggedy coats. He smokes marijuana, drinks incessantly. Wade's  pushed by almost everyone, his mind is half-clogged by his ex-wife (Mary Beth Hurt), a distant, cold woman who took Wade's equally distant, cold daughter with her when they divorced.Nolte, in the best work of his long career, has a chewed-up face, bad haircut, slouchy demeanor. But his presence looms larger in ""Affliction"" than it ever has before. His outbursts of anger are matched solely by his father, Glen (James Coburn). Through flashbacks Glen's character is fleshed out as less a man than a force of hatred, tainting all those around him.Rarely has been a performance so wickedly effective. Coburn, who won the Academy Award for this role, snarls, growls, cackles; he's a derivative of evil, a man who's been allowed to rule by fear and intimidation, a man who, when his wife dies, is still taken in by the son who truly hates him.Their toxic kinship is surrounded by a curious murder investigation that serves as a catalyst to Wade's descent. It seems a town bigshot (Sean McCann) accidentally shot himself with a rifle in a hunting accident. Wade thinks otherwise. Possibly it was a murder. There is some evidence to support it, though ""Affliction is no whodunit. Wade perceives the murder as a chance to finally best his detractors; we know it will only sink him further.By the end, all of Wade's problems sink into one, and they all lead to one place: dad's house.",4,Paul Schrader's stark masterwork.,1069891200,"11 27, 2003",2003,1967,"['Affliction', 'rare', 'peephole', 'abyss', 'weaknesses', 'then', 'downward', 'spiral', 'desolation', 'fear', 'one', 'character', 'Man', 'seduction', 'revenge', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'who', 'wrote', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Mosquito', 'Coast', 'here', 'Russell', 'Banks', 'novel', 'Wade', 'Whitehouse', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'second-rate', 'sheriff', 'wintry', 'upstate', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'who', 'worker', 'landscaping', 'contractor', 'Holmes', 'Osborne', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'trailer', 'flannel', 'sweatshirts', 'raggedy', 'coats', 'marijuana', 'incessantly', 'Wade', 'pushed', 'almost', 'everyone', 'mind', 'half-clogged', 'ex-wife', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt', 'distant', 'cold', 'woman', 'who', 'took', 'Wade', 'equally', 'distant', 'cold', 'daughter', 'when', 'divorced.Nolte', 'best', 'work', 'long', 'career', 'chewed-up', 'face', 'bad', 'haircut', 'slouchy', 'demeanor', 'presence', 'larger', 'Affliction', 'ever', 'before', 'outbursts', 'anger', 'are', 'matched', 'solely', 'father', 'Glen', 'James', 'Coburn', 'flashbacks', 'Glen', 'character', 'fleshed', 'out', 'less', 'man', 'force', 'hatred', 'tainting', 'him.Rarely', 'been', 'performance', 'so', 'wickedly', 'effective', 'Coburn', 'who', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'snarls', 'growls', 'cackles', 'derivative', 'evil', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'allowed', 'rule', 'fear', 'intimidation', 'man', 'who', 'when', 'wife', 'dies', 'still', 'taken', 'son', 'who', 'truly', 'him.Their', 'toxic', 'kinship', 'surrounded', 'curious', 'murder', 'investigation', 'catalyst', 'Wade', 'descent', 'town', 'bigshot', 'Sean', 'McCann', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'rifle', 'hunting', 'accident', 'Wade', 'otherwise', 'Possibly', 'was', 'murder', 'evidence', 'support', 'Affliction', 'whodunit', 'murder', 'chance', 'finally', 'best', 'detractors', 'know', 'will', 'only', 'sink', 'further.By', 'end', 'Wade', 'problems', 'sink', 'one', 'lead', 'one', 'place', 'dad', 'house']",Affliction VHS

Small-town New Hampshire constable Nick Nolte investigates an accidental shooting that he believes to be murder; meanwhile, his personal life deteriorates as he is haunted by a horrific childhood terrorized by a drunken, abusive father (played brilliantly by James Coburn, who would earn an Oscar for the role).The story twists and turns between two themes, but mainly gets tangled and disjointed by the end of the film.  Schrader does not seem confident in choosing to focus more on the murder conspiracy or the father-son relationship between Nolte and Coburn.  While Coburn's performance was celebrated, Sissy Spacek is very good as Nolte's wife and William Dafoe is perfectly casted as the concerned, loving brother.  The final result of &quot;Affliction&quot; is melodramatic, slightly bleak, and overall implausible; however, the excellent roles carry this motion picture from the gutter and heighten it as a moderately effective drama.",3,Affliction  (1999),1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,1457,"['Director', 'Paul', 'SchraderCast', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'James', 'Coburn', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'Jim', 'True', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt.Running', 'Time', '114', 'minutes.Rated', 'R', 'language', 'mild', 'child', 'abuse.Director', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'account', 'troubles', 'child', 'abuse', 'can', 'bring', 'afflicted', 'much', 'later', 'life', 'everlasting', 'affect', 'criminality', 'brutality', 'fear', 'can', 'cause', 'quot', 'Affliction', 'quot', 'not', 'uplifting', 'film', 'drag', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'very', 'powerful', 'depressing', 'Small-town', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'constable', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'accidental', 'shooting', 'be', 'murder', 'meanwhile', 'personal', 'life', 'deteriorates', 'haunted', 'horrific', 'childhood', 'terrorized', 'drunken', 'abusive', 'father', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'James', 'Coburn', 'who', 'would', 'earn', 'Oscar', 'role', '.The', 'story', 'twists', 'turns', 'two', 'themes', 'mainly', 'tangled', 'disjointed', 'end', 'film', 'Schrader', 'not', 'seem', 'confident', 'choosing', 'focus', 'more', 'murder', 'conspiracy', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'Nolte', 'Coburn', 'Coburn', 'performance', 'was', 'celebrated', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'very', 'good', 'Nolte', 'wife', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'perfectly', 'casted', 'concerned', 'loving', 'brother', 'final', 'result', 'quot', 'Affliction', 'quot', 'melodramatic', 'slightly', 'bleak', 'overall', 'implausible', 'however', 'excellent', 'roles', 'carry', 'motion', 'picture', 'gutter', 'heighten', 'moderately', 'effective', 'drama']",Affliction VHS

The abuse of a child lingers on, and it's so evident in this movie. I have a very difficult relantionship with my own father, and found myself moved to tears in this movie. The ending shocked me, and very few movies have the power to do that to me.

Nolte's physical performance looks unscripted, as he assaults the other actors in an intense confrontation, and they react with shock and surprise. It's a testament to both Nolte and Holmes Osborne that they pull off the scene; the two younger actors look rattled.The same spontaneous violence happens in other places. Nolte pulls off the contradictions well; he's good-hearted but powerless, violent and contrite. ""I'm like a kicked dog,"" he says, ""and one day I'm gonna bite."" And it's easy to believe.Unfortunately, his performance doesn't carry the film. Jim True, as Jack, is unconvincing. The grainy flashbacks, intended to be powerful, are cliched (though Coburn as the father in old age is mostly excellent). Spacek is underused. Dafoe's narration is grating and unnecessary.I really wanted to like the whole movie, but I wound up just being impressed by some of the acting and frustrated by the rest.",3,Not quite good,1025049600,"06 26, 2002",2002,1039,"['were', 'startling', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'when', 'Wade', 'Nolte', 'Gordon', 'office', 'fired', 'Nolte', 'physical', 'performance', 'looks', 'unscripted', 'other', 'actors', 'intense', 'confrontation', 'react', 'shock', 'surprise', 'testament', 'Nolte', 'Holmes', 'Osborne', 'pull', 'scene', 'two', 'younger', 'actors', 'look', 'rattled.The', 'same', 'spontaneous', 'violence', 'happens', 'other', 'places', 'Nolte', 'contradictions', 'well', 'good-hearted', 'powerless', 'violent', 'contrite', ""'m"", 'kicked', 'dog', 'one', 'day', ""'m"", 'gon', 'bite', 'easy', 'believe.Unfortunately', 'performance', ""n't"", 'carry', 'film', 'Jim', 'True', 'Jack', 'unconvincing', 'grainy', 'flashbacks', 'intended', 'be', 'powerful', 'are', 'cliched', 'though', 'Coburn', 'father', 'old', 'age', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'Spacek', 'underused', 'Dafoe', 'narration', 'grating', 'unnecessary.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'whole', 'movie', 'wound', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'impressed', 'acting', 'frustrated', 'rest']",Affliction VHS
505011,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00000IQVS,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","I never watched Affliction until a few days ago, and was pleasantly surprised. The story centers around Nick Nolte, who plays a small town cop going through a rough patch, with a failed marriage, and a young daughter who seems to be growing apart from him. He pursues a shooting case that he suspects is a murder conspiracy, and things get more complicated when his mother dies, forcing him to take responsibility for an aging dad who is also violent &abusive; [played convincingly by James Coburn].There are frequent flashbacks by Nolte to his violent childhood [the make-up people did a great job in portraying a youngish looking James Coburn], and Coburn does a great job playing the abusive, alcoholic father who rages at his family [wife, and two sons].There are good supporting roles here besides James Coburn...there is Sissy Spacek who plays Margie, the supportive lover to Nolte's character. There is Willem Dafoe, who though has limited screen time, provides the voice-over narration for the movie & also plays the younger son, Rolfe, who distances himself from the domestic tragedy that is his past by pursuing a scholarly life.The story is not really anything new: a violent and abusive legacy that torments Nolte's character, begging the question: is the cycle of violence & abuse something that is cyclical, doomed to be repeated through successive generations? Yet, despite the predictable storyline, the acting is excellent, and the story moves along at a steady pace, as we slowly witness Nolte's cop character being driven slowly but surely towards the brink... a dark and tragic story that makes for compelling viewing.",5,Stellar acting makes for compelling viewing,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,1638,"['never', 'watched', 'Affliction', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'story', 'centers', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'cop', 'going', 'rough', 'patch', 'failed', 'marriage', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'be', 'growing', 'apart', 'shooting', 'case', 'murder', 'conspiracy', 'things', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'mother', 'dies', 'forcing', 'take', 'responsibility', 'aging', 'dad', 'who', 'also', 'violent', 'abusive', 'played', 'convincingly', 'James', 'Coburn', ']', 'are', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'Nolte', 'violent', 'childhood', '[', 'make-up', 'people', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'youngish', 'looking', 'James', 'Coburn', ']', 'Coburn', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'who', 'family', '[', 'wife', 'two', 'sons', ']', 'are', 'good', 'supporting', 'roles', 'here', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'who', 'Margie', 'supportive', 'lover', 'Nolte', 'character', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'movie', 'also', 'younger', 'son', 'Rolfe', 'who', 'domestic', 'tragedy', 'past', 'pursuing', 'scholarly', 'life.The', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'new', 'violent', 'abusive', 'legacy', 'Nolte', 'character', 'begging', 'question', 'cycle', 'violence', 'abuse', 'something', 'cyclical', 'doomed', 'be', 'repeated', 'successive', 'generations', 'Yet', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'acting', 'excellent', 'story', 'along', 'steady', 'pace', 'slowly', 'witness', 'Nolte', 'cop', 'character', 'being', 'driven', 'slowly', 'surely', 'brink', 'dark', 'tragic', 'story', 'compelling', 'viewing']",Affliction VHS
