There is something about the grain in the picture that feels so much more realistic than video. It's one of the reasons I have a natural love of film and why I love films like Robert Siegel's (The Line) SWIMMING. A literate and beautiful postcard of one summer in the life of Frankie Wheeler (Lauren Ambrose, Can't Hardly Wait).Frankie has lived in Myrtle Beach for her entire life. She's left it only once to visit her parents who had moved to Arizona to retire. Her parents used to run a restaurant that catered to the tourists who crowd the beaches in the summer. When they retired they left the restaurant to Frankie and her brother Neil (Josh Pais, A Beautiful Mind), whom keep it running `til this day.Frankie is the kind of girl whose kind of shy and introverted and a tad bit homely. Which makes her best friend Nicola (Jennifer Dundas, Changing Lanes) the exact opposite. Nicola is outgoing and kind of sexy but she cares deeply for Frankie, and is willing to spite others who may be out to lose her friend. But when Josee (Joelle Carter, High Fidelity), a new girl blows into town and starts to get closer to Frankie, it test the two best friends loyalty.This is Ambrose's movie. She embodies the right characteristics to play Frankie with such sweet and strong confidence. She commands the movie without trying too hard. She grows and changes without fireworks and `beat over your head' sentiment. How does she make it look so easy?There is not one moment you can isolate out of this movie and point to as the reason why this movie works because her performance is that good. You don't give a damn about a plot holes, silly dialogue or various subplots that go nowhere, because you naturally care for Frankie as a human, not just as some film character. You want to see her grow, you want to see her smile, and you just want to be there to watch as her life unfolds.SWIMMING doesn't attempt to give you clear-cut excuses for what's going on? I liked that. I liked not having to figure out why a minor character had to talk to an invisible guy. I liked that Frankie and Josee's relationship isn't quite clear. I like that the movie just let little moments happen, with absolutely no need for stunning revelations....What a great movie SWIMMING is. I Highly recommend it.",4,What A Great Movie,1061337600,"08 20, 2003",2003,2347,"['Film', 'quality', 'other', 'medium', 'catch', 'hold', 'life', 'something', 'grain', 'picture', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'video', 'one', 'reasons', 'have', 'natural', 'love', 'film', 'why', 'love', 'films', 'Robert', 'Siegel', 'Line', 'SWIMMING', 'literate', 'beautiful', 'postcard', 'one', 'summer', 'life', 'Frankie', 'Wheeler', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', '.Frankie', 'lived', 'Myrtle', 'Beach', 'entire', 'life', 'left', 'only', 'once', 'visit', 'parents', 'who', 'had', 'moved', 'Arizona', 'retire', 'parents', 'used', 'run', 'restaurant', 'catered', 'tourists', 'who', 'crowd', 'beaches', 'summer', 'When', 'retired', 'left', 'restaurant', 'Frankie', 'brother', 'Neil', 'Josh', 'Pais', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'whom', 'keep', 'running', 'til', 'day.Frankie', 'kind', 'girl', 'kind', 'shy', 'introverted', 'tad', 'bit', 'homely', 'Which', 'best', 'friend', 'Nicola', 'Jennifer', 'Dundas', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Nicola', 'outgoing', 'kind', 'sexy', 'deeply', 'Frankie', 'willing', 'spite', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'out', 'lose', 'friend', 'when', 'Josee', 'Joelle', 'Carter', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'new', 'girl', 'town', 'get', 'closer', 'Frankie', 'test', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'loyalty.This', 'Ambrose', 'movie', 'right', 'characteristics', 'play', 'Frankie', 'such', 'sweet', 'strong', 'confidence', 'movie', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'changes', 'fireworks', 'beat', 'head', 'sentiment', 'How', 'make', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'can', 'isolate', 'movie', 'point', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'performance', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'plot', 'holes', 'silly', 'dialogue', 'various', 'subplots', 'go', 'nowhere', 'naturally', 'care', 'Frankie', 'human', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'character', 'want', 'see', 'grow', 'want', 'see', 'smile', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'watch', 'life', 'unfolds.SWIMMING', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'give', 'clear-cut', 'excuses', 'what', 'going', 'liked', 'liked', 'not', 'having', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'minor', 'character', 'had', 'talk', 'invisible', 'guy', 'liked', 'Frankie', 'Josee', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'quite', 'clear', 'like', 'movie', 'just', 'let', 'little', 'moments', 'happen', 'absolutely', 'need', 'stunning', 'revelations', 'great', 'movie', 'SWIMMING', 'Highly', 'recommend']",Swimming

I feel that she always has the same expression on her face, eyes wide open, appearing as if she is sick or scared all of the time.I thought that I would maybe like this movie because the  preview looked interesting. Frankie (Lauren Ambrose) is the main character, and she co-owns a restaurant with her brother, but he does most of the work, and she waitresses. She doesn't have a car, hangs around with the same girl (Nicola) all of the time, and basically wanders through her life, which isn't that interesting to begin with. The thing is, with a main character that is shown alone so often throughout the movie, we should be able to tell what she is feeling on her face if she is to carry the movie, but I couldn't.This new girl comes into town, and Frankie seems to be very taken by her, and vice versa. They click, Nicola becomes jealous, and we start to wonder if there are feelings that Nicola has for Frankie, because of how strongly her negative feelings are for the ""new girl."" I also started to wonder if Frankie was going to experience anything with the new girl because of all of the tension that seems to go on. Franie then meets a guy who lives in his van with two dogs and sells Tie Dye t-shirts, and everything changes.It appears that there are a lot of people that are using each other in this film. I gave it two stars but there were some interesting things that ""could have"" come from it, but, nothing really did, and the ending just sort of ""happened."" I understand that there are some movies that are just supposed to show you a ""slice of life,"" but I can't even consider this being a coming of age movie, because the character didn't really seem to learn any life altering lessons, or change anything about her life that she was unhappy with.",2,Never seemed to go anywhere...,1060041600,"08 5, 2003",2003,1800,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'feel', 'always', 'same', 'expression', 'face', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'appearing', 'sick', 'scared', 'time.I', 'thought', 'would', 'maybe', 'movie', 'preview', 'looked', 'interesting', 'Frankie', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'main', 'character', 'restaurant', 'brother', 'most', 'work', ""n't"", 'have', 'car', 'hangs', 'same', 'girl', 'Nicola', 'time', 'basically', 'wanders', 'life', ""n't"", 'that', 'interesting', 'begin', 'thing', 'main', 'character', 'shown', 'alone', 'so', 'often', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'what', 'feeling', 'face', 'carry', 'movie', ""couldn't.This"", 'new', 'girl', 'town', 'Frankie', 'be', 'very', 'taken', 'vice', 'versa', 'click', 'Nicola', 'jealous', 'start', 'wonder', 'are', 'feelings', 'Nicola', 'Frankie', 'how', 'strongly', 'negative', 'feelings', 'are', 'new', 'girl', 'also', 'started', 'wonder', 'Frankie', 'was', 'going', 'experience', 'anything', 'new', 'girl', 'tension', 'go', 'Franie', 'then', 'guy', 'who', 'van', 'two', 'dogs', 'Tie', 'Dye', 't-shirts', 'everything', 'changes.It', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'using', 'other', 'film', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'were', 'interesting', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'nothing', 'really', 'did', 'ending', 'just', 'sort', 'happened', 'understand', 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'supposed', 'show', 'slice', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'being', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'learn', 'life', 'altering', 'lessons', 'change', 'anything', 'life', 'was', 'unhappy']",Swimming

Menta, Jr.","[3, 5]","""Swimming"" is a pleasant, watchable slice-of-life drama, but in its zeal not to make any judgements or draw any conclusions about its characters, the end result is a little muddy.  Still, many of its characters, especially the one played by Lauren Ambrose (of ""Six Feet Under"" fame), are likable and engaging, and- at ninety minutes or so- the movie doesn't overstay its welcome.

747745,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00008W2R4,Wuchak,"[4, 5]","""Swimming"" (as in 'sink or swim') is a slice-of-life coming-of-age indie flick centered around the life of Frankie, played by Lauren Ambrose, who co-owns a small Myrtle Beach restaurant/bar with her older brother, Neil. Frankie is about 18 or 19 and is trying to find her place, purpose and identity in the world. She could be pretty but has no sense of style or charisma. She just kind of innocently mopes around. Her best friend is the sexy wild-child Nicola, who runs a body-piercing salon next to the restaurant.When the ultra-sexy Josee, played by Joelle Carter, strolls into town it stirs up the curiosity of Frankie, the jealousy of Nicola and the lust of Neil and every other man, except Heath, a tie-dye shirt salesman who lives in his van with his dogs. Heath is a bit of a grunge/stoner and only has eyes for Frankie.Make no mistake, although ""Swimming"" is a quiet little indie film, it's a 5-Star piece all the way. The story is strangely engrossing and highly realistic. If you're older than 25 it very accurately brings to memory those fun-yet-dreadful 'coming-of-age' years (if you're younger than 25 you're STILL coming of age). The characters are all highly believable; it's almost as if you know them, hence you CARE about their lives and their story. Also, although this is a drama there's quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.The character of Josee is very intesting. She's ravishing, ultra-confident and overflowing with charisma. She knows this and uses it to her advantage to get whatever she wants. For example, she entices the lifeguard so she can have a free place to stay by the beach and charms Neil for a waitress job even though he doesn't need anyone, not to mention she's a lousy worker. She also charms Frankie in more than one sense. Josee instinctively senses that Frankie is kind of lost and that she can 'wow' her with her star appeal. Frankie naturally becomes a bit star-struck by Josee and it negatively affects her relationship with Nicola.A reviewer on IMDb wrongly deduced that Frankie is a butch lesbian and just doesn't realize it yet. This is an inaccurate interpretation and I'll tell you why (it's obvious): Josee realizes the power she has over Frankie and is indeed attempting to stir her love and desire, and not just on a friendship level. You see, Josee feeds off of desire, from both men and women, regardless of the nature of the desire. It's clear in the film that, out of curiosity, Frankie briefly (yet seriously) considers the idea of lesbianism, such is the alluring power of Josee. Ultimately, however, she rejects it. Josee's spell over Frankie is broken once Frankie sees her true selfish, using and fickle nature. Frankie then re-focuses her romanic energy on heath and restores her friendship with partygirl Nicola, who had gotten into trouble with the law.Josee's character is well portrayed in the laugh-out-loud scene where she's having sex with the lifeguard she's living with. The guy is passionately into it but Josee is obviously quite bored by the whole experience (in her mind she's just paying her room & board). It's hilarious and so true-to-life.I'm genuinely surprised by some of the mediocre ratings of ""Swimming."" They evidently don't get it 'cause this is film-making of the finest expertise.
