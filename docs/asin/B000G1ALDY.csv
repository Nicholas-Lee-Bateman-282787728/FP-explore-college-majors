998024,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000G1ALDY,B. E Jackson,"[1, 3]","Well, the Breed is probably not THAT great because the movie is basically another ""kill all the teenagers one by one"" kind of horror film which is not much different from any number of slasher films out there.One thing that's pretty funny to me is that, when the dogs were attacking the teens, many times you can tell the dogs were happy while supposedly tearing people apart.  The film directors should have cut away any scenes that showed the dogs wagging their tails because it seems really silly watching killer dogs wag their tail as they tear apart their delicious victims (and yes, I KNOW in reality quite often it appears like dogs are wagging their tails when they're actually eating at a dead body, but come on, the dogs in this movie are clearly happy).I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting pretty tired of generic horror movies starting off by showing teens partying and having fun.  It's such a boring, typical way to start a movie and it's *really* starting to get on my nerves.As for the story itself, well...mutated dogs vicious enough to bring down a human being weren't *quite* as vicious as you're led to believe.  The dogs are actually normal-sized, very ordinary looking dogs.  They should have been created MUCH bigger and badder than they ended up.  They still pack a mean punch despite their regular size however.The film contains a respectable amount of action and suspense, though you have to wait a good 30 minutes for things to pick up.Overall, extremely dangerous dogs located on some island in the middle of nowhere while teens try to find a way to escape is a nice storyline, though the film had some funny moments as well such as one scene where the teens throw a dead dog outside in the yard of their cabin, a pack of wild dogs come up and start eating the dead mut, and the teens hurry back inside.  The teens really didn't NEED to hurry back inside during this particular moment since the vicious dogs were distracted by the dead dog.  Also, the one teen that kept tripping over everything in the dark was clumsy as heck, and yet, he was laughing about it the entire time.  Come on, there's NOTHING to laugh about when hungry dogs are outside waiting to kill you.  And the girl who had these amazing athletic skills by flipping over cars and flipping up and down houses and barns like Spiderman to escape the dogs was supposed to be believable?  No way!Overall, I like the movie.",3,bad doggies,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,2421,"['Well', 'Breed', 'probably', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'basically', 'kill', 'teenagers', 'one', 'one', 'kind', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'number', 'slasher', 'films', 'out', 'there.One', 'thing', 'pretty', 'funny', 'when', 'dogs', 'were', 'attacking', 'teens', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'tell', 'dogs', 'were', 'happy', 'supposedly', 'tearing', 'people', 'apart', 'film', 'directors', 'should', 'have', 'cut', 'away', 'scenes', 'showed', 'dogs', 'wagging', 'tails', 'really', 'silly', 'watching', 'killer', 'dogs', 'wag', 'tail', 'tear', 'apart', 'delicious', 'victims', 'yes', 'KNOW', 'reality', 'quite', 'often', 'dogs', 'are', 'wagging', 'tails', 'when', ""'re"", 'actually', 'eating', 'dead', 'body', 'come', 'dogs', 'movie', 'are', 'clearly', 'happy', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guys', ""'m"", 'getting', 'pretty', 'tired', 'generic', 'horror', 'movies', 'starting', 'off', 'showing', 'teens', 'partying', 'having', 'fun', 'such', 'boring', 'typical', 'way', 'start', 'movie', '*really*', 'starting', 'get', 'nerves.As', 'story', 'well', 'mutated', 'dogs', 'vicious', 'enough', 'bring', 'down', 'human', 'being', 'were', ""n't"", '*quite*', 'as', 'vicious', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'dogs', 'are', 'actually', 'normal-sized', 'very', 'ordinary', 'looking', 'dogs', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'MUCH', 'bigger', 'badder', 'ended', 'up', 'still', 'pack', 'mean', 'punch', 'regular', 'size', 'however.The', 'film', 'respectable', 'amount', 'action', 'suspense', 'have', 'wait', 'good', '30', 'minutes', 'things', 'pick', 'up.Overall', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'dogs', 'located', 'island', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'teens', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'escape', 'nice', 'storyline', 'film', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'teens', 'throw', 'dead', 'dog', 'yard', 'cabin', 'pack', 'wild', 'dogs', 'come', 'up', 'start', 'eating', 'dead', 'mut', 'teens', 'hurry', 'back', 'inside', 'teens', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'NEED', 'hurry', 'back', 'inside', 'particular', 'moment', 'vicious', 'dogs', 'were', 'distracted', 'dead', 'dog', 'Also', 'one', 'teen', 'kept', 'tripping', 'over', 'everything', 'dark', 'was', 'clumsy', 'heck', 'yet', 'was', 'laughing', 'entire', 'time', 'Come', 'NOTHING', 'laugh', 'when', 'hungry', 'dogs', 'are', 'outside', 'waiting', 'kill', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'amazing', 'athletic', 'skills', 'flipping', 'cars', 'flipping', 'up', 'houses', 'barns', 'Spiderman', 'escape', 'dogs', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'believable', 'way', 'Overall', 'like', 'movie']",The Breed

998035,A210NI3I6Y4ZMO,B000G1ALDY,DV6740,"[1, 1]","First things first, after watching this movie I went to sleep and awoke with a fright from a nightmare which involved a ferocious canine snarling in my face, ready to attack. Glad I woke up. At that moment I said to myself, ""Damn, that movie had an effect."" Then I got up and made coffee.It's a fairly typical storyline with a common descriptive snippet, which reads like so many others I've read lately:""A group of (insert number here) friends (or college kids) venture off to a remote (island, wilderness cabin, lodge) and soon find that they (are not alone, must match wits with, or fall victim to) some (wild beast, monster, insane killer, demonic entity, or other life threatening scenario they are scarcely equipped to handle).""But hey, that's a horror movie.That said, it was a watchable film with some good tension, suspense, action and thrills, and also some nice bikini scenes. The editing was great, nice cuts, good timing, and creative dissolves, and the dog handlers had their hands busy. Great canine cast and excellent interaction and combat moments between human and dog. Truly some impressive stunts and action involving the dogs and people. That stuff can't be easy to just pull off so kudos to the crew for that.Character development is a little poor, I didn't find them all too convincing, but for the most part it worked well enough. Sometimes you just have to put aside such details and enjoy the films other good qualities.Wes Craven's name is on it but in my opinion it doesn't live up to the reputation of some of his classics.As a whole the film works okay, I'd probably watch it again and pick up on some things I may have missed, but it didn't peak my meter as far as horror films are concerned. As I mentioned the suspense is there -- although maybe short lived at times since the attacks and shocks are almost predictable -- but the horror is lacking a bit.You would expect a pack of marauding dogs to be a bit more persistent and savage, but maybe that is one plot point the writers are trying make... it is hinted that the dogs have a higher than average canine intelligence.There is a hint at possible clandestine research on the dogs, possibly performed at a facility located on the island, officially known for training seeing-eye dogs, but maybe something more sinister was going on behind the scenes. The place is now deserted and the dogs are running wild, so who knows. We're not given enough information or clues.We're also kind of led to believe that perhaps some mutated rabies virus has infected the dogs and was passed along to a couple of the humans because they begin exhibiting strange symptoms, almost sympathetic with the dogs.Those sub plots are lightly glanced over. They could have made for a more interesting film, but it is obvious the filmmakers were only focusing on the horror and suspense of people pitted against wild dogs, regardless of however those dogs may have became that way.Generally speaking it's a good film, well made, decent acting, directing, great camera work, editing, and great special effects too, but it seems to me that the loose ends remaining, with all the what if and what of, could have been tied together better to completely satisfy the audience.Worth the watch though, there are enough satisfying moments, suspense and thrills that make this a very entertaining film.",3,"Nice thrills, suspense, but a little thin on some plot elements.",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,3352,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'watching', 'movie', 'went', 'sleep', 'awoke', 'fright', 'nightmare', 'involved', 'ferocious', 'canine', 'snarling', 'face', 'ready', 'attack', 'Glad', 'woke', 'up', 'moment', 'said', 'myself', 'Damn', 'movie', 'had', 'effect', 'Then', 'got', 'up', 'made', 'coffee.It', 'fairly', 'typical', 'storyline', 'common', 'descriptive', 'snippet', 'so', 'many', 'others', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lately', 'group', 'insert', 'number', 'here', 'friends', 'college', 'kids', 'venture', 'remote', 'island', 'wilderness', 'cabin', 'lodge', 'soon', 'find', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'must', 'match', 'wits', 'fall', 'victim', 'wild', 'beast', 'monster', 'insane', 'killer', 'demonic', 'entity', 'other', 'life', 'threatening', 'scenario', 'are', 'scarcely', 'equipped', 'handle', 'hey', 'horror', 'movie.That', 'said', 'was', 'watchable', 'film', 'good', 'tension', 'suspense', 'action', 'thrills', 'also', 'nice', 'bikini', 'scenes', 'editing', 'was', 'great', 'nice', 'cuts', 'good', 'timing', 'creative', 'dissolves', 'dog', 'handlers', 'had', 'hands', 'busy', 'Great', 'canine', 'cast', 'excellent', 'interaction', 'combat', 'moments', 'human', 'dog', 'impressive', 'stunts', 'action', 'involving', 'dogs', 'people', 'stuff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'just', 'pull', 'off', 'so', 'kudos', 'crew', 'that.Character', 'development', 'little', 'poor', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'convincing', 'most', 'part', 'worked', 'well', 'enough', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'put', 'aside', 'such', 'details', 'enjoy', 'films', 'other', 'good', 'qualities.Wes', 'Craven', 'name', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'reputation', 'classics.As', 'whole', 'film', 'okay', ""'d"", 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'pick', 'up', 'things', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'did', ""n't"", 'peak', 'meter', 'as', 'far', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'concerned', 'mentioned', 'suspense', 'there', 'maybe', 'short', 'lived', 'times', 'attacks', 'shocks', 'are', 'almost', 'predictable', 'horror', 'lacking', 'bit.You', 'would', 'expect', 'pack', 'marauding', 'dogs', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'persistent', 'savage', 'maybe', 'one', 'plot', 'point', 'writers', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'hinted', 'dogs', 'have', 'higher', 'average', 'canine', 'hint', 'possible', 'clandestine', 'research', 'dogs', 'possibly', 'performed', 'facility', 'located', 'island', 'officially', 'known', 'training', 'seeing-eye', 'dogs', 'maybe', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'was', 'going', 'scenes', 'place', 'now', 'deserted', 'dogs', 'are', 'running', 'wild', 'so', 'who', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'information', 'clues.We', ""'re"", 'also', 'kind', 'led', 'believe', 'perhaps', 'mutated', 'rabies', 'virus', 'infected', 'dogs', 'was', 'passed', 'couple', 'humans', 'begin', 'exhibiting', 'strange', 'symptoms', 'almost', 'sympathetic', 'dogs.Those', 'sub', 'plots', 'are', 'lightly', 'glanced', 'over', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'obvious', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'only', 'focusing', 'horror', 'suspense', 'people', 'pitted', 'wild', 'dogs', 'regardless', 'however', 'dogs', 'may', 'have', 'became', 'way.Generally', 'speaking', 'good', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'decent', 'acting', 'directing', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'too', 'loose', 'ends', 'remaining', 'what', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tied', 'together', 'better', 'completely', 'satisfy', 'audience.Worth', 'watch', 'are', 'enough', 'satisfying', 'moments', 'suspense', 'thrills', 'make', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film']",The Breed
998036,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000G1ALDY,Jason,"[14, 15]","Not since Cujo has man's best friend become his worst enemy.  Whereas the previous attacks were caused by rabies, this time around it's the result of genetic engineering gone wrong.A group of young friends make their way to an isolated island where they expect to spend a wild time full of drinking, partying, and debauchery.  What they find instead is a large pack of vicious dogs protecting their island; or, as one character put it, ""scary-a@# lassies"" looking for food.  Although, one scene in which dogs are swimming after a person is completely hilarious, because we all know that in the water, human is far superior.  It would have just been a matter of holding breath, and drowning a few dogs.  As for real plot, it's simply Darwinian, survival of the fittest.I'm sure there is a morality lesson about playing God in there somewhere, but I didn't care and I hardly noticed.With nice special effects, production, cinematography, and pretty fair acting, it's what one would expect from a Wes Craven production.  The acting is particularly astute (especially the four-legged actors), and aside from Michelle Rodriguez, the cast is comprised of pretty good young actors who we've all seen before, but can't name.  Actually, the thing that's great about Rodriguez is crystal clear in this movie.  Even as a leading lady, she can't shake the ""tough"" chick persona.  I was waiting for her to snap a dog's spine over her knee during the entire movie.It has typical horror elements, like the moron who descends into the basement towards his demise - in this case genetically engineered, mutant dogs with a taste for human flesh - is waiting in the dark.  At times the idiocy makes you want to scream at the screen, ""Climb a tree genius!""

998040,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000G1ALDY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 6]","If you are worried that because this movies is called ""Wes Craven Presents 'The Breed'"" rather than simply ""The Breed"" that is a clear sign that this is not a good movie, then you are right.  To be fair, first-time director Nicholas Mastandrea has been the first assistant director on all three of Craven'sScream Trilogy, so you can understand Craven wanting to give his blessing to this project and what problems there are with ""The Breed"" (not to be confused with ""The Breed,"" a 2001 film set in a distant future where vampires try to live among regular folk as a special and peaceful breed) really has little to do with Mastandrea's work as a director.  When you put the DVD in the menu comes up and you see a young woman being menaced by what looks like a wolf, only this movie is about dogs and not wolves and none of the dogs look like the illustrated wolf.  So as I watched this movie, time and time again as different elements were worked into the film I kept thinking of other (better) films with the same elements (you want to see a wolf go after a pretty girl, check out ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""), and I knew that would be the motif of this review.""The Breed"" begins with a couple showing up at this deserted island in their sailboat.  Jenny (Lisa-Maire Schneider) goes exploring and quickly meets her fate while Luke (Nick Boraine) calls her name and gets no answer (a better ""getting off the sailboat is a big mistake"" movie would be  (Open Water 2: Adrift"").  Jump ahead to five twenty-somethings flying in a small plane to the same deserted island (well, if it was a different deserted island it would not make sense).  There are two brothers, John (Oliver Hudson, ""Black Christmas"") the black sheep and Matt (Eric Lively, ""The Butterfly Effect 2"") the good guy (""The Bible ... In the Beginning"" has the original bickering brothers, Cain and Abel).  Matt is interested in Sara (Taryn Manning, ""Crossroads""), while Matt is with Nicki (Michelle Rodriguez, ""Resident Eveil"").  Tagging along is fifth wheel Noah (Hill Harper, ""He Got Game""), who is so obviously going to be the first person to die you have to wonder if this is a nudge-nudge wink-wink to ""Scream.""  Anyhow, basically the people meet the dogs and then what passes for terror in this movie takes place.  The point where I was convinced the movie was going in the wrong direction was when Sara gets bit and not because the group fails to take the opportunity to get out while the getting out is good, but because once Sara starts to get affected by the bite she gets....sort of horny. (down, boys, there is no nudity in this film, only gratuitous cleavage).  The plot also involves using a bow-and-arrow (""The Adventures of Robin Hood""), trying to get a car to start(""Cujo""), and finding the lab where this all began (""The Lost World - Jurassic Park"").Now, you have to understand that when I was very little I was jumped on by a German shepherd and for the next twenty years or so of my life I was terrified of dogs (I see a dog and the dog would immediately smell fear).  So the thought of a pack of dogs coming after people should make me squirming.  When I was in high school there was a movie called ""The Doberman Gang,"" which was only about a gang using Dobermans to rob a bank, but damned if I was going to go see a movie with vicious dogs.  But as I watched ""The Breed"" what I was reminded of was not my irrational childhood fears but rather of one of my favorite bad B&W; B-Movie, ""The Killer Shrews,"" which had dogs wear rugs to play the giant killer shrews.  The plots of these two movies are quite similar: people come to island with vicious beasts created by mad scientists.  But ""The Killer Shrews"" has the virtue of Miss Universe 1957, Festus from ""Gunsmoke,"" and a bunch of dogs running around with carpets on them, so it is much more enjoyable than ""The Breed.""  So rent that instead of this one and avoid rolling your eyes or having to ugly laughter for 78 minutes.To be fair, it is not that these people are too stupid to live (""House of Wax""), but that the dogs have been genetically engineered so that they really are smarter than the humans on this island.  If for some reason all of these reviews do nothing to dissuade you and you rent this movie, I think you will be surprised at the body count (I am not saying this is a good thing or a bad thing), but if you are a fan of horror films then you will see the final shot coming from a gazillion miles away, a scene that earns a final laugh of derision.  But I did give this movie two stars for several good reasons.  First, it is not a snuff film, which would be a movie that earns a single star and singles that those responsible should be hunted down and disposed of in a similar manner.  Second, there is something to be said for a movie like this that wants to make do with 29 dogs (and 10 handlers) rather than CGI.  Third, there was a single scene I liked in the movie and got a legitimate laugh, when the two brothers are out for a drive.  The tone really does not fit the rest of the movie, but as you might suspect that is not a bad thing, which the rest of this movie most decidedly happens to be.",2,I can think of a whole bunch of

998041,A3OTY02A4YTBJ4,B000G1ALDY,L. Davis,"[0, 2]","This has got to be one of the cheesiest movies yet about slasher dogs. This is not even on the level of ""Cujo"". At least in Cugo he was a huge drooling creepy dog; all dirty, nasty, and bloody. Ew!!! Wouldn't want to run into that dog in a dark alley. And all it took was one Cujo to creep you out. The premise of the movie is: Five friends, three guys/two gals (Why do these slasher films always have more guys than girls?), make a trip to a remote island to drink, slum, and look sexy and then find out there are killer dogs on the island and try to evade the dogs and find a way to get off the island.  It's the usual slasher formula except it has dogs, real dogs. The acting in this movie is actually above par for a teen/slasher movie. The problem is the dogs. They just look too cute. There are a couple of scenes when the dogs with floppy ears tilt their head and give you that ""What's up?"" look, just too cute! The stunts are not believable because the dogs are not ferocious or scary looking. As in these usual slasher movies, the dog chews, ahem! I mean characters, make the dumbest mistakes throughout the movie. That's a given though in slasher movies. So it didn't bother me too much since I was expecting it. I was expecting the dogs to turn into werewolves or monster dogs. The poster/cover for this movie is really deceiving; it makes the dogs look much bigger and scarier than they are in the movie. I also expected the characters who were bitten to mutate into awesome ferocious dogs. That would have been the bomb! But no, no such thing. There was no development about what happens when the humans get bitten or what exactly happened to the dogs in the lab. There are no scenes of dead mutated dogs in the lab or dogs suspended in fluid or even grossly mutated dead pups. C'mon, couldn't the writer think of anything good? A real disapointment. This movie is not even scary. Good to watch to see some good dog acting and cute dogs but can see that on Animal Planet. This is definitely not a case the Xfiles would have investigated. Would have been too boring for Mulder.I watched it for free on Amazon Prime. There were some problems with distortion both on the laptop and on the Kindle Fire (1st gen). Also problems with streaming as it had to stop the movie twice for streaming which was not really a problem since there was no real climax or scary moments. If I had been watching Cujo, I would have been really annoyed with the streaming. Want to watch a movie about killer dogs? Watch Cujo. The Grey is also another good movie but not as scary as Cujo. If you can watch this movie for free, then try it out but don't go out of your way for this. Wait for it on cable or Amazon Prime.

It was pretty predictable and pretty much standard fare as members of the cast get picked off one by one by the creature(s) of the film.  Some die heroically as they sacrifice themselves for the rest of their group and some die just from being stupid in a horror movie.  The young people (I guess they are college students) are some of the brightest people I have have ever seen.  They are master electricians, mechanics and engineers.  A whole group of McGivers who can fix or alter any gadget available to do whatever is necessary at the time.  A very resourceful group.  Anyway these 5 land on this island where earlier 2 other people met their fates and they find that roaming the island is a union of dogs who are above average in intelligence and organization and who are also determined to wipe out any humans unfortunate to visit the island.  What this film comes down to is kind of a battle of wits between college students and dogs.  While hokey, this film was at least watchable.  There was one scene however that borders on unforgetable.  A wild dog is attacking one of the girls and one of our hero guys thinks he's Robin Hood, so he takes a bow and arrow to shoot the dog off the girl's leg.  This is filmed in slow motion, so that dog, girl and shooter can all take the time to watch the flight of the arrow, to the point where our shooter actually lowers the bow after he shoots so he can watch the shot.  The girl is then forever thankful that they never tried the apple on the head shot out of William Tell.  After this disasterous shot, the same guy then proceeds to quick aim and nail a dog leaping through the air.  Talk about improving your aim!!!  Anyway, I give this movie 2 stars.  I'm neutral on the acting.  Nothing great, but the actors really don't embarrass themselves either.  It's not a very good movie, but at least it can keep your attention for about an hour and a half.",2,Not making any dog jokes for a review title,1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,1951,"['First', 'all', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'fare', 'members', 'cast', 'get', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'creature', 's', 'film', 'die', 'heroically', 'sacrifice', 'rest', 'group', 'die', 'just', 'being', 'stupid', 'horror', 'movie', 'young', 'people', 'guess', 'are', 'college', 'students', 'are', 'brightest', 'people', 'have', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'master', 'electricians', 'mechanics', 'engineers', 'whole', 'group', 'McGivers', 'who', 'can', 'fix', 'alter', 'gadget', 'available', 'do', 'necessary', 'time', 'very', 'resourceful', 'group', 'Anyway', '5', 'land', 'island', 'where', 'earlier', '2', 'other', 'people', 'met', 'fates', 'find', 'roaming', 'island', 'union', 'dogs', 'who', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'intelligence', 'organization', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'determined', 'wipe', 'out', 'humans', 'unfortunate', 'visit', 'island', 'What', 'film', 'down', 'kind', 'battle', 'wits', 'college', 'students', 'dogs', 'hokey', 'film', 'was', 'least', 'watchable', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'however', 'borders', 'unforgetable', 'wild', 'dog', 'attacking', 'one', 'girls', 'one', 'hero', 'guys', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'bow', 'arrow', 'shoot', 'dog', 'girl', 'leg', 'filmed', 'slow', 'motion', 'dog', 'girl', 'shooter', 'can', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'flight', 'arrow', 'point', 'where', 'shooter', 'actually', 'bow', 'shoots', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'shot', 'girl', 'then', 'forever', 'thankful', 'never', 'tried', 'apple', 'head', 'shot', 'William', 'Tell', 'disasterous', 'shot', 'same', 'guy', 'then', 'quick', 'aim', 'nail', 'dog', 'leaping', 'air', 'Talk', 'improving', 'aim', 'Anyway', 'give', 'movie', '2', 'stars', ""'m"", 'neutral', 'acting', 'Nothing', 'great', 'actors', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'embarrass', 'either', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'least', 'can', 'keep', 'attention', 'hour', 'half']",The Breed

But it is really well done.  A lot of horror movies in the 70's were not necessarily by the numbers, genre pictures.  They were dramatic movies with a few horrific elements thrown in.

998052,A387BD735MI50R,B000G1ALDY,R. Schultz,"[9, 9]","This movie was better than I expected it would be. The script allowed for some genuine character development. The 20's-somethings who gather on this remote island for a weekend vacation are given a range of sympathetic qualities, some stake in life - so we care about their fates.It's the dogs who are the real stars of this show though. The close-ups of their intent brown eyes draw you into the canine mind. The producers/director of this film prided themselves on the fact that no computer-generated graphics were used. All the dogs in action are real dogs. Some dogs were Hollywood veterans imported to the site of the film shoot (which was South Africa) with their trainers; others were local dogs enlisted and trained on the spot.The reasons given for the dogs' aggression in the movie are unfortunately muddled - a defect in the plot line. On the one hand, the young people discover that these dogs are the result of some genetic engineering that seemed to have been wrought on the dogs' ancestors. But on the other hand, people who are bitten by the dogs soon develop some strange illness, a malaise spotted with outbreaks of rage. This would suggest a viral or bacterial infection that isn't quite rabies, but that threatens to be a fatal biological time-bomb nonetheless. We are almost led to suspect a transmission of werewolf tendencies, recreating Lon Chaney's Jr.'s frequent film fate.As impressive as the dogs frequently are, they could have been used to greater effect. Their attacks are too sudden and predictable. There is none of the slowly gathering menace found in ""The Birds.""Also, one of the characters is made to pronounce the all-too-trite indictment of any meddling with nature. To the extent that an eccentric uncle's genetic engineering is held responsible for these dogs' temperaments, he receives the ultimate reproof - ""He was trying to play God!"" Oh, if only once biological tinkering was allowed to result in something other than a tragic lesson against hubris.This DVD doesn't have any Director's Commentary on it, which was a little disappointing. Since horror mavens Wes Craven and Nick Mastandrea were both involved in the making of this film, it would have been informative to hear their tag-along philosophizing about the genre.However, there is an interesting extra showing how the dogs were trained and made to appear to be crunching into their victims. Hardly any of the human stars of this movie were left unscathed by the rehearsals or actual filmings. The dogs sometimes missed their decoy targets and chomped into real flesh. So the attacks you see are often more fact than fiction.Overall, this movie probably won't be one of the most memorable you'll ever watch, but it does have some bite to it.",3,"Not Best In Show, But Not Bad",1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,2744,"['movie', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'script', 'allowed', 'genuine', 'character', 'development', ""20's-somethings"", 'who', 'gather', 'remote', 'island', 'weekend', 'vacation', 'are', 'given', 'range', 'sympathetic', 'qualities', 'stake', 'life', 'care', 'fates.It', 'dogs', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'close-ups', 'intent', 'eyes', 'draw', 'canine', 'mind', 'producers/director', 'film', 'prided', 'fact', 'computer-generated', 'graphics', 'were', 'used', 'dogs', 'action', 'are', 'real', 'dogs', 'dogs', 'were', 'Hollywood', 'veterans', 'imported', 'site', 'film', 'shoot', 'was', 'South', 'Africa', 'trainers', 'others', 'were', 'local', 'dogs', 'enlisted', 'trained', 'spot.The', 'reasons', 'given', 'dogs', 'aggression', 'movie', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'muddled', 'defect', 'plot', 'line', 'one', 'hand', 'young', 'people', 'discover', 'dogs', 'are', 'result', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'wrought', 'dogs', 'ancestors', 'other', 'hand', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'bitten', 'dogs', 'soon', 'develop', 'strange', 'illness', 'malaise', 'spotted', 'outbreaks', 'rage', 'would', 'suggest', 'viral', 'bacterial', 'infection', ""n't"", 'quite', 'rabies', 'be', 'fatal', 'biological', 'time-bomb', 'nonetheless', 'are', 'almost', 'led', 'suspect', 'transmission', 'werewolf', 'tendencies', 'recreating', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'frequent', 'film', 'fate.As', 'impressive', 'dogs', 'frequently', 'are', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'greater', 'effect', 'attacks', 'are', 'too', 'sudden', 'predictable', 'none', 'slowly', 'gathering', 'menace', 'found', 'Birds', 'Also', 'one', 'characters', 'made', 'pronounce', 'all-too-trite', 'indictment', 'meddling', 'nature', 'extent', 'eccentric', 'uncle', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'held', 'responsible', 'dogs', 'temperaments', 'ultimate', 'reproof', 'was', 'trying', 'play', 'God', 'Oh', 'only', 'once', 'biological', 'tinkering', 'was', 'allowed', 'result', 'something', 'other', 'tragic', 'lesson', 'hubris.This', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'horror', 'mavens', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Nick', 'Mastandrea', 'were', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'informative', 'hear', 'tag-along', 'philosophizing', 'genre.However', 'interesting', 'extra', 'showing', 'how', 'dogs', 'were', 'trained', 'made', 'appear', 'be', 'crunching', 'victims', 'Hardly', 'human', 'stars', 'movie', 'were', 'left', 'unscathed', 'rehearsals', 'actual', 'filmings', 'dogs', 'sometimes', 'missed', 'decoy', 'targets', 'chomped', 'real', 'flesh', 'attacks', 'see', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'fact', 'fiction.Overall', 'movie', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'watch', 'have', 'bite']",The Breed

998054,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000G1ALDY,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 4]","Dogs - those lovable, tail-wagging, stick-fetching, ruff'n'tumble quadrupeds who are one of our most frequent animal companions on this planet - can be fairly scary in real life if they're ticked off at you and snarling like a Harley Davidson engine trying to turn over; but making them genuinely scary in movies and other tales has often been a tough task.  Maybe it's just too easy to envision a big lovable goof of a german shepherd growling and stalking on cue like he's been trained to, but then reverting to chasing his tale or pestering for doggie biscuits as soon as he knows his performance is over, but the fright factor doesn't usually work with dogs like it does their cousins the wolves, or with various reptiles.  Usually, anyway.  ""The Breed"" is one of the few that's succeeded.  The canines here are cunning, big, aggressive and fast, and not at all hard to believe could be produced by a mean-spirited breeding program using conventional, non-futuristic, steroids.It's five friends vacationing on an island where a reclusive uncle (recently deceased) kept a nice beach house, who encounter the Breed, descendants of an old secert program at a complex (apparantly government-owned or sponsored) on the other side of the island.  There are vague clues that there may have been people suspicious about what was really going on at the compound, but nothing definate.  ""The Breed"" doesn't go indepth into the backstory, preferring to drop in a kind of broad opening into the Breed's origins and let viewers draw their own conclusions. Another intriguing area where the movie doesn't spell out exactly what's happening - and thus preserves a good aura of mystery - is the unusual 'link' that forms between surviving victims of the pack and the dogs themselves.  Having already established the dogs as realistic, it adds in something very strange but keeps it feeling real, making it more eerie and enhancing the whole movie. ""The Breed"" takes its time building into the man vs. beast action, creates genuine tension, and is largely devoid of improbable 'near-superhuman toughness and feats'.  One exception that's easily noted is the wound one of the characters receives early on, that certainly wasn't fatal, but that after the initial incident and subsequent treatment, doesn't seem to affect the character as much as it should.  You could still have her/him (I don't want to indicate which character it was) running about and such, but give a really pronounced limp to it when they're running along.  It's not a terrible mistake, but since I'm  praising the movie for being so believable, I thought I'd also mention the part where I thought it lacked a bit on that front.  Back on the positive side, the movie holds up with its thrills and effectiveness right through to the end, whereas some movies like this crumble quite a bit at the climax.With a talented cast, (including Michelle Rodriguez from ""Resident Evil"", ""BloodRayne"" and ""Lost""), a nice island setting, extremely effective action sequences and well-done special effects, ""The Breed"" is a credit to the 'lethal animals' subgenre of horror.

It is your standard ""us against it"" genre and with little new elements or cleverness; therefore, one naturally feels let down with this effort.  Had Wes Craven been actively involved with this film, I know it would have been better than it was.On the plus side the actors, mostly familiar faces, are quite good and do the best with the material they are given.  In fact, even with little introduction to these characters, I found myself generally liking them and feeling sorry for each one as they get picked off.  That's pretty good for a direct-to-DVD film, and I'm not spoiling anything here as that is par for the course in this genre.The script isn't too bad and these characters utter things we would actually expect them to say in this situation.  There is appropriate levity when things seem dark and the characters appear to have a real history as they interact with each other.  It doesn't feel forced at all.So, where do things go wrong?  Well, it's just that we've seen this story before and done better.  A genre is created for good reason, and that is that we like a certain ""type"" of story, but that doesn't mean an entry in a given genre shouldn't add to the genre, or have original ideas and twists, or something generally new to offer.  This film offers nothing original, twisted, or new.  Yes, the acting and script are pretty good, but nothing mesmerizing.

I found it to be fairly enjoyable. Granted, some of the dialog was insipid and some of the characters really did deserve to be chewed on by wild dogs, but I felt that (unlike most horror movies) the cast's actions and reactions were reasonable. The acting was better than average for this genre, the story was interesting, and the dog scenes were quite impressive considering that (despite some misinformation in other reviews) there was no CGI involved. They actually relied on well-trained attack dogs to perform all the stunts. Judging from my cat's growling and hissing, the dog's acting was exceptional. Also, for us animal lovers, be sure to view the special features to see the clever ways they avoided hurting any of the dogs during the filming. It seems that some of the actors actually did get chewed on, but at least the dogs were safe.Some reviewers suffer from critical snobbery. They are anxious to find fault in films to convince us of their sophistication. Let's face it, this movie isn't going to end up on Roger Ebert's top ten list, but it definitely deserves more than one or two stars. Save your scathing reviews for really awful films like The Green River Killer.

998058,A1FF2NJKKF4BPZ,B000G1ALDY,TidesManian Devil,"[3, 9]","The Breed is just plain awful! There is not a single scary or creepy scene in the entire film, but there are annoyances aplenty.  In this sense one is reminded of teen slasher films of the 80s in which you wanted every last one of the characters to get killed off because you couldn't stand any of them.  That's pretty much what we have here. I didn't cringe but cheered as each character met their demise.  Sadly three survived, but there is hope that perhaps they didn't as you'll see in the ending.Here is a summary of annoyances that stuck out the most:-as mentioned, the dogs are not the least bit menacing.  I saw much more tail wagging then teeth gnarling.  The back of the dvd cover also implies that there were perhaps hundreds of dogs.  Not!  I don't think I ever saw more than a pack of 5 at most at one time.-Michelle Rodriguez takes an arrow through the leg by our less than accurate archery man early in the film in a particularly ludicrous sequence.  We are then cut to a scene where the gang is to remove the arrow.  But Rodriguez is much too calm and cool as she is cracking jokes and saying matter of factly, ""I guess this is going to hurt"" right before the arrow is to be pulled out.-the bow and arrow guy climbs up on a radio tower later in the film.  While up there he falls at least 20 or 30 feet and lands on his back.  This fall not only doesn't kill him, it doesn't even faze him as he jumps right up and runs away unscathed.-the last remaining girl (I won't spoil it) opens a gas line and uses a lighter to basically blow the building she and several of the dogs are in to kingdom come.  She has sacrifed herself to kill a handful of these dogs for the benefit of the remaining 2 survivors we think as the scene cuts to a shot of the outside of the building she was in that is now engulfed in flames.  Inexplicably, however, she shows up in the next scene driving the car.  She is completed unscathed and untouched.  Not so much as a scratch on her.  Not only that, but her demeanor is not the least bit affected by the supposed trauma she has just endured.  She just cooly tells the guys to hop in as if they were all out on the town on a Saturday night and headed to the soda shop.-lastly, the car flying off the dock was the ultimate jump the shark moment for me even if everything else is overlooked.  At that point, as we watch the car going into the water, I started laughing so hard I almost came to tears - certainly not the intention of the director.  It was just so ridiculous and over the top, and such a lame attempt at a climatic ending that failed so utterly bad.To to summarize: at no point was I scared; at no point did I care about these people; at several points I was annoyed; and during one final climatic scene I laughed uncontrollably.",1,A Dog of a Flick!,1180656000,"06 1, 2007",2007,2783,"['Breed', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'not', 'single', 'scary', 'creepy', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'annoyances', 'aplenty', 'sense', 'one', 'reminded', 'teen', 'slasher', 'films', '80s', 'wanted', 'last', 'one', 'characters', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'cringe', 'cheered', 'character', 'met', 'demise', 'Sadly', 'three', 'survived', 'hope', 'perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'see', 'ending.Here', 'summary', 'annoyances', 'stuck', 'out', 'most', '-as', 'mentioned', 'dogs', 'are', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'menacing', 'saw', 'much', 'more', 'tail', 'wagging', 'then', 'gnarling', 'back', 'dvd', 'cover', 'also', 'were', 'perhaps', 'hundreds', 'dogs', 'Not', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'saw', 'more', 'pack', '5', 'most', 'one', 'time.-Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'arrow', 'leg', 'less', 'accurate', 'archery', 'man', 'early', 'film', 'particularly', 'ludicrous', 'sequence', 'are', 'then', 'cut', 'scene', 'where', 'gang', 'remove', 'arrow', 'Rodriguez', 'much', 'too', 'calm', 'cool', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'saying', 'matter', 'factly', 'guess', 'going', 'hurt', 'right', 'arrow', 'be', 'pulled', 'out.-the', 'bow', 'arrow', 'guy', 'up', 'radio', 'tower', 'later', 'film', 'least', '20', '30', 'feet', 'lands', 'back', 'fall', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'kill', ""n't"", 'even', 'faze', 'right', 'up', 'runs', 'away', 'unscathed.-the', 'last', 'remaining', 'girl', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'gas', 'line', 'lighter', 'basically', 'blow', 'building', 'several', 'dogs', 'are', 'kingdom', 'come', 'sacrifed', 'kill', 'handful', 'dogs', 'benefit', 'remaining', '2', 'survivors', 'think', 'scene', 'cuts', 'shot', 'outside', 'building', 'was', 'now', 'engulfed', 'flames', 'Inexplicably', 'however', 'up', 'next', 'scene', 'driving', 'car', 'completed', 'unscathed', 'untouched', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'scratch', 'Not', 'only', 'demeanor', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'affected', 'supposed', 'trauma', 'just', 'endured', 'just', 'cooly', 'guys', 'hop', 'as', 'were', 'out', 'town', 'Saturday', 'night', 'headed', 'soda', 'shop.-lastly', 'car', 'flying', 'off', 'dock', 'was', 'ultimate', 'jump', 'shark', 'moment', 'even', 'everything', 'else', 'overlooked', 'point', 'watch', 'car', 'going', 'water', 'started', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'almost', 'came', 'tears', 'certainly', 'not', 'intention', 'director', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'top', 'lame', 'attempt', 'climatic', 'ending', 'failed', 'so', 'utterly', 'bad.To', 'summarize', 'point', 'was', 'scared', 'point', 'did', 'care', 'people', 'several', 'points', 'was', 'annoyed', 'one', 'final', 'climatic', 'scene', 'laughed', 'uncontrollably']",The Breed
998059,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000G1ALDY,trebe,"[1, 1]","The Breed (2006) is a pretty effective animal attacks type thriller, where a pack of wild genetically engineered dogs, terrorizes a group on vacation on a remote island.  The story gets whacky in places, but not excessively so, as mostly real dogs appear to have been used throughout the film.Brothers John (Oliver Hudson) and Matt (Eric Lively) have inherited a cabin on a huge island, and are flying there in a seaplane, along with some of their friends, for a weekend of fun.  Also in the party is Sara (Taryn Manning), Noah (Hill Harper), and Matt's girlfriend Nicki (Michelle Rodriguez).The group settles in and is having a great time, when a puppy unexpectedly shows up at the cabin.  Night falls, and when the young pup runs out of the house, Sara and John go out to look for him, and are surprised when a huge dog appears, and sinks its teeth into Sara's leg.  Matt patches up Sara's wound, but while out in the woods the next day, the guys witness a man being attacked by several dogs.  Running back to the cabin, the group is followed by a pack of nasty canines.  A dog has Nicki's leg in his jaws, so Matt fires an arrow at the beast, but unfortunately his aim is off, and the arrow sinks into Nicki's calf.  Barricaded in the cabin, with dogs surrounding them, the vacationers realize that they are in a battle for their lives.The Breed nicely introduces its characters, clues you into their interpersonal history, and then flows along pretty briskly, once the dogs arrive and start to get frisky.  The attack scenes with the dogs are staged well, nicely featuring the animals and the actual actors (at least some of the time).  The film is heavy on the jump scares, and the music and the sound of dogs growling, is cranked way up during the attacks, to make things more dramatic.  Still, there are enough legitimate action scenes to generate some excitement, including a one nasty double impalement.  Bad leg and all, Nicki's athletic talents are put to the test, and she delivers the film's best one liner, ""Give Cujo my best"", just before setting off an explosion.The films has many flaws, as the characters attempt some completely idiotic stunts, the story is loaded with junk science, and the geography of the ""island"" is completely unbelievable, but these kind of things are not completely unexpected in a B-movie like this.  With passable acting, and characters that are mostly likeable, The Breed is a pretty entertaining thriller, if you let a few things pass.
