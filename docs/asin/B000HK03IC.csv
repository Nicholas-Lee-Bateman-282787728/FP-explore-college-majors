1015006,A3B1QVMBW7YVOQ,B000HK03IC,C. J. Hardman,"[23, 25]","Being a railroad conductor and generally a fan of snakes, I simply couldn't resist picking up ""Snakes on a Train"" for a depraved 2-day weekend reserved for lazing on the couch, quaffing copious amount of Dr. Pepper, inhaling chocolate, and thinking occasionally about the chores I should be doing.  The gal at the check-out counter of my local dvd rental establishment gave me a dubious look and inquired, ""You do know this isn't 'Snakes on a Plane'?""  Yes, I knew.  Apparently some individuals who couldn't read and can't tell a locomotive from a plane had rented it with higher expectations.  I however was willing to take a chance, and wasn't expecting a masterpiece.It's entertainment.  Hardly the worst I've seen (not as vapid as ""Murdercycle""), but not close to ""The Shining"", or say the more recent ""Jeepers Creepers"".  The plot centers around a Mexican Indian woman cursed by her own family for rejecting a wealthy suitor...the village shaman she chose instead accompanies her across the USA/Mexico border to a Southern Pacific train depot (yes, the SP of days gone by) where they coax thuggish stowaways in the baggage car into allowing them to board.Character development is weak, about on par with what you can find on late-night cable or the old USA Network productions from the late '80's through the '90's.  Remember the flick with those slug-things that got inside people? Shades of that.  Then again, If I wanted character development I would have gotten something boring and sentimental :)  My major complaint is that there could have been a lot more spoofing and humor in this.  About the funniest part was when the shaman runs over the top of the cars, finds the locomotive engineer smoking ~something~ out of a lightbulb, knocks him out a smashes up the engine's console--or what set crew thinks an audience will believe will pass for a locomotive's control console.  I caught a glimpse of a picture which looked like it might have been the engineer and conductor laying down together shirtless...which really is neither here nor there, but provided the one laugh in a film offered numerous ripe opportunities for parody.  The Conductor apparently forgets where the energency brake valve is and has some kind of breakdown...so when he is eaten by a snake, I didn't feel too bad.  Incompetence!Of the snakes, plenty of Ball pythons (even an albino!), Boas and garter snakes...and waaay too much rattling for any of those.  But I digress.  There were some darkened shots of long-haul Amtrak passenger trains with Superliner equipment...and despite this, Amtrak (not to mention the Union Pacific, which owns the rights to the SP logo) did not appear in the credits.  The crappy interiors of the crappy coaches used in this film date to the 1940's and thank goodness, are not used by Amtrak :o  On second thought, It is probably a good thing Amtrak wasn't credited in any way for this production.So...to the frat boys and beer-blast entheusiasts, this is a good one to have on during rauccous gatherings when nobody is quite sure what is happening.  And for railroaders on their off days...hey, you could do worse!  Better to watch than work, right? ;)",2,Someone Pull the Emergency Brake!,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,3168,"['Being', 'railroad', 'conductor', 'generally', 'fan', 'snakes', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'picking', 'up', 'Snakes', 'Train', 'depraved', '2-day', 'weekend', 'reserved', 'lazing', 'couch', 'quaffing', 'copious', 'amount', 'Dr.', 'Pepper', 'inhaling', 'chocolate', 'thinking', 'occasionally', 'chores', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'gal', 'check-out', 'counter', 'local', 'dvd', 'rental', 'establishment', 'gave', 'dubious', 'look', 'inquired', 'do', 'know', ""n't"", ""'Snakes"", 'Plane', 'Yes', 'knew', 'Apparently', 'individuals', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'read', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'locomotive', 'plane', 'had', 'rented', 'higher', 'expectations', 'however', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'chance', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'masterpiece.It', 'entertainment', 'Hardly', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'as', 'vapid', 'Murdercycle', 'not', 'close', 'Shining', 'say', 'more', 'recent', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'plot', 'centers', 'Mexican', 'Indian', 'woman', 'cursed', 'own', 'family', 'rejecting', 'wealthy', 'suitor', 'village', 'shaman', 'chose', 'instead', 'USA/Mexico', 'border', 'Southern', 'Pacific', 'train', 'depot', 'yes', 'SP', 'days', 'gone', 'where', 'coax', 'thuggish', 'stowaways', 'baggage', 'car', 'allowing', 'board.Character', 'development', 'weak', 'about', 'par', 'what', 'can', 'find', 'late-night', 'cable', 'old', 'USA', 'Network', 'productions', 'late', ""'80"", ""'90"", 'Remember', 'flick', 'slug-things', 'got', 'people', 'Shades', 'Then', 'again', 'wanted', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'something', 'boring', 'sentimental', 'major', 'complaint', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'spoofing', 'humor', 'funniest', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'shaman', 'top', 'cars', 'locomotive', 'engineer', 'smoking', 'lightbulb', 'out', 'smashes', 'engine', 'console', 'what', 'set', 'crew', 'thinks', 'audience', 'will', 'believe', 'will', 'pass', 'locomotive', 'control', 'console', 'caught', 'glimpse', 'picture', 'looked', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'engineer', 'conductor', 'laying', 'down', 'together', 'shirtless', 'really', 'here', 'there', 'provided', 'one', 'laugh', 'film', 'offered', 'numerous', 'ripe', 'opportunities', 'parody', 'Conductor', 'apparently', 'where', 'energency', 'brake', 'valve', 'kind', 'breakdown', 'so', 'when', 'eaten', 'snake', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'bad', 'Incompetence', 'snakes', 'plenty', 'Ball', 'pythons', 'even', 'albino', 'Boas', 'garter', 'snakes', 'waaay', 'too', 'much', 'rattling', 'digress', 'were', 'darkened', 'shots', 'long-haul', 'Amtrak', 'passenger', 'trains', 'Superliner', 'equipment', 'Amtrak', 'not', 'mention', 'Union', 'Pacific', 'rights', 'SP', 'logo', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'credits', 'crappy', 'interiors', 'crappy', 'coaches', 'used', 'film', 'date', '1940', 'thank', 'goodness', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'Amtrak', 'o', 'second', 'thought', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'Amtrak', 'was', ""n't"", 'credited', 'way', 'production.So', 'frat', 'boys', 'beer-blast', 'entheusiasts', 'good', 'one', 'have', 'rauccous', 'gatherings', 'when', 'nobody', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'happening', 'railroaders', 'off', 'days', 'hey', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'Better', 'watch', 'work', 'right']",Snakes on a Train

1015008,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000HK03IC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Sweet Lord in Heaven, this movie is awful.  The Asylum has released more than its share of bad movies, but Snakes on a Train may well be the worst of the lot.  You could argue that Snakes on a Plane (which I actually enjoyed) was itself a B-movie, so this Asylum knockoff is C-grade at best.  There is not one single thing positive I can say about this cinematic disaster.  The script is terrible, the acting is annoyingly bad, and the special effects are unbelievably, embarrassingly pitiful.  I also must point out that the DVD cover contains blatant lies: there aren't anywhere close to 3,000 snakes in this movie - more like a few dozen - and the entire cast can't include more than 20 people (certainly not ""100 trapped passengers"").  That ""trapped"" business is a hard sell, anyway, because you can jump off a moving train and survive.  Some of these characters, though, are afraid to jump down from the train when it isn't even moving because ""it's too far!""  Really?  What is it - two feet down at the most?  Give me a freaking break.So how do these snakes get on the train to begin with?  Well, some Mexican girl ran off with her boyfriend rather than marrying the high-class fellow her family had picked out for her, so someone in that family cursed her.  Now she has gobs of snakes slithering around inside her body - and she keeps puking them up.  That's actually a bad thing because the snakes are a part of her now and she can't live without them.  Thanks to this ridiculous storyline, we're forced to watch scene after scene of her medicine man boyfriend chanting some kind of hoodoo voodoo stuff.  It just keeps going on and on and on, even though it's obvious that these ""spells"" aren't working.  The other thing about these snakes is that they seem to grow exponentially in size after they're barfed up, so it's only a matter of time before the other people on the train are being attacked by horrible CGI effects.  There's a subplot or two among the other passengers, but who really cares?  I didn't give two spits in the ocean about anybody in this movie.You will think this movie is terrible as you watch it progress, but only those who suffer through to the very end will know the true depth of its awfulness.  This one goes down hard, people - I suggest you give Snakes On a Train a very wide berth.",1,Viewers should be compensated for their pain and suffering from watching this film,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,2321,"['Sweet', 'Lord', 'Heaven', 'movie', 'awful', 'Asylum', 'released', 'more', 'share', 'bad', 'movies', 'Snakes', 'Train', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'worst', 'lot', 'could', 'argue', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'B-movie', 'Asylum', 'knockoff', 'C-grade', 'best', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'thing', 'positive', 'can', 'say', 'cinematic', 'disaster', 'script', 'terrible', 'acting', 'annoyingly', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'embarrassingly', 'pitiful', 'also', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'DVD', 'cover', 'blatant', 'lies', 'are', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'close', '3,000', 'snakes', 'movie', 'more', 'few', 'dozen', 'entire', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'include', 'more', '20', 'people', 'certainly', 'not', '100', 'trapped', 'passengers', 'trapped', 'business', 'hard', 'sell', 'anyway', 'can', 'jump', 'off', 'moving', 'train', 'survive', 'characters', 'are', 'afraid', 'jump', 'down', 'train', 'when', ""n't"", 'even', 'moving', 'too', 'far', 'Really', 'What', 'two', 'feet', 'down', 'most', 'Give', 'freaking', 'break.So', 'how', 'do', 'snakes', 'get', 'train', 'begin', 'Well', 'Mexican', 'girl', 'ran', 'off', 'boyfriend', 'rather', 'marrying', 'high-class', 'family', 'had', 'picked', 'out', 'someone', 'family', 'cursed', 'Now', 'gobs', 'snakes', 'slithering', 'body', 'puking', 'up', 'actually', 'bad', 'thing', 'snakes', 'are', 'part', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'Thanks', 'ridiculous', 'storyline', ""'re"", 'forced', 'watch', 'scene', 'scene', 'medicine', 'man', 'boyfriend', 'chanting', 'kind', 'hoodoo', 'voodoo', 'stuff', 'just', 'going', 'even', 'obvious', 'spells', 'are', ""n't"", 'working', 'other', 'thing', 'snakes', 'seem', 'grow', 'exponentially', 'size', ""'re"", 'barfed', 'up', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'other', 'people', 'train', 'are', 'being', 'attacked', 'horrible', 'CGI', 'effects', 'subplot', 'two', 'other', 'passengers', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'two', 'spits', 'ocean', 'anybody', 'movie.You', 'will', 'think', 'movie', 'terrible', 'watch', 'progress', 'only', 'who', 'suffer', 'very', 'end', 'will', 'know', 'true', 'depth', 'awfulness', 'one', 'down', 'hard', 'people', 'suggest', 'give', 'Snakes', 'Train', 'very', 'wide', 'berth']",Snakes on a Train

Bereft of any sort of redeemable qualities, Snakes on a Train is a cheap knock off, the cinematic equivalent of an ambulance chasing attorney.The plot centers around an illegal alien named Alma and her friend/lover/whatever named Brujo - a clever usage of Spanish for the ignorant white viewers - on their way via train to Los Angeles to see Brujo's relative who can cure Alma of her illness.  A little thing about snakes coming out her various orifices alongside green jello and/or black sludge.  Snakes that look like garter snakes but are deadly venomous within seconds and have the ability burrow into human skin on their way to the heart.  It's cool though, because Brujo can take out a heart faster than that dude on Temple of Doom.Actually, I take it back.  There really isn't anything cool at all about this movie.  The snakes are lame and smaller than advertised, the worst gunfight ever caught on film is thrown in for no reason, and the bad actors portraying irritating characters (read: all of them) didn't die quickly or gruesomely enough.  The rules for these movies are simple: boobs and deaths.

Some larger snakes appeared later in the movie.

1015020,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000HK03IC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Snakes on a Train (Peter Mervis, 2006)I originally assumed this was yet another Snakes on a Plane ripoff until I started reading trivia about the movie on various websites. Now, I can't verify this, but it has been said that this was actually going to be the official sequel to one of the strangest movies to get a theatrical release in America in the past decade. Having now watched it, I can understand why the studio ended up disowning it (note I'm making an assumption there); of all the Snakes on a Plane knockoffs I've seen, this is easily the worst. I can think of half a dozen films that would have actually made great sequels to the movie, or were at least good enough to merit a theatrical release. And then there is this.Plot: Alma (Julia Ruiz, whose only previous experience is playing ""Office Hottie"" in a TV-movie) has a small problem. She's had a curse placed on her by a brujo (The DaVinci Treasure's A. J. Castro) on her way out of town. She's one of a handful of folks being smuggled on a train, you see. She and the others are in the hold of a rather luxurious passenger train, with a mix of people that looks oddly familiar. And I'm sure I don't need to tell you what the curse is, given the name of the movie.I'm not going to tell you that this movie is bad because it travels the same basic path as its predecessor. I mean, let's face it, where can you really go when your premise is Snakes on a ___? I expected that. What I didn't expect was that when the budget was (presumably) slashed, every last dollar of the money that was lost seems to have been slated to go to the special effects. One of the things that makes the original movie (and such higher-quality knockoffs as Flight of the Living Dead) so much fun is that the effects are so stupidly over-the-top that you can't help but laugh, and you know the guys who made the movie are laughing with you. But oh, my, we're not laughing with the filmmakers when we're watching these effects. It doesn't help that the acting sets the bar even lower than the original movie did (let's face it, the original was Samuel L. and a bunch of people who couldn't act their collective way out of a paper bag), the pace gives us no tension whatsoever during the setup, and the movie sounds as if the microphones were in the next room.I'm not going to try and revise my judgment of the film because of my disappointment that this is the sequel to Snakes on a Plane. I'd probably give it a higher rating were it just another bad knockoff. But it's not, and the disappointment is that much greater. * ",2,I wept.,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,2563,"['Snakes', 'Train', 'Peter', 'Mervis', '2006', 'originally', 'assumed', 'was', 'yet', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'ripoff', 'started', 'reading', 'trivia', 'movie', 'various', 'websites', 'Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'verify', 'been', 'said', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'be', 'official', 'sequel', 'one', 'strangest', 'movies', 'get', 'theatrical', 'release', 'America', 'past', 'decade', 'Having', 'now', 'watched', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'studio', 'ended', 'up', 'disowning', 'note', ""'m"", 'making', 'assumption', 'there', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'knockoffs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'easily', 'worst', 'can', 'think', 'dozen', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'made', 'great', 'sequels', 'movie', 'were', 'least', 'good', 'enough', 'merit', 'theatrical', 'release', 'then', 'this.Plot', 'Alma', 'Julia', 'Ruiz', 'only', 'previous', 'experience', 'playing', 'Office', 'Hottie', 'TV-movie', 'small', 'problem', 'had', 'curse', 'placed', 'brujo', 'DaVinci', 'Treasure', 'A.', 'J.', 'Castro', 'way', 'town', 'one', 'handful', 'folks', 'being', 'smuggled', 'train', 'see', 'others', 'are', 'hold', 'rather', 'luxurious', 'passenger', 'train', 'mix', 'people', 'oddly', 'familiar', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'what', 'curse', 'given', 'name', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'movie', 'bad', 'same', 'basic', 'path', 'predecessor', 'mean', 'let', 'face', 'where', 'can', 'really', 'go', 'when', 'premise', 'Snakes', '___', 'expected', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'when', 'budget', 'was', 'presumably', 'slashed', 'last', 'dollar', 'money', 'was', 'lost', 'have', 'been', 'slated', 'go', 'special', 'effects', 'One', 'things', 'original', 'movie', 'such', 'higher-quality', 'knockoffs', 'Flight', 'Living', 'Dead', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'stupidly', 'over-the-top', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'know', 'guys', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'are', 'laughing', 'oh', ""'re"", 'not', 'laughing', 'filmmakers', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'effects', ""n't"", 'help', 'acting', 'bar', 'even', 'lower', 'original', 'movie', 'did', 'let', 'face', 'original', 'was', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'bunch', 'people', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'collective', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'pace', 'tension', 'whatsoever', 'setup', 'movie', 'microphones', 'were', 'next', 'room.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'try', 'revise', 'judgment', 'film', 'disappointment', 'sequel', 'Snakes', 'Plane', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'higher', 'rating', 'were', 'just', 'bad', 'knockoff', 'not', 'disappointment', 'much', 'greater', '*']",Snakes on a Train
