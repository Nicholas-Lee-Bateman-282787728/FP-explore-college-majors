370100,A13RNON4R3QZGF,6303342787,aspen_matthews,"[0, 1]","One Day, Ryunosuke is out with his father when he finds a cat and asks his father if he can keep it.  Kyusaku (dad) can hardly say no before they are attacked by a hi tech helicopter.  They take off, and the chase is on.  By the time the chase is over and their car is wrecked,  Ryunosuke and Kyusaku are okay, but the cat.....is dead.  It then cuts into the main story.  Kyusaku is a genius scientist, by the way.  He ends up putting the cat's brain into a female android body!  Oh and the antics that ensue.  The story is centered around Ryunosuke, his father, Nuku Nuku (the cat girl), Akiko (their rival, and Kyusaku's WIFE), and Akiko's gun crazy employees.  Nuku Nuku is so loveable, but for some reason, everyone wants to kill her!  This six episode DVD encompasses the entire story.  It is action packed and hilarious, but still touching in many moments.  My only complaint is that I wish there was more.  There are pretty good extras like an image gallery and trailers.  The picture is pretty good ( as good as it can be for a slightly older animation), with good sound.  I recommend this to anime fans in general, unless you are very stuck in your particular genre.",4,Purrfect for anime fans,1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,1175,"['One', 'Day', 'Ryunosuke', 'out', 'father', 'when', 'cat', 'father', 'can', 'keep', 'Kyusaku', 'dad', 'can', 'hardly', 'say', 'are', 'attacked', 'hi', 'tech', 'helicopter', 'take', 'off', 'chase', 'time', 'chase', 'car', 'wrecked', 'Ryunosuke', 'Kyusaku', 'are', 'okay', 'cat', '..is', 'dead', 'then', 'main', 'story', 'Kyusaku', 'genius', 'scientist', 'way', 'up', 'putting', 'cat', 'brain', 'female', 'android', 'body', 'Oh', 'antics', 'ensue', 'story', 'centered', 'Ryunosuke', 'father', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'cat', 'girl', 'Akiko', 'rival', 'Kyusaku', 'WIFE', 'Akiko', 'gun', 'crazy', 'employees', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'so', 'loveable', 'reason', 'everyone', 'kill', 'six', 'episode', 'DVD', 'entire', 'story', 'action', 'packed', 'hilarious', 'still', 'touching', 'many', 'moments', 'only', 'complaint', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'extras', 'image', 'gallery', 'trailers', 'picture', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'slightly', 'older', 'animation', 'good', 'sound', 'recommend', 'anime', 'fans', 'general', 'are', 'very', 'stuck', 'particular', 'genre']",N/A

She's cute and sweet, so she becomes something of a restaurant idol star.  Unfortunately, those out to capture her turn the restaurant into a battle zone.

She doesn't look like the typical Cat Girl with kitty ears and a tail. She has robot ears that come out when she is in combat mode. Every now and then her cat brain kicks in and she meows and acts like a kitty. I wouldn't call her much of a cat girl though. Anyway, She was created by the scientist Natsume. She serves as a companion to his young son. Natsume is at war with an evil organization called Mishima, Nuku Nuku's original purpose is to foil their evil schemes. Honestly, a child could probably defeat the brain donors that head up Mishima. Luckily, Nuku Nuku is almost on that level, and she has super powers.This anime is kind of strange and very silly. It's a lot of fun. If you have seen Excel Saga, you know what to expect. This is pretty much a rated PG cat girl version of that. Nuku Nuku is like a cross between Excel, Lina Inverse, and Yuri from Dirty Pair Flash. She's a lovable character that works her way into the viewers heart. Despite her likability, this anime has a very weak story, average characters, and average animation. Actually, the story is just barely a story at all. Each episode is a different adventure, kinda like Excel Saga. I enjoyed this anime. It's nice to see a show like this one sometimes. It takes your mind off the tedious day to day life of the average American guy. I can see myself coming back to watch this series from time to time, but by no means is this a great show. I do do like that it's just silly and fun, but I definitely wouldn't pay more than 15 bucks for it.",4,"She's not a very cattish cat girl, but she's cute and fun",1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,1601,"['Nuku', 'Nuku', 'used', 'be', 'be', 'real', 'cat', 'Now', 'android', 'body', 'cat', 'brain', ""n't"", 'look', 'typical', 'Cat', 'Girl', 'kitty', 'ears', 'tail', 'robot', 'ears', 'come', 'out', 'when', 'combat', 'mode', 'now', 'then', 'cat', 'brain', 'kicks', 'kitty', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'much', 'cat', 'girl', 'Anyway', 'was', 'created', 'scientist', 'Natsume', 'companion', 'young', 'son', 'Natsume', 'war', 'evil', 'organization', 'called', 'Mishima', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'original', 'purpose', 'foil', 'evil', 'schemes', 'Honestly', 'child', 'could', 'probably', 'defeat', 'brain', 'donors', 'head', 'up', 'Mishima', 'Luckily', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'almost', 'level', 'super', 'powers.This', 'anime', 'kind', 'strange', 'very', 'silly', 'lot', 'fun', 'have', 'seen', 'Excel', 'Saga', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'pretty', 'much', 'rated', 'PG', 'cat', 'girl', 'version', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'cross', 'Excel', 'Lina', 'Inverse', 'Yuri', 'Dirty', 'Pair', 'Flash', 'lovable', 'character', 'way', 'viewers', 'heart', 'likability', 'anime', 'very', 'weak', 'story', 'average', 'characters', 'average', 'animation', 'Actually', 'story', 'just', 'barely', 'story', 'episode', 'different', 'adventure', 'kinda', 'Excel', 'Saga', 'enjoyed', 'anime', 'nice', 'see', 'show', 'one', 'sometimes', 'mind', 'tedious', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'average', 'American', 'guy', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'back', 'watch', 'series', 'time', 'time', 'means', 'great', 'show', 'do', 'do', 'just', 'silly', 'fun', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'more', '15', 'bucks']",N/A

Well, what eles can I say about this one that hasn't been said before? If you've read the other reviews already, you know the basic story by now. Well, let me just say that, if you want to see this series in English, you have to get the DVD, since even though this series has been available in the U.S. since 1996, it hasn't been until earlier in '03 that A.D.V. went back and dubbed it in English, and the dubbed version is only available on bilingual DVD. That having been said, I might add that if you like your anime in English and you've been watching A.D.V. licenced shows for some time now, you might hear a few familar voices-Allison Keith (BLUE SEED and Misato from NEON GENESIS EVANGELION) is Nuku Nuku, Kelly Manison (THOSE WHO HUNT ELVES and Naga from THE SLAYERS) is the mother, Tiffany Grant (BLUE SEED, Chi from DEVIL HUNTER YOKO, Maki from BURN-UP & BURN-UP W, Becky from GUNSMITH CATS,) is Kyouko, one of the office lady warriors, and Cynthia Martinez (Yuna from GALAXY FRAULIEN YUNA and Lina Inverse from SLAYERS THE MOVIE & SLAYERS OAVs) is Emi (pronounced ""Amy""), the rival android who shows up in episode 4.

370106,ALEEUYVH3Q5SE,6303342787,Sandor Swartz,"[3, 3]","First, I'd like to note that I agree with the reviewer beneath me, Michelle Klein-Hass, 100%. Everything she said, I couldn't have said better myself (except I thought nuku just meant 'warm' so I probably would have given bad information there). But seriously, this is the greatest anime I have ever seen, by any measure, and I'd rate it as the third greatest thing I have ever watched. (i.e. the other 2 aren't anime.... #1 is the movie Remo Williams....)I have a horrifyingly good movie/toon memory. I can remember almost word-for-word everything I have watched in the last decade, so saying it is the third greatest is quite a claim. Also, strangely enough, even though I have seen it and remember it so well so I know what will happen next, I have watched it several times and enjoyed it every time. Very few things can I even stand to watch a second time, and even after 5 years.I do NOT agree with the reviewer who thinks it is a little sleazy. Nuku Nuku is drawn to the standard voluptuous female form, but so WHAT? If you were going to make a robotic prosthetic body, wouldn't you make it as attractive as possible? I really couldn't believe it any other way.Now, Nuku Nuku Dash. THAT is sleazy. THIS is not. THAT is as if it were some unworthy fanfiction that somehow, by some miracle, managed to get itself produced. But I deny its existence. They screwed EVERYTHING up as well. I would suggest anyone reading this avoid it. It is a sorrowful disappointment; perhaps an offensive insult to this series itself.I suppose it derserves a mention that Nuku Nuku is also the most endearing character of any work of fiction I can think of. Perhaps the most interesting character. (And I mean endearing in non-sexual terms. For example, Vash the Stampede from Trigun is what I would call endearing, although not as much as Nuku Nuku... and I'm not a gay dude.) She's very sweet, and yet not a simple, flat character, the way most super-nice characters generally turn out. Watch this and you will just fall in love with this nutty and eccentric, lovable cat person, and NOT just for her looks (for crying out loud, they could at least have drawn her with more than one tooth more than 10% of the time). It staggers the mind to imagine that so many other characters in the series could be so evil as to wish her harm/death. How could anyone want anything less than what's best for this sweetie?This also satisfies the constraints I would apply to good science fiction, and not just into the anime genre. Nuku Nuku is the only one who demonstrates superhuman strength or speed, save another android, and they DO have respect for the laws of physics of our world, for the most part. Well, some times they draw things a little strangely to emphasize this or that.... for instance, a big machine changing color and shooting off steam to emphasize its human driver inside is ticked. You may notice that none of the characters have blue or green or other ridiculous hair colors... it's only Nuku Nuku with reddish magenta hair, but that's ok since she's an android after all. Basically, it does not adhere to ALL the norms of stereotypical Japanese animations (though again, they should have done a better job drawing teeth in wide-open mouths).",5,"3rd greatest thing I have ever seen, EVER",1079740800,"03 20, 2004",2004,3239,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'note', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Michelle', 'Klein-Hass', '100', '%', 'Everything', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'said', 'better', 'thought', 'nuku', 'just', 'meant', ""'warm"", 'so', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'bad', 'information', 'seriously', 'greatest', 'anime', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'measure', ""'d"", 'rate', 'third', 'greatest', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'i.e', 'other', '2', 'are', ""n't"", 'anime', '1', 'movie', 'Remo', 'Williams', 'have', 'horrifyingly', 'good', 'movie/toon', 'memory', 'can', 'remember', 'almost', 'word-for-word', 'everything', 'have', 'watched', 'last', 'decade', 'saying', 'third', 'greatest', 'quite', 'claim', 'Also', 'strangely', 'enough', 'even', 'have', 'seen', 'remember', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'Very', 'few', 'things', 'can', 'even', 'stand', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'even', '5', 'years.I', 'do', 'NOT', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'little', 'sleazy', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'drawn', 'standard', 'voluptuous', 'female', 'form', 'so', 'WHAT', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'robotic', 'prosthetic', 'body', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'attractive', 'possible', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'other', 'way.Now', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'Dash', 'THAT', 'sleazy', 'THIS', 'not', 'THAT', 'were', 'unworthy', 'fanfiction', 'somehow', 'miracle', 'managed', 'get', 'produced', 'deny', 'existence', 'screwed', 'EVERYTHING', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'reading', 'avoid', 'sorrowful', 'disappointment', 'perhaps', 'offensive', 'insult', 'series', 'suppose', 'mention', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'also', 'most', 'endearing', 'character', 'work', 'fiction', 'can', 'think', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'mean', 'endearing', 'non-sexual', 'terms', 'example', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'Trigun', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'endearing', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', ""'m"", 'not', 'gay', 'dude', 'very', 'sweet', 'yet', 'not', 'simple', 'flat', 'character', 'way', 'most', 'super-nice', 'characters', 'generally', 'turn', 'out', 'Watch', 'will', 'just', 'fall', 'love', 'nutty', 'eccentric', 'lovable', 'cat', 'person', 'NOT', 'just', 'looks', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'could', 'least', 'have', 'drawn', 'more', 'one', 'tooth', 'more', '10', '%', 'time', 'mind', 'imagine', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'evil', 'wish', 'harm/death', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'want', 'anything', 'less', 'what', 'best', 'sweetie', 'also', 'constraints', 'would', 'apply', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'not', 'just', 'anime', 'genre', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'speed', 'save', 'android', 'DO', 'have', 'respect', 'laws', 'physics', 'world', 'most', 'part', 'Well', 'times', 'draw', 'things', 'little', 'strangely', 'emphasize', 'instance', 'big', 'machine', 'changing', 'color', 'shooting', 'off', 'steam', 'emphasize', 'human', 'driver', 'inside', 'ticked', 'may', 'notice', 'none', 'characters', 'have', 'blue', 'green', 'other', 'ridiculous', 'hair', 'colors', 'only', 'Nuku', 'Nuku', 'reddish', 'magenta', 'hair', 'ok', 'android', 'Basically', 'not', 'adhere', 'norms', 'stereotypical', 'Japanese', 'animations', 'again', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'drawing', 'teeth', 'wide-open', 'mouths']",N/A
370107,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,6303342787,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[12, 12]","By now any serious anime fan should be familiar with the Japanese cat-girl stereotype. A hyper-active, supercute, super-girl. I'm not sure where this idea started, but I can tell you one thing. One of the best examples of the genre I have ever seen is this OVA. What makes it a classic? Is it the perfectly insane (perfectly hilarious?) mad-scientist father? The crazed mother who is alternately a business woman fanatic that would remind you a military commander (with a hilarious over-the-top personality) and (can you believe it?) a super-sweet, delicate as lace angel obsessed with her son's welfare? Or perhaps it's the ridiculous fights and explosions through the series which never result in anyone getting killed (or even seriously injured) despite what looks like hundreds of millions of dollars of property destruction? Or could it be the heavy-artilary carrying duo henchwomen or the super-aggressive (pint-sized) android, all of whom are all obsessed with destroying the main character in some wild scheme? Na.What really makes this series is the main character. Nuku Nuku is undoubtedly one of the greatest characters in the whole history of anime. She's a super-powered android in the shape of a beautiful teen-ager with the brain of a cat. All things considered, she's almost impossible not to love. Her look is very attractive, yet very sincere. She's cute and extroverted and silly, yet fiercely loyal and self-sacrificing. She only wants to use her super-powers for good (not to show off), and yet finds herself unwittingly part of battles of mass destruction. She considers her creator and his son to be her family, and loves them dearly. Ultimately it's the pure heart of her character that makes her so compelling, and the reason why everyone loves her.You could watch this dvd in English, but that would be a crime. The Japanese language track features some of the finest voice-acting you will ever find. Everyone does a great job, but the voice actress who plays Nuku Nuku is PERFECT. In fact I'd go so far as to say that this series would be greatly diminished without her voice acting, as it truly is spectacular.I should also mention that this series has great artwork (especially considering when it was made), and a great soundtrack as well (I never get tired of the first opening theme).This is not only one of the best OVAs ever, it's also an anime classic. If wacky Japanese comedies aren't normally your style you may want to just rent this one.
