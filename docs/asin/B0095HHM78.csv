1585425,A3KUP8IQ3JMS0P,B0095HHM78,Acid,"[3, 3]","Yes, there ARE movies that are better than the book, and this is one of them. The book felt like little more than a series of very well written stories connected by the literary gimmick of telling the first half of each story before going back and finishing them. The movie, by telling the stories simultaneously, having the same actors perform in each story, and drawing parallels between the stories through clever editing, really emphasizes the connections and the theme of life being cyclical and the possibilities of reincarnation.There are quite a lot of changes to the stories themselves, and most of them are improvements, while some are merely to tighten the narrative so it doesn't run over 3 hours. Several outlandish sequences from the &#34;Luisa Rey&#34; story are thankfully dropped and the &#34;Sumni&#34; future story is simplified greatly and has some riveting action sequences added.The complaints that the movie is hard to follow shock me. Just like with &#34;Inception&#34;, it all seemed pretty straightforward to me. If you have ADD or refuse to devote your full attention, you WILL be confused, but otherwise just go with the flow. Use you brain - that's what it's there for. It's so refreshing to watch a big-budget Hollywood movie that doesn't pander to the lowest common denominators of the audience.",5,Good book.

1585426,ASZGADJQT6ET4,B0095HHM78,Adam Gagnon,"[5, 7]","From [...]The Wachowskis are at the top of their game with Cloud Atlas. A sibling duo of film creators the two always swing for the fences with their films and with Cloud Atlas they hit it out of the park. This movie is story telling and film making firing on all cylinders and never misses a beat.An epic tale of fate, love, friendship, humanity, greed, envy, and the human spirit is told through several time lines in several settings. The all star cast takes on up to six roles each of varying forms, changing not only their basic attributes to fit the time period but even full on racial and gender changes.The transformations of the characters appearance is literally just the surface of the changes the actors take on. Accents, voices, and mannerisms disappear and new ones are created with absolute perfection.The cast is outstanding in all the roles they take on. Tom Hanks, Halle berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae (in her first English speaking roles), Ben Whishaw, Keith David, James D&#8217;Arcy, Hugh Grant, and more all take on at least three roles and up to seven. The three directors it took to capture a story many criticized as being &#8220;un-filmable&#8221; also adapted the David Mitchell novel for the screen. Lana and Andy Wachowski along with Tom Tykwer.There is no absolute direct thread or linear path that the characters undergo that can be traced in black and white. Rather the decisions a soul makes in life cause a ripple effect that don&#8217;t only change an individuals karmic destiny but ripple throughout time. A lost love in one life can be realized in another, past crimes against your fellow man may require redemption paid out through decades. Every character has their own journey within their life times and every character&#8217;s soul has a journey through time. The advertising and many plot synopsis make the movie sound unruly and confusing. In reality this sprawling epic tale is massive but the Wachowski&#8217;s and Tom Tykwer never lose control of this massive undertaking. The story is large and spans time but it is not confusing. The actors get to talk on so many different roles of varying importance so that no one actor gets played out or causes the audience fatigue.Cloud Atlas is multiple stories in one, many different themes and genres are explored and all of them are explored properly. Any one of these individual stories could be a movie entirely by itself and it would be incredible to watch. While the smaller stories within Cloud Atlas take on different genres they also take on different tones. One of the threads is a very witty and fun comedy and a separate story line has some epic sci-fi action scenes. The fact that these elements don&#8217;t leak out of their main story lines doesn&#8217;t hurt the integrity of the movie but still gives the audience the emotional jolts as they need them.The make up is an achievement in itself. It is never over done or shocking to see. It all fits so naturally even knowing what the actors under the prosthetic look like. The make up is trans-formative and subtle at the same time. The audience is never taken out of the movie by an unconvincing look or cheesy prosthetic. The score for the movie is yet another element the Wachowski&#8217;s nailed along with Tykwer. Tykwer even worked on the original music for the film along with the other composers. The score for the film rises and falls with the audience&#8217;s emotions. As a film-goer you would be hard pressed to see this modern epic along with the immersive score without being totally engrossed in the spectacle before you.Cloud Atlas is everything the movie industry needs right now. This movie speaks for itself and is incredibly entertaining while being an absolute masterpiece. This is something that as an audience member you don&#8217;t just see, you experience.",5,My Cloud Atlas Review,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,3865,"['[', 'Wachowskis', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'A', 'sibling', 'duo', 'film', 'creators', 'two', 'always', 'swing', 'fences', 'films', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'hit', 'park', 'movie', 'story', 'telling', 'film', 'making', 'firing', 'cylinders', 'never', 'beat.An', 'epic', 'tale', 'fate', 'love', 'friendship', 'humanity', 'greed', 'envy', 'human', 'spirit', 'told', 'several', 'time', 'lines', 'several', 'settings', 'star', 'cast', 'six', 'roles', 'varying', 'forms', 'changing', 'not', 'only', 'basic', 'attributes', 'fit', 'time', 'period', 'even', 'full', 'racial', 'gender', 'changes.The', 'transformations', 'characters', 'appearance', 'literally', 'just', 'surface', 'changes', 'actors', 'take', 'Accents', 'voices', 'mannerisms', 'disappear', 'new', 'ones', 'are', 'created', 'absolute', 'perfection.The', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'roles', 'take', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Halle', 'berry', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'Doona', 'Bae', 'first', 'English', 'speaking', 'roles', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'Keith', 'David', 'James', 'D', '8217', 'Arcy', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'more', 'take', 'least', 'three', 'roles', 'up', 'seven', 'three', 'directors', 'took', 'capture', 'story', 'many', 'criticized', 'being', '8220', 'un-filmable', '8221', 'also', 'adapted', 'David', 'Mitchell', 'novel', 'screen', 'Lana', 'Andy', 'Wachowski', 'Tom', 'Tykwer.There', 'absolute', 'direct', 'thread', 'linear', 'path', 'characters', 'undergo', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'black', 'white', 'decisions', 'soul', 'life', 'cause', 'ripple', 'effect', 'don', '8217', 'only', 'change', 'individuals', 'karmic', 'destiny', 'ripple', 'time', 'lost', 'love', 'one', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'realized', 'past', 'crimes', 'fellow', 'man', 'may', 'require', 'redemption', 'paid', 'out', 'decades', 'character', 'own', 'journey', 'life', 'times', 'character', '8217', 's', 'soul', 'journey', 'time', 'advertising', 'many', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'make', 'movie', 'sound', 'unruly', 'confusing', 'reality', 'sprawling', 'epic', 'tale', 'massive', 'Wachowski', '8217', 's', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'never', 'lose', 'control', 'massive', 'undertaking', 'story', 'large', 'spans', 'time', 'not', 'confusing', 'actors', 'get', 'talk', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'roles', 'varying', 'importance', 'so', 'one', 'actor', 'played', 'out', 'audience', 'fatigue.Cloud', 'Atlas', 'multiple', 'stories', 'one', 'many', 'different', 'themes', 'genres', 'are', 'explored', 'are', 'explored', 'properly', 'one', 'individual', 'stories', 'could', 'be', 'movie', 'entirely', 'would', 'be', 'incredible', 'watch', 'smaller', 'stories', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'take', 'different', 'genres', 'also', 'take', 'different', 'tones', 'One', 'threads', 'very', 'witty', 'fun', 'comedy', 'separate', 'story', 'line', 'epic', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'scenes', 'fact', 'elements', 'don', '8217', 'leak', 'main', 'story', 'lines', 'doesn', '8217', 'hurt', 'integrity', 'movie', 'still', 'audience', 'emotional', 'jolts', 'need', 'them.The', 'make', 'up', 'achievement', 'never', 'done', 'shocking', 'see', 'fits', 'so', 'naturally', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'actors', 'prosthetic', 'look', 'make', 'up', 'trans-formative', 'subtle', 'same', 'time', 'audience', 'never', 'taken', 'movie', 'unconvincing', 'look', 'cheesy', 'prosthetic', 'score', 'movie', 'yet', 'element', 'Wachowski', '8217', 'nailed', 'Tykwer', 'Tykwer', 'even', 'worked', 'original', 'music', 'film', 'other', 'composers', 'score', 'film', 'rises', 'audience', '8217', 's', 'emotions', 'film-goer', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'see', 'modern', 'epic', 'immersive', 'score', 'being', 'totally', 'engrossed', 'spectacle', 'you.Cloud', 'Atlas', 'everything', 'movie', 'industry', 'right', 'now', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'being', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'something', 'audience', 'member', 'don', '8217', 't', 'just', 'see', 'experience']",Cloud Atlas
1585427,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B0095HHM78,Adrien Caldwell,"[2, 2]","I finally watched this film on DVD after it was released in the Spring. From the previews and trailers that I saw months prior, I was really looking forward to viewing this complex film. I'd have to say that this isn't your typical movie where you can go into it without any prior knowledge. This film is from a complex novel with six mini-stories all wrapped into one work. I will admit that I didn't read nor did I even know much about the novel but I am fascinated with the concept of reincarnation. And this movie covered that topic beautifully. I plan to purchase the DVD and watch it multiple times and my feeling is, I will learn and acquire more from it every time I see it again.I will admit, I found myself confused in the beginning but I couldn't help but stay glued to the screen the entire duration of this nearly three hour film. It starts to pull together shortly thereafter and as another reviewer expressed, it's highly advisable to stick around for the ending so that you can see the actors's credits with short clips of the movie additionally displayed; showing their multiple different characters. They are, for the most part, unrecognizable in a couple of their roles. The wardrobe and makeup were both incredibly amazing.Since this story has six subplots (technically seven with the brief prolouge and epilogue), I can see how this might turn quite a few people off. It gives the impression that there is no protagonist and therefore, no sense of perspective by a main character. Technically that would be correct to assert but after all; this movie is about reincarnation and how multiple lives are connected. And that topic is a complex one indeed. Creating a presentation of this nature is a huge feat but one that I think the writer/diretors of Cloud Atlas captured stunningly.What I also loved about this movie was how it prompted the viewer to ponder and think of controversial topics; possibly challenging current day beliefs. For example, one that comes to mind is the idea that clones are nothing more than soul""less"" genetic material to be harvested and/or exploited for human use. In the case of Sonmi-451 (fabricant/clone) from Seoul, Korea in the year 2144 we see that her character not only had past lives, but she's also spiritually evolved and enlightened to the point that she's mistakenbly believed to be a Goddess by the inhabitants of the Big Island in a couple hundred year's time in the year 2321. Of course, it's just a fictional movie but I really thought it was amazing that a movie of this nature could make a viewer think and ask, ""What if that were true...?""This movie kinda reminds me of Mulholland Drive (2001) only in the sense that it is quite complicated but you get more and more from the film after seeing it again and again.",5,"Complex, Long, Beautifully Done and Well Worth It",1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,2782,"['finally', 'watched', 'film', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'Spring', 'previews', 'trailers', 'saw', 'months', 'prior', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'viewing', 'complex', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', ""n't"", 'typical', 'movie', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'film', 'complex', 'novel', 'six', 'mini-stories', 'wrapped', 'one', 'work', 'will', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'did', 'even', 'know', 'much', 'novel', 'am', 'fascinated', 'concept', 'reincarnation', 'movie', 'covered', 'topic', 'beautifully', 'plan', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'feeling', 'will', 'learn', 'acquire', 'more', 'time', 'see', 'again.I', 'will', 'admit', 'found', 'confused', 'beginning', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'stay', 'glued', 'screen', 'entire', 'duration', 'nearly', 'three', 'hour', 'film', 'pull', 'together', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'reviewer', 'expressed', 'highly', 'advisable', 'stick', 'around', 'ending', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'actors', 'credits', 'short', 'clips', 'movie', 'additionally', 'displayed', 'showing', 'multiple', 'different', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'unrecognizable', 'couple', 'roles', 'wardrobe', 'makeup', 'were', 'incredibly', 'amazing.Since', 'story', 'six', 'subplots', 'technically', 'seven', 'brief', 'prolouge', 'epilogue', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'turn', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'impression', 'protagonist', 'therefore', 'sense', 'perspective', 'main', 'character', 'Technically', 'would', 'be', 'correct', 'assert', 'movie', 'reincarnation', 'how', 'multiple', 'lives', 'are', 'connected', 'topic', 'complex', 'one', 'indeed', 'Creating', 'presentation', 'nature', 'huge', 'feat', 'one', 'think', 'writer/diretors', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'captured', 'stunningly.What', 'also', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'prompted', 'viewer', 'ponder', 'think', 'controversial', 'topics', 'possibly', 'challenging', 'current', 'day', 'beliefs', 'example', 'one', 'mind', 'idea', 'clones', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'soul', 'less', 'genetic', 'material', 'be', 'harvested', 'and/or', 'exploited', 'human', 'use', 'case', 'Sonmi-451', 'fabricant/clone', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'year', '2144', 'see', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'past', 'lives', 'also', 'spiritually', 'evolved', 'enlightened', 'point', 'mistakenbly', 'believed', 'be', 'Goddess', 'inhabitants', 'Big', 'Island', 'couple', 'hundred', 'year', 'time', 'year', '2321', 'course', 'just', 'fictional', 'movie', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'amazing', 'movie', 'nature', 'could', 'make', 'viewer', 'think', 'ask', 'What', 'were', 'true', 'movie', 'kinda', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', '2001', 'only', 'sense', 'quite', 'complicated', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'film', 'seeing', 'again', 'again']",Cloud Atlas

Personally, I thought -- in terms of story -- ""Cloud Atlas"" (based on the David Mitchell novelCloud Atlas (Movie Tie-in Edition): A Novel) was a masterpiece! A true cinematic work of art! From the brothers behindThe Matrix Collection: 4 Film Favoritesand the director ofRun Lola Run, comes this movie anthology where all of the stories -- taking place at different times (1849, 1936, 1973, 2012, 2144, and 2321) -- are interconnected somehow (hence the tagline ""Everything is connected""). Each story somehow inadvertantly or purposely affects the next chronological story's character(s)/story, and the order in which the stories are shown correlates with its neighboring story. Confused? Lost? Well, if you don't seriously pay attention, you will be. The overall message is that our lives somehow can affect others' lives in ways we did not think possible; this is best summed up by troubled composer Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) when he narrates, ""My life extends far beyond the limitations of me."" Another message is that we should not be afraid to stand up for what is truly right ... even if you feel outnumbered (this especially comes to mind since for the past 13 years questioning government, politicians or big business/money has been -- to put it lightly -- frowned upon); this is best summed up when Hugo Weaving's Haskell Moore tells his son-in-law, Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess), who has decided to take his wife to work for the abolitionist movement, ""There is a natural order to this world, and those who try to upend it do not fare well. This movement will never survive. If you join them, you and your entire family will be shunned. At best, you will exist a pariah to be spat at and beaten, at worse to be lynched or crucified. And for what? For what? No matter what you do it will never amount to anything more than a single drop in a limitless ocean,"" to which Ewing replies, ""What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?"" It's all about perspective. Would you rather be someone who thinks a drop in the ocean is meaningless ... or would you rather be someone who, no matter how small, has the satisfaction of knowing you contributed? The cast all do spectacular jobs and it is a nice little kick to see them all taking on such a number of eclectic characters. The movie is a little lengthy at just under 3 hours, but the time goes by fast as the stories all pull you in to their respective worlds and keep you on the edge of your seat. I could write a lot more about this film ... but not without giving away too much plot, so I'll simply say the themes in this film are powerful and resonate long after the movie ends.",5,Four-and-a-half stars for this cinematic work of art!,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2686,"['loved', 'movie', 'downright', 'hated', 'Personally', 'thought', 'terms', 'story', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'based', 'David', 'Mitchell', 'novelCloud', 'Atlas', 'Movie', 'Tie-in', 'Edition', 'Novel', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'true', 'cinematic', 'work', 'art', 'brothers', 'behindThe', 'Matrix', 'Collection', '4', 'Film', 'Favoritesand', 'director', 'ofRun', 'Lola', 'Run', 'movie', 'anthology', 'where', 'stories', 'taking', 'place', 'different', 'times', '1849', '1936', '1973', '2012', '2144', '2321', 'are', 'interconnected', 'somehow', 'hence', 'tagline', 'Everything', 'connected', 'story', 'somehow', 'inadvertantly', 'purposely', 'next', 'chronological', 'story', 'character', '/story', 'order', 'stories', 'are', 'shown', 'correlates', 'neighboring', 'story', 'Confused', 'Lost', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'seriously', 'pay', 'attention', 'will', 'be', 'overall', 'message', 'lives', 'somehow', 'can', 'affect', 'others', 'lives', 'ways', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'possible', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'troubled', 'composer', 'Robert', 'Frobisher', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'when', 'life', 'far', 'limitations', 'message', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'truly', 'right', 'even', 'feel', 'outnumbered', 'especially', 'mind', 'past', '13', 'years', 'questioning', 'government', 'politicians', 'big', 'business/money', 'been', 'put', 'lightly', 'frowned', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'when', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Haskell', 'Moore', 'son-in-law', 'Adam', 'Ewing', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'who', 'decided', 'take', 'wife', 'work', 'abolitionist', 'movement', 'natural', 'order', 'world', 'who', 'try', 'upend', 'do', 'not', 'fare', 'well', 'movement', 'will', 'never', 'survive', 'join', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'shunned', 'best', 'will', 'exist', 'pariah', 'be', 'spat', 'beaten', 'worse', 'be', 'lynched', 'crucified', 'what', 'what', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'will', 'never', 'amount', 'anything', 'more', 'single', 'drop', 'limitless', 'ocean', 'Ewing', 'replies', 'What', 'ocean', 'multitude', 'drops', 'perspective', 'Would', 'rather', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'drop', 'ocean', 'meaningless', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'satisfaction', 'knowing', 'contributed', 'cast', 'do', 'spectacular', 'jobs', 'nice', 'little', 'kick', 'see', 'taking', 'number', 'eclectic', 'characters', 'movie', 'little', 'lengthy', 'just', '3', 'hours', 'time', 'fast', 'stories', 'pull', 'respective', 'worlds', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'could', 'write', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'say', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'powerful', 'resonate', 'long', 'movie']",Cloud Atlas

However I kept on watching the film, Cloud Atlas is a very long movie and I am not saying that it is a very riveting affair all the time but it is a very absorbing and and a beautiful affair to watch. What is amazing that a spare cast takes on multiple roles over many centuries and play these roles which such an amazing ease. Tom Hanks has almost 6 six roles unless I missed some during the film. Same goes for Hugo Weaving he plays six roles as well.The movie spans from a slave ship in the early 1800's to a futuristic Seoul set in 2144 and about various individuals throughout time who are interconnected by a birthmark.Cloud Atlas is based on David Mitchell's 2004 novel run at 2 hours and 52 minutes long and by no means an easy film to watch there is a lot of things that need to be digested and understood it you want to grasp the films lavish scale. However what struck out the most is the beauty of the film and its lush locations.There are six stories beginning with the ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,"" which takes place on a ship and a  friendship that develops between a lawyer (Jim Sturgess) and a  slave (David Gyasi). The second story is , ""Letters from Zedelghem,"" about a partnership between  a musician (Ben Whishaw) and a reclusive composer (Jim Broadbent) for whom he works as an amanuensis. ""Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery"" is set in the 1970s about Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) a journalist who unravels a plot by an oil  executive (Hugh Grant) to allow a nuclear reactor to melt. The fourth tale is, ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" is about a British publisher (Jim Broadbent) who is banished by his brother to  a bizarre nursing home. . ""An Orison of Sonmi~451"" about genetically engineered  (Doona Bae) who  is used by revolutionaries to be the figurehead for their rebellion. The sixth and final story, ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After"" takes place in a time beyond the 22nd century when  tribesman (Tom Hanks) befriends a woman (Halle Berry) who belongs to a technologically advanced culture.All these story are not presented in a cohesive manner yet there is a link that connects all of them. I had to think at many times about the link but it is not hard to discern it.I said this before and I will plead viewers to see it on a Blu Ray because the scenes are breathtaking and deserve to be seen on this format.This was a good movie with many talented actors playing many roles throughout the ages.

One story line did not fit for me at all, it involved a writer who's brother set him to a nursing home, perhaps it was added for comic relief, however, it seemed like putting an SNL sketch in the middle of the movie.  I never did fully relate to many of the characters. Tom Hanks WAS a character to relate to in the 'most future' world (make sure you enable close captioning to get the most out of these segments as they use a 'future dialect' of English.). It was also quite distracting to use the same Mr. Smith character in the movie that the filmakers used for the Matrix.  He did a good job, but it did seem like a poor choice to use him I guess.  Unfortunately he is a bit cast type as being from the Matrix series.

Also there are many events and actions that are disjointed - I assume these become clear upon further analysis rather than shortcomings or flaws in the writing itself? Overall, an interesting view, it makes you think about the fundamental problems of human nature, about whether there is such a thing as soulmates.

David Mitchell, the author of Cloud Atlas, uses a version of this storytelling device to show how the predatory nature of human beings propagates through space and time and that all lives are intertwined with a shared destiny forged by acts of kindness or crime, past and present. The stories span from 1849 on a Pacific island to 2321 in ""The Valley"" on a post-apocalyptic earth. Not having read the book, the film was confusing to me at first, but as the stories unfolded, they started to make sense and I was mesmerized. Some viewers complain about being bored but the film is anything but boring. It is a comedy, romance, science fiction, and action movie all at once. This film warrants multiple viewing. If it is confusing in the first viewing, it will be crystal clear in the second or third. The various characters in the film are played by the same actors and actresses in different make-up. I was amazed at the end credit by the roles they played, which I couldn't have guessed. This film is visionary & ground breaking. It is a must-watch for film lovers.*Spoiler Alert* - The following review may contain spoilers.Afterthought: ""The weak are meat, the strong do eat."" That seems to be one of the unifying themes of the film. Throughout all six stories, the strong always prey on the weak. The film begins with Dr. Henry Goose showing his future victim a handful of teeth from his dig site used by past cannibals. In the story of Sonmi 451, ""fabricants"" are routinely killed and their corpses fed to other unsuspecting fabricants. Actual cannibalism exists in ""The Valley"" on the post-apocalyptic earth. The author David Mitchell seems to be preoccupied with the number 6 - six stories in the novel, the Cloud Atlas Sextet, Rufus Sixsmith... It also happens that the Devil's number is 666. Does the author think that human nature is inherently evil? I hope not. I like to think that human nature is basically good. At least I hope so. Another unifying theme is the interconnectedness of all lives, past and present. Each principal character is linked to and his/her live influenced by the previous one through a book, a birthmark, a piece of music, or a movie, and Sonmi is worshipped as a goddess and her words as living guide in The Valley.

I was wrong. The special effects are good, the actors do a good job, but what is missing is a constancy, a thread that binds the story together. The jumping around is distracting and even after an hour, you cannot really get into it. When a story is told, especially by the medium of film, we must be gripped by a character or an element that holds our interest and makes us want to pursue the telling from beginning to end. Alas, there are no gripping characters--only incomplete ones, in whom we don't have time to become interested because we've jumped somewhere else. Perhaps the filmmakers missed a great opportunity by not hiring Steve Kloves (he wrote most if not all of the Harry Potter films), who, through skillful manipulation of just a few critical elements made J K Rowling's stories work visually.A movie is not a book and has entirely different structural requirements.While it's a bit easier to leaf back and forth between chapters to understand what's in a book, how many viewers would have the patience to keep re-running film segments in order to figure them out? Two hours into it, I still had trouble understanding where this film was going. I have not read the book, though I am now curious to do so. And by the way, I don't think a viewer is obliged to read the book in order to understand this particular film, or any other. As a fan of science fiction I badly wanted to love this movie, but unfortunately, despite the grand visuals and some nice acting, it fails where it counts most: holding the viewer's interest.

1585485,A3IHUDYEOF1C29,B0095HHM78,BookLover59,"[3, 3]","Having read the novel, upon first viewing this film -- in the theater -- I was a bit worried that the quick edits (from story to story) was gonna make it tough to watch (and likely tough to understand if one hadn't read the novel).  But after seeing tha the filmmakers were doing quick cuts to introduce the six differnt, but inter-connected, stories, I relaxed wand went with it.Like the novel, ""Cloud Atlas"" the movie follows the path of six different narratives:1) The 19th century island and sea-faring adventures of an American man, Adam Ewing, whose beliefs about slavery will be changed via his journey and an unlikely friendship2) The early 20th Century (1930s) romantic story of Robert Frobisher a young, bisexual English composer in Belgium, apprenticing with an aging, past his prime musical icon. Via letters to his lover -- Rupert Sixsmith -- Frobisher recounts the creation of his one and only piece of music (""the Cloud Atlas Sextet"") and of some sexual doings with his mentor's wife.3) A mystery which takes place in 1970s california, involving magazine writer Luisa Rey and the aged Rupert Sixsmith -- not to mention, shady doings a nuclear power plant.4) A present-day, London and England-based farce and ""comedy of manners"" involving sixty-something English vanity publisher Timothy Cavendish, a semi-reformed thug who wrote a memoir entitled KNUCKLE SANDWICH, and a very nasty nurse named Noakes (not to mention some very funny scenes involving a cat, a plunger and a van full of old folks).5) A mid-21st Century SF-thriller, set in Neo-Seoul, Korea, centered around a fabricant -- a clone born into servitude -- named Somni-451, and her path to enlightenment and rebellion.6) A far-future, post-apocalyptic, dystopian SF tale set in the Hawaiian islands, involving Zachary -- a man who is a sort of outcast of his tribe, because he let his brother and nephew die in an attack by cannibalistic rival tribesman, the Kona -- and a ""prescient"" (a far-future dweller who still has master over technology, and who is more intelligent than the average island dweller) named Meronym.  It seems that Meronym has come to Zachary's village in search of someone who can guide her to the top of a particular mountain on the islands. Zacharay -- who survived a Kona attack there -- is that man.While all of these tales may seem too disparate -- and too far apart, time-wise -- to be related, as each story progresses the viewer learns that they are related, and that the fates of each person in the generation before affects those who come after (which is the underlying, and most important, theme of the film).For instance, Robert Frobisher is reading ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing"" while enduring the browbeating of his musical mentor, missing his male lover and half-heartedly fending off the attentions of this mentor's wife.And while leaving an interview gone-wrong, Luisa Rey finds herself stuck in an elevator with Rupert Sixsmith, who notices that she has a birthmark, on her shoulder, which is very similar to that of his long-dead lover, Robert Frobisher.Because of this encounter, Sixsmith is moved to share information about illegal activity at the Nuclear power plant where he works, setting in motion a series of activities that will endanger the lives of Luisa Rey and several others.Timothy Canvendish, knight errant and independent publisher, while taking it on the lam (to escape some thuggish types who want money from him after their brother's book hits the bestseller lists), is, at one point, reading a book he will publish in the future, entitled HALF-LIVES: THE FIRST LUISA REY MYSTERY.Fabricant Somni-451, while first getting involved in activities forbidden to those created only to serve, sees part of a film entitled, ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" (a film that will inspire one of her coworkers to commit the first act of rebellion by a fabricant).  Later, through the help of a human, she is able to see the entire film.And Zachary and his tribal island dwellers all worship the ""Goddess"" Somni, repeating many of her words as spiritual and religious guides to living.While the filmed version of CLOUD ATLAS differs from the book in some ways (there are a few more actions scenes, especially in the SF-oriented segments), those all help the narrative flow and make the editing (scenes of people looking for help, trapped under water, on the run, and in battle are edited in sucha a way that they happen back-to-back) even more artful.  The script (which is one of the few to do a great job of translating a novel into a film version), acting and cinematography of ""Cloud Atlas"" are all superb.This isn't a film for those who -- in the main -- like films such as ""Sex in the City"", ""Dumb and dumber"" or something like one-dimensional Vin Diesel ""car flicks"".  This is a film for those who enjoy movies like ""Atonement"", ""A Very Long Engagement"", ""Blade Runner"", Minority Report"", and so on.  In other words, a movie for thinking people -- definitely not a no-brainer (although no-brainers -- like ""Big Trouble in Little China"" -- certainly have their place).And anyone confused as to the theme -- that all of our lives here on earth are interconnected, as are our fates -- should blame themselves, since the director/writers beat that particular drum louder than the novel did (a birthmark that shows up on at least one character in each different story -- in the novel, only two or three had it) and the refrain of Somni's words (""our lives are not our own"") to underscore the theme.The film isn't without it's flaws, but they are minor.  All-in-all, it's a remarkable achievement, and feast for the eyes, heart and mind.",5,A Thinking person's epic thriller!,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,5674,"['Having', 'read', 'novel', 'first',

Best of all it did not feel like it took itself too seriously, which I was afraid of from the trailer.  It was just fun.It just presented as various short stories each taking place in a different time period reusing the same actors. And they all are different genres comedy, scifi, period drama, crime thriller. Each story could just as easily stand on its own, but putting them side by side makes you look at them a little differently than you might have.And I like the idea that while you could view these themes as either views on reincarnation, spirituality and how things happen for a reason ... you can also look at the characters as storytelling archetypes. See how the same type of character might work in a comedy as opposed to a drama for example. See how a comedic character can seem villainous, or how a supporting character expands when they're in the lead.They have a lot of great cliffhangers as you reach a climax in one story and move to another one. And there are connecting threads between the stories which you can view as just establishing them all within the same universe or timeline.

For others, it is a beautiful journey artfully shot with a riveting message of personal reflection. Say what?What not everyone will realize is that this movie is actually capturing the past life regression of many souls. To appreciate that, understand that past life regression is about recognizing and overcoming the challenges our souls have consistently faced throughout our lives (yes plural if you believe your spirit has been here before). This movie, if the viewer is keen to recognize such a thread, details the challenges faced by each incarnation of the souls focused on throughout this movie - greed, cowardice, courage, bravery, slavery, death, love, loss and so on. In some lives, you win some, and in others, you lose some.The movie isn't shot in disarray as much as it is showing you the similarity of a situation, or challenge a character faces throughout the ages. Ie: a character may make many mistakes and commit crimes against humanity/nature in one life (or two or three), while in another, they may actually do something valiant and different from what they had done before. Watch as Tom Hanks greedily goes after a little gem, like Gollum with his precious.So whether you take this movie as a great story packed with an insightful message (thank you Wachowski's for picking such a poignant story to capture on film), or the artful tale of a book turned to film, or just a confusing bunch of clips sewn together with a great cast, you will be in for a wild ride of make-up mastery and some cool special effects.",4,Thought provoking....,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,1620,"['most', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'complex', 'tale', 'be', 'disarray', 'others', 'beautiful', 'journey', 'artfully', 'shot', 'riveting', 'message', 'personal', 'reflection', 'Say', 'what', 'What', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'realize', 'movie', 'actually', 'capturing', 'past', 'life', 'regression', 'many', 'souls', 'appreciate', 'understand', 'past', 'life', 'regression', 'recognizing', 'overcoming', 'challenges', 'souls', 'have', 'consistently', 'faced', 'lives', 'yes', 'plural', 'believe', 'spirit', 'been', 'here', 'before', 'movie', 'viewer', 'keen', 'recognize', 'thread', 'details', 'challenges', 'faced', 'incarnation', 'souls', 'focused', 'movie', 'greed', 'cowardice', 'courage', 'bravery', 'slavery', 'death', 'love', 'loss', 'so', 'lives', 'win', 'others', 'lose', 'some.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shot', 'disarray', 'as', 'much', 'showing', 'similarity', 'situation', 'challenge', 'character', 'ages', 'Ie', 'character', 'may', 'make', 'many', 'mistakes', 'commit', 'crimes', 'humanity/nature', 'one', 'life', 'two', 'three', 'may', 'actually', 'do', 'something', 'valiant', 'different', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'before', 'Watch', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'greedily', 'little', 'gem', 'Gollum', 'precious.So', 'take', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'packed', 'insightful', 'message', 'Wachowski', 'picking', 'poignant', 'story', 'capture', 'film', 'artful', 'tale', 'book', 'turned', 'film', 'just', 'confusing', 'bunch', 'clips', 'sewn', 'together', 'great', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'wild', 'ride', 'make-up', 'mastery', 'cool', 'special', 'effects']",Cloud Atlas

""Dead Again"" was probably one of the best, but while it used reincarnation to advance the plot, it was actually a love story/murder mystery. This movie also embraces the themes of love and mystery but it does so by delving into issues of personal growth and how these successive (or concurrent since since time does not exist) lives and loves add or subtract from who we are as people.You won't find characters looking for hypnotist to regress them and tell them who they are, instead, you watch as they meet various aspects of themselves again and again. There is no explaining. These lives are left open for you to contemplate. The time period spans from the 1800's to a distant future world which in some respects we may be heading toward. Has Monsanto not recently sought to patent natural plants. How long before it patents clones of people? Can you own and duplicate a human being? Frankly I wouldn't put anything past congress and in the future segment of this movie..they have done just that.There are six stories in the film which shift back and forth constantly. We see the characters grow and change as they meet variations on the themes in their previous lives which all run concurrently through the story. If you are a film buff who likes to delve into the technical aspects, you will appreciate the use of matching or form cuts that make the movie run seamlessly.The movie is long, but there a is a lot to watch and I don't think I would have liked it as well if I were limited to one sitting in a theater. I watched it in 3 sittings and want to go back and see it again to fully appreciate the interwoven details. Most of the people who have not liked this found it disjointed.

In chess terminology, they would be mired in a state of ""Zugzwang.""This film doesn't seem to have just one theme, but rather seems to be full of Big Ideas.  (That second set of people that I mentioned above will think it's full of something else, but I naturally digress.)  Some of those Ideas seem to be assertions, while some of those Ideas seem to be more like questions.  Questions that the filmmakers can't answer themselves.  Questions that no one can or probably ever will be able to answer.  I'll start with the assertions:A1.  When faced with a dilemma, make the choice that is the most ethical.A2.  Everyone in life needs an advocate, or someone that looks out for him or her.A3.  There are some things worth dying for.Now I'll list some of the questions:Q1.  What is the definition of life?  We on Earth seem to think we know the answer to this question, but if we saw life on another planet, if that life was vastly different from us, would we recognize it?Q2.  (Related to Q1)  Could a machine be considered to be ""alive"" if it were ""self aware""?  And what is self awareness anyways?  ""Someone"" in the film even seems to address self awareness ""itself:""  ""The only way to know oneself is through the eyes of another.""Q3.  Does reincarnation exist?  And even if it doesn't, does the ""memory"" of the Universe seem to ""remember"" us anyway?  (This one's a little fuzzy to me but it seems to come up at a few points.)I'll admit, I only took a couple of Philosophy classes in college, and one of those classes was really more like a math class in the sense that we were required to take logic equations and simplify them, or prove they were valid or invalid.  It would be interesting to see what some Philosophy majors have to say about this film, overall.  Anyone?But with regards to the film, I'm leaning more towards the ""treasure"" camp myself.  As a matter of fact, I believe that time will be very kind to this film; I believe that critics in the future will warm up to this film and recognize its importance, at least from a philosophical viewpoint.

Some would consider Twyker arty but indeed all three make the leap here.The best way I can summarize this film is by saying it is NOT linear.  It does not unfold along the usual lines.  All sorts of experiments are ongoing throughout about telling a story out of sequence and by flashing to different characters in different times from way back in the past to way forward in the future.  The characters are involved in reincarnation to an extent but that is only one small part of this film.It took me about half an hour to get used to the constantly shifting action of the film but after that I really liked it and thought that it moved the story along very well. There is a lot of action adventure in the film so if you are expecting a slow pace because it is arty, it is NOT SLOW.What is the film about?

We are introduced to the characters right away with a mere glimpse of their story, but are not told whatsoever how they intertwine.All of the performances in Cloud Atlas are spectacular, including a wonderful exhibition of the talented Tom Hanks portrayed in various roles throughout. He truly flexes his acting skills in this movie, as we can see from his multitude of roles covering a broad spectrum of characters.Along with great performances, we are also gifted with an excellent storyline, broken into segments and told in a way that will keep you guessing what is going on.Cloud Atlas is a very different style, exhibiting a very different cinematic effect, one I can only describe as experimental and broken. Although I use the term broken, the stories are quite intact, just told in segments. When you start watching, it will take some getting used to the movie, as it takes each segment in leaps and bounds. Some may grow discouraged by this effect, but keep watching; it gets better, I promise! While the point and general meaning of each story is not immediately evident, it will emerge later. I enjoyed each and every one of the stories immensely, some more than others.Each story is told in small spurts, slowly building to some sort of union between the characters over the centuries. If it looks to be in the past, it most likely is. Except one portion, as it looks to be possibly ancient times, is actually a couple hundred years in the future. Brilliant! An ingenuous design for a movie.The action is well placed, and very rewarding. The audience will get a bit of everything, from classical music, terrific scenery, futuristic culture, and some pop references from long ago.Do I recommend this movie? Absolutely. Once you finish watching, if you do, you will be left wondering what had just happened. Many will most likely not finish watching this movie, as it is very long and quite confusing from the start.

To turn this marvellous, 500+ page novel into an almost 3 hour movie was indeed an ambitious project. There are some big names (Tom Hanks, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Halle Berry) who take on up to six roles, requiring, obviously, lots of makeup. The format is necessarily different from the book, so that each of the six stories runs through the movie from start to finish. As with the book the different genres are represented. While there are some significant departures from the book, the spirit and feel of the book are adhered to. Jim Broadbent, Halle Berry and Doona Bae are quite outstanding in all their roles. While the makers of the film take quite a bit of cinematic licence with the plots and feel compelled to include romance and lots of whiz-bang action, some of the changes allow the film to make sense without the viewer having read the book.

Six different time periods and settings (The Pacific Ocean in 1850, Cambridge in 1936, London in 2012, Neo Seoul in 2144, and Big Isle 106 winters after the fall) and cast members portraying multiple roles, ""Cloud Atlas"" is ridiculously complex and quite possibly the most fantastic event to happen to cinema in quite some time.The individuals who have read or are at least familiar with the source material seem to be at an advantage. Speaking as someone who didn't read the book, certain things didn't add up or make a whole lot of sense. During the entire Big Isle setting, everyone has this strange dialect that is difficult to comprehend at times. David Gyasi mumbles through why he dreams of proving himself as a first class seaman as Autua, a self-freed slave, in 1850. You miss a lot of the more important background information regarding his character because of it.Given the length of the film (it clocks in at 172 minutes), you may find yourself dreading another visit to the film unless you were one of the people who absolutely adored it. On the bright side, a film with this much material is bound to have secrets and hidden gems tucked away in every corner that you were bound to miss the first time through.Some of the settings and characters are much more enjoyable than others. The Big Isle setting at least plays a big role in the long run, but the London setting starts off really strong and then turns into the weakest offering of the film. Tom Hanks as Dermot Hoggins is easily the highlight as his English accent and over the top actions are the first thing to really catch your eye at the start of the film, but his character isn't used again after the opening sequence. It revolves around Jim Broadbent's Timothy Cavendish being sent to a retirement home and him trying to escape the clutches of dominant Nurse Noakes (portrayed by Hugo Weaving). It's the one setting of the film that offers this weird slapstick sense of humor that just doesn't seem to mesh well with everything else going on. Maybe it's something that was just more enjoyable in the book.While most of the actors portray a wide spectrum of characters (Tom Hanks plays a doctor who's poisoning a man just to get to his valuables, a doctor who falls for a journalist, a greasy hotel manager, and a violent English author; as an example), Hugo Weaving is basically the same character in every setting. The most vile and unlikeable character is always him throughout the film. Nurse Noakes is scary though and it's not because of the way she's written.

The story has enough depth that it has taken some concentration to grasp the depth presented.The story follows a group of people through multiple lives in different ages into the far future from the 1840's to the 2144 era.  My initial confusion was that all the stories at first seem to run at the same time and it took some attention to realize the aim of the editing and the picture as a whole was exactly to show the connections to each era and characters through the ages.

And the movie is a tapestry of six story threads, all taking place in different locales, and in different historical eras.  The thread ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After"", taking place in a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2321, is particularly difficult to follow, as the story suggests English as we know it has been altered to an almost unrecognizable dialect.  Next in difficulty is the story ""An Orison of Somni~451"", taking place in a futuristic Seoul where a food-serving clone becomes the focal point of a revolution.  Based on the above, I understand why CLOUD ATLAS never found a huge audience.  I had to view this film three times to get an adequate feel for it, and now I am a total fan; once the extended DVD with its special features is released (and I'm hoping this will be the case), I will be adding CLOUD ATLAS to my DVD collection.Extolling the theme that over time our lives are a mosaic that intertwine and affect other lives, CLOUD ATLAS is a moving, haunting film focused on the obscure musical composition 'Cloud Atlas Sextet'.  Including the two stories referenced above, other threads include a shipping voyage in the South Pacific in 1849; a dysfunctional musical collaboration in 1936; exposing corrupt big oil in 1973; and a delightful romp in (and from) a senior center in the UK in 2012.  Most of the cast appear in all, or some, of the separate threads, as different characters (obviously).  And what a cast:  Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent (the lead in ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"", by far my favorite story), Hugo Weaving, Doona Bae, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant, to name but a few.  You're guaranteed to get a kick out of Tom Hanks playing thuggish indie author Dermot Hoggins in the ""Cavendish"" thread, where he gets the ultimate revenge over a most disagreeable literary critic.  And throughout the six threads, the haunting musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and Tom Tyker only enhances the surreal film-viewing experience.  All six stories overlap to some extent--share a metaphysical commonality--making CLOUD ATLAS come together full circle.  No, this film is not for everyone; I'm just delighted it so appeals to me.--D.

This movie is very much the same but this is where any similarity ends. The difference I believe that lent to the overall cohesiveness was a message running just below the surface which prevented it from appearing to be chopped here and inserted there.Many complained about not understanding what was being said and admittedly, I suffered this same dilemma at first. After listening for a short while I was able to understand what was being spoken and surprisingly, portions even sounded Creole. Once I ""adjusted"" my ears, so to speak, I had no problem following what was being relayed.  My suggestion is to step back and relax. Do not (but do) get caught up in the kaleidoscope of characters, the cinematography, and timelines.  This is a film that must be viewed more with your heart than with your mind and eyes. It's the caring and the connections people can experience with one another without having to know the ""why"".  What brought it together and tied this film ""together"" in a neat package was this underlying theme that ran throughout its entirety and was touchingly defined by Somni during her interview. If there ever was a time to say I was wowed, it's now.This movie is quite frankly, one of the finest expeditions into cinematography I have had the pleasure of experiencing. The depth and versatility of the cast was phenomenal and the script was even more so. Cloud Atlas will not appeal to some but it sure touched my heart and for the entire length of the film I was not bored one iota.

One has to have 3 solid hours and a great deal of patience to spare before watching CLOUD ATLAS. Anyone who has those 2 things and views this film fairly attentively should at least see that the plot-line DOES make sense. Not having read David Mitchell's original novel, I know I missed a few things on first view, and the beginning in particular was mind-blendingly confusing. We generally expect the opening of a story/film to ""hook"" us, establish the basic cast of characters and conflicts, and all that sort of stuff. This would be hard to accomplish in a work of this sort, which is a bit likeThe MatrixmeetsThe English Patient.I stayed with CLOUD ATLAS, and though it wore me out, I was able to appreciate the whole story of domino effects spanning over centuries of human history: How acts of both kindness and malice trickle down, ripple out, and so forth. There's nothing ""brilliant"" or even particularly original about that, but I know of very few films that tie together so many settings in time and place this well.CLOUD ATLAS may not seem like the sort of thing to see for easy entertainment, but I think the best advice comes from several other reviewers who recommend just watching this film for ""the ride."" The cinematography, setting and costume design, and special effects are all quite amazing even by today's standards.

LovedTurner And Hooch,Big,Forrest Gumpetc. He's been in a ton of great movies. I can honestly say I haven't seen many I haven't liked. Directed by the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix Trilogy), and a who's who of top name actors/actresses, I thought I was in for a treat. I can imagine many finding this film to be a breath of fresh air or a work of art. However, I struggled not to fall asleep before I began to mentally suffer. I watched 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes and I was asking myself what was going on. Nothing connected, all the different stories didn't make sense. It might if I had watched the whole film. Though I wasn't sitting for 3 hours until the ending for it make sense. What is the enjoyment of that? The time periods jump around all over the place and left me completely confused. I want to be grabbed by a film, something that says by the end of the film I'm going to be blown away. This film had none of that. This was made on a 100 million dollar budget? Tom Hanks wasn't even appealing. He was caked in makeup with a terrible accent in every scene. I'm surprised others found enjoyment in it. For some reason certain people think it's uber cool and so deep. And God forbid if you negatively review it. Definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all year and maybe of all time.

However, I can't rate it more than three stars due to:1) The length: This movie was too long and drawn out.2) Lack of cohesiveness: From the trailers and advertisements, you would think that all the stories in the movie were tied together in some amazing way. While there are some ties between each storyline, when I saw how it was all tied together, I was like ""that's it?"" It's better viewed as several storylines put together. Don't expect a great ""tie"" between each story.3) I wouldn't recommend it to friends: While it was a decent movie, it was way too long. Also, as I noted in #2, the storylines didn't really tie together, so it was like watching several mini-movies that added up to 3 hours. I kind of felt like I wasted three hours by watching the movie, and as such, I would not recommend the movie to others.However, despite the cons listed above, I still rated the movie a three. This is because:A) The movie was entertaining. Each mini story was engaging, and the characters were intriguing. Some had good suspense, others humor, some action, and most had some mystery.B) The Wachowskis are talented film makers, no doubt about it. The visuals were great. Each world they created on film was believable.C) The movie was unique. I haven't seen any like it. It takes you through several different stories, each set in a different time.The movie was good enough for three stars, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to others. It's unique and entertaining, but definitely was not a must see. If you have three hours and want to see something different, this might be for you.

I have read a lot of metaphysics in the past and this movie clicked along those lines.  One book that especially came to mind was the 'Conversations with God' book series that deals with our souls, lives, and how we are connected.  I was surprised and delighted seeing the actors made up into different people/characters and they all did a great job - it was fun.

The way the six stories intertwine may make it hard for some to follow, but the way the information from each life time is presented is really necessary for the movie to have the impact it does for those who are touched by the film.It may help to go into the movie understanding that these are six lifetimes populated by souls who are linked together, for better or for worse and that the actions in one life can effect another. Some mistakes are repeated, some are overcome. Even knowing that, you may come away realizing that the movie may need multiple viewings to get the most out of it and some may decide it's not worth the effort, but may still enjoy it on a single viewing for what they are able to take from it.The consequences of our actions, our cruelties and our kindnesses can and do ripple outwards and impact our lives and the lives of others. Whether you believe we only have one life, or many, the lessons are just as useful.

It takes incredible skill to have pulled off the ambition that Cloud Atlas represents.Cloud Atlas is thoroughly entertaining throughout, in drama, adventure, with comedy bits sprinkled in.This is a movie that merits repeated viewing, as there are so many details in this rich tapestry. The repeated, rather astonishing logical interlocking of sequential segments in the storytelling can only begin to be appreciated upon a second viewing.We watched with captions on the first time, which is practically a necessity to catch all the dialogue, though most of it is clear enough.While ultimately this is a message film, that reveals itself overtly only in the end, and wraps up the movie intelligently.This movie requires close attention.

Then I watched the rest in the morning and I have to say I think the break really helped me take it all in. For those of you who are having trouble figuring it out, treat it as a miniseries. Break it up into two or three segments, so you'll remember more from previous scenes by the end.What I got from it was that, interwoven with various themes from various ages, like &#34;Women's Lib&#34;, snake oil 'doctors', and how we treat old people, each character was there to stand up against some kind of moral crime.  Anti-slavery, gay rights, intellectual property rights, the right to be treated with basic decency, speaking up to ask for help, communicate an issue, save a life, or convince someone to change things for the better.  Even the characters who die accomplish something from their deaths, by influencing other people who then make choices later that save lives and change things.I also like all the tiny details that went into making this story. Did you catch the reference to &#34;Soylent Green&#34; a supposedly throwaway line by the old publisher guy? It's a reference to an old sci-fi movie about a futuristic Earth where people are fed soylent green, made from humans. Just like Sonmi's people are fed &#34;Soap&#34;, made from dead server clones.In Cloud Atlas there's a sort of &#34;feeling out&#34; of what's going on in a lot of scenes, especially the Tom Hanks segment where he's speaking a sort of pidgin English. I found using the subtitles helped tremendously. Note that Hanks' form of English isn't the original Pidgin, as per his use of &#34;cog&#34; meaning &#34;to think/know/believe&#34;, obviously based off the scientific word &#34;cognitive&#34;.That's a subtle clue that a character who appears so primitive is actually in our future, in case you missed the print that told you where and when the scene is taking place. And a deliberate oxymoron, meant to jolt us into realizing that this guy is using speech patterns based off of a much more technologically advanced society, a guy who probably has no idea that 'cog' used to be 'cognitive'. The world of expansive knowledge and emotional disconnection has narrowed down to one tiny village, full of magic, Karma, superstition, religion and fierce emotional bonds to other humans.Visually breathtaking, with elaborate attention to detail from the utterly perfect makeup and costumes that gave each actor 6 roles that you won't even recognize them in, and sharp clear sweeping mountaintop views of Zachry's island, the cluttered Irish pub, the contrast between the bright Seoul laserlit city and the cramped, dirty underbelly, the forbidding castlelike English stone manor, the old-timey sailing ship with tiny bug-ridden cabins and the sweeping heights of ropes and sails, the decades of minutia in the old composer's studio...The music, too, is absolutely beautiful-powerful, thoughtful, yet simple.",5,Better if you treat it like a miniseries,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,3008,"['watched', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'then', 'went', 'bed', 'night', 'drifted', 'dreams', 'getting', 'mentally', 'sorted', 'out', 'Then', 'watched', 'rest', 'morning', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'break', 'really', 'helped', 'take', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'treat', 'miniseries', 'Break', 'up', 'two', 'three', 'segments', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'more', 'previous', 'scenes', 'end.What', 'got', 'was', 'interwoven', 'various', 'themes', 'various', 'ages', '34', 'Women', 'Lib', '34', 'snake', 'oil', ""'doctors"", 'how', 'treat', 'old', 'people', 'character', 'was', 'there', 'stand', 'up', 'kind', 'moral', 'crime', 'Anti-slavery', 'gay', 'rights', 'intellectual', 'property', 'rights', 'right', 'be', 'treated', 'basic', 'decency', 'speaking', 'up', 'ask', 'help', 'communicate', 'issue', 'save', 'life', 'convince', 'someone', 'change', 'things', 'better', 'Even', 'characters', 'who', 'die', 'accomplish', 'something', 'deaths', 'influencing', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'then', 'make', 'choices', 'later', 'save', 'lives', 'change', 'things.I', 'also', 'tiny', 'details', 'went', 'making', 'story', 'Did', 'catch', 'reference', '34', 'Soylent', 'Green', '34', 'supposedly', 'throwaway', 'line', 'old', 'publisher', 'guy', 'reference', 'old', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'futuristic', 'Earth', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'fed', 'soylent', 'green', 'made', 'humans', 'Just', 'Sonmi', 'people', 'are', 'fed', '34', 'Soap', '34', 'made', 'dead', 'server', 'clones.In', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'sort', '34', 'feeling', 'out', '34', 'what', 'going', 'lot', 'scenes', 'especially', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'segment', 'where', 'speaking', 'sort', 'pidgin', 'English', 'found', 'using', 'subtitles', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'Note', 'Hanks', 'form', 'English', ""n't"", 'original', 'Pidgin', 'use', '34', 'cog', '34', 'meaning', '34', 'think/know/believe', '34', 'obviously', 'based', 'off', 'scientific', 'word', '34', 'cognitive', '34', '.That', 'subtle', 'clue', 'character', 'who', 'so', 'primitive', 'actually', 'future', 'case', 'missed', 'print', 'told', 'where', 'when', 'scene', 'taking', 'place', 'deliberate', 'oxymoron', 'meant', 'jolt', 'realizing', 'guy', 'using', 'speech', 'patterns', 'based', 'much', 'more', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'society', 'guy', 'who', 'probably', 'idea', ""'cog"", 'used', 'be', ""'cognitive"", 'world', 'expansive', 'knowledge', 'emotional', 'disconnection', 'narrowed', 'one', 'tiny', 'village', 'full', 'magic', 'Karma', 'superstition', 'religion', 'fierce', 'emotional', 'bonds', 'other', 'humans.Visually', 'breathtaking', 'elaborate', 'attention', 'detail', 'utterly', 'perfect', 'makeup', 'costumes', 'gave', 'actor', '6', 'roles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'sharp', 'clear', 'sweeping', 'mountaintop', 'views', 'Zachry', 'island', 'cluttered', 'Irish', 'pub', 'contrast', 'bright', 'Seoul', 'laserlit', 'city', 'cramped', 'dirty', 'underbelly', 'forbidding', 'castlelike', 'English', 'stone', 'manor', 'old-timey', 'sailing', 'ship', 'tiny', 'bug-ridden', 'cabins', 'sweeping', 'heights', 'ropes', 'sails', 'decades', 'minutia', 'old', 'composer', 'studio', 'music', 'too', 'absolutely', 'beautiful-powerful', 'thoughtful', 'yet', 'simple']",Cloud Atlas

The reviews run the gamut from 1 star to 5 stars. As you've seen, I'm in the 5 star category - not a film ""classic"" but rather a film that deserves to be seen; and must be seen.I stayed away from Cloud Atlas for a long time, fearing Matrix 3 version 2.0. And while there are definitely some Matrix-y things in one particular story thread (some of the costumes, hairstyles, visuals, ""Neo-Seoul"" etc.) there was only one meaningful and important connection between The Matrix trilogy and this film: the visionary skill of Lana and Andy Wachowski who, along with Tom Twkyer, have created a visual feast for the eyes and a thought provoking movie for the soul.This is a hauntingly beautiful film - there are images that linger long in the mind, and return over and over again. Yes, at some point most people will cease to care about the much touted  inter-connections and relationships between characters and situations.  I think that is a good thing. At some point, just fully immerse yourself in the flow of this brilliantly edited film and follow it to its illuminating and emotional core. I don't think you'll be disappointed.As many have said, the cast is superb - with far too many performances worth singling out.Just wanted to get one more 5-star review into the mix.

With a vast cast playing various parts though out the entire film and somehowed linked to each and every one of them.  Based of the same novel we are given to a series of events that take place in various points in time on Earth.A young man is on a voage home in the year 1738 to conclude busniess for his father in law and to be his loving wife once more.  MEanwhile a stow away is trying to get the young man to help save him from slavery in the new lands. And a doctor that has dark designs on what the young man is traveling with.We are also introduced to a young man from England in the year 1933 leaving his gay lover to work with an elderly conductor in the hopes of one day becoming famous himself and the search for his own talent.  However will his lifestyle be his undoing as he works under the iron fist of a man who may already be washed up himself?A female jounrnalist discovers from 1972 a man she was trapped in the elvator with has been found dead and discovers that he may have information leading to a disater that could hurt hundreds of people.  In doing so she comes into the corsshairs of powerful people who want her dead and anyone else she's told of her discoveries.The year is 2012 and a washed up publisher has just witnessed his author kill a noted reviwer for the simple fact he didn't like the book.  With his author in jail and he reaping the rewards of a book that has become a best seller and the author's family demands a cut of the money he has earned.  With nowhere else to go he seeks help from his only family his brother and discovers that his brother has set him up to enact his own revenge against him for past deeds.In the year 3061 a fabricated human named Sungmi 451 is about to be excuted for her crimes against the goverment.  For her kind are never allowed to understand or even know of the outside world and that which normal humans live in day in and day out.  However after being freed by a strange man she learns that the world she wanted to know is far darker and far more dangeorus then she could ever imagine.Even farther still where recorded time no longer exists a man is struggling with his past demons as he tries to put behind what he failed to do.  And trying to help a woman from a colony of people who still the remantes of Earth's technology in a last bid chance to see if any of the colonies still exist and help them off the planet.  And in doing so the man begins to see that past mistakes can be changed by future ones.These tales while simple in thier description are truly complex by watching them.  From start to end we witness all these events and see how they  shape one another.  This is a very moving movie and one that has to be watched to understand the sheer scope of it all.  With no one actor standing out and each taking on secondary roles as the stories permit and truly something great to watch.",4,"Life, death, love, hatred, kindness, greed these are just a few of the things that make the movie Cloud Atlas a wonder to behold",1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,3034,"['Cloud', 'Atlas', 'tales', 'anger', 'betrayal', 'love', 'death', 'moments', 'somehow', 'become', 'intertwined', 'none', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'forseen', 'coming', 'vast', 'cast', 'playing', 'various', 'parts', 'entire', 'film', 'somehowed', 'linked', 'one', 'Based', 'same', 'novel', 'are', 'given', 'series', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'various', 'points', 'time', 'Earth.A', 'young', 'man', 'voage', 'home', 'year', '1738', 'conclude', 'busniess', 'father', 'law', 'be', 'loving', 'wife', 'once', 'more', 'MEanwhile', 'stow', 'away', 'trying', 'get', 'young', 'man', 'help', 'save', 'slavery', 'new', 'lands', 'doctor', 'dark', 'designs', 'what', 'young', 'man', 'traveling', 'with.We', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'young', 'man', 'England', 'year', '1933', 'leaving', 'gay', 'lover', 'work', 'elderly', 'conductor', 'hopes', 'one', 'day', 'becoming', 'famous', 'search', 'own', 'talent', 'However', 'will', 'lifestyle', 'be', 'undoing', 'iron', 'fist', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'already', 'be', 'washed', 'up', 'female', 'jounrnalist', 'discovers', '1972', 'man', 'was', 'trapped', 'elvator', 'been', 'found', 'dead', 'discovers', 'may', 'have', 'information', 'leading', 'disater', 'could', 'hurt', 'hundreds', 'people', 'doing', 'so', 'corsshairs', 'powerful', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'dead', 'anyone', 'else', 'told', 'discoveries.The', 'year', '2012', 'washed', 'up', 'publisher', 'just', 'witnessed', 'author', 'kill', 'noted', 'reviwer', 'simple', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'book', 'author', 'jail', 'reaping', 'rewards', 'book', 'become', 'best', 'seller', 'author', 'family', 'cut', 'money', 'earned', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'help', 'only', 'family', 'brother', 'discovers', 'brother', 'set', 'enact', 'own', 'revenge', 'past', 'deeds.In', 'year', '3061', 'fabricated', 'human', 'named', 'Sungmi', '451', 'be', 'excuted', 'crimes', 'goverment', 'kind', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'understand', 'even', 'know', 'outside', 'world', 'normal', 'humans', 'live', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'However', 'being', 'freed', 'strange', 'man', 'world', 'wanted', 'know', 'far', 'darker', 'far', 'more', 'dangeorus', 'then', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine.Even', 'farther', 'still', 'where', 'recorded', 'time', 'no', 'longer', 'man', 'struggling', 'past', 'demons', 'put', 'what', 'failed', 'do', 'trying', 'help', 'woman', 'colony', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'remantes', 'Earth', 'technology', 'last', 'bid', 'chance', 'see', 'colonies', 'still', 'exist', 'help', 'off', 'planet', 'doing', 'so', 'man', 'see', 'past', 'mistakes', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'future', 'ones.These', 'tales', 'simple', 'thier', 'description', 'are', 'truly', 'complex', 'watching', 'start', 'end', 'witness', 'events', 'see', 'how', 'shape', 'one', 'very', 'moving', 'movie', 'one', 'be', 'watched', 'understand', 'sheer', 'scope', 'one', 'actor', 'standing', 'out', 'taking', 'secondary', 'roles', 'stories', 'permit', 'truly', 'something', 'great', 'watch']",Cloud Atlas

1585698,A18D87U8CUN0F9,B0095HHM78,"Jason Harrington ""Trucker Hater Magazine""","[0, 0]","Haley Berry, much like Charlize Theron in Prometheus, is acting somewhere in the mid range of her ability, in Cloud Atlas. Berry is an award-winning actress, when the role places her acting at the proper scale, such as in Monster's Ball where every setting is so intimate that you merely have to hand her the lines, set some dramatic lighting, and get out of her way. Her chops tend to get buried more in a larger scale film with so many grandiose visual elements as Cloud Atlas, but that's not to say she floundered the role. When paired with Tom Hanks, at a bare minimum they are very watchable together, and this is not Hanks worst role either. He has a way of infusing some degree of charm into his characters even when it barely makes sense, as moments of this film prove.That being said, obviously most people's reaction to this movie will be confusion. You can hype it all you want, but to say it is not confusing is a stretch. As I stated, it's not the acting that does it, but mainly the fact that the stories only loosely connect and it's awkward to have Berry and Hanks play all these characters as if to suggest that they were descendants of one another. This is especially confusing considering that reincarnation does appear to be a theme.After reading the Wikipedia page on this film's plot (a ritual I've grown accustomed to), the only thing I learned was that the individual stories are not intended to connect as much as I was trying to make them.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[11, 13]","They said this novel by David Mitchell could never be filmed, but the theme is simple: Everything is connected. Of course, these are the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix franchise) and this long-awaited film IS incredibly complicated... but simple: We follow a group of people whose reincarnated lives keep intersecting over the eons; in fact one observes ""...when this Mortal Coil becomes a noose...""This R-rated Sci Fi/Thriller/Romance/Comedy/Drama/Mystery/Actioner takes place in six different time periods and runs for 172 minutes (yes, almost three hours, that's why this review is so long). Each time period is fully realized and the story which unfolds for each era is fully developed. You will never be bored, you will rarely be confused and you will always be impressed. The Wachowskis are capable, confident filmmakers and Tom Tykwer (""Run Lola Run"") makes a third scriptwriter and director.""Cloud Atlas"" is a tone poem composed by one man and claimed by another; we see them both. Once we understand that, we can relax and play a game to see who can recognize each actor first. The makeup is brilliant, as a result some actors are really hard to spot! My Academy Award money goes on this gang for Art Direction and Makeup.Here are some of the featured players:* Tom Hanks (""Larry Crowne"") clearly relishes his chance to be a homicidal thug, an evil doctor, a gentle scientist, a book editor, a rough-hewn tattooed post-apocalyptic primitive, and a hotel clerk, even though it sometimes took a minute to realize that Mr. H was under that amazing makeup.* Halle Berry (""New Year's Eve"") rarely masks her beauty. The camera loves her no matter which era she is in, with one major exception: her gnarly old Korean man had me completely fooled.* Jim Broadbent (""The Iron Lady"") brings his comic chops to at least two of his roles: one is an arrogant composer and the other is a dishonest publisher. In four other eras, his makeup and acting were so good it took awhile to figure out who we were watching.* Hugo Weaving (""Captain America"") seems to be drawn to dastardly roles. No matter in which time period we spot him, he's still someone to avoid...including his Nurse Ratched, at the old folks' home.* Jim Sturgess (""One Day"") plays seven roles, not six. One of his characters provides the nicest romance....* Keith David (""Highway"") brings gravitas and stature to all four of his roles.* David Gyasi (""Red Tails"") plays only three characters, but they are pivotal. One in particular, while a rifle is aimed at him, is almost unbearable.* Hugh Grant (""About a Boy"") romps through his six reincarnations with great zest. His spooky ghoul had me fooled; I didn't recognize him until he was (deservedly) getting his throat cut!* Doona Bae (""As One"") brings her porcelain beauty to a key role: a reluctant voice for future generations. She disappears into her other five, playing other races and other ages.This is by no means all the important characters or actors. Suffice it to say, you have to pay attention, but you will be rewarded. To me, the fascinating episode with the cast of Asian look-alike women was the most chilling, although I was suitably incensed by the corporate skulduggery that we could tell had taken place in another one.Expect profanity (Tom Hank's thug!), nudity, blood, racism, gunfire, shocking violence, a wild Star Wars-type ride on a two-seat jet ski that zips through a futuristic sky, swords, knives, tension, some drug use, lots of comedy and a little romance.

I will certainly be anxious to see their next work.That said, I wanted to rate this story higher, but couldn't. Here's why.1.

I'd hoped for a more intriguing plot, given all the wonderfully moving parts, but neither came.3. The numerous story threads (all sometimes too familiar), no matter how exquisitely produced, were too numerous to allow the emotional investment that makes a good story great and memorable.

To show the weak directing and editing: In one scene something exciting is happening, and just when it starts to get really interesting, just when you start to think it may be related to a recent event, they cut away from it, and never mention it again! You will never know if the two events are connected, or what happened!!  Uh!I have just received a very well written comment from someone who loved both CLOUD ATLAS and THE MASTER.  He said that THE MASTER is more a bromance between two crazy people than an expos&eacute; on the founding of Scientology. I guess I really wanted THE MASTER to be an expos&eacute; type film.  Plus, like other reviewers have said, the Phoenix character is so hopelessly negative in every way that he just irritated me.I see why critics and The Academy loved THE MASTER.  It's an edgy, uncomfortable, strangely directed expos&eacute; on the founder of one of the biggest cults in the world.  But in THE MASTER they show you the beginnings of one man's experiments on clearing emotional struggles by using time travel of the soul instead of hypnotherapy, which sounds like a great idea, but they don't show you much about the organization or really ""expose"" anything important or interesting.  We've all probably heard about the little bit they do show at some point in our lives, so not only is it not an enjoyable movie, it's a complete waste of time.While in CLOUD ATLAS we are shown - in a very enlightening, most fascinating, and brutally honest way - the consequences of the actions of human beings through the centuries, and what happens to people in future lives, when they had been kind to people, and when they had been cruel.So which is better?  I say the one that was more enjoyable, and vastly more important, CLOUD ATLAS.Which movie was nominated for an Oscar? THE MASTER received three Acting Nominations, while CLOUD ATLAS was not nominated for any Oscars at all.  That's typical.  But if you would like to see two great movies about re-incarnation in the next few months...

I just wasn't on my radar, but then I saw the extended trailer three months ago and I was blown away by it. The scope and size of the film was astonishing and the unique themed story was really interesting. It also helped that the trailer had amazing music with it. Then there was the great cast with Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, Keith David, Halle Barry, Hugh Grand and more. After seeing all that in the extended trailer I was hooked and Cloud Atlas was a must see film for me. Yet even after I saw the trailer I didn't know it was based off a book with the same name and authored by David Mitchell. I didn't figure that out till a few weeks later and finally picked up the novel about two weeks ago. I am just about done with it and the novel is really well written with a great set of stories that interweave characters and themes as everything is connected. I remember reading online that the author David Mitchell said that his novel was un-filmable, and I think I'm going to have to agree with him. The six different stories, the books massive scope and range of characters I really don't see how the Wachowski siblings and Tom Tykwer could manage it and as it got closer and reviews came out they weren't glowing. Sure in general the film has gotten pretty good reviews but nothing glowing. Did that stop me from going to see the film hell no. Generally I don't listen to reviewers though when I went to the mid-day showing I toned down my anticipation of the film deciding not to get my hopes up. Did I enjoy the film is it any good? Keep reading to find out.Coming out of the theater I would have to say that no it wasn't a great film. Coming out of the theater I think I would have given it 3.5 to 4 stars, but as I made my way home and began to think about the film the more I began to love the film. That rarely happens for me. When I leave the theater and think about a film I rarely like it more and more in fact usually my rating will go down a little bit or stand pat. Cloud Atlas is a wonderfully beautiful messy film. All right let's take a look at what was truly great about this film.Cinematography (A): The film was beautifully made from Scotland to Germany the United States, Majorca and Hong Kong. The cinematographer and the camera men did an excellent job of capturing the beauty of the places they were filming whether it be from D&uuml;sseldorf and Glasgow, Scotland to Majorca Island (Which I had no idea existed until I stayed through the credits) to Hong Kong everything was filmed perfectly. The film should be nominated for an Oscar for this.Makeup/Costumes (A): I never talk about this in my reviews. I might passingly talk about it, but never really call it out, but the makeup and costume work was brilliantly done for this film. The characters had to play multiple characters in different times and different sexes and I was afraid it wouldn't work, but it really did. In certain times I didn't recognize Tom Hanks until I looked closely at the character. It shows how good an actor he which I'll get to in a little bit. Hugo Weaving played a woman head nurse at an old folk's home and he was almost completely unrecognizable at first. If there are two categories this film should win an Oscar in it should be for Costume Design and Best Makeup.Special Effects (A): The special effects were excellent, but we should expect that from a Wachowski directed and produced film. I've bashed on their directorial ability many times, but the siblings certainly know how to bring special effects into a film especially in Nea So Copros the city of the distant future. It was brought to life wonderfully as it was richly detailed. I forget all the names of the companies that helped bring this world and the rest of the film to life, but I believe ILM helped as did a company called RISE. Another category the film should be nominated for.Music (A): I loved the music in the trailers and the music in the film was remarkable as it also played an important part in the score. The score was done by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer. Tykwer also directed part of the film. I don't think I remember hearing to much about these men, but if I remember correctly Heil has mainly done music for television. The tone and pace of the music fit the film perfectly and was simply beautiful. I'm going to have to download or go out and buy the score for this film and it definitely should be nominated for original score heck I might even take this over The Dark Knight Rises score which I also loved.Acting (B+): The acting by the cast was extremely good as I mention Tom Hanks great job with his roles. I'm not going to mention them all it would take too much time and space. One of my favorite roles is Henry Goose a doctor in 1850 who slowly poisons Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) to get to his gold he has in a chest. Of course Hugo Weaving plays a bad guy in every role whether it be from an evil father in law or a nurse or to what I assume is some kind of police captain in Nea So Copros. What I really need to talk about are some of the actors and actresses who I didn't recognize and I think most Americans wouldn't recognize and in many parts stole the film. First there is Bae Doona. She is a South Korean actress who I don't think as acted in an American film before and she did an outstanding job. She played three characters, but the one that stood out was her role as Sonmi-451. I mean if there was one character that stood above the rest it was Sonmi. She was the most compelling of all of the characters as an engineered worker of the future, and Bae Donna captured the performance perfectly. Another actor I had never heard of before was James D'Arcy an English actor along with his fellow actor Jim Sturgess. Sturgess was also out the most standout performances besides Bae Donna. His two best performances and roles were Adam Ewing and Hae-Joo Chang. Yes he played an Asian character of the distant future and performed it well. Yes the acting in general was performed extremely well, but two actors seemed out of place, miscast or something else I can't quiet put my finger on. Those two are Susan Sarandon and Keith David. I love the actor Keith David he's a good actor who's been in many films I've enjoyed but he and Susan seemed to have just been sleepwalking through the film being overshadowed by all the other actors.Story (B+): I think this is what most people will have a problem with in this film is the story or better yet pacing of the film and how it was put together. The way the film bounced back and forth in time might have confused a lot of people. It wasn't a problem for me, but I can definitely see where people would have a problem with it. Most of the stories were well done, but there was one I had a problem with and that was the story called Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After which takes place in a post apoplectic world after the fall of civilization. It wasn't one thing that turned me off to this story it was a few things from the futuristic language I could barely understand and the plot that wasn't well flushed out it just didn't work for me.Directing (B): This is what I had the biggest problem with in the film was the directing and editing of the film. I know they wanted to show how our lives overlapped and our choices in the past affect our choices in the future, but the bouncing around in time wasn't always the best and I'm sure will confuse people. I personally enjoyed it and think it worked better than having it be linear going from the past to the future. Then there is the editing the directors did which also wasn't great. I'm sure this film was originally more than three hours long and had to be edited out and blended together with each director directing one part of the film and it wasn't perfectly put together. As for the directors and the directing of the film it was well done. I know I've bashed the Wachowski siblings on the directing ability. After their great success of the Matrix they did the very disappointing and needless sequels and then the bad Speed Racer. The siblings like to go over the top and be grandiose, but they did a good job with the futurist world and their directing as did Tom Tykwer. As I said I had never heard of the German filmmaker before, but he did an excellent job directing primarily the scenes in the past. This was a very ambitious undertaking for the directors, producer and studio and I think it paid off well.Author David Mitchell had said his novel couldn't be translated into film and after reading the novel I had agreed with him, but we were both wrong. Was the film a perfect translation no, but what novel is. Anyone who expects a perfect translation of a novel to film will be disappointed. Cloud Atlas is beautiful and ambitious film with excellent cinematography, makeup/costume design and special effects/action along great acting and story, and good directing. From what I've seen from other reviews no one hates the film. In fact I don't think I've seen a bad review. Most of the reviews say it's an average to amazing film depending on how well the story and characters captivate you, and they did for me. I highly recommend this film and the novel as well I don't think anyone will be disappointed.",5,A Wonderully Made and Beautiful Film,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,9359,"['Just', 'Branded', 'Hunger',

That was pretty much all I knew about it, so I'm about as close as you might find to a ""virgin"" viewer.I pity (if not fear for) anyone who was not moved by the tremendous currents of humanity (as in, humaneness) coursing throughout the film.  Yes, the numerous plot lines can be a bit confusing, and the future-dialect of Hanks & Barry & Sarandon is difficult to follow (try turning on subtitles?).  I also thought Hugo Weaving as Hanks' ""demon"" conscience (for lack of a better descriptive term) was rather obtusely introduced and depicted in cringe-inducing fashion.  Perhaps this was precisely the point, and you certainly can't fault Weaving for throwing himself into the role with his trademark zeal.Still, the ensemble cast is impressive for essentially the entire film, even though it can be a bit distracting (e.g., is that Jim Broadbent AGAIN?).  Honestly, the performances are tremendous -- I never once felt an actor or actress was out of their depth (although Doona Bae as an aging Latina sweatshop owner was too much of a reach -- and a waste of make-up!).  Jim Broadbent's escapades in trying to escape a prison-like retirement community had me in unexpected hysterics -- no mean feat.The prevailing theme, explored in myriad ways, is the unfolding tension between two competing world-views:  one, a crude oversimplification of the Nietzschean saw that ""the weak are meat,"" which ""the strong do eat.""  The other, that love is eternal, and the consequences of our actions -- particularly those that are noble or selfless -- ripple into eternity.  The vagaries of human behavior are on full display here, from the most heinous and base to the most inspired and inspirational.I never once felt bored or distracted through the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes, even though I was expecting something much shorter (I had it in my head that it was 1 hour 40 minutes long, for unknown reason).  Quite frankly, I didn't want it to end, or I wish they incorporated even more.Edifying cinematic experiences like this are far too few, so I intend to savor Cloud Atlas through my memory -- and periodic future viewings -- for the rest of my life.

Despite the epic story arc and mind-bending themes, I found myself distracted by what amounts to a complete failure of the movie's wardrobe and make-up department to deliver. That's a shame, especially when there is so much good acting here, none of which is delivered by Tom Hanks this time. And the sound editing; simply dreadful. Please take the advice of another reviewer and turn the captions on because you won't understand a lot of what is being said, especially in the post-apocalyptic future where cave people living in Hawaii somehow sound like they're from Alabama. There's also the matter of the movie's first half, which meanders so far and wide that you're almost tempted to turn the movie off. I admit I am glad I stuck with it despite the afore mentioned misgivings. The second half of the movie wakes from its slumber, quickens its pace, and begins to weave all the threads together with results that are often heartbreaking yet nonetheless bespeak of hope.

I was intrigued with the theme of the film with its mixture of lives interwoven in the fabric of time.  After watching this movie for 3 hours, (Yes it is a long one), I will say that the movie has a very complex storyline and I could see why theatergoers had a difficult time with it.  I think I gained a better understanding watching comfortably at home trying to grasp the concepts in this than I would have been at the theater.

I thought some of the stories within the movie played better than others and were more entertaining at times to the extent that some of these could have been movies on there own.The movie was done well however, I think could have been weaved together a bit more smoothly for people like me that aren't familiar with the book.

Possibly some meaningful pieces were removed on the editor's chop block.The underlying theme is reincarnation, how we live many lives and experience many different roles as we move from one lifetime to the next.  The film also demonstrates the polarity principle in our experiences.  We may be ""good"" in one lifetime, and ""bad"" in the next.  (We may also be a black male one time and a white female the next, or filthy rich one lifetime, and beggar poor the next.)  It is said that these things broaden our life experiences.  We can argue if they are true or not until the cows come home.There are other underlying themes in the movie that we are all connected, all have choices, and all decide what we want to accomplish in this lifetime before we are born.  Sometimes the roles we are given to play are for the greater good.  These are all concepts from many of the books I have personally read.  So, while I understood what the movie was saying, I felt it just did not quite bring the point home well enough.  The action parts of the movie picked up toward the end, and the summary at the end helped.  The movie also skipped around a lot, between the various reincarnated lifetimes of several characters.All-in-all, it was interesting, but. . .

Its six intertwined stories span the period between 1849 and 2321, with Tom Hanks and others playing multiple parts: the son-in-law of a plantation owner in 1849, a gay composer in 1936, an African-American woman reporter in 1973, a 65-year-old publisher in 2012, an enslaved clone in 2144, and three societies in 2321. Highlights for me were Hugo Weaving as the English female Nurse Noakes facing a pub full of Scots; and the Neo Seoul action scenes. Every actor is stellar in this movie. Some viewers have complained about the quirky dialect of the far-future society, but I think it fits. The quick introduction to six stories was jarring for a minute or so, but after that I liked how they were woven together by theme (slavery or conformism) or event (a book, symphony, or assassination), instead of sitting through each story individually. There is language, sex, and blood in appropriate measure for the storyline. The ending for the far-future people was excellent. I watched Cloud Atlas (2012) with my parents and university-age sister.

Tom Hanks (Forest Gump, Catch me If You Can), Halle Berry (X-Men, Die Another Day), Hugo Weaving (Pricilla Queen of the Desert, The Matrix Trilogies) and Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge, Harry Potter) all gave tour de force performances, that, along with the film itself and the directors, I would be very surprised if not one or all of them did receive Academy Award nominations. They were that amazing!I couldn't begin to tell you how unique and dynamic each of their performances were because they all played at least six, sometimes seven completely different characters with amazing make-up changes done by supervisor Heiki Merker (Goodbye Lenin, The Physician).A special note goes to Japanese actress Bea Doona (The Host, Take Care Of My Cat) - she was incredibly haunting in all of the seven roles she played. Two of the roles were male! They were all completely different and masked in her various make-ups, costumes and character nuances, she is vibrant. I would nominate her for several awards.The story is set in the past, the near past, the present, the near future and the far future. You sail aboard the classic ships of the 1800's one minute and the you are racing on the futuristic light-hover highway of the year 2144. Mixed in conspiracy, drama, greed, envy, ego and throw in a same-sex love affair, all with the intent of the message of making decisions, good or bad, in your life can and does follow you throughout time.Three directors were needed on this film and for a very good reason. It is so complicated and detailed that it would have probably taken three more years to make if they didn't. Tom Tykwer  (Perfume, The International) directed the sequences called `Letters From Zedelghem,' `Half Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery' and `The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish'.  While Andy Wachowski (The Matrix Trilogies, Speed Racer) and Lana Wachowski (Speed Racer, The Matrix Trilogies) directed `The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing', ' An Orison of Sonmi -451' and `Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After'.The music was inspiring (three composers) Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer; the visuals were dynamic and the cinematography by Frank Greibe (Run Lola Run, Perfume) and John Toll (Braveheart, The Last Samuri) was so dynamic and awe-inspiring it was pure candy to the eye.Writers Lana Wachowski (Speed Racer, The Matrix Trilogies), Tom Tykwer  (Perfume, The International) and Andy Wachowski (The Matrix Trilogies, Speed Racer) did an amazing job of mixing SIX, yes SIX stories with the most complex and intriguing intertwining of character archetypes  and drama from the original book written by David Mitchell.This was a wonderful, mystical, magical film, filled with passion and heart and a true metaphysical and philosophical concepts of how our past affects our present and our present affects our future and how certain people, patterns, action and memories may guide our lives through good and bad times. Keep in mind all these six stories are intertwined and happening at the same time. It is a long feature, about 2 hours and 52 minutes long, yet is has amazing performances by the entire cast in each story. See the film, then come back to this review and see all the characters everyone played intertwined over the whole film below.

1585829,ANGNKTK2J7JFF,B0095HHM78,Madeline,"[1, 1]","I went to see this movie in theaters solely because it was directed by the Wachowskis. I love the Matrix, and trusted them to have made a fun action movie. I left the theater still almost in tears knowing I had just seen one of the most profound and brilliant movies to have been made in the last decade.Critics say that it's confusing. This is true for about the first 40 minutes. The stories aren't told sequentially in chunks, but are spliced into each others. That plus the fact that several of the actors play multiple parts--is a perfect recipe for confusion. However, if you've been trying to pay attention and have any amount of reasonable intelligence, the characters and separate story lines soon become clear and distinct. And in a way, they all end up being the same.This is the brilliance of Cloud Atlas. These stories are radically different--different times, planets, people, plots, and yet they tell the same story. I know the writer's original intention was basically a ""we are all connected, and our actions affect others,"" but this wasn't what I really felt. I saw all of the stories as moments of redemption.***Spoiler*** I normally can't stand movies that kill off main characters or have generally depressing endings, and yet this movie needed the moments of sadness to help further the story. And I actually didn't leave sad. If the movie had focused solely on say the couple where one of them commits suicide, I would have felt gypped and would not be raving about this movie at all. And yet, each story while interesting, emotional and sometimes hilarious--is just a part of the whole story. And the whole story taken together just hits you in the gut. It made me laugh, made me cry and made me think.I dislike both Halle Berry and Tom Hanks as actors, and it didn't matter in the slightest. They played their parts to perfection (especially Hanks). The settings and costumes from each time period are also on point. And I was right in that the Wachowskis also delivered a cinematically stunning movie as well. However, unlike the Matrix--where you can get caught up in the action just because it looks so cool, the action and general stylism used here is not just here for the sake of being cool. The stories wouldn't have worked if you were constantly being drawn out of them or distracted. Here, the stylism actually propels the story. It's necessary to keep the stories just slightly outside of the realm of reality. In becoming fantastical looking, the viewer can then simply focus on the story which in turn actually makes the stories more real.There is not a doubt in my mind that all three directors are simply genius. I think it's ridiculous that this movie got such bad press, honestly--I can't help but think that those who didn't enjoy it simply weren't smart enough or more likely didn't bother to engage themselves with the material. This isn't Transformers or even James Bond. Thinking is required to enjoy. But instead of this being tedious, this movie can affect a person in a way that a movie like Red Dawn (just a recent example) never can. This movie deserved the Best Picture Oscar for 2013.

The top notch ensemble cast, great acting, terrific script, and multiple plot and story lines really put the movie in a category by itself. Then there's the amazing makeup jobs, as each actor often appears four, five, or six times in different roles, sometimes even changing gender (the Susan Sarandon male character was amazing) and looks completely different each time. This movie would have required a whole team of makeup artists. Whoever they were my hat's off to them, and whoever the head makeup technician was he or she was probably exhausted by the end of this movie trying to manage it all and keep everything on schedule.Many people have already discussed the Buddhist themes of the movie, so I'll just say that the way the movie unfolds over 500 years as each character is born and reborn into a completely different life made for a very ambitious and complex movie as the settings, characters, and story/plot are completely different each time. The movie follows a small group of people whose lives are inextricably intertwined, and their lives continue to cross and re-cross with the cycle of birth and rebirth throughout the movie. The constant changes in time and place make much greater demands on the viewer's attention, so be forewarned that it's probably not a movie to watch if you're just looking for some relaxing, mindless entertainment after a tough day on the job. Just the amount of violence in the movie may put some viewers off as can be seen from some of the reviews and comments here.I never read the book as I don't read much fiction these days, but this movie really made me want to pick up the book and it's now on my short list.

1585842,A129YBX5BVNW2,B0095HHM78,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","In some respects - bringing David Mitchell&#8217;s five hundred page prize-winning book to the screen was always going to be a challenge &#8211; and the outcome &#8211; hotly debated. With six different stories interweaving while several culturally different lead characters overlap in different time frames and even parallel worlds (past, present and future) &#8211; the result was either going to enthral or irritate. And 2012's &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; manages to pull off both with a great deal of aplomb.Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; as an independent production with a budget in excess of $100 million (a huge amount for an Indie flick) - this is bravura filmmaking &#8211; hugely ambitious, daring, technically amazing - and mad as Mr. Loony McMad of the Clan Bonkers. I loved it &#8211; but others may feel that it&#8217;s just a load of arty-farty pretentious twaddle &#8211; and after watching its near 3 hours - be in need of a serious &#34;Call The Midwife&#34; bender just to get their real world bearings back.Ok here goes. It begins in the Pacific Islands in 1849 (don&#8217;t they all) where Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess of &#34;Across The Universe&#34;) is crossing a shale beach and meets the decidedly odd and slightly seedy Doctor Goose (one of six parts for a stunning Tom Hanks). This leads to a dinner discourse with a reverend and his wife (Hugh Grant and Susan Sarandon) &#8211; after which we see Ewing visiting their plantation in blistering heat and seeing first hand the lashing of Autua &#8211; a Moriori slave tied to a totem pole (David Gyasi). Ewing is overcome and faints. Waking up he finds himself being tended to by the jabbering Dr. Goose (whose noticed Ewing has a key around his neck to a chest of valuables). Ewing naively suspects nothing. Then on a ship at sea - the hideous and greedy Doctor Goose begins poisoning Ewing in earnest. Autua (who has stowed away on board) stops the final lethal dose and Ewing takes the dark man home with him to the USA &#8211; where he and his wife are involved in the movement to abolish slavery.We flick forward now to Cambridge in England in 1936 where a young composer called Robert Frobisher  (Ben Whishaw &#8211; the new &#34;Q&#34; in Bond's &#34;Skyfall&#34;) is desperately seeking 'fame and fortune'. He&#8217;s writing a musical masterpiece called &#34;The Cloud Atlas Sextet&#34; based on the chronicles of Adam Ewing. He has a birthmark on his back that looks like a comet and a gay lover in his bed &#8211; Rufus Sixsmith. But Frobisher wants that shiny 'fame' - so he goes to work in Edinburgh for a different kind of devil - the aging and arrogant composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent of &#34;Any Human Heart&#34;). Ayrs hasn&#8217;t written anything of substance for decades because of illness but recognizes the young Frobisher&#8217;s stunning melody played on the piano one day - and as his employer &#8211; tries to claim the meisterwork as his own. Feeling dumped on by his employer and spurned by both his muse and his lover (a misconception on his part) - Robert climbs into an empty bathtub and puts a German Luger into his mouth&#8230;Now we are decades later in San Francisco in 1973 &#8211; and Rufus Sixsmith (the lover of Robert Frobisher played in both scenes by James D&#8217;Arcy) is an old man - and now an eminent nuclear physicist. By chance he holds open a lift in an office building for a woman who has just left a drunken boor at a party (&#34;The age of chivalry is not dead!&#34;). Louise Rey is a beautiful and brave journalist who works for Spyglass Magazine (Halle Berry &#8211; again one of six parts) who thinks she&#8217;s onto something about a billionaire oil company man called Lloyd Hooks (a sensationally good Hugh Grant &#8211; another one of six parts) and a nuclear power station. Hooks hires a hitman to take the journo out. And Louise&#8217;s car - along with a damning report from Sixsmith - are forced off a bridge. But she&#8217;s not about to be put off by a little corporate drowning&#8230;and eventually exposes the monster (who may return in later guises)&#8230;Then there&#8217;s the society rebel Tilda in Neo Seoul in 2144 and Dermot the dog rough Irish author of &#34;Knuckle Sandwich&#34; in London&#8217;s 2012 who literally throws a critic off a balcony. And on it goes to a future world where Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving and Susan Sarandon (and an unrecognizable Hugh Grant) live in a post apocalyptical environment of simplicity and spaceships that visit every now and then. It&#8217;s over 100 winters after &#34;The Fall&#34; - an event that has wiped much of civilization &#8211; and now people speak a form of gobbledygook English - and cannibals on horses roam the earth with full-body tattoos and huge carving blades.It ends off-world &#8211; sat under the stars by a campfire at night - an old man (Hanks) telling tales to enrapt children about all that went before &#8211; and how we are all connected - and must look out for each other if we&#8217;re to survive&#8230;Directed by Tom Tykwer and both of The Wachowski Brothers (&#34;The Matrix&#34;) &#8211; the visuals across all time frames are truly stupendous (even stretched to Full Screen aspect). It&#8217;s a looker on the BLU RAY format and originals come with a natty shining card slipcase.The BLU RAY special features are impressively indepth with loads of featurettes on the 'making of' with all the actors clearly enthused about the whole history-bending thing. Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio: English 5.1, Dolby Digital, Castilian Spanish 5.1, French 5.1, English 5.1 Audio Descriptive Service while Subtitles are in Castilian Spanish, English and French.Perhaps because it opens with Hanks mumbling largely unrecognizable words (future English) &#8211; it annoys from the very start &#8211; but this is the kind of film that repeated viewing will show just how deep the narrative and adapted-script is. &#34;Ancestry howling at you&#8230;&#34; Hank&#8217;s character says. The breath of this thing is monumental &#8211; and at times threatens to overwhelm everything. And yet I felt it didn&#8217;t. You are grasping to connect the dots on occasion for sure &#8211; but that&#8217;s half the fun &#8211; and the actors get to go to places on a huge amount of differing levels.In the end - is it all about slavery &#8211; about how evil simply changes faces and forms as time goes on - or about the connections that bind us all - is there a &#34;method in this tale of madness&#34;?  This movie reminds me of Jaco Van Dormael&#8217;s ingenious &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34; &#8211; a multi-layered Sci-Fi storytelling extravaganza from 2009 that&#8217;s just as wild and brave in its scope (and he got there first).&#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; is ambitious stuff - and as one of the extras tells us &#8211; it&#8217;s &#34;A Film Like No Other&#34;.

1585843,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B0095HHM78,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[11, 38]","This is a very long film made up of a bunch of short stories that are mostly disconnected from each other. As I have not read the book, I can't say if the failure was in the original material or capturing the original material on film. But for me, the stories told in the film don't connect with each other enough to really tell an overall story. The story also lacks any sort of payoff in the end.The one thing I can think of to compare it to is D. W. Griffith's ""intolerance"" from 1916. There are some vague similiarities in structure and intent.The film also has a basic conflict in directorial styles built into it. Tom Tykwer handled the complicated human stories within the film while the Wachowskis were called in for the Japanese homage swipes. The Wachowskis populate the film with all their now familiar cliche material. I guess it speaks to the visual and philosophical strength of ""Ghost in the Shell"" that the Wachowskis continue to do so very well mining it for material.The music (not the ""cloud atlas"" itself) in the film was good (sometimes great). Some of the philosphical lines in the film worked, others didn't. The success of the big lines often depended on how well the story elements supported them. Often those story elements didn't support them enough. Too often the story is caught up in big ideas and loses touch with the meaning of small human interconnections. Too often the film falls back on simple matters of freedom versus totaltarism or slavery of one sort or another where there are always easy answers and a clear moral path.For a film about big ideas, the ending was very shallow indeed. Walking away from the consequences of your actions is an often popular choice, but not a philosophically brave choice.",2,a bunch of disconnected short stories,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1743,"['very', 'long', 'film', 'made', 'up', 'bunch', 'short', 'stories', 'are', 'mostly', 'disconnected', 'other', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'failure', 'was', 'original', 'material', 'capturing', 'original', 'material', 'film', 'stories', 'told', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'other', 'enough', 'really', 'tell', 'overall', 'story', 'story', 'also', 'sort', 'payoff', 'end.The', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'compare', 'D.', 'W.', 'Griffith', 'intolerance', '1916', 'are', 'vague', 'similiarities', 'structure', 'intent.The', 'film', 'also', 'basic', 'conflict', 'directorial', 'styles', 'built', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'handled', 'complicated', 'human', 'stories', 'film', 'Wachowskis', 'were', 'called', 'Japanese', 'homage', 'swipes', 'Wachowskis', 'populate', 'film', 'now', 'familiar', 'cliche', 'material', 'guess', 'visual', 'philosophical', 'strength', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Wachowskis', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'mining', 'material.The', 'music', 'not', 'cloud', 'atlas', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'sometimes', 'great', 'philosphical', 'lines', 'film', 'worked', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'success', 'big', 'lines', 'often', 'depended', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'elements', 'supported', 'story', 'elements', 'did', ""n't"", 'support', 'enough', 'Too', 'often', 'story', 'caught', 'up', 'big', 'ideas', 'touch', 'meaning', 'small', 'human', 'interconnections', 'Too', 'often', 'film', 'back', 'simple', 'matters', 'freedom', 'versus', 'totaltarism', 'slavery', 'one', 'sort', 'where', 'are', 'always', 'easy', 'answers', 'clear', 'moral', 'path.For', 'film', 'big', 'ideas', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'shallow', 'indeed', 'Walking', 'away', 'consequences', 'actions', 'often', 'popular', 'choice', 'not', 'philosophically', 'brave', 'choice']",Cloud Atlas

Cloud Atlas was absolutely engrossing but you have to be willing to think just a little a little bit to enjoy it.  Cloud Atlas is six stories across an enormous period of time that are all interwoven.  Because the same actors appear in each segment it is easy to get caught up in trying to figure out which actors are playing which characters as the film moves from story to story (who knew that Hugh Grant could play a brute savage in war paint?) If you engage in tracking the actors then you will miss subtle points in the stories that are important.I am now reading the novel and this is one of those cases where I really do wish I'd read the novel first before seeing the film as I think I would have better understood - or at least caught on a bit quicker - as to what was going on.Entertaining, thoughtful and visually stunning.

I say this not to inspire sympathy, but to note what kind of film this and that I may need to watch it more than once (which I most certainly will!). Hopefully, I hope to those that read enjoy.It's weird how things turn out and what people react to certain artworks. One man's masterpiece is another man's garbage. Another's favorite author is on another person's all time most hated author's list. One person worship a welcome franchise while another wishes to go up in flames. All works react differently to others, and sometimes, its fascinating to see how others react to it. Such is the case of Cloud Atlas.Cloud Atlas came out during the Oscar season of 2012 to a very mixed reception. Based on the book of the same name by David Mitchell (who gets a nice little cameo near the end of the film!), the film sported currently sports a 67% on Rotten Tomatoes and while that usually implies a mixed to positive response, looking at the actual responses of critics was something else entirely. To illustrate; The late and great Roger Ebert remarked the film as being one of the most ambitious pictures ever made and even made a nice mention on his end of the year list. On the other, TIME magazine said the film was one of the worst, if not the worst, film of the year.So where do I stand in the skies of Atlas? Well, from the first few minutes of the film, I knew I something in for something different. Atlas is a film that hits spans the emotional spectrum in a bunch of different ways; One moment, you'll be laughing at the absurdity of one segment of a man trying to pay the debts of a couple gangsters; The next, being enthralled by intense action and sociopolitical messages of a futuristic Korea ruled by ruthless capitalism and extremely bright scenery. It all paints the way for a sprawling, fantastical and massive story.The film is has about 6 different stories going on at the same time, from decade to decade to century, etc. All of the film's stories are interconnected in someway, shape or form. One person's life is read in another decade while another's actions are seen as heroics and godly-like worship. Reincarnation is the name of the game and the film has a field day with this subject. The order of the segments is as follows (which is also lovingly introduced to the audience in an ordered manner) :The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing: The story of a dying man (Jim Sturgess) traveling from New Zealand to the United States while dealing with a parasite that's killing him, his doctor (Tom Hanks) and a black stowaway (David Gyasi) he becomes buds with. This story is set in 1859.Letters From Zedelghem: Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw), a bisexual composer, works with a aging musician (Jim Broadbent) to help him compose new music, which leads us to the film's musical motif, The Cloud Atlas Sextet. This story is set in 1931.Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery: Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) is a reporter for a small time magazine and soon finds her self in a corporate conspiracy that could cost her life. This story is set 1973.The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish: A publisher (Jim Broadbent) finds himself dealing with psychotic gangsters and an oppressive retirement home in an attempt to pay off a couple of debts and reunite with the love of his life (Susan Sarandon). This story is 2012.An Orison of Sonmi-451: A Brave New World meets Blade Runner story about a clone (Doona Bae) who works at a McDonald's-esque restaurant and becomes friends with a freedom fighter (Jim Sturgess). This story takes place in 2144.Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin After: Set 106 years after to Sonmi-451 segment (and apparently after the end of the world), this one tells the tale of a native named Zachry (Tom Hanks) and his life with a tribe on the islands of Hawaii. He also meets a woman named Meronym (Halle Berry), a member from a sec of technologically advanced humans that observes the villagers from time to time.If there was ever a word to describe Atlas, it would most certainly be ambitious.The sheer scale of the film and its cast brings to mind the great big blockbusters you'd see in the summer movie season, rather than an Oscar film. There's a wealth of things for the audience to experience here, even with its all over the place narrative. For an almost three hour film, the film moves by awfully quickly. There's almost never dull moment, with each segment constantly showing you something new and never slowing down.However, as much as I like this bold perspective, it does come with some problems. At times, I would almost wish the film would abandon its way and just play the segments individually or at least playing them in massive chunks rather than what I see here. It can end up slightly ruining the moment of one part, in which I feel like I'm forced to switch from feeling tearful and weary to excited in a minute.Acting wise, everyone in the film is giving their all and its surprising to see actors play people we would never expect to see them do in a million years. Would you ever expect Tom Hanks to play an unpleasant Cockney gangster or an evil, greedy doctor? Or Hugh Grant play a corrupt executive or a cannibal tribesman? Course not, but its frankly miraculous to see everyone doing something different. And this is where the film's makeup comes into play, transforming actors into entirely different people. While some of it can look pretty obvious (the segments in Korea have attracted some backlash due to some of the Caucasian actors made to look Asian), most of the time, I'd find myself baffled at who was what, especially when the end credits reveals who played who.Outside of the makeup, the film itself is a technical and audio marvel, thanks to cinematographer John Toll (The Thin Red Line, Iron Man 3, The Last Samurai). The Korean segments in particular, are frankly astonishing to look at and the costume design is equally up to snuff. On the audio side of things, the magnificent score by director Tom Tykwer, Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil is something that sweeps the audience of its feet. The Cloud Atlas Sextet, the film's musical motif  shows in a bunch of different ways and I always find myself humming to its notes, inspiring a strange sense of hope and wonder.At times, Atlas can feel saccharine and sentimental with its themes (both literal and figuratively) and yet...there's a genuine feel of magic to the whole affair. When you laugh or yelp a squeal of excitement, it feels as it is earned, not forced, despite my aforementioned problems with the segment placement. It's a movie that deserves to be watched more than once, examined and thought about. It's a film that can be and will be argued till the end of time of its merits, whether it'd be seen as a masterpiece or a disaster. And you know what?I'm actually okay with that.And to cap of this review, I leave you with this quote from the main character of the Timothy Cavendish story:""While my extensive experience as an editor has ledd me to a disdain for flashbacks and flash forwards and all such tricksy gimmicks I believe that if you, dear Reader, can extend your patience for just a moment, you will find that there is a

I finally got a chance to see it on Blu-ray, and man I'm sorry I didn't go see it sooner.This is hands down the best movie I've seen in years. Even at 3 hours running time, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. I can't remember the last time a movie had me fully engrossed on this level. The style of the film, having multiple stories across multiple timelines all tying into one another in various ways, directly and indirectly, is ambitious to say the least. The fact that it succeeds in remaining cohesive and interesting throughout is a feat in and of itself, but it goes one step further by telling stories that would all hold up on their own, with characters you genuinely grow to love.I won't even attempt to give a plot synopsis, as that would take many paragraphs, but suffice it to say that the movie is about life, art, love, and fate, and how each life effects one another. It may sound corny when summed up into those four simple words, but the movie is so genuine in the presentation of it's message that it's hard not to be moved by it. The writers did a fantastic job crafting such a bold story.The actors had quite a challenge making this movie. They all play multiple characters throughout the film, and each character they play is different. Wildly different. Each actor had to portray several characters with different personalities, different accents, different ages, races, and even genders. We often see actors play several characters across several movies, but they remain the same character within each movie. It was really impressive to see the same actor play many roles within the same movie and pull it off.The special effects are top notch, and never look fake or cheesy. One thing I was surprised by was the amount of action in the movie. I didn't expect much action, and although it isn't on the level of a Michael Bay movie, there is certainly more than enough to satisfy fans of previous Wachowski movies like The Matrix. The movie is beautiful, with detailed sets and costumes, lots of CGI enhanced backgrounds, and gorgeous cinematography. Interestingly, because the focus of the movie is on the characters and not on the action, and the action is used sparingly, it brought more weight to the action when it happened. The stakes were higher because characters can and do die throughout the movie, and you're emotionally invested in them.Now, good makeup and special effects do not a good movie make. Fortunately for Cloud Atlas, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is through the deft hands of the directors that everything comes together to make an unforgettable experience.If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it now. If you have a Blu-ray player, the stunning visuals demand HD viewing. Don't be dissuaded by the negative, jaded critics.

It even ran out of funding at one point but all the people were so enthusiastic they took cuts and pressed on from what the Wiki claims.I liked how actors and actresses played several roles (male and female of varying ages) and some of them I didn't recognize until the end credits rolled. The star-studded cast included: Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, James D'Arcy, Jim Broadbent and a host of others.Hugo Weaving plays the pessimistic voice that ""It will never work"" just as Elrond to his daughter in LORD OF THE RINGS. I found that quite amusing.Tom Hanks plays a villain in one of the story angles which was a nice change and nothing I have ever seen him do as he's always the ""good guy"".Reincarnation themes and spirituality connecting humanity's souls are prevalent.I agree with film critic Roger Ebert that this was quite an ambitious film. It took me by surprise quite nicely. The Golden Globes nominated it for Best Original Score and the Academy Awards nominated it for Best Visual Effects.The budget was a bit over $100M and it cleared a bit over $130M at the Box Office.

1585884,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0095HHM78,M. Oleson,"[13, 16]","I suspect this is one of those films that most people will fall into a love it or hate it camp.  It is long (just short of 3 hours), complicated and controversial.  Actors Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Halle Berry, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw and Hugh Grant play half a dozen roles and another handful of actors have 3 or more characters.  Unless you know ahead of time, you will have a hard time identifying some of the actors.  That certainly is part of the fun.It is nearly impossible to try to describe a plot or a story, so let me just say that there is a connection between the characters that strongly suggest a minimum of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and the probability of reincarnation.  The six stories cover a period from 1849 to 2349 and somehow the directors and co-writers (Lana and sibling Andy Wachowski along with Tom Tykwer) and especially editor Alexander Berner, make the transition between the segments amazingly seamless.  It will take me another viewing or two to come close to making all the links but suffice it to say, it's all there.What is interesting is that each actor's character does not necessarily have the same values or personality in another segment.  There is an evolution of sorts that is transpiring.  In that the individual stories cover half a millennium, it is remarkable that each segment is handled so beautifully when it comes to the technical aspects of the production.  In any one scene we see a sailing ship crossing an ocean transition to a 1970's reporter investigating a potential nuclear cover-up and on to a futuristic battle for human survival.

I am, however, giving it 3 stars assuming that rating is &#8220;it's ok&#8221; vs. 2, &#8220;I didn't like it&#8221;.  Because, despite my complaints, which are multitude, I didn't feel like it was a total waste of my time.I obtained this movie to watch based on &#8220;Tom Hanks&#8221; and nothing else. That won't be happening again. I didn't watch it for ages though.  Seeing it sitting around yesterday (12-16-13) I looked at the IMDB blurb and thought, &#8220;This might be interesting.&#8221;  I didn't read any reviews.I had the idea this was a time travel movie.  See Tom Hanks old, see Tom Hanks much younger in scenes close together... I don't think that assumption was a leap.  But that really isn't what's going on in this movie.  While trying to think what it is like, I remember that as a child my mother would buy me connect the dot books.  Connect the dots correctly....  Elephant!  Hooray!This movie has dots galore. I wasn't connecting the dots, or if I was connecting the dots it was turning out to be a dream-catcher, not a movie. I did get that it was a series or parallel of stories and I was able to &#8220;care&#8221; about several of the stories as they hopped and skipped about, but it wasn't going to mold itself into the science fiction time travel movie I had been suspected in the beginning.Maybe if I watched it a few times or if it had closed captions I would have liked it more.  I'm still pretty sure it was like movies that start in the middle, go to the end, and end with the beginning. But this movie was juggling several stories at once while doing that jumble the plot thing.  I think.  Probably why some people raved about the movie as genius.  I'll be calling BS on that one.There was one part where I had a &#8220;moment&#8221; that I really enjoyed.  Others probably not.  It was where one of Hank's &#8220;native&#8221; characters was talking gibberish to an anthropologist (I think).  I think that because the &#8220;advanced&#8221; person slipped in and out of talking &#8220;normal&#8221; and talking gibberish when addressing Hank's character.  What sort of surprised me is I cogged the gibberish.  True, true.I won't go so far as to say, &#8220;Don't waste your time.&#8221;  I've read some reviews now and some folks really like it.  I'm guessing if you like to put jigsaw puzzles together while knitting, this movie would add pleasantly to your entertainment time.  Or not.  Your mileage may vary.

There are six separate stories in the movie, set in the 1840's Pacific, the 1930's Cambridge, the 1970's San Francisco, today's London, the 2100's Neo Seoul, and a post-apocalytic story set ""106 winters after Fall"". Because of the sheer size and volume of these separate stories, it took me about an hour into the movie to just get a handle less or more on what is happening. That is not a complaint. It is simply stating the epic parameters of the movie.It is truly impossible to bring a nice synopsis of these 6 different stories, and suffice to say that common themes eventually arise from these stories: ""Our lives are not our own, we are all connected with others, past and present"". This is of course emphasized in the fact that the lead actors perform multiple roles, none more so than Tom Hanks and Hale Berry, who star in all six stories. It is utter fun to see the transformation in the various roles, and for that my hat off to Hale Berry and the make-up team as she truly looks amazingly different in her different roles, including being a German (read: caucasion) Jewish woman, and even better as an Asian old man (yes, man!). Just wow. Also noteworthy is Hugh Grant, who appears in 4 or 5 (I lost track after a while) widely varying roles. Of all the stories, I liked the one set in 2144 in ""Neo Seoul"" the best, as it brings a Blade Runner-reminding atmosphere and of course the Wachowskis are right at home in such a futuristic setting (not just the Matrix but check also Speed Racer).If you think that you are in for a neat little wrap-up of everything at the end of the almosr 3 hr. movie, you might be wrong. Just for that fact, I'd love to see an alternative ""cut"" of this movie, in which the six stories are not ""blended"", as they are in the movie. I read somewhere that the production cost alone of this movie was about $100 million, making it the most expensive ""indie"" movie ever (it was financed primarily out of Germany, believe it or not). No way this movie will come anywhere close to that number at the box office in the US. All that aside, this is by no means a ""bad"" movie. It is an interesting experiment in which the ambition is greater than the execution. Viewers beware.",4,"3.5 stars...

From cramming six stories into its three hours to having actors take on so many varied roles, it truly is a movie like no other and it's all the better for it. The film simply tells six stories, jumping around back and forth between the different stays.  What makes it work though is it helps the viewer see the connections they are trying to make.The beginning can be a little confusing until you figure out the structure.  Then it becomes very rewarding as the film starts to fall together in the end.  IT's coupled with some very amazing performaces, with Ben Whimshaws possibly being the standout dramatic performance.  The one who seems to be having the most fun is Hugo Weaving, who gets to play a femal nurse in one part.The visuals are stunning, from the ocean landscapes depicted in the 1800s to the futuristic Neo-Soul and the post apocolyptic world that followed.  The movie's on target and the locations are continually interesting throughout the film.  Kudos the directors for making the varied settings fun and authentic.Many reviewers remark on the confusing plot structure, but if you pay attention, it comes together.

I head grumblings from various people about the very long run-time of the movie (around 3-1/2 hours), but that did not bother me, and actually I learned my lesson once before when I refused to go see ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" in the theater due to its length, and later viewed it on DVD and loved it.  So first off, don't let the length scare you off.  In this case, the length only enhances the experience, as you truly become engrossed in the story...I came out of the movie wanting more.Another negative I heard going in, was that the movie jumped around a lot, and that it was distracting and hard to follow.  True it did jump around a bit, between the different stories told in different time periods, but I found that neither hard to follow, nor distracting.  In fact, I found it masterful the way the stories all tied in to one another, and the flow of the story in and out of these periods kept my interest peaked at all times.  I hate to use the cliche that it is a ""thinking person's movie"", but it is.  It is not something to kill a few hours watching for something to do, it is an experience.The casting, the acting, the costume, and special effects were all great, and I would give them all 5-stars on their own, but it was none of those that made me enjoy this movie as much as I did, it was the story.  It was happy, it was sad, it was funny, it was inspiring, and it was action-packed, all in one (or should I say all in six).  I felt a real connection to the characters in this film, which I find to be rare these days.  This is a story for action fans, drama fans, sci-fi fans, thriller fans, it really is a story for a broad base of movie-goer.

It goes through several phases. First the setting up of each scenario: in the 1840s on the high seas, in the 1930s in Europe, in the 1970s in California, present-day England, a couple centuries hence in ""Neo-Seoul"", and a in primitive setting (initially) far in the future. In the first phase you start out confused, don't see how there can be any relation between the scenarios, and brace for two and a half hours of disappointment. But then, slowly, themes repeat, and it starts to come together. We fully enter the new phase where the scenario shifts start to occur much more quickly, and they are clever: each scene dovetails into the next from another time with a similar situation, or word or phrase, or theme, or physical location. Then all six stories start to reach their climaxes, and the time-switching switches into high gear. Here there's a lot of Wachowski-trademarked intense violence (although no slow-fast motion martial arts, a la The Matrix (well, close, in Neo-Seoul (get it? Neo?))).

All that for a LONG 170 minutes or so of my time?"".Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and it is generally crisp and clear.The colours in many of the stories have been manipulated to produce a stronger and striking contrast while viewing.Extras are one featurette.All in all,if tales of fighting against authority,doing the right thing,all mixed up with a little reincarnation turn your crank,then this one is for you.But I found it's story and story hopping tedious at best and its' length horrifically too long.Not recommended.2-2 1/2 stars.",2,A premise poorly executed,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,2414,"['Cloud', 'Atlas', 'released', 'Sept/12', 'plethora', 'stars', 'amongst', 'are', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'Doona', 'Bae', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Hugh', 'Grant.There', 'are', 'six', 'stories', 'here', 'ranging', '19th', 'century', '24th.The', 'first', 'doctor', 'trip', 'South', 'Pacific', 'behalf', 'father', 'slavery', 'wrong.The', 'second', 'gay', 'composer', 'teaming', 'up', 'old', 'renowned', 'musician', 'only', 'take', 'own', 'life.The', 'third', 'reporter', 'investigating', 'what', 'will', 'ultimately', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'scandal', 'collusion', 'oil', 'company', 'nuclear', 'energy', 'firm.The', 'fourth', 'book', 'publisher', 'who', 'locked', 'up', 'nursing', 'home', 'brother', 'only', 'escape', 'write', 'autobiography.The', 'fifth', 'Korea', 'future', 'where', 'restaurant', 'worker', 'freed', 'what', 'societal', 'norms', 'are', 'truly', 'based', 'upon.Can', 'say', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'last', 'vignette', 'even', 'farther', 'future', 'poor', 'tribesman', 'many', 'inner', 'demon', 'assisted', 'someone', 'outside', 'better', 'life.It', 'grand', 'film', 'full', 'wishes', 'grandeur', 'scope', 'found', 'tales', 'lives', 'affecting', 'future', 'ones', 'railing', 'authority', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'little', 'old', 'stale.It', 'film', 'told', 'different', 'vignettes', 'seemingly', 'disparate', 'stories', 'imparts', 'are', 'ultimately', 'connected.Many', 'actors', 'playing', 'one', 'are', 'sometimes', 'unrecognizable', 'first', 'glance', 'due', 'heavy', 'makeup.It', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'stick', 'especially', 'beginning', 'lumbers', 'starting', 'one', 'story', 'jumping', 'another.As', 'film', 'stories', 'become', 'ever', 'that', 'much', 'closer', 'jumping', 'shorter', 'swifter.But', 'say', 'end', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'say', 'was', 'LONG', '170', 'minutes', 'so', 'time', '.Technically', 'speaking', 'film', 'original', 'w/s', 'a/r', '2:35:1', 'generally', 'crisp', 'clear.The', 'colours', 'many', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'manipulated', 'produce', 'stronger', 'striking', 'contrast', 'viewing.Extras', 'are', 'one', 'featurette.All', 'tales', 'fighting', 'authority', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'mixed', 'up', 'little', 'reincarnation', 'turn', 'crank', 'then', 'one', 'you.But', 'found', 'story', 'story', 'hopping', 'tedious', 'best', 'length', 'horrifically', 'too', 'long.Not', 'recommended.2-2', '1/2', 'stars']",Cloud Atlas

I was a little worried by the lower rated posts on this film, but decided to give it a chance.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I found the story easy to follow, and quite sweet.  I didn't even realize the time had gone by as it had.  Unfortunately, the pasta I was making during the film didn't make it.  It was worth the sacrifice.  I can understand that people that have gotten used to the new style Hollywood movies that couldn't care less if it had a plot or theme, might have a hard time of following along. I wouldn't say this is award material, but definitely one that I'm glad I watched and I would probably watch again, though not too far in the near future.  Tom Hanks did an admirably good job.  I thought the beginning where he had his monologue did not bode well for the movie, but he progressed so well I forgot about it until writing the review.  Holly Barry also did a smart job.  Not as good as Hanks, but worthy.  I feel she represented herself quite well, and I must say she's done better than expected.  I'm looking forward to her next character. Jim Broadbent was of course amazing.  He's always been able to harness a character to the fullest.  Hugo Weaving was surprising in this one.

The film did have MANY positive, appealing aspects to it, it was visually stunning, had many rich and interesting characters, both good and bad, as well as very strong spiritual themes such as reincarnation and the belief that there is a bond that connects us all. However, the fact that it kept switching back and forth, changing characters, style of dialogue, and even tone (some stories were more humorous or dramatic than others), it almost felt like I was watching six separate movies instead of one cohesive one. I understand that all of the stories are connected and feature the same actors/actresses so it's obviously meant to be just one film, the settings and tones, as previously mentioned, were so diverse and different that I still had trouble connecting them to the other stories. One story, the 19th century one, felt like a historical adventure film a la Pirates of the Caribbean, The story that takes place in the far future, with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry meeting up in a setting which oddly reminded me of Battlestar Galactica, seems like a Sci-Fi epic similar to Avatar or Star Wars and the story that takes place in modern times seems like something Guy Ritchie or Shane Meadows would direct. It was all very inconsistent and very unnecessary. However, I greatly did enjoy all of the actors playing such wildly different characters, especially Tom Hanks, who plays both very villainous and very heroic roles, demonstrating how he eventually redeems himself of his past sins and negative karma. I have heard this film described as a very ""Buddhist"" film and I certainly agree, many of the central themes of Buddhism such as karma, reincarnation, dharma, and samsara. I feel that there aren't enough films of this sort being made nowadays and I greatly enjoyed watching it.

1586034,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B0095HHM78,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[11, 15]","Cloud Atlas is a conspiracy thriller, a dystopian science fiction story, a high seas adventure, a jovial geriatric comedy, a post apocalyptic action-adventure, to say nothing of the many love stories intertwined, but above it is a deeply moving human story. Cloud Atlas is hard to describe and  difficult to pigeon hole, but one thing I do know is that it is unlike anything  I have seen before  and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.This is a feast for the moviegoer, a joy to behold as many different movies play out in front of you. None are necessarily better than the other, and they are all great. Fascinating, exciting and funny in equal measures, a full experience at the movies if ever their was one. You'll need to keep your eyes on this thorough, it will be easy to get lost in the engulfing abyss of shear splendor, but it all becomes clear and actually isn't difficult to follow.There are those who insist that Cloud Atlas is an empty vessel lacking in depth and substance. I couldn't disagree more, to me their was a great deal of deep feelings and thoughts stirred in my head. Certainly not for all tastes, but what movie is, each viewer will have a different reaction to this film, for some it will be very rewarding.  A movie is  different things to different people and to me this is a multifaceted and meditative experience.To try and summarize the plot would be an exercise in futility, as so much is always going on here in this accelerating non-linear epic that spans the period from 1849 until 2349. Cloud Atlas is absorbing and succeeds at the delicacy of avoiding pretension. It is bold and challenging and at nearly three hours is a marvel in it's ability to never seem a second too long. Filled with wondrous possibilities and telling a grandiose story filled with hope, redemption, passion and love.I have always felt that a good test of any actor's ability is to see them play more than a single character in a film because it gives you a clear idea regarding their range and ability to slip in and out of various roles. Here a fine cast with Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturges, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Hugo Weaving, Doona Bae, among others are at the very pinnacle of their talent, they get to shine in about six roles each, one in each story for most of them.The make-up effects are some of the very best I have ever had the pleasure of feasting my eyes on. The actors manage to effortlessly metamorphoses into a dizzying array of characters thanks to this incredible make-up job provide by twenty-six immensely talented artists. After some recent bad make-up jobs seriously impaired some contemporary movies, I'm looking at you  J. Edgar, such an awe-inspiring job is fantastically refreshing. I am usually pretty sharp at spotting actors under make-up, especially very well know stars, but I have to admit that I know I couldn't tell who all the actors were at any given time. Some people may be distraction by attempts to spot all the actors, but that is ineffective as the stars themselves have admitted in interviews to not always recognizing one another, and the movie is so easy to get caught up in as to forget to keep stargazing.It took three directors, Andy and Lana Wachowski and Tom Tykwer, to successfully bring this highly ambitious movie together. Three talented filmmakers for sure, but until know they have all emphasized a style over substance attitude. Each have taken and seized the sections of this movie that best caters to their abilities, for example Tyker has taken on the suspense and lighter stories, while the Wachowskis focuss their attention on the action and science fiction elements. This is a very wise thing to do and helps to make it fully clear the need for all three to work in conjunction, I`m not sure any one director, no matter how talented could be able to pull this film off. Their achievements are to be commended and the fact that they realize something so well is staggering.I was not a fan of the Wachowskis going into this, I hated Speed Racer and was always a wet blanket when it came to their immensely popular Matrix trilogy. Cloud Atlas reminds me that at first they showed a great deal of promise with Bound, a smart and edgy thriller that couldn't have been more different than Cloud Atlas, but with Cloud Atlas they have graduated to the level of greatness and first rate filmmakers.This thrilling epic is based on an award winning and Nebula nominated ""unflimable"" masterpiece of a novel by David Mitchell. Adapted by the three directors, the film is quite different in many respects to the author's book, the movie is more passionate and emphasizing the reincarnation motif. Mitchell has praised the filmmakers for playing to the strengths of their medium that is decidedly different from his.The movie is lovingly photographed by Frank Griebe and John Toll. Griebe handles Tykwers's parts, the two are long time collaborators going back to their German-language contemporary classic Run Lola Run. Toll works the Wachowskis and is one of the best cinematographers today having won an Oscar for his beautiful work on Mel Gibson's Braveheart.For sure Cloud Atlas will leave people dived, some will find it brilliant while others will find it to be maddening. I will say that you wont soon forget it, and if your like me you'll become nearly obsessed by it and will want to see it again almost immediately. For others once will be too much, there loss.I don't know that Cloud Atlas will change anyone's belief system, or that it's aim is anything of the sort, but I think that it will challenge viewers to think, and for any movie that is a remarkable thing. You wont want to miss it, even if you wont like it, it's an experience worth having.

1586037,AO9PTJM7IQ5MH,B0095HHM78,Shotsy,"[69, 193]","Mild Alert - Some general thematic spoilers to those who haven't seen the movie yet, but no specific plot spoilers.I and my wife saw this monstrosity in the theater yesterday. My wife liked it. I decided to sleep on it before writing this review to be as fair as possible and see if my negative feelings about it survived a good night's sleep.Until yesterday, the most disastrous mess of a movie I had ever seen was Heaven's Gate.  But I actually like Heaven's Gate because there are portions of it that approached and maybe even achieved movie greatness, and that at least mitigated the truly disastrous majority of that movie.  My dear wife's opposing opinion notwithstanding, I can see no such mitigation for Cloud Atlas. It is by far, in my opinion, the most presumptuous Hollywood mess of a disaster that I have ever seen.It is unintelligible from the very beginning, and you are well into it before realizing that it is a time-jumping morass. It just does not work as a movie. Granted, I saw on the ending credits that the movie is based on a book. I am perfectly willing to believe that it works as a novel. In fact, I am seriously considering reading the book now to satisfy my curiosity of how faithful the movie version is to the book.  But not having read the book, here is a compendium of what I was thinking as I sat through this utterly mind numbing event, fidgeting through the long minutes while waiting for it to mercifully end (apologies to other reviewers who obviously have a very different opinion, judging by the early 4 and 5 star reviews here):* ""This monstrosity is unintelligible. Must be another Hollywood example of: `different' = `creative'. Look at how `brilliant' the director is!"" - As I've already mentioned, unless you arrive knowing the basic premise of the story/plot, the first parts of the movie are utterly unintelligible. Speaking of the word ""plot"", there is none really, although I realized by the end of the movie that there is a ""story"" of sorts.* ""Typical Hollywood liberalism on display.""-  The first love scene is of a gay couple and, by the time Cloud Atlas ends, the uber-enemy of all mankind is revealed to be Big Oil (by name!) and other profit-making corporations. And, of course, there are ample references to the rising sea levels, no doubt caused by global warming, which, in a giant loop of logic, is no doubt caused by the aforementioned Big Oil. Oh yes. To be fair, I don't know yet if the typical liberal propaganda is original to the book or if it was gratuitously inserted by Hollywood. If it's from the book, then it is certainly no fault of this movie's creators.* ""Cartoonish. Yet one more example of Hollywood's over-reliance on CGI to hype interest when plot is weak or non-existent."" - I was thinking this especially during the parts that take place in Korea or Japan (not exactly sure which country the ""fabricants"" portions take place in). For me, the CGI car chases and shootouts were not only badly done, but were also particularly jarring in view of the fact that most of the rest of the movie takes place in the ""real"" world. The juxtaposition of cartoon and reality just didn't work for me. Sorry! (If I may be facetious for a moment, movies like ""Who Killed Roger Rabbit"" did that kind of thing much more successfully. ;-))* ""There is no rhyme, reason or logic to the jumbled sequence of vignettes that this movie consists of."" - One normally expects that the order of scenes in a play, movie or novel is intentional and designed to clarify a story for the audience or move a story forward. Except for the opening and closing scenes with Tom Hanks as the movie's ""narrator"" for want of a better word, the entire rest of the movie's scenes could have been in any random order (and indeed, are). Even in retrospect, I see no overall logic for the movie's sequence of events or scenes.* ""This movie's major themes have been done often and have ALWAYS been done better."" - Two majorly MAJOR themes of the movie are 1) every event and everyone are connected, ripples in time, that sort of thing and 2) Love transcends time through reincarnations. Each theme is so OVERLY done and so shoved down the audience's throat that it loses all effectiveness as a new ""angle"" or new way to look at it. My take, when a director or screenwriter has to make his/her point with a sledgehammer, it's as good as an admission that the storyline is weak.* ""The whole ultimate point of this movie seems to be a lot of New Age platitudes and tripe."" - I'll leave it at that. This thought came to me towards the end of the movie and, depending on your personal belief system, that may be a plus or a minus for you.* Finally, ""The bottom line message of this movie is an optimistic one, so I certainly wouldn't object to anyone of R-rated age seeing it. But neither would I recommend that they subject themselves to the torture.""Well, that's my take and, at least as of this date, I seem to be in the minority here. I will, however mention that we saw Cloud Atlas in a large Imax theater on a Saturday. I expected a full house, but we walked in 15 minutes before showtime to an almost empty theater! There were two people seated when we walked in, and by the time the movie started only a handful of others had joined the four of us. Cloud Atlas has been out for about a week. If this is indicative of its box office going into its second week, I am wondering if the ""real world"" is staying away from this ""stinker"" notwithstanding the 4-5 star reviews posted here.  Full disclosure, we went to an afternoon screening. Maybe the evening showings were better attended. Still...Imax...Saturday matinee...first run movie with science fiction and video game elements usually attractive to a male teen audience  - I wouldn't normally expect an empty theater under those circumstances. I don't know how much the studio spent on this clunker (judging from the A-list cast and significant CGI investment it probably wasn't cheap to make), but I think they may lose money on the deal. Having begun with Heaven's Gate, let me close the circle - I have read that Heaven's Gate bombed so badly it bankrupted its studio. Might Cloud Atlas similarly shake the foundations of its backers?",1,Sorry to disagree,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,6221,"['Mild', 'Alert', 'general', 'thematic', 'spoilers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"",

1586040,A9AA6DFHYP7Q3,B0095HHM78,Solo Goodspeed,"[3, 4]","From the first trailer I saw of this film, I knew it was unique. I became even more intrigued when I read the various reactions to it; I tend to enjoy most films that divide audiences. I missed it in the theaters, but figured it was deep enough to warrant acquiring unseen. But I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.... in fact, I loved it, so much that I started watching it again right after it ended.Probably the reason for that was the very experience of watching six stories unfold simultaneously in one sitting. Even though I had no problem getting drawn into and following each one, I did feel I needed a little refresher for things I might have missed at the outset. When you do that with this film, you notice little things that reference the other stories, foreshadowing bits, numerous ""Aha"" moments and recurring elements like the comet birthmark, the composer's music playing at a social function, relationships between specific actors' characters proving significant in different incarnations (deja-vu anyone?), etc. This is no leave-your-mind-at-the-door type of entertainment; this is an engage your mind deeply for the full 175 minutes because everything matters on multiple levels aural experience.As mentioned, six plots: In 1849 an attourney travels to Chatham Islands to conduct a business arrangement. While there he falls ill, is cared for by a rather shady doctor and on the way back discovers a stowaway slave in his quarters who convinces him to persuade the ship's captain to let him join the crew. A special friendship results. In 1936, an English musician (and hopeful composer) is hired by an older famous composer to help him overcome obstacles to his productivity; soon it becomes apparent that the older man wants to use the younger's own compositional gifts for his own legacy which develops into struggle for personal integrity. In 1973 a woman journalist finds herself drawn into some unsavory dealings between the oil industry and a nuclear power plant, with life threatening results. In 2012, a gangster who just published a book murders a high profile critic, good news for his publisher who enjoys all the profits after the guy goes to prison.... until the thug's former associates (probably characters in the book) show up at his place demanding what they consider their cut. He doesn't have quite as much as they demand, so he goes to his brother for help.... which ends up being a HUGE mistake. On ahead to 2144, in Neo-Seoul, Korea, a young female clone named Sonmi-451 who was genetically engineered for a lifetime of servitude is given a crash course in what it means to have a real life when a series of events partners her up with the rebel commander of a movement known as Union. She quickly becomes a person of great historical consequence. And in 2321 (introduced as ""106 Winters After the Fall""), a member of a tribal society called The Valley reluctantly agrees to escort a visiting female member of a more technically advanced society, The Prescients, to a forbidden mountain temple known as Cloud Atlas, which the Valley tribe considers evil. Braving an enemy tribe of cannibals and an dark presence referred to as Old Georgie, a life-changing revelation awaits.And what's it all about? Well, the film's poster simply states ""Everything Is Connected"". That is the theme. Indeed, through attentive watching, many connections are emphasized, and easy to miss if one looks away too long. Another synopsis: ""An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future"". Essentially, to call this film an epic would be an understatement, and it's really up to the viewers and their willingness to ride out the journey to decide for themselves what it's ""about"". It will resonate with people differently, and many won't get it and tell you it's a bad film because of that. One thing for certain: For a film of this scope, I've never seen one that was better edited. The way it holds together alone is worthy of praise.One challenge I had with watching was picking up the dialect used by the Valley tribesmen, obviously an imagining of how language might evolve over the ages (see Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); some viewers may find that taking getting used to. The onscreen performances are spot on, visual effects (and visuals overall) are seamless, and the makeup used to transform actors across characters (in some cases across genders) is a star in itself. One possible improvement would have been to use actual Korean actors across the board in the Neo-Seoul segment, the only not very convincing makeup I noticed. In no way did that diminish my enjoyment of the movie.Apparently this is not a film for everyone. People will either get it or not, perhaps be turned off by certain plot elements enough to want to shut the whole film out. I am with the group that considers it one of the best films ever, as much a departure from studio system dreck as a viewer hungry for originality could want. I don't hand out five star ranks to many movies.

1586043,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B0095HHM78,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[2, 2]","Love it or hate it Cloud Atlas pulls off what no other movie (as far as I can find) has dared attempt. It is essentially six different stories spread out over a 500 year period intertwined throughout the running of the film. These stories and the cast within them are each connected in two ways. The first being the principal players are apparently reincarnations of the same person in each story. The second being the actions done in an earlier story influence the lives of another era. It's all a fascinating concept, and on paper it sounds like it would be an amazing achievement. Sadly it falls short of the grandiose concept. Still the movie is fascinating. Do I love it? No. Do I hate it? No. Do I regret seeing it? No. Why? Read on.I think the best way to get to the nuts and bolts of this film is to break up each individual story. While each of them are very different from each other a few things are common. First is the separate story in of itself if complete and aside from trivial details does not need the support of the other stories to stand on its own. Second is even though these are all complete stories with one exception they feel in way incomplete. Much more needed to be said and done in order for the stories to truly leave you satisfied on its own. I understand the limitations of squeezing six stories into three hours of running time, but it still is what it is. Another thing I found in common is every story has at one point or another has some really graphic violence. It doesn't matter if the theme of the story is dramatic of comedic or otherwise. Every one of them has a signature stamp of shocking violence on it. Now on to the stories, which I'll just denote by the time period.1849Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) is traveling the Pacific on business and on the way back befriends a runaway slave (David Gyasi). All the while he contracts a rare disease and is being administered by a physician along the way (Tom Hanks). It is a story about the virtues of loyalty and the complications of trust. Essentially just three sets with the first part being at a slave trade port, second being in a sailing ship, and a coda to tie off the loose ends at a Victorian home. The best parts are during the scenes on a large sailing ship, which all the virtues of the story come together. I think at least the first half of this story suffers the most by being broken up into parts throughout the film. More than any of the others I found myself having to do reach back into my memory in order to continue where this story left off. But by the time we get to the trip back the interweaving falls into place much better.1936A musician named Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) writes to his lover about his experience trying to reignite the talents of noted composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent), while creating his own musical opus, The Cloud Atlas. This story is set in various cities around Great Britain and is a drama in every form.There is an aire of self serving confidence in Frobisher as he volunteers himself into the lives of the Ayrs (including bedrooms) all the while still writing away to his paramour. As many dramas before are it is ultimately a sad story of loss and emotional complication as best laid plans end up taking a turn for the worst. This story serves as a good change of pace from the more action oriented stories, and still keeps you held in interest over where the story turns.1973Set in San Francisco budding journalist Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) uncovers a sinister secret involving a newly opened nuclear reactor. This story has all the suspense of a good conspiracy theory styled action film. I have to admit this story feels a bit more complete than most others, but not enough to say it's a finished work with no need for expansion. Definitely has that 70's movie feel to it.Two standout performances aside from Berry come from two sides of the good/evil coin. Keith David absolutely owns his role as security chief, or more akin to this story the cavalry. I would see a whole movie based off this character. On the other end is  hitman Mr. Smoke (Hugo Weaving), who is completely amoral and so evil to the bone you can't help but want to be in the fight against him.2012Set in the UK this story, even though it starts off rather harsh, end up being the comedic twist Cloud Atlas desperately needed to lighten an otherwise heavy storyline. Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) is a publisher with the unfortunately distinction of having a homicidal client kill a critic of his book. Cavendish ends up going into hiding after a run in with his client's cohorts over ""royalties"" and gets double crossed by his brother (Hugh Grant), who traps him in a crooked retirement home.The comedy gets a bit irky up until he joins a group of retirees in hatching a plan to escape. Then the story gets delightfully crazy and lighthearted; in contrast to it's beginning. Nice blend of the cast with a notable detail. I say notable because it's both entertaining and weird at the same time. Hugo Weaving plays sadistic Nurse Noakes, which is at first off-putting to see Hugo as a rather large and unappealing woman. As the story goes on I see the appeal of having such a caricature of a character. Of all the Cloud Atlas stories this is the one feels the most complete, and if you took this segment and made it into a half hour long short film it would stand on its own successfully. It also has the most fulfilling ending of all.2144It's Neo-Seoul and genetically engineered clones have become the new slave class. One clone, Sonmi~451 (Doona Bae) tells her story to an archivist (Hugo Weaving) of how she got liberated from her captor by a rebel commander (Jim Sturgess). The rebels then shows her the truth of her place and fate in society, and attempt to broadcast a manifesto spoken by Sonmi-451.This is the action segment of Cloud Atlas (and also where the sexual situations of the movie reside) so it is the most visceral of all the stories. It feels a lot like The Matrix in many ways without actually straight out plagiarizing the Wachowskis' previous work. As it sits alone the action is great and the story stands out as the fate of an entire class of people are in the balance. Still since it is mostly an action piece it loses a lot of depth and development on the second half of the piece. As a sci-fi fan I do admit this was the segment I adhered to the most.2321The date is not noted on the movie (just that it's 106 years after ""the fall"") until the end credits. Apparently the revolution from the 2144 took hold, but it appears society as a whole collapsed by an apocalypse of otherwise. All we see in this story segment are two groups. One highly advanced (although it seems the technology is at about the same level as 2144) called the Prescients and one primitive group living in the valley. The advanced group sends an emissary (Halle Berry) to the valley people to get a guide into uncharted mountains to a communications station to send a message to the colonies outside Earth. The guide, Zachry (Tom Hanks) has to juggle his superstitions and fears over the deadly Kona tribe with trust in his Prescient friend. All the while he is tormented by Old Georgie (Hugo Weaving), who is either a hallucination or malevolent spirit bent on breaking Zachry's will.As a standalone this is a story of vindication over fear and prejudice. In the whole this is the bookend for Cloud Atlas that kind of finishes the fate of all the souls who have jumped from era to era. As such it serves to finish the movie with a ray of hope. Again, this being a sci-fi genre piece it interested me. There is a good interpretation of the different cultures and how they know each other and learn to work together even though this story has a pretty depressing level to it.So how do all of these stories connect to each other other than the same actors playing different incarnations? The other connection I mentioned is really just a footnote that hardly seems to affect the fate that it supposedly influences. A letter or manuscript from a previous story is read on the next one, but the reading doesn't really seem to cause any paradigm shift in the story. You have one character that actually is in two different stories, but again this detail is not significant in of itself. Then on the final 2321 story it hints at how important Sonmi~451's manifesto from 2144 was, but again it doesn't serve any significance other than why she is significant as a person. To me this is where Cloud Atlas fails. It has six different stories that are connected somewhat, but those connections don't go anywhere other than as an interesting footnote for those paying attention.On the other hand I do find it interesting to see these various ""lives"" evolve through time. I think this is where the movie can get fascinating for those of you who like to analyze, theorize and philosophize over it. So I look at Tom Hanks' characters and see a slow move from a selfish and evil man in early incarnations, to somebody who wants to do what's right, but is afraid, to the final character to overcomes these selfish ways. Alternately I see the same in Hugo Weaving's character. He starts off as a man eager to get into the slave trade and pretty much sticks to being bad all the way up to his incarnation that experiences Sonmi's testimony and manifesto (I don't count his portrayal as Old Georgie as that was not a physical incarnation). This follows the philosophy of reincarnation where as the soul progresses through the many lifetimes the soul gets older and wiser depending on what decisions are made in the next lifetime. Some souls take longer than others to reach a certain level of enlightenment. In that little analogy, whether it was intended or not by the makers of the movie, makes Cloud Atlas all the more worth looking into.The mechanics of the film itself are top notch. Cinematography, costumes, sets, script, acting, music score, special effects, practical effects and a whole slew of other details are done with precision and a high level of quality. Each era you are in you really feel like you are in that era. The future eras may have been trickier with 2144 being a bit too far on the fantastical side, but 2321 did feel very real even for a made up time period. Makeup is essentially very good with certain times you will have a hard time figuring out if that is really your favorite actor under it. Then again there are some moments of weakness makeup wise. Some ""old face"" look more like make up than being natural. The Neo-Seoul segment had some awkward looking faces of non-Asian actors made to look Asian, although I can imagine that being attributed to a future of mixed nationalities and genetic variances to make it not seem so strange. Basically all of the production values hit home and on that front Cloud Atlas is a resounding success.The Blu-Ray looks great and the movie is encoded on a BD50 disk so there is very little risk of image compression from the three hour movie. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound is well balanced. Aggressive in the action scenes but clean and clear in the more dialog heavy parts. This Blu-Ray/Combo says it comes with Ultraviolet Digital Copy, but that's a little misleading. Any time you see Ultraviolet that usually means you don't actually have the digital copy on disk, but you have an authorization code to download one from the web. A small detail, but I think it's worth pointing out. As for the extra features I can't help but feel underwhelmed. While the back packaging makes it sound like you are getting a plethora of documentaries what you are really getting is little snippets. They are call focus point featurettes and all of them run under ten minutes (but in HD). Here's the breakdown:A Film Like No Other - This is a fluff piece. It's something akin to a promotional short that must have been floating around before the film was released. It mostly hosts interviews with cast and crew geared towards sounding like the making of the movie was a grandest undertaking of them all.Everything is Connected - Some behind the scenes footage along with clips from the film and interviews all geared toward pointing out the connections the stories have with each other.The Impossible Adaptation - Essentially a discussion with the directors and and author David Mitchell talking about the novel and what was done to adapt it into a novel.The Essence of Acting - Various actors talking about the different roles they played and what it took to make the essential changes with each character. I would have enjoyed more time and depth on this featurette as it really delves into the meat of what this movie is about to me.Spaceships, Slaves & Sextets - Discussions on mixing the six stories together into a single cohesive piece. It feels like already charted territory by now, but some new insights do come up now and then.The Bold Science Fiction of Cloud Atlas - Another fluff piece that focuses on the sci-fi stories and the development of these worlds. Not exactly anything you couldn't figure out yourself after watching the film.Eternal Recurrence: Love, Life, and Longing - Much like the previous featurette, only this one focuses on the romantic elements of the film. Again it feels like parroting what most viewers already find out while watching the film.There is a fair amount of overlap in the information and footage between these featurettes, which makes feel even more cheated that they couldn't get separate content for ten minute documentaries on a three hour movie that's supposed to have taken four years to make. And there are no audio commentaries from cast and crew. No deleted scenes (is any exist). Not even movie trailers or image stills. As far as extras are concerned the package is underwhelming.Cloud Atlas is definitely a movie I would recommend seeing, but I'm not by any means expecting you to love, or even like it afterwards. Still it's one of those films that no matter how you feel about it by the end is worth experiencing. For sci-fi fans I would have to call it required viewing for the same reasons. Love it or hate it this movie is a ground breaker. Should you buy it? Not until you see it first. This isn't one of those films you should jump headlong into a purchase without knowing what you're getting into. No amount of reviews you read will really tell you if you should buy it or not. Lord knows it's not worth buying for the extras. Rent it. Netflix it. Whatever. But try before your buy.",4,Does what no other movie has before it.,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,14506,"['Love', 'hate', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'off', 'what', 'other', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'find',

1586046,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B0095HHM78,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[1, 1]","because of negative reviews I saw when film initially came out, I didn't expect to like it.  I don't remember the reviews, only that most of the ones I read weren't enthusiastic.  I'm happy to say I liked it much more than I thought I would. Film is ambitious, speaks to the underdogs amongst us, and is highly romantic in a pro-humanity way.  The theme of repeated lives apparently is limited to humans, no other animals/life forms are shown as getting multiple bites at the apple.  Think I would have been more likely to accept the story's reincarnation theme if it included additional life forms.  Limiting reincarnation to people made the story seem like species propaganda.Humans are top dog on earth, we eat just about whatever we want, and then create fictional worlds where we create additional lives to do the same.  Not even in our imaginings do we include reincarnation for animals we consider inferior/subordinate/different from us/less than us.  We're a very species-centric animal, no matter how good, kind and sweet some of us may want to be.  Not a hater of my species, just saying.Two weak points in my opinion were, why did the young man commit suicide.  I know things were going badly for him and that he was being blackmailed, but I guess I didn't find the story proved well enough why he felt suicide was his only option; his suicide made no sense to me.  Another thing, why was the young freed female slave the only one who the resistance felt could lead the revolt.  I think the story didn't explain loudly enough what she brought to the table.  The rebels spent considerable time and effort freeing and protecting her, and the story didn't explain why her, exactly.  Other than what I've pointed, thought film was pretty good, I laughed, I cried.  Rate 3 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 4, as Amazon doesn't allow for fractions.  Checked it out from the library but would definitely buy it if I had the funds.  Well done filmmaking team.P.S. I'd buy this film, despite the flaws that in my opinion it has, because I'm a middle age women, experienced viewing film stories, and none are perfect.

1586047,A6NUSZOVMJSOD,B0095HHM78,Stacy,"[8, 10]","I suppose, on the surface, Cloud Atlas is a story about reincarnation. But if you care to take the time to consider a deeper interpretation of this rich and multi-layered masterpiece - and you should - it is a story about how our actions, kind or cruel, wise or unwise, caring or ambivalent, affect the lives of others that live in the same time as we do and those who will become our descendants who will live in a future time. The butterfly effect, causality in physics and philosophy come to mind. So, if you don't believe in reincarnation - and I don't know of any reason to, at the moment - this story still has a powerful message. Perhaps the concept of reincarnation is just a vehicle by which to convey a universally applicable message. When we turn down a request for a small monetary donation from a homeless person on the street, could we be neglecting to make a necessary contribution to a spark of inspiration that could lead to a series of events that could change many lives for the better and help stop the suffering of many; even alter the course of our future?

1586048,A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B0095HHM78,"Stella Carrier ""joyfulwoman2078""","[9, 13]","""Cloud Atlas"" was a great and unique film that creatively weaved concepts of reincarnation into a message of how we are connected to one another.  I am thankful for all of the blessings that I have in my life (including my family members and friends).  However, watching this movie reminded me why I would prefer for my current lifetime to be my last lifetime on earth (if reincarnation actually exists). Yes, I know that ""Cloud Atlas"" is only a great entertainment movie.  It is just that some of the future scenarios that were depicted were quite dramatic and definitely different from my vision of a future Utopian society.For example, Tom Hanks and Halle Berry cleverly play the powerful roles of two spirits who become drawn together in both 1970's California and in some post Apocalypse world of the future.  The world definitely requires physical aggression and definitely falls under the phrase ""survival of the fittest."" There is also a heartwarming story of a man who undergoes psychological changes when a runaway slave befriends him.  This somehow seems to tie into a future life reality in Asia.  There were more actors and actresses that did a great job with the interwoven past and future life stories crafted together.  It is just that some of the realities turn out wonderful while it is a matter of personal perception on how the others unfold.  Aside from my personal perspectives of caveats, ""Cloud Atlas"" is a film for those who enjoy movies with spiritual themes and/or high adrenaline action.  Due to some graphic and violent scenes, care must be obviously given when bringing any children under 12.",5,"Connection Atlas: ""Miniscule Film Spoilers""",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,1622,"['Cloud', 'Atlas', 'was', 'great', 'unique', 'film', 'creatively', 'weaved', 'concepts', 'reincarnation', 'message', 'how', 'are', 'connected', 'one', 'am', 'thankful', 'blessings', 'have', 'life', 'including', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'However', 'watching', 'movie', 'reminded', 'why', 'would', 'prefer', 'current', 'lifetime', 'be', 'last', 'lifetime', 'earth', 'reincarnation', 'actually', 'Yes', 'know', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'only', 'great', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'just', 'future', 'scenarios', 'were', 'depicted', 'were', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'definitely', 'different', 'vision', 'future', 'Utopian', 'society.For', 'example', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'cleverly', 'play', 'powerful', 'roles', 'two', 'spirits', 'who', 'become', 'drawn', 'together', '1970', 'California', 'post', 'Apocalypse', 'world', 'future', 'world', 'definitely', 'physical', 'aggression', 'definitely', 'phrase', 'survival', 'fittest', 'also', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'psychological', 'changes', 'when', 'runaway', 'slave', 'befriends', 'somehow', 'tie', 'future', 'life', 'reality', 'Asia', 'were', 'more', 'actors', 'actresses', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'interwoven', 'past', 'future', 'life', 'stories', 'crafted', 'together', 'just', 'realities', 'turn', 'out', 'wonderful', 'matter', 'personal', 'perception', 'how', 'others', 'unfold', 'Aside', 'personal', 'perspectives', 'caveats', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'film', 'who', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'spiritual', 'themes', 'and/or', 'high', 'adrenaline', 'action', 'Due', 'graphic', 'violent', 'scenes', 'care', 'must', 'be', 'obviously', 'given', 'when', 'bringing', 'children', '12']",Cloud Atlas

1586051,A3O886DD5BZO8O,B0095HHM78,Steve D. Heckenlively,"[341, 401]","Have you ever felt hammered by a movie? Has it ever taken you days, weeks,to integrate a movie, in your head and heart? Read on ...If you see this movie, you'll probably see why some people don't like it. Infact you may see different reasons for different people. A great movie allowsthe individual to bring their own positive interpretation. Cloud Atlas alsoallows the individual to bring their own negatives.My own personal bitterness was ""How come my heros always die, but your herosalways live happily ever after?"" This hit me hardest as I was walking out ofthe theater, but it still galls me to think about it.You see, its like this: Cloud Atlas goes for power and effect. If they hitsomething positive in you, you rave about it. If they hit something negative,you hurt big time. This movie isn't about entertainment, its about achievingenough kinetic force to shake you up. Its wrenching. And some people do notlike being shaken like a rag doll. More so, because as people have said,Cloud Atlas is unlike any other movie ever made.In a broader sense, I think almost everyone has at least one scene where youask yourself ""Do I really wanna sit here and watch this?"" The whole diversitything, not just diversity of people, but diversity of fates, gets close to thepoint of overload with Cloud Atlas, and anyone who feels pushed over the redlinewill walk out, having better things to do.Again, its like this: If you can hold the movie at arms length, you're ok, butif you step inside it, then its really disturbing. And I'm not talking aboutthe sex and violence either. Its the ideas, plural. There are so many ideas inthis movie, at so many different levels, its like a living fractal. Not ideasjust for the sake of ideas, not ideas just to shake you up, but ideas thatspeak to you as a unique individual.For me, Cloud Atlas is the most disturbing movie since Donnie Darko, althoughthey are radically different movies. But then again, some of it is funny, andparts of it are exhilarating too. It has a mix of light and dark, it isn't alldark. And it isn't ""comic relief"" either. Somehow, the lighter parts of themovie are woven directly into the fabric of the story. It works amazingly well.In technique, Cloud Atlas takes the concept of an ensemble movie, and re-inventsthe entire purpose and effect of having an ensemble. And it isn't just in howthe actors are related, and who plays what role. One of the foundations of aconventional movie is to build an association in our minds, between 1 actor andthe 1 role they play. Cloud Atlas demolishes that foundation and replaces itwith its own unique creation. Its disorienting, to such a degree that you can'tgrasp it from other people's words. You have to experience it for yourself toappreciate the *power* of it.Cloud Atlas is also a film that has a voice, in particular on the subject ofartificial life. This topic has been around for many decades in science fictionbooks and movies. But as technology seems to get closer to actually creatingit, fiction has gotten more sophisticated in how it expresses its message aboutartificial life. That message is the most disturbing part of Cloud Atlas for me.The writers see a storm coming, a new kind of storm that no one has ever seenbefore.I'm not talking about things like the Terminater and SkyNet. Cloud Atlas doesn'tdeal with machines, it deals with souls. Sure, Cloud Atlas is fiction. But ourpast is not fiction. We have an ugly history of repeating our mistakes. And somemistakes only become fatal after they've been repeated over and over and overagain.Regarding the ""everyone's connected"" philosophy, I thought this works greatas a narrative device, without me feeling (today at least) that I personallysubscribe to that philosophy. I would hope this philosophy doesn't deteranyone from seeing the movie, because I think they turn it into a positivething, even for people who don't agree with it. Its part of how the storyis built, and built very well.Another area where Cloud Atlas pushes the envelope is in taking all the actorsand doing radical, (sometimes humorous) make-overs to fit them into a character.This itself has offended some people, because Cloud Atlas doesn't apply anylimitations at all, and it has dozens of makeovers. This is very different than,for instance, Looper, where the make-up and acting are all focused withoverwhelming skill into changing 1 single person into another single person,with absolute conviction. In Cloud Atlas, the transformations are beautiful,striking, uncanny, other-worldly. It becomes another way in which this moviehammers at you.If you decide, like me, that Cloud Atlas is indeed a masterpiece, you willprobably have one moment, one scene, which pushes you over the edge and intothe realization that it *is* a masterpiece. Not necessarily the most powerfulscene in the movie, but the scene where the sum of it all finally overloadsyour doubts.For me, that scene was where we first see Doona Bae as Tilda. I've never seenanything like that in a movie, and it took me about 15 seconds to just beginto parse what I was seeing. The sheer creativity, the imaginative beauty ofthe character, connecting outwards into 2 hours of the vast scope of the movie,just blew me away.

1586056,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B0095HHM78,Steven Aldersley,"[10, 12]","How do you even begin to write a review for Cloud Atlas? I saw it two days ago, and woke up at 4:15 this morning, thinking about how to organize my thoughts into a coherent assessment.I will probably fail.If I were to attempt to sum up the movie in a single paragraph, I would say that it deals with how souls change over time. We are shown six distinct time periods. Several actors appear as six different characters across these six moments in time. Oh, the time periods all feature different genres too. I would imagine the movie is attempting to make us question the meaning of life itself, and how it might be represented on some sort of eternal scale. It's like watching the offspring ofMulholland Dr.andInception [Blu-ray] playing on a holodeck, featuring six worlds across 500 years, using aMemento (10th Anniversary Special Edition) [Blu-ray]-style narrative.In order to make sense of the movie and give it an accurate grade, I would have to read the book (unlikely), and watch it at least one more time (very likely when the Blu-ray is released). For now, I'll document my thoughts to see whether subsequent viewings change my opinion.The movie is based on the book by David Mitchell, who reportedly wrote stories for the six different time periods, utilizing six different genres, and then drew them together as the story progressed. That structure reminds me of Dan Simmons'The Hyperion Cantos, although I doubt it matches Hyperion in terms of quality. I highly recommend Hyperion to anyone who appreciates Cloud Atlas. In terms of subject matter, I'm reminded of theDaggerspell (Deverry Series, Book One)series, written by Katharine Kerr. It also jumps around in time, across centuries, and uses the theme of souls being continually drawn to one another. I wonder whether Mitchell is a fan?The six time periods used in the movie are 1849, 1936, 1973, 2012, 2144, and the twenty-fourth century.Through these six stories, we learn that the souls of some of the characters involved also travel through time. However, they may change from male to female, and change race, or sexual orientation. Some souls are evil in every setting, while others switch from evil, or neutral, to good. I won't reveal any of that information because it's better to discover it for yourself.The biggest problem with the movie is the way the story keeps switching from one time period to another. Instead of showing each story arc from beginning to end, we are often shown two or three minutes in one time period before jumping to another. This has the effect of making it clear that the characters (or souls) exist in several or (in some cases) all of the time periods, and that's a good thing. But it also prevented me from becoming too emotionally attached to any of the characters. I found that I didn't really care about their struggles.The earliest story takes place on a ship (South Pacific), and moves through a hotel in the 1930s (Scotland), to San Francisco in 1973, a party set in an English hotel in the present day, before visiting the future (Neo Seoul) and far future. So you'll see two period pieces, a sequence that reminded me ofThe Streets of San Francisco - Season One, Vol. 1, a story set in our current time, a science fiction segment that looks likeBlade Runner 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (4-Disc Blu-ray / DVD +Book +UltraViolet Digital Copy Combo Pack),The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray] andThe Fifth Element (Remastered) [Blu-ray], and a post-apocalyptic tale set more than 300 years in the future.Technology ranges from primitive to futuristic, with the final segment being a curious blend of both.The strongest of the stories are the final three chronologically. In 2012, Timothy Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) is a book publisher who desperately needs money. This segment features a lot of humor and had the audience laughing throughout. The Neo Seoul story features Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae), who is aided in her quest by Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess). Here we see plenty of futuristic shots and an elaborate chase scene which would fit well in any science fiction movie. The final segment sees Zachry (Tom Hanks) meet Meronym (Halle Berry). Although the two are from vastly different backgrounds, they form a bond. It's here that the biggest struggle between good and evil takes place, and it shows how Zachry's soul evolves from what it once was.None of the stories are straightforward. Most are not properly resolved. I think the point is not the quests themselves, but the overall passage of the souls of the recurring characters.I'm probably not making much sense.Cloud Atlas is something you need to experience for yourself, but only if you are the kind of person open to analysis and repeat viewings. This is not a coherent story with a linear structure. If you do decide it's for you, try to enjoy the individual scenes for what they are. If you are anything like me, you'll reflect on what you have seen over the next few days and things will start to take on some kind of meaning. It's certainly one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings I have ever witnessed.Overall provisional score 3.5/5",4,"Ambitious, and a sprawling mess, but it has something",1352678400,"11 12,

I predict that it will stand the test of time and eventually be labeled a classic or at least, a cult classic.I knew very little about this movie, but was intrigued by the trailer, stars, and Wachowskis.  I loved the Matrix trilogy and the themes that it touches upon on top of the brilliant visual style.  I also liked V for Vendetta, so just seeing the trailer and the W's involvement was enough.  I didn't do any research either except to read that Natilie Portman read the novel and told the Wachowskis about it.  I have not read the novel yet, but will after seeing the movie.  I have since read reviews of the book and they generally follow the same sentiments concerning this film; both the good and the bad.  Non-linearity and unconventional story-telling or film-making generally do not equate to succe$$ and are almost always met with mixed reviews.My initial reaction to the film was confusion due to the jumps between story lines, but I found that the movie began to make sense and became more engaging as it progressed.  When it was over, I found myself thinking that I loved it, but also that it definitely needed more than one viewing.  Subsequent viewings have and will continue to be even more rewarding (like noticing the same art-work in different locations/times).  Isn't that one of the things that constitutes a great movie?  Along with sticking with you long after you leave the theater and/or giving you much to talk about after verses forgetting what you saw an hour later.  Why own it if you won't watch it more than once?I certainly hope that this film makes money or at least breaks even; if only so that future movies can be made from ""unfilmable"" stories.

1586062,A151OW029XD9JU,B0095HHM78,Susan Tunis,"[667, 755]","David Mitchell is one of my absolute favorite writers, and Cloud Atlas is among my favorite novels. It was my top pick for 2004.  I've previously blogged about my unusual first encounter with Mr. Mitchell while he was touring for Cloud Atlas. (Google ""David Mitchell returns to San Francisco"" if you're curious.)  Good times!Anyway, considering my love of the novel, you can imagine that I've been looking forward to the film with equal measures of anticipation and trepidation. You always want the film to do the source material justice, but it's rare that it actually happens. Especially when you're looking at a novel as complex as Cloud Atlas. It was said by many to be unfilmable, and if asked, I would have agreed.And I would have been so very wrong. What Andy Wachowski, Lana Wachowski, and Tom Tykwer have achieved is nothing short of astounding. I'll cut to the chase and tell you that I LOVED this film. It will surely be my favorite of the year.Have you read Cloud Atlas? The novel has a very unusual structure. Mitchell's an experimental writer. The novel is composed of six linked stories taking place in six different time periods and comprised of six different literary genres. Yeah, that's not too ambitious. The novel opens with the most distant story in the past, a 19th century adventure at sea. Halfway through, the story ends abruptly, mid-sentence. Next, we're at the home of a once-eminent European composer in the early 20th century. That, too, ends abruptly, and now we're embroiled in a mystery in early 1970's San Francisco. But halfway through the tale just stops and we're on to a high comedy set near the present day. After reading half of Timothy Cavendish's ghastly ordeal, we're suddenly in the science fiction world of a futuristic and dystopian Seoul--for half a story. And finally, we're in far-distant, post-apocalyptic Hawaii, in a tale written entirely in pigeon English. And at last, the story goes all the way through to the end, after which the second half of the Seoul story commences, followed by all the others in reverse order.The film is... totally not like that. It's structured completely differently, with quick scenes from all six stories rapidly juxtaposed against each other. There is constant shifting. It's an amazing way to tell the tale(s), but it works. It more than works. It really drives home the novel's abstract themes of connectedness. After the film, one of the things my friends and I commented upon was the staggering job of editing this film. I can't imagine what went into it, but it was masterful.What these three writer/directors--apparently with limited input from Mr. Mitchell--did with this screenplay is extraordinary. It is brilliant. Now, it's been eight years since I read the novel, so my memory of the details is not so fresh, but by my reckoning, the screenplay was remarkably true to Mitchell.  I recognized dialogue taken verbatim from the novel.  Yes, there were elisions, but they were minor. The composer's daughter was removed entirely. She's a character that stands out in my mind due to a memorable later cameo in Mitchell's Black Swan Green, but you know what? She was superfluous. The film didn't need her. I'm sure there were other minor changes, but nothing at all that made me cry foul. No, as I watched the film, memories of the novel came flooding back in the most wonderful way. These filmmakers did a magnificent job of realizing the world(s) that David Mitchell had created.The film boasts an impressive a-list cast that includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, and so many others. And you've never seen these actors like this. No one has. Go to IMDB and read the cast credits. They're all double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, and sextuple cast! You can't possibly catch or recognize all of their iterations. The actors change age, race, nationality, and gender across the roles. The makeup work is extraordinary, and if the film doesn't win the Oscar, there is simply no justice. Trying to spot Hugh Grant (mostly in smaller supporting roles) buried under old man or cannibal makeup is all kinds of fun, but this is far more than Hollywood stunt casting. The casting reflects the novel's themes. It gets the message across at times almost subliminally. It also gives these stars the opportunity to really flex their acting muscles.  Tom Hanks brings down the house in a brief comic turn as a thuggish author. When have we seen this actor play so many different colors in a single film? It reminds viewers of just how good he is. Oh yeah, that's what those Oscars were for. The same can be said of much of the cast. I strongly encourage you to stay for the credits--at least long enough to see the photos of the actors in their many roles flash by. You will be shocked by what you missed. THAT was Halle Berry? you'll find yourself thinking.Oh, and look for author Mitchell in a cameo as a ""Union Spy."" I didn't catch him, but I'll be on the lookout next time. Because I plan to see this film many, many times. There's just too much to take in. I'd venture I'll catch something new every time I see this film in years to come. Even at the lengthy running time of 2:44, I was ready to walk right back into the theater and start over from the beginning. The film held me transfixed, and I can't wait to see it again. Not to mention, I've already got a wish list in my mind of DVD extras!I don't generally write movie reviews, but Cloud Atlas has inspired me. The ideas, the themes, the imagery of David Mitchell's wonderful and ground-breaking novel have sprung to life. It is magical. I attended an advance screening with several members of my book group the other night, and there was equal enthusiasm from those who had read the novel, and those who hadn't. Among my group, there were six thumbs way up, and one lonely dissenter--but she can write her own review. Mine is an unqualified rave. Go. See. This.

Every story line is chopped up into a mosaic of storylines,so you zip between these different timelines and characters,which is confusing the 1st time you watch it,but it did work.Larger themes of liberation,tyranny,enslavement,crossing boundaries or conventions,self sacrifice,the communication of forbidden truths are woven into the shifting tapestry.Each of the 6 episodes is succeeded by a story which contains something of the preceeding story,whether it be a journal,music,letters or motif.Based on the Mitchell source novel,Cloud Atlas, and structured like a Russian doll or onion. The Wachowskis and Tyker use the syntax of crosscutting, montage, flashback and flashforward to interweave the multiple storylines in various genres.Narrative strands are cut up and reordered so they appear to be unfolding simultaneously across gulfs of space and time.This allows the precise structure of the novel to work on the big screen.The editing is immensely sophisticated.By turns historical drama,dystopian SF,post-apocalyptic fable, nuclear thriller and knock-about-farce,it's like a multi-ethnic meal with many dishes from all round the world.One can admire the ambition,the risks taken,maybe only some parts succeed. It's one of the biggest independent films ever made(costing $100 million).I loved the moments of knockabout farce in the nightmarish modern-day publishing farce of Tim Cavendish(Broadbent),with Hugo Weaving as Nurse Noakes as light relief from him playing Old Georgie the demonic tempter to Old Zachry(Hanks) in the post-apocalyptic 24th century. There is a very New Age-y feel to the themes in the movie. Carlos Casteneda is mentioned in the 70s story,where Luisa Rey (Berry)wonders""why we keep making the same mistakes over and over"";or Frobisher's(Wishaw) `Cloud Atlas Sextet',where he says whole movements were written  ""imagining us meeting again and again in different times.""Hanks nerdy scientist tells Berry ""that when I opened a door a powerful d&eacute;j&agrave; vu ran through my bones.""Most care seemed to be given to the Tyker-directed 1930s narrative, with Ben Whishaw and Jim Broadbent at the top of their respective games as feckless young Cambridge drop-out Robert Frobisher anddyspeptic husk Vyvyan Ayrs, united by their talent for music, which in Frobisher's case is at a fertile peak leading to the composition of the Cloud Atlas Sextet that gives its name to the film. Also the Neo-Seoul , near-future dystopian political SF succeeds because of the excellent sets of a Blade Runner-like quality and the acting skills of Doona Bae and James Frobisher, which is moving.Tom Hanks has quitted himself well as theeveryman actor of modern cinema andI have never seen Halle Berry so good since Monster Ball.This film should be watched for sheer entertainment value,some parts are better than others with the odd, idiosycratic false nose,teeth or wig standing out,but still for gutsiness,bravura,leaps taken,it's a remarkable spectacle for sweeping ambition and narrative boldness.Be warned to use subtitles for the 24th century patois episode.",4,""" Ancestors howlin' at you,yibberin' stories,all voices tied up into one""",1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,3719,"['major', 'new', 'film', 'underlying', 'theme', ""'re"", 'bound', 'together', 'true', 'love', 'never', 'taking', 'place', '6', 'stories', 'period', 'time', '19th', '24th', 'centuries.Ideas', 'reincarnation', 'metempsychosis', 'repetition', 'value', 'systems', 'monotheistic', 'religions', 'giving', 'sweep', 'freedom', 'manouevre.It', 'same', 'group', 'actors', 'Hanks', 'Berry', 'Wishaw', 'Grant', 'Broadbent', 'Sturgess', 'Weaving', ""D'Arcy"", 'Bae', 'Sarandon', 'act', 'different', 'characters', 'different', 'times', 'different', 'genres', 'different', 'races', 'can', 'seem', 'strange', 'times.You', 'visited', 'story', 'line', 'turn', 'went', 'back', 'reverse', 'order', 'Every', 'story', 'line', 'chopped', 'up', 'mosaic', 'storylines', 'zip', 'different', 'timelines', 'characters', 'confusing', '1st', 'time', 'watch', 'did', 'work.Larger', 'themes', 'liberation', 'tyranny', 'enslavement', 'crossing', 'boundaries', 'conventions', 'sacrifice', 'communication', 'forbidden', 'truths', 'are', 'woven', 'shifting', 'tapestry.Each', '6', 'episodes', 'succeeded', 'story', 'something', 'preceeding', 'story', 'be', 'journal', 'music', 'letters', 'motif.Based', 'Mitchell', 'source', 'novel', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'structured', 'Russian', 'doll', 'onion', 'Wachowskis', 'Tyker', 'use', 'syntax', 'crosscutting', 'montage', 'flashback', 'flashforward', 'interweave', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'various', 'genres.Narrative', 'strands', 'are', 'cut', 'up', 'reordered', 'appear', 'be', 'unfolding', 'simultaneously', 'gulfs', 'space', 'time.This', 'precise', 'structure', 'novel', 'work', 'big', 'screen.The', 'editing', 'immensely', 'sophisticated.By', 'historical', 'drama', 'dystopian', 'SF', 'post-apocalyptic', 'fable', 'nuclear', 'thriller', 'knock-about-farce', 'multi-ethnic', 'meal', 'many', 'dishes', 'round', 'world.One', 'can', 'admire', 'ambition', 'risks', 'taken', 'maybe', 'only', 'parts', 'succeed', 'one', 'biggest', 'independent', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'costing', '100', 'million', 'loved', 'moments', 'knockabout', 'farce', 'nightmarish', 'modern-day', 'publishing', 'farce', 'Tim', 'Cavendish', 'Broadbent', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Nurse', 'Noakes', 'light', 'relief', 'playing', 'Old', 'Georgie', 'demonic', 'tempter', 'Old', 'Zachry', 'Hanks', 'post-apocalyptic', '24th', 'century', 'very', 'New', 'Age-y', 'feel', 'themes', 'movie', 'Carlos', 'Casteneda', 'mentioned', '70s', 'story', 'where', 'Luisa', 'Rey', 'Berry', 'wonders', 'why', 'keep', 'making', 'same', 'mistakes', 'Frobisher', 'Wishaw', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'Sextet', 'where', 'whole', 'movements', 'were', 'written', 'imagining', 'meeting', 'again', 'again', 'different', 'times', 'Hanks', 'nerdy', 'scientist', 'tells', 'Berry', 'when', 'opened', 'door', 'powerful', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'ran', 'bones', 'Most', 'care', 'seemed', 'be', 'given', 'Tyker-directed', '1930s', 'narrative', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'top', 'respective', 'games', 'feckless', 'young', 'Cambridge', 'drop-out', 'Robert', 'Frobisher', 'anddyspeptic', 'husk', 'Vyvyan', 'Ayrs', 'united', 'talent', 'music', 'Frobisher', 'case', 'fertile', 'peak', 'leading', 'composition', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'Sextet', 'name', 'film', 'Also', 'Neo-Seoul', 'near-future', 'dystopian', 'political', 'SF', 'excellent', 'sets', 'Blade', 'Runner-like', 'quality', 'acting', 'skills', 'Doona', 'Bae', 'James', 'Frobisher', 'moving.Tom', 'Hanks', 'quitted', 'well', 'theeveryman', 'actor', 'modern', 'cinema', 'andI', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'so', 'good', 'Monster', 'Ball.This', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'value', 'parts', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'odd', 'idiosycratic', 'false', 'nose', 'wig', 'standing', 'out', 'still', 'gutsiness', 'bravura', 'taken', 'remarkable', 'spectacle', 'sweeping', 'ambition', 'narrative', 'boldness.Be', 'warned', 'use', 'subtitles', '24th', 'century', 'patois', 'episode']",Cloud Atlas

The stories concern reincarnation of the soul (?) although it goes far beyond that. The same half dozen or so people in one life are connected in similar ways in different lives. And a person who gets a scar or mark in the future, will have that mark show up in the past as a birthmark. Clearly this film goes way beyond any simplistic idea of reincarnation and makes it into a cult doctrine.There are 6 separate tales, although the film seems to concentrate on the two future stories. ""Souls"" are connected by generally having the same people play different parts, or by connecting them through aforesaid mark. The beginning of the film was confusing as it presents the ending of the various lives.The lives of these people are not simple. They are filled with trauma, killing, and intrigue. Scenes are connected by showing people doing similar things in different life times such as passing through a door, i.e. the so called ""smart"" and ""clever"" aspect of the movie.Rather than asks questions about truth and free will, the movie gives you David Mitchell's answers, which you may or may not agree with. For those who believe in some universal bond that links lives past and present to the seemingly inane point that things that will happen in the future will effect the past, you should enjoy this film for a full 5 stars. For me the film was too artsy, telling stories in a disjointed fashion that lacked depth and meaning to my life.I would wait for the DVD to see this film as there are things that are easily missed and will need multiple viewings to grasp.If they really wanted to make their case, they should have named Tom Hanks ""Wilson"" as an island dweller.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity.",3,TRUTH IS SINGULAR,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,1776,"['one', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'stories', 'concern', 'reincarnation', 'soul', 'far', 'same', 'half', 'dozen', 'so', 'people', 'one', 'life', 'are', 'connected', 'similar', 'ways', 'different', 'lives', 'person', 'who', 'scar', 'mark', 'future', 'will', 'have', 'mark', 'show', 'up', 'past', 'birthmark', 'Clearly', 'film', 'way', 'simplistic', 'idea', 'reincarnation', 'cult', 'are', '6', 'separate', 'tales', 'film', 'concentrate', 'two', 'future', 'stories', 'Souls', 'are', 'connected', 'generally', 'having', 'same', 'people', 'play', 'different', 'parts', 'connecting', 'aforesaid', 'mark', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'confusing', 'ending', 'various', 'lives.The', 'lives', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'simple', 'are', 'filled', 'trauma', 'killing', 'intrigue', 'Scenes', 'are', 'connected', 'showing', 'people', 'doing', 'similar', 'things', 'different', 'life', 'times', 'such', 'passing', 'door', 'i.e', 'so', 'called', 'smart', 'clever', 'aspect', 'movie.Rather', 'asks', 'questions', 'truth', 'free', 'will', 'movie', 'David', 'Mitchell', 'answers', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'who', 'believe', 'universal', 'bond', 'lives', 'past', 'present', 'seemingly', 'inane', 'point', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'future', 'will', 'effect', 'past', 'should', 'enjoy', 'film', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'artsy', 'telling', 'stories', 'disjointed', 'fashion', 'lacked', 'depth', 'meaning', 'life.I', 'would', 'wait', 'DVD', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'easily', 'missed', 'will', 'need', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'grasp.If', 'really', 'wanted', 'make', 'case', 'should', 'have', 'named', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Wilson', 'island', 'dweller.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity']",Cloud Atlas

1586085,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0095HHM78,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 5]","""Cloud Atlas"", the new film from directors Lana and Andy Wachowski (the siblings behind ""The Matrix"" films) and Ton Tykwer (the German sensation ""Run, Lola, Run""), is not the best or most mind-blowing film you will ever see. But it deserves kudos for sheer scope of storytelling.Six different storylines, most in different centuries, depict the intertwined stories of how people's actions affect others in the past, present and future. That is, more or less, the official synopsis of the film. I'm not sure it works as the filmmakers envision, but the directors, each responsible for specific segments, make it work.The actors also seem to enjoy playing multiple roles, dressing up in costumes and heavy make-up to pop up in each segment as a different character. Each segment has a different central character and the actors responsible for these roles pop up in the other stories in supporting roles, sometime as a simple blink-and-you-miss-it cameo.Tom Hanks anchors two stories, both with Halle Berry. In one of these, set in San Francisco in the early 70s, Berry plays a journalist trying to uncover the mystery behind a local nuclear power plant. Hanks plays the scientist who may have the secret she needs. Flash forward a few centuries and Hanks plays a goat herder in a post apocalyptic society. He reluctantly agrees to help Berry, a futuristic visitor, complete a quest that could help mankind. Of the two, I found the post-Apocalyptic segment to be less successful. More on that later. The San Francisco segment is more watchable because it is a more conventional action tale.Jim Broadbent plays a book publisher in modern-day London who inadvertently checks himself into an old-folks home. This segment is one of the best because it contains a lot of dry British humor.In Neo Seoul, Jim Sturgess plays a man infatuated with Sonmi, a futuristic waitress played by Doona Bae. He helps Sonmi break free and they try to elude the authorities and life a free life. Combining familiar elements from other sci-fi films, the story feels recycled. Interesting to watch, but recycled.In 1936, Ben Whishaw plays Robert Frobisher, a struggling composer who goes to work for an aging great (Broadbent again). While working with the older composer, Frobisher writes the Cloud Atlas Sextet. This is actually my favorite segment because the story seems the most well-rounded. It is also the most classical and romantic, giving us something that Merchant-Ivory might have done.In the 19th Century, Sturgess plays the lawyer for a slave trading company who is being poisoned by a doctor (Hanks again) trying to steal the young barrister's gold.These stories don't have a lot of direct connections, but a couple of characters overlap, giving them a more tenuous connection. So why these stories? How do they connect? The connections the filmmakers try to establish seem to be more tenuous and really shouldn't work. But they do. Just.Despite the mixed success of the characters, the actors playing multiple roles help to tie the stories together. They don't appear to be playing descendants of one another, or even characters who are connected. But watching Hanks, Berry, Hugh Grant, Sturgess, Broadbent and the others pop up in each story gives the illusion they are connected. Most of the time, it is easy to spot the actors, despite heavy make-up, but a couple of the briefest cameos slip by. And a couple of the characters elicit laughter; in modern day London, Hanks plays a Cockney gangster who has just published his memoir. When he first pops up and begins speaking, people in the audience laugh, a response that feels unanticipated and unwanted. But this moment happens early in the lengthy film, before you get used to the idea of the actors popping up in unlikely places. Or maybe you simply become resigned to the idea.Hugh Grant pops up in most of the stories, playing everything from a slave trading reverend to a post-apocalyptic cannibal. His largest contribution is to the 1970s San Francisco segment. He plays a shifty administrator at the power plant, a part that seems the most his stereotypical on-screen persona.Hugo Weaving appears in every segment as a villain, adding an air of menace and even humor as only he can.Susan Sarandon and Keith David also play various roles throughout, adding a rich texture to the stories.For a ""sci-fi"" film directed by the people behind ""The Matrix"", there is very little use of special effects to evoke a sci-fi universe. There are two sequences set in the future, but the post-apocalyptic sequence could just as easily be a western. That leaves the Neo Seoul sequence, which is fun to watch, but doesn't really push the boundaries at all - we've seen everything they show in this segment before.Two of the segments, the 1936 segment featuring Ben Whishaw and the 19th century tale featuring Jim Sturgess, both feature voice over from the main characters, narrating the story. I understand why this choice was made, but it seems odd and jarring to have only these two segments feature this device. When the narrative begins whipping back and forth between the various timelines, it draws you out of the story to suddenly feel confronted by voice over.The post-Apocalyptic sequence is the most difficult to get into because the characters speak in a patois that takes some getting used to. It also provides the prologue and the epilogue for the film, making for a problematic beginning. But once the film gets going and the narrative begins whipping back and forth between the stories, you get carried along by the storytelling, eager to see each new twist and turn.""Cloud Atlas"" is a strange, sprawling film trying to depict something grand and meaningful. I'm not sure it tells that story, but the sheer scope of the storytelling ensure you will never be bored.",4,3 1/2 - Interesting But Falls Short of Thought-Provoking,1353974400,"11 27,

I'm sure many will figure it out and think I'm dumb for not catching on though. As far as what I thought about it...to me there was just too much of everything. The movie is basically little vignettes of characters that are supposedly connected to the others but it jumps around so much its hard to follow. Most movies like this have one main plot line they follow and branch off of that...this one just put them all together and I had a hard time following. The other big distraction was the make-up. I do like the way they had the same actors in each section to show their point but the whole time I was thinking...I think that's Hugh Grant, or is that Agent Smith? It seemed to take me out of the movie. It may seem like I'm bashing this movie but the truth is I couldn't follow it enough to form a real opinion.

It turns out everyone's life does, just not necessarily the way you might like or to the degree you might hope, or so says this latest offering from the creators of The Matrix trilogy based on a novel of the same name by David Mitchell.Chronologically, the first character we're introduced to is Adam Ewing. Ewing (played by Jim Sturgess) is an American lawyer travelling to the South Pacific to conduct business on behalf of his father-in-law. He witnesses the enslavement of the native islanders, offers passage to one who stows away on the ship, Autua (played by David Gyasi) and falls ill as a result of exposure to a parasite. Once incapacitated by his illness, Ewing is ""cared for"" by the maniacal Dr. Henry Goose (played by Tom Hanks). Eighty-seven years later, we're taken to the UK and introduced to a young man whose wealthy father sees him as an embarrassment and has disowned him. That man, Robert Frobisher (played by Ben Whishaw), dreams of being a composer. While hoping to achieve that, he takes a job dictating for a man whose already achieved fame of his own, Vyvyan Ayrs (played by Jim Broadbent), whose eyes are failing him. Despite Ayrs unpleasant demeanor, Frobisher proves up to the job and it allows him time to further his own ambitions. Flash forward another thirty-seven years, we meet Luisa Rey. Rey (played by Halle Berry who also portrays relatively minor characters in the previous storylines) is a second-generation journalist writing a story about a nuclear power plant that is opening in her hometown of San Francisco. Unexpectedly, she meets Rufus Sixsmith (former lover of the now-deceased Frobisher played by James D'Arcy). Sixsmith (D'Arcy) is a nuclear physicist who knows that the plant is unsafe and hopes to relay his knowledge to Rey and provide evidence to substantiate it. What neither Ray, Sixsmith, or Dr. Isaac Sachs (another whistleblower played by Tom Hanks) are aware of however, is that they are all being hunted by a man whose employers wish to see the plant open, no matter the risk to the environment or local residents. Once again, we jump ahead. This time, thirty-nine years to the present. There we meet Timothy Cavendish (played by Broadbent). Cavendish is a publisher at a publicity event for an author named Dermot Hoggins (Hanks). During the event, Hoggins sees a critic who panned his work and throws him off the balcony. While he is sent to jail for his actions, his book begins flying off the shelves resulting in a financial windfall for Cavendish. Members of the Hoggins family wish to take the proceeds Cavendish is receiving from the sales as a result of Dermot signing away his rights to them before going to jail. Cavendish goes on the run and his brother Denholme (played by Hugh Grant who, like the others, played roles of varied significance in the previous stories) sends him to an establishment that he mistakes for a hotel but that is, in fact, a secure home for the elderly. Rather than capitulate, Cavendish plots his escape with help from other unhappy residents, one of whom only says two words over and over during the planning of the escape and the escape itself.There are two more storylines which, together, span a time of two-hundred nine years into the future. Rather than describe them both, I'll simply conclude here with my thoughts on the film as a whole. Cloud Atlas, while not as brilliant as the hype made it out to be, is a great film. Hanks and company play all of their roles expertly.

To deny this fact is cynicism maybe even hateration.  The Wachowski's have filmed the un-filmable for a pittance as compared to current blockbusters.  There are moments of breathtaking emotion - as when Sonmi, a 22nd century synthetic servant girl has her neck collar removed.  There are moments of pure and astounding cinema - as when the slave unfurls the main sail of the ship upon which he has stowed away in hopes of earning legal passage or when Ms Berry's journalist character's Volkswagon Bug get run off of a bridge and into a body of water.  There are moments of laugh out loud humor.  This movie was never boring; the three hours flew by, and indeed I started it over again a few hours after finishing it the first time.  The plot is pretty much what you have read but here's the thing:  THIS FILM IS NOT PRETENTIOUS. It is a simple story.  Seriously.  It's not difficult to get your head 'round what;s going on.  That fact alone is a testament to the Wachowski's skill.  There are good guys and bad guys.  Sometimes the good guys win and sometimes they lose.  There is an overarching story the concludes satisfactorily.  There are sci-fi shootouts and bar room punchups.

It is a tapestry of six tales woven together, six tales set in six different eras. Each story employs cinematic genre conventions: comedy, historical drama, sci-fi thriller, post-apocalyptic action, etc.Actors including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Hugh Grant play different roles in each story arc. All threads are thematically connected to each other in various ways. A certain phrase or action recurs throughout the ""main"" storyline. This is an ambitious project, something like modern-day version of D.W. Griffith's ""Intolerance."" And like ""Intolerance,"" ""Cloud Atlas"" failed at the box office.So is the film so bad? I found some narrative threads are weak, but at least I wasn't bored. The film itself is not hard to follow. The skillful editing that connects six narratives seamlessly is just wonderful. As to the film's content, while some viewers find ""Cloud Atlas"" thought-provoking, others will find it rather shallow and pretentious. I happened to fall in the latter group, though I admit the way the film keeps telling its stories like Scheherazade is fascinating.""Cloud Atlas"" is directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski of ""Matrix"" fame, and Tom Tykwer, best known for ""Run Lola Run."" If you have seen these two films, where style takes precedence over substance, you know what you are in for.

Joe"", ""Identity Thief"", or the latest Tyler Perry dreck -- it's no surprise that most American movie goers aren't imaginative, well-read, or, let's face it, bright enough to understand or figure the relatively simple, but true, message behind ""Cloud Atlas"".And expecting them to be able to figure out that Tom Hanks, as Zachary, is speaking in the sort of broken English that would be prevalent after an Apocalyptic event due to set backs in civilization -- heck, it's even prevalent in parts of society today -- or to have the maturity to sit and figure out the disparate plot threads as the movie progresses is likely expecting too much of a society that has everything spoon-fed to it (via TV and the internet).But for THOSE VIEWERS INTELLIGENT AND MATURE ENOUGH (always remembering intelligence and maturity don't automatically come with age), ""Cloud Atlas"" is a visual cornucopia and a heartfelt message of hope.The various stories run the gamut of ""genres"", from an Historical sea-faring adventure set in the 1800s, to a romance between two men (one of them a bisexual musical composer) during the 1930s, to a mystery during the 1970s, to a comical misadventure amongst old folks in 2012, to a science fiction thriller in the mid 21st century to a dystopian, science fiction/fantasy parable in a time after an unnamed, apocalyptic event (the time in which Zachary lives).  All of it ""framed"" by an aged, ""story-telling"" Zachary as he recounts his life, and the lives of others, to a group of young children.Other reviewers have already encapsulated the various plot elements (check out the five star reviews, you'll find plenty), so I'll just say that the writer/directors and the actors have all done a great job of bringing together six disparate stories and making them one whole vision of world peopled by THOSE WHO TRY TO HELP ONE ANOTHER and THOSE WHO ONLY PREY ON OTHERS.A five-star film-viewing experience, for sure.",5,"A Fast-Paced, Epic That Blends SF with Romance and Mystery",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,2071,"['Considering', 'movies', 'are', 'popular', 'cinema', 'days', 'dumb', 'car-related', 'flicks', 'Fast', 'Furious', '6', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'latest', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'dreck', 'surprise', 'most', 'American', 'movie', 'goers', 'are', ""n't"", 'imaginative', 'well-read', 'let', 'face', 'bright', 'enough', 'understand', 'figure', 'relatively', 'simple', 'true', 'message', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', '.And', 'expecting', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Zachary', 'speaking', 'sort', 'broken', 'English', 'would', 'be', 'prevalent', 'Apocalyptic', 'event', 'due', 'set', 'backs', 'civilization', 'heck', 'even', 'prevalent', 'parts', 'society', 'today', 'have', 'maturity', 'sit', 'figure', 'out', 'disparate', 'plot', 'threads', 'movie', 'likely', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'society', 'everything', 'spoon-fed', 'TV', 'internet', '.But', 'THOSE', 'VIEWERS', 'INTELLIGENT', 'AND', 'MATURE', 'ENOUGH', 'always', 'remembering', 'intelligence', 'maturity', 'do', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'come', 'age', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'visual', 'cornucopia', 'heartfelt', 'message', 'hope.The', 'various', 'stories', 'run', 'gamut', 'genres', 'Historical', 'sea-faring', 'adventure', 'set', '1800s', 'romance', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'bisexual', 'musical', 'composer', '1930s', 'mystery', '1970s', 'comical', 'misadventure', 'old', 'folks', '2012', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'mid', '21st', 'century', 'dystopian', 'science', 'fiction/fantasy', 'parable', 'time', 'unnamed', 'apocalyptic', 'event', 'time', 'Zachary', 'framed', 'aged', 'story-telling', 'Zachary', 'life', 'lives', 'others', 'group', 'young', 'children.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'encapsulated', 'various', 'plot', 'elements', 'check', 'out', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'find', 'plenty', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'writer/directors', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'together', 'six', 'disparate', 'stories', 'making', 'one', 'whole', 'vision', 'world', 'peopled', 'THOSE', 'WHO', 'TRY', 'TO', 'HELP', 'ONE', 'ANOTHER', 'THOSE', 'WHO', 'ONLY', 'PREY', 'ON', 'OTHERS.A', 'five-star', 'film-viewing', 'experience', 'sure']",Cloud Atlas

This may not be one of them.""Cloud Atlas"" may not be your type of film but if it is and it intrigues you enough, you'll find yourself drawn back to watch it more than once because of the nonlinear storytelling which thematically links six different periods of time from the past, present to the future. The theme driving the film is that our lives have a ripple effect through time and that our souls continue to reappear with a chance of absolution for past mistakes. In some cases the characters (those played by Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant for example) continually get it wrong and grow worse with each incarnation.As others have pointed out ""Cloud Atlas"" is much likeThe Fountain [HD] except that the editing of the film links each era based on actions, events and what happens to the characters in each given year. The stories take place in the following times/places: 1849 in the South Pacific as a lawyer tries to broker a slave deal; England and Scotland in 1936 as a gay composer struggles to complete his own masterpiece; San Francisco, CA 1978 focusing ona reporter trying to break a story about a dangerous power plant who's life is in danger; England in 2012 as a publisher gets an unexpected windfall when his author (a former thug)kills a critic; the year 2144 in Neo Seoul (Korea) as a ""Fabricant"" (an artifically engineer person) is interviewed about leading a revolution prior to her execution; the big island in an undisclosed far future where Earth has fallen into two camps--one advanced and the other primative struggling to survive on what's left of our world.The Blu-ray is a very nice transfer of the film. Each period has a unique look to it in terms of the photography and color scheme. We also get a lossless 5.1 audio mix as well as Spanish and French tracks. There are also subtitles in all English, Spanish and French.The description by Amazon is incorrect. The film DOES include special features. There isn't a commentary track (which is sad but understandable given that Lana and Andy Wachowskis don't care for doing them) however both appear with co-director/co-writer Tom TykwerPerfume: The Story of a Murderer [HD] andRun Lola Run [Blu-ray] ) in a series of featurettes that include David Mitchell the author of the original novel.The featurettes:""A Film Like No Other"" (7:15), ""Everything Is Connected"" (8:00),""Impossible Adaptation"" (9:07),""The Essence of Acting"" (7:20),""Spaceships, Slaves and Sextets"",""The Bold Science Fiction of Cloud Atlas"" (7:14) and ""Eternal Recurrence"" (7:39)each focusing on a different aspect of the production from the adaptation of Mitchell's novel to the challenge of playing the mulitple characters and how the actors connected with them.The menu is static and, aside from the image from the cover of the box, surprisingly generic.For those willing to give the film a chance and not looking for a more conventional bit of entertainment ""Cloud Atlas"" is worth it. For others, it will be a journey that is as pointless as the characters Hugh Grant and Hugo Weaving play in the film.Not everyone will like the film and it takes getting used to a narrative not told in a conventional sense but for those up to the challenge ""Cloud Atlas"" is a rewarding (if flawed) film that tries to do things a bit differently.",4,"Blu-ray review: Challenging nonlinear story told in six different time periods (past-future) with the same ""souls"" in each story",1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,3318,"['Most', 'films', 'get', 'first', 'viewing', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'type', 'film', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'find', 'drawn', 'back', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'nonlinear', 'storytelling', 'thematically', 'six', 'different', 'periods', 'time', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'theme', 'driving', 'film', 'lives', 'have', 'ripple', 'effect', 'time', 'souls', 'continue', 'reappear', 'chance', 'absolution', 'past', 'mistakes', 'cases', 'characters', 'played', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'example', 'continually', 'get', 'wrong', 'grow', 'worse', 'incarnation.As', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'much', 'likeThe', 'Fountain', '[', 'HD', ']', 'editing', 'film', 'era', 'based', 'actions', 'events', 'what', 'characters', 'given', 'year', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'following', 'times/places', '1849', 'South', 'Pacific', 'lawyer', 'broker', 'slave', 'deal', 'England', 'Scotland', '1936', 'gay', 'composer', 'complete', 'own', 'masterpiece', 'San', 'Francisco', 'CA', '1978', 'focusing', 'reporter', 'trying', 'break', 'story', 'dangerous', 'power', 'plant', 'who', 'life', 'danger', 'England', '2012', 'publisher', 'unexpected', 'windfall', 'when', 'author', 'former', 'thug', 'critic', 'year', '2144', 'Neo', 'Seoul', 'Korea', 'Fabricant', 'artifically', 'engineer', 'person', 'interviewed', 'leading', 'revolution', 'prior', 'execution', 'big', 'island', 'undisclosed', 'far', 'future', 'where', 'Earth', 'fallen', 'two', 'camps', 'one', 'advanced', 'other', 'primative', 'struggling', 'survive', 'what', 'left', 'world.The', 'Blu-ray', 'very', 'nice', 'transfer', 'film', 'period', 'unique', 'look', 'terms', 'photography', 'color', 'scheme', 'also', 'get', 'lossless', '5.1', 'audio', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'Spanish', 'French', 'tracks', 'are', 'also', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French.The', 'description', 'Amazon', 'incorrect', 'film', 'DOES', 'include', 'special', 'features', ""n't"", 'commentary', 'track', 'sad', 'understandable', 'given', 'Lana', 'Andy', 'Wachowskis', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'doing', 'however', 'appear', 'co-director/co-writer', 'Tom', 'TykwerPerfume', 'Story', 'Murderer', '[', 'HD', ']', 'Lola', 'Run', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'series', 'featurettes', 'include', 'David', 'Mitchell', 'author', 'original', 'novel.The', 'featurettes', 'Film', 'Other', '7:15', 'Everything', 'Connected', '8:00', 'Impossible', 'Adaptation', '9:07', 'Essence', 'Acting', '7:20', 'Spaceships', 'Slaves', 'Sextets', 'Bold', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', '7:14', 'Eternal', 'Recurrence', '7:39', 'focusing', 'different', 'aspect', 'production', 'adaptation', 'Mitchell', 'novel', 'challenge', 'playing', 'mulitple', 'characters', 'how', 'actors', 'connected', 'them.The', 'menu', 'static', 'aside', 'image', 'cover', 'box', 'surprisingly', 'generic.For', 'willing', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'not', 'looking', 'more', 'conventional', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'journey', 'as', 'pointless', 'characters', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'play', 'film.Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'getting', 'used', 'narrative', 'not', 'told', 'conventional', 'sense', 'challenge', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'rewarding', 'flawed', 'film', 'do', 'things', 'bit', 'differently']",Cloud Atlas

Interesting relationships and ideas are cobbled together into a mish-mash of lunacy I have no patience to stitch together myself.They are all connected by karma, reincarnation, etc. but who the heck cares if I have to WORK at figuring out the storylines!?!  This movie is failure, in my opinion.  It requires way too much patience, time, backtracking, and the use of subtitles to even hear some of the dialogue!  Yes, the invented future speak is a cool idea, but subtitle it or do not cobble scenes from different eras and make believe eras together in such a confusing way!Ugghh.  This film was a frustrating mess.  It had so much potential.  Don't believe anyone who tells you it is so entertaining that they have to rewatch it again and again!  They are rewatching it because the movie is too hard to understand otherwise!AVOID at all costs.  At least someone can save money.  I didn't, but I wish--most of all- that I had my time and brainpower back!  lol.",2,"Terrible, Confusing, Pasted Scenes",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,1388,"['Well', 'was', 'waste', 'money', 'time', 'acting', 'Excellent', 'settings', 'Superb', 'beautiful', 'effects', 'make-up', 'Really', 'cool', 'really', 'well-done.The', 'story', 'demon-possessed', 'professor', 'philosophy', 'religion', 'rambling', 'darkened', 'room', 'Scenes', 'differing', 'storylines', 'are', 'cut', 'pasted', 'beside', 'other', 'coherence', 'forget', 'who', 'everyone', 'why', 'should', 'even', 'care', 'remember', 'Interesting', 'relationships', 'ideas', 'are', 'cobbled', 'together', 'mish-mash', 'lunacy', 'have', 'patience', 'stitch', 'together', 'myself.They', 'are', 'connected', 'karma', 'reincarnation', 'etc', 'who', 'heck', 'have', 'WORK', 'figuring', 'out', 'storylines', 'movie', 'failure', 'opinion', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'patience', 'time', 'backtracking', 'use', 'subtitles', 'even', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'Yes', 'invented', 'future', 'speak', 'cool', 'idea', 'do', 'not', 'cobble', 'scenes', 'different', 'eras', 'make', 'believe', 'eras', 'together', 'such', 'confusing', 'way', 'Ugghh', 'film', 'was', 'frustrating', 'mess', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', 'so', 'entertaining', 'have', 'rewatch', 'again', 'again', 'are', 'rewatching', 'movie', 'too', 'hard', 'understand', 'otherwise', 'AVOID', 'costs', 'least', 'someone', 'can', 'save', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'wish', 'most', 'all-', 'had', 'time', 'brainpower', 'back', 'lol']",Cloud Atlas

It tells 6 different stories in six different genres that span 6 different times with each story involving how a few different archetypes (or if you wish souls) interact with each.Although it may be tempting, do not watch this movie in the hopes of patching together a common timeline or reincarnation cycle. Each story is referenced in the next chronological story  and it is hinted that some of the stories within stories may be fictional. This is an interesting take, on the effect of writing across time.All of what I have mentioned is also in the book and this movie is a competent re-telling of the book. The stories in the movie are intertwined while in the book each story is told in two halfs one in the first half of the book and one in the second half. I think this is a wise decision to help make the movie flow fluidly. The movie does a good job of helping you keep track of each story and the way it cuts the stories together help you see their similarities. Each of the sub stories could be a solid entry in the genre of film that it represents. To be able to combine these genres is an amazing feet.I have now seen Cloud Atlas 6 times and the movie inspired me to read the book. And each time I watch it I see more.
