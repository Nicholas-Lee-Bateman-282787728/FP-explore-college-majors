933789,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000AV8ZMO,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","The last time the name of famous (1960s famous) French experimental filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard appeared in this space was in last year's retro-review of his documentary/didactic montage of The  Rolling Stones as they went through their paces in creating the rock classic ""Sympathy For The Devil"" in 1968. I faulted Godard's  efforts there for trying the patience of even the most ardent Stones fan (including this reviewer) with his interspersing of 1960s hard political rhetoric and zany antics with a rather long drawn out exposition on the creative process that it took to create a song lasting a few moments. All the faults there, however, turn into pluses in this 1967 look at the trials and tribulation of a small group of ardent radicals trying to make sense of their world (their French world, by the way) during the tumultuous 1960s and during the heat of the struggle to break with, what in France, was the status quo- adherent to the Communist Party that, although having at one time perspective for socialist revolution and the road to a communist society, had seemingly given up that mantle to Mao and the Chinese Revolution.The story line here is fairly simple, although perhaps rather obscure to the last couple of generations since the generation of '68 had its heyday. Fair enough.  I need not spent much time on this however because the story line has its antecedents in, and the script fairly accurately follows, the famous Russian writer Dostoevsky's novel ""The Possessed"". (Dostoevsky, by the way came within a hairbreadth of the hangman's noose for his own youthful political activism, something which colors in a perverse way the cautionary tale he tells).  The plot centers on  a small group of college students who, during the summer break and with time on their hands,  are struggling with ideas about their place in the world, their seeming being left out of the decision-making process of that world, and most importantly, for the ""lessons"" to be taken from the film what to do about it. That small group which as the plot unfurls turns itself into a political cell, as was the nature of the times, turned to revolutionary politics, or what they thought was revolutionary politics in an attempt resolve these conflicts.The beauty of Godard experimentalism in this work is that, although there is some dialogue it really does not depend on that as much as the visually imaginary that he projects. I mentioned above his use of montage in the Stones film. Here he, seemingly, pored through every known photograph of every known, wannabe or has-been revolutionary up until that time as he adds to his main story. However, that is only part of the brilliant use of film here. I will just point out a couple shots that struck me. Most of the action takes place at cell headquarters, an apartment where the students live, read, smoke many cigarettes, and are lectured to, and at, on Mao Thought. Visually the process of turning the group from bored, if intelligent, students to armchair Red Guards is shown by the depletion of the library from the standards of Western literature until near the end the shelves are almost filled with Red Books.Another is the use of lectures in traditional lecture style in the tiny apartment where there are only three or four others present. They took turns at this. The most interesting one was when the pro-Moscow student tried to lecture and was given boos and catcall for his efforts. No one said there was no shortage of infantilism in those days, as the overhead cost of trying to figure out the political universe. There are many other shots like these that give you a fairly realistic picture of that small world, replicated many, many times throughout the world in those days.

933790,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000AV8ZMO,Doug Anderson,"[8, 10]","Some of Godards films are consistently entertaining (Breathless, My Life to Live, Band of Outsiders, Alphaville, Weekend, Pierrot Le Fou) while others are less so.La Chinoise (1967) is smart as all of Godard's works are, but only mildly entertaining. Its content, style of critique, & entertainment value put it on par with Godard's other (and later) meditation on the intersection of pop culture & revolutionary politics, Sympathy for the Devil (1968). Both films deal with revolutionary politics & pop culture & how even radical cells reproduce the dominant culture's patriarchal paradigms.La Chinoise is the story of a group of middle-class revolutionaries. The leader of this revolutionary troupe is played by a gentrified Jean-Pierre Leaud who, despite his many bourgeois trappings, nonetheless spends every waking hour reading from one revolutionary text or another. While it might be impossible to say exactly how much of this revolutionary talk had gotten to Godard, it is clear (at least at this point in his career) that he can still see both the comic and tragic irony of trying to be both revolutionary & bourgeoisie at the same time. Leaud is not as interesting nor as exciting to watch as Belmondo, but Godard has a lot of fun with this character who is so saturated with revolutionary theory that he is thrilled when one of his comrades gets beaten up by a rival faction because this is proof to him that all of his theorizing and political posturing has some connection to and effect upon reality. Eventually, to underscore Leauds bourgeois narcissism, Godard has him go on a tirade against mere actors while dressed as Napoleon.Many of the more entertaining sequences involve the ""revolutionaries"" painting artfully crafted slogans on their dining room walls; Godard dwells on this to emphasize that the aesthetics of revolution are really what turns them on. And, if that is not enough, to emphasize the utter aestheticization and utter unreality of revolution to the insulated bourgeoisie, Godard also has them play with a toy camera that transforms into a toy machine gun. Godard seems to be saying that the revolutionaries do not make any real distinction between playing at being revolutionaries and actually being revolutionaries. For most of them just playing is enough. However, when one of the revolutionaries actually toys with a real gun and begins assassinating political opponents, its then that each of the players has to ask themselves just how seriously they take all of the revolutionary theory they spend their days & nights consuming.But, before any decision can be made, everything is decided for them as their revolutionary hideout must be abandoned for it was really only on loan to them for the summer. When the bourgeoisie inhabitants of the house return one of them is disgusted at the revolutionary decor and literature that the summer tenants have left behind, but one of them shows at least a passing interest in it (perhaps this is the only clue in the film that something will come of all of the revolutionary's efforts). Its all kind of funny but also all kind of sad that so much youthful idealism has no real outlet in late capitalist society.The end feeling is that Godard is as ambivalent about these kids (both the revolutionary and the bourgeoisie kids) as we are.Since Godard himself was not affiliated with any academy or institution or party he was in a unique position to call revolutionary politics as practiced by a certain social group as he saw them. And it is refreshing to see Godard treat marxist & maoist politics with the same iconoclastic style that he brings to everything else that he critiques.But in 1969 Godard would embrace maoist politics and this affiliation would mark the end of Godard's most interesting phase as an artist.Politics & aesthetics do not get along very well. Politics reduce humans to collectives and art to propaganda; whereas aesthetics, at their most vital, assert the sovereignty of the individual. Hence the unsatisfying nature of much of Godards late sixties (beginning with La Gai Savoir, 1969) and seventies output (much of which was collaborative work).Once the artist's sovereign vision is gone so too is the appeal of his art.",3,"not particularly compelling, but worth a look",1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,4230,"['Godards', 'films', 'are', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'Breathless', 'My', 'Life', 'Live', 'Band', 'Outsiders', 'Alphaville', 'Weekend', 'Pierrot', 'Le', 'Fou', 'others', 'are', 'less', 'so.La', 'Chinoise', '1967', 'smart', 'Godard', 'works', 'are', 'only', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'content', 'style', 'critique', 'entertainment', 'value', 'put', 'par', 'Godard', 'other', 'later', 'meditation', 'intersection', 'pop', 'culture', 'revolutionary', 'politics', 'Sympathy', 'Devil', '1968', 'films', 'deal', 'revolutionary', 'politics', 'pop', 'culture', 'how', 'even', 'radical', 'cells', 'reproduce', 'dominant', 'culture', 'patriarchal', 'paradigms.La', 'Chinoise', 'story', 'group', 'middle-class', 'revolutionaries', 'leader', 'revolutionary', 'troupe', 'played', 'gentrified', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Leaud', 'who', 'many', 'bourgeois', 'trappings', 'nonetheless', 'waking', 'hour', 'reading', 'one', 'revolutionary', 'text', 'might', 'be', 'impossible', 'say', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'revolutionary', 'talk', 'had', 'gotten', 'Godard', 'clear', 'least', 'point', 'career', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'comic', 'tragic', 'irony', 'trying', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'bourgeoisie', 'same', 'time', 'Leaud', 'not', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'watch', 'Belmondo', 'Godard', 'lot', 'fun', 'character', 'who', 'so', 'saturated', 'revolutionary', 'theory', 'thrilled', 'when', 'one', 'comrades', 'beaten', 'up', 'rival', 'faction', 'proof', 'theorizing', 'political', 'posturing', 'connection', 'effect', 'reality', 'Eventually', 'underscore', 'Leauds', 'bourgeois', 'narcissism', 'Godard', 'go', 'tirade', 'mere', 'actors', 'while', 'dressed', 'Napoleon.Many', 'more', 'entertaining', 'sequences', 'involve', 'revolutionaries', 'painting', 'artfully', 'crafted', 'slogans', 'dining', 'room', 'walls', 'Godard', 'emphasize', 'aesthetics', 'revolution', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'not', 'enough', 'emphasize', 'utter', 'aestheticization', 'utter', 'unreality', 'revolution', 'insulated', 'bourgeoisie', 'Godard', 'also', 'play', 'toy', 'camera', 'toy', 'machine', 'gun', 'Godard', 'be', 'saying', 'revolutionaries', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'real', 'distinction', 'playing', 'being', 'revolutionaries', 'actually', 'being', 'revolutionaries', 'most', 'just', 'playing', 'enough', 'However', 'when', 'one', 'revolutionaries', 'actually', 'real', 'gun', 'assassinating', 'political', 'opponents', 'then', 'players', 'ask', 'just', 'how', 'seriously', 'take', 'revolutionary', 'theory', 'spend', 'days', 'nights', 'consuming.But', 'decision', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'everything', 'decided', 'revolutionary', 'hideout', 'must', 'be', 'abandoned', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'loan', 'summer', 'When', 'bourgeoisie', 'inhabitants', 'house', 'return', 'one', 'disgusted', 'revolutionary', 'decor', 'literature', 'summer', 'tenants', 'have', 'left', 'behind', 'one', 'least', 'passing', 'interest', 'perhaps', 'only', 'clue', 'film', 'something', 'will', 'come', 'revolutionary', 'efforts', 'kind', 'funny', 'also', 'kind', 'sad', 'so', 'much', 'youthful', 'idealism', 'real', 'outlet', 'late', 'capitalist', 'society.The', 'end', 'feeling', 'Godard', 'ambivalent', 'kids', 'revolutionary', 'bourgeoisie', 'kids', 'are.Since', 'Godard', 'was', 'not', 'affiliated', 'academy', 'institution', 'party', 'was', 'unique', 'position', 'call', 'revolutionary', 'politics', 'practiced', 'certain', 'social', 'group', 'saw', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Godard', 'treat', 'marxist', 'maoist', 'politics', 'same', 'iconoclastic', 'style', 'everything', 'else', '1969', 'Godard', 'would', 'embrace', 'maoist', 'politics', 'affiliation', 'would', 'mark', 'end', 'Godard', 'most', 'interesting', 'phase', 'artist.Politics', 'aesthetics', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'Politics', 'reduce', 'humans', 'collectives', 'art', 'propaganda', 'whereas', 'aesthetics', 'most', 'vital', 'assert', 'sovereignty', 'individual', 'Hence', 'unsatisfying', 'nature', 'much', 'Godards', 'late', 'sixties', 'beginning', 'La', 'Gai', 'Savoir', '1969', 'seventies', 'output', 'much', 'was', 'collaborative', 'work', '.Once', 'artist', 'sovereign', 'vision', 'gone', 'so', 'too', 'appeal', 'art']",N/A

933792,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000AV8ZMO,Paul Allaer,"[1, 2]","Movie: 2.5 stars; Extras: 5 stars; Historical context/significance: 4.5 starsI stumbled on this movie the other day at the foreign library section of my local library, not knowing a whole lot about the movie, other than it being directed by Jean-Luc Godard, and that was good enough for me.""La Chinoise"" (1967 release; 93 min.) brings the story of university students forming a cell over one summer at one of their parents apartment and studying the word of Mao, Marx and Lenin, with the hope/intent to ""start the revolution"". I will say it upfront: the movie comes across at times as incredibly dated (it is now 45 years later after all), and hence is tedious and difficult to watch. You can just feel Godard's leftist leanings seeping in throught the movie. So take the movie for what it is. The movie of course precedes the infamous Paris student protests which would come about exactly a year later.However, what makes this a winner in my book are the DVD extras: a solid introduction from Colin MacCabe, a Godard-connaisseur, kicks things off. Then it gets really interesting: a faily short interview with Godard as he is editing the movie, which is follwed by an even better excerpt of the press conference given by Godard at the Venice Film Festival, in which Godard reveals himself as bitter and insufferable (ranting ""I have to smile to people whom I detest and wish I could shoot"", etc.). But the best is saved for last: a fascinating interview from 1987 with Anne Wiazemsky, who stars as Veronique in ""La Chinoise"" and at the time was married to Godard (even though he was basically twice her age). She brings lots of juicy details on what it was like to shoot the movie pretty much in the apartment that she and Godard were living in at the time, etc. etc. In all, I found this movie, including the DVD extras, a time capsule from now 45 years ago well worth the look.",4,Time capsule well worth the look,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,1880,"['Movie', '2.5', 'stars', 'Extras', '5', 'stars', 'Historical', 'context/significance', '4.5', 'starsI', 'stumbled', 'movie', 'other', 'day', 'foreign', 'library', 'section', 'local', 'library', 'not', 'knowing', 'whole', 'lot', 'movie', 'other', 'being', 'directed', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'La', 'Chinoise', '1967', 'release', '93', 'min', 'story', 'university', 'students', 'forming', 'cell', 'one', 'summer', 'one', 'parents', 'apartment', 'studying', 'word', 'Mao', 'Marx', 'Lenin', 'hope/intent', 'start', 'revolution', 'will', 'say', 'upfront', 'movie', 'across', 'times', 'incredibly', 'dated', 'now', '45', 'years', 'later', 'hence', 'tedious', 'difficult', 'watch', 'can', 'just', 'feel', 'Godard', 'leftist', 'leanings', 'seeping', 'throught', 'movie', 'So', 'take', 'movie', 'what', 'movie', 'course', 'infamous', 'Paris', 'student', 'protests', 'would', 'come', 'about', 'exactly', 'year', 'later.However', 'what', 'winner', 'book', 'are', 'DVD', 'extras', 'solid', 'introduction', 'Colin', 'MacCabe', 'Godard-connaisseur', 'things', 'off', 'Then', 'really', 'interesting', 'faily', 'short', 'interview', 'Godard', 'editing', 'movie', 'follwed', 'even', 'better', 'excerpt', 'press', 'conference', 'given', 'Godard', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Godard', 'bitter', 'insufferable', 'ranting', 'have', 'smile', 'people', 'whom', 'detest', 'wish', 'could', 'shoot', 'etc.', 'best', 'saved', 'last', 'fascinating', 'interview', '1987', 'Anne', 'Wiazemsky', 'who', 'Veronique', 'La', 'Chinoise', 'time', 'was', 'married', 'Godard', 'even', 'was', 'basically', 'twice', 'age', 'lots', 'juicy', 'details', 'what', 'was', 'shoot', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'apartment', 'Godard', 'were', 'living', 'time', 'etc', 'etc', 'found', 'movie', 'including', 'DVD', 'extras', 'time', 'capsule', 'now', '45', 'years', 'ago', 'well', 'look']",N/A
