724650,A16X9JQY55VRF4,B000077VQC,Bart Chase,"[1, 1]",An awesome account of the recording of one of the greatest rock n roll albums ever made. This is an awesome docu with great insight into the band from the begining and all through the creation of these songs. And the recording that made history and helped create a movement to destroy the boring establishment that rock n roll had become. Another great dvd in this series is the Motorhead Ace of Spades. It's great too.,5,great dvd,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,419,"['awesome', 'account', 'recording', 'one', 'greatest', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'albums', 'ever', 'made', 'awesome', 'docu', 'great', 'insight', 'band', 'begining', 'creation', 'songs', 'recording', 'made', 'history', 'helped', 'create', 'movement', 'destroy', 'boring', 'establishment', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'had', 'become', 'great', 'dvd', 'series', 'Motorhead', 'Ace', 'Spades', 'great', 'too']",N/A
724651,A2QMRHJOWJSDOQ,B000077VQC,"Clark Paull ""(Sleepin' with the TV on)""","[33, 35]","As other reviewers have mentioned, this nifty little documentary will take you by surprise and throw you for a loop.  Upon initial examination of the case, I was half expecting a cheesy VH-1 or MTV-style piece, poorly researched and rehashing facts and half-truths that us Sex Pistols fans have heard told over and over again.  The cliche about not judging a book, er, DVD, by its cover is especially apropos here since the producers have really done their homework and managed to gather revelatory interview footage from all of the culprits involved in the making of the band's ""only"" (God, does that term rankle me - doesn't ""The Great Rock & Roll Swindle"" count?) album, including the band (minus Sid of course), Malcolm McLaren, producer Chris Thomas, engineer Bill Price, and record company man Nick Mobbs.  Interspersed with the interviews are clips of the band playing live in clubs and on TV and generally wreaking havoc in and around London (""The Bill Grundy Show"" anyone?), most of which are familiar to fans of the band, but which never seem to get old.  Of particular interest  is learning that John Lydon can actually let his guard down and smile (and should do so more often - it suits him), Steve Jones demonstrating just how he gets that guitar sound by effortlessly casting off patented wall-of-noise riffs from his white Les Paul, and Price showing how he combined guitar, bass, drum and vocal tracks in the studio to create a big, beautiful din that a thousand Nirvanas couldn't come close to duplicating if their lives depended on it.  Loaded with extras, including an additional segment of Jones basically showing off on guitar (I know I'm dwelling on Jones, but I'm fascinated by the technology of guitars and amps and he's so amiable you just want to buy him a pint) and crystal clear live footage shot in Stockholm, this wonderful disc demands a look.

One thing I really liked about this is you didn't have Johnny Lydon speaking about the history of the Sex Pistols with anger and spite of earlier interviews which distorted the truth, it was more like he was fondly reminiscing factually about being in the Sex Pistols and giving up his ego and telling of his faults.Another great thing it was just clips of performances, photos and one on one interviews with the band, producers, techincians and record company executives, no dramatics or no other bands or fans talking about them which would muddle the documentary.

724655,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,B000077VQC,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[5, 5]","This is a great DVD. Even long time Sex Pistols fans might get a new tidbit of information that they had never known. For the first time maybe in their lives, the members of the Pistols are very candid and maybe even a bit nostalgic, even though none of them are seen together and they are all interviewed seperately. Steve loves Johnny, but that doesn't mean he wants to hang out with him, Johnny is proud of all the members, and Glenn shows no hard feelings. Paul had the least amount to say, but what he said was direct and to the point. Sid Vicious gets very little time. He is seen in the live footage and Johnny talks about him in a short bonus feature. The only idiot on the entire DVD is Malcolm, but that's really no big surprise. He always has and always will be a tool.We finally learn who played what on the album itself. Glen did play the bass guitar on Anarchy, and Steve played two seperate guitar tracks, one track serving as the bass.They even tracked down the guy who did the artwork for the Pistols.I think of all those in the band Steve has the most intelligent insight. He admitted that if they had kept Glen and did not do the TV show where they cursed on the air, the Pistols would have lasted longer and recorded more albums.I came to my own conclusion that Glen was not fired for 'constantly washing his feet', but because he was the most competant musician of the group. Glen tried to teach STeve how to play what he called 'Beatle chords' and Steve refused to play them and just stuck with the major chords in bar form.If I have anything negetive to say about the DVD, don't be taken in by the 'Play guitar in a day the Steve Jones Way'. Steve does demonstrate how to play a few riffs, and on his original Les Paul with the pinup girls. But would it have killed the camera man to have the camera straight on the guitar and not film the riffs at a 45 degree angle? I know how to play the songs anyway, I've had the original tab book for years, but the camera angle on the guitar on this sequence is terrible.The boys are alive and well though and getting ready to do some shows soon (November 2007). On the DVD Paul actually looks pretty good and resembles any number of one hit wonder musicians from the 80's. Glen looks like a rather dapper chap and if you didn't know him, you'd think he was a sales manager and not a musician. Steve Jones looks more like a retired wrestler than a punk guitarist, and Johnny..... Well Johnny has aged some. His earlobes are dangling almost comically. As if he had been wearing 5 pound earrings for ten years, and it is obvious he has never cared about his hair, from his glory days until today. I don't know who painted the blue stripe, but Johnny is Johnny.And saints be praised.

We are treated to candid and relaxed interviews with the important characters involved in bringing this great album to life.I think this makes a great companion documentary to THE FILTH AND THE FURY; a fine documentary, kind of using the anti-gloss, cut-up approach for highlighting the influences, the rise, the fall and impact of the SEX PISTOLS.  For me, NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS has never grown old, the music brilliantly simple.  In addition, knowing the history of the band, it makes the music that much richer.  On this documentary - John Lydon speaks fondly to the comic, almost camp feel at the heart of this album.  Steve Jones laments that if they hadn't kicked Glen out, if they didn't do the Bill Grundy show - there may have been more albums from the SEX PISTOLS.The bonus material is simply stuff that was excised from the main event of this DVD, because it strays away from the subject of the album itself.  It is possible this was originally aired as a series on television, and they had to trim everything for interest of time?  Whatever the case, I wish they just presented it as a whole - all included.

When I watched it I thought it was another great documentary about the album and you also hear a little bit about their history too.  Everyone in the band is interviewed (except Sid ofcourse.)  Rotten is extreemly interesting and hillarious as always.  When you hear him talk you'll realize just how smart of a person he really is.  Steve Jones plays some guitar and shows how he came up with some of the guitar parts for certain songs.  Malcom is also very interesting to hear saying he didn't want to be a manager for the band but rather a mismanager.  I always thought that guy was a quack.  They talk about all the biggest moments such as the Bill Grundy show, God Save The Queen on a boat, and the artwork for the album including interviews with the artist Jaimie Reed.  If you're a big Sex Pitols fan or just love this album then it is very essential you pick up this dvd.  This is one of my favorites in my dvd collection. There are also plenty of bonus features including a hillarious story about Johnny Rotten meeting Freddie Mercury who was with Queen recording in the studio in the same building.

And unlike ""the Filth and the Fury"" you'll get to hear the band and friends explain themselves in daylight!The band and their colaborators, including McLaren, provide anecdotes regarding the bands history and infamous incidents that aren't even included in Julien Temple's films. This film is as close to the Pistols themselves as you're liable to get without knowing the band personally.An outstanding value, worth more than just money. I've never loved the band more than listening to them speak here, and I've rarely been as impressed with the value and quality of a dvd purchase.",5,Outstanding interviews and footage!,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,1282,"['short', 'value', 'dvd', 'treasure', 'interviews', 'footage', 'created', 'professionally', 'accuracy', 'integrity', 'not', 'mention', 'complicity', 'cooperation', 'surviving', 'Pistols', 'cohorts.You', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'Lydon', 'Matlock', 'discuss', 'how', 'songs', 'were', 'written', 'witness', 'Jones', 'play', 'person', 'how', 'created', 'riffs', 'openings', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'EXTENSIVE', 'interviews', 'producer', 'how', 'arranged', 'tracks', 'gave', 'signature', 'punch', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'bits', 'many', 'individual', 'unaltered', 'recording', 'tracks', 'dry', 'way', 'production', 'done', 'lively', 'off-the-cuff', 'manner', 'will', 'suck', 'make', 'wish', 'were', 'three', 'times', 'longer', 'Filth', 'Fury', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hear', 'band', 'friends', 'explain', 'daylight', 'band', 'colaborators', 'including', 'McLaren', 'provide', 'anecdotes', 'regarding', 'bands', 'history', 'infamous', 'incidents', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'included', 'Julien', 'Temple', 'films', 'film', 'as', 'close', 'Pistols', ""'re"", 'liable', 'get', 'knowing', 'band', 'personally.An', 'outstanding', 'value', 'more', 'just', 'money', ""'ve"", 'never', 'loved', 'band', 'more', 'listening', 'speak', 'here', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'been', 'impressed', 'value', 'quality', 'dvd', 'purchase']",N/A
