897036,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00080ETYA,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[200, 211]","""Saints and Soldiers"" is a gripping account of four soldiers who escape the brutal Malmedy Massacre in December, 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge. They are behind enemy lines, sleepless, hungry, and just trying to survive, when they find a downed British flight sergeant, whose mission is to reach allied troops with important coded information, so together they make the arduous and dangerous journey with that end in mind.The plot is a compilation of true stories, and even the one that seems improbable, the meeting of the American and German soldiers who were friends before the war, was taken from a real event.This film puts a human face on the horror of war. We get to know these men, their fears and their bravery, and they are characters who stay with you long after the film is over. Made on a tiny budget of under $ 1,000,000 in less than a month, with a cast of unknown actors, this film has won numerous awards, and deservedly so. Shot on location in Utah, which substitutes for the Ardennes forest, director Ryan Little was also the cinematographer, and has done a superb job with both tasks.The ""extras"" used in the massacre scene were ""re-enactors,"" who came from all over the country at their own expense to take part in this film, and memorialize this little known part of WWII history, and it is an amazing opening sequence that sets the mood for the film. Also enhancing the atmosphere is the subtle, lovely soundtrack by J. Bateman and Bart Henderson.The ensemble cast is excellent, with the most memorable character being ""Deacon,"" played with depth and emotion by Corbin Allred, who captures the innocence of the part. The other marvelous performances are by Alexander Niver Polinsky as Gould, Kirby Heyborne as Flight Sergeant Winley, Lawrence Bagby as Kendrick, Peter Asle Holden as Gunderson, and Ethan Vincent as Rudi.The DVD extras are fascinating, and give us a glimpse into how this film was ingeniously made on so little money. The director and producers were exceedingly resourceful, and are interviewed in ""The Making of Saints and Soldiers,"" as well as the writers of the terrific script, Geoffrey Panos and Matt Whittaker. Watching the film with their commentary is also interesting and adds to the appreciation of what they call ""The little film that could.""This is a beautiful, intimate war film, a small gem not to be missed.

I was stunned to learn that this movie was made for a million dollars, on screen it looks like a full-budget feature film with plenty of production value.  The sense of place is compelling; the snowy woods are beautiful and forbidding all at once.  We feel tremendous empathy for this band of unfortunate soldiers at war with both the elements and the German soldiers who surround them.A scroll at the movie's start states that the story is based on actual events.  This increasingly commonplace technique does not add value.  Indeed, it is true, to one extent or another, of all stories.  Further, it is intended to add weight, drama, and validity to what we are about to see.  Unless the story is literally accurate, this seems like a cheap device.  In war there are a thousand stories like this, where ordinary people achieve extraordinary things as they find themselves in inconceivable situations.  It is the responsibility of the story to generate its own drama.The no-name cast does a very credible job and certainly deserve to get more work based on their performances here.  The problem is with the ham-fisted symbolism of the script, and the really shabby dialogue.  The symbolism is high school English stuff and revolves around the character of Deacon.  Deacon was a missionary in Germany before the war, but is also the group's best marksman!  Gosh, how ironic.  Deacon's humanism transcends the goodies versus baddies mentality that drives everyone else - when he inevitably dies the director actually has the nerve to pose him on the ground ala Jesus on the cross.  Starting with a great story and reducing it to blatant manipulation of this sort is the kind of twaddle we are used to in big budget pictures.Worse still is the dialogue itself.  The smallest amount of care would have eliminated many phrases that did not come into fashion for at least 30 years after the war ended.  I fully expected Deacon to say, ""Oh ma gawd, I am so totally sure, my rifle jammed, oh whatever, Heather!""  This is sloppy at best.  Also questionable was the stereotypical British paratrooper who would have been more comfortable on an episode of Fawlty Towers than in this film.  Director Ryan Little would do well to remember that the British were fighting the Germans for many years before the Americans showed up.A good film that missed being great.

897043,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B00080ETYA,Brian C.,"[6, 6]","I do not usually write reviews for movies and I almost never write what I would consider ""negative"" reviews. I do not, in general, enjoy being overly critical especially when it is clear, as it is in the case of this movie, that those involved were putting forth a real effort. But I do feel compelled to offer my honest opinion on this film. People should not necessarily take my word for it. There seem to be plenty of people who enjoyed this film so perhaps you (anyone reading this) will as well.I should also give my SPOILER ALERT at this point. I do reveal a great deal of what happens in the film in this review so if that bothers you, and you have not seen the film yet, you probably should not read on. Personally I think the film was predictable enough that it does not really matter all that much whether you know what is going to happen or not. I feel quite certain that I could have guessed the ending, and how every conflict in the film would be resolved (Is the medic going to continue to hate the Germans and remain an atheist, or, is he going to realize the error of his ways?) fairly early into the movie.The film had a good set up. A group of American soldiers narrowly escape being slaughtered by the Germans as prisoners of war. They band together and in their attempts to make their way back across enemy lines they encounter a soldier from the British air-force who is in possession of some very important information about the German offensive. All the makings of a pretty good war flick, right? So why did I give it only two stars?First, the movie says it is based on true events. I tried to do a little research afterwards and discovered that this claim is exaggerated to say the least. The execution scene that opens the film really did take place although the makers of this film seem to have portrayed it as a kind of accident rather than a calculated execution which has drawn some controversy. As far as I can tell almost everything else in the film is made up. Some of the incidents in the film really did happen to various soldiers in the war but in totally different contexts (the scene where they are hiding under floor-boards, the tin foil angel, etc.). This, in itself, is a minor flaw since a war movie does not necessarily have to be true to be good but it is misleading to say that this movie is based on true events.The characters in the movie, as almost every negative review of the movie has pointed out, are cliche as can be. The British officer is the most cliched Englishman I have seen on film and the few attempts at using him as ""comic relief"" in the film fail miserably in my opinion. The southerner is, of course, dumb as a post. The sergeant is the same sergeant you have seen in every war movie you have ever seen. And then you have the virtuous religious guy and the bitter atheist.There is almost no tension in the movie. None of the soldiers seem to grasp the gravity of their situation. Not only are they trapped behind enemy lines with a very small chance of survival but they have privileged information that could potentially help the allies to win the entire war and yet they never seem overly worried about any of it and their lack of concern for their own fate translates into a lack of concern for their fate on the part of the audience. There is never any real sense that very much is at stake. You certainly would like everyone to come out alive if possible but when they do not the viewer does not feel overly upset about it. And in all the scenes with them walking through the woods you almost never get the sense that they are behind enemy lines or in extreme danger. It feels like they are just out for a stroll through the woods, maybe on a patrol mission or something like that, but not on a mission to save the entire allied war effort or even their own skins.The film deals with some themes that I think would be interesting if dealt with properly but I did not feel that this film did deal with them properly. First, the attempt to show the humanity of everyone involved in the war is a worthy theme. It has, of course, been done to death. There are very few war movies made these days that do not in some way attempt to portray the humanity on both sides of the battle lines so this movie cannot really claim to be doing anything new, nor does it deal with this theme particularly well. It deals with the theme very superficially and predictably. It sets up the conflict between a bitter soldier who thinks the Germans are all evil and a good religious character who is capable of seeing the humanity of the Germans and, predictably, the bitter soldier encounters a good German who helps them and he is converted from the error of his ways. This is the kind of predictability I was referring to earlier in my review and it is superficial. It does not explore in any depth what happens to a soldier when he is engaged in killing his fellow human beings on a regular basis, and when other human beings are trying to kill him on a regular basis. The notion that you can be engaged in a horrifying battle for survival for months and remain as calm and well-balanced as the characters in this film strikes a false note. The few attempts to show the emotional tolls of war do not strike home and feel contrived.It would also have been good to see the humanity AND the inhumanity of both sides but we do not really see any of that. There is no sense (as there is in the movie Platoon for example) that war is destroying anyone's soul in this film. The one attempt to deal with the inner, mental struggles of war is the deacon but there is no sense that war is destroying his humanity, in fact quite the opposite is true. He is tortured because he feels guilty about ACCIDENTALLY killing some women and children. I highlight accidentally not to undermine the seriousness of the event or to deny the inevitable mental torment and guilt that must attend such an event but simply to point out that his struggle is really based on him remaining a good guy. If he was not still basically a good guy there would be no struggle since he would not feel guilty about accidentally killing some innocent people (as Kierkegaard would say, anxiety about evil still falls basically within the good). I agree with Socrates that it is better to suffer evil than to commit evil and I think one of the major tragedies of war is that it forces good people to commit evil. In other words, war does not simply destroy people's bodies, it destroys their souls. The makers of this film, however, apparently did not want to deal with the complexities of that theme and went out of their way to make sure that the good soldier never commits any evil on purpose.If you really want to show the equality between the two sides you have to show the humanity and the inhumanity of both sides. The makers of this film shied away from the latter and they did not even follow through with their claim to portray the former. They attempt in some scenes to show the humanity of the Germans but when the Germans show up at the house of a French woman and her child where the Americans and the Brit are hiding out what is the first thing they do? They try to rape the woman! So despite the efforts to portray the humanity of both sides of the conflict the makers of the film immediately fall into the same good American/bad German dichotomy when it suits their purpose. The Germans really did commit atrocities during the war so if you want to make a movie about that, that is fine. But to adequately portray all of this requires a complexity and depth that this film lacks. You cannot simply shoot a few scenes with some ""good Germans"" and a few scenes with some ""bad Germans"" or simply switch back and forth between the two views whenever it suits the plot and imagine that you have adequately portrayed the complexities of war.And finally, the resolution of the whole conflict which is portrayed through the conflict between the medic and the deacon is utterly predictable. The medic finally meets a good German, realizes the error of his ways, and the movie ends with him taking care of a German POW. The fact that this conflict was so easily resolved is merely a sign of its superficiality. The notion that real hate can be overcome so easily is ridiculous. If that were true we could have just introduced Hitler to a nice, friendly Jew and he would have immediately shut down the concentration camps and ended the war. It would be great if that is how the world worked but it is not. Hitler did not hate the Jews simply because he had never met a friendly Jew before and the character in this movie did not hate the Germans simply because he had never met a friendly German before. Hate (and racial hate in particular) is much more irrational than that. Anyone who has ever looked honestly at themselves knows that it is not as easy to deal with hate as this film seems to think, particularly in war where hatred of one's enemy is almost a necessity. How exactly could you continue killing people everyday if you did not feel any hate for them? This is another one of the tragedies of war that it would be nice to see a move deal with honestly.Another theme of the movie is the debate between theism and atheism. This would be an interesting theme to deal with in the context of war. It would be interesting to take an honest look at that old cliche ""there are no atheists in a fox hole"". To deal honestly with this theme requires dealing with it in depth, facing square in the face the challenges to faith that the utter destructiveness of war presents. This movie has its solution already worked out, it is just a matter of getting the misguided atheist to see clearly. An honest look would require two things: 1) no easy resolution in favor of one side or the other (the atheist has very real arguments to make which cannot simply be brushed aside so easily), and 2) BOTH sides should be transformed by their experiences in the war. The notion that a religious person can enter war and remain unchanged by the experience, or not have his or her faith shaken in anyway, is another example of the way in which this film deals with its themes in a superficial way.Here is a good quote from one of my favorite religious writers, Simone Weil, that I think captures what I am trying to say perfectly, ""A man whose whole family had died under torture, and who had himself been tortured for a long time in a concentration camp. Or a sixteenth-century Indian, the sole survivor after the total extermination of his people. Such men if they had believed in the mercy of God would either believe in it no longer, or else they would conceive of it quite differently than before. I have not been through such things. I know, however, that they exist: so what is the difference? I must move toward an abiding conception of the divine mercy, a conception which does not change whatever event destiny may send upon me, and which can be communicated to no matter what human being"" (Gravity and Grace, 168). This would make a great theme for a war movie! The notion that we can respond to the concentration camp survivor whose entire family has perished in the camps, or the Native American who has seen his entire people and way of life wiped out, with platitudes (they have gone to a better place) is an offense. A war movie is the perfect place to explore these themes but this movie deals with them too cheaply because it believes it already has the answers. A question is not really a question if we already know the answer in advance.So those are my thoughts on the film. I gave the film two stars (rather than one) because, even though I felt the film did not deal with its themes adequately, at least its failures were enough to inspire in me the train of thought that turned into this review so it was not entirely without value.  Most films would probably not have inspired such a train of thought in me so it seemed fair to give the film an extra star for that. I apologize for the length of the review.

Another good WWII story about a group of soliders that survived the massacre at Malmedy in December of 1944. You may have heard about this as it is based on a true incident. Several prisoners were shot dead during a dispute, around fifty, because the Germans did not want to take the time and manpower to guard them. Here we see a handful that escaped during the confusion. They then meet up with a downed British pilot that has vital information for the Allied war effort. The group tries to get the Brit to HQ so he can deliver his report.Because they are deep behind enemy lines it is a difficult journey. During the journey, each soldier, divulges a secret that lets you know a little more about them. One in the group, nicknamed ""Deacon"", has a chance encounter with a German soldier that he knew at a Berlin missionary he was at before the war. Their religious bond leads to the soldier helping them to get through the German lines, but they still suffer a number of casualties getting to their lines. Great acting, directing, scenery, sets, and uniforms, make it well worth seeing. I love ""Band of Brothers"" so I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Regardless, this is a timely and absorbing WWII story. Yes, the character ""Deacon"" is presented as a former missionary (in Berlin), but this is not a ""preachy"" movie, unless you consider a stance of wanting peace ""preachy."" Nor is his denomination ever mentioned.It is amazing what the producers did on a miniscule budget, luckily they had hundreds of WWII re-enactors doing the combat scenes on their own dime. This ensured a lot of realism, perhaps not totally historically accurate, but still well-done.Some of the dialogue, as noted in other reviews, is a bit anachronistic, e.g., did they really use the term ""flipped out"" in the 1940s?

897049,AS56N6FYEQ12U,B00080ETYA,coinman,"[2, 3]","I have to admit, I had never heard of the events this movie is based on until I watched the movie. However, this made the movie even more interesting to me. After watching the commentary in the special features, I do not think this movie could have been made much better. To begin with, the movie recreates a true story, thus limiting the liberties the producers could take with the story. Then to make this movie on a small budget and still make it look as good as it did, I am impressed.This movie is not without its faults, however. There were such things as German soldiers walking only yards away the footprints of the American soldiers in the snow without seeing those footprints. Maybe something similar happened in the actual event, but the movie could have been a little more realistic and simply not have had the German soldiers walk so close to the Americans' hideout.Even so, I found the movie to be rather intriguing. The main character is quickly shown to be a Christian haunted by memories from. A good portion of the movie is a sort of gradual revealing of exactly what it is that haunts him. One thing that I found really meaningful was how the ending played out. As a Christian myself, I found it a little easier to understand the main character (yes, I have forgotten his name!) and I was able to see the ending in a different light than a non-Christian might. The best way to explain this without giving away too many details is by saying that it shows the literal explanation of the Bible verse that says, ""No greater love is this, that a man should lay down his life for his friend.""Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and for several reasons. First, it was about WW2 history, specifically some WW2 history that I was previously unaware of. Second, there was plenty of action and surprises, regardless of what other reviewers might say. Third, although it is never stated or really even implied, I personally think that this is a Christian movie. In showing true history, the producers also showed the good side of true Christianity.Once again, i really enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it. If you do see it, I would suggest you also watch the following commentary.

897050,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00080ETYA,Craig Matteson,"[8, 10]","If you want a family film that happens to be a war film, this is for you.  Though done on a very small budget compared to a Hollywood film, this is a story about guilt, brotherhood, and sacrifice and only incidentally happened during the Second World War.  It is a fictional story sparked by a real massacre of prisoners by the Nazis as the Allies were pushing them out of France, however the story told here about these characters is fiction.The story imagines these men among those prisoners, but one soldier panics and makes a run for it and an uproar ensues.  All the prisoners end up shot except for the few that got into the woods and managed to elude capture.  This story is about a few of those men who find each other and look for shelter.  They decide to hunker down until the allies move through their position in a few days rather than risk moving around being enemy lines.  However, they pick up a downed British pilot, named Oberon Winley, who has intelligence about some German troop movements that must get back to the Allies.Of course, this story is about them getting to know each other and growing bonds under tremendous pressure.  The central figure is a troubled soldier nicknamed Deacon because of his strict religious beliefs.  He and the leader of this group, named Gunderson, are Airborne Rangers and the most able soldiers in this group.  There is also a medic who is a very cynical man and a well meaning and large trooper named Kendrick who is desperate for smokes and knows one card trick.There are struggles and risks along the way.  At one point they capture a German soldier.  Miraculously, he and Deacon know each other from the time Deacon had spent as a missionary in Germany before the war.  That relationship has consequences for the all involved and is key to how the story comes out.Is this a great film?  No.  However, it is a much better film than most of what Hollywood cranks out through their sausage grinder style of movie making.  Are there some pretty obvious mistakes in the film?  Yes.  Some of it may be due to budget, such as the dead soldiers being dug up from the snow who are still red with life and limp as if freshly dead instead of the blue white hard as rock lumps of ice they would have actually been.  Some it if is not really understanding the situation of the soldiers.  For example, they get into a ruined house behind enemy lines and Gunderson, the leader, talks about building a fire!

Reminiscent of ""Joyeux Noel"" (see my review), ""Saints and Soldiers"" was brilliantly done. The World War II setting for this film (based on true events) involves a small band of American soldiers trapped behind enemy German lines following the Malmedy massacre during the Battle of the Bulge. The Americans join together with a British pilot who parachuted from his crashing plane to deliver vital enemy intelligence to the front lines over 20 miles away, and en route are aided by a German and a Belgian. What makes this piece different than most war films are the theological exchanges that occur between characters surrounded by death. One of several such exchanges initiated by Private Gould, an atheist medic, illustrates the contrast in theology with Corporal Greer, who had served as a missionary to the Germans in Berlin prior to the war:""So why do you like the Krauts so much?""""Because I know them. I know most of them are just like you and me. Just wearing a different uniform.""""So Adolph Hitler is a pretty nice fellow? Once you get to know them it's just a different uniform?""""That's not what I said.""""Those guys at Malmedy, they're just like us? They've just got different helmets on?""""If it makes it easier for you to hate them, then go right ahead.""""You know what? If it weren't for them, I would be finishing up med school and putting a cast on Billy's leg because he broke it on his bicycle, but instead, I'm taking lead out of his seventeen-year-old brother's gut because he wanted to serve his country and he lied about his age. And now he's spitting up blood, lying in the dirt, and asking God to come and save him. It's more than a different uniform.""Later, Corporal Greer saves Gertz, a German soldier who he recognized from his mission trip, from the other Americans. And Private Gould later changes heart on judging all Germans after Gertz saves him from a group of passing German soldiers. While watching this film, I was reminded of a recent article in ""The Wall Street Journal"" (""A Chaplain and an Atheist Go to War"", September 4, 2010) that profiled a Navy Chaplain and his atheist Religious Programs Specialist whose job is to protect the Chaplain. While the often quoted ""There are no atheists in foxholes"" is sited in the article, the movie appears to communicate that it was the anger of Private Gould that steered his long-running theological beliefs.

If that's really going to bother you, you might skip this.Here's what I think.CONTAINS SPOILER INFORMATIONThe story is moving, maybe more so if you are a returned Mormon Missionary. I am, so if that offends you, you can skip the rest of this, because you will probably also hate this film. When a young LDS man or woman serves his church away from home, that new place becomes a home for him or her as well. You never lose the love for your real home, but you never lose the love you have for the people you tried to serve. That is where the title of this film comes from. The pivotal character, ""Deacon"" who served his mission in Berlin, is a fighting GI in Germany. He never doubts where his loyalty lies and kills as many of the enemy as come into his sights. He has a trauma, and later his gun misfires. Later he comes to see the German in his sights was a friend of his from his mission service. Some other convoluted events make all this meaningful and vital.So, here's my take, If my country is ever at war (granted it would never happen) with England, where I served my mission, or Wales my families ancestral home, I certainly know where my allegiance lies. What it means to be ""American"" is to sever your cultural ties in favor of your ideals. If your ideals aren't ""American"" and you prfer another place, that is where you should be, it is the essence of who ""we"" are, is those who want a ""more perfect union... dedicated to the principle..."" I get that, and agree with it. But would it be a hard thing? Absolutely. It is also a unique attribute of America, that we are the sum of our parts, and the sum of our hearts.

What a great movie.  What a great WWII movie.The acting was superb.  The location, props, scenery, and special effects were all right on the mark.The God-fearing theme of one of the characters was beautiful.As I watched the movie, I got to know the characters, and that also made it really special.  I was really hoping these men would make it out alive.  This movie brought tears to my eyes several times.  It can really stir-up emotions if you identify with the characters.When I later found that it was a low budget movie, I was quite surprised.  It was not noticeable at all.Also, it is true that the movie's distributor (Excel Entertainment Group) is a Mormon company; you can Google that.  However, this is not a Mormon movie.The God-fearing man in the movie is not associated with a church denomination.  Yes, he said he went on a mission to Germany.  But I've been on missions to various countries too, and I am not Mormon.  He didn't swear, smoke, drink alcohol, drink coffee...but neither do I, and I am not Mormon.The man is seen reading a book several times in the movie, and there is no reason to believe that book is anything other than the Holy Bible (however, he never reads out loud from the book, nor is the book identified).I also watched the ""behind the scenes"" documentary, and there is no mention of a religious denomination.There is another ""Saints and Soldiers"" movie hitting the theaters in August 2012.  It's called ""Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed"".  I hope it is as good as the first one.I rented this movie, and then purchased it for my small WWII collection.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections",5,very well done,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,1842,"['went', 'movie', 'knowing', 'was', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'had', 'other', 'expectations.Wow', 'What', 'great', 'movie', 'What', 'great', 'WWII', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'location', 'props', 'scenery', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'all', 'right', 'mark.The', 'God-fearing', 'theme', 'one', 'characters', 'was', 'beautiful.As', 'watched', 'movie', 'got', 'know', 'characters', 'also', 'made', 'really', 'special', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'men', 'would', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'movie', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'several', 'times', 'can', 'really', 'stir-up', 'emotions', 'identify', 'characters.When', 'later', 'found', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'noticeable', 'all.Also', 'true', 'movie', 'distributor', 'Excel', 'Entertainment', 'Group', 'Mormon', 'company', 'can', 'Google', 'However', 'not', 'Mormon', 'movie.The', 'God-fearing', 'man', 'movie', 'not', 'associated', 'church', 'denomination', 'Yes', 'said', 'went', 'mission', 'Germany', ""'ve"", 'been', 'missions', 'various', 'countries', 'too', 'am', 'not', 'Mormon', 'did', ""n't"", 'swear', 'smoke', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'drink', 'coffee', 'do', 'am', 'not', 'Mormon.The', 'man', 'seen', 'reading', 'book', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'reason', 'believe', 'book', 'anything', 'other', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'however', 'never', 'out', 'loud', 'book', 'book', 'identified', '.I', 'also', 'watched', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'mention', 'religious', 'denomination.There', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'movie', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'August', '2012', 'called', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'Airborne', 'Creed', 'hope', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one.I', 'rented', 'movie', 'then', 'purchased', 'small', 'WWII', 'collection.Visit', 'Amazon', 'Collections', 'see', '4-star', '5-star', 'military/war', 'DVDs', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections']",N/A
897067,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00080ETYA,Grady Harp,"[10, 11]","So many films about war, and especially about WW II, focus on the 'good guys' (read Allied troops) versus 'bad guys' (read Germans) and the monumental confrontations that have gained heroic monikers like D-Day, Normandy, Battle of the Bulge, etc. The film crews spend millions to re-enact these epic battles.  At times the individuals within the massive units are brought into focus ('Saving Private Ryan', etc) but primarily they are frontal decoration for the Big Effects created to stun the audience.Then comes along a small scale independent film like SAINTS AND SOLDIERS and while the battles are there and realistically created, this time they are background settings for this intimate story of the survival of four men and how that survival and a concerted mission serve to allow each to become wholly vulnerable despite all the societal taboos for honest, fragile emotions in men at war.  The only other film of this scale and intent that comes to mind is the Peter Berg 1992 film A MIDNIGHT CLEAR.The story of SIANTS AND SOLDIERS revolves around true events - the massacre of US soldiers at Malmedy, Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge.  Four young soldiers escape the German horror: Deacon (Corbin Allred), a lad without vices who had been a pre-war missionary (? Mormon) in Berlin and speaks the language; Medic Steven Gould (Alexander Niver) who was forced to give up Medical School to go to war; Gordon Gunderson (Peter Holden) who has bonded with Deacon; Private Shirl Kendrick (Lawrence Bagby) who is a simple Mississippi boy who has never been kissed.  Joining them early on is the parachute entrapped Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley  (Kirby Heyborne) who has urgent intelligence gained from reconnaissance during a shot-down plane mission.  Together these men survive the cold of winter, lack of food and shelter and adequate arms, and set out on a mission to help Winley deliver his coded intelligence to the Allied troops, a fact that could save thousands of lives.Along the way we learn the various secrets about the individual men's lives back home and their psychological baggage that accompanies them in the snow forests of Belgium.  Each has a burden and each learns from the others, agonizing as some are lost, yet compelled to complete their task: Deacon copes with the fact that he mistakenly destroyed a mother and children in a raid, disillusioned Medic Gould has lost faith in a higher being because of the sights of the war and languishes over Deacon's humanity to even the Germans, Gunderson is obsessed with defending Deacon's near fall into shell shock, etc.  The now five men are propelled along the course of the war growing from each other's spirits.The photography for this low budget film is utterly magnificent and was shot by the director Ryan Little himself.  The story, based on fact, was altered and adapted for the screen by Geoffrey Panos and Matt Whitaker.  The actors are true to ensemble acting - all sensitive, each well performed.  And while it is difficult to isolate individuals, the work of Alexander Niver and Corbin Allred is extraordinary.  Crowning this deeply moving film is the powerful, sensitive, beautiful musical score by J Bateman and Bart Hendrickson.  This is one of those perfectly written, directed, acted, photographed, and scored little wonders that restore faith in the integrity of movies.  Highly Recommended for all audiences.

897068,A1Z4VB9DA01AXP,B00080ETYA,"Gregory Canellis ""Student of military history...","[41, 42]","""Saints and Soldiers"" could arguably be the best war film to emerge this year. Director Ryan Little packed a lot of punch into this low-budget war drama. It is not surprising that this film has won a slew of best picture awards at film festivals nationwide. Although supposedly based on actual events, Geoffrey Panos' screenplay stretches the historical truth somewhat. Nevertheless, ""Saints and Soldiers"" surely earned a place among the ranks of such films as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and ""Band of Brothers."" The film centers around the infamous Malmedy Massacre (Dec. 17, 1944) where eighty-six American prisoners-of-war were murdered by a German SS unit during the open phases of The Battle of the Bulge. Forty-three survived by faining death, or escaping into near-by woods. The film tells the story of five of those survivors hiding in the frozen snow covered Ardennes Forest evading the onrushing German spearheaded Panzer columns. When a downed British pilot is discovered with vital photo reconnaissance intelligence, the group agrees to help the Brit reach American lines. ""Deacon,"" (Corbin Allred), a shell-shocked, guilt ridden, devout Christian, and loner turned infantryman, plays the film's protagonist. Through flashback sequences, we learn ""Deacon"" had accidentally killed a Belgian family, while attempting to clear a house of the enemy. Walking a tightrope between chaos and insanity, ""Deacon"" surprisingly meets up with an old bible-study acquaintance he had known from Berlin before the war. Captured by the Brit, Deacon saves his old friend from the same fate his American comrades had suffered at Malmedy, and releases him while the others slept. Just yards from the safety of the American lines, the group must first run a gauntlet of heavily armed German troops in a climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Utilizing the same revolutionary hand-held cinematography as Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" Little adds realism to the film's scattered battle scenes. Attempting to hitch their wagon to the success of ""Brothers,"" however, the film places a few 101st Airborne men in the cast. This is historically inaccurate, as the unit did not even arrive in the ""Bulge"" until two days after the Malmedy Massacre. When it did arrive, the 101st was further north defending Bastogne. With so much attention to details, and the use of historically minded re-enactors, it is surprising this blooper was left in the film. Little redeems himself by reverting back to classic war films of the 1950s and 1960s, by focusing on the player's fears, hopes, dreams, and skeletons hidden in the deepest closets of our minds. Despite minor flaws, this film deserves a place in any war film afficionados' DVD collection.",4,Best War Film This Year!,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,2757,"['Saints', 'Soldiers', 'could', 'arguably', 'be', 'best', 'war', 'film', 'emerge', 'year', 'Director', 'Ryan', 'Little', 'packed', 'lot', 'punch', 'low-budget', 'war', 'drama', 'not', 'surprising', 'film', 'won', 'slew', 'best', 'picture', 'awards', 'film', 'festivals', 'nationwide', 'supposedly', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'Geoffrey', 'Panos', 'screenplay', 'historical', 'truth', 'somewhat', 'Nevertheless', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'surely', 'earned', 'place', 'ranks', 'such', 'films', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'film', 'centers', 'infamous', 'Malmedy', 'Massacre', 'Dec.', '17', '1944', 'where', 'eighty-six', 'American', 'prisoners-of-war', 'were', 'murdered', 'German', 'SS', 'unit', 'open', 'phases', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'Forty-three', 'survived', 'faining', 'death', 'escaping', 'near-by', 'woods', 'film', 'story', 'five', 'survivors', 'hiding', 'frozen', 'snow', 'covered', 'Ardennes', 'Forest', 'evading', 'onrushing', 'German', 'spearheaded', 'Panzer', 'columns', 'When', 'downed', 'British', 'pilot', 'discovered', 'vital', 'photo', 'reconnaissance', 'intelligence', 'group', 'help', 'Brit', 'reach', 'American', 'lines', 'Deacon', 'Corbin', 'Allred', 'shell-shocked', 'guilt', 'ridden', 'devout', 'Christian', 'loner', 'turned', 'infantryman', 'film', 'protagonist', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'learn', 'Deacon', 'had', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'Belgian', 'family', 'attempting', 'clear', 'house', 'enemy', 'Walking', 'tightrope', 'chaos', 'insanity', 'Deacon', 'surprisingly', 'up', 'old', 'bible-study', 'acquaintance', 'had', 'known', 'Berlin', 'war', 'Captured', 'Brit', 'Deacon', 'old', 'friend', 'same', 'fate', 'American', 'comrades', 'had', 'suffered', 'Malmedy', 'others', 'slept', 'Just', 'yards', 'safety', 'American', 'lines', 'group', 'must', 'first', 'run', 'gauntlet', 'heavily', 'armed', 'German', 'troops', 'climax', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'Utilizing', 'same', 'revolutionary', 'hand-held', 'cinematography', 'Spielberg', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Little', 'realism', 'film', 'scattered', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Attempting', 'hitch', 'wagon', 'success', 'Brothers', 'however', 'film', 'few', '101st', 'Airborne', 'men', 'cast', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'unit', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'arrive', 'Bulge', 'two', 'days', 'Malmedy', 'Massacre', 'When', 'did', 'arrive', '101st', 'was', 'further', 'north', 'defending', 'Bastogne', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'details', 'use', 'historically', 'minded', 're-enactors', 'surprising', 'blooper', 'was', 'left', 'film', 'Little', 'reverting', 'back', 'classic', 'war', 'films', '1950s', '1960s', 'focusing', 'player', 'fears', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'skeletons', 'hidden', 'deepest', 'closets', 'minds', 'minor', 'flaws', 'film', 'place', 'war', 'film', 'afficionados', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

In addition, many of the weapons, equipment, the german halftrack and the american P-51 that flies over in the end were donations.  I think that many, actors, reenactors, advisors, etc. felt that they were working on something beyond just your average movie, and their efforts help add even more impact to the film.The plot is simple and as stated in other reviews it centers on 4 American soldiers (survivers of the Malmady massacre) becoming stranded behind enemy lines and then crossing paths with a downed RAF Flight Seargant who has intelligence he must get to the Allies as soon as possible.  But this is not the real focus of the film.  Throughout the 90 minute film the viewer is invited to become ever more famiiar with these GI's and to sympathize with their plight (and the plight of all soldiers) and the moral/human dilemas that evolve out of this type of conflict.  The intimacy of this film is carried much further than Saving Private Ryan was able to portray and instead of stagnating and spiralling down into the mess that was the end of Saving Private Ryan this film only continues to build through its completion.  Ultimately, beneath the grit and loss, something else trancends from this film in the power of humanity illustrated with the final price paid by ""Deacon"" and Gould's salvation.Now, this is not a film without problems, but honestly, none is.  I found the attention to detail in this film surprising.  The military advisors did a superb job of making the film look and feel authentic (although everyone was too clean and pressed looking, but considering the majority of the costumes were most likely collectors peieces I can understand this).  I didn't find any glaring problems with the weapons or equipment, which is something you usually find a lot in the bid budget productions that share their props from movie to movie.  The music score was amazing, as was the sound effects, which is surprising for a film of this budget.  In addition, the camera work is superb save for a few moments when the lighting looked a bit askew.The actors were great - yes, some moments were too heavy on the ""cheesy"" dialogue and the dialogue itself was predictable, but given that this was filmed over a month I will forgive a few hiccups.  In addition, I didn't ever think that any actor had been cast incorrectly or that their role could have been done better by someone else - this is not something even big budget films can always boast.  The key player is Deacon who is acted superbly.  The writers chose to keep his exact denomination a secret which allows the viewer to substitute whatever denomination fits into their circumstances, something I really appreciated.  In addition, while Deacon's religious views are paramount they don't waver or create a struggle for him, instead they are his strength.  He is able to maintain his faith throughout while being a great soldier and he is a central force for the group because of it, even while suffering from his own demons for what he views as his mistake. Gould, who is Deacon's oppositte in some respects, is also acted superbly, and all the while you can see that there is more to his character than what he shows you initially, so his transformation in the latter stages of the movie is fluid and not as heavily out of place or dramatized as what we are used to seeing.  Kendrick and Gunderson are both strong characters and fill their respective niches.  Winley (the RAF Seargant) is a sore point for some, but I really liked what the actor portrayed (seeing as how he isn't even British) but I felt that the friendship between he and Kendrick wasn't given enough screen time in the end to have its full impact upon the story.  The German soldier ""Rudi"" was acted fairly, but not as strongly as the central five.Ultimately, the only thing about the film that ever truly bothered me was the lack of consitancy between scenes - as if firing upon a German patrol then hiding in the trees for a few minutes would cause the patrol to forget all about you, or when they are being chased by the Germans through a village and then suddenly they are no longer being chased even though it would be easy enough to follow their slow and bloody progress in the snow.  Again, given what the director had to overcome to put this film together in a month I will forgive this, because, ultimately, the film works and works well.I highly recommend this film.  It is not action heavy or immediatley entertaining, but a developing emotional story that rewards the faithful viewer with something that stays with you longer than just the usual two hour blockbuster.  The action isn't muted, so it isn't immediately recommended to the young or squeamish, but given what else is in the theaters anymore this movie is actually quite safe for a mature person.  I think everyone should see it once.",5,What Saving Private Ryan could have been...,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,5143,"['First', 'off', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'close', 'lasting', 'message',

Poss,"[9, 10]","Saints and Soldiers is an absorbing film, not only because its story and message are good, but because it was shot independently on a shoestring budget and still manages to look like the biggest commercial war films the studio system can offer.The images have the gritty, realistic feel of Saving Private Ryan and its close relative Band of Brothers--hand-held camerawork and desaturation give the film a documentary feel. I found myself really riveted throughout the film which, even though it is slow at times, held my attention with its tiny details and careful construction.There has been some talk about how thin the characterization is, or that the leads are based on classic WWII stereotypes. Though there is some truth to this, the filmmakers managed to take archetypical soldiers (the crass, cynical New Yorker; the hard-boiled sergeant; the soulful religious guy; the southerner) and make them real people for an hour and a half.Saints and Soldiers was greatly helped by German military reenactors and the advice and stories of American veterans. The DVD's special features, especially the director's commentary, give more detail on this.Overall, while Saints and Soldiers had a few flaws (one of the Germans speaks rather unsatisfactory German, I noticed), it more than made up for these by the strength of its story and message.

897081,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B00080ETYA,Kevin R. Austra,"[23, 34]","SAINTS AND SOLDIERS has a lot of things going for it.  It is not a bad story.  The action is nicely choreographed.  The often hand-held cinematography tips its hat to techniques from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BAND OF BROTHERS.  The uniforming and equipping of actors and extras is enough reason for a World War Two aficionado to acquire this DVD.  The primary shortcoming of this film is that it is an increasingly fictional story tied to the real-life infamous Malmedy Massacre at the Baugnez Crossroads, Belgium.My review, no doubt, goes against the grain of those who mistakenly dub this film a five-star success.  Sorry folks.  SAINTS AND SOLDIERS is another Battle of the Bulge movie gone awry.  It is little better than another Utah-filmed work: A MIDNIGHT CLEAR.  The unfortunate tradition is that movies filmed in Utah, and I include THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE on that list, have not done well in conveying World War Two stories.To its credit, I applaud the first few minutes of the film and its portrayal of the Malmedy Massacre.  The German Army re-enactors are appropriately attired and equipped as the late 1944 Waffen SS.  There are so many versions of what happened at the Baugnez Crossroads, to include accounts from surviving American and German participants, that no one will ever really know what happened.  SAINTS AND SOLDIERS does a credible job recreating one possible sequence of events that led to the shootings.  The film does a much better job than the horrible recreation in Ken Annakin's 1965 movie THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE.This is where the SAINTS AND SOLDIERS missed an opportunity.  The chain of events leading up to the surprise meeting of B Battery, 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion, assorted medics, ambulance drivers, engineers, and soldiers from other units is a great story in and of itself.  The chance meeting, capture, shooting, and survivor escapes, as well as the US Army's discovery of the deed, would have made for a better movie.  Sixty-seven US soldiers were gunned down on the pasture west of the crossroads.  Amazingly, many soldiers survived the massacre.  The best recounting of the Malmedy Massacre can be found in John M. Bauserman's book, THE MALMEDY MASSACRE (ISBN: 0-942597-77-X).For students of the Ardennes Campaign, the SAINTS AND SOLDIERS inaccuracies begin after the handful of soldiers escape from the site of the massacre.  Okay, call it nit-picking, but there was no significant snowfall until several days after the massacre.  Much like A MIDNIGHT CLEAR, this film would have you think that the entire battle was fought in a winter wonderland.Notice that some of the escaped soldiers are wearing the 101st Airborne Screaming Eagles patch and associated helmet markings. As an audience, we became familiar with these patches and helmets in BAND OF BROTHERS.  BAND OF BROTHERS did a fantastic job recreating the siege of Bastogne.  As for SAINTS AND SOLDIERS, sorry guys, the 101st was en route to Bastogne at the time and nowhere near Baugnez.Historically the area around the crossroads was occupied by the Germans, albeit sometimes sporadically, until January 1945.  However, American forces in Malmedy were only a few kilometers away. Many survivors made their way back to American lines within a few hours.  Indeed, a few US military personnel made their way to the edge of the wood line surrounding the massacre site the day following the shootings.  News of the massacre spread like wild fire throughout US Army headquarters by the evening of December 17.Unfortunately, SAINTS AND SOLDIERS depicts our ad hoc squad of survivors as traversing miles of dense snowy wilderness miles behind the German lines.  If so, the squad was traveling in the wrong direction.  The story would have been more believable if the squad were survivors from the surrounded regiments of the 106th Infantry Division in the Schnee Eifel.  There they would truly have been plunked in dissected terrain awash in Germans.The Malmedy area did (and still does) have wooded areas, but farmers have long since claimed pastures from the forests and roads, trails, and crossroad settlements were sprinkled throughout the area.  SAINTS AND SOLDIERS, again much like A MIDNIGHT CLEAR, assumes the entire region is nothing but a dense Scandanavian forest with little more than a few tattered shacks evidencing civilization.  Ever been to the cantons of Eupen et Malmedy?Additionally, I don't buy in to the squad's convenient discovery of an RAF reconnaissance pilot -- who often loses his English accent.  The television series COMBAT! did a better job arranging encounters with downed pilots than this film.Historical accuracy aside, there are some good moments in this film to include the squad's final dash from pursuing German soldiers.  The Battle of the Bulge traditionally has not been treated well in movies.  SAINTS AND SOLDIERS is another example.

The story premise starts out as interesting; some escaped European theatre US prisoners first try to hunker down in enemy occupied territory until the Allied forces can push forward to meet them.  But, they are soon confronted with a reason to make their way back to the allied lines on their own.So.  Good setup.  Good look and feel, with enough hardware around the sets to not look skimpy.  How about we get going on this big-time WWII adventure, right?  Well, not so fast.War movies are often an allegorical canvas for someone with an ideological axe to grind.  Not a bad thing, and who can fault anyone for putting their story on screen?  This movie is obviously a labor of love for those involved, but a potential viewer should be aware that this movie is pushing a message of its own.  It sets its sights on celebrating navel gazing piety as an acceptable excuse for illogical and irresponsible behavior on the battlefield, and as a force for religious proselytization.The ""hero"" is never given a specific faith, but it can be easily determined from the clues given in the movie, and its annoyingly transparent, telling, and kinda' creepy that no one just comes out and says it.  I was left fairly unmoved by the ending, the primary aim of which was to show one tan-skinned city-dwelling character seeming to think that getting him of the strong white rural ""hero's"" religion might be a good thing.  The numerous deaths for a piece of what had to be useless, outdated, overcome-by-events, information are treated as almost incidental to this impending religious conversion.Again it's a decent watchable movie, but a movie with a message, and a viewer deserves to know that going in.  If you can accept, ignore (or endorse) this blatant ulterior motive in the background, along with the forced twists of the plot that are needed to drive it, then this movie is a pleasant enough way to spend an hour or two.If nothing else, this movie has shown that good looking, technically impressive WWII movies can be made for a near-pittance.",2,With a grain of salt......,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,2164,"['good', 'movie', 'great', 'look', 'feel', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'copying', 'slightly', 'washed', 'out', 'color', 'pallet', 'story', 'premise', 'out', 'interesting', 'escaped', 'European', 'theatre', 'US', 'prisoners', 'first', 'try', 'hunker', 'down', 'enemy', 'occupied', 'territory', 'Allied', 'forces', 'can', 'push', 'forward', 'meet', 'are', 'soon', 'confronted', 'reason', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'allied', 'lines', 'own.So', 'Good', 'setup', 'Good', 'look', 'feel', 'enough', 'hardware', 'sets', 'not', 'look', 'skimpy', 'How', 'get', 'going', 'big-time', 'WWII', 'adventure', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'so', 'fast.War', 'movies', 'are', 'often', 'allegorical', 'canvas', 'someone', 'ideological', 'axe', 'grind', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'who', 'can', 'fault', 'anyone', 'putting', 'story', 'screen', 'movie', 'obviously', 'labor', 'love', 'involved', 'potential', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'movie', 'pushing', 'message', 'own', 'sights', 'celebrating', 'navel', 'gazing', 'piety', 'acceptable', 'excuse', 'illogical', 'irresponsible', 'behavior', 'battlefield', 'force', 'religious', 'proselytization.The', 'hero', 'never', 'given', 'specific', 'faith', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'determined', 'clues', 'given', 'movie', 'annoyingly', 'transparent', 'telling', 'kinda', 'creepy', 'one', 'just', 'out', 'was', 'left', 'fairly', 'unmoved', 'ending', 'primary', 'aim', 'was', 'show', 'one', 'tan-skinned', 'city-dwelling', 'character', 'seeming', 'think', 'getting', 'strong', 'white', 'rural', 'hero', 'religion', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'numerous', 'deaths', 'piece', 'what', 'had', 'be', 'useless', 'outdated', 'overcome-by-events', 'information', 'are', 'treated', 'almost', 'incidental', 'impending', 'religious', 'conversion.Again', 'decent', 'watchable', 'movie', 'movie', 'message', 'viewer', 'know', 'going', 'can', 'accept', 'ignore', 'endorse', 'blatant', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'background', 'forced', 'twists', 'plot', 'are', 'needed', 'drive', 'then', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'two.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'shown', 'good', 'looking', 'technically', 'impressive', 'WWII', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'near-pittance']",N/A

897085,A1I9B4PSCDDWOO,B00080ETYA,"lordhoot ""lordhoot""","[16, 20]","I found Saints and Soldiers to be a relatively interesting war film. Produced on a small budget, the film seem to be a throw back to the old war flicks of the late 1940s and 50s, little special effects and more on the story. Its a story of small group of Americans who survived the infamous Malmedy massacre, rescued a British pilot and trying to get him back alive since he got vital intelligence information. In some way, this plot kind of reminded me of the Saving Private Ryan type of story.The main character is a Mormon, a sharp-shooting soldier who is also suffering from post tramatic stress after he accidently wiped out a civilian family during combat. The movie doesn't stress the fact that he is Mormon but all the hints are there and any LDS folks would instantly recongized the basic characterization presented early in the movie. The story basically evolved around him as he tries to come to term with that act which haunts him daily. His companions proves to be stereotypical group as in all war films, including an atheist who would be affected by the Mormon character the most.Overall, the acting proves to be superb, the action scenes were well done and the direction proves to be pretty good. I do question the script though and that proves to be its weakest link in most parts. I found the part where our Mormon character meet up with his German buddy he met in Berlin during his mission prior to the war in the middle of the Ardennes to be one of the great moments in scriptwriting fantasy. I guess that German is a Mormon as well. In the unreal world it would be remotely possible that the movie is trying to say that American Mormon won't willingly shoot a German Mormon if he can help it. Part of the story lies in with the concept of forgiveness and Christian fellowship, a theme deeply followed by LDS.I also notice that quite few guys were wearing a 101st Airborne patch for their shoulder patch including our set of heroes. I thought the Malmedy Massacre victims were all members of the 285th Field Artillery Forward Observation Battalion, Battery B. I don't think 101st or any member of that divison was any where close to Malmedy on 17 December 1944.I would recommended this movie overall, based on its solid material although some parts just feels too preachy. Some of the previous reviewers called this a ""Christian movie"" but I think it more of a LDS movie without LDS theme.",4,Mormon war story,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,2409,"['found', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'be', 'relatively', 'interesting', 'war', 'film', 'Produced', 'small', 'budget', 'film', 'seem', 'be', 'throw', 'back', 'old', 'war', 'flicks', 'late', '1940s', '50s', 'little', 'special', 'effects', 'more', 'story', 'story', 'small', 'group', 'Americans', 'who', 'survived', 'infamous', 'Malmedy', 'massacre', 'rescued', 'British', 'pilot', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'alive', 'got', 'vital', 'intelligence', 'information', 'way', 'plot', 'kind', 'reminded', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'type', 'story.The', 'main', 'character', 'Mormon', 'sharp-shooting', 'soldier', 'who', 'also', 'suffering', 'post', 'tramatic', 'stress', 'accidently', 'wiped', 'out', 'civilian', 'family', 'combat', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stress', 'fact', 'Mormon', 'hints', 'are', 'there', 'LDS', 'folks', 'would', 'instantly', 'recongized', 'basic', 'characterization', 'presented', 'early', 'movie', 'story', 'basically', 'evolved', 'around', 'come', 'term', 'act', 'daily', 'companions', 'be', 'stereotypical', 'group', 'war', 'films', 'including', 'atheist', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'affected', 'Mormon', 'character', 'most.Overall', 'acting', 'proves', 'be', 'superb', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'direction', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', 'question', 'script', 'be', 'weakest', 'link', 'most', 'parts', 'found', 'part', 'where', 'Mormon', 'character', 'meet', 'up', 'German', 'buddy', 'met', 'Berlin', 'mission', 'prior', 'war', 'middle', 'Ardennes', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'moments', 'scriptwriting', 'fantasy', 'guess', 'German', 'Mormon', 'well', 'unreal', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'remotely', 'possible', 'movie', 'trying', 'say', 'American', 'Mormon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'willingly', 'shoot', 'German', 'Mormon', 'can', 'help', 'Part', 'story', 'concept', 'forgiveness', 'Christian', 'fellowship', 'theme', 'deeply', 'followed', 'LDS.I', 'also', 'notice', 'quite', 'few', 'guys', 'were', 'wearing', '101st', 'Airborne', 'patch', 'shoulder', 'patch', 'including', 'set', 'heroes', 'thought', 'Malmedy', 'Massacre', 'victims', 'were', 'members', '285th', 'Field', 'Artillery', 'Forward', 'Observation', 'Battalion', 'Battery', 'B.', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', '101st', 'member', 'divison', 'was', 'where', 'close', 'Malmedy', '17', 'December', '1944.I', 'would', 'recommended', 'movie', 'overall', 'based', 'solid', 'material', 'parts', 'just', 'feels', 'too', 'preachy', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'called', 'Christian', 'movie', 'think', 'more', 'LDS', 'movie', 'LDS', 'theme']",N/A

897087,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B00080ETYA,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[7, 8]","I don't mind telling you I really wanted to like this movie. As a guy who grew up watching WWII flicks and tended to enjoy even the bad ones, I have found the loss of interest in this subject by Hollywood to be somewhat depressing. So you can imagine my joy when I passed by this film in the local video store. This joy persisted for some minutes into the flick - it was obvious from the opening frame that the producers, despite their modest budget, had taken their jobs very seriously, and were trying to deliver a very authentic, very professional work. In a certain sense, they succeeded. From the purely technical angle, the angle of cinematography and editing and production value, SAINTS AND SOLDIERS is a solid achivement. It's only when you break that shell and look at the less tangible but no less important qualities of characters, storytelling and so on, that you begin to encounter problems.SAINTS opens strongly indeed, showing a large group of American prisoners being herded into a snowy field by victorious German soldiers, while some expository radio commentary tells the viewer that the Battle of the Bulge is in full swing, and America is losing. In a scene clearly inspired by the Malmedy Massacre, the Germans open fire on the unruly prisoners with machine guns, slaughtering all but two men, who manage to flee unarmed into the woods. These survivors, wandering about the snowy Ardennes, soon link up with several other homeless soldiers. While trying to find their own lines, the little group, now five or so strong, unintentionally learns the whole battle plan of the German Army, and has to reluctantly change their mission from simply avoiding Nazi capture to getting the vital information back into American hands, though it will mean crossing the German lines to do so.The plot of the film is supposedly based on a real-life incident, but it feels horribly cliched and uninspired, so much so that it entirely lacks dramatic tension.  Somehow the idea that this little group of soldiers is carrying the whole wieght of the battle on their shoulders never translates into any feelings of anxiety for the audience. What's more, nearly every character is a sterotype right out of Central Casting. You have a pacifist, an embittered Jewish fellow, a British pilot who says things like ""cheerio, lads!"", a dumb-as-nails Southerner, and a German prisoner who - gasp! - turns out to be just a regular guy, no different from his Allied counterparts. Not one of these characters is anything more than a walking, talking amalgom of 50s-era war movie cliches. And while the whole premise of the movie is that the soldiers are ordinary men put in an extraordinary circumstance, the concept goes to hell at the film's climax, when our ordinary men suddenly take on the fighting characteristics of  Audie Murphy and tackle about 100 German soldiers who, in the great tradition of Hollywood Nazis, cannot seem to shoot straight.SAINTS is not a terrible movie by any means. It is not even a bad one. It is merely disappointingly mediocre, a great deal of honest, sincere work sunk into a predictable and unimaginative story and flat characters. War movie buffs will probably enjoy it for the snappy, well-directed battle sequences and the loving attention to historical details, but anyone else is likely to wonder what all the fuss is about.",2,"Saints, Soldiers and Cliches",1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,3355,"['do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'telling', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'WWII', 'flicks', 'tended', 'enjoy', 'even', 'bad', 'ones', 'have', 'found', 'loss', 'interest', 'subject', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'can', 'imagine', 'joy', 'when', 'passed', 'film', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'joy', 'persisted', 'minutes', 'flick', 'was', 'obvious', 'opening', 'frame', 'producers', 'modest', 'budget', 'had', 'taken', 'jobs', 'very', 'seriously', 'were', 'trying', 'deliver', 'very', 'authentic', 'very', 'professional', 'work', 'certain', 'sense', 'succeeded', 'purely', 'technical', 'angle', 'angle', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'production', 'value', 'SAINTS', 'AND', 'SOLDIERS', 'solid', 'achivement', 'only', 'when', 'break', 'shell', 'look', 'less', 'tangible', 'less', 'important', 'qualities', 'characters', 'storytelling', 'so', 'begin', 'encounter', 'problems.SAINTS', 'strongly', 'indeed', 'showing', 'large', 'group', 'American', 'prisoners', 'being', 'herded', 'snowy', 'field', 'victorious', 'German', 'soldiers', 'expository', 'radio', 'commentary', 'viewer', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'full', 'swing', 'America', 'losing', 'scene', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'Malmedy', 'Massacre', 'Germans', 'open', 'fire', 'unruly', 'prisoners', 'machine', 'guns', 'slaughtering', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'manage', 'flee', 'unarmed', 'woods', 'survivors', 'wandering', 'snowy', 'Ardennes', 'soon', 'link', 'up', 'several', 'other', 'homeless', 'soldiers', 'trying', 'find', 'own', 'lines', 'little', 'group', 'now', 'five', 'so', 'strong', 'unintentionally', 'whole', 'battle', 'plan', 'German', 'Army', 'reluctantly', 'change', 'mission', 'simply', 'avoiding', 'Nazi', 'capture', 'getting', 'vital', 'information', 'back', 'American', 'hands', 'will', 'mean', 'crossing', 'German', 'lines', 'do', 'so.The', 'plot', 'film', 'supposedly', 'based', 'real-life', 'incident', 'horribly', 'cliched', 'uninspired', 'so', 'much', 'entirely', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Somehow', 'idea', 'little', 'group', 'soldiers', 'carrying', 'whole', 'wieght', 'battle', 'shoulders', 'never', 'feelings', 'anxiety', 'audience', 'What', 'more', 'nearly', 'character', 'sterotype', 'right', 'Central', 'Casting', 'have', 'pacifist', 'embittered', 'Jewish', 'fellow', 'British', 'pilot', 'who', 'things', 'cheerio', 'dumb-as-nails', 'Southerner', 'German', 'prisoner', 'who', 'gasp', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'regular', 'guy', 'different', 'Allied', 'counterparts', 'Not', 'one', 'characters', 'anything', 'more', 'walking', 'talking', 'amalgom', '50s-era', 'war', 'movie', 'cliches', 'whole', 'premise', 'movie', 'soldiers', 'are', 'ordinary', 'men', 'put', 'extraordinary', 'circumstance', 'concept', 'hell', 'film', 'climax', 'when', 'ordinary', 'men', 'suddenly', 'take', 'fighting', 'characteristics', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'tackle', '100', 'German', 'soldiers', 'who', 'great', 'tradition', 'Hollywood', 'Nazis', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'shoot', 'straight.SAINTS', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'means', 'not', 'even', 'bad', 'one', 'merely', 'disappointingly', 'mediocre', 'great', 'deal', 'honest', 'sincere', 'work', 'sunk', 'predictable', 'unimaginative', 'story', 'flat', 'characters', 'War', 'movie', 'buffs', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'snappy', 'well-directed', 'battle', 'sequences', 'loving', 'attention', 'historical', 'details', 'anyone', 'else', 'likely', 'wonder', 'what', 'fuss', 'about']",N/A

This is every bit as good as Saving Private Ryan or Windtalkers, only without all the gratuitous blood and guts typical of ""modern"" war epics.  Making this one better is that the incidents portrayed are a compilation of actual events which occurred during the Ardennes Offensive - it's a fictional tale, but it has four or five actual veterans' experiences rolled into the story.  The story is outstanding, the camera work and authenticity is OUTSTANDING, both the Germans and Americans are portrayed very fairly I thought (very rare indeed for a WWII movie) and you are left with feeling at the end that while war is indeed hell, all things happen for a reason, and there is good and bad in the hearts of all men, regardless of which side they fought on.  This is a very impressive movie and I sincerely hope this production company does more films on historical subjects.

SPOILERS FROM HERE ON...The story unfolds from the famous (or infamous) Massacre at Malmedy, in the Belgian Ardennes during the German flash counteroffensive in the winter of 1944.Four men, manage to survive the ordeal, keeping a low profile and trying to stay put, but not for long...While seeking the next refuge, the four stumble upon a downed British Reconnaissance Pilot, who soon joins them out of necessity.He carries important strategic information that has to reach the Allied HQ before the Germans manage to cross the Meuse River.Not a simple feat, since the German lines seem to spread all across where the five are trying to move.Now the mission has switched gears. It is not enough anymore to just survive. The five have now a true mission at their hands and realize the great responsibility they have been handed out for the future of the Allied advance in the West.Now, the five have once again, a mission to accomplish. A very dangerous one at that.SPOILERS END HERE.Knowing the background to which these, now five, ""brothers at arms"" are set, we also have their personal stories to deal with. The various encounters they have along their way and the different risks and threats always real and always ominously impending on their heads.All this put together in an 86min movie makes it a classic just like ""When Trumpets Fade"", ""A Christmas Clear"" or even ""Band of Brothers"".Consider only this though. This movie was made with a budget below the 1 million dollar bill.Amazing!Besides, what makes it all worthwhile watching is the accuracy in details that one only would expect from a major production, and even there, only seldom one gets.All this courtesy of passionate WWII reenactors, who contributed in droves from all over the United States with accurate vehicle replicas, accurate German and U.S. uniforms and firearms.No more M2A1 Half-Tracks standing in for SdKfz. 251s, but the real things in working order.The sound effects also, reproduced in DD 5.1 Surround Sound are as realistic as one can come. No more overdubbed sound effects but the natural actual firearm sounds as they were experienced by those who were there.The music is simplistic and kept at a respectful level, and yet impressive and emotionally charged where needed.The direction of the movie itself is flawless and at times seems to be documentaristic in style, as if we, the audience, were meant to be the ""sixth"" member of the group.There are a few violent scenes, but never overdrawn or gratuitous in scope. The violence surges out of the events, not just for the sake of showing it.And this alone is done in a very respectful way, with the viewer in mind, and as such, reminds us that those men we are watching are not just ""heroes"", they are above all normal, everyday guys, whose only true ambition is to make it to stay alive long enough, as to return safely home...I would recommend it to all, and to all ages, especially young ones. They would probably understand better what being involved in a war is truly all about. At least from a pure human point of view.The DVD is well presented and as said, comes with a slick Dolby Digital 5.1 Soundtrack, as well as having a sharp, striking ""cold"" picture to it, which actually enhances the feeling of the freezing conditions with which soldiers were faced during that campaign.If you already own, ""When Trumpets Fade"", ""A Midnight Clear"" and ""Band of Brothers"", this one is a worthy companion to them. But in value, I would dare say, it surpasses them by far.I hope that the cast and crew that made this movie, might decide to get together one day and show us other wonders of this kind.",5,"There are no ""We"" or ""Them"" in War, there are just men out there...",1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,3862,"['love', 'movie.Short', 'point', 'never', 'ever', 'how', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'regular', 'basis.A', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Film', 'newcomer', 'actors', 'grips', 'guts', 'movie', 'making', 'care', 'them.CAREFUL', 'SPOILERS', 'FROM', 'HERE', 'ON', 'story', 'unfolds', 'famous', 'infamous', 'Massacre', 'Malmedy', 'Belgian', 'Ardennes', 'German', 'flash', 'counteroffensive', 'winter', '1944.Four', 'men', 'manage', 'survive', 'ordeal', 'keeping', 'low', 'profile', 'trying', 'stay', 'put', 'not', 'long', 'seeking', 'next', 'refuge', 'four', 'stumble', 'downed', 'British', 'Reconnaissance', 'Pilot', 'who', 'soon', 'necessity.He', 'important', 'strategic', 'information', 'reach', 'Allied', 'HQ', 'Germans', 'manage', 'cross', 'Meuse', 'River.Not', 'simple', 'feat', 'German', 'lines', 'seem', 'spread', 'where', 'five', 'are', 'trying', 'move.Now', 'mission', 'switched', 'gears', 'not', 'enough', 'anymore', 'just', 'survive', 'five', 'have', 'now', 'true', 'mission', 'hands', 'realize', 'great', 'responsibility', 'have', 'been', 'handed', 'out', 'future', 'Allied', 'advance', 'West.Now', 'five', 'have', 'once', 'again', 'mission', 'accomplish', 'very', 'dangerous', 'one', 'that.SPOILERS', 'END', 'HERE.Knowing', 'background', 'now', 'five', 'brothers', 'arms', 'are', 'set', 'also', 'have', 'personal', 'stories', 'deal', 'various', 'encounters', 'have', 'along', 'way', 'different', 'risks', 'threats', 'always', 'real', 'always', 'ominously', 'impending', 'heads.All', 'put', 'together', '86min', 'movie', 'classic', 'just', 'When', 'Trumpets', 'Fade', 'Christmas', 'Clear', 'even', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'only', 'though', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'budget', '1', 'million', 'dollar', 'bill.Amazing', 'Besides', 'what', 'worthwhile', 'watching', 'accuracy', 'details', 'one', 'only', 'would', 'expect', 'major', 'production', 'even', 'there', 'only', 'seldom', 'one', 'gets.All', 'courtesy', 'passionate', 'WWII', 'reenactors', 'who', 'contributed', 'droves', 'United', 'States', 'accurate', 'vehicle', 'replicas', 'accurate', 'German', 'U.S.', 'uniforms', 'firearms.No', 'more', 'M2A1', 'Half-Tracks', 'standing', 'SdKfz', '251s', 'real', 'things', 'working', 'order.The', 'sound', 'effects', 'also', 'reproduced', 'DD', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'are', 'as', 'realistic', 'one', 'can', 'come', 'more', 'overdubbed', 'sound', 'effects', 'natural', 'actual', 'firearm', 'were', 'experienced', 'who', 'were', 'there.The', 'music', 'simplistic', 'kept', 'respectful', 'level', 'yet', 'impressive', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'where', 'needed.The', 'direction', 'movie', 'flawless', 'times', 'be', 'documentaristic', 'style', 'audience', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'sixth', 'member', 'group.There', 'are', 'few', 'violent', 'scenes', 'never', 'overdrawn', 'gratuitous', 'scope', 'violence', 'events', 'not', 'just', 'sake', 'showing', 'it.And', 'alone', 'done', 'very', 'respectful', 'way', 'viewer', 'mind', 'such', 'men', 'are', 'watching', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'heroes', 'are', 'normal', 'everyday', 'guys', 'only', 'true', 'ambition', 'make', 'stay', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'return', 'safely', 'home', 'would', 'recommend', 'ages', 'especially', 'young', 'ones', 'would', 'probably', 'understand', 'better', 'what', 'being', 'involved', 'war', 'truly', 'least', 'pure', 'human', 'point', 'view.The', 'DVD', 'well', 'presented', 'said', 'slick', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'sharp', 'striking', 'cold', 'picture', 'actually', 'feeling', 'freezing', 'conditions', 'soldiers', 'were', 'faced', 'campaign.If', 'already', 'own', 'When', 'Trumpets', 'Fade', 'Midnight', 'Clear', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'one', 'worthy', 'companion', 'value', 'would', 'dare', 'say', 'far.I', 'hope', 'cast', 'crew', 'made', 'movie', 'might', 'decide', 'get', 'together', 'one', 'day', 'show', 'other', 'wonders', 'kind']",N/A
897095,A2000DWMMYNIYB,B00080ETYA,Peter Lorenzi,"[15, 16]","This is an amazing film, especially when you appreciate the small budget. For about 1% of what ""Saving Private Ryan"" cost, we have a remarkable, widely admired, little-viewed, award-winning film that captures the gritty, grey-and-blue toned cinematography of ""Band of brothers"" and the problematic moral issues of ""Ryan"".Four soldiers escape the Malmedy tragedy. Here the producers use a version of the massacre that evolves around a scared prisoner running away, being shot by the Germans, leading to a struggle with the guards, and setting off confusion, panic, a stolen rifle, and, eventually, the massacre. But first there is a critical revelation, when the central figure reveals his German-speaking skills.The four soon find a downed British flier, possessing critical yet unnamed intelligence about the rapidly develping Battle of the Bulge. What started as four soldiers trying to survive turns into a sort of ""Saving British Flier,"" with all of the accompanying problems associated with protecting his coded message. The soldiers struggle through the snow, hide beneath the floor of a shattered building, save a French woman from rape, capture and release a German prisoner (see ""Private Ryan""), and all the time make their way back to their own lines.[SKIP this paragraph if you don't want plot climax details revealed.] ""Deacon"" (Corbin Allred) plays the sharpshooting, straight-laced, former missionary central figure of the film. His German both saves and jeopardizes the men. His last, heroic rush back to the lines, ending with a crucifixion-like death at the hands of a German sharpshooter, allows him a final moment of redemption for a tragic scene he created just one week earlier. The escaped German prisoner (again, the ""Ryan"" homage of sorts) this time saves American lives and is captured again. The cynical Brooklyn medic (see Ed Byrnes in ""Ryan"") ends the film with his own form of conversion, treating another captured German, only this one helped precipitate the Malmedy disaster.The film has a nice edge, a basically unknown cast (the five-person ensemble is across-the-board excellent, save the somewhat cheesy British accent needed by an American actor), and a budget of less than one million dollars. Yet all of the effects are there: the re-enactors, the equipment, the sound, the little details. Yes, the film is a bit derivative, but I found myself as moved at a soldier's death as I was at Tom Hanks' Captain Miller's death at the end of ""Ryan"".If you wanted another installment of ""Band of brothers,"" look no further. While these five banded by accident, over a matter of hours, and always on the run, they are no less of a brotherhood or deserving of our admiration. Watch this film.

897096,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,B00080ETYA,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[1, 1]","I was impressed at this little independant film.  Make under a budget of one million dollars, Saints and Soldiers, is quick, lean and mean, and manages to be very entertaining and quite gripping.  Saints and Soldiers isn't innovative or anything, but the filmmakers do a commendable job with a small budget, and it's interesting, well-crafted, and executed much better than other war films.Saints and Soldiers is essentially a character study between a band of soldiers after the infamous Malmedy Massacre.  A mormon soldier, a british trooper, a hardened New Yorker (who never comes across a cocky) who lost faith in god, and a amiable soldier from Lousiana all end up meeting and banding together.  Though there is tension within the group, they all end up realizing that the best thing to do is to trust one another, band, and leave past prejudices and mistakes behind.  It's a great character study that examines strengths, weaknesses, and internal motivations set against the backdrop of a hellish situation within the war.The story itself folds out very well, and really delves into why the people are this way, whether it's from background and the location that they are raised, or situations that have changed them into the people that they are.  The ending is very well written, as some people withing the group do die.  It's not one of those war films where everybody survives easily, a very trite kind of ending that a 12 year old would reject as forced.  It's not groundbreaking or worthy of a awards for best screenplay, but it's interseting and gripping.The somewhat small budget of this film doesn't hurt the film either.  Shot in the hills of Utah, the snowy atmosphere of the hills is fully intact, given it a ""you-are there"" kind of quality that works very well in this film.  You can see the freezing snow and what it is like to be stuck in a very cold forest, and it's barren and alienating, like it should be.  There's little fireworks here, but the visuals are still crisp and good looking.  A subtle soundtrack gives some of the more emotional parts more verve.There's little related to battle in this film.  However, when they are portrayed here, they are done rather tastefully with minimal blood and gore, very unlike tripe such as Rambo.  They even sound great for it's budget, although sometimes the bombs sound a little different.  Saints and Soldiers makes up for that with good direction.  The PG-13 rating actually helps this movie too, especially the scene that shows what he did when killing innocent victims.  They don't show it, and in my opinion makes it actually more effective.  Most directors would use cheap shock value, yet the director decides not to even show the deaths, just the reaction.It's not an idea-rich film like Flags of Our Fathers or The Thin Red Line, and it doesn't have combat scenes on par with Saving Private Ryan.  Check it out if you want a solid, good war film.  Much better than other war films of recent memory, aside from Eastwood's Iwo Jima trilogy and Inglourious Basterds.  If you have the chance to do so, see it, even if it isn't groundbreaking.",4,A Sleeper of a War Film.

Five men - four Americans and a Brit - are trapped behind enemy lines, desperately attempting to get a message to the Allied troops who are stationed miles away across a frozen wilderness.This is a small-scale war film in which character and theme are more important than battles scenes and big-picture strategy.  This is both the strength and the weakness of the film, for while the men talk about God and the Bible and the brotherhood of man, the script too often feels as if it is straining to make a philosophical or theological point and not allowing the men to truly develop as living, breathing human beings.  Instead, they come across too much like mouthpieces for their respective causes - the committed Christian vs. the cynical atheist, for instance.  Although well-intentioned, the movie could use a bit more sophistication in both its dialogue and its characterizations.  The revelations and lessons also feel a mite trite at times, as if we didn't already know that we are all just the same under the various and sundry uniforms, languages, accents etc.  Moreover, the actors, for the most part, seem to be reciting most of their lines by rote.Although, in many ways, I admire what the makers of ""Saints and Soldiers"" were trying to do - going beyond the surface concerns of the traditional war film to explore the psychology of the common soldier - frankly, the film simply doesn`t have the depth and intelligence it needs to bring it off.",2,"well intentioned, weakly executed",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,1601,"['**1/2Based', 'true', 'story', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'honorable', 'failure', 'low-keyed', 'understated', 'film', 'set', 'closing', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Five', 'men', 'four', 'Americans', 'Brit', 'are', 'trapped', 'enemy', 'lines', 'desperately', 'attempting', 'get', 'message', 'Allied', 'troops', 'who', 'are', 'stationed', 'miles', 'away', 'frozen', 'wilderness.This', 'small-scale', 'war', 'film', 'character', 'theme', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'battles', 'scenes', 'big-picture', 'strategy', 'strength', 'weakness', 'film', 'men', 'talk', 'God', 'Bible', 'brotherhood', 'man', 'script', 'too', 'often', 'straining', 'make', 'philosophical', 'theological', 'point', 'not', 'allowing', 'men', 'truly', 'develop', 'living', 'breathing', 'human', 'beings', 'Instead', 'come', 'too', 'much', 'mouthpieces', 'respective', 'causes', 'committed', 'Christian', 'cynical', 'atheist', 'instance', 'well-intentioned', 'movie', 'could', 'use', 'bit', 'more', 'sophistication', 'dialogue', 'characterizations', 'revelations', 'lessons', 'also', 'feel', 'mite', 'trite', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'are', 'just', 'same', 'various', 'sundry', 'uniforms', 'languages', 'accents', 'etc', 'Moreover', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'seem', 'be', 'reciting', 'most', 'lines', 'rote.Although', 'many', 'ways', 'admire', 'what', 'makers', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'going', 'surface', 'concerns', 'traditional', 'war', 'film', 'explore', 'psychology', 'common', 'soldier', 'frankly', 'film', 'simply', 'doesn', 't', 'have', 'depth', 'intelligence', 'bring', 'off']",N/A

Together they must trudge six miles on foot through an unfriendly winter while facing the occasional music from enemy soldiers scattered in the wilderness.This sets us up for some fascinating combat action, war buffs should have enough to chew on.But a bulk of the film is devoted to the banter among the soldiers. A raft of light moments juices things up but there's plenty of introspective material, their rhubarbs are fun but thought provoking. It's a taut script that stays clear of we're-good-they're-evil posturings. Not everyone involved in war is sinister. There's even an enemy soldier who does a good turn because he and one of ours were friends pre-war.

While this film has many of the qualities of a classic war film, I doubt that it will ever be a blockbuster, mainly because it's too ""Christian.""While a bunch of American prisoners of war are gunned down by the Germans during an escape attempt, a few manage to get away. One of them has the nickname ""Deacon,"" because he doesn't swear or drink (including coffee) and he reads his Bible a lot.As this ragtag group attempts to sneak back to the front while behind enemy lines, you learn bits and pieces about the backgrounds of these GIs, and the one smug British pilot who parachuted to safety near where they were hiding. Although ""Deke"" is suffering from battle fatigue, as well as guilt for accidentally killing a family, he manages to share some of his story with the atheist medic.I don't want to give away any more of the story. The film deserves the PG-13 rating for the blood and war violence (in a previous decade it might've earned an R rating for these, but not these days).We learn that ""Deacon"" had been a missionary to Germany before the war, but we are never told specifically that he's a Christian, much less what denomination (or tradition). But as the story develops, there is no doubt that we're talking about Christian values of forgiveness.This is definitely a film for the guys, especially war buffs.

Is it because Hollywoood doesn't believe there are any, or just because they don't want to show them? Patton certainly was one, as were Audie Murphy and Sergeant York; and now the producers of Saints and Soldiers have given us another. But they've given us more than that: they've also given us a well-crafted, intelligent war movie that is gritty, personal and has a lot of heart.This film is remarkable on many levels. It was done by a relatively young independent with a lot of vision: director-cinematographer-producer Ryan Little (The Last Good War, Freedom on the Water). Only Band of Brothers compares in grit, realism, and the personal side of war. It is well written, well cast (an ensemble of relative unknowns), well acted, well directed (Little), well shot (Little, in Utah), well designed - even the art on the DVD cover is remarkable, which is what initially drew me to this film.The story is based on real WWII events that took place during the Battle of the Bulge. A group of American soldiers, who are being held prisoner by the German SS near the town of Malmedy in Belgium, are massacred by their captors (the Malmedy Massacre). But a handful of them manage to escape into the Ardennes forest, including a cynical medic named Gould, played by Alexander Niver; a soldier with strong Christian beliefs named Deacon, played by Corbin Allred; his sergeant Gunderson, played by Peter Holden (He plays his own grandfather.); and another soldier named Kendrick, played by Lawrence Bagby. Later they hook up with a downed British flyer named Winley, played by Kirby Heyborne, who is carrying a message to Allied forces that could save thousands of lives. But time is running out.Most of the conflict in the story occurs between the men needing to survive and the message needing to get to the Allies; and between the medic Gould with his cutting remarks and the Christian soldier Deacon, who is struggling with guilt over having killed a German family by accident. I really like the fact that the writers, Matt Whitaker and Geoffrey Panos, gave the only gun in the group to Deacon, who, although he's the best shot, is the least stable and most unpredictable. He becomes even more of a question mark when they capture a German soldier who turns out to be a friend of Deacon's from his pre-war missionary days in Germany. This creates a lot of dramatic tension and suspense.Whether Hollywood wants to admit it or not, most American soldiers who fought in WWI and WWII were probably Christians. I've still got both my grandfather's and my dad's Army issue Bibles, and they are both well read; and neither man was what you might call religious. Yet, being a soldier does something to you: it puts a good healthy respect for God, the brevity of life and the sting of death in you. I'm glad we finally have a film that depicts that. Saints and Soldiers is an excellent movie about war, priorities in conflict and sacrificial love.If you want an additional treat, check out the Saints and Soldiers website - it's wonderfully interactive.Waitsel Smith",5,"WELL-CRAFTED, INTELLIGENT WAR MOVIE WITH HEART",1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,3149,"['do', ""n't"", 'find', 'lot', 'war', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'feature', 'Bible', 'toting', 'soldier', 'hero', 'Hollywoood', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'show', 'Patton', 'certainly', 'was', 'one', 'were', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'now', 'producers', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'have', 'given', ""'ve"", 'given', 'more', ""'ve"", 'also', 'given', 'well-crafted', 'intelligent', 'war', 'movie', 'gritty', 'personal', 'lot', 'heart.This', 'film', 'remarkable', 'many', 'levels', 'was', 'done', 'relatively', 'young', 'independent', 'lot', 'vision', 'director-cinematographer-producer', 'Ryan', 'Little', 'Last', 'Good', 'War', 'Freedom', 'Water', 'Only', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'compares', 'grit', 'realism', 'personal', 'side', 'war', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'directed', 'Little', 'well', 'shot', 'Little', 'Utah', 'well', 'designed', 'even', 'art', 'DVD', 'cover', 'remarkable', 'what', 'initially', 'drew', 'film.The', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'WWII', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'A', 'group', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'prisoner', 'German', 'SS', 'town', 'Malmedy', 'Belgium', 'are', 'massacred', 'captors', 'Malmedy', 'Massacre', 'handful', 'manage', 'escape', 'Ardennes', 'forest', 'including', 'cynical', 'medic', 'named', 'Gould', 'played', 'Alexander', 'Niver', 'soldier', 'strong', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'named', 'Deacon', 'played', 'Corbin', 'Allred', 'sergeant', 'Gunderson', 'played', 'Peter', 'Holden', 'own', 'grandfather', 'soldier', 'named', 'Kendrick', 'played', 'Lawrence', 'Bagby', 'Later', 'hook', 'up', 'downed', 'British', 'flyer', 'named', 'Winley', 'played', 'Kirby', 'Heyborne', 'who', 'carrying', 'message', 'Allied', 'forces', 'could', 'save', 'thousands', 'lives', 'time', 'running', 'out.Most', 'conflict', 'story', 'men', 'needing', 'survive', 'message', 'needing', 'get', 'Allies', 'medic', 'Gould', 'cutting', 'remarks', 'Christian', 'soldier', 'Deacon', 'who', 'struggling', 'guilt', 'having', 'killed', 'German', 'family', 'accident', 'really', 'fact', 'writers', 'Matt', 'Whitaker', 'Geoffrey', 'Panos', 'gave', 'only', 'gun', 'group', 'Deacon', 'who', 'best', 'shot', 'least', 'stable', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'even', 'more', 'question', 'mark', 'when', 'capture', 'German', 'soldier', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'friend', 'Deacon', 'pre-war', 'missionary', 'days', 'Germany', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'suspense.Whether', 'Hollywood', 'admit', 'not', 'most', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'WWI', 'WWII', 'were', 'probably', 'Christians', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'grandfather', 'dad', 'Army', 'issue', 'Bibles', 'are', 'well', 'read', 'man', 'was', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'religious', 'being', 'soldier', 'something', 'good', 'healthy', 'respect', 'God', 'brevity', 'life', 'sting', 'death', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'have', 'film', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'excellent', 'movie', 'war', 'priorities', 'conflict', 'sacrificial', 'love.If', 'want', 'additional', 'treat', 'check', 'out', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'website', 'wonderfully', 'interactive.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
