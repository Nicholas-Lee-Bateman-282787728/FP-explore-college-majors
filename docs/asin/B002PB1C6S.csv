Frame ""music lover""","[6, 6]","If you were a fan of the TV Series Fame and are on the fence about purchasing this second season of Fame, get off the fence and just buy it. I have no complaints about this set. It has been restored beautifully and just as you'll remember it. I had actually forgotten how much depth was in some of the story lines. Yes, some of the music is very 80s but the shows as a whole have withstood the tests of time. Personally, I'll take the TV series Fame over the new Fame movie any time. That movie was a major disappointment. This walk down memory lane with the cast of Fame was a joy. It took way too long to get season 2 after season 1 was released. Let's hope the subsequent seasons are released much more quickly. This DVD set was so good that I watched them all in less than 2 weeks. It usually takes me much longer than that to complete a DVD set, but this time I just couldn't stop watching one episode after another.",5,Ready for Season 3,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,921,"['were', 'fan', 'TV', 'Series', 'Fame', 'are', 'fence', 'purchasing', 'second', 'season', 'Fame', 'get', 'off', 'fence', 'just', 'buy', 'have', 'complaints', 'set', 'been', 'restored', 'beautifully', 'just', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'had', 'actually', 'forgotten', 'how', 'much', 'depth', 'was', 'story', 'lines', 'Yes', 'music', 'very', '80s', 'shows', 'whole', 'have', 'withstood', 'tests', 'time', 'Personally', ""'ll"", 'take', 'TV', 'series', 'Fame', 'new', 'Fame', 'movie', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment', 'walk', 'memory', 'lane', 'cast', 'Fame', 'was', 'joy', 'took', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'season', '2', 'season', '1', 'was', 'released', 'Let', 'hope', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'are', 'released', 'much', 'more', 'quickly', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'watched', 'less', '2', 'weeks', 'usually', 'much', 'longer', 'complete', 'DVD', 'set', 'time', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'one', 'episode']",N/A

I'm sorry, but the original television series still knocks spots off the latest film version.  The first two seasons of Fame were definitely the best - series 1 was released a few years ago and MGM have ignored the series' legion of fans ever since.  The only good thing about the new movie is it has encouraged MGM to belatedly release season 2, which features some excellent episodes with some half decent songs.  My favourite is ""Your Own Song"" which features Jimmy Osmond as a singing student who comes from a school for kids who are disabled.  Jimmy's portrayal of a young man with a mental disability struggling to fit into a mainstream school (if the High School for the Performing Arts could ever be regarded as one!) is well observed, down to his body language, tics and mannerisms.  It is a heart-warming experience, and the episode is boosted by his brilliant singing voice belting out the classic Beatles song ""Penny Lane"".  To me, this dvd set is worth the money even for this brilliant episode alone.Amongst the collection is also the ""Not in Kansas Anymore"" where Doris gets knocked on the head, and whilst unconscious dreams that she meets the Wizard of Oz and all the other characters from the classical musical movie; of course, the main characters from the series take on the various film roles with Bruno as the Tin Man, Danny as the Scared Lion, Leroy as the Scarecrow, Miss Grant as the good fairy, Miss Sherwood as the Wicked Witch from the West, and Mr Shorofksi as the wizard himself.  Another gem of an episode.Overall, this is a welcome addition to the collection for ""Fame"" fans.  Series 3 is awaited with baited breath, but knowing MGMs dismal track record so far, we'll probably have to wait until some film director decides to remake ""Fame"" in 2035 before we ever get to see any more, and us 40 somethings will be on our death-beds by then. (Message to MGM execs - you are a disgrace for sitting on many of your classic tv series and not releasing them onto dvd now whilst you have the chance and people still alive who want to buy them. Instead, you seem to prefer to churn out the more more recent film rubbish you've made. Shame!).",5,About time this was released!!!!,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,2302,"['late', '30/early', 'mid', '40', 'somethings', 'who', 'watched', 'original', 'Fame', 'television', 'early', '1980s', 'real', 'treat', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'original', 'television', 'series', 'still', 'spots', 'latest', 'film', 'version', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Fame', 'were', 'definitely', 'best', 'series', '1', 'was', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'MGM', 'have', 'ignored', 'series', 'legion', 'fans', 'ever', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'new', 'movie', 'encouraged', 'MGM', 'belatedly', 'release', 'season', '2', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'half', 'decent', 'songs', 'favourite', 'Own', 'Song', 'Jimmy', 'Osmond', 'singing', 'student', 'who', 'school', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'disabled', 'Jimmy', 'portrayal', 'young', 'man', 'mental', 'disability', 'struggling', 'fit', 'mainstream', 'school', 'High', 'School', 'Performing', 'Arts', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'well', 'observed', 'down', 'body', 'language', 'tics', 'mannerisms', 'heart-warming', 'experience', 'episode', 'boosted', 'brilliant', 'singing', 'voice', 'belting', 'out', 'classic', 'Beatles', 'song', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'dvd', 'set', 'money', 'even', 'brilliant', 'episode', 'collection', 'also', 'Not', 'Kansas', 'Anymore', 'where', 'Doris', 'knocked', 'head', 'whilst', 'unconscious', 'dreams', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'other', 'characters', 'classical', 'musical', 'movie', 'course', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'take', 'various', 'film', 'roles', 'Bruno', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Danny', 'Scared', 'Lion', 'Leroy', 'Scarecrow', 'Miss', 'Grant', 'good', 'fairy', 'Miss', 'Sherwood', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'Mr', 'Shorofksi', 'wizard', 'gem', 'episode.Overall', 'welcome', 'addition', 'collection', 'Fame', 'fans', 'Series', '3', 'awaited', 'baited', 'breath', 'knowing', 'MGMs', 'dismal', 'track', 'record', 'so', 'far', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'wait', 'film', 'director', 'remake', 'Fame', '2035', 'ever', 'get', 'see', 'more', '40', 'somethings', 'will', 'be', 'death-beds', 'then', 'Message', 'MGM', 'execs', 'are', 'disgrace', 'sitting', 'many', 'classic', 'tv', 'series', 'not', 'releasing', 'dvd', 'now', 'whilst', 'have', 'chance', 'people', 'still', 'alive', 'who', 'want', 'buy', 'Instead', 'seem', 'prefer', 'churn', 'out', 'more', 'more', 'recent', 'film', 'rubbish', ""'ve"", 'made', 'Shame']",N/A
