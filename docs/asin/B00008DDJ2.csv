My curiosity was piqued when I learned the female guest seated next to me was a criminal defense attorney. Reluctant to bring her ""day job"" to the evening, she eventually said the most important thing I should know about the So Calif criminal justice system was that the police - in a complicity with prosecutors - regularly fabricated or altered evidence, and lied on the witness stand in order to get a conviction. Comfortable in my own white middle class bubble, I resisted what she was saying and wanted to believe she was ""a liberal soft on crime."" Nevertheless I pondered her remarks for years.I wish that evening could have culminated in the viewing of ""Murder on A Sunday Morning,"" though it was released 10 years after our dinner gathering. While not a stylishly elegant film, it succeeds in its straightforward narrative of a bespectacled black middle-class 15 year-old youth arrested and charged (and imprisoned for 5 months)  with a horrific assault/murder of a white female tourist in Florida, a murder that he could not have committed.The engine that drives the story is the dogged and intelligent work of white defense atty McGinniss and his stocky, no-nonsense 50-something female asst - who seems out of central casting as a social justice nun (she isn't). The telegenic McGinniss also seems lifted from the Law and Order series, but he is no media phenomenon - he's the real deal. Like my fellow dinner guest from years ago, McGinniss KNOWS from hard experience that the police he contends with in court fabricate confessions, ignore evidential possibilities and are occasionally prone to coercive violence against just-apprehended suspects, as well as outright lying. As the filmmakers suggest, it is the Florida legal system that encourages this misconduct and betrayal of justice, and McGinniss and company are often the last chance a defendant has - especially if he is a young black male.MOASM is at its best when McGinniss is challenging the 3 police officers on the stand. He makes them squirm, and occasionally draws an ""objection"" from the prosecutor, but few of them, however, are sustained. These exchanges are at the heart of the film and are not to be missed. In the end there are so many reasonable doubts in the jury's mind that it took them just 45 minutes to acquit the youth.There is a coda to this film that I will not reveal, and it registers with more than a few wallops. I give MOASM a solid recommendation, especially if you are not aware of the underside of our criminal justice system.",4,solid expose on railroading for judicial expediency,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,2624,"['1990', 'was', 'guest', 'dinner', 'party', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'home', 'Orange', 'County', 'CA', 'curiosity', 'was', 'piqued', 'when', 'learned', 'female', 'guest', 'seated', 'next', 'was', 'criminal', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Reluctant', 'bring', 'day', 'job', 'evening', 'eventually', 'said', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'So', 'Calif', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'was', 'police', 'complicity', 'prosecutors', 'regularly', 'fabricated', 'altered', 'evidence', 'lied', 'witness', 'stand', 'order', 'get', 'conviction', 'Comfortable', 'own', 'white', 'middle', 'class', 'bubble', 'resisted', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'wanted', 'believe', 'was', 'liberal', 'soft', 'crime', 'Nevertheless', 'pondered', 'remarks', 'years.I', 'wish', 'evening', 'could', 'have', 'culminated', 'viewing', 'Murder', 'Sunday', 'Morning', 'was', 'released', '10', 'years', 'dinner', 'gathering', 'not', 'stylishly', 'elegant', 'film', 'straightforward', 'narrative', 'bespectacled', 'black', 'middle-class', '15', 'year-old', 'youth', 'arrested', 'charged', 'imprisoned', '5', 'months', 'horrific', 'assault/murder', 'white', 'female', 'tourist', 'Florida', 'murder', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'committed.The', 'engine', 'story', 'dogged', 'intelligent', 'work', 'white', 'defense', 'atty', 'McGinniss', 'stocky', 'no-nonsense', '50-something', 'female', 'asst', 'who', 'central', 'casting', 'social', 'justice', 'nun', ""n't"", 'telegenic', 'McGinniss', 'also', 'lifted', 'Law', 'Order', 'series', 'media', 'phenomenon', 'real', 'deal', 'fellow', 'dinner', 'guest', 'years', 'ago', 'McGinniss', 'KNOWS', 'hard', 'experience', 'police', 'court', 'fabricate', 'confessions', 'ignore', 'evidential', 'possibilities', 'are', 'occasionally', 'prone', 'coercive', 'violence', 'just-apprehended', 'suspects', 'as', 'well', 'outright', 'lying', 'filmmakers', 'suggest', 'Florida', 'legal', 'system', 'misconduct', 'betrayal', 'justice', 'McGinniss', 'company', 'are', 'often', 'last', 'chance', 'defendant', 'especially', 'young', 'black', 'male.MOASM', 'best', 'when', 'McGinniss', 'challenging', '3', 'police', 'officers', 'stand', 'squirm', 'occasionally', 'draws', 'objection', 'prosecutor', 'few', 'however', 'are', 'sustained', 'exchanges', 'are', 'heart', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'end', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reasonable', 'doubts', 'jury', 'mind', 'took', 'just', '45', 'minutes', 'acquit', 'youth.There', 'coda', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'more', 'few', 'wallops', 'give', 'solid', 'recommendation', 'especially', 'are', 'not', 'aware', 'underside', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system']",N/A

738479,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B00008DDJ2,Buenoslibros.es,"[0, 14]","A very well directed docu-drama. It follows de case, in real time and in situ, of the 15 year old black young man who was accused of murdering a white woman in front of a motel on a Sunday morning. The special thing about this case is that the police seemed to pick the first young black male who happened to be walking about his business on the street at the time. The rest of the details you should see yourself. It's all as amazing as true. By the way, blaming it on white racism is the wrong conclusion if you were thinking of that. There's more, much more than that if you are willing to see it for yourself.This video is a good, though saddening picture of human nature.But I have to emphasize the watching of this video for another completely different reason which has not been pointed out in most of the reviews:To me this is a spiritual uplifting document, a blessing for believers in Christ and a call to the ranks of the real King for those who are still skeptical. Why? The family is a true and faithful Christian one. They congregate with their fellow Christians continuously to pray devotely to Christ for their son's freedom. The director does not make this the subject of the film but leaves it in the background respectfully. Before every important moment in the case we see, we ourselves emotionally, how they unite and put their faith in the true Savior. The camera, from a respectful distance, quiet and still watches the scene...And for the end I have to quote what Derek Prince said to a colleague-reviwer of this website when he was asked what was the most important thing he had learned about life. He said: ""God is faithful. He keeps His word. He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. I cannot emphasize this enough......""And this makes this documentary a wonderful witness of the living Jesus. The only God who died (for you) and resurrected and lives now, again, in the form of a Holy Spirit, in those who put their trust in Him. He is awesome and omnipotent.

It shows how a young 15 year old teenager is mistaken for a murderer, charged and tried with a possible life imprisonment without parole sentence. It's disturbing to see how easily some police (I know there are still some good ones out there, but let's face it, not all are there to protect and serve) can lie, even to the point where they essentially make up the story as they go along. The victim's husband in this case fingered Butler as the perpetrator, and when the pieces didn't fit for him to be the real killer, the police cut the pieces to force them to fit including beating a confession out of him and preying on his inexperience to interrogate him without a lawyer. It's very angering and eye opening. It is all real footage, no dramatizations. The defense attorney in this case is my new favorite hero.

The fresh and shocking impact of this film is that the contrast between good and evil is sharp and clear. So rarely do we see that contrast today that we feel revived from moral slumber, even if momentarily. That's the essence of great storytelling.Had this documentary told a tale which took place in 1965, I would have thought the film's straightfaced, understated delivery to be somewhat unengaging. However, the fact that the story takes place in 2000 and in our modern police system, it makes for a devastating revalation. The characters are archetypal, as emblemanic as the point being made. Racism, indolence and ineptitude rarely find a stage where they can be observed so pure. We also rarely get the opportunity to watch good people shake the system into behaving the way it should. This film should not be criticized for it's simplicity of point and of it's characters - if anything, we should be thankful that such characters exist and have endured this ordeal. It is a necessary and important distillation of where we still are as a nation - powerfully principled yet terribly flawed. The film is one-sided, as it should be (innocent until proven guilty), and it is deeply moving.To classify this film as a ""liberal's wet dream"" (as another reviewer has unfairly done) is to engage the cynicism which habitually complicates and frustrates communication of basic ideas; it smacks of neo-Hollywood.

It happens frequently that violent crimes take place in Jacksonville.  Most recently, Haitian immigrantand who was McDonald's Corporation employee was killed on the McDonald's parking lot in broad daylight when he was trying to protect his female manager from the armed robbery.  After all, people here are proud fo the fact that they are gun owners and can carry concealed weapons while walking about town.This documentary is about 15 year old black boy who is arrested swiftly after murder victim's husband identifies him as a murderer in the case.  What was compelling in the case documentary addresses is the determiantion of the public defender's office not only to prove that this young boy was innocent, but also to put an end to the police corruption in the Jacksonville's police department.  I loved profile of the public defender Partick McGuinness who is enigmatic, smart, determined and unwilling to negotiate with the state in their attempts to ""defend the honor"" of the lying police detectives rather than find a killer of the innocent female tourist murdered in front of her husband on the hotel grounds.  Mr. McGuinness is one of the attorneys who in spite of reaching middle age, still has srong desire to search for truth, fight racism  and confront corruption within police departments which is not a small thing.  I would give anything in the world to meet a person like himself.  People like him are rare.",5,Defense Attorney Patrick McGuinnes rules,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,1643,"['Not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'moved', 'big', 'city', 'Jacksonville', 'Florida', 'Being', 'north', 'part', 'country', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'learn', 'way', 'citizenry', 'still', 'so', 'widely', 'divided', 'amongst', 'racial', 'lines', 'frequently', 'violent', 'crimes', 'take', 'place', 'Jacksonville', 'Most', 'recently', 'Haitian', 'immigrantand', 'who', 'was', 'McDonald', 'Corporation', 'employee', 'was', 'killed', 'McDonald', 'parking', 'lot', 'broad', 'daylight', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'protect', 'female', 'manager', 'armed', 'robbery', 'people', 'here', 'are', 'proud', 'fact', 'are', 'gun', 'owners', 'can', 'carry', 'concealed', 'weapons', 'walking', 'town.This', 'documentary', '15', 'year', 'old', 'black', 'boy', 'who', 'arrested', 'swiftly', 'murder', 'victim', 'husband', 'murderer', 'case', 'What', 'was', 'compelling', 'case', 'documentary', 'addresses', 'determiantion', 'public', 'defender', 'office', 'not', 'only', 'prove', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'innocent', 'also', 'put', 'end', 'police', 'corruption', 'Jacksonville', 'police', 'department', 'loved', 'profile', 'public', 'defender', 'Partick', 'McGuinness', 'who', 'enigmatic', 'smart', 'determined', 'unwilling', 'negotiate', 'state', 'attempts', 'defend', 'honor', 'lying', 'police', 'detectives', 'rather', 'find', 'killer', 'innocent', 'female', 'tourist', 'murdered', 'front', 'husband', 'hotel', 'grounds', 'Mr.', 'McGuinness', 'one', 'attorneys', 'who', 'spite', 'reaching', 'middle', 'age', 'still', 'srong', 'desire', 'search', 'truth', 'fight', 'racism', 'confront', 'corruption', 'police', 'departments', 'not', 'small', 'thing', 'would', 'give', 'anything', 'world', 'meet', 'person', 'People', 'are', 'rare']",N/A

Garrard ""the G-man""","[5, 8]","Riveting and insightful, ""Murder on a Sunday Morning"", is a documentary that is an eye-opener for those unacquainted - or walking around wearing blinders - with the legal system in America.A young black man is ""identified"" as the perpetrator of the murder of a Florida tourist, arrested, and brought to trial.  The camera takes us through the boy's prison tenure, the heartwrenching agony of his parents, the untiring efforts of his defense team (headed by the crafty Patrick McGuinness), and the eventual court proceedings.One cannot look at the eyes of the accused, Brenton Butler, and not be moved to tears.  His expressions of disbelief at all that happens around him make for captivating viewing. His parents' undying support and inner strength, along with McGuinness's unending pursuit of justice, show that good will eventually win out.No Hollywood drama can capture the tension and pathos of this Academy Award-winning film.",5,"A Real-life ""Law & Order""",1054857600,"06 6, 2003",2003,932,"['Riveting', 'insightful', 'Murder', 'Sunday', 'Morning', 'documentary', 'eye-opener', 'unacquainted', 'walking', 'around', 'wearing', 'blinders', 'legal', 'system', 'America.A', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'identified', 'perpetrator', 'murder', 'Florida', 'tourist', 'arrested', 'brought', 'trial', 'camera', 'boy', 'prison', 'tenure', 'heartwrenching', 'agony', 'parents', 'untiring', 'efforts', 'defense', 'team', 'headed', 'crafty', 'Patrick', 'McGuinness', 'eventual', 'court', 'proceedings.One', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'eyes', 'accused', 'Brenton', 'Butler', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'tears', 'expressions', 'disbelief', 'make', 'captivating', 'viewing', 'parents', 'undying', 'support', 'inner', 'strength', 'McGuinness', 'unending', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'show', 'good', 'will', 'eventually', 'win', 'out.No', 'Hollywood', 'drama', 'can', 'capture', 'tension', 'pathos', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'film']",N/A

Even after the synopsis she gave me, I had no idea the movie was as compelling as it is.Poor young Brenton Butler, so young, so quiet, so scared, so violated. The basis of this documentary is Brent's arrest 2 hours after a murder occured in a nearby hotel, the murder of an older lady leaving breakfast with her husband. An African-American male came up to them, demanded her pocketbook and then shot her in the bridge of the nose, killing her instantly. The murder occured right around 7:00am and members of Brent's family all testified to Brent being home from 7:00am to 9:00am. He was on his way to Blockbuster to get a job application and never made it there. His arrest and subsequent trial shows much incompetence, carelessness, disreagard and shoddy work by both the police and detectives investigating this case.Brent's lawyer, Patrick McGuiness, comes out ready to fight. McGuiness's fervent interrogation of the detectives and police involved in this investigation and cover-up unleashes lies and we also learn that Brent had been subject to physical abuse in order to get him to sign a confession against his will.Throughout the movie, Brent is just a little boy in a corner, not saying anything, no facial expressions, but a look of pure sadness - the boy wouldn't hurt a fly.I will not tell anymore of this documentary - you truly need to watch it for yourself. But the most heart-wrenching part of this is seeing his mother crying on the stand, testifying that Brent told her ""I didn't do it,"" and watching a single tear fall down his face. I cried right along with him.",5,Make sure you have a box of tissue...,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,1689,"['girlfriend', 'watched', 'documentary', 'caught', 'early', 'one', 'morning', 'HBO', 'insisted', 'see', 'Even', 'synopsis', 'gave', 'had', 'idea', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'compelling', 'young', 'Brenton', 'Butler', 'so', 'young', 'quiet', 'so', 'scared', 'so', 'violated', 'basis', 'documentary', 'Brent', 'arrest', '2', 'hours', 'murder', 'occured', 'nearby', 'hotel', 'murder', 'older', 'lady', 'leaving', 'breakfast', 'husband', 'African-American', 'male', 'came', 'up', 'demanded', 'pocketbook', 'then', 'shot', 'bridge', 'nose', 'killing', 'instantly', 'murder', 'occured', 'right', '7:00am', 'members', 'Brent', 'family', 'all', 'testified', 'Brent', 'being', 'home', '7:00am', '9:00am', 'was', 'way', 'Blockbuster', 'get', 'job', 'application', 'never', 'made', 'there', 'arrest', 'subsequent', 'trial', 'shows', 'much', 'incompetence', 'carelessness', 'disreagard', 'shoddy', 'work', 'police', 'investigating', 'case.Brent', 'lawyer', 'Patrick', 'McGuiness', 'out', 'ready', 'fight', 'McGuiness', 'fervent', 'interrogation', 'detectives', 'police', 'involved', 'investigation', 'cover-up', 'unleashes', 'lies', 'also', 'learn', 'Brent', 'had', 'been', 'subject', 'physical', 'abuse', 'order', 'get', 'sign', 'confession', 'will.Throughout', 'movie', 'Brent', 'just', 'little', 'boy', 'corner', 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'facial', 'expressions', 'look', 'pure', 'sadness', 'boy', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'fly.I', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'anymore', 'documentary', 'truly', 'need', 'watch', 'most', 'heart-wrenching', 'part', 'seeing', 'mother', 'crying', 'stand', 'testifying', 'Brent', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'watching', 'single', 'tear', 'fall', 'down', 'face', 'cried', 'right', 'along']",N/A

From almost the very first time you see him on camera in this film, I feel in my gut that he is innocent and incapable of the crime he stands accused. And you can't help to think that those who prosecute him KNOW IT ALSO but brush that aside to further their own causes and that is, in reality, the biggest crime of all.
