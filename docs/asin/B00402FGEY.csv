All three are worth owning and, as individual releases seem to appear and disappear with some frequency, this is an easy, economical way to have them.  Note that Amazon's specs are incorrect, however, in that this set actually features two discs, one containing 'Pocketful of Miracles' and a flipper with the other two films.",4,Correct package info,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,560,"['holiday', 'collection', 'two', 'bona', 'fide', 'classics', ""'March"", 'Wooden', 'Soldiers', ""'The"", 'Bishop', 'Wife', '5', 'stars', 'curiosity', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'overblown', '1961', 'remake', 'own', '1933', 'classic', ""'Lady"", 'Day', '3', 'stars', 'three', 'are', 'worth', 'owning', 'individual', 'releases', 'seem', 'appear', 'disappear', 'frequency', 'easy', 'economical', 'way', 'have', 'Note', 'Amazon', 'specs', 'are', 'incorrect', 'however', 'set', 'actually', 'two', 'discs', 'one', 'containing', ""'Pocketful"", 'Miracles', 'flipper', 'other', 'two', 'films']",MGM Movie Collection: Three Holiday Family Movies Pocketful of Miracles / March of the Wooden Soldiers / The Bishop's Wife

Last count over the past two months was that she's watched The Bishop's Wife about 15 times. When she finds something she likes, she will wear it out. I also enjoyed watching the movie with her and thought that the picture quality was great quality on her HD TV. I am always glad when I can buy her something she will enjoy and this one was a plus. This is a great holiday collection and the quality appeared very good. You can't do better than Cary Grant as the angel in the Bishop's Wife, all performances in the movie are great.

Pocketfull of Miracles is a good movie probably made three times before, but I just can't remember what the names of this movie are.
