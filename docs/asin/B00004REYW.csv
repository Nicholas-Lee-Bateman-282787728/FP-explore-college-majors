548392,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,B00004REYW,Cowboy Buddha,"[19, 20]","A perfect example of how good British television used to be, but probably never will be again. A dream cast, witty yet believable dialogue, a clever concept and unobtrusive direction. If you've seen The Norman Conquests before - it's just as brilliant as you remember. If you're finding it for the first time, you're in for a treat.The premise is simple. Incurable romantic Norman has arrived to take his spinstery sister-in-law Annie away for a dirty weekend (to East Grinstead, where else?). Her mixed feelings about the prospective affair are complicated by the arrival of her brother Reg and his wife Sarah, not to mention the lurking on the fringes of a dim would-be suitor, a vet named Tom. All that's missing is Norman's wife Ruth, who duly arrives.The weekend is enacted in three plays, each taking place in a different part of the house - the dining room, the living room, and the garden. Each play could stand on its own but all three together give the complete picture. An exit from one play is often an entrance into another. For instance, during a conversation between Annie and Tom in one play, Reg suddenly enters, looks around, picks up a wastepaper basket and walks out again. But in another play, Reg's wife is dying to know what is going on between Annie and Tom so sends Reg to investigate. Reluctant and embarrassed, he goes only to return with the wastepaper basket and precious little information. It's a tribute to Alan Ayckbourn's writing that what could have been so complicated works as smoothly - and as entertainingly - as it does. I should mention that it is possible to watch the three plays in any order.But it's the performances that really make The Norman Conquests. Richard Briers and Penelope Keith as Reg and Sarah are fantastic as the sort of married couple we have all encountered and dread becoming. Penelope Wilton as Annie is touching and frail, but with the capacity to unleash fire and passion suddenly and unexpectedly. David Troughton is delightful as the slow-witted Tom, permanently confused but with his heart in the right place. Fiona Walker's Ruth is hard as nails, dripping with equal measures of sarcasm and exasperation. And holding it all together - or scattering sanity to the winds - is Tom Conti as Norman, a shuffling haystack of a creature, full of charm and poetic lust, as unreliable as he is irresistible.These plays have been off our screens for far too long. It's wonderful to have them again - grab them quick before somebody changes their mind and withdraws them (as they did here in the UK)!",5,We've waited too long for this one!,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,2559,"['perfect', 'example', 'how', 'good', 'British', 'television', 'used', 'be', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'again', 'dream', 'cast', 'witty', 'yet', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'concept', 'unobtrusive', 'direction', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Norman', 'Conquests', 'just', 'as', 'brilliant', 'remember', ""'re"", 'finding', 'first', 'time', ""'re"", 'treat.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'Incurable', 'romantic', 'Norman', 'arrived', 'take', 'spinstery', 'sister-in-law', 'Annie', 'away', 'dirty', 'weekend', 'East', 'Grinstead', 'where', 'else', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'prospective', 'affair', 'are', 'complicated', 'arrival', 'brother', 'Reg', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'not', 'mention', 'lurking', 'fringes', 'dim', 'would-be', 'suitor', 'vet', 'named', 'Tom', 'missing', 'Norman', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'who', 'duly', 'arrives.The', 'weekend', 'enacted', 'three', 'plays', 'taking', 'place', 'different', 'part', 'house', 'dining', 'room', 'living', 'room', 'garden', 'play', 'could', 'stand', 'own', 'three', 'together', 'give', 'complete', 'picture', 'exit', 'one', 'play', 'often', 'entrance', 'instance', 'conversation', 'Annie', 'Tom', 'one', 'play', 'Reg', 'suddenly', 'up', 'wastepaper', 'basket', 'walks', 'out', 'again', 'play', 'Reg', 'wife', 'dying', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'Annie', 'Tom', 'so', 'Reg', 'investigate', 'Reluctant', 'embarrassed', 'only', 'return', 'wastepaper', 'basket', 'precious', 'little', 'information', 'tribute', 'Alan', 'Ayckbourn', 'writing', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'complicated', 'works', 'smoothly', 'entertainingly', 'should', 'mention', 'possible', 'watch', 'three', 'plays', 'order.But', 'performances', 'really', 'make', 'Norman', 'Conquests', 'Richard', 'Briers', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'Reg', 'Sarah', 'are', 'fantastic', 'sort', 'married', 'couple', 'have', 'encountered', 'dread', 'becoming', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'Annie', 'touching', 'frail', 'capacity', 'unleash', 'fire', 'passion', 'suddenly', 'unexpectedly', 'David', 'Troughton', 'delightful', 'slow-witted', 'Tom', 'permanently', 'confused', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'Fiona', 'Walker', 'Ruth', 'hard', 'nails', 'dripping', 'equal', 'measures', 'sarcasm', 'exasperation', 'holding', 'together', 'scattering', 'sanity', 'winds', 'Tom', 'Conti', 'Norman', 'shuffling', 'haystack', 'creature', 'full', 'charm', 'poetic', 'lust', 'as', 'unreliable', 'irresistible.These', 'plays', 'have', 'been', 'off', 'screens', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'wonderful', 'have', 'again', 'grab', 'quick', 'somebody', 'changes', 'mind', 'withdraws', 'did', 'here', 'UK']",The Norman Conquests VHS
548393,A27M2GPN5VP7FP,B00004REYW,Dirk,"[31, 34]","I never thought to see ""The Norman Conquests"" released on DVD.  This is a series of 3 plays by Alan Ayckbourn, each play taking place in a different area of a house, but covering the same ground.  It takes place on a weekend in the country, with revelations about different people/couples.  Richard Briers and Penelope Keith (both of ""The Good Life"" fame) star in these small cast productions. Very much looking forward to the DVD release!From Alan Ayckbourn's official website:The reality of writing a trilogy was even more complex than it first appeared as paramount in Alan's mind was not only writing three plays which worked together, but that were - in essence - independent of each other and that could be seen in any order and not necessarily with either of the other two plays.The plays were written simultaneously over a week in May 1973 with Alan writing each play cross-wise (i.e. all the scenes ones after each other, than all of the scenes twos etc). Despite this method of working, Alan Ayckbourn firmly believes each play has its own very distinct character: Table Manners is the funniest; Round And Round The Garden the more casual and conventional; Living Together a slower piece with a deliberate slackening of the pace. As to why Norman appears so late in Table Manners (the first of the plays to be rehearsed), this is simply because the actor playing Norman, Christopher Godwin, was unavailable for the first week of rehearsals and the script was altered accordingly.",5,Wonderful!,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,1489,"['never', 'thought', 'see', 'Norman', 'Conquests', 'released', 'DVD', 'series', '3', 'plays', 'Alan', 'Ayckbourn', 'play', 'taking', 'place', 'different', 'area', 'house', 'covering', 'same', 'ground', 'place', 'weekend', 'country', 'revelations', 'different', 'people/couples', 'Richard', 'Briers', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'Good', 'Life', 'fame', 'star', 'small', 'cast', 'productions', 'Very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'release', 'Alan', 'Ayckbourn', 'official', 'website', 'reality', 'writing', 'trilogy', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'first', 'appeared', 'paramount', 'Alan', 'mind', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'writing', 'three', 'plays', 'worked', 'together', 'were', 'essence', 'independent', 'other', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'order', 'not', 'necessarily', 'other', 'two', 'plays.The', 'plays', 'were', 'written', 'simultaneously', 'week', 'May', '1973', 'Alan', 'writing', 'play', 'cross-wise', 'i.e', 'scenes', 'ones', 'other', 'scenes', 'etc', 'method', 'working', 'Alan', 'Ayckbourn', 'firmly', 'play', 'own', 'very', 'distinct', 'character', 'Table', 'Manners', 'funniest', 'Round', 'Round', 'Garden', 'more', 'casual', 'conventional', 'Living', 'Together', 'slower', 'piece', 'deliberate', 'slackening', 'pace', 'why', 'Norman', 'so', 'late', 'Table', 'Manners', 'first', 'plays', 'be', 'rehearsed', 'simply', 'actor', 'playing', 'Norman', 'Christopher', 'Godwin', 'was', 'unavailable', 'first', 'week', 'rehearsals', 'script', 'was', 'altered', 'accordingly']",The Norman Conquests VHS
548394,AV7ATN4TN8AQT,B00004REYW,"GeoX ""GeoX""","[14, 14]","And now, to counter rumors that I may possibly be an excessively negative person, here is a review of something that I liked very much.  Unlike seemingly everyone else here, I have no nostalgic attachment to these films, but I still think they're pretty great.  I got the set as a gift this past xmas, and I initially greeted it with baffled incomprehension: what the hell is this, and why would I be interested?  However, after my parents (god bless 'em) finally forced me to watch it earlier this Summer, all becomes clear: this is about as good as television gets.Indeed, seeing something this good really forces you to recognize that most movies (and TV shows) are, when you come right down to it, pretty damned bad.  TNC, on the other hand, is pretty damned good: the characters and their relationships are well and subtly-developed, and there are no facile, all-encompassing 'solutions' to the conflicts therein.  All six characters are real, wholly believable people, with no fatuous moralizing on the part of the writer, implicit or otherwise, to be seen.  They're occasionally screamingly funny, but never at the expense of character--everything flows naturally out of who they are.  At the end of the third film I felt a distinct sense of melancholy that I had to leave these people--and that's about the highest praise I can give.",5,A pleasant surprise indeed...,995760000,"07 22, 2001",2001,1341,"['now', 'counter', 'rumors', 'may', 'possibly', 'be', 'excessively', 'negative', 'person', 'here', 'review', 'something', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'seemingly', 'everyone', 'else', 'here', 'have', 'nostalgic', 'attachment', 'films', 'still', 'think', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'great', 'got', 'set', 'gift', 'past', 'xmas', 'initially', 'greeted', 'baffled', 'incomprehension', 'what', 'hell', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'However', 'parents', 'god', 'bless', 'finally', 'forced', 'watch', 'earlier', 'Summer', 'becomes', 'clear', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'television', 'gets.Indeed', 'seeing', 'something', 'good', 'really', 'forces', 'recognize', 'most', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'when', 'come', 'right', 'down', 'pretty', 'damned', 'bad', 'TNC', 'other', 'hand', 'pretty', 'damned', 'good', 'characters', 'relationships', 'are', 'well', 'subtly-developed', 'are', 'facile', 'all-encompassing', ""'solutions"", 'conflicts', 'therein', 'six', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'wholly', 'believable', 'people', 'fatuous', 'moralizing', 'part', 'writer', 'implicit', 'otherwise', 'be', 'seen', ""'re"", 'occasionally', 'screamingly', 'funny', 'never', 'expense', 'character', 'everything', 'naturally', 'who', 'are', 'end', 'third', 'film', 'felt', 'distinct', 'sense', 'melancholy', 'had', 'leave', 'people', 'highest', 'praise', 'can', 'give']",The Norman Conquests VHS

At this point I've stopped worrying about those who hate my opinions and not my writing, but this was a tedious and irritating waste of five hours. I only plowed through so I could write an honest review. But my life would have been better served had I quit after part I; heck, fifteen minutes in, when I was already hating it, would have been smarter yet.A play has to have a couple of things. Wit, interesting characters, a good plot, a theme worth chewing on would be some of the components I might be looking for. I found none of them here. Let's start with the theme...I would have to describe it as, ""If you flatter a woman enough, no matter how unpleasant you are, you can bed her if she's not too choosy."" If there is an alternate theme in this tale, I missed it. Lying, deceit, and insults were the tools Norman used to make his conquests. Whew....what a charmer! No romantic he; oh no, he is a skillful predator and calculating schemer. Would you even shake this guy's hand without feeling for your wallet afterwards?Wit? If you find teen age insults witty, then this is for you. Not a memorable or skillfully crafted line here; just tiresome haranguing and adolescent spewing. ""Me me me,"" they all say. ""Why won't you be nicer to me?"" That gets old in a hurry.Besides Norman the creep there are 4 other decidedly nasty people. (Thankfully, the most unpleasant of all remained offstage.) Short tempered, boorish, selfish, rude, argumentative, and fabulously boring, they imagine themselves special but are in fact utterly banal. Not one of them would make a good companion for a train trip. Marriage? Wow, flee! Flee!And then Tom, poor Tom the oaf, who is so dim he has no idea what is going on. (I guess vet school must not have been particularly demanding.) Repeatedly laughed at, manipulated, and belittled by his ""friends,"" he struggles to understand what these fools are doing, but because he cannot readily ascribe evil motives to people he likes, he is bamboozled and befuddled. Now, he was not a particularly appealing character either. No diamond in the rough there; just a lot of crumbled coal.The rest are foul. Keep `em. I hope to never meet such jerks in my life. Martyrs all, suffering under the weariness of their self-appointed burdens, incapable of a kind or decent word except when hoping to seduce or be seduced.
