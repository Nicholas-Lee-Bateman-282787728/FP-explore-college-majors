843850,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B0002RQ3MK,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]","Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fourth Season in my opinion is the last great season of this much criticized show. Joey and Pacey's passionate but troubled relationship is the main focus, the prom episode is my favorite of the season, when Pacey yells at Joey - just gets to me everytime. Dawson falls for Pacey's older sis which is hard to believe and the gang graduate from high school. This show really suffered in seasons 5 and 6, but at least seasons 1-4 were close to perfection, ahh the memories.",4,The last good season.,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,501,"['Dawson', 'Creek', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'opinion', 'last', 'great', 'season', 'much', 'criticized', 'show', 'Joey', 'Pacey', 'passionate', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'main', 'focus', 'prom', 'episode', 'favorite', 'season', 'when', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'just', 'everytime', 'Dawson', 'Pacey', 'older', 'sis', 'hard', 'believe', 'gang', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'show', 'really', 'suffered', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'least', 'seasons', '1-4', 'were', 'close', 'perfection', 'ahh', 'memories']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fourth Season
843851,A3BA78AFYTVEJ2,B0002RQ3MK,"A highschooler ""Al""","[5, 5]","Alright! Finally, my favorite season of DC to come out of DVD yet!  Dawson's Creek was staple viewing on wednesday nights for me during my ever changing teenage years- and when you are stuck in a high school that makes you think you live the same day over and over again...DC was a huge pick me up.  This show is one of kind... riding the wake of 90210 DC took every corny element of teenage drama and made an amazing television experience.  Season four is no exception.  For all the D/J fans out there, yes they were the star couple to begin with but things change... change is fresh...change is good.  Josh Jackson and Katie Holmes have electrifying chemistry!  Their presence on the TV is enough to make me drop whatever I am doing to watch... I drop homework mainly.  Season four tells the story of Pacey and Joey's relationship and is a must own for any DC fan.  All the sets are but this really sets up the series finale.  Thanks for reading my review and enjoy Dawson's Creek... it is a fun ride through the teenage years.",5,Joey plus Pacey equals a good good show,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,1029,"['Alright', 'Finally', 'favorite', 'season', 'DC', 'come', 'DVD', 'yet', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'was', 'staple', 'viewing', 'wednesday', 'nights', 'ever', 'changing', 'teenage', 'years-', 'when', 'are', 'stuck', 'high', 'school', 'think', 'live', 'same', 'day', 'over', 'again', 'DC', 'was', 'huge', 'pick', 'up', 'show', 'one', 'kind', 'riding', 'wake', '90210', 'DC', 'took', 'corny', 'element', 'teenage', 'drama', 'made', 'amazing', 'television', 'experience', 'Season', 'four', 'exception', 'D/J', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'yes', 'were', 'star', 'couple', 'begin', 'things', 'change', 'change', 'fresh', 'change', 'good', 'Josh', 'Jackson', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'have', 'electrifying', 'chemistry', 'presence', 'TV', 'enough', 'make', 'drop', 'am', 'doing', 'watch', 'drop', 'homework', 'mainly', 'Season', 'four', 'story', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'relationship', 'must', 'own', 'DC', 'fan', 'sets', 'are', 'really', 'up', 'series', 'finale', 'Thanks', 'reading', 'review', 'enjoy', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'fun', 'ride', 'teenage', 'years']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fourth Season

I love Pacey and Joey toghether, so that's one of the main reasons I loved the season.

My second favorite episode was ""Coda"". In ""Coda"" I wasn't thrilled of the Dawson-Joey relationship, but the ending was the best.

They were ok, to say the least. So I Stopped watching for nearly 2 months. I put the DVD in on disc 2 were I last finished the show, I really tried to get into it and I did! They just got better and better as the show went on, this season is  the season before the whole series takes a major change so all the characters have to finish off any anger they had with each other before they left, Pacey and Dawson are best friends again, but Pacey and Joey end their relationship with a simple ""Goodbye Pacey/Goodbye Joey"" end. that was a bit sad, Jack finally accepts who he is, and Jen gets back on track after discovering her pain that was her Father, when she goes back to New York to confront him. This season is sad in many ways, The lines are sad some episodes are really sad and yeah, Gretchen Paceys sister comes back to Capeside for the most of the season ut of course leaves near the end! I really liked her relationshi pwith Dawson, it was also another sad moment when she left the note for him, that she had left.

843860,A2JAKHFYI88ZX0,B0002RQ3MK,"Jake Z ""holden84""","[3, 3]","Season 4 of DAWSON'S CREEK begins with Pacey and Joey returning from their summer together on Pacey's boat. Last season they built up the relationship, and it finally happened. This of course left Dawson out, but not for long, as he started a relationship with Pacey's sister Gretchen who came to town with a secret (played by the wonderful Sasha Alexander). I think one of the more interesting characters this season was Jenn, who the viewers finally got to understand a little more as we learned about her past in New York and what happened to her. She entered therapy, and that was probably one of my favorite storylines this season. Jack still came to terms with being gay, and I think they did a great job with this storyline as well. One of the sadder things this season was that we lost Andie! Andie had always been one of my favorite characters. After she dabbled in ecstacy, she decided to move to Italy for a few months. Luckily she came back near the end of the season. Pacey was another character that was well written this season. I enjoyed the Pacey/Joey relationship, and Dawson/Gretchen was sweet too. Unfortunately this was one of the last good seasons of Dawson's Creek. In the next two, the characters hardly have any interaction with each other, as they move onto college.",4,Probably the last really good season of Dawson's Creek,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,1292,"['Season', '4', 'DAWSON', 'CREEK', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'returning', 'summer', 'together', 'Pacey', 'boat', 'Last', 'season', 'built', 'up', 'relationship', 'finally', 'happened', 'course', 'left', 'Dawson', 'out', 'not', 'long', 'started', 'relationship', 'Pacey', 'sister', 'Gretchen', 'who', 'came', 'town', 'secret', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'think', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'season', 'was', 'Jenn', 'who', 'viewers', 'finally', 'got', 'understand', 'little', 'more', 'learned', 'past', 'New', 'York', 'what', 'happened', 'entered', 'therapy', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'favorite', 'storylines', 'season', 'Jack', 'still', 'came', 'terms', 'being', 'gay', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'storyline', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'sadder', 'things', 'season', 'was', 'lost', 'Andie', 'Andie', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'dabbled', 'ecstacy', 'decided', 'move', 'Italy', 'few', 'months', 'Luckily', 'came', 'back', 'end', 'season', 'Pacey', 'was', 'character', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'season', 'enjoyed', 'Pacey/Joey', 'relationship', 'Dawson/Gretchen', 'was', 'sweet', 'too', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'good', 'seasons', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'next', 'two', 'characters', 'hardly', 'have', 'interaction', 'other', 'move', 'college']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fourth Season
843861,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0002RQ3MK,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[21, 23]","Dawson's Creek was not a show that I watched during it's regular network airing. Friends of mine recommended that I check it out, but it was never something that interested me. Then one evening while watching another show on The WB, I saw a commercial for the reairing of the very first episode of the show, prior to the final episodes as the series wound down. I watched the reairing of the Pilot and from that moment on was hooked on the lives of Dawson, Joey, Pacey and Jen.The fourth season of Dawson's Creek is mostly about the relationship between Pacey and Joey and the problems and issues it causes among their friends. While Dawson and Joey have long considered themselves soul mates, they spend much of this season questioning that as Joey explores her relationship with Dawson's former best friend Pacey.This season was also the final season for the group in Capeside, Mass. The kids graduate high school and move on to other things. In some cases, college is the answer, but not for all. The goodbyes to Capeside provided a solid emotional end to the season as the lifelong friends prepared for life beyond their sleepy Cape Cod town.Katie Holmes, as tomboy turned beauty Joey Potter is perhaps the star of this season. Her relationship with Pacey and her attempts at keeping her friendship with Dawson alive completely turn her in many different directions, often unsure of where she is going or why she is going where she's going.Joshua Jackson as Pacey gives a great performance, once again, giving good reason for the producers and writers to have him end up with Joey in the series finale. While their relationship ends before the end of the season, you always know how happy she makes him, yet he himself never really feels like he deserves someone liker her. In his mind, she is too good for him and that eventually breaks their relationship apart, in fine fashion at the prom I might add.Michelle Williams as Jen didn't have as big of a role in this season, simply because she wasn't in the love triangle that blossomed at the end of season three. She did, however, have some great moments of her own, most memorably her trip to New York to see her father. In that episode we find out so much about her character and what has happened to her in her life. It allows the viewers to appreciate just how lucky she is to have Grams. Speaking of Grams, Mary Beth Piel is phenomenal in the role, serving as a role model for Jen, guiding her along life's paths in the best way she possibly can.Kerr Smith is also solid as Jack, the gay football star, although in this season the football is downplayed thanks to an injury. Jack does get to explore his first real serious gay relationship, with Toby, and also spends a lot of time helping Jen through many of her issues.James Van Der Beek leads the cast as Dawson, a young man torn between his love for films and his love for Joey, the girl that got away. Everyone knows that he is bound to head to California to pursue his movie career, but at the same time, people are rooting for him to go to Boston to be with Joey. In this season, something important happens to Dawson though, as he falls in love with someone else, a huge step in getting over Joey. His relationship with Gretchen is a nice divergence, yet something viewers know will never work out.This show thrives on the ability to find different stories for each of the young stars. Sadly in this season we see the departure of Andie, played wonderfully by Meredith Monroe. Her character just wasn't left enough room to develop and midway through the season the decision was made for her to move to Italy. She reappears in the graduation episode and again in the series finale, but it is sad to see her go. She was a good part of the group.A new baby in the family changes Dawson's life, while college applications weigh heavily on everyone's mind. This is the beginning of the end of Dawson's Creek, as once the group left Capeside it became hard to follow them all in the different directions their lives were going. While the show lasted two more seasons, this was the last Capeside season of Dawson's Creek.The one drawback to this show, as was the case in the third season, is the replacement of the theme song. While the new song isn't necessarily bad, it isn't the song that belongs there and any fan knows that. Money issues rear their ugly head again.All in all though, this is a great set of a show that helped to define the genre of teen soaps for many years and is highly recommended, as are the first three seasons.",4,"Two guys, a girl, but no pizza place",1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,4549,"['Dawson', 'Creek', 'was', 'not', 'show', 'watched', 'regular', 'network', 'airing', 'Friends', 'mine', 'recommended', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'never', 'something', 'interested', 'Then', 'one', 'evening', 'watching', 'show', 'WB', 'saw', 'commercial', 'reairing', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'show', 'prior', 'final', 'episodes', 'series', 'wound', 'down', 'watched', 'reairing', 'Pilot', 'moment', 'was', 'hooked', 'lives', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'Pacey', 'Jen.The', 'fourth', 'season', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'mostly', 'relationship', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'problems', 'issues', 'friends', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'have', 'long', 'considered', 'soul', 'mates', 'spend', 'much', 'season', 'questioning', 'Joey', 'relationship', 'Dawson', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'Pacey.This', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'final', 'season', 'group', 'Capeside', 'Mass', 'kids', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'move', 'other', 'things', 'cases', 'college', 'answer', 'not', 'goodbyes', 'Capeside', 'provided', 'solid', 'emotional', 'end', 'season', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'prepared', 'life', 'sleepy', 'Cape', 'Cod', 'town.Katie', 'Holmes', 'tomboy', 'turned', 'beauty', 'Joey', 'Potter', 'perhaps', 'star', 'season', 'relationship', 'Pacey', 'attempts', 'keeping', 'friendship', 'Dawson', 'alive', 'completely', 'turn', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'often', 'unsure', 'where', 'going', 'why', 'going', 'where', 'going.Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Pacey', 'great', 'performance', 'once', 'again', 'giving', 'good', 'reason', 'producers', 'writers', 'have', 'end', 'up', 'Joey', 'series', 'finale', 'relationship', 'end', 'season', 'always', 'know', 'how', 'happy', 'yet', 'never', 'really', 'feels', 'someone', 'liker', 'mind', 'too', 'good', 'eventually', 'breaks', 'relationship', 'apart', 'fine', 'fashion', 'prom', 'might', 'add.Michelle', 'Williams', 'Jen', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'big', 'role', 'season', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'love', 'triangle', 'blossomed', 'end', 'season', 'three', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'great', 'moments', 'own', 'most', 'memorably', 'trip', 'New', 'York', 'see', 'father', 'episode', 'find', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'happened', 'life', 'viewers', 'appreciate', 'just', 'how', 'lucky', 'have', 'Grams', 'Speaking', 'Grams', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Piel', 'phenomenal', 'role', 'serving', 'role', 'model', 'Jen', 'guiding', 'along', 'life', 'paths', 'best', 'way', 'possibly', 'can.Kerr', 'Smith', 'also', 'solid', 'Jack', 'gay', 'football', 'star', 'season', 'football', 'downplayed', 'thanks', 'injury', 'Jack', 'get', 'explore', 'first', 'real', 'serious', 'gay', 'relationship', 'Toby', 'also', 'lot', 'time', 'helping', 'Jen', 'many', 'issues.James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'cast', 'Dawson', 'young', 'man', 'torn', 'love', 'films', 'love', 'Joey', 'girl', 'got', 'away', 'Everyone', 'bound', 'head', 'California', 'pursue', 'movie', 'career', 'same', 'time', 'people', 'are', 'rooting', 'go', 'Boston', 'be', 'Joey', 'season', 'something', 'important', 'Dawson', 'though', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'huge', 'step', 'getting', 'Joey', 'relationship', 'Gretchen', 'nice', 'divergence', 'yet', 'something', 'viewers', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'work', 'out.This', 'show', 'thrives', 'ability', 'find', 'different', 'stories', 'young', 'stars', 'Sadly', 'season', 'see', 'departure', 'Andie', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Meredith', 'Monroe', 'character', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'left', 'enough', 'room', 'develop', 'midway', 'season', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'move', 'Italy', 'graduation', 'episode', 'again', 'series', 'finale', 'sad', 'see', 'go', 'was', 'good', 'part', 'group.A', 'new', 'baby', 'family', 'Dawson', 'life', 'college', 'applications', 'weigh', 'heavily', 'everyone', 'mind', 'beginning', 'end', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'once', 'group', 'left', 'Capeside', 'became', 'hard', 'follow', 'different', 'directions', 'lives', 'were', 'going', 'show', 'lasted', 'two', 'more', 'seasons', 'was', 'last', 'Capeside', 'season', 'Dawson', 'Creek.The', 'one', 'drawback', 'show', 'was', 'case', 'third', 'season', 'replacement', 'theme', 'song', 'new', 'song', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', ""n't"", 'song', 'fan', 'Money', 'issues', 'rear', 'ugly', 'head', 'again.All', 'great', 'set', 'show', 'helped', 'define', 'genre', 'teen', 'soaps', 'many', 'years', 'highly', 'recommended', 'are', 'first', 'three', 'seasons']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fourth Season

843866,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B0002RQ3MK,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[2, 3]","Yes folks believe it or not, this installment of Dawson's Creek includes deleted scenes.  If your wondering where it's at the end of the trivia game.  The trivia game has seven sections that each have five questions.  If you get all the questions right it will show you a deleted scene from season four! Which is awsome.Now about the season, this is to me one of the two best seasons of this show, season two being the best.  In this season, the viewer gets the priviliage of watching pacey and joey fucntion as a couple and then crash and burn.  There's also come great story lines about Jenn's past, and a interesting relationship between Dawson and Pacey's sister Gretchen.Now the reason this DVD has four stars as opposed to five is the same thing everyone else has complained about, THE MUSIC.  I'm sorry but as disgusting as that Paula Cole song is, it is just essential when you put in a episode of Dawson's Creek.  Even Though Jann Arden is talented, ""Run Like Mad,"" is definatly not the high point in her career.  You just can't mess with the music when it comes to a show like Dawson's Creek is so important.  However, a positive music change was the addition of the Fisher song's.  Fisher is a very talented artist that had a moderate hit with, ""I will Love You,"" and the song just meshes perfect with the series.All in all a great season, just please people leave the music alone!",4,FINALLY SOME DELETED SCENES!!!!,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,1392,"['Yes', 'folks', 'believe', 'not', 'installment', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'wondering', 'where', 'end', 'trivia', 'game', 'trivia', 'game', 'seven', 'sections', 'have', 'five', 'questions', 'get', 'questions', 'right', 'will', 'show', 'deleted', 'scene', 'season', 'four', 'Which', 'awsome.Now', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'best', 'seasons', 'show', 'season', 'two', 'being', 'best', 'season', 'viewer', 'priviliage', 'watching', 'pacey', 'joey', 'fucntion', 'couple', 'then', 'crash', 'burn', 'also', 'come', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'Jenn', 'past', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'Dawson', 'Pacey', 'sister', 'Gretchen.Now', 'reason', 'DVD', 'four', 'stars', 'opposed', 'five', 'same', 'thing', 'everyone', 'else', 'complained', 'MUSIC', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'as', 'disgusting', 'Paula', 'Cole', 'song', 'just', 'essential', 'when', 'put', 'episode', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Even', 'Jann', 'Arden', 'talented', 'Run', 'Mad', 'definatly', 'not', 'high', 'point', 'career', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mess', 'music', 'when', 'show', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'so', 'important', 'However', 'positive', 'music', 'change', 'was', 'addition', 'Fisher', 'song', 'Fisher', 'very', 'talented', 'artist', 'had', 'moderate', 'hit', 'will', 'Love', 'song', 'just', 'meshes', 'perfect', 'series.All', 'great', 'season', 'just', 'please', 'people', 'leave', 'music', 'alone']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fourth Season

843871,A1Y2EMQ9WJ7YZC,B0002RQ3MK,Obladidi,"[23, 24]","I think of season 4 as the one where Dawson's Creek began to transform itself into Joey's Creek.The very first scene already hints at this switch by showing Joey and Pacey returning from their boat trip after escaping a broken-hearted Dawson and inquiring friends. The trend of having Joey in the opening scenes of new seasons would continue for seasons 5 and 6. Season 6 even more blatantly so by having her do a voice-over. It was not a bad change, but I would have appreciated a memo.Most of this season focuses on how Dawson, Joey, and Pacey could ever go back to being friends. Dawson must somehow accept that both of his best friends are now an item. Dawson and Pacey are proud, they won't admit they're wrong, and Joey is caught between her boyfriend and her best friend. It's a great conflict that in real life could have destroyed a friendship for good. But there's a reason why the audience roots for Dawson and Pacey to be friends again and that's because we know they have shared too much and still care for each other. We know they are both good boys!Of course, Joey's relationship with Pacey is serious and commited. She helps him with school, with his family on his birthday, and even later, trying to get him into college. In return, Pacey also makes sure she studies, helps her babysit, makes sure she doesn't get too drunk at parties and, even though he has mixed feelings about it, he does want her to succeed by getting into a good college even if it means he'll have to stay behind. They make one of the best TV couples ever, and you get to wonder if Dawson would have been as good a boyfriend as Pacey was.But Dawson meanwhile has his own life to worry about, although his life is far less interesting. He falls for an older girl who happens to be Pacey's sister. It's a relationship that, in true Dawson-form, takes forever to develop with unfortunate results. He also gets stuck with Mr. Brooks, the mentor from hell. The old man is annoying but he helps Dawson go back to his dreams of being a filmmaker.Here's where you know Dawson's life is getting too serious for a kid. In the episode ""A Winter's Tale,"" (one of my personal fav) his entire class is living it up on their senior trip, not to mention Pacey and Joey, and he's stuck in Capeside in a hospital with a bedridden Mr. Brooks. It's like punishing Dawson for being too good. And the worst part is, the audience is far more interested in what's going on in Pacey's and Joey's lodge than seeing Dawson praying along Jen's grandma. Dawson is officially made boring.Jack and Jen provide with excellent side stories. Andie's early departure was not so welcomed, but at least she made a great after school special about drugs and rave parties before leaving.I'm being sarcastic but this was a really great, entertaining season. My only beef was the ""Promicide"" episode because it was atypical for Pacey to act so jealous and cause such a scene. If Joey can forgive that, then we can forgive him too. Overall it's the best season of Dawson's Creek.",5,"The ""switch"" season",1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,3027,"['think', 'season', '4', 'one', 'where', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'began', 'transform', 'Joey', 'Creek.The', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'already', 'switch', 'showing', 'Joey', 'Pacey', 'returning', 'boat', 'trip', 'escaping', 'broken-hearted', 'Dawson', 'inquiring', 'friends', 'trend', 'having', 'Joey', 'opening', 'scenes', 'new', 'seasons', 'would', 'continue', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'Season', '6', 'even', 'more', 'blatantly', 'so', 'having', 'do', 'voice-over', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'change', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'memo.Most', 'season', 'how', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'Pacey', 'could', 'ever', 'go', 'back', 'being', 'friends', 'Dawson', 'must', 'somehow', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'now', 'item', 'Dawson', 'Pacey', 'are', 'proud', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'Joey', 'caught', 'boyfriend', 'best', 'friend', 'great', 'conflict', 'real', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'destroyed', 'friendship', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'audience', 'roots', 'Dawson', 'Pacey', 'be', 'friends', 'again', 'know', 'have', 'shared', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'care', 'other', 'know', 'are', 'good', 'boys', 'course', 'Joey', 'relationship', 'Pacey', 'serious', 'commited', 'school', 'family', 'birthday', 'even', 'later', 'trying', 'get', 'college', 'return', 'Pacey', 'also', 'sure', 'studies', 'babysit', 'sure', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'drunk', 'parties', 'even', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'want', 'succeed', 'getting', 'good', 'college', 'even', ""'ll"", 'have', 'stay', 'behind', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'couples', 'ever', 'get', 'wonder', 'Dawson', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'boyfriend', 'Pacey', 'was.But', 'Dawson', 'meanwhile', 'own', 'life', 'worry', 'about', 'life', 'far', 'less', 'interesting', 'older', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'Pacey', 'sister', 'relationship', 'true', 'Dawson-form', 'forever', 'develop', 'unfortunate', 'results', 'also', 'stuck', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'mentor', 'hell', 'old', 'man', 'annoying', 'Dawson', 'go', 'back', 'dreams', 'being', 'filmmaker.Here', 'where', 'know', 'Dawson', 'life', 'getting', 'too', 'serious', 'kid', 'episode', 'A', 'Winter', 'Tale', 'one', 'personal', 'fav', 'entire', 'class', 'living', 'up', 'senior', 'trip', 'not', 'mention', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'stuck', 'Capeside', 'hospital', 'bedridden', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'punishing', 'Dawson', 'being', 'too', 'good', 'worst', 'part', 'audience', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'what', 'going', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'lodge', 'seeing', 'Dawson', 'praying', 'along', 'Jen', 'grandma', 'Dawson', 'officially', 'made', 'boring.Jack', 'Jen', 'provide', 'excellent', 'side', 'stories', 'Andie', 'early', 'departure', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'welcomed', 'least', 'made', 'great', 'school', 'special', 'drugs', 'rave', 'parties', 'leaving.I', ""'m"", 'being', 'sarcastic', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'entertaining', 'season', 'only', 'beef', 'was', 'Promicide', 'episode', 'was', 'atypical', 'Pacey', 'act', 'so', 'jealous', 'cause', 'such', 'scene', 'Joey', 'can', 'forgive', 'then', 'can', 'forgive', 'too', 'Overall', 'best', 'season', 'Dawson', 'Creek']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fourth Season

843873,A1CGF9EUDEUQJA,B0002RQ3MK,Rodrigo Medina,"[8, 10]","After watching ""Dawson's Creek"" for the second time (first, on TV), I came to the conclusion that the forth season is the best of the show. The plot is interesting and the conflicts between the main characters increase. The season starts with Joey and Pacey returning from their summer trip, when they spent a few weeks at the sea. Dawson is hurt, feels betrayed by his friends, and does not accept Joey and Pacey relationship. Joey struggles to conquer Dawson's friendship again, while her long time friend gets involved with an older girl, Gretchen, who is Pacey's sister. Jen tries to feel free from the ghosts of her New York's past, making an effort to forgive her parents. Jack starts dealing with his choices, getting involved with a guy he meets on a gay reunion.It's the senior year for the characters, who get ready to face new challenges, going to college. At the time the show was aired on TV, people were wondering how the characters would get along on the upcoming season, considering that each character was going to an university located in different cities of US. The answer for this can be found on fifth season, which will be released on DVD soon.Season four is very important to the show plot, because it explores the relationship between Joey and Pacey, which came to an unexpected ending, despite the fact that they still loved each other. Pacey could not deal with the fact that his girlfriend was brilliant, while he felt dumb, not belonging to her new college environment. Very touching and realistic!There are also other relevant changes on the show plot: Andie says goodbye to the gang, going to Italy and then to Harvard. Joey loses her virginity with Pacey, letting Dawson completed disappointed. At the end, there's the graduation episode, filled with tears, goodbyes and well written dialogues.According to many fans, after season four, ""Dawson's Creek"" started to decline, with uninteresting plots. I do not agree with this, but I must admit that seasons 5 and 6 were not as exciting as the previous ones, especially this fourth.Anyway, I can't wait to put my hands on season 5!",5,The best season of the show!,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,2110,"['watching', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'second', 'time', 'first', 'TV', 'came', 'conclusion', 'forth', 'season', 'best', 'show', 'plot', 'interesting', 'conflicts', 'main', 'characters', 'increase', 'season', 'Joey', 'Pacey', 'returning', 'summer', 'trip', 'when', 'spent', 'few', 'weeks', 'sea', 'Dawson', 'hurt', 'feels', 'betrayed', 'friends', 'not', 'accept', 'Joey', 'Pacey', 'relationship', 'Joey', 'conquer', 'Dawson', 'friendship', 'again', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'involved', 'older', 'girl', 'Gretchen', 'who', 'Pacey', 'sister', 'Jen', 'feel', 'free', 'ghosts', 'New', 'York', 'past', 'making', 'effort', 'forgive', 'parents', 'Jack', 'dealing', 'choices', 'getting', 'involved', 'guy', 'gay', 'reunion.It', 'senior', 'year', 'characters', 'who', 'get', 'ready', 'face', 'new', 'challenges', 'going', 'college', 'time', 'show', 'was', 'aired', 'TV', 'people', 'were', 'wondering', 'how', 'characters', 'would', 'get', 'along', 'upcoming', 'season', 'considering', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'university', 'located', 'different', 'cities', 'US', 'answer', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'fifth', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'soon.Season', 'four', 'very', 'important', 'show', 'plot', 'relationship', 'Joey', 'Pacey', 'came', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'fact', 'still', 'loved', 'other', 'Pacey', 'could', 'not', 'deal', 'fact', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'brilliant', 'felt', 'dumb', 'not', 'belonging', 'new', 'college', 'environment', 'Very', 'touching', 'realistic', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'relevant', 'changes', 'show', 'plot', 'Andie', 'goodbye', 'gang', 'going', 'Italy', 'then', 'Harvard', 'Joey', 'virginity', 'Pacey', 'letting', 'Dawson', 'completed', 'disappointed', 'end', 'graduation', 'episode', 'filled', 'tears', 'goodbyes', 'well', 'written', 'dialogues.According', 'many', 'fans', 'season', 'four', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'started', 'decline', 'uninteresting', 'plots', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'must', 'admit', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'previous', 'ones', 'especially', 'fourth.Anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'put', 'hands', 'season', '5']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fourth Season
