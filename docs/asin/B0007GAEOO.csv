Bluegrass always seemed a bit hokey.. . . until a Bud brought this dvd over and we watched it in its entirety.  Rhonda knocked me out!!!  I could not believe this kind of musicianship existed. Especially want to bring your attention to Josh Williams.  He is an amazing guy.  I would compare him to Les Paul, Chet Atkins, Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani, but what he does with a guitar defys description.Whatever your taste is in music; classical, rock, tribal, you should do yourself a favor and get this dvd.  It is a joy to experience.  If Rhonda and The Rage do a show within 500 miles of your home, don't miss it.I can't say enough about this band, but,,,,,  that's about it!",5,Whoa~!~!~!

Now that tells me (as a sound man) that they may have employed the old radio studio technique of using only one microphone with the players in a semi-circle around it. To make this work, balance is key and the players have to understand where they need to be in relation to the mic, how far back, who is to the side and who is in front, etc. Here, the banjo is just too loud.Otherwise, this is an amazing band and Rhonda Vincent is her father's daughter and a phenomenal talent in her own right.",3,Great performance... really!,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,552,"['However', 'one', 'catch', 'banjo', 'player', 'just', 'too', 'loud', 'Now', 'tells', 'sound', 'man', 'may', 'have', 'employed', 'old', 'radio', 'studio', 'technique', 'using', 'only', 'one', 'microphone', 'players', 'semi-circle', 'make', 'work', 'balance', 'key', 'players', 'have', 'understand', 'where', 'need', 'be', 'relation', 'mic', 'how', 'far', 'back', 'who', 'side', 'who', 'front', 'etc', 'Here', 'banjo', 'just', 'too', 'loud.Otherwise', 'amazing', 'band', 'Rhonda', 'Vincent', 'father', 'daughter', 'phenomenal', 'talent', 'own', 'right']",N/A

It was like she didn't exist.But I knew I had seen her on TV, and that I should be able to find at least one of her CDs, but alas, nothing was to be found.And then I stumbled into Amazon.  There, lo and behold, I found not only Rhonda Vincent CDs, but even, would you believe, a DVD?And so I ordered it.Well, her energy is captured right there for all to see and wonder at, right there on that DVD, and it nearly bowls you over at her talent and boundless enthusiasm, and the cheerfulness she projects in her music.You almost can't think of anybody that compares to her and her band.  She almost explodes, as do other bluegrass groups I remember, and I'm thinking probably of Ricky Skaggs, or such.Anyway, she is fantastic, and you will love her, if you like agitated bluegrass music, from truly talented performers.",5,Great To Find - Even Greater To Have,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,1039,"['Awhile', 'ago', 'BA', 'discovered', 'Amazon', 'looked', 'vain', 'anything', 'concerning', 'Rhonda', 'Vincent', 'CD', 'DVD', 'whatever.I', 'looked', 'other', 'on-line', 'venues', 'shall', 'remain', 'nameless', 'stuff', 'could', 'find', 'nothing', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist.But', 'knew', 'had', 'seen', 'TV', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'least', 'one', 'CDs', 'alas', 'nothing', 'was', 'be', 'found.And', 'then', 'stumbled', 'Amazon', 'lo', 'behold', 'found', 'not', 'only', 'Rhonda', 'Vincent', 'CDs', 'even', 'would', 'believe', 'DVD', 'so', 'ordered', 'it.Well', 'energy', 'captured', 'right', 'see', 'wonder', 'right', 'there', 'DVD', 'nearly', 'talent', 'boundless', 'enthusiasm', 'cheerfulness', 'projects', 'music.You', 'almost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'band', 'almost', 'explodes', 'do', 'other', 'bluegrass', 'groups', 'remember', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'probably', 'Ricky', 'Skaggs', 'such.Anyway', 'fantastic', 'will', 'love', 'like', 'agitated', 'bluegrass', 'music', 'truly', 'talented', 'performers']",N/A

Rhonda likes to say people into this music are not all a bunch of duh hillbillies, well then release a dvd of a full on live show then RhondaThe problem with this show in question, and it's a glaring one, is this show is filmed with the band stopping allot so they can be ""catered to""  by make up people.  As in this show was made just for the dvd.Whats the problem?  Having been to 100's of concerts over 20 years, and seeing Rhonda live in person, I knew something wasn't right while I first watched it.  there is no ""flow"" to this show, no ""vibe""  you can tell its all a ""put on"".  Its pretty obvious.  This is key ya know to a good show, keep the flow going, everyone ""gels"" better this way, in any band.  Look, halfway through this ""Ragin"", what a farce of a name, DVD I stopped it, went to extras, just to look around, and low and behold I was right, they show the band stopped, getting make up, chattering with the crowd.Please understand, if I complain about something, I mean it constructive.  I wish Rhonda the best, the live in person best show that I have seen from this woman, is the best leading a band, ""EVER"".  she is even better than the Ann and Nancy Wilson in the rock group Heart!  And I saw them in the 1980's even, Rhonda is still better than them even now, and we are about the same age.I know talent when I see it, and Rhonda is stunning.  No other lady, in the world, comes close to her.  please put out a ""real""  concert DVD Rhonda, not all of us are duh Hillbillies and cant figure out a phony show, people like, believe it or not, see a band in all its glory, red faced, sweating, full on ""real"" pedal to the metal going for it full show jamming to the max and thus, ""gelling"" together, like a real life show is.",2,"""put on"" show made for dvd only not  a live show",1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,1823,"['give', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'go', 'see', 'live', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'Rhonda', 'say', 'people', 'music', 'are', 'not', 'bunch', 'duh', 'hillbillies', 'well', 'then', 'release', 'dvd', 'full', 'live', 'show', 'then', 'RhondaThe', 'problem', 'show', 'question', 'glaring', 'one', 'show', 'filmed', 'band', 'stopping', 'allot', 'can', 'be', 'catered', 'make', 'up', 'people', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'dvd.Whats', 'problem', 'Having', 'been', '100', ""'s"", 'concerts', '20', 'years', 'seeing', 'Rhonda', 'live', 'person', 'knew', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'first', 'watched', 'flow', 'show', 'vibe', 'can', 'tell', 'put', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'key', 'ya', 'know', 'good', 'show', 'keep', 'flow', 'going', 'everyone', 'gels', 'better', 'way', 'band', 'Look', 'halfway', 'Ragin', 'what', 'farce', 'name', 'DVD', 'stopped', 'went', 'extras', 'just', 'look', 'around', 'low', 'behold', 'was', 'right', 'show', 'band', 'stopped', 'getting', 'make', 'up', 'chattering', 'crowd.Please', 'understand', 'complain', 'something', 'mean', 'constructive', 'wish', 'Rhonda', 'best', 'live', 'person', 'best', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'woman', 'best', 'leading', 'band', 'EVER', 'even', 'better', 'Ann', 'Nancy', 'Wilson', 'rock', 'group', 'Heart', 'saw', '1980', 'even', 'Rhonda', 'still', 'better', 'even', 'now', 'are', 'same', 'age.I', 'know', 'talent', 'when', 'see', 'Rhonda', 'stunning', 'other', 'lady', 'world', 'close', 'please', 'put', 'out', 'real', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Rhonda', 'not', 'are', 'duh', 'Hillbillies', 'cant', 'figure', 'out', 'phony', 'show', 'people', 'believe', 'not', 'see', 'band', 'glory', 'red', 'faced', 'sweating', 'full', 'real', 'pedal', 'metal', 'going', 'full', 'show', 'jamming', 'max', 'thus', 'gelling', 'together', 'real', 'life', 'show']",N/A

The small auditorium contributed an intimate feel, and no doubt helped the audience connect with the performers:  there was impressive verve and dynamics both in front of and on the stage.  Despite Ms. Vincent's current quest to become ""sexy"" (which is being criticized by some sources in country music), it is evident that she is a fine musician, both instrumentally and vocally (albeit she often does not actually chord her mandolin, resorting instead to ""chuckin'""). Most noteworthy, there seemed to be considerable emphasis on fiddlers, and each rose admirably to the occasion.  I had tears in my eyes (literally) when they were all playing ""The Orange Blossom Special.""  The ""outtakes"" were silly and detracted from the musical thrust. This product will likely lead many members of the ""country music family"" into embracing Ms. Vincent.
