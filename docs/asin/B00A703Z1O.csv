1606144,APRVKZZLIZUSJ,B00A703Z1O,"Handsome-Jeff Friedberg, an Author and Media-...","[1, 3]","I thought about dumping this film out at about 30 minutes into its tortuous viewing (viewing---like at a wake),  but decided to give it a chance.At 50 minutes I killed the sound and put on rock music so I'd have something to do while watching this thing. At 51 minutes I said, ""#$%^  it,"" and just quit.This story was really really weak, and carried out sooooo slowwwwwly that it became excrutiating. Further, the dissability incurred by one of the players was plain totally unecessary to the ""plot,"" and just maaaaade it gooooo evennnnn ssssssslowwwerrrrr. Something different would have worked better.Finally, just as a technical point here, which any director should know, you cannot silence a revolver, folks, especially with a one-inch long ""silencer."" And a suppressed firearm doesn't go ""phwupp!' It goes BANG! but not as loud. And the ""surveillance"" performed as part of the Interpol action was just silly in concept, the way the character explains it.I just couldn't watch this film. I try not to say anything harsh but this film has no redeeming qualities whatever. The heroine is boring, the killer is happy and relaxed as loon, and the good guy is a lying manipulative weak creep---as portrayed. Ok, I get it, they're supposed to be ""original"" and ""different"" that way. They are just nonsensical.I give this movie my semi-official, ""Eeeeeeeyewwww....""...and I LOVE Korean films, as you might see from my other 100 reviews....",2,"A really dumb, draggy, boring, ill-researched effort",1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,1437,"['thought', 'about', 'dumping', 'film', 'out', 'about', '30', 'minutes', 'tortuous', 'viewing', 'viewing', '-like', 'wake', 'decided', 'give', 'chance.At', '50', 'minutes', 'killed', 'sound', 'put', 'rock', 'music', ""'d"", 'have', 'something', 'do', 'watching', 'thing', '51', 'minutes', 'said', '%', '^', 'just', 'quit.This', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'weak', 'carried', 'out', 'sooooo', 'slowwwwwly', 'became', 'excrutiating', 'Further', 'dissability', 'incurred', 'one', 'players', 'was', 'plain', 'totally', 'unecessary', 'plot', 'just', 'maaaaade', 'gooooo', 'evennnnn', 'ssssssslowwwerrrrr', 'Something', 'different', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better.Finally', 'just', 'technical', 'point', 'here', 'director', 'should', 'know', 'can', 'not', 'silence', 'revolver', 'folks', 'especially', 'one-inch', 'long', 'silencer', 'suppressed', 'firearm', ""n't"", 'go', 'phwupp', 'BANG', 'not', 'loud', 'surveillance', 'performed', 'part', 'Interpol', 'action', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'concept', 'way', 'character', 'it.I', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'try', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'harsh', 'film', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'heroine', 'boring', 'killer', 'happy', 'relaxed', 'loon', 'good', 'guy', 'lying', 'manipulative', 'weak', 'creep', '-as', 'portrayed', 'Ok', 'get', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'original', 'different', 'way', 'are', 'just', 'nonsensical.I', 'give', 'movie', 'semi-official', 'Eeeeeeeyewwww', 'LOVE', 'Korean', 'films', 'might', 'see', 'other', '100', 'reviews']",Daisy
