6012,A1G0IHVBEN8ZTB,0767802551,Abdulla M. Al Qasim,"[1, 1]","A great gangster / mafia movie with a high profile cast of actors. Unlike the benchmark of all mafia movies, The Godfather, which looks at the struggle at the top of the family, this movie looks at the trials, struggles and frustrations at the bottom of the criminal organization, mainly Lefty (Al Pacino's character) as well as Johnny Depp's character who is an undercover FBI agent who infiltrates the mafia and begins to have conflicting feelings and loyalties.The thing that really captured me the first time I saw this movie was that it was a very well direct and solid production. However, the one thing that makes me keep watching it over and over again has to be Lefty's character and what he has to go through... he is probably one of the most hard working members of the crew but is the first one to be overlooked and his personal life is no picnic either... even though he is a criminal, you will find yourself sympathizing with him and his situation. Especially when he begins to complain about it and how he is the one who is always being swept to the side, especially in the scene where he tries to meet the boss of Miami... that, for me was a real heartbreaking scene. You can't help sympathizing with Lefty even more because this movie was based on a true story.I guess now Al Pacino has played mafia characters at the two extreme ends of the mafia hierarchy from family head to solider.Johnny Depp's character also gained my sympathy where it got to the point where he was struggling to balance his home and family with his own sympathy for Lefty and his duty towards his job.I guess what I like about this movie is that it looks at gangsters and mafiosos as people in the end and that they are not devoid of their feelings and hardships... it is as if the director is trying to portray gangsters as people who are just trying to make a living (in their own different way) and are no different from your average working Joe who has to put up with the usual office politics and has to play the corporate game to get a promotion or a raise and meets with great disappointment and frustration..Overall, a great movie with great suspense, however does require close attention to the dialogue and events of the movie to fully appreciate the plot.""you said it yourself, you don't get uped, you're always looking over your shoulder... get out of this life is all I'm saying!""

His Portrayal of Joe Pistone is amazing. Additionally, Al Pacino's portrayal of Lefty Two Guns, Donnie Brasco's Mentor, is ALSO amazing.This movie is especially good because it's a mob movie done from the other side of the spectrum.  Instead of having the central figure being a mobster, who is destined for either jail or a pine box, the central figure is a FBI agent, who's infiltrated the mob deeper than anyone in the history of the FBI.Basically, what you get is a main character who is human and has all the traits of a normal person, but it also shows the human side of the mob.  You see how a person could become part of it, how they can get drawn in, and how the mob acts like family.

He gets into the mob, by telling ""Lefty,"" who is played by Al Pacino, that a ring he was given is a fake. The scene in the basement, where they are cutting up the bodies of some of the bosses, they just ""whacked,"" is actually real.  In the end of this movie, you see ""Lefty"" going to get ""whacked.""

He wanted to move up yet he never had the chance; perhaps because of a lack of ruthlessness, perhaps because of a lack of intelligence or a combination of the two, he could never climb out of the cesspool he was in and as a result he became mired in a dead end occupation.

6023,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767802551,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Color me surprised, but this movie was downright fantastic.  I really expected something so much less than what I received.  Instead, what I found was a deeply moving, completely engrossing, totally organic and convincing portrait of the grit that is the life of crime AND the life of those who try and prevent it.  With comparisons to `The Godfather' and `GoodFellas', `Donnie Brasco' is the type of film that really had to deliver in order to make any sort of impact.Personally, `Donnie Brasco' blows `GoodFellas' out of the water.Based on the real life memoirs of Joe Pistone, `Donnie Brasco' centers around the world of Joe (or Donnie), an ambitious undercover cop who infiltrates the New York mob scene when he gets placed under the wing of Benjamin `Lefty' Ruggiero, a `made man' who takes a liking (almost paternal) to Donnie.  As Donnie gets deeper and deeper into this world of which he is trying to expose, he finds his personal life slipping away from him.  Soon, his family is torn in two as his wife begins to resent him for his involvement and before he knows it, he has become the very thing he has sworn to destroy.I have made it pretty clear that I personally feel Al Pacino has wasted his talent pretty much as soon as the 70's ended.  He is one of those actors who was SO good and then suddenly became nothing more than a clich&eacute;.  He is nearly irrelevant today.  That said, his performance in `Donnie Brasco' is a work of genius.  I just cannot believe that this is AL PACINO.  He really reaches back to his glory days and delivers an outstanding portrayal of a man intent of surviving yet never so much that he loses touch of what makes him human.  Watching Lefty interact with the ruthless people around him brings an odd fascination.  Lefty seems almost like an outcast.  He is strong and certainly authentic, but he feels almost too warm at times, which adds to his character's remarkable development (such a superbly crafted sympathetic character that never grates on clich&eacute;d manipulative sentiments).I've also made it pretty clear that I consider Johnny Depp an overrated actor.  So many consider him the `it' guy today.  It is very cool to like Johnny Depp, but personally he hasn't delivered a strong performance for me in many years.  I was hesitant to watch this film because I am not a fan of either Pacino or Depp, but I must say that this may be Depp's finest performance to date (I adore him in `Benny and Joon', but the depth he brings to Donnie is completely remarkable).  There is a loneliness that Depp captures, perfectly depicting the descention his character is making into that dark hole that is his profession.Like I said, color me surprised.With outstanding supporting performances by Anne Heche and Michael Madsen, not to mention a memorable turn from Bruno Kirby (so underrated in his day as a supporting player), `Donnie Brasco' is an acting triumph.  Not just that, it is marvelously scripted to completely engage the audience.  The film has so much grit and realism.

6024,A2SP2LGE4NCYMR,0767802551,"Arne Andersen ""Arne Blaze""","[2, 2]","DONNIE BRASCO is an excellent film in every way.  The justly Oscar-nominated screenplay is complexly layered.  The performances are all of the highest calibre.  Pacino should have received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Lefty and Anne Heche deserved a nod in the Supporting Actress performance as Donnie's put upon wife.  This was Depp's first great performance as well. His Donnie has to be able to operate on three levels simultaneously - allowing the audience to perceive wordlessly what he is thinking and feeling, while not betraying any of this to the underworld characters he is interacting with - a subtle and galvanized performance.At first with a moustache and sporting a Brooklyn accent, Depp as Donnie is an FBI agent infiltrating a NY mob.  His protector is a two-bit gangster, Lefty, disillusioned that he has nothing to show for a life time of service. He is also disappointed in his drug-addicted son.  Donnie gives him a chance to believe in something and becomes his surrogate son. Donnie in turn gives Lefty the respect and schemes for wealth that have been absent from his life.  These two bond in ways that go beyond the FBI's predictions of what the sting should look like.Donnie becomes enmeshed with Lefty, slowly becoming a ""wise guy"" himself, disillusioned at the lack of respect and reward he as an FBI agent is receiving.  As the sting gets closer, Donnie is torn between doing his job and saving his new friend, Lefty.It is an emotional film and one very taut and tense.  There are moments when we are sure Donnie is going to be exposed and we cringe.  The whole thing is superbly directed by Mike Newell, who manges to extract amazing nuances from a script that Scorcese would have trampled over.  (Indeed Scorcese's THE DEPARTED is simply a reworking of the DONNIE BRASCO script with two infiltrators rather than one.)The mob is ugly- we are taken inside their world and see them for what they are - macho, ugly, brutal, ignorant, uneducated, evil pieces of scum - disgusting and revolting dregs of humanity.  Newell pulls no punches here - be warned. We are shown in minute detail the steps whereby a novice gets into the undeworld and how he moves up, step by step - as well as the ""language"" of the streets.There is an excellent and unobstrusive dramatic score.  Paul Giammatti (sp?) appears in two small scenes, one as the inquistor we've been waiting for, asking ""So, what does 'Forget about it!' really mean?""To sum up: This is an excellent film about ugly people with a superb script, fine direction and top notch performances.  One of the best and Depp's first step up the ladder to his position today as America's best screen actor.",5,Excellent and insightful drama of loyalty and betrayal,1194998400,"11 14, 2007",2007,2694,"['DONNIE', 'BRASCO', 'excellent', 'film', 'way', 'justly', 'Oscar-nominated', 'screenplay', 'complexly', 'layered', 'performances', 'are', 'highest', 'calibre', 'Pacino', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Lefty', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'deserved', 'nod', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'performance', 'Donnie', 'put', 'wife', 'was', 'Depp', 'first', 'great', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Donnie', 'be', 'able', 'operate', 'three', 'levels', 'simultaneously', 'allowing', 'audience', 'perceive', 'wordlessly', 'what', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'not', 'betraying', 'underworld', 'characters', 'interacting', 'subtle', 'galvanized', 'performance.At', 'first', 'moustache', 'sporting', 'Brooklyn', 'accent', 'Depp', 'Donnie', 'FBI', 'agent', 'infiltrating', 'NY', 'mob', 'protector', 'two-bit', 'gangster', 'Lefty', 'disillusioned', 'nothing', 'show', 'life', 'time', 'service', 'also', 'disappointed', 'drug-addicted', 'son', 'Donnie', 'chance', 'believe', 'something', 'surrogate', 'son', 'Donnie', 'turn', 'Lefty', 'respect', 'schemes', 'wealth', 'have', 'been', 'absent', 'life', 'two', 'bond', 'ways', 'go', 'FBI', 'predictions', 'what', 'sting', 'should', 'look', 'like.Donnie', 'becomes', 'enmeshed', 'Lefty', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'wise', 'guy', 'disillusioned', 'lack', 'respect', 'reward', 'FBI', 'agent', 'receiving', 'sting', 'closer', 'Donnie', 'torn', 'doing', 'job', 'saving', 'new', 'friend', 'Lefty.It', 'emotional', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'taut', 'tense', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'are', 'sure', 'Donnie', 'going', 'be', 'exposed', 'cringe', 'whole', 'thing', 'superbly', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'who', 'extract', 'amazing', 'nuances', 'script', 'Scorcese', 'would', 'have', 'trampled', 'over', 'Indeed', 'Scorcese', 'THE', 'DEPARTED', 'simply', 'reworking', 'DONNIE', 'BRASCO', 'script', 'two', 'infiltrators', 'rather', 'one', 'mob', 'ugly-', 'are', 'taken', 'world', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'macho', 'ugly', 'brutal', 'ignorant', 'uneducated', 'evil', 'pieces', 'scum', 'disgusting', 'revolting', 'dregs', 'humanity', 'Newell', 'punches', 'here', 'be', 'warned', 'are', 'shown', 'minute', 'detail', 'steps', 'whereby', 'novice', 'undeworld', 'how', 'up', 'step', 'step', 'as', 'well', 'language', 'streets.There', 'excellent', 'unobstrusive', 'dramatic', 'score', 'Paul', 'Giammatti', 'sp', 'two', 'small', 'scenes', 'one', 'inquistor', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'asking', 'So', 'what', ""'Forget"", 'really', 'mean', 'sum', 'up', 'excellent', 'film', 'ugly', 'people', 'superb', 'script', 'fine', 'direction', 'top', 'notch', 'performances', 'One', 'best', 'Depp', 'first', 'step', 'up', 'ladder', 'position', 'today', 'America', 'best', 'screen', 'actor']",N/A
6025,A1S0B6U13Y0F6N,0767802551,"Ben Parker ""Cheshire""","[3, 4]","First rate mafia drama connects on a deeper level than most. Its cinematography may not have the moody, noirish atmosphere that makes The Godfather so appealing, but despite its slick Hollywood look, it seems to attain such penetrating truth (this, perhaps, has a little to do with its being based on a book by the real life main character). The central situation of the aging mafia man taking under his confidence and vouching for an undercover FBI agent, and that a bond forms between the two men is a great one. The performances are absolutely superb. Particularly the two men who the story centres on, Joe Pistone, a.k.a Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, going for realism in this role, is incredible. It begins and ends with a closeup of his eyes - this movie would be nothing without him) and mafia man &quot;Lefty&quot; (Pacino, who gives us one of his finest characterisations - best bit, his close-up after Donnie is asked to shake hands by a certain character on a certain boat). The vividness of the characters in this movie seems to owe a great deal to the superb screenplay (again, credit to the real-life source material). Recurring catch-phrases make it easy for us to get to know characters, a wonderful little touches give the story such a resonance, and make it ring true: like Lefty's smoking inside the car when driving with Brasco and accusing Brasco of trying to kill him with the draft when he opens a window to let some smoke out, and the portrait of Lefty, the opposite of how we imagine a mafia veteran, as a vulnerable, often emotional man.Deserves at least four stars.

6026,A34PAZQ73SL163,0767802551,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[0, 0]","This is one of the most underrated movies ever made. I think that Goodfellas and The Godfather trilogy (really, only Parts I and II) set the bar so high for mob movies that Donnie Brasco never received the full adulation it deserved. With Al Pacino, he's been brilliant so often that it's a challenge to explain why he's unique in this role. All I can say is that he IS Lefty even had Lefty never existed before. The unkempt hair, the goofy glasses, the mixture of desperation and violence are exactly what we would expect from a long-time, disaffected mafia enforcer. There's no Hollywood glamour; only grit, grime, and charm. That he so captures our sympathy cannot be taken for granted as I'm not sure another actor could influence us the way Pacino does. As for Depp, he won me over a decade ago with Ed Wood, and his portrayal of Brasco is sensational. If you gave a role like this to DiCaprio, it would be a disaster, yet Depp is infinitely competent. Lastly, Madsen as Sonny Black was a real treat. I went online and took a gander at some of the pictures of the real Sonny, and, of course, there are few physical similarites, but he's a stand out as well. I saw Donnie Brasco yesterday for the second time and found that I could not turn it off. If you asked me how long it was, I'd honestly would not know. Not a great movie?

The primary mobster in this film is named Lefty who is played by Al Pacino.  Lefty is a man who by his admission has murdered 26 men.  Despite this fact Pacino and director Mike Newell go to great length attempting to demonstrate Lefty's honorable character.In the Special Edition DVD of this film Newell provides a commentary.  One of the things he speaks about is how the film is a tragedy because it show Donnie Brasco's moral center being corrupted by associating with the mosters he is assigned to bring down.  I believe, however, that the true tragedy is the lengths that films such as this one and many others go to attempt to portray members of organized crime who have no problems with taking human life as decent and even normal individuals.  Could that not be a tragedy worth a film of its own?To further support the fact which I am attempting to exress Newell admits or even brags on the commentary that while filming Donnie Brasco they had a mobster on staff.

The main difference between the book & the movie is that it WAS NOT Lefty Ruggiero that Pistone became so close to, it was Sonny Black. That's okay, though, this movie is very entertaining & features an outstanding cast: Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche (who gets FAR too little screen time but is terrific nevertheless), & especially Michael Madsen, who's one of my favorite actors. The acting is great, the script is believable, & the music is fabulous. Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances & Al Pacino is awesome as usual.

Mike Newell's film is an original addition to a genre that has been mined many times but as proven here still has some life to it.  Johnny Depp portrays Joe Pistone, an F.B.I. operative who goes undercover to infiltrate the mob using the alias Donnie Brasco.  He is taken under the wing by Lefty Ruggiero(Al Pacino), a mob lifer who has spent his career on the fringes of the organization without being made.  Through this association Pistone gains access to other aspects of the mob.  The film deftly portrays the pressures that Pistone faces from his activities undercover and the strain that it is putting on his home life.  Also, you can a sense that Pistone is starting to enjoy his life as Donnie Brasco.  Depp adds another great character to his evergrowing gallery of great performances without overplaying it.  Pacino, who has assayed this genre many times, gives a low-keyed effective performance.  One can feel a sense of empathy for his character for all the disappointments in his life.

Not only that but Lefty in sense adopts him as his surrogate son by protecting and coaching him in the ways of the mob.  More than just a gangland saga like ""Goodfellows"" or ""The Godfather"", ""Donnie Brasco"" is a intimate love story between two men which ends in tragedy and torment for both.  For Pistone as ""Donnie"", it is that sooner or later he will betray Lefty and for Lefty, it's only a matter of time before he knows he'll be whacked.

It's not so much because it's a movie about the Mafia, but because the humanizing performance both Pacino and Depp give in this memorable film.Of course, the story is simply great -- and made for the movies -- because it's based on a true story.  Some of the events seem a little farfetched; e.g., when Lefty queries Donnie about the boat and then just walks away from it.  But somehow, the film never loses its magnetism, as it keeps the audience guessing and worrying about the agent's fate, and Lefty's fate.Pacino's performance here is one of his best.  There's a bit of over-acting in some scenes, but overall, he makes Lefty a likeable mobster that we even come to pity and root for.  Pacino just seems to much more believable as Lefty than godfather in ""Godfather 3.""  Depp's performance as the undercover agent is also strong, but lacks some depth.BTW, whether you liked this film or not, you should definitely read the book, ""Donnie Brasco,"" written by the FBI agent.

Mike Newell's direction again makes the point that Eurpoean's have a fresh view of American film and it's most stalwart genres.  DONNIE BRASCO could serve as an FBI training film  and why protocol should dictate that married men are forbidden to undertake deep cover assignments.  The only flaw I caught was the reference to John Wayne's death:  The Duke died June, 1979 and the film shows 6 inches of snow in New Jersey.

Mical,"[3, 4]","Like Westerns, gangster films are a unique, American invention; our fascination for these movies seems hard to understand at times, considering the amoral and destructive actions of the patriarchal characters involved.  Perhaps in spite of these deficiencies, gangster movies allow us to look at criminals as human beings, as flawed and unfortunate as the rest of us.  Donnie Brasco, far more than other movies in the genre, takes this possibility and turns it into the driving force behind its emotional impact.  It is a welcome relief from the near-glorification of gangster life in late 80s and early 90s movies such as Casino, Scarface, and others, and it injected a much-needed dose of nitro.  Donnie Brasco's gangsters aren't your rich, creme de la creme godfathers - they are the underlings, involved in a lifestyle they can no longer refuse.The film follows FBI Agent Joe Pistone, who is undercover in Brooklyn as Donnie Brasco, jeweler (Johnny Depp, in one of his best movie roles).  After winning the trust and confidence of low-budget hitman &quot;Lefty&quot; (Al Pacino, who should have been nominated for an Oscar), &quot;Donnie&quot; begins to move around in the New York underworld.  When the old boss is &quot;whacked,&quot; another mobster seizes the opportunity and gains control, allowing &quot;Donnie&quot; to go further into the mob scene than any undercover cop ever did before.  Eventually, the lines between work and self break down, making Donnie's ultimate decision all the more visceral and real.Based on a true story, Donnie Brasco rings true throughout, uncompromising and unflinching.  Depp and Pacino deliver outstanding performances, and Anne Heche, in a supporting role as Joe's increasingly frustrated wife, shines in her best role to date.  The plot, too, moves along at a steady clip, never losing momentum and never slipping into the easy, moralizing path this film could easily have taken.  The only real problem was at the beginning of the film, where things seem to happen without much reason, but causes and effects are easily inferred.This DVD Special Edition has a very informative commentary track, and a few non-necessary deleted scenes.  The picture and sound, however, are fantastic; nary a scratch or dust spot on the print, and the sound is as clear and well-mixed as can be expected.  The featurettes are interesting, but seem a little too short (as do many DVD featurettes).The movie is bound to become a classic, not only in the gangster genre but in American filmmaking as well.

This 1997 movie stars Anne Heche, James Russo, Rocco Sisto, Brian Tarantina, Robert Miano, Zeljko Ivanek, Bruno Kirby, Michael Madsen, Johnny Depp, and Al Pacino.  It is rated R for the language, and for the violence - but not because of nudity.  I've seen more nudity on TV commercials.Basically, the story is more about keeping secrets and betrayal - which have definitive consequences on the mafia side of the street.  I bought the extended cut version so I could get more meat out of the viewing.  All I got was tripe.For all the star power this movie has, it fell short.  If Hollywood makes another movie like this and it gets rave reviews as being all that and a bag of potato chips oh snap, then I won't trust any movie critic I don't know personally because somebody was bought off who said this was great.  There is no feel for this being a drama about the mafia underworld, and the violence could be cut out by removing five  minutes of the show.  It's two hours and seven minutes long.  It could stand five minutes taken out.  Then dub in politically correct and acceptable language like they do when it goes on TV, and this movie could be rated PG.  ""Donnie Brasco"" has all the excitement of a trip to the grocery store for a gallon of milk and a pack of cigarettes.

Lefty vouches for Joe and brings him into his mob family.  What was supposed to be a three-month assignment for Joe turns into several years.  Joe begins to drift away from his own family and deep into the mob.  He and Lefty form a strong bond and a father son relationship.  When the investigation is coming to an end Joe realizes that his only way out of the mob is to betray his friend.The film is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  It is a very nice transfer the only flaw I noticed was a hint of grain occasionally.  A Dolby Digital 5.0 audio track is provided.  The surround speakers are hardly used.  When they are its mostly only for music.  With a movie like this that is mostly dialogue its understandable.  This special edition DVD has several extras.  The highlights are a director's commentary, two featurettes, deleted scenes and trailers.  The featurette titled ""Donnie Brasco: Out of the Shadows"" was excellent.  It gives a lot of background on the film and contains several interviews with the cast and crew.  The deleted scenes are nice to see but I can understand why they were cut from the film.For those of you thinking this is just another mob movie, you are wrong.  Instead of showing the top of the crime family tree like many other films this one shows the bottom.  It shows soldiers that are scraping at the bottom of the barrel and are just trying to make ends meet.  This is a film that stands on its own on many levels.

One man, Joe Pistone a.k.a. Donnie Brasco, sacrificed everything in his life including family  and sometimes sanity to become the FBI's supreme undercover agent. By 1982,  the work of Donnie Brasco would bring in not only about 200 convictions  (A  staggering amount by any standard), but would also bring down the most  powerful mob bosses in history up to that date (the fall of John Gotti was  still almost a decade away.)  Pistone/Brasco (Johnny Depp) is introduced  into the mob by passing himself off as a jewelry smuggler. Eventually he  befriends Lefty (Al Pacino), a mid-level mob hitman who takes Brasco under  his wing. As time goes by, Brasco makes connections with the high-ranking  officials of the New York Mafia by making himself visible and gaining their  trust by way of business and clout. After perfectly keeping up his act as  Donnie Brasco for more than five years, Joe Pistone, his wife (Anne Heche)  and children go into the witness protection program under which they still  live. To this day the Mafia still has a contract on Pistone's life for  $  500,000. Although there is some violence and interesting action, one thing  not to expect in this film is gun blazing, bloodletting action ala  Goodfellas.

As a Pacino fan, a Johnny Depp fan, and a mobster movie addict, it's nothing short of amazing that I only watched DONNIE BRASCO for the first time this week.My only complaint about DONNIE BRASCO is that it's too short and light. Another fifteen minutes of screen time would have deepened the characters immensely. DONNIE BRASCO doesn't do a great job of capturing the ambience of the late 70s, but it's a relatively minor flaw in an otherwise impressive picture. Overall, with its renditions of petty thievery, (breaking open parking meters for change), cheap shot extortion (putting muscle on Mom-and-Pop corner grocery stores for a few hundred bucks a week) and constant pointless but violent arguments, the timbre of DONNIE BRASCO reflectsMean Streetsmore thanThe Godfather.There's no romance in DONNIE BRASCO's Mafia. Depp plays Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who is tasked with infiltrating the Bonnanno Family in late 1970s New York City. Using the alias ""Donnie Brasco,"" Pistone befriends low-level torpedo Lefty Ruggerio (Al Pacino), who is permanently rooted near the bottom of the Family food chain. The dynamic ""Brasco"" however, soon attracts the attention of crew boss Sonny ""Black"" Napolitano (Michael Madsen), who begins moving Brasco (and himself) up through the ranks. A disappointed Lefty is left behind, although Brasco/Pistone tries mightily to maintain his links with Lefty if for no other reason than they've become friends.The strain of leading his double life puts Pistone at terrible risk. His marriage collapses and his personal family life becomes a shambles. He begins to adopt street talk, to hit his wife, and to put his Family before his family. He is forced into committing minor crimes as part of his cover, and assists in chopping up and burying the bodies after a hit. He's recognized by a law-and-order colleague whom he punches out in order to protect himself. Still, there is much in the camaraderie of the Family that Pistone appreciates. Eventually, as he tells his wife, ""I'm not like them---I am them."" Just as he's about to become a made guy, the FBI swoops in and arrests everyone, shutting down his undercover operation.Pistone's activities send roughly one hundred mobsters to jail, and earn him a medal, a commendation, and a $500.00 bonus check, and a deep ambivalence toward his work and his life.After watching DONNIE BRASCO, I found myself questioning whether, given the crummy quality of the mob as portrayed, the risk and expense of breaking up ""organized crime"" was at all worth it.

6088,A16X61RLY1YJL7,0767802551,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[32, 35]","&quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; is a true mafia masterpiece and what is more interesting about it is that it is based on an amazing true story.  This is the true story of FBI undercover agent Joseph D. Pistone, who when faced with the task of infiltrating a New York City &quot;family,&quot; he not only does that, but he did it with perfection.  As you will soon learn with this movie, FBI undercover agent Joseph Pistone infiltrated and stayed within this &quot;family&quot; for six years and if it weren't for his superiors' intervention he would've stayed with them even longer, as he was within months of becoming a &quot;made&quot; wise guy when he was brought out.&quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; represents a sort of coming out for Johnny Depp in that this was really his first adult dramatic role that didn't portray him as a teenager or something in the Science Fiction range.  He truly deserves all of the accolades that he earned for this role.  Al Pacino's performance was superior for this movie.  In so many movies he's made, he's played pretty much the same guy with a different name, this is not the case with his role in &quot;Donnie Brasco,&quot; he truly became the character he was playing.  This was an Oscar winning performance on his part, the only missing part was the actual best supporting Oscar.  The performances by Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, Anne Heche and all of the other actors in this outstanding film all served beautifully in making this film the true silver screen masterpiece that it is.It's kind of odd that British director Mike Newell of &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; fame would get the directing nod for &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; but in the end, it worked out perfectly and he deserves a great amount of credit for the &quot;style&quot; and &quot;atmosphere&quot; of this film.  The score for &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; plays perfectly with every scene of the film, serving to enhance the story.The premise:FBI undercover agent Joseph D. Pistone is tasked with the mission to infiltrate Lefty Ruggiero's (Al Pacino) mob family.  Posing as a jewel broker Donnie Brasco, Agent Pistone does this with apparent ease.  He soon learns that this will not be a quick task to complete and his six year run begins, jeopardizing his family, his career and his life as he becomes so intertwined with this crime family and starts to care about his mob &quot;mentor&quot; Lefty, whose life will become forfeit when the truth is revealed.For any fan of the &quot;mob&quot; movie genre, I highly recommend this film as it gives a perfect look at the mob lifestyle and it easily ranks up there with many of the famous mob movies.  This movie will certainly bear multiple viewings.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:- Director's Commentary- Exclusive Featurette &quot;Donnie Brasco:  Out from the Shadows&quot;- Original Featurette- Deleted Scenes with or without commentary- Isolated Music Score- Theatrical trailers- Talent Files- Production notes",5,Donnie Brasco - A true mafia masterpiece!,1066953600,"10 24, 2003",2003,2967,"['quot', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'quot', 'true', 'mafia', 'masterpiece', 'what', 'more', 'interesting', 'based', 'amazing', 'true', 'story', 'true', 'story', 'FBI', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Joseph', 'D.', 'Pistone', 'who', 'when', 'faced', 'task', 'infiltrating', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'quot', 'family', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'perfection', 'will', 'soon', 'learn', 'movie', 'FBI', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Joseph', 'Pistone', 'infiltrated', 'stayed', 'quot', 'family', 'quot', 'six', 'years', 'were', ""n't"", 'superiors', 'intervention', 'would', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'even', 'longer', 'was', 'months', 'becoming', 'quot', 'made', 'quot', 'wise', 'guy', 'when', 'was', 'brought', 'out.', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'quot', 'sort', 'coming', 'out', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'really', 'first', 'adult', 'dramatic', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'portray', 'teenager', 'something', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'range', 'truly', 'accolades', 'earned', 'role', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'was', 'superior', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'made', 'played', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'guy', 'different', 'name', 'not', 'case', 'role', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'quot', 'truly', 'became', 'character', 'was', 'playing', 'was', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'part', 'only', 'missing', 'part', 'was', 'actual', 'best', 'supporting', 'Oscar', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'other', 'actors', 'outstanding', 'film', 'served', 'beautifully', 'making', 'film', 'true', 'silver', 'screen', 'masterpiece', 'kind', 'odd', 'British', 'director', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'quot', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'quot', 'fame', 'would', 'get', 'directing', 'nod', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'quot', 'end', 'worked', 'out', 'perfectly', 'great', 'amount', 'credit', 'quot', 'style', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'score', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'quot', 'perfectly', 'scene', 'film', 'serving', 'enhance', 'story.The', 'premise', 'FBI', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Joseph', 'D.', 'Pistone', 'tasked', 'mission', 'infiltrate', 'Lefty', 'Ruggiero', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'mob', 'family', 'Posing', 'jewel', 'broker', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'Agent', 'Pistone', 'apparent', 'ease', 'soon', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'quick', 'task', 'complete', 'six', 'year', 'run', 'jeopardizing', 'family', 'career', 'life', 'so', 'intertwined', 'crime', 'family', 'care', 'mob', 'quot', 'mentor', 'quot', 'Lefty', 'life', 'will', 'become', 'forfeit', 'when', 'truth', 'revealed.For', 'fan', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'genre', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'perfect', 'look', 'mob', 'lifestyle', 'easily', 'up', 'there', 'many', 'famous', 'mob', 'movies', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'bear', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'Director', 'Commentary-', 'Exclusive', 'Featurette', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'Shadows', 'quot', 'Original', 'Featurette-', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'commentary-', 'Isolated', 'Music', 'Score-', 'Theatrical', 'trailers-', 'Talent', 'Files-', 'Production', 'notes']",N/A

6090,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0767802551,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This griity and grim mob flick, deftly directed by Mike Newell, is based upon the true story of FBI undercover, Joe Pistone, who. as his alter ego ""Donnie Brasco"", infiltrated the mob for a number of years, resulting in its eventual decimation. So artfully did the real Joe Pistone infiltrate and so well did he do his job, that he and his family were obliged to enter the witness protection program for their safety, as a contract was ultimately put out on Joe Pistone's life.Here, Johnny Depp, plays the role of Joe Pistone/Donnie Brasco. He is terrific in the role, and the viewer watches him become absorbed by the lifestyle of the mobsters with whom he associates. He is befriended by ""Lefty"" Ruggierro, artfully played Al Pacino. Shifty and common, ""Lefty"" typifies your low level made guy, the guy on the fringes doing the dirty work, a real bottom feeder. He is the guy who does the hits, and he is the guy the higher ups look to whack when something goes wrong. It is not an enviable or glamourous life, as has been made out by other films, such as the ""Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"". The existence of ""Lefty"" and the legions like him is gritty and grim, always a bridesmaid and never a bride.""Lefty"" takes Brasco under his wing and vouches for him. He shows Brasco the ABCs of becoming a ""made"" guy. ""Lefty"" himself wants to move up in the mob hierarchy. It soon becomes painfully obvious that that ain't gonna happen. One cannot help feel a little sorry for ""Lefty"", so limited is his world view and so at the mercy of others. Still, ""Lefty"" gives Donnie some invaluable lessons on mob etiquette. He also unburdens himself to Donnie, treating him as if he were his adopted son. The bond between the two men grows. As this happens, Donnie finds himself being pulled more and more into the world of mobsters, until his old and new reality begin to merge.As he distances himself drom his wife (Anne Heche) and family, Brasco is thrust into a maelstrom of mob violence that threatens to tear him apart and consume him. He tries to get ""Lefty"" to go straight and retire, in hope of avoiding his betrayal. It is to no avail. Brasco, in for a penny, in for a pound, now stands to become a ""made"" guy himself. It is only at the eleventh hour that an intervention set up by the FBI plays itself out, setting up the betrayal of ""Lefty"". It is a sad moment for Brasco, as he knows that ""Lefty"" has just been handed a death sentence at the hands of the mob for vouching for an FBI agent. It is Brasco's ultimate salvation, however, as he was on the brink of committing an unpardonable act, one in which he would have crossed the line and from which there would have been no turning back. It is a decision that was, luckily for him, taken out of his hands.Al Pacino gives the defining, superlative performance in this film. Anne Heche is sensational as the put upon, concerned wife, who watches her husband change into someone she can barely recognize. Johnny Depp, likewise, gives a stellar performance as the angst ridden FBI undercover agent. All in all, a terrific film with a stellar cast and well worth having in one's collection.",5,"GRIM, GRITTY, SENSATIONAL MOB FLICK...",1148083200,"05 20, 2006",2006,3132,"['griity', 'grim', 'mob', 'flick', 'deftly', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'FBI', 'undercover', 'Joe', 'Pistone', 'who', 'alter', 'ego', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'infiltrated', 'mob', 'number', 'years', 'resulting', 'eventual', 'decimation', 'artfully', 'did', 'real', 'Joe', 'Pistone', 'infiltrate', 'so', 'well', 'did', 'do', 'job', 'family', 'were', 'obliged', 'enter', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'safety', 'contract', 'was', 'ultimately', 'put', 'out', 'Joe', 'Pistone', 'life.Here', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'role', 'Joe', 'Pistone/Donnie', 'Brasco', 'terrific', 'role', 'viewer', 'become', 'absorbed', 'lifestyle', 'mobsters', 'whom', 'befriended', 'Lefty', 'Ruggierro', 'artfully', 'played', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Shifty', 'common', 'Lefty', 'low', 'level', 'made', 'guy', 'guy', 'fringes', 'doing', 'dirty', 'work', 'real', 'bottom', 'feeder', 'guy', 'who', 'hits', 'guy', 'higher', 'ups', 'look', 'whack', 'when', 'something', 'wrong', 'not', 'enviable', 'glamourous', 'life', 'been', 'made', 'out', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Godfather', 'Goodfellas', 'existence', 'Lefty', 'legions', 'gritty', 'grim', 'always', 'bridesmaid', 'never', 'bride', 'Lefty', 'Brasco', 'wing', 'vouches', 'Brasco', 'ABCs', 'becoming', 'made', 'guy', 'Lefty', 'move', 'up', 'mob', 'hierarchy', 'soon', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'happen', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'little', 'sorry', 'Lefty', 'so', 'limited', 'world', 'view', 'so', 'mercy', 'others', 'Still', 'Lefty', 'Donnie', 'invaluable', 'lessons', 'mob', 'etiquette', 'also', 'Donnie', 'treating', 'were', 'adopted', 'son', 'bond', 'two', 'men', 'grows', 'Donnie', 'being', 'pulled', 'more', 'more', 'world', 'mobsters', 'old', 'new', 'reality', 'begin', 'merge.As', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'family', 'Brasco', 'thrust', 'maelstrom', 'mob', 'violence', 'tear', 'apart', 'consume', 'get', 'Lefty', 'go', 'straight', 'retire', 'hope', 'avoiding', 'betrayal', 'avail', 'Brasco', 'penny', 'pound', 'now', 'become', 'made', 'guy', 'only', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'intervention', 'set', 'up', 'FBI', 'out', 'setting', 'up', 'betrayal', 'Lefty', 'sad', 'moment', 'Brasco', 'Lefty', 'just', 'been', 'handed', 'death', 'sentence', 'hands', 'mob', 'vouching', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Brasco', 'ultimate', 'salvation', 'however', 'was', 'brink', 'committing', 'unpardonable', 'act', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'crossed', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'turning', 'back', 'decision', 'was', 'luckily', 'taken', 'hands.Al', 'Pacino', 'defining', 'superlative', 'performance', 'film', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'sensational', 'put', 'concerned', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'change', 'someone', 'can', 'barely', 'recognize', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'likewise', 'stellar', 'performance', 'angst', 'ridden', 'FBI', 'undercover', 'agent', 'terrific', 'film', 'stellar', 'cast', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'one', 'collection']",N/A

With stars like Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, and many more, this is a movie that should be seen by all.FBI Joseph D. Pistone is an undercover agent who's goal is to get into the violent and unpredictable mob world.  He goes the by name of Donnie Brasco.  Soon he is discovered by Lefty Ruggiero, who sees potential in the kid, not aware of who Brasco really is.  He brings him into the family and the world of the Mafia.  It doesn't take long for Joseph to get so deep into the action that he starts to become one of them.  This unforgettable picture shows us that sometimes you can become what you chase if you're in too long, and that in order to catch a monster you may become one yourself in the process.I became addicted to this film in no time.  It's one of my favorites that I have seen over and over again, and it hasn't gotten old yet.  The acting and directing is all fantastic.  Al Pacino really shines, as always, and Johnny Depp gives an Academy Award performance as the FBI agent.  He actually spent time with the real Joseph Pistone to get his character down, as he did when he was working on &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&quot;  Michael Madsen is also terrific and can once again send chills down our spines just as he did in &quot;Reservoir Dogs.&quot;This new special edition of the DVD is much, MUCH better than the original.  First off, the sound and picture quality has really improved.  Especially the picture; it looks a lot better than the first version that came out.  There are also a lot of extras, including features such as director's commentary, and exclusive featurette, the original featurette, deleted scenes, trailers, and more.  The featurettes are very interesting and makes the DVD that much more special.  A very high quality special edition, if you ask me.All in all, &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; is an outstanding picture on all fronts.  Filled with drama and suspense, this is a film that will take you deep into the world of the Mafia.  The only question is how far would you go?

This is one of Johnny Depps first Big leading roles in a film and he holds up even against the great Al Pacino. Speaking of Al Pacino..he should easily have been nominated for a Oscar for his portrayal of Lefty, but more times than not the Oscar Academy has no clue what great acting is (Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York should have won last year no questions asked!). Michael Madsen is always a fun actor to watch on screen and this is one of his best performances. Anne Heche really impressed me with her acting as well and she actually looked kinda hot. The last scene in this film featuring Al Pacino opening a drawer, putting in a few precious items, closing it, only to open it again and leave it ajar a few moments later is truly powerful because of what it implies.

In the same way some war veterans talk of nothing but their heroics, struggles and the mechanics of their war, Lefty  is obsessed with the mythology of the mafia. Toobad for him he is less a  Godfather and more of a small fish on the mafia foodchain. The rest of that  phrase is &quot;...and its your best friend that does it.&quot;  Donnie Brasco tells the story of undercover agent Joe Pistone's (Johnny  Deppy) ifilteration of the mob in 1978. He introduces himself as &quot;Don  the jeweller&quot;. He immediately gains the respect and love of Lefty (Al  Pacino), and he is presented to the rest of the crew as a &quot;a friend of  Lefty's&quot;. You see, if he is a &quot;friend of Lefty's&quot; that means  he is a connected guy, if he were a &quot;friend of ours&quot; that would  make him a made guy.Donnie Brasco will not disappoint fans of the  genre, it has all the mob talk, the back alley butcherings and the tense  stand offs. But what makes the film the masterpiece that it is, the warm  and brilliantly acted and realised central relationship between Donnie/Joe  and Lefty. I read an interview with director Mike Newel where he called the  film &quot;a love story&quot;, and that is absolutely right.People  often accuse Al Pacino of hamming it up and going for an autopilot  &quot;whoa&quot; performance in many of his films, like his Satan in The  Devil's Advocate. Nevermind the fact that Pacino's autopilot is more  gripping then most actors' most vivid characterisation, his performance in  Donnie Brasco is arguably his best. As Lefty Ruggerro he is both  heartbreaking and frightening, ruthless and all too human. He delivers his  lines with is patented fiery intensity, but this time he lets you know he's  bluffing, that he' can't back up that big mouth of his. He shines in two  particular scenes, one in the hospital and the other is final haunting  scene. I will not describe them here. See them for yourself.Donnie  Brasco was released in the spring of 1997, and since the Academy has a  pathetically short memory, the film only managed one Oscar nomination which  was for Paul Attanasio screen adaptation. When they ignored Pacino's  performance here, that is when they completely lost credibility with me.Is Donnie Brasco one of the best gangster pictures ever made?  Fuggedaboutit (in the positive sense of the phrase). It deserves to sit at  the same table and have coffee on the house with the masterpiece of the  genre, Goodfellas.",5,"&quot;You go in alive, you come out dead. &quot;",959126400,"05 24, 2000",2000,2552,"['title', 'review', 'phrase', 'said', 'one', 'Benjamin', 'quot', 'Lefty', 'quot', 'Ruggerro', 'same', 'way', 'war', 'veterans', 'talk', 'nothing', 'heroics', 'struggles', 'mechanics', 'war', 'Lefty', 'obsessed', 'mythology', 'mafia', 'Toobad', 'less', 'Godfather', 'more', 'small', 'fish', 'mafia', 'foodchain', 'rest', 'phrase', 'quot', 'best', 'friend', 'it.', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'story', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Joe', 'Pistone', 'Johnny', 'Deppy', 'ifilteration', 'mob', '1978', 'quot', 'Don', 'jeweller', 'quot', 'immediately', 'gains', 'respect', 'love', 'Lefty', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'presented', 'rest', 'crew', 'quot', 'friend', 'Lefty', 'quot', 'see', 'quot', 'friend', 'Lefty', 'quot', 'connected', 'guy', 'were', 'quot', 'friend', 'ours', 'quot', 'would', 'make', 'made', 'guy.Donnie', 'Brasco', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'genre', 'mob', 'talk', 'back', 'alley', 'butcherings', 'tense', 'stand', 'offs', 'what', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'warm', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'realised', 'central', 'relationship', 'Donnie/Joe', 'Lefty', 'read', 'interview', 'director', 'Mike', 'Newel', 'where', 'called', 'film', 'quot', 'love', 'story', 'quot', 'absolutely', 'right.People', 'often', 'accuse', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'hamming', 'up', 'going', 'autopilot', 'quot', 'quot', 'performance', 'many', 'films', 'Satan', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'Nevermind', 'fact', 'Pacino', 'autopilot', 'more', 'gripping', 'then', 'most', 'actors', 'most', 'vivid', 'characterisation', 'performance', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'arguably', 'best', 'Lefty', 'Ruggerro', 'heartbreaking', 'frightening', 'ruthless', 'too', 'human', 'lines', 'patented', 'fiery', 'intensity', 'time', 'know', 'bluffing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'back', 'up', 'big', 'mouth', 'two', 'particular', 'scenes', 'one', 'hospital', 'other', 'final', 'haunting', 'scene', 'will', 'not', 'describe', 'here', 'See', 'yourself.Donnie', 'Brasco', 'was', 'released', 'spring', '1997', 'Academy', 'pathetically', 'short', 'memory', 'film', 'only', 'managed', 'one', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'Paul', 'Attanasio', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'When', 'ignored', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'here', 'when', 'completely', 'lost', 'credibility', 'me.Is', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'one', 'best', 'gangster', 'pictures', 'ever', 'made', 'Fuggedaboutit', 'positive', 'sense', 'phrase', 'sit', 'same', 'table', 'have', 'coffee', 'house', 'masterpiece', 'genre', 'Goodfellas']",N/A

In fact, the story is almost completely fabricated in order to present a drama that comes off as very forced in some spots, again with the acting being the only saving grace.In the mid-1970s, FBI agent Joe Pistone went undercover as 'Donnie Brasco', a connected guy.  After a couple of years of hanging around made guys, he hooked up with Benny 'Lefty' Ruggeiro, a made guy in the Bonanno crime family.  He hung around for a few more years, even meeting with a couple of bosses, until he ended the assignment and went on to help put about a hundred wiseguys in jail.Unfortunately, the film tries to fit a lot into its running time.  We never get a good sense of how long this assignment is, and how Brasco (Johnny Depp) really gets along with the family.  Instead, we get cliche after cliche.  He's away from his wife (Anne Heche) and his kids, slowly bending his marriage until it breaks, with the requisite cliches about how 'you're becoming like Them', etc, etc.  He has to engage in several unpleasantries, like beating the maitre'd of a Japanese restaurant who insists Brasco remove his boots before being seated...except Brasco keeps his trusty FBI tape recorder in there.  Brasco even helps the crew chop up some bodies after a grisly quadruple hit, reluctantly sawing a leg in a dingy basement.The only recommendation points are the two leads.  Pacino is perfect as the rumpled, passed-over Lefty, who spends much time complaining about the unfairness of the current Mafia administration.  Depp seems much older, and he holds his own.  The rest of the cast is good, though we get the feeling they're not acting so much as playing up stereotypes of guys they've seen in other movies, or even played (Bruno Kirby).  Michael Madsen also does a raspy, Brooklyn accent that slips a couple of times.  It all seems forced, too contrived, and I chalk that up to the writer and the director.  There are some seriously laughable lines in here that I doubt any wiseguy has ever said, the kind of lines and scenes that are flashing 'Exposition'.  The director is a Brit, having previously helmed Four Weddings and a Funeral, perhaps not the best choice for a flick about the Mafia in Brooklyn.Overall, if you're a mob movie addict, you'll have to see the movie.  But I remember it being much better back in 1997.  It's kind of tired, the drama is very connect-the-dots, and perhaps worst of all, most of the material is downright fabricated with only a very loose connection to the real events Pistone covered in the source book.  Also, the movie does very little to even explain what's going on in the Mafia it's depicting--the internal wars, the personal beefs--and it's only illumination is about 'the rules' that Brasco slowly learns from the veterans.  In 2004, many of the details of these events came to light in a federal trial for the current Boss of the Bonannos, making you think the real wiseguys laughed out loud at this.  The film hinges on self-parody many times, especially the repetition of 'fuhgettaboutit', repeated by no less than three of the main actors.  If you don't take it too seriously, and if you realize it's just Hollywood-ized Mafia, it can be a lot of fun.",3,"Fuhgettaboutit, indeed",1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,3701,"['Donnie', 'Brasco', 'one', 'movies', 'always', 'regarded', 'well', 'watched', 'again', 'few', 'years', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'Actually', 'think', 'pretty', 'bad', 'movie', 'only', 'acting', 'leads', 'recommend', 'it.Perhaps', 'Sopranos', 'effect', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'better', 'written', 'acted', 'drama', 'involving', 'Mafia', 'movie', 'appeared', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'spoiled', 'so', 'Brasco', 'even', 'weaker', 'perhaps', 'Brasco', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'begin', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'pretty', 'loose', 'fact', 'story', 'almost', 'completely', 'fabricated', 'order', 'present', 'drama', 'off', 'very', 'forced', 'spots', 'again', 'acting', 'being', 'only', 'saving', 'grace.In', 'mid-1970s', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Joe', 'Pistone', 'went', 'undercover', ""'Donnie"", 'Brasco', 'connected', 'guy', 'couple', 'years', 'hanging', 'around', 'made', 'guys', 'hooked', 'up', 'Benny', ""'Lefty"", 'Ruggeiro', 'made', 'guy', 'Bonanno', 'crime', 'family', 'hung', 'around', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'even', 'meeting', 'couple', 'bosses', 'ended', 'assignment', 'went', 'help', 'put', 'hundred', 'wiseguys', 'jail.Unfortunately', 'film', 'tries', 'fit', 'lot', 'running', 'time', 'never', 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'how', 'long', 'assignment', 'how', 'Brasco', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'really', 'family', 'Instead', 'get', 'cliche', 'cliche', 'away', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'kids', 'slowly', 'bending', 'marriage', 'requisite', 'cliches', 'how', ""'you"", ""'re"", 'becoming', 'Them', 'etc', 'etc', 'engage', 'several', 'unpleasantries', 'beating', 'maitre', ""'d"", 'Japanese', 'restaurant', 'who', 'Brasco', 'remove', 'boots', 'being', 'seated', 'Brasco', 'trusty', 'FBI', 'tape', 'recorder', 'there', 'Brasco', 'even', 'crew', 'up', 'bodies', 'grisly', 'quadruple', 'hit', 'reluctantly', 'sawing', 'leg', 'dingy', 'basement.The', 'only', 'recommendation', 'points', 'are', 'two', 'leads', 'Pacino', 'perfect', 'rumpled', 'passed-over', 'Lefty', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'complaining', 'unfairness', 'current', 'Mafia', 'administration', 'Depp', 'much', 'older', 'own', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'get', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'not', 'acting', 'so', 'much', 'playing', 'up', 'stereotypes', 'guys', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'even', 'played', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'also', 'raspy', 'Brooklyn', 'accent', 'couple', 'times', 'forced', 'too', 'contrived', 'chalk', 'writer', 'director', 'are', 'seriously', 'laughable', 'lines', 'here', 'doubt', 'wiseguy', 'ever', 'said', 'kind', 'lines', 'scenes', 'are', 'flashing', ""'Exposition"", 'director', 'Brit', 'having', 'previously', 'helmed', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'perhaps', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'flick', 'Mafia', 'Brooklyn.Overall', ""'re"", 'mob', 'movie', 'addict', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'remember', 'being', 'much', 'better', 'back', '1997', 'kind', 'tired', 'drama', 'very', 'connect-the-dots', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'most', 'material', 'downright', 'fabricated', 'only', 'very', 'loose', 'connection', 'real', 'events', 'Pistone', 'covered', 'source', 'book', 'Also', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'even', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'Mafia', 'depicting', 'internal', 'wars', 'personal', 'beefs', 'only', 'illumination', ""'the"", 'rules', 'Brasco', 'slowly', 'veterans', '2004', 'many', 'details', 'events', 'came', 'light', 'federal', 'trial', 'current', 'Boss', 'Bonannos', 'making', 'think', 'real', 'wiseguys', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'film', 'hinges', 'self-parody', 'many', 'times', 'especially', 'repetition', ""'fuhgettaboutit"", 'repeated', 'less', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'realize', 'just', 'Hollywood-ized', 'Mafia', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'fun']",N/A

Excellent classical soundtrack by composer Patrick Doyle. Great acting from Al Pacino and Johnny Depp portraying real life  gangster Benjamin Ruggierio, and N.Y.P.D. officer Joeseph D. Pistone. I swear at times watching this movie Pacino and Depp were the charachters and forgot that these superstar actors were acting. The late Bruno Kirby plays an excellent but lovable gangster. Mike Madsen plays a tough authentic, believable Boss Sonny Black. The story for ""Donnie Brasco"" was taken from the real eyewitness, and experiences of former cop Joe D. Pistone. From what I've read, and from what I've seen on tv documentaries on the real ""Donnie Brasco"", this movie is portrayed as close to the eyewitness accounts and experiences of Joseph D. Pistone as possibly could be portrayed. Director Mike Newell did an incredible job not only directing, but going to the real Little Italy in Manhatten and speaking to real life gangsters to get a real feel of the life that real mobsters lead. Newell really did his research on Donnie Brasco, as the result is one fine realistic gangster movie. Believe me there is nothing Hollywwood about this gangster movie. ""Donnie Brasco"" may not be as good as ""The Godfather""  movies or ""Goodfellas"" but as I will tell you, it is more authentic than any of the afore mentioned movies. Donnie Brasco is gory at times. There is a scene were Donnie (officer Joe D. Pistone) was forced to cut up dead human bodies to get rid of the evidence. During this time, when the real Joseph D. Pistone was undercover (1976-1981) real gangsters in NYC were performing these horrible acts. During these times real life gangsters like Roy Demeo and his Gang were performing these violent acts at will and made quite a name for themselves in La Cosa Nostra. Even the N.Y.C. Godfather himself Paul Castellano was very intimidated by the likes of Roy Demeo and his savage gang. Castellano although intimidated, tolerated Demeo for his awesome earning rackets. ""Donnie Brasco"" brings this horrific gangster act to life as well as the illegal money rackets going on at this time. Director Mike Newell read up on Roy Demeo and his Gang and brought their actions to the screen and left Hollywood make believe far behind. All I can say is watching ""Donnie Brasco"" made me see the guts undercover officer Joseph D. Pistone had. It really took a special person to do what Joe did. For all his troubles, all Pistone got was a $500.00 check, a medal and a several year stay in the Witness Protection Program. Joe D. Pistone lives in annomity today as there is still a price on his head. ""Donnie Brasco"" is highly recommended viewing as it is portrayed realistically and authentically.

That was my reaction the first time I watched DONNIE BRASCO, a gritty true story about FBI agent Joe Pistone, who infiltrated the New York mafia, at the risk of his life and his family.  Johnny Depp gives a top performance in the title role as Pistone assumes the identity of Donny Brasco, a jewel broker who spends two years workingn his way into the confidence of Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino.)The best overall strength of this fine film is it's honesty in de-glamorizing mob life and showing the wise guys as struggling to earn, not having a fun-fun-fun crime spree.  Brutal murders and the equally brutal economy of late 70's NYC seem to compliment each other.BRASCO also has a touching soundtrack and interesting cinematography, which often mimics surveillance camera work.But the best element of this fine film is Al Pacino's role.  He turns Lefty, a mob soldier who has killed over two dozen men, into a rather sad and totally sympathetic character.

I found it to be an excellent, well-acted, well-directed, and well-scripted examination of lower level organized crime.  The people we see are criminals and they do bad things.  Some of the things they do are quite upsetting.  However, some of the things they do seem so minor to what we expect that it helps underscore the occassional triviality of small-time crime.  There's a scene, for example, in which a number of crooks spend a lot of time trying to break open parking meters to get at the change inside.  I enjoyed the way the movie attempted to understate the level of criminality while reminding us periodically that these are still bad guys ready to step across whatever line we might have been willing to draw in the sand.The focus of the movie is a crook called Lefty and played excellently by Al Pacino.  Lefty happens to meet an undercover cop and, after a cooperative effort, brings him into the fold.  We get the sense that we are witnessing a lot of real life events which is only natural since this is based on a true story by Joseph Pistone.  Lefty and Donnie Brasco, the undercover cop, spend their time doing what small time wise guys do.  It isn't glamorous but it is filmed in a way that makes it interesting.  In the end, we feel sorry for Lefty.  He had a chance to get out and realize his dream.  However, dead end or not, he stayed with the only life he understood and he understood it to the very end.I'm sure I wouldn't want to meet any of the characters shown in this movie.

6117,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0767802551,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[0, 0]","Under organized crime, the weak suffered while the corrupt prospered - but in ""Donnie Brasco"" we see another group entirely: the middle-group of middling gangsters utterly demoralized by the crushing pressures of the other two.  Joe Pistone (Depp) infiltrates local mafia under the name Donnie Brasco.  His lead to organized crime is an aging and fading enforcer named Ben ""Lefty"" Ruggiero played by Pacino.  Ruggiero is an odd choice for Pistone, because the feeble killer is himself one step away from being ""whacked"" by his boss, Sonny Black (Madsen).  Black's crew is decidedly small-time, but ambitious, and Pistone/Brasco thinks it's the perfect vehicle with which to launch his infiltration of organized crime.  Thus, the story links Brasco's assimilation into the mafia with Black's ambitions to rise in the ranks of gangsters.  Entering Black's circle with help from Lefty, Pistone/Brasco allows he older gangster to become his mentor, even as Lefty is obviously on his way out.  In fact, Pistone so gamely hunts the Mafia that he becomes less concerned with his own safety than the successes of Black's crew.  ""Brasco"" the movie is actually a stand-out movie - complimenting ""Goodfellas"" in its depiction of middle-level criminals who hold themselves as lords of their own domain but are otherwise ants below the real bosses.

Two of Hollywood's great character actors go at it head to head in a life of syndicate crime in the big city, - Al Pacino and Johnny Depp give outstanding performances as Lefty Ruggiero(Pacino) and Joe Pistone (Depp). Pistone's wife is played out brilliantly by Anne Heche, with a fine surrounding supporting cast. The film gives the viewer a realistic idea what it takes to survive in the mob and as a law enforcer playing on the inside of a soldier's deadly game. The real Joe Pistone was so caught up and involved with the mafia, the agent was hesitant to leave, of course now there's a big price on his head.

That has been written by just about everyone else on Amazon so I will focus solely upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray.I do have the SD DVD but when I saw that there was an extended version on Blu Ray I made the purchase.  However, this is not a side by side comparison between the Blu Ray and the Standard Def DVDs.VIDEO...The standard def version of the film was the theatrical release.  Unfortunately, the film on DVD was marred by considerable grain and noise and the muted colors actually looked smeared.  This Blu Ray version is considerably better on all levels.  The slightly muted colors still have a great contrast and color correction creates realistic appearances and skin tones.  Details can be nicely seen even within the black leather jackets the mobsters all seemed to wear. At the same time, you can see that the editors did not take things too far by crushing the blacks and losing these details.  At no point did I see any distracting grain or artifacts of any kind.  Bit Rate appeared to average between the mid twenties and low thirties.  To be honest, except for one scene, I barely noticed the addition of previously deleted scenes.AUDIO...The lossless PCM 5.1 audio presents a clear and transparent sound stage.  While is this a largely dialogue driven film so you can expect most of your audio to be coming from your center speaker,  the front sides do contribute to the infrequent panning of cars.  The rear sound stage's audio is kept pretty low so don't expect much from them other than ambience which will probably go un-noticed.  Your LFE channel will be able to take a rest as there is almost no bottom end to any of the audio.  Audio levels were properly set so you will not have to play roller coaster with your remotes volume control.Extras included the same extras that I had had on the Standard Def version.  Trailers were also included as usual and the not very creative menu was easy to navigate.  All in all, if 'Donnie Brasco' is the movie for you than, by all means, go for the Blu Ray version. The transfer is really quite clean.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.",4,Donnie Brasco on Blu Ray,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,2420,"['summary', 'character', 'analyzation', 'storylines', 'here', 'been', 'written', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'Amazon', 'will', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfer', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray.I', 'do', 'have', 'SD', 'DVD', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'extended', 'version', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'made', 'purchase', 'However', 'not', 'side', 'side', 'comparison', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVDs.VIDEO', 'standard', 'def', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'DVD', 'was', 'marred', 'considerable', 'grain', 'noise', 'muted', 'colors', 'actually', 'looked', 'smeared', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'considerably', 'better', 'levels', 'slightly', 'muted', 'colors', 'still', 'have', 'great', 'contrast', 'color', 'correction', 'realistic', 'appearances', 'skin', 'tones', 'Details', 'can', 'be', 'nicely', 'seen', 'even', 'black', 'leather', 'mobsters', 'seemed', 'wear', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'editors', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'things', 'too', 'far', 'crushing', 'blacks', 'losing', 'details', 'point', 'did', 'see', 'distracting', 'grain', 'artifacts', 'kind', 'Bit', 'Rate', 'appeared', 'average', 'mid', 'twenties', 'low', 'thirties', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'scene', 'barely', 'noticed', 'addition', 'previously', 'deleted', 'scenes.AUDIO', 'lossless', 'PCM', '5.1', 'audio', 'clear', 'transparent', 'sound', 'stage', 'largely', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'film', 'can', 'expect', 'most', 'audio', 'be', 'coming', 'center', 'speaker', 'front', 'sides', 'do', 'contribute', 'infrequent', 'panning', 'cars', 'rear', 'sound', 'stage', 'audio', 'kept', 'pretty', 'low', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'other', 'ambience', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'un-noticed', 'LFE', 'channel', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'rest', 'almost', 'bottom', 'end', 'audio', 'Audio', 'levels', 'were', 'properly', 'set', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'play', 'roller', 'coaster', 'remotes', 'volume', 'control.Extras', 'included', 'same', 'extras', 'had', 'had', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'Trailers', 'were', 'also', 'included', 'usual', 'not', 'very', 'creative', 'menu', 'was', 'easy', 'navigate', ""'Donnie"", 'Brasco', 'movie', 'means', 'go', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'transfer', 'really', 'quite', 'clean.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'audio', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'type', 'review.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

Based on the book by Joseph Pistone.Starring Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, Paul Giamatti and Michael Marsden.An okay, but marred by its searing obscene language and graphic gore and violence, attempt to get in on the GOODFELLAS and THE SOPRANOS gravy train that should please fans of those efforts. Based on a true story and with some good performances, the film never really did much for this viewer. The characters are so brutal and low level that there is never any sense of importance to the procedings. It all came across as some petty gang of lowbrow neanderthals just sitting around cursing and occaisionally killing each other. Sort of a MARTY with guns. Glad they were put in jail but Carlo Gambino and Carmine Galante they were not. The film is also surprisingly factually inaccurate in a high preponderance of the particulars.

Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an excellent FBI agent who goes undercover in the 1970s New York mob as diamond salesman Donnie Brasco. His lead man is Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), an aging and somewhat of a lowlife gangster who sees his chance for redemption in ""Donnie"". Pistone's wife, Maggie (Ann Heche) doesn't know much about her husband's career and soon their marriage begins to get rocky as he spends more and more time undercover, eventually seemingly one of the mafia's own. Also playing a central role in the story is Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), an up and coming gangster who seems to be getting more respect than Lefty. As the plot develops, Pistone loses himself in the role of Brasco and forms a true bond with Lefty. To his knowledge, and to the knowledge of his fellow mafia members Donnie is a trustworthy gentleman, and the friendship between Lefty and Donnie only increases. Lefty is clearly a degenerate, he constantly mumbles and complains about the poor treatment he gets from mafia chieftain Sonny Red (Robert Maino), and also is constantly asking people for money. He forms a true friendship with Donnie as he tries to gain some altitude back, and as he sees Black getting higher and higher than he does. Soon, the situation begins to escalate as the FBI begins to close in on Pistone's case, and Pistone must make a difficult decision about what he should do with Lefty, whom he has formed the true bond with.Paul Attanasiano (""Quiz Kids"") based his screenplay on the novel of the same name by the real life Pistone and Richard Wooley. While the novel is a clear autobiography of sorts, the film has no narration. Instead the narrative is made clear by Attanasiano's script as he blends the life of Pistone and of Brasco, two separate characters who eventually become one. His screenplay is dynamite. Many mafia films showcase tough guy dialog, but in the instance of ""Donnie Brasco"" this dialogue serves a higher purpose. The conversations and the actions between Lefty and Donnie form a true relationship, despite their opposite professions. There are also some magnetic scenes of drama and brutal violence, especially at a Japanese bar when Donnie doesn't want to take his shoe off. While some background characters may seem like the typical mafia lowlifes, the simple characterization of Lefty and Donnie is pure magic. Director Mike Newell, who's previous list of credits include the comedy ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" brings appropriate direction to the film. This film is not necessarily about the mafia at a certain time like ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Godfather"" is, but rather more of a relationship film, showing the way two men come together despite their circumstances. Also very worthy of mention is talented composer Patrick Doyle's musical score, which adds to the emotional effect of many scenes. The performances by Pacino and Depp, as usual, are fantastic. Pacino is given a real chance to shine as the aging Lefty, a man unlike his charismatic character in ""The Godfather"" series. Depp once again displays his ability to simply submerge himself completely in a role, and as an added bonus the character acts, adding on layers.  The fresh screenplay, strong acting, and sharp direction make it very worthy of mention and, while it at times gets too slow, or the story sometimes loses focus, it still is a very worthy film of watching.",4,Donnie Brasco (1997),1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,3902,"['Director', 'Mike', 'NewellCast', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'James', 'Russo', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Zeljko', 'Ivanek', 'Gerry', 'Becker', 'Robert', 'Miano.Running', 'Time', '127', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'strong', 'graphic', 'violence', 'pervasive', 'strong', 'language', 'brief', 'nudity', 'sexualityWhile', 'early', 'mid', '90', 'had', 'slew', 'mafia', 'films', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'out', 'rich', 'screenplay', 'strong', 'performances', 'Brasco', 'good', 'film', 'ultimately', 'more', 'friendship', 'two', 'people', 'rather', 'mafia', 'Joseph', 'D.', 'Pistone', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'excellent', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'undercover', '1970s', 'New', 'York', 'mob', 'diamond', 'salesman', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'lead', 'man', 'Lefty', 'Ruggiero', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'aging', 'somewhat', 'lowlife', 'gangster', 'who', 'chance', 'redemption', 'Donnie', 'Pistone', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Ann', 'Heche', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'husband', 'career', 'soon', 'marriage', 'get', 'rocky', 'more', 'more', 'time', 'undercover', 'eventually', 'seemingly', 'one', 'mafia', 'own', 'Also', 'playing', 'central', 'role', 'story', 'Sonny', 'Black', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'up', 'coming', 'gangster', 'who', 'be', 'getting', 'more', 'respect', 'Lefty', 'plot', 'Pistone', 'role', 'Brasco', 'true', 'bond', 'Lefty', 'knowledge', 'knowledge', 'fellow', 'mafia', 'members', 'Donnie', 'trustworthy', 'gentleman', 'friendship', 'Lefty', 'Donnie', 'only', 'Lefty', 'clearly', 'degenerate', 'constantly', 'poor', 'treatment', 'mafia', 'chieftain', 'Sonny', 'Red', 'Robert', 'Maino', 'also', 'constantly', 'asking', 'people', 'money', 'true', 'friendship', 'Donnie', 'gain', 'altitude', 'back', 'Black', 'getting', 'higher', 'higher', 'Soon', 'situation', 'escalate', 'FBI', 'close', 'Pistone', 'case', 'Pistone', 'must', 'make', 'difficult', 'decision', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'Lefty', 'whom', 'formed', 'true', 'bond', 'with.Paul', 'Attanasiano', 'Quiz', 'Kids', 'based', 'screenplay', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'real', 'life', 'Pistone', 'Richard', 'Wooley', 'novel', 'clear', 'autobiography', 'sorts', 'film', 'narration', 'Instead', 'narrative', 'made', 'clear', 'Attanasiano', 'script', 'life', 'Pistone', 'Brasco', 'two', 'separate', 'characters', 'who', 'eventually', 'become', 'one', 'screenplay', 'dynamite', 'Many', 'mafia', 'films', 'showcase', 'tough', 'guy', 'dialog', 'instance', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'dialogue', 'higher', 'purpose', 'conversations', 'actions', 'Lefty', 'Donnie', 'form', 'true', 'relationship', 'opposite', 'professions', 'are', 'also', 'magnetic', 'scenes', 'drama', 'brutal', 'violence', 'especially', 'Japanese', 'bar', 'when', 'Donnie', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'shoe', 'off', 'background', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', 'typical', 'mafia', 'lowlifes', 'simple', 'characterization', 'Lefty', 'Donnie', 'pure', 'magic', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'who', 'previous', 'list', 'credits', 'include', 'comedy', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'appropriate', 'direction', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mafia', 'certain', 'time', 'Goodfellas', 'Godfather', 'rather', 'more', 'relationship', 'film', 'showing', 'way', 'two', 'men', 'come', 'together', 'circumstances', 'Also', 'very', 'worthy', 'mention', 'talented', 'composer', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'musical', 'score', 'emotional', 'effect', 'many', 'scenes', 'performances', 'Pacino', 'Depp', 'usual', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Pacino', 'given', 'real', 'chance', 'shine', 'aging', 'Lefty', 'man', 'charismatic', 'character', 'Godfather', 'series', 'Depp', 'once', 'again', 'displays', 'ability', 'simply', 'submerge', 'completely', 'role', 'added', 'bonus', 'character', 'adding', 'layers', 'fresh', 'screenplay', 'strong', 'acting', 'sharp', 'direction', 'make', 'very', 'worthy', 'mention', 'times', 'too', 'slow', 'story', 'sometimes', 'focus', 'still', 'very', 'worthy', 'film', 'watching']",N/A

6142,A2NK7K9DLLSBMC,0767802551,T.R. Hammer,"[1, 6]","Other critics have said this is nothing compared to Goodfellas. This is the worst mafia movie from the modern era I've seen. Casting Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone in The Godfather, in this film may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but he's so lame compared to Corleone! The Godfather is considered the best or one of the best movies of all time (according to online votes at imdb.com). It's the gold standard of mafia movies. Making Pacino the lead character for DB raises your expectations, but they aren't fulfilled, unfortunately.Donnie Brasco is very uneven. The start is very slow and very weak. I'd rate the first half of the movie two stars and the last half three to four stars. The first half hour is slow and boring; it felt like a homemade movie. The way it was so easy for Donnie Brasco to get accepted by Pacino's character was silly. It wasn't even accurate to the history, apparently. So why did the screenwriter change the story to make it so much less credible, and far worse. Brasco spots a fake diamond and sort of beats up a guy. Let's make him part of our inner mob circle.Through a good portion of the film, the mobsters seem more like a lame street gang than major mafia criminals. They are clowns. Later on, however, it gets really nasty and graphic with lots of blood and nasty visuals.A glaring weakness and mistake in Donnie Brasco was how poorly it conveyed the importance of Brasco's work. At the end with the credits they tell us that Brasco was responsible for 200 indictments and 100 convictions and still has a $500,000 price on his head. Until then it seemed more like he'd taken down a few people in a little street gang of mafia wannabes.The screenwriting was very disappointing. Paul Attanasio screwed it up. How somebody who'd written police drama for many years could f this up is unbelievable. The producers made the mistake of choosing a screenwriter whose experience was crime tv, not crime movies. This movie could have been so much better. Hopefully it will be remade one day by people who know what they are doing. A true story like Donnie Brasco deserves a five-star movie.

The entire cast is as solid as Goodfellas ... or any other movie for that matter. Initially I held off from buying the Blu-Ray because I wasn't sure if the film stock of '97 would have all of the detail that high-def reveals, but this transfer is excellent. The few scenes that seem kind of soft are outweighed by the 99% of beautiful footage. I especially enjoyed the extra scenes added back into the film. I remember the theatrical release seemed to skim over Donnie's home life because there was so much story to tell about him infiltrating the mob. Now I see they actually had tons of footage of his marriage with Anne Heche's character. Normally extended versions have stuff that you think could have remained on the cutting room floor. In this case, every bit of it belonged back in the film. I regret that I didn't get to see all of that footage on the big screen, but now a high def at home is like having the big screen at your house.
