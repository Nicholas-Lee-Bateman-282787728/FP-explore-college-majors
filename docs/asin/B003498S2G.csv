The actors showed the raw emotions of just what it feels like to confront truth and reconciliation.  A young man, teenager of 17, killed a man in cold blood during the Protestant and Catholic fighting.  (so similar to the Palestines and Israelis). The reconciliation was meeting the man who was the young brother of the man who was killed.  This brother saw it all unfold, he witnessed it. His mother kept yelling, as an emotional reaction, why didn't you stop him, when he was just a boy, playing with a ball, and having no idea what was going to happen. His parents died shortly after. He apparently had no time to reconcile with them and thus carried the constant torment of why as if he was supposed to have an answer. This is a must-see movie.  Reconciliation is achieved, and it was clearly because of two things:  1) Deep remorse by the man who killed, for being part of a gang and doing what he thought was social justice, and 2) Choice of the man, who was the young brother, to forgive.",5,Forgiving the Remorseful (which reflects one way for Truth and Reconciliation),1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,1097,"['film', 'had', 'many', 'layers', 'often', 'case', 'when', 'acting', 'production', 'story', 'are', 'superb', 'actors', 'showed', 'raw', 'emotions', 'just', 'what', 'confront', 'truth', 'reconciliation', 'young', 'man', 'teenager', '17', 'killed', 'man', 'cold', 'blood', 'Protestant', 'Catholic', 'fighting', 'so', 'similar', 'Palestines', 'Israelis', 'reconciliation', 'was', 'meeting', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'young', 'brother', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'brother', 'saw', 'unfold', 'witnessed', 'mother', 'kept', 'yelling', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'boy', 'playing', 'ball', 'having', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'parents', 'died', 'shortly', 'apparently', 'had', 'time', 'reconcile', 'thus', 'carried', 'constant', 'torment', 'why', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'answer', 'must-see', 'movie', 'Reconciliation', 'achieved', 'was', 'clearly', 'two', 'things', '1', 'Deep', 'remorse', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'being', 'part', 'gang', 'doing', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'social', 'justice', '2', 'Choice', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'young', 'brother', 'forgive']",N/A

Teen-age Protestant Alistair Little shoots and kills a teen-age Catholic young man, in sight of his younger brother. The brother suffers horrible abuse from his mother, who keeps yelling that ""you could have stopped it,"" while she is pummeling him.Fast forward ---Little eventually gets out of jail and the young brother grows into a troubled adulthood.Enter personal TV, and the two are pitted to confront each other on a kind of reality show.Enough said.

E Jackson,"[3, 12]","The storyline in Five Minutes to Heaven involves a group of Irish teens whe ride around in a car and shoot someone (in a REALLY graphic way- expect realism and lots of blood).  I never could understand why this particular person was targeted- the Irish accents by the teenagers was really strong so if they DID explain it, I couldn't understand them.This is one extremely small part of the storyline that leads to a MUCH lengthier chapter later on.  Needless to say, this portion of the film is *significantly* more interesting than the second half of the movie.*Now* the storyline is set 33 years later when everybody is an adult, and now the story shifts into an *extremely* long build-up between the murderer (the gunman himself) and the younger brother of the murdered man (who was just a kid at the time, outside playing kick ball when the whole shooting incident occurred).  The two finally get to meet each other 33 years later.The problem?  *The entire movie* is about the build-up between the two men.  You see, they're BOTH inside the same castle but they're both in separate rooms.  They both struggle to come to terms with what happened that dreaded night over 30 years ago.  So they stay inside their castle rooms and contemplate how to handle the situation.  They pace back and forth wondering how they'll conduct themselves when they finally meet.  It lasts an *eternity* and it eventually reaches a point of boredom.However, I did like the film because it *did* feel like it was going somewhere for a while- the movie writers just stretched out this particular scene for WAY too long.  Also, I thought it was rather strange that the mother blamed the younger brother for her sons death.  Are you kidding me?  Blaming a kid who wouldn't have been able to do anything about it anyway since not only did he not have a gun, but he'd be forced to defend himself against FOUR teenagers much older than he was?

Alistair was a bored young man that felt Ireland should accept union with Great Britain & was ready to both retaliate for the actions of the IRA & to make his mark & win the respect of his superiors in the UVF in one act.You then flash forward 33 years, years in which Joe has suffered the loss of his brother, mother, father & other things. Alistair has meanwhile become a noted speaker for reconciliation between divided humanity of all kinds. He is approached by a documentary production team & asked to mediate his own separation from Joe Griffin on camera. Greatly regretting his past, he agrees to do so.The body of this movie, which is based on a true life incident, revolves around Alistair's & Joe's trying to come to grips with the past & discover what the future may hold. It is great performances that make this movie compelling along with the powerful story. You can forget there being much action license taken with this story. It's presented in a very straightforward & believable manner. Despite a great portrayal by Liam Neeson it's James Nesbitt's performance that stands out above the rest. I found it to be a very absorbing & enjoyable movie to watch. 5 Amazon Stars.",5,Where's the gate to Heaven?,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,1396,"['5', 'MINUTES', 'HEAVENThis', 'movie', 'set', 'Ireland', 'Troubles', 'Alistair', 'Little', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Ulster', 'Volunteer', 'Force', 'UVF', 'killed', 'Joe', 'Griffin', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'brother', 'when', 'were', 'teens', 'Alistair', 'was', 'bored', 'young', 'man', 'felt', 'Ireland', 'should', 'accept', 'union', 'Great', 'Britain', 'was', 'ready', 'retaliate', 'actions', 'IRA', 'make', 'mark', 'win', 'respect', 'superiors', 'UVF', 'one', 'act.You', 'then', 'forward', '33', 'years', 'years', 'Joe', 'suffered', 'loss', 'brother', 'mother', 'father', 'other', 'things', 'Alistair', 'meanwhile', 'become', 'noted', 'speaker', 'reconciliation', 'divided', 'humanity', 'kinds', 'approached', 'documentary', 'production', 'team', 'asked', 'mediate', 'own', 'separation', 'Joe', 'Griffin', 'camera', 'Greatly', 'regretting', 'past', 'do', 'so.The', 'body', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'incident', 'Alistair', 'Joe', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'past', 'discover', 'what', 'future', 'may', 'hold', 'great', 'performances', 'make', 'movie', 'compelling', 'along', 'powerful', 'story', 'can', 'forget', 'there', 'being', 'much', 'action', 'license', 'taken', 'story', 'presented', 'very', 'straightforward', 'believable', 'manner', 'great', 'portrayal', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'performance', 'out', 'rest', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'absorbing', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch', '5', 'Amazon', 'Stars']",N/A

Nearly four thousand people died. This film is about this conflict; the introduction states it's a ""fiction inspired by two men who bear the legacy of one of these killings.""The key event is the murder of a young Catholic man by a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force, a Protestant, pro-British group. There was ""nothing personal"" about the murder; it was part of ""The Troubles."" The killer was only fifteen when he joined the UVF. Thirty-three years later a film production team sets up a meeting between the killer (who served twelve years in prison) and the victim's brother. The brother was about twelve when he witnessed the murder and narrowly escaped death himself.To say much more would be to spoil this outstanding film. Liam Neeson is solid as the adult killer. James Nesbit is excellent as the jittery, weak-willed, revenge-hungry adult brother. Anamaria Marinca almost steals the show in a small role as a gofer for the film production team to whom the brother confides his true feelings.I must say this film may not be for everyone. Sometimes the pacing is very slow. Viewers may have a hard time accepting that the killer is projected as a stronger character than the victim's brother.

It seems like everyone else was just pulled off the street. Maybe they only had the budget for one actor? Some scenery was shown, but other than the kid kicking the ball, it didn't show much of the N. Ireland culture. Was this based on a real story? I lived just North of Belfast when it was really bad, and even then the violence was limited to a small area within Belfast, and the border (of N. Ireland and the Republic). This town is too far South of Belfast, and nowhere near the border. It was like a warzone? I find that hard to believe. The English were the real terrorists there. Those 'tanks' in front of the shooters' car? Those weren't soldiers; they were police 'cars'. A regular police station in N. Ireland looked like a high security prision. On the streets, they drove those tanks and carried automatic weapons. The British police wouldn't have let it become a 'warzone'. Psychologically, it doesn't make sense either. They each find closure, but I don't see how. According to the film, the kid wasn't traumatized by his brother's shooting - at all. He was upset about the abuse of his mother. In the end, you find that Joe is the real killer. He was never upset about his brother's shooting, he has no hesitation about the morality of killing Liam's character, and he has no remorse afterward.

1321075,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B003498S2G,FYI,"[2, 2]","This award-winning British/Irish collaboration, based on a a true story, demands attention. The best narratives deftly touch on the specific with intense focus, yet transcend to larger spheres of relevance, beyond the immediate subject's boundaries. Guy Hibbert's incisive script is masterfully brought to life with Oliver Hirschbiegel's direction, and a superb cast that includes James Nesbitt and Liam Neeson. Although the subject matter is quite different, I'm put in mind of another remarkable film, Jim Sheridan'sIn America, where a vagabond Irish family lands in New York City and confronts profound issues in harrowing circumstances. ""Five Minutes of Heaven"" was filmed on location in Belfast; its fraught sociopolitical landscape is a crucial aspect of the narrative.Does forgiveness condone and enable, or free the suffering? Much depends on whether the perpetrator is truly sorry, deeply repentant, while some acts are beyond us and our capacity to forgive. Thirty-three years after the murder of James Griffin (a Catholic), his killer, Alistair Little (Liam Neeson), lives in a sleek contemporary loft as austere as a self-imposed prison. Little was 17 in 1975, during the Northern Irish Troubles, at the time of the killing. He was a member of a loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) cell. Subsequently, Little was arrested and sentenced to prison for 12 years in Maze Prison. In the intervening years, he has worked to redeem himself by renouncing violence and helping others find healing through the Forgiveness Project.When Alistair Little's gang attacked James Griffin, a little 8-year old boy was outside on the street, practicing bouncing a soccer ball against the wall, an image that flashbacks through the film. It's young Joe Griffin, who watches in helpless horror as the shocking events unfold. Joe's mum (Paula McFetridge) blames her young son; to say he suffers from survivor's guilt is an understatement. His soul is frozen in time. Joe Griffin (James Nesbitt) may have become an adult with a wife and two daughters, but he is back in 1975, reliving the horror over and over again. Compared to the well-off Alistair Little, he lives in far humbler circumstances, haunted by his brother's death. In the film, a television show reunites Little and Griffin, with superb sequences of Nesbitt's Griffin coming undone in the taxi cab on the way to the meeting-site, and coping with the show's producers. Griffin dialogue burns, his anger is palatable, and Nesbitt is perfection; gifted with intensity as in hisJekyllandMurphy's Law: Series One. Anyone with PTSD, who has survived brutality, can deeply understand the duality of Joe Griffin's life.In real life, Little and Griffin have never met. For this film, screenwriter Guy Hibbert imagined what would happen if a television show attempted to reunite them. Hibbert asked Griffin and Little what would happen if they met: ""Joe said he would pull a knife, and Alistair said he would try not to defend himself."" With the Forgiveness Project, Little states that, ""I don't think I have a right to ask for forgiveness. It only adds insult to injury and places yet another burden upon relatives and family members."" Nesbitt and Neeson are both superb inhabiting these tormented characters.The conclusion of the film profoundly portrays complex inner narrative and change. After meeting up and fighting in the house where the murder took place, Little tells Griffin, ""Get rid of me."" This isn't about trite forgiveness, but how Griffin must finally free himself from being trapped by the dreadful actions of others. Griffin attends group therapy where he breaks down in tears, realizing he simply seeks to be a good father to his daughters. Griffin then calls Little on his cell phone to inform him that, ""We're finished."" On the sidewalk, Alistair Little sinks to his knees, grocery bags and all, surrounded by passerby who have no idea what is transpiring,  grateful that Joe Griffin can finally love and live a life less bound by pain and simply be, without Little haunting and limiting him.",5,Tough and Transcendent,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,4060,"['award-winning', 'British/Irish', 'collaboration', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'attention', 'best', 'narratives', 'deftly', 'touch', 'specific', 'intense', 'focus', 'yet', 'transcend', 'larger', 'spheres', 'relevance', 'immediate', 'subject', 'boundaries', 'Guy', 'Hibbert', 'incisive', 'script', 'masterfully', 'brought', 'life', 'Oliver', 'Hirschbiegel', 'direction', 'superb', 'cast', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'subject', 'matter', 'quite', 'different', ""'m"", 'put', 'mind', 'remarkable', 'film', 'Jim', ""Sheridan'sIn"", 'America', 'where', 'vagabond', 'Irish', 'family', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'confronts', 'profound', 'issues', 'harrowing', 'circumstances', 'Five', 'Minutes', 'Heaven', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Belfast', 'fraught', 'sociopolitical', 'landscape', 'crucial', 'aspect', 'narrative.Does', 'forgiveness', 'condone', 'enable', 'free', 'suffering', 'Much', 'perpetrator', 'truly', 'sorry', 'deeply', 'repentant', 'acts', 'are', 'capacity', 'forgive', 'Thirty-three', 'years', 'murder', 'James', 'Griffin', 'Catholic', 'killer', 'Alistair', 'Little', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'sleek', 'contemporary', 'loft', 'as', 'austere', 'self-imposed', 'prison', 'Little', 'was', '17', '1975', 'Northern', 'Irish', 'Troubles', 'time', 'killing', 'was', 'member', 'loyalist', 'Ulster', 'Volunteer', 'Force', 'UVF', 'cell', 'Subsequently', 'Little', 'was', 'arrested', 'sentenced', 'prison', '12', 'years', 'Maze', 'Prison', 'intervening', 'years', 'worked', 'redeem', 'renouncing', 'violence', 'helping', 'others', 'find', 'healing', 'Forgiveness', 'Project.When', 'Alistair', 'Little', 'gang', 'attacked', 'James', 'Griffin', 'little', '8-year', 'old', 'boy', 'was', 'outside', 'street', 'practicing', 'bouncing', 'soccer', 'ball', 'wall', 'image', 'film', 'young', 'Joe', 'Griffin', 'who', 'helpless', 'horror', 'shocking', 'events', 'unfold', 'Joe', 'mum', 'Paula', 'McFetridge', 'young', 'son', 'say', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'understatement', 'soul', 'frozen', 'time', 'Joe', 'Griffin', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'adult', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'back', '1975', 'reliving', 'horror', 'over', 'again', 'Compared', 'well-off', 'Alistair', 'Little', 'far', 'humbler', 'circumstances', 'haunted', 'brother', 'death', 'film', 'television', 'show', 'Little', 'Griffin', 'superb', 'sequences', 'Nesbitt', 'Griffin', 'coming', 'undone', 'taxi', 'cab', 'way', 'meeting-site', 'coping', 'show', 'producers', 'Griffin', 'dialogue', 'burns', 'anger', 'palatable', 'Nesbitt', 'perfection', 'gifted', 'intensity', 'hisJekyllandMurphy', 'Law', 'Series', 'One', 'Anyone', 'PTSD', 'who', 'survived', 'brutality', 'can', 'deeply', 'understand', 'duality', 'Joe', 'Griffin', 'life.In', 'real', 'life', 'Little', 'Griffin', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'Guy', 'Hibbert', 'imagined', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'television', 'show', 'attempted', 'reunite', 'Hibbert', 'asked', 'Griffin', 'Little', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'met', 'Joe', 'said', 'would', 'pull', 'knife', 'Alistair', 'said', 'would', 'try', 'not', 'defend', 'Forgiveness', 'Project', 'Little', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'right', 'ask', 'forgiveness', 'only', 'insult', 'injury', 'places', 'yet', 'burden', 'upon', 'relatives', 'family', 'members', 'Nesbitt', 'Neeson', 'are', 'superb', 'inhabiting', 'tormented', 'characters.The', 'conclusion', 'film', 'profoundly', 'complex', 'inner', 'narrative', 'change', 'meeting', 'up', 'fighting', 'house', 'where', 'murder', 'took', 'place', 'Little', 'Griffin', 'Get', 'rid', ""n't"", 'trite', 'forgiveness', 'how', 'Griffin', 'must', 'finally', 'free', 'being', 'trapped', 'dreadful', 'actions', 'others', 'Griffin', 'group', 'therapy', 'where', 'down', 'tears', 'realizing', 'simply', 'be', 'good', 'father', 'daughters', 'Griffin', 'then', 'Little', 'cell', 'phone', 'inform', ""'re"", 'finished', 'sidewalk', 'Alistair', 'Little', 'knees', 'grocery', 'bags', 'surrounded', 'passerby', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'transpiring', 'grateful', 'Joe', 'Griffin', 'can', 'finally', 'love', 'live', 'life', 'less', 'bound', 'pain', 'simply', 'be', 'Little', 'haunting', 'limiting']",N/A

My five minutes of heaven!'And so runs the razor sharp dialog and acting and power of this little film from the UK that relates the story of a 1975 event in Northern Ireland when Catholics and Protestants were at war and the young Protestant Alistair Little (Mark David), as a UVF member (Ulster Volunteer Force), gathers his friends and 'kills a Catholic' - but the murder happens in front of the victim's 11-year-old brother Joe Griffen.  Flash forward to 2008 when Alistair Little (now Liam Neeson) has served his prison term and is set up by the media to relate the story of the incident and supposedly meet and shake hands on camera with the now mature Joe Griffen.  It is a film about youthful involvement in terrorism and the sequelae that haunts or obsesses the victim's family and the perpetrator.  The confrontation between Alistair and Joe is a devastating one.Guy Hibbert wrote this excruciatingly visceral screenplay and Oliver Hirschbiegel directs a first rate cast.  Though Liam Neeson is billed as the star, the film belongs to the powerful acting by James Nesbitt as the vengeful Joe Griffen.  The cinematography is dark and dank like the atmosphere in both the warring fog of 1975 and the attempt at reconciliation in 2008.  There are subtle pieces of thoughtful enhancement, such as the use of the Mozart 'Requiem' in the near hidden score.  In all, this is a moving film about truth and reconciliation that deserves the attention of us all, especially in this time of random acts of terrorism and their possible imprint on our minds and on society.

You will see life through the eyes of an 11 year old boy who watches his brother being murdered and then many years later is set up to confront the murderer.The real victim is this child and his family as his mother hates him because he did not do anything to stop the killing and his father dies 8 months later from a broken heart. Meanwhile here is Joe the 11 year old who now must grow up with the guilt of his brother's death, his mother's hate and dreams of revenge which consume his mind and make him not appreciate the new life and family he has built for himself.

There is a very deep moment in the movie where the murderer played masterfully by Liam Neeson explains it all ""there was nobody there to tell him what he was doing was wrong"" and he relates it to muslim terrorists of today that never hear in their mosques that the ""killing of innocent people is wrong for any cause"" and you essentially will not get paradise but a life of hell for yourself and all the families you have effected.

I respect how he dares to bring complexity and humanity to nearly every part he does. In this film, these qualities shine brilliantly. Very rarely--especially in modern films does a writer dare to admit or even suggest that the antagonist or 'baddie' is still Human. This film's writer not only suggests it but proves it powerfully via Neeson's superb performance.Both James and Liam give gripping performances as Little and Griffen. The characters are very credibly done, having emotional and mental wounds. This is not an action piece. For which, I'm very grateful. Instead, it's a drama that's intelligent and challenges the viewer's perceptions. A 'thinking person's' film, if you will. This type of film seems a dying breed so I'm grateful to have found it. Unlike in Taken, Liam's char isn't thirsting for revenge...he is in fact, a traumatized man searching diligently for healing and peace.Whereas Griffen is consumed by hate and pain and believes revenge will give him the satisfaction and solace he longs for. Very human but also very misguided. I don't think reconciliation actually occurred between Griffen and Little. Instead, I feel an understanding was finally truly achieved which demonstrated one man's change of heart and caused the other's. This film is about hope, healing, forgiveness, and redemption. Well executed and I'll happily own my copy within a few days!For the reviewer that was so impressed with Liam in Taken, may I suggest Michael Collins?

The dialog punches the audience with straight-forward narration, just in case the audience missed the points.So what were the main messages?- humans, especially teenagaers, are driven by many ignoble motivations- there are many second-order victims to any single crime- reconciliation heals both parties- trying to be a better person is better than being bitter",5,Greek Tragedy as a movie,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,1617,"['movie', 'very', 'good', 'images', 'not', 'only', 'atmosphere', 'environment', 'emotions', 'characters', 'teenager', 'who', 'driven', 'politics', 'times', 'wish', 'be', ""'admired"", 'child', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'implication', 'masked', 'gunman', 'bereaved', 'mother', 'who', 'child', 'child', 'who', '33', 'year', 'grudge', 'avenge', 'murder', 'brother', ""'earn"", 'love', 'dead', 'mother', 'are', 'real', 'human', 'feelings', 'drive', 'situation', 'seemed', 'inevitable.Western', 'drama', 'based', 'Greek', 'Tragedy', 'plots', 'pivot', 'inexorable', 'human', 'character', 'flaws', 'emotions', 'movie', 'heritage', 'well.However', 'Greek', 'Tragedies', 'were', 'formal', 'plays', 'actors', 'were', 'expected', 'RECITE', 'verbatim', 'fact', 'actors', 'Greek', 'Tragedies', 'wore', 'masks', 'movie', 'should', 'primarily', 'use', 'images', 'convey', 'story', 'movie', 'environment', 'emotions', 'characters', 'transition', 'attitudes', 'characters', 'bravo', 'Nesbitt', 'bravura', 'only', 'quibble', 'main', 'messages', 'were', 'too', 'clearly', 'narrated', 'words', 'chorus', 'Greek', 'Tragedies', 'narrated', 'explained', 'dog', 'body', 'character', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'served', 'chorus', 'felt', 'dialog', 'was', 'too', 'blatant', 'dialog', 'audience', 'straight-forward', 'narration', 'just', 'case', 'audience', 'missed', 'points.So', 'were', 'main', 'messages', 'humans', 'especially', 'teenagaers', 'are', 'driven', 'many', 'ignoble', 'motivations-', 'are', 'many', 'second-order', 'victims', 'single', 'crime-', 'reconciliation', 'heals', 'parties-', 'trying', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'better', 'being', 'bitter']",N/A

Parisi,"[0, 0]","The actors make the movie.Joe Griffin is a man whose childhood has so hollowed him out that he is not so much human as a series of uncomprehending responses. The word he most commonly uses is  ""Aye,"" signaling only recognition that someone has spoken but nothing more, not agreement, acceptance, or understanding. The thing he is actually speaking to is his own past. This is no dialogue, however, since the past won't change and he can't accommodate himself to it. Everything that happens in the present is an interruption of this endless back and forth. James Nesbitt's portrayal is all slouches, ticks, and a scattershot, desperate good cheer.Alistair Little, too, is stuck in the past, in his case because of remorse. Neeson's muted performance seems scripted because he's caught in a ritual of confession that does nothing to relieve his guilt. So his ""discussion"" with the past is no less empty than Griffin's. Where Griffin, however, is a series of startles and near-explosions, Neeson gives us a man stifled by his own act of youthful violence: the only words he can utter are self-recrimination. A killer of innocents, he wants to be confronted by a victim grown strong: his only salvation lies letting his living victim have the last word.Other things I liked about the movie: the scenes with the young Joe Griffin; the smarmy television producer and his feel-good b.s.; the drabness of Ulster then and now.Occasionally the director went overboard with the symbolism: he didn't need to work quite so hard to show that these two men are trapped in parallel dilemmas.So what?

It is genuine and touching, but it hits you like a business meeting and strong coffee.The first 15 minutes or so, you follow the main event, the preparation and deed that irreparably changed the lives of our main characters. It feels like nothing, but it is uncomfortable, eliciting a creeping silent protest from the viewer, as the youths commit the unthinkable.James Nesbitt's performance is remarkable. He so beautifully portrays 'Joe's' razor-edge sense of powerless rage it is hard to believe he is not really experiencing it. Liam Neeson's character 'Little', by contrast, is  a throbbing bundle of nerves. He has carefully transformed the shambles of living into philosophy, which tumbles from him easily, while he maintains. Liam Neeson played the complicated role strait, with finesse and depth. He gives himself no excuse, but offers no apologies for actions motivated by a broken construct.The reaction of Joe's mother to the death of her older son is transformative to her son's view of himself and the world around him. However, thankfully so, the writers have kindly given a more realistic progression of his well-being than the boob-box thrillers would have done.This is a great film. If you have ever enjoyed a foreign film or a descriptive narrative, you may enjoy this movie. It is introspective, without being slow. As a naturally paced thriller, it will capture your attention and endear you to the strength of the masculine and sympathetic feminine characters. This is cinema.

The political divide in Ireland runs as far as it does deep. Alistair and Joe each stand on opposing sides of that gaping chasm. Alistair killed Joe's brother, and for than man who's lost family, absolution simply isn't an option. I though this movie has more going for it that the current action flicks these days. Not a fast-paced moviie, nor a story that pretends to have all the answers regarding forgiveness, resolution, etc. But it is a facinating, amazingly performed study in the attempt of two men to come to terms with a horrific event that destroyed both of their lives.
