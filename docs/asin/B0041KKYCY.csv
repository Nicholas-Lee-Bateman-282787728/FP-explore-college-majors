1380319,A6PQ7RFSU38WR,B0041KKYCY,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","I watched this movie, being a huge fan of the original. I found it compelling and entertaining. Sarah Butler is very easy on the eyes. The revenge scenes are very inventive and the effects are pretty cool. It's a watchable movie, but I have some problems with this movie.1. You are asking too much from me, wanting me to sympathize with a group of rapists. There are parts in the movie where the filmmakers don't realize what they're doing and the sympathy factor is shifting away from her and going to the guys. For example: Why do they have to have a scene where she smokes a joint, then tells the sheriff that the GUYS are the ones who left it there? Why in the beginning when Johnny is harmlessly flirting with her, she comes off as a snarky smart-ass? (How's that line working out for you?)? Why don't they explain what happened to the sheriff's daughter? I HATE the sheriff in this movie, but I find myself actually feeling bad for HIM, because we don't know the fate of the innocent little girl. WTF?2. The point of a rape-revenge movie is to make a PRO-female movie, not an ANTI-female movie. Jennifer disappears from the movie for a long time and we are stuck with the guys and it turns into like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. We don't see the pain and horror Jennifer endured, like in the original. We see the guys and are spending time with them and they start coming off as decent guys who did one stupid thing, like how in I.K.W.Y.D.L.S., the kids are supposed to be good kids who did one stupid thing and are covering it up.3. Everyone complains about the LONG rape scene in the original, but trimming that section of the movie down, it comes off that the torture she inflicts on them is too much. One guy says he was raping her for 10 seconds, another said maybe 2 minutes, and she's out for most of it. Then look at the LONG, very gruesome torture she inflicts on the guys.4. Did she hide a credit card inside of her, or something? She comes back with a whole new wardrobe, a new car. Where did she get this stuff when the guys supposedly destroyed all her stuff? If they left something of hers behind, would it kill the filmmakers to add a scene of showing her finding it? Also, you have one guy videotaping the whole thing. She gets hold of the tape. Does she take the tape, get it to people she knows she can trust, get these guys and stick 'em in jail for a LONG time? Nope. She gives them back the tape and horribly kills these guys. Again, it's taking my sympathy away from her and turning it to the guys. Rape victims still don't have all the rights they should have, but they have FAR MORE than they did in 1978.To sum up: I am happy that the theme is still there: Rape is a terrible crime and if you rape a woman, you will pay consequences. It is there, but they complicated this movie too much and it shows just how much simpler the original is. Not a bad movie, but the original did a much better job making it's point than this one.",3,"Entertaining, but it's got quite a few problems.",1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,2963,"['watched', 'movie', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'found', 'compelling', 'entertaining', 'Sarah', 'Butler', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'revenge', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'inventive', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'watchable', 'movie', 'have', 'problems', 'movie.1', 'are', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'wanting', 'sympathize', 'group', 'rapists', 'are', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'sympathy', 'factor', 'shifting', 'away', 'going', 'guys', 'example', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'have', 'scene', 'where', 'joint', 'then', 'sheriff', 'GUYS', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'left', 'Why', 'beginning', 'when', 'Johnny', 'harmlessly', 'flirting', 'off', 'snarky', 'smart-ass', 'How', 'line', 'working', 'out', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'sheriff', 'daughter', 'HATE', 'sheriff', 'movie', 'find', 'actually', 'feeling', 'bad', 'HIM', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fate', 'innocent', 'little', 'girl', 'WTF', '2', 'point', 'rape-revenge', 'movie', 'make', 'PRO-female', 'movie', 'not', 'ANTI-female', 'movie', 'Jennifer', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'are', 'stuck', 'guys', 'KNOW', 'WHAT', 'YOU', 'DID', 'LAST', 'SUMMER', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'pain', 'horror', 'Jennifer', 'endured', 'original', 'see', 'guys', 'are', 'spending', 'time', 'start', 'coming', 'off', 'decent', 'guys', 'who', 'did', 'one', 'stupid', 'thing', 'how', 'I.K.W.Y.D.L.S.', 'kids', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'kids', 'who', 'did', 'one', 'stupid', 'thing', 'are', 'covering', 'up.3', 'Everyone', 'LONG', 'rape', 'scene', 'original', 'trimming', 'section', 'movie', 'down', 'torture', 'too', 'much', 'One', 'guy', 'was', 'raping', '10', 'seconds', 'said', 'maybe', '2', 'minutes', 'out', 'most', 'Then', 'look', 'LONG', 'very', 'gruesome', 'torture', 'guys.4', 'Did', 'hide', 'credit', 'card', 'something', 'back', 'whole', 'new', 'wardrobe', 'new', 'car', 'Where', 'did', 'get', 'stuff', 'when', 'guys', 'supposedly', 'destroyed', 'stuff', 'left', 'something', 'hers', 'would', 'kill', 'filmmakers', 'add', 'scene', 'showing', 'finding', 'Also', 'have', 'one', 'guy', 'videotaping', 'whole', 'thing', 'hold', 'tape', 'take', 'tape', 'get', 'people', 'can', 'trust', 'get', 'guys', 'stick', ""'em"", 'jail', 'LONG', 'time', 'Nope', 'back', 'tape', 'horribly', 'guys', 'Again', 'taking', 'sympathy', 'away', 'turning', 'guys', 'Rape', 'victims', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'rights', 'should', 'have', 'have', 'FAR', 'MORE', 'did', '1978.To', 'sum', 'am', 'happy', 'theme', 'still', 'Rape', 'terrible', 'crime', 'rape', 'woman', 'will', 'pay', 'consequences', 'there', 'complicated', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'simpler', 'original', 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'original', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'making', 'point', 'one']",N/A

With rape, as the main theme and many scenes of brutal violence, it would be a tough project to green light.  I watched this movie in my early teens. I was shocked then and after watching the remake, shocked again.Young writer (Sarah Butler, kudos to her to act in such a difficult role) rents a cabin in the woods to work on her second novel. The movie runs about 1 hour and 48 minutes and can be divided in to three segments, the first segment when the hunt is stalked, the actual hunt or the rape and finally when the hunters become the hunted.  The music is eerie and lends a scary atmosphere to the film. There is not a lot of nudity in the film contrary to what people may think not does this film glorify rape. The original had some moments which bordered on titillation but this one is a better version, in keeping up with times. The torture scenes or retribution scenes were too long in my opinion.

They do horrible things to her then try to kill her afterwards- After the whole ordeal, she ends up coming back to get revenge on them all in much more creative ways than the original did even.If you don't like horror or can't handle anything a little disturbing then I suggest you stay away from this one.I thought the acting was good, much better than the original. I liked the girl who played Jennifer and think she played a great victim but as far as the revenge part I think she could have been a tad meaner. As in, I didn't sense the true hate or vengeance in the victim- She was almost too sweet, even when she was doing the revenge. The acts weren't sweet, but her disposition and nature seemed to not convince me. At points it was a bit comical watching her play the bad part. But overall, it was good.I think it's better than the original and goes with the modern times without sucking like most remakes do.

'I spit on your grave' is one such film where you can't help but appreciate and applaud for excellent direction and good cast performances, infact the entire film moves on with a very genuinely spooky atmosphere throughout. Speaking of performances, Sarah Butler gives a brilliant one here, very real and very much into the shoes of the character she plays, her revenge scenes will surely blow you off, apart from that, it's her strong characterization that really grabs your entire attention. The rest of the cast does likewise well enough to give great support to Butler.

There wasnt much of a story, but thats ok, because it wasnt about backstory, is was about revenge. And if you ask me those sick bastards got off easy. I love seeing films where women come out on top, and do to men exactly what men do to them. I felt sorry for the mentally challenged Matthew, because I really didnt see what other option he had. I dont excuse doing crime out of fear, but he simply did not have the mentality to fight back. Still, he flipped out on her and she got even... I aint mad at her. I loved how she got that dude with the shotgun, I didnt want her to hurt the man's daughter, but it would have been nice if she had given him a play by play of someone doing to his child what he did to her. Like tell him that she dropped the girl off with a bunch of big hairy truckers and then let him die with that on his mind. That was just a mess, how one minute he was raping and beating that girl and then he was on a telephone call, talking about going to church. And then when she caught him, he had the nerve to call on Jesus. This was a great movie, I just wish she has tortured them more. I know I am sick, because she really did get even. But they were just wrong the way they messed with her. She should have ruined their names so that even in death they would be known at sick rapist, women beaters.  Another great scene is when she cut that man's weinner off and shoved it in his mouth. I was like WOAH, way to get even. She was pretty smart in the way she handled the situation.  I loved the scene with the crows eatting the dude's eyes, man that was a mess and when she made the man soak his head in lye-soap. That was just awsome. I want to see more movies like this.

I had seen the uncut original a few times over the years, just as well, as apparently the uncut version of it is also unknown in the UK, too. I was really prepared to be shocked, appalled and grossed out, but I wasn't. The performances were all good and Sarah Butler was actually better as Jennifer Hills than Camille Keaton was in the original film. As strange as it sounds I felt that there was quite a bit of humor that permeates the film. The rapists are mostly portrayed as bumbling clowns that begin to fall apart when it appears things are not going as they planned. The make-up effects are excellent and not as over-the-top as I expected. Surprisingly, some of the violence actually takes place off screen and you have to use to your imagination a bit, which makes it all the more effective. The rape scenes are brutal and justifiably uncomfortable to watch. They certainly set the stage for the payback that is to come and it is very hard not to root for Jennifer as she takes her revenge.

It's, basically, a tale of a writer who goes to a cabin in the woods to work on her second novel and three of the local men there decide that she's the perfect person to have a little fun with. Unfortunately, for them, that's their BIGGEST mistake...I have to admit, having seen the original whenever it came out, my expectations for this film were pretty high. The original was unflinching in its' depictions of depravity and, to this day, still gets the same reaction out of me when I watch it. I have a hard time sitting through it. It's incredibly uncomfortable to watch soley for the fact that it's like you're spectating and watching this happen & you're helpless to do anything about it.That being said, I went into this film thinking that it's going to have a hard time competing with the original yet, for the most part, the remake more than delivered even adding a few new things to the mix. I was impressed with Sarah Butler's performance as Jennifer Hills. You feel for this character and what she goes through and you cheer her on when she goes after the guys that do unspeakble things to her. Heck, I'm impressed with the cast as well. They play the most devilishly awful cast imaginable. I went away from this film satisfied in the fact that Stephen R.

I can't say I was thrilled at first when I hard the news although I had known it was just a matter of time before some schmuck saw reason to remake yet another cult film fave. I still was hellbent for election on seeing this film and even had hoped that I'd be able to catch it in the theaters. No such luck. I had to wait for DVD like everyone else but at least Walmart sells the standard DVD for $10 so who's complaining, right?If you've seen the original, you pretty much know what to expect here. If rape or brutality offends you, ISOYG isn't your movie. No other way to put it. This is not a Michael Bay film and I thank God for that. The film-makers here actually did their homework and delivered a very effective, if not powerful revenge flick which holds up well for repeated viewings and should satisfy most horror fans in the midst of things. Probability suggests I will grow to like this film even more with repeated viewings as there aren't any great horror films that I'm aware of anymore which are granted a major release.ISOYG is as brutal as they come but this is not an Eli Roth film as we have no sympathy for Jennifer Hill's victims. Well, maybe one. :-) Suffice to say, you are rooting for her all the way in the second half of the film as each lowlife is dispatched in the most gruesome fashion imaginable. Rest assured, she will have no mercy on any of them and will not back down until each one is punished severely.Definitely much more polished and professional than the seventies Grind house classic, the remake still manages to disturb it's viewer and doesn't let up. Whereas the original focused somewhat on the sexualized violence in our protagonist's revenge scheme, the modern day classic alleviates seduction altogether. Instead, Jennifer chooses to pit them against each other and takes her time to carry out the methodical revenge plan. Although we do not necessarily see how she escapes or her grand scheme of revenge, we are fully assured that justice will be served in the most bloody, cathartic sense of the word.What I found most disturbing about the revision is how her attackers torment the lead character as if we were watching Michael Haneke's Funny Games instead of your typical rape/revenge fare. I must confide that watching these men abuse Jennifer in every sense of the word before sexually assaulting her really took me out of my element and I couldn't but think of all the innocent women who have been raped through the years. Even a more hideous thought, they've been killed after being assaulted.Brave Sarah Butler. This is one role that really deserves the utmost praise and it's a shame we don't give Oscars for horror flicks very often. Camille Keaton is an awesome actress and I couldn't imagine anyone who could pull off this role but Sarah Butler is outstanding as Jennifer Hills. In fact, the supporting actors are very convincing as well which is a strong suit considering most of the cast in the original looked very wooden.Thumbs up sky high! It's hard to tell if the ISOYG is really just a fluke or if we can expect more great endeavors from the cast/crew but I'm definitely sold on this effort. As a long time horror fan and lover of films which address the male encroachment issue, this is one powerful piece of film-making.

But it was haunting, thought provoking, viscerally wrenching.  I think, as a woman, it really had an impact on me.  What would I do in the same circumstances?  Maybe not as extreme as the victim in the movie but who really knows how far we will go unless we are pushed over the edge of all reason.The physical rape scenes were hard to watch but almost as hard to watch were the verbal and emotional rape sequences leading up to them.There were some vague ""huh how did that happen' moments after the rapes that could have been explained better.  The revenge scenes were brutal - but fit the crimes. The movie definitely deserved its NR rating.  This is not one I would recommend anyone under the age of 18 seeing and a lot of adults won't want to see the violence either.  But I think it was well made for the type of movie it is.  Good actors, good camera work (too good sometimes).Edited June 6, 2011:I just watched the 1978 versionI Spit on Your Grave - Day of the Woman.  I was very impressed with it.  Both versions have their strengths.  The cinematography on the original was superb - clear, wonderful color, interesting perspectives.  There was no background musical score and I think that added a lot to the movie - you could hear every sound and the silences added to the drama.The 2011 version had much more of a psychological/emotional buildup to the rapes, which added to the scare factor.  And the revenge sequence in the newer movie was much more brutal.  Also, I thought the part of Matthew was much better played in the newer version, not such a caricature of a mentally troubled young man.In the 1978 version, there was more nudity - male and female; much more solely physical rape scenes - I can definitely understand the NR rating, ESPECIALLY for 1978. An extra on the DVD for this version is a discussion with the director, Meir Zarchi, which was enlightening.The stories aren't exactly alike but both are very good, for the genre they are. Both actresses playing Jennifer Hills - Camille Keaton (1978) and Sarah Butler (2010) did outstanding jobs.",4,"""No trait is more justified than revenge in the right time and place."" - Meir Kahane",1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,2280,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'movie', 'yet', 'have', 'order', 'Netflix', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'yet.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'type', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'ENJOY', 'was', 'haunting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'viscerally', 'wrenching', 'think', 'woman', 'really', 'had', 'impact', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'circumstances', 'Maybe', 'not', 'as', 'extreme', 'victim', 'movie', 'who', 'really', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'are', 'pushed', 'edge', 'reason.The', 'physical', 'rape', 'scenes', 'were', 'hard', 'watch', 'almost', 'as', 'hard', 'watch', 'were', 'verbal', 'emotional', 'rape', 'sequences', 'leading', 'up', 'them.There', 'were', 'vague', 'huh', 'how', 'did', 'happen', 'moments', 'rapes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'better', 'revenge', 'scenes', 'were', 'brutal', 'fit', 'crimes', 'movie', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'NR', 'rating', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'age', '18', 'seeing', 'lot', 'adults', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'violence', 'either', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'type', 'movie', 'Good', 'actors', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'too', 'good', 'sometimes', '.Edited', 'June', '6', '2011', 'just', 'watched', '1978', 'versionI', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'Day', 'Woman', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'versions', 'have', 'strengths', 'cinematography', 'original', 'was', 'superb', 'clear', 'wonderful', 'color', 'interesting', 'perspectives', 'was', 'background', 'musical', 'score', 'think', 'added', 'lot', 'movie', 'could', 'hear', 'sound', 'silences', 'added', 'drama.The', '2011', 'version', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'psychological/emotional', 'buildup', 'rapes', 'added', 'scare', 'factor', 'revenge', 'sequence', 'newer', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'brutal', 'Also', 'thought', 'part', 'Matthew', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'played', 'newer', 'version', 'not', 'caricature', 'mentally', 'troubled', 'young', 'man.In', '1978', 'version', 'was', 'more', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'much', 'more', 'solely', 'physical', 'rape', 'can', 'definitely', 'understand', 'NR', 'rating', 'ESPECIALLY', '1978', 'extra', 'DVD', 'version', 'discussion', 'director', 'Meir', 'Zarchi', 'was', 'enlightening.The', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'alike', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'genre', 'are', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Jennifer', 'Hills', 'Camille', 'Keaton', '1978', 'Sarah', 'Butler', '2010', 'did', 'outstanding', 'jobs']",N/A

Thus, I'm not going to arduously analyze which one is better, more shocking, influential, et cetera ad nauseam, but am going to treat this as the fantastically brutal film that it is in and of itself.Quite simply, I Spit on Your Grave is one of the best revenge shockers I've seen in quite some time.  Lead actress Sarah Butler is simply phenomenal in her role as the protagonist Jennifer Hills, a young writer who seeks solace in a remote cabin to seek inspiration for her creative writing.  Very early in, she is emotionally, physically, and finally sexually assaulted by a ragtag band of rednecks including a mentally challenged man (Chad Lindberg, perhaps the best performance aside from Butler's) and a local police officer.  Anyone lucky enough to not know the plot of the original classic will be wonderfully surprised, as Hills proceeds to hunt down, torture, and kill her perpetrators by the most hideous and imaginative of ways.Suffice it to say, even lovers of brutal horror and gore films will be challenged here.  The brilliant cinematography yields sickening special effects, and the bloody scenes will remain with you long after you sit down to watch.  The inevitable rape scene, though necessary to fuel the viewer's rage and hate at Hills' attackers, is difficult to sit through for numerous reasons, not the least of which is the deep vulnerability of Hills prior to that horrifying event.  If you can persist past that scene, however, you are in for a treat - not since the recent movie Taken have I been so fired up at the response of the film's victim to obstacles, and not since Hostel have I been so pleased by the results of the torture Hills inflicts on those which have inexplicably drawn her to unending rage and madness.All in all, this film is a delight, but for the most stalwart of fans:  disturbing, sickening, and redeeming, all in its own right.

This is simply a remake of the same.There is a long rape scene, that if you include the first assault, accounts for about 25 minutes of the film.  Sadly, alot of the fans on here were probably turned on by the scenes they were watching, which is pathetic.The second half of the film is the victim getting her revenge on her rapists after they think she is dead.  She kills them in very unique and creative ways; very unbelievable and unlikely.Think about how bad the Saw films got after the first one or two, and take that a step further.  Little plot, lots of gore and just a prolonged rape scene.There was nothing artistic or novel in this film.  I ask all the fanboys this...if this is more than just a rape movie, then take out the rape scene, just have it implied in the plot that she is raped...what do you have left?Don't watch this film, its really not worth even wasting one of your Netflix rentals and don't expect to see this on TV.The only people who could like this film are sick, twisted individuals who fantasize about rape.",1,Not sure which is more disturbing...,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,1262,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'more', 'disturbing', 'film', 'fact', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'rant', 'rave', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'is.I', 'saw', 'original', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'mediocre', 'exploitation', 'rape', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'simply', 'remake', 'same.There', 'long', 'rape', 'scene', 'include', 'first', 'assault', 'accounts', '25', 'minutes', 'film', 'Sadly', 'alot', 'fans', 'here', 'were', 'probably', 'turned', 'scenes', 'were', 'watching', 'pathetic.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'victim', 'getting', 'revenge', 'rapists', 'think', 'dead', 'very', 'unique', 'creative', 'ways', 'very', 'unbelievable', 'unlikely.Think', 'how', 'bad', 'Saw', 'films', 'got', 'first', 'one', 'two', 'take', 'step', 'further', 'Little', 'plot', 'lots', 'gore', 'just', 'prolonged', 'rape', 'scene.There', 'was', 'nothing', 'artistic', 'novel', 'film', 'ask', 'fanboys', 'more', 'just', 'rape', 'movie', 'then', 'take', 'out', 'rape', 'scene', 'just', 'have', 'implied', 'plot', 'raped', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'left', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'worth', 'even', 'wasting', 'one', 'Netflix', 'rentals', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'TV.The', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'like', 'film', 'are', 'sick', 'twisted', 'individuals', 'who', 'fantasize', 'rape']",N/A

In my opinion, if a classic movie passes the 20 years old line, I feel not only that it is okay to remake it but that it NEEDS to be remade so that they can be re-discovered by the new generation. No one wants to see a 20+ year old movie (or in this case 30+ year old which is older than me).MOVIEMovie is good, the acting is good (or at least most of it), the story will definitively get your emotions up and maybe even make em argue with each other.

The original movie was made in the era of explotation movies. The original falls under the catagory of Sexplotation, because of the concentration on the explicit rape scene as opposed to the revenge. The remake shifts gears and does it intelligently. It shows enough of the abuse leading to the rape and the rape itself to make you cringe, but nothing to make it remotely sexually arrousing. It then concentrates on the revenge aspect.Jennifer makes her get away and survives for a month in the woods. A month is more than enough time to put together a plan and execute it. Her revenge kills each have to do with how she was treated by the man it is inflicted upon. As the best review of this film I have read so far (M. Mcallan) states, you learn enough about every character to care about them, whether you empathize for them or hate them. At times I rooted for Jennifer and at others times I cringed as she inflicted repayment to the men involved. The men were brutal with her and expected to kill her when they were done, so she just repays an eye for an eye.I watched this movie with my wife and she did not find it over done on the rape or the revenge, which is saying something because she can't take violence at all. If you go into the movie thinking it is just a rape movie glorifying rape then you are not going to like it and you shouldn't bother watching it. If you go into it thinking it is a revenge movie with a brutal subject, I think you will find it is a well made independent movie. I think the movie was made in a very believable way and enjoyed it.

1380349,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0041KKYCY,C. Sawin,"[27, 49]","The Last House on the Left (2009), The Hills Have Eyes (2006), and Irreversible. These are three films that come to mind whenever somebody brings up uncomfortable rape scenes in cinema. I knew that I Spit on Your Grave would feel similar at least in atmosphere to these three films even though I had never seen the original film from 1978. The plot description gives you a pretty strong idea and the fact that the film is unrated pretty much lets you know what you're in for. The real question is if you're actually willing to sit through it.I Spit on Your Grave teases the impending nightmare that you know isn't far from taking place. Tense music and doors banging in the wind suddenly along with a girl walking around barely clothed in the woods just seem to string the audience along until the rape scenes (that's right, more than one) finally take place. It's incredibly hard to watch and practically unbearable. Rape is really the furthest thing from entertaining, but that's probably the point with this kind of film. It gives the audience a chance to be in Jennifer's shoes. Not that they'd want to be. You're forced into knowing the hell she went through so that her revenge seems that much sweeter in the long run.Jennifer's revenge in the film on the men that did this to her is really the main reason to see this. The film is still far from charming, but the second half is captivating in a sick kind of way while revenge is where the film's creativity lies. Jennifer's use of fish hooks, a bear trap, duct tape, lye, hedge clippers, pliers, and a shotgun are all done in pretty unique ways. The horror fan in me that craves blood and gore was strangely satisfied seeing these men get what they deserved while the other side of me that is looking for another fun and entertaining trip to the movie theater was disgusted.There were a few concepts in the film that made me raise an eyebrow other than the obvious. Some of the things that came out of the mouths of this group of cliche rednecks were beyond asinine, but that was probably the point. The whole ""pretty little showhorse"" routine was just bizarre. After the first rape scene where the men make their exit and leave Jennifer alone, she wanders off into the woods with nothing on below the waist. Besides being in a drugged-like state and being in shock, it just seemed like one of those situations in a horror movie that ends with you yelling at the screen wondering why the character didn't do anything else instead. You also never really find out what happened to the sheriff's daughter. Why she wasn't involved in a larger capacity in that final trap is kind of mindboggling. I was expecting her to be in Matthew's place or at least be forced to watch the tape of what her dad had been busy doing out there on the job. Lastly, since when does a writer from the city know how to set up these traps? It's like Jennifer dated MacGyver or something. The same people who complained about Jason in the Friday the 13th remake are going to have a field day with this concept alone.I Spit on Your Grave is incredibly reminiscent of The Last House on the Left. It's an exploitation film that pushes the boundaries of what the audience can sit through without becoming completely nauseated and leaving altogether.

It was smart, gave you gasps and thrills, and was a little smarter for a different time.  In the updated version they attempt to kill our heroine to erase evidence  which makes more sense than if they had followed the original script, which wouldn't have worked this many years later.  I found it to be much more intense than the original which I actually saw a video rental in the eighties which almost played for comedy, that happens sometimes as times change.

If a movie sucks I will let you know that it sucked regardless of how others feel. So lets get right into my review for I Spit on Your Grave the remake made I believe in 2010.This movie is a very hard to watch masterpiece on hardcore brutality. I can't even compare it to the original which I also owned. Because the rape scene was very tame in regards the set up for the revenge. But not here. This movie is a stand alone version from the original. The rape scenes are a lot more brutal, and very hard to watch. You feel for Matthew who is the mentally challenged individual who is manipulated into following orders from the others. The Sheriff role was a nice touch, and you really wanted him to get his. When he does it definitely delivers. On the revenge side its very hard to watch. One particular scene had me wanting to turn away, but I found myself still glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen. When it did happen I hurt but I kept watching. I love movies that elicit strong emotions, and its very powerful that a movie can unnerve you. The violence is realistic and you almost want to cheer on Jennifer for how she handles each situation.This movie gets a full 5 stars because of the build of the story. Everybody in their part does a brilliant job, and comes off as believable. The movie never feels like it over does itself. There is no campy violence in this. As hard as it is to watch, if you can sit through til the end it does indeed pay off. And you've got something special as apart of your collection. I wouldn't pay attention to any of the negative reviews. This remake puts the original to shame, but it still is a very unnerving piece of film that will either make you hate it, love it, or relate to it. I recommend this highly, and suggest each person check this movie out. It has some what of a slow build but once you get past that everything else is straight forward.",5,I still hurt from watching this but it's worth it,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,1973,"['Anybody', 'who', 'reviews', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'movie', 'will', 'let', 'know', 'sucked', 'regardless', 'how', 'others', 'feel', 'So', 'get', 'right', 'review', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'remake', 'made', 'believe', '2010.This', 'movie', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'masterpiece', 'hardcore', 'brutality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'compare', 'original', 'also', 'owned', 'rape', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'tame', 'regards', 'set', 'up', 'revenge', 'not', 'here', 'movie', 'stand', 'alone', 'version', 'original', 'rape', 'scenes', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'brutal', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'feel', 'Matthew', 'who', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'individual', 'who', 'manipulated', 'following', 'orders', 'others', 'Sheriff', 'role', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'really', 'wanted', 'get', 'When', 'definitely', 'revenge', 'side', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'One', 'particular', 'scene', 'had', 'wanting', 'turn', 'away', 'found', 'still', 'glued', 'screen', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'When', 'did', 'happen', 'hurt', 'kept', 'watching', 'love', 'movies', 'elicit', 'strong', 'emotions', 'very', 'powerful', 'movie', 'can', 'unnerve', 'violence', 'realistic', 'almost', 'want', 'cheer', 'Jennifer', 'how', 'situation.This', 'movie', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'build', 'story', 'Everybody', 'part', 'brilliant', 'job', 'off', 'believable', 'movie', 'never', 'feels', 'over', 'campy', 'violence', 'As', 'hard', 'watch', 'can', 'sit', 'til', 'end', 'indeed', 'pay', 'off', ""'ve"", 'got', 'something', 'special', 'apart', 'collection', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'negative', 'reviews', 'remake', 'original', 'shame', 'still', 'very', 'unnerving', 'piece', 'film', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'hate', 'love', 'relate', 'recommend', 'highly', 'suggest', 'person', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'what', 'slow', 'build', 'once', 'get', 'past', 'everything', 'else', 'straight', 'forward']",N/A

1380367,A1PY4BCMI543EX,B0041KKYCY,E. Barrios,"[9, 23]","I recently watched this poor excuse of a remake and expected much more considering its 1.5 million budget. Apparently, better cinematography and one or two better actors can't save this flop. The first problem here is the girl they cast for the leading role. She's supposed to be a novelist but she has the physique of a pro volleyball player. I don't get that. Writers tend to be softer looking because of their sedentary lifestyle. Long hours of writing and research tend to do that to writers, generally speaking.The next issue I have is with a certain phrase that's become popular in our culture. This phrase turns out to be a big pet peeve of mine: ""my bad."" It's a close tie with ""basically"" followed by ""actually"" coming in at third place. Why I mention this is because the script writer decided, with his infinite wisdom (move aside Shakespeare), that ""my bad"" belongs in the script. Perhaps to cater to the vapid youth of our society. As a result, Butler is made to look less intelligent and better suited for the role of lifeguard if they only had such a role in the film.Moving on, Butler's acting was 99 percent unconvincing, much like her co-stars, with the exception of Andrew Howard (Sheriff Storch) and Tracey Walter (Earl). Butler failed to draw me into her world of pain because she didn't get into character. Her tears seemed fake and so did her attempts at expressing fear. As far as this round goes, Camille Keaton from the original movie wins hands down.Lastly, the acting got reversed in this film. What I mean by that is, in the original I.S.O.Y.G., Keaton stole the show while her co-stars didn't. In the remake the co-stars did better than Butler. Go figure. The person(s) responsible for casting could have gone to a school like HB Studios in New York and found a better pool of actors while saving a fortune.Okay, enough bashing for now. On the upside, the cinematography is way better, naturally, and the . . . wait, that's about it. I don't have anymore positives to mention. Darn!I'm going to end this review right now so I won't have to mention the unimaginative kill scenes and the unrealistic way Ms. Hill managed to subdue her rapists. Also, I refuse to mention how a low-budget exploitation film bested a modern, high-budget remake. Wait a sec . . .

1380370,ANUJC77UL5SPP,B0041KKYCY,Francis,"[1, 5]","The remake is extremely difficult to watch but it is not because of the simulated rape, torture and final death scenes. It is because you are going to have to suspend belief like crazy to overlook all the plot holes.Firstly, there is the casting of Butler for our protaganist. She doesn't look like a writer, she doesnt act like a writer, she doesn't talk like a writer. Let's face it she is completely unconvincing as a writer. Keaton has the perfect combination of fairly average 'plain Jane' looks and personality with just enough of the shy conservative introspection that writers are known for. The whole point of being a writer is to be able to escape reality and create fantasy on the page. Butler looks more like she works in a gym full-time, is far too extraverted and outgoing in personality and turns up to a completely isolated cabin in the middle of knowhere with enough boxes of booze for her entire stay and not a single book amongst it. Writers never go anywhere without at least one book. They are either writing a book, reading a book or trying to do both simultaneously. At least she could have brought a Chicago Manual of Style with her.If we don't believe Butler is a writer then how the hell are we supposed to believe she is in the middle of nowhere writing a manuscript?The next problem is her claim that she is looking to get away for some peace and quiet. Away from what exactly? In no time at all, she is talking on her cellphone to someone, somewhere about whatever. Not only that, she brings a laptop hooked up to the internet with her in order to write this 'magnificently groundbreaking' manuscript to make Moby Dick read like a fishing story at the local creek and for some bizarre reason she can't finish it where she lives. Ever heard of a library? Are we really expected to believe that there is absolutely no way she could finish this book unless she travels all the way to this archaic cabin in the middle of nowhere? Even if the story is about a protaganist who is actually staying in a completely isolated cabin in the sticks, can't she just imagine it anyway? Or are we to believe that Wells defended the Earth from Martians with bacteria and then simply wrote down what happened verbatim and called it War of The Worlds?The contradiction to this is that when she gets to the cabin she hits writer's block anyway and decides to get smashed on weed and booze.Next, we are expected to believe that she is single. She lies about calling her boyfriend with her broken cellphone in order to hopefully scare off her attackers which is fine and stays consistent with our basic human reaction to a threat or perceived danger anyway. The problem is this is a lie in more ways than one because we know that she is single. No guy is going to wait around for weeks and weeks before he can see her again while she dedicates herself to her career.In the original it is much easier to believe Keaton's version on Hills is single because of the nerdy academic quality she brings to the character. Butler fails completely with her attempt. Her physique looks more like it should be on the cover of Muscle and Fitness rather than a jacket cover of a work of fiction. I didn't believe for one minute as soon as I saw the running scene where she discovers the abandoned toolshed that she sits on her butt for hours each day writing and writing and writing. She also looks like she could easily outrun all five of the beer drinking idiots on their best day. Butler playing the single Hills, simply does not work.The change from four to five antagonists in this remake was a good idea because it allows for some use of leverage on the part of Hills. Nobody could care less about the four morons and whether they are dead or alive but with the Sheriff, there is his pregnant wife and their young daughter. The problem with this is she is now a prime suspect because she was the last one to see him alive. Hills could easily bury the bodies of the other four, or what's left of them, but there is no way a very pregnant wife of her now dead husband is going to just let the whole thing slide. Hills sends the tape of the crimes that all five men have committed but we never find out whether this is the only copy. If it is a dub then Jennifer must have the original but how did she do this without another tape or the necessary equipment? If it is the original, then his pregnant wife although horrified to find out what her late husband has done, is still a widow because of what Hills has done in retaliation and now has in her possession the only piece of evidence.There is no police report and without the tape there is no evidence that the rapes actually occured except her own testimony against being charged with the murder of five men. If the Sheriff's wife destroys the tape which she probably would, then the outcome is simply that Hills is guilty of a five-way homicide, fraud and kidnapping of the Sheriff's daughter. This is the problem with the final act. The whole thing comes across as surreal. Jennifer even seems to take on a ghostly otherworldly presence where she seems to be able to appear and disappear at will.If we are to believe that the rapes actually did occur then the rest of the movie must be absolutely grounded in reality. As a remake this movie could have been absolutely genius if the whole second and third acts were part of the story that she is trying to write. There could have been some clue at the end that none of it in reality actually happened. She even looks pretty much the same as she did in the beginning. She is simply a brilliant writer who imagined the whole thing and then documented it in such vivid detail that it was like it DID happen.The numerous flaws in this remake are not the actor's fault though. They are simply taking direction from Monroe and trusting his instincts even if something doesn't quite feel right in rehearsals. They all did a fantastic job overall which is why it gets 2 stars. Ultimately though, it is always the director's responsibility for any film.

A viewer enjoys the catharsis and truthfulness of I Spit on Your Grave. But, whether viewing the 1978 or 2010 version, a viewer more appreciates this story than enjoys it. I Spit on Your Grave (2010) is an admirable work. It updates Day of the Woman for current audiences and culture. Day of the Woman needs to be occasionally retold. I compliment a film willing to do that well. I compliment Sarah Butler and the other actors for taking on such brave roles.Director Steven R. Munroe has obviously much respect for Meir Zarchi's work. And, mutual admirers will appreciate Munroe enhancements.  For example, in this version, Jennifer has a good reason not to call the police. About the 1978 version, audiences have asked constantly ""Why the hell doesn't she just call the police?!"" Also, this version emphasizes Jennifer's revenge more than her humiliation. Both versions should exist. Keaton's Jennifer Hills becomes someone with whom an audience sympathizes/empathizes more. Butler's Hills provides more of a tale of warning. And, Munroe's remake expands upon the rapists' personal lives to make the audience more sympathetic to them. These criminals are not Others from the backwoods; they are potentially a person's neighbors. Finally, the DVD's scene titles pay homage to this controversial classic. The Rape of Jennifer Hills is an alternate title for this film, and it is the chapter title for the rape scene.

1380374,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B0041KKYCY,Grindhouse and Horror,"[4, 6]","This film doesn't have the impact of the original, but it probably scores a little bit higher on the entertainment factor.  Butler looks even better than Camile Keaton from the original, although the much remembered castration scene from the original still packs more of a punch than the scene from the remake.  The films replay value is pretty good, but it doesn't really have that grindhouse type feel that I like.  The film should've had a dirtier type feel to it, and it would've been better with that 70s or 80s type feel that is present in the original and other films like FRIDAY THE 13th, MY BLOODY VALENTINE, MARDI GRAS MASSACRE, HUMONGOUS, NIGHT OF THE DEMON, THE BURNING and all those other 70s and 80s exploitation films.  It's got some problems and it could've been better, but it's still a cool movie and it's among the best of the horror remakes. This film, which has a more modern and polished film style, is designed to appeal more to mainstream audiences. At the same time, it has enough exploitation elements to appeal to fans of 70s and 80s exploitation. There's full nudity in the film, but the rape scenes aren't as impactful or as disturbing as the ones in the original; I'm not saying they have no impact. I'm just saying that I don't think they're comparable to the scenes in the original film. This is the same for the violence. Although at times very graphic, the violence doesn't quite pack the punch of the first film; but these scenes still have impact. If you want something really fast paced, you might be disappointed; The movie moves decently, but it isn't fast paced. The movie does concentrate on character development and story; it isn't all exploitation from beginning to end. If you want something that's overloaded with gore, you might also be disappointed; it's nasty and gory at times, but it isn't filled with blood from beginning to end.The DVD quality is very good.",4,Good remake with some cool deaths and Butler looks good.,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,1910,"['film', ""n't"", 'have', 'impact', 'original', 'probably', 'little', 'bit', 'higher', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'Butler', 'even', 'better', 'Camile', 'Keaton', 'original', 'much', 'remembered', 'castration', 'scene', 'original', 'still', 'more', 'punch', 'scene', 'remake', 'films', 'replay', 'value', 'pretty', 'good', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'grindhouse', 'type', 'feel', 'like', 'film', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'dirtier', 'type', 'feel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', '70s', '80s', 'type', 'feel', 'present', 'original', 'other', 'films', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13th', 'MY', 'BLOODY', 'VALENTINE', 'MARDI', 'GRAS', 'MASSACRE', 'HUMONGOUS', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'DEMON', 'THE', 'BURNING', 'other', '70s', '80s', 'exploitation', 'films', 'got', 'problems', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'still', 'cool', 'movie', 'best', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'modern', 'polished', 'film', 'style', 'designed', 'appeal', 'more', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'same', 'time', 'enough', 'exploitation', 'elements', 'appeal', 'fans', '70s', '80s', 'exploitation', 'full', 'nudity', 'film', 'rape', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'impactful', 'as', 'disturbing', 'ones', 'original', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'have', 'impact', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'comparable', 'scenes', 'original', 'film', 'same', 'violence', 'times', 'very', 'graphic', 'violence', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pack', 'punch', 'first', 'film', 'scenes', 'still', 'have', 'impact', 'want', 'something', 'really', 'fast', 'paced', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'decently', ""n't"", 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'concentrate', 'character', 'development', 'story', ""n't"", 'exploitation', 'beginning', 'end', 'want', 'something', 'overloaded', 'gore', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'nasty', 'gory', 'times', ""n't"", 'filled', 'blood', 'beginning', 'end.The', 'DVD', 'quality', 'very', 'good']",N/A
1380375,A2ORA9TK7GA6N,B0041KKYCY,"Hudson ""Brian Hudson""","[6, 11]","I watched this movie very reluctantly, as I usually do not like horror-remakes. The form has become incredibly trendy, and the remakes rarely hold a candle to the originals. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the remake of ""I Spit On Your Grave"".First of all, as the viewer, you need to know what you are getting into here when you are watching this film. If you aren't familiar with the original 1978 film, it was an absolutely brutal exploration of rape and revenge. The remake actually stays fairly close to the original, except the remake was filmed 32 years later, which means that the violence and the sexual assaults have been elevated to an absolutely extreme level. As far as I'm concerned, AWESOME! Yet, I know that lots of people are going to call this film ""trash"" or ""porn"" simply because it deals with the topic of brutal rape. There are plenty of ghastly and grisly images in modern horror films, yet everyone seems to think that rape is absolutely the most offensive and the worst violence you can commit to film. To me, it's not much different from the type of violence you would find in films like ""Saw"" (series), ""Hostel"" (series), ""Martyrs"", ""Frontier(s)"" ""Inside"" or ""The Human Centipede"". But, I know some people just can't handle something about rape scenes. If you are one of these people, you need to search elsewhere for entertainment. Even though the sexual assault scenes really don't take up that much screen time, they are pretty degrading and nasty (nothing like you'd see in ""Irreversible"", but this film's sexual assaults can keep up with about any other rape you've ever seen on film). DO YOU THINK I'M SICK YET?? Hahaha, ok, maybe you have a point. However, I'm not especially thrilled watching rape scenes in horror. To me, it's not very creative, although it has an incredible power to shock people. Yet, I was actually way more uncomfortable watching the rest of the violence in the film. I'm trying not to write any spoilers, but let's just say there are some ""traps"" that the ""Saw"" franchise would be jealous of. Absolutely vicious. This was the most satisfying element of the film for me. If you like your horror tough and brutal, you very well may like this film.You must remember a few other things going into this film. This is not the kind of film that's going to get critical praise. The plot is virtually non-existent. Or at least, it's very, very simple. I didn't find this to be a huge problem, because the sequence of events in the film form the story. The dialogue is INCREDIBLY cheesy, to the point of making your skin crawl as much as the violence in the film. Also, the acting is somewhat sub-par (with the exception of Sarah Butler's performance in the lead role). It's the only element of the film that doesn't seem real, which I think detracts from the overall value of a serious horror film. There's also a loose end that isn't tied up at the end of the film, which left me scratching my head wondering why they didn't address what happened to this particular character. These problems are very common in horror films (as most people know), so if you know what you're about to watch and you allow yourself to be entertained, these little problems don't seriously detract from the overall experience of the film. These few negative elements led me to give this film 3.5 stars instead of 4.5, which it would have earned simply for the level of violence and intensity. Overall, as far as horror-remakes go, this one is one the better ones, IMO. I probably still like the original better, due to the novelty of 70's horror films, but I'd actually say it's a fairly close race, and I never say that about these remakes. If you are a fan of this type of cinema, I'd say it's definitely worth a view. 3.5 stars.",4,"I'm not a big horror-remake fan, but this was better than I expected.

1380377,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B0041KKYCY,I'm Right,"[4, 12]","Despite gory disturbing films usually being blacklisted as trash, there are some genuinely good movies with graphic scenes of violence and rape, Irreversible, Martyrs and Ichi the Killer come to mind. So before you say ""this isn't a Disney flick stupid"" I know that, I came into this film expecting at least some form of catharsis or gruesome entertainment, which this film has, but what bothered me about this film handles it's graphic material.Let's talk about the rape scene shall we? Oh sorry did I say scene, I meant chunk of the movie, because it lasts for about 40 minutes. 40 minutes of non stop abuse/rape. It almost got comical because when one of the hillbillies or whatever were done having fun with the girl another one jumped right back on her at least five more times, it was like the never-ending ending to Return of the King; until finally she's crawling through the dirt completely naked and nearly comatose in shock. Ok, so we get this long brutal rape scene, maybe they're trying to top Irreversible or whatever so ok, that was disturbing, now the movie has my attention using the cheapest trick in the book, now what do they do?Well the interesting thing about this movie is that it follows the victims only, letting the attackers use the ol' ""get out of plot inconvieniences free"" card throughout. So the first half of the movie you see the girl do boring things that no one paid to see until the big rape scene comes, all through the perspective of the victim, the heroine (if you can call her that.) Then the second half the hillbillies realize she's still alive and enacting revenge on them, and it completely follows them around for the last half of the movie.My problem with this is if you're going to show a character go through a long and torturous hell, you better develop the character, otherwise we might as well be watching a high quality snuff film. The woman after her horrific ordeal is never on camera again unless she's torturing someone, *snore*. After she fell into the river I would've been much MUCH more interested in seeing her frantically escape her captors, collect herself again, and then exact revenge. If you take time to develop the character, her motives, and illustrate her mentality more the revenge part has more of an impact than. If you just jump to the violence, skipping all character development than all the meaning is lost, and that's exactly what the director did with this film, he chose the easy way.So instead of the film showing us character development it pads itself out with useless scenes such as the hillbillies arguing and complaining. We don't need to see the hillbillies that much, we know they're bad, we can assume they're probably pissed off they lost the girl, and we know the girl is going to get her revenge just by looking at the cover. The director either A) doesn't know how to film a scene WITHOUT someone getting horribly mutilated/tortured and B) assumes the audience is so rabid with bloodlust that we don't want to have our time wasted by anything else. I'm going to guess the answer is (A) though because even if this was just a splatter flick we still get some boring filler scenes.So finally we get to the part we've been waiting for, the girl's revenge, and I do admit the death scene with the crows was creative and gruesome, but otherwise it's like some cheap SAW knock-off that involves penises and anuses more, basically if you haven't gotten the idea this film's purpose is to be disgusting as possible. One by one the characters are taken captive through the power of plot convienence. This would've been another instance where the narritive should've focused on the girl hunting down her targets, plotting her next move and giving the audience an insight into her character's intellect more, instead we get scenes where the main hillbilly shouts on his front lawn ""I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE"". Eventually she takes them all out then sits outside and stares at the camera. The End!So after sitting through a 40 minute rape and watching graphic violence, I wondered why the hell I just sat through I Spit on your Grave. Gore and shock can be great additions to give a movie more of a bite, just look at Robocop; but in this movie the centerpiece IS gore and violence. I Spit on your Grave is boring when people aren't getting tortured and unnecessarily repulsive when they are. If you want yet another Craven remake the Hills Have Eyes and Last House on the Left have much more fleshed out and interesting characters that the audience can grow to care for. If you just want to see how disgusting a movie can get there are countless better ones that spare the boring details such as August Underground Mordum, the Guniea Pig series, or even the recent Human Centipede 2. This movie is like some bastard child between these cult gore-fests and a profitable/appealing hollywood remake, and the whole outcome is just a boring and repulsive mess. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.",1,Just Revolting.,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,4986,"['gory', 'disturbing', 'films', 'usually', 'being', 'blacklisted', 'trash', 'are', 'genuinely',

1380378,A34A095NNHFMB5,B0041KKYCY,Jack Felson,"[2, 4]","It's easy to review this movie, especially after seeing the highly controversial original from Meir Zarchi. Why? Because it's just a version for a large audience, as predictable as possible, when the original was only for adults! See this: Camille Keaton (grand-niece of Buster Keaton) was 31 when she starred in Zarchi's 1978 almost no-budget original, which came out when rape and revenge storytelling was anything but fashioned. Sarah Butler was 24 when she starred in the remake. So? The mature, aristocratic female in the original has been replaced with a little tease, escaped from the worst TV series and who moves and speaks and dresses up like any common student. She's silly enough to get lost when she has a map (and works for a magazine lol) so she has to ask around for her way. Bad luck, the guy who gives her the info is the same one who'll fall down on her later, with his mates. Predictable? You got it! In the original, Jennifer doesn't ask for her way to the cabin so we never know who will fall down on her and how - we call this suspense. When it happens, it's surprising because it's in daytime, on a river. Totally unexpected. In the remake, it's different (at night, inside her cabin!) but we can see everything coming right away, very quickly, especially after the camcorder precision. No suspense!The rape scenes (two in a row, instead of three in the original) are shocking but they totally lack the cold realism of the original, thanks to - or because of? - Jennifer who keeps weeping like a baby, and the shaking camera. The filmmakers (like most horror directors today) say goodbye to style and cold realism, they do nothing else but shoot from one angle to another and use frantic editing that makes everything, even the simulated sexual moves, look desperately flat. So flat that the film can be followed with the sound off. The movie tries to surprise without managing to do it - it's not the goal after all -, especially with that sherif who passes for honest but happens to be as degenerate as the others, even more since he has a family. The film starts to be interesting only after Jennifer jumps in the river and mysteriously disappears, in front of the thugs (how could she stay totally out of sight for so long?) but Monroe, the director, wastes everything with plans taken from ""Ring"" as she brutally re-appears in a ghost-like way, with her long black hair partly hiding her face, then from the ""Saw"" series as she takes on the thugs one after another. She always does the same thing, taking them by surprise and knocking them down, preferably from behind, so they wake up in the most uncomfortable positions ever. It's such a piece of cake for her that the movie loses all of its interest - it didn't have much so far - from the moment we catch her revenge method. She looks to much like Shawnee 'Amanda' Smith in the ""Saw"" series to be totally convincing. Thing is, unlike Amanda in ""Saw"", Jennifer hasn't been showed and taught anything about torture 'art', so what the film shows can be described as impossible.Many people say that the revenge scenes in Zarchi's original are poorly executed, maybe because they didn't satisfy their needs and thirst for 'voyeurism' at a time when image and real TV shows have invaded everything. I personally found them shocking - especially the scene in the bathtub, which has been removed for the remake and replaced with very common, predictable torture stuff. The thug is chained to the ceiling when Jennifer cuts his thing off (too easy!), when he's not in the original - she sexually manipulates him. Apparently the lesson hasn't been taken. And where do all those ropes and chains and perfectly cut pieces of wood come from anyway? Why does she need to use all this crap? How can she show so much ingenuity and cleverness during her revenge when she looks so traumatized? On the whole this movie is violent of course but that's all, it's shocking but grotesque at the same time, the revenge scenes are repetitive and go uselessly way too far. I saw it just after the original so it never surprised me when the original did.If you want to be surprised, there are way better films around - notably some from the 70's-80's-90's. Today the fashion is to remakes with no intention to surprise anybody, just to allow us to see as many things as possible without thinking too much. The 'I Spit On Your Grave' original was cold, decent and new for its time, this remake is just exploitation of violence for the masses.

I'm a fan of old School campy, yet gory late 70's early to mid-80's Slasher films. I don't dig Torture films at all and feel it's to real life especially in these times! However, I liked the original ""I spit on your grave"", better than ""Last House on the left"", I thought the original Last house was kind of mean and too dark even for the time. I feel ""I spit, was a time period piece and making more gore and more revenge in a New film was Not necessary. I like my Horror a little Campy and Silly yet very well acted. This film ""The original"" was an exploitation film not any more to it at the time. If your Not a fan of Exploitation and want a more serious version yet (I'm sure not as well acted because they used older more experienced actors and Actresses back then, then you might like this better. I was impressed with some of the reviews here for this movie! Very well written! I have a copy of this but saw the beginning and thought as I usually do; The actress is too young, It looks like it might be silly because of that fact. I'm a fan of Older Actors and Actresses player younger characters like in the 80's and then discovering a Molly Ringwald or John Cusack or Crispin Glover Etc. It made the films not just in the horror genre such Classics. For instance James Spader was 30 in ""Pretty in Pink"", Judd Nelson and Emilo were late 20's or 30 in ""The breakfast Club"" that was a directors secret at the time and made some Amazing films with great acting! So Going into this, if I do give it a try will be to see if the acting is good and if it's low on that and Camp, I may stick with the original. ""Irreversible"" was foul and disgusting shock. I like Horror movies. I guess in a a generation were we've been through wars and tougher times, young people want more torture and gore less plot or style? This was just a little exploitation film from the seventies that had a real tough subject matter. Film makers need to get more a creative stop making remakes, Please. Give the independent directors a chance at the Theaters and make some fresh stuff in the horror genre and put more backing behind it. 80's forever!.......Took a chance not a good movie, drags forever, male acting as bad as was in the Friday the 13th, Remake! Bad. Skip this one especially if your an exploitation/Horror fan it's just Not a good film. If your interested in the the story or original film get that one if not, look elsewhere!

The rape scene or scenes were not graphic, or at least not as much as I expected. This is good and the film did not glorify rape in any way. Another thing about the film is that I wished that she didn't kill Matthew off because he was the only one who was truly sorry and the circumstances of the rape were more forced upon him just as they were upon her. So, I didn't feel it fair that she took vengeance on him. Yeah, it's just a movie. I know. I thought the movie was gruesome and hard to watch. The hardest scenes to watch were the gory parts - her revenge. I closed my eyes some of the time because it was just plain gross. I'm not a horror movie fan, but something about this movie made me want to watch it. I guess because it's not your typical slasher movie. I don't think of it actually being realistic to have that many rapists in one backwoods town (4 not including Matthew). Anything's possible. I know. It's just a film. I also don't think it's realistic that a rape victim, especially of that degree, would have the calmness and preparedness to think such detailed plans out and carry them out, to boot. It worked for her, but the film does not discuss the moral and legal aspects of her actions. If it were to be more real, unfortunately, it should have showed her being handcuffed and sent to prison for the rest of her life for premeditated murder, which is pretty hard to justify no matter and wouldn't be considered a crime of passion.

Wheither or not the film as a whole is better than the original is up for debate, and I guess would depend upon your tastes.The remake is still a film you will find difficult to watch with other people, as the rape scene is just as brutal as in the original, albeit, thankfully, a bit shorter. It brutally gets the point across but does not over utilize the gratuitous nudity of the original film. The scene does what it is designed to do, to make you hate the five men enough that you want to see them dead.The story is pretty much the same, but the acting is much better than in the original, and the characters are much more believable and more developed, so to speak. There is however, the cliche of the rednecks in the woods terrorising the city girl, that is overused in horror movies.Sarah Butler plays her role as the victim very well, and when it comes to the revenge scenes, you are really wanting to see the antagonists get what they have coming. I liked the fact that she didn't have to take her clothes off in order to exact revenge, which is something that just never made sense to me in the original. I did think though, that the revenge scenes were rather unrealistic with the use of complicated traps, which makes you wonder what Jennifer's relationship is to MacGyver or Jigsaw from the Saw films. But I found myself happy with the outcome anyway, despite it being over-the-top.I would say if you are a fan of the original, or are a fan of revenge flicks in general, you'll appreciate this film. If you are not a fan of this type of film, just stay away. I never have understood those people that understand full-well what they are getting into going in, but go and watch anyway just so they can turn around and write a scathing review about the content. It goes without saying that this film is not for everyone.This Blu-Ray had excellent picture and sound, but I felt was lacking in the special features department.

1380405,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0041KKYCY,K. Driscoll,"[30, 61]","I Spit on Your Grave, originally titled Day of the Woman, was a 1978 film that was notoriously vile garbage somewhat noteworthy for being dissected brutally by Roger Ebert in his scathing synchronal zero star review.  But still, it was notoriously vile garbage before anything else quite like it was ever made, and believe it or not in some circles that counts for something, if only for being the first of its kind.  Additionally, the original film may have been meant as a pro-feminist reaction to violence against women created by an idiot who doesn't know how to make movies, but obviously its a stretch to find any artistic merit at all.  So now, some 32 years later we get a remake that we can assume not only contains even more diluted messages for its defenders but also even more ammunition for its detractors, especially given the feminist movement in the United States has really been inactive for pretty much the same three decades since the release of the original film.  It doesn't matter though because some horror films today believe they are beyond having artistic value and somehow immune toward scrutiny of their motives.  The I Spit On Your Grave remake is not quite as shocking and disgusting as the original considering the time period, but it is even more shameful for being long, stupid, gratuitous torture porn that contains some horrifically bad acting and writing.  It is truly one of the most disdainful pieces of filth I've had the displeasure of enduring in quite some time.  It is crucial to note that my distaste for this movie is less so for its unsettling content than for how the actors are mismanaged and likely untalented anyway, and because they are reciting foolish dialogue.In case you didn't know already I Spit On Your Grave is a movie about a girl named Jenny (Sarah Butler) who retreats to a cabin in the middle of nowhere to write.  She is haunted by the ultimate redneck stereotypes who eventually rape her.  The second half of the film covers her violent revenge, which contains some insanely implausible and unfortunately nowadays all-too-typical over the top horror-film violence.  Both the rape scene and the revenge scenes are what makes this movie appealing to someone out there.  The sexual violence in this movie is the solitary reason for its existence and no one sensible person can dispute otherwise.  Obviously I have an issue with that and if you don't, well, enjoy your movie.I cringe giving this movie any credit whatsoever, but its star Sarah Butler can be partially exonerated.  She is perhaps a bit too pretty for this kind of movie and actually seems to have found some inspiration to act here in flashes.  She might even have talent.  I don't know why that happened but I sort of feel sorry for her.  It's actually a brave role and maybe she intended to show someone out there what she is willing to sacrifice.  Its other young actors are simply not good enough to defend but I don't want to blame them too much either.

1380410,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0041KKYCY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[61, 79]","With the resurgence of exploitation films, we've really brought some unpleasantly vicious movies into the mainstream. Some are good, some are not--just like any genre--but what is fascinating to me is how commonplace they now seem. When I was growing up, pictures like the original ""I Spit On Your Grave,"" ""Faces of Death"" and ""Last House on the Left"" were considered vile films and they had to be discovered. A largely underground, low budget, and independent film community had to support these controversial, malicious films. In many ways, they represented a rebellion against conventional entertainment.  However, by today's standards these films, while certainly grim, are relatively subdued compared to the graphic torture, violence and gore that delight audiences at the local mall.Designed to provoke audiences, one thing is certain--few people will be ambivalent about the new incarnation of ""I Spit On Your Grave.""  I know people who think it's terrific AND I know people who think that it is repellant.  Just the latest example of the growing market I like to refer to as ""torture cinema,"" ISOYG will have very few viewers straddling the middle ground.  While the original film played to the time it was released--there was almost a female empowerment message in the retribution scenario--this new version eschews a specific societal context.  Much more gore oriented than its predecessor, it feels distinctly less real.  That is either good or bad depending on your vantage point. The amateurish quality of the original lends it a gritty realism that actually works in the film's favor.  Combined with Camille Keaton's surprisingly effective performance, the film had the flavor of something that could actually happen.  The new version is decidedly more elaborate and the revenge conceptions are more over-the-top.  The enjoyment value, thus, is determined by whether graphic brutality qualifies as entertainment for you.I haven't said much about the film's plot.  I think most people know what happens.  A young woman is sexually assaulted by a group of men, brutalized, and left for dead.  She reemerges with vengeance on her mind--and the men will rue the day they met her.  Sarah Butler as the victim in question has some nice moments, but exists largely to service the plot.  For me, she lacked the genuineness of Keaton.  The men are slightly more developed in this new vision.  While barely more than caricatures in either film, they have more shading here--and the mentally challenged character is conceptualized more fully in this edition.  The film remains unrepentantly bleak and disturbing and pushes buttons for the sake of pushing buttons.  There is no grand meaning to be had--but, quite frankly, I don't think that's why anyone would be watching in the first place.Mind you, I'm not claiming either version of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is a great movie.  I do, however, believe that the original was more relevant in relationship to its time period.  But this new film is made with technical prowess and visual flair (however unpleasant).  Some may claim these films as a feminist treatise, and some as vile female degradation. In truth, they are actually a bit of both--but I don't think that they necessarily merit a serious philosophical discussion. Either way, this film was meant to assault your senses--and that it does!  On it's own merits, it succeeds at what it set out to do.  If you like gore, you may well like this.  If you don't, by all means, stay far far away!

She shines during the second half of the film, which she is out for revenge. My personal favorite scene is after the rape when she is walking away. I don't know what it was about the walk, but her walk away was almost as emotional as the rape scene for me.*The way she revenges the rapes would make Saw creators envious. Each individual man was murdered in the exact same way that they assaulted her... I would try to explain it more, but it would give away too many details about the juiciest part of the movie.*There was a lot of emotion in this movie. You could see on the faces of the men that were raping her some sympathy... It almost made me feel like they were thinking, ""I really don't want to do this, but since they are why not."" Maybe mixed emotions is what I should call it; one minute they have this slightly disturbed look on their faces, the next they are doing horrible, horrible things to her.The Bad:*I felt like a lot of the actors in this movie over-acted in attempt to get noticed at how great their acting skills were... and maybe get more jobs. I don't know. And I have bad news for almost all of them; their acting was sub-par at best. It's like a bad B-movie where the actors give it their all and it becomes forced. In a way this isn't really bad, considering I enjoy B-movies because I get a kick out of it.*Throughout the whole entire movie I found myself thinking the same thing every body thinks when a female in a horror movie does stupid things. ""Why did she go out there alone?"" Why did she keep going outside in the middle of the night to lock the shed? And of course, while running through the woods (without any pants on, which I didn't understand) she falls. I guess this is just me griping... I would say that I wish there would be one horror movie where the female wasn't as smart as a 5 year old, but Jennifer makes up for this when she murders her attackers.The Ugly:*The rape scene was a little more shocking than I would have expected for a newer release. Most, especially compared to the movies in the 70's and 80's, are not as gruesome as the originals. Towards the end I did have to shield my eyes, because I actually put myself in her shoes.

1380423,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0041KKYCY,Mark Turner,"[3, 5]","Okay so the truth is there is no spitting nor are there any graves in either the original or remade version of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. The title was made by producer Jerry Gross for the original film in order to get film bookers in the south to book the film again, which had already failed in cut form under the title DAY OF THE WOMAN. With the additional removed sequences back in place, a take that MPAA attitude, a sensational and unforgettable ad campaign and tons of free publicity when Ebert & Siskel slammed the film (hard to believe Ebert could do so after watching his BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS which he scripted), the film went on to make history.And now Hollywood, in its never ending search for something new...okay no not new...in their attempt to remake every movie ever made, we get this latest version of the film. It follows the same basic story. Jennifer Hill (this time played by Sarah Butler) comes to a country retreat for a month only to be sought out by gas station attendant Johnny (Jeff Branson) and his pals.This time around the gang seems more backwater good ole boys than even the original displayed. Is it any wonder country folk have no use for big city folk when they are constantly portrayed this way? Anyway, the group attacks and rapes Jennifer more than once and in more than one location. ***SPOILER ALERT*** When she contacts the local sheriff to come to her cabin in the woods for help she learns too late that he's part of this group as well. Having been raped and sodomized by this group, Jennifer crawls home and plots her revenge.The same plotline passes here as she takes her time trapping each one and taking out her vengeance in the most brutal ways possible. While the rape sequences of Jennifer are as disturbing as they were in the original, the revenge sequences here take up more time than they did in 1978. Not only that but her methods fall more in line with today's images of torture than those in the original. The original was more about her just exacting her revenge with only one taking any amount of time. Here, she slowly does unmentionable deeds to each of her protagonists, with something especially disgusting in store for the sheriff.With more money to spend this version of the film has a much crisper look to it. The photography is well done, the acting intense and believable and the story continues to promote the genre of film known as revenge movies. Does it leave you with a bad taste in your mouth like the first one did? Yes, it does.Its one thing to make an original film and not know what the audience will think of it. Its quite another to take a disturbing film and make it over again, adding little more than well done gore and more over the top kill scenes. When released the film didn't do much at the box office. Perhaps that means that the audience for what is known as torture porn films is dwindling. We can only hope.Does the film offer anything new? Not that I could see. Yes, the performances were well done, yes it had a polished look to it. But is it a movie that you'll want to stick on the shelf next to BAMBI and MARY POPPINS?

The first one was ""Watchmen"" the second one is this POS.Although I never have seen the original of I spit on your grave I think that makes it better because I can freely judge this movie. For the most part the first half of the movie just plays out like some late night porno. A girl walks around wearing a skimpy outfit gets hit on (what else is new?). She goes to a cabin alone to do what I don't know play with her laptop while drinking wine I guess. Apparently she's supposed to be a writer? Yeah I buy that. So writer girl prances around half dressed and sometimes in her underwear. She gets the attention of some locals and the obvious rape happens. I guess that's why I didn't like the film so much.Since this focuses on the rape so much it seems ""FORCED"" to say the least. I don't get the sense that the girl is being raped. I don't get to feel her trauma or her pain. I have no connection to her character. It's as though it's thrown in there to get it out the way. ""Last House on the Left"" had a better rape story. You got to know the victim and you felt a connection seeing her pain as she got raped. You wanted to see revenge for what they did to her. If your movie is going to be about a woman getting revenge at least build her character up so that we care about the revenge part. This was just like a dark porno (if they even make those) and a so so one at that. You actually feel that she did worse to the rapist than they did to her. Just because they developed her character so poorly.All I know is that the girl is from the city,dresses like a slut, smokes marijuana, and drinks A LOT of wine. That's all you get to learn about your character. How am I supposed to even care what happens to her? She might as well as be an extra in the background.Long story short this movie seriously lacks a decent plot.

She recovers but, instead of going to the law, decides to get her own just, ghastly revenge on the quartet.The movie contained a considerable amount of graphic nudity, and both the rape and revenge sequences were quite brutal and realistic.  Of course, during the revenge sequences, one felt like cheering every time Ms. Keaton dispatched one of her attackers.Steven R. Monroe directed the 2010 remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, which stars Sarah Butler, who does quite well in the Keaton role.Though the heroine's methods of revenge in this version are much more brutal, the screenplay follows the general plot of the 1978 picture.  It does add one key character, who I won't talk about lest I be a Spoiler, but the addition of this character certainly makes the story more intriguing.There is still some graphic nudity in 2010 version, but not as much as there was in 1978.Extras on this DVD include director and producer (Lisa Hansen) commentary and a ""Making of"" featurette.There are a many extremely dark and disturbing scenes in this version, which some people will not be able to watch.

I've heard how it's a grindhouse/cult classic, but I never had a chance to see it so I went into I Spit on your Grave (2010) without any background to compare it to. I'd imagine die-hard fans of the original might be disappointed in the same way remakes of almost ANY Movie would be disappointed (regardless of how good it was). Throw in the fact it's basically a Starz Direct-to-Video movie (VERY short run on no more than a dozen theaters) with a 1.5Mil budget, making very little of that back.I was expecting to be disappointed, but hoping for the best.I must say, the movie was disturbing at times, it was disgusting at times, but I loved it! I think many will find issue with what goes on in the movie, and I completely see why, but you have to remember it's a movie. I'm very against all of that, but in the same way I can watch JAWS explode, zombies attack people or people deal with Jigsaw's deadly traps in other movies, you just have to remember it's a movie. With the themes being more ""real"" in this one, it's not for everyone (and if that doesn't get you, the violence will!)For horror lovers, this is a very good movie. It's not watered down to be a PG-13 movie, it's a hard ""R"" at least. Despite the themes (trying to avoid any spoilers here, for those who don't know the story), it's not a depressing movie. It's a good revenge-movie in the style of Kill Bill, and some of the payback will have you disgusted while cheering the main character on. To some, that may sound like the worst movie ever, and for those I recommend against it. For everyone else, check it out.It's high on (graphic) violence and nudity, so it's definitely one for adults only.For the Blu-Ray itself, video is VERY nice (I believe it was filmed with the RED camera), same for audio. It's not a direct-to-video 'junk' release, they actually put some time and effort into making it look and sound good.The extras are a commentary and about 30 minutes of cast/crew interviews. I'll admit I skipped over most of these as a lot of the cast seemed completely clueless about what they were making (""I told my sister about the script and she said thats a remake of ""I spit on your grave!"" - I never saw the movie, but I knew I had to do it then!"")",4,"This movie was DISGUSTING, DISTURBING but NOT disappointing!

It's a good guess that for politically correct reasons they ended it there; not for a sequel.

At first, I thought ... *** spoiler *** ... that our heroine really had returned from the grave. Although certainly the heroines/victims in these movies deserve to be angry, it tends to amaze me that they are so single-minded in their vengeance. I guess the movies are kind of like the Charles Bronson Death Wish movies in that regard only certainly pro-female.The rape scenes are never pro-female ... but what they do show is how such things really could come about. In that sense, they are probably about as scary as anything that could be filmed, and make the movies about as horrible in the true sense of the word as any horror movie. Probably the newer I Spit On Your Grave version deserves more than two stars ... for realism, ingenuity and just plain being able to keep you in your chair-itedness.

1380457,A24AY6NOKLJNWC,B0041KKYCY,OneTaste,"[3, 5]","I really enjoyed this movie! I think that we humans typically love watching movies because in those moments we are transported into a completely new dimension of experience. When the movie has the power to stimulate our emotional cords and keep us at the edge of our seat, wide-eyed, then it is definitely a good movie. ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is just the movie that I had been yearning to see! A move that had the power to keep me glued to the television screen, not wanting to go to the restroom, even though I had the ability to press the pause button!The movie starts off with a beautiful young woman who just wants to get out where there are no disruptions,distractions or interuptions; away from the hustle and bustle of the city, simply to concentrate on writing her next novel. On her way to the cabin that she rented, she has to stop and pump gas. As she pumps gas she attempts to get help with directions from the guys who are attending the gas station. Being a small town where there is nothing to do, the attendants seem a little odd, not familiar with outsiders or how to interact with them. They find out where she is staying and end up showing up and violating her. The rape scene is very intense, lasts for quite some time and can be rather disturbing, definitely not easy to watch. Yet, as I continued to watch, I started to realize exactly what the movie producer was doing, why he or she was giving so much emphasis to that particular scene. The length and violent nature of that scene helps to build this tension within the viewer, this sense of acute anger, of frustration, this sense of wanting to do something to help her this poor girl. The scene completely pulls you in and you totally forget that it is only a movie; and that is the magic of a good movie!What you feel for the perpetrators is the catalist, the primer that enables you to enjoy the sweet revenge that is surely to come during the rest of the movie. I was amazed at the ingenuity that the girl expressed in her contraptions, designed to get each of her perpetrators back for what they did to her. I won't give away the details, but I loved the last revenge plot, and how she executed her payback. What made it really cool and interesting was that she got her chance to say back to them,to each one of her attackers, exactly what they had said to her as they were raping her and she pleaded for her life.I hope that I didn't give out too much, but this is definitely a movie that I recommend for adults who want a good nail-bitter to watch!",4,Revenge Never Tasted So Good!,1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,2529,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'think', 'humans', 'typically', 'love', 'watching', 'movies', 'moments', 'are', 'transported', 'completely', 'new', 'dimension', 'experience', 'When', 'movie', 'power', 'stimulate', 'emotional', 'cords', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'wide-eyed', 'then', 'definitely', 'good', 'movie', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'just', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'yearning', 'see', 'move', 'had', 'power', 'keep', 'glued', 'television', 'screen', 'not', 'wanting', 'go', 'restroom', 'even', 'had', 'ability', 'press', 'pause', 'button', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'out', 'where', 'are', 'disruptions', 'distractions', 'interuptions', 'away', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'city', 'simply', 'concentrate', 'writing', 'next', 'novel', 'way', 'cabin', 'rented', 'stop', 'pump', 'gas', 'gas', 'get', 'help', 'directions', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'attending', 'gas', 'station', 'Being', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'nothing', 'do', 'attendants', 'seem', 'little', 'odd', 'not', 'familiar', 'outsiders', 'how', 'interact', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'staying', 'end', 'up', 'showing', 'up', 'violating', 'rape', 'scene', 'very', 'intense', 'quite', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'definitely', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'Yet', 'continued', 'watch', 'started', 'realize', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'producer', 'was', 'doing', 'why', 'was', 'giving', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'particular', 'scene', 'length', 'violent', 'nature', 'scene', 'build', 'tension', 'viewer', 'sense', 'acute', 'anger', 'frustration', 'sense', 'wanting', 'do', 'something', 'help', 'poor', 'girl', 'scene', 'completely', 'totally', 'forget', 'only', 'movie', 'magic', 'good', 'movie', 'What', 'feel', 'perpetrators', 'catalist', 'primer', 'enjoy', 'sweet', 'revenge', 'surely', 'come', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'amazed', 'ingenuity', 'girl', 'expressed', 'contraptions', 'designed', 'get', 'perpetrators', 'back', 'what', 'did', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'loved', 'last', 'revenge', 'plot', 'how', 'executed', 'payback', 'What', 'made', 'really', 'cool', 'interesting', 'was', 'got', 'chance', 'say', 'back', 'one', 'attackers', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'said', 'were', 'raping', 'pleaded', 'life.I', 'hope', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'definitely', 'movie', 'recommend', 'adults', 'who', 'want', 'good', 'nail-bitter', 'watch']",N/A

Some ""good ole boys"" (Jeff Branson, Daniel Franzese', Rodney Eastman, Tracy Walter and Andrew Howard.) are about to make all their dreams come true when they rape Jennifer and leave her for dead. Jennifer comes back for a little more of the old ""in out, in out"" and will be these perverts worst nightmare!I Spit On Your Grave is a Remake FROM Steven R. Monroe. Based upon MEIR ZARCHI's 1978 film DAY OF THE WOMAN. From start to finish I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE will leave you breathless and perhaps haunt you for days.This entire movie is about rape/revenge... It's all pretty super unrealistic in a fantasy sense. Enough cannot be said about the originality and double standard of this films message upon its viewers. Anyone of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE'S detractors should wake up and smell the coffee; the best plot, pacing and special effects I have seen in the horror genre in a while, especially because it is a remake. I just watched this on Blu-Ray and I have two words for ya... ""HOLY S---!"" While this movie lacks in shock value during Jennifer's brutal rape scenes from the original; it makes up for this with Jennifer's Revenge scenes and it accomplishes this in spaids! Most importantly this movie provoked much thought and even as a ""horror gore-hound"" had me like the creative kill scenes; while I was cheering for Jennifer I felt a sense of guilt for doing so. They did a really good job and I couldn't have been less or more enthusiastic about what these filmmakers did for a fairly stagnant movie comparing this to the original is pointless... Or is it?I wonder what I would have thought of this if I had never seen the original. I watched this film with a close friend of mine and he reacted just as I suspected he would. Laughter and ""tough talk"" ensued during Jennifer's rape but total confliction and disagree with what Jennifer did and suddenly it wasn't so funny... Hah, ha, ha, haaa. The original is nothing more than a sexploitation film and hardly was anything ""scary"". The remake actually made me feel nervous or apprehensive to imagine what Jennifer would do next. It does take the entire ""underground"" thrill away from the original; before it was rare to find someone who had seen it. Now ""I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE"" should be a mainstream success. This could have been ruined if it were any more sexploitive than it is. The movie worked for me on a very deep emotional level.Jennifer is quite the dominatrix type and could it be that that's what those men were lacking to begin with? They needed a woman to treat them like the dogs they were or could this just be my own point of view based on a sub-conscience fantasy of my own? Let's be honest here... While I don't enjoy rape all of my male friends agree there is something darkly humorous and slightly enjoyable about watching someone get bent over a rock and sodomized while one of the attackers sets back and plays the harmonica. That is if they're all being honest. Something can be said about a man's primal instinct to laugh or secretly enjoy the sensational sexual situations and then be chastised as a viewer for feeling that way later. Anyone EVER having had thoughts like these and it forces the viewer to see this from a male and female point of view. So, what lets all of us overly aggressive males off the hook? Jennifer's over aggressive retribution. A retribution that is an over dramatized version of every woman who has been raped, ultimate fantasy, regarding revenge against her attacker(s). NONE of this movie is very ""believable"". I'm not so sure I agree with Jennifer's methods here on a moral level even as a victim. Hearing someone say ""help me Jesus"" would be enough for me to show at least some level of mercy even with a quick bullet to the head. How anyone could live with the guilt of having been so sadistic in the method of rape or revenge the way Jennifer or those men did is unfathomable and it reduces Jennifer to a mere sick and twisted killer like her attackers and nothing more. So what if you think this movie is nothing more than arbitrary filth? What a powerful feeling it is to disagree.It wasn't hard for me to quickly appreciate the effort put into making a ""good"" rape/revenge movie. Awesome kill scenes in this remake and this is where the original lacks. Complex on a strictly imaginative and ingenious level because the kill scenes were something I have not seen before this movie. However, shock value could have been intensified I feel by including more of a sexploitive approach like that of the original because we are living in a sexually desensitized world and I doubt much more than a muffled ""oh my god"" would be heard by the viewers. This would have left me with a greater appreciation for what JENNIFER did and perhaps in some ways justified her decision to enact her twisted revenge. Jennifer is every mans worst nightmare and I absolutely love what this fresh new filmmaker did for this movie. That being said... IT'S ALL IN THE SCRIPT and I absolutely loved it!",5,Pink is my favorite color.

That means that 330 people wasted a couple hours of their lives watching this reprehensible garbage.OK, you ask, why did I watch it? Well, I am a curious person. Roger Ebert's scathing review of the original 1978 film intrigued me, I thought, how vile can a film possibly be? So I watched it and was nauseated throughout--I guess it was the same kind of morbid curiosity that makes us slow down and stare at a traffic accident.I forgot about it and relegated it to the trash. Then I heard about the re-make.Well, the morbid curiosity set in again, so I once again subjected myself to this brainless crap. I should have known better. The remake is better filmed and better acted than the original, and it introduces another bad guy--the Sheriff. The violence is much more graphic than the original, thanks to new technology. So what we have here is an updated, higher tech version of the same reprehensible garbage.I don't buy all the nonsense about how the original director in 1978 wanted to make some kind of feminist statement about rape victims. He made a statement about nothing. He simply capitalized on the fact that people will watch the most disgusting, perverse human behavior because they find it entertaining.The director of the 2010 re-make is doubly culpable because there was no reason in the world to resurrect this monstrosity, other than capitalizing on the sensationalism of the original, and making the violence more graphic just adds to the nausea.Now, I understand that there's a sequel to the 2010 re-make.

She hopes the attraction of peace and quiet will inspire her writing.  What she does attract is a quartet of mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging rednecks. She is pounced upon and beaten and raped mercilessly numerous times in one afternoon and they leave her bruised and bloody on her cabin floor.  After she heals she doesn't get mad-she gets even and wreaks bloody vengeance on the knuckle-draggers.  It was these scenes of revenge that were noted by critics as vile, disgusting and loathsome.The remake follows the same story with some major tweaks including the quartet is now a quintet.  The payback scenes are even more graphic than the original including a new way one of the attackers loses his family jewels.  The movie is sometimes hard to watch, the just desserts handed to the rapists is easy to watch, and after all it's only a movie and considering the real world we now live in these monsters are often treated as mis-understood by bleeding heart liberal judges and if these creeps had ever gone to trial they probably would have received a slap on the wrist.

She survives, but decided it's not justice she wants, it's revenge.

I've seen both the original and the sequel.  The original movie was about the 3 rapes that take place and how brutal and degrading they were.  The revenge for the rapes was an afterthought for the script-writters because the way the revenge killings take place makes so scence what so ever.  Would you expected a woman you rapped to offer to take a bath with you?  The sequel has two rape seqeunces, which are also brutal and degrading, but after the rapes takes place the revenge killings are geared toward killing the rapeists in the same way that they partisipated in the rapes.  SPOILER ALERT...I will now reveal how one of the murders takes place.  Durring the rape, one of the hillbillies is always using his camera to film what is going on.  To exact her revenge on this individual, the victim/murderer first knocks the rapeist out.  When he awakens, he finds himself duct taped to a tree.  At this point, she takes his camcorder and turns the screen around so that he can see him self because ""he likes to watch"", now that he can see himself she uses fish-hooks to attach his eye-lids to eye-brows so that he can not blink and has no choice but to watch himself on the camcorder screen.  She then guts a fish and smears the innards all over the hillbillies clothes and face.  The hillbilliy dies when blackbirds show up and start eating the fish innards and in the process pull out the hillbillies eyes.What makes the sequel better than the original is the inventive nature of how the victim kills her rapists.  In my opionion the final killing is probably the most inventive because it is a 2 for 1 killing (two rapists killed simoltaniously).  I won't ruin it for you but here's a hint of how it happens.  One of the two people who die in the final death scence is the rapist who sodomized the victim and if he had kept his mouth shut the second rapist may not have gotten killed.

But even having SEEN the original didn't mean I was PREPARED for this take on the story....  If you have seen the original and thought the killings were rather Shocking, then you may not be ready for this Incarnation of this rather Tough Story...  However if you saw the original and wanted to see MORE, or see something a little more....  Brutal...  Then this is your movie...  It does take a rather Special type of person to get into this movie though, cause some of the murders are Very Viscious, and In Your Face...  Fish Hooks, Lye, then there is also the Shotgun Scene...  Trust me there is alot that will make you So Very Uneasy...  And even a couple things that will be worse for MEN to watch than others...  Believe me...  Now horror movies don't bother me, but I had to stop it at a couple times before I could get all the way through it...  I have to say that the director's choice to add a Sheriff into the mix of the Perpetrators is enough to make you a little uneasy, cause when you see a cop on screen in a movie it gives you a ""Safe Place"" that you can retreat to and say ""Everything is going to be alright.  The Police are there"", but that isn't the case in this movie, Believe me...  The director choosing to do this adds an even more Intense feeling to this movie...  If you have Nerves of Steel, a Strong Stomach then you may really enjoy this movie...  Just don't think you are heading in to a Totally Pleasent Movie...  However if you have read the Description then you know it isn't Pleasent...

1380495,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0041KKYCY,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","First of all, let me warn you that this is no ordinary ""thriller"" or ""suspense."" Steven R. Monroe' remake of the1978 cult revenge film is very violent with a lengthy rape scene that goes on and on. ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is not ""Kill Bill"" where over-the-top violence is counterbalanced by dark humor and actions, and it doesn't want to be. Here the violence is raw and shocking, and it is meant that way.The story itself is very simple. A writer from a city Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) rents a cabin in the woods to write a new book. She is attacked and raped by the local men. A month later she returns to them for ultimate revenge.The film takes an extremely long time to show what happens to Jennifer, and like in a controversial French film ""Irr&eacute;versible,"" the graphic violence is something that makes you feel very uncomfortable. Also, don't expect some social messages in the grindhouse-type film. Again, whatever the film is, it is not ""The Accused"" or ""The Brave One,"" but I think you already know that.What disappointed me is the way the vengeful heroine distributes her own brand of justice. They are cruel - which is fine with me - and too elaborate, as if copying the tortures in the ""Saw"" franchise. Jennifer's transformation from a writer from a city into a killer who can create Jigsaw-like torture methods is not very convincing, especially after seeing the heroine's realistic rape and humiliation scenes. And ... how did she survive in the woods (without being seen) for such a long time?""I Spit on Your Grave"" is a repulsive film.

But i must say that this remake may be even better than first film staring the most beautiful camille keaton. I and some buddies of mine left the drive-in holding onto our manhoods hoping that they were still there?? The 2010 remake surpasses the first one by far. the most beautiful and talented sarah butler did a fantastic job with her acting in the newer version. A lot of the scenes in the newer version were a little hard to watch as to what these scumbags did to this innocent girl, but when she takes revenge on these lowlifes, they finally get what they well deserved. the sheriff in this film was equally just as bad gets what's coming to him also. Seeing this cute and innocent girl being molested and stripped was enough to make anybody squirm in their seats. You can tell she is traumatized by what happens to her when she wanders through the woods half naked in a stupor. but when she regains her mental state of mind... ahh revenge comes quickly and deadly. i found myself wanting to yell at her.. cheering her on when she takes revenge on these sick scumbags. considering the perverse storyline and graphic nature of the film, i think all male and female actors did a quite remarkable job portraying their characters. I can really say that after watching this movie it sticks in your memory and makes you wonder about what people would do if presented with the same sort of circumstances. after watching this remake i now am interested if there will be a newer film with sarah butler and some of the same actors, maybe with a little less graphic stuff. overall a great film, and one sure that will long be remembered.",5,Great remake of a drive-in Revenge Classic,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,1809,"['Hmmm', 'watching', 'first', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'back', 'local', 'drive-in', 'early', '70', 'i', 'was', 'little', 'dubious', 'remake', 'would', 'come', 'even', 'close', 'classic', 'revenge', 'film..', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'remake', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'staring', 'most', 'beautiful', 'camille', 'keaton', 'buddies', 'mine', 'left', 'drive-in', 'holding', 'manhoods', 'hoping', 'were', 'still', '2010', 'remake', 'first', 'one', 'far', 'most', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'sarah', 'butler', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'acting', 'newer', 'version', 'lot', 'scenes', 'newer', 'version', 'were', 'little', 'hard', 'watch', 'what', 'scumbags', 'did', 'innocent', 'girl', 'when', 'revenge', 'lowlifes', 'finally', 'get', 'what', 'well', 'deserved', 'sheriff', 'film', 'was', 'equally', 'just', 'bad', 'what', 'coming', 'also', 'Seeing', 'cute', 'innocent', 'girl', 'being', 'molested', 'stripped', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'anybody', 'squirm', 'seats', 'can', 'tell', 'traumatized', 'what', 'when', 'woods', 'half', 'naked', 'stupor', 'when', 'mental', 'state', 'mind', 'ahh', 'revenge', 'quickly', 'deadly', 'i', 'found', 'wanting', 'yell', 'her..', 'cheering', 'when', 'revenge', 'sick', 'scumbags', 'considering', 'perverse', 'storyline', 'graphic', 'nature', 'film', 'i', 'think', 'male', 'female', 'actors', 'did', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'watching', 'movie', 'memory', 'wonder', 'what', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'presented', 'same', 'sort', 'circumstances', 'watching', 'remake', 'i', 'now', 'am', 'interested', 'will', 'be', 'newer', 'film', 'sarah', 'butler', 'same', 'actors', 'maybe', 'little', 'less', 'graphic', 'stuff', 'overall', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'sure', 'will', 'long', 'be', 'remembered']",N/A

Monroe's harrowing remake of 'I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE'.  Since the original was made during the upheaval of the seventies with the Vietnam war and the cinemas changing persona, the grit and grain upgraded Zarchi's low budget entry into cult classic status.  Now in the modern age of the 'SAW' and 'HOSTEL' franchises not to mention the remake of 'LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT', his vision was ripe for a definitive version.  All the harrowing traumas of the original are given detail that could never have been dreamed of in the seventies.  Now we have cam-corders filming Jennifer Hill's rape and also her filming one of her episodes of revenge.  Computers and cellphones are also in the picture but the real improvement is the background development of each of the protaganists making Jennifer's retaliation all the more deserved.  Sarah Butler as Jennifer is not as gritty as Camille Keaton's original performance but it definitely gets the job done.  Warning, to viewers who have not seen the original, this is pretty strong stuff including the violation of Jennifer's character so be warned.  As far as remakes go, this is one of the best and since Meir Zarchi also has an executive producers credit, he should be comfortable in knowing that his vision has finally been fulfilled in all of its blood soaked glory.
