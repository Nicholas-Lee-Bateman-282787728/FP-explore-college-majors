933427,A2XK9W52YI1HQR,B000ATQYVK,Craig Gustafson,"[8, 10]","For me, any review of ""Once Upon a Mattress"" is a matter of how it stacks up to previous versions. ""Mattress"" was the second musical I ever saw performed on stage when I was a kid. In my twenties, I played Sextimus. I saw the 1972 version on TV (and recently acquired a copy; it doesn't age well) and found the 1964 TV version on eBay -- that is the best version, with an unexpected song and dance routine from Elliott Gould, who is light on his feet and sounds like an American Anthony Newley.This new version, to use my wife's assessment, is too Disneyfied. It's just OK when it could have been fabulous. It's polite when it should be raucous. Too many gags are blown because they toned down the delivery for film. Also, the secondary parts have been reduced to almost nothing. The Jester's role is so slivered that I wonder why he's in the film.Tracey Ullman: Very good as Winnifred, but held back. Her British accent in the part is fine, since it establishes her as a foreigner in the kingdom. And she IS supposed to come from a marshland swamp in a northern kingdom.Dennis O'Hare: Good acting as Dauntless, sloppy diction when singing.Carol Burnett: Here's the main problem -- she's excellent (especially with the new song written for this version), but restrained. Aggravain is written to be bombastic and overpowering.Tom Smothers: Very good as the King, but again, this is a part that has been played by Buster Keaton. It was written as basically being a medieval Harpo Marx. All of the girl-chasing has been excised. He's very mellow and charming, but mellow doesn't do it for me with this part. He was fine for ""Man to Man Talk"". Smothers was as wonderful as he was allowed to be by the director.Matthew Morrison: Again, a cartoon part played too realistically. But Morrison was very good, and sang very well.Zooey Deschanel: I liked her. Her voice was beautiful (her diction was sloppy.) She acted rings around Bernadette Peters in the 1972 version. But the problem with a more down-to-earth Lady Larken is that what attracts Dauntless to Winnifred is the fact that Winnifred is the very first down-to-earth girl he's ever met.Michael Boatman: As the Jester - probably a good actor, but who knows from this? The part was cut to a point where he was a glorified extra.Edward Hibbert: Disneyfied in a politically correct way -- instead of obviously being the Queen's lover-on-the-side, here the Wizard is an old drag queen -- LITERALLY, when he's playing the Nightingale.The director blew the end of the curse. It's a standard comedy Rule of Three:Jester: Look... the Queen can't talk!King: (struggling) I...(court is breathless)King: (struggling harder) I...(court is breathless)King: (smiling) I can!(court cheers!)Here, the director had Tom Smothers in the background saying (very quietly), ""I... I can talk. I can talk."" Completely killed the bit.The pantomime with Winnifred trying to get to sleep was rushed into, then screwed up with bad camera cuts.""The Spanish Panic"" is a choreographer's Mount Everest. This choreographer fell off the mountain halfway up.Much of the material holds up (when the director has the faith to let the cast deliver it properly) and the songs are still charming.  To address a previous reviewer's plea of ""Can't anyone just have FUN anymore????????""  Well, yes -- which is why I resent not having much of it with this movie.  It wasn't that much fun.The nice thing will be if kids like it enough to seek out other, better movies of musicals, or to audition for this one when their local theater does it, just because they remember liking this one.",3,It's a Question of Stack-Up (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,3592,"['review', 'Once', 'Mattress', 'matter', 'how', 'up', 'previous', 'versions', 'Mattress', 'was', 'second', 'musical', 'ever', 'saw', 'performed', 'stage', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'twenties', 'played', 'Sextimus', 'saw', '1972', 'version', 'TV', 'recently', 'acquired', 'copy', ""n't"", 'age', 'well', 'found', '1964', 'TV', 'version', 'eBay', 'best', 'version', 'unexpected', 'song', 'dance', 'routine', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'who', 'light', 'feet', 'sounds', 'American', 'Anthony', 'Newley.This', 'new', 'version', 'use', 'wife', 'assessment', 'too', 'Disneyfied', 'just', 'OK', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fabulous', 'polite', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'raucous', 'Too', 'many', 'gags', 'are', 'blown', 'toned', 'down', 'delivery', 'film', 'Also', 'secondary', 'parts', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Jester', 'role', 'so', 'slivered', 'wonder', 'why', 'film.Tracey', 'Ullman', 'Very', 'good', 'Winnifred', 'held', 'back', 'British', 'accent', 'part', 'fine', 'foreigner', 'kingdom', 'supposed', 'come', 'marshland', 'swamp', 'northern', 'kingdom.Dennis', ""O'Hare"", 'Good', 'acting', 'Dauntless', 'sloppy', 'diction', 'when', 'singing.Carol', 'Burnett', 'Here', 'main', 'problem', 'excellent', 'especially', 'new', 'song', 'written', 'version', 'restrained', 'Aggravain', 'written', 'be', 'bombastic', 'overpowering.Tom', 'Smothers', 'Very', 'good', 'King', 'again', 'part', 'been', 'played', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'was', 'written', 'basically', 'being', 'medieval', 'Harpo', 'Marx', 'girl-chasing', 'been', 'excised', 'very', 'mellow', 'charming', 'mellow', ""n't"", 'do', 'part', 'was', 'fine', 'Man', 'Man', 'Talk', 'Smothers', 'was', 'as', 'wonderful', 'was', 'allowed', 'be', 'director.Matthew', 'Morrison', 'Again', 'cartoon', 'part', 'played', 'too', 'realistically', 'Morrison', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'sang', 'very', 'well.Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'liked', 'voice', 'was', 'beautiful', 'diction', 'was', 'sloppy', 'acted', 'rings', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', '1972', 'version', 'problem', 'more', 'down-to-earth', 'Lady', 'Larken', 'what', 'Dauntless', 'Winnifred', 'fact', 'Winnifred', 'very', 'first', 'down-to-earth', 'girl', 'ever', 'met.Michael', 'Boatman', 'Jester', 'probably', 'good', 'actor', 'who', 'part', 'was', 'cut', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'glorified', 'extra.Edward', 'Hibbert', 'Disneyfied', 'politically', 'correct', 'way', 'instead', 'obviously', 'being', 'Queen', 'lover-on-the-side', 'here', 'Wizard', 'old', 'drag', 'queen', 'LITERALLY', 'when', 'playing', 'Nightingale.The', 'director', 'blew', 'end', 'curse', 'standard', 'comedy', 'Rule', 'Three', 'Jester', 'Look', 'Queen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'King', 'struggling', 'court', 'breathless', 'King', 'struggling', 'harder', 'court', 'breathless', 'King', 'smiling', 'can', 'court', 'cheers', 'Here', 'director', 'had', 'Tom', 'Smothers', 'background', 'saying', 'very', 'quietly', 'can', 'talk', 'can', 'talk', 'Completely', 'killed', 'bit.The', 'pantomime', 'Winnifred', 'trying', 'get', 'sleep', 'was', 'rushed', 'then', 'screwed', 'up', 'bad', 'camera', 'cuts', 'Spanish', 'Panic', 'choreographer', 'Mount', 'Everest', 'choreographer', 'fell', 'off', 'mountain', 'halfway', 'up.Much', 'material', 'up', 'when', 'director', 'faith', 'let', 'cast', 'deliver', 'properly', 'songs', 'are', 'still', 'charming', 'address', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'plea', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'just', 'have', 'FUN', 'anymore', 'Well', 'yes', 'why', 'resent', 'not', 'having', 'much', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'fun.The', 'nice', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'kids', 'enough', 'seek', 'out', 'other', 'better', 'movies', 'musicals', 'audition', 'one', 'when', 'local', 'theater', 'just', 'remember', 'liking', 'one']",Once Upon A Mattress
933428,A8MVGWI5ZKNQ5,B000ATQYVK,Daisy Brambletoes,"[2, 5]","I fell in love with this cute musical back in the 1960's when it was originally aired on TV in black & white, and loved it again ten years later when it was re-aired in color with only minor cast changes. To the many fans of this beloved play, it is impossible not to compare the new Disney version with the originals.There is much to like. The look of it is wonderful, complete with a Disneyesque rose-framed window at the end, and a castle full of beautiful, anachronistic rooms, and stained-glass windows with a slightly sinister edge to them. Prince Dauntless and the King (Tom Smothers) are likable, sympathetic, engaging people who you root for;  Sir Harry and his Lady Larken are both charming and attractive.Inevitably, though, as in all previous made-for-TV versions, certain changes in dialog and action have been made, and several songs are absent. I was a little sorry to see the jester's role so reduced (he had a fine song in the original play and the earliest TV version), but I did find it amusing that the Wizard, usually played as the Queen's lover,is this time only an effeminate court sycophant. The G-rating might have been more appropriate had Harry and Larken been secretly married as they were in the 1960's version, which actually makes more sense considering they have defied a marriage law. Otherwise, Larken's pregnancy would simply be an embarrassment instead of a crime. It would also be more suitable for the children watching this film, which after all is a prime-time Christmas offering.But I saved for last the two starring ladies. Carol Burnett should have been brilliant as the Queen, and in moments her brilliance does come through. But she needed the outrageous brassiness that Jane White once gave the role, and it wasn't quite there. Still, no one else today should play the Queen, if only for the legacy. Carol Burnett forever!I am not at all sure about Tracy Ullman as Princess Fred, though. She was not bad, she just wasn't great. Fred needs to be so much larger than life. She's not just another princess, she's the kind of princess children love because she's a princess they can hope to be like - not the perfect and pretty ladies like Snow White, Aurora, or Cinderella. Ullman is fun, she's cute, but she does not dominate the screen in the same ways that once made Carol Burnett a star. In those days, the bedroom scene was a broadly hilarious climax to a charmingly funny musical. In this production it is amusing, but little more. And for that alone,I was greatly disappointed.Yet in spite of these problems, it was a most enjoyable film. I am surprised that Disney has not tried to market it in their ""princess series"", but time will tell. It is a nice film that looks good and feels good, and to the generations who do not know the older versions, this one should be very satisfying.",4,The return of Princess Fred,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,2835,"['fell', 'love', 'cute', 'musical', 'back', '1960', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'TV', 'black', 'white', 'loved', 'again', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'was', 're-aired', 'color', 'only', 'minor', 'cast', 'changes', 'many', 'fans', 'beloved', 'play', 'impossible', 'not', 'compare', 'new', 'Disney', 'version', 'originals.There', 'much', 'like', 'look', 'wonderful', 'complete', 'Disneyesque', 'rose-framed', 'window', 'end', 'castle', 'full', 'beautiful', 'anachronistic', 'rooms', 'stained-glass', 'windows', 'slightly', 'sinister', 'edge', 'Prince', 'Dauntless', 'King', 'Tom', 'Smothers', 'are', 'likable', 'sympathetic', 'engaging', 'people', 'who', 'root', 'Sir', 'Harry', 'Lady', 'Larken', 'are', 'charming', 'attractive.Inevitably', 'though', 'previous', 'made-for-TV', 'versions', 'certain', 'changes', 'dialog', 'action', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'several', 'songs', 'are', 'absent', 'was', 'little', 'sorry', 'see', 'jester', 'role', 'so', 'reduced', 'had', 'fine', 'song', 'original', 'play', 'earliest', 'TV', 'version', 'did', 'find', 'amusing', 'Wizard', 'usually', 'played', 'Queen', 'lover', 'time', 'only', 'effeminate', 'court', 'sycophant', 'G-rating', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'had', 'Harry', 'Larken', 'been', 'secretly', 'married', 'were', '1960', 'version', 'actually', 'more', 'sense', 'considering', 'have', 'defied', 'marriage', 'law', 'Otherwise', 'Larken', 'pregnancy', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'embarrassment', 'instead', 'crime', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'more', 'suitable', 'children', 'watching', 'film', 'prime-time', 'Christmas', 'offering.But', 'saved', 'last', 'two', 'starring', 'ladies', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'Queen', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'come', 'needed', 'outrageous', 'brassiness', 'Jane', 'White', 'once', 'gave', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'Still', 'one', 'else', 'today', 'should', 'play', 'Queen', 'only', 'legacy', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'forever', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'Tracy', 'Ullman', 'Princess', 'Fred', 'though', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'Fred', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'larger', 'life', 'not', 'just', 'princess', 'kind', 'princess', 'children', 'love', 'princess', 'can', 'hope', 'be', 'not', 'perfect', 'pretty', 'ladies', 'Snow', 'White', 'Aurora', 'Cinderella', 'Ullman', 'fun', 'cute', 'not', 'dominate', 'screen', 'same', 'ways', 'once', 'made', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'star', 'days', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'was', 'broadly', 'hilarious', 'climax', 'charmingly', 'funny', 'musical', 'production', 'amusing', 'little', 'more', 'alone', 'was', 'greatly', 'disappointed.Yet', 'spite', 'problems', 'was', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'am', 'surprised', 'Disney', 'not', 'tried', 'market', 'princess', 'series', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'nice', 'film', 'good', 'feels', 'good', 'generations', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'older', 'versions', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'satisfying']",Once Upon A Mattress

933430,A1AELZTSDQ6R5Y,B000ATQYVK,"David Sale ""Make Mine Musicals!""","[7, 9]","For anyone who loves the original Broadway cast recording, this DVD version fails miserably in all departments.  It is miscast, badly directed, and boringly choreographed.  The role of the Princess needs a belter.  That's the whole core of this musical.  Ullman is not a belter and is also too old for the part.  The supporting roles seemed to be scaled to her inadequacies, as we are also served a middle-aged, dull and pathetic Prince Dauntless.  As for the young lovers, they were dull to begin with, so they come out fine.  Curiously, Carol Burnett whose debut performance in the original shot her to stardom, is less than impressive as the Queen.  While the part does invite some ripe overplaying, unlike the lady in the original Broadway cast who managed to bring a little subtle fun to the role, Ms Burnett has about as much subtlety as Godzilla and her overbearing presence actually unbalances this already weak production.  As she chews up the scenery (which looks like styrofoam, anyway)and forcibly intrudes on scenes she wasn't meant to be in, one gets the unpleasant feeling that, despite relinquishing the starring role, Ms Burnett still has the urge to dominate.  What is it with these hitherto wonderful funny ladies in later life?  (Think Lucille Ball in ""Mame"").  All their innate skills appear to become subordinate to a manic ego.  And believe me, I'm a Carol Burnett fan about everything she did until this!  My two stars are for the delightful score, which even this lousy treatment doesn't quite diminish.  Frankly, my advice is to skip it and if you're a fan or just curious, buy the original Broadway cast CD.",2,A total disappointment,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1634,"['anyone', 'who', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'recording', 'DVD', 'version', 'miserably', 'departments', 'miscast', 'badly', 'directed', 'boringly', 'choreographed', 'role', 'Princess', 'belter', 'whole', 'core', 'musical', 'Ullman', 'not', 'belter', 'also', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'supporting', 'roles', 'seemed', 'be', 'scaled', 'inadequacies', 'are', 'also', 'served', 'middle-aged', 'dull', 'pathetic', 'Prince', 'Dauntless', 'young', 'lovers', 'were', 'dull', 'begin', 'come', 'out', 'fine', 'Curiously', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'debut', 'performance', 'original', 'shot', 'stardom', 'less', 'impressive', 'Queen', 'part', 'invite', 'ripe', 'overplaying', 'lady', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'who', 'managed', 'bring', 'little', 'subtle', 'fun', 'role', 'Ms', 'Burnett', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'subtlety', 'Godzilla', 'overbearing', 'presence', 'actually', 'already', 'weak', 'production', 'scenery', 'styrofoam', 'anyway', 'forcibly', 'intrudes', 'scenes', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'one', 'unpleasant', 'feeling', 'relinquishing', 'starring', 'role', 'Ms', 'Burnett', 'still', 'urge', 'dominate', 'What', 'hitherto', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'ladies', 'later', 'life', 'Think', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Mame', 'innate', 'skills', 'appear', 'become', 'subordinate', 'manic', 'ego', 'believe', ""'m"", 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'fan', 'everything', 'did', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'delightful', 'score', 'even', 'lousy', 'treatment', ""n't"", 'quite', 'diminish', 'Frankly', 'advice', 'skip', ""'re"", 'fan', 'just', 'curious', 'buy', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'CD']",Once Upon A Mattress

933434,AB9Q52OYE7E6N,B000ATQYVK,"G. Schneider ""old movie buff""","[31, 36]","My first question is Why? Why bother going to such expense and effort to bring this old chestnut to the screen (TV, that is)? It was never a GREAT musical to begin with. But on the other hand, I'm glad they did, because, as a former musical director, I have conducted and played this show several times. The last time was over 30 years ago, so it was wonderful to see and hear it again after all this time.There have been complaints that the songs aren't memorable. (One reviewed didn't like them so he/she fast-forwarded through them. That's a wonderful way to get to know a song!) The songs are indeed memorable, and quite tuneful. Mary Rodgers, Richard's daughter, did a wonderful job...better, in fact, than her father was doing about that time. And the lyrics are very clever. ""Sensitivity"" in 5/4 time is a tour-de-force of writing and performing. I was sorry they cut ""Very Soft Shoes,"" the jester's song. And ""An Opening for a Princess."" I missed that, too.The casting was either good or inspired...mostly. Matthew Morrison and Zooey Deschanel as the young lovers are rather wimpy, to the point of who care if they get married or split or what. But just about everyone else was magnificent. The jester (Michael Boatman) was too good to have had ""Very Soft Shoes"" taken from him. Tom Smothers, a real treat, was wonderful to watch. His pantomime and facial expressions were delightful. Denis O'Hare grew on me. Not being a TV freak, I wasn't familiar with him. Tracey Ullman was fine, if a little long in the tooth for the part. (Then again, one of the productions of the show I did starred Imogene Coca in the part, and she was in her 60s then!) As for Carol Burnett, she was fantastic, totally over the top! She graduated from the princess to the queen perfectly. (Imogene should have had such luck!) Unfortunately, a song was added for her, which did nothing to distinguish itself other than quote Winnifred's ""Happily Ever After,"" a theatrical no-no. (Fred's song was a soliloquy. How or why would the queen sing the same thing?)The production values were very high.

In this story, the beautiful but diabolical Queen Aggravain(Carol Burnett) does her darndest to prevent her son Prince Dauntless(Denis O'Hare) from getting married, therefore, the entire kingdom cannot be wed until the Prince does, and that makes life miserable for Sir Harry(Matthew Morrison) and his sweetheart Lady Larken(Zooey Deschanel). Then one day, an unusual and unconventional princess named Winifred(Tracey Ullman), or ""Fred"" for short, has arrived, and soon, Dauntless is swooned by ""Fred"". so Aggravain will do anything to stop the wedding, so she put ""Fred"" to a test, by letting ""Fred"" sleeping on twenty mattresses for one night, but there's a catch, The ever-scheming Queen placed a pea inside the bedding. Tom Smothers, Edward Hibbert and Michael Boatman also stars in this wonderfully hilarious comedy. The special features includes a behind-the-scenes look of the movie, a blooper reel featuring on-set laughs and sneak peeks of other Disney favourites like the Proud Family Movie, Kronk's New Groove and Valiant.

This would be a pretty good show for people who haven't seen the stage version.  However, for those of us who have this show was terrible.  It took the minstrel out of the show and he has some of the best songs along with the jester and the King.  I hated how they gave Normandy to Sir Harry and Larkin and took out Yesterday I Loved You, Opening For a Princess, The King, the Jester and I and Very Soft Shoes.Then onto the songs they did have...I guess they were all right.  The actors were okay singers, nothing too amazing though.  The part I hated most was the newly created song for Carol Burnett.  It was awful.  Princess Fred should have been younger and her accent was dredful and didn't really fit at all.  She really couldn't sing very well which makes me wonder why she got the role in the first place.It's nice to see this wonderful musical on TV, but I would say do yourself a favor and see the ""real"" version of it on stage.  When my high school did it it was stunning and we interpreted some of the lines quiet differently and added little things to make the performance more unique and special.

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","In former days, that is to say, once upon a time, Jay Thompson, Marshall Barer, and Dean Fuller decided to turn the fairy tale of ""The Princess and the Pea"" into a musical called ""Once Upon a Mattress.""  It premiered off-Broadway in 1959 and made a star of Carol Burnett, who took the show to Broadway.  In 1964 Burnett starred in the first television production of the show with Joseph Bova as the prince and did another production in 1972 opposite Ken Berry.  Both times Jane White and Jack Gilford played the queen and king, while the first production had Elliott Gould and Shani Wallis, the second offered Wally Cox and Bernadette Peters.  Now for the holiday season in 2005 television offers a third production of the musical, still with Carol Burnett, but this time with her playing the queen instead of the princess, passing the torch to Tracy Ullman, although Sarah Jessica Parker did a Broadway revival back in 1997 (both roles are for a mezzo/alto, the princess needing to sing from low B to high C# and the queen from low A to high B, so they are virtually the same vocal range).The story is set in the kingdom of King Sextimus the Silent (Tommy Smothers), a kind man who is unable to rule because a fairy gave him a curse that stops him from speaking.  In his stead Queen Aggravian (Burnett) has taken control and come up with one of those stupid rules that power mad rulers do in fairy tales that are turned into musicals.  She has decreed that no one in the kingdom can get married until her son, Prince Dauntless (Denis O'Hare), has wed, and the prince can only marry the lucky princess who can pass one of the queen's tests.  Nobody has, which is unfortunately because Lady Larken (Zooey Deschanel) is now pregnant with the baby of Sir Harry (Matthew Morrison).  Something needs to be done.  This is where Princess Winnifred the Woebegone (Ullman) enters the picture.  Prince Dauntless falls for her, even though she is painfully shy, and the only question is whether she can pass the key sensitivity test devised by the queen.Along the way Ullman gets to sing ""Shy,"" ""The Swamps of Home,"" ""Song of Love,"" and ""Happily Ever After,"" while Burnett now gets to take a crack at ""Sensitivity"" and ""Quiet.""  Burnett has fun wearing Bob Mackie gowns (who else designs these things?), Ullman brings her own brand of comedy to the role of Winnifred (who else is as wild eyed and as wacky as Burnett?).  The two best songs are given over to the second leads, who are, after all, the soprano and tenor in the show, so the knight and his lady sing ""In a Little While"" and ""Yesterday I Loved You.""  But this is a musical where the songs are cute (e.g., ""An Opening For a Princess"") and you watch this for the comedy.  No, this is not as good as Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella,"" but it was never trying to be.  If you watched this on television tonight then you should already know if you want to pick this up, otherwise you key motivation will be having fond memories of one of the earlier television productions, neither of which are currently available.",4,The third time around Carol Burnett lets Tracy Ullman climb upon the mattresses,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,3065,"['former', 'days', 'say', 'once', 'time', 'Jay', 'Thompson', 'Marshall', 'Barer', 'Dean', 'Fuller', 'decided', 'turn', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Princess', 'Pea', 'musical', 'called', 'Once', 'Mattress', 'premiered', 'off-Broadway', '1959', 'made', 'star', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'who', 'took', 'show', 'Broadway', '1964', 'Burnett', 'starred', 'first', 'television', 'production', 'show', 'Joseph', 'Bova', 'prince', 'did', 'production', '1972', 'opposite', 'Ken', 'Berry', 'Both', 'times', 'Jane', 'White', 'Jack', 'Gilford', 'played', 'queen', 'king', 'first', 'production', 'had', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'Shani', 'Wallis', 'second', 'offered', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Now', 'holiday', 'season', '2005', 'television', 'third', 'production', 'musical', 'still', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'time', 'playing', 'queen', 'instead', 'princess', 'passing', 'torch', 'Tracy', 'Ullman', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'did', 'Broadway', 'revival', 'back', '1997', 'roles', 'are', 'mezzo/alto', 'princess', 'needing', 'sing', 'low', 'B', 'high', 'C', 'queen', 'low', 'high', 'B', 'are', 'virtually', 'same', 'vocal', 'range', '.The', 'story', 'set', 'kingdom', 'King', 'Sextimus', 'Silent', 'Tommy', 'Smothers', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'unable', 'rule', 'fairy', 'gave', 'curse', 'speaking', 'stead', 'Queen', 'Aggravian', 'Burnett', 'taken', 'control', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'stupid', 'rules', 'power', 'mad', 'rulers', 'do', 'fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'turned', 'musicals', 'decreed', 'one', 'kingdom', 'can', 'get', 'married', 'son', 'Prince', 'Dauntless', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'wed', 'prince', 'can', 'only', 'marry', 'lucky', 'princess', 'who', 'can', 'pass', 'one', 'queen', 'tests', 'Nobody', 'unfortunately', 'Lady', 'Larken', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'now', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'Sir', 'Harry', 'Matthew', 'Morrison', 'Something', 'needs', 'be', 'done', 'where', 'Princess', 'Winnifred', 'Woebegone', 'Ullman', 'picture', 'Prince', 'Dauntless', 'even', 'painfully', 'shy', 'only', 'question', 'can', 'pass', 'key', 'sensitivity', 'test', 'devised', 'queen.Along', 'way', 'Ullman', 'sing', 'Shy', 'Swamps', 'Home', 'Song', 'Love', 'Happily', 'Ever', 'Burnett', 'now', 'take', 'crack', 'Sensitivity', 'Quiet', 'Burnett', 'fun', 'wearing', 'Bob', 'Mackie', 'gowns', 'who', 'else', 'things', 'Ullman', 'own', 'brand', 'comedy', 'role', 'Winnifred', 'who', 'else', 'wild', 'eyed', 'as', 'wacky', 'Burnett', 'two', 'best', 'songs', 'are', 'given', 'second', 'leads', 'who', 'are', 'soprano', 'tenor', 'show', 'knight', 'lady', 'sing', 'Little', 'Yesterday', 'Loved', 'musical', 'where', 'songs', 'are', 'cute', 'e.g.', 'Opening', 'Princess', 'watch', 'comedy', 'No', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'Cinderella', 'was', 'never', 'trying', 'be', 'watched', 'television', 'tonight', 'then', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'otherwise', 'key', 'motivation', 'will', 'be', 'having', 'fond', 'memories', 'one', 'earlier', 'television', 'productions', 'are', 'currently', 'available']",Once Upon A Mattress

His one desire is to marry, but his mother (Carol Burnett) has no desire to see her only son married, so she has devised a series of tests that any bride-to-be must pass before she marry the prince.  Officially, they are to keep the bloodline pure by making sure Dauntless marries only a true prince.  Of course, they are so hard that no person would ever be able to pass them.The prince's unmarried state also weighs heavily on the rest of the court, for the queen has decreeded that no one may marry before the prince does.This especially hits close to home for Lady Larkin (Zooey Deschanel) and Sir Harry (Matthew Morrison).  Not only have they fallen in love, but they are expecting.  In order to keep Lady Larkin from being exiled in shame, Harry heads out to find the perfect princess.Who he comes back with is Princess Winnifred (Tracey Ullman).  At first glance, she seems to be the worst princess yet with her brashness and klutziness.  The Prince is immediately smitten with her, but the queen devises her most fiendish plan yet.  A true princess would notice a pea hidden under a pile of mattresses, right?  Will the Prince ever get married?I've heard of this musical for years, but had never seen it until this version came out.  It's a fun retelling of the classic fairytale of ""The Princess and the Pea.""  Humor abounds and I laughed the entire way through.  Carol Burnett originated the roll of Princess Winnifred, but here she really digs her teeth into the roll of the queen, making her appearances on screen very memorable.  Tracey Ullman also steals scenes are Winnifred.There were a few things that put me off a little.  Most noticeably, the prince and princess are much older then I thought they would be.  It adds a creepiness to the relationship between the prince and the queen.  The song ""Man to Man Talk,"" while not having anything offensive in it, will certainly lead to questions from curious kids who don't know about the ""facts of life.""  I was surprised it was present in a musical always marketed toward families.Of course, the thing that makes or breaks a musical is the musical numbers.  There were several memberable songs here, most notably ""Shy,"" which Tracey Ullman does an excellent job belting out.  Her ""Happily Ever After"" was a nice tender song while ""Song of Love"" is very funny.  With the exception of the wonderful ""Spanish Panic,"" the dance numbers weren't quite as inventive as I would have liked, but they were enjoyable as well.Rushed out after the movie ran on TV, the DVD has only a couple behind the scenes featurettes to its credit.  Nice, but nothing to get excited about.Since I have never seen another version, I can't compare this to other portrayals and have no opinion on songs that got left out of the show.

933445,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000ATQYVK,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 2]","Disney brings the 1959 off-Broadway-to-Broadway hit retelling of The Princess and the Pea back to the small screen with their 2005 feature adaptation of ""Once Upon a Mattress"", and if you're a fan of musical fairytales at all, you should be fully delighted by it! Carol Burnett is back in the cast too, only now she takes up the role of controlling Queen Aggravain, who refuses to accept any princesses vying for her son's hand as worthy to marry the not-getting-any-younger prince. Denis O'Hare plays Prince Dauntless to manchild perfection here, evoking thoughts of the great Ken Berry, while modern comedy queen Tracey Ullman aptly takes up the role living legend Burnett originated, the ungraceful but winning Princess Winnifred. Also on hand in this well-cast version are charming Tom Smothers as the silent King Sextimus, cursed to be mute until ""the mouse devours the hawk"", Michael Boatman as the Jester who speaks for him, Edward Hibbert as the Wizard who assists the Queen in her schemes, and Matthew Morrison as Sir Harry and the beautiful Zooey Deschanel as Lady Larkin, a couple who must help the prince finally wed so that they may get married themselves. You see, there is a law in the land that no one can marry until the prince does, even though the Queen seems dead-set against that, and this is especially bad for Lady Larkin, who now finds herself a mother-to-be.And that last plot point illustrates that there is a tad bit of raciness to this story for something carrying the Disney moniker, let alone a musical fairytale as such. Nevertheless, it isn't overplayed, in my opinion (you might have to be a Disney fanatic like myself to achieve any initial shock by it at all), and in truth, as much as I adore Zooey and her singing voice (she and her voice are as lovely as can be in this one), she and Morrison seem to fall into the background a bit upon initial viewings, surrounded by such bold, comedic personalities in the other roles. This film is definitely for fans of Burnett, Ullman, and O'Hare, who are a treat throughout. The songs are all very enjoyable too, and while they are not instantly memorable, some repeat viewings will surely cause some to stick for you, and this IS a film one can watch over and over. It's not one of the most oft performed shows in the country for nothin'! So, if you are a fan of musicals, fairytales, or anyone in this cast, and especially if you grew up on those old Cannon Movie Tales from the '80's Disney Channel as I did, you really should pick this one up! I don't think you'll regret it! Bonus features on this enhanced widescreen DVD include a nice Making-Of featurette with some insight into the play's history, some Behind the Scenes outtake footage, and a couple of rehearsal to film comparisons of the musical numbers ""Shy"" and ""In a Little While"". Now, I have read some complaints about songs from the original play not being included in this TV incarnation, so there is the downside that will appear for some longtime fans, but if you are new to the show, it won't be a problem and you'll be in for a well-paced, entertaining fairytale treat that so many of us missed on its quiet TV and DVD debuts!",5,An Easily Overlooked Delight!,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,3176,"['Disney', '1959', 'off-Broadway-to-Broadway', 'hit', 'retelling', 'Princess', 'Pea', 'back', 'small', 'screen', '2005', 'feature', 'adaptation', 'Once', 'Mattress', ""'re"", 'fan', 'musical', 'fairytales', 'should', 'be', 'fully', 'delighted', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'back', 'cast', 'too', 'only', 'now', 'up', 'role', 'controlling', 'Queen', 'Aggravain', 'who', 'accept', 'princesses', 'vying', 'son', 'hand', 'worthy', 'marry', 'not-getting-any-younger', 'prince', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'Prince', 'Dauntless', 'manchild', 'perfection', 'here', 'evoking', 'thoughts', 'great', 'Ken', 'Berry', 'modern', 'comedy', 'queen', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'aptly', 'up', 'role', 'living', 'legend', 'Burnett', 'originated', 'ungraceful', 'winning', 'Princess', 'Winnifred', 'Also', 'hand', 'well-cast', 'version', 'are', 'charming', 'Tom', 'Smothers', 'silent', 'King', 'Sextimus', 'cursed', 'be', 'mute', 'mouse', 'hawk', 'Michael', 'Boatman', 'Jester', 'who', 'speaks', 'Edward', 'Hibbert', 'Wizard', 'who', 'Queen', 'schemes', 'Matthew', 'Morrison', 'Sir', 'Harry', 'beautiful', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Lady', 'Larkin', 'couple', 'who', 'must', 'help', 'prince', 'finally', 'wed', 'so', 'may', 'get', 'married', 'see', 'law', 'land', 'one', 'can', 'marry', 'prince', 'even', 'Queen', 'dead-set', 'especially', 'bad', 'Lady', 'Larkin', 'who', 'now', 'mother-to-be.And', 'last', 'plot', 'point', 'tad', 'bit', 'raciness', 'story', 'something', 'carrying', 'Disney', 'moniker', 'let', 'alone', 'musical', 'fairytale', 'such', 'Nevertheless', ""n't"", 'overplayed', 'opinion', 'might', 'have', 'be', 'Disney', 'fanatic', 'achieve', 'initial', 'shock', 'truth', 'as', 'much', 'adore', 'Zooey', 'singing', 'voice', 'voice', 'are', 'as', 'lovely', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'Morrison', 'seem', 'fall', 'background', 'bit', 'initial', 'viewings', 'surrounded', 'such', 'bold', 'comedic', 'personalities', 'other', 'roles', 'film', 'definitely', 'fans', 'Burnett', 'Ullman', ""O'Hare"", 'who', 'are', 'treat', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'too', 'are', 'not', 'instantly', 'memorable', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'will', 'surely', 'cause', 'stick', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'oft', 'performed', 'shows', 'country', 'nothin', 'So', 'are', 'fan', 'musicals', 'fairytales', 'anyone', 'cast', 'especially', 'grew', 'up', 'old', 'Cannon', 'Movie', 'Tales', ""'80"", 'Disney', 'Channel', 'did', 'really', 'should', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'regret', 'Bonus', 'enhanced', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'include', 'nice', 'Making-Of', 'featurette', 'insight', 'play', 'history', 'Scenes', 'outtake', 'footage', 'couple', 'rehearsal', 'film', 'comparisons', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Shy', 'Little', 'Now', 'have', 'read', 'complaints', 'songs', 'original', 'play', 'not', 'being', 'included', 'TV', 'incarnation', 'downside', 'will', 'appear', 'longtime', 'fans', 'are', 'new', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', ""'ll"", 'be', 'well-paced', 'entertaining', 'fairytale', 'treat', 'so', 'many', 'missed', 'quiet', 'TV', 'DVD']",Once Upon A Mattress

933449,A2UR32B0NZ9SGO,B000ATQYVK,"Philip ""Justin Timberwood""","[5, 7]","Wow I am amazed at how upset people get when they make changes to a musical. I think some musicals are sacred . . . I mean shows like Gypsy, Fiddler on the Roof and the Sound of Music for example are so well written they are timeless and perfect as is . . . while others don't age well (or transition well from stage to screen.) I mean Chicago the movie cut songs . . . but they kept in what would work with the concept that all musical numbers happen in Roxie's mind . . . so there is an example of good changes. I mean years ago they used to chop up musicals for no reason when they transitioned to film and they were horrible . . . such as the original movie versions of Bye Bye Birdie and Damn Yankees. I found Disney's Once Upon A mattress charming . . . they could have back off on the high gloss.  I will be the first to admit that lately Disney beats a dead horse . . . they find something that works and then kill it. I mean they pump out tons of those straight to home video dvds and most are not up to par. They had some success with stage musicals and now they are turning more movies into Broadway musicals . . . obviously some are going to work better they others. After the success of the remake of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella they have tried to duplicate it with the Music Man and Annie. The Music Man was drawn out and lack luster and Annie started off strong and then was rushed at the end. I think they hit gold with Mattress. First of all Tracey Ullman is not too old . . . the thing that makes this show funny is that the Lady Larkin and Sir Harry are more the sterotypical leads and Prince Dauntless is a momma's boy way over due and Princess Winifred is a princess that is desperate for an openning.  I though Tracy hit this right on the mark. Carol Burnett is wonderful in everything she does (I could go on forever about her) . . . she look hysterical in those costumes and added so make as the queen . . . I have heard the original cast album of the show and seen clips from the other two televsion versions and Burnett was/is wonderful as the princess . . . it is a role that will always be associated with her. I think Tracey Ullman is the only person who I could think of that could bring something new to this without harming the original . . . and she does. Sarah Jessica Parker in the revival??? what were they thinking??? It should be a comedian! I like the changes they made here . . . sorry to those who did the show . . . but the songs they cut were boring anyway. It is one thing to see a show live but when you are sitting in your living room it is easy to channel surf when it gets boring. I think the cuts made this version crisp and gave the leads more to do. I like that they added a new song for Carol and had her sing ""A princess is a delicate thing."" If you are so closed minded that you can't get the original out of your head or if you are a die hard purist of this show and can't bare watching something different because you played the jester in your middle school porduction then DON'T WATCH this! If you are a fan of Disney, Tracey Ullman, Carol Burnett, Bob Mackie or love Broadway musical and don't have any preconceived ideas about this show then I am sure you will love this version. It's great for the whole family . . . the kids will love it . . . **I am following up with more on the DVD** . . . I just bought the DVD . . . I was surprised it's in widescreen . . . it was shown on TV in full screen but was obviously filmed in widescreen . . . and it makes it even better. Plus there are some cool special features: including a brief behind the scenes look, some outtakes and you can watch two musical numbers as a split screen of the rehearsal/ finished product.",5,Musicals are like Wine . . . some age better then others!!!,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,3732,"['Wow', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'upset', 'people', 'get', 'when', 'make', 'changes', 'musical', 'think', 'musicals', 'are', 'sacred', 'mean', 'shows', 'Gypsy', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', 'Sound', 'Music', 'example', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'are', 'timeless', 'perfect', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'age', 'well', 'transition', 'well', 'stage', 'screen', 'mean', 'Chicago', 'movie', 'cut', 'songs', 'kept', 'what', 'would', 'work', 'concept', 'musical', 'numbers', 'happen', 'Roxie', 'mind', 'example', 'good', 'changes', 'mean', 'years', 'used', 'chop', 'up', 'musicals', 'reason', 'when', 'transitioned', 'film', 'were', 'horrible', 'such', 'original', 'movie', 'versions', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Birdie', 'Damn', 'Yankees', 'found', 'Disney', 'Once', 'A', 'mattress', 'charming', 'could', 'have', 'back', 'off', 'high', 'gloss', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'lately', 'Disney', 'dead', 'horse', 'find', 'something', 'then', 'kill', 'mean', 'pump', 'out', 'tons', 'straight', 'home', 'video', 'dvds', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'par', 'had', 'success', 'stage', 'musicals', 'now', 'are', 'turning', 'more', 'movies', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'obviously', 'are', 'going', 'work', 'better', 'others', 'success', 'remake', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'Cinderella', 'have', 'tried', 'duplicate', 'Music', 'Man', 'Annie', 'Music', 'Man', 'was', 'drawn', 'out', 'lack', 'luster', 'Annie', 'started', 'off', 'strong', 'then', 'was', 'rushed', 'end', 'think', 'hit', 'gold', 'Mattress', 'First', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'not', 'too', 'old', 'thing', 'show', 'Lady', 'Larkin', 'Sir', 'Harry', 'are', 'more', 'sterotypical', 'leads', 'Prince', 'Dauntless', 'momma', 'boy', 'way', 'due', 'Princess', 'Winifred', 'princess', 'desperate', 'openning', 'Tracy', 'hit', 'right', 'mark', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'wonderful', 'everything', 'could', 'go', 'forever', 'look', 'hysterical', 'costumes', 'added', 'so', 'make', 'queen', 'have', 'heard', 'original', 'cast', 'album', 'show', 'seen', 'clips', 'other', 'two', 'televsion', 'versions', 'Burnett', 'was/is', 'wonderful', 'princess', 'role', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'associated', 'think', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'think', 'could', 'bring', 'something', 'new', 'harming', 'original', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'revival', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'should', 'be', 'comedian', 'changes', 'made', 'here', 'sorry', 'who', 'did', 'show', 'songs', 'cut', 'were', 'boring', 'anyway', 'one', 'thing', 'see', 'show', 'live', 'when', 'are', 'sitting', 'living', 'room', 'easy', 'channel', 'surf', 'when', 'boring', 'think', 'cuts', 'made', 'version', 'crisp', 'gave', 'leads', 'more', 'do', 'like', 'added', 'new', 'song', 'Carol', 'had', 'sing', 'princess', 'delicate', 'thing', 'are', 'so', 'closed', 'minded', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'original', 'head', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'purist', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bare', 'watching', 'something', 'different', 'played', 'jester', 'middle', 'school', 'porduction', 'then', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WATCH', 'are', 'fan', 'Disney', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Bob', 'Mackie', 'love', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'show', 'then', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'love', 'version', 'great', 'whole', 'family', 'kids', 'will', 'love', '**I', 'am', 'following', 'up', 'more', 'DVD**', 'just', 'bought', 'DVD', 'was', 'surprised', 'widescreen', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'full', 'screen', 'was', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'widescreen', 'even', 'better', 'are', 'cool', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'brief', 'scenes', 'look', 'outtakes', 'can', 'watch', 'two', 'musical', 'numbers', 'split', 'screen', 'rehearsal/', 'finished', 'product']",Once Upon A Mattress

Based on the hit Broadway show from the 50s, this retelling of the ""Princess and the Pea"" is a delicious dance through fairytale land.The castle set is magical and filled with cherry trees, roses trailing over the tower walls and dreamy moonscapes viewed from the top of the castle. The cinematography is especially clever, causing even scenes that would be a normal interaction to suddenly turn into an occasion for laughter. The camera angles are very creative.Tracey Ullman plays Princess Winnifred and her physical comedy is filled with a mixture of childlike wonder and adult comedy. She alternates effortlessly between gazing at the moon and dancing in complex choreographed sessions that show a high sense of artistic precision. Candles throughout the set create an appealing romantic mood. The sets and especially brilliantly designed costumes could not be more entertaining.As Queen Aggravain attempts to get rid of Princess Winnifred through a variety of tests, Prince Dauntless becomes more and more amused by the challenge between his mother and his love interest.

933452,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B000ATQYVK,Reviews No More,"[8, 11]","So, a lot of reviewers here have seen Carol Burnette play Princess Winnifred as well as experiencing other versions of this comic musical rendition of The Princess and the Pea.  I respect that you have seen those versions and like them better, but some of us haven't, so we have to work with what we know. I empathize with your feelings entirely, having cringed at the late 90s version of Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella.The latest stock of musicals transferred to DVD from either television or film have been embarrassingly bad.  Down with Love, Bride and Prejudice, the new Willy Wonka, Moulin Rouge, and the new Music Man--none of these will be remembered years from now.  This is definitely not the case with Disney's new offering of Once Upon a Mattress.Having purchased this on DVD just a few nights ago, I fell in love immediately and have watched it repeatedly since--not a typical undertaking for yours truly.  Carol Burnette is her vintage self as she undertakes the role of control freak Queen Aggravain, and reminds one easily of some of the hilarious villains she played on her variety series--which I'm gratefully old enough to have grown up with.  Tom Smothers is hilarious and touching as the mute king, and I love the fact that they allowed him to play with his yoyo on the set!  Zooey Deschanel and Matthew Morrison sang beautifully together, but it wasn't lost on me the hilarious edge that these two good-looking people who would normally play the stereotypical lead roles ended up being the understudy romance in this version.  That's what makes this version so very funny:  Thank you Disney for providing just a touch of reality to this film by making Prince Dauntless and Princess Winnefred both middle-aged people!  How hilarious is it to see a mother who still ruthlessly clings to her still-single ""little boy"" in his 40s and a less than lovely, flambouyant single princess desperate to fill an ""opening"" to be his princess.  Denis O'Hare is charmingly boyish, innocent, and sympathetically funny as the prince for this reason (Come on, ladies, there are a lot of guys out there like this--in fact I am related to one of them!) and Tracey Ullman steals the show as the swamp Princess Winnifred with vigor, vitality, and boundless energy.  That is a very physical role for a woman her age to play, but she carries it off with such skill, she reminds me of Lucille Ball who also didn't shy away from these roles at that time of her life.  I knew she was a talented comedienne, but I didn't realize just what a great dancer and singer she is as well until seeing this movie.  With all due respect to Miss Burnette, there's no question whose movie this is!Featuring unforgettably melodic songs (Unlike the bad ones in both Bride and Prejudice and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) with sharply intelligent and witty lyrics, there won't be too many great musicals of this calibre coming down the pike any time soon.  In fact, I think this one has the power of endurance along with the likes of Gypsy, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story.  Watch for my personal favorite scene, the Spanish Panic, simply one of the cutest and most entertaining dances I've witnessed on film in a very long time.

Powers ""show maniac""","[11, 11]","Just watched this on the TV special ahead of the release of the DVD and while the show was entertaining it had some short-comings principally in dropping numbers such as ""Yesterday I Loved You"" which was sung by the young lovers.  In its place they sang a shortened version of ""Normandy"" which was not their number in the first place. ""Very Soft Shoes"" a minor show-stopper for the jester was missed and ""Many Moons Ago"" and ""An Opening for a Princess"" were reduced to bits. The score that was retained was edited but the songs still entertain.  The cast was well chosen and Tracy Ullman was brave taking on a role forever identified as Carol Burnetts' who camped it up in high style as wicked Queen Aggravain for this special. Tracy was good and funny but her singing lacked the lung power of Carol Burnett especially the way Ms Burnett belted out ""Happily Ever After"" and ""Shy""  Denis O'Hare made an appropriate woe-be-gone Prince Dauntless and Matthew Morrison sang well as Sir Harry.  If this show had been made for HBO maybe they could have retained the entire show instead of being constrained by the endless parade of commercials on network Tv. As is the show was still a lot of fun and the funniest line came when Lady Larkin tells Sir Harry she is expecting his baby and Sir Harry replies, ""You can't be blamed you had a moment of weakness""",4,LESS THAN REGAL BUT WINNING JUST THE SAME,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,1349,"['Just', 'watched', 'TV', 'special', 'ahead', 'release', 'DVD', 'show', 'was', 'entertaining', 'had', 'short-comings', 'principally', 'dropping', 'numbers', 'such', 'Yesterday', 'Loved', 'was', 'sung', 'young', 'lovers', 'place', 'sang', 'shortened', 'version', 'Normandy', 'was', 'not', 'number', 'first', 'place', 'Very', 'Soft', 'Shoes', 'minor', 'show-stopper', 'jester', 'was', 'missed', 'Many', 'Moons', 'Ago', 'Opening', 'Princess', 'were', 'reduced', 'bits', 'score', 'was', 'retained', 'was', 'edited', 'songs', 'still', 'entertain', 'cast', 'was', 'well', 'chosen', 'Tracy', 'Ullman', 'was', 'brave', 'taking', 'role', 'forever', 'identified', 'Carol', 'Burnetts', 'who', 'camped', 'up', 'high', 'style', 'wicked', 'Queen', 'Aggravain', 'special', 'Tracy', 'was', 'good', 'funny', 'singing', 'lacked', 'lung', 'power', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'especially', 'way', 'Ms', 'Burnett', 'belted', 'out', 'Happily', 'Ever', 'Shy', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'made', 'appropriate', 'woe-be-gone', 'Prince', 'Dauntless', 'Matthew', 'Morrison', 'sang', 'well', 'Sir', 'Harry', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'HBO', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'retained', 'entire', 'show', 'instead', 'being', 'constrained', 'endless', 'parade', 'commercials', 'network', 'Tv', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'funniest', 'line', 'came', 'when', 'Lady', 'Larkin', 'Sir', 'Harry', 'expecting', 'baby', 'Sir', 'Harry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'blamed', 'had', 'moment', 'weakness']",Once Upon A Mattress
933455,A2G935GMRAUIRW,B000ATQYVK,Sandy McLendon,"[7, 13]","First, the good news: Carol Burnett has done a new version of the musical that catapulted her to stardom, ""Once Upon a Mattress"".Now, the bad: A sassy, funny show has been Disneyfied to death. I believe it was the late great Allan Sherman who said, ""A camel is a horse that was designed by a committee."" The committee approach is what is wrong with this version: things that didn't need changing have been trampled to death, rendered bland and humourless and politically correct, to please the particular constituency of the Magic Kingdom.The problems begin, appropriately enough, at the beginning, where two songs (""Many Moons Ago"" and ""Opening for a Princess"") that serve as sufficient exposition for theatre audiences have been jettisioned in favour of a young girl sadly tromping through- where else?- Disneyland, in search of Princess Winifred.  It's a silly enough concept, but some brilliant corporate mind has the kid talking to Snow White and Cinderella en route, even telling Cinderella, ""Loved your movie.""Incredibly enough, it's mostly downhill from there.  While Carol Burnett is wonderful as control-freak Queen Aggravaine, she'd be wonderful reading the phone book, and such an appearance might do her more professional good than this namby-pamby production.  Tracey Ullman takes on Burnett's old role of Winifred the Woebegone, and the best that can be said is that she gets the woebegone part right.  Ullman is a bit long in the tooth to be playing the part, and her comedic style does not work for the role.  At many points, she seems to be more intent on playing her dimples to the camera than on creating laughs; there is little wit, sass or point to her portrayal.There is a wild variance in the quality of the work done by the rest of the cast; Tom Smothers is quite good as King Sextimus, even though his big moment towards the end (""I! Can ! TALK!"") has been directed down to a whisper.  Denis O'Hare is too old by half to be attempting the role of Dauntless, and can't be understood part of the time, a largish problem when the lyrics are as intricate as the ones in this show.  Michael Boatman manages the incredible feat of making the Jester interesting in spite of the fact that the Jester's big number, ""Very Soft Shoes"", has been cut.  A good Jester can take more bows than the leads on the strength of this song, and one wonders why it was omitted.The performances of Zooey Deschanel and Matthew Morrison make for the worst Sir Harry and Lady Larkin I've ever seen, high-school productions of this show not excepted.  The lovely, yet satiric ""Normandy"" is completely mangled by these two, with both of them so intent on harmonising that they forget that the words MEAN something.  The song is both a love song and a Borscht Belt spoof of love songs; the imagery of a ""beach where the peach blossom blows"" is closely followed by the streetwise ""And I know how to reach / a man who knows / a man who knows.""  Deschanel and Morrison haven't a clue what all of this is about.But then, neither did much of anyone else connected with this version.  The direction is flabby and pointless, with many a gag thrown away and many a laugh stifled.  The design of the sets is perfectly dreadful, with a sepia murk imposed on nearly everything, and furnishings wildly anachronistic for the period of the story.  Many of the costumes look downright cheap, although Carol Burnett's (by the great Bob Mackie, I understand) are terrific.The worst of it all is that a show that was once bawdy and graceful, hysterical and touching has been dumbed down and PC'ed to the point that there IS no point to it any more.  There was once real wit and bite to the proceedings; this production is so bland, it very nearly qualifies as a formal remake of Disney's ""Cinderella"".If you're a Carol Burnett fan, as I am, you'll be willing to suffer through this to get a chance to see her in it, and it must be admitted that the lady still has what it takes to make an audience laugh, uncontrollably at times.  But what she's surrounded with is not nearly as good as she is, and that's more than a pity, it's a crying shame, given what ""Once Upon a Mattress"" should be and once was, many moons ago.",3,The Princess and the P.C.,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,4195,"['First', 'good', 'news', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'done', 'new', 'version', 'musical', 'catapulted', 'stardom', 'Once', 'Mattress', '.Now', 'bad', 'sassy', 'funny', 'show', 'been', 'Disneyfied', 'death', 'believe', 'was', 'late', 'great', 'Allan', 'Sherman', 'who', 'said', 'camel', 'horse', 'was', 'designed', 'committee', 'committee', 'approach', 'what', 'wrong', 'version', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'changing', 'have', 'been', 'trampled', 'death', 'rendered', 'bland', 'humourless', 'politically', 'correct', 'please', 'particular', 'constituency', 'Magic', 'Kingdom.The', 'problems', 'begin', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'beginning', 'where', 'two', 'songs', 'Many', 'Moons', 'Ago', 'Opening', 'Princess', 'serve', 'sufficient', 'exposition', 'theatre', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'jettisioned', 'favour', 'young', 'girl', 'sadly', 'tromping', 'through-', 'where', 'else', 'Disneyland', 'search', 'Princess', 'Winifred', 'silly', 'enough', 'concept', 'brilliant', 'corporate', 'mind', 'kid', 'talking', 'Snow', 'White', 'Cinderella', 'route', 'even', 'telling', 'Cinderella', 'Loved', 'movie', 'Incredibly', 'enough', 'mostly', 'downhill', 'there', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'wonderful', 'control-freak', 'Queen', 'Aggravaine', ""'d"", 'be', 'wonderful', 'reading', 'phone', 'book', 'appearance', 'might', 'do', 'more', 'professional', 'good', 'namby-pamby', 'production', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'Burnett', 'old', 'role', 'Winifred', 'Woebegone', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'woebegone', 'part', 'right', 'Ullman', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'be', 'playing', 'part', 'comedic', 'style', 'not', 'work', 'role', 'many', 'points', 'be', 'more', 'intent', 'playing', 'dimples', 'camera', 'creating', 'laughs', 'little', 'wit', 'sass', 'point', 'portrayal.There', 'wild', 'variance', 'quality', 'work', 'done', 'rest', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Smothers', 'quite', 'good', 'King', 'Sextimus', 'even', 'big', 'moment', 'end', 'Can', 'TALK', 'been', 'directed', 'down', 'whisper', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'too', 'old', 'half', 'be', 'attempting', 'role', 'Dauntless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'understood', 'part', 'time', 'largish', 'problem', 'when', 'lyrics', 'are', 'as', 'intricate', 'ones', 'show', 'Michael', 'Boatman', 'incredible', 'feat', 'making', 'Jester', 'interesting', 'spite', 'fact', 'Jester', 'big', 'number', 'Very', 'Soft', 'Shoes', 'been', 'cut', 'good', 'Jester', 'can', 'take', 'more', 'bows', 'leads', 'strength', 'song', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'was', 'omitted.The', 'performances', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Matthew', 'Morrison', 'make', 'worst', 'Sir', 'Harry', 'Lady', 'Larkin', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'high-school', 'productions', 'show', 'not', 'excepted', 'lovely', 'yet', 'satiric', 'Normandy', 'completely', 'mangled', 'two', 'so', 'intent', 'harmonising', 'forget', 'words', 'MEAN', 'something', 'song', 'love', 'song', 'Borscht', 'Belt', 'spoof', 'love', 'songs', 'imagery', 'beach', 'where', 'peach', 'blossom', 'blows', 'closely', 'followed', 'streetwise', 'know', 'how', 'reach', 'man', 'who', '/', 'man', 'who', 'Deschanel', 'Morrison', 'have', ""n't"", 'clue', 'what', 'about.But', 'then', 'did', 'much', 'anyone', 'else', 'connected', 'version', 'direction', 'flabby', 'pointless', 'many', 'gag', 'thrown', 'away', 'many', 'laugh', 'stifled', 'design', 'sets', 'perfectly', 'dreadful', 'sepia', 'murk', 'imposed', 'nearly', 'everything', 'furnishings', 'wildly', 'anachronistic', 'period', 'story', 'Many', 'costumes', 'look', 'downright', 'cheap', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'great', 'Bob', 'Mackie', 'understand', 'are', 'terrific.The', 'worst', 'show', 'was', 'once', 'bawdy', 'graceful', 'hysterical', 'touching', 'been', 'dumbed', 'down', ""PC'ed"", 'point', 'point', 'more', 'was', 'once', 'real', 'wit', 'bite', 'proceedings', 'production', 'so', 'bland', 'very', 'nearly', 'qualifies', 'formal', 'remake', 'Disney', 'Cinderella', '.If', ""'re"", 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'fan', 'am', ""'ll"", 'be', 'willing', 'suffer', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'must', 'be', 'admitted', 'lady', 'still', 'what', 'make', 'audience', 'laugh', 'uncontrollably', 'times', 'what', 'surrounded', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'more', 'pity', 'crying', 'shame', 'given', 'what', 'Once', 'Mattress', 'should', 'be', 'once', 'was', 'many', 'moons', 'ago']",Once Upon A Mattress

The over-protective, over-possessive queen, blandly ineffectual king, and infantile prince give plenty to work with. Then, when Winnifred shows up as a contender for the ""princess"" role, there's a new force to contend with. Much to the queen's dismay, Winnifred (or ""Fred"" as the prince calls her) might actually pass the unpassable tests that stand between Fred and her son.Nearly 50 years ago, when this fist came out, it must have been daring adult entertainment. Now, when even a VP-candidate's daughter starts her family before marriage, I'd say it's kid-safe for most households. It still gets laughs from the grown-ups, too.
