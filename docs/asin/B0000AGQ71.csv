I won't go into what that is, as I don't wish to ruin the movie for you. If you are a big Debra Winger fan, this is a ""buy"" right off the bat, no need to read any more. Two brothers, one of them her husband, are fighting over her in a most extreme fashion. I promise you have never seen a fight like it. Jim Varney (Ernest Goes To Camp) and M. Emmett Walsh have great cameos in this film, as does a singing fire brigade. While this will never be on the AFI top 100 list, if you like an offbeat comedy, you will probably like this, and you will likely want to watch it again now and then. As I stated in the first line, though, if you are a person who insists on every minute of a film being completely credible scientifically, then you may want to bypass it, as a bit of a leap of faith is required regarding one point.",4,Really amusing!,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,909,"['film', 'first', 'have', 'get', 'fact', 'one', 'aspect', 'unrealistic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'ruin', 'movie', 'are', 'big', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'fan', 'buy', 'right', 'bat', 'need', 'read', 'more', 'Two', 'brothers', 'one', 'husband', 'are', 'fighting', 'most', 'extreme', 'fashion', 'promise', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'fight', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'Ernest', 'Goes', 'Camp', 'M.', 'Emmett', 'Walsh', 'have', 'great', 'cameos', 'film', 'singing', 'fire', 'brigade', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'AFI', 'top', '100', 'list', 'like', 'offbeat', 'comedy', 'will', 'probably', 'will', 'likely', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'now', 'then', 'stated', 'first', 'line', 'though', 'are', 'person', 'who', 'minute', 'film', 'being', 'completely', 'credible', 'scientifically', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'bypass', 'bit', 'leap', 'faith', 'required', 'regarding', 'one', 'point']",N/A

You will love this surrealistic portrayal of two brothers with an unusual gift/curse.  I played hell trying to find it.  I remembered it when it came out (and slept) at the box office and tried to find it so my new husband could enjoy it as much as I did.  And he did!  I hope they reissue it.  My only disappointment is that it was used, but it works okay.  *****",4,Wilder Napalm DVD,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,472,"['great', 'picture', 'so', 'radar', ""'re"", 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'fan/', ""'re"", 'not', '.who', 'cares', 'will', 'love', 'surrealistic', 'portrayal', 'two', 'brothers', 'unusual', 'gift/curse', 'played', 'hell', 'trying', 'find', 'remembered', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'slept', 'box', 'office', 'tried', 'find', 'so', 'new', 'husband', 'could', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'did', 'hope', 'reissue', 'My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'used', 'okay', '*****']",N/A

Jim Varney (now passed away) was fun to watch in a role unlike the ones he played in later movies. Debra Winger was as always offbeat and did not know until researching this movie online that she and Arliss Howard married after this movie. Everyone in this movie made it work in their own way strange way.  For me it is just fun to watch every now and then when life starts to get to serious.,5,Weird in a good way.,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,511,"['Not', 'sure', 'how', 'explain', 'why', 'like', 'movie', 'Waited', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'worth', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'now', 'passed', 'away', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'role', 'ones', 'played', 'later', 'movies', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'was', 'always', 'offbeat', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'researching', 'movie', 'online', 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'married', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'made', 'work', 'own', 'way', 'strange', 'way', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'now', 'then', 'when', 'life', 'get', 'serious']",N/A

I don't normally like Dennis Quaid, but I thought he was perfect for this. It's just so... strange. Unconventional, maybe, is a better word. People have called it quirky. It's just plain hilarious, a riot. Good fun! I highly recommend it.
