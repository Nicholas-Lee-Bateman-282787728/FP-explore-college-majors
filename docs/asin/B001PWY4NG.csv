His cash-strapped position leads him to the post office5. People go postal6. He's misunderstood once again7. He gets no respect, except from the people watching this movie.Van Damme is brilliant playing a down and out version of himself, as he suffers the heartbreak of a custody battle, the indignity of a shortage of cash, and worse of all, the loss of the lead role in a B movie to Steven Seagal.Speaking about his life, his wives and his career, he shows that he's quite willing to take pot shots at himself, and why not? Almost everybody does at one time or another.From the opening action scene, which is to die (laughing) for, to the tense conclusion and nonsensical wrap-up, this is a new side of JCVD, and I think I like it.Amanda Richards, March 14, 2009",4,Giving a Van Damme,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,1075,"['Central', 'Unit', '27', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'robbing', 'post', 'office', 'need', 'back-up', 'Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'Jean-', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'getting', 'respect2', 'so', 'bad', 'even', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movie', 'role', 'him3', 'Muscles', 'Brussels', 'where', 'least', 'everyone', 'name4', 'cash-strapped', 'position', 'post', 'office5', 'People', 'go', 'postal6', 'misunderstood', 'once', 'again7', 'respect', 'people', 'watching', 'movie.Van', 'Damme', 'brilliant', 'playing', 'down', 'version', 'heartbreak', 'custody', 'battle', 'indignity', 'shortage', 'cash', 'worse', 'loss', 'lead', 'role', 'B', 'movie', 'Steven', 'Seagal.Speaking', 'life', 'wives', 'career', 'quite', 'willing', 'take', 'pot', 'shots', 'why', 'not', 'Almost', 'everybody', 'one', 'time', 'another.From', 'opening', 'action', 'scene', 'die', 'laughing', 'tense', 'conclusion', 'nonsensical', 'wrap-up', 'new', 'side', 'JCVD', 'think', 'like', 'it.Amanda', 'Richards', 'March', '14', '2009']",N/A

He talks to the cops, tells them what he wants, is alone inside with the hostages--he's got guilty written all over him.Except not all is what it seems and Van Damme--hero to all--is having the worst day of his life. Not only did he lose custody of his daughter, he's broke, had no new movie on the horizon and now he's getting framed taking a post office with a built-in bank hostage.I just finished watching this and I'm still soaking it in. I've seen most of Van Damme's movies and JCVD is nothing like any of them. This isn't an action movie despite it starting that way. This is a drama. Big time, and Van Damme proves here he is way more than just muscles, high kicks, and guns. This Van Damme is raw, brutally honest, caring and just downright human. No eight-foot-tall-and-bullet-proof karate guy here. This is the story about Van Damme the man (he goes by his own name in the movie), one with heart, potent emotion and a performance that should have been nominated for an Oscar. Seriously.Van Damme's not listed in the movie's writing credits, but there's a point in the movie where he talks to the camera about life, Hollywood, the ups and downs and simply apologizes for the mistakes he's made in real life to those he knows and to those, like us, he doesn't. Just phenomenal.My only little thing was the story seemed to move slowly in parts, but, hey, that could just be me.And the ending . . . man, it was just perfect. I really liked how they presented it, especially the climatic scene between Van Damme and the bad guys. To go any other way would have completely ruined the movie, but this was handled nicely. Good on them.The sepia coloring used throughout the film added a wonderful grittiness to it, enhancing the drama and its foreign and rustic atmosphere.This is a Van Damme movie you've never seen before.

1230072,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B001PWY4NG,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[5, 6]","In JCVD, Jean-Claude Van Damme, stretching himself artistically, plays a washed up actor named Jean-Claude Van Damme, whose history parallels the real man's life, and whose string of violent B-movie films are used as ammunition against him in his suit for custody of his children.  Beaten, broken, and bankrupt, he returns to his native Belgium to try and regroup and start over, only to step into the middle of a bank robbery in his hometown.At this point, according to the movies of Van Damme's that I've seen before, I would expect him to mop up the place with the three less than competent gunmen, but JCVD hews closer to reality, and Jean-Claude does what any sane person would do when someone puts a gun to their head - he shuts up and does what he's told.  Through a mix-up, the police initially think that Van Damme is the bank robber, and the gunmen seize on that fact, forcing him to negotiate for them.As the hostage situation drags on, director Mabrouk El Mechri breaks the 4th wall, and Van Damme speaks directly into the camera about his life, his success and failure, and intimates what it means for a regular joe to wear the shell of a celebrity.  I wouldn't ordinarily have expected JCVD to be different from any other Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, but this monologue was what made me curious about the film in the first place.  I'd heard of it, and heard it highly praised.  Over-praised, I think, now that I've seen it, as it was presented as a genuine and moving cri de coeur - but while the plight of broken and exhausted celebrities may be terrifically sad, I have a hard time empathizing.  Plus, not only was there the image of the sadder but wiser older man, but I caught a distinct impression that his regret over past actions might cause him far less heartburn if his star status hadn't dimmed as it has.Maybe I'm being unfair, but it doesn't matter because JCVD doesn't depend on the frankness of Jean-Claude's confession to make it an interesting film.  Interesting - not great - though I enjoyed it for what it was.  I though it was a clever look at what makes a person a person, about the illusions we hold concerning other people and about ourselves, and a nice skewering of the film industry.Unfortunately, if the film were viewed as Jean-Claude Van Damme's personal story, it could also be considered a celebrity peep-show, and a blueprint for actors who wish to recast themselves as genuine people via the fiction of film - and its success is likely to bring imitation.  As a convention, I think it would grow tiresome quickly.Mr. Van Damme is also applauded for his acting in this film, which does seem above par, though I've always thought that his acting suffered mostly from his having to appear solely in English speaking movies.  That and how his movies generally went to such goofy lengths to explain his accent.  In JCVD, he carries his acting chores well, but after all, he is playing himself.  That certainly makes it easier to get in character.This movie is likely to receive mixed results, as longtime fans of Mr. Van Damme aren't going to see the action movie they might have expected, and viewers who may appreciate the subtleties of JCVD may not realize that it ISN'T the action movie they expect.  I will say that, barring anything unfortunate, this movie should resurrect Mr. Van Damme's film career.  After the catalog of challenges that such a career brings, which he listed so effectively in his monologue, only he knows if it was worth it.",4,WWJCVDD,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,3493,"['JCVD', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'stretching', 'artistically', 'washed', 'up', 'actor', 'named', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'history', 'real', 'man', 'life', 'string', 'violent', 'B-movie', 'films', 'are', 'used', 'ammunition', 'suit', 'custody', 'children', 'Beaten', 'broken', 'bankrupt', 'native', 'Belgium', 'try', 'regroup', 'start', 'only', 'step', 'middle', 'bank', 'robbery', 'hometown.At', 'point', 'according', 'movies', 'Van', 'Damme', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'would', 'expect', 'mop', 'up', 'place', 'three', 'less', 'competent', 'gunmen', 'JCVD', 'closer', 'reality', 'Jean-Claude', 'what', 'sane', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'when', 'someone', 'gun', 'head', 'up', 'what', 'told', 'mix-up', 'police', 'initially', 'think', 'Van', 'Damme', 'bank', 'robber', 'gunmen', 'seize', 'fact', 'forcing', 'negotiate', 'them.As', 'hostage', 'situation', 'drags', 'director', 'Mabrouk', 'El', 'Mechri', '4th', 'wall', 'Van', 'Damme', 'directly', 'camera', 'life', 'success', 'failure', 'what', 'regular', 'joe', 'wear', 'shell', 'celebrity', 'would', ""n't"", 'ordinarily', 'have', 'expected', 'JCVD', 'be', 'different', 'other', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'monologue', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'curious', 'film', 'first', 'place', ""'d"", 'heard', 'heard', 'highly', 'praised', 'Over-praised', 'think', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'presented', 'genuine', 'moving', 'cri', 'de', 'coeur', 'plight', 'broken', 'exhausted', 'celebrities', 'may', 'be', 'terrifically', 'sad', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'empathizing', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'image', 'sadder', 'wiser', 'older', 'man', 'caught', 'distinct', 'impression', 'regret', 'past', 'actions', 'might', 'cause', 'far', 'less', 'heartburn', 'star', 'status', 'had', ""n't"", 'dimmed', ""'m"", 'being', 'unfair', ""n't"", 'matter', 'JCVD', ""n't"", 'depend', 'frankness', 'Jean-Claude', 'confession', 'make', 'interesting', 'film', 'Interesting', 'not', 'great', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'clever', 'look', 'what', 'person', 'person', 'illusions', 'hold', 'concerning', 'other', 'people', 'ourselves', 'nice', 'skewering', 'film', 'industry.Unfortunately', 'film', 'were', 'viewed', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'personal', 'story', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'considered', 'celebrity', 'peep-show', 'blueprint', 'actors', 'who', 'wish', 'recast', 'genuine', 'people', 'fiction', 'film', 'success', 'likely', 'bring', 'imitation', 'convention', 'think', 'would', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'quickly.Mr', 'Van', 'Damme', 'also', 'applauded', 'acting', 'film', 'seem', 'par', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'acting', 'suffered', 'mostly', 'having', 'appear', 'solely', 'English', 'speaking', 'movies', 'how', 'movies', 'generally', 'went', 'such', 'goofy', 'lengths', 'explain', 'accent', 'JCVD', 'acting', 'chores', 'well', 'playing', 'certainly', 'easier', 'get', 'character.This', 'movie', 'likely', 'receive', 'mixed', 'results', 'longtime', 'fans', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Damme', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'see', 'action', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'appreciate', 'subtleties', 'JCVD', 'may', 'not', 'realize', ""N'T"", 'action', 'movie', 'expect', 'will', 'say', 'barring', 'anything', 'unfortunate', 'movie', 'should', 'resurrect', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Damme', 'film', 'career', 'catalog', 'challenges', 'career', 'brings', 'listed', 'so', 'effectively', 'monologue', 'only', 'was', 'worth']",N/A

1230074,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B001PWY4NG,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","Jean-Claude Van Damme has pretty much always been known as a cliche action movie star. He's known for his skills in various different types of martial arts and if you haven't seen any of his films, you can pretty much figure out what they're heavy on (and more than likely light on) considering his talents. Along comes JCVD, a film that tells the story of what it's like to be a washed up action star. Between his money problems and his ongoing custody battle for his daughter with his ex-wife, Van Damme has a full plate. So he decides to travel to Belgium, his homeland, to reconnect with his parents and hopefully just get away from all the headaches that come with living a Hollywood lifestyle. Then, a simple trip to the post office turns into a nightmare as Van Damme realizes he may not be walking out of there alive.JCVD shows a side of Van Damme that nobody has really seen before. His acting chops take center stage this time around and it's incredible how much range he actually has. He's able to showcase the fact that he has a lot more talent than fans or the moviegoing audience actually gave him credit for. There's a six minute monologue that might just be the best scene in the film. You can hear the pain in Van Damme's voice as the anguish he's going through bleeds through the words spilling from his mouth. Tears stream down his face as his face wrenches in torment. And then as quickly as the monologue begins, it ends. The scene itself, along with the way it was pulled off, is really the most memorable part of the film for me.JCVD highlights all of the potential Jean-Claude Van Damme has as an actor. Not as an action movie star, but as a legitimate actor. Don't go into this expecting the usual bone breaking or face bashing someone may find in a film that Van Damme is usually found in. This film has a kick to it and not in the literal sense. It's an unexpected surprise that could put Van Damme back on top of his game, if played right. It could certainly do for him what The Wrestler did for Mickey Rourke. People who aren't fans of Van Damme's work will more than likely still enjoy this if they're willing to give it a chance.Rating: 8/10",4,The True Potential of Van Damme,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,2172,"['Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'pretty', 'much', 'always', 'been', 'known', 'cliche', 'action', 'movie', 'star', 'known', 'skills', 'various', 'different', 'types', 'martial', 'arts', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'films', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'figure', 'out', 'what', ""'re"", 'heavy', 'more', 'likely', 'light', 'considering', 'talents', 'JCVD', 'film', 'story', 'what', 'be', 'washed', 'up', 'action', 'star', 'Between', 'money', 'problems', 'ongoing', 'custody', 'battle', 'daughter', 'ex-wife', 'Van', 'Damme', 'full', 'plate', 'travel', 'Belgium', 'homeland', 'reconnect', 'parents', 'hopefully', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'headaches', 'come', 'living', 'Hollywood', 'lifestyle', 'Then', 'simple', 'trip', 'post', 'office', 'nightmare', 'Van', 'Damme', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'walking', 'alive.JCVD', 'side', 'Van', 'Damme', 'nobody', 'really', 'seen', 'acting', 'chops', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'time', 'incredible', 'how', 'much', 'range', 'actually', 'able', 'showcase', 'fact', 'lot', 'more', 'talent', 'fans', 'moviegoing', 'audience', 'actually', 'gave', 'credit', 'six', 'minute', 'monologue', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'can', 'hear', 'pain', 'Van', 'Damme', 'voice', 'anguish', 'going', 'bleeds', 'words', 'spilling', 'mouth', 'Tears', 'stream', 'down', 'face', 'face', 'wrenches', 'torment', 'then', 'as', 'quickly', 'monologue', 'scene', 'way', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'really', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'me.JCVD', 'highlights', 'potential', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'actor', 'Not', 'action', 'movie', 'star', 'legitimate', 'actor', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'usual', 'bone', 'breaking', 'face', 'bashing', 'someone', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'Van', 'Damme', 'usually', 'found', 'film', 'kick', 'not', 'literal', 'sense', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'could', 'put', 'Van', 'Damme', 'back', 'top', 'game', 'played', 'right', 'could', 'certainly', 'do', 'what', 'Wrestler', 'did', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'People', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'Van', 'Damme', 'work', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'still', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'willing', 'give', 'chance.Rating', '8/10']",N/A

1230076,A3UUGZRTBS81YN,B001PWY4NG,David W. Jones,"[3, 4]","This is a different type of movie.  It is not just a movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme; it is about Jean-Claude Van Damme, with an interesting mixture of fact and fiction.  JCVD, after a series of disappointing B-movies and the loss of a custody case with his daughter, returns to Belgium, where he is regarded as a hero.  Only he finds himself part of a bank robbery.  Using his wits, acting experience and martial arts abilities, he is pushed to the limit as he seeks to survive this harrowing experience--trying to save his own life and that of his fellow captives as well.The movie offers a glimpse into the darker side of Hollywood fame.  There is little glitz and glamour here as we see the aging star, both broke and broken.  If anyone ever thought that he was simply a pretty boy with some cool martial arts skills, they are wrong.  Van Damme demonstrates in this movie that he can act in dramatic parts as well.  As much as I like Bloodsport, this is the best movie he has ever made.The blu-ray transfer is adequate, but not stellar.  The entire movie is cast in a sepia tint that gives it an aged, washed-out look.  The quality is not much different than an upconverted DVD.  So if you already own the DVD and are considering an upgrade to blu-ray, you are probably fine staying with the DVD.Parental Advisory: This movie features an extended fighting sequence (which turns out to be a scene being filmed in a movie).  A man is shot in one scene, and there are other scenes where hostages are under duress.  The movie contains some profanity, including the F-word (sometimes in French).  There is discussion involving past drug addiction.  In one scene that takes place in a video store, apparently the covers of some racy films are visible (I did not notice this, but my wife did).  The movie is rated-R, but with some minor changes it could have been PG-13.  Most parents would probably be fine with their teenagers seeing it, but not their smaller children.In summary, I recommend this movie.

1230079,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B001PWY4NG,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 2]","I was in video distribution when Van Damme was releasing a lot of movies so I got to see my fair share of them. Overall I enjoyed them. He had a good screen presence and ended up with better scripts and slightly larger budgets than some of the others in that neck of the woods. At the end of the day however he was considered an action star with little hope of aspiring to anything more. And action stars usually have a limited shelf life. For him this was compounded by bad press involving drugs.So here he is in a movie that requires him to actually act with something other than his biceps and he really steps up to the plate.Here's the scoop. In this movie he plays himself. He's approaching over-the-hill-dom. He's fighting for rolls. His marriage is shot. He's fighting for custody of his daughter and he's having cash flow issues. He heads into a Belgium post office to retrieve a wire transfer of some cash and finds himself in the middle of a robbery.Van Damme wears his years on his face. He has his share of wrinkles and he looks beleaguered. Now he's in a situation where the officials think he's one of the perps and a legion of fans gathered around the post office don't care. He has to get out of this with as much of himself in tact as possible and maybe use his experience and popularity to make certain the situation doesn't degrade past the point of no return.Van Damme does better than I could have possibly imagined. He has one scene in particular where he waxes introspectively and does an astounding job. This is all done in one take. So either he really has honed his acting skills or he's truly speaking from the heart. Or possibly both. I don't know how close all of this is to real life but it's spooky to not know what is true and what isn't. The bad guys do a good job. One in particular is the kind of guy you hope to never meet in real life. He's ugly down to his bones. There is also some humor thrown in which helps to keep things from getting too overwrought.I also liked the structure. The viewer sees several scenes a couple of times but from different perspectives. It might not be a new technique but it works well here. The producers/director don't set up the story and try slog through it to the end. The cutting of time and perspective helped keep me involved. I also like that things don't all work out in the end. They aren't bad for Van Damme but they aren't perfect. About the only thing I didn't care for was the color palette. It was almost a sepia with much of the color washed out.This is a good movie and I hope it helps Van Damme reach the next stage in his career.

I loved this film.  I didn't know what to expect; other than it was ""different"" from his usual film.  What an unexpected treat to see a washed-up film action star playing a version of himself with such painful honesty and introspection.  It's some of the most honest acting I've seen in a long time (compares well with Mickey O'Rourke's performance in The Wrestler).Van Damme's soliloquy just past the half-way point in the film, where he speaks directly to the audience, is nothing short of existential brilliance.  He gives us a heartfelt monologue on his life, his shortcomings, and even hints at deeper metaphysical subjects, such as the meaning of life.  However, don't think it's some pretentious art film just because of this scene.  There's still plenty of violence and action, just not mindless violence.

1230085,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001PWY4NG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","In the reality-twisting, self-parodying, French-talking film JCVD, Jean-Claude Van Damme gets another crack at something he can't swing a helicopter kick at: an acting role. In his cinematic career Van Damme has had spots in which he's delivered with nicely acted scenes, all found in his better movies (NOWHERE TO RUN, HARD TARGET, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER, TIMECOP). But mostly all that's ever been required of him are those helicopter kicks and a chiseled body. But JCVD finds the Muscles from Brussels stepping out of his B-movie action genre and into a pretty darn dramatic role. Here, we finally get a real peek at Van Damme's acting chops. But who would've have thought his role of a lifetime would be that of playing himself?In L.A. he's just lost a custody battle for his daughter. He hasn't slept in two days, and, having just flown from L.A. to his native home of Brussels, he's suffering from serious jet lag. He's low on funds; the ATM has just rejected his credit cards. And the Belgian police think he's masterminded a post office robbery which has just escalated into a hostage situation. Or as one member of the converging media solemnly states: ""We have an actor here who's obviously disgruntled..."" This is about as down-and-out as Jean-Claude Van Damme can get.Word to the wise, when you watch this one, don't expect yet another cheesy action flick. After an extended tracking shot sequence in the opening - in which Van Damme, in a scene within a scene, does his patented action hero thing to a string of stuntmen - JCVD buckles down to a deliberately-paced thriller-drama. Meaning that, while there is suspense, there certainly isn't much in the way of martial arts mayhem. JCVD marks a departure for Van Damme, and considering that most of his films reek with a career-crippling sense of sameness, the man had to be excited to do this movie and demonstrate to the world that, yep, he can actually turn in a noteworthy acting performance. Is the film gimmicky? Oh, yes, brother. But it's also a gimmicky film that's compelling. I don't hesitate to call the final product a fine and revelatory brand of meta-storytelling.The fun part is that JCVD manages to throw in these nice and funny little digs. Van Damme clearly doesn't mind skewering his image, his reputation, and his movies. In the film he finds himself being chastised by a woman cabbie and his movies denounced as unfit for children. And I snorted when, in the film, he learns that he'd just lost a part to Steven Seagal, who got the nod when he agreed to snip off his ponytail. There's this funny line about John Woo served up by one outraged thug (a huge fan of Van Damme), who credits the Muscles from Brussels with bringing John Woo to Hollywood. This thug states that, without Van Damme, John Woo would ""still be filming pigeons in Hong Kong."" Heh. But the most fascinating bit arrives over an hour into the film, when Van Damme seems to rise like the holy ghost, breaks down the fourth wall, and has a six-minute confessional heart-to-heart with the movie audience (and are those tears glistening in his eyes? I think they are).Slim pickings in the way of DVD bonus features. There's the ever-present theatrical trailer. There are two deleted scenes, a different take, respectively, on the cigarette kicking scene and the scene with Jean-Claude attempting to define what being ""aware"" is to one of the hostage takers (although, really, Jean-Claude is just rambling here). And that's it for bonus features. Like I said, slim pickings.I really like this movie, but if I have to come up with a peeve, here's a minor one. The way it plays out, it's a bit unbelievable to me that Van Damme's lawyer needed to be woken up by a phone call, after one of Van Damme's ""demands"" has the police transferring funds into his legal firm's account and, more importantly, considering the fact that it's this lawyer's movie star client who's being surrounded by the Belgian constabulary with the media and a massive crowd camped out. You'd think this lawyer guy would be sitting around, transfixed in front of his TV set.I'm fairly certain that Van Damme's life is better in real life. I'm also quite positive that Van Damme has never been taken hostage or been mistaken for a heist ringleader. But he probably shares his onscreen counterpart's insecurities and frustration about his film career. Van Damme has taken his share of snarky shots (and, yes, I've bagged on him, too), so I'm guiltily stoked for the dude that JCVD has been garnering so many rave reviews. No, JCVD isn't your typical low rent straight-to-video action flick. This is a surprisingly good art house picture, featuring a consistently effective Jean-Claude Van Damme who, at 47 years old, now shows wear and tear on his face and who, after more than two decades in the movie business, has also managed to improve on his craft. Guy has always had helicopter kicks. But, now, he's also got gravitas.",4,"""We have an actor here who's obviously disgruntled...""",1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,4934,"['reality-twisting', 'self-parodying', 'French-talking', 'film',

You can see he has trouble getting new roles, has child custody issues, and other random things an ex-star may face.I was disappointed that the movie tried to be funny, but fails in this regard mostly because of the script. There are some good lines and scenarios, such as when he finds out that Seagal won a role by cutting off his ponytail. Another was when his daughter talks about how her friends make fun of her about her dad's roles.However I thought that there was too much violence and seriousness about some of the characters. This took away from many of the lighter sides of the movie. I am not sure what the director intended, but it is too serious for a spoof and is not really an action-type of drama either.I would have loved to see this movie as a pure light-hearted spoof without the violence.

1230088,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001PWY4NG,Jason,"[6, 6]","The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)1. Who is he? JCVD is JCVD2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? Himself3. Does he take his shirt off? No, but he wears his heart on his sleeve4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? No, but he gets screwed in the end5. Is there a tournament? Well, court is kind of like a double-elimination tournament6. Is training needed for this tournament? No, but law school would have been nice7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? Unfortunately not8. Does he punch someone in the balls?  Punch + Kick = SWAT officer gets carried away in agony, desperately craving an ice pack like a long lost lover9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? More than enough to satisfy a true JCVD fan10. Is his enemy unbeatable? How does one truly conquer one's own demons?11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance?  In life, in court, and in a precarious post office predicament, JCVD is constantly plagued by his own shining star.12. Does he win? The most revealing win of his career.Beginning with an introspective peek inside production at a JCVD movie, we learn that he is no longer the man he once was.  Sure, he's still dynamic, powerful, and above all a bona fide superstar, but he's also not quite as capable as he once was at a younger age.  Despite the fact that he's 47 - something his new director disregards like a slave driver - he still manages to put together a pulse-pounding intro in a single take, with multiple attackers, countless weapons, a wall falling over like in a Buster Keaton movie, and even his patented testicle attacks.The plot of the movie itself is rather ingenious.  It's JCVD playing himself, in a movie soaked in the realism of his every day life.  What it must be like to be one of a few superstars in a smaller country.  He handles his situation with class, poise, and humility.  Facing a ruthless child custody hearing, he must display those traits just to maintain a semblance of sanity.  All that changes when he walks into a robbery and the criminals decide to use his celebrity to their advantage.  What ensues is a battle of wills and wits, as Van Damme uses his status to gain the trust of his fellow prisoners, as well as to manipulate the mind and break the bond between the trio of robbers.Most impressive about JCVD is a lengthy, heartfelt monologue midway through the movie.  He talks directly into the camera and completely exposes his innermost thoughts.  Separated from the cast and the set for a moment, similar to how a play differentiates group acting and audience interaction - a break from the other characters - he pours out raw emotion.  Directly mocking Hollywood stardom, he struggles emotionally through real life references to his marriage and drug problems; it's personal, and it's deep.His stardom is obviously a difficult subject.  How he feels both vindicated and tortured by his success at the same time - why can't others be as lucky?  On the verge of tears, a breakdown must have been difficult to hold back; it wouldn't be surprising to discover the scene took multiple takes.  It reinforces his frailties, and it supports the script that proposes his humanism, his mortality, that would clearly take over were a real gun placed to his head.The monologue is also where JCVD displays his acting ability.  He's actually a good actor - something obvious to anyone who has seen In Hell, Wake of Death, or Nowhere to Run.  Speaking in his native language, it's easier to express emotions.  In all actuality, it's probably the language barrier in other films that makes him less believable.  When working with familiarity, the acting range flows as easily as the dialogue (the subtitles are fast, unobtrusive, and seamlessly integrated).  It's hard not to side with Van Damme, from the very beginning the viewer is privy to the behind the scenes treatment he often receives, and the undeserved lack of respect he commands as an actorJCVD deserves similar praise to the fawning Mickey Rourke has received for ""The Wrestler"".  This film poignantly proves that he has real acting chops, and that he can truly tap into that deep-seeded trauma which all great actors grasp when needed.  He's painfully sincere, and completely fascinating in this exposition.  His jump may have lost an inch, his kick may have lost some power, and his splits may not be as straight as they once were, but he is revitalized in this tour de force.  Even for non-fans, JCVD comes highly recommended.",5,"A tribute to the man, the myth, the legend: JCVD",1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,4509,"['Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Review', 'Matrix', 'JCVD-RM', '1.', 'Who', 'JCVD', 'JCVD2', 'Which', 'family', 'member/friend', 'must', 'be', 'avenged', 'Himself3', 'take', 'shirt', 'No', 'heart', 'sleeve4', 'have', 'sex', 'C-List', 'actress', 'No', 'screwed', 'end5', 'there', 'tournament', 'Well', 'court', 'kind', 'double-elimination', 'tournament6', 'training', 'needed', 'tournament', 'No', 'law', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice7', 'do', 'splits', 'training', 'tournament', 'Unfortunately', 'not8', 'punch', 'someone', 'balls', 'Punch', '+', 'Kick', '=', 'SWAT', 'officer', 'carried', 'away', 'agony', 'desperately', 'craving', 'ice', 'pack', 'long', 'lost', 'lover9', 'do', 'series', 'flying', '360', 'kicks', 'More', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'true', 'JCVD', 'fan10', 'enemy', 'unbeatable', 'How', 'one', 'truly', 'one', 'own', 'demons', '11', 'overcome', 'injury', 'other', 'hindrance', 'life', 'court', 'precarious', 'post', 'office', 'predicament', 'JCVD', 'constantly', 'plagued', 'own', 'shining', 'star.12', 'win', 'most', 'revealing', 'win', 'career.Beginning', 'introspective', 'peek', 'production', 'JCVD', 'movie', 'learn', 'no', 'longer', 'man', 'once', 'was', 'Sure', 'still', 'dynamic', 'powerful', 'bona', 'fide', 'superstar', 'also', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'capable', 'once', 'was', 'younger', 'age', 'fact', '47', 'something', 'new', 'director', 'disregards', 'slave', 'driver', 'still', 'put', 'together', 'pulse-pounding', 'intro', 'single', 'take', 'multiple', 'attackers', 'countless', 'weapons', 'wall', 'falling', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'movie', 'even', 'patented', 'testicle', 'attacks.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'rather', 'ingenious', 'JCVD', 'playing', 'movie', 'soaked', 'realism', 'day', 'life', 'What', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'superstars', 'smaller', 'country', 'situation', 'class', 'poise', 'humility', 'Facing', 'ruthless', 'child', 'custody', 'hearing', 'must', 'display', 'traits', 'just', 'maintain', 'semblance', 'sanity', 'changes', 'when', 'robbery', 'criminals', 'decide', 'use', 'celebrity', 'advantage', 'What', 'battle', 'wills', 'wits', 'Van', 'Damme', 'status', 'gain', 'trust', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'as', 'well', 'manipulate', 'mind', 'break', 'bond', 'trio', 'robbers.Most', 'impressive', 'JCVD', 'lengthy', 'heartfelt', 'monologue', 'midway', 'movie', 'directly', 'camera', 'completely', 'innermost', 'thoughts', 'Separated', 'cast', 'set', 'moment', 'similar', 'how', 'play', 'group', 'acting', 'audience', 'interaction', 'break', 'other', 'characters', 'out', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Directly', 'mocking', 'Hollywood', 'stardom', 'emotionally', 'real', 'life', 'references', 'marriage', 'drug', 'problems', 'personal', 'deep.His', 'stardom', 'obviously', 'difficult', 'subject', 'How', 'vindicated', 'tortured', 'success', 'same', 'time', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'others', 'be', 'lucky', 'verge', 'tears', 'breakdown', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'hold', 'back', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprising', 'discover', 'scene', 'took', 'multiple', 'frailties', 'script', 'humanism', 'mortality', 'would', 'clearly', 'take', 'over', 'were', 'real', 'gun', 'placed', 'head.The', 'monologue', 'also', 'where', 'JCVD', 'acting', 'ability', 'actually', 'good', 'actor', 'something', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Hell', 'Wake', 'Death', 'Nowhere', 'Run', 'Speaking', 'native', 'language', 'easier', 'express', 'emotions', 'actuality', 'probably', 'language', 'barrier', 'other', 'films', 'less', 'believable', 'When', 'working', 'familiarity', 'acting', 'range', 'flows', 'easily', 'dialogue', 'subtitles', 'are', 'fast', 'unobtrusive', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'hard', 'not', 'side', 'Van', 'Damme', 'very', 'beginning', 'viewer', 'privy', 'scenes', 'treatment', 'often', 'undeserved', 'lack', 'respect', 'actorJCVD', 'similar', 'praise', 'fawning', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'received', 'Wrestler', 'film', 'poignantly', 'real', 'acting', 'chops', 'can', 'truly', 'tap', 'deep-seeded', 'trauma', 'great', 'actors', 'grasp', 'when', 'needed', 'painfully', 'sincere', 'completely', 'fascinating', 'exposition', 'jump', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'inch', 'kick', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'power', 'splits', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'straight', 'once', 'were', 'revitalized', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Even', 'non-fans', 'JCVD', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

JCVD therefore comes as a shock. Thankfully, the US (Region 1) release provides DVD cover art that helps soften the blow for those expecting another direct-to-video action effort. The same cannot be said for the Region 2 UK release by Revolver Entertainment. Looking at that cover art (complete with exploding buildings and hovering helicopter) would have you believe this is more of the same from Mr. Van Damme. Word to the wise: I bought the R2 release for the extra bonus features.I will not spoil your enjoyment of what is ultimately a film worth watching. Mr. Van Damme shows he can act with emotion. But there are caveats. First, he is playing himself, with all the baggage that entails. Perhaps channeling his Method Acting was organic. Can he do as well playing a character? Second, much of his speaking in JCVD is in his native French. Can he ever reach a comfort level with American English or will the language barrier limit his appeal to European cinema?More importantly, and after watching the ""Making Of"" documentary (on the UK release), I'm not sure another director will want to invest in the kind of hand-holding that seemed necessary to bring out the best in Mr. Van Damme. It's almost as if he was never taught how to act and he is just learning it all for the first time. Or like a child with developmental delays who gets frustrated when he has trouble picking up a new skill quickly. And as that child may lash out physically, so too does Mr. Van Damme need a gentle but firm chaperone on set. So unless Mabrouk El Mechri wants to work with him exclusively, despite JCVD being a personal tour de force, it might not be a breakout performance for Mr. Van Damme after all. We need to see what kind of projects he can attach himself to going forward. But I will say this: the director (M el M) has a very bright future. I could easily see him doing a stylish, gritty action movie, a la Bourne.Not sure why JCVD did not have more exposure stateside. Still, Mr. Van Damme garnered a Best Actor nomination from the Toronto Film Critics Association (2008).I'm rating this 4 stars because it doesn't come with extras (other than perhaps the deleted scenes). If you have a region-free player, I strongly suggest getting the R2 release of JCVD. It's cheaper, plus it comes with the aforementioned ""Making of JCVD"" documentary, as well as an insightful ""A Day with JCVD"" featurette.

Jean Claude Van Damme plays himself in this movie & it deals with a lot of the problems that Van Damme was going through in the mid to late 90's. Van Damme doesn't get custody of his daughter & a lawyer uses violence in his movies against him. Van Damme goes back home to Beligum & his credit cards don't work he needs to get some money wired to him but at this bank it turns out that it's being robbed & the cops think Van Damme is in on it. I like how some things are done from JCVD's point of view what he'd like to do but he can't cause he'd be out man'd. The ending wasn't the best but I liked this movie. The speech to his fans was great but unfortantly it doesn't mean much now considering he chose Universal Soldier Regeneration over The Expendables.

If you're renting this expecting anything at all in the way of action then you are going to be extremely disappointed because apart from the opening scene (which turns out to be a scene from a movie he is supposedly filming) there is a total of two kicks, an elbow, and maybe a punch. I think that perhaps as Van Damme nears 50 has realized that his career as an action star is living on borrowed time and that this film might serve as his calling card to the world of serious film-makers, at least in Europe. And it definitely does that in a most impressive fashion. With the making of this film the Muscles from Brussles proves himself to be undoubtedly the most talented thespian of all kwailo martial artists, and probably most Asian martial artists as well. Here he presents himself as amiable-- though world weary, down trodden, and scrambling to hold together the last vestiges of his fading career, and he does so very convinvcingly.

Then he went and did two movies under the radar and long past his prime.  They were ""In Hell"" and ""Wake of Death.""  This renewed my faith in Mr. Splits.  Of course, he doesn't do his over-the-top moves in either of those movies, as the stories are more character driven...yes, I said it, he has movies that are character driven.  Anyway, it inticed me to see what else he has been doing and sure enough along came JCVD.This movie was a pleasure to view.  It starts off as him starring in an underbudget action movie replica of his early career.  It turns into a sarcastic mock when he and the director try to work out a scene.  After that, Van Damme doesn't do much in the kick/punch genre.  This is a straight up great story and Van Damme does a wonderful job reflecting on his life choices and how it has led him into this particular situation.You will get to see Van Damme act and dare I say, much better than several actors who have won presitgous awards.  I think it helps that he speaks in his native tongue and it doesn't sound like broken english.  If by somechance they make a DUBBED version, I hope no one sees it, because it won't do it justice.  There are some english spoken lines, but most of it is done with subtitles...it works!After watching these three movies, I sure hope Van Damme is given a chance with an American studio to show his Acting, not fighting, chops.Off the subject, ""In Hell"" is a dark look at a foreign prison and how it takes a toll on someone, while ""Wake of Death"" is very very violent at times...has some standard cliches, but overall, it is a good picture.

1230096,A2HSFKLLQHYY6S,B001PWY4NG,Matt Skidmore,"[4, 5]","''The biggest fight of his life'' proclaims the movie posters' all too sincere tagline and from the warts and all performance on display - they weren't kidding. With a craftily self titled movie and a director who understands the hollywood action movie machine, Jean Claude Van Damme's new film is an exceptionally well made production with superb acting and stylish direction combined with an engaging story and possibly one of the most stripped down and honest performances of the last few years... who knew it would come from a belgian guy mostly known for his high kicks, a string of direct to video actioners and tabloid bating substance abuse?To begin, I am a big Van Damme fan. I know its not all that clever to admit that, but I have followed him since I was a young teen becoming enchanted by his dynamic action movies that always seemed to combine high octane balletics with a real desire to make something different within the genre (hence his insistence on bringing hong kong directors to the US) - granted, some of his movies have been less than favourable (Derailed, The Order, Second In Command, etc) but he has still delivered solid genre flicks in the form of Hard Target, In Hell and AWOL. However, after seeing this - the new film ''JCVD'', his industry perception as a one note action star may well be turned on its head...The story has JC playing himself. He's a down on his luck, over the hill action movie star with money problems, an agent who cannot get him a decent gig and a public child custody battle which isn't going in his favour. Retreating to his home of Brussels, he is embroiled in a post office robbery where he is held hostage by a gang of crooks who are at first astounded by him, then cannily plan how his name can help them with their scheme. JC's fame is used against him not only by the media, public and police outside but the bank robbers in their attempt to steal the money and make their escape...Here the story breaks into many facets and we are introduced to JC's insecurities about the industry and the high profile life he lives. Using the media attention as a springboard for the movie - we get to learn about JC's career and his personal descent. A sequence where he talks directly to camera about his life is the highlight of the movie and makes for uncomfortable and tragic viewing, yet surprisingly life affirming. Its a testament to him that he can not only have this career as an international action star, but is also a deeply affecting actor who can produce the kind of performance that he does here. I am in the minority where I have always thought Van Damme was an effective actor (witness him in both Replicant and In Hell where he draws on his real darker sides), but here he really establishes he is quite the thespian and at times, you really do warm to him more so than in any of his other roles. I guess just being yourself is the best policy after all...The rest of the movie is also top notch. From Mabrouk El Mechri's stylish direction which never borders on cynicism (which could have easily transpired) or fun poking to the funny and daring script that challenges Van Damme's public persona yet also celebrates him. The cast too, are excellent. Franois Damiens as cop Bruges is a standout and the performances of the couple who play JC's parents are superb and their concerns for their son seem real and ''realistic'' in terms of the way that they talk to him and discuss about him with others.All in all, a real triumph. To be fair, if you are a standard Van Damme fan who loves his standard action output - then, you may be scratching your head thinking 'where the hell is the kickboxing' and euro villians? but, put that aside and watch what is most probably will be JC's finest hour. Playing himself.

1230097,A16XRPF40679KG,B001PWY4NG,Michael Dobey,"[2, 3]","This is a good movie on many levels.  It's a deep movie and very well thought out and it is a honest and heartfelt flick that features a excellent performance from jean claude van damme.  The actor almost destroyed himself due to drugs back in his heyday and now he's clean and that's great news because people's choices in hero positions wether it be karate hero or sports hero can heavily influence others.  In fact he  explains his life and choices  in a wonderful tearfilled monologue  that takes place within the context of the movie.The movie should be applauded for it's realism in showing how real violence and reacting to it usually happens.  This isn't regular action film stuff; it's people stunned and traumatized and even action heroes may not know what to do, or if they do they might not  come out unhurt either. They may die or be maimed. this fact only makes one realize how hard the job of soldier or policeman really is after all.It looks easy on reel movie life,  but it's all overwelming and a shock to the system in real life.  This point is made when jean imagines himself in a  film hero type rescue and then tries a desperate move to do the right thing.This why perhaps they should show real bloody victims on tv of gang violence or robbery violence and then people can stop fantasizing about outlaws as heroes.This movie is a good movie but it isn't really a typical action movie at all.  And it's worth watching if you don't expect a standard action flick with many explosive scenes and a more escapist nonrealistic approach. Those movies have their place and are fun but this isn't one of them. It is a good drama and jean claude will hopefully stay sober and keep making more movies of any type including dramas. This movie can be watched in a dubbed english version or in it's native french version.

1230098,AC6LV5D2RKTIR,B001PWY4NG,"Michigoon ""tech geek""","[0, 0]","Fans of kung-fu flicks and &#34;bad movies&#34; rejoice! JCVD makes a movie about JCVD, called &#34;JCVD&#34;. It's a legitimately good movie. Not &#34;good&#34; like passable, but actually good. Easily his best film to date. And I don't mean &#34;best&#34; as in my favorite Van Damme film is &#34;The Quest&#34;, I mean good as in this should have won people over at Cannes.The opening: There's explosions everywhere, JCVD is spin-kicking muscle-headed soldiers into oblivion. Bodies pile up left and right, and then Jean-Claude proceeds to... walk off the set and discuss the scene with the director? The fourth wall will be broken.The plot: I'd have to say the plot is a true metaphor such that revealing anything is a semi-spoiler. Trying not to ruin the fun too much, the whole point of the film is that JCVD believes he has been misunderstood- as an actor and as a person- so when the movie reveals that a weary-sounding JCVD is robbing a post office, you sense there's more to the story. So much more.So why should you watch it? JCVD (and company) are telling a very direct and personal story to the audience using film as a medium- this is high art. The &#34;climax&#34; of the movie is really when JCVD is raised above the set to deliver an impassioned monologue directly to the camera, with the stage lights and equipment clearly visible behind him. Eyes full of tears, apologizing for his mistakes but full of hope and pride over his accomplishments, he pours his soul out to the world openly and without reservation. Then, at the end, he is lowered back into the scene and rolls right back into the script without breaking the one-shot. This must be seen.Fans of JCVD and kung-fu movies in general will get lots of what they want, from over-the-top action scenes to quips about Steven Seagal. People who've stared and wondered all this time at who this guy is or why he keeps making bad movies, will get the explanation they've been looking for (and it's not a clearcut as they expect). Movie fans in general, this is just a well-made movie. Highly recommended, to anyone old enough to watch an action movie and who doesn't mind French with subtitles.Also of note, do watch the bonus deleted scenes. There's just a few cuts there, but they demonstrate that a good portion of the movie was done in the long single-shots that open the film and including much ad-libbing from JCVD. These elements add a lot of difficulty to an action movie (and that's not just a jab at Van Damme). To think that the movie was shot in this style, with such a personal and intricate plot, really goes to show the heart that went into this film. An all-time classic, JCVD should be a staple of fight films and arthouse together. This movie says more about the man, than any biopic ever will.",5,The Muscles from Brussels is Back,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,2782,"['Fans', 'kung-fu', 'flicks', '34', 'bad', 'movies', '34', 'rejoice', 'JCVD', 'movie', 'JCVD', 'called', '34', 'JCVD', '34', 'legitimately', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', '34', 'good', '34', 'passable', 'actually', 'good', 'Easily', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', '34', 'best', '34', 'favorite', 'Van', 'Damme', 'film', '34', 'Quest', '34', 'mean', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'people', 'Cannes.The', 'opening', 'explosions', 'everywhere', 'JCVD', 'spin-kicking', 'muscle-headed', 'soldiers', 'oblivion', 'Bodies', 'pile', 'up', 'left', 'right', 'then', 'Jean-Claude', 'proceeds', 'walk', 'set', 'discuss', 'scene', 'director', 'fourth', 'wall', 'will', 'be', 'broken.The', 'plot', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'plot', 'true', 'metaphor', 'such', 'revealing', 'anything', 'semi-spoiler', 'Trying', 'not', 'ruin', 'fun', 'too', 'much', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'JCVD', 'been', 'misunderstood-', 'actor', 'person-', 'so', 'when', 'movie', 'weary-sounding', 'JCVD', 'robbing', 'post', 'office', 'sense', 'more', 'story', 'So', 'much', 'more.So', 'why', 'should', 'watch', 'JCVD', 'company', 'are', 'telling', 'very', 'direct', 'personal', 'story', 'audience', 'using', 'film', 'medium-', 'high', 'art', '34', 'climax', '34', 'movie', 'really', 'when', 'JCVD', 'raised', 'set', 'deliver', 'impassioned', 'monologue', 'directly', 'camera', 'stage', 'lights', 'equipment', 'clearly', 'visible', 'Eyes', 'full', 'tears', 'apologizing', 'mistakes', 'full', 'hope', 'pride', 'accomplishments', 'soul', 'world', 'openly', 'reservation', 'Then', 'end', 'lowered', 'back', 'scene', 'rolls', 'right', 'back', 'script', 'breaking', 'one-shot', 'must', 'be', 'seen.Fans', 'JCVD', 'kung-fu', 'movies', 'general', 'will', 'get', 'lots', 'what', 'want', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'scenes', 'quips', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'People', 'who', ""'ve"", 'stared', 'wondered', 'time', 'who', 'guy', 'why', 'making', 'bad', 'movies', 'will', 'get', 'explanation', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'not', 'clearcut', 'expect', 'Movie', 'fans', 'general', 'just', 'well-made', 'movie', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'action', 'movie', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'French', 'subtitles.Also', 'note', 'do', 'watch', 'bonus', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'just', 'few', 'cuts', 'there', 'demonstrate', 'good', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'long', 'single-shots', 'open', 'film', 'including', 'much', 'ad-libbing', 'JCVD', 'elements', 'add', 'lot', 'difficulty', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'jab', 'Van', 'Damme', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'style', 'personal', 'intricate', 'plot', 'really', 'show', 'heart', 'went', 'film', 'all-time', 'classic', 'JCVD', 'should', 'be', 'staple', 'fight', 'films', 'arthouse', 'together', 'movie', 'more', 'man', 'biopic', 'ever', 'will']",N/A
1230099,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001PWY4NG,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","""JCVD"" exhibits another side of Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, who gives an affecting dramatic performance that pokes fun at his movies, his age, his aphorisms, and his fans. Of course, he's playing himself. Returning to Brussels after a disappointing trip to Hollywood, Van Damme politely poses for pictures with a few fans before hurrying off to withdraw some money from a Post Office bank. But the bank is being robbed by three men who take Van Damme hostage. A police officer who sees Van Damme through a window assumes he is one of the criminals. The criminals decide it's a good idea to go along with this perception. Meanwhile, a crowd of fans gathers in the street outside to cheer their favorite action hero on.Mabrouk El Mechri directed and co-wrote this smart dark comedy. He spares neither Van Damme nor his fans. Van Damme, the character, is an aging action hero whose career is on the skids, his personal life at a low point, and he's short of cash. He's a nobody in Hollywood, but everyone in Belgium worships him and knows the details of his private life. Stressed and sleep-derived, Van Damme ends up in the middle of a robbery, where everyone's expectations of him make it difficult to do the right thing. He's a sympathetic character with real troubles. The film has a dark aesthetic that borders on murky at times. But its impressive melange of ideas build tension and incorporate some action, all the while being clever, funny, and insightful. In English and French with subtitles.The DVD (PeaceArch 2009): The film is available in several language versions. The theatrical release is in French and English with English subtitles for the French. There is an English version that dubs the French in English.

1230101,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B001PWY4NG,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 1]","What would Jean Claude Van Damme do if he really did find himself in a situation that calls for an action hero?  This film envisions JCVD as an aging action star, in the midst of a heated custody battle and losing all the good action roles to Steven Seagal. He finds himself stuck in the middle of a hostage crisis, and, unlike in the movies, he knows in this case his fists and feet won't save anybody.  In the thrilling opening sequence, a single take from a film within the film, after dispatching an entire military unit almost entirely unarmed, he asks the director why he always has to throw away his guns, and the response is that his character eschews guns for the sake of purity.  In real life, though, he knows he's helpless with a gun to his head.Ironically, what the situation calls for is brain rather than the brawn he portrays in his classic martial arts pictures.  It's a surprisingly honest set up and performance, that acknowledges all of the cliches and jokes one might raise about the man and his movies, at the same time as it highlights the fact that he really is just a guy who dreamed big and worked hard and did something.  In a pivotal monologue, Van Damme wonders what it was he really accomplished and it feels utterly authentic.  A hometown hero in Brussels for ""making it"" in Hollywood, sure, but he knows his films are also something of a joke, and at least as depicted here his life is a mess.  For all the punishment he takes to make the fight scenes authentic, there's something that always feels fake about his action films; here, even though there's less actual fighting, he takes an emotional beating and it really feels genuine, even if most of it is in fact scripted.  There's still a quasi-documentary feel to it all.  Obviously recommended for fans of JCVD.  I never was (though I still recall the visceral thrill of watchingKickboxer-- I could laugh, but it was impressive and thrilling too).  Who wouldn't dig this?  It's a rare action film with good acting, and a very clever screenplay.",4,It's not easy for an aging action star -- a surprisingly funny and poignant film about  the original hard target,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,2031,"['What', 'would', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'do', 'really', 'did', 'find', 'situation', 'action', 'hero', 'film', 'JCVD', 'aging', 'action', 'star', 'midst', 'heated', 'custody', 'battle', 'losing', 'good', 'action', 'roles', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'stuck', 'middle', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'movies', 'case', 'fists', 'feet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'save', 'anybody', 'thrilling', 'opening', 'sequence', 'single', 'take', 'film', 'film', 'dispatching', 'entire', 'military', 'unit', 'almost', 'entirely', 'unarmed', 'director', 'why', 'always', 'throw', 'away', 'guns', 'response', 'character', 'guns', 'sake', 'purity', 'real', 'life', 'though', 'helpless', 'gun', 'head.Ironically', 'what', 'situation', 'brain', 'rather', 'brawn', 'classic', 'martial', 'arts', 'pictures', 'surprisingly', 'honest', 'set', 'up', 'performance', 'cliches', 'jokes', 'one', 'might', 'raise', 'man', 'movies', 'same', 'time', 'fact', 'really', 'just', 'guy', 'who', 'dreamed', 'big', 'worked', 'hard', 'did', 'something', 'pivotal', 'monologue', 'Van', 'Damme', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'accomplished', 'utterly', 'authentic', 'hometown', 'hero', 'Brussels', 'making', 'Hollywood', 'sure', 'films', 'are', 'also', 'something', 'joke', 'least', 'depicted', 'here', 'life', 'mess', 'punishment', 'make', 'fight', 'scenes', 'authentic', 'something', 'always', 'feels', 'fake', 'action', 'films', 'here', 'even', 'less', 'actual', 'fighting', 'emotional', 'beating', 'really', 'genuine', 'even', 'most', 'fact', 'scripted', 'still', 'quasi-documentary', 'feel', 'Obviously', 'recommended', 'fans', 'JCVD', 'never', 'was', 'still', 'recall', 'visceral', 'thrill', 'watchingKickboxer', 'could', 'laugh', 'was', 'impressive', 'thrilling', 'too', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'dig', 'rare', 'action', 'film', 'good', 'acting', 'very', 'clever', 'screenplay']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[9, 12]","It's been a long time since I've willfully watched anything starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, but the premise of JCVD just kind of caught me off guard.  Van Damme basically does play himself here: a washed up actor who blew his Hollywood stardom and is stuck in a bitter custody battle over his daughter.  He's reduced to starring in sub-par B-movies, and on top of it all, he's broke.  Now back in Brussels, Van Damme goes on his way to the post office to sort out his money situation, only to walk head first into a robbery, where the crooks make it look like he's the one behind it.  Despite many of the reviews on here, JCVD is neither fantastic nor dreadful, it just falls somewhere in between.  However, for Van Damme fans, JCVD is a must see.  Van Damme is unusually good playing himself, and his monologue to the camera towards the end of the film is especially heartfelt.  The film's main flaws lie mostly in its pacing and dialogue, but for what it's worth, JCVD ends up being more or less a shining moment for Van Damme, and that in itself is quite an accomplishment.",3,Van Damme as himself?

1230106,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B001PWY4NG,Robert Badgley,"[1, 3]","If any of you have followed my recent activity in reviews you know one of my latest was a Jean Claude Van Damme two pack with Replicant and,what I thought was one of Van Dammes best efforts,Legionnaire.In that I intimated there was more to this star than just his action movie work and I said the movie showed what he was capable of.I also stated that it was kind of a coming out for me to admit I was a JCVD fan at all,but there it is.So what has this to do with this movie,JVCD? Well soon after I posted that review one of my friends who is definitely NOT a JCVD fan begrudging suggested I watch JVCD.""Why,you don't like him?"",I queried.""Just watch it,you'll see"",he replied.So I did...and wow! This is the one,folks.This movie,JCVD(released June/08),illustrates the point I tried to make in that recent review.THIS is what Van Damme was/is capable of doing and it is in short.....spectacular.The story takes us inside and outside the movie business throughout its' 97 minute duration.It starts off with Van Damme systematically fighting his way through a bevy of bad guys and situations.There are clues along the way but in a short time a director yells ""cut"" and we are on a movie set with Van Damme trying to tell a snobbish oriental producer with plenty of attitude,c/w translator,that he thought he could have done it better.But his pleas fall on deaf ears,as Van Damme can only shake his head in disgust.The scene then switches to him talking to his producer about lining up a new production.His agent suggests one title with a totally inane name,but he's already shot it.He suggests another equally ridiculous title but it's a sequel-a number 2.Further along in their discussion is a very telling verbal exchange about how movies are financed and how actors are used  while others get rich off of their name.""Haven't I always taken care of you?"",his agent asks? First it's a pig headed director now it's a leach of an agent.We then find Van Damme in court trying unsuccessfully to get custody of his daughter.The opposing lawyer is citing a list of his movies which ""even I wouldn't watch"",as a prosecution tactic.It works;Van Damme loses again.On the way to the airport heading back to Belgium,Van Damme gets a call from his attorney saying his cheque bounced and he needs payment right away.Once back home he stops at a post office to get some money.When he steps out of his cab two fans accost him for a picture which he obligingly poses for,then he walks across the street.A short time later alarm bells go off and shots are heard from the post office.A policeman who happened to arrive after he went inside goes over to the post office only to be waved away by Van Damme.He tries to enter but gets shot.Van Damme has apparently tried to rob the post office and has taken hostages.The truth is another matter.As the movie smartly unfolds the answers before us through visual hints and circumstance-connected replays,we find out after Van Damme entered the post office he became a hostage himself.Three men had already entered,had taken hostages and had been attempting to steal from the post office when,to their bad luck,Van Damme entered the picture.They force Van Damme to be their ""connection"" to the police and thus perpetuate the lie that HE is the hostage taker and not them.Van Damme is beaten and even shot throughout the ordeal showing alot of vulnerability.At one point with a television in the background,the chair Van Damme is sitting in suddenly lifts upward to reveal a partial set and /lighting in the background.He now comes out of the scene,smashing the fourth wall betwixt actor and audience,and delivers a very touching soliloquy.Rehearsed or not(it appears ad-libbed)it is totally riveting.He starts with ""There you are,you and me"",looking very disheveled,not like a ""movie star"" and not like the 47 years old he was at the time.""You made my dreams come true-I promised you something in return and(tearing)I haven't delivered yet.You win,I lose"".He talks about the hurdles he has had to face in his career,his younger years in karate and the ""dojo"" principal that he came to respect,live by and believe in.But naively he found others in the business didn't have the same principals and he got caught up in the whole movie world thing with all its' ups and downs.He goes on to speak of his cocaine addiction and the media's very shallow reporting of his unfortunate circumstances,no matter how self inflicted they may have been.He questions his career and success.His emotions over flow when he says he can't understand why people with so much better talent than he have not made it in the business.He asks what he has done with his life:""What have I done on this Earth?.......nothing"".Letting us know that he has to put the fourth wall back up soon he says he may die in the post office.But with a parting shot before he does he says""It's hard for me to judge people,but hard for them NOT to judge me.Yeah...something like that"",wiping tears from his face.And with that the fourth wall goes back up and the chair slowly lowers back into the room and the movie continues.In point of fact the fourth wall was actually breached twice.This time and when JCVD first entered the post office to get his funds.Frustrated,emotionally upset and drained he stops,looks around and says out loud that this must be candid camera,then pointing he says ""Camera....camera....camera"".One of them is the one we're looking at him through and he's being filmed with.The hostage taking and negotiations between Van Damme(for the real robbers)and the police continue.Van Damme makes a connection with one of the robbers named Arthur,who at one point(in a funny scene)asks him to demonstrate a kick boxing move by kicking a cigarette out of the mouth of another hostage.Van Damme protests but relents,cleanly removing the cigarette with a quick leg lift.When Arthur tries it,he knocks the guy out!The entire crisis comes to a crumbling end when Arthur shoots and kills the crook-in-charge and then the police storm the post office.Arthur is killed as Van Damme pleads with him to not shoot.Then Van Damme is taken hostage by the remaining crook.The scene plays out two ways-the first as we might expect it to happen in a Van Damme movie,with a great scissor kick and down goes the bad guy,and the actual way,Van Damme is able to subtly elbow punch the crook in the gut and the police move in.But Van Damme is arrested and is convicted of extortion,with two years probation and a year of actual prison time!!The reason?:it seems a suggestion Van Damme made to the crooks during the siege to send $495,000 to his attorney instead of asking the cops for a movie-like million dollars,was actually done.Unreal? Yep,but this is the movies...or is it?The movie ends with Van Damme's mother visiting him in prison.After a brief exchange she presents him with a surprise.After a few seconds his daughter is sitting on the other side of the glass with phone in hand and she says ""Hi"".Van Damme just stares in disbelief for a few telling seconds,then quickly picks up the phone and returns the ""Hi"".He lightly hits himself on the side of the head with the phone as brutal ""reality"" comes around again-cut to black.This is Van Damme at his rawest and most vulnerable both personally and as an actor.It is full at gibes at the industry he has slaved in for many years and which has taken advantage of him and his colleagues for their own self interests and profit.There is quite the telling moments when Arthur and he sit discussing his career.Arthur tells him he was the one who brought famed Hong Kong director Johnny Woo to Hollywood and what thanks did he get?.Then when asked about a movie Arthur thought he had coming up Van Damme says that Steven Seagal got the part not him,because he(Seagal)offered to cut off his pony tail.""You're way better than him"",Arthur says emphatically.Technically the film has been transferred well to DVD and it is filmed in a sepia toned style to give it a better impact and poignancy.You get the original French version and the English version with sub-titles.The theatrical trailer is here,as well as two deleted scenes.The second one is very telling and I highly recommend it be watched to get a further understanding of Van Damme's personal thoughts on life and his career.And oh yes watch for that funny animated credit opening,which is not the usual Gaumont film company opening.The usual is a little boy picking a daisy which floats and becomes the Gaumont logo.This time Van Damme enters the scene and when he asks the boy for the daisy he is rebuked and...drop kicks him!The film is both a telling commentary on Hollywood and everything that goes with it and a scathing self-reality check for Van Damme himself.The ""real"" interposed within his ""natural"" environment of the ""unreal"".Unsettling at times and aimed straight for our guts from Van Damme's heart.Highly recommended!",5,What JCVD is capable of.A great performance!,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,8919,"['have', 'followed', 'recent', 'activity', 'reviews', 'know', 'one', 'latest',

plans that will keep him playing B rated action movies for large sums of quick cash) who stumbles into a robbery situation, which he is then accused of being the instigator of, while it's taking place.The problem with the execution is, the pacing, which makes this movie feel like a slowly paced stage play; so slow in fact as to become actually boring, real fast.I personally only managed to sit through 45 minutes of this thing before I had to watch something else for fear of acquiring Narcolepsy (or for fear of having my brains slide down into my shoes, as can sometimes happen, when one finds oneself watching something so boring, as to actually make the prospect of watching grass grow, seem like a pleasure).Now, I've managed to sit, all the way through, some really inane drivel, but this movie just couldn't keep my interest enough for me to really care, what the outcome of the film would be.If you really want to see Van Damme stretch his acting chops then I'd suggest you check out, WAKE OF DEATH and/or IN HELL, both films are chalk full of action sequences, but also give Van Damme a great platform to show us some surprisingly good, dramatic acting abilities.I had some high hopes for this film, but was ultimately disappointed with the story and pacing (I will say this much for the film though, it does have one of the best opening credit scenes that I've ever seen (although, even though it's suppose to be one continuous scene with no camera brakes, you can still see the camera ""cheats"" that were done to accomplish this effect) it's just too bad that the rest of the movie couldn't live up to the imaginative scope of the opening scene).",2,"Van Damme Snore Fest, And Here's Why...",1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,2447,"['pretty', 'boring.Seriously.I', 'had', 'heard', 'stuff', 'film', 'was', 'suppose', 'show', 'Van', 'Damme', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'well', 'new', 'light', 'boring', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'Van', 'Damme', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'call', 'anything', 'so-so', 'actor', 'etc', 'boring', 'word', 'would', 'never', 'million', 'years', 'thought', ""'d"", 'ever', 'use', 'describe', 'film', 'only', 'word', 'can', 'think', 'describe', 'movie', 'performance', 'boring', 'actual', 'plot', 'film', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Van', 'Damme', 'discontented', 'B', 'rated', 'action', 'star', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'actor', 'pining', 'small', 'part', 'relevant', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'management', 'plans', 'plans', 'will', 'keep', 'playing', 'B', 'rated', 'action', 'movies', 'large', 'sums', 'quick', 'cash', 'who', 'robbery', 'situation', 'then', 'accused', 'being', 'instigator', 'taking', 'place.The', 'problem', 'execution', 'pacing', 'movie', 'feel', 'slowly', 'paced', 'stage', 'play', 'so', 'slow', 'fact', 'become', 'actually', 'boring', 'real', 'fast.I', 'personally', 'only', 'managed', 'sit', '45', 'minutes', 'thing', 'had', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'fear', 'acquiring', 'Narcolepsy', 'fear', 'having', 'brains', 'slide', 'down', 'shoes', 'can', 'sometimes', 'happen', 'when', 'one', 'watching', 'something', 'so', 'boring', 'actually', 'make', 'prospect', 'watching', 'grass', 'grow', 'seem', 'pleasure', '.Now', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'sit', 'way', 'really', 'inane', 'drivel', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'interest', 'enough', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'outcome', 'film', 'would', 'be.If', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Van', 'Damme', 'stretch', 'acting', 'chops', 'then', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'check', 'out', 'WAKE', 'OF', 'DEATH', 'and/or', 'IN', 'HELL', 'films', 'are', 'chalk', 'full', 'action', 'sequences', 'also', 'give', 'Van', 'Damme', 'great', 'platform', 'show', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'abilities.I', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'was', 'ultimately', 'disappointed', 'story', 'pacing', 'will', 'say', 'much', 'film', 'have', 'one', 'best', 'opening', 'credit', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'even', 'suppose', 'be', 'one', 'continuous', 'scene', 'camera', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'camera', 'cheats', 'were', 'done', 'accomplish', 'effect', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'rest', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'imaginative', 'scope', 'opening', 'scene']",N/A
1230111,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B001PWY4NG,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[1, 1]","Damme!  Who knew that Jean Claude can really act?This movie is trippy.  I enjoyed it so much that I told many people about it and lent it out to whomever would bite and, thusly, I have lost this gem.  But my friends who also watched it agreed that the movie was a surprise, and a headscratcher as it left you off-balance and kind of wondering what was exactly what.  This piece of fiction, if you want to call it that, feels at once like a ""found footage"" film largely unfolding in real time for the most part.  However, if you have a cursory idea of Jean Claude Van Damme and his history, you'll begin to wonder if it is part documentary with the titularly initialed star exposing his all-to-real and painful life onscreen.  Lastly, you'll be scratching your head as you wonder if this movie is really a movie or publicity stunt or what as it has elements of light action but is not particularly close to a normal Jean Claude action flick.  I'm serious about all of this!  Like I said, this movie is trippy.  For those who want to know more, warning, spoilers ahead:The movie starts off like a typical low-budget straight-to-video Jean Claude turd.  He is wading through some war conflict, kicking the bad guy's patooties, and it looks particularly bad.  The stunt men miss their marks, Damme himself is slow and not throwing his punches or kicks in a powerful way, and the special effect technicians are off on their timing while blowing stuff up.  Damme bears the brunt of the director's wrath and it is revealed that we are watching the real man himself get chewed out on the set of the movie that he's starring in by his director.  It's not a happy time for him and he's having real trouble keeping up with what is required of him.  The film then shifts to showing Damme driving through the countryside having a variety of phone calls and arguments with family and business partners and exposing to us, the audience, that he is in dire straits due to how he has (mis)conducted his life and his affairs.  Drug use, financial mismanagement, affairs, he doesn't spare us from his real life misadventures nor does he hide how they have come close to ruining him.  He is trying to get someone to give him some coin as he needs it pronto in order to be able to do something involving his kids (I forget what exactly) and he goes to a bank.  Well, guess what?  While he's there a bank robbery occurs and he's one of the hostages.  The robbers recognize him but still don't spare him; they're careful with him because they've seen his movies and know what he's capable of.  In the ensuing squalor Damme has a couple of ""out of body"" moments where he speaks directly to the camera and waxes philosophical about his real life and the predicament that he is in.  He's just another regular joe amongst the rest of the hostages and he gets beat up a bit.  He doesn't rush in, play hero, and save the day against all odds.  Mind you, he becomes the hero and does save the day at the end of the film (by utilizing a move he's trained in and uses in all of his films) but he leaves the bank the same beleaguered man that had entered that bank.  There is no resolution over than a tacit admission that his schlocky film career was good for something.This is, simply put, an utterly fascinating movie.  But people who aren't fans of Damme won't watch it and fans will watch it and go, ""What the hell?""  It's unusual in that it alienates both of its target audiences.  And that's truly unfortunate as so many people won't get to see this odd and wonderful movie; it is not ""one of his best"" movies, it is his best movie.  And that's from someone who loves ""Bloodsport"".",5,Jean Claude's confessional film is a fantastic piece of cinema verite!,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,3655,"['Damme', 'Who', 'knew', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'movie', 'trippy', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'told', 'many', 'people', 'lent', 'out', 'whomever', 'would', 'bite', 'thusly', 'have', 'lost', 'gem', 'friends', 'who', 'also', 'watched', 'agreed', 'movie', 'was', 'surprise', 'headscratcher', 'left', 'off-balance', 'kind', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'piece', 'fiction', 'want', 'call', 'feels', 'once', 'found', 'footage', 'film', 'largely', 'unfolding', 'real', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'However', 'have', 'cursory', 'idea', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'history', ""'ll"", 'begin', 'wonder', 'part', 'documentary', 'titularly', 'initialed', 'star', 'exposing', 'all-to-real', 'painful', 'life', 'onscreen', 'Lastly', ""'ll"", 'be', 'scratching', 'head', 'wonder', 'movie', 'really', 'movie', 'publicity', 'stunt', 'what', 'elements', 'light', 'action', 'not', 'particularly', 'close', 'normal', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'action', 'flick', ""'m"", 'serious', 'said', 'movie', 'trippy', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'warning', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'movie', 'typical', 'low-budget', 'straight-to-video', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'turd', 'wading', 'war', 'conflict', 'kicking', 'bad', 'guy', 'patooties', 'particularly', 'bad', 'stunt', 'men', 'miss', 'marks', 'Damme', 'slow', 'not', 'throwing', 'punches', 'kicks', 'powerful', 'way', 'special', 'effect', 'technicians', 'are', 'timing', 'blowing', 'stuff', 'up', 'Damme', 'brunt', 'director', 'wrath', 'revealed', 'are', 'watching', 'real', 'man', 'get', 'chewed', 'out', 'set', 'movie', 'starring', 'director', 'not', 'happy', 'time', 'having', 'real', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', 'what', 'required', 'film', 'then', 'showing', 'Damme', 'driving', 'countryside', 'having', 'variety', 'phone', 'calls', 'arguments', 'family', 'business', 'partners', 'exposing', 'audience', 'dire', 'straits', 'due', 'how', 'mis', 'conducted', 'life', 'affairs', 'Drug', 'use', 'financial', 'mismanagement', 'affairs', ""n't"", 'spare', 'real', 'life', 'misadventures', 'hide', 'how', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'ruining', 'trying', 'get', 'someone', 'give', 'coin', 'pronto', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'something', 'involving', 'kids', 'forget', 'what', 'exactly', 'bank', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'bank', 'robbery', 'occurs', 'one', 'hostages', 'robbers', 'recognize', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'spare', ""'re"", 'careful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'know', 'what', 'capable', 'ensuing', 'squalor', 'Damme', 'couple', 'body', 'moments', 'where', 'directly', 'camera', 'waxes', 'philosophical', 'real', 'life', 'predicament', 'just', 'regular', 'joe', 'rest', 'hostages', 'beat', 'up', 'bit', ""n't"", 'rush', 'play', 'hero', 'save', 'day', 'odds', 'Mind', 'hero', 'save', 'day', 'end', 'film', 'utilizing', 'move', 'trained', 'uses', 'films', 'bank', 'same', 'beleaguered', 'man', 'had', 'entered', 'bank', 'resolution', 'tacit', 'admission', 'schlocky', 'film', 'career', 'was', 'good', 'something.This', 'simply', 'put', 'utterly', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'Damme', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'fans', 'will', 'watch', 'go', 'What', 'hell', 'unusual', 'target', 'audiences', 'truly', 'unfortunate', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'odd', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'best', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'Bloodsport']",N/A
1230112,A2NS64R3Q3SFUA,B001PWY4NG,T. Madigan,"[2, 3]","JCVD.  It's one of the best movies I've seen this year.  Although it had only a limited 2008 theatrical release, it is now widely available on Blu-Ray and DVD.The movie is fictional, and yet highly auto-biographical for action star Jean-Claude Van Damme (J.C.V.D.), who was a huge Hollywood star peaking in the early 1990's.  Van Damme plays himself.  A former A-list actor now struggling to make b-movies and hard up for cash in the midst of a child custody battle.  He's tired.  He's 47 years old.  And he keeps losing the few roles he can get his hands on to Steven Seagal.  But he's still buff, and when he does land a role, he's still able to deliver the acrobatic kicks that have been his trade mark since 1988.JCVD begins as a movie within a movie.  Van Damme kicks, punches and shoots his way out of some war-torn Asian city until part of the set collapses.  An out-of-breath Van Damme tries to explain to the complacent director that he's too old to do every scene in one take.  The director scoffs and says, ""He thinks we're making Citizen Kane.""Cut to the courtroom where his child custody battle ensues.  His daughter admits she is the butt of jokes due to her has been father.  Then we see his agent won't help him get a role in a studio movie (Van Damme even offers to do it for free).  His lawyer calls him to say his check bounced and is about to drop the child custody case.And exhausted and desperate Van Damme returns to his birthplace in Belgium where the locals are still eager to meet him and have their picture taken with him.  But Van Damme runs into trouble when he gets caught up in a post office hold-up and the authorities mistake him for the criminal.  We soon learn that there are hostages inside, including a child and a wounded man, and the authorities reach out to Van Damme (who we find out later is being held at gun point while on the phone with the cops) and ask what his demands are.I won't spill any more of this entertaining story, except I must mention the movie's surprising centerpiece.  As we march towards the climax, a bloodied and exhausted Van Damme resigns himself to a chair amongst the other hostages, seemingly giving up hope, and then something completely extraordinary happens that no one would see coming.  He jumps up and disarms all three crooks with one mighty karate kick?  Nope.The narrative halts as Van Damme's chair is lifted into the rafters where we can clearly see that he is on a movie set.  He looks right into the camera and begins one of the most moving monologues I can ever remember seeing.  His eyes fill with tears as he truthfully recounts how he came to Hollywood with nothing, not even knowing English, but that he believed in his dreams.  He goes on to talk about his ups and downs, how he got hooked and then beat drugs, how he believes in love and honor (what the martial arts taught him), and how the devils in tinsel town really treat people, and the real-life Hollywood producers' quote he uses will stun viewers.  He can't help but to break down and cry as he admits he is tortured when he sees those less fortunate than him who are just as talented if not more so.  He openly wonders why he was successful when so many are not.  In an unheard of position of vulnerability, and perhaps redeeming the guilt he might have for making violent movies, the action star concludes with genuine tears streaking down his face, ""it's so stupid to kill people, they're so beautiful!""Without this piece, the movie's smart, entertaining and good.

In ""JCVD"" the Belgium-born action star (sort of) plays himself: a 48-year-old actor whose life is falling apart. In LA he fights for the custody of his daughter in court and he has lost his latest job to another action star with a ponytail. In fact ""JCVD"" is an off-beat comedy in which Jean-Claude Van Damme finds himself trapped in a most curious situation back in his hometown.Belgian/Luxembourgian/French-made ""JCVD"" is largely set in Brussels. Jean-Claude Van Damme has come back to his hometown. Though he is obviously tired after the legal battle, the star is a very nice guy as the clerk (and his big fan) at the local rental video shop finds. Then Van Damme goes to a post office and something unusual happens. For the reasons explained later on, a gun fires and an officer is shot at from inside the post office. In ""Dog Day Afternoon""-like hostage situation that follows, the action star is now a robber.What really happened will be told later in a ""Rashomon"" way. ""JCVD,"" it is certain, contains elements of thriller, but actually the film is more effective as a unique off-beat comedy in which Van Damme virtually plays himself. French-born director Mabrouk El Mechri (his second feature film) is clearly a fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, but the director, and the star too, isn't afraid of telling and showing what most of us feel about Van Damme's career. At one scene Van Damme even talks directly to the screen. And the scene is pretty long.Here Van Damme is no heroic figure and he is surprisingly credible as the star trying to get his life back together. The supporting actors are all effective, especially Zinedine Soualem as a short-tempered man and Karim Belkhadra, a guard who is also an avid Van Damme fan. The film has a gimmick narrative structure based on the star's own life, but the gimmick doesn't work without decent performances from the players, which ""JCVD"" has.In spite of its clever concept, however, ""JCVD"" has flaws. I think the film needs a better way to wrap up the story, and some parts of the film look a bit repetitious. At times it seems the film doesn't know where it is going. Still ""JCVD"" is an enjoyable film featuring Van Damme as himself with his signature high kicks. But remember, here his high kicks are used in a totally different context.",4,(3.5 STARS) JCVD: Jean-Claude Van Damme Playing Himself,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,2447,"['JCVD', 'course', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'film', 'Timecop', 'Hard', 'Target', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', 'here', 'JCVD', 'Belgium-born', 'action', 'star', 'sort', '48-year-old', 'actor', 'life', 'falling', 'apart', 'LA', 'custody', 'daughter', 'court', 'lost', 'latest', 'job', 'action', 'star', 'ponytail', 'fact', 'JCVD', 'off-beat', 'comedy', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'trapped', 'most', 'curious', 'situation', 'back', 'hometown.Belgian/Luxembourgian/French-made', 'JCVD', 'largely', 'set', 'Brussels', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'come', 'back', 'hometown', 'obviously', 'tired', 'legal', 'battle', 'star', 'very', 'nice', 'guy', 'clerk', 'big', 'fan', 'local', 'rental', 'video', 'shop', 'Then', 'Van', 'Damme', 'post', 'office', 'something', 'unusual', 'reasons', 'explained', 'later', 'gun', 'fires', 'officer', 'shot', 'post', 'office', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', '-like', 'hostage', 'situation', 'action', 'star', 'now', 'robber.What', 'really', 'happened', 'will', 'be', 'told', 'later', 'Rashomon', 'way', 'JCVD', 'certain', 'elements', 'thriller', 'actually', 'film', 'more', 'effective', 'unique', 'off-beat', 'comedy', 'Van', 'Damme', 'virtually', 'French-born', 'director', 'Mabrouk', 'El', 'Mechri', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'clearly', 'fan', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'director', 'star', 'too', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'telling', 'showing', 'what', 'most', 'feel', 'Van', 'Damme', 'career', 'one', 'scene', 'Van', 'Damme', 'even', 'directly', 'screen', 'scene', 'pretty', 'long.Here', 'Van', 'Damme', 'heroic', 'figure', 'surprisingly', 'credible', 'star', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'effective', 'especially', 'Zinedine', 'Soualem', 'short-tempered', 'man', 'Karim', 'Belkhadra', 'guard', 'who', 'also', 'avid', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fan', 'film', 'gimmick', 'narrative', 'structure', 'based', 'star', 'own', 'life', 'gimmick', ""n't"", 'work', 'decent', 'performances', 'players', 'JCVD', 'has.In', 'spite', 'clever', 'concept', 'however', 'JCVD', 'flaws', 'think', 'film', 'better', 'way', 'wrap', 'up', 'story', 'parts', 'film', 'look', 'bit', 'repetitious', 'times', 'film', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'going', 'Still', 'JCVD', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'featuring', 'Van', 'Damme', 'signature', 'high', 'kicks', 'remember', 'here', 'high', 'kicks', 'are', 'used', 'totally', 'different', 'context']",N/A
1230114,A1QF10TB8AYTA3,B001PWY4NG,"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja""","[0, 1]","I've heard next to nothing about this movie except for the fact that van Damme apparently acted very well in this movie. So I checked it out and I have to say that the movie is certainly interesting, and I don't mean that in a bad way.On the same token, it's not exactly a movie I liked or loved, but it wasn't bad or terrible either! It was just interesting, and unfortunately I think that drifts the movie into &#34;meh&#34; territory which is sad. The movie had an interesting way of progressing the plot for you, almost 3 different POV's documenting when JCVD goes into the post office.Really, there's not much plot in this movie. It's mainly about JCVD kind of... venting, which is the best way I could describe it. It talks about his custody battle issues with his kid, going back to Belgium in order to rediscover himself, and I'm not sure... but I think there were money issues hinted at but it didn't make sense. He made it seem like he had money and that he was having trouble with his bank, yet he was having trouble paying his lawyer, so that didn't make any sense to me.Anyway, the main highlight of this movie is the monologue JCVD gives to the audience. It was delivered with such authenticity that you couldn't tell whether he was acting or if it was real. Unfortunately, the monologue alone isn't enough to recommend this movie, a whole lot of nothing happens. If anything, I'd recommend watching the speech on youtube but maybe skipping the movie altogether unless you're a huge JCVD fan.",3,Interesting but hard to rate with the star system.,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,1506,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'next', 'nothing', 'movie', 'fact', 'van', 'Damme', 'apparently', 'acted', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'So', 'checked', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'way.On', 'same', 'token', 'not', 'exactly', 'movie', 'liked', 'loved', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'terrible', 'was', 'just', 'interesting', 'unfortunately', 'think', 'movie', '34', 'meh', '34', 'territory', 'sad', 'movie', 'had', 'interesting', 'way', 'progressing', 'plot', 'almost', '3', 'different', 'POV', 'documenting', 'when', 'JCVD', 'post', 'office.Really', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'mainly', 'about', 'JCVD', 'kind', 'venting', 'best', 'way', 'could', 'describe', 'custody', 'battle', 'issues', 'kid', 'going', 'back', 'Belgium', 'order', 'rediscover', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', 'were', 'money', 'issues', 'hinted', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'made', 'had', 'money', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'bank', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'paying', 'lawyer', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'me.Anyway', 'main', 'highlight', 'movie', 'monologue', 'JCVD', 'audience', 'was', 'delivered', 'such', 'authenticity', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'acting', 'was', 'real', 'Unfortunately', 'monologue', 'alone', ""n't"", 'enough', 'recommend', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'nothing', 'happens', 'anything', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'speech', 'youtube', 'maybe', 'skipping', 'movie', 'altogether', ""'re"", 'huge', 'JCVD', 'fan']",N/A
