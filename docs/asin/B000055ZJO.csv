Vivian Morgan is a scientist and just as she is about to prove the existance of a graviton particle, she is blasted back in timeto the 6th century! Confused as a troll for her dreadlocks, skin color, and tennis shoes, she is sentinced to be burned at the stake. But when a total eclips happens, she claims to be a wizard more powerful than Merlin. They release her and she is knighted. She does good things such as helping King Arthur see that the slaves should be free, but when she tries to make things like a steam engine far to early, how messed up will the 6th century turn? and how will she ever get back to the 20th century?",5,Whoopi is fantastic!,989798400,"05 14, 2001",2001,721,"['movie', 'mor', 'funny', 'comedies', 'come', 'theaters', 'almost', 'died', 'laughing', 'Vivian', 'Morgan', 'scientist', 'just', 'prove', 'existance', 'graviton', 'particle', 'blasted', 'back', 'timeto', '6th', 'century', 'Confused', 'troll', 'dreadlocks', 'skin', 'color', 'tennis', 'shoes', 'sentinced', 'be', 'burned', 'stake', 'when', 'total', 'eclips', 'happens', 'be', 'wizard', 'more', 'powerful', 'Merlin', 'release', 'knighted', 'good', 'things', 'such', 'helping', 'King', 'Arthur', 'see', 'slaves', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'when', 'make', 'things', 'steam', 'engine', 'far', 'early', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'will', '6th', 'century', 'turn', 'how', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'back', '20th', 'century']",N/A

However, when I bought the video and saw it again, I realized it was awkward, poorly paced, and silly. The idea of a black woman scientist becoming King Arthur's sorceress (like merlin) is novel, but the delivery doesn't follow through. There are pointed gags that fall flat, and there are inevitable bathroom gags of her having to go potty while in a suit of armor.Best part was the battle where Goldberg defeats a competing &#34;advisor&#34; to King Arthur. But the use of that portable stereo repeatedly got on my nerves. However, another reason I got this was the presence of Amanda Donohoe as the queen, and of course Peter O'Toole as King Arthur.

I don't remember Jumpin' Jack Flash very well, so maybe that's one movie of hers that I didn't care for.  This movie isn't on the top of my Whoopie list either.The movie tells the story of a scientist who is suddenly displaced in time by Merlin.  While in Camelot, Whoopie introduces a lot of important concepts and principles that keep the values of Camelot alive.  Apparently, without her interference, Camelot would never have come out of the Dark Ages.  All of this is at the apparent behest of the master magician and king's advisor Merlin...who constantly annoys and challenges Mr. Boss (as the scientist requests to be called).In the end, we learn there is more to Merlin than his role in Camelot.  A scientist learns about her role in the world, but gives it up to play second fiddle to Merlin's universal explorations and interferences.Overall the idea was cute.  Whoopi did a great job of creating a loveable character.  However the experiment that displaced her and the far fetched ending didn't settle right with me.  I think it was disturbing because it really wasn't a happily ever after ending but more like a completely new begining for a character and a situation that presented no longevity.Only Whoopi Goldberg's fans can truely appreciate this charming comedy.  It is completely appropriate for children and presents such a simple plot line and familiar moral that people around the world will recognize it and enjoy it.

I have seen Michael York in a few films, and loved Whoopi in both Sister Act movies, and the more serious The Long Walk Home. We start with a softare designer working on a project of her own to act as a time machine, until something goes ""blooey"" and sends her back to Camelot days. Finding herself facing King Arthur himself, Queen Gwenevere and Sir Lancelot (she cautions them to be more discreet) and then Merlin. She is put in jail awating her burning when she uses her laptop to discover a solar eclipse is coming. Knowing men of the days of yore had no knowledge of such an event, she makes believe she is using her magic powers to blot out the sun, and is set free so she can restore it. Knighted by King Arthur, she chooses the name Sir Boss, and so begins her adventures in Camelot. I found the storyline easy to follow, on par with other fantasy movies, but enjoyed watching these people get used to Sir Boss and her strange music box. Near the end, she takes King Arthur outside thw castle and face-to-face with normal people. He finds out firsthand how cruel his laws have been and vows to change them, which brings to an end Sir Boss' stay in the dark ages and is returned to her present time.
