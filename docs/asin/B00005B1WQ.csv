579698,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005B1WQ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Now that I have an `almost three-year-old', Shirley Temple movies feel like a nice alternative to the stuff shoveled in the mouths of our youth today.  They are wholesome, encouraging, lavish and entertaining.  I was never a huge fan in my youth, and am just now getting into some of her films.  I was rather excited to sit down and watch this film with my daughter.  She was excited about seeing the ""princess movie"" and I was excited to see a father/daughter film.That, and I am a big fan of the '95 remake.For me, this film is a tad lackluster.  The remake, in my humble opinion, was a better film all around.  Shirley was a very accomplished actor for her young age, but for me she is far better suited for jovial productions.  Even her musical numbers in this film feel bogged down by the overall somber mood of the film, and the one fantasy sequence feels thrown in for some enchantment, and it doesn't quite fit for me.I guess I should scream POSSIBLE SPOILERS right here.The story is a beautiful one.  I say that because it really shows the inseparable bond between a father and a daughter.  Yes, I understand that liberties were taken with the ending (both this film and the '95 remake have your typical happy Hollywood ending) but that does not bother me in the slightest.  This is a children's film, and it is good to allow our children the ability to find a happy ending in tough times.  I am not one for lying to children, but there should be a certain amount of sugar-coating allowed.  Besides, my daughter was very anxious to have Sarah reunited with her ""daddy"" so I'm glad that she got what she wanted.  The film centers around young Sarah as she is separated from her father, who is a soldier.  Her father goes off to war and Sarah is sent to a boarding school.  When her father appears to have died, the evil headmistress banishes Sarah to the attic and sells all her belongings, forcing her to work to pay off her debt to the school.But Sarah never gives up hope that her father will come find her.The acting is fine, with no real standouts.  Like I said, the film was not a great fit for Temple.  I did find some of the pot points to be a little farfetched and a tad distracting (how in the world was Sarah able to sneak in and out so much?) but overall this is a fine family film that was enjoyable.  I still consider the '95 remake to be a better film though, and I highly recommend you see that one.But, like my daughter said as the credits began to roll, ""I liked that one"", and that is what is most important.",3,Lukewarm Shirley Temple...,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,2535,"['Now', 'have', 'almost', 'three-year-old', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movies', 'feel', 'nice', 'alternative', 'stuff', 'shoveled', 'mouths', 'youth', 'today', 'are', 'wholesome', 'encouraging', 'lavish', 'entertaining', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'fan', 'youth', 'am', 'just', 'now', 'getting', 'films', 'was', 'rather', 'excited', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'daughter', 'was', 'excited', 'seeing', 'princess', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'father/daughter', 'film.That', 'am', 'big', 'fan', ""'95"", 'remake.For', 'film', 'tad', 'lackluster', 'remake', 'humble', 'opinion', 'was', 'better', 'film', 'around', 'Shirley', 'was', 'very', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'young', 'age', 'far', 'better', 'suited', 'jovial', 'productions', 'Even', 'musical', 'numbers', 'film', 'feel', 'bogged', 'down', 'overall', 'somber', 'mood', 'film', 'one', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'feels', 'thrown', 'enchantment', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'me.I', 'guess', 'should', 'scream', 'POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS', 'right', 'story', 'beautiful', 'one', 'say', 'really', 'inseparable', 'bond', 'father', 'daughter', 'Yes', 'understand', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'ending', 'film', ""'95"", 'remake', 'have', 'typical', 'happy', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'not', 'bother', 'slightest', 'children', 'film', 'good', 'allow', 'children', 'ability', 'find', 'happy', 'ending', 'tough', 'times', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'lying', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'certain', 'amount', 'sugar-coating', 'allowed', 'daughter', 'was', 'very', 'anxious', 'have', 'Sarah', 'reunited', 'daddy', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'what', 'wanted', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'Sarah', 'separated', 'father', 'who', 'soldier', 'father', 'war', 'Sarah', 'sent', 'boarding', 'school', 'When', 'father', 'have', 'died', 'evil', 'headmistress', 'banishes', 'Sarah', 'attic', 'belongings', 'forcing', 'work', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'school.But', 'Sarah', 'never', 'up', 'hope', 'father', 'will', 'come', 'find', 'her.The', 'acting', 'fine', 'real', 'standouts', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'fit', 'Temple', 'did', 'find', 'pot', 'points', 'be', 'little', 'farfetched', 'tad', 'distracting', 'how', 'world', 'was', 'Sarah', 'able', 'sneak', 'so', 'much', 'overall', 'fine', 'family', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'still', 'consider', ""'95"", 'remake', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'one.But', 'daughter', 'said', 'credits', 'began', 'roll', 'liked', 'one', 'what', 'most', 'important']",N/A
579699,A23WW967L3V194,B00005B1WQ,Angie,"[2, 2]","In 1939, the year in which this movie with Shirley Temple was published, another well-known movie that has become a huge hit appeared on the screens of the movie-theaters - ""The Wizard Of Oz"", which, immediately, casts a big shadow in front of all the other films out this year then!Among those viewers aged enough, it is not a secret that Shirley Temple was a serious candidate for participate in this film as the main character of Dorothy, the American Legendary girl that most people like.Luckily, it was Judy Garland who was chosen to play Dorothy, and little Shirley Temple was to become Sarah Crewe in another beautiful film that is too often overlooked in comparison to the ""wizard""...I can only thank the choice of those producers who have rejected the appearance of Miss Temple in the 1939 officially successful movie, because I sincerely believe that there is not and never will be a child that is perfect at playing Sara Crewe more than Temple - including the child in the new version (or at least the least old version) of ""The Little Princess"".Watching the two versions in two different occasions, I must say that the modern version is not bad at all - but for some reason I still have a warm spot in my heart for the original with Shirley Temple, and even to the present day, I find something magical here.Sara Crewe has all things a child can dream of owning: Beautiful dresses, pretty dolls, piles of toys, and she is rather popular among her friends. Especially she has the most magnificent treasure: the love of her father, a sergeant who loves his little girl enormously. One day, he is asked to go and serve his country in the army. Sarah must stay in a youth facility, and her father then promises that soon he will return from his military service, so they will be together again, without separating. In her new school, Sarah finds friends, who treat her with affection and respect. All goes well, until that fateful day she receives the tragic news of his father's death during the war. From here, the opposite of happiness occurs to poor Sarah, who quickly falls along the social layer - from a sweet little princess suddenly she becomes a miserable servant, and all the other children are not allowed to direct even one word towards her.But our Sarah is made of steel, appears, and her spirit is not yet broken because she still believes that her father is alive and that she will come out of this horrible condition she got into.Until she finds out the truth, however, Sarah is happy to have a new friend, the sweet little Beckie, another child-servant, another slave like her, who lives in dreams and hopes as well as Sarah, and no less than Sarah.It is, really, a film that contributes the atmosphere of other and older times, innocence that has not to be found more in this world, and combined with fantastic songs, joyful dances and very well written dialogues between all of the characters, it is a creation to keep and watch it more than once, plus the price is quite attractive too. If you need (or can afford to buy) only one Shirley Temple movie, I really recommend this one as the best choice.",5,"Nothing, simply nothing can defeat the faith and spirit of a child!",1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,3129,"['1939', 'year', 'movie', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'was', 'published', 'well-known', 'movie', 'become', 'huge', 'hit', 'appeared', 'screens', 'movie-theaters', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'immediately', 'big', 'shadow', 'front', 'other', 'films', 'out', 'year', 'then', 'viewers', 'aged', 'enough', 'not', 'secret', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'was', 'serious', 'candidate', 'participate', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Dorothy', 'American', 'Legendary', 'girl', 'most', 'people', 'like.Luckily', 'was', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'who', 'was', 'chosen', 'play', 'Dorothy', 'little', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'was', 'become', 'Sarah', 'Crewe', 'beautiful', 'film', 'too', 'often', 'overlooked', 'comparison', 'wizard', 'can', 'only', 'thank', 'choice', 'producers', 'who', 'have', 'rejected', 'appearance', 'Miss', 'Temple', '1939', 'officially', 'successful', 'movie', 'sincerely', 'believe', 'not', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'child', 'perfect', 'playing', 'Sara', 'Crewe', 'more', 'Temple', 'including', 'child', 'new', 'version', 'least', 'least', 'old', 'version', 'Little', 'Princess', '.Watching', 'two', 'versions', 'two', 'different', 'occasions', 'must', 'say', 'modern', 'version', 'not', 'bad', 'reason', 'still', 'have', 'warm', 'spot', 'heart', 'original', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'even', 'present', 'day', 'find', 'something', 'magical', 'here.Sara', 'Crewe', 'things', 'child', 'can', 'dream', 'owning', 'Beautiful', 'dresses', 'pretty', 'dolls', 'piles', 'toys', 'rather', 'popular', 'friends', 'Especially', 'most', 'magnificent', 'treasure', 'love', 'father', 'sergeant', 'who', 'little', 'girl', 'enormously', 'One', 'day', 'asked', 'go', 'serve', 'country', 'army', 'Sarah', 'must', 'stay', 'youth', 'facility', 'father', 'then', 'soon', 'will', 'return', 'military', 'service', 'will', 'be', 'together', 'again', 'separating', 'new', 'school', 'Sarah', 'friends', 'who', 'treat', 'affection', 'respect', 'well', 'fateful', 'day', 'tragic', 'news', 'father', 'death', 'war', 'here', 'opposite', 'happiness', 'occurs', 'poor', 'Sarah', 'who', 'quickly', 'social', 'layer', 'sweet', 'little', 'princess', 'suddenly', 'miserable', 'servant', 'other', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'direct', 'even', 'one', 'word', 'towards', 'her.But', 'Sarah', 'made', 'steel', 'spirit', 'not', 'yet', 'broken', 'still', 'father', 'alive', 'will', 'come', 'horrible', 'condition', 'got', 'into.Until', 'out', 'truth', 'however', 'Sarah', 'happy', 'have', 'new', 'friend', 'sweet', 'little', 'Beckie', 'child-servant', 'slave', 'who', 'dreams', 'hopes', 'as', 'well', 'Sarah', 'less', 'Sarah.It', 'really', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'other', 'older', 'times', 'innocence', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'more', 'world', 'combined', 'fantastic', 'songs', 'joyful', 'dances', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'dialogues', 'characters', 'creation', 'keep', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'price', 'quite', 'attractive', 'too', 'need', 'can', 'afford', 'buy', 'only', 'one', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movie', 'really', 'recommend', 'one', 'best', 'choice']",N/A

579703,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00005B1WQ,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","In this version of a very familiar story, at least we are in London, like the book. But many other things are different. The opening scenes with Sara and her father are similar, except that Miss Minchin first says there is no room, and then changes her tune when he finds out Captain Crewe is rich, and his father is an aristocrat.Also, instead of Minchen having a plump sister, she has a tall brother (Arthur Treacher) and the feminine aspects of her sister are put onto Rose, one of the teachers. The love interest for Rose is the riding master. Becky is cockney, not black. In fact, several things were returned to the way they are in the book due to the fact that they did not move from London to New York, as in the 1995 movie.There's nowhere near as much focus on Sara's relationship with the other girls, either before or after her father's reported death. Instead of all the stories Sara told to the other girls, we have a major dream sequence, all done in rhyme, which is very cute. Sara is really a princess, Arthur Treacher is her jester, and Minchin is the wicked old witch who accuses the loving couple of breaking a law against stealing a kiss in public. Of course, the princess and the jester ultimately conclude that the kiss was not stolen, but given freely.One other major thing is original to this film, and was probably put in to showcase Sara. Sara does not believe her father is dead. Treacher indulges her in this, and when he gets assigned to the hospital where the wounded from the Boer War are being taken, he lets Sara go through the wards to look for him. And, coincidentally, to do a cute song and dance routine for the patients.When she goes to the hospital to try to find her father on the day when she is running from Minchin and the police because Minchin has accused her of stealing the things Ram Dass put into her room while she was asleep, she's not supposed to go in. Of course, she gives the guard the slip and sneaks in anyway. Turns out Queen Victoria is visiting. Victoria assigns one of the military brass to take Sara around so she can search for her father. And while it's not that simple, she does indeed find her father, who has been suffering from amnesia, and makes him believe that his Sara is there.It's a more lovable rendition of the book than the 1995 movie, good as it was, but then I'm a big Shirley Temple fan.",4,One of Shirley Temple's Best,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2367,"['version', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'least', 'are', 'London', 'book', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Sara', 'father', 'are', 'similar', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'first', 'room', 'then', 'tune', 'when', 'out', 'Captain', 'Crewe', 'rich', 'father', 'aristocrat.Also', 'instead', 'Minchen', 'having', 'plump', 'sister', 'tall', 'brother', 'Arthur', 'Treacher', 'feminine', 'aspects', 'sister', 'are', 'put', 'Rose', 'one', 'teachers', 'love', 'interest', 'Rose', 'riding', 'master', 'Becky', 'cockney', 'not', 'black', 'fact', 'several', 'things', 'were', 'returned', 'way', 'are', 'book', 'due', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'move', 'London', 'New', 'York', '1995', 'movie.There', 'nowhere', 'as', 'much', 'focus', 'Sara', 'relationship', 'other', 'girls', 'father', 'reported', 'death', 'Instead', 'stories', 'Sara', 'told', 'other', 'girls', 'have', 'major', 'dream', 'sequence', 'done', 'rhyme', 'very', 'cute', 'Sara', 'really', 'princess', 'Arthur', 'Treacher', 'jester', 'Minchin', 'wicked', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'loving', 'couple', 'breaking', 'law', 'stealing', 'kiss', 'public', 'course', 'princess', 'jester', 'ultimately', 'conclude', 'kiss', 'was', 'not', 'stolen', 'given', 'freely.One', 'other', 'major', 'thing', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'put', 'showcase', 'Sara', 'Sara', 'not', 'believe', 'father', 'dead', 'when', 'assigned', 'hospital', 'where', 'wounded', 'Boer', 'War', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'Sara', 'go', 'wards', 'look', 'coincidentally', 'do', 'cute', 'song', 'dance', 'routine', 'patients.When', 'hospital', 'try', 'find', 'father', 'day', 'when', 'running', 'Minchin', 'police', 'Minchin', 'accused', 'stealing', 'things', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'put', 'room', 'was', 'asleep', 'not', 'supposed', 'go', 'course', 'guard', 'slip', 'sneaks', 'anyway', 'out', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'visiting', 'Victoria', 'one', 'military', 'brass', 'take', 'Sara', 'can', 'search', 'father', 'not', 'that', 'simple', 'indeed', 'find', 'father', 'who', 'been', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'believe', 'Sara', 'more', 'lovable', 'rendition', 'book', '1995', 'movie', 'good', 'was', 'then', ""'m"", 'big', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'fan']",N/A

Turning, as they had done with 1937's HEIDI, to classic literature for a new story idea, they chose the classic novel &quot;A Little Princess&quot; by Frances Burnett.THE LITTLE PRINCESS gave Temple her first real dramatic role, as well as showing off her astute singing and dancing skills in a lavish dream sequence.Sharing the screen with Temple is a wonderful and capable supporting cast including Arthur Treacher (MARY POPPINS), Mary Nash (who also co-starred with Temple in HEIDI), Marcia Mae Jones (also from HEIDI), Anita Louise, Arthur Malet, Caesar Romero and Sybil Jason (who would go on to co-star with Temple again the following year in THE BLUE BIRD).The film is a lovingly-crafted tale of young Sara Crewe, who is sent to Miss Minchin's school for girls during the Boer War when her father is called into service.  When her father is listed as missing in action, the girl is forced into labor at the school in order to repay the debt she owns to Miss Minchin.Stunning color photography, a good three years before the system was fully-developed, and an equally-colorful script engage the viewer from beginning to end.Utterly delightful, and still regarded as one of Temple's best films.",4,pleasant-enough Temple vehicle,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,1357,"['MGM', 'successful', 'Technicolor', 'fantasy', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'set', 'box', 'office', 'fire', 'Fox', 'decided', 'give', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'big', 'Techicolor', 'vehicle', 'well', 'Turning', 'had', 'done', '1937', 'HEIDI', 'classic', 'literature', 'new', 'story', 'idea', 'chose', 'classic', 'novel', 'quot', 'Little', 'Princess', 'quot', 'Frances', 'Burnett.THE', 'LITTLE', 'PRINCESS', 'gave', 'Temple', 'first', 'real', 'dramatic', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'off', 'astute', 'singing', 'dancing', 'skills', 'lavish', 'dream', 'sequence.Sharing', 'screen', 'Temple', 'wonderful', 'capable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Arthur', 'Treacher', 'MARY', 'POPPINS', 'Mary', 'Nash', 'who', 'also', 'co-starred', 'Temple', 'HEIDI', 'Marcia', 'Mae', 'Jones', 'also', 'HEIDI', 'Anita', 'Louise', 'Arthur', 'Malet', 'Caesar', 'Romero', 'Sybil', 'Jason', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'co-star', 'Temple', 'again', 'following', 'year', 'THE', 'BLUE', 'BIRD', '.The', 'film', 'lovingly-crafted', 'tale', 'young', 'Sara', 'Crewe', 'who', 'sent', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'school', 'girls', 'Boer', 'War', 'when', 'father', 'called', 'service', 'When', 'father', 'listed', 'missing', 'action', 'girl', 'forced', 'labor', 'school', 'order', 'repay', 'debt', 'Miss', 'Minchin.Stunning', 'color', 'photography', 'good', 'three', 'years', 'system', 'was', 'fully-developed', 'equally-colorful', 'script', 'engage', 'viewer', 'beginning', 'end.Utterly', 'delightful', 'still', 'regarded', 'one', 'Temple', 'best', 'films']",N/A

I own &quot;A Little Princess&quot; the book, the movie from 1995 and a version from the eighties. Just a few hours ago I bought the one with Shirley Temple and it wasn't very good. Here's why:It lacked several of the most beautiful elements from the book: Ermengarde and Lottie, kind Amelia Minchin, the Large family, Melchisedic, and the sister-like relationship between Sara and Becky. The people who wrote the script obviously didn't respect the author's ending as she intended it to be. Although we may not have liked what happened in the book, but that's how it should have been. At least in the 1995 version they made the ending exciting and unforgettable.Another thing, Shirley Temple was all WRONG for the portrayal of Sara Crewe. Sara was a shy, quiet, intelligent child who had the body of a child but the brain of an old spirit. She was into story-telling and make-believe. Shirley Temple, even in the movie, was hooked onto singing, dancing, and being adorable, when Sara is supposed to have a sour, grown-up yet lovable expression on her face. Now don't get me wrong-I love Shirley-she's my favourite actress-but she shouldn't have been cast in this movie. If you still want to see it though, I suggest the 1995 version-which was really beautiful and touching. It really sticks to the book, but the ending was changed so the makers could call it their own story.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 5]","Shirley Temple was in the waning years of being a child star when she starred as Sara Crewe in this movie, her first completely in Technicolor.  Shirley brings her own interpretation to this classic story, and this movie has a lot of appeal to Shirley Temple fans.Sara Crewe's father Captain Reginald Crewe (Ian Hunter) is off to fight in the Second Boer War and leaves Sara at Miss Minchin's academy.  Mary Nash, who played Fr&auml;ulein Rottenmeier in the 1937 Shirley Temple film ""Heidi"", plays Miss Minchin.  Life is good for Sara until Captain Crewe appears on a list of those killed in the war.  Suddenly Sara's life is thrown into turmoil as she is relegated to a dark cold attic and all her possessions are taken away.Sara manages to persevere against adversity and continues to look for her father among the wounded returning from the war.  One of the most charming scenes from the movie occurs around the point when Ram Dass (the late and always excellent Cesar Romero) aids Sara by providing her with food, blankets and coal for her usually unlit stove.As this film goes into its final scenes, Miss Minchin accuses Sara of stealing, she meets the Queen of England, and the police and Miss Minchin chases Sara through a hospital, ever hopeful that she will find her father.  How will Sara manage to avoid jail?  Will she ever find her father?  Watch and see!There have been at least half a dozen versions of ""A Little Princess"" filmed.  Shirley Temple's version deviates quite a bit from the Frances Hodgson Burnett classic.  Excluding the vague relationship between this movie and Burnett's classic, this movie is enjoyable as a Shirley Temple movie.  Shirley does a fine job of keeping her spirits up while suffering significant changes in her life.  She always finds the sunny side even though she admits that it is sometimes difficult to do that.If you are looking for a version of ""A Little Princess"" that is closer to the Burnett classic, try the 1995 version starring Liesel Matthews as Sara Crewe.Good luck!",4,Shirley Temple's Version,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,2025,"['Shirley', 'Temple', 'was', 'waning', 'years', 'being', 'child', 'star', 'when', 'starred', 'Sara', 'Crewe', 'movie', 'first', 'completely', 'Technicolor', 'Shirley', 'own', 'interpretation', 'classic', 'story', 'movie', 'lot', 'appeal', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'fans.Sara', 'Crewe', 'father', 'Captain', 'Reginald', 'Crewe', 'Ian', 'Hunter', 'fight', 'Second', 'Boer', 'War', 'Sara', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'academy', 'Mary', 'Nash', 'who', 'played', 'Fr', 'auml', 'ulein', 'Rottenmeier', '1937', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'film', 'Heidi', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'Life', 'good', 'Sara', 'Captain', 'Crewe', 'list', 'killed', 'war', 'Suddenly', 'Sara', 'life', 'thrown', 'turmoil', 'relegated', 'dark', 'cold', 'attic', 'possessions', 'are', 'taken', 'away.Sara', 'manages', 'persevere', 'adversity', 'look', 'father', 'wounded', 'returning', 'war', 'One', 'most', 'charming', 'scenes', 'movie', 'point', 'when', 'Ram', 'Dass', 'late', 'always', 'excellent', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'aids', 'Sara', 'providing', 'food', 'blankets', 'coal', 'usually', 'unlit', 'stove.As', 'film', 'final', 'scenes', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'Sara', 'stealing', 'Queen', 'England', 'police', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'Sara', 'hospital', 'ever', 'hopeful', 'will', 'find', 'father', 'How', 'will', 'Sara', 'manage', 'avoid', 'jail', 'Will', 'ever', 'find', 'father', 'Watch', 'see', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'dozen', 'versions', 'A', 'Little', 'Princess', 'filmed', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'version', 'quite', 'bit', 'Frances', 'Hodgson', 'Burnett', 'classic', 'Excluding', 'vague', 'relationship', 'movie', 'Burnett', 'classic', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movie', 'Shirley', 'fine', 'job', 'keeping', 'spirits', 'up', 'suffering', 'significant', 'changes', 'life', 'always', 'sunny', 'side', 'even', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'do', 'that.If', 'are', 'looking', 'version', 'A', 'Little', 'Princess', 'closer', 'Burnett', 'classic', 'try', '1995', 'version', 'starring', 'Liesel', 'Matthews', 'Sara', 'Crewe.Good', 'luck']",N/A

Shirley and the rest of the cast act very convincingly throughout the film; and the plot held my interest. The choreography and cinematography enhance the movie quite a bit.The action begins in England in 1899 at the start of the Boer War. Captain Reginald Crewe (Ian Hunter) is being deployed to South Africa to fight in the Boer War; and he is leaving his rather pampered and emotionally vulnerable child Sara (Shirley Temple) at a prestigious seminary for girls run by a nasty old lady named Amanda Minchin (Mary Nash). Amanda Minchin runs the school although Hubert 'Bertie' Minchin (Arthur Treacher) also lives with her.It isn't long before Sara befriends two of the staff at the school: Geoffrey Hamilton (Richard Greene) and Rose (Anita Louise), her teacher. She also befriends a young servant girl at the seminary named Becky (Sybil Jason).The war doesn't end quite as quickly as planned. In fact, things become rather nasty--and, after several long months Sara must celebrate her birthday in the seminary without her father. There is a sweet exchange of presents just before the horrific news comes that Sara's father was killed in the war and Sara is left penniless. Amanda Minchin suddenly isn't so accommodating toward Sara; she makes Sara a servant at the seminary until her bills can be paid off; and Sara must live in a dingy old and dirty room in the attic that isn't even fit for a dog.Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. How will Sara handle the huge change going from pampered little rich girl to servant in the seminary? Will the other girls tease her or show sympathy for Sara? What about Sara's insistence that her father is alive--is Sara dreaming this all up or could it be true? Sara even goes so far as to search army hospitals to try to find her father. Well, there are no plot spoilers here--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!The ballet sequence is marvelous to behold; this is Sara's dream of being out of the hands of the evil villain, that nasty Amanda Minchin. The dancing and the music are quite good.The DVD has few extras. There is a brief trivia quiz about the movie; and we get a brief one screen long biography about Shirley Temple's career and her life after leaving show business. Sorry, folks!Overall, The Little Princess is a fine movie vehicle for Shirley Temple. Expect some great performances from Mary Nash as Amanda Minchin and Arthur Treacher as Bertie Minchin looks great dancing with little Shirley. I highly recommend this film for fans of Shirley Temple; and people who enjoy classic movies from the golden era of Hollywood would do well to get this film.",5,"with grace, talent and natural charm, Shirley made this movie fly !!!",1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,2720,"['Little', 'Princess', 'excellent', 'movie', 'starring', 'great', 'child', 'star', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Shirley', 'rest', 'cast', 'act', 'very', 'convincingly', 'film', 'plot', 'held', 'interest', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'enhance', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit.The', 'action', 'England', '1899', 'start', 'Boer', 'War', 'Captain', 'Reginald', 'Crewe', 'Ian', 'Hunter', 'being', 'deployed', 'South', 'Africa', 'fight', 'Boer', 'War', 'leaving', 'rather', 'pampered', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'child', 'Sara', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'prestigious', 'seminary', 'girls', 'run', 'nasty', 'old', 'lady', 'named', 'Amanda', 'Minchin', 'Mary', 'Nash', 'Amanda', 'Minchin', 'school', 'Hubert', ""'Bertie"", 'Minchin', 'Arthur', 'Treacher', 'also', 'her.It', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Sara', 'two', 'staff', 'school', 'Geoffrey', 'Hamilton', 'Richard', 'Greene', 'Rose', 'Anita', 'Louise', 'teacher', 'also', 'young', 'servant', 'girl', 'seminary', 'named', 'Becky', 'Sybil', 'Jason', '.The', 'war', ""n't"", 'end', 'quite', 'as', 'quickly', 'planned', 'fact', 'things', 'become', 'rather', 'nasty', 'several', 'long', 'months', 'Sara', 'must', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'seminary', 'father', 'sweet', 'exchange', 'presents', 'just', 'horrific', 'news', 'Sara', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'war', 'Sara', 'left', 'penniless', 'Amanda', 'Minchin', 'suddenly', ""n't"", 'so', 'accommodating', 'Sara', 'servant', 'seminary', 'bills', 'can', 'be', 'paid', 'off', 'Sara', 'must', 'live', 'dingy', 'old', 'dirty', 'room', 'attic', ""n't"", 'even', 'fit', 'dog.Of', 'course', 'here', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'How', 'will', 'Sara', 'handle', 'huge', 'change', 'going', 'pampered', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'servant', 'seminary', 'Will', 'other', 'girls', 'tease', 'show', 'sympathy', 'Sara', 'What', 'Sara', 'insistence', 'father', 'alive', 'Sara', 'dreaming', 'up', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'Sara', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'search', 'army', 'hospitals', 'try', 'find', 'father', 'Well', 'are', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'ballet', 'sequence', 'marvelous', 'behold', 'Sara', 'dream', 'being', 'hands', 'evil', 'villain', 'nasty', 'Amanda', 'Minchin', 'dancing', 'music', 'are', 'quite', 'good.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'brief', 'trivia', 'quiz', 'movie', 'get', 'brief', 'one', 'screen', 'long', 'biography', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'career', 'life', 'leaving', 'show', 'business', 'Sorry', 'Overall', 'Little', 'Princess', 'fine', 'movie', 'vehicle', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Expect', 'great', 'performances', 'Mary', 'Nash', 'Amanda', 'Minchin', 'Arthur', 'Treacher', 'Bertie', 'Minchin', 'great', 'dancing', 'little', 'Shirley', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'movies', 'golden', 'era', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'film']",N/A

While the author changed several things to make it interesting the underlying theme was dear to her heart and the reader is able to feel the emotion that was poured into the pages of those books.  The script for ""The Little Princess"" does not have that feeling.  In fact, we are given the impression that people call Sara The Little Princess because she pouts when she doesn't get her way.  In the book, Sara believes that she should try to act like what she thinks a princess should act like, even when bad things happen.

The movie starts with scenes from 1899 and the entire movie revolves around the war going on in South Africa as seen from a British perspective. The cinematography is superb and this is Shirley's first picture in Technicolor. There are a few song and dance routines.When Sara and her father arrive in London, England, Captain Crewe is again called away to serve his country. Since they just arrived from India, Sara must find a school quickly so her father can leave for military duty.""Why are they sending so many soldiers daddy, if it is only going to be a little war?"" --Sara CreweIn Sara's mind, her father is invincible. She never imagines that he might not make it through the war. Since she has never been away from her father for any extended time, the separation is more difficult for her.After a tearful goodbye, the brave little Sara must face the unkind Miss Minchin who runs the Seminary for Young Ladies. Here, reputation is of the utmost concern and due to her wealthy status, she is treated well (at first).During her time at the school, she learns to ride the pony her father purchased for her. Goeffrey Hamilton is her riding instructor who falls in love with her school teacher Rose. Miss Minchin will have none of that and tries to break up the relationship. Sara has other ideas and is quite the little matchmaker as always.This is a completely delightful movie which also includes a wonderful ballet scene which is quite funny and you will laugh at many jokes throughout the movie. The little maid Becky is very cute and seems to be Sara's only true friend. When something happens to Sara's father we think she will never stop looking for him.The beauty of the Shirley Temple films is their ability to teach children something great about life. Sara's hope, optimism and polite spirit helps her to fulfill her social obligations. When someone shows her a kindness, she is quick to show them one in return. I related well to this movie as my own father had gone to India when I was very young and then took me to Africa.

I can say that the latest film is miles better than this one. As Sara Crewe, Shirley Temple is WAY miscast. But since 20th Century Fox had her as their studio prodigy, it's pretty understandable. However, I never though she could really ACT, and this film didn't change my perception of her. When she tries to display emotions, she simply overacts during her numerous crying scenes in the film. Thank God this was one of her last films as a child star. In the 1995 remake, Liesel Matthews gave a more realistic child performance, didn't overact during her crying scenes, and she made me believe that her character was in danger and somehow suffering.

As a timeless story (now eighty years old) of perseverance in the face of adversity, the Little Princess evokes a full range of emotions rarely seen in modern cinema.  You'll tear up as a young Shirley is forced from her home, but you'll laugh and smile during the film's dancing (Shirley is quite an accomplished tap dancer) and singing routines.Film historians may delight to note that this was (to the best of my knowledge) the first Technicolor film that Temple starred in, and it noticeably shows, particularly when compared to some of Shirley's earlier works that have been newly colorized by classic film studio, Legend Films.

Before 2006, they were the only option for DVD viewing.  Thus, its viewers had to be content with blurry, and less than vivid Color Images!For fans of this timeless 1939 Shirley Temple Technicolor Classic, all you really need to know is that the 20th Century Fox Entertainment DVD release from 2006 is the ONLY version you'll want to own!For fans of DVD extras, the only ones here, apart from Scene Selection, have to do with Multiple Language Audio Tracks, Subtitles and English Closed Captioning.  There is also an option for English Stereo for anyone that doesn't wish to hear the original Monophonic Soundtrack.  Still, this is a lot more than is likely to be found on the Public Domain versions!For those who might still be less than satisfied with this Technicolor Restoration, it may help to keep in mind that in 1979, 20th Century Fox junked ALL of their 3 Strip Technicolor Negatives, the utilization of which are necessary in order to achieve the best possible restoration results.  Nevertheless, it is quite fortunate that a very good Safety Print of THE LITTLE PRINCESS was available for Digital Transfer!  As a previous Amazon Reviewer noted, this is beautifully Restored and Remastered, and the Colors in this 20th Century Fox Entertainment version are strikingly vivid, especially in comparison to the scratchy blurred PD Transfers that are commonly seen!  The only possibility of further improvement that I foresee would be an HD rescanning for BluRay, or some other future Media option!In conclusion, I once again reiterate the 20th Century Fox Entertainment DVD release is THE definitive version of the 1939 Shirley Temple Technicolor Classic, THE LITTLE PRINCESS.ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES!",5,THE LITTLE PRINCESS (1939) 20th Century Fox Entertainment DVD Is THE Definitive Version:  Accept NO Substitutes!,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,2011,"['meant', 'be', 'primarily', 'technical', 'review', 'see', 'need', 'help', 'separate', 'lone', 'stalk', 'wheat', 'mountain', 'chaff', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'many', 'Public', 'Domain', 'versions', 'varying', 'quality', 'Mostly', 'poor', 'fair', 'exist', '1939', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Technicolor', 'Feature', 'THE', 'LITTLE', 'PRINCESS', '2006', 'were', 'only', 'option', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'Thus', 'viewers', 'had', 'be', 'content', 'blurry', 'less', 'vivid', 'Color', 'Images', 'fans', 'timeless', '1939', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Technicolor', 'Classic', 'really', 'need', 'know', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Entertainment', 'DVD', 'release', '2006', 'ONLY', 'version', ""'ll"", 'want', 'own', 'fans', 'DVD', 'extras', 'only', 'ones', 'here', 'apart', 'Scene', 'Selection', 'have', 'do', 'Multiple', 'Language', 'Audio', 'Tracks', 'Subtitles', 'English', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'also', 'option', 'English', 'Stereo', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'wish', 'hear', 'original', 'Monophonic', 'Soundtrack', 'Still', 'lot', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'found', 'Public', 'Domain', 'versions', 'who', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'less', 'satisfied', 'Technicolor', 'Restoration', 'may', 'help', 'keep', 'mind', '1979', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'junked', '3', 'Strip', 'Technicolor', 'Negatives', 'utilization', 'are', 'necessary', 'order', 'achieve', 'best', 'possible', 'restoration', 'results', 'Nevertheless', 'quite', 'fortunate', 'very', 'good', 'Safety', 'Print', 'THE', 'LITTLE', 'PRINCESS', 'was', 'available', 'Digital', 'Transfer', 'previous', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer', 'noted', 'beautifully', 'Restored', 'Remastered', 'Colors', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Entertainment', 'version', 'are', 'strikingly', 'vivid', 'especially', 'comparison', 'scratchy', 'blurred', 'PD', 'Transfers', 'are', 'commonly', 'seen', 'only', 'possibility', 'further', 'improvement', 'foresee', 'would', 'be', 'HD', 'rescanning', 'BluRay', 'other', 'future', 'Media', 'option', 'conclusion', 'once', 'again', 'reiterate', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Entertainment', 'DVD', 'release', 'THE', 'definitive', 'version', '1939', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Technicolor', 'Classic', 'THE', 'LITTLE', 'PRINCESS.ACCEPT', 'NO', 'SUBSTITUTES']",N/A
