1084364,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000RXZL0E,trebe,"[0, 0]","The fourth season of I Dream of Jeannie (1968-69) continues in much the same direction as the previous season, as the stories remain outrageous, and loosely connected with reality, as new comedic realms are explored.Jeannie (Barbara Eden) and her master, Air Force Major Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman) are more of a couple than ever.  Except for her sister, Jeannie has virtually no female rivals, and the topic of marriage rarely arises.  Approaching the time when Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, would actually land on the moon, this season would feature Tony and fellow astronaut Roger Healey (Bill Daily), on their own mission to the moon.By now, the strange events that surround Tony, have become routine for Dr. Bellows (Hayden Rorke).  A change this season is the welcome return of Barton MacLane as General Peterson, and the reestablishment of the dynamic where Bellows unsuccessfully tries to convince Peterson and later General Schaeffer (Vinton Hayworth), that something is amiss.  With a little more emphasis on the happenings on the base, the role of Bellows' wife Amanda (Emmaline Henry) is reduced at bit, but she remains a kooky, offbeat, and very fun character.Barbara Eden assumes additional roles, one as her dark haired sister Jeannie #2, and also as her feisty mother.  Larry Hagman's physical talents are routinely exploited, as he flips, falls, and flies, all over the place.  An impressive display of his skills are featured in ""The Strongest Man In The World"", where Tony fights against a boxing champion.  This season doesn't have a ton of high profile guest stars, but boxer Jerry Quarry's appearance in this episode is one.One of the most momentous occasions occurs in ""Around the World in 80 Blinks"", as Tony, Roger, and mission commander Wingate (Richard Mulligan) are aboard Apollo 14 on a mission to the moon.  Unfortunately Jeannie has a cold, which affects her ""blinking"" powers, and Tony and Wingate, wind up back in Coco Beach, where they are seen by Amanda Bellows.  What should be a high point for the series, doesn't quite measure up, but the episode features a breakout performance by Emmaline Henry.Tony is a bit too old for the teenage scene, and this minor ""generation gap"" comes into play in ""Jeannie, My Guru"", where Nelson becomes the chaperone for a general's rebellious teenage daughter.  The subject of drugs is of course taboo, but when Tony's house becomes the scene of a wild party, it is probably the closest thing to a drug based hippie celebration you'll see in the series.Perhaps the new character with the most impact is Djinn Djinn, Jeannie's dog who can become invisible, and attacks anyone wearing a uniform.  The little guy appears in two episodes, ripping and shredding clothing, and terrorizing General Peterson.  Jeannie looks into the future in ""Jeannie, the Governor's Wife"", as Jeannie makes Tony an unwilling candidate for the governorship of Florida, as Roger eagerly assumes the position of campaign manager.In its fourth season, I Dream of Jeannie remains a fun program that while attempting to remain fresh and relevant, shows some signs of repetition, and unfortunately has some episodes that are real misfires.  Besides some uneven writing and lazy endings, there is also a lack of coordination.  The Apollo 14 mission to the moon episode, ""Around the World in 80 Blinks"", should probably have been the season finale.  Instead the episode ""Blackmail Order Bride"" is the finale, and features Tony and Roger as members of the ""Apollo 15"" mission.Evidently creator Sidney Sheldon and his staff decided that some major changes needed to be made, and so Jeannie and Tony would wed in the series' fifth and final season.  Image quality of the 26 episodes is generally good, although there are some instances of where quality suffers, or soft focus is evident.",4,the comedic madness continues in the fourth season of Jeannie ...,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,3844,"['fourth', 'season', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', '1968-69', 'much', 'same', 'direction', 'previous', 'season', 'stories', 'remain', 'outrageous', 'loosely', 'connected', 'reality', 'new', 'comedic', 'realms', 'are', 'explored.Jeannie', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'master', 'Air', 'Force', 'Major', 'Anthony', 'Nelson', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'are', 'more', 'couple', 'ever', 'sister', 'Jeannie', 'virtually', 'female', 'rivals', 'topic', 'marriage', 'rarely', 'Approaching', 'time', 'when', 'Apollo', '11', 'astronauts', 'Neil', 'Armstrong', 'Buzz', 'Aldrin', 'would', 'actually', 'land', 'moon', 'season', 'would', 'feature', 'Tony', 'fellow', 'astronaut', 'Roger', 'Healey', 'Bill', 'Daily', 'own', 'mission', 'moon.By', 'now', 'strange', 'events', 'surround', 'Tony', 'have', 'become', 'routine', 'Dr.', 'Bellows', 'Hayden', 'Rorke', 'change', 'season', 'welcome', 'return', 'Barton', 'MacLane', 'General', 'Peterson', 'reestablishment', 'dynamic', 'where', 'Bellows', 'unsuccessfully', 'convince', 'Peterson', 'later', 'General', 'Schaeffer', 'Vinton', 'Hayworth', 'something', 'amiss', 'little', 'more', 'emphasis', 'happenings', 'base', 'role', 'Bellows', 'wife', 'Amanda', 'Emmaline', 'Henry', 'reduced', 'bit', 'kooky', 'offbeat', 'very', 'fun', 'character.Barbara', 'Eden', 'additional', 'roles', 'one', 'dark', 'haired', 'sister', 'Jeannie', '2', 'also', 'feisty', 'mother', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'physical', 'talents', 'are', 'routinely', 'exploited', 'falls', 'flies', 'place', 'impressive', 'display', 'skills', 'are', 'featured', 'Strongest', 'Man', 'World', 'where', 'Tony', 'fights', 'boxing', 'champion', 'season', ""n't"", 'have', 'ton', 'high', 'profile', 'guest', 'stars', 'boxer', 'Jerry', 'Quarry', 'appearance', 'episode', 'one.One', 'most', 'momentous', 'occasions', 'World', '80', 'Blinks', 'Tony', 'Roger', 'mission', 'commander', 'Wingate', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'are', 'aboard', 'Apollo', '14', 'mission', 'moon', 'Unfortunately', 'Jeannie', 'cold', 'blinking', 'powers', 'Tony', 'Wingate', 'wind', 'up', 'back', 'Coco', 'Beach', 'where', 'are', 'seen', 'Amanda', 'Bellows', 'What', 'should', 'be', 'high', 'point', 'series', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'episode', 'breakout', 'performance', 'Emmaline', 'Henry.Tony', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'teenage', 'scene', 'minor', 'generation', 'gap', 'play', 'Jeannie', 'My', 'Guru', 'where', 'Nelson', 'chaperone', 'general', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'subject', 'drugs', 'course', 'taboo', 'when', 'Tony', 'house', 'scene', 'wild', 'party', 'probably', 'closest', 'thing', 'drug', 'based', 'hippie', 'celebration', ""'ll"", 'see', 'series.Perhaps', 'new', 'character', 'most', 'impact', 'Djinn', 'Djinn', 'Jeannie', 'dog', 'who', 'can', 'become', 'invisible', 'attacks', 'anyone', 'wearing', 'uniform', 'little', 'guy', 'two', 'episodes', 'ripping', 'shredding', 'clothing', 'terrorizing', 'General', 'Peterson', 'Jeannie', 'future', 'Jeannie', 'Governor', 'Wife', 'Jeannie', 'Tony', 'unwilling', 'candidate', 'governorship', 'Florida', 'Roger', 'eagerly', 'position', 'campaign', 'manager.In', 'fourth', 'season', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'fun', 'program', 'attempting', 'remain', 'fresh', 'relevant', 'signs', 'repetition', 'unfortunately', 'episodes', 'are', 'real', 'misfires', 'uneven', 'writing', 'lazy', 'endings', 'also', 'lack', 'coordination', 'Apollo', '14', 'mission', 'moon', 'episode', 'World', '80', 'Blinks', 'should', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'season', 'finale', 'Instead', 'episode', 'Blackmail', 'Order', 'Bride', 'finale', 'features', 'Tony', 'Roger', 'members', 'Apollo', '15', 'mission.Evidently', 'creator', 'Sidney', 'Sheldon', 'staff', 'decided', 'major', 'changes', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'so', 'Jeannie', 'Tony', 'would', 'wed', 'series', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', 'Image', 'quality', '26', 'episodes', 'generally', 'good', 'are', 'instances', 'where', 'quality', 'suffers', 'soft', 'focus', 'evident']",I Dream of Jeannie: Season 4
