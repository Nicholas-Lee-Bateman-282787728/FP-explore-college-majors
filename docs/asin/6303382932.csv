371083,AQCAWDBNNUS1E,6303382932,A. J. Sneed,"[1, 1]","What do you get when you combine a brilliant director, top writers, and  A list movie stars with a great screwball premise? Unfortunately, in this case a competent but less than ""classic"" film.I was anxious to see this film mostly because I have found so many of Claudette Colbert's comedies  to be so enjoyable. I also love Billy Wilder's style of humor. I had read an interview with Billy Wilder, and he was discussing the opening scene of this movie as one of his more memorable as a scriptwriter. Watching the first scene I could see why Wilder remembered it so fondly. They were able to build so much humor and innuendo out of that silly situation of a man who walks into a store and only wants to buy the top half of a pair of pajamas; and bumping into a woman in the store who only wants to buy the bottom ( remember the ""Code""). Of course, these two will become romantically entwined, and this ""goofy"" chance meeting sets the tone of the movie.In short: a rich American businessman meets a beautiful local lady in Nice whose petty aristocratic family is a bit down on their luck. He asks to marry her and she is eventually smitten ( after the obligatory resistance to his arrogance), but on their wedding day she finds out he has already been married 7 times. She goes through with the marriage anyway ( she really does love him), ostensibly for the money, but she really wants to teach him a lesson about his cavalier attitude toward matrimony. And off we go with a ""battle of the sexes"".The problem with much of the  movie is that Gary Cooper just doesn't have the right acting style or ""delivery"" to make the witty dialogue and sly humor pay off. It always feels like he is acting, and like he is slightly ""off key"", and it deadens the humor in what are some very funny situations with some very funny lines. Something about him is just not compatible to this style of humor. I compare him unfavorably to Joel McCrea who had a similar screen persona, but who was actually very effective in screwball-type comedies ( ""Palm Beach Story"" with Colbert, ""The More the Merrier"").Claudette Colbert, on the other hand was perfectly suited to this genre of comedy, and she performs well in this film, as do the rest of the well-known cast ( an exception is David Niven who is rather bland). She even pulls through some of the plot devices that seem a little contrived ( she is very convincing as a woman who has had too much to drink and lets her guard down).While this movie does not measure up to the top screwball comedies, it is still a pleasure to see what highly talented scriptwriters and directors could do for laughs by being clever and subtle; and in spite of the restrictive censorship Code.",3,Gary Cooper is always off  key,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,2704,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'combine', 'brilliant', 'director', 'top', 'writers', 'A', 'list', 'movie', 'great', 'screwball', 'premise', 'Unfortunately', 'case', 'competent', 'less', 'classic', 'film.I', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'film', 'mostly', 'have', 'found', 'so', 'many', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'comedies', 'be', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'love', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'style', 'humor', 'had', 'read', 'interview', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'was', 'discussing', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'scriptwriter', 'Watching', 'first', 'scene', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'Wilder', 'remembered', 'so', 'fondly', 'were', 'able', 'build', 'so', 'much', 'humor', 'innuendo', 'silly', 'situation', 'man', 'who', 'store', 'only', 'buy', 'top', 'half', 'pair', 'pajamas', 'bumping', 'woman', 'store', 'who', 'only', 'buy', 'bottom', 'remember', 'Code', 'course', 'two', 'will', 'become', 'romantically', 'entwined', 'goofy', 'chance', 'meeting', 'tone', 'movie.In', 'short', 'rich', 'American', 'businessman', 'beautiful', 'local', 'lady', 'Nice', 'petty', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'bit', 'down', 'luck', 'marry', 'eventually', 'smitten', 'obligatory', 'resistance', 'arrogance', 'wedding', 'day', 'out', 'already', 'been', 'married', '7', 'times', 'marriage', 'anyway', 'really', 'love', 'ostensibly', 'money', 'really', 'teach', 'lesson', 'cavalier', 'attitude', 'matrimony', 'go', 'battle', 'sexes', '.The', 'problem', 'much', 'movie', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'acting', 'style', 'delivery', 'make', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'sly', 'humor', 'pay', 'off', 'always', 'acting', 'slightly', 'key', 'humor', 'what', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'situations', 'very', 'funny', 'lines', 'Something', 'just', 'not', 'compatible', 'style', 'humor', 'compare', 'unfavorably', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'who', 'had', 'similar', 'screen', 'persona', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'effective', 'screwball-type', 'comedies', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story', 'Colbert', 'More', 'Merrier', '.Claudette', 'Colbert', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'genre', 'comedy', 'well', 'film', 'do', 'rest', 'well-known', 'cast', 'exception', 'David', 'Niven', 'who', 'rather', 'bland', 'even', 'plot', 'devices', 'seem', 'little', 'contrived', 'very', 'convincing', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'guard', 'down', 'movie', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'top', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'still', 'pleasure', 'see', 'what', 'highly', 'talented', 'scriptwriters', 'directors', 'could', 'do', 'laughs', 'being', 'clever', 'subtle', 'spite', 'restrictive', 'censorship', 'Code']",Bluebeard's Eighth Wife VHS

Claudette Colbert's undoing of her playboy husband Gary Cooper has some wonderfully humorous moments. But the parts are greater than the whole. However, if you  watch this as a forerunner to the Cooper/Wilder masterpiece, LOVE IN THE  AFTERNOON, made 20 years later, it is an extremely fascinating film. Wilder  made LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON as a tribute to his idol, Ernst Lubitsch, who  directed this. Cooper's jaded, aging roue works far better in AFTERNOON  than here in BLUEBEARD, perhaps because screwball farce wasn't the right  style for the plotline. That said, it is very much worth watching.

371091,A16QODENBJVUI1,6303382932,Robert Moore,"[5, 8]","This is a good news/bad news scenario. The bad news is that this is easily one of the worst films that Ernst Lubitsch ever made. The good news is that it is still pretty decent. Lubitsch set the standard by which all other comedy directors are to be judged, and he produced a body of film comedies that no other director can match. Nonetheless, he did not meet his own extraordinary standards in this film.  Billy Wilder, who wrote the screenplay for this film, probably came in a distant second for a career, and Preston Sturges had a five-year run that surpassed any five-year run by any director in film history, but alas, he burned out too quickly. Howard Hawks could match Lubitsch at his best, but Hawks never focused on any one genre for very long. His best comedies stand up to the best work of anyone, but he simply didn't direct that many comedies.The problem with this film is the central premise of the story, and therefore the fault can either be laid before Billy Wilder for the story or Lubitsch for not changing it. At the heart of the film is a bit of sadism. Claudette Colbert agrees to marry Gary Cooper on condition that he pay her a set amount of money if he agrees to divorce her. She then refuses to sleep with him, and through refusing to consummate their marriage, she literally drives him insane. Then, after he agrees to a divorce in the asylum (the scene where he maniacally repeats to himself, ""I feel fine, I feel very, very fine"" is one of the few embarrassing moments in any Lubitsch film), she comes back to marry him because she now has her own money. None of this is very convincing. I personally lay the fault before Wilder, because while he is one of my favorite directors, he was also capable of more than a little malevolence towards his main characters (think of the tortures through which he puts Jack Lemmon's C. C. Baxter in THE APARTMENT or William Holden's character in SUNSET BOULEVARD, who begins his narration of the story as a corpse floating in a swimming pool, or, even better, having Ray Milland think he has fallen in love with a 12-year-old girl in THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR).There is also a major problem with casting. As great as Gary Cooper could be, he is just not terribly convincing as a multi-millionaire. The guy was a cowboy before he became an actor (though he had also spent most of his teens living in England), and that Western edge never rubbed off. He was enormously convincing in any part that allowed him to portray a commoner, but hoi polloi was not on his resume.Nonetheless, Lubitsch was still Lubitsch, and while the movie doesn't hang together very well as a whole, there are hordes of magnificent individual moments. The bit about the pajama tops and bottoms is great, and nearly any scene with Edward Everett Horton is great. The scene where Claudette Colbert hires a pugilist to pretend to be her paramour is well done. But none of this covers up the fact that the story as a whole just isn't very pleasant.Anyone seeing this but not having seen much else by Lubitsch should immediately go see one of his better films. His finest, in my opinion, is probably TROUBLE IN PARADISE, but there are many others readily available that are very nearly as good, including NINOTCHKA, HEAVEN CAN WAIT, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, THE MERRY WIDOW, or the extraordinary TO BE OR NOT TO BE.  I will add that a few of his very finest early sound films--THE LOVE PARADE, MONTE CARLO, and the delightful ONE HOUR WITH YOU--are unfortunately not available at this time.",4,"My favorite director, but one of his weaker efforts",1053734400,"05 24, 2003",2003,3528,"['good', 'news/bad', 'news', 'scenario', 'bad', 'news', 'easily', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'ever', 'made', 'good', 'news', 'still', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Lubitsch', 'set', 'standard', 'other', 'comedy', 'directors', 'are', 'be', 'judged', 'produced', 'body', 'film', 'comedies', 'other', 'director', 'can', 'match', 'Nonetheless', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'own', 'extraordinary', 'standards', 'film', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'probably', 'came', 'distant', 'second', 'career', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'had', 'five-year', 'run', 'surpassed', 'five-year', 'run', 'director', 'film', 'history', 'alas', 'burned', 'out', 'too', 'quickly', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'could', 'match', 'Lubitsch', 'best', 'Hawks', 'never', 'focused', 'one', 'genre', 'very', 'long', 'best', 'comedies', 'stand', 'up', 'best', 'work', 'anyone', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'many', 'comedies.The', 'problem', 'film', 'central', 'premise', 'story', 'therefore', 'fault', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'laid', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'story', 'Lubitsch', 'not', 'changing', 'heart', 'film', 'bit', 'sadism', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'marry', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'condition', 'pay', 'set', 'amount', 'money', 'divorce', 'then', 'sleep', 'refusing', 'consummate', 'marriage', 'literally', 'insane', 'Then', 'divorce', 'asylum', 'scene', 'where', 'maniacally', 'feel', 'fine', 'feel', 'very', 'very', 'fine', 'one', 'few', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'Lubitsch', 'film', 'back', 'marry', 'now', 'own', 'money', 'None', 'very', 'convincing', 'personally', 'lay', 'fault', 'Wilder', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'was', 'also', 'capable', 'more', 'little', 'malevolence', 'main', 'characters', 'think', 'tortures', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'C.', 'C.', 'Baxter', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'William', 'Holden', 'character', 'SUNSET', 'BOULEVARD', 'who', 'narration', 'story', 'corpse', 'floating', 'swimming', 'pool', 'even', 'better', 'having', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'think', 'fallen', 'love', '12-year-old', 'girl', 'THE', 'MAJOR', 'THE', 'MINOR', 'also', 'major', 'problem', 'casting', 'As', 'great', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'not', 'terribly', 'convincing', 'multi-millionaire', 'guy', 'was', 'cowboy', 'became', 'actor', 'had', 'also', 'spent', 'most', 'teens', 'living', 'England', 'Western', 'edge', 'never', 'rubbed', 'off', 'was', 'enormously', 'convincing', 'part', 'allowed', 'portray', 'commoner', 'hoi', 'polloi', 'was', 'not', 'resume.Nonetheless', 'Lubitsch', 'was', 'still', 'Lubitsch', 'movie', ""n't"", 'hang', 'together', 'very', 'well', 'whole', 'are', 'hordes', 'magnificent', 'individual', 'moments', 'bit', 'pajama', 'tops', 'bottoms', 'great', 'nearly', 'scene', 'Edward', 'Everett', 'Horton', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'pugilist', 'pretend', 'be', 'paramour', 'well', 'done', 'none', 'up', 'fact', 'story', 'whole', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'pleasant.Anyone', 'seeing', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'much', 'else', 'Lubitsch', 'should', 'immediately', 'go', 'see', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'finest', 'opinion', 'probably', 'TROUBLE', 'IN', 'PARADISE', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'readily', 'available', 'are', 'very', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'including', 'NINOTCHKA', 'HEAVEN', 'CAN', 'WAIT', 'THE', 'SHOP', 'AROUND', 'THE', 'CORNER', 'THE', 'MERRY', 'WIDOW', 'extraordinary', 'TO', 'BE', 'OR', 'NOT', 'TO', 'BE', 'will', 'add', 'few', 'very', 'finest', 'early', 'sound', 'films', 'LOVE', 'PARADE', 'MONTE', 'CARLO', 'delightful', 'ONE', 'HOUR', 'WITH', 'YOU', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'available', 'time']",Bluebeard's Eighth Wife VHS

The famed sophisticated comedy direction Ernst Lubitsch felt he could take Cooper out of his realm and make him into a sophisticated gentleman. Gary may have been one off-screen, but he couldn't give such an illusion on screen A Mr. Deeds, yes, but unfortunately not the hero of this piece. Cooper and Colbert work well together, despite this handicap and Lubitsch sprinkled fun throughout. However, the moviegoing public turned their all-knowing thumbs down at this little lark in 1938 and it lost money. It's not a bad depression-era comedy but it has a dickens of a time trying to pass off Gary as multi-marrying multi-millionaire. Put seven divorced wives behind Mr. Deeds, each with a $50,000 a year settlement, and it becomes pretty hard to believe that he's just a small boy at heart - which was precisely the charm of Paramount's gangling hero..........A slim but funny little comedy has Colbert and Cooper race happily through each unexpected episode. Coop is not altogether at ease in the role of a cosmopolitan banker, but he saves the part from being a caricature, and when the action permits, he cuts loose with splendid comic results.",4,CLAUDETTE & GARY.,1004227200,"10 28, 2001",2001,1324,"['wealthy', 'American', 'who', 'had', 'many', 'ex-wives', 'walks', 'department', 'store', 'Riveria', 'buy', 'pajamas', 'walks', 'out', 'girl', 'make', 'eighth', 'wife', 'famed', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'direction', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'felt', 'could', 'take', 'Cooper', 'realm', 'make', 'sophisticated', 'gentleman', 'Gary', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'off-screen', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'such', 'illusion', 'screen', 'A', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'yes', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'hero', 'piece', 'Cooper', 'Colbert', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'handicap', 'Lubitsch', 'sprinkled', 'fun', 'However', 'moviegoing', 'public', 'turned', 'all-knowing', 'thumbs', 'down', 'little', 'lark', '1938', 'lost', 'money', 'not', 'bad', 'depression-era', 'comedy', 'dickens', 'time', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'Gary', 'multi-marrying', 'multi-millionaire', 'Put', 'seven', 'divorced', 'wives', 'Mr', 'Deeds', '50,000', 'year', 'settlement', 'pretty', 'hard', 'believe', 'just', 'small', 'boy', 'heart', 'was', 'precisely', 'charm', 'Paramount', 'gangling', 'hero', '.A', 'slim', 'funny', 'little', 'comedy', 'Colbert', 'Cooper', 'race', 'happily', 'unexpected', 'episode', 'Coop', 'not', 'altogether', 'ease', 'role', 'cosmopolitan', 'banker', 'part', 'being', 'caricature', 'when', 'action', 'loose', 'splendid', 'comic', 'results']",Bluebeard's Eighth Wife VHS
371094,A16EJ2ZX9QERZ9,6303382932,Shadow Woman,"[8, 9]","Leonard Maltin called this film contrived and weak-- it is no such thing. Me and a few of my friends watched this movie, and though they're not particularly fond of classic film, they nevertheless loved Bluebeard, a sure sign of its greatness. Gary Cooper, in the role of the oft-married man, romances Colbert into becoming his eighth wife. Being a man who never learns from his mistakes, Cooper just keeps on making more and more of 'em. There are lots of laugh-out-loud funny jokes, both verbal and physical, and the movie has a very Parisian feel, or the Lubitsch touch, if you will. I certainly am very fond of this movie, and it's now one of my favourites. Don't listen to that movie critic; give this movie a try- you may just like it! My only complaint would be that we never got to see Gary Cooper without his pyjama bottoms, but that old man with skinny legs paraded around without 'em. Not much of a complaint, but I was hoping we'd at least get a glimpse of Cooper's sexy gams.",5,LEONARD MALTIN IS SOOO WRONG!,973209600,"11 3, 2000",2000,988,"['Leonard', 'Maltin', 'called', 'film', 'contrived', 'weak', 'such', 'thing', 'Me', 'few', 'friends', 'watched', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'particularly', 'fond', 'classic', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'loved', 'Bluebeard', 'sure', 'sign', 'greatness', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'role', 'oft-married', 'man', 'Colbert', 'becoming', 'eighth', 'wife', 'Being', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'mistakes', 'Cooper', 'just', 'making', 'more', 'more', ""'em"", 'are', 'lots', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'jokes', 'verbal', 'physical', 'movie', 'very', 'Parisian', 'feel', 'Lubitsch', 'touch', 'will', 'certainly', 'am', 'very', 'fond', 'movie', 'now', 'one', 'favourites', 'Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'movie', 'critic', 'give', 'movie', 'try-', 'may', 'just', 'like', 'My', 'only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'pyjama', 'bottoms', 'old', 'man', 'skinny', 'legs', 'paraded', 'Not', 'much', 'complaint', 'was', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'least', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Cooper', 'sexy', 'gams']",Bluebeard's Eighth Wife VHS
371095,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6303382932,Simon Davis,"[9, 12]","""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", has gotten a bad press over the years since it's unsuccessful release in 1938 and certainly it is one of the lesser efforts of Director Ernst Lubitsch and of both Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper. There are however things of merit in this film that shouldn't be dismissed . While it might lack a lot of the energy and witty lines that are in abundance in Colbert's classic ""Midnight"", and Lubitsch's magnificent ""Ninotchka"", of the following year the film boasts a superlative cast, glamourous settings, sophisticated goings on and a smart snappy pace that keeps the action moving. No classic, it is still good cinema art of the Golden Era of Hollywood.Based loosely on an old Gloria Swanson vechicle of the same name from the 1920's, the story scripted by Billy Wilder has been necessarily  updated to the closing period of the depression era and tells the story of well heeled individuals, or those wishing to be well heeled playing out marital games in a glamourous setting so popular with a viewing audience slowly recovering from the viscitudes of the stark depression years of the early 30's. Central to the story is wealthy American playboy Michael Brandon visiting the Riviera who becomes instantly besotted with the young and attractive Nicole de Loiselle (Claudette Colbert) in a department store where an argument develops over Michael's desire to purchase only the tops of a pair of Pajamas. After agreeing to buy the bottoms for her father Nicole, who is a refined Gold Digger out for a solution to her's and her father's (the eternally perplexed  Edward Everett Horton in another great performance), money troubles finds herself with an ardent suitor in the wealthy American who initially hides the fact from her that he has been married seven times before! After this startling piece of information is revealed to her at the engagement party photographic session Nicole decides to play the same game herself and promises to marry Michael only if considering his track record, he will give her a large sum of money in the divorce settlement. After the marriage takes place Nicole attempts by living a seperate life and refusing the playboy's romantic advances (in one very funny scene by chewing on some onion sticks over his shoulder just before he kisses her!)to prod him into a divorce which he finally agrees to after a mental breakdown. By this time Nicole has her own money and begins to see that Michael is actuallly the man for her and attempts to win him back through staging scenes to provoke his jealousy till the romantic conclusion when all is settled.Romantic sophisticated comedy it certainly is with just an edge of malice thrown in, and it makes for some funny hijinks by the cast and an entertaining although not top grade romp that will keep you amused. Much talk has been spent on the correctness of the casting with good reason. Claudette Colbert is her usual  best in this type of a role, even in the scenes where her character is playing around with Michael's mind. She had that way of making marital comedy seem so effortless and her own glamourous Parisian appearance and manner suited her perfectly for roles set in the world of the rich and priveledged. Gary Cooper is the bone of contention for most viewers of this film and certainly he does not look comfortable in the role of the Millionaire playboy who just can't help himself in  marrying too many times. The role definately called for an actor who has a more sophisticated screen persona like Cary Grant. Cooper tries hard and his work with Claudette is the best part of the film but I always think of the better choices that were available at this time to do this role. The supporting cast as in all Lubitsch productions is first rate starting with the befuddled Edward Everett Horton as the roguish and financially strapped  Marquis de Loiselle, Nicole's father who is desperate to get Nicole and Michael married so he can enjoy the rich bounty that would flow from such a marriage. His scenes of trying to pass off a questionable ""antique"" bath tub supposedly belonging to Louis Fourteenth to Micheal is most amusing and Horton's famed double takes are much in evidence here in this story. A young David Niven in one of his earliest roles plays Albert De Regniera, a friend of Nicole's who is equally short of money and is mistaken by Michael as an unwelcome suitor in one of the climatic scenes towards the end of the film where he scores a punch to the jaw from Nicole to raise Michael's jealousy of her other ""suitors"".""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", is a pleasant way to pass an hour and a half dallying with the problems of beautiful, wealthy people and those who wish to be that way by hook or by crook. A lesser effort by Lubitsch certainly but lesser for him is still enjoyable. Despite the miscasting of Gary Cooper in the urbane type of role that was not really his speciality, any film with Claudette Colbert is worth a look and her comedy playing in ""Bluebeard"", tends to mask some of the lack of confidence in Cooper's playing. For a journey back to 1930's sophistication and marital goings on, ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", is an enjoyable minor comedy to have a laugh with.",3,Claudette Colbert shines in lesser Ernst Lubitsch
