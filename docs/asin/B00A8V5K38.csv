Now that I am grown up with two little girls of my own, I was excited to see that my favorite character was still around. She has had a little bit of a makeover since the 80's, but all in all, she is still the same Strawberry Shortcake that I know and love. And now there are more than just toys to enjoy. Strawberry Shortcake has her own line of movies, and the newest in the DVD collection is Berry Friends Forever.This film is all about the girls getting ready to go to a formal event.  There is lots of fun some terrific songs, but it also deals with common issues like learning about manners, so there is a lesson to be learned. But they are learn that there is a fine line between manners and just being plan annoying. Once they come to a happy medium, the girls relieve the most important thing of all is friendship  Both my girls, who range in age from 3 to 12, loved sitting down to watch this film together.

This updated version doesn't have as much fantasy background detail and it seems like they sing too much and really squeaky voices. Can only take a little at a time.
