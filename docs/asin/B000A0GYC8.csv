We had no Internet, or cable! What was better than all of that? A Saturday of the Family Film Festival and Pippi! What a treat to finally be able to own this DVD! I disagree with the dubbing of the voices. I have watched it dubbed and still, I love it! Furthermore, it is not scary, it is unique, and as an adult who watch all foreign movies with subtitles this hits home to the heart, it makes it all that much more special. What was different and a bit scary was actually hearing Pippi, Tommy, and Annika real voices! True to form the antics of Pippi has proven to be a lasting one and I encourage anyone who has children to watch Pippi and her Friends with their family. My 14-year-old daughter loves Pippi and what gratification to be able to experience the joy that you are so found of remembering with your own child?
