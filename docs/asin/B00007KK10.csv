730130,A1F7YU6O5RU432,B00007KK10,Angela Streiff,"[0, 0]","Years ago in Romania, in an effort to increase the countries population, all forms of abortion and birth control were outlawed. This resulted in the births of tens of thousands of children that were unwanted by their parents. The number of abandoned children grew so fast, that shelters and orphanages overflowed and the children started living on the streets. Some kids decided to leave their families on their own, due to extremely harsh living conditions. Parents were sending their children out to beg on the streets, and the children decided they would rather keep the money for themselves that they spent their days begging for. Due to extreme hunger, they've turned to huffing paint from plastic bags, which takes away the hunger pains. Little kids gather in gangs for company, living together in the subways and hauling bottles for shopkeepers to try and earn money for food. This film shows just how many kids are along and abandoned, how many adults go on living their lives as though they don't even exist and when you meet their families (the ones that aren't orphans), you understand why they chose to live on the streets rather than at home. While a 10 year old smoking a cigarette might seem like he's tough and can handle the life, delving deeper, you find they are still just terrified and lonely children, who cry often and seem to shut down at the mention of going to live somewhere else. It's an amazing film, that goes back again a year after originally being filmed, to see what became of the children.

730131,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,B00007KK10,Blue Leaf,"[4, 5]","SPOILERS! Did the filming of this movie actually help any of the children profiled in the film? It seems as if the film was made primarily for its sensational topic but in the end the children, on a whole, did not benefit from the movie. If they did end up in a better place a year later it had nothing to do with the director's help. I also found it outragious that a film crew would allow a ten year old girl to be severly beaten for the sake of the message of the film. The girl could have been permanently damaged or even killed but the camera kept rolling. At that point in the film I felt that achieving realism in the film was not worth having young children get hurt. It is now over ten years later and the director seems to have gone on to other topics. I was waiting at the end of the film for the producers of the film to suggest how the audience could help these children and there was nothing. I was disappointed that so little was done to help these children and the thousands of others that were not shown. Yes, the film enlightened the viewer to the problem in Romania but, unlike other similar films, did nothing to suggest to the audience what we could do. Some may say that enlightening the world to this problem was enough but I disagree. I gave the film one star for this reason only. It should be watched as any film that can enlighten the movie viewer to important topics they may not know about but I felt the director was more interested in winning awards than solving problems.",1,Sensational film about a horrific problem,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,1503,"['SPOILERS', 'Did', 'filming', 'movie', 'actually', 'children', 'profiled', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'primarily', 'sensational', 'topic', 'end', 'children', 'whole', 'did', 'not', 'benefit', 'movie', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'better', 'place', 'year', 'later', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'director', 'help', 'also', 'found', 'outragious', 'film', 'crew', 'would', 'allow', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'be', 'severly', 'beaten', 'sake', 'message', 'film', 'girl', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'permanently', 'damaged', 'even', 'killed', 'camera', 'kept', 'rolling', 'point', 'film', 'felt', 'achieving', 'realism', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'having', 'young', 'children', 'get', 'hurt', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'director', 'have', 'gone', 'other', 'topics', 'was', 'waiting', 'end', 'film', 'producers', 'film', 'suggest', 'how', 'audience', 'could', 'help', 'children', 'was', 'nothing', 'was', 'disappointed', 'so', 'little', 'was', 'done', 'help', 'children', 'thousands', 'others', 'were', 'not', 'shown', 'Yes', 'film', 'enlightened', 'viewer', 'problem', 'Romania', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'did', 'nothing', 'suggest', 'audience', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'may', 'say', 'enlightening', 'world', 'problem', 'was', 'enough', 'disagree', 'gave', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'reason', 'only', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'film', 'can', 'enlighten', 'movie', 'viewer', 'important', 'topics', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'felt', 'director', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'winning', 'awards', 'solving', 'problems']",N/A

The filming is intriguing and insightful, getting the viewer into the lives of the children living on the streets of Bucharest (or rather under it in a subway station). It's really disturbing, too, to see commuters in stiletto heals walk unconcernedly by these children laying on makeshift cardboard beds.Following the lives of 5 of these kids was terrible, hopeful and tearful, all at the same time. Coming from an American perspective (i.e., me), I had a hard time understanding why these children didn't have access to more resources, including ways to find a home. But, again, coming from an American background (where we have more resources than most other countries) I guess I shouldn't have been that surprised.The serious flaw in the documentary (as another reviewer pointed out) is that there's no film time relegated to the former dictator Couseau's anti-contraceptive and anti-abortion laws that caused some of these problems (most of them, probably). I felt that the film makers should've gone to the higher ups in government and interviewed them for the documentary, allowing the viewer a chance to see where these laws were made and then (in the subway) their effects. Not doing this led to a serious imbalance in the character of what this documentary was supposed to be about.I felt that this was more a documentary on runaways and homeless children in Bucharest than on any policies that caused these horrible situations.",3,Unbalanced Yet Intriguing,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,1501,"['documentary', 'lot', 'going', 'one', 'serious', 'flaw', 'filming', 'intriguing', 'insightful', 'getting', 'viewer', 'lives', 'children', 'living', 'streets', 'Bucharest', 'rather', 'subway', 'station', 'really', 'disturbing', 'too', 'see', 'commuters', 'stiletto', 'heals', 'walk', 'unconcernedly', 'children', 'laying', 'makeshift', 'cardboard', 'beds.Following', 'lives', '5', 'kids', 'was', 'terrible', 'hopeful', 'tearful', 'same', 'time', 'Coming', 'American', 'perspective', 'i.e.', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'why', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'access', 'more', 'resources', 'including', 'ways', 'find', 'home', 'again', 'coming', 'American', 'background', 'where', 'have', 'more', 'resources', 'most', 'other', 'countries', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surprised.The', 'serious', 'flaw', 'documentary', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'time', 'relegated', 'former', 'dictator', 'Couseau', 'anti-contraceptive', 'anti-abortion', 'laws', 'caused', 'problems', 'most', 'probably', 'felt', 'film', 'makers', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'higher', 'ups', 'government', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'chance', 'see', 'where', 'laws', 'were', 'made', 'then', 'subway', 'effects', 'Not', 'doing', 'led', 'serious', 'imbalance', 'character', 'what', 'documentary', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'about.I', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'documentary', 'runaways', 'homeless', 'children', 'Bucharest', 'policies', 'caused', 'horrible', 'situations']",N/A

Some ran away from abusive parents while others grew up in orphanages.

But their well intentioned efforts are overwhelmed by a poor society scant on resources and mean spirited, selfish parents who seem to prefer their children living on the streets - one less mouth to feed after all.Of course, street kids are a world wide issue, especially in Third World countries with underdeveloped social welfare systems. But the problem seems especially bad in Romania, where the anti-birth control policy of former dictator Ceaucescu has created a generation of unwanted chidren.

I could not recall it, and it looked interesting so I purchased a copy.I really could not fault the film or the filmmakers' choices in any respect. This is a highly awarded film, and rightly so, for several reasons, although I don't know whether a repeat viewing is possible as it is very sad, and some of the footage especially the violence inflicted on the children is literally gut-wrenching and devastating.It is a great commendation of the film that it does not use artifice or musical backdrops to create a 'work of art'. The footage including interviews but also just watching the children interact on the street, including scenes of drug use and solvent sniffing, which obviously ain't pretty, doesn't shy away from the awfulness of their situation and therefore doesn't let the audience off the hook.What is happening to the children in this film could equally apply to homeless underage children in any city around the world, including 'advanced' societies and very wealthy nations.These children are 'not wanted', they are abandoned, they are let down by almost everyone, they are physically and psychologically abused, they are addicted to sniffing, they fear everything and everyone thus reacting with the only weapon left to them in the jungle - violence.This is an outstanding film, obviously, in every respect. I highly recommend it. It is apart from anything else a very harsh slap in the face for those of us who think we care about our community while such tragedies continue to be perpetuated around us (out of sight, out of mind).The bright spot in the film is that all is not lost and that the support structures that do exist in a very poor country do the best they can.This film left me outraged that children can still so easily fall through the cracks, in any society, and end up on the streets to fend for themselves. That may sound very naive, but I think it is natural to feel very aggrieved when witnessing even a film about children in real pain and danger.

Watching children as young as 8 living alone on the streets of Romania - existing by begging, and huffing paint to alleviate the torture of their lives- is the saddest thing I think I've ever witnessed on film.  I look at my children who were still coddled like the babies they were at age 8, 9 and 10 and I am amazed that these children can even survive in the conditions they are left in.  The worst tragedy is that without very serious intervention, the children will soon become adults living lives of cruelty and addiction on the same streets and probably having children of their own who will face a life of few possibilities other than following in their parents' footsteps.  It is not only in Romania that this is happening.  It's also happening right here in America - children growing up with little to no parental support or in homes where addiction and crime are the controlling factors.  The followup at the end of the film gives updates for the five children featured and none of them has entirely escaped their situation although two have moved into group homes for street kids and so are at least off the streets.  I'm not going to pretend to know the answer for what it would take to prevent such atrocities.  Perhaps just by watching films like this and becoming more aware, we can all do something, even something very small, to help and that will eventually make a difference.  At least, I hope that we can.  As for recommending this film, I do highly recommend it.  Is it disturbing and gut wrenching?  Yes but sometimes you have to face the ugly truth in order to know what needs to be changed.  I would not, however, recommend it for children under 12 and only with adult supervision for young teens.

730136,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00007KK10,Joe Sherry,"[16, 43]","A film by Edet Belzberg""Children Undergound"" was nominated for the Best Documentary Academy Award, and the subject of the film sounded fascinating.  The former dictator of Romania, Nicolei Ceaucescu, outlawed the use of contraceptives and abortions in order to increase Romania's workforce.  This led to 20,000 children on the street as countless families were unable to cope, and afford the unplanned children.  That is the premise of the film, as presented by the text that is on screen before the documentary actually begins, and it sounds like this will be a very interesting documentary.  Unfortunately, that's not the movie we see.The movie we get follows five Romanian kids (with ages ranging from 8 through the teenage years) as they live on the streets.  We follow their lives, seeing where the sleep, how they get by, what they eat, where they go, and what they do.  We watch them exist in a street gang which gives them a sense of family, and a sense of security and protection.  We watch as nearly every kid huffs paint to get high, and we see some struggle to improve themselves and get off the street, despite the feeling that they are better off on the street than they are at home.One could make the case that these kids living on the street is a direct result of Ceaucescu's policy regarding contraceptives and abortion and that these kids are representative of the 20,000 street children, and perhaps that is true.  The problem is that the documentary does not try to make that case.  The only connection with Ceaucescu's policy is the text that preceded the film telling us that 20,000 kids are on the street because of the contraceptive policy.  The film itself presents us with a different reality.  With one exception, these kids are not orphans, they are runaways.  One kid in particular had horrible parents, but that does not make him a victim of Ceaucescu's policy.  It just means that he felt that running away from home and living on the streets of Bucharest was a better alternative to living at home.That is the major flaw of the movie.  The basic theme presented had little to do with the documentary itself.  The only time there is any connection to the presented theme was very, very late in the movie when one of the parents says that she ""was better off under Ceaucescu"".  That's it.  That is the entire connection to the contraception policy.With that said, this is a powerful look into the lives of Bucharest's street children.  They live very rough lives and the addiction to huffing paint and drugs makes it even more difficult for them to ever really get off the street.  If this was the theme of the film and this is what was presented up front, perhaps the film would have been stronger.  Unfortunately we are presented with one idea for the documentary and given another in the film itself.""Children Underground"" had the potential to be an excellent documentary.  Besides the above stated complaint about the presentation of the topic, there is an issue with the structure of the film.  Meaning, there is none.  The documentary goes from subject to subject and place to place without any sort of purpose, or at least none that I could figure out.  I know this is a foreign film, and perhaps the filmmaker had a different idea of what a documentary could and should be, but it was almost completely devoid of narration and just a little bit of narration could have given the film some structure.

I saw these things for myself in Romania during December of 2000. The apathy on the streets of Bucharest was deep and dark. My friends there kept shrugging their shoulders saying; ""What can you do?"" A documentary on the thousands of dogs on the streets would be a riveting nightmare in itself. While I was there they held an election. The choice of presidential candidates was reduced to a hard-line old school communist and a new school fascist. The Communist won. People shrugged. The train stations and subway entrances were indeed hives for feral children. I'm deeply grateful to Edet Belzberg for having the courage to descend into this manmade hell to bring these images back. It is my hope that the Romanians themselves find some of that same courage. I was moved that even at this stage of hell several of the kids held on to at least some idea of God. That could be seen by the cynically ironic of the West as the superstition of the hopeless, but perhaps it is also evidence that these children are not hopeless. To blame these problems on the lack of abortions or contraceptives is nave and simplistic. Listen to the voices of the parents in this film. It is the apathy, the failure of courage and the utter selfishness reinforced by too many years of soul crushing communist dictatorship. We, ourselves, have no reason to gloat. Apart from having a surfeit of material possessions would we fare any better if the props were kicked from beneath us? Perhaps, perhaps not. This film, along with Lilja 4-Ever, is a warning sign of something growing in this world. Robert L. Kaplan termed it The Coming Anarchy. It will spread.

730141,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00007KK10,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Children Underground is painful to watch; but it is rather important. Director Edet Belzberg raises our awareness that there are too many impoverished children in Romania because dictator Nicolei Ceaucescu decreed that contraception would be illegal. That way, the working class would increase along with the rise of Communism in Romania. (Of course, this problem exists globally but the film focuses on the issue in Romania.) These young children can't always live in orphanages because of brutal conditions and parents can't always keep their children as the parents are too poor or the parents have routinely beaten their children--which all of the parents deny in this film. Children thus live feral lives in the subway stations of cities like Bucharest in Romania. While the first half or so of the film drags a bit and could have been more tightly edited, the second half of the film shows how social workers take a young child home so they can at least try to get his identity papers and give him a chance at a bright future. (Sadly, things don't always work out well despite the best efforts of nuns and social workers.) The cinematography is well done and the absence of a musical score helps in this case; there are few if any distractions from the ""slice of life"" we get about the everyday activities of these children. They beg, work a little for shopkeepers who have kiosks in the subway stations and they try to protect each other. Unfortunately, they get high quite often, too. As the film progresses, I began to care a great deal about the five children the film focuses on: Cristina; Mihai; Violeta ""Macarena;"" Ana and her brother Marian.I don't want to give away too much more for fear of spoiling it for you; but there is one thing I must add because it really had a strong impact on me. While the filmmakers did a great job of documenting the everyday life of these unfortunate children who deserve so much more, I was infuriated that nobody stopped to help when one child, Ana, gets beaten up by other kids; she literally gets kicked in the head and no one from the film crew did anything about it. Apparently the people who are everyday passers-by don't care about these children very much, but I was appalled that the film crew simply let that happen. Indeed, there is more violence in this film; and it is only when one child starts cutting himself rather badly that we see any adult try to stop violent behavior. I admire this documentary; but I have mixed feelings about Edet Belzberg and the film crew.The DVD comes with a few extras. I particularly liked the follow-up feature; we find out what happened to these children roughly eighteen months after the film was finished.Children Underground is a tough film to take but it's extremely important that people all over the world know the terrible plight of these children all because some senseless, cruel dictator decreed that contraception was outlawed in Romania. I highly recommend this film for people who strive to improve the lives of children everywhere; and people studying this particular problem in Romania would do well to get this film on DVD.

But it also speaks volumes about the realities of parents forced (by the Romanian government, in this case) to have unwanted children. The film can be divided into three acts. The first unflinchingly examines the children's daily lives in a subway station, begging for food, money, and water, and sniffing paint. The only upbeat aspect is the occasional joy that the children find in ordinary, childlike play-wading in a pond or playing tag. The second part reveals the dysfunctional families from which the children have either run away or been sent away. In one case, we learn that one of the boys is escaping an abusive father. He misses his sister but is too afraid of his father to even go near the house when a social worker tries to take him there. In another family, the mother has obviously shunned her son and daughter at the behest of her new husband. For me, the most heartbreaking scenes occurs here: A charity worker takes them home to see if the parents will take the children back, but the mother and step-father rationalize the kids' life on the streets; they can make more money there, they say. Then even this facade crumbles as it becomes obvious that the parents simply don't want the kids in their lives. The third part revisits the group after a gap of one year. We see that many of the younger kids have been taken up by charity organizations (which see them as having the best chance for rehabilitation), whereas the ending is not so happy for the older kids. This is a deeply saddening film but a must-see look at the misery created by a heartless government and irresponsible, thoughtless parents.

Is this yet another attempt by the Liberal Brainwashing Agenda?!It seems that if abortion had not been prevented during this certain time period then these children would not be on the street. Guess what!? It's not that simple.Why is there no mention of the true reasons for these tragic street children?Alcohol and the subsequent abuse of it is largely at the root of this problem. The children state that their parents get drunk and become abusive. That is the reason, maybe excuse, for many of these children running away from their homes.Why does the film not begin with a statement about the evils of alcohol?!Why are these children allowed to run the street like this?Is there any mention of the fact that Godless Communism ran this country for decades and set the foundation for what transpires today?Here the film ignores another fact for the benefit of the Lib Agenda. Churches and Christian Religion attempt to care for widows and orphans in this world. Christianity, in its truest and best form, has infused societies and cultures with ideas of compassion, mercy, and love. These same values inspire many liberals, even though the Lib Agenda is trying to eradicate Christianity, paradoxically supporting Islam!. Get real.This film would have done better in sending it's message by having a Christian perspective. These heathen leftist communists are too shallow and misled.This film is not for the squeamish or person who doesn't want to be disturbed. It's violent and horrifying.Good people should not turn their backs to difficult and unjust realities as portrayed here. However, it is a deeply complex and difficult problem to be dealt with.Part of the ""solution"" if there be such, is to be honest and wise about the true causes of street children as well as adults.Truly, contraception and intelligence applied to the sex act is foremost. There is a sickness in a man or woman that demands intercourse with the subsequent risk of pregnancy when there is no desire for children and no wherewithal to afford it.Abortion is a last-ditch effort and it is still NOT ACCEPTABLE OR DESIREABLE!The idea of abortion as promoted by the Lib Agenda and Democrat Party in the US is perverted and evil.Abortion should be safely available to females who have a true need for it and the parents of the aborted baby should be held responsible on at least a legal level for causing a baby to be killed. Abortion is not a nifty way out of a lifestyle promoted by the Lib Agenda: sexual promiscuity and destruction of the traditional family unit.",3,Tragic Street Children,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,2682,"['film', 'be', 'promoting', 'abortion', 'contraception', 'cures', 'pain', 'suffering', 'prevention', 'street', 'children', 'adults', 'yet', 'attempt', 'Liberal', 'Brainwashing', 'Agenda', 'abortion', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'prevented', 'certain', 'time', 'period', 'then', 'children', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'street', 'Guess', 'what', 'not', 'simple.Why', 'there', 'mention', 'true', 'reasons', 'tragic', 'street', 'children', 'Alcohol', 'subsequent', 'abuse', 'largely', 'root', 'problem', 'children', 'state', 'parents', 'get', 'drunk', 'become', 'abusive', 'reason', 'maybe', 'excuse', 'many', 'children', 'running', 'away', 'homes.Why', 'film', 'not', 'begin', 'statement', 'evils', 'alcohol', 'Why', 'are', 'children', 'allowed', 'run', 'street', 'there', 'mention', 'fact', 'Godless', 'Communism', 'ran', 'country', 'decades', 'set', 'foundation', 'what', 'today', 'Here', 'film', 'fact', 'benefit', 'Lib', 'Agenda', 'Churches', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'attempt', 'care', 'widows', 'orphans', 'world', 'Christianity', 'truest', 'best', 'form', 'infused', 'societies', 'cultures', 'ideas', 'compassion', 'mercy', 'love', 'same', 'values', 'inspire', 'many', 'liberals', 'even', 'Lib', 'Agenda', 'trying', 'eradicate', 'Christianity', 'paradoxically', 'supporting', 'Islam', 'Get', 'real.This', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'sending', 'message', 'having', 'Christian', 'perspective', 'heathen', 'leftist', 'communists', 'are', 'too', 'shallow', 'misled.This', 'film', 'not', 'squeamish', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'disturbed', 'violent', 'horrifying.Good', 'people', 'should', 'not', 'turn', 'backs', 'difficult', 'unjust', 'realities', 'portrayed', 'here', 'However', 'deeply', 'complex', 'difficult', 'problem', 'be', 'dealt', 'with.Part', 'solution', 'be', 'such', 'be', 'honest', 'wise', 'true', 'causes', 'street', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'adults.Truly', 'contraception', 'intelligence', 'applied', 'sex', 'act', 'foremost', 'sickness', 'man', 'woman', 'intercourse', 'subsequent', 'risk', 'pregnancy', 'when', 'desire', 'children', 'wherewithal', 'afford', 'it.Abortion', 'last-ditch', 'effort', 'still', 'NOT', 'ACCEPTABLE', 'OR', 'DESIREABLE', 'idea', 'abortion', 'promoted', 'Lib', 'Agenda', 'Democrat', 'Party', 'US', 'perverted', 'evil.Abortion', 'should', 'be', 'safely', 'available', 'females', 'who', 'have', 'true', 'need', 'parents', 'aborted', 'baby', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'responsible', 'least', 'legal', 'level', 'causing', 'baby', 'be', 'killed', 'Abortion', 'not', 'nifty', 'way', 'lifestyle', 'promoted', 'Lib', 'Agenda', 'sexual', 'promiscuity', 'destruction', 'traditional', 'family', 'unit']",N/A

These unwanted children exist as a result of Ceaucescu&#65533;s strict policy of outlaying abortions and birth control. Most grew up in orphanages while others lived with their families in dire poverty. They believe that their lives are better underground. This documentary films the daily exploits of these children along with the struggles they encounter to rehabilitate themselves. In order to attend school they must come clean and stop sniffing paint. In addition, they must have their identity papers, which are almost impossible for most of them. The most enduring parts of this film center on the interviews of the various family members of these children. Truly heartbreaking is the family of the small boy who doesn&#65533;t understand why their youngest child won&#65533;t return home.
