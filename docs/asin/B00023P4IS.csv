And I have to say I was really surprised on how good it was. DMX was not a bad actor for his first big role in a movie. I will say the story is good but confusing and you need to follow it closely to understand what is going on. The one complaint that I do have about this movie is I feel it should have been given more time than it was. This is a depressing story if you look at it as a whole. It is sad to think that heavy drugs like that can get you in such a bad place in your life that you could end up killing yourself or driving your life straight into the ground. It had action when it wasn't flashing back to DMX life and a lot of shooting scenes which were cool. A depressing, Exciting and good story told and I will go with 4 out of 5 stars and a strong recommendation to pick this DVD up.",4,DMX Never Die Alone Is a 4 Star DVD,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,890,"['Well', 'Saw', 'Movie', 'ON', 'Sale', 'used', 'DVD', 'Store', '7.99', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'DMX', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'first', 'big', 'role', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'story', 'good', 'confusing', 'need', 'follow', 'closely', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'one', 'complaint', 'do', 'have', 'movie', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'depressing', 'story', 'look', 'whole', 'sad', 'think', 'heavy', 'drugs', 'can', 'get', 'bad', 'place', 'life', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'driving', 'life', 'straight', 'ground', 'had', 'action', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'flashing', 'back', 'DMX', 'life', 'lot', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'were', 'cool', 'depressing', 'Exciting', 'good', 'story', 'told', 'will', 'go', '4', '5', 'stars', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'pick', 'DVD', 'up']",N/A

Everybody involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. No offense X!  Ernest R. Dickerson, the man who brought us Juice, really shot a blank with this.

DMX isn't exactly showing his range in playing yet another angry sadist who tries to find redemption (ala Belly) but at the very least, he's dynamic enough to keep us from being bored.

Having heard not much about it I was expecting another 'In Da Hood' film. I didn't have much confidence in Ernest Dickerson (Surviving the Game, Demon Knight) as his direction hasn't matured in the past decade. I eat my words now. He definitely brings a strong visual integrity to Never Die Alone.DMX turns in a believable performance as King David a New York drug dealer who legs it to LA when he steals his bosses stash. Upon his return years later he is promptly offed by a two-bit thug. In his dying moments he bequeaths his entire legacy to investigative reporter David Arquette (who is great in his role too). Before the night is over Arquette pieces together his life and an awful past full of heinous crimes is unleashed, but it's not over yet and Arquette becomes marked for death by King David's still very angry boss.In a mere 88 minutes Never Die Alone tells an intriguing story in non-chronological order and sets up a remarkable array of complexly interwoven characters. It's surely a character drama first before anything else. Don't misjudge it as being no more than a violent 'gangsta' thriller. The violence is brutal and honest but it does not distract, none of it is superfluous.Dickerson's direction has a gothic, urban noir edge to it that has the feel of a 1950's pulp novel. It's dark, very dark and some may feel slightly uncomfortable with how frank Never Die Alone is in it's depiction of misogyny and the utter ruthlessness of it's central, highly evil character.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are a bunch of extras I never had time to check out. But this is definitely a movie for fans of (the initially unrecognisable) DMX, just don't expect one of those nice but bad characters he played in Exit Wounds or Cradle 2 the Grave.

823495,AIQY8EIW9W25X,B00023P4IS,"""lilking101""","[1, 3]","""Never Die Alone"" is the graphic story based on the excellant novel by Donald Goines.  The story is really three stories.  The story that everyone can see in the trailers is the story of King David, a drug dealer who uses women for sex and sales by hooking them on cocaine and eventually heroin(if they threaten to leave him.  But when David wants to change and returns to his hometown he is murdered.  That brings us to the second story, David's murderer, Mike(Michael Ealy/Ricki from Barbershop).  As the story progresses Mike fights for survival after he kills David, leaving him to be driven to the hospital by an asspiring white write.  That's the third story.  Paul(David Arquette) is an aspiring journalist who purposely lives in the projects for ""material"".  He witnesses David's murder and drives him to the hospital, having a quick discussion that makes the audience see David as a larger than life gangster because of Paul's then small role.  King David dies and leaves Paul his pimp car and cassette diaries.  I like how they all are the same story from three different angles.  Mike kills David and Paul listens to the diaries, enabling us to see the sickening person King David was.The acting was great.  Michael Ealy is a convincing Mike, a down and out croney for Moon(an also convincing Clifton Powell), a pimp that David owes money to.  I don't like David Arquette films but he really pulled off a dramatic role as he did in The Grey Zone.  Rapper DMX is great in this film and in my opinion this is his best movie yet(also see Belly).The film was graphically true to the novel and to society.  I just don't see how people could insult this film.  True, it's not the greatest film of all time, but it was probably the most truthful film in awhile.  The scenes are beautifully directed, making simple discussions and murders into cinematic moments.  The women in this film are shown as the victims.  David takes advantage of three women with dreams of success(actress, journalist, etc), and turns them into druggies thatre traded drugs for sex.In the end, I believe ""Never Die Alone"" is a classic urban crime film but it is also a great film period.Was this review helpful to you?",5,Epic Story With A Message,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,2197,"['Never', 'Die', 'Alone', 'graphic', 'story', 'based', 'excellant', 'novel', 'Donald', 'Goines', 'story', 'really', 'three', 'stories', 'story', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'trailers', 'story', 'King', 'David', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'women', 'sex', 'sales', 'hooking', 'cocaine', 'eventually', 'heroin', 'threaten', 'leave', 'when', 'David', 'change', 'returns', 'hometown', 'murdered', 'second', 'story', 'David', 'murderer', 'Mike', 'Michael', 'Ealy/Ricki', 'Barbershop', 'story', 'Mike', 'fights', 'survival', 'David', 'leaving', 'be', 'driven', 'hospital', 'asspiring', 'white', 'write', 'third', 'story', 'Paul', 'David', 'Arquette', 'aspiring', 'journalist', 'who', 'purposely', 'projects', 'material', 'David', 'murder', 'hospital', 'having', 'quick', 'discussion', 'audience', 'see', 'David', 'larger', 'life', 'gangster', 'Paul', 'then', 'small', 'role', 'King', 'David', 'dies', 'Paul', 'pimp', 'car', 'cassette', 'diaries', 'like', 'how', 'are', 'same', 'story', 'three', 'different', 'angles', 'Mike', 'David', 'Paul', 'diaries', 'enabling', 'see', 'sickening', 'person', 'King', 'David', 'was.The', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'convincing', 'Mike', 'down', 'croney', 'Moon', 'also', 'convincing', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'pimp', 'David', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'David', 'Arquette', 'films', 'really', 'pulled', 'off', 'dramatic', 'role', 'did', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'Rapper', 'DMX', 'great', 'film', 'opinion', 'best', 'movie', 'yet', 'also', 'see', 'Belly', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'graphically', 'true', 'novel', 'society', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'people', 'could', 'insult', 'film', 'True', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'truthful', 'film', 'awhile', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'making', 'simple', 'discussions', 'murders', 'cinematic', 'moments', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'shown', 'victims', 'David', 'advantage', 'three', 'women', 'dreams', 'success', 'actress', 'journalist', 'etc', 'druggies', 'thatre', 'traded', 'drugs', 'sex.In', 'end', 'believe', 'Never', 'Die', 'Alone', 'classic', 'urban', 'crime', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'period.Was', 'review', 'helpful']",N/A

823497,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00023P4IS,Michael Crane,"[13, 14]","&quot;Never Die Alone&quot; is a dark and bleak crime drama/noir that never makes any apologies for its brutality or harshness.  Definitely not something for people with weak stomachs, the movie is a great example of showing you what goes around comes around, even if you decide it's time to change your life.  As harsh as the movie can be, I think it was very well done and took some really good risks.  This is definitely something that doesn't come out of typical Hollywood.DMX plays King David, a notorious drug dealer who has a solid rep and one hell of a dark past.  He decides it's time to make things right and hopefully find some sort of redemption.  Well, things don't work out like that as his past mistakes finally catch up to him with unrelenting results.  A would-be reporter gets caught in the middle of the crossfire and ends up learning about David's horrible past through his own cassette tapes that he had made.  What is revealed to him is a grim story about drugs and violence in unspeakable proportions.I was actually expecting the movie to be nothing but non-stop &quot;street violence,&quot; but it ended up being a lot more clever than that.  There's an actual storyline to it that works, along with some great performances from the cast.  Even though this isn't a perfect movie, I think it is a very good one.  DMX is absolutely chilling and unforgiving in his role of &quot;King David.&quot;  So unforgiving that he even admits in a making-of featurette on the DVD that he had a hard time with some of the things his character does in the film.  You can tell that he was determined to become the character, as he does a great job of selling it.  David Arquette and Michael Ealy also give terrific performances and should not be forgotten.The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer, but there are some extras included.  You have the option of either watching the widescreen or fullscreen version of the movie.  Extras included are commentary, a making-of-featurette, trailers and deleted scenes.  While it doesn't offer a whole ton of extras, there are a couple that you can check out.It goes without saying that the movie is dark and brutal.  If you're looking for a happy-go-lucky type of movie, then this is something you will not want to even take a chance on.  As harsh as this movie can be, I don't think it's gratuitous, which was something I was expecting it to be.  Still, this is something that isn't for everybody.

823499,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00023P4IS,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","Since truth is indeed sometimes stranger than fiction, often the movie with the most unlikely scenario is the one that turns out to be the most believable.  This is the case with ""Never Die Alone,"" an urban crime drama with a plot just loopy enough to keep us interested and just goofy enough to make us believe it.David Arquette plays a white reporter who hangs around in a predominantly black section of the city soaking up the ""atmosphere"" for articles and books he hopes to write.  One night, he attempts to save the life of a black drug kingpin (played by DMX) by driving the man to the hospital after he's been left for dead in a revenge killing.  Immediately before his death, the man, who goes by the name ""King David,"" bequeaths his car and other earthly possessions to this inner city Good Samaritan.  Included in the haul is an assortment of tapes David recorded detailing his experiences as a successful drug pusher in LA.  Thus, as Paul listens to these recordings, a full picture of the kind of man David was soon emerges.The best thing about ""Never Die Alone"" is that it doesn't flinch from displaying the ugly, harsh realities of its blood-splattered world.  It shows how even the innocent and the good eventually fall victim to the evils of drug addiction and crime.  The film is not afraid to kill off characters in a random way, often surprising us with just who ends up dying and who ends up surviving.  And it does not attempt to sugarcoat ""King David,"" for despite all his comments about redemption and making up for the evil he's done,  David is one hell of an amoral bastard who does some pretty horrible things to some truly undeserving people - and the film does not shy away from depicting that reality.Although, on the surface, the film seems like just another in a long line of sordid crime dramas involving crack heads, dope fiends and armed-to-the-teeth ghetto gangstas, ""Never Die Alone,"" perhaps because it is willing to hold nothing back in what it chooses to show us, has a certain ring of truth about it.

DMX gets a serious role, and just exceeded my exectations.Also nice performances by Michael Ealy as a man filled with nothing but revenge and sorrow, David Arquet, the man who uncoverd David's past via his documentery, and Cliftion Powel, the man King David owes.This movie is dark, gritty, and a movie that shouldn't be slept on, especially by fans of X.

entirely.Still very good though,NVDA is based on an asortment of novels written by the best voice of the streets and by far the best at writing ghetto,urban tales of despair,addiction,violence,and just raw unforgiving real life.Mr. Donald Goines besides Elmore Leonard he would be my favorite and definately the most visceral author to ever put pen to paper.Usually great novels sometimes don't transfer to screen well,but this is not the case.Ernest Dickerson is one of the best genre film directors of this generation anyone who is familiar with him will know.Several episodes of The Walking Dead,Masters Of Horror,the man is just brilliant and he truly brings Donald's Novel to life with his gritty noir style directing and the screenplay does Goines justice.And DMX is absolutly frightning and unforgiving as King David,a heroin dealing,women hating,just ugly human being but just like most evil he is very charming and likeable and just knows how to make it in a world where nothing but wolves are around and if your not ruthless,cunning,and willing to do what you got to do to prosper then your dead.That is what makes this character so memorable is that he is a very like able bad man,not since De Niro in Cape Fear has just an all around evil,bad human being been so easy to root for,so for all these ignorant haters that wanna talk crap about x just stop.He is a great rapper and when needed a damn fine actor he really becomes King David and his narration and past tense story telling is very engaging from the opening shot of him in the casket to the closing credits of all the lives he in directly effected.The movie itself is just as raw and bleak and unforgiving as it's main character.Loaded with drugs,sex,brutality,and just raw power.It is the kind of movie that stays with you and in no way glorifies or try's to make the life of a criminal look cool or fun.There is nothing fun about being completely alone,hated,hunted,and in the end not very rich and dead.This is why the man is seeking redemption but as you see when you live that dirty it is hard to get clean.All in all Never Die Alone is a great movie,stays with the material it was based on with an exceptional performance by it's lead and great supporting jobs as well.When you think of great books made into great movies.Stephen King's Shawshank Redemption,Elmore Leonard's Rum punch(Jackie Brown) 3:10 to Yuma,Nicholas Pilleggi(Casino,Goodfellas)Never Die Alone is right up there with being very true to the source and as one of the best adaptations to film ever made.Donal Goines would have been

But I will admit I didn't have high expectations ahead of time. This may contain a few spoilers.It has David Arqette in it, and basically he see's DMX get stabbed in the beginning, and then DMX is so surprised that he stopped to help him, that on his deathbed in the hostpital, he signs over his car and all his possessions to him. Well, in his car he finds these tapes that DMX made, kind of a autobiography. It talks about how he ripped off this drug kingpin, and then went out west for a while, but then decided to come back and make things right, but then he gets killed. And so the drug dealers guys see david arquette and try and have him killed cause he's a witness to the whole deal. The drug dealer sent two guys to get payment from DMX and that's when things went wrong and DMX got killed, so the drug dealer has those two guys killed also, but they screw up and one gets away, who then goes after the drug dealer. So, it's actually a pretty complicated movie, with a lot of shooting, drugs, and ghetto in it. Like I said, not a bad movie, kind of an interesting concept. In the beginning of the movie david arquette was trying to get a job with a newspaper and in the end, the newspaper hires him after reading the story he wrote, which was all about the interesting events that happend to him after he saw DMX get stabbed.Overall, kind of cool. If you like DMX, and you're into the whole drugs, shooting, cursing, ghetto kind of thing, then you'll probably find this movie entertaining.
