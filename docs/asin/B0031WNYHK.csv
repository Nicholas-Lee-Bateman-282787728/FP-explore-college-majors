1318048,A1H4X50VE4K2W6,B0031WNYHK,"A. D. Bowman ""64panther""","[4, 4]","Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide is a very effective line from this documentary. It deals with the knowledge of an enslaved and oppressed people, knowing that their oppressor will never willingly set them free. Thus begin this very thought provoking series that chronicles the 30 year span of the Civil Rights Movement from 1954 through 1984. However, this is not a thoroughly comprehensive piece because far too many figures were either omitted or appear all too briefly, chiefly, Thorogood Marshall, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and Malcolm X. Nor would I have you believe that the movement started in 1954, because this struggle dates back to the 16th century and was sucessfully contained and controlled until the mid 20th century. There are fine, in fact, excellent documentaries that deserve to be seen along with this one, most notably are: Africans In America; A Journey Through Slavery, ( 2 ) Reconstruction: The Second Civil War and ( 3 ) Citizen King, worthy of a look. But for the period this film covers, it is unsurpassed in what it reveals. A warning however should be noted that this is a stark, violent document that often show scenes that are very disturbing, but a necessary element to illustrate the brutality inflicted upon a people who were forcibly taken from their homes and enslaved in the new colonies, purportedly built on the principles and concepts of Freedom.  This journey begins with the Supreme Court ruling in the Brown-vs-The Board Of Education. From there we are swept along to the mobilization of the Mobile bus boycott and introduces us to the young Dr. Martin Luther King. It is my opinion that the speeches of Dr. King, alone make it a must have in every home. Far too many young people of today think that black history is what was atop the Hip-Hop charts a year ago. This is why this item should be in every home, should be viewed by everyone you know, should be recommended to every American regardless of race, because blacks alone did not overcome the situation in America. This is a truly remarkable piece to own. And in the words of Dr. King ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" Failing to view or purchase this DVD set would be a true injustice.

I use parts of it in my survey history course at the local community college--and have for the past 25 years.,5,Excellent Series!,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,165,"['finally', 'purchased', 'whole', 'Eyes', 'Prize', 'series', 'use', 'parts', 'survey', 'history', 'course', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'have', 'past', '25', 'years']",N/A
1318050,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,B0031WNYHK,Birdman,"[3, 3]","This is the sort of film which inspires awe at the courage of its subjects, humility at the fine execution of its filmmakers, and a certain yearning.  A film such as this can never be produced again, and certainly not on a similar budget. In this film you walk with the Little Rock Nine into class, you stand by James Meredith's side, and marvel at the massive movement Rosa Parks stirred with bus boycotts in the south.  It is, without any qualification except for the absence of a booklet or significant extras, a masterpiece that every American family of conscience should own.I've heard all the stirring in the ranks about the fact that this, specific release of the film ends with the pivotal civil rights legislation of 1965. That's true, but it fact, 1965 was the original delimited of the classic documentary. EYES ON THE PRIZE PART 2, continues the history of the movement into the 1980's. I will buy that one, when released, but if I had to chose between ""parts"" 1 or 2, I'd choose this part. These chronicle the roots of a struggle which persists to the present day and impacts Americans of both genders, all races and affectional preferences. But it is first a tribute to the courage, faith and ingenuity of those African-Americans who lived through, and lived-out the period. I came of age with many.Stylistically, it's different from the Ken Burns' model --which has many merits -- but whose accounts of historical events are often one step removed from the action. The producers of EYES ON THE PRIZE rely little on printed or oral narratives and more with the visual artifacts of events, some so stirring or outrageous, they help us recognize how apathetic many of the living take their responsibilities to challenge those who would steal those inviolable, Constitutional rights in a second.As a product, the ""slipcase"" is week, and mine arrived with a huge crushed corner. Neither PBS nor Blackside ever responded to my request for a replacement.  The visual material, however, is beautifully remastered with both audio and video fine-tuned and engaging.  And yes, the price is a steal because te license-fee structure for the many words and images which appear here cost money.  The more current the material, often the higher the fees.  If this sounds like I've said, ""history is for sale in thousands of small pieces, each with its own contract,"" you're right.  The new America sees profit in everything, regardless of its primary cultural significance and educational value.  It is, in a word, voracious, and encourages me to address my representatives on potential revisions to artifacts considered to be ""public domain.""  If this seems to progressive for some customers, I respect their opposition; however there is no sane reason whatsoever why some foundation (such as the Ford Foundation which was one of several that enabled this product to happen) doesn't move in and help cure the licensor's pain.All this aside, buy this -- the original documentary -- for yourselves, for your children and for those you respect, because they are pivotal and critical for viewers of all genders, races, national origins, ages -- I could go on.One of the few true jewels available to the general public at this price.",5,"This is the original, classic documentary -- as labeled -- through 1965",1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,3228,"['sort', 'film', 'awe', 'courage', 'subjects', 'humility', 'fine', 'execution', 'filmmakers', 'certain', 'yearning', 'film', 'such', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'produced', 'again', 'certainly', 'not', 'similar', 'budget', 'film', 'walk', 'Little', 'Rock', 'Nine', 'class', 'stand', 'James', 'Meredith', 'side', 'marvel', 'massive', 'movement', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'stirred', 'bus', 'boycotts', 'south', 'qualification', 'absence', 'booklet', 'significant', 'extras', 'masterpiece', 'American', 'family', 'conscience', 'should', 'own.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'stirring', 'ranks', 'fact', 'specific', 'release', 'film', 'pivotal', 'civil', 'rights', 'legislation', '1965', 'true', 'fact', '1965', 'was', 'original', 'delimited', 'classic', 'documentary', 'EYES', 'PRIZE', 'PART', '2', 'history', 'movement', '1980', 'will', 'buy', 'one', 'when', 'released', 'had', 'chose', 'parts', '1', '2', ""'d"", 'choose', 'part', 'chronicle', 'roots', 'struggle', 'present', 'day', 'impacts', 'Americans', 'genders', 'races', 'affectional', 'preferences', 'first', 'tribute', 'courage', 'faith', 'ingenuity', 'African-Americans', 'who', 'lived', 'lived-out', 'period', 'came', 'age', 'many.Stylistically', 'different', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'model', 'many', 'merits', 'accounts', 'historical', 'events', 'are', 'often', 'one', 'step', 'removed', 'action', 'producers', 'EYES', 'ON', 'THE', 'PRIZE', 'rely', 'little', 'printed', 'oral', 'narratives', 'more', 'visual', 'artifacts', 'events', 'so', 'stirring', 'outrageous', 'help', 'recognize', 'how', 'apathetic', 'many', 'living', 'take', 'responsibilities', 'challenge', 'who', 'would', 'steal', 'inviolable', 'Constitutional', 'rights', 'second.As', 'product', 'slipcase', 'week', 'mine', 'arrived', 'huge', 'crushed', 'corner', 'PBS', 'Blackside', 'ever', 'responded', 'request', 'replacement', 'visual', 'material', 'however', 'beautifully', 'remastered', 'audio', 'video', 'fine-tuned', 'engaging', 'yes', 'price', 'steal', 'te', 'license-fee', 'structure', 'many', 'words', 'images', 'appear', 'here', 'cost', 'money', 'more', 'current', 'material', 'often', 'higher', 'fees', ""'ve"", 'said', 'history', 'sale', 'thousands', 'small', 'pieces', 'own', 'contract', ""'re"", 'right', 'new', 'America', 'profit', 'everything', 'regardless', 'primary', 'cultural', 'significance', 'educational', 'value', 'word', 'voracious', 'address', 'representatives', 'potential', 'revisions', 'artifacts', 'considered', 'be', 'public', 'domain', 'progressive', 'customers', 'respect', 'opposition', 'however', 'sane', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'why', 'foundation', 'such', 'Ford', 'Foundation', 'was', 'one', 'several', 'enabled', 'product', 'happen', ""n't"", 'move', 'help', 'cure', 'licensor', 'pain.All', 'aside', 'buy', 'original', 'documentary', 'yourselves', 'children', 'respect', 'are', 'pivotal', 'critical', 'viewers', 'genders', 'races', 'national', 'origins', 'ages', 'could', 'go', 'on.One', 'few', 'true', 'jewels', 'available', 'general', 'public', 'price']",N/A

It reveals the abuse and  oppression of a people against those who were different.

No student or person should live without seeing this documentary of unconstitutional behavior, and they should take notice of the Southern &#34;leaders&#34; that made racism their card to winning office across the South for over 100 years.
