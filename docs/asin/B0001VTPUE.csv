Not long after that they end up getting married, wife, kids, the usual deal.. then Ray becomes suspicious..he starts to investigate and what he finds you wont believe.Picture this: Your own wife is a psychopath and you dont find out until 2-3 years into the marriage and start piecing together clues as the years go by and then all of a sudden you find out this woman isnt who she says she is, everything shes said has been a lie and worse..When he finds out and confronts her... well i'll let you find out for yourself, all i can tell you is its insane what she does to him, she fools and manipulates everyone into believing hes the 'crazy' one, then the twist of an ending.. This is the worst case scenario that could happen to someone. This woman is your worst nightmare. This combined with weird dreamlike carnival sequences make this a very good thriller.

How about getting a detective to produce evidence detailing the infidelities committed by the wife and making divorce easy-peasie? But no......we have to go to the hard way as seen in Dream Lover. As always, I am a sucker for James Spader's films, and as usual, he is great in Dream Lover. I just wish he had picked a better story to work with although I am sure he found the plot behind Dream Lover to be alluring. It's fair to say how dumb and manipulative the picture is especially there is a better version done from Love Stinks. The first fifteen minutes of Dream Lover starts off pretty badly and then it gets better with the wonderful chemistry initiated between James Spader and M&auml;dchen Amick. I had hoped the rest of the film would follow and give 9  Weeks a run for its money. After a while, Dream Lover starts coming off by its seams based on how ridiculously one-dimensional M&auml;dchen Amick appeared. The way the plot unfolded went too far in its efforts of being an intelligent wannabe mystery. It doesn't make any sense to me when a guy marries a woman without knowing him very well. At least the final twist was very surprising and unpredictable. All in all, I'll watch Dream Lover for James Spader again but for anything else, I prefer Love Stinks.
