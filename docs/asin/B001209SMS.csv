It took everything within me to hide my reluctance. Did I mention I'm not a Johnny Depp fan? Anyway, My wife and I stroll into the theatre, sit in our over priced seats, and I prepare myself for what I'm convinced will be two hours of absolute torcher (did I mention I'm not a Johnny Depp fan). Much to my surprise this movie actually had some quality to it. A musical version of a barber who loses everything, goes mad, and starts to murder everyone. That aside, I was actually impressed with the movie as a whole. The singing was good, the plot was decent, and the acting above average. Of course my favorable review could be somewhat tarnished by the fact that the last film I saw Depp in (Pirates of The Caribbean 3) was HORRIBLE... I doubt he could have disappointed me less with this film. Keeping that in mind I will give this film 3.5 stars. A decent plot, good singing, above average acting (by hollywood standards), and I can honestly say I could sit through it again. Given that this is not my choice of entertainment this is probably about as glowing of a review this film could have hoped for from me. After all this is just one man's honest opinion.Take Care,Marc :)",3,Better then I expected,1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,1281,"['wife', 'tells', 'see', 'movie', 'surprise', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fan', ""'m"", 'not', 'took', 'everything', 'hide', 'reluctance', 'Did', 'mention', ""'m"", 'not', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fan', 'Anyway', 'My', 'wife', 'stroll', 'theatre', 'sit', 'priced', 'seats', 'prepare', 'what', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'will', 'be', 'two', 'hours', 'absolute', 'torcher', 'did', 'mention', ""'m"", 'not', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fan', 'Much', 'surprise', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'quality', 'musical', 'version', 'barber', 'who', 'everything', 'mad', 'murder', 'everyone', 'aside', 'was', 'actually', 'impressed', 'movie', 'whole', 'singing', 'was', 'good', 'plot', 'was', 'decent', 'acting', 'average', 'course', 'favorable', 'review', 'could', 'be', 'somewhat', 'tarnished', 'fact', 'last', 'film', 'saw', 'Depp', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', '3', 'was', 'HORRIBLE', 'doubt', 'could', 'have', 'disappointed', 'less', 'film', 'Keeping', 'mind', 'will', 'give', 'film', '3.5', 'stars', 'decent', 'plot', 'good', 'singing', 'average', 'acting', 'hollywood', 'standards', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'could', 'sit', 'again', 'Given', 'not', 'choice', 'entertainment', 'probably', 'about', 'glowing', 'review', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'just', 'one', 'man', 'honest', 'opinion.Take', 'Care', 'Marc']",N/A
1133481,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B001209SMS,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[19, 22]","I've never seen `Sweeney Todd' before.  Touted in high school and offstage by Angela Lansberry who played Mrs. Lovett and lovingly reminisced over her role in an interview, I decided to take a pass.  The thought of a musical about the bloody (demon) barber of Fleet Street seemed too unsavory and too discordant.  Excerpts showed its potential audience scenes with beautiful music matched with too much gore.  I kept picturing something like murder done to Rossini's ""Barber of Seville;"" something that seemed like a bizarre and comic mismatch.  Trying to bring a `Green Eggs and Ham' (sorry) mentality to the cinema, I did get a shock; more than one to be exact.  Somehow it all came together.Here's why.  First of all, Tim Burton, the dark director who gave us 'Batman' and wrote `The Nightmare Before Christmas' was the perfect choice for this musical.  The close up shots, the editing, the timing, the wide angles, and the zooming in and out are done to perfection.  The macabre atmosphere is perfectly framed without dwelling too long on any one image or scene.  In terms of cinematography, I kept thinking of Carol Reed's `Oliver' for getting every frame nearly perfect.  Secondly, Johnny Depp's performance is right on.  I was expecting the dark side of Johnny Depp--or Jack Sparrow without laughs. This is only partly true.  Depp comes to the screen in his own right, creating a familiar, but decidedly different leg in his acting ability.  There's the same confidence, but a real, seething vengeance in his performance.  He's not a bad singer, either.  Certainly, we need just enough of a character voice, which, unsurprisingly, he can do.The story entails class warfare that I can only describe as the British equivalent of The French Revolution done in miniature.  Benjamin Barker (bka Sweeney Todd) is given short shrift by the aristocracy in power.  Judge Turpin's (Alan Rickman) unjust sentence takes his dignity away, and his daughter, Johanna, is Turpin's captive love interest.  Keeping a long arm is Turpin's weasel servant Beedle (Timothy Spall).At a traveling elixir show, Todd shows his shaving prowess in a wagered stage contest.  Once he wins against Italian purveyor, Perelli (Sacha Baron Cohen, 'Borat'), he gains an enemy as well as a boost in his barber livelihood.  The barber of Fleet Street finds his supply of razors his method of revenge.  In the meantime, his love interest, Mrs. Lovett, downstairs has a pie shop, including a most bizarre method of recycling corpses released from Sweeney Todd's trap door upstairs.The supporting cast effectively flanks Depp, including Helena Bonham Carter, who gives us someone both steely and sensitive enough to play the part as Mrs. Lovett.  Turpin's and Beedle's villainy are given just the right touch to ally our sympathies with Todd.  Again, the timing is awesome for building up such arrogant and loathsome antagonists from the Victorian Era.While I may prefer the class warfare as it's espoused by Charles Dickens and Ray Davies, I have to take the tale as is.  And, as it is, it's a remarkably powerful musical voyage through a dark and grisly chapter of vengeance.  I must also note that, although 'Sweeney Todd' is by no means new, it is a part of this year's trend toward cutthroat violence at the cinema.  ('Eastern Promises' comes to mind.)  Finally, listening to the music, not only do the songs blend, but they add suspense to the story.  Any way you look at it, it's quite a feat.",5,Unsavory,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,3467,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Touted', 'high', 'school', 'offstage', 'Angela', 'Lansberry', 'who', 'played', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'lovingly', 'reminisced', 'role', 'interview', 'decided', 'take', 'pass', 'thought', 'musical', 'bloody', 'demon', 'barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'seemed', 'too', 'unsavory', 'too', 'discordant', 'Excerpts', 'showed', 'potential', 'audience', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'music', 'matched', 'too', 'much', 'gore', 'kept', 'picturing', 'something', 'murder', 'done', 'Rossini', 'Barber', 'Seville', 'something', 'seemed', 'bizarre', 'comic', 'mismatch', 'Trying', 'bring', 'Green', 'Eggs', 'Ham', 'sorry', 'mentality', 'cinema', 'did', 'get', 'shock', 'more', 'one', 'be', 'exact', 'Somehow', 'came', 'why', 'First', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'dark', 'director', 'who', 'gave', ""'Batman"", 'wrote', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'musical', 'close', 'shots', 'editing', 'timing', 'wide', 'angles', 'zooming', 'are', 'done', 'perfection', 'macabre', 'perfectly', 'framed', 'dwelling', 'too', 'long', 'one', 'image', 'scene', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'Oliver', 'getting', 'frame', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'Secondly', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'right', 'was', 'expecting', 'dark', 'side', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'laughs', 'only', 'partly', 'true', 'Depp', 'screen', 'own', 'right', 'creating', 'familiar', 'decidedly', 'different', 'leg', 'acting', 'ability', 'same', 'confidence', 'real', 'seething', 'vengeance', 'performance', 'not', 'bad', 'singer', 'either', 'Certainly', 'need', 'just', 'enough', 'character', 'voice', 'unsurprisingly', 'can', 'do.The', 'story', 'entails', 'class', 'warfare', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'British', 'equivalent', 'French', 'Revolution', 'done', 'miniature', 'Benjamin', 'Barker', 'bka', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'aristocracy', 'power', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'unjust', 'sentence', 'dignity', 'away', 'daughter', 'Johanna', 'Turpin', 'captive', 'love', 'interest', 'Keeping', 'long', 'arm', 'Turpin', 'weasel', 'servant', 'Beedle', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'traveling', 'elixir', 'show', 'Todd', 'shaving', 'prowess', 'wagered', 'stage', 'contest', 'Italian', 'purveyor', 'Perelli', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', ""'Borat"", 'gains', 'enemy', 'as', 'well', 'boost', 'barber', 'livelihood', 'barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'supply', 'razors', 'method', 'revenge', 'meantime', 'love', 'interest', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'downstairs', 'pie', 'shop', 'including', 'most', 'bizarre', 'method', 'recycling', 'corpses', 'released', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'trap', 'door', 'upstairs.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'effectively', 'Depp', 'including', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'someone', 'steely', 'sensitive', 'enough', 'play', 'part', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Turpin', 'Beedle', 'villainy', 'are', 'given', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'ally', 'sympathies', 'Todd', 'Again', 'timing', 'awesome', 'building', 'up', 'such', 'arrogant', 'loathsome', 'antagonists', 'Victorian', 'Era.While', 'may', 'prefer', 'class', 'warfare', 'espoused', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Ray', 'Davies', 'have', 'take', 'tale', 'remarkably', 'powerful', 'musical', 'voyage', 'dark', 'grisly', 'chapter', 'vengeance', 'must', 'also', 'note', ""'Sweeney"", 'Todd', 'means', 'new', 'part', 'year', 'trend', 'cutthroat', 'violence', 'cinema', ""'Eastern"", 'Promises', 'mind', 'Finally', 'listening', 'music', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'songs', 'blend', 'add', 'suspense', 'story', 'way', 'look', 'quite', 'feat']",N/A

1133486,AJWMVSLEVJ1UP,B001209SMS,Alan W. Petrucelli,"[2, 2]","Tim Burton's cinematic version of Sondheim's macabre tale is magnificent, wondrous, brilliant and all them other words. Sondheim has suffered gravely toiling in Hollywood's fields; A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum bore slight resemblance to the original stage work, and the less said about the film of A Little Night Music, the better. In Sweeney, we have a film in total service to the music and lyrics, yet very different from the live show. The sexual relationships are bit easier to understand due to the greatly reduced ages of the performers. More than that, Sweeney Todd is a movie that has in its background a stage show. It can be called artificial in the sense that to a greater or lesser extent, all of Burton's films are laid in an incredibly tightly controlled world ruled by the director and his designers. Artificial, maybe, but never stagy. The piece has been totally reimagined for the movie, songs cut and re-arranged, shortened, lengthened and rethought to work in a completely cinematic way. With homage to the Hammer horror films, Burton moves swiftly and smoothly through a Victorian London created only for this world of Sweeney. The cast is fine, with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter acting and singing the murderous couple with calm and calculating competence. Alan Rickman could perhaps be a little more seedy and pervy as the Judge, and a non-Borat Sacha Baron Cohen is properly slimy as Pirelli, Sweeney's first victim. This movie is the first really good movie musical in years.

Finally, the international cut of the movie is a little too grotesque than it needs to be, giving the movie an air reminiscent of the horror movies of the 1980s.

I am ( sorry everyone) not a huge Johnny Depp fan or even Tim Burton for that matter, BUT this movie may have changed my mind. What an amazing production, I loved the grays and the dark mood ( perfect October-time movie) and the surreal switch of scenes to colorful happier memories or wishful daydreams.I won't recap the story as I am sure other reviewers before me have done so.Johnny Depp has an absolutely gorgeous and evocative singing voice, and in many of his movies I have found him cold and wooden but, not in this. His eyes, his body language...this may well be one of the roles he was always meant to play. And frankly, I think he looks better now as a man than he did as a boy. His pretty face is now chiseled and interesting.Helena also has a beautiful singing voice but half of her lyrics were lost. I could not understand a word she was singing!The actress who played Johana....angelic. Her voice like a crystal bell and could bring you to tears. The sailer boy who saves her...another gifted singer. Alan Rickman, an actor who can play any and everything, captured the sinister judge.Oh, and Sasha Cohen! I had heard some negatives about him, but I disagree. He was wonderful and quirky, sang great! Along with the urchin... I guess I have to say all around every performance was terrific.I just had to dock a star because it was, for me, wayyyyyyy too bloody. I would have preferred the beatings and the murders alluded to, not shown. But that is me. I just closed my eyes during those parts so I could continue listening to the sublime score.The costumes were vividly strange, and even Helena's ratty hair style worked! Seems pretty impossible to make that gorgeous creature look bad, even with the painted black circles around her eyes, she is a knockout goth babe.Make SURE to watch the extra feature, there is a mini documentary in the DVD with interviews with Johnny, Helena, the director, the producer and others. Great behind the scenes shots of them filming, of creating the sets and costumes, and the 2 leads talking about their first singing parts ( this movie). I thought the documentary was as good as the movie itself!NOW I am definatly going to get the Broadway stage DVD with AngelaLandsbury, who, by all accounts, set the bar for this part.PS- my favorite scene and song was when Johnny Depp was singing to his razors. Incredibly bizarre in a wonderful way, and his singing blew me away.",4,Goth to the last bloody drop,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,2474,"['did', 'not', 'expect', 'like', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'am', 'sorry', 'everyone', 'not', 'huge', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fan', 'even', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'matter', 'BUT', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'What', 'amazing', 'production', 'loved', 'grays', 'dark', 'mood', 'perfect', 'October-time', 'movie', 'surreal', 'switch', 'scenes', 'colorful', 'happier', 'memories', 'wishful', 'daydreams.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recap', 'story', 'am', 'sure', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'so.Johnny', 'Depp', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'evocative', 'singing', 'voice', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'found', 'cold', 'wooden', 'not', 'eyes', 'body', 'language', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'roles', 'was', 'always', 'meant', 'play', 'frankly', 'think', 'better', 'now', 'man', 'did', 'boy', 'pretty', 'face', 'now', 'chiseled', 'interesting.Helena', 'also', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'voice', 'half', 'lyrics', 'were', 'lost', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'word', 'was', 'singing', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Johana', '.angelic', 'voice', 'crystal', 'bell', 'could', 'bring', 'tears', 'sailer', 'boy', 'who', 'gifted', 'singer', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'everything', 'captured', 'sinister', 'judge.Oh', 'Sasha', 'Cohen', 'had', 'heard', 'negatives', 'disagree', 'was', 'wonderful', 'quirky', 'sang', 'great', 'urchin', 'guess', 'have', 'say', 'around', 'performance', 'was', 'terrific.I', 'just', 'had', 'dock', 'star', 'was', 'wayyyyyyy', 'too', 'bloody', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'beatings', 'murders', 'alluded', 'not', 'shown', 'just', 'closed', 'eyes', 'parts', 'so', 'could', 'continue', 'listening', 'sublime', 'score.The', 'costumes', 'were', 'vividly', 'strange', 'even', 'Helena', 'ratty', 'hair', 'style', 'worked', 'Seems', 'pretty', 'impossible', 'make', 'gorgeous', 'creature', 'look', 'bad', 'even', 'painted', 'black', 'circles', 'eyes', 'knockout', 'goth', 'babe.Make', 'SURE', 'watch', 'extra', 'feature', 'mini', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'Johnny', 'Helena', 'director', 'producer', 'others', 'Great', 'scenes', 'shots', 'filming', 'creating', 'sets', 'costumes', '2', 'leads', 'talking', 'first', 'singing', 'parts', 'movie', 'thought', 'documentary', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'NOW', 'am', 'definatly', 'going', 'get', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'DVD', 'AngelaLandsbury', 'who', 'accounts', 'set', 'bar', 'part.PS-', 'favorite', 'scene', 'song', 'was', 'when', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'singing', 'razors', 'Incredibly', 'bizarre', 'wonderful', 'way', 'singing', 'blew', 'away']",N/A

Although their cause is understandable, their actions are repulsive, and makes this whole thing disturbing (it's like Jack the Ripper starring in his own musical!).Although this is probably the best musical Tim Burton has made, it is also the darkest.  Between Tood killing people and his girlfriend cooking their corpses into meat pies (all to the sound of joyous music), it's very disturbing.  At the same time, that is what makes the film good.  You are made to relate to the characters' plights, before delving into total serial-killer madness.  Ultimately, it appeals to the wicked side of your tastes, and sucks you into a realm of grotesque pleasure.

1133498,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001209SMS,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","There are some major plusses to Tim Burton's `Sweeney Todd', and then there are some major lulls.  Balancing out the two in the attempt to write a well-rounded and non-bias review is difficult.  One leans towards a particular viewpoint.  You either dwell on the lows or you dwell on the highs.Considering my current estimation of both Depp's and Burton's worth, I tend to focus on those lows.`Sweeney Todd' tells the story of a barber, envied for his lovely wife by a corrupt judge.  That judge trumps up a false charge against the barber and has him locked away so that he can advance upon his wife.  Years later, this barber is back in London seeking revenge under a new name, Sweeney Todd.  With the help of a downtrodden baker (who's pies are the worst around), Todd sets up his shop of massacre, targeting the men responsible for his emotional demise and the apparent suicide of his wife.  His plans are desperate, especially when he hears of plans made by the judge to marry the daughter bore to Todd before his imprisonment.The construction of this musical is VERY good.  I love the way that Burton was able to capture the real decadence of the stage while maintaining his signature style of whimsical macabre.  The darkness envelopes each scene in a way that defies current perception of `the musical'.  I loved the way that this felt to stage-like; like I was really in the Opera House.  It is such a richly textured film.  The costumes, the set pieces; they are flawless.That said; the film is flawed.The main batch of performances are lackluster, with one exception (Alan Rickman).  The two leads (Depp and Bonham Carter) are horrible singers who drag down their scenes with lackluster vocals.  The internal flow of the film is stilted in moments (parts truly drag themselves out) and the young star-crossed lovers are terrible acts, despite being marginally better singers than the leads.  Oh, and I loathe that Sacha Baron Cohen has been reduced to a flamboyant `accent' in every film he's in now.  I mean, he's so much more than that!  Sadly, the musical itself is a hard one to sing with conviction and emotional relevance.  The hooks are tricky and don't swell in areas that are enveloping like more recognizable musicals.  Because of that, the lack of vocal ability really takes center stage here.At least that little boy can sing his butt off.See this for the goth/sheek fashions and Alan Rickman's brilliantly crafted performance (so subtle yet invested in his sincere `evil').",3,Bled out...,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,2496,"['are', 'major', 'plusses', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'then', 'are', 'major', 'lulls', 'Balancing', 'out', 'two', 'attempt', 'write', 'well-rounded', 'non-bias', 'review', 'difficult', 'One', 'particular', 'viewpoint', 'either', 'dwell', 'lows', 'dwell', 'highs.Considering', 'current', 'estimation', 'Depp', 'Burton', 'worth', 'tend', 'focus', 'lows.', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'story', 'barber', 'envied', 'lovely', 'wife', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'judge', 'up', 'false', 'charge', 'barber', 'locked', 'away', 'so', 'can', 'advance', 'wife', 'Years', 'later', 'barber', 'back', 'London', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'new', 'name', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'help', 'downtrodden', 'baker', 'who', 'pies', 'are', 'worst', 'around', 'Todd', 'up', 'shop', 'massacre', 'targeting', 'men', 'responsible', 'emotional', 'demise', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'wife', 'plans', 'are', 'desperate', 'especially', 'when', 'plans', 'made', 'judge', 'marry', 'daughter', 'bore', 'Todd', 'imprisonment.The', 'construction', 'musical', 'VERY', 'good', 'love', 'way', 'Burton', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'real', 'decadence', 'stage', 'maintaining', 'signature', 'style', 'whimsical', 'macabre', 'darkness', 'envelopes', 'scene', 'way', 'current', 'perception', 'musical', 'loved', 'way', 'felt', 'stage-like', 'was', 'really', 'Opera', 'House', 'such', 'richly', 'textured', 'film', 'costumes', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'flawless.That', 'said', 'film', 'flawed.The', 'main', 'batch', 'performances', 'are', 'lackluster', 'one', 'exception', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'two', 'leads', 'Depp', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'are', 'horrible', 'singers', 'who', 'drag', 'down', 'scenes', 'lackluster', 'vocals', 'internal', 'flow', 'film', 'stilted', 'moments', 'parts', 'truly', 'drag', 'out', 'young', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'are', 'terrible', 'acts', 'being', 'marginally', 'better', 'singers', 'leads', 'Oh', 'loathe', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'been', 'reduced', 'flamboyant', 'accent', 'film', 'now', 'mean', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Sadly', 'musical', 'hard', 'one', 'sing', 'conviction', 'emotional', 'relevance', 'hooks', 'are', 'tricky', 'do', ""n't"", 'swell', 'areas', 'are', 'enveloping', 'more', 'recognizable', 'musicals', 'lack', 'vocal', 'ability', 'really', 'center', 'stage', 'here.At', 'least', 'little', 'boy', 'can', 'sing', 'butt', 'off.See', 'goth/sheek', 'fashions', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'performance', 'so', 'subtle', 'yet', 'invested', 'sincere', 'evil']",N/A
1133499,A3CI8MV3MFYJK3,B001209SMS,Andrew,"[8, 20]","Bearing in mind what Tim Burton films are like, I was still disappointed with the end result of the film adaptation of SWEENEY TODD. Most of the problems lie in the fact that Burton makes an already dark and gory tale even darker and gorier. This is precedence over plot and character detail, even cutting songs from the original show that greatly helped these areas.In discussing the film with my fellow moviegoer, we agreed that the movie does suffer from having ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" excluded from this version. By including any passerby that the camera zooms by (which in this day of CGI, such editing was inevitable) or lingers on, Burton could have easily made this work, too - what a shame. Some cuts and changes, do better the story, such as the toning down of Johanna by making her less freaky a person and less shrieky a singer.Unfortunately every plus like the aforementioned instance, is met with more than one minus, such as the way the character of the homeless woman in brought into the movie. By introducing her so late into the story (also by cutting an earlier song of hers), we wonder, why bother at all? She becomes a tacked-on subplot, an afterthought of the screenplay. It's no wonder Johnny Depp looks to feel almost nothing for her at the end of the film.I am also on the ilk that thinks principle characters should not be shown gruesomely dying in the picture frame, unless it serves a clear purpose (e.g. Janet Leigh in PSYCHO). If not, then it only becomes pure exploitation (and hopefully I've given enough hints as to which character I'm speaking of without totally giving it away). This only becomes more apparent as you watch certain characters die and ask, ""how come they got an explicit death scene and not this character?"" What is the point, indeed...The movie also highlights contrivances in the story itself: how, out of all the people in London, could this homeless woman have encountered all the characters in the story on separate occasions? It's because she's there merely to keep the storytelling wheels turning, and when the story is slimmed down to a stage presence, it seems to make more sense. Likewise, the absence of police, who appear at the end of the play, but not the film. With townspeople disappearing left and right, how could they not have intervened sooner? The movie leaves us with these questions of logic, which, even for a musical, should have been addressed.As for the principles, they all do an okay job. If any criticism is to be made about the restraint in their singing and acting, the finger should be pointed at how the film was directed. Burton seems to think that he can counterbalance each person by giving them an overly cartoony exterior (Sweeney's Bride-Of-Frankenstein hair) and a very, very subtle interior; subtle to the point of shallow character depth and a communication barely audible (and God only knows how many lines I missed because the actors spoke so quietly). The play seems to have worked successfully with these values reversed - underplayed, but period costumes with bombastic personalities.Timothy Spall -- whom I hold in high regard, but know he accepts bad scripts sometimes -- is sadly reduced to nothing more than a sniveling rat, complete with bulging eyes and gnarly teeth. I pictured Beadle the way he's seen on stage and thought Spall would fit in so seamlessly. Here his craft is wasted on a one-dimensional, stereotypical villain - another sad, shame of the movie.Sacha Baron Cohen, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him kind of role, is almost totally pointless in being cast. So long as the film had a big name like Depp to draw audiences, any person could have been cast in the role of Pirelli. Most of his songs and lines are reduced to nothing, coupled with an accent that is too difficult to understand. Visually, the moustache bit worked quite well on the stage in revealing his con-artistry, which is not used in the film. Burton only wants to make it known that Borat was cast in his film and wears a ludicrously funny wig before he might be bumped off.Kudos are to be given to Edward Sanders, the child who was rightfully chosen to play Toby. It's nice to finally have someone who is close to the age of the character because, judging from the stage version, I seemed to have it in my head that Toby was just supposed to be a dwarf. His confident singing voice and charismatic involvement makes an impact over the course of the picture.It seems that the movie seems is solely impressionable to people because it is opera-like in its music and jarring in its horror - ""the perfect horror musical."" These extremes are only due to the fact that the music has been slimmed down to just under two hours and the dark comedy is stripped to be just, well, dark. You could really just watch the opening credits and know everything about everything that follows. You could just stop watching altogether, and not have to ask yourself questions like, ""why is Sweeney on a boat with that guy?"" To anyone who knows the story, you'd know Sweeney was a prisoner, but that seems to have been rushed in the movie if you don't pay close attention.Another question to be asked is, ""when is Burton going to NOT use Depp to be some glaring freak in his movies?"" Hopefully the same day Burton decides that making every movie to be a moving Edward Gorey illustration has placed him in a rut. SWEENEY is not a complete waste of time, but it is not half of what it could have been, and Burton most definitely needs a change of scenery.",2,2.5 stars - BARELY MISSES THE MARK,1198713600,"12 27,

The movie is the combined effort of regular collaborators Tim Burton, Jonny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. The film has Tim Burton's signature style all over it with its dark macabre look, its dark macabre romance, and its dark macabre everything else. But that's okay because it works.Probably the first thing people will notice about the movie is that it's a musical. Though you don't usually think of serial killers and musicals at the same time, Sweeny Todd really makes it work and the music, credited to Stephen Sondheim, is excellently written. The performances in Sweeny Todd are very good as well. Jonny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter work wonderfully together while Alan Rickman and young newcomer Ed Sanders do extremely well also.This is a great movie and I highly recommend it.

And therein lies the rub.  The graphic throat cuttings will, without doubt, repel many viewers, and it will be purely a matter of personal aesthetics whether this puts you off the other fine qualities of this film or not.I didn't mind the graphic killings, this being, after all, a musical about a multiple murdering barber, although I confess I was surprised at how blatantly Burton chose to depict them.  I anticipated that this material would be a perfect vehicle for Burton's dark imagination and I was not disappointed.  All of the production values: art design, sets, costumes, cinematography are gloriously atmospheric and beautifully set the tone for the macabre tale that will follow.  Burton's camera is as busy as David Fincher's, although always in sync with the story and never intrusive. This is an extremely well made film, imbued with Burton's brilliant sense of design.All of the cast handle their parts with aplomb.  Johnny Depp acceptably acquits his singing chores and brings the mad intensity and star power to Sweeney that is called for.  He is ably abetted by Helena Bonham Carter and the perfect choices for villains, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall.The insidiously clever and funny lyrics and Sondheim's brilliance have been served well, but it will all ultimately come down to those geysering cut throats.

Well, Johnny Depp has been an exception in enough other circumstances that I ought to have known. It's also gruesome, but it is funny in several ways.The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is based on a true story. Or at least there's some reason to believe he was. Anyway, whether he was a real person or based upon several different stories, the fact is this is both a horror story and a humorous one. It's also, oddly enough, a musical. Yes, musical. Didn't know Johnny Depp could sing, did you? Well, you still won't after you see this film. He sings the way people who can't sing do: not so much off key as not really concerned with key.The story centers around barber Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp), of course, and his friend and landlady, and perhaps lover, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), a widow who sells meat pies. When Sweeney first meets her, she is making ""the worst meat pies in London,"" mostly by capturing cats and no-you-don't-want-to-know-what-else. But after she and barber Sweeney join forces, her pies become much tastier and more popular. You see, Sweeney has created a special barber chair that tilts his victims down into Mrs. Lovett's basement. She has a meat grinder there . . .There's more to the story than that, of course. Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, who plays Snape in the Harry Potter series) is the villain who stole the innocent Todd's wife and adopted his daughter after charging him with a crime he did not commit and sentencing him to transportation, presumably to Australia. By the time he returns to London 18 years later, accompanied by a sailor named Anthony (sweet young lad named Jamie Campbell Bower), his daughter is all grown up, and virtually a prisoner of the evil Judge Turpin. Johanna (Jayne Wisener) is beautiful in that innocent, ethereal style so reminiscent of Jane Austen heroines, and of course falls in love with Anthony, just from him standing outside her window gaping at her while she sings a sad little song so very, very sweetly. Ain't love grand? Of course Anthony has no more notion that she is Sweeney Todd's daughter than he does what the filling is in Mrs. Lovett's pies.Speaking of Alan Rickman and Snape, there's another refugee from the Harry Potter series in this one; the Beadle is played by Timothy Spall, who most of us remember as the sniveling Peter Pettigrew.Have fun, but turn your head when the razor gets close to a customer's neck.

Meanwhile, I'm thinking, ""Of course you liked it, it's one of the finest musicals ever written""  But I believe that the love people give this film is only due to Sondheim's genius source material which Burton did not add anything to.  Burton could only throw his wannabe Edward Gorey style at it, play up the blood, and tell the actors to perform the whole thing without subtext.  This musical is inherently FUNNY.  Hello?  Where was the humor?  This was Depp's least funny role in a musical that SHOULD be darkly HILARIOUS?  Explain that!!!  And for those people who think a tragedy can't be funny look at Hamlet - that show has tons of humor and is arguably the finest work in western drama.  Laughter adds dimension and makes the sad parts sadder.  An overabundance of blood does not make up for cutting out the brilliant irony and swelling emotional power of the musical.  If it was blood he wanted, Burton should have directed a re-make of Evil Dead.  Though he no doubt would have ruined that one too.Also more evidence of Burton's lack of respect for the musical is the fact that he cast ACTORS WHO CAN'T SING THEIR PARTS.

1133513,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B001209SMS,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 5]","Any new team up between long time collaborators Tim Burton and Johnny Depp is always cause for celebration. Nobody makes movies like these two when they get together. Now, it seems that no one makes musicals like they do either. ""Sweeney Todd"", based on the Stephen Sondheim musical, is a marvel of song, production, character, sets, design, and, oh yes, the red stuff. Hope you like it. It's here by the barrel. Like everyone else has said, Tim Burton was born to be the one to bring this dark musical to the big screen and give it another life. It's very much a ""Tim Burton Film"", but has it's own seperate feel to it that is unlike anything else this brilliant visionary has done. Let's start :Benjamin Barker(Johnny Depp), was a normal man who had a beautiful wife and young baby daughter. The evil Judge Turpin(Alan Rickman), fancied the wife for himself. So, he gets Barker out of the way for good, and steps into the role Barker once was. Flash forward 15 years later, and a hardened Barker(complete with Bride Of Frankenstein-like white stripe in his hair)is back in London. He is already a damaged man, but snaps even further when he learns what has become of his wife and child, and who is behind it. He sets up shop above Ms. Lovett's(Helena Bonham Carter)pie shop, as a barber, where he plans to exact his revenge on all that did him wrong.I like musicals, but I have never been one to jump and down in excitement whenever they make a new one. I have never seen the stage musical, but this film is more musical than anything else. There is more singing than there is dialogue, and while some of it is hard to understand, it all works. The music itself, the first time I am hearing any of it, is quite wonderful, dark, and beautiful at the same time. While some of the singers in the film may not be getting record deals after this, they are all adequate, and some a lot better than others. Johnny Depp is an actor who seems to be able to do it all, and his singing here may surprise some. Johnny's tone fits well with the kind of material he has to perform here, and it would of been an embarrasment if he couldn't sing well. Thankfully, he can. Bonham Carter is less impressive in her singing ability, but is brilliant in everything else. The best singers of the bunch are the young actors who play Depp's daughter, Toby, and the young sailor.The cast is all brilliant here. Who else but Johnny Depp?. He is amazingly brilliant, and it's definitley a performance that has Oscar written all over it(and he got a nomination). One of my favorites here is Timothy Spall, who plays the Beadle. He looks so much like a character who would of been in that time and era. Everything about this character and Spall's performance was perfect and on the mark. Rickman, as Judge Turpin, is equally as good. He brings Judge Turpin to life. The young cast here were all well equipped to go head to head with the veterans.In the end, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a masterwork. While a few other Burton movies will come before this, there is no doubt that this is a highlight for Burton as a feature film director. He continues to wow and amaze, and ST is more proof that this guy is a true visionary genius. Why he was denied an Oscar nomination for Best Director is unfathomable. Elsewhere, the movie delivers in storytelling, music, and blood. It's a rich and tragic story brought to glistening life by professionals at the top of their game, and crew members who bring 1860 London and it's inhabitants to life, as if you were really taking a time warp and glimpsing at their lives. The movie is a wonder, and it proves once again that the Depp/Burton combo can't be beat.

1133520,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001209SMS,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 5]","Moving a musical from Broadway to the silver screen is not a simple thing. The abhorrent musicalRentis a prime example. Although Rent had its place on stage, it suffered with its transition to film due to a shoddy script and even shoddier sets and acting. And although SWEENEY TODD has a similar history, it holds up much better.The first successful element of Sweeney Todd is that it has some really fine actors attached to it, as well as director Tim Burton (Corpse Bride), the master of dark themes. Not surprising to any, Mr. Burton has brought along Johnny Depp (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) whom Mr. Burton has apparently set up as his muse. Since 1990, the two have been practically inseparable, and this has turned out to be advantageous to movie audiences. They work very well together and know each others ins-and-outs. Sweeney Todd also benefitted from the dastardly work of Alan Rickman (Harry Potter) as the devilishly evil Judge Turpin. Rickman has been a favorite of mine since 1988 when he starred alongside Bruce Willis in the firstDie Hardfilm. Another surprising bonus was that of Timothy Spall (Enchanted) who plays Beadle, the twisted sidekick to Judge Turpin. Although Mr. Spall can't sing very well, he did act the part of Beadle with exceptional creepiness. Then we come to Mr. Burton's other muse, his wife, Helena Bonham Carter (Wallace & Gromit - The Curse of the Were-Rabbit) who plays the female lead of Ms. Lovett. Mrs. Carter is to be commended for her singing abilities, and she apparently took this film very seriously, going so far as to take a barrage of singing and voice lessons in preparation. The sad part about her role is that I found her singing better than her acting. I could easily have seen someone with more acting and singing abilities in her role (for instance Renee Zellweger). But I must give credit where it is due, and I found her acting portions acceptable if a bit flat.The second success is obvious: the music. Stephen Sondheim's score really reached down and pulled this film up a notch. I particularly enjoyed the music and lyrics during the song ""A Little Priest"" in which Sweeney Todd (Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Carter) look out over the London streets and sing about what certain businessmen or people taste like. I found this to be a good section of the film because it incorporated solid acting, a great song, and some darn funny lines/chorus', something not easily achieved in cinema nowadays.The third success is both a positive and a possible negative: the bloodshed. Similar to a Frank Miller graphic, Sweeney Todd is shown in a black-and-white, sepia-toned fashion while the blood of Sweeney's victims is given the royal red treatment (and there's plenty a-gushin' on-screen, too). Although this adds a flare of color to an otherwise dingy look, it also went a bit over-the-top on several occasions. I have to note here, too, the sickening `thud' sound that the bodies make when they are disposed of down Sweeney Toddy's chute and onto the hard cobbles below. This might turn many viewers off so just beware.As mentioned earlier, Mr. Burton is well-known for his dark themes, and I dare say that this is probably the darkest of them all. But the infusion of some much needed comedy helps this one go down a tad easier. Kind of like eating one of Mrs. Lovett's pies and then drinking a nice ale after.Bon app&eacute;tit!",4,A Little Comedy Helps The Medicine Go Down,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,3390,"['Moving', 'musical', 'Broadway', 'silver', 'screen', 'not', 'simple', 'thing', 'abhorrent', 'musicalRentis', 'prime', 'example', 'Rent', 'had', 'place', 'stage', 'suffered', 'transition', 'film', 'due', 'shoddy', 'script', 'even', 'shoddier', 'sets', 'acting', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'similar', 'history', 'up', 'much', 'first', 'successful', 'element', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'really', 'fine', 'actors', 'attached', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'master', 'dark', 'themes', 'Not', 'surprising', 'Mr.', 'Burton', 'brought', 'along', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'whom', 'Mr.', 'Burton', 'apparently', 'set', 'up', 'muse', '1990', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'practically', 'inseparable', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'advantageous', 'movie', 'audiences', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'know', 'others', 'ins-and-outs', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'also', 'benefitted', 'dastardly', 'work', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'devilishly', 'evil', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Rickman', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', '1988', 'when', 'starred', 'alongside', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'firstDie', 'Hardfilm', 'surprising', 'bonus', 'was', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Enchanted', 'who', 'Beadle', 'twisted', 'sidekick', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Mr.', 'Spall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'act', 'part', 'Beadle', 'exceptional', 'creepiness', 'Then', 'come', 'Mr.', 'Burton', 'other', 'muse', 'wife', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'Curse', 'Were-Rabbit', 'who', 'female', 'lead', 'Ms.', 'Lovett', 'Mrs.', 'Carter', 'be', 'commended', 'singing', 'abilities', 'apparently', 'took', 'film', 'very', 'seriously', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'take', 'barrage', 'singing', 'voice', 'lessons', 'preparation', 'sad', 'part', 'role', 'found', 'singing', 'better', 'acting', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'seen', 'someone', 'more', 'acting', 'singing', 'abilities', 'role', 'instance', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'found', 'acting', 'portions', 'acceptable', 'bit', 'flat.The', 'second', 'success', 'obvious', 'music', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'score', 'really', 'reached', 'down', 'pulled', 'film', 'up', 'notch', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'lyrics', 'song', 'Little', 'Priest', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Depp', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Carter', 'look', 'out', 'London', 'streets', 'sing', 'what', 'certain', 'businessmen', 'people', 'taste', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'section', 'film', 'incorporated', 'solid', 'acting', 'great', 'song', 'darn', 'funny', 'lines/chorus', 'something', 'not', 'easily', 'achieved', 'cinema', 'nowadays.The', 'third', 'success', 'positive', 'possible', 'negative', 'bloodshed', 'Similar', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'graphic', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'shown', 'black-and-white', 'sepia-toned', 'fashion', 'blood', 'Sweeney', 'victims', 'given', 'royal', 'red', 'treatment', 'plenty', 'a-gushin', 'on-screen', 'too', 'flare', 'color', 'otherwise', 'dingy', 'look', 'also', 'went', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'several', 'occasions', 'have', 'note', 'here', 'too', 'sickening', 'thud', 'sound', 'bodies', 'make', 'when', 'are', 'disposed', 'down', 'Sweeney', 'Toddy', 'chute', 'hard', 'cobbles', 'below', 'might', 'turn', 'many', 'viewers', 'off', 'so', 'just', 'beware.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Mr.', 'Burton', 'well-known', 'dark', 'themes', 'dare', 'say', 'probably', 'darkest', 'infusion', 'much', 'needed', 'comedy', 'one', 'go', 'down', 'tad', 'easier', 'Kind', 'eating', 'one', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'pies', 'then', 'drinking', 'nice', 'ale', 'after.Bon', 'app', 'eacute', 'tit']",N/A

I surprisingly enjoyed it.The one flaw: Tim Burton is tied to the apron strings of Bonham Carter.  Johnny Depp seems to be Burton's illegitimate love child.  It is the only way I can explain the innumberable amount of movies Depp inhabits in the Tim Burton world of film-making.Burton could have had a grade-A achievement on his hands.  It is bloody, (though the blood looks like stage blood--still not for children).  Burton worked closely with Sondheim and thus had a well-established plot to put his pretty pictures with.  A rare one for Burton.  Good on imagery; very poor on plot.Having all this too his advantage, he still managed to muck it up by casting Depp and Carter in the two key roles of the opera/musical.  What a pity.Depp is no opera singer; and Carter is just no singer--plain and simple.  If Burton had only cast Patti Lupone or a younger version of her (if he wanted younger, I'm sure Burton could have found one); and Michael Cerveris would have made an excellently menacingly Sweeney Todd.  Cerveris did the chamber opera version and was exceptional as a singing Sweeney.  He oozed evil.Sondheim could have insisted; but perhaps Sondheim simply wanted the money and gave the casting over to Burton.  I would have said ""No"".  sondheim doesn't need the money; and he could have at least put the damp on Depp and Carter.The rest of the cast are very good to excellent.  The two best singers are Tobias and Anthony.  Johanna and the beggar woman were suitably good.But Depp and Carter shall always make this one the big chance of putting Sonheim's gothic opera to film; but ultimately: the one that slipped through Burton's fingers. Even though it was staged and filmed quite well.Burton deserves half the blame for not being able to say no to Carter the whining singer who could shatter glass; and Sondheim the other half for not standing his ground for first rate singers down the line.One day ten years from now, this movie needs to be remade with real singers for the entire cast.  That shall be a five star production.

On the one hand I want to reward the film high marks for its creative approach, imaginative sets and gothic flair. I'm also an admirer of Johnny Depp and his bizarre body of work so that would suggest a possible 4  or 5 star rating.However on the other hand, I'm not a fan of the new CGI techniques ala `Sin City' and `Beowulf' so that definitely was not a plus for me. The storyline and violent visuals were also a bit too graphic for my particular tastes and the main characters though well developed and expertly portrayed were not likeable thus making the establishment of a personal, emotional connection with their plight rather difficult.Furthermore, since this is a musical one's like, or dislike of the performance numbers must be taken into consideration as well. I found the music to be somewhat tedious for the most part, lacking any real memorable songs that one would care to listen to outside the confines of the film.`Sweeney Todd' is definitely one of those movies you either fall madly in love with, or don't ""get"" at all.

1133527,A15ENK5HYBO2YF,B001209SMS,"Bruce F. Webster ""geek in a suit""","[5, 6]","""Sweeney Todd"" has long been my favorite of Stephen Sondheim's works, even though I've never had the pleasure of seeing it live (I own the Broadway album and have watched the Broadway production DVD). Needless to say, I had some trepidation about this film project, since the trailers in advance of the film's release didn't make it clear how much singing would actually take place. I also had some concerns about length, since the stage production runs a bit long. For various reasons, I missed seeing the film in its theatrical release, but I picked up this special edition DVD last week when it came out.I've now watched/listened to the movie five times; I was absolutely delighted the first time through, and my appreciation for it grows each time. It's clear that Sondheim was closely involved in reshaping, and combining, cutting down, and eliminating musical numbers (and the text), and in some cases modifying the lyrics themselves -- and in my opinion, it's all for the better. The movie never lags, never drags -- once it starts, it moves quickly from point to point to its Greek tragedy conclusion. And of the eliminated numbers, the only one I really miss is ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" (which shows up instrumentally in a few spots).As for Tim Burton's direction and Johnny Depp's acting, they were both made for ""Sweeney Todd"". I am so used to Len Cariou's Todd from the Broadway album that I wasn't sure how Depp would bring the necessary gravitas -- vocal and acting -- to the role. But he pulls it off. His Demon Barber is more wraith-like, more detached, almost ghostly -- note his lack of response all through the 'By the Sea' number, not to mention ""Johanna"" -- but all the more chilling for that. The rest of the cast is great as well, and Depp and Helena Bonham Carter such a natural chemistry that I was surprised to learn they had never acted together before.My complaints are relatively minor and are endemic to ""Sweeney Todd"" itself. First, Helena Bonham Carter's character is, frankly, hard to understand at time, due to her thick accent and use of slang. Second, Sondheim likes to write fast, complicated, and overlapping lyrics, which sound wonderful when performed but can be a pain to decipher. (When I bought the Broadway album, one of the first things I tracked down was the ""Sweeney Todd"" libretto.) However, the DVD itself offers a wonderful solution: you can turn on English subtitles.I am listening to the movie even as I type this (""...'twas Pirelli's miracle elixir...""). My wife's been gone visiting family the past two weeks, and I do most of my work on my laptop sitting on a stool at the kitchen counter. I stick the DVD in to play and simply listen to the soundtrack, occasionally stopping to watch the film itself over my shoulder.As I said, a brilliant adaptation, brilliantly filmed.  ..bruce..",5,A brilliant adaptation brilliantly filmed,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,2842,"['Sweeney', 'Todd', 'long', 'been', 'favorite', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'works', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'live', 'own', 'Broadway', 'album', 'have', 'watched', 'Broadway', 'production', 'DVD', 'Needless', 'say', 'had', 'trepidation', 'film', 'project', 'trailers', 'advance', 'film', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'singing', 'would', 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'also', 'had', 'concerns', 'length', 'stage', 'production', 'bit', 'long', 'various', 'reasons', 'missed', 'seeing', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'picked', 'up', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'last', 'week', 'when', 'came', 'out.I', ""'ve"", 'now', 'watched/listened', 'movie', 'five', 'times', 'was', 'absolutely', 'delighted', 'first', 'time', 'appreciation', 'time', 'clear', 'Sondheim', 'was', 'closely', 'involved', 'reshaping', 'combining', 'cutting', 'down', 'eliminating', 'musical', 'numbers', 'text', 'cases', 'modifying', 'lyrics', 'opinion', 'better', 'movie', 'never', 'never', 'quickly', 'point', 'point', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'conclusion', 'eliminated', 'numbers', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'miss', 'Ballad', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'up', 'instrumentally', 'few', 'spots', '.As', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'direction', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'acting', 'were', 'made', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'am', 'so', 'used', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'Todd', 'Broadway', 'album', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'Depp', 'would', 'bring', 'necessary', 'gravitas', 'vocal', 'acting', 'role', 'off', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'more', 'wraith-like', 'more', 'detached', 'almost', 'ghostly', 'note', 'lack', 'response', ""'By"", 'Sea', 'number', 'not', 'mention', 'Johanna', 'more', 'chilling', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'together', 'before.My', 'complaints', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'are', 'endemic', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'First', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'character', 'frankly', 'hard', 'understand', 'time', 'due', 'thick', 'accent', 'use', 'slang', 'Second', 'Sondheim', 'write', 'fast', 'complicated', 'overlapping', 'lyrics', 'sound', 'wonderful', 'when', 'performed', 'can', 'be', 'pain', 'decipher', 'When', 'bought', 'Broadway', 'album', 'one', 'first', 'things', 'tracked', 'down', 'was', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'libretto', 'However', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'solution', 'can', 'turn', 'English', 'subtitles.I', 'am', 'listening', 'movie', 'even', 'type', ""'t"", 'was', 'Pirelli', 'miracle', 'elixir', 'wife', 'been', 'gone', 'visiting', 'family', 'past', 'two', 'weeks', 'do', 'most', 'work', 'laptop', 'sitting', 'stool', 'kitchen', 'counter', 'stick', 'DVD', 'play', 'simply', 'listen', 'soundtrack', 'occasionally', 'stopping', 'watch', 'film', 'shoulder.As', 'said', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'brilliantly', 'filmed', '..bruce..']",N/A

Johnny Depp along with some of the finest actors from the Harry Potter films:  Helena Bonham Carter, who is as wickedly amoral in Sweeney Todd as she was portraying Bellatrix LeStrange; Alan Rickman delivering his lines with that incredible timing I first became truly aware of in the Potter films, but showing a different dimension to his talents I truly enjoyed.  I have gained more and more respect for Rickman's talents as I have begun to explore his filmography.  Timothy Spall ... I apologize for seeing him as a ""toss-off"" in the Potter films; again, as I explore, I see what a talent this man has for the roles that no one but Timothy Spall could pull off so convincingly.Sweeney Todd is over the top.  The music is incredible, the story line is engrossing, and Stephen Sondheim is at the top of his form in this English Opera.HOWEVER, the compete bloodbath, squirting of blood everywhere, gallons of blood, was way beyond anything required for me to get the idea.  The director indulged in an orgy of bloodletting where a river would have been more than enough.  The bloodletting goes beyond anything needed to make the point and into some bizarre sexual release.I hope to see a better interpretation of this opera some day.  I would love to see the very same stars; Rickman, Carter, Spall and Depp, with a better director.

Personally, I found the music un-melodious, and the lyrics insufficiently poetic. Perhaps Sweeny Todd is an acquired taste. Perhaps if I watched it a few times, I'd like it more. But for me, the musicals I enjoy most are the ones that I love the first time around. For your derision :-) I will list my favorite musicals: ""Little Shop of Horrors"", ""Music Man"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and the delightful ""A Shoggoth on the Roof"" (which, so far as I know, only ever made it to audio form, from the HP Lovecraft Historical Society, and you kinda need to know about the Cthulhu Mythos to fully get it, but it's great). The trick with each one of these is that the very first time I watched them, I found the music beautiful. I listen to a lot of rock and metal, and it often strikes me as odd that a lot of my favorite songs took a couple of listens before I really loved them. But musical writers really don't have that luxury. They pretty much get one shot to make you love their stuff. And if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. For me, it just didn't happen this time. Having said this, I thought Depp brought terrific pathos to his role. I regret giving this movie a mere two stars, simply because I don't think it gives enough credit to his role.

Mom""","[2, 2]","Not to everyone's taste - especially if you are squeamish - is this  Grand Guignol song-story of revenge, murder and the worst meat-pies in London, splashed with blood the color of Chanel lipstick and dark humor. In fact the humor is pitch black, only slightly darker than grim and grimy London in some slightly pre-Victorian age. What Tim Burton has made of it may not be quite what this revengers' tragedy was on stage and at full length. But it is original and lives up to what we have come to expect of any collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp... even if (as has been noted in other reviews) a large portion of Stephen Sondheim's literate and witty lyrical numbers were sacrificed to the demands of a movie with a running time of about half the length of the full stage production.The plot is whisper-thin, an urban legend or a melancholy ballad about a young man who once had a happy home, with a beautiful wife and a baby daughter. But a wicked and corrupt judge sentences him on false charges to transportation to Australia, and when he returns fifteen years later, it appears that his wife is dead, and his daughter is the ward of the judge. Set on revenge, he sets up shop as a barber in his old home, upstairs from the cheerfully larcenous Mrs. Lovett. There is a small sub-plot, regarding his daughter Joanna, kept captive by the wicked judge - and a young sailor and shipboard comrade of Sweeney Todd's - but mostly it is about Sweeney Todd's implacable quest for vengeance. The bodies pile up through-out, dumped through a trapdoor into the cellar and efficiently transformed into meat pies by Mrs. Lovett... and there you have the most of it;  almost too Edward Gorey-comical  to be a horror movie,  but almost too gory to fit into the musical comedy bracket.

1133535,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001209SMS,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is as deliciously evil as a meat pie stuffed with human flesh, a macabre musical thriller that actually looks about as sinister and brooding as it feels. Director Tim Burton is definitely in his element, here, giving an even greater stylistic touch to a story that had plenty of style to begin with: he turns nineteenth-century London into a bleak landscape of shadow, filth, poverty, and cobblestone; he has everyone and everything existing in muted shades of gray, the gloomy monotony of which is occasionally broken by spurts of bright red blood; he once again relies on the talents of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, both of whom not only give excellent performances, but also prove that they have decent singing voices (although I must admit that Depp is better than Carter). This adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical play is both ghoulish and gleeful, a tragic story heightened with a few well-placed scatterings of dark humor.The story begins as Benjamin Barker (Depp) returns to London after a long imprisonment in Australia. He was once a happy man, a barber living with his wife, Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly), and newborn daughter, Johanna, in peace and contentment. Everything changed when the unscrupulous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and his pompous right hand man Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall) conjured up phony charges to have Barker arrested and sent to prison--Turpin grossly mistreated Lucy and ultimately raised Johanna as his ward. And since Lucy was driven to poisoning herself, Barker has absolutely no one to come home to. He's now consumed by hate, sorrow, and the need for vengeance against the Judge, feelings so intense that the man once known as Benjamin Barker no longer exists. Sweeney Todd is his name now.Upon returning to Fleet Street and his closed barbershop, he meets Mrs. Lovett (Carter), the talkative, dark-eyed owner of a shop specializing in meat pies. Times are hard for her because, by her own admission, she makes the worst pies in London; she gives Todd a disgusting lump of crust, inside of which is a putrid bit of meat that came from God knows where. Business for her rival--the unseen Mrs. Mooney--is booming while Mrs. Lovett's only customers have been the cockroaches infesting the shop. But when Todd enters her life, a dramatic reemergence is set into motion. How, exactly? Todd, you see, has become fatalistic and homicidal, using his precious silver-handled razors to slit the throats of every customer wanting a shave; this, in turn, benefits Mrs. Lovett, since dead bodies are an excellent source of meat for her pies. Needless to say, scores of hungry customers are soon gobbling up the most delicious pastries they've ever tasted.But Todd is far from satisfied because his real target is Judge Turpin, who's actively engaged in his own subplot. Locked within his home is Johanna (Jayne Wisener), who has since grown into a beautiful young woman ... so beautiful that Turpin no longer wants her as his ward, but as his wife. All that stands in his way is Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower), a young sailor who had already rescued Todd on a sea voyage. With a little help from Todd and Mrs. Lovett, he now hopes to rescue Johanna and marry her. Little does he know of what Todd has done and what he intends to do; revenge is a nasty business, too nasty for buried emotions to resurface. Simply put, Todd is no longer able to care about anyone or anything, least of all Mrs. Lovett, whose growing affection for him is becoming overbearing. All he has left is his hate, his razors, and a slew of throats to use them on.It's not surprising that it takes a lot of artistry to tell a story like this: Colleen Atwood's costumes are a combination of the delicate and the drab, and they capture the essence of what we imagine nineteenth century clothing to be; Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and Dante Ferretti's production designs turn London into a murky world of despair; Sondheim's underscore--clearly influenced by Bernard Hermann--is tense and dramatic. But Burton's artistry is by far the most important; his eccentric visuals haven't been this effective since 1999's ""Sleepy Hollow,"" another story that made use of bleak, gray landscapes.Sondheim fans will note that the film's soundtrack is a streamlined version of the Broadway original, the most prominent loss being ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd."" Burton fans will note that composer Danny Elfman is in no way involved with this film, Sondheim having written the original score as well as the song music. But when compared to the film's positive aspects, these are mere nitpickings. Take, for example, Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Adolfo Perilli, a phony, flashy Italian barber: he provides the story with its most blatant display of comedy, flaunting an ego even larger than London itself. Also consider Ed Sanders as Toby, a boy no older than eleven: starting out as Perilli's servant, he's taken in by Mrs. Lovett as her shop's newest worker. His affection for her is genuine, which, considering her feelings for Todd, is actually quite sad.But it's the film's visual and musical styles that work the best. ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is one of the best movie musicals ever made, a stylish, grim fable that begins and ends with blood. What a perfectly graphic framing device, especially since blood in a Tim Burton film is brighter and redder than anything reality has to offer. This film actually manages to indulge in blood without turning it into gore; what's normally a disgusting body fluid is now beautiful paint on a dim canvas of sickly gray skin. The customers featured in the Broadway musical sing, ""God, that's good!"" at the beginning of act two--those are pretty much my sentiments about this film adaptation.",5,"Shave and a Murder, Two

1133539,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001209SMS,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 1]","For me, I always feel Edward Scissorhands is Tim Burton's best film while a Nightmare Before Christmas is the best one he was attached to. But he's one of those kind of filmmakers that tends to flipflop between projects that show what he's capable of to films that are more or less visual eye-candy and little else. For every Big Fish there's a Planet of the Apes or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. His latest, Sweeney Todd, can very much be described as his best since Big Fish and while it's not for everyone, it's certainly showing a director who can deliver on the goods anytime he can.Benjamin Barker became the victim of Judge Turpin and sentenced away from London leaving Turpin with Barker's wife Lucy and daughter. 15 years later, now renamed himself Sweeney Todd and mind on revenge, he decides to go after Turpin with the help of Mrs. Lovett, a pie-owner known for ""the worst pies in London"". With Anthony the sailor in love with Todd's daughter Johanna, Todd goes after those who did him wrong but starting something can take you farther than you planned.Strangely, the only musicals that I can really stand are those from Disney. I love the songs and lyrics and don't find them distracting from the overall film but in live-action, there's that weird part of you that finds it odd characters would not only burst out in song during conversation but inexplicably, people around them will know the tempo, timing and the lyrics to join in. But with the theatricality of the story and the Broadway origins, I can forget it. The music, huge in bombast though some could find it ever-shifting and almost sloppy, helps bring out the story and adds to it rather than just being ""song time"". The 2 main actors don't have the most cleanest vocals but they're serviceable within the film.Burton's style, like David Fincher, is incredibly unique and it's easy to point out what he had a hand in and Sweeney Todd is almost an even drearier Sleepy Hollow...if that's possible. A greyish tint and low lighting is abundant in Sweeney Todd and while not the most shiniest film to test out your new system, it's quite attractive in its weird macabre way. The acting is quite spot-on as frequent Burton colloborator Johnny Depp goes for broke and probably gives his most twisted performance and there's even times where he's almost frightening. Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall and even Sasha Baron Cohen do good work though my one gripe is Helena Bonham Carter who's not as humorous as a role of hers kind of needed nor can she sing all that well (""Worst Pies in London"" kind of...hurts sometimes).With a musical genre, a dreary look and frequent gore spots, including a doozy with a stove, if you can handle it, Sweeney Todd is definately worth a look.",4,4.5; Burton's best in awhile,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,2746,"['always', 'feel', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'best', 'film', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'best', 'one', 'was', 'attached', 'one', 'kind', 'filmmakers', 'flipflop', 'projects', 'show', 'what', 'capable', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'visual', 'eye-candy', 'little', 'else', 'Big', 'Fish', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'latest', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'can', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'described', 'best', 'Big', 'Fish', 'not', 'everyone', 'certainly', 'showing', 'director', 'who', 'can', 'deliver', 'goods', 'anytime', 'Barker', 'became', 'victim', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'sentenced', 'away', 'London', 'leaving', 'Turpin', 'Barker', 'wife', 'Lucy', 'daughter', '15', 'years', 'later', 'now', 'renamed', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'mind', 'revenge', 'go', 'Turpin', 'help', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'pie-owner', 'known', 'worst', 'pies', 'London', 'Anthony', 'sailor', 'love', 'Todd', 'daughter', 'Johanna', 'Todd', 'who', 'did', 'wrong', 'starting', 'something', 'can', 'take', 'farther', 'planned.Strangely', 'only', 'musicals', 'can', 'really', 'stand', 'are', 'Disney', 'love', 'songs', 'lyrics', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'distracting', 'overall', 'film', 'live-action', 'weird', 'part', 'odd', 'characters', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'out', 'song', 'conversation', 'inexplicably', 'people', 'will', 'know', 'tempo', 'timing', 'lyrics', 'join', 'theatricality', 'story', 'Broadway', 'can', 'forget', 'music', 'huge', 'bombast', 'could', 'find', 'ever-shifting', 'almost', 'sloppy', 'bring', 'out', 'story', 'rather', 'just', 'being', 'song', 'time', '2', 'main', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'most', 'cleanest', 'vocals', ""'re"", 'serviceable', 'film.Burton', 'style', 'David', 'Fincher', 'incredibly', 'unique', 'easy', 'point', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'hand', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'almost', 'even', 'drearier', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'possible', 'greyish', 'tint', 'low', 'lighting', 'abundant', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'not', 'most', 'shiniest', 'film', 'test', 'out', 'new', 'system', 'quite', 'attractive', 'weird', 'macabre', 'way', 'acting', 'quite', 'spot-on', 'frequent', 'Burton', 'colloborator', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'broke', 'probably', 'most', 'twisted', 'performance', 'even', 'times', 'where', 'almost', 'frightening', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'even', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'one', 'gripe', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'not', 'as', 'humorous', 'role', 'hers', 'kind', 'needed', 'can', 'sing', 'well', 'Worst', 'Pies', 'London', 'kind', 'hurts', 'sometimes', 'musical', 'genre', 'dreary', 'look', 'frequent', 'gore', 'spots', 'including', 'doozy', 'stove', 'can', 'handle', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'definately', 'worth', 'look']",N/A

Look at you!No, we all deserve to die.Even you, Mrs Lovett, even I!""If you had any doubt, that's Sweeney Todd, and he puts his philosophy to work. Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, is Stephen Sondheim's re-telling of a barber driven mad. His wife and child were taken from him by a corrupt judge, who used and destroyed the wife and kept the child, who now is a young woman. Sweeney was transported, but he managed years later to return to London. While he plans his revenge on the judge he takes his revenge on humanity. He slits the throats of those he shaves. He's fortunate in meeting Mrs. Lovett, who makes a poor living making and selling awful meat pies, the main ingredient of which is pussycat. Now with Sweeney providing a constant source of fresh meat, her pies become best sellers. Sweeney finds his daughter, but retribution is inevitable. Now, twenty-eight years after Sweeney's Broadway debut, Tim Burton, with Sondheim's encouragement, has made a movie of the show.A tragedy of revenge, as some critics have said? I'm not so sure about that...there's too much lip-smacking by Burton and Sondheim, as well as by the audience (at least the audience I was a part of) over the gore. But Sweeney Todd certainly is tops as a superb example of an engrossing, cynically humorous, fast-paced, wonderfully acted piece of flinch-inducing Grand Guignol. I enjoyed every minute of it, even while I was squinting my eyes to avoid most of the neck slitting. Even as graphic as the slicing and blood spurting was, there was something so over the top about those scenes that perhaps I'm just a softy. (But note how Sondheim mixes together the beautiful song of longing, ""Johanna,"" with the impersonal series of throats being slit. It's startling to hear and see, and the beauty of the song nearly makes us complicit in Sweeney's on-camera blood-letting. On the stage it was even more riveting. It's a brilliant, lengthy set piece.)All the actors, I thought, did a fine job doing their own singing. Sondheim said recently in the NYTimes that he agreed completely with the decision to cast the actors first for their acting abilities and then for their singing skills, not the other way. Bonham Carter has taken some criticism, but I think she does a perfectly fine job. She has a light voice without much power behind it...but she certainly did an excellent job with her meat pies song and her by the sea song. Her characterization of the character was excellent, I thought. Fortunately, playing Mrs. Lovett isn't a zero sum gain; I think it's perfectly reasonable to enjoy what Bonham Carter does with the role while loving the ghastly comic turn Angela Lansbury gave Mrs. Lovett on stage. It would hard to think of better actors for doing such revolting jobs as degenerates than Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as the beadle. For me, where the movie starts to slacken a bit is toward the end, when Sondheim tries to bring a sense of real tragedy to the story. That has been a problem, as far as I'm concerned, with the stage production as well as the movie. Too obvious, too ""sincere"" for me. Still, without the final revelations there wouldn't be a story at all.I saw the stage show shortly after it opened on Broadway, then again when a touring company brought it to St. Louis. My reaction then was the same as with nearly all Sondheim shows I've seen...too mannered, too overly intellectual, too clever. Then I listen to the recordings of the songs from his shows and I change my mind. Burton's movie (over which Sondheim had control over how the songs would be presented and over any cuts) seems to me to have resulted in a much more affective presentation, due to the style, the cuts and the trims, than the stage show.And it seems to me that Johnny Depp has established himself as the most interesting and versatile American actor of his generation, probably the most talented, too. I cannot conceive of Di Caprio, Cruise, Pitt, etc., etc., being able to carry this part, much less even taking the chance and agreeing to play it.",5,"Grand guignol at its best...meaning razors, slit throats, dripping red stuff and enough black humor to fill a cemetery",1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,4340,"['deserve', 'die.Tell', 'why', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'tell', 'why.Because', 'whole', 'human', 'race', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'are', 'two', 'kinds', 'men', 'only', 'one', 'staying', 'put', 'proper', 'place', 'one', 'foot', 'other', 'one', 'face.Look', 'Mrs', 'Lovett', 'Look', 'No', 'deserve', 'die.Even', 'Mrs', 'Lovett', 'even', 'had', 'doubt', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'philosophy', 'work', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 're-telling', 'barber', 'driven', 'mad', 'wife', 'child', 'were', 'taken', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'who', 'used', 'destroyed', 'wife', 'kept', 'child', 'who', 'now', 'young', 'woman', 'Sweeney', 'was', 'transported', 'managed', 'years', 'later', 'return', 'London', 'revenge', 'judge', 'revenge', 'humanity', 'throats', 'fortunate', 'meeting', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'who', 'poor', 'living', 'making', 'selling', 'awful', 'meat', 'pies', 'main', 'ingredient', 'pussycat', 'Now', 'Sweeney', 'providing', 'constant', 'source', 'fresh', 'meat', 'pies', 'become', 'best', 'sellers', 'Sweeney', 'daughter', 'retribution', 'inevitable', 'Now', 'twenty-eight', 'years', 'Sweeney', 'Broadway', 'debut', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Sondheim', 'encouragement', 'made', 'movie', 'show.A', 'tragedy', 'revenge', 'critics', 'have', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'too', 'much', 'lip-smacking', 'Burton', 'Sondheim', 'as', 'well', 'audience', 'least', 'audience', 'was', 'part', 'gore', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'certainly', 'tops', 'superb', 'example', 'engrossing', 'cynically', 'humorous', 'fast-paced', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'piece', 'flinch-inducing', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'even', 'was', 'squinting', 'eyes', 'avoid', 'most', 'neck', 'slitting', 'Even', 'as', 'graphic', 'slicing', 'blood', 'spurting', 'was', 'was', 'something', 'so', 'top', 'scenes', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'just', 'softy', 'note', 'how', 'Sondheim', 'together', 'beautiful', 'song', 'longing', 'Johanna', 'impersonal', 'series', 'throats', 'being', 'slit', 'startling', 'hear', 'see', 'beauty', 'song', 'nearly', 'complicit', 'Sweeney', 'on-camera', 'blood-letting', 'stage', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'riveting', 'brilliant', 'lengthy', 'set', 'piece', 'actors', 'thought', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'doing', 'own', 'singing', 'Sondheim', 'said', 'recently', 'NYTimes', 'agreed', 'completely', 'decision', 'cast', 'actors', 'first', 'acting', 'abilities', 'then', 'singing', 'skills', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'taken', 'criticism', 'think', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'job', 'light', 'voice', 'much', 'power', 'certainly', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'meat', 'pies', 'song', 'her', 'sea', 'song', 'characterization', 'character', 'was', 'excellent', 'thought', 'Fortunately', 'playing', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', ""n't"", 'zero', 'sum', 'gain', 'think', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'enjoy', 'what', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'role', 'loving', 'ghastly', 'comic', 'turn', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'gave', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'stage', 'would', 'hard', 'think', 'better', 'actors', 'doing', 'such', 'revolting', 'jobs', 'degenerates', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'beadle', 'where', 'movie', 'slacken', 'bit', 'end', 'when', 'Sondheim', 'bring', 'sense', 'real', 'tragedy', 'story', 'been', 'problem', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'stage', 'production', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'Too', 'obvious', 'too', 'sincere', 'Still', 'final', 'revelations', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'story', 'all.I', 'saw', 'stage', 'show', 'shortly', 'opened', 'Broadway', 'then', 'again', 'when', 'touring', 'company', 'brought', 'St.', 'Louis', 'reaction', 'then', 'was', 'same', 'nearly', 'Sondheim', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'mannered', 'too', 'overly', 'intellectual', 'too', 'clever', 'Then', 'listen', 'recordings', 'songs', 'shows', 'change', 'mind', 'Burton', 'movie', 'Sondheim', 'had', 'control', 'how', 'songs', 'would', 'be', 'presented', 'cuts', 'have', 'resulted', 'much', 'more', 'affective', 'presentation', 'due', 'style', 'cuts', 'trims', 'stage', 'show.And', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'established', 'most', 'interesting', 'versatile', 'American', 'actor', 'generation', 'probably', 'most', 'talented', 'too', 'can', 'not', 'conceive', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'Cruise', 'Pitt', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'being', 'able', 'carry', 'part', 'much', 'less', 'even', 'taking', 'chance', 'agreeing', 'play']",N/A

That's certainly the case with Burton's filmed adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. The film is a dark, morbid, brutally violent revenge melodrama that follows the life of a wrongfully imprisoned man, as he seeks out the deaths of anyone whoever did him harm. Unsurprisingly Johnny Depp plays Sweeney Todd to perfection. With his maniacal stare, brooding demeanor, and haunting vocals, he shows that he can not only sing but also tread the line that separates horror from comedy. Helena Bonham Carter is also magnificent as the delightfully dreary Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a bakery where she makes gruesome meat pies (guess where she gets the meat from). The film also stars Alan Rickman as the sinister Judge Turpin, Timothy Spall as the demented Beadle Bramford, and the hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen as rival barber, Adolfo Pirelli. The entire cast is superb and part of what makes their performances so stunning is that none of them are professional singers. Though they might not possess the vocal talents that the cast of the stage musical had, they bring their own personalities and their own unique style to the songs, which have never sounded more contemporary.Benjamin Barker was a talented barber and a devoted husband, whose idyllic life was intruded upon by tragedy and conspiracy. He was accused of a crime that he did not commit and sent to prison for fifteen years. After being released he makes his way back to his London home, where he reestablishes his barbershop on Fleet Street, but he now goes by the name of Sweeney Todd. Sweeney discovers that his imprisonment was the result of the scheming Judge Turpin, who coveted Barker's wife and then raised his daughter, Johanna as his own. Sweeney craves the satisfaction of bloody revenge, so he forms an alliance with the deranged Mrs. Lovett. It is Mrs. Lovett who conceives of the plan of disposing the bodies of Sweeney's victims by putting them into meat pies. So while Sweeney reduces London's impoverished populace, Mrs. Lovett creates the worst pies in London. Soon the situation becomes sticky when a young sailor falls in love with Johanna, earning the wrath of Judge Turpin and his toady, Beadle Bramford. And things only worsen when Adolfo Pirelli, a mountebank barber, discovers Todd's identity, which forces Todd to kill him in a particularly grotesque manner. As the bodies pile up and Todd descends into a self-destructive cycle of revenge, fortuitous circumstances lead him to make decisions that horrifically alter the lives of all involved.The screenplay by John Logan is based upon Stephen Sondheim's musical, but he also makes sly references to English folklore and gothic horror stories. The film's greatest strengths are the quality of the acting combined with Sondheim's brilliant music. However the film is flawed in its execution. Quite often there's too much focus on throat slitting, which quickly becomes monotonous, as well as nauseating for squeamish viewers. Personally, the bloodletting itself didn't bother me so much as the repetitive nature of it. It's unfortunate that Tim Burton couldn't have found a way to show the killings in a more creative slapstick style. The film's look is priceless due to the immaculately created sets, costumes, and props, which plunge viewers into the seedy underworld of London in the 19th Century.All in all, Sweeney Todd is a macabre masterpiece, a musical/dark comedy/horror hybrid that will either become reviled or beloved in time.Also recommended:The Rocky Horror Picture Show / Shock TreatmentEdward ScissorhandsEd WoodThe Nightmare Before ChristmasSleepy HollowFrom HellThe Phantom of the OperaCorpse BrideSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street: The Motion Picture SoundtrackSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Streetby Mark Salisbury",4,The Worst Pies in London,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,4060,"['WARNING', 'film', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'violence.Whenever', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'wife', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'close', 'friend', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'film', 'stars', 'result', 'typically', 'bloody', 'brilliant', 'certainly', 'case', 'Burton', 'filmed', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'musical', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'film', 'dark', 'morbid', 'brutally', 'violent', 'revenge', 'melodrama', 'life', 'wrongfully', 'imprisoned', 'man', 'out', 'deaths', 'anyone', 'did', 'harm', 'Unsurprisingly', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'perfection', 'maniacal', 'stare', 'brooding', 'demeanor', 'haunting', 'vocals', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'sing', 'also', 'tread', 'line', 'horror', 'comedy', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'also', 'magnificent', 'delightfully', 'dreary', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'owner', 'bakery', 'where', 'gruesome', 'meat', 'pies', 'guess', 'where', 'meat', 'film', 'also', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'sinister', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'demented', 'Beadle', 'Bramford', 'hilarious', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'rival', 'barber', 'Adolfo', 'Pirelli', 'entire', 'cast', 'superb', 'part', 'what', 'performances', 'so', 'stunning', 'none', 'are', 'professional', 'singers', 'might', 'not', 'possess', 'vocal', 'talents', 'cast', 'stage', 'musical', 'had', 'bring', 'own', 'personalities', 'own', 'unique', 'style', 'songs', 'have', 'never', 'sounded', 'more', 'contemporary.Benjamin', 'Barker', 'was', 'talented', 'barber', 'devoted', 'husband', 'idyllic', 'life', 'was', 'intruded', 'tragedy', 'conspiracy', 'was', 'accused', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'sent', 'prison', 'fifteen', 'years', 'being', 'released', 'way', 'back', 'London', 'home', 'where', 'barbershop', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'now', 'name', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Sweeney', 'imprisonment', 'was', 'result', 'scheming', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'who', 'coveted', 'Barker', 'wife', 'then', 'raised', 'daughter', 'Johanna', 'own', 'Sweeney', 'satisfaction', 'bloody', 'revenge', 'alliance', 'deranged', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'who', 'plan', 'disposing', 'bodies', 'Sweeney', 'victims', 'putting', 'meat', 'pies', 'So', 'Sweeney', 'London', 'impoverished', 'populace', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'worst', 'pies', 'London', 'Soon', 'situation', 'sticky', 'when', 'young', 'sailor', 'love', 'Johanna', 'earning', 'wrath', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'toady', 'Beadle', 'Bramford', 'things', 'only', 'worsen', 'when', 'Adolfo', 'Pirelli', 'mountebank', 'barber', 'Todd', 'identity', 'Todd', 'kill', 'particularly', 'grotesque', 'manner', 'bodies', 'pile', 'up', 'Todd', 'self-destructive', 'cycle', 'revenge', 'fortuitous', 'circumstances', 'lead', 'make', 'decisions', 'horrifically', 'alter', 'lives', 'involved.The', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Logan', 'based', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'musical', 'also', 'sly', 'references', 'English', 'folklore', 'gothic', 'horror', 'stories', 'film', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'are', 'quality', 'acting', 'combined', 'Sondheim', 'brilliant', 'music', 'However', 'film', 'flawed', 'execution', 'Quite', 'often', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'throat', 'slitting', 'quickly', 'monotonous', 'as', 'well', 'nauseating', 'squeamish', 'viewers', 'Personally', 'bloodletting', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'so', 'much', 'repetitive', 'nature', 'unfortunate', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'way', 'show', 'killings', 'more', 'creative', 'slapstick', 'style', 'film', 'look', 'priceless', 'due', 'immaculately', 'created', 'sets', 'costumes', 'props', 'plunge', 'viewers', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'London', '19th', 'Century.All', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'macabre', 'masterpiece', 'musical/dark', 'comedy/horror', 'hybrid', 'will', 'either', 'become', 'reviled', 'beloved', 'time.Also', 'recommended', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', '/', 'Shock', 'TreatmentEdward', 'ScissorhandsEd', 'WoodThe', 'Nightmare', 'ChristmasSleepy', 'HollowFrom', 'HellThe', 'Phantom', 'OperaCorpse', 'BrideSweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'SoundtrackSweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Streetby', 'Mark', 'Salisbury']",N/A

However, at least half of that is half spoken-half sung so it isn't really operatic.Burton displays his usual dark visions and wonderful cinematography and Depp plays his normal strange, dark character. I can't say that all the singing appealed to me, but the actors did a credible job with it. In fact, Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and company surprised me how well they all sang considering they aren't known for that talent.One other major warning: some of the bloody scenes are pretty graphic. There will be a number of people who will turn their heads at a few scenes. That doesn't start for awhile, however, as the first third of film sets up the premise.What I found most appealing was the comedy. The wildest character was ""Signor Adolfo Pirelli,"" a guy pretending to be a famous Italian barber and played - incredibly - by Sacha Baron Cohen....yes, ""Borat,"" himself! I only wish his role had been a little bigger. The other guy who made me laugh was Timothy Spall as ""Beadle Bamford."" He was so bad, he was good! Some of the lyrics in the songs also were humorous. All the comedy is a mixture of dark and light stuff.It seems like most of the scenes in this film were either very dark and foreboding or filled with outrageous dark humor. There wasn't much middle ground. I suspect you'll either stick with the film and enjoy it or be tempted to toss it in the garbage can before it's over.

What suprised me even more was that I'm not even a fan of Burton's films. Here Johnny Depp and Tim Burton join forces again to bring this musical thriller alive and in the process Depp give one of his finest performances to date as the evil barber Sweeney Todd a wronged man whose lust for revenge drives him to murder.I was attracted to it's dark but beautiful story about the return of a barber who wants revenge upon someone, in fact this in my opinion is probaly Depp's best film and character he's ever done before. The gory throat cutting scenes were all suitable and made the movie even darker. The actors all managed to sing their parts beautifully and efficently which made the film even better.

If anyone had any doubts about Depps vocal range or ability to carry a tune, by the end of the first verse of the openning song those doubts were no more.

Although, they must've been reassured that Tim Burton would be helming the project with his long-time collaborator Johnny Depp stepping in to play Todd. Burton, with his affinity for all things dark and gothic (seeThe Nightmare Before Christmas (Special Edition)andTim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition)), seems like an obvious choice to take on such dark subject matter and Sondheim agreed, giving the filmmaker his blessing.The first disc has a featurette entitled, ""Burton + Depp + Carter = Todd."" Tim Burton had always been a fan of Stephen Sondheim's musical and had contemplated a film version for years. Helena Bonham Carter was also a fan and had always wanted to play Mrs. Lovett. Burton liked the idea of her and Depp as this ""weird"" couple. The director and his leading man talk about their long-standing relationship in this excellent featurette.The second disc starts off with the ""Sweeney Todd Press Conference, November 2007"" which features Burton, producer Richard Zanuck and his main cast answering questions from the press. Not surprisingly, Burton and Depp tend to dominate the bulk of the questions. Both men are very charming and joke good naturedly with each other.""Musical Mayhem: Sondheim's Sweeney Todd"" features Sondheim talking about the origins of his take on Sweeney Todd and what drew him to the story. He also talks about how he adapted it into a musical and speaks eloquently about the story and the predominant theme of revenge.""Sweeney's London"" provides historical background to 18th and 19th century London including the social and economical conditions with historians talking about how harsh life was back then. This is fascinating stuff and excellent insight the world that acts as a backdrop to the story.""The Making of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" takes a look at how the film came together. This is a pretty standard promotional featurette that mixes cast and crew soundbites with clips from the film. It covers a lot of ground already depicted in other featurettes.""Grand Guignol: A Theatrical Tradition"" examines the tradition of Grand Guignol or horror theatre that came out of France. Academic types trace its origins, define its characteristics, and illustrate how Sweeney Todd fits into this tradition.""Designs for a Demon Barber"" takes a look at the costumes and set design. Burton wanted the film to look likeFrankenstein (75th Anniversary Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)and resemble a kind of fable look. He explains that this is why he used sets on soundstages as opposed to actual locations.""A Bloody Business"" examines how they did the film's bloody deaths. We see Burton and his crew running tests on how to get the right bloody sprays and experiment with how to pull of the throat slashings.""Moviefone Unscripted with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp"" features the two men asking each other questions submitted by fans.

But only a small one.Having seen this sanguine production on stage, off Broadway, I can tell you, it never reached its full potential until it finally made it to film. Sweeney Todd, the motion picture, has great music, great sets, great performances, but a thin plot hampered by film's limitations when it comes to its powerful, abrupt ending. Only in its conclusion is Sweeney Todd better on stage, simply because on stage the ""killing"" of the lights and the fall of the curtain made for a more dramatic exit around the kneeling form of Todd than a screen simply fading to black. In Burton's hands I also found Todd more villainous than anti-heroic, and I'm not sure I liked it better that way. Johnny Depp, though, was wonderful, as he always is, as were Sacra Baron Cohen, Alan Rickman, and Helena Bonham Carter. Also, as imagined in Tim Burton's gloriously dark mind, the twisted alleyways of London have never looked so brooding, so filthy, so pregnant with violent menace. The only thing missing was a score by Burton's de rigueur partner in crime, Danny Elfman, but of course I understand his absence full well.

In that respect, Sondheim's brooding opera (let's call it what it is) is an amazing piece of work.As a stage production, it is much longer, of course, and many have been unhappy about the editing necessary to make a watchable film (opera on film almost always has to be be edited down), but if anything, it made an improvement.  My husband, for instance, found the stage version tedious, but he loved the format of the film.  And in many ways, that is how I measured this film. The level of intensity achieves what is not truly possible in a stylized and lengthy stage play.  It is tighter and more intense, and makes for a very gripping story.Burton, with Sondheim's approval, gave it the look and feel of a Universal monster classic, with blood added.  Karloff and Lugosi would have been at home here, as well as Lon ""Phantom of the Opera"" Chaney and Elsa Lancaster. Visually, it is dark, brooding, mostly filmed in accromatics, with creepy skylines, filthy streets and buildings, perpetual night time thunderbolts, and so many shadows that it seems the sun will never shine again.  Sondheim's music is masterfully served by such visuals.There have been a lot of films of this infamous urban legend. most of them portraying Todd as variously wicked, thieving serial killer of Victorian melodrama, or even a sad, schizophrenic who only imagines his crimes.  In the Sondheim play, Todd became much more sympathetic, if also a madman.  Under the hands of Burton and Depp, Todd is certainly sympathetic, but he is also incredibly menacing.  You understand him, but you also fear him.  Originally simply obcessed with killing the evil judge (along with his henchman, the Beadle) over grievous wrongs done to him and his unfortunate family, Todd's rage allows him to progress into total psychosis where he is willing to kill anyone who might fall into his hands, and he passes into the realm of a true monster, however sympathetic he may be.This is a remarkable film, and well worth watching.

1133555,AQLPABVVH2WF7,B001209SMS,Daniel S Tommie,"[1, 1]","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a 2007 film adaptation of the musical, directed by Tim Burton, staring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. And I just watched it. The film follows Sweeney Todd (Depp) as he goes on a vengeance fueled murder spree through old timey London. Mrs Lovett (Carter) helps the old boy out by making meat pies out of his victims. I thought it was OK but not great.I found maybe the thing I appreciated the least in this film was Tim Burton. Tim Burton has a signature look and style which bleeds into everything he touches. It's a little bit like Midas' golden touch, except when he touches things everything good and alive kind of melts away and falls off. Like the extremities of a leper. Tim Burton would probably love that analogy. He's probably the only professional goth. And I don't mean the only goth who has a career. He's probably the only person who has made a career out of wearing black and hanging out in dark rooms whining about things. I may be coming down on Tim Burton pretty hard, unfairly even, but I get really tired of him sometimes. This is one of those times.Sometimes it seems maybe Tim Burton is in a good mood when he makes a movie. You can tell because it has a color palate. Those films often come across as fantastical, and beautiful. He can convey moodiness without the need to suck the light out of scenes. Sweeney Todd is not one of those movies. With the exception of a couple notable scenes the movie is dark and dreary. I know this is what he was aiming for, but I feel he could have accomplished it with more than just the occasional splash of red. Schindler's List feels more colorful and full of life.If you can get past that, the movie starts to become a bit more enjoyable. If a movie like this can really be called ""enjoyable"". I like the musical numbers in this, in fact the music might be this movies strong suit. Which is really probably what you want from a musical. Depp apparently took singing lessons for this role, and while I wouldn't say he's any kind of virtuoso, his oft harsh delivery of song seems appropriate for the dark character.Dark is a pretty pervasive theme. This is a dark movie. Very dark. Todd starts on a mission of bloody vengeance, but it's not long before he's just killing people because he's plain crazy. Lovett's no saint either. She's really more akin to the devil on his shoulder. And also the angel. Every moral compass is crooked, except for maybe Toby Ragg the urchin boy, who ends the piece as our hero. Anyhow, Todd starts killing people just cause it's what he's into nowadays. This was really when the movie lost me. I was on board for a revenge story. Less so for people getting their throats cut just because Todd is mad at the world for the injustices he's faced and then baked into meat pies.About those meat pies. This is a small issue, but it still kind of stuck out for me. When we first meet Mrs Lovett there is literally a song and dance about how her meat pies are absolutely revolting. That's probably a lyric. Lot's of things rhyme with revoltin', especially in a cute brit accent. But once she starts stuffing flaky crusts with man meat, they are amazing and start flying off the shelves. I get that there is literally a secret ingredient, I just don't get how she knows how to make soylent green taste great when she couldn't make a passable product before taking a page from To Serve Man.I felt that the parts were well acted all around. Depp was expectantly good, even though I do tire of seeing him being pale and moody in Tim Burton movies. I really enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen in his small, but memorable, role. Every time I see him I think he's going to find a role that he really explodes in someday, as he always seems to disappear in whatever character he plays. Helena Bonham Carter fit perfectly into her role, as well. Oddly enough her reappearance in Burton movies doesn't irk me. Alan Rickman was of course great, but it is really Rickman doing Rickman. Nothing wrong with it, but he's not stretching. Hans Gruber is the Sheriff is the Metatron is Snape.One small aspect I found interesting is the blood. Oh yes, there is copious amounts of blood. The color of it intrigued me. It's so very red. It's theater blood. I have to assume this was a decision to give a nod to it's theater roots. Little things like that do a lot for me. Like how I suspect Todd knew Toby was behind him and made his throat an easy target. It's subtle, but it's there.I know it seems I've been pretty negative about the movie. I don't really mean to be. The movie is enjoyable, just not phenomenal. There were some changes that I would have liked to see have been made which I would have preferred, but that's just me. I know a lot of people really love what Tim Burton does. I'm just not one of them. Don't get me wrong, he's made a couple films I thoroughly love. But he also made Planet of the Apes, the Aperaham Lincoln edition, and Willy Wonka. This film is somewhere in the middle of those extremes.3 out of 5 slit throats",3,A late to the party movie review,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,5056,"['Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet',

While waiting for his big chance, he slaughters scores of customers, who are then recycled into meat pies served by Todd's accomplice and would-be lover, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter).Once again, director Tim Burton has found a fitting subject for his unique sensibility.  His London is a dark, creepy warren of twisting back alleys and dank sewers.  He does not compromise the basic savagery of this story, presenting a musical that features more blood than most slasher films.  The reprehensible nature most of the characters is not prettied up for the screen; each of them is taken to their logical extreme and meets a richly deserved fate.  I haven't seen the show as presented on stage, so I can't comment on how it compares to this compressed version, but I found the film to be quite satisfying in its own right (with the exception of one ""surprise"" that I saw coming from a mile away).

To me, the whole purpose of a movie being transferred to blu-ray is to make the picture and sound as good as it can possibly be, with the current technology. Sadly, there are more than a few studios who don't seem to think so.The picture on this release should be an embarrassment to Dreamworks. While it is very detailed and sharp in some scenes, for the majority of the film, there is so much grain and digital artifacts it is ridiculous. It is mind-boggling how picture quality can vary so drastically from scene to scene on a digital disc! With most blu rays the picture tends to suffer in brighter scenes. This one is the complete opposite - any moderately dark scene (which is 90 percent of this movie) looks so grainy, and speckled you'll swear you are watching a videotape. Honestly, do some studios have an automatic mastering program that does this without a human technician to make corrections? I have to wonder how some of these transfers go out the door looking like this. I compared several scenes on blu-ray first, and then on the dvd using the same playstation 3,  with the most recent firmware, on a full 1080p HDTV with v1.4HDMI cables. In all instances, the DVD actually looked better.The one thing I can say about this release is that the sound is excellent! One of the better audio tracks I have heard - the DVD doesn't even come close to the blu-ray in that aspect.This was a HUGE dissapointment to me, as this is one of my favorite films of recent years - I expected better for my money. Dreamworks Blu-Ray division owes Tim Burton an apology. If you are a fan, and can find this for $10 or less, buy it just for the audio and extras.

And lots of razors -- ""at last, my arm is complete again!"" Sweeney Todd exults.Somehow it doesn't come as a shock to me that Tim Burton adapted Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" -- or that he somehow spun it into something so delicious. That dark, grotesque, hilariously melodramatic story is perfectly suited to Burton's style, and Johnny Depp is absolutely stunning as the titular bloody barber.The malignant Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) lusts after the wife of Benjamin Barker (Depp), so he convicts Barker of a crime he didn't commit, and enfolds his family into his evil hands.But fifteen years later, the Barker returns to London and sets up a barber shop over Mrs. Lovett's ghastly meat pie store. Of course, he's enraged when he learns that his wife was raped and since poisoned herself, and that his daughter is the ward of the lecherous Judge. Enraged and maddened, Barker renames himself ""Sweeney Todd"" and vows revenge.And he finds that he LOVES using his razors for a far bloodier task than shaving. With the help of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) -- who finds a thrifty use for those bodies -- Todd cuts a bloody swathe through all who have wronged him. And when his daughter is punished for refusing to marry the cruel Judge, Sweeney closes in to get his revenge at last.There's always been a gothic look to Burton's movies, and he's always dabbled in very twisted, macabre storylines. And he really tops himself with ""Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" -- London is painted in black, white and grey, right down to the ghoulish faces of the characters, and their bleak little dens of horror. And songs -- lots of magnificently horrible songs.But Burton pretty obviously adores the combination of gory grotesquerie and very, very sick humour (""They don't commit sins of the flesh, so it's pretty fresh""). And he doesn't try to make Sweeney or Mrs. Lovett palatable, thankfully. While we sympathize with Sweeney's losses, and the horrors that have changed him into the Demon Barber, you just can't pass over scenes where they sing, ""It's man devouring man, my dear!"" ""Then who are we to deny it in here?""There are some moments that relieve this gory gothic parade -- there's a sweet love story between Sweeney's daughter and a young sailor. And the plot becomes progressively darker toward the end (yes, it CAN get worse), when the plot throws us some shocking new twists, resulting in a Grecian-tragedy finale soaked in even more gore.Oh yes, there's blood. Tons of it. It spurts like Monty Python's bloodier sketches, which ends up being more hilarious than yucky -- as is the casual introduction of cannibal meat pies. And there are some spectacularly gross moments, like a finger found in one of the pies.Burton uses some of his favorite actors in this one, particularly Depp and Bonham-Carter. Depp is THE perfect ideal Sweeney Todd -- his creepy eyes, pallid face and still, almost seductive manner are perfect for the maddened murderous barber. He goes through the movie slashing his razors at the world, and injects a real creepiness into scenes like Sweeney cooing at his ""friends.""While she's only a passable singer, Bonham-Carter is eerily wholehearted as Todd's equally amoral partner-in-crime, who is quite happy to assist him.... and make tastier pies in the process. Rickman is wonderfully loathsome as the Judge, and Sacha Baron Cohen has a small but priceless role as Pirello, a huckster acquaintance of Todd's who starts causing trouble. He really steals his scenes.Most directors would have prettified, sanitized and defanged the grotesque ""Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" but Tim Burton and Johnny Depp revel in the gore and madness.

Revenge movies and stories are popular because they are so simple and viscerally powerful: who couldn't identify with a long-suffering protagonist who's been wrongfully victimized and is out for some payback?  There are few human reflexes as powerful and universal as ""an eye for an eye"" or, in this post-9/11 age, ""a dozen eyes for an eye.""And yet, this movie manages to do it.  Sure, the visuals are flawless being a Tim Burton film, and the two leads (Johnny Depp and the always-fabulous Helena Bonham Carter) are flawless as well---but this movie just drags along, inevitably I suppose since it's a musical which is a lousy format for an action-based revenge flick, and the climax is downright anti-climactical, while the ending is abrupt and equally unsatisfying.  The violence and blood are somehow stripped of any FUN---it happens way too fast too often, without much buildup, no primal glee or flourish, but is rather clinical and cursory instead.  Generally, the plot relies far too much on improbable coincidences and fortuitous and unfortuitous events---nobody really DOES anything except the villain, and even he is luck-driven half the time.Tarantino's first film, ""Reservoir Dogs"" was criticized by some for being an exercise in pointless violence because all the principal characters perished at the end, but it managed to grab the viewer by the throat from the beginning and never let go until the final credits.  Instead, ""Sweeny Todd"" is the kind of movie that makes you want to continually get up and go to the bathroom or the refrigerator because it's so damn slow and the musical format is hideously inefficient at developing characters or present plot twists, while musically being too mediocre to make you NOT care about its slowness.I suppose this film MIGHT be somewhat forgiven if you could convince me that Tim Burton deliberately set out to create an anti-revenge revenge movie that is INTENDED to be unsatisfying, as a moral point or commentary of some sort.  Maybe there is some sort of ""cumbiyah"" hidden in the subtext, the usual pious pronouncements that ""an eye for an eye makes the world go blind"" or ""hate destroys both the hated and and the hater,"" or (remember your elementary school teacher?)

1133574,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001209SMS,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 8]","It's been nearly thirty years since a Stephen Sondheim musical has been translated from Broadway to the big screen (the last time was 1978's dismalA Little Night Musicstarring Elizabeth Taylor), and judging from the previews of this dark 2007 musical, the producers don't seem very anxious to publicize the fact that most of this film is sung in verse. That's too bad because it's really Sondheim's evocative and powerfully haunting music that drives and ironically humanizes the chilling storyline. It also helps to have director Tim Burton's visionary talent guiding this audacious venture since the horrific and heartrending subject matter ideally suits his idiosyncratic filmmaking style. I was fortunate enough to see the original1979 Broadway productionwith Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury, and screenwriter John Logan does an admirable job of streamlining the original musical to the core story of Sweeney's relentless vengeance.Sondheim-loving purists may balk at the fact that certain characters are gone in the screen version, as well as several songs with some of the remaining score switched around from one character's voice to another to serve distinctly different purposes in the story. It's also true that Burton does not hold back on what is an uncompromising gore-fest, but luckily, he doesn't dwell on the barber's bloody acts. Instead, he fixates on establishing the moody, nearly colorless atmosphere of nineteenth-century London and how the key characters become entrenched in the pervasive grayness of an urban purgatory from which no one can escape. All the production values on display are top-notch with stellar work from cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (all threePirates of the Caribbeanfilms), production designer Dante Ferretti (Gangs of New York) and costume designer Colleen Atwood (Memoirs of a Geisha). The technical virtues of this production are undeniable even if it does become somewhat wearing to experience the constant dankness.Burton did not venture far in casting the leads with his frequent leading man Johnny Depp in the title role and the director's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter as the smitten Mrs. Lovett. Both make their roles work within the contours of their recognizable screen personas. Depp lends his almost feline-like brand of menace to a role more often played by more robust, operatic-style actor-singers a decade or so older, while Carter eschews Lansbury's comically buffoonish performance for a more sinewy, cynical approach. Their singing may lack range and nuance, prerequisites for mastering Sondheim's complex lyrics, but they perform with vigor and certainly within character. Alan Rickman is his usual villainous self as Judge Turpin, whose act of jealousy provides the impetus for the blood-soaked plot; and in genuine callow fashion, Jamie Campbell Bower plays the aptly named sailor, Anthony Hope, the devoted suitor of Johanna, Sweeney's long-lost daughter now Turpin's ward. Orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick, the soundtrack does not suffer for the marginality of the star voices, as he brings the full potency and epic grandeur of Sondheim's music to the fore.Several of the musical numbers are quite effective. There is ""Pirelli's Miracle Elixir"", which introduces Sweeney's preening competitor, Adolfo Pirelli (a nice bravura turn by Borat himself, Sacha Baron Cohen), at a medicine sideshow accompanied by a gin-loving orphan named Toby (affectingly played by Ed Sanders), who becomes intractably involved with Sweeney's and Mrs. Lovett's affairs. Bower sings the ballad, ""Johanna"", with proper yearning as the purity of his intentions is contrasted sharply with Sweeney's murderous deeds. Depp gets his moment in the sun with ""Epiphany"", in which he spells out the inevitably tragic fate of London under his switchblade, and he duets with a tentative Rickman on the haunting ""Pretty Women"". My favorite ballad from the show, ""Not While I'm Around"", has been turned into a lullaby Mrs. Lovett sings to Toby, and while Carter sings with conviction, she is actually at her best on the lighter numbers like the self-effacing ""The Worst Pies in London"", the deceptively coy ""A Little Priest"", and the sunny ""By the Sea"", which cues the film's only splash of life-affirming color.

1133575,A3A8P8IBH7L1WW,B001209SMS,Edward,"[12, 15]","It's been more than a quarter of a century since Stephen Sondheim's musical thriller ""Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" opened on Broadway, and finally it has been brought to the big screen by Tim Burton, whose morbid wit has devised such movies as ""Ed Wood"". Based on a horror story from Victorian England, the legend of Sweeney Todd was filmed as a non-musical in 1936, starring the appropriately named Tod Slaughter. The psychopathic barber is played this time by Burton's frequent collaborator Johnny Depp. Sondheim himself is barely mentioned by Marketing; and his score, not unexpectedly, has been diminished, which causes disappointments. All the connecting choruses are gone (so Sweeney doesn't make that hair-raising first entrance he did on stage), and the brilliant ensemble number ""God, That's Good!"" is so abridged it's pointless. It's not just the cuts: the special effects (including Sweeney's graphic ""executions"" and the dark-as-Dickens London) nearly overshadow the score. I was apprehensive when I read of Depp's casting in the title role, but he's a revelation. With his sunken eyes and his traumatic m&egrave;che, not to mention a strong if somewhat anachronistic pop tenor, he gives his maniac a presence of homicidal fury. Less successful is Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs Lovett. Perhaps she meant to reveal the character's cold amorality, but she's a cipher on the screen. Her ""The Worst Pies in London"", which should have been hilarious, is flat. Plus she seems too young. It's never mentioned, but the implication is Mrs Lovett is older than Sweeney. If Burton had asked my opinion (alas! he didn't) I would have suggested Meryl Streep as an interesting Mrs Lovett. Depp gets his strongest support from Alan Rickman, a really vicious Judge Turpin, and Ed Sanders, whose treble interpretaion of ""Not While I'm Around"" is a highlight.

Simply put, ""Sweeny Todd"" is a great story in every sense of the word. It has it all: comedy, tragedy, romance, cannibalism. What more do you need? Visually it is a gem, from the river of blood that opens it to the scenes that vary between the streets of London and the cramped spaces of the homes and pie shops.

What I love about this film is the fact that it so perfectly captures the original musical. That is due in large part to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp - these 2 are the reason the movie was a total success. Other good things: the costumes were stunning, the cinematography was just haunting, and the actors, were in large part, wonderful. I was incredibly suprised by Sacha Benton Cohen, who, I was convinced, would destroy the part, but I loved him in it. Alan Rickman is a god, as always. Whether playing Snape, the Judge, or the Colonel Brandon, he's incredible.The  2 weak links in this film were Helena Bodham Carter as Mrs. Lovett and the boy (I don't know his name) who played Anthony. Let's be real. She got the part because Tim Burton's her hubby/live-in lover. She LOOKS great in the part of Mrs. Lovett, but she can't sing worth two hoots. Seriously. Can't sing a note. As for the boy who played Anthony, he was a bit too wussy for my taste - especially a kid who was a sailor.Another observation: Although this should be fairly explanatory given teh subject matter, please, please do not let your children see this movie.

Bottom line, this is one excellent all around modern-day musical. Not one bad link or singer in the bunch, Johnny Depp pulls another one out of Tim Burton's hat with this. Based on the classic tale and the modern Broadway musical, I was really taken by everyone involved. Helena Bonham Carter was a gimme in the vocal talent department, but who knew Depp would be that able to carry a tune, not to mention Sacha Baron Cohen (yeah, yeah ""Borat""...let it go people...) matching his vocals as well. Each song dripped dark emotions and even though it too was very violent, as the story usually goes, that part of it didn't seem to overshadow the incredible songs and acting. However, it did seem to make my eyebrow raise to hear one of it's more memorable songs (forgive me as I don't currently know it's title) sounded very very similar in structure and tempo to, believe it or not, another classic musical tune ""I Want It Now"" as sung by character Veruca Salt in 1971's Willy Wonka (I bet you'll hear it next time you view it now).

Tim Burton's film, by contrast, is positively (perhaps needlessly?) maximalist: the grime is grimiest, the blood is bloodiest, the squalor is, um, squalidest. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expert Tim Burton to do with Sweeney Todd: cast Johnny Depp in the lead (as usual), alongside his muse/girlfriend Helena Bonham-Carter (as usual), Alan Rickman as the dour British guy (his usual role), Timothy Spall as the smarmy British sycophant (having, in 2007 alone, tackled that role in Harry Potter 5 and again as Fagin in a BBC adaptation of Oliver Twist)... and then slap the usual coat of Tim Burton patina (squiggly black curlicue hair, desaturated tones) over the source material, adding little and illuminating less.What strengths exist in the film-- and there are many-- are doubly strong, however, on Broadway: the counterpoint and consummate Britishness of the songs, the suspense of the murders, and ultimately the themes (primarily the central counterpoint of protagonist and villain, the barber versus the judge, the lowly versus the powerful). Depp does his best Bowie impression on the musical numbers and the cast sings surprisingly well (perhaps with the aid of digital correction?), but there's no remotely essential, let alone breakthrough, performance...A decent film with some flashes of inspiration in the imagery, but overall a perfunctory and forgettable adaptation.",3,"Good, just not compared to Broadway",1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,1587,"['Spoiler-free', 'impressions', 'hard', 'judge', 'one', 'film', 'having', 'recently', 'seen', 'John', 'Doyle', 'award-winning', 'production', 'Broadway', 'featuring', 'stripped-down', 'cast', 'minimalist', 'set', 'design', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'contrast', 'positively', 'perhaps', 'needlessly', 'maximalist', 'grime', 'grimiest', 'blood', 'bloodiest', 'squalor', 'um', 'squalidest', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expert', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'do', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'cast', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'lead', 'usual', 'muse/girlfriend', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'usual', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'dour', 'British', 'guy', 'usual', 'role', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'smarmy', 'British', 'sycophant', 'having', '2007', 'alone', 'tackled', 'role', 'Harry', 'Potter', '5', 'again', 'Fagin', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'then', 'slap', 'usual', 'coat', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'patina', 'squiggly', 'black', 'curlicue', 'hair', 'desaturated', 'tones', 'source', 'material', 'adding', 'little', 'illuminating', 'less.What', 'strengths', 'exist', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'doubly', 'strong', 'however', 'Broadway', 'counterpoint', 'consummate', 'Britishness', 'songs', 'suspense', 'murders', 'ultimately', 'themes', 'primarily', 'central', 'counterpoint', 'protagonist', 'villain', 'barber', 'judge', 'lowly', 'powerful', 'Depp', 'best', 'Bowie', 'impression', 'musical', 'numbers', 'cast', 'sings', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'perhaps', 'aid', 'digital', 'correction', 'remotely', 'essential', 'let', 'alone', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'decent', 'film', 'flashes', 'inspiration', 'imagery', 'perfunctory', 'forgettable', 'adaptation']",N/A

Benjamen Barker (Johnny Depp in his third Oscar Nominated performance) comes back to London after being falsely imprisoned by the corrupt judge (Alan Rickman) who wanted him out of the way, so he could steal his wife and daughter. He goes back to his old profession under the name Sweeney Todd as a barber but his purpose of life is to take revenge of the judge. Before he finally gets to the judge, Todd masters the shaving skills on dozens (maybe hundreds) of customers, becoming The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.  Todd's neighbor and accomplice Mrs. Lovett helps him to get rid of the corpses at the same time improving greatly the taste and quality of her meat pies for sale that soon become the hottest item in London.Who else but Tim Burton could adapt this material to the screen? As we would expect in his films, he does his usual admirable job with dark gothic sets and art direction (Oscar winning). Staging, production design, costumes, editing, cinematography are impressive and create gloomy and doomed mood.  Johnny Depp and Helena Bohnam Carter both did very good job not just acting but also singing in the film. Depp has gotten high praises for his performance and was nominated for many awards but I found Carter's performance most interesting and her character most memorable.The loyal fans of the original musical praise the songs and the very specific darker than dark sense of humor. While I agree that whatever songs have made it to the movie were melodically interesting enough, hard as I tried it was difficult to find humor in Burton's version. What was easy to find - enormous amount of blood gushing from the screen ""in your face"" in the very realistic manner, preceded by numerous throats slicing. Blood overwhelmed everything and everybody on the screen. Blood is the thing that I remember distinctly. Yes, I got the point. Sweeney Todd was the barber, and his specialty was to give his clients too close of the shave but did Burton really need all that blood?  I am sure everyone got the point after the first throat slicing and certainly after the second. After that - all the bloodshed became boring, tedious, and disgusting. I guess, Tim Burton needed it so, he ""could reflect on the horrors he had invented"".  I've been always a subscriber to the opinion that ""Implied is so much better than literal"". The scariest monster or the most horrific murder is the one that we never see, the uncertainty is the scariest monster of all and as long as we don't see it we picture it in our imagination and get scared of what we imagine. Once the monster is for us to see (especially as many times as in the movie), it is not scary anymore, it is laughable, and it loses whatever impact it was supposed to make, at least on this viewer.",3,There will be blood - lots of it...,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,2866,"['guess', 'blood', 'appropriated', 'movie', 'betrayal', 'revenge', 'cannibalism', 'other', 'things', 'Benjamen', 'Barker', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'third', 'Oscar', 'Nominated', 'performance', 'back', 'London', 'being', 'falsely', 'imprisoned', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'who', 'wanted', 'way', 'could', 'steal', 'wife', 'daughter', 'back', 'old', 'profession', 'name', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'barber', 'purpose', 'life', 'take', 'revenge', 'judge', 'finally', 'judge', 'Todd', 'shaving', 'skills', 'dozens', 'maybe', 'hundreds', 'customers', 'becoming', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'Todd', 'neighbor', 'accomplice', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'get', 'rid', 'corpses', 'same', 'time', 'improving', 'greatly', 'taste', 'quality', 'meat', 'pies', 'sale', 'soon', 'become', 'hottest', 'item', 'London.Who', 'else', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'could', 'adapt', 'material', 'screen', 'would', 'expect', 'films', 'usual', 'admirable', 'job', 'dark', 'gothic', 'sets', 'art', 'direction', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Staging', 'production', 'design', 'costumes', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'are', 'impressive', 'create', 'gloomy', 'doomed', 'mood', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bohnam', 'Carter', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'just', 'acting', 'also', 'singing', 'film', 'Depp', 'gotten', 'high', 'praises', 'performance', 'was', 'nominated', 'many', 'awards', 'found', 'Carter', 'performance', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'most', 'memorable.The', 'loyal', 'fans', 'original', 'musical', 'praise', 'songs', 'very', 'specific', 'darker', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'agree', 'songs', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'were', 'melodically', 'interesting', 'enough', 'hard', 'tried', 'was', 'difficult', 'find', 'humor', 'Burton', 'version', 'What', 'was', 'easy', 'find', 'enormous', 'amount', 'blood', 'gushing', 'screen', 'face', 'very', 'realistic', 'manner', 'preceded', 'numerous', 'throats', 'slicing', 'Blood', 'overwhelmed', 'everything', 'everybody', 'screen', 'Blood', 'thing', 'remember', 'distinctly', 'Yes', 'got', 'point', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'was', 'barber', 'specialty', 'was', 'give', 'clients', 'too', 'close', 'shave', 'did', 'Burton', 'really', 'need', 'blood', 'am', 'sure', 'everyone', 'got', 'point', 'first', 'throat', 'slicing', 'certainly', 'second', 'bloodshed', 'became', 'boring', 'tedious', 'disgusting', 'guess', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'needed', 'so', 'could', 'reflect', 'horrors', 'had', 'invented', ""'ve"", 'been', 'always', 'subscriber', 'opinion', 'Implied', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'literal', 'scariest', 'monster', 'most', 'horrific', 'murder', 'one', 'never', 'see', 'uncertainty', 'scariest', 'monster', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'picture', 'imagination', 'get', 'scared', 'what', 'imagine', 'monster', 'see', 'especially', 'as', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'anymore', 'laughable', 'impact', 'was', 'supposed', 'make', 'least', 'viewer']",N/A
1133588,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B001209SMS,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 3]","Although some have tried to argue that he was an actual person, it seems likely that the story of a throat-cutting barber Sweeney Todd arose first as an urban myth that was developed into an 1846 story titled THE STRING OF PEARLS by writer Thomas Prest. A year later the story was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET.In the 1970s composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim adapted a version of the story to the musical stage.  SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles.  Although it swept every award available, box office fell short of expectation and the show ended with a run of 557 performances.  Fortunately for us all, however, it has endured--first on the stage, then in concert, and now appearing as a film by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.The story, of course, is famous.  Barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to London after having been falsely imprisoned many years ago.  When he seeks his family he is told his wife is dead, his daughter Joanna (Jayne Wisener) a prisoner of the lecherous judge (Alan Rickman) who sentenced him.  Mad for revenge and criminally twisted, Barker takes the name Sweeney Todd and is soon sliting throats right and left--first by necessity but ultimately for the pleasure of it.  He soon associates with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who finds a handy way of disposing of the bodies: she bakes them into meat pies and soon has a thriving business.Given his penchant for the gothic, Burton would seem the perfect choice to helm a film version--and does so beautifully, especially in terms of design.  This is the underbelly of Victorian, fog-shrouded London, rendered in dark tones with the occasional splash of red blood.  The art design is nothing short of brilliant; the cinematography is all that you could wish.  At the same time, however, there is something very slightly amiss: although it has its own fascination, the film simply isn't as funny as it should be.  It is hard to say precisely why this is so, but it seems to me that the cause is two-fold: it lacks the satirical edge of the original and it has a slightly obvious quality.  Instead of being innovatative, SWEENEY TODD is simply Tim Burton as we already know him, and none of it comes as a surprise.The DVD release is quite handsome, with a huge number of extras and bonuses that are sure to please.  Recommended, and sure to find status as a cult classic.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,How About A Shave?,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,2559,"['have', 'tried', 'argue', 'was', 'actual', 'person', 'likely', 'story', 'throat-cutting', 'barber', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'arose', 'first', 'urban', 'myth', 'was', 'developed', '1846', 'story', 'titled', 'THE', 'STRING', 'OF', 'PEARLS', 'writer', 'Thomas', 'Prest', 'year', 'later', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'stage', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'THE', 'DEMON', 'BARBER', 'OF', 'FLEET', 'STREET.In', '1970s', 'composer', 'lyricist', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'adapted', 'version', 'story', 'musical', 'stage', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'DEMON', 'BARBER', 'OF', 'FLEET', 'STREET', 'opened', 'Broadway', '1', 'March', '1979', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'leading', 'roles', 'swept', 'award', 'available', 'box', 'office', 'fell', 'short', 'expectation', 'show', 'ended', 'run', '557', 'performances', 'Fortunately', 'however', 'endured', 'first', 'stage', 'then', 'concert', 'now', 'appearing', 'film', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'starring', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter.The', 'story', 'course', 'famous', 'Barber', 'Benjamin', 'Barker', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'London', 'having', 'been', 'falsely', 'imprisoned', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'family', 'told', 'wife', 'dead', 'daughter', 'Joanna', 'Jayne', 'Wisener', 'prisoner', 'lecherous', 'judge', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'who', 'sentenced', 'Mad', 'revenge', 'criminally', 'twisted', 'Barker', 'name', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'soon', 'sliting', 'throats', 'right', 'left', 'first', 'necessity', 'ultimately', 'pleasure', 'soon', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'handy', 'way', 'disposing', 'bodies', 'meat', 'pies', 'soon', 'thriving', 'business.Given', 'penchant', 'gothic', 'Burton', 'would', 'seem', 'perfect', 'choice', 'helm', 'film', 'version', 'so', 'beautifully', 'especially', 'terms', 'design', 'underbelly', 'Victorian', 'fog-shrouded', 'London', 'rendered', 'dark', 'tones', 'occasional', 'splash', 'red', 'blood', 'art', 'design', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'could', 'wish', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'something', 'very', 'slightly', 'amiss', 'own', 'fascination', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'should', 'be', 'hard', 'say', 'precisely', 'why', 'so', 'cause', 'two-fold', 'satirical', 'edge', 'original', 'slightly', 'obvious', 'quality', 'Instead', 'being', 'innovatative', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'simply', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'already', 'know', 'none', 'surprise.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'quite', 'handsome', 'huge', 'number', 'extras', 'bonuses', 'are', 'sure', 'please', 'Recommended', 'sure', 'find', 'status', 'cult', 'classic.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A
1133589,A31HMZ6GKDJ69P,B001209SMS,"Gary P. Deblasio ""dean""","[0, 0]","I saw Sweeney Todd in March of 1979 in preview on Broadway.  I sat in the second row-so I got to see all the gore up close. I was mesmorized and couldn't get it out of my head for months.  The only problem was that Angela Lansbury clearing wasn't up to the part in terms of the singing requirements of the role-but I loved her anyway.  Victor Garber played Anthony in a stiff manner, and the girl who played Joanna was such a dear thing you wanted to choke her.  I kept waiting for her to ""get it"" from ""Dad"".  I still LOVED the show.  Now the movie:  okay, HB Carter CANNOT sing, although she has a goth creepiness to her that Angela didn't. The latter was way more cockney and much funnier in the part--loony funny.  I give this only 4 stars because of Bonham-Carter.  Johnny was a much better S.T. than Len Cariou, who looked like an a-hole with that wig on-(he also had problems vocally) but Johnny is the perfect Sweeney.  Not that his voice is all that great either but he simply has the sex appeal that the other schlub lacked and thus provided a rationale why Mrs. Lovett was so crazy about him.  He also looks terrific with his makeup and that white streak in the hair.  A few problems:  the ""God That's Good"" number-which opened the second act was much better on the stage-and was more interesting in that this was the moment when the barber chair arrived and was tested. And unfortunately the ending of the movie is weak--where the hell is ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" which opened and closed the play?  This ending is too abrupt and drab (the film would have grossed 10 million more with the stage ending)-did Tim Burton think it was too ""theatrical""--but what's more theatrical that this show?Additionally I loved the voice of the kid who played Toby--he was better than Ken Jennings' stage Toby and much younger and more workhouse convincing.  The stage Toby was portrayed as retarded and was a lot older.  I loved the astonishing production design of the film and the marvellous costumes and of course let's not forget Borat himself as Pirelli-just marvelous in this small part.",4,"Okay, so it isn't Broadway!",1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,2093,"['saw', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'March', '1979', 'preview', 'Broadway', 'sat', 'second', 'row-so', 'got', 'see', 'gore', 'up', 'close', 'was', 'mesmorized', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'months', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'clearing', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'part', 'terms', 'singing', 'requirements', 'role-but', 'loved', 'anyway', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'played', 'Anthony', 'stiff', 'manner', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Joanna', 'was', 'such', 'dear', 'thing', 'wanted', 'choke', 'kept', 'waiting', 'get', 'Dad', 'still', 'LOVED', 'show', 'Now', 'movie', 'okay', 'HB', 'Carter', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'sing', 'goth', 'creepiness', 'Angela', 'did', ""n't"", 'latter', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'cockney', 'much', 'funnier', 'part', 'loony', 'funny', 'give', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'Bonham-Carter', 'Johnny', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'S.T', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'who', 'looked', 'a-hole', 'wig', 'on-', 'also', 'had', 'problems', 'vocally', 'Johnny', 'perfect', 'Sweeney', 'Not', 'voice', 'great', 'simply', 'sex', 'appeal', 'other', 'schlub', 'lacked', 'thus', 'provided', 'rationale', 'why', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'was', 'so', 'crazy', 'also', 'terrific', 'makeup', 'white', 'streak', 'hair', 'few', 'problems', 'God', 'That', 'Good', 'number-which', 'opened', 'second', 'act', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'stage-and', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'moment', 'when', 'barber', 'chair', 'arrived', 'was', 'tested', 'unfortunately', 'ending', 'movie', 'weak', 'where', 'hell', 'Ballad', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'opened', 'closed', 'play', 'ending', 'too', 'abrupt', 'drab', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'grossed', '10', 'million', 'more', 'stage', 'ending', '-did', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'think', 'was', 'too', 'theatrical', 'what', 'more', 'theatrical', 'show', 'Additionally', 'loved', 'voice', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'Toby', 'was', 'better', 'Ken', 'Jennings', 'stage', 'Toby', 'much', 'younger', 'more', 'workhouse', 'convincing', 'stage', 'Toby', 'was', 'portrayed', 'retarded', 'was', 'lot', 'older', 'loved', 'astonishing', 'production', 'design', 'film', 'marvellous', 'costumes', 'course', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Borat', 'Pirelli-just', 'marvelous', 'small', 'part']",N/A
1133590,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B001209SMS,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[9, 10]","Visually, the film either met or exceeded what I expected from Tim Burton, beginning with the opening titles and the bloodwork through and across the screen, setting the tone for everything to come. I have to admit that I was wanting to like it more than I was actually was at first, and this definitely had to do with it being my favorite musical.  Though I tried to have no expectations of the performances being theatrical, it was difficult if not impossible not to compare it with the stage version.It also took me a while to get used to the ""low energy"" of the performances, being so used to over-the-top theatricality in this piece. Then, somehow during the sequence between Judge Turpin and Anthony, EVERYTHING clicked and fell into place for me and I was into it as an entirely separate entity from what I know. The performances were uniformly excellent.I had some difficulty with Helena Bonham Carters' delivery of ""The Worst Pies in London"" - and some dialogue more whispered than spoken, but no more quibbles than that.As a splatter film fan, I thought Mr. Burton's artful gore was as inspired as the great Italian horror maestro, Dario Argento. The impressive arterial sprays and blood soaking everything (especially the opening and closing sequences) was, for a horror fan, great fun! In fact, the entire physical production was stunning and itself seemed to take the place of the chorus. The only choral part I ended up really missing was the ""More Hot Pies"" sequence, which was nonetheless impressive. Burton's blending of the comic and the horror was perfect, with the touching moments of Sondheim's score achieving an intimacy not possible on stage. The ""By the Sea"" sequence managed to be both touching and hilarious - and visually magnificent, a wicked splash of whimsical color amidst all the gray and gore.I worried (unnecessarily as it turns out) about ""Epiphany"" and how it would work on screen and Burton's solution ended up being brilliant, probably my favorite moment of the film. Brilliant also was the ""Johanna/City on Fire"" sequence, the brutality, bloodiness and beauty all coalescing into pure cinema magic. Heck, I didn't even mind Alan Rickman's horrid, tuneless singing! (He was pure evil as Turpin - which helped.) The actor playing Beadle Bamford was tremendously effective . . . just pure ""ew."" Sasha Baron Cohen was great creepy fun as Pirelli.I loved the treble as Toby - worked far better than having a ""teen"" for this part in a film. His ""Nothing's gonna harm you"" got me moist around the peepers and Bonham Carter's reactions were incredible as myriad emotions all played out across her face and through her eyes knowing what had to come next - this was powerful, gut churning stuff and it just wrecked me.Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter were both magnificent. The depth of character was remarkable, especially Depp who, playing Sweeney as one already half dead, yet infusing so much raw emotion into that corpse of a man . . . it was often heart wrenching.While from Ms. Bonham Carter I might have wished for a little better singing she was simply tremendous as Mrs. Lovett (and looked gloriously bad yet beautiful).This was an absolute treat - a moving, hilarious, powerful and terrifying movie I plan on enjoying again . . . and owning on DVD the minute it comes out!Go see it!",5,Sweeney Makes it to the Big Screen - Beautifully,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,3327,"['Visually', 'film', 'met', 'exceeded', 'what', 'expected', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'beginning', 'opening', 'titles', 'bloodwork', 'screen', 'setting', 'tone', 'everything', 'come', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'wanting', 'like', 'more', 'was', 'actually', 'was', 'first', 'definitely', 'had', 'do', 'being', 'favorite', 'musical', 'tried', 'have', 'expectations', 'performances', 'being', 'theatrical', 'was', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'not', 'compare', 'stage', 'version.It', 'also', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'low', 'energy', 'performances', 'being', 'so', 'used', 'over-the-top', 'theatricality', 'piece', 'Then', 'somehow', 'sequence', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Anthony', 'EVERYTHING', 'clicked', 'fell', 'place', 'was', 'entirely', 'separate', 'entity', 'what', 'know', 'performances', 'were', 'uniformly', 'excellent.I', 'had', 'difficulty', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carters', 'delivery', 'Worst', 'Pies', 'London', 'dialogue', 'more', 'whispered', 'spoken', 'more', 'quibbles', 'that.As', 'splatter', 'film', 'fan', 'thought', 'Mr.', 'Burton', 'artful', 'gore', 'was', 'as', 'inspired', 'great', 'Italian', 'horror', 'maestro', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'impressive', 'arterial', 'sprays', 'blood', 'soaking', 'everything', 'especially', 'opening', 'closing', 'sequences', 'was', 'horror', 'fan', 'great', 'fun', 'fact', 'entire', 'physical', 'production', 'was', 'stunning', 'seemed', 'take', 'place', 'chorus', 'only', 'choral', 'part', 'ended', 'up', 'really', 'missing', 'was', 'More', 'Hot', 'Pies', 'sequence', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'impressive', 'Burton', 'blending', 'comic', 'horror', 'was', 'perfect', 'touching', 'moments', 'Sondheim', 'score', 'achieving', 'intimacy', 'not', 'possible', 'stage', 'Sea', 'sequence', 'managed', 'be', 'touching', 'hilarious', 'visually', 'magnificent', 'wicked', 'splash', 'whimsical', 'color', 'gray', 'gore.I', 'worried', 'unnecessarily', 'out', 'Epiphany', 'how', 'would', 'work', 'screen', 'Burton', 'solution', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'brilliant', 'probably', 'favorite', 'moment', 'film', 'Brilliant', 'also', 'was', 'Johanna/City', 'Fire', 'sequence', 'brutality', 'bloodiness', 'beauty', 'coalescing', 'pure', 'cinema', 'magic', 'Heck', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'horrid', 'tuneless', 'singing', 'was', 'pure', 'evil', 'Turpin', 'helped', 'actor', 'playing', 'Beadle', 'Bamford', 'was', 'tremendously', 'effective', 'just', 'pure', 'ew', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'was', 'great', 'creepy', 'fun', 'Pirelli.I', 'loved', 'treble', 'Toby', 'worked', 'far', 'better', 'having', 'teen', 'part', 'film', 'Nothing', 'gon', 'harm', 'got', 'moist', 'peepers', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'reactions', 'were', 'incredible', 'myriad', 'emotions', 'played', 'out', 'face', 'eyes', 'knowing', 'what', 'had', 'come', 'next', 'was', 'powerful', 'gut', 'churning', 'stuff', 'just', 'wrecked', 'me.Johnny', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'were', 'magnificent', 'depth', 'character', 'was', 'remarkable', 'especially', 'Depp', 'who', 'playing', 'Sweeney', 'one', 'already', 'half', 'dead', 'yet', 'infusing', 'so', 'much', 'raw', 'emotion', 'corpse', 'man', 'was', 'often', 'heart', 'wrenching.While', 'Ms.', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'might', 'have', 'wished', 'little', 'better', 'singing', 'was', 'simply', 'tremendous', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'looked', 'gloriously', 'bad', 'yet', 'beautiful', '.This', 'was', 'absolute', 'treat', 'moving', 'hilarious', 'powerful', 'terrifying', 'movie', 'plan', 'enjoying', 'again', 'owning', 'DVD', 'minute', 'out', 'Go', 'see']",N/A

For those who saw the original 1979 Hal Prince extravagant production starring Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou/George Hearn, and then the 2005 revival as condensed so creatively by John Doyle and re-orchestrated by Sarah Travis who placed the orchestral instruments in the hands of the 10 actors who tell the story of the strange Todd, the Tim Burton (screenplay reduction by Josh Logan) film will only enhance the pleasures of seeing SWEENEY TODD resurrected in yet another form. Each of these incarnations has its riches and together they establish Sondheim's work as a masterpiece.Johnny Depp makes a convincing Sweeney Todd, in looks and demeanor as well as in singing voice, and Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett fits right into Tim Burton's vision of the dark, squalid and seedy London.  Timothy Spall is perfect as the oily Beadle, Alan Rickman makes Judge Turpin an understandable villain, Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener are suitably infatuated young lovers, and Sacha Baron Cohen and Ed Sanders give top flight cameos as Signor Pirelli and Toby. The one advantage of seeing this fine film on DVD is the option of turning on the subtitles so as not to miss a word of Sondheim's superb lyrics.For this viewer, however, the most successful version of this 'opera' is the John Doyle production currently on the boards in Los Angeles with Judy Kaye as the most satisfying Mrs. Lovett on record.  This uniquely economical and endlessly creative production goes to the core of the work better than any other version, and if this traveling company comes anywhere near your home, go see it!

I was imagining the lyrics, &#34;I'm going to slit your throat and make you into a pie! I'm going to eat you with a tumbler of ale and a spot of Grey Poupon while I watch American Idol!&#34;  There are just some things you cannot imagine being made into a Broadway musical.  Little did I know, until I watched the special feature, that actually Tim Burton had made a movie about something that was already a musical.I was really surprised that it was actually a very good movie.  The men were easier on the ears than the women.  However, the acting was superb...and I was actually willing to sacrifice singing perfection for acting perfection.  It kept a good pace, which can be a problem in musicals.  The lyrics were not ridiculous, though I don't know if the songs really &#34;grab&#34; you.Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter play roles that we are accustomed to seeing them play, and yet it doesn't seem people ever get tired of seeing them play these parts because they just are so good at it!

1133593,A1MXW8ID78HM8U,B001209SMS,Grey W. Satterfield Jr.,"[1, 1]","Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is wonderful. It's a typical Burton piece, beautiful, stylized, and funny - but weird. I thought the segment in which Johnny Depp's Sweeney sang ""My Friends"" was incredibly strong, both musically and artistically. Burton's imagination and Depp's talent were both impressive. Depp is certainly not a professional singer but he is more than adequate vocally and nobody is better dramatically.I thought the decision to cast very young actors, they were all teenagers at the time, in the roles of Anthony, Johanna, and Toby was inspired. Ed Sanders as Toby was particularly impressive. He was only 13 or 14 but he really can sing.I also enjoyed Jayne Wisener as Johanna. Although she was only marginal musically, her youth and beauty made Judge Turpin's obsession with her entirely believable. In fairness to Wisener, I should point out that Johanna's role has traditionally been taken on the stage by classically trained coloratura sopranos, which Wisener certainly is not.. A change was made to her character in the film. In the stage version she is palpably nuts and ends up shooting the asylum keeper, Fogg, after Anthony rescues her. In the movie she is just sad and nave. I thought that it worked.My only caveat to Burton's Sweeney is that it is haunted by the ghosts of George Hearn and Angela Lansbury, the quintessential Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett. Both have great voices and are strong actors but, alas, Lansbury is in her 80s and Hearn in his 70s. Where are they when we need them.Hearn's and Lansbury's absence from Burton's Sweeney made it inevitable that Depp as Sweeney and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett would be compared to them - a contest that Depp and Bonham Carter would have to lose. Bonham Carter was barely adequate vocally. Nevertheless, I found her songs to be mostly effective and she shone dramatically. Despite her character's often monstrous conduct, Bonham Carter gave us a Mrs. Lovett who is pitifully sad but somehow sympathetic. Ultimately, she is her own worst enemy, the victim of her obsession with Sweeney.I give both Depp and Bonham Carter high marks for even being willing to take on this viciously difficult piece. Sondheim's music is closer to opera than it is to traditional musical theater and I can think of nothing in the repertoire that is as hard to sing as Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett's songs.Despite its cast's vocal limitations, Burton's Sweeney stands on its own as a brilliant musical homage to classic horror movies.

The Industrial Revolution brought wealth to those above, but dehumanizing working conditions, poverty and desperation to those below.The musical--Sondheim has called it ""black operetta""-- opened on Broadway in 1979. When the ""blood"" began to flow, many first-nighters walked out of the Uris Theater, horrified that a musical would take as its subject throat-slashing, cannibalism, and, on the periphery, pedophilia.But maybe Sweeney's time as a film has finally come. Today's audiences--prepared (desensitized?) by reports on the nightly news of Jeffrey Dahmer and other serial killers and the priest/pedophile scandal in the Catholic Church--may have the sense of having seen this before.Maybe they have, but never so entertainingly and with such beautiful music underscoring each violent slash of Sweeney's razor of chased silver.Guiding this sanguinary mayhem is director Tim Burton, who, with his alter ego Johnny Depp (Sweeney) and his wife, Helena Bonham-Carter (Mrs. Lovett) splashes across the screen a tale of injustice, unrequited love, but most of all revenge.Some admirers of the original Broadway version will no doubt have reservations, and strong ones, about the way the movie cuts the original from three hours to slightly less than two. But Sondheim himself is on record giving the movie his blessing, knowing that as a movie buff himself, cuts were necessary for the sake of the story and the medium of film. Fortunately, Sondheim, at 77, is still with us to make the cuts to the score himself. (Over the years, this is something he has been willing to do to stage productions of his greatest works: eg. ""Follies"", ""Company"".)Although a Christmas release, beware: SWEENEY is not OLIVER! with street throngs bursting into big production song and dance. This, after all, is a tale of the basest of human behaviors, where a ""pious vulture of the law""--Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman)--lusts after Sweeney's daughter Johanna through a peephole in the wall; where human bodies, like so much hamburger meat, are ground into ""fresh supplies"" for Nellie Lovett's meat pies. When all hope is abandoned, joyous, wide-angle high-kicking by the masses simply wouldn't wash.What does wash is an ocean of blood--its red the brightest color in a washed-out palette of sepia and ghostly white.Johnny Depp is the fascinating focus of the entire enterprise. His face drained of all blood with black smudges beneath his eyes, Depp is an icon of what injustice can wreak on the human spirit. When he returns from 15 years in prison on a false charge, trumped up by Judge Turpin, he is an avenging angel, so obsessed with revenge that in his rage, mankind itself is dispensable. (""They all deserve to die,"" as Sondheim's lyric puts it.)As meat pie-maker Nellie Lovett and Sweeney's amorous accomplice in crime, Helena Bonham Carter brings a more toned-down interpretation of the role. Sondheim wrote the stage role for Angela Lansbury in whose hands Nellie Lovett was more of a star turn, a much ""showier"" role--hornier--that threatened to upstage the characterization of Sweeney himself. Here, Carter's humor is more subtle. As great as Lansbury's Tony Award-winning performance was, her music-hall interpretation would have thrown the movie's tone and balance out of whack. (Lansbury's turn as Mrs. Lovett is available on DVD with George Hearn as Sweeney. To see the original show and to hear the complete Broadway score, I urge you to see it.)Ghostly white make-up cannot diminish the movie star faces of Depp and Carter. Their acting chops are so right for the these roles that one overlooks their lack of vocal power as singers. Depp, whose singing voice here is a rock, Bowie-esque take, does better with Sondheim's lyrics than Carter whose somewhat lazy articulation loses what can be brilliantly breathtaking to the ear when sung with clarity.Finally, who but Sondheim could have juxtaposed some of the most beautiful and soaring music ever written with deeds most bloody and foul? As Sweeney does his customers', Tim Burton's film takes you by the throat--and stomach--and, for almost two hours, shows you what the wages of revenge--and madness--can be.With the exception of the filmed version of his ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" and ""A Little Night Music"", Hollywood has ignored the works of Sondheim. With SWEENEY TODD's success and with Aaron Sorkin (TV's ""The West Wing"") currently adapting ""Follies"" for the screen, moviegoers could be on the brink of a geyser of Sondheim, albeit not bloody like this one.",4,SWEENEY: Revenge is a dish best served...bloody,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,5035,"['Abandon', 'hope', 'ye', 'who', 'enter', 'here', 'sign', 'Gate', 'Hell', 'Dante', 'Inferno',

Technically brilliant on ALL levels.2).  On its own, a great film.  As an adaptation of the stage show, sadly lacking, especially in the ""singing"" department.3).  Burton creates a strictly dramatic version of the story... Sondheim's wonderful black humor is terribly missed.4).  Although many of the musical cuts added to the film, cutting ""The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd"" is very sorely missed- without the chorus, we don't appreciate the horror of Sweeney's bloody deeds effect upon the community.  Also- Christopher Lee and Anthony Stewart Head were SUPPOSED to be part of that chorus... it's inexcusable to not mention in the film's credit that they were dismissed due to Burton's changed take on the script.5).  Bonham's take on ""Mrs. Lovett"" is dead-on in context of the film, although a daffier take on her(re: Lanbury's balmy version and LuPone's sexier one) would have lightened things up a bit.6).  With all said, this IS the superlative version of any Sondheim show in films, although I will equally treasure the filmed version of the original Harold Prince staging with the touring company, as well as the San Francisco ""Concert"" version(the recent Broadway revival is available as a bootleg, but does not measure up to the previous three).",5,FOR LOVERS OF THE SHOW....,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,1395,"['brief', 'condensation', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'regarding', 'film', 'version', 'SWEENEY', 'affect', 'appreciation', 'film.1', 'Technically', 'brilliant', 'ALL', 'levels.2', 'own', 'great', 'film', 'adaptation', 'stage', 'show', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'especially', 'singing', 'department.3', 'Burton', 'strictly', 'dramatic', 'version', 'story', 'Sondheim', 'wonderful', 'black', 'humor', 'terribly', 'missed.4', 'many', 'musical', 'cuts', 'added', 'film', 'cutting', 'Ballad', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'very', 'sorely', 'missed-', 'chorus', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'horror', 'Sweeney', 'bloody', 'effect', 'community', 'Also-', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'were', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'part', 'chorus', 'inexcusable', 'not', 'mention', 'film', 'credit', 'were', 'dismissed', 'due', 'Burton', 'changed', 'take', 'script.5', 'Bonham', 'take', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'dead-on', 'context', 'film', 'daffier', 'take', 're', 'Lanbury', 'balmy', 'version', 'LuPone', 'sexier', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'lightened', 'things', 'up', 'bit.6', 'said', 'superlative', 'version', 'Sondheim', 'show', 'films', 'will', 'equally', 'treasure', 'filmed', 'version', 'original', 'Harold', 'Prince', 'staging', 'touring', 'company', 'as', 'well', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Concert', 'version', 'recent', 'Broadway', 'revival', 'available', 'bootleg', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'previous', 'three']",N/A
1133607,AVY0QDX64VUKM,B001209SMS,Inspector Karamazov,"[3, 5]","This was the first version of Sweeney Todd I ever saw. I was introduced by a friend and fell completely in love with the music. For a year or so, I was content with the music and the movie, before I decided to see the 82 version was George Hearn and Angela Landsbury. I didn't watch it again for awhile, but decided to return to see if it was as good as I first thought. The answer, sadly, is no, it is not.I realize that to adapt a movie from stage to screen, changes have to take place. However, that is no excuse for cutting so many songs. Johana is reduced to a bit part, and because all of her songs with Anthony are cut, their relationship seems hollow. The wigmaker sequence,the assylum (along with the chilling City on Fire Song), and a verse from a Little Priest mysteriously disapear.I can see how the Greek chorus aspect would seem cheesy on screen, but that doesn't mean the chorus had to be cut from God That's Good and Pirelli's Miracle Elixir. Also baffling his how the Johana Quartet is cut down to only three parts. the girl who played Johana had a pretty voice, and I believe she could have handled it.The movie is too dark, and it is hard to see what is going on. The colours (except the gushing blood) are all dull. None of the wild energy in the stage versions are here, only dreary reality. I suppose this would have been fine if Burton had been aiming for reality, but the over-the-top costumes and gore tell another story.Where the stage production has some very funny moments, they don't hit me as funny here. Perhaps because of the dead look of the film, or perhaps because of the singers themselves (though it doesn't help that the humorous parts are chopped down or cut out). Johnny Depp's face never changes; it seems to be stuck in a frown forever. He never sings with any real emotion, and, though at times his voice is pleasant to hear, not a note he sings is convincing or credible. Carter tries, too, but she plain can't sing. I know it's unfair to compare her to the great Angela Landsbury, but I would like at least competence. Carter seems more frazzled than insane.By contrast, the child who sings Toby does so better than all the rest of the cast, and Sacha Baron Cohen was a very funny Pirelli. As I said before, Johanna had a nice voice, but we didn't get to hear enough of her.Some parts work. The cellar was very creepy, the kid was a good actor, and at times the 'dark' colourless astmosphere work.I reccomend this movie to people to like movies, not to theater nuts.

1133614,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B001209SMS,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 6]","Nothing to compare with the French version seen at the cinema some years ago. This film in its original version is entirely or nearly entirely sung and the music is probably the best part of the film.First Tim Burton recreateS in color the bleak black and white vision we can have of London in Dickens among others. Oliver Twist is there in front of us all over again, and his world of coal, smoke and dirt. The only real color he uses is red, the color of blood and nothing else. That is already a piece of art and a masterpiece at that.Second the actors are so great in their roles and characters that we do believe they are what they pretend to be. Sweeney Todd is really a monster at first look and will not vary from that identification one single iota. He may be justified in his monstrosity or monster-ness, but he is a monster through and through. And he drags everyone around him into that ugliness.Third there is no hope whatsoever. In the film at least. He abandons the younger ones behind, the youngest has just Killed Sweeney, the two others, the sailor and Todd's daughter are just abandoned alone and frightened. You can also imagine what the good old English Victorian society is going to do to them when they are discovered or captured in that vast cemetery of corpses and cadavers.Fourth the speaking is voluntarily fuzzy, misty, dark, difficult to follow, often too low, and that is done on purpose. The dialogue is not so much important, apart from a few sentences now and then. It is an atmosphere that is created as if everyone was more or whispering or mumbling in order not to be overheard or understood, misunderstood maybe.But fifth in this atmosphere the most important element is the music and the singing. It is in no way attractive, charming, harmonious or whatever you may expect from music and singing. It is always the same tone, even when the tune is changing, a very minor dirge that stretches out without any kind of harmony or even attractive rhythm. It is a slow tempo for a very flat music and a minimal singing. A dirge I said, maybe even more than that, the complaint of surviving undead living dead ghosts. We are in the deepest most sinister cul-de-sac blind alley you can imagine in full darkness, with no public light, just a smidgeon of moonlight between two heavy clouds.And Sweeney Todd is so much engulfed in his vengeance that he does not see anything any more. He does not recognize his own wife except when it is too late. He nearly does the same thing with his own daughter, though he is distracted just in time. He even gets rid of his main accomplice probably out of pure blind vanity and addiction, the addiction to his own vengeance and killing. And his unaware child accomplice is getting just like him at the end and the final razor cut sinks deep in our sensitive mind. Nothing to save that Sweeney and his world. Victorian to the very last second and even right into the credits.If you believe in love, stay away.

Both are great, with their individual personalities. The play allows us to watch the action; the film makes us a part of the action. The photography often races through the dark streets of London, and we find ourselves trying to keep up with it. Then we're suddenly back in the story, in an almost voyeuristic way. We like Sweeney Todd because we can empathize with why he became the ""Demom"". We realize we are all capable of commiting bad things. Thankfully, most of us don't follow through. We know the difference between right and wrong. We know Mr. Todd has descended into madness, and it is his acceptance and understanding of his condition that make him respectable. Johnny Depp delivers yet another perfect performance as Sweeney. Helena Bohnam Carter is wonderful as Mrs. Lovett. She allows us to watch as she subtly shifts  personality from a desperate woman guilty of making ""the worst pies in London"" to an obsessed, evil accomplice. They become business partners, and soon Mrs. Lovett is happily famous for making the best pies in London. Make no mistake, there is a lot of blood flying in all directions, and that may bother some people. Truthfully, I have seen more blood and gore in those ""franchise"" movies. Director Tim Burton mixes up a batch of bright red blood, and along with some great effects he drenches us with Sweeney's vengeance. The flim is beautifully shot in very muted color, which plays well against the artful grayness of old London. The supporting cast is outstanding, notably Alan Rickman as a lecherous, cruel man of power. The story unfolds, as it must, as a gothic opera, with a great soundtrack. (Don't buy the ""highlights"" CD; get the full soundtrack with an 80 page book of the full libretto). Perhaps Burton's best decision was to cast the leads with ""non-singers"". Johnny Depp is actually an excellent non-singer, his every word making its point. Helena Bonham Carter is definitely a true non-singer, and yet she manages to capture the desparation, obsession, fear, pathos and love her character demands. A lot of people don't like ""musicals"", but this film would have been mundane and most likely a flop, if the script was spoken. Why? Because it would have shoved us back to the balcony, only allowing us to watch rather than participate. There are some darkly hilarious scenes, and the lyrics are perhaps some of Sondheim's best. I especially thought ""A Little Priest"" was grotesquely funny. If you have not yet seen it, give it a try. It's a gem that was poorly treated by the Academy. Johnny Depp deserved that Oscar. His performance was stunning, reminding me that the last time I was so impressed was the year Meryl Streep won for ""Sophie's Choice"".

1133617,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B001209SMS,James Hiller,"[4, 7]","Now, I'm not a Sweeney Todd devotee by any means. I've tried, on several occasions, to watch the Angela Lansbury and George Hearns version of the musical that I actually own on DVD, but haven't been able to finish it. I heard the recent B'way incantation was a brilliant revisioning of the musical, but I haven't seen it. So, when the critics began to rant and rave about this blood thirsty musical, I had my reservations, but I went. And was a visual feast for the eyes and imagination it was.Sweeney Todd tells the story of ""The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"", who kills people in his life that do him wrong, and to dispose of them, uses the wiles of Mrs.Lovett, pie maker, all in the hopes of winning back his daughter, the beautiful Johanna.Tim Burton's vision of Sweeney is definitely right out of his playbook. London, set in the world of blacks and greys, make for an impressive visual palette for the blood-letting to come. Taking pages out of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Corpse Bride"", Burton uses similar scenes and sets to give the dreariness of London particular finesse. In fact, because I am fairly recent fans of those two animated movies, I appreciated Sweeney's look even more.However, there are so many people that populate these sets that are breathtaking. First, the impressive Johnny Depp, playing Sweeney with such despair and fierceness that I'm ready to hand him his long overdue Academy Award right now. Comparing this performance, which hangs with depression and sadness,  with the light hearted frivolity of Captain Jack Sparrow, you understand the range of acting only this man can produce. This movie without Depp would be a definite different flick. And the impressive talents of Burton's wife, Helena Bonham Carter, plays Lovett with such style that I began to see her in a different way than Lansbury's Lovett. Both of their singing is very natural, not B'way or staged, but from themselves and their characters, and the effect is amazing.Sweeney Todd probably isn't for everyone, but I suspect that musical fans, Sondheim fans, Burton fans, and Anglophiles all will adore this adaptation. I did. It's odd Christmas fare, but floats easily in the sea of fine films that seem to besiege us every holiday season.

1133618,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B001209SMS,James Morris,"[362, 389]","Although critics have been almost unanimous in their praise of this film, many fans of the show are quite harsh in their appraisal, chiefly for two reasons - one, that the principals are not great singers, and two, the deletion of roughly 50% of the score.  I surprised myself in that, having purchased the soundtrack and seen the movie, I am in neither camp, as either of these factors might heretofore have caused me to pronounce most film adaptations of almost any Broadway musical a failure.  Instead, I am thrilled far beyond my expectations with this production.It might not have been so, had I not had so much respect for Stephen Sondheim.  As part of the pre-release publicity, he has granted an unusual (for him) number of interviews, and says that he is unequivocally satisfied with Tim Burton's vision.  As anyone who appreciates his high level of artistic integrity will agree, Mr. Sondheim would not give praise to this project if he were not satisfied with it.  At 77, Stephen Sondheim is considered by many to be the greatest composer in the history of the American theatre, and I have followed him long enough to know that no amount of financial consideration could cause him to declare his endorsement if he were not truly happy with the finished film.I have listened carefully to what Mr. Sondheim has had to say in those recent interviews, and now understand why so many stage musicals previously transferred to celluloid haven't worked.  To begin with, time passes very differently in a theatre than it does on film.  That which takes several minutes in a Broadway theatre (i.e. a full-blown production number) is apt to seem like a small eternity on screen.  Therefore, the very thing that keeps most audiences clamoring for more in live theatre is apt to make many movie audiences run screaming from the auditorium.  Then there is the problem of what Alfred Hitchcock once termed ""suspension of disbelief""; that is, in real life, no one ever bursts into song during one of life's dramatic moments, no less accompanied by a full orchestra, and many moviegoers who are accustomed to a certain amount of reality therefore find musical films particularly hard to take.  Thanks to some of the theories on musical film voiced by Mr. Sondheim in the past week or so, I finally understand why so many previous attempts to film Broadway musicals fall flat - in short, the theatre and film are two entirely different mediums, with two entirely different audiences.  Although many theatre lovers, myself included, would be happy to sit through an entire musical transferred to screen exactly as produced on stage, most movie audiences demand something different.  And something different is what they surely get with Sweeney Todd.Then there is the score.  Tim Burton has said that he has been a fan of Sweeney Todd since its original run.  I believe that, as disappointing as it is for many fans to accept how much of the score has been cut, it was probably even more agonizing for Mr. Burton to decide what pieces to remove.  The original ran over three hours, and at least 75% of the story was sung, making Sweeney Todd one of the few genuine operas to ever come out of Broadway.  The film runs only 117 minutes and, judging by the length of the soundtrack CD (a mere 72 minutes) easily 40% of the score has been removed, chiefly the ensemble pieces.  Mr. Burton apparently judged (probably correctly) that the choral numbers which worked so well on stage, although containing some of the wittiest lyrics, would be clunky and ponderous on film, and he made the prudent (if, I'm sure, difficult) decision to let them go.  This is likely to be the sorest point for many fans of the show.  And had I not been paying careful attention to Mr. Sondheim's recent interviews, I may not have been able to get past that point myself.But what has been excised is more than compensated for in Mr. Burton's sumptuous visuals and careful attention to detail.  Although Mr. Sondheim has made changes to the lyrics, resolving previously problematic portions of the score and actually improving it, it's amazing how much of what is left of the score is faithful to the original.  Though it's a tragic story, Sweeney Todd remains in essence a dark comedy, and many of Mr. Burton's finer touches, especially the staging of the musical numbers, have enhanced the story to the point where I have hardly missed the deletions, and I speak as someone who has loved this piece in almost all of its previous renderings.And I admit that, although he has never been a particular favorite of mine, Johnny Depp is a revelation.  Without detracting from previous interpreters of the role (especially Len Cariou and George Hearn), Mr. Depp's evocation of the character is so fully fleshed out, and so filled with genuine pathos and sympathy, that I was able to immediately excuse the fact that he is not a seasoned vocalist.  Besides, to reiterate a point made earlier, this is not Broadway, and there is no need for his voice to reach the back of the house.  If anything, the fact that the principal characters are not great singers actually enhances the realistic feel of the film.  It is also a pleasure to have both Toby and Anthony (not to mention Joanna) played by actors of the appropriate age, and hear accents that actually invoke pre-Victorian London.In the end however, the real star (to me, anyway) is the superlative score by Stephen Sondheim.  I am not amazed that some feel that there are no ""memorable songs"" in the score.  Good music should be subtle; the absence of ""catchy tunes"" that one will whistle on the way out of the theatre is only indicative to me of the high quality of the score.  Anyone who is previously unfamiliar with Sweeney Todd who doesn't ""get it"" is urged to purchase the soundtrack (the full version, with the complete libretto included) and follow along with the words and music as the songs are sung.  The first thing you will realize is (as with any of Mr. Sondheim's works, whether they be in a film, the theatre, or any other medium) how incredibly witty and sophisticated his lyrics are; on first listen you are apt to miss most of his delicious wit.  His use of the English language, his clever rhymes, and above all, his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who cares to take the time to listen.  There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word.  But just as important as his words (and I have always admired Sondheim's ability to use words above all else that I treasure in the world of musical theatre), you will find, especially if you listen long and hard enough, that his delicate, subtle music will, in time, work its way into your heart and conscience as some of the most beautiful music ever composed.  This is NOT top-forty pop music, the type that is so often mistaken for excellence in theatre these days.  In his ballads especially, Sondheim writes genuine, heartfelt gorgeous melodies; that is, real music.  Once you open your heart and mind to Sondheim's glorious words and sumptuous airs, you may just become a fan for life.",5,Sondheim's Masterpiece Finally on Film,1198368000,"12 23,

A humble barber loses his pretty partner and daughter. He seeks revenge on the world with a low-life malheureuse. The serial killing and cannibalism that follow seem emotionally out of place. You never feel Todd's motivation is authentic. His suffering is not really on the level of Job, Spartacus, Karl Childers or even the Count of Monte Cristo. Unfortunately, like all of Sondheim, the emotional context here is about as authentic as one of the whinier episodes of Love American Style. The music is derivative and not really good, though the creator no doubt considered it to be ground-breaking. Rejected by his mom, Sondheim went after big-time approval from critics and audiences. The Former he usually gets from the parochial Miss Daisys of the New York Times. But the theaters staging his works usually end up empty. No one considers Sondheim a legend as much as Sondheim. When Follies was revived last year on Broadway, I overheard a priceless sales pitch on the half-price tickets line. The officious hawker was trying to convince a tourist to see it with the following guarded praise: ""It's really great, well anyway it's like a museum piece...well, in any case, the performances are certainly worth seeing."" And I said ""save your money and look for a real museum piece in a museum. You're too late for the real Follies, which at least had spectacle in their favor."" Sweeney avoids the endless kvetch-fest of Follies, but not a note of it rings true. Just one example to illustrate how emotion is just wallpaper to Sondheim: how on earth does Mrs. Lovett end up singing ""Not While I'm Around""? Schizophrenia? For it is the only thing of its kind in the whole show, so you can't believe it. Bizarre. That being said, the acting here is fine, even Sacha Cohen as the macassared mountebank . Too bad the actors had such mediocre material to work with.An interesting Sondheim anecdote: I was at the Met for a brilliant performance of an opera about another ne'er-do-well. I can't besmirch the composer by stating his name in the context of this debacle. Suffice it to say, the character he created, unlike Sondheim's, is richly ambiguous, not a stereotype, with interesting motivation and ingenious music. Sondheim was in the first row and at the curtain got up and scurried out without applauding in the midst of tumultuous appluse. Jealous much? My advice: write a musical about a Broadway songsmith with towering ambition and puny talent. That's a story I'd believe and I think this time he'd get it right.",1,"Sondheim's usual knish: overrated, leaden and tasteless",1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,2618,"['Sondheim', 'ambition', 'offering', 'empty', 'calories', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'gourmet', 'menu', 'humble', 'barber', 'pretty', 'partner', 'daughter', 'revenge', 'world', 'low-life', 'malheureuse', 'serial', 'killing', 'cannibalism', 'follow', 'seem', 'emotionally', 'place', 'never', 'feel', 'Todd', 'motivation', 'authentic', 'suffering', 'not', 'really', 'level', 'Job', 'Spartacus', 'Karl', 'Childers', 'even', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'Unfortunately', 'Sondheim', 'emotional', 'context', 'here', 'as', 'authentic', 'one', 'whinier', 'episodes', 'Love', 'American', 'Style', 'music', 'derivative', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'creator', 'doubt', 'considered', 'be', 'ground-breaking', 'Rejected', 'mom', 'Sondheim', 'went', 'big-time', 'approval', 'critics', 'audiences', 'Former', 'usually', 'parochial', 'Miss', 'Daisys', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'theaters', 'staging', 'works', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'empty', 'one', 'Sondheim', 'legend', 'as', 'much', 'Sondheim', 'When', 'Follies', 'was', 'revived', 'last', 'year', 'Broadway', 'overheard', 'priceless', 'sales', 'pitch', 'half-price', 'tickets', 'line', 'officious', 'hawker', 'was', 'trying', 'convince', 'tourist', 'see', 'following', 'guarded', 'praise', 'really', 'great', 'well', 'museum', 'piece', 'well', 'case', 'performances', 'are', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'said', 'save', 'money', 'look', 'real', 'museum', 'piece', 'museum', ""'re"", 'too', 'late', 'real', 'Follies', 'least', 'had', 'spectacle', 'favor', 'Sweeney', 'endless', 'kvetch-fest', 'Follies', 'not', 'note', 'true', 'Just', 'one', 'example', 'illustrate', 'how', 'emotion', 'just', 'wallpaper', 'Sondheim', 'how', 'earth', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'end', 'up', 'singing', 'Not', ""'m"", 'Schizophrenia', 'only', 'thing', 'kind', 'whole', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Bizarre', 'being', 'said', 'acting', 'here', 'fine', 'even', 'Sacha', 'Cohen', 'macassared', 'mountebank', 'Too', 'bad', 'actors', 'had', 'such', 'mediocre', 'material', 'work', 'with.An', 'interesting', 'Sondheim', 'anecdote', 'was', 'Met', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'opera', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'besmirch', 'composer', 'stating', 'name', 'context', 'debacle', 'Suffice', 'say', 'character', 'created', 'Sondheim', 'richly', 'ambiguous', 'not', 'stereotype', 'interesting', 'motivation', 'ingenious', 'music', 'Sondheim', 'was', 'first', 'row', 'curtain', 'got', 'up', 'scurried', 'out', 'applauding', 'midst', 'tumultuous', 'appluse', 'Jealous', 'much', 'advice', 'write', 'musical', 'Broadway', 'songsmith', 'towering', 'ambition', 'puny', 'talent', 'story', ""'d"", 'believe', 'think', 'time', ""'d"", 'get', 'right']",N/A

1133622,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B001209SMS,Jem,"[1, 4]","I had never heard of this musical before the movie was advertised.  I wasn't familiar with the score, so I didn't miss any of the songs they cut.  I knew the basic story from commercials, but I had no expectations going into this film.  I like Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter and that was my main motivation for seeing it.I was delighted at how well Depp can sing. He imbued his songs with real emotion and his voice is surprisingly rich. This was especially true during the ode to his razors, ""My Friends."" The look on his face as he cherishes them is scary as hell, and brought the character fully to life for me.  This was my favorite song of the movie.  Depp was also careful to enunciate clearly, so I had no problems understanding what he was singing most of the time.  Unfortunately, the same is not true for Carter.  Other reviewers have complained about how weak her voice was.  I didn't notice that so much; her voice was okay, and I thought she played the part well.  However, most of the time I couldn't tell what she was singing outside of the chorus.  Since the songs convey a lot of the plot/storyline, this was a real problem.  Luckily, she had a number of duets with Depp, and I could follow what he was singing and get the gist. Alan Rickman turned in a lovely performance as the sleazy ""villain"" Turpin, and his song with Depp, ""Pretty Women,"" was well done.  However, his role was necessarily small due to time constraints (I think) and I wish it could have been more.  The boy who played Toby had an excellent voice, and his role added some lighter moments to a dark story.  As to the lovebirds - they were unremarkable.  They sang their songs fine, but I didn't really get much out of their characters.  They were just there.  I'm not sure if their characters had songs that were cut that would have fleshed them out more, but as it was I didn't care about them in the least.The story itself seemed a bit disjointed at times and this may be due to the missing songs.  At a couple of points, I felt like it was just a series of songs strung together.  No doubt this would be phenomenal on stage, and I would love to see Johnny Depp reprise the role live.  He truly carried the film by the force of his character's charisma.  At all times he was the focus that kept the story flowing.  I can honestly say this was one of his best performances and I truly enjoyed the film because of it.  The costumes, make-up and sets were all great.  Burton gave the film an ethereal feel.  London didn't look real, per se, it looked like I could be seeing this live on stage.  The dirty streets and dark lighting captured the time period and gloomy atmosphere perfectly.  And the R rating is more than deserved.  This is not for children, or the squeamish.  The gore was in your face - literally.  Once Sweeney started murdering, the blood spatter practically hit the camera every time he slit a throat.  And the music carries it out.  ""A Little Priest,"" when Lovett and Todd decide to bake up the bodies, is simultaneously macabre and funny as they debate who would make a tasty pie (the priest is too fat, the poet might be diseased...)As to this single disc edition, I was disappointed.  There is only one extra on it.  After watching the film, I realized that additional features would have made the experience better with insights into the adaptation, and possibly deleted scenes.  I really regret not buying the two-disc special edition.Overall, Johnny Depp carried this movie almost completely.  Any shortcomings it has are likely due to adapting a long musical to film. It is very well done, and I highly recommend it.UPDATE:  I decided to give this version to my niece and buy the two-disc set.  It was definitely worth it!  The featurette on the ""real"" Sweeney Todd, and the legend was interesting and provided great background.  However, I also highly recommend buying the DVD of the stage show,Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Keepcase), with Angela Lansbury - it was phenomenal.",4,First taste of Sweeney...,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,4029,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'musical', 'movie', 'was', 'advertised', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'score', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'songs', 'cut', 'knew', 'basic', 'story', 'commercials', 'had', 'expectations', 'going', 'film', 'like', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'was', 'main', 'motivation', 'seeing', 'it.I', 'was', 'delighted', 'how', 'well', 'Depp', 'can', 'sing', 'imbued', 'songs', 'real', 'emotion', 'voice', 'surprisingly', 'rich', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'ode', 'razors', 'Friends', 'look', 'face', 'scary', 'hell', 'brought', 'character', 'fully', 'life', 'was', 'favorite', 'song', 'movie', 'Depp', 'was', 'also', 'careful', 'enunciate', 'clearly', 'had', 'problems', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'singing', 'most', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'not', 'true', 'Carter', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'how', 'weak', 'voice', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'so', 'much', 'voice', 'was', 'okay', 'thought', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'However', 'most', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'singing', 'chorus', 'songs', 'convey', 'lot', 'plot/storyline', 'was', 'real', 'problem', 'Luckily', 'had', 'number', 'duets', 'Depp', 'could', 'follow', 'what', 'was', 'singing', 'get', 'gist', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'turned', 'lovely', 'performance', 'sleazy', 'villain', 'Turpin', 'song', 'Depp', 'Pretty', 'Women', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'However', 'role', 'was', 'necessarily', 'small', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'think', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'boy', 'who', 'played', 'Toby', 'had', 'excellent', 'voice', 'role', 'added', 'lighter', 'moments', 'dark', 'story', 'lovebirds', 'were', 'unremarkable', 'sang', 'songs', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'much', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'there', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'characters', 'had', 'songs', 'were', 'cut', 'would', 'have', 'fleshed', 'more', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'least.The', 'story', 'seemed', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'missing', 'songs', 'couple', 'points', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'series', 'songs', 'strung', 'together', 'No', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'phenomenal', 'stage', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'reprise', 'role', 'live', 'truly', 'carried', 'film', 'force', 'character', 'charisma', 'times', 'was', 'focus', 'kept', 'story', 'flowing', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'costumes', 'make-up', 'sets', 'were', 'great', 'Burton', 'gave', 'film', 'ethereal', 'feel', 'London', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'se', 'looked', 'could', 'be', 'seeing', 'live', 'stage', 'dirty', 'streets', 'dark', 'lighting', 'captured', 'time', 'period', 'gloomy', 'atmosphere', 'perfectly', 'R', 'rating', 'more', 'deserved', 'not', 'children', 'squeamish', 'gore', 'was', 'face', 'literally', 'Once', 'Sweeney', 'started', 'murdering', 'blood', 'spatter', 'practically', 'hit', 'camera', 'time', 'slit', 'throat', 'music', 'out', 'Little', 'Priest', 'when', 'Lovett', 'Todd', 'decide', 'bake', 'up', 'bodies', 'simultaneously', 'macabre', 'funny', 'debate', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'tasty', 'pie', 'priest', 'too', 'fat', 'poet', 'might', 'be', 'diseased', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'was', 'disappointed', 'only', 'one', 'extra', 'watching', 'film', 'realized', 'additional', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'experience', 'better', 'insights', 'adaptation', 'possibly', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'really', 'regret', 'not', 'buying', 'two-disc', 'special', 'edition.Overall', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'carried', 'movie', 'almost', 'completely', 'Any', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'likely', 'due', 'adapting', 'long', 'musical', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.UPDATE', 'decided', 'give', 'version', 'niece', 'buy', 'two-disc', 'set', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'featurette', 'real', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'legend', 'was', 'interesting', 'provided', 'great', 'background', 'However', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'DVD', 'stage', 'show', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'Broadway', 'Keepcase', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'was', 'phenomenal']",N/A

Some are too attached to the stage production and others are too eager to consider what was done on stage as irrelevant. Some consider Sondheim a god and others don't. I think I'm somewhere in the middle of all that. I love much of Sondheim's work, but I don't think he is the greatest theater composer and I don't think ""Sweeney Todd"" is the greatest of all musicals. I've never seen this performed live, but I am very familiar with the video of the stage production starring Lansbury and Hearn as well as the Broadway Cast Recording.The film is remarkably faithful to the stage production, but given Tim Burton's take on the material and the casting, I think the movie would actually have been more successful if it had been less faithful to the stage play. By adhering so closely to the source material, without retaining certain key elements that made that material work, Burton has made a movie that I found very frustrating and unsatisfying.The movie looks great. The photography and production design are stunning.The young lovers, a necessary plot device, but quite annoying in the stage production, are well cast, have had their roles judiciously parred down and are quite tolerable here. However, I still feel that the song ""Johanna"", despite having one of Sondheim's most beautiful melodies, also has some of the dopiest lyrics he has ever written.The Beggar Woman is also a little annoying in the play, but in the movie her role has not only been severely parred down but cleaned up and consequently the impact of her ultimate fate is badly dulled, robbing the ending of much of it's drama. Some people in the audience seemed confused about who she was.My impression from the play has always been that Toby is supposed to be a young man or teenager who is somewhat mentally disadvantaged. The movie has turned him into a little boy who seems to be sharp as a tack mentally, although much of the dialogue still refers to him as being dim witted. Sure, having a little boy makes the ending a little more shocking, but I'm not sure it makes sense dramatically.Now the big problem. Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett. How misconceived are these characterizations? I might have bought Johnny Depp's take on Sweeney had it not been paired with Bonham-Carter's Lovett, but the two together just don't cut it (no pun intended). They are both so enervated right from the beginning that it's hard to believe they could ever conceive of or carry out a plan like this. Mrs. Lovett's character is the real problem here. Certainly it could not have been played in a movie as broadly as Angela Lansbury played it on stage, however, an adaptation of that characterization would have worked. Mrs. Lovett should be anything but enervated. She is the planner. She's a practical woman and a survivor and is constantly working, conniving, planning, plotting. Sweeney may have dreams of vengeance, but it's Mrs. Lovett who makes it work, she's the muscle in this enterprise. Sweeney may be obsessed with death, but Mrs. Lovett is very much alive. Helena Bonham-Carter seems half dead before the movie starts. At one time Meryl Streep was mentioned as a possible Mrs. Lovett and we can only dream about what that performance would have been like.I also reject the notion that one has to choose between singers and actors. There are many people who are perfectly capable of doing both, although they may not have the star power of Johnny Depp or the personal relationships of Helena Bonham-Carter. The inability of the principals to actually sing this music means that they are totally unable to invest the songs with any kind of nuance or variety or character. After a while I found the monotone in which the music was performed to be tiresome - making all the music performed by these two sound alike.And what happened to the humor? At first I thought Tim Burton had made a choice to suck virtually all the humor out of the play, but the more I think about it I've come to the conclusion that he probably didn't get it in the first place. I never dreamed I'd encounter a performance of ""A Little Priest"" that would garner not one single laugh. This was the fault of both the lackluster vocals and the pedestrian staging. Did Burton really think we needed to actually see a priest, a fop, a green grocer, a runny pie to get the jokes? Also, how are we supposed to enjoy the jokes when the characters making them don't even seem to get them or be amused by them?",2,"great production design,but...",1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,4550,"['everyone', 'coming', 'film', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'are', 'too', 'attached', 'stage', 'production', 'others', 'are', 'too', 'eager', 'consider', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'stage', 'irrelevant', 'consider', 'Sondheim', 'god', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'somewhere', 'middle', 'love', 'much', 'Sondheim', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'greatest', 'theater', 'composer', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'greatest', 'musicals', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'performed', 'live', 'am', 'very', 'familiar', 'video', 'stage', 'production', 'starring', 'Lansbury', 'Hearn', 'as', 'well', 'Broadway', 'Cast', 'Recording.The', 'film', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'stage', 'production', 'given', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'take', 'material', 'casting', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'had', 'been', 'less', 'faithful', 'stage', 'play', 'adhering', 'so', 'closely', 'source', 'material', 'retaining', 'certain', 'key', 'elements', 'made', 'material', 'work', 'Burton', 'made', 'movie', 'found', 'very', 'frustrating', 'unsatisfying.The', 'movie', 'great', 'photography', 'production', 'design', 'are', 'stunning.The', 'young', 'lovers', 'necessary', 'plot', 'device', 'quite', 'annoying', 'stage', 'production', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'have', 'had', 'roles', 'judiciously', 'parred', 'down', 'are', 'quite', 'tolerable', 'here', 'However', 'still', 'feel', 'song', 'Johanna', 'having', 'one', 'Sondheim', 'most', 'beautiful', 'melodies', 'also', 'dopiest', 'lyrics', 'ever', 'written.The', 'Beggar', 'Woman', 'also', 'little', 'annoying', 'play', 'movie', 'role', 'not', 'only', 'been', 'severely', 'parred', 'down', 'cleaned', 'up', 'consequently', 'impact', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'badly', 'dulled', 'robbing', 'ending', 'much', 'drama', 'people', 'audience', 'seemed', 'confused', 'who', 'was.My', 'impression', 'play', 'always', 'been', 'Toby', 'supposed', 'be', 'young', 'man', 'teenager', 'who', 'somewhat', 'mentally', 'disadvantaged', 'movie', 'turned', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'sharp', 'tack', 'mentally', 'much', 'dialogue', 'still', 'refers', 'being', 'dim', 'witted', 'Sure', 'having', 'little', 'boy', 'ending', 'little', 'more', 'shocking', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'sense', 'big', 'problem', 'Sweeney', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'How', 'misconceived', 'are', 'characterizations', 'might', 'have', 'bought', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'take', 'Sweeney', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'paired', 'Bonham-Carter', 'Lovett', 'two', 'together', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'pun', 'intended', 'are', 'so', 'enervated', 'right', 'beginning', 'hard', 'believe', 'could', 'ever', 'conceive', 'carry', 'out', 'plan', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'character', 'real', 'problem', 'here', 'Certainly', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'movie', 'as', 'broadly', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'played', 'stage', 'however', 'adaptation', 'characterization', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'should', 'be', 'anything', 'enervated', 'planner', 'practical', 'woman', 'survivor', 'constantly', 'working', 'conniving', 'planning', 'plotting', 'Sweeney', 'may', 'have', 'dreams', 'vengeance', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'who', 'work', 'muscle', 'enterprise', 'Sweeney', 'may', 'be', 'obsessed', 'death', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'half', 'dead', 'movie', 'one', 'time', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'was', 'mentioned', 'possible', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'what', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'like.I', 'also', 'reject', 'notion', 'one', 'choose', 'singers', 'actors', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'doing', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'star', 'power', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'inability', 'principals', 'actually', 'sing', 'music', 'are', 'totally', 'unable', 'invest', 'songs', 'kind', 'nuance', 'variety', 'character', 'while', 'found', 'monotone', 'music', 'was', 'performed', 'be', 'tiresome', 'making', 'music', 'performed', 'two', 'sound', 'alike.And', 'what', 'happened', 'humor', 'first', 'thought', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'had', 'made', 'choice', 'suck', 'virtually', 'humor', 'play', 'more', 'think', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'place', 'never', 'dreamed', ""'d"", 'encounter', 'performance', 'A', 'Little', 'Priest', 'would', 'garner', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'laugh', 'was', 'fault', 'lackluster', 'vocals', 'pedestrian', 'staging', 'Did', 'Burton', 'really', 'think', 'needed', 'actually', 'see', 'priest', 'fop', 'green', 'grocer', 'runny', 'pie', 'get', 'jokes', 'Also', 'how', 'are', 'supposed', 'enjoy', 'jokes', 'when', 'characters', 'making', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'get', 'be', 'amused']",N/A

1133631,ABDAHMRYSMMIV,B001209SMS,"John Ellis ""jonthes""","[1, 5]","I am a great admirer of Sondheim and this work. I saw the original production a few times, and thought the filmed version of the performance with George Hearn (more human, less monster) replacing Len Cariou was even better. However, I also have enjoyed other versions of it and in fact think the BBC radio broadcast with Denis Quilley is the best, based on a small London production I didn't see.The film is often beautiful, and the score is orchestrated and performed instrumentally beyond any other version. The actors, most of whom were not chosen for their voices, do act the songs and sing effectively though Helen Bonham Carter is too young, too pretty and as a singer too breathy for Mrs. Lovett, nearly Marilyn Monroe-ish. That part has been played many ways, from Angela Lansbury's hilariously ridiculous middle-class wanna-be to Julia McKenzie's abrasive guttersnipe Lovett with Quilley. Tim Burton's gothic films consistently have the Halloween conceit of dressing up young, pretty actors as ghouls; Johnny Depp transcends this with real weight but for me Carter, Burton's wife, though she does well with what she has, is very miscast. She does add the one really felt element, a quickly discarded concern for the boy they casually adopt. Lansbury did it with one brief look sitting down on stage and silently (which you usually attribute to film acting). Carter gets a big whopping closeup and a few added lines to achieve it.A note on Depp's technique. Coming to acting as a rock singer, Depp's acting approach is to mimic, much as he surely did trying to find a style to become a rock star. He chooses someone to mimic and model his entire performance on, then riffs. The Rolling Stones have said  Jagger was trying to sound like Muddy Waters and failed badly but that became their signature style. Depp modeled pirate Jack on Keith Richards for instance. Here he models himself on David Bowie; vocally he never transcends the mimicry. It works but for me once I figured this out it was a distraction. Bowie actually would have been an interesting choice for Sweeney; but Russell Crowe and Meryl Streep (who were slated to do it at one time) would have lifted it another level for me. Streep (Mrs. Lovett is supposed to be older, part of the ridiculous romance) would have pulled Depp up another level all by herself. She probably isn't here because she would have been the best thing in it.I think what Burton really wants to create (and no doubt he's very happy with this film) is silent director Murnau's rich and emotional expressiveness and I wish Murnau (the silent ""Nosferatu"" and ""Faust"", very much the same mileau as this) was alive to have directed this. With Charlie Chaplin in the lead. I guess if I'm reaching that far back to compare it's an achievement. My problem is with the humor, wit and chorus largely and completely cut (a ghost chorus of Sweeney's victims was abandoned, which I think would have helped) and with the choice to film the brutality straight on with pornographic glee, ""Sweeney"" becomes too much (for me) a film of this horrible time. It's an Abu Grab musical, a Dick Cheney musical, a slaughter them before they do it to you musical bromide, a Bushian sociopathic musical. I was always afraid that the real heart of both Sondheim and the work was this gory, dark vicious hatred of all humanity, including himself, and Burton has gone out of his way to expose that truth of Sondheim and himself as well. I suppose it is cathartic, I cried walking home, but I fear it may also carry a contagion, a numbing to gore effect. Which is to say that art at its best is white magic. I think ""Sweeney"" isn't. It doesn't respect itself enough to fear its effect; pardon me if I sound like Louis B. Meyer or the Hays office. It doesn't believe in magic of any kind, even as it creates beauty around its own brutality.Human beings aren't just meat, I'm not and most of the people - not all - I know aren't. Shorn as it is, that is all this ""Sweeney"" comes to in the end, like a motto sewn into a pillow. It's grotesquely sad that anyone, much less talents like these, could think we and they are. There is compassion, as the throats were cut (including Michael Palin's if my eyes didn't deceive me) I felt my own slit even though I was just watching light shadows on a wall.

1133632,A9TG2NFA614S9,B001209SMS,John F. Rooney,"[0, 2]","This is a brilliant and horrific movie version of Sondheim's musical play with his affecting melodies and powerful lyrics beautifully transferred to the screen. The London of the mid-nineteenth century is vividly and evocatively recreated with the lighting, cinematography, and sets. It's a musical play about love, revenge, full of villains and without heroes. It is Sondheim's fierce, dark vision of Sweeney's world in a London that seems as menacing and disturbing as the title character.Johnny Depp gives a masterful portrayal of Sweeney that lets you get into his miserable soul. The New York Times music critic has commented on Depp's dramatic and musical mastery of the role with his fine enunciation, diction and perfect pitch. For Depp the acting came first, and the music added a great deal because it revealed the inner rage swirling in Todd's brain.Helena Bonham Carter does a fine job playing the restaurateur who uses Sweeney's victims as the prime ingredient in her meat pies. She and Depp, ghoul-like, have black circles around their haunted eyes. They and the play are right out of the Grand Guignol tradition of the gruesome and horrible. Alan Rickman, one villain among many, portrays the lustful Judge Turpin.This is a tragedy without a tragic hero because Sweeney's vengeance spreads to the killing of innocents. He sings, ""We all deserve to die."" He has made the decision that man is devouring man. If he were to wreak vengeance on Judge Turpin and his beadle alone, then we might say he was justified because they had stolen his wife and daughter after unjustly having him transported to Australia for life. But he takes out his vengeance on society as a whole and becomes a sociopathic killer.The repetitive blood-gushing scenes in which Todd is seen wielding his razor to cut his victims' throats are unnecessarily graphic and disturbing. They could have been done more creatively and suggestively without losing the point. We know that Sweeney is a violent mass murderer, not a tragic hero. The bloodletting trivializes death and desensitizes the viewer with the streams of arterial blood spurting out. For what purpose? Who gains from this spectacle? In John Doyle's stage version the killings were handled in a much subtler, more creative and for me more effective way. Blood spattered cloths conveyed the same message.In eliminating the operatic chorus episodes from the stage play, the film has failed to present the collective response to Sweeney and his atrocities.A grim but great piece of work, overly bloody, but triumphantly executed.",5,Loved the Movie - Hated the Bloodletting!,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,2570,"['brilliant', 'horrific', 'movie', 'version', 'Sondheim', 'musical', 'play', 'affecting', 'melodies', 'powerful', 'lyrics', 'beautifully', 'transferred', 'screen', 'London', 'mid-nineteenth', 'century', 'vividly', 'evocatively', 'recreated', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'musical', 'play', 'love', 'revenge', 'full', 'villains', 'heroes', 'Sondheim', 'fierce', 'dark', 'vision', 'Sweeney', 'world', 'London', 'menacing', 'disturbing', 'title', 'character.Johnny', 'Depp', 'masterful', 'portrayal', 'Sweeney', 'get', 'miserable', 'soul', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'music', 'critic', 'commented', 'Depp', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'mastery', 'role', 'fine', 'enunciation', 'diction', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'Depp', 'acting', 'came', 'first', 'music', 'added', 'great', 'deal', 'revealed', 'inner', 'rage', 'swirling', 'Todd', 'brain.Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'fine', 'job', 'playing', 'restaurateur', 'who', 'Sweeney', 'victims', 'prime', 'ingredient', 'meat', 'pies', 'Depp', 'ghoul-like', 'have', 'black', 'circles', 'haunted', 'eyes', 'play', 'are', 'right', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'tradition', 'gruesome', 'horrible', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'one', 'villain', 'many', 'lustful', 'Judge', 'Turpin.This', 'tragedy', 'tragic', 'hero', 'Sweeney', 'vengeance', 'spreads', 'killing', 'innocents', 'deserve', 'die', 'made', 'decision', 'man', 'devouring', 'man', 'were', 'wreak', 'vengeance', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'beadle', 'alone', 'then', 'might', 'say', 'was', 'justified', 'had', 'stolen', 'wife', 'daughter', 'unjustly', 'having', 'transported', 'Australia', 'life', 'out', 'vengeance', 'society', 'whole', 'sociopathic', 'killer.The', 'repetitive', 'blood-gushing', 'scenes', 'Todd', 'seen', 'wielding', 'razor', 'cut', 'victims', 'throats', 'are', 'unnecessarily', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'creatively', 'suggestively', 'losing', 'point', 'know', 'Sweeney', 'violent', 'mass', 'murderer', 'not', 'tragic', 'hero', 'bloodletting', 'death', 'viewer', 'streams', 'arterial', 'blood', 'spurting', 'out', 'what', 'purpose', 'Who', 'gains', 'spectacle', 'John', 'Doyle', 'stage', 'version', 'killings', 'were', 'handled', 'much', 'subtler', 'more', 'creative', 'more', 'effective', 'way', 'Blood', 'spattered', 'cloths', 'conveyed', 'same', 'message.In', 'eliminating', 'operatic', 'chorus', 'episodes', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'failed', 'present', 'collective', 'response', 'Sweeney', 'atrocities.A', 'grim', 'great', 'piece', 'work', 'overly', 'bloody', 'triumphantly', 'executed']",N/A
1133633,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B001209SMS,John Kwok,"[3, 4]","Much to my amazement, Tim Burton has crafted a well-realized adaptation of this classic Stephen Sondheim musical.  He has paid ample attention to Sweeney Todd's dark, despicable turn-of-the-century (19th Century) London, and to its denizens, as though this was a film adaptation of the Brecht-Weill opera, ""Threepenny Opera"". This film adaptation is a worthy addition to all of the great Broadway musicals that have been translated successfully into film, most notably for the brilliantly acted - and well sung - performance of Sweeney Todd by Johnny Depp (I also recommend it for the lush, well-played orchestral score by an orchestra of British musicians.). Depp's intensely vivid portrayal is truly mesmerizing, and his superb acting is effectively demonstrated too in his untrained, but emotionally intense, singing. Other excellent singers include both the surprising Alan Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen. Even Helena Bonham Carter - whose voice isn't nearly as strong as Depp's - is quite convincing as Mrs. Lovett.

1133635,A3F6Y0ZPIPQ9SA,B001209SMS,Jonathan May,"[0, 0]","I've seen Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd three times on DVD (after seeing it once in a movie theater). I say Burton's Sweeney on purpose: this is not what I would consider Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney. Never before this production has Sweeney Todd seemed wispy to me. But wispy seems the principal mode of all Burton's films (working best in Ed Wood and to some extent Corpse Bride, but disastrous in his Batman films). Every production I have seen of Sweeney, including the original Broadway production many times with Angela Lansbury and once with the replacement cast, has been vibrant and bold, not enervated and wan like this film. And removing ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" (even if Sondheim went along with it) takes away the spine of the work. I've seen a production of the work (and this includes the other two DVDs, the production at Circle in the Square, and a wonderful production at the University of Alabama in which stage blood was not used) that seemed so bloodless, in spite of the gallons of fake blood splashed around in this movie as if to try to create some sense of tension or excitement). Always before the characters and the setting have seemed incredibly vivid. In Burton's film, all color is washed out of setting and performance (other than the fake red).In defense of Helena Bonham Carter, my sense is that her lackluster performance is a result of Burton's conception and direction. She can pull out the necessary stops when required (see her performance in David Fincher's Fight Club, and speaking of Fincher, too bad he didn't direct the film). In The King's Speech she had much more spunk than she did as Mrs. Lovett. And whose idea was it to give Mrs. Lovett signs of second thoughts, of hesitation, of conscience? Mrs. Lovett is a great steamroller of a character who would have stuffed that particular genius in the meat grinder without a sign of remorse. Yes, Johnny Depp is better than acceptable much of the time, but his performance too suffers from being held back.One of the horrors of the film, its truest horror, is what Burton did to ""A Little Priest."" On stage the principals are regarding each other, egging the other one on to a serious folie deux. In the film they are looking across the street and commenting on what they see. The song mentions a priest? Show a priest. A grocer? Show a grocer. A Royal Marine? Well, guess what! And then the song simply peters out.Oh, I could go on, but why bother.Yes, it is the best ""movie"" so far made from a Sondheim work. If you've seen the others, you know that this is not high praise. Is it a bore? No. It is simply a B-grade version of one of the great theatrical works of the last century. Is it a triumph?

1133636,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B001209SMS,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[2, 2]","Honestly, I often hate horror films. They have so many gross zombies and visuals these days that I hate watching most of them (especially ""Jeepers Creepers""). But some of the best bloody horror films are so honorable that stay in my memory for the longest time.And, believe it or not, ""Sweeney Todd"" is that kind of horror film. It is my favorite movie of 2007. There's nothing better than watching Johnny Depp sing happy melodies while he cuts the throats of gentlemen and politicians. For some reason, it's so relieving to watch them die, because I really haven't liked too many politicians lately.Don't ask me why, but there's something hilarious about listening to Helena Bonham Carter sing about making meat pies out of the rich people walking on the street. It's gory to watch Depp slit their throats, but I enjoyed watching Depp's character, Sweeney Todd, and Mrs. Lovett make mince meat out of them. No, really. They make meat pies out of them.I hope I didn't scare you away with these gross details, because this is a great musical about rotten people. This is a great musical about rotten judicial officials with sexist attitudes. This is a great musical about the rotten people who dream obsessively of killing them. In this case, Sweeny, also known as Benjamin Barker, was unfairly accused of outrageous crimes. Judge Turpin raped his wife, and according to Mrs. Lovett, Benjamin's wife committed suicide. Now after his 15 years in prison, Barker is out for revenge against Judge Turpin, the man who punished him and killed his wife.This is also a dark comedy that takes a great twist when Mrs. Lovett convinces Todd to kill the rich hypocrites who make the poor beggars miserable. It's true that they shouldn't hoard all the money, but there's something outrageously wrong about actually killing them. Thankfully, ""Sweeny Todd"" is one of the few movies that enables viewers to watch the rich people get killed, with the grateful knowledge that this is just a movie (thank goodness).I'm not going to give away the ending either, but I will point out that there is a big surprise in the end about Sweeny Todd's wife that reveals many things. Most importantly, it shows how shallow and gruesome revenge is. In a way, the movie feels far more morally just than ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""No Country for Old Men."" And there is even more stunning end to Sweeny's killing spree that puts everything into perspective.Even though this is a very bloody movie, it is a musical as well. And for some reason, it's actually amusing to watch Sweeny prepare for killing Turpin in the barber's chair while they're both singing about ""Pretty Women."" All the dark sardonic humor was so funny that the movie didn't feel like a violent film.However, I do have to say that immediately after watching this film, I might think twice about eating meat pies for awhile...[Edit: I just listened to the broadway musical album and I have to say that the musical had a completely different tone. I enjoyed the singing in the musical more than the movie (especially Angela Langsbury). While I still give this a high rating, keep in mind that the movie is much more grim than the musical, with geysers of blood coming from peoples' necks.]",5,A Bloody Great Musical,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,3219,"['Honestly', 'often', 'hate', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'gross', 'zombies', 'visuals', 'days', 'hate', 'watching', 'most', 'especially', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'best', 'bloody', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'honorable', 'stay', 'memory', 'longest', 'time.And', 'believe', 'not', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'kind', 'horror', 'film', 'favorite', 'movie', '2007', 'nothing', 'better', 'watching', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'sing', 'happy', 'melodies', 'throats', 'gentlemen', 'politicians', 'reason', 'so', 'relieving', 'watch', 'die', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'liked', 'too', 'many', 'politicians', 'lately.Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'something', 'hilarious', 'listening', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'sing', 'making', 'meat', 'pies', 'rich', 'people', 'walking', 'street', 'gory', 'watch', 'Depp', 'slit', 'throats', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Depp', 'character', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'make', 'mince', 'meat', 'No', 'really', 'make', 'meat', 'pies', 'them.I', 'hope', 'did', ""n't"", 'scare', 'away', 'gross', 'details', 'great', 'musical', 'rotten', 'people', 'great', 'musical', 'rotten', 'judicial', 'officials', 'sexist', 'attitudes', 'great', 'musical', 'rotten', 'people', 'who', 'dream', 'obsessively', 'killing', 'case', 'Sweeny', 'also', 'known', 'Benjamin', 'Barker', 'was', 'unfairly', 'accused', 'outrageous', 'crimes', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'raped', 'wife', 'according', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Benjamin', 'wife', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Now', '15', 'years', 'prison', 'Barker', 'out', 'revenge', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'man', 'who', 'punished', 'killed', 'wife.This', 'also', 'dark', 'comedy', 'great', 'twist', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Todd', 'kill', 'rich', 'hypocrites', 'who', 'make', 'poor', 'beggars', 'miserable', 'true', 'should', ""n't"", 'hoard', 'money', 'something', 'outrageously', 'wrong', 'actually', 'killing', 'Thankfully', 'Sweeny', 'Todd', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'viewers', 'watch', 'rich', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'grateful', 'knowledge', 'just', 'movie', 'thank', 'goodness', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'big', 'surprise', 'end', 'Sweeny', 'Todd', 'wife', 'many', 'things', 'Most', 'importantly', 'how', 'shallow', 'gruesome', 'revenge', 'way', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'morally', 'just', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'even', 'more', 'stunning', 'end', 'Sweeny', 'killing', 'spree', 'everything', 'perspective.Even', 'very', 'bloody', 'movie', 'musical', 'well', 'reason', 'actually', 'amusing', 'watch', 'Sweeny', 'prepare', 'killing', 'Turpin', 'barber', 'chair', ""'re"", 'singing', 'Pretty', 'Women', 'dark', 'sardonic', 'humor', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'violent', 'film.However', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'immediately', 'watching', 'film', 'might', 'think', 'twice', 'eating', 'meat', 'pies', 'awhile', '[', 'Edit', 'just', 'listened', 'broadway', 'musical', 'album', 'have', 'say', 'musical', 'had', 'completely', 'different', 'tone', 'enjoyed', 'singing', 'musical', 'more', 'movie', 'especially', 'Angela', 'Langsbury', 'still', 'give', 'high', 'rating', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'grim', 'musical', 'geysers', 'blood', 'coming', 'peoples', 'necks', ']']",N/A

There have been some attempts in the past, a made for cable movie here and there, but nothing like this. I have to eat my words. In all honesty, I truly HATE musicals. I despise The Sound of Music, Annie and I didn't like the Phantom of the Opera. However, the subject of Sweeney Todd being a dark one, and Tim Burton putting his vision into it, I truly enjoyed it. Dark humor and Tim Burton's art plastered on screen...it was as much a treat for the eyes as it was for the ears.In past film reviews of other Tim Burton films, I've read reviews written by others about how ""Tim Burton has lost his creative edge and originality. His use of Johnny Depp in nearly all the films he's directed is proof of such. ""I beg to differ. After seeing Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd, he is truly a gifted actor and deserves far more credit than given. It's not much different that a sports team drafting the best player, and wanting to keep him on the team, and Depp is an all star on the screen.Its the rare actor or director(in my opinion)that takes chances and steps out of his bubble to do new material and take on different roles besides the ones he's been type cast for. Sure, you see Tom Cruise and a few others take a small risk here and there, but they typically stick with the ""rolls"" written for them. They just want to play it safe. Mind you, Johnny Depp did all his own singing in Sweeney Todd, how many other actors go out on a limb and do that? Not too many.So, setting all else aside, this rich and interesting story which is largely based upon urban legend if you will...Sweeney Todd is a man who is out for vengeance. Wrongfully persecuted, he returns 15 years later to London, ""the pit of the world.""He has one thing and only one thing in mind, ""never forgive, never forget""...and he plans his vengeance upon those who destroyed his life.He meets Mrs. Lovett, where they conspire to do in all by Sweeney promising ""the closest shave in your life"", which is nothing short of having your throat cut and being made into Mrs. Lovett's meat pies. Of which, once were the worst in London and all of Fleet Street, are now the most famous. One after the other, Sweeney gets his revenge cutting throats until it reaches its tragic climax.

And, I was entertained, though I scraped over the bare patches of the director's self-indulgence with some discomfort.The acting was good to very good, and the enterprise well cast.  But the clotted, muddy sound quality didn't help me understand Bonham-Carter's cockney mutterings and mewings.However, the decors and atmosphere appeared to me to be grand guignolish, heavy-handed and opressive to a degree.  Perhaps Burton took his cue from ST's opening song about London?  Still, it was as if the story itself wasn't poignant and horrible enough; the director encouraged the designers to underline and bold every puncuation mark and seraph with spooky-wooky horror until the whole thing -- including particularly the final scenes in the underground abbatoir -- simply became a ride through a Spook House with Auschwitz touches.  Overdone.  A little restraint even in (the depiction of) throat-slitting would have been appreciated.However, light, mordantly comic moments included big bugs in the dough Mrs. Lovitt kneaded.  Very nice.  Like the entire enterprise itself, ultra-Dickensian.  The flair and subtlety with which she brought to life the slovenly, desparate amorality of the character was rewarding.  Obviously, the expedience required for survival in a life of filth, facilitates the entrepreneurial skill needed to exploit commercially profitable cannibalism.

I have read some of Amazon's reviews and I must say many customers don't know what a genius Stephen Sondheim is.  He is the voice of the American musical.  Listen to the score of Sweeney Todd. It is complex, tuneful and operatic.  No, it is not popular music but it is music that is integrated into the characters and their tragic downfalls. Johnny Depp, Helena-Bowen-Carter Alan Rickman are all superb in their respective roles.  The production is impeccable.Tim Burton and Stephen Sondheim lowered the scope of the play.  On stage, it was Brecthian world view. The film reduces that scope and I do miss it but, the film  is so personal that the tragic ending seems all the more touching.  2007-2008 was a banner year for the screen musical.

1133644,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,B001209SMS,JR Pinto,"[4, 6]","Sweeney Todd is one of the few perfect Broadway shows ever written.  If there was ever a person to bring it to the big screen, it would be Tim Burton.  The result - one of the best movie musicals ever made.  Burton gets the look and the tone right.  What's more, he has the ability to fully integrate the songs into the action.  In too many of the recent movie adaptations, the actors sing awkwardly as the try to make it more ""cinematic"" with stage business.  Burton has the courage (and the talent) to allow the camera to stay in an uncut close-up of Johnny Depp's face as he sings to his razors.Now, there are some flaws in the film.  The one that most people comment on is that the actors don't really have strong singing voices; this is true, but it kind of works for the movie.  Also, the score has been slashed somewhat - most notably, ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,"" which was my favorite song in the show!  On the bright side, it is kept as an instrumental piece throughout the picture.  Some people complain about the amount of blood in the picture, but I really can't give these criticisms much credence - this is Sweeney Todd after all...don't they know what the story is about?  I mean, it's not The Barber of Seville.All that being said, I am still going to make use of my DVD of the stage production of Sweeney Todd.  Angela Lansbury's performance as Mrs. Lovett was one of the great musical performances of all time.  As the filmmakers are at pains to point out, this is not simply a filming of the stage show - it is its own entity.  That is a good thing - it means that Sweeney will be continued to be revived on stage for as long as people have, er...good taste.",5,TEN STARS!!!,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,1679,"['Sweeney', 'Todd', 'one', 'few', 'perfect', 'Broadway', 'ever', 'written', 'was', 'ever', 'person', 'bring', 'big', 'screen', 'would', 'be', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'result', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'musicals', 'ever', 'made', 'Burton', 'look', 'tone', 'right', 'What', 'more', 'ability', 'fully', 'integrate', 'songs', 'action', 'too', 'many', 'recent', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'actors', 'sing', 'awkwardly', 'try', 'make', 'more', 'cinematic', 'stage', 'business', 'Burton', 'courage', 'talent', 'allow', 'camera', 'stay', 'uncut', 'close-up', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'face', 'razors.Now', 'are', 'flaws', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'people', 'comment', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'strong', 'singing', 'voices', 'true', 'kind', 'works', 'movie', 'Also', 'score', 'been', 'slashed', 'somewhat', 'most', 'notably', 'Ballad', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'was', 'favorite', 'song', 'show', 'bright', 'side', 'kept', 'instrumental', 'piece', 'picture', 'people', 'complain', 'amount', 'blood', 'picture', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'criticisms', 'much', 'credence', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'story', 'mean', 'not', 'Barber', 'Seville.All', 'being', 'said', 'am', 'still', 'going', 'make', 'use', 'DVD', 'stage', 'production', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'performance', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'musical', 'performances', 'time', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'pains', 'point', 'out', 'not', 'simply', 'filming', 'stage', 'show', 'own', 'entity', 'good', 'thing', 'Sweeney', 'will', 'be', 'continued', 'be', 'revived', 'stage', 'as', 'long', 'people', 'have', 'er', 'good', 'taste']",N/A

1133646,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001209SMS,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 14]","I hate musicals, I figured I'd go ahead and get that little tidbit of information out of the way early, but for some reason I thought that I might actually enjoy Tim Burton's recently released ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" starring Johnny Depp (""Sleepy Hollow""), Helena Bonham Carter (`Harry Potter' series), and Alan Rickman (`Harry Potter' series). To clarify, in case anyone is curious I don't consider Disney's numerous animated films (which I am generally a fan of) to be musicals even though they contain 4 or 5 musical numbers, so those movies don't count. I do know the reason behind my decision to view this movie; it was because I had heard that this musical was not like most musicals in that it didn't contain choreographed movements in sync with the musical score, big song and dance numbers, and that it actually felt more like a normal movie. So, like an idiot I listened and thought that there was actually a chance that I would enjoy this movie, and I honestly did give it a chance even though I loath these types of films, because I am a fan of Johnny Depp's and Tim Burton's (to an extent), so I thought those two people alone may make this a more tolerable musical than most; however, I was wrong.""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is the story of a talented barber (Johnny Depp) who is wrongfully imprisoned by a corrupt judge (Alan Rickman) who wants to steal his wife away. After spending 15 years locked up, the barber is released and has changed his name to Sweeney Todd, but his name isn't the only thing that has changed over the years. Sweeney is no longer the sweet, charming barber he once was, in his place is a man consumed by darkness and a deep-seeded thirst for vengeance, and his thirst will be quenched and no one will stand in his way.Let this movie be a lesson to me to never rent a musical again for myself, no matter how interesting it appears to be. Because no matter how hard the moviemaker tries to make the musical more mainstream and more like a normal movie, so long as they are staying true to the source material the annoyances will remain intact. I will say that I do respect the various filmmakers who tackle musicals for doing their best to remain as faithful to the source material as possible in a two hour film. If I was a fan of musicals and some hack director tried to adapt one of my favorites and butchered it or changed it too much, then I would be extremely frustrated and angry with Hollywood's need for updating or changing what has worked so well in other mediums to better suit their needs. I only say this because as a comic book fan and video game fan, I hate it when some Hollywood hotshot deems himself worthy of changing and manipulating my favorite characters to what he/she believes they should be, regardless of the source material. So, take note all you directors out there looking to adapt comics, games, books, and any other media into feature films, fans enjoy the movies better when you stay true to the roots of the material you are adapting. Now, I understand that some things need to be changed for the translation on the big screen to be more believable; however, there is a limit to how much can be changed before any semblance of the material is lost and it no longer seems to be an adaptation but instead seems like a re-imagining that can not even hope to hold a candle to the quality of the source material.What annoys me about musicals, which I alluded to earlier, is the way that musicals always seem to force the characters to choreograph their movements to the beat of the music throughout the scene. When this occurs it becomes so glaringly obvious and forced to me, that it tends to distract me; therefore taking away from the scene and my enjoyment in the movie. Now, thankfully Tim Burton didn't allow this to happen too many times throughout the movie, but in the scenes it did occur in, they tended to be the ones I least enjoyed, not that there were too many that I found all that enjoyable to begin with. Another cause for complaint to me is during some of the big musical numbers some character can just walk in the room and instantly know the song being sung, and just join in as if they'd been there all along. This annoys me even further when it's a song being sung by two characters that have not met prior, yet they each know the song perfectly and can sing in perfect harmony during the choruses. If this was a normal movie and someone came into a scene opposite a character he/she had never met before, and instantly knew what to say and what the other person may say, this would seem forced and poorly written, but in a musical it's just accepted as normal. I just don't get it. Now, I know you may be thinking that Disney's animated films do this annoying kind of thing all the time by having numerous character join in on the big musical numbers and know all of the words to the song even though there should be absolutely no way they could possibly know them, and yet I enjoy those films; but, as I said before I don't view Disney movies as musicals so I give them some leeway. Go ahead, call me a hypocrite, I admit it, when it comes to this kind of thing, I am. My final gripe is why in a musical does it seem like too much to ask for the characters to go more than 3 minutes without singing, just because it's a musical film doesn't mean there has to be almost constant music, a little more of a break between the big, and even somewhat smaller, musical numbers would have been much appreciated and may have let me enjoy the movie a bit more.From an acting standpoint, the cast did a good job, and for a person who hates musicals they all handled their songs very well, which is surprising given that Johnny Depp has admitted that he had no idea if he could sing or not prior to accepting the role of Sweeney, and he actually had a decent voice. Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman were very good as Ms. Lovett and Judge Turpin respectively, both had very good singing voices and both portrayed the underlying, duplicitous nature of their characters perfectly, though Rickman's was more overt than Helena's had to be. Regarding all the various actors' appearances in the movie, I hate the way Tim Burton always makes his characters somewhat pale and looking as if their eyes are sunken in. This particular look makes Helena (who also happens to be Burton's significant other) look somewhat ugly and unhealthy, not that she's the most glamorous looking woman in Hollywood, but she does look better than he allowed her to look in this film, though I suppose her look did fit the character more than her natural appearance would have. Sacha Baron Cohen was alright in what was essentially a cameo role in the film as a rival barber, he did seem to be a bit over the top and annoying in his scenes, and maybe that was what his character was supposed to be like, but it just irritated me, and I couldn't wait for his departure from the movie. The remainder of the cast was good, though not particularly memorable, and most seemed to be nothing more than fodder for Sweeney to practice on as he prepared for his ultimate goal of killing Judge Turpin.I will give Tim Burton this, he knows how to make a movie all his own. From the cinematography, to the special effects, the make-up, even to the actors, you can always tell you're watching a Tim Burton film the minute you see a scene or two, because his style is just so distinct that no other director seems remotely capable of copying it. So kudos to him for his innovative sense of style and direction, it's rare for someone in Hollywood to be able to reach the level of success that he has without there being at least some copycats out there trying to do exactly as he does. Aside from Burton's penchant for the semi-goth appearance for most of the characters in his films, I find myself generally enjoying his movies on some level, though they may not always be favorites of mine they are at least worth watching once, but I do believe that for me ""Sweeney Todd"" is pushing it. I am surprised that Tim stayed as true to the musical as he could, since he admits during the special features for the movie that he is not a fan of musicals, yet for some reason this one seemed to strike a chord with him. So I at least appreciate that he took great care to stay mostly true to the original material, which I'm sure made many fans and critics happy.I'm sure by this point, you readers are not at all surprised to learn that I will not watch this movie ever again, and find it hard to recommend it to anyone. However, if you are a fan of musicals you will probably enjoy this film, though be warned it is extremely violent during the latter half of the movie, so if you are somewhat squeamish you may not like it as much. If you are someone like me who doesn't enjoy musicals, but still find yourself curious to see if this one would be different, take it from me, aside from the violence (which was actually when the movie began to feel a bit more like a normal movie to me and become a little more tolerable), this musical is just like all the others, full of all the annoying qualities that one has come to expect from them.""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is rated R for violence and brief language.",2,"Never Forget, Never Forgive, Never Watch This Movie Again...",1208044800,"04 13,

A macabre musical with truly dark humor, a full blown goth melodrama released for Christmas?  Tim Burton's vision doesn't disappoint and proves that you can achieve marvelous things working with the ones you love.  This film is incredibly fun and beautiful, and I would highly recommend it.  It's obviously not for everyone, but that said, it is masterful.Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman turn in the strongest performances; truly a joy to watch.Although I am a huge fan of Mr. Depp, and I enjoy his work in this film very much, Johnny seems to be relying on his bag of tricks in this portrayal of Sweeney Todd, rather than creating a unique character out of whole cloth.  I caught too many glimpses of Edward Scissorhands for my liking; it was a distraction to someone familiar with his other work.  But once again, Depp proves himself to be the most courageous artist in film today.  Honestly, who else could have played this impossible part, and pulled it off with such panache?My teenage daughters and I saw this film several times in the theatre and eagerly await its release on DVD.

1133648,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001209SMS,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[3, 4]","I have seen many incarnations of Sweeny Todd on stage.  I am originally from LA, and frequently had a friend in a production somewhere.  Let me say up front, that I do not like this play/musical.  I never have.  The blood and violence have always seemed an unappealing subject for a musical, especially in juxtaposition to Sondheim's wonderful score.  However, my not liking the subject matter does NOT preclude me from recognizing and enjoying an outstanding production and an amazing performance.I am not certain that anyone other than Tim Burton and Johnny Depp could have pulled off this masterpiece.  Tim Burton was an inspired choice as director; unique and quirky enough to bring Sondheim's bizarre vision to the big screen. The cinematography was perfect:  the mood, color pallet, camera angles, and editing all adding to the brilliance.  The color choice for and ""performance"" of the blood actually made the blood itself another character in the story.When I first heard of Johnny Depp's selection to play Sweeny Todd, my initial reaction was ""Really?,"" and then, ""Maybe...""  Johnny Depp's performance is truly outstanding. This film raises his acting credentials to a whole new level.  Depp owns this role, playing it will the prefect combination of drama, comedy, and, yes, just a touch of camp.  The emotions are real, deep, and believed; Depp commits 300% to the character.  And guess what?  He can sing.  I admit to being shocked by that.  His voice is very appropriate to the character and pleasant to listen to.  Is it a big, Broadway voice?  No.  But what it lacks in power, he certainly surpasses in pathos.  The interpretation and emotion of the songs are a true revelation to the depths of Depp's talent.The rest of the cast simply strengthens this production even further.  Allan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, even an extremely brief appearance by Anthony Stewart Head, as well as host of others, all add talent, depth, and excellence.These actors and this director truly do justice to this strange and odd musical.  The film did not disappoint; I was actually riveted.  IMHO, this is one of the best movies of the year and a truly inspired performance by Johnny Depp.  If you like Sondheim, Burton, Depp, musicals, or even blood and gore, I highly recommend this amazing film.",5,The Demon Barber of Fleet...Street.

Gelwasser,"[0, 0]","Here it is Halloween, and it seems like a good time to write a review for Tim Burton's film, ""Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"". This is Burton's cinematic adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's ghoulishly, over-the-top, classic Broadway musical of murder and revenge with a smile.The story takes place in grim, urban, Victorian-era London. Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), a skilled barber by trade, has come back to town under the new identity of 'Sweeny Todd'. For fifteen years Todd/Barker had been falsely imprisoned on trumped-up charges. This had been brought about by the self-rightious, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who had coveted, Todd's young, pretty wife, Lucy, for himself. Todd returns home only to find out his wife has supposably died of self-poisoning and his teenage daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) is now the ward of the lascivious, Judge. Todd, with the help of landlady/pie maker, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), obsessively follows through on a bloody, murderous plan to get his revenge on all those he feels ""deserve to die"" and ultimately get Judge Turpin into the barber's chair ""for the closest shave of his life"".Sounds like black stuff, right? Well yeah, it is...black as night. But it is written as a tragedy, that has both a wink and and a small smile and a truely hummable, toe tappin' soundtrack. In the end its sort of like a perverse tribute to our culture's love of family. Its a musical for the 'Goth Kids'. But if your not into copious amounts of blood being spilled with a straight razor, while people are singing, then this isn't the film for you. For everyone else with a morbid, Charles Adams sense of humor, this movie is fantastic! Its emotionally moving, funny and entertaining!

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 2]","Stephen Sondheim's wonderful ""Sweeney Todd"" gets a superbly creepy and gory treatment from Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.  My knowledge of musicals goes only as far as ""My Fair Lady,"" ""Camelot,"" and ""The Sound Of Music,"" so I will review this particular musical as a fan of Depp, Burton and Helena Bonham Carter, among others in the production.  First of all, Burton sets a dark and gloomy tone for the story as it opens on Todd's return to London.  He has been away for fifteen years in a prison for a crime he did not commit.  When he arrives on the streets, revenge is in his heart.  We also meet a young sailor named Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower), who will play a key role later in the story.  Todd returns to his barber shop where his family is no more.  He learns from one Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter), that his wife has committed suicide and his daughter is being held captive at the home of Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who is the source of all of Todd's turmoil.  This sets into motion a brilliant story of revenge, internal struggle, and all-out violence.  Todd and Lovett conspire to get revenge not on the judge alone, but any and every person of high importance.  From vicar to royal, no one is safe.The brilliance of this story is built not on just the music and atmosphere, but on the performances of the actors as well.  Depp is sinister as the wronged Todd.  Bonham Carter plays the longing romantic in love with Todd perfectly.  Rickman and Timothy Spall (Beadle) outdo themselves with their characters.  Young Ed Sanders plays the highly loyal and overprotective Toby and, in my opinion, delivers one of the best performances in the film.  Sacha Baron Cohen (yep, Borat) surprised me with his portrayal of Pirelli, a devious con man out to blackmail Todd.  Also of note is a brief cameo from Anthony Head.There is plenty of blood in this film.  Lots of it.  Tons of it.  Although not as garish as modern zombie films, when the blood flows, it sprays walls, faces, and just about anything within reach.  If you cannot handle gore, you may not want to watch this.  What's bizarre is that in all of this film, only the bright red color of the blood stands apart from the gloominess of the rest of the story.I highly recommend this film to fans of Depp, Bonham Carter, Burton or Rickman.

Now Barker's back in London, going by the name of Sweeney Todd, and he's ready for revenge against the judge, his Beadle, and anyone else who crosses him.

It is stylishly-filmed in near-sepia tones, except for the occasional splatter of blood, which is a lovely nail-polish shade of red.  The sets, lighting, costumes, and makeup accentuate the feeling of madness and desperation, and create a grim fantasy.  Depp sings well and gives a strong performance as the unusual hero, but he didn't fit the role for me (having seen the stage version).  He still looked young enough to playEdward Scissorhands, whom he strongly resembles here.  Carter is fine as the disheveled pie-maker, but again, I felt there was too much emphasis on the macabre makeup, hair, and wardrobe, and she was too young as well.Overall, it's an impressive film, full of grand music, comic and sinister characters, and a good story about settling old scores.

1133658,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B001209SMS,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[1, 2]","Johnny Depp adds to his offbeat body of work by bringing Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET to the screen. Of particular note is Depp's film debut as a singer. Richard Harris he isn't, but he'll do.This is the based-on-fact story of Sweeney Todd, a London barber falsely convicted of a crime in the Victorian London of Jack The Ripper. Himself Transported, his wife and child are left to the tender mercies of the heartless Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). When Todd returns to London fifteen years later, he vows vengeance on Turpin.Enter the bizarre Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who owns what must be the worst dining establishment in the world, specializing in cats'-meat pies, mealy worm buns, and other gastronomical grotesqueries. They make a lovely couple, both being gothic pale, wild-haired, sunken-eyed, and rotten-mouthed to boot. Depp sports a white thunderbolt streak in his hair, a la Elsa Lanchester in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and is armed with wickedly sharp straight razors.Deciding that the world is as rotten as his teeth, Sweeney Todd begins joylessly slashing carotid arteries and venting jugular veins. His barber chair is cleverly arranged to dump his hapless customers down a chute to the basement, where Mrs. Lovett has her bakehouse. Tired of serving cat canapes, and complaining that ""a pussy is only good for six men,"" Mrs. Lovett improves the fare at her establishment by serving Sweeney Todd's customers to her own. Business booms.This kill 'em-and-cook 'em routine ends only with the eventual visit of Judge Turpin to Sweeney Todd's tonsorial parlour, where the not-so-good Judge gets the closest shave of his life.Calling SWEENEY TODD a ""black comedy"" is to paint it several shades too bright. Director Tim Burton captures the weirdness of Mr. Todd and Mrs. Lovett perfectly in his casting of Depp and Bonham Carter, but he errs in relying on an almost Warholian atmosphere of gore to structure this film. Likewise, the use of obscenity (""$&!%"" instead of wit) detracts from the production. (Having not seen the stage play, I may be too unkind to Mr. Burton, as he may only be following in Mr. Sondheim's footsteps, but the criticism still applies creatively.) Other reviewers have said that only half the songs of the stage play make it onto film, but perhaps that is not all bad. Every twitched eyebrow in a musical does not require the cast to burst into song, a fact that playwrights like Sondheim and Lloyd Webber seem to have forgotten. I found several of the songs in SWEENEY TODD to be self-indulgent in that regard.As to the singing, Depp does well, Bonham Carter does better, and the rest of the cast merely vocalizes.

This is how the story goes: After being sent away by Judge Turpin, Sweeney Todd a.k.a Benjamin Barker returns to London with the help of a sailor, Anthony Hope. He opens a barber shop above Mrs. Lovett's Meat Pie Shop, where she sells ""the worst pies in London."" With the help of Mrs. Lovett, Todd means to rid London of the corrupt aristocracy, and hopes to be reunited with his daughter, Johanna, who is now Judge Turpin's ward. The cast led by Johnny Depp (in one of his best performances as Sweeney Todd), Helena Bonham Carter (Burton's fiancee) (excellent as Mrs. Lovett) and Alan Rickman (also excellent as Judge Turpin) is excellent! The directing by Tim Burton (who has directed Depp six times and Carter five times, both of them, most notably together in ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" (2005) & ""Corpse Bride"" (2005) is extraordinary and excellent and he is at his best! The screenplay (which is based on Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical and Christopher Bond's adaptation) by John Logan (who also wrote the screenplay to the upcoming ""Lincoln"" (2009), he also did ""The Aviator"" (2004) (story and screenplay), ""The Last Samurai"" (2003) (story and screenplay), ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (2002) (story and screenplay), ""The Time Machine"" (2002) (screenplay) & ""Gladiator"" (2000) is brilliant! The music by Stephen Sondheim is brilliantly extraordinary. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (who also did the cinematography to the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" trilogy (2003, 2006, & 2007), and the upcoming ""Eagle Eye"" (2008) is excellent! The film editing by Chris Lebenzon (who has worked with Burton since ""Batman Returns"" (1992), he will also did Burton's upcoming ""Frankenweenie"" (2009) & ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010) is excellent! The casting by Susie Figgis (who also did the casting to ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" & ""Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone"" (2001) is excellent! The production design by Dante Ferretti (who also did the Oscar-winning production design to ""The Aviator"", he is also did the upcoming ""Ripley's Believe It Or Not!"" (2009), & ""Shutter Island"" (2009) is brilliant! The set decoration by Francesca Lo Schiavo (Ferretti's wife) (who also shared the Oscar with her husband for her work on ""The Aviator"") is brilliant!

This is however, the best musical of last year, surpassing ""Hairspray"" (2007) in that honor.

1133660,A1HNTJ0BTXZYCU,B001209SMS,Larry A. Verdugo,"[2, 2]","To place the whole of Sweeney Todd on film would probably have produced a four hour plus movie that no one one--or, better--only the most ardent Sondheim fan would sit through. Having said that, however, it's sad that so much of the score had to be jettisoned. I refer mainly to the son ""Kiss Me,"" a number that blended with the beadle's ""Ladies in Their Sensitivities"" to create a wonderful quartet. Too, all of the choral sections are gone, leaving the number during which Mrs. Lovett sells her pies sounding half done. One commentator on the operas of Richard Wagner noted that when huge chunks of material are eliminated from that master's 5 hour plus works, the result simply sound like a longer work that has been cut, proportion is gone and musical moments lose context. Something of that happens to ""Sweeney Todd."" Certain numbers, the beadle's song noted above and Pirelli's solo sound incomplete and over before they have a chance to register. Friends who were not familiar with the show and with whom I attended a screening commented that they felt that the movie did not emotionally engage them. I suspect that these cuts contributed to this feeling.While I found most of the cast, including Johnny Depp, able to convey the spirit of the score, Helen Bonham Carter simply was out of her depth. Aside from the fact that there was not a lot to her characterization, it was just plain difficult to understand her. Thus, many of the lyrics of ""Priest"" were not understood by those who went with me, leaving them bewildered by what was going on. I understand that Angela Landsbury's over the top performance would be out of place in Burton's atmosphere but I kept longing for some of her zany spirit to surface somwhere during the proceedings,if only during ""The Worst Pies in London,"" a song that simply is beyond Carter's abilities to perform.Even with the flaws noted above, ""Sweeney Todd"" remains a remarkable accomplishment and a film that preserves much of what makes Sondheims's work the masterpiece that it is.

It's got Tim Burton behind the camera and Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alan Rickman in front of it. The violence is artful and the atmosphere is evocative and nightmarish. The performances (musical and otherwise) are powerful, forceful, and darkly beautiful. The setting is a hideously gorgeous portrait of old London as seen through a black and shattered mirror, a monolithic metropolitan nightmare collapsing into a sea of grime and dirt and human cruelty. Its surreal realism is classic Burton. The story is one of revenge, obsession, insanity, murder, and corruption, full of twisted morality and mangled romance. It keeps viewers interested. The songs are great, too: They advance the plot and keep the feel alive. And the blood-soaked ending is just plain superb.

For everyone else, bon apetit.Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, a Gothic musical thriller set in 19th Century London, is a tale of revenge, murder, cannibalism, rape, corruption and madness. It's told through Stephen Sondheim's hyper-intelligent, tongue-in-cheek lyrics and Tim Burton's mad-cap and macabre aesthetic. Burton films Sweeney Todd in an over-the-top stylized manner, reminiscent of the German Expressionist horror movies; with mad angles. The London he creates is a bleak, Dickensian cityscape of skeletal buildings and depressing gray skies that rain dark drops of blood. The characters that inhabit such a city are dark and drab to match their surroundings, or brightly flamboyant in colors as lurid as their characters. If such a visual style sounds almost cartoonish, it is; and it works. For a story as dark and morbid as Sweeney Todd, an unworldly aesthetic is needed to keep the world from resembling our own too closely.The story is simple and dark as a Grimm's fairy tale. Sweeney Todd was banished to prison by a corrupt judge who lusted after Todd(tm)s wife. After twenty years, Todd returns to London to find that his wife is dead and the lecherous judge has adopted his daughter. Bent on revenge, Todd returns to his original home and profession, opening a barbershop in the home of his old neighbor, Mrs. Lovett. But the road to revenge is never straight and when more bodies begin to pile up than were expected, Mrs. Lovett comes up with an ingenious plan to dispose of them and improve her failing meat-pie business at the same time. This grisly tale is told through Sondheim's brilliant songs, sometimes haunting, sometimes hilarious, always memorable.

The movie is dark, set in Victorian London, and makeup frames the characters as ghoulish.Then there is the music - no song stands out and it seems like opera - just singing the lines that should be spoken.  A horror movie musical - I guess that is a joke in itself.The story is dark and too long.  Sweeney was put in prison by a judge who had fallen in love with Sweeney's wife.  He took Sweeney's wife and baby daughter as prisoners in the his home.  After many years, Sweeney returns to London to take revenge on the judge and find his wife and daughter.He goes to the pie shop owned by Mrs. Lovett who only wants to please Sweeney.  His old barber razors were hidden in the floorboards.  They are sharp and shiny.Sweeney plans on killing the judge in the barber chair by slitting his throat.  The first time he gets the judge in the chair, he is interrupted and the judge leaves alive.Soon Sweeney develops a barber chair that flips the dead clients down a chute that leads to Mrs. Lovett's oven.  She cooks the people Sweeney kills into tasty meat pies.Sweeney is shown slitting throats - one after another and then pushing the chair's lever and they slide down to the basement - bloody and dead.  All this while music plays, and hard to understand singing is flowing through the scenes.The humor is dark - tongue in cheek - and tiresome.  The blood is spurting and the story is depressing.

Its dark photography and over the top set design try to imbue the film with atmosphere, but the techniques employed are so self-conscious as to have the opposite effect.  The result is a visually flat, monochromic film without flair or genuine imagination.Johnny Depp's acting performance is the film's only saving grace, but a singer he is not.  Then again, he is Pavarotti compared to the rest of the cast, especially Helena Bonham Carter, whose voice is so thin that she sounds like an ailing Minnie Mouse on helium.  With her rat's nest hairdo, she looks like a female counterpart of Tim Burton, which is a shame since she is an exceptional actress and (otherwise)easy on the eye.Tim Burton's direction is so clumsily stylized that it becomes a parody of itself.  Ultimately, his helmsmanship gives us a film with all the dramatic tension of a Viagra commercial.  Speaking of which, there is no hint of chemistry between Depp and Bonham Carter, which ultimately renders their evil collaboration meaningless and as flat as the rest of the film.

It is a movie that is slow going but once it goes it is a pleasure to watch.For those who don't know, the story revolves around a guy named Benjamin Barber who has a beautiful wife and daughter only to have both snatched from him which ultimatly makes him a changed man by changing his look and appearance and renaming himself Sweeney Todd plotting revenge to all those that destroyed his life.

The mood of the movie is dark and it shows through the visual effects. In fact, the person I was with thought the movie was in black and white.A thriller like nothing before, it is essentially a musical which is weird for a movie like this for obvious reasons. It is also not like Depp and Burton to make a film like this however after seeing the movie, I couldn't see anyone else in the role. Depp is perfectly cast as is Helena Bonham Carter.Johnny Depp has never before sung on the big screen nor did anyone think he could sing but once again he has surprised his fans and surprisingly has done such a great job with it. He deserved the win at the Golden Globes but unfourtantly the Oscar he so richly deserved was robbed from him as this is one of Depp's finest performances to date.For some reason, Sweeney Todd didn't do as well in theaters as many thought it would.

It's a musical about a London barbour who is wronged and returns home looking for revenge.I'm usually skeptical of film remakes of musicals.  Being a fan of Tim Burton was enough to get me through the door.  I am really glad I saw it.  This is a very good movie that will satisfy a very wide audience, including those unfamiliar with the original musical as well as it's loyal fans.DISCLAIMER: Not for younger kids or squeemish adults.  This is one R rating that is well deserved.First and foremost, this movie is worth seeing in the theatres.  I expected this version to be even less ""musical"" than it was.  Surprisingly, it is VERY true to the original musical, with almost all the original Steven Sondheim score re-sung by the modern cast.  Musically, the songs and score are all well done and add to the theatre experience.Visually, Sweeney Todd is STUNNING.  This version is MUCH BETTER than any other previous version.  Tim Burton has created a dark and dingy London that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar for almost every technical category.  The black and white backdrop make the bright colors stand out when they are used.  Color is used artistically and powerfully, as you'll see.  :)The actors will also attract some die hard fan groups.  Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter have some very different fan bases, but I think both will be satisfied and surprised by the performances.  In fact the whole cast does wonderfully, and the director no doubt had something to do with that.This is also another movie where I will be looking forward to the HD DVD.

Well.  I thought Depp did a good effort.  However, Helena Bonhom Carter was weak at best.  To her credit, she does comment in the extras that if you are taking on a singing role for the first time, Mrs. Lovett is a bad choice.  This role would test a trained singer.I have to mention Sacha Baron Cohen as he did a great job in his role as Pirelli.One thing I found interesting was the talk(in the extras) this being almost operatic.  In opera they block the staging to suit the Music.  In this movie the effort seem to center on a fabulous scene and they tried to make the music fit it.As I mentioned.

People I worked with raved about it, but I never got a chance to go see it at the cinema.The DVD was a reasonable price - not THAT cheap, but not too expensive. But then what do I care, it wasn't actually me who bought it. A nice thought.Sweeney Todd was completely pointless. The music wasn't in the slightest bit memorable (yet everyone who raved about the movie, raved about the soundtrack). The only thing that was memorable were the various scenes of throat cutting and shaving. From a girl who has a severe phobia of watching guys shave their faces, and can't even watch the razor adverts, it probably wasn't a great idea to watch a movie that predominately features shaving.The only thing that impressed me about Sweeney Todd was Helena Bonham Carter. It's really the first movie I've seen her in, and she was actually really good - apart from the singing. But it wasn't just her. She wears a lot of black lacy dresses, with lots of cleavage on show to detract from the fact she was actually pregnant for most of filming. (Look out for them actually changing shape!) There's a lot of unrequited love on her part for Sweeney, and she mopes around like a lovesick teenager. Very unnerving from a grown woman.The plot's very boring, with OTT singing, and lots of scenes where not a lot happens. Sacha Baron Cohen appears, who manages to slip flawlessly from an Italian accent to a cockney accent, but he wasn't a particularly stand out character. The singing was unnecessary, and I simply cannot remember a single song from it.Don't get me wrong, I love musicals. Grease, Sound of Music, High School Musical, and there's probably a few more. But this just did not happen for me. I was continuously looking at the clock, but time seemed to move shockingly slowly.Briefly looking at the other reviews on the main page, everyone seems to be raving about this. Did we see a different movie? The dialogue was absolutely terrible, it seemed to be constantly whispered, and I was so close to switching on the subtitles. The musical numbers never seem to really get going or take off. They just plod along, and that's probably why they're so not memorable. Johnny Depp seems to be phoning in his dialogue at all times, and he's so bland in it. I thought he liked playing eccentric characters, not boring ones. And he's done the cockney accent in the Pirates of the Carribbean movies (please no more of those either!), I had to actually tell someone the other night not to speak in that particular accent.The grand finale fell flat on its gothic face. Not only was it predictable, but it just didn't match the rest of the movie. I can just imagine Burton struggling with the ending, and just deciding to do this to most of the main characters, and to hang with the subplots that are just left hanging.Sweeney Todd is on a whole, not great. And to top it off, I can only find a couple of reviews that I actually agree with. There's some seriously mad people out there who like this movie. Johnny Depp has gone down in my opinion.",1,"No, no, no, no, no and no",1224374400,"10 19, 2008",2008,3196,"['adore', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'watch', 'movies', 'apart', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hated', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'figured', ""'d"", 'like', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'People', 'worked', 'raved', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'go', 'see', 'cinema.The', 'DVD', 'was', 'reasonable', 'price', 'not', 'cheap', 'not', 'too', 'expensive', 'then', 'what', 'do', 'care', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'who', 'bought', 'nice', 'thought.Sweeney', 'Todd', 'was', 'completely', 'pointless', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'bit', 'memorable', 'yet', 'everyone', 'who', 'raved', 'movie', 'raved', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'memorable', 'were', 'various', 'scenes', 'throat', 'cutting', 'shaving', 'girl', 'who', 'severe', 'phobia', 'watching', 'guys', 'shave', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'razor', 'adverts', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'idea', 'watch', 'movie', 'predominately', 'only', 'thing', 'impressed', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'was', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'really', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'apart', 'singing', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'lot', 'black', 'lacy', 'dresses', 'lots', 'cleavage', 'show', 'detract', 'fact', 'was', 'actually', 'pregnant', 'most', 'filming', 'Look', 'out', 'actually', 'changing', 'shape', 'lot', 'unrequited', 'love', 'part', 'Sweeney', 'lovesick', 'teenager', 'Very', 'unnerving', 'grown', 'woman.The', 'plot', 'very', 'boring', 'OTT', 'singing', 'lots', 'scenes', 'where', 'not', 'lot', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'who', 'slip', 'flawlessly', 'Italian', 'accent', 'cockney', 'accent', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'stand', 'out', 'character', 'singing', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'single', 'song', 'it.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'musicals', 'Grease', 'Sound', 'Music', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'probably', 'few', 'more', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'was', 'continuously', 'looking', 'clock', 'time', 'seemed', 'move', 'shockingly', 'slowly.Briefly', 'looking', 'other', 'reviews', 'main', 'page', 'everyone', 'be', 'raving', 'Did', 'see', 'different', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'was', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'seemed', 'be', 'constantly', 'whispered', 'was', 'so', 'close', 'switching', 'subtitles', 'musical', 'numbers', 'never', 'seem', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'take', 'off', 'just', 'plod', 'along', 'probably', 'why', ""'re"", 'so', 'not', 'memorable', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'be', 'phoning', 'dialogue', 'times', 'so', 'bland', 'thought', 'liked', 'playing', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'not', 'boring', 'ones', 'done', 'cockney', 'accent', 'Pirates', 'Carribbean', 'movies', 'please', 'more', 'had', 'actually', 'tell', 'someone', 'other', 'night', 'not', 'speak', 'particular', 'accent.The', 'grand', 'finale', 'fell', 'flat', 'gothic', 'face', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'predictable', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'rest', 'movie', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'Burton', 'struggling', 'ending', 'just', 'deciding', 'do', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'hang', 'subplots', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'hanging.Sweeney', 'Todd', 'whole', 'not', 'great', 'top', 'off', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'couple', 'reviews', 'actually', 'agree', 'seriously', 'mad', 'people', 'who', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'gone', 'down', 'opinion']",N/A
1133683,A1AYN3IIUNQCIA,B001209SMS,"Melanie Edwards ""book worm""","[23, 26]","Ever since Moulin Rouge re-energized the then malignant musical genre, we have just been assaulted by a slew of hit Broadway Musicals turned big screen show stoppers, from the highs (Chicago) to the lows (The Producers). And while Dreamgirls was very well done, it really just buckled under its own pressure and did not live up to my expectations. But for 2007, musicals hit an all time high when not one, not two, but three well done films were released. In the Summer, we were treated to the feel good Hairspray. In the Fall, we then experienced the fantasy that was Across the Universe. And finally, they toped of the year with an all time high with Sweeney Todd- The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, one of the best musical adaptations in recent years.For those familiar with the Broadway play, we are shown the story of the vengeful Benjamin Parker, who for fifteen years has been paying for a crime he did not commit, wrongfully accused by the wicked Judge Tulpin. Now, he has returned to London, with a new name and a thirst for vengence. Aided by his former landlady Mrs. Lovett, he cuts a bloody path across 19th century London in his ulitmate quest for revenge against those who have wronged him.First off, Tim Burton could not have been a better choice to bring this tale to the big screen. Already one of the biggest directors out right now and a sheer genious of quirky, dark films, there really was no other contender that could have done the job he did. Here, he brings his best work since Ed Wood. The atmosphere, the costumes, the settings, everything just not only screams Burton but also keeps the vision of Stephen Sondheim alive and well. And usually i'm not a person who squirms easily but some of the throat slashings really did just make me shiver slightly in my seat, something I do not experience a lot even with some of the goriest or scariest horror films, so bravo to Burton for letting the blood fly (and believe me, there is a lot).Now, at first I was a bit apprehensive about Johnny Depp playing Sweeney Todd, cause until then I had no idea he could sing. But luckily, my fears were put to rest as soon as he stepped on screen. As Sweeney, he glowers, he sings, he kils, just once again submerging himself into yet another unique character. Helena Bonham Carter also proves her own as Todd's acomplice, delivering comic wit at just the right time and holding her own on the screen next to Depp and as for Alan Rickman, he just completly took me by surprise. To see the guy most people know as Professor Snape just being up there and singing is just a bit of a shock but he definently pulled it off. And for those who groan over the singing, I mean come on! These are not professional Broadway singers people! So its expected they wouldn't be on par with those who originally played the cast.I was very dissapointed that this film did not get the realy recognition by the Academy as it should have, especially for Best Picture and Director. But then again, this was a pretty tough year, full of a lot of great films, so the fact it sort of got lost in the shuffle to the likes of heavy hitters like No Country For Old Men or There Will Be Blood. But at least Depp got his just reward with a Best Actor nod.Definently one of the best films of 2007, Sweeney Todd is a must see for moviegoers but if you are not a fan for musicals, this will most likely not be your taste of film. However, if your a fan or loved the Broadway play, the film will surely not dissapoint.",5,"Throat Slashing, Singing, and Meat Pies, What more Could You Want?",1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,3493,"['Ever', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 're-energized', 'then', 'malignant', 'musical', 'genre', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'assaulted', 'slew', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'Musicals', 'turned', 'big', 'screen', 'show', 'stoppers', 'highs', 'Chicago', 'lows', 'Producers', 'Dreamgirls', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'just', 'buckled', 'own', 'pressure', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', '2007', 'musicals', 'hit', 'time', 'high', 'when', 'not', 'one', 'not', 'two', 'three', 'well', 'done', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'Summer', 'were', 'treated', 'feel', 'good', 'Hairspray', 'Fall', 'then', 'experienced', 'fantasy', 'was', 'Universe', 'finally', 'toped', 'year', 'time', 'high', 'Sweeney', 'Todd-', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'one', 'best', 'musical', 'adaptations', 'recent', 'years.For', 'familiar', 'Broadway', 'play', 'are', 'shown', 'story', 'vengeful', 'Benjamin', 'Parker', 'who', 'fifteen', 'years', 'been', 'paying', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'wicked', 'Judge', 'Tulpin', 'Now', 'returned', 'London', 'new', 'name', 'thirst', 'vengence', 'Aided', 'former', 'landlady', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'bloody', 'path', '19th', 'century', 'London', 'ulitmate', 'quest', 'revenge', 'who', 'have', 'wronged', 'him.First', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'bring', 'tale', 'big', 'screen', 'Already', 'one', 'biggest', 'directors', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'sheer', 'genious', 'quirky', 'dark', 'films', 'really', 'was', 'other', 'contender', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'job', 'did', 'Here', 'best', 'work', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'atmosphere', 'costumes', 'settings', 'everything', 'just', 'not', 'only', 'screams', 'Burton', 'also', 'vision', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'alive', 'well', 'usually', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'person', 'who', 'easily', 'throat', 'slashings', 'really', 'did', 'just', 'make', 'shiver', 'slightly', 'seat', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'experience', 'lot', 'even', 'goriest', 'scariest', 'horror', 'films', 'so', 'bravo', 'Burton', 'letting', 'blood', 'fly', 'believe', 'lot', '.Now', 'first', 'was', 'bit', 'apprehensive', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'playing', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'cause', 'then', 'had', 'idea', 'could', 'sing', 'luckily', 'fears', 'were', 'put', 'rest', 'as', 'soon', 'stepped', 'screen', 'Sweeney', 'just', 'once', 'again', 'submerging', 'yet', 'unique', 'character', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'also', 'own', 'Todd', 'acomplice', 'delivering', 'comic', 'wit', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'holding', 'own', 'screen', 'next', 'Depp', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'just', 'completly', 'took', 'surprise', 'see', 'guy', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'just', 'being', 'up', 'there', 'singing', 'just', 'bit', 'shock', 'definently', 'pulled', 'off', 'who', 'groan', 'singing', 'mean', 'come', 'are', 'not', 'professional', 'Broadway', 'singers', 'people', 'So', 'expected', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'par', 'who', 'originally', 'played', 'cast.I', 'was', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'realy', 'recognition', 'Academy', 'should', 'have', 'especially', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'pretty', 'tough', 'year', 'full', 'lot', 'great', 'films', 'fact', 'sort', 'got', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'likes', 'heavy', 'hitters', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'least', 'Depp', 'got', 'just', 'reward', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nod.Definently', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2007', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'must', 'see', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'musicals', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'taste', 'film', 'However', 'fan', 'loved', 'Broadway', 'play', 'film', 'will', 'surely', 'not', 'dissapoint']",N/A

I've seen a production at New York City Opera, plus filmed versions of the stage production with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn and the concert version with Hearn and Patti Lupone.  Unfortunately, I waited too long and missed the film version on the big screen, but now I've seen the Tim Burton movie on computer.The film creates a dark, brooding mood, without the boisterousness of the stage versions.  Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, as Sweeney Todd and Nellie Lovett, deliver subdued performances, looking like a pair of demonized grown-up orphans.  Their ""A Little Priest"" is hilarious.  They lack the rounded voices of their stage predecessors, but their more everyday vocals fit the mood of this version.Alan Rickman's Judge Turpin is more of a frustrated lover than the more obvious tyrant of the stage.  Timothy Spall's Beadle Bamford, Turpin's engratiating toady, is less the nobleman and more the ""rat""--appropriate for the guy who played Peter Pettigrew in the Harry Potter films.  Johanna is pretty but underused, and Anthony looks more like a 1970s rock star than an 1840's sailor.  The pivotal role of the Beggar Woman also appears not often enough.One surprise is the casting of a preteen male alto, Ed Sanders, as the orphan boy Toby.  Usually played on stage as an adolescent tenor with a somewhat addled brain, the film's Toby comes across as just a normal young boy caught up in some tenuous circumstances.  Considering the mother-son relationship that develops between Mrs. Lovett and Toby, perhaps in the more intimate film version, a younger boy is a better choice.Much of the music is gutted; we don't hear ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" (except as an instrumental), ""Kiss Me"", ""Parlor Songs"", and only half of ""God, That's Good"".  Quite a few remaining songs are pared down.  I don't think we get to hear the chorus sing once!  With such drastic cuts in music, the operatic quality is lost.Still, taken on its own merits, the film Sweeney Todd is still a gripping, engrossing story, enhanced by the music of Stephen Sondheim.

Todd is helped by Mrs. Lovett (Carter), who owns a bake shop and makes ""the worst pies in London"".While awaiting an opportunity give the judge a very  ""close shave,"" Todd and Mrs. Lovett devise a plan whereby he will slice the throats of his unsuspecting customers and she will turn their bodies into meat pies.Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen are fine in two of the movie's key villainous  roles, as is Ed Sanders, the boy who plays ""Toby"".

1133687,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B001209SMS,Michael Crane,"[4, 4]","If you were to tell me that ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" would end up being one of my top favorite movies of 2007, I would've told you that you were completely mad.  For one thing, I'm not a giant fan of musicals.  I can take them in small doses, but for the most part I stay away from them.  They always seemed fake and forced to me.  Still, I wanted to see the movie.  I like Tim Burton, and I like Johnny Depp.  The movie seemed twisted and dark enough, so why not?  I popped the DVD in and it didn't take long for me to completely buy into everything this bloody musical has to offer.  Indeed, it is one of the best movies to come out of 2007, or at least I think so.Benjamin Barker was a famous barber with a lovely wife and daughter, but a cruel and sadistic judge was also in love with his wife, so he had Benjamin sent away for life for a crime he did not commit.  Many years later, Benjamin returns to London completely dead inside.  The color from his skin is gone and everything that once was life inside of him has deteriorated.  When he learns that after the ordeal of his sudden ""deportation"" his wife had poisoned herself and his daughter was held captive by the judge, Benjamin... no...  Todd.  Sweeney Todd vows vengeance and payment in blood.  Not only that, but he sees all of humanity as being completely worthless in the end, and that everybody deserves to die.I'm trying to be as brief as possible when describing the story, as you'll learn secrets and twists along the way.  The film is done completely in song with very few moments of actual pure dialogue.  I will admit that it took me a little bit to get used to all of the singing, but it didn't take long.  The music isn't bad at all and the songs will get stuck in your head.  I'm impressed by how well this cast can sing.  Especially Depp, who proves to not only be terrifying in his presence, but also proves to have one helluva singing voice.  The music is what pushes the movie and tells the story, and I have to say that it works splendidly.Now, you must realize this when it comes to ""Sweeney Todd:""  It is an acquired taste.  You will either love it or hate it.  I don't see much of a middle ground with this one.  If demented and morbid subject matter such as throat-slashing and cannibalism puts you off, then you'll want to find another movie.  I would not, however, be put off with the idea of seeing the movie if you hate musicals, because like I said I'm not a big fan of them.  The movie is twisted and bizarre enough that it'll keep your attention throughout.  Tim Burton is once again successful at painting a bleak and gloomy environment filled with death and dread, and yet present it in such an ironically beautiful way.  The two-disc version includes some neat behind-the-scenes featurettes that are worth checking out.I have to say it, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a morbidly fantastic time that puts a whole new spin on musicals.  It has the ability to charm those who are not necessarily into musicals.  It is a dark and depressing story, but it is so well done that most of us can't help but stay along for the ride.  Not only is it one of my top favorite movies of 2007, but it is also a new favorite in general.  I will be a little hesitant when I go to my barber, however... or, at least I will be sure to skip the shave.  -Michael Crane",5,"""No, not Barker.  That man is dead.  It's Todd now...

Being a fan of the horror genre I found Sweeney Todd to be a slasher/fanasy/musical/drama film (notice the slashes) baked with dark humor and bright red blood Argento style that is fueled by longing and revenge.  That pretty much sums it up.  I'd go as far as to say this could be in with the top slasher films because Sweeney Todd starts with the purpose of revenge and then spirals out of control to the point where no one is safe from his blade.The story is about an honest barber, Benjamin Barker, who is wrongfully imprisoned by, Judge Turpin, because he wanted to take advantage of Barker's pretty wife.  With the help of a sailor, Barker returns to London years later eager to exact revenge on the judge who caused him the loss of his wife and daughter.When Todd returns to his old home he is informed by Mrs. Lovett (who owns a shop below Todd's old apartment and sells the worst meat pies in all of London) that his wife was defiled, humiliated, and as a result took poison.  She also informs him that Judge Turpin adopted Todd's daughter as his own. Soon after, Lovett shows him to his blades which she kept hidden all these years for his return.  He then rises inspired not as Benjamin Barker, honest barber, but Sweeney Todd the demon barber of fleet street.Lovett longs for Todd, Todd longs for his family, Turpin longed for Todd's wife and now daughter, Todd's daughter a captive in Turpin's house longs for freedom and ironically the sailor who helped Todd, and the sailor longs for her as well.  Oh, I almost forgot the little gin drinking boy who comes to be Lovett's helper now that her shop is thriving with a new meatier recipe; he longs for Lovett.  I think I might have carried on too long.CGI has it's critics and can look pretty fake. Initially I felt Sweeney Todd looked unreal however my mind soon changed.  The reason I forgot about it is because in Tim Burton's films he isn't trying to re create anything. Burton has his own visions, then invites the viewer in, where we soon get caught up in the world he's created.This was one of Burton's best and one of the best to come out of 2007.  Johnny Depp was great as was the supporting cast:  Alan Rickman (Judge Turpin), Timothy Spall (Beatle Bumford), Sacha Baron Cohen (Signor Adolfo Pirelli); however it is  Helen Bonham Carter who steals the show here with her portrayal of Mrs. Lovett.[4.5 Stars]SPECIAL FEATURES (from the back of the dvd)DISC IBurton + Depp + Carter = Todd:  A behind the scenes look at the collaboration of Tim Burton with Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter featuring exclusive footage from rehearsals, recording sessions and more!DISC 2Sweeney Todd is Alive:  The Real History of The Demon Barber - Musical Mayhem: Soundheim's Sweeney Todd -Sweeney's London - The Making of Sweeney Todd - Grand Guignol:  A Theatrical Tradition - Designs for a Demon Barber - A Bloody Business - Moviefone Unscripted with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp - And more",5,"Sweeney Todd a great slasher film, why cgi works in a Burton film, and dvd features for the 2 disc version.",1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,3062,"['Going', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'back', 'story', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'musical', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'specifics', 'Being', 'fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'found', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'be', 'slasher/fanasy/musical/drama', 'film', 'slashes', 'baked', 'dark', 'humor', 'bright', 'red', 'blood', 'Argento', 'style', 'fueled', 'longing', 'revenge', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', ""'d"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'could', 'be', 'top', 'slasher', 'films', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'purpose', 'revenge', 'then', 'spirals', 'control', 'point', 'where', 'one', 'safe', 'blade.The', 'story', 'honest', 'barber', 'Benjamin', 'Barker', 'who', 'wrongfully', 'imprisoned', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'wanted', 'take', 'advantage', 'Barker', 'pretty', 'wife', 'help', 'sailor', 'Barker', 'London', 'years', 'later', 'eager', 'exact', 'revenge', 'judge', 'who', 'caused', 'loss', 'wife', 'daughter.When', 'Todd', 'old', 'home', 'informed', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'who', 'shop', 'Todd', 'old', 'apartment', 'worst', 'meat', 'pies', 'London', 'wife', 'was', 'defiled', 'humiliated', 'result', 'took', 'poison', 'also', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'adopted', 'Todd', 'daughter', 'own', 'Soon', 'Lovett', 'blades', 'kept', 'hidden', 'years', 'return', 'then', 'inspired', 'not', 'Benjamin', 'Barker', 'honest', 'barber', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'demon', 'barber', 'fleet', 'street.Lovett', 'longs', 'Todd', 'Todd', 'family', 'Turpin', 'longed', 'Todd', 'wife', 'now', 'daughter', 'Todd', 'daughter', 'captive', 'Turpin', 'house', 'longs', 'freedom', 'ironically', 'sailor', 'who', 'helped', 'Todd', 'sailor', 'longs', 'as', 'well', 'Oh', 'almost', 'forgot', 'little', 'gin', 'drinking', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'Lovett', 'helper', 'now', 'shop', 'thriving', 'new', 'meatier', 'recipe', 'Lovett', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'carried', 'too', 'long.CGI', 'critics', 'can', 'look', 'pretty', 'fake', 'Initially', 'felt', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'looked', 'unreal', 'however', 'mind', 'soon', 'changed', 'reason', 'forgot', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', ""n't"", 'trying', 're', 'create', 'anything', 'Burton', 'own', 'visions', 'then', 'viewer', 'where', 'soon', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'world', 'created.This', 'was', 'one', 'Burton', 'best', 'one', 'best', 'come', '2007', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Beatle', 'Bumford', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Signor', 'Adolfo', 'Pirelli', 'however', 'Helen', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'show', 'here', 'portrayal', 'Mrs', 'Lovett', '4.5', 'Stars', ']', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'back', 'dvd', 'DISC', 'IBurton', '+', 'Depp', '+', 'Carter', '=', 'Todd', 'scenes', 'look', 'collaboration', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Helen', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'featuring', 'exclusive', 'footage', 'rehearsals', 'recording', 'sessions', 'more', 'DISC', '2Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Alive', 'Real', 'History', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Musical', 'Mayhem', 'Soundheim', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', '-Sweeney', 'London', 'Making', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'Theatrical', 'Tradition', 'Designs', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Bloody', 'Business', 'Moviefone', 'Unscripted', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'more']",N/A

Moore,"[2, 3]","Blood--gushing, pouring, spurting blood--could almost be considered a major character in Tim Burton's film version of Stephen Sondheim's ""Sweeney Todd."" It stampedes toward us as if it had a life of its own, outside the veins of the characters from whom it spurts. ""Sweeney Todd,"" with its obvious opportunities for Gothic horror and Grand Guignol, may well be the movie Tim Burton was born to make; it's a film that does total justice to its Broadway source while taking full advantage of the cinematic opportunities that source presents. Take the way Burton films ""By the Sea,"" Mr. Lovett's daydream song of domestic bliss with Sweeney; in candy colors that contrast wildly with the Stygian darkness of the rest of the film, Burton demonstrates--hilariously and tragically--the sheer impossibility of that daydream. I was a little concerned before the film's premiere that Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter would never be a vocal match for Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the original Broadway production. Of course, I was right, but fortunately that concern is irrelevant. Bonham Carter is an adequate singer, Depp a little better than adequate, but both are such brilliant actors that they put the songs across on that basis alone. (The best singers in the production are Jamie Campbell Bower, who looks and sounds like a Botticelli angel as lovelorn sailor Anthony Hope, and Ed Sanders, who as Toby Ragg is a smashing cross between Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger.) Burton puts his own unmistakable stamp on the production, underlining the heartlessness of Victorian society in a way Dickens would have applauded; even more, Burton understands that ""Sweeney Todd"" is a story that has to sweep up the audience in its bloody embrace, or else it is nothing. The original 1979 production with Cariou and Lansbury, directed by Harold Prince, did just that. Recently in Toronto I saw the road company of the musical's latest version, in which the actors roam around on stage playing instruments; I was impressed by the level of talent on stage, but the play itself left me cold. Bertolt Brecht would have loved the distancing effect; I did not. Burton's ""Sweeney"" grabs you by the throat and the heart, which is exactly what the story should do; Burton and Depp, especially in the film's final moments, bring home the story's inherent tragedy with breathtaking power. Praise is deserved all around, from Dariusz Wolski's moody photography, Dante Ferretti's malevolent production design and Colleen Atwood's expressive costume design to the excellent supporting performances of Alan Rickman as diabolical Judge Turpin, Timothy Spall as brutal Beadle Bamford and Sacha Baron Cohen as mountebank Pirelli.

Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) returns to 19th century London with a deep bitterness toward his forced exile. Fifteen years ago, Todd was prosperous barber and happy family man. Prominent Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) coveted his wife and so sent Todd to prison on false charges. Now a defeated man, Todd wanders into the pie shop beneath his old barber shop, where the proprietress Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter) recognizes him and offers her assistance in plotting revenge...and hiding the bodies.As if a musical about a serial killer weren't odd enough, Burton has cast it with actors who normally don't sing. Nevertheless, Johnny Depp's punkish baritone impressed me. Helena Bonham-Carter is adequate. Sacha Baron Cohen is fun as a flamboyant rival barber. Jayne Wisener is far to shrill as Todd's long lost daughter Johanna. The film's aesthetic is too gray for its own good at times, and Mrs. Lovett's ghoulishness is overdone. But this macabre spectacle manages to be both comic and ultimately tragic. Todd's deathtrap of a barber chair is suspenseful as well as gratuitously gory. And Johnny Depp's interpretation of the tormented, unhinged Sweeney Todd is something to see.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2008 single disc): The single disc edition has only one bonus feature, a making-of documentary called ""Burton + Depp + Carter = Todd"" (26 min).

The wife drank poison and the judge took the lovely daughter as his ward but as the movie opens and the barber returns to find his family, the judge decides to make moves on the daughter.Mrs Lovett (Burton's current domestic squeeze) rents a room to Sweeney over her meat pie shop.  They sing and dance and after Todd begins his new career as slasher, they grind up the cadavers to make meat pies that become the rage of London.Lovett falls in love with Todd but he is completely off his nut and continues his rampage of slashing and ultimately hacks the neck of his beloved (up till now presumed dead) wife who has become a dull witted street wench.  Now he goes completly berserk and tosses Lovett into the pie furnace where she hits the ultimate high note.This is actually quite an entertaining film and Depp handled the singing and dancing with aplomb.  Burton's makeup of Todd and Lovett reminded me of The Corpse Bride but on real folks - I guess this is sort of his trademark.  It's not for the squeemish or the kiddies though....bg",5,Blood 'n Guts 'Gore Then Blood  'n Guts 'n Gore S'more.....,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,1391,"['Father', 'Son', 'Holy', 'Spirit', '=', 'unholy', 'trinity', 'Sondheim', 'Depp', 'Burton', 'think', 'almost', 'have', 'be', 'three', 'have', 'movie', 'work', 'musical', 'less', 'wronged', 'barber', 'seek', 'revenge', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'Turpin', 'who', 'falsely', 'sentenced', 'fifteen', 'years', 'prison', 'order', 'make', 'moves', 'wife', 'wife', 'drank', 'poison', 'judge', 'took', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'ward', 'movie', 'barber', 'returns', 'find', 'family', 'judge', 'make', 'moves', 'daughter.Mrs', 'Lovett', 'Burton', 'current', 'domestic', 'squeeze', 'room', 'Sweeney', 'meat', 'pie', 'shop', 'sing', 'dance', 'Todd', 'new', 'career', 'slasher', 'grind', 'up', 'cadavers', 'make', 'meat', 'pies', 'become', 'rage', 'London.Lovett', 'love', 'Todd', 'completely', 'nut', 'rampage', 'slashing', 'ultimately', 'neck', 'beloved', 'up', 'till', 'now', 'presumed', 'dead', 'wife', 'who', 'become', 'dull', 'witted', 'street', 'wench', 'Now', 'completly', 'berserk', 'Lovett', 'pie', 'furnace', 'where', 'ultimate', 'high', 'note.This', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Depp', 'handled', 'singing', 'dancing', 'aplomb', 'Burton', 'makeup', 'Todd', 'Lovett', 'reminded', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'real', 'folks', 'guess', 'sort', 'trademark', 'not', 'squeemish', 'kiddies', '.bg']",N/A

1133700,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B001209SMS,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[1, 3]","I saw the original production of Sweeney Todd - well the first national company (the production that was filmed at the end the LA run at the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn) and fell in love with the grissly show.  It had style and flair and could not wait until the right director came along and filmed it.Ten years ago when I heard that Tim Burton was interested in doing a movie of it, I knew he was the only director that could pull it off.  When Johnny Depp was announced as the lead, I first thought he was too young but then realized he was probably the correct age for the role.  Then I heard about the trimming of the show.  But I decided to wait and see the results.The final verdict is this film was one of the best films of 2007.  Tim Burton did a masterful job of directing this difficult film.  While I did not agree with all the cuts, the only real complaint I had is the cut of the Prologue - The Ballad of Sweeney Todd.  This could have been put over the opening credits.  But this is a minor quibble. (By the way Burton should have won the Oscar for Direction)Johnny Depp proved that he was up to the role of the Demon Barber.  He took the role and ran with it.  He created a three dimensional character who you sympathize with even though he does terrible things.  (Depp also should have won the Oscar for this performance.)The only problem in casting was Helena Bonham Carter, she either hit musical sequences perfectly (A Little Priest) or totally missed it (The Worst Pies in London).  She is a great actress but just did not have the musical background for the role.  Mrs. Lovett is one of the most difficult roles in musical theatre.  She is a real monster.  She doesn't have the sympathetic backstory that Benjamin Barker has and it takes a very skilled actress (like Tony winner Angela Lansbury) to pull it off and Carter just came up short.In the supporting roles, Timothy Spall was perfectly sleazy as Beedle Bamford, Alan Rickman was incredibly slimey as Judge Turpin and newcomer Ed Sanders was beautifly naive as the innocent helper Toby.  Sasha Baron Cohen has a too brief but crucial appearance as Signor Perelli, a former protoge of Barker and Todd's first vicitim.  Laura Michelle Kelly portrays the Beggar woman - in a role drastically cut down from the stage version.  Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener portray the star crossed lovers Anthony and Joanna.And for those that want to better understand film making technique, this is a film that is technically flawless.  This is a film in which the most important element is the lack of color, from the production design and costumes to the cinematography.  The choice of the exclusion of color created the bleak period that it takes place.While I would have liked a more complete version, this is a great bare bones production.

Dressed up as it was in Brechtian stage business, adorned with two brilliant performances (Angela Lansbury and eventually George Hearn) and with the fine staging by Harold Prince, it at least seemed to be about something, even if later you realized it wasn't.  It's a penny dreadful with aspirations to high art, but it's still a penny dreadful.  Tragedy?  Sorry.  The central character doesn't have the stature for that: he's just a vengeful zero, and Mrs. Lovett a very bad cook.The film jettisons everything that made the stage version so entertaining, starting with the humor.  Please don't tell me it's dark and subtle -- it's gone.  And without the high-octane vocal performances of Lansbury and Hearn (or any of their stage successors) the songs don't land right -- they're enervated.  Only Ed Sanders as the boy Toby and to a lesser extent Jamie Campbell Bower seem capable to getting their numbers across, and in the case of Sanders doing so superbly.  The character of Mrs. Lovett in particular is all wrong: Carter plays her as too smart, and the manic music hall energy that Lansbury brought to the role, and that the film needs so desperately, is lost.  Irony?  Look elsewhere.  Tim Burton doesn't do irony.What did Burton want the audience to take away from this picture?

1133704,AMXRE0V10VO1J,B001209SMS,Music Man,"[2, 13]","Tim Burton's film version of the Sondheim classic ""Sweeney Todd"" was generally raved about upon its release, although it didn't quite catch the attention of most filmgoers and the result was a success d'estime.  The raves were undeserved and, while the film remains generally entertaining, the flaws progressively take centerstage with repeated viewings.  The most obvious weakness, discussed rampantly on the internet, is the singing.  There is just no way around it - Johnny Depp and (especially) Helena Bonham Carter are no singers.  While Depp gets by and only occassionally lapses into a crooning pop sound, Carter depletes her songs of all energy and depth with her wispy voice.  Her acting is first rate however.  Depp is okay, but has anyone else noticed the mincing, half-smile grimace that is creeping into almost every one of his performances?  It's an annoying mannerism that is all Depp and no Todd.  Both performances are defeated, unfortunately, by the sound mix and Burton's direction.  Apparently told to speak in whispers, their mush-mouthed delivery is buried under the soundtrack to make much of their dialogue indecipherable.  This also hampers every other performance, the best of which is Sasha Cohen as Pirelli (although he, too, swallows many of his lines) and Alan Rickman as the judge followed by Edward Sanders as Toby.  The rest barely register.Burton's direction is at times pedestrian, as in the ""A Little Priest"" section, and often uncertain.  He doesn't seem to understand how to make a musical move, so frequently everything just stands still except for those frenetic tracking shots.  But there's no style to the substance, and there are some shockingly lame computerized shots of London that look like they came from a comic book.  More destructively, the black humor is almost completely removed or sublimated, which has always been part of the fun of ""Sweeney Todd"".  It makes the film a very dark and dour experience.

1133705,A3A90CELVLOUP6,B001209SMS,"Nanciejeanne ""Enjay""","[9, 9]","I must begin by saying that I saw Sweeney with the original cast on Broadway in 1979. I was 14 years old...thanks Mom and Dad for being so progressive!! This musical (and Sondheim) has been my favorite ever since.  Anyway I did have certain preconceived notions about this when I heard it was being made into a movie by Tim Burton. I used to really love Burton, but lately well, not so much. I had visions of Goldberg-esge staging and typical Burton visuals. Burton can't seem to let go of pale-faced dark-eyed make-up, and bit of machinery-gear-type props, but otherwise, he did a great job getting away from this.I am not going to tell the entire plot because (to quote Sondeim): ""what happens then, well that's the play and he wouldn't want us to give it away...not Sweeney...""Anyway, I bought this and actually hesitated for a week before watching it. I was afraid my great experiences with the story would be forever tainted. But, nevertheless, I began. I heard the overture during the opening credits and was very excited that it was performed with an orchestra and lush arrangement (rather than electric guitars or something.) I saw the opening scene (missing the opening ensemble song) and braced myself for Depp's singing. However, when I heard Depp begin, I was pleasantly surprised. See, my first experience with Sweeney was Len Cariou. He played it similarly to Depp. He was not so much over the top, evil-incarnate; but more quiet, vengeful, sorrowful, and wronged. Cariou is also on the original cast-recording, which is available here on Amazon (Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1979 Original Broadway Cast)and very good!) The DVD I have of the stage-production (Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Snap Case)) stars George Hearn who plays the part a little harder, a little angrier. I prefer the softer, more pitiful Sweeney; the villian needs to show a real motivation, Depp makes him real. This works with the score as the music isn't violent-crazy. It has more of an undercurrent of ""something is going to happen""or ""someone peering around the corner."" A thriller--not a slasher.  Cariou's voice and body were more large and haunting than Depp's, but for the feeling itself, Depp seems to have captured it.Helena Bonham Carter has taken the Angela Lansbury role of Mrs. Lovett. Well, any theater fan knows these are huge shoes to fill. She tries, her voice isn't bad, it just is so diminutive. Mrs. Lovett is not a diminutive character! If you haven't heard it, you must listen to ""the Worst Pies in London"" by Lansbury. She is fantastic; she nearly steals the show with this song alone; no comparison to Carter. Carter does seem to come alive more as the film continues, plays her version of Lovett well, and does have a nice devious-ness to her! Her interpretation of the character, indeed makes you look at her a different, but effective way. Johanna's song (though shorter) is wonderfully performed  in this version. I actually loved the orginal singer, but it was quite operatic; this portrayal was much more accessible. Anthony is also very good in the movie version (played by Jamie Campbell Bower.) Compared to original cast, he seemed younger and very appropriate for the naive, young-lover character. Pirelli (Baron-Coen) is also surprizingly good in the film. Great casting jobs all around.I am not sure why they changed Lucy's role to not-quite-as-crazy. Toby was also less ""witted"" in the stage version, this one was just younger. Maybe not PC anymore to have a mentally-challenged stereotyped character (which isn't a bad thing.) Judge Turpin and the Beadle's roles were slightly different in the stage version (they had a wonderful duet!), but Rickman indeed plays a convincing antagonist (I will always associate him fondly with the movie ""Die Hard."")They did a great job with the ""A little Priest"" even though the switch to comic-relief is a little more effective in a live performance (you get to hear the audience laughing.) There is wonderful orchestration throughout the whole movie, I am so happy they didn't try to reduce it to a bunch of some pop songs and or add some new Top-40 ballad. I do miss the workers' whistle and I sorely miss my favorite ensemble...""Attend the tale of sweeney todd, his skin was pale and his eye was odd..."" but understand why it probably would not work in the movie. I would have liked to hear it over the end credits.I understand that this is not a movie-version of the stage play, it is a movie ~based~ on the the theater play. Still, it is quite similar and it is interesting to compare and appreciate the differences in the two versions. If you have never seen the stage-version or listened to the original cast recording; you owe it to yourself to buy or rent them. If you have never heard of Sweeney Todd before this film, I think you will enjoy this version of the dark tale.I like the 2-disk set as it contains (besides the feature film) interviews with Sondheim, ""making of"" feature, history of the story, special effects discussion, and info on the original stage productions.Burton has completely redeemed himself for me with this film. I hope that maybe some folks who think live-theater is not for them, will (after viewing this DVD) give it another chance and raise expectations of its future (I think we have had enough Disney-movie re-hashings, just my opinion.)Sorry this got long, but I really love the musical, and was a doubter about the film. I hoped I could convice others to give it a chance. I gave the film 5 stars out of 5 because they stayed true to the story and the music, for how they reimagined the play for film, but mostly for Depp's surprisingly fine performance. I am going to watch it again, right now! You will get your money's worth with this DVD.",5,"He shaved the faces of gentlemen, who never thereafter were heard from again...",1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,5796,"['must', 'begin', 'saying',

Doyle ""film buff""","[0, 0]","Tim Burton gives us the dark side of Old London with cinematography that might just as well have used glorious B&W; rather than drab color. Perhaps only the blood (of which there's plenty) could have been filmed in vivid tones of red and the rest in B&W;, since this basically falls into the horror film category--with music.Some of Stephen Sondheim's lyrics are enormously clever and at the same time simple, except for certain songs sung by HELENA BONHAM CARTER as Mrs. Lovett, the infamous woman with a bakery shop on Fleet Street. She has some of the most difficult material to handle and she does it extremely well. JOHNNY DEPP manages to sing the part of Sweeney Todd without actually being a professional singer--so he's effective enough but one can sense how much more powerful this would have been with a real singer. Performance wise, he's fine.SACHA BARON CONEN is a surprise as Pirelli, demonstrating a good voice and an Italian manner that makes him sound like Stromboli from Disney's ""Pinocchio"". ALAN RICKMAN is as slick as ever as a cruel villain who gets his comeuppance from the devilish pair of Mrs. Lovett and Mr. Todd, as do most of the other members of the large cast.ED SANDERS as Toby has a nice boy soprano voice and does an excellent job of emoting, and JAYNE WISENER has a lyrical voice that suits the song she sings while gazing out the window at the film's start. All of the orchestrations sound strong and full-bodied but I can't say that any of the songs are the kind that stayed with me on a first viewing. Perhaps after a few more looks at the film, some of them will begin to stick.It's definitely worth watching for any fan of musicals, although you have to be prepared to expect all the blood letting--even if the gushes look a bit fake. Burton loves to depict horror with a wicked gleam in his eyes, or so it seems, and he runs the full gamut of horror right up until the final scene that has a rather shocking conclusion.Haven't seen the play but have heard Angela Lansbury do some of the songs from the Broadway show. The film's biggest drawback is the fact that all of the photography is deliberately dark and moody, with rarely a glimpse of sunshine, and after awhile this becomes a strain on the eyes. We get the dark nature of the story from the beginning, no need to hammer the point home with an Old London atmosphere that is drearier than anything Dickens could have imagined.Summing up: Sondheim's score doesn't rank with his best, nor is this Tim Burton's best film--but it's well worth a watch thanks to the very energetic work of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in difficult, very demanding roles.",4,Burton's unusual mix of horror and music works...,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,2652,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'dark', 'side', 'Old', 'London', 'cinematography', 'might', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'used', 'glorious', 'B', 'W', 'rather', 'drab', 'color', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'blood', 'plenty', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'vivid', 'tones', 'red', 'rest', 'B', 'W', 'basically', 'horror', 'film', 'category', 'music.Some', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'lyrics', 'are', 'enormously', 'clever', 'same', 'time', 'simple', 'certain', 'songs', 'sung', 'HELENA', 'BONHAM', 'CARTER', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'infamous', 'woman', 'bakery', 'shop', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'most', 'difficult', 'material', 'handle', 'extremely', 'well', 'JOHNNY', 'DEPP', 'sing', 'part', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'actually', 'being', 'professional', 'singer', 'effective', 'enough', 'one', 'can', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'singer', 'Performance', 'wise', 'fine.SACHA', 'BARON', 'CONEN', 'surprise', 'Pirelli', 'demonstrating', 'good', 'voice', 'Italian', 'manner', 'sound', 'Stromboli', 'Disney', 'Pinocchio', 'ALAN', 'RICKMAN', 'as', 'slick', 'ever', 'cruel', 'villain', 'who', 'comeuppance', 'devilish', 'pair', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Mr.', 'Todd', 'do', 'most', 'other', 'members', 'large', 'cast.ED', 'SANDERS', 'Toby', 'nice', 'boy', 'soprano', 'voice', 'excellent', 'job', 'emoting', 'JAYNE', 'WISENER', 'lyrical', 'voice', 'suits', 'song', 'gazing', 'out', 'window', 'film', 'start', 'orchestrations', 'sound', 'strong', 'full-bodied', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'songs', 'are', 'kind', 'stayed', 'first', 'viewing', 'Perhaps', 'few', 'more', 'looks', 'film', 'will', 'begin', 'stick.It', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'fan', 'musicals', 'have', 'be', 'prepared', 'expect', 'blood', 'letting', 'even', 'gushes', 'look', 'bit', 'fake', 'Burton', 'depict', 'horror', 'wicked', 'gleam', 'eyes', 'so', 'full', 'gamut', 'horror', 'right', 'up', 'final', 'scene', 'rather', 'shocking', 'conclusion.Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'play', 'have', 'heard', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'do', 'songs', 'Broadway', 'show', 'film', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'fact', 'photography', 'deliberately', 'dark', 'moody', 'rarely', 'glimpse', 'sunshine', 'strain', 'eyes', 'get', 'dark', 'nature', 'story', 'beginning', 'need', 'hammer', 'point', 'home', 'Old', 'London', 'atmosphere', 'drearier', 'anything', 'Dickens', 'could', 'have', 'imagined.Summing', 'up', 'Sondheim', 'score', ""n't"", 'rank', 'best', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'best', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'thanks', 'very', 'energetic', 'work', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'difficult', 'very', 'demanding', 'roles']",N/A
1133708,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001209SMS,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 3]","Having known absolutely nothing about the long running broadway musical, I didn't know what to expect with Tim Burton's take on Sweeney Todd, but needless to say, not only was I pleasently surprised, I was thoroughly enthralled with what appeared on the screen.  Johnny Depp, in another well-deserved Oscar nominated performance, is the revenge driven title character who returns to London to avenge his family by dispatching the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) who had him falsely imprisoned.  Upon teaming with pie-baking Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), Todd returns to the barber business in gruesome style, waiting for the right moment to exact his vengeance.  Such a film adaptation would more than likely have fallen apart were it in another director's hands, but once again, Tim Burton proves that he is indeed a flawed yet somehow visionary director that has really come into his own more than ever with his last few films.

It looked like something that would be original, interesting and groundbreaking, and for the most part, it is.""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a story of Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), who is living a happy life with his beautiful wife and baby daughter until a corrupt London aristocrat Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) sets an eye on her. The outcome is tragic, resulting in Barker being in exile for many years, and fueled with angst once he is back in London. He there encounters Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who makes the worst pies in London, with whom he starts on a terrifying journey of revenge, under a new name - Sweeney Todd.The plot, atmosphere and the very dark humor of this musical is well-suited for a director like Tim Burton. Although I disagree about him being a great visionary, mostly because all his films are set in the same dark, gloomy environment, this is his best film, simply because of how well the material matches him. The photography, lighting and special effects are all outstanding and perfectly over-the-top. All Tim Burton's films have a sort of a parody feel to it, and ""Sweeney"" is no exception. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a good thing, because after rivers and rivers of blood you sit through, it requires a lot of comical relief to actually entertain you. The actors are top-notch, especially Helena Bonham Carter, who intentionally underplays her character and delivers a stunning performance. Depp is excellent as per usual, but it seems to me that he needs a nice, normal role for once, just so we can differentiate Sweeney Todd from Willy Wonka from Jack Sparrow.As for the music, it's very enjoyable and fun, but not catchy enough. The actors all have fun with the quick, witty, syncopated rhythm of the music. Stand-out tracks include ""The Worst Pies In London"", ""Poor Thing"" and ""Pretty Women"". Sadly, I don't remember any words to the songs, and I've seen the movie less than 5 hours ago. The problem is, the songs are all to similar, and it seems like Burton dismissed them as an element not too important for the movie, which is a shame. Another thing I found annoying was the ending, which I felt was too rushed and not cathartic enough, neither musically nor story-wise. Other than these two remarks, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is a fun, enjoyable movie that will leave Burton's fans amazed by the visuals, and us sheer mortals, by the pitch-perfect Helena Bonham Carter.",4,"An original, if flawed musical",1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,2603,"['Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'musical', 'theatre', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fan', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'looked', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'original', 'interesting', 'groundbreaking', 'most', 'part', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'story', 'Benjamin', 'Barker', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'living', 'happy', 'life', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'baby', 'daughter', 'corrupt', 'London', 'aristocrat', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'eye', 'outcome', 'tragic', 'resulting', 'Barker', 'being', 'exile', 'many', 'years', 'fueled', 'angst', 'once', 'back', 'London', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'worst', 'pies', 'London', 'whom', 'terrifying', 'journey', 'revenge', 'new', 'name', 'Sweeney', 'Todd.The', 'plot', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'dark', 'humor', 'musical', 'well-suited', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'disagree', 'being', 'great', 'visionary', 'mostly', 'films', 'are', 'set', 'same', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'environment', 'best', 'film', 'simply', 'how', 'well', 'material', 'photography', 'lighting', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'outstanding', 'perfectly', 'over-the-top', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'have', 'sort', 'parody', 'feel', 'Sweeney', 'exception', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'good', 'thing', 'rivers', 'rivers', 'blood', 'sit', 'lot', 'comical', 'relief', 'actually', 'entertain', 'actors', 'are', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'intentionally', 'character', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Depp', 'excellent', 'usual', 'nice', 'normal', 'role', 'once', 'just', 'can', 'differentiate', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Jack', 'Sparrow.As', 'music', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'not', 'catchy', 'enough', 'actors', 'have', 'fun', 'quick', 'witty', 'syncopated', 'rhythm', 'music', 'Stand-out', 'tracks', 'include', 'Worst', 'Pies', 'London', 'Poor', 'Thing', 'Pretty', 'Women', 'Sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'words', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'less', '5', 'hours', 'ago', 'problem', 'songs', 'are', 'similar', 'Burton', 'dismissed', 'element', 'not', 'too', 'important', 'movie', 'shame', 'thing', 'found', 'annoying', 'was', 'ending', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'rushed', 'not', 'cathartic', 'enough', 'musically', 'story-wise', 'Other', 'two', 'remarks', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'Burton', 'fans', 'amazed', 'visuals', 'sheer', 'mortals', 'pitch-perfect', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter']",N/A

He's a rare director that prefers powerful performances and atmosphere over style and with Sweeney Todd, this is his grandest gesture yet.Benjamin Barker is a barber who has a beautiful wife and daughter but is naive. The most powerful judge in all of London city is jealous of barker's life and decides to incriminate him on a false charge. Locked away for 15 years, Barker returns to London with a grim look on his face like that of a ghost and a white streak in his dark hair, here Tim Burton channels The Bride of Frankenstein.

He begins his bloody, murderous mission of developing a popularity, being an expert barber he is now the best barber on Fleet Street, and he slits many throats on the road to having the judge in his chair.Johnny Depp was rightfully nominated for an Oscar because his performance is frighteningly ferocious and he pulls off the Buster Keaton ""Great Stone Face"" effectively.

1133721,A2NT656K8QYTX3,B001209SMS,"PDC ""PoeBoy""","[1, 1]","Okay - let's not split hairs. Tim Burton's screen adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's stage-musical thriller `Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street' is a pitch-black, bloody masterpiece.With this film, both Burton and his longtime cinematic collaborator, Johnny Depp, have found a new voice. And, in Mr. Depp's case, quite literally. Safe to say that 'Sweeney' is like nothing either of them has ever done before. Not by a mile.And no one was more surprised than I.Though an admirer of much, if not all, of the work Burton and Depp have co-created, when it comes to this musical - one I've passionately appreciated ever since I saw the original Broadway cast - I must confess that I feared the worst. Namely, that both Burton and Depp would accentuate the whimsically macabre, campy aspects inherent in the story (admittedly, a melodrama, after all) to the detriment of the core essence of relentless, escalating, bone-chilling terror and pity -- the key ingredients of classic tragedy.But not so.  Thank God.In fact, this film is surprisingly faithful to the glowering, sinister, painful, and at times hilariously dark heart of Sondheim's classic masterwork of tonsorial terror. And while not lost in any way, the very dark (and very necessary) humor is deftly balanced here against the howling bleakness, raging injustice, and just-plain-evil which stalk the twisted alleyways of Sweeney's world and revenge-hungry mind.But, is it an utterly perfect movie? In a word: no. I can quibble with the elimination of the show's ""theme song"" -- the repeated, savagely witty chorus `The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd'. And the voices of the cast, technically speaking, are not always up to the rigorous, near operatic quality standards of many major productions of the live show.But in the blood-streaked face of what Burton has achieved in this intimate epic, with its spectacularly seedy, yet perversely beautiful evocation of a Dickensian/Jack-The-Ripper London -- its stylized, near-monochromatic squalor shot through with sudden and, at times, shocking assaults of color - any negatives seem mere niggling in retrospect.Without indulging in showiness for the sake of show, Burton has proven himself, more dazzlingly than ever, to be a technical conjuror, yet without losing sight of the quieter, subtler undercurrents throughout. He's as confident in his work with the actors and his marvelous staging of the many musical show-pieces, as he is with the compelling use of CG effects. (That opening-credits sequence alone is a stunner.)This is a new, more mature artist at work here, fully in control of his minor-keyed palette. Though Burton has unmistakably worked his distinctive wizardry yet again, this time he's created a truly unified, seductively sinister fairy-tale like no other, somehow pretty and poisonous simultaneously.Yet never was a fairy tale more truly Grimm!And that's no idle warning, believe me.No matter which way you slice it -- and Sweeney does it in all KINDS of ways -- this film was rated R for a VERY well deserved reason. Grand Guignol gore via throat-slashings galore are the order of the day in the morally askew funhouse world of  Mr. T and his partner/paramour in crime, Mrs. Lovett.Speaking of whom, the sweetly sordid pie-maker herself is played to perverse perfection with threadbare, hauntingly droll, pastry-faced allure by Helena Bonham Carter, who is funnier and sings much better than I had feared might be the case, memorably putting her own depraved stamp on the role. As does everyone in the supporting cast, especially the deliciously decadent Judge Turpin of Alan Rickman and the obsequiously vile, rodent-like, beady-eyed Beadle of Timothy Spall. Oh, MAN, do you ever itch to see Sweeney go to work on these two! And go to work he does! But I get ahead of myself...I would also be remiss in not making special mention of both Sascha Baron Cohen as the bogus barber Perelli in an enjoyable, broadly comic turn, and Ed Sanders as his hapless, much put-upon young assistant (i.e. slave) Tobias - both of them perfection in their very different ways. And even the ""straight"" romantic characters are played and sung equally well by Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener, and Laura Michelle Kelly who, collectively, manage to sidestep the potential curse of clich&eacute; and/or blandness inherent in these tricky roles.I was also impressed at the seamless streamlining of various story elements, in the process losing a few songs which, truly, never advanced the story in any crucial way onstage, but which would have proved a major impediment on the screen. And the restructuring of the scenes/songs which originally constituted the first half of Act Two, was pure inspiration, immeasurably increasing the film's storytelling effectiveness and propulsive energy.But, as in any production of Sondheim's musical thriller, the ultimate power and essential emotional force of this story stands or falls on the strength of the actor playing Todd. And Depp's Sweeney is truly a revelation.This is a Depp with newfound gravitas - his eyes and every gesture conveying a brooding, world-weary, soul-deep despair, and a potently unsettling undercurrent of simmering danger. All the layers and facets of this troubled and troubling character are laid bare in Depp's delicately gauged, fearless and fearful performance. And all the while maintaining a richly effective dialect which, along with the other details of his perfectly gauged portrayal, helps cement his Mr. T uniquely in one's memory long after the film has reached its tragically inevitable, pitifully chilling, blackly merciless conclusion.Yeah, yeah. But how's his SINGING?Well, very much to my surprise, unexpectedly effective. For, whatever Depp may lack in vocal virtuosity is made up for in spades by the power and range of his acting and the fact that he sings IN CHARACTER, utilizing his wonderfully growly, lower-class British dialect to marvelous effect - something no other stage Sweeney has done. And it works like mad. ""Barking mad"", to quote Mrs. Lovett. And though the role is usually sung by a baritone -- one further reason for my initial skepticism regarding Depp -- the switch to tenor was less jarring than I'd feared. And while the lighter vocal tone is admittedly less intimidating, the requisite demonic undercurrents are still very much in evidence, so all is far from lost.And, lest I forget, the lush orchestrations of the talented Johnathan Tunick have never sounded more awe inspiring.As a particularly delicious bonus, the 2-disc version of this DVD is packed as full as one of Mrs. Lovett's meat pies with wonderful special features on the background of the original show, the historical context of the original Sweeny Todd penny-dreadful & subsequent legend, and oodles of behind-the-scenes stuff on the making of the film.Not necessarily the most logical of films for a Christmas release (I'm sure more than one Mr. and Mrs. Middle-America ran screaming from the local cineplex long before the end credits rolled -- there was, nevertheless, a certain bitter irony at work in that unconventional studio decision which, if to no one else, would certainly have brought an amused chuckle to Mr. Todd himself as he stared at his pallid reflection in one of his beloved razors and smiled.

1133724,A1D3XQC2DIT,B001209SMS,Peter Shermeta,"[0, 0]","The dishonorable Judge Turpin lusts after another man's wife. To gain her undivided attention, the judge sends her husband, Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), away; a life sentence for a bogus charge. Fifteen years later a ship docks in London carrying a man once-named Barker. He now goes by Sweeney Todd and he has come back to exact his revenge and find his wife and daughter. He returns to the space he once occupied to resume his work as a barber and forms a most peculiar relationship with Mrs. Lovett, whose meat pie shop sits beneath Todd's barber chair.The movie Sweeney Todd is based on Stephen Sondheim's musical which goes by the same name (and is in turn based on a 19th century legend of Sweeney Todd). Being that it is based on a musical, there is some conversation, but most intercourse is in song. For some, this will be the first hurdle to clear. But if you like musicals, the songs are fantastic and the signing was great. Johnny Depp really impressed me with his voice. And Ed Sanders, who plays Toby, was very very good.Sweeney Todd would be hard pressed to earn a nickname such as the ""Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" without a little effort. His weapon of choice is the straight razor he uses in his barber practice. Get the men into his chair and slit their throats. This happens many times, and Director Tim Burton rivals most ""B"" horror flicks with the amount of blood in Sweeney Todd. This is the second, and final hurdle. If you can clear those two things, I hope you enjoy Sweeney Todd as much as I did.As mentioned already, I thought Johnny Depp's singing was really worth seeing. I think I will be so bold as to call this his best performance to date. And consider that I am as much of a Depp fan as most.I am not normally a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, but I will admit that I loved his cameo in Sweeney Todd; it was very funny.I was afraid that Tim Burton would take too much creative license and make it more like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but he did not. I loved the almost grainy feel to the film and the washed-out color, I thought it was perfect to capture the feeling of the movie.Despite the heavy blood flow, I really enjoyed Sweeney Todd. I thought Johnny Depp was great in the lead and he had very good support from Helena Bonham Carter and Ed Sanders.

1133727,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B001209SMS,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 0]","Sweeney Todd is one of those musicals that has to change when it makes the transition from stage to screen.  Most notable is that the violence which is mere squirt of blood on stage is going to gush by the gallons on screen.  So in case you're wondering, that's where the R-rating comes in.But let's not consider the stage version and consider Burton's film version on its own.  It's definitely one of Burton's more ambitious works, being that it is a musical and all.  But he rides with it and the thing is shot beautifully. There are a lot of neat shots, including one early on that zooms through the dark streets of London.  It sets up the ambience beautifully.Burton's at home with the subject matter as a vengeful barber gives a very fine shave to his customers before they become one of Mrs. Lovett's meat pies.  Depp surprised me as he really captured the menace of Todd and carries much of the feature.  His voice, though not classically trained, is fit for Todd, which ranges from a good singing voice to an angry growl at times.  The expression exalted by Depp, believe it or not, is absent from some professional productions I've seen of the play.But where Depp succeeds, Helena Bonham Carter fails.  It's not that she doesn't have a great singing voice (though she really doesn't), rather, it's that it's such a flat performance.  Mrs. Lovett is the second lead, and most of the time she's performing, I'd rather not listen.  Her singing voice is very blah.  It's bearable, but in pieces like ""A Little Priest,"" the expression is lost - and it's very key to the success of the piece.Two supporting players that do a tremendous job are Alan Rickman as the judge (can he do any wrong) and the young Ed Sanders as Toby.  The play usually has an older actor play this role.  I never imagined someone the actual age playing the part, but he pulls it off quite well.  There's a scene in the movie where he doesn't even say anything, yet has an expression on his face that would make Damien cringe.Yet with all the great performances and great look of the production, I couldn't help but feel that something was missing.  And sorry, this is where I have to compare the film to the play.  Sondheim wrote some sneaky little lines into the original that either aren't expressed well in the film or are completely excised from the film.  Their importance was that they added to the dark humor of the piece.  And as gruesome a tale as it is, dark humor was always intended.  It boggles my mind a bit, as it's something Burton's good at, yet some of the humor that immediately follows Todd's ""Epiphany"" seems rather lost, making this a rather gruesome musical throughout, which though good, may come off as just a tad too dark.",4,"A bloody good time, though try to separate it from the stage version",1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,2726,"['Sweeney', 'Todd', 'one', 'musicals', 'change', 'when', 'transition', 'stage', 'screen', 'Most', 'notable', 'violence', 'mere', 'squirt', 'blood', 'stage', 'going', 'gush', 'gallons', 'screen', 'So', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'where', 'R-rating', 'in.But', 'let', 'not', 'consider', 'stage', 'version', 'consider', 'Burton', 'film', 'version', 'own', 'definitely', 'one', 'Burton', 'more', 'ambitious', 'works', 'being', 'musical', 'thing', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'are', 'lot', 'neat', 'shots', 'including', 'one', 'early', 'zooms', 'dark', 'streets', 'London', 'up', 'ambience', 'beautifully.Burton', 'home', 'subject', 'matter', 'vengeful', 'barber', 'very', 'fine', 'shave', 'customers', 'become', 'one', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'meat', 'pies', 'Depp', 'surprised', 'really', 'captured', 'menace', 'Todd', 'much', 'feature', 'voice', 'not', 'classically', 'trained', 'fit', 'Todd', 'good', 'singing', 'voice', 'angry', 'growl', 'times', 'expression', 'exalted', 'Depp', 'believe', 'not', 'absent', 'professional', 'productions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play.But', 'where', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'not', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'singing', 'voice', 'really', ""n't"", 'rather', 'such', 'flat', 'performance', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'second', 'lead', 'most', 'time', 'performing', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'listen', 'singing', 'voice', 'very', 'blah', 'bearable', 'pieces', 'A', 'Little', 'Priest', 'expression', 'lost', 'very', 'key', 'success', 'piece.Two', 'supporting', 'players', 'do', 'tremendous', 'job', 'are', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'judge', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'young', 'Ed', 'Sanders', 'Toby', 'play', 'usually', 'older', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'never', 'imagined', 'someone', 'actual', 'age', 'playing', 'part', 'off', 'quite', 'well', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'anything', 'yet', 'expression', 'face', 'would', 'make', 'Damien', 'cringe.Yet', 'great', 'performances', 'great', 'look', 'production', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'sorry', 'where', 'have', 'compare', 'film', 'play', 'Sondheim', 'wrote', 'sneaky', 'little', 'lines', 'original', 'are', ""n't"", 'expressed', 'well', 'film', 'are', 'completely', 'excised', 'film', 'importance', 'was', 'added', 'dark', 'humor', 'piece', 'gruesome', 'tale', 'dark', 'humor', 'was', 'always', 'intended', 'mind', 'bit', 'something', 'Burton', 'good', 'humor', 'immediately', 'Todd', 'Epiphany', 'rather', 'lost', 'making', 'rather', 'gruesome', 'musical', 'though', 'good', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'dark']",N/A

1133734,A2JHYW5V7UFIQ2,B001209SMS,"R. C. Walker ""catu11us""","[21, 40]","It would have been nice had Tim Burton produced a ""Sweeney Todd"" that did a certain amount of justice to Steven Sondheim's masterwork. Unfortunately, what Sondheim wrote and Burton put out bear only the most casual resemblance to each other ... namely, they have a lot of the same words and much of the same music - assuming that you prefer Shakespeare's witches acting like Wagner's norns (Anna Russell: ""this dreary set of women""), or prefer Beethoven's 5th taken at the tempo of Chopin's funeral march. Blech!It should be noted that there are already available 2 other versions of this opera (yes, I know it has spoken dialogue, but so does Carmen when it's done properly). Both star the talented George Hearn as Sweeney. One is the 1982 fully staged version with Angela Lansbury grasping immortality as Mrs. Lovett. The other is the 2001 concert version with the great Patti LuPone. Ms LuPone does an undeniable star turn in this role, but fails to achieve Lansbury's high orbit. Hearn is a tremendous Sweeney, although in 2001 he's showing the 19 elapsed years since the last recording. I would recommend either of these entries, although my recommendation of the 1982 version is unqualified, enthusiastic, and excited.And now Tim Burton tackles the Demon Barber. Burton is an erratic director who often hits the heights but here sinks to a new low in this thing that is less a performance than a travesty.The reader may notice I mention none of the other performers. This is done mostly to protect the innocent. They do well enough, but their quality is still leagues from the 1982 version. As in nearly everything that went wrong with this Sweeney, I blame the director.Somebody must have told Burton that Sweeney Todd is a dark comedy. He seems to have forgotten about the ""comedy"" and concentrated on the ""dark"" - to great excess, alas. Practically everything is filmed through blue filters - which may have been considered clever technique 50 years ago but is now just a strain on the eyes.On first viewing the film, and assuming you know the score, the first thing you will notice is the complete absence of the chorus. Considering the deep relationship between Sweeney and Greek theater, this omission is akin to dropping the witches from Macbeth. It is this omission that robs the work of its dimensionality and causes the ending to fall flatter than last week's souffl&eacute;.Aside from the directorial murder of the chorus and its music, this performance contains a number of omissions, truncations, and abbreviations. The flagellation scene, as I recall, is gone. The Todd-Pirelli contest contains only the shaving part, not the tooth-pulling half. (This omission is fairly common in performance, alas). The Beggar Woman's part is excised by about 50%, including most of the best bits. The ""God, That's Good"" number is foreshortened to the point of being seen on edge. The wildly funny lead up to Beadle Bamford's murder is gone. And so on and on. Somebody should remind Burton that this is a recipe for hash, not honest roast beef.Burton's directorial aim seems clearly to rob Sweeney of almost every ounce of its considerable humor. He fails, and there's enough left to cause us to go into deep mourning for the rest. ""Hello, my name is Tim. I'm here to make sure you don't have any fun."" He seems to desire the players to be a funereal in their acting as possible.As a result, a great actor like Johnny Depp is converted into somebody you'd never want to see or hear again. Depp, clearly too young for the role, is made up to look like somebody in a 1930s horror flick instead of someone who's spent nearly 2 decades in the penal sloughs of Old Australia. He plays Sweeney as if the man were loopy, which he isn't. He has a detached, dreamy delivery and never, NEVER catches fire. I suppose this approach may be considered interesting in a sort of abstract way, but mainly it's boring and tedious. Despite all the cuts, the film is only about a quarter-hour shorter than the 1982 and 2001 versions ... yet it seems to drag out a lot longer. You do the math.Perhaps the weakest link in the whole cast is Helena Bonham Carter, who is manifestly too young to play Mrs. Lovett. Her makeup may be intended to age her, but merely gives her a tired and haggard appearance. Lovett's first appearance should wrench the viewer's attention onto her relentlessly. Bonham Carter's first appearance gives us time to see if there are any pictures on the ceiling. The less said about ""Have a Little Priest"", probably the better. There are a few clever moments, but only in the sense of a convergence of a visual clue to the lyrics ... a technique that doesn't hold up well with repetition. Bonham Carter's motherly effusions over Toby wouldn't convince a 3-month-old puppy.Speaking of puppies, the staging of this dog omits the original wonderful mechanistic set in favor of a more realistic presentation of London. This can be understood, since films generally try to transcend the limitations of the stage. In this case, however, the relationship of staging with plot is too organic to be so lightly dismissed.Look, guys ... if you buy this you'll regret it ... maybe not now, but later and for the rest of your life.

1133737,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B001209SMS,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[2, 3]","Being a total stranger to the stage version of this Sondheim musical, I have nothing to compare the movie version to - but, that being said, this version is more than strong enough to stand by itself as an excellent entry into the movie musical canon.Benjamin Bratt (Depp) and his wife fall prey to the lustful advances of crooked Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman)  -she becomes his unwilling lover and eventually poisons herself, he is sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. Their daughter Joanna, in the years Bratt is exiled, has matured into a lovely young thing and is now the ward of Turpin, who, assisted by his revolting manservant Beadle Bamford (Spall), decides he's going to make Joanna his bride. Bratt returns, assumes the name of Sweeney Todd, and with the help of ex-sailor Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) and crazed baker Mrs. Lovett (Bonham-Carter), seeks revenge against the Judge and the awful city where his former happy life was destroyed.Almost every single aspect of ""Sweeney Todd"" is handled with a graceful and satisfying polish: from the acting to the musical numbers, the cinematography to the pacing, there's a kind of staccato rhythm to the entire film that complements the plentiful songs beautifully. Depp is excellent as Todd, he'd acquired a new depth of maturity of late, and portrays this older psychotic gentleman with as much effective pathos and charisma as he did almost twenty years ago with Edward Scissorhands. Bonham-Carter, for her part, makes an excellent foil to Depp's maniacal, malevolent barber: her careless, unsophisticated attitude towards Todd's misdeeds and her lazy, detached reading of the part make for a very watchable and oddly sympathetic character.Other cast nods must go to Ed Sanders as Toby, an amazing child actor with an excellent voice, and more than capable of keeping pace with his adult colleagues, Timothy Spall camps it up beautifully as the truly revolting Beadle Bamford, and Alan Rickman's Judge Turpin is believable and malevolent and very satisfying to watch.Tim Burton's outdone himself again with ""Sweeney Todd"" - the direction is beautiful: monochromatic and stark gothic cityscapes contrast with the lush scarlet of spraying blood to suggest an atmosphere of fear and tension that the vast majority of contemporary horror movies lack in spades. The appearance of Joanna and Mrs. Lovett's By The Sea fantasy sequence provide some much-needed visual relief from the grimness, and make the film's end and characters all the more poignant and compelling.The downsides of ""Sweeney Todd"" for me come in the shape of Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony (I didn't buy his Lovelorn Hero for a second, he comes across as weak and tiresome), and from the fact that the whole movie does suffer from a lag towards the end: the pace if ""Sweeney Todd"" is slow, which is fine, but I can't help thinking that if some of the latter musical numbers, and thereby the entire film, would have been better at a faster pitch. ""Sweeney Todd"" makes some big promises in the first half, but reneges on a few in the second - still, the ending is satisfying enough, and overall, this doesn't make a huge change to the viewer's enjoyment levels.For the most part I thoroughly enjoyed ""Sweeney Todd"" - it's not for everyone, particularly not for people who like their musicals fast and flashy, like Chicago or Hairspray. This is a slower, more sombre, and far more visceral experience - but if you're a Burton fan, or a lover of gothic drama, then give this a go. It's very, very rewarding for those viewers that can appreciate it for what it is.Recommended.",4,"""Harry Potter's Supporting Cast And The Silver Shaver Murders""",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,3609,"['Being', 'total', 'stranger', 'stage', 'version', 'Sondheim', 'musical', 'have', 'nothing', 'compare', 'movie', 'version', 'being', 'said', 'version', 'more', 'strong', 'enough', 'stand', 'excellent', 'entry', 'movie', 'musical', 'canon.Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Depp', 'wife', 'fall', 'prey', 'lustful', 'advances', 'crooked', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Alan', 'Rickman', '-she', 'unwilling', 'lover', 'eventually', 'poisons', 'sent', 'prison', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'daughter', 'Joanna', 'years', 'Bratt', 'exiled', 'matured', 'lovely', 'young', 'thing', 'now', 'ward', 'Turpin', 'who', 'assisted', 'revolting', 'manservant', 'Beadle', 'Bamford', 'Spall', 'going', 'make', 'Joanna', 'bride', 'Bratt', 'returns', 'name', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'help', 'ex-sailor', 'Anthony', 'Hope', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'crazed', 'baker', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Bonham-Carter', 'revenge', 'Judge', 'awful', 'city', 'where', 'former', 'happy', 'life', 'was', 'destroyed.Almost', 'single', 'aspect', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'handled', 'graceful', 'satisfying', 'polish', 'acting', 'musical', 'numbers', 'cinematography', 'pacing', 'kind', 'staccato', 'rhythm', 'entire', 'film', 'plentiful', 'songs', 'beautifully', 'Depp', 'excellent', 'Todd', ""'d"", 'acquired', 'new', 'depth', 'maturity', 'late', 'older', 'psychotic', 'gentleman', 'as', 'much', 'effective', 'pathos', 'charisma', 'did', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Bonham-Carter', 'part', 'excellent', 'foil', 'Depp', 'maniacal', 'malevolent', 'barber', 'careless', 'unsophisticated', 'attitude', 'towards', 'Todd', 'misdeeds', 'lazy', 'detached', 'reading', 'part', 'make', 'very', 'watchable', 'oddly', 'sympathetic', 'character.Other', 'cast', 'nods', 'must', 'go', 'Ed', 'Sanders', 'Toby', 'amazing', 'child', 'actor', 'excellent', 'voice', 'more', 'capable', 'keeping', 'pace', 'adult', 'colleagues', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'camps', 'up', 'beautifully', 'truly', 'revolting', 'Beadle', 'Bamford', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'believable', 'malevolent', 'very', 'satisfying', 'watch.Tim', 'Burton', 'outdone', 'again', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'direction', 'beautiful', 'monochromatic', 'stark', 'gothic', 'cityscapes', 'contrast', 'lush', 'scarlet', 'spraying', 'blood', 'suggest', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'tension', 'vast', 'majority', 'contemporary', 'horror', 'movies', 'lack', 'spades', 'appearance', 'Joanna', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Sea', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'provide', 'much-needed', 'visual', 'relief', 'grimness', 'make', 'film', 'end', 'characters', 'more', 'poignant', 'compelling.The', 'downsides', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'come', 'shape', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'Anthony', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Lovelorn', 'Hero', 'second', 'weak', 'tiresome', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'suffer', 'lag', 'end', 'pace', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'slow', 'fine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'latter', 'musical', 'numbers', 'thereby', 'entire', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'faster', 'pitch', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'big', 'promises', 'first', 'half', 'few', 'second', 'still', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'enough', 'overall', ""n't"", 'make', 'huge', 'change', 'viewer', 'enjoyment', 'most', 'part', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'not', 'everyone', 'particularly', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'musicals', 'fast', 'flashy', 'Chicago', 'Hairspray', 'slower', 'more', 'sombre', 'far', 'more', 'visceral', 'experience', ""'re"", 'Burton', 'fan', 'lover', 'gothic', 'drama', 'then', 'give', 'go', 'very', 'very', 'rewarding', 'viewers', 'can', 'appreciate', 'what', 'is.Recommended']",N/A

When Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) advises him that Turpin raped his wife, Lucy, causing her to take poison, then took his daughter Johanna as his ward, Todd swears vengeance.And a bloody vengeance it is.

1133742,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001209SMS,RMurray847,"[3, 5]","Because of the previews that we've all been seeing for the last month or so, I'm pretty sure there will be people who come into SWEENEY TODD not realizing it's a musical.  They will be in for a pretty big surprise.  TODD is a very different musical from the recent flurry we've had (DREAMGIRLS and HAIRSPRAY most recently).  Those films tell stories that lend themselves to songs.  After all, DREAMGIRLS is about singers, and HAIRSPRAY has talent show elements.  SWEENEY TODD, on the other hand is a pitch-black comedy/tragedy set in Victorian London about a man crazed by loss and a desire for vengeance who uses his skills as a barber to slit the throats of a great many of  his fellow citizens. And the helpful Mrs. Lovett, who owns the meat pie shop just below him, takes these victims and uses them to create the most tasty and meat-filled pies in the city.Not exactly the stuff of most musicals, is it?  And the music and lyrics are from Stephen Sondheim, that most complex and witty of American musical theatre geniuses.  So the lyrics are filled with puns, tricky rhymes, and they wrap around complex musical arrangements.So I know a lot of people will be put off by this film.  And that's too bad, because it is one of Tim Burton's best films ever.  (I admit, I'm not his biggest fan...to me his movies, while beautiful to look at, often lack a clear heart.  They often fail to capture me on a purely emotional level.  ED WOOD was a great film, and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is delight...but so many just left me scratching my head [especially BIG FISH]).  In TODD, Burton has found a piece of art in the original musical that he can adapt beautifully for his visual style without risking the dangerous heart at the center of it.And of course, he had the great luck of casting Johnny Depp in the title role, and the even greater luck of finding out that Depp actually sings fairly well.  His voice is not drop-dead stunning, and  I doubt he could stand on a Broadway stage and fill the space to the back rows...but he stays in tune, has a pleasant sound and best of all, he acts the absolute hell out of the part.  He never stops playing SWEENEY just so he can sing.  The songs grow organically from him, in the same way he imagines his razors grow from his arm.  It's a showy performance, and Depp also clearly doesn't care if he has the sympathy of the audience.  This is a good thing, because TODD commits some horribly unspeakable acts.  We shouldn't be snickering alongside him as though he were some sort of Victorian Freddy Krueger.  He's a man deranged by sadness and vengeance.  We understand how he has been misshapened...but we don't exactly love for it either.Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett struggles more with her singing.  Her diction is not that great, so we actually miss a lot of her lyrics.  But she's a dynamic presence, so while less successful, I still have a hard time picturing any other recognizable actress handling the role better.  Alan Rickman is the reprehensible Judge Turpin who years before sent the young, nave barber Benjamin Barker off to prison on a trumped up charge, just so he could have his way with Barker's wife and steal Barker's infant daughter.  Barker returns as Todd, eager for revenge, only to find that a horrible situation with the Judge is even worse.  Rickman has a nice singing voice (no surprise) and makes his judge a complex character.  Timothy Spall, as the beadle who also is Turpin's assistant, is the true slimy villain of the piece.  He has no complexities...he's just a horrible toad of a man.  And Sacha Baron Cohen has a comic turn as the barber Pirelli, who unwittingly helps kick start both Todd's legitimate and non-legitimate business concerns.Visually, the movie is a treat.  Burton has managed to make his sets look like theatrical sets, yet his camera work leaves no doubt you are watching a film of dizzying technical skill.  It's a nice way to salute the theatrical roots of the piece, while making sure it doesn't seem stagy.My only other gripe is the pace.  The movie is only 2 hours long...certainly shorter than the full theatrical production, which clocks in at nearly 3 hours.  But there were stretches where it still felt a little slack and I found myself wondering how much longer it was.  I don't want to give away too much plot, in case you aren't very familiar with the details of the story, but let's just say that anytime the ""young lovers"" appeared, I had to roll my eyes.  After the charisma and energy of Depp and Carter...they were just...well...annoying.The film is ""R"" rated, and deserves to be.  I know a lot of teenage girls will want to see Depp (our 15  year old went with us) and I think that if they have some idea that this is a bloody, nasty Depp they are going to see, they can still enjoy it.  I wouldn't recommend the film for anyone younger than 14 or so, at best.  The killings are truly over the top, but that doesn't mean that folks might not find the spraying arterial blood a bit upsetting.  This is not a ""feel good"" movie...just because it's a musical.  Sondheim always was a master of the dark musical...and TODD is one of his darkest.  But it has so many pleasures both for the ear and eye that I highly recommend it.  Just don't be surprised to find 50% of it is sung, and you'll be okay.",5,"Saw a sneak preview!

1133744,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001209SMS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Tim Burton, 2007)Perhaps my problem with Tim Burton's much-praised adaptation of Sweeney Todd is that I'm seeing it too soon after Dave Moore's version, which was the sublime side of the sublime/ridiculous coin. It's not that this version is bad, in any way, it's just not all that good compared to a number of Burton's other masterworks.Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter take on the roles of Sweeney Todd and his neighbor Mrs. Lovett, a destitute pie-seller. Todd, a barber by trade, is bent on getting revenge against Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who sent him to prison in order to steal his lovely young wife. Todd starts taking out those standing in his way, and needs something to do with the bodies. Lovett hatches a plan--grind 'em up and sell 'em as Mrs. Lovett's meat pies. They, of course, sell like the proverbial hotcakes. Tension arises when Lovett starts having feelings for Todd, who is so obsessed with his revenge and his lost love that he has eyes for nothing else...Burton brings the same phantasmagoric, hallucinatory visuals to Sweeney Todd that he did to his previous remake, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and when it comes right down to it, I wasn't all that fond of them in that movie, either (which I just looked up; I gave it two and a half stars back in 2006). The over-the-top Burton vision works just fine for me when he's doing original material (viz. Edward Scissorhands or Beetlejuice), but when it comes to Burton adaptations, I always preferred the much lower-key look of Sleepy Hollow (or, while it's not a remake, the similar feel of his best film, Ed Wood). I'm also not as fond of the Sondheim adaptation, which Burton follows rather faithfully here, as of some other incarnations of Sweeney Todd. It really comes down to whether you want your murder and cannibalism with lighthearted whimsy, as presented here, or whether you want it in a dark, claustrophobic presentation without musical numbers, which you get from Moore's 2006 adaptation. ** ",3,Not as good as I was expecting.,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,2056,"['Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'Tim', 'Burton', '2007', 'Perhaps', 'problem', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'much-praised', 'adaptation', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'too', 'soon', 'Dave', 'Moore', 'version', 'was', 'sublime', 'side', 'sublime/ridiculous', 'coin', 'not', 'version', 'bad', 'way', 'just', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'compared', 'number', 'Burton', 'other', 'masterworks.Burton', 'regulars', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'take', 'roles', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'neighbor', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'destitute', 'pie-seller', 'Todd', 'barber', 'trade', 'bent', 'getting', 'revenge', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'who', 'sent', 'prison', 'order', 'steal', 'lovely', 'young', 'wife', 'Todd', 'taking', 'out', 'standing', 'way', 'something', 'do', 'bodies', 'Lovett', 'plan', 'grind', 'sell', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'meat', 'pies', 'course', 'sell', 'proverbial', 'hotcakes', 'Tension', 'when', 'Lovett', 'having', 'feelings', 'Todd', 'who', 'so', 'obsessed', 'revenge', 'lost', 'love', 'eyes', 'nothing', 'else', 'Burton', 'same', 'phantasmagoric', 'hallucinatory', 'visuals', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'did', 'previous', 'remake', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'when', 'right', 'down', 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'movie', 'just', 'looked', 'up', 'gave', 'two', 'half', 'back', '2006', 'over-the-top', 'Burton', 'vision', 'just', 'fine', 'when', 'doing', 'original', 'material', 'viz', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Beetlejuice', 'when', 'Burton', 'adaptations', 'always', 'preferred', 'much', 'lower-key', 'look', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'not', 'remake', 'similar', 'feel', 'best', 'film', 'Ed', 'Wood', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'fond', 'Sondheim', 'adaptation', 'Burton', 'rather', 'faithfully', 'here', 'other', 'incarnations', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'really', 'down', 'want', 'murder', 'cannibalism', 'lighthearted', 'whimsy', 'presented', 'here', 'want', 'dark', 'claustrophobic', 'presentation', 'musical', 'numbers', 'get', 'Moore', '2006', 'adaptation', '**']",N/A

If blood and music is your thing, then this film is for you perfectly done by Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. I was tickled pink as soon as I heard the film was announced. Johnny Depp was cast before anyone had heard him sing, but I knew it would work out. There were many uncertainties since it is one of the most difficult musicals on broadway. For me, the film is better than the musical because it is different but the musical itself stays the same. This is what REALLY got me into musicals. The fact that it is so is what makes it genius. With the Steelbook version, you not only get the first DVD with one special feature, but you also get a whole bunch of other goodies on the second one about how they made the film. Including stuff with Stephen Sondheim, it also talks about the legend of Sweeney Todd and how they made the gallons of blood and most of the other things in the film. As for the casting, it is flawless. Johnny Depp's portrayal is creepy and saddening at the same time. You learn of the pain he endured when his past was ripped apart and his singing is done well with a perfect British dialect. Helena Bonham Carter is not the best singer in the movie, but she is good enough to be the second lead role, in fact she is great. The film is detailed from the opening credits to the very tragic end. Sweeney's thirst for revenge increased as time went by and it changed many things about everybody. Alan Rickman, as always is a total delight and is a good duet with Johnny Depp. The lyrics in the songs carry the story and tell you what the characters are thinking so pay attention, because they have some truth in them. Don't expect a happy musical here, but do expect a phenomenal experience. How I love this film so much!! You're in for a fan-bloody-tastic time with the amazing music.

1133751,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001209SMS,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","The story of Sweeney Todd is what Charles Dickens might have come up with had he used Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" as his source of inspiration.  Of course, in a Dickens version, all those who found themselves on the wrong side of Todd's razor would be venal exploiters of the poor and working classes who clearly deserved the fate that befell them.  In Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of the story, however, people of virtually all social categories and walks of life get tossed indiscriminately into the meat grinder, in as grim a spectacle of democratic equanimity as we`ve encountered in quite some time.  For this is a tale of a man who allows the desire for vengeance to so completely overtake him that he quickly turns from being a righteous avenging angel seeking justice for himself and his loved ones to a maniacal serial murderer who kills for the sheer sake of killing (with a little culinary treat thrown in as a side benefit).Benjamin Barker starts off as a good-natured barber living with his impossibly sweet wife and brand new baby daughter in 19th Century London.  When a corrupt judge who has designs on Barker's wife throws the young man into prison on false charges, Barker transforms into a gloomy and bitter man, determined to exact his revenge on the individual who ruined his life, drove his wife to suicide and has made Barker's now-teenaged daughter an object of his unwanted, lascivious advances.  On his arrival back in London once again a free man, Barker changes his name to Sweeney Todd and resumes business in the barber shop located above Mrs. Lovett's thoroughly unhygienic meat pie emporium where the cockroaches barely outnumber the raisins in the recipe.  Eventually, the two entrepreneurs hit upon a scheme to systematically slice the throats of Todd's customers, then add the bodily remains to Mrs. Lovett's list of secret culinary ingredients.With ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" director Tim Burton has finally found the material he was born to make.  Dark as well as surrealistic, morbid as well as operatic, ""Sweeney Todd"" perfectly fits the Tim Burton style and temperament, and, indeed, the filmmaker has taken full advantage of the opportunity afforded by the property, allowing his imagination to run wild in the areas of art direction, set decoration, costume design and makeup.  Yet, while this is a beautifully crafted film from a technical standpoint, Burton never allows the visuals to overshadow the storyline or the characters.""Sweeney Todd"" is clearly not intended for all audiences.  It is certainly a different kind of musical, pitch-dark and violent and with no real choreography to speak of.  And any hopes for a sentimental, happily-ever-after resolution are washed away by the sanguinary nature of the scenario and a closing shot that is literally a tableaux steeped in blood.  Yet, there is one element that makes it all connect with audiences, and that is Johnny Depp's performance.  Depp could not have found a role more perfectly suited to his demeanor and talents than that of Sweeny Todd.  Never before has his brooding intensity and expression of wild-eyed mania been used to more impressive effect than it is here.  He makes a character whom it is often very hard to like into a person the audience can feel for and care about, no small feat in light of the many reprehensible actions he performs on screen.  Depp also does a more-than-adequate job with Sondheim's challenging tunes, especially given the actor's clearly limited range as a singer.Depp gets strong support from Helena Bonham Carter as his pasty-faced, death-hued partner-in-crime, Mrs. Lovett, while Sasha Baron Cohen and Alan Rickman bring subtle shadings to their otherwise hiss-able villains.",4,perfect vehicle for Burton and Depp,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3762,"['story', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'what', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'had', 'used', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'A', 'Modest', 'Proposal', 'source', 'inspiration', 'course', 'Dickens', 'version', 'who', 'found', 'wrong', 'side', 'Todd', 'razor', 'would', 'be', 'venal', 'exploiters', 'poor', 'working', 'classes', 'who', 'clearly', 'deserved', 'fate', 'befell', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'musical', 'treatment', 'story', 'however', 'people', 'virtually', 'social', 'categories', 'walks', 'life', 'get', 'tossed', 'indiscriminately', 'meat', 'grinder', 'as', 'grim', 'spectacle', 'democratic', 'equanimity', 've', 'encountered', 'quite', 'time', 'tale', 'man', 'who', 'desire', 'vengeance', 'so', 'completely', 'overtake', 'quickly', 'being', 'righteous', 'avenging', 'angel', 'seeking', 'justice', 'loved', 'ones', 'maniacal', 'serial', 'murderer', 'who', 'sheer', 'sake', 'killing', 'little', 'culinary', 'treat', 'thrown', 'side', 'benefit', '.Benjamin', 'Barker', 'off', 'good-natured', 'barber', 'living', 'impossibly', 'sweet', 'wife', 'brand', 'new', 'baby', 'daughter', '19th', 'Century', 'London', 'When', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'who', 'designs', 'Barker', 'wife', 'young', 'man', 'prison', 'false', 'charges', 'Barker', 'gloomy', 'bitter', 'man', 'determined', 'exact', 'revenge', 'individual', 'who', 'ruined', 'life', 'drove', 'wife', 'suicide', 'made', 'Barker', 'now-teenaged', 'daughter', 'object', 'unwanted', 'lascivious', 'advances', 'arrival', 'back', 'London', 'once', 'again', 'free', 'man', 'Barker', 'name', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'resumes', 'business', 'barber', 'shop', 'located', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'thoroughly', 'unhygienic', 'meat', 'pie', 'emporium', 'where', 'cockroaches', 'barely', 'outnumber', 'raisins', 'recipe', 'Eventually', 'two', 'entrepreneurs', 'hit', 'scheme', 'systematically', 'slice', 'throats', 'Todd', 'customers', 'then', 'add', 'bodily', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'list', 'secret', 'culinary', 'ingredients.With', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'finally', 'found', 'material', 'was', 'born', 'make', 'Dark', 'as', 'well', 'surrealistic', 'morbid', 'as', 'well', 'operatic', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'perfectly', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'style', 'temperament', 'indeed', 'filmmaker', 'taken', 'full', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'afforded', 'property', 'allowing', 'imagination', 'run', 'wild', 'areas', 'art', 'direction', 'set', 'decoration', 'costume', 'design', 'makeup', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'film', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'Burton', 'never', 'visuals', 'overshadow', 'storyline', 'characters', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'clearly', 'not', 'intended', 'audiences', 'certainly', 'different', 'kind', 'musical', 'pitch-dark', 'violent', 'real', 'choreography', 'speak', 'hopes', 'sentimental', 'happily-ever-after', 'resolution', 'are', 'washed', 'away', 'sanguinary', 'nature', 'scenario', 'closing', 'shot', 'literally', 'tableaux', 'steeped', 'blood', 'one', 'element', 'connect', 'audiences', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'Depp', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'found', 'role', 'more', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'demeanor', 'talents', 'Sweeny', 'Todd', 'Never', 'brooding', 'intensity', 'expression', 'wild-eyed', 'mania', 'been', 'used', 'more', 'impressive', 'effect', 'here', 'character', 'whom', 'often', 'very', 'hard', 'like', 'person', 'audience', 'can', 'feel', 'care', 'small', 'feat', 'light', 'many', 'reprehensible', 'actions', 'screen', 'Depp', 'also', 'more-than-adequate', 'job', 'Sondheim', 'challenging', 'tunes', 'especially', 'given', 'actor', 'clearly', 'limited', 'range', 'singer.Depp', 'strong', 'support', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'pasty-faced', 'death-hued', 'partner-in-crime', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'bring', 'subtle', 'shadings', 'otherwise', 'hiss-able', 'villains']",N/A

1133754,A2JCGI5QI9FIBD,B001209SMS,"R. Short ""robertsathard""","[2, 2]","Most of Tim Burton's movies are a lot of fun to watch and amazing to look at.  However, a lot of the times the narratives tend to be less than compelling and even though they were amazing to look at, everything else fades from memory quite quickly.  Notably exceptions being ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Ed Wood"".  Now comes, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" which is the most delicious work (pun intended) Burton has delivered in his twenty plus year as a director.To me ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" plays out like an evil version of one of those Disney animated musical from the early nineties.  Those movies seemed to be composed of two young lovers from different worlds who have to go to impossible ends to be with each other, and the girl often has a overbearing yet loving father, and there is always a villain to make sure the girl and boy are kept apart.  In this story the villain interferes with the girls life when she is a mere infant.As the movie opens ""Sweeney Todd(played flawlessly by Johnny Depp), formerly Benjamin Barker is returning to London after fifteen years of exile after being brought up on a false charge.  The audience quickly learns that Benjamin Barker had a wife named Lucy who he was madly in love with, but so was the unscrupulous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) who has Barker sent away so he can take the wife as his own.  After many rejections by the woman, the Judge takes Mrs. Barker by force, driving her mad.  And to make things even better for the family the Judge Turpin adopts Barker's daughter Johanna to raise as his own, and imprison her as she blossoms into womanhood with the intent of marrying her.Shortly after returning to London Todd returns to his home, which is above a shopped own by Helena Boham-Carter-Burton's Mrs. Lovett, who happens to sell the worst meat pies in London.  Mrs. Lovett realizes right away that Sweeney Todd is really Benjamin Barker and takes an immediate liking to him.  In the meantime Todd's imprisoned daughter, Johanna, spies a sailor (the same sailor who delivers Todd to London) and the two fall instantly in love.Now in most Disney animated movies the action is centered on the young lovers while the adults are put in the background.  Most of the action here is on Sweeney Todd, a moping monster whose only purpose in life is to have revenge for the wrongs done to him.This movie is interesting in many ways, namely the relationship between Mr. Todd and Mrs. Lovett.  It's obviously she will do anything to win his affection.  However, he is indifferent to her unless she is able to help him get his revenge.  There are several scenes in which Todd speaks to Mrs. Lovett as if she is just a distraction.  Despite his bitter rage and nastiness Mrs. Lovett still dreams of moving to the sea and getting married to Mr. Todd.  One of the best scenes in the movie is when it seems as if Todd is about to open up to Mrs. Lovett and then a clue about how to get his revenge on the judge comes his way, and she is instantly forgotten.Judge Turpin has to be the nastiest  villain in all of Tim Burton's movies. And these are villains that include the Joker, the Penguin, blood thirsty Martians, and the boogie man.  This guy not only destroys a family on the whim of his own lust, he intends to marry the daughter.  The fact that the daughter falls for the young sailor puts her in a terrible situation.And there this is Mrs. Lovett.  Here is a character with the morals of a half starved alley cat.  She thinks murder is inexcusable unless it is justified (A character tries to bribe Sweeney Todd) or if it can be to her benefit (Using the bodies of victims to boost her pie selling business).  Part of the greatness of her role is how nonchalantly she reacts to the murders of several people as long as she stands to gain by them.As great as the story is I can honestly stay Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter can both hold their own as singers.  Alan Rickman, great actor, but not so much.  The atmosphere of the sets also contribute to the melancholy feel of this movies.  Tim Burton has made violent, bloody movies before but they always tended to have an upbeat tone.  As I said, it reminded me if an evil Disney movie.  After seeing  ""Beauty and the Beast"" I left the theater humming the songs.  After this one I walked out feeling like I just had attended a funeral.

However I was truly surprised by what I saw.  I think thre reason I did like it so much is mainly because it kind of goes against every other musical out there.  First off the singing isn't great.  I'm not saying it's bad, but the movie doesn't really rely on it's singing to advance the plot.  It relies more on the images and reactions that are visually seen on the screen.  Second, this sort of subject matter hasn't really been dealt with in a musical before. (At least not one that I've seen)  And last, the ending is far from a feel-good ending.  Sure there are other movies that have tragic endings but at least in those the characters learn a valuable lesson.  At the end of this film none of the characters are better off than when they started, if anything they are all scarred, some mentally and some physically from the actions that others see and take.  In all Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual.  He is by far one of the best actors in the business, and Helena Bonham Carter is right up there with him every step of the way.  The direction is great, and some of the dark, setting adds a lot to the film.

Arriving on the shores of London are Mr. Sweeney Todd (played by Johnny Depp), who once was a barber named Benjamin Barker, and his sailor friend Anthony.  Anthony knows the tale of Barker, how he was put away in prison unjustly so that the evil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) could have his beautiful wife Lucy.  Todd is free, and wants his revenge.From the ship he heads to Fleet Street, where his old barber shop used to be.  Beneath the shop is Mrs. Lovett's (Helena Bonham Carter) pie shop, where she sells the worst meat pies in London.  Mrs. Lovett finishes the tale of Barker by telling Todd that Turpin raped Lucy, after which Lucy took poison.  Barker's daughter was now the young ward of Turpin.  Mrs. Lovett recognizes Barker, and rents his old rooms to him.  Todd scares up business by beating London's number one barber, Adolfo Bamford, in a ""shave-off"".  Now business takes off, but Todd's most wanted customers have yet to arrive; Judge Turpin and his lackey, Beadle.  Subplots unfold as Todd and Lovett sort of adopt Adolfo's young servant boy Toby, and Anthony walks by the Judge's house only to fall in love with young Joanna, Barker's daughter, through the window where she sits all day, imprisoned in her own house.Being a Tim Burton film, the dark atmosphere is rich and uncontrived.  He brings a grimy gloominess to London, and the characters of the film.  I've never seen Depp or Carter look darker or older than they do in 'Sweeney Todd'.  While the filming is dim, the blood stands out bright red, making a remarkable play with color.  There are some awfully nice throat-cutting scenes, very bloody, but I was hoping for a little more gore.  The plot fit very well with being a musical, and I love the little song Todd and Lovett sing when they figure out how to dispose of the bodies.  (Who would have known Depp could sing, or Rickman for that matter?)The fact that 'Sweeney Todd' is a horror movie AND a musical is interesting, to say the least.  The plot is good and the acting superb.  Burton did a wonderful job with this film.  Watch out for a delicious surprise ending, too.  This movie is definitely worth a purchase, as long as you don't mind musicals or a little blood.

And he has an accomplice who owns a tavern and helps dispose of his victims by.....mincing them into meat pasties?Imagine those many years ago when Stephen Sondheim's principle backers heard a summation of ""Sweeney Todd:  The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.""  Not an easy sell even before PC started being a concern for the entertainment industry.  And while it would go on to become one of the most heralded musicals of stage history, well, you just can't picture ANYONE taking a bigger risk, financially and artistically, to bring it to the screen.Enter Tim Burton.  It's hard to picture now, with all the delightfully quirky films under his belt, but he did do some (fairly) mainstream films.  It was only after he got box office cred that studios took risks on his more outlandish and, dare I say it, darker offerings.  While he had some box office failures in this mode (""Planet of the Apes""), it turns out people had a liking for his artistic delivery of story.  Burton is, at the very least, certainly creative visually.  My view of the selling of ""Sweeney Todd"" in today's film development Hell was clinched when the studios were told, ""oh, yeah, and we have a solid commitment from Tim Burton.""  They could have tossed in Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter and all the other talent they had lined up to make the movie (a veritable litany of success), and probably gotten a ""no thanks.""  But add Burton to the mix of this beauty of a film and....ah, he was, to use the cliche', tailor-made for bringing it to the screen.Sondheim purists have heard, correctly, that a lot of the score, songlist, and book was dropped.  Some of it was significantly changed.  It has been, but with Mr. Sondheim highly endorsing it, you have to imagine it's as good for film as the original was done for the stage.  It's sung very well, with the actors sometimes reaching very high heights for actors who aren't singers.  Depp is surprisingly gifted in musical delivery and while Bonham-Carter will never compete with Celene Dion in volume and power (thank you God for that!), she is very capable and pleasant to listen to.  What they bring to the table is their acting chops.  One expects over-the-top with a story that is a mixture of melodrama, grotesquerie, and even broad comedy.  The cast of ""Todd"" surpasses musical theater gimmickry by using their skills to bring about the subtle touches to their fantastic roles.  Depp's Todd is insane, vicious, and barbaric in persuit of revenge, and yet you can see the haunting pain that drives him, giving Sweeney a touch of sadness, a window into what the man might have been if his life developed differently.  Bonham-Carter is hysterical and wicked as Mrs. Lovett, someone who was thoroughly incapable of cooking decent food until Todd gave her some most unusual motivation.  With her as well, we get the hystrionics we expect, but we see the gentler side of her as well.  Is it the madness of Sweeney that drives her, or perhaps, if they had a more normal courtship, is it genuine love that makes her grow?  Alas, Bonham-Carter, like Depp, lets us only see just enough to add a soupscon of humanity to an otherwise batty character.Burton also delivers on his trademark visual imagery.  We have a weird, sepia-toned world where nothing is completely color or black-and-white.  The only hints of color are in idyllic fantasy or memory (example - Sweeney's flashback of life before framing).  Also, there's no brightness or comfort.  Burton's London is a dire, shadowy, wonderfully creepy Dickensonian city of hidden fear and rats.  The only thing in bright color in this corner of Hell is the blood.  And there is blood.  Lots of blood.  Buckets of blood.  In disgustingly viscous gouts, gushes, drips, and slithery splatters (all this just in the opening credits alone, never mind the scores of murders!).  Also in color is the meat made of the victims.  And the flames of the pie oven.  Thus the queasy need be warned - what you've heard is true.  We who've seen it aren't exaggerating.

It says something beyond just telling a story.The characterization is good as well. The character of Ms. Lovett is perfectly realized and there's some complexity there beneath the surface.The visual stylism and the great use of color grading throughout the film really contribute to this films greatness.

I should mention, this movie is not nearly as bloody as I thought it might be, in fact, it was rather minimal in my opinion.  In truth, i found there to be an extremely witty layer of dark humor running throughout the film.  I was highly amused in many places.  The humor reminded me of the works of Edward Gorey: dark, dismal, and extremely funny.  In fact, many of characters in the movie looked like Edward Gorey characters in their period dress and stark makeup contrasts.  I was more than delighted with this film, and I strongly encourage potential viewers not to be dissuaded by the gore factor.

Wells' ""the Invisible Man"", and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. One of the more underated London-based books ""the String of Pearls"", or better known to Broadway as Sweeney Todd, has finally joined his brothers of extrodinary literature in the silver screen as the musical ""Sweeney Todd- The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"".Todd's tale was one of the biggest broadway bangs when it debut. Keeping with the style of broadway music, Tim Burton recruits the likes of Johnny Depp and Alan Rickman(with Timothy Spall as his servent, go figure) to yodel their tales of triumph and terror with surprising success. The orchastrated score was kept simple, but devistating none the less, all musical numbers where performed to the apex of quality, for both the perfomers and the band. I would expect nothing less, this was an award winning musical after all.For those who don't know about this hack-n-slash tale, Sweeney Todd(Depp), a gifted barber, arrives in gothic London after serving a false account of rape in labour camp for 15 years. After visiting his old shop, Todd devises a plot with the baker/land lady, Mrs. Lovett(Carter), to dispose of the corrupt Judge Turpin(Rickman) that locked him away, making a healthy deposit of other human casulties to the bake furnace for pies along the way. Many aspects of Todd's and Turpin's characters looked as if they where taken from a Jean ValJean(Les Miserable) personality who's led astray. While in no means the only colors are black and white, but the cobblestone streets are shown in color when speaking of symbolism, in an otherwise opaque color scheme of a movie that just might be considered a greek tragedy.Sweeney Todd is a flawless film, having beautifully executed acting and song in one swift stroke, becoming a favorite film of mine, and one that should be held in the same high regards as the Penny Dreadful novel and Broadway Musical. The only problem holding it back was a personal nick of mine. Having grown-up on the Harry Potter books and movies, seeing Rickman play as the potions master Snape, now still in character, and now as a singing judge(even though it was a beautiful attempt) just felt a bit corny.4.5/5",4,A Close Shave To Perfection,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,2398,"['back', 'alleys', 'London', 'have', 'been', 'host', 'many', 'most', 'revered', '19th', 'century', 'pieces', 'literature', 'spawning', 'greatest', 'stories', 'protagonists', 'villians', 'such', 'Charles', 'Dickins', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'One', 'more', 'underated', 'London-based', 'books', 'String', 'Pearls', 'better', 'known', 'Broadway', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'finally', 'joined', 'brothers', 'extrodinary', 'literature', 'silver', 'screen', 'musical', 'Sweeney', 'Todd-', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', '.Todd', 'tale', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'broadway', 'bangs', 'when', 'debut', 'Keeping', 'style', 'broadway', 'music', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'likes', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'servent', 'go', 'figure', 'yodel', 'tales', 'triumph', 'terror', 'surprising', 'success', 'orchastrated', 'score', 'was', 'kept', 'simple', 'devistating', 'none', 'less', 'musical', 'numbers', 'where', 'performed', 'apex', 'quality', 'perfomers', 'band', 'would', 'expect', 'nothing', 'less', 'was', 'award', 'winning', 'musical', 'all.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'hack-n-slash', 'tale', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Depp', 'gifted', 'barber', 'gothic', 'London', 'serving', 'false', 'account', 'rape', 'labour', 'camp', '15', 'years', 'visiting', 'old', 'shop', 'Todd', 'plot', 'baker/land', 'lady', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Carter', 'dispose', 'corrupt', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Rickman', 'locked', 'away', 'making', 'healthy', 'deposit', 'other', 'human', 'casulties', 'bake', 'furnace', 'pies', 'way', 'Many', 'aspects', 'Todd', 'Turpin', 'characters', 'looked', 'where', 'taken', 'Jean', 'ValJean', 'Les', 'Miserable', 'personality', 'who', 'led', 'astray', 'only', 'colors', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'cobblestone', 'streets', 'are', 'shown', 'color', 'when', 'speaking', 'symbolism', 'otherwise', 'opaque', 'color', 'scheme', 'movie', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'greek', 'tragedy.Sweeney', 'Todd', 'flawless', 'film', 'having', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'acting', 'song', 'one', 'swift', 'stroke', 'becoming', 'favorite', 'film', 'mine', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'same', 'high', 'regards', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'novel', 'Broadway', 'Musical', 'only', 'problem', 'holding', 'back', 'was', 'personal', 'nick', 'mine', 'Having', 'grown-up', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'movies', 'seeing', 'Rickman', 'play', 'potions', 'master', 'Snape', 'now', 'still', 'character', 'now', 'singing', 'judge', 'even', 'was', 'beautiful', 'attempt', 'just', 'felt', 'bit', 'corny.4.5/5']",N/A

But Burton certainly has his own style that attracts lots of movie goers.  This is a movie for Tim Burton followers.  It may even be a good movie for those who don't normally like musicals.Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker.  A man who has returned from being wrongfully imprisoned for fifteen years.  When he returns he assumes the name Sweeney Todd.  He meets a woman named Mrs. Lovett, played very well by Helen Bohnam Carter.  She tells Todd that the judge who imprisoned him poisoned and killed his wife and has taken his daughter Johanna.  Todd swears revenge on Judge Turpin (played by Alan Rickman).  In order to do that, though, he'll have to re-establish himself.  In a contest to see who can be the best barber he wins and opens up shop.  Now it's just a matter of time before the Judge is seated in his chair.  Except there are a few problems in his midst.  The first is the barber he won against.  Who knows Todd's true identity.  The second is Anthony, the man he returned with.  Anthony fancies Johanna and the judge is not too happy about that.  When Judge Turpin is within Todd's midst, Anthony ruins it all.  This causes Todd to go mad and ultimately become the Demon Barber of Fleet Street.Despite being based off the Stephen Sondheim production, Sweeney Todd has a lot of Tim Burton's trade packed into it.  Unusually pale characters, wild hairstyles and impressive set designs.  This is Tim Burton's sixth collaboration with Johnny Depp, and it may be the best role Depp has filled for Burton since Edward Scissorhands.  He manages to bring life to Todd's character and make him scary and malicious.  Just the same, Helen Bohnam Carter serves as the perfect companion.  Like Depp, her hair is wild and she's a misunderstood character just like Todd is.  Together on screen they're perfect.  The best part about the movie may be the singing and music itself.Tim Burton has been known to work with Danny Elfman when it comes to music in his films.  Since this is based off a musical, however, Burton doesn't use Danny Elfman's help and instead relies quite heavily on the source material he was given.  A lot of the music and lines comes from Sondheim's play.  Despite being a musical, however, the movie isn't drowned out in song.  There's actually a good balance of spoken dialog and musical numbers.  All the cast members can actually sing too.If there was anything that might ultimately turn audiences away, it would be the amount of blood featured in the movie.  Sweeney Todd definitely earns its ""R"" rating by easily being one of the bloodiest movies of 2007.  If you're a movie goer that has a lot of problems with blood, then Sweeney Todd is certainly not the movie for you.  Another thing that might not settle well with movie goers is learning that Mrs. Lovett puts the victims into the pies that are served to the town.  You never actually see Mrs. Lovett cook anyone, at least.Sweeney Todd is easily Tim Burton's best film in years.  The performances and singing are also incredible.  This is a good movie for Tim Burton fans.  This is a good movie for people who like musicals.  This is even a good movie for people who don't normally like musicals.

1133773,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B001209SMS,S. Schell,"[0, 0]","Attend the tale of Sweeney ToddHis skin was pale and his eye was oddHe shaved the faces of gentlemenWho never thereafter were heard of again...The long-awaited adaptation of ""Sweeney Todd"" from stage to screen has finally arrived and Tim Burton is reaping rave reviews, Christmas cheer and the joy of the birth of his second child with longtime girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter.  With an already extensive body of work, Burton has most certainly completed his largest project to date and not only is it his magnum opus, it is Oscar bait as well.Returning for his and Burton's sixth collaboration, Johnny Depp shoulders the role of the title character, a barber of good repute whose beautiful wife Lucy is stolen away by the conniving Judge Turpin (Rickman).  Returning to London from a 15-year exile, the woeful and bitter Benjamin Barker (Depp) assumes the moniker of Sweeney Todd and in cahoots with the wily Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter) begins slicing men's throats en masse with his prized razors.  He soon discovers that his daughter Johanna (Wisener) is a virtual prisoner in Turpin's home and is determined to exact his revenge, all the while providing the main ingredient for Mrs. Lovett's re-popularized meat pies.Depp looks like Beethoven on crank (or Edward Scissorhands if he'd gotten a perm) and Bonham Carter is a Raggedy Ann doll from hell.  Both give admirable performances but singing-wise, they're sub-par.  Yes, yes, I know that Depp never got a single singing lesson and coached himself and he's to be commended.  Bonham Carter did get singing lessons and even studied baking to prepare for her performance as Mrs. Lovett but she still manages to do nothing more than carry a tune, and that's my assessment of most of the other castmates as well.  I found myself more than once thinking, ""No, no, no...SING, DAMMIT!""  To hear these songs sung by the 1979 original Broadway cast has Depp and Bonham Carter PALING in comparison to the likes of Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. The only voices that rise slightly above mediocre are Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony (""Johanna"") and Ed Sanders as Toby (""Not While I'm Around"").  Broadway material most of these people are NOT, especially when trying to bring to life the music of Stephen Sondheim but their acting makes up for it, thank goodness.Of course, most of the youth who will flock to the cineplex are fans of the ""Pirates of the Carribean"" films and they won't be disappointed.  Depp faithfully emotes with utmost excellence and gives Sweeney a snarling intensity worthy of another Oscar nod.  Bonham Carter brings a certain sweet psychosis to our dearest Mrs. Lovett and Alan Rickman makes us smile as well as squirm with his portrayal of the perverted Judge Turpin. My personal favorite is Sacha Baron Cohen as the flamboyant Signor Pirelli - he'll get many chuckles as well as ovations with his overwrought Italian accent and surprising operatics.For those who are fans of Tim Burton's dark and gothic vision, you will salivate over his version of 19th-century London.  He paints a fantastically dank and dirty metropolis awash in smoke, fog and pestilence.  Renowned costume designer Colleen Atwood (Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands) joins Burton's crew once again, draping Depp in frills, thrills and leather and appareling Bonham Carter in playfully daring couture.  Hair and makeup are superb and the violent nature of the story has not been sugarcoated in the least - ""Sweeney"" is fully saturated in gore, blood literally spraying from people's throats and corpses plunging into the dungeon-like basement of the pie shop with a sickening thud.On a scale of one to ten, ""Sweeney Todd"" rates an 8.

1133778,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001209SMS,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 4]","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" (2007) is the latest collaboration of that imaginative young director Tim Burton, and one of his favorite stars, the versatile Johnny Depp.  It costars the beauteous Helena Bonham Carter, currently the director's main squeeze.  It won two Golden Globes, one for Depp as Best Actor, one as Best Picture, Musical or Comedy.  It also won two Oscars, to Dante Ferretti for art direction, another to Francesca Lo Schiavo, for set decoration. It is based on the 1979 Broadway musical of the same name, which was written by Hugh Wheeler, with music by the celebrated Stephen Sondheim, and was directed by Hal Prince.  That entertainment starred Len Cariou as Todd, and Angela Lansbury, as Mrs. Lovett.  I clearly remember having seen it, and loved it, but I must say, although theater has the advantage of intimacy, what Prince could do on that stage can't hold a candle to what Burton achieves in the filmed version.  Of course, many viewers, and reviewers, have complained about the buckets of blood in which Burton has bathed the story, but he has also filmed it with great sweep and visual flair; he has created a believable 19th century London, England, in which the action takes place; and he has gotten superb performances from his actors.Depp plays Sweeney Todd, who once was nave; he was the simple barber Benjamin Barker, had a beautiful wife and a lovely infant daughter, and was unlucky enough that they should catch the eye of the unscrupulous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, and is there a rule that 1/3 of movies made in England must star him, or is he just that valuable an actor?)  Turpin has the barber transported to Australia, a place from which convicts are forbidden to return, but return Barker does, as Todd, determined to find his wife and child, and/or to have his revenge. Bonham Carter plays his former/future landlady, Mrs. Lovett, whose shop sells the worst meat pies in London. Barber and landlady will get caught up in a mad, murderous scheme that will ultimately prove disastrous for them.Timothy Spall turns in a strong performance as the oily, corrupt Beadle Bamford, Turpin's henchman.  Sacha Baron Cohen (""Borat"") does very well as Davey Collins, AKA Adolfo Pirelli, rival barber.  Jamie Campbell Bower plays Todd's young shipmate Anthony Hope.  And 15-year old Edward Sanders gives a remarkable performance as the boy Toby, Pirelli's helper.Toby and Mrs. Lovett duet on ""Nothing's Going to Harm You, Not While I'm Around,"" and produce a song of unearthly beauty.  Todd and the judge also duet, on ""Pretty Women,"" a taste in the first act and the full number in the third, and it's just gorgeous.  There may be too much recitative for some viewers, but the score has Sondheim's typical wit and edginess, and is never less than enjoyable.  And who knew all these actors could sing so well?Burton's filmed tragedy has great intensity and impact; surely, to some degree, because Depp and Bonham Carter are both such beautiful, magnetic, sensual performers.  Cariou is an excellent stage actor/singer, and was about Depp's current age when he created the part of Todd; however, let's just say he is no Johnny Depp.  When Angela Lansbury created Mrs. Lovett, she was more than a decade older than Bonham Carter is now, and Lansbury has always photographed older.  She's a highly competent actress/singer, perhaps best known today for her long television run as Jessica Fletcher, in""Murder, She Wrote.""  And she began her film career, in 1944 and-5, with two Oscar-nominated turns as saucy, sexy servant girls in ""Gaslight,"" and ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" But she'd been playing mothers for decades.Both play and movie are based on the 19th century legend of Sweeney Todd, with which parents scared their disobedient children.  Some records appear to show that he really existed, but their authenticity is disputed.  Fleet Street is an old and famous street.  It first appears on maps in the 14th century, connecting the City of London with the City of Westminster, running alongside the river Fleet.  The river became heavily contaminated with sewage, girdled in and bridged by wooden structures, so contaminated it actually exploded(as, more recently, did an Ohio river), and burnt its wooden surroundings.  A character in play and movie keeps complaining about the terrible smell from Mrs. Lovett's Fleet Street chimneys at night, but I rather suspect the street smelled day and night in the 19th century. Even more so, as we are given several glimpses of the sewer beneath the street and the water can only be running in the old river bed.Nevertheless, printers and publishers located on the street from the 15th Century; more recently, for more than a century, England's most famous newspapers were headquartered there, and ""Fleet Street"" still serves as a synonym for the English newspaper industry, and the kind of hectic, celebrity-mad journalism it practices.  The last major paper left Fleet Street in the 1980's; Reuters left in 2005.  The street's much quieter these days, mainly the site of numerous respectable law offices.  You'd never know it once was called home, at least in legend, by Sweeney Todd, the demon barber.

1133779,A1C9GCHR99WX3F,B001209SMS,Stephen Verhaeren,"[1, 4]","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street shows us exactly why  it is best to leave a musical on stage. To get even until a 2 hours movie, or at its running time of 1 hour and 56 minutes you lose up a lot of the story, and songs or have to shorten up the songs. Which shows they do both, so at best try to see it as a musical and then what the movie. But the cast is interesting, you have the majority of the cast that may not be known for singing, so you think you would hear them dubbed. And you have 3 of the actors that are best known for their roles in Harry Potter. And you have the movie lead by Johnny Depp that is known for his acting, but not for singing. But he does make a good Sweeney Todd , but here is still one good question that we just don't know the answer to it, is just how does he get the name Sweeney Todd? And he also is known for appearing in Tim Burton movies, which this film is directed by Tim Burton.  But whatever you do don't watch it with the kids, this is a R rated film, and one of the rare R rated films that is not rated for language. The movies opens with Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) now known as Sweeney Todd who is returning to London after being in jail on false charges for the past 15 years. He and his shipmate Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) where they sing about that there is No Place Like London. He also tells him of a tale about a barber and his wife, without reveling the names of the barber or his wife, and the fact it is his story. He was falsely charged by a judge named Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and sent to prison who was taken by his wife Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly). He then asks Anthony to leave him, and they both go their ways. He then goes to a meat pie shop owned by Mrs Mrs. Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). But she thinks he is just another person coming into her business to give her business. She offers him up a meat pie that she claims is the worst in London. He then notices a room that is upstairs after she offers to bring him into her home to help wash down the taste.  He asks her if times are so hard, why doesn't she rent out the room, but she says that nobody will go near it because they think it is haunted. And she tells him the story of the barber and the wife, which she doesn't know but has to wonder if this is really him back, and she revels that Judge Turpin and Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall) lure her to his house, to a party with masks, where with him also in a mask, and he rapes her, which causes her to scream, which also calls him to scream, which then confirms that he is Benjamin Baker and is back, she then tells him that she poisoned herself with arsenic, and that she tried to stop her but she won't listen to her. And that Judge Turpin also took in his daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener). Which causes to make Sweeney Todd realize after hoping for 15 years that he was dreaming on returning to his wife and child. She also returns his old razors, but that is all just the beginning as Sweeney Todd vows to take his revenge.",5,Johnny Depp takes on a new role in Sweeney Todd,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,3038,"['Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'exactly', 'why', 'best', 'leave', 'musical', 'stage', 'get', 'even', '2', 'hours', 'movie', 'running', 'time', '1', 'hour', '56', 'minutes', 'lose', 'up', 'lot', 'story', 'songs', 'have', 'shorten', 'up', 'songs', 'do', 'so', 'best', 'try', 'see', 'musical', 'then', 'what', 'movie', 'cast', 'interesting', 'have', 'majority', 'cast', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'known', 'singing', 'think', 'would', 'hear', 'dubbed', 'have', '3', 'actors', 'are', 'best', 'known', 'roles', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'have', 'movie', 'lead', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'known', 'acting', 'not', 'singing', 'make', 'good', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'here', 'still', 'one', 'good', 'question', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'answer', 'just', 'how', 'get', 'name', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'also', 'known', 'appearing', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movies', 'film', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'kids', 'R', 'rated', 'film', 'one', 'rare', 'R', 'rated', 'films', 'not', 'rated', 'language', 'movies', 'Benjamin', 'Barker', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'now', 'known', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'who', 'returning', 'London', 'being', 'jail', 'false', 'charges', 'past', '15', 'years', 'shipmate', 'Anthony', 'Hope', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'where', 'sing', 'Place', 'London', 'also', 'tale', 'barber', 'wife', 'reveling', 'names', 'barber', 'wife', 'fact', 'story', 'was', 'falsely', 'charged', 'judge', 'named', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'sent', 'prison', 'who', 'was', 'taken', 'wife', 'Lucy', 'Laura', 'Michelle', 'Kelly', 'then', 'Anthony', 'leave', 'go', 'ways', 'then', 'meat', 'pie', 'shop', 'owned', 'Mrs', 'Mrs.', 'Nellie', 'Lovett', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'just', 'person', 'coming', 'business', 'give', 'business', 'up', 'meat', 'pie', 'worst', 'London', 'then', 'room', 'upstairs', 'bring', 'home', 'help', 'wash', 'down', 'taste', 'times', 'are', 'so', 'hard', 'why', ""n't"", 'rent', 'room', 'nobody', 'will', 'go', 'think', 'haunted', 'story', 'barber', 'wife', ""n't"", 'know', 'wonder', 'really', 'back', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Beadle', 'Bamford', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'lure', 'house', 'party', 'masks', 'where', 'also', 'mask', 'scream', 'also', 'scream', 'then', 'Benjamin', 'Baker', 'back', 'then', 'poisoned', 'arsenic', 'tried', 'stop', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'also', 'took', 'daughter', 'Johanna', 'Jayne', 'Wisener', 'Which', 'make', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'realize', 'hoping', '15', 'years', 'was', 'dreaming', 'returning', 'wife', 'child', 'also', 'old', 'razors', 'just', 'beginning', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'take', 'revenge']",N/A

Tim Burton is the perfect director for this very off-beat, but not ""family friendly"" musical.Other than the film's deviously ironic, but somewhat lackluster ending, this film is flawless.  Since most are familiar with this Broadway classic and considering that Amazon has really done an outstanding job with their review and synopsis, I will dispense with any summary here, not even a brief one.  I do want to focus what made this film so perfect in my view:1) The casting could not have been more perfectly accomplished.  Depp was born for this role, and Carter is wonderful as his cohort in crime and gives great subtly to her part.  Her soul-filled eyes convey such sincere emotion, even when sarcastic.  The supporting cast, especially Alan Rickman as the sick judge, are all spot on.2) The music of Sondheim is terrific and although much is cut from the Broadway show for the film, his talents are clearly visible and timeless and the cast does very well with their limited vocal ranges.3)The cinematography is first-rate and the blue tint with the splashes of color are perfect for this genre.  The death scenes are admittedly gruesome, but the strawberry red tint against the generally washed out bluish color of the film makes them feel a bit cartoonish.  Still, this isn't a film for the ""whole family"" as some have noted.  Any family member below 13 or so really shouldn't see this no matter how much they love Depp from his ""Pirates"" films, but each parent has to decide for themselves what is appropriate or inappropriate and this is just my humble opinion.4) The direction is confident, focused, and visionary as most of Burton's work are.  He is at his best when working with a cast familiar with his style and approach.  He has to be one of the most under appreciated directors around.  I consistently enjoy all of his films no matter how bizarre a few of them are.5) The set designs are outstanding as they look so real.  One feels totally transported in time while watching this film.Well, that's about it for me on this one.  So, buy or rent this film, sit back with the older members of your family, and enjoy a bowl of popcorn.

While I applaud Tim Burton for making Steven Sondheim's masterpiece accessible to a new generation, the musical performances here seem flat and limited in comparison.  Helena Carter lacks the cheery, bubbly desperation of Angela Landsbury's Mrs. Lovett; Johnny Depp's voice seems flat and even smarmy -- without the seething, powerful rage of George Hearn or Len Cariou (on the original cast album).  This is a slick Hollywood production and is only OK in its own right. Other productions (even Patti Lupone / George Hearn's concert performance) are far better musically.  This film/soundtrack demonstrates the superiority of true stage professionals -- sadly, the cast here does not deliver the full power, humor, and twisted beauty of this classic story of inhumanity and descent into madness.  This Hollywood production lacks a lot in comparison; Burton butchers it a bit -- omitting significant elements of the story, and goes overboard on over-the-top blood and gore, yielding a campy horror flick.

This does not make the movie any less excellent; its medium is different and some sacrifices have to be made to appeal to a larger audience.  For example, Judge Turpin is shown to be much more openly perverse in the movie rather than the musical, and his piousness is downplayed to make him more of a cheer-when-the-bad-guy-gets-it villain (note that, in the musical, Turpin plays Peeping Tom on his ward even has he's /flagellating himself/ asking for forgiveness from God, making him look more like a tortured soul).  Other than the requisite simplifications to prevent it from taking three hours, the movie stands well on its own with a darker, grittier take; there's definitely more 'dark' than 'comedy' here.  Johnny Depp has been rightfully praised for his performance; his decision to attempt more of a punk rock angle rather than an operatic singer certainly plays to the strengths in his voice and actually strengthens the character as well, given how he manages to spit out lyrics drenched with hate and revenge... musically.",4,Stands on its own,1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,1147,"[""'m"", 'long-time', 'fan', 'original', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'kept', 'noticing', 'differences', 'versions', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'less', 'excellent', 'medium', 'different', 'sacrifices', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'appeal', 'larger', 'audience', 'example', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'shown', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'openly', 'perverse', 'movie', 'rather', 'musical', 'piousness', 'downplayed', 'make', 'more', 'cheer-when-the-bad-guy-gets-it', 'villain', 'note', 'musical', 'Turpin', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'ward', 'even', '/flagellating', 'himself/', 'asking', 'forgiveness', 'God', 'making', 'look', 'more', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Other', 'requisite', 'simplifications', 'prevent', 'taking', 'three', 'hours', 'movie', 'well', 'own', 'darker', 'grittier', 'take', 'definitely', 'more', ""'dark"", ""'comedy"", 'here', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'been', 'rightfully', 'praised', 'performance', 'decision', 'attempt', 'more', 'punk', 'rock', 'angle', 'rather', 'operatic', 'singer', 'certainly', 'strengths', 'voice', 'actually', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'given', 'how', 'spit', 'out', 'lyrics', 'drenched', 'hate', 'revenge', 'musically']",N/A

If I told you that musical would be a slasher film directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, I definitely wouldn't believe myself. Oddly enough, that very scenario happened with Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.The film-adapted from the Steven Sondheim play-tells the story of a London barber, wrongfully accused of a fake crime by a corrupt judge out only to steal his beautiful wife. The barber (obviously Depp) spends years in prison, finally escaping and returning to London on a sailing vessel to take his revenge on the judge (Alan Rickman) who ruined his life. He learns upon arrival that the judge essentially killed his wife and stole his daughter to raise as his own, so he'll have hell to pay when Sweeney Todd catches him.Somehow, he gets mixed up with a very twisted and creepy meatpie maker, and the two begin an odd relationship of running a restaurant and killing people to solve the issue of the meat shortage. Todd slashes and cuts his way through victim after victim, all the while plotting his revenge and dreaming of the day the judge would become one of his creepy pseudo-girlfriend's pies.The story isn't fantastic, but it's just odd and twisted enough to be catching. Based on an urban legend (which I learned via the special features) it's definitely a unique narrative. What really carries the film outside of Burton's presentation (grim and grey with a splash of blood thrown in) is the job well done by the actors in the movie. None of the main characters in the film (the barber, judge, henchman or pie maker) have a background in theatre or music, yet when it comes time to sing they carry a tune surprisingly well. Mixed in are several actual singers (and Sascha Baron Cohen himself), rounding out the cast in a nice way.My main issue with the movie is in the songs themselves. While some are fantastic, too often the singing resorts to what I like to call singsong narrative, as characters sing about what they're doing, or sing out normal conversations. There are only two songs in the entire movie which couldn't equally be said as speaking lines, and to me that hurts the musical aspect. If you're going to do a musical, why not go all out and focus on songs rather than just having characters sing instead of speak?With the two disc special edition, there are plenty of features thrown in on the bonus disc. From the behind the scenes ""Making this movie was fun!"" reels to interviews, there's a little bit for everyone. The two most memorable pieces are the history of the story in Sweeney Todd and where it came from, and an interview with Sondheim as he explains the process of making the play into the film, and his thoughts on the finished project.Overall, Sweeney Todd is by no means a perfect movie, but as far as musicals go it's a cut above the rest. (Totally unintentional.) The few real songs are catchy, and the atmosphere and setting of the movie will be in your mind for days. Just don't expect to eat any meatpies once you're done watching.CONTENT: 4/5The singing is good, and the film is great from a analytic standpoint. The only weak spots are the utter uselessness of several characters who serve as nothing more than a way to remind us of what Todd's plan is, and the lack of true, authentic songs. Isn't this a musical?VIDEO: 4.5/5Love him or hate him, you have to admit that Tim Burton has a style entirely his own, and that comes across brilliantly in Sweeney Todd. Usually with dark movies like this the DVD transfer is filled with grainy blacks or scenes just too dark, but Sweeney Todd is a near perfect transfer of the film, and there are no details lost in even the darkest of scenes.AUDIO: 3/5Can Johnny Depp and crew sing? Yes. Fantastic? Not really. Cohen does a great job as the (surprising) competitor barber, and the kid in the movie blows the rest of the cast ouf of the water.EXTRAS: 2.5/5There are plenty of them, but for the most part they're highly forgettable. A few gems, but the worthwhile parts could easily have fit on the single disc version. If you absolutely love musicals and want to know everything that goes into making one, you'll find some nice pieces to watch. Otherwise... Not so much.REPLAY: 2.5/5Some people can watch this over and over, and listen to the soundtrack on repeat for days. Personally, I can't see myself watching it more than once or twice over a very, very extended period of time. It just doesn't have any scenes or moments which stand up to repeated viewings like other films.OVERALL:  3.5/5Sweeney Todd is the best musical I've seen since Little Shop of Horrors, but it's pure rental material. Tim Burton took a nice shot at making the perfect Musical for Guys, but the DVD comes up short in several areas. Kudos for the attempt and for still coming out with a very watchable movie, but it's not quite as entertaining or long lasting as I originally hoped, and the extras in the two-disc special edition are definitely not worth the extra money. If you enjoyed Sweeney Todd or must buy it on DVD for whatever reason, I'd suggest saving your money and just picking up the regular edition.",4,A surprise favorite,1249689600,"08 8,

It's dark and bleak and awash in blood with a terrific performance from Johnny Depp.The only problem is that the film is dark and bleak and awash in blood.  Unless you're into that kind of thing.Although I said this was the perfect Tim Burton film, it's not my favorite.  I still think his best was ED WOOD (Martin Landau won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his dead-on performance as Bela Lugosi).  SLEEPY HOLLOW was also very bloody but paper thin.  MARS ATTACKS traded blood for Martian ray guns but didn't hit the mark when it came to mixing humor and horror.  The two BATMAN movies he did proved that he can't film an action scene to save his life.  (I accidentally caught the ending of PLANET OF THE APES and it was such a head-scratching variation of the original shocker ending that I haven't felt any desire to see the rest).After watching a Tim Burton film, I usually think: ""Good...but that was 20 minutes too long.""And I didn't think that with SWEENEY TODD.  It's visually dazzling, the performances are fun (Sascha Baron Cohen was perfect), the music doesn't intrude on the story (I'm not a big fan of the musical).  Johnny Depp won a Golden Globe and he deserved it.But it is dark and bloody.  I don't remember how many heads rolled in SLEEPY HOLLOW (a lot, I'm sure) but it felt like a lot of throats were slit in SWEENEY TODD, spraying blood all over everything.As in a lot of Burton's work, you watch a scene that splashes gore everywhere and wonder, ""Is that funny?""  Considering what happens to Helena Bonham Carter's character, it's hard to find a good chuckle when her last scene is so convincingly portrayed.Still, a well-crafted, entertaining film.I haven't seen the original stage show but I understand that a final musical number is left out of the film version: the ghosts of Sweeney Todd and the Helena Bonham Carter charcter return to sing one final number before the curtain falls.",3,The Perfect Tim Burton Film,1213833600,"06 19, 2008",2008,1960,"['SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'perfect', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'dark', 'bleak', 'awash', 'blood', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Depp.The', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'dark', 'bleak', 'awash', 'blood', ""'re"", 'kind', 'thing.Although', 'said', 'was', 'perfect', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'not', 'favorite', 'still', 'think', 'best', 'was', 'ED', 'WOOD', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'dead-on', 'performance', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'SLEEPY', 'HOLLOW', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'bloody', 'paper', 'thin', 'MARS', 'ATTACKS', 'traded', 'blood', 'Martian', 'ray', 'guns', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'mark', 'when', 'came', 'mixing', 'humor', 'horror', 'two', 'BATMAN', 'movies', 'did', 'proved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'film', 'action', 'scene', 'save', 'life', 'accidentally', 'caught', 'ending', 'PLANET', 'THE', 'APES', 'was', 'such', 'head-scratching', 'variation', 'original', 'shocker', 'ending', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'desire', 'see', 'rest', '.After', 'watching', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'usually', 'think', 'Good', 'was', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'visually', 'dazzling', 'performances', 'are', 'fun', 'Sascha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'was', 'perfect', 'music', ""n't"", 'intrude', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'musical', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'deserved', 'it.But', 'dark', 'bloody', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'many', 'heads', 'rolled', 'SLEEPY', 'HOLLOW', 'lot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'felt', 'lot', 'throats', 'were', 'slit', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'spraying', 'blood', 'everything.As', 'lot', 'Burton', 'work', 'watch', 'scene', 'gore', 'everywhere', 'wonder', 'funny', 'Considering', 'what', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'character', 'hard', 'find', 'good', 'chuckle', 'when', 'last', 'scene', 'so', 'convincingly', 'portrayed.Still', 'well-crafted', 'entertaining', 'film.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'stage', 'show', 'understand', 'final', 'musical', 'number', 'left', 'film', 'version', 'ghosts', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'charcter', 'return', 'sing', 'one', 'final', 'number', 'curtain']",N/A
1133789,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B001209SMS,the masked reviewer,"[14, 16]","Tim Burton: Hollywood's undisputed champion of gothic horror.Sweeney Todd: a psycho barber and famous purveyor of dodgy pies.Hmmmm... what took you so long?It was screamingly obvious what a gorgeous team they would make. Rarely have we seen a film director so perfectly matched to a musical. And the black magic begins when Johnny Depp's white-faced Sweeney steals up the Thames at the dead of night. As the boat slips under a spooky London Bridge it becomes quite clear that Burton was put on earth to shoot this glorious melodrama.The film unfolds like the Grimmest of fairy tales. Depp's bitter Sweeney returns to London after 15 years of hurt. His painful story emerges in hollow songs with haunting off-key melodies. He wears his grievances like armour. His plan to murder the men who condemned him to a penal colony in order to rape his wife hinges around the dismal apartment above Mrs Lovett's ailing pie shop. The atmosphere is vintage Hammer Studios. The gleaming monochrome shots of cobbled streets are drained of color. Effectively overwrought and excellent, Sweeney Todd is a movie of bombastic, impossible camera moves and rhapsodic yuckiness. Burton can't resist filling the screen with scuttling vermin or surges of splatterific violence.Depp's Sweeney is a fiery-eyed, razor-brandishing cadaver with a mad Pagliacci glare. Bonham Carter is comparably corpse-like--a matched composition in bird-nest hairdo, death-pallor complexion, and heavily shadowed eyes. The musical chemistry between Depp and Helena Bonham Carter's genial cockney pie shop mistress is terrific. Sondheim approved the casting, and, surprisingly, Depp has a pleasing, if untrained, tenor. Alongside Bonham Carter's sweetly tentative voice, the numbers are inventively staged. Especially the cannibal waltz ""A Little Priest"" and the grotesquely wistful ""By the Sea"". Lovett's unreciprocated passion for Sweeney is the heart of the film and her bright idea of stuffing Sweeney's clients into meat pies seems almost perfectly sensible under the circumstances.The film's pace is a surprise. Burton has pruned Sondheim's arias to fit the tempo of a real thriller -- brilliant editing - and the villains are far less stocky. Yes, the ghoulishly attractive couple is supported by a suitable gang of gargoyles; Sacha Baron Cohen delivers a priceless cameo as a jealous unisex rival with plans to blackmail Sweeney. Alan Rickman is a sinister pleasure as Judge Turpin. And Timothy Spall is equally effective as his ultra-violent slithery enforcer, Beadle Bamford.Burton has never been one to spare the gore. The sound of skulls cracking open when Sweeney tosses his victims head first into the basement is not for the faint-of-heart. The director's knack of finding comedy in these ghastly scenes is tested to the limit. And the haunting final shot of the film, the details of which we must keep to ourselves so not to spoil the plot, is a masterful shot, painterly in its composition of framing, detail, and color.There is so much that can be said about Sweeney Todd, but we must insist that you stop reading and simply experience this wonderous film for yourself.

1133790,A26ZMEMGD5BCUQ,B001209SMS,the Matt from Oz,"[16, 22]","I really enjoyed this at the movies, and when I bought the English Blu-ray and watched it again, with 2 exceptions.First, the movie itself (SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!), if only the daughter had lifted the lid and seen Todd kill the mother the despair would have been even greater - not for her, but for Sweeney. If he knew his beloved had seen him commit the act the tragedy would have been even more intense. (END SPOILER) But that's probably a personal and subjective thing, and not why I didn't mark it higher.Secondly, the Blu-ray version of the movie. The reason I only gave this 2 stars is because if it's the same as the English Blu-ray, you may want to save your money, because the heinous digital noise reduction rears its ugly head again. DNR is used to smooth out film grain and artefacts and must be used incredibly judiciously. There seems to be a LOT of ignorance around here about film grain as opposed to video noise, and people complaining wrongheadedly about things looking 'clean' and 'HD'. Let me explain:Visuals are obviously very important to Burton and an integral part of his storytelling. While film stocks have been getting more refined over the last hundred years many directors use higher amounts of grain INTENTIONALLY as a tonal element to literally add 'grit', roughness and a patina of texture to the visuals. It is used to enhance the mood of the movie, and when used by a visually competent director is done with purpose to help sell the tone.The disgusting thing that happened here however is not as pervasive as the abominable PATTON, but even MORE wrongheaded. O.K., so DNR and edge 'enhancement' (ha!) are used to 'clean up' an image (only stuff shot digitally or cg animated films will be completely without grain) but when they get rid of that grain, they obviously obliterate fine detail - so much for 'high-def'! What happened on Todd, a film where obvious grain which is part of the actual structure of the film stock NOT added on top and therefore inextricable from the detail of the picture (without manually supervised frame-by frame instructions), was that they used the plasticising DNR on the faces of Depp and Carter - but ONLY under the eyes and around the nose and cheeks! Not only that but after obliterating the lines there, they didn't even bother to match the film gain in the rest of the plate back on top! So what you get is a horrible smeary plasticy mess. Which sort of defeats the whole purpose of the film in setting a grimy, lined and depressing world of despair and bloody revenge! They're SUPPOSED to be cracked and worn, literally and figuratively!Usually I'm annoyed at people who mark a movie down because it was ""too dark"" or some technical reason apart from the actual story and worth of the movie itself. Here however I think I'm justified as whatever marketing moron approved it - probably the same sort that still puts out pan-and-scan for ""Concerned Disney Christian Mothers' Group"" types that think for some reason the black bits are put ""over the top of the picture"" (one question - why would they?!) - obviously didn't realise that he or she wasn't SUPPOSED to make the stars look pretty and unlined. Did they not noticed the black bags under the eyes? The ghostly makeup? The reason that these actors took the roles in the first place??? It wasn't done to Alan Rickman!'Cleaning them up"" in such a half-finished way or at all subverts the point of the story and the characters! The promise of HD is that we get as perfect a simulation of the theatrical print as possible. NOT to make it look like a video sports event. It's like the fools working at big stores who turn on the 100/120hz scanning on the HDTVs because it's so high-tech and smooth - that's meant for video-based sporting events (and text)! There's a special mode on ALL these sets to display films in their originally projected 24 frames a second. But they do the 120hz thing because it's 'slick' and 'hd'. Same sort of wrongheadedness as this slathering of DNR on Sweeney Todd. It's all about the original intent.Lift your game, Dreamworks. I'm going to see about a refund on mine - or whether they'll put out a decent update like they did with Fifth Element.Sorry for the massive post everyone, but this is the stupidest thing I've seen in quite a while. If you're the type who doesn't notice fine detail stuff, DON'T bother with the HD version of this. It's an insult to Burton, Depp, Carter and all who made the film.",2,BEWARE - if the quality of the visuals matter to you on this HD release,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,4475,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'when', 'bought', 'English', 'Blu-ray', 'watched', 'again', '2', 'exceptions.First', 'movie', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'SEEN', 'IT', 'only', 'daughter', 'had', 'lifted', 'lid', 'seen', 'Todd', 'kill', 'mother', 'despair', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'greater', 'not', 'Sweeney', 'knew', 'beloved', 'had', 'seen', 'commit', 'act', 'tragedy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'intense', 'END', 'SPOILER', 'probably', 'personal', 'subjective', 'thing', 'not', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'mark', 'higher.Secondly', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'movie', 'reason', 'only', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'same', 'English', 'Blu-ray', 'may', 'want', 'save', 'money', 'heinous', 'digital', 'noise', 'reduction', 'ugly', 'head', 'again', 'DNR', 'used', 'smooth', 'out', 'film', 'grain', 'artefacts', 'must', 'be', 'used', 'incredibly', 'judiciously', 'be', 'LOT', 'ignorance', 'here', 'film', 'grain', 'opposed', 'video', 'noise', 'people', 'complaining', 'wrongheadedly', 'things', 'looking', ""'clean"", ""'HD"", 'Let', 'explain', 'Visuals', 'are', 'obviously', 'very', 'important', 'Burton', 'integral', 'part', 'storytelling', 'film', 'stocks', 'have', 'been', 'getting', 'more', 'refined', 'last', 'hundred', 'years', 'many', 'directors', 'use', 'higher', 'amounts', 'grain', 'INTENTIONALLY', 'tonal', 'element', 'literally', 'add', ""'grit"", 'roughness', 'patina', 'texture', 'visuals', 'used', 'enhance', 'mood', 'movie', 'when', 'used', 'visually', 'competent', 'director', 'done', 'purpose', 'help', 'sell', 'tone.The', 'disgusting', 'thing', 'happened', 'here', 'however', 'not', 'as', 'pervasive', 'abominable', 'PATTON', 'even', 'MORE', 'wrongheaded', 'O.K.', 'so', 'DNR', 'edge', ""'enhancement"", 'ha', 'are', 'used', ""'clean"", 'up', 'image', 'only', 'shot', 'digitally', 'cg', 'animated', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'grain', 'when', 'get', 'rid', 'grain', 'obviously', 'obliterate', 'fine', 'detail', 'so', 'much', ""'high-def"", 'What', 'happened', 'Todd', 'film', 'where', 'obvious', 'grain', 'part', 'actual', 'structure', 'film', 'stock', 'NOT', 'added', 'top', 'therefore', 'inextricable', 'detail', 'picture', 'manually', 'supervised', 'frame-by', 'frame', 'instructions', 'was', 'used', 'plasticising', 'DNR', 'Depp', 'Carter', 'ONLY', 'eyes', 'nose', 'cheeks', 'Not', 'only', 'obliterating', 'lines', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'match', 'film', 'gain', 'rest', 'plate', 'back', 'top', 'So', 'what', 'get', 'horrible', 'smeary', 'plasticy', 'mess', 'Which', 'sort', 'defeats', 'whole', 'purpose', 'film', 'setting', 'grimy', 'lined', 'depressing', 'world', 'despair', 'bloody', 'revenge', ""'re"", 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'cracked', 'worn', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Usually', ""'m"", 'annoyed', 'people', 'who', 'mark', 'movie', 'down', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'technical', 'reason', 'apart', 'actual', 'story', 'worth', 'movie', 'Here', 'however', 'think', ""'m"", 'justified', 'marketing', 'moron', 'approved', 'probably', 'same', 'sort', 'still', 'out', 'pan-and-scan', 'Concerned', 'Disney', 'Christian', 'Mothers', 'Group', 'think', 'reason', 'black', 'bits', 'are', 'put', 'top', 'picture', 'one', 'question', 'why', 'would', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'was', ""n't"", 'SUPPOSED', 'make', 'stars', 'look', 'pretty', 'unlined', 'Did', 'not', 'noticed', 'black', 'bags', 'eyes', 'ghostly', 'makeup', 'reason', 'actors', 'took', 'roles', 'first', 'place', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'Alan', 'Rickman', ""'Cleaning"", 'up', 'such', 'half-finished', 'way', 'point', 'story', 'characters', 'promise', 'HD', 'get', 'perfect', 'simulation', 'theatrical', 'print', 'possible', 'NOT', 'make', 'look', 'video', 'sports', 'event', 'fools', 'working', 'big', 'stores', 'who', 'turn', '100/120hz', 'scanning', 'HDTVs', 'so', 'high-tech', 'smooth', 'meant', 'video-based', 'sporting', 'events', 'text', 'special', 'mode', 'ALL', 'sets', 'display', 'films', 'originally', 'projected', '24', 'frames', 'second', 'do', '120hz', 'thing', 'Same', 'sort', 'wrongheadedness', 'slathering', 'DNR', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'original', 'intent.Lift', 'game', 'Dreamworks', ""'m"", 'going', 'see', 'refund', 'mine', ""'ll"", 'put', 'out', 'decent', 'update', 'did', 'Fifth', 'Element.Sorry', 'massive', 'post', 'everyone', 'stupidest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', ""'re"", 'type', 'who', ""n't"", 'notice', 'fine', 'detail', 'stuff', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'bother', 'HD', 'version', 'insult', 'Burton', 'Depp', 'Carter', 'who', 'made', 'film']",N/A
1133791,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001209SMS,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[5, 5]","One wonders how Stephen Sondheim ever thought of a notorious 19th-century serial killer's exploits as suitable subject matter for a Broadway musical.  Yet ""Sweeney Todd"" opened in 1979 to excellent critical reaction.It's taken this long for the play to come to the screen.  There were several attempts that never came to fruition, changing public tastes to contend with, and Sondheim's trademark protectiveness of his work.  Now, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" makes the transition from stage to screen surprisingly well, despite heavy pruning of its musical numbers.The setting is Victorian London.  Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), lives a contented life as a barber with his wife Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly) and infant daughter Johanna until Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), lusting for Lucy, has Barker deported to Australia on false charges and rapes Lucy, who poisons herself in despair.  Johanna becomes Judge Turpin's ward.Many years later Barker, now calling himself Sweeney Todd, returns to London and visits an old friend, the pie maker Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), whose upper floor used to serve as his barber shop.  He decides to reopen for business, aiming to exact vengeance on Judge Turpin.Depp is playing a man older than his real age, and convinces with both make-up and a consistently grim expression.  He is not the greatest singer on the planet, but he sells the songs, using his acting skills and relying on the camera's ability to practically see into his soul.  We feel for him because of how mightily he's been wronged, and this balances the on-screen violence.  Though most of his victims are innocent men who simply want a shave, we find ourselves oddly intrigued by his proficiency with the blade and, especially, with how efficiently he disposes of body after body.  Not since Norman Bates has the screen seen such a fascinating serial killer.Director Tim Burton, who directed Depp in ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" gives ""Sweeney Todd"" such a feel for the squalid underbelly of London that you can almost smell it.  From the first scene, when we see Sweeney sail up the Thames under Tower Bridge to the crowded, narrow, cobbled streets that pedestrians have to share with rats, the film's atmosphere envelops the bloody tale being unfolded.  The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski uses a very muted color palette, saving bright hues for dramatic effect, such as when Sweeney wields his razor and blood spurts from the necks of his victims.  Yes, these scenes leave little to the imagination, but the bloodletting is extremely stylized.  On stage, there was some stage blood, but on screen, with close-ups, the gore is magnified.Ms. Carter serves up an interesting portrayal of Mrs. Lovett, who becomes Sweeney's accomplice in crime.  Her skill -- or lack of it -- at baking meat pies, her attraction to Sweeney, and her entrepreneurship make her a fascinating character.  On stage, Angela Lansbury played her broadly and comically as an eccentric floozy.  Carter's interpretation is less music hall, more Grand Guignol, a choice that is wise and fits better into Burton's vision.Comic relief is provided by Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, a pompous barber who is challenged to a duel of barbers by Sweeney.  Cohen is flamboyantly appropriate, neatly stealing his big scene.  Dressed in a royal blue outfit that looks more suitable for the French court than a dingy London lower-class neighborhood, he carries himself like an aristocrat though, at heart, he is just one more snake oil salesman.Excellent supporting performances are provided by Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford, a cohort of Judge Turpin; Anthony Hope as the sailor who befriends Sweeney on the journey to England and becomes smitten with Johanna when he sees her gazing out her window; Rickman as Judge Turpin; and young Ed Sanders as Toby.Spall looks like a character directly out of Charles Dickens and is absolutely believable as a toady whose powerful office allows him to bend the law or wield it at his discretion.Sanders has quite a large role as Toby, the abused assistant of Pirelli who later is taken under the wing of Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett.  He has a great ragamuffin look, and a bright smile that belies the awful treatment Toby's endured first in the workhouses and then under Pirelli's cruel apprenticeship.  He is treated kindly at Sweeney's for the first time in his life.  His rendition of Sondheim's beautiful ballad ""Not While I'm Around"" is extremely moving.Other songs that made it into the film include  ""Johanna,"" ""Pretty Women,"" and the darkly comic ""The Worst Pies in London,"" performed by Mrs. Lovett as cockroaches scramble willy nilly across her kitchen counter.Rated R for its graphic violence, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" succeeds because its strong story forms the substance of the movie, performances are uniformly first-rate and the production design is evocative.",5,"Crazed Barber Spills Blood,

It is hard to sit and watch a story and have the characters spontaneously burst out into song. I enjoy them; good musicals serve to transport me and I suspend belief and go with the flow, accepting and expecting the characters to begin bursting into song at any minute. We have been fortunate to have a revival, of sorts, of the genre in the past decade or so. Disney Animation has kept up the tradition, but as far as live action musicals, the genre died for a number of years. With the release of ""Moulin Rouge"" (love it or hate it, there is no in-between), the genre was reborn. ""Moulin Rouge"" led to ""Chicago"", leading to ""Dreamgirls"", which led to ""Hairspray"".Many may not be aware there are actually two kinds of musicals created for Broadway and film. Traditional musicals tell stories and the characters sing songs to express their emotions and to move the story forward. There are also `operatic' musicals. These feature the characters singing throughout most, if not all, of the story. Stephen Sondheim's ""Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is an example of an operatic musical.Even with the rebirth of the genre, musicals are a difficult sell. ""Hairspray"" did well because it featured a bunch of young stars kids and tweens are familiar with. ""Chicago"" did well because it received a lot of awards and positive press. But they are difficult sells which is why they probably always feature funny, romantic or upbeat storylines. So, I was surprised to learn ""Sweeney Todd"" was going to be made into a film. It isn't particularly romantic, although much of the story has to do with one man's love for his wife. It isn't particularly funny, although there are some moments of black humor. And it certainly isn't upbeat.Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp, director Burton's muse) returns to London from prison. We learn Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) sent Todd away on a false charge because he coveted Todd's wife. While he is in prison, Todd's wife dies and Turpin takes in his daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) as his ward. When Todd returns, he meets Ms. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) his former landlord and sets up shop above her meat-pie emporium, where she proudly sells the worst meat-pies in London. Todd intends to use his former profession, barber, to extract his revenge on Turpin, Beadle (Timothy Spall), his accomplice and any one else who gets in his way, including an Italian barber (Sacha Baron Cohen) who may steal some of Todd's business. But as Todd's body count rises, he and Ms. Lovett have a problem. What do they do with all of the bodies? Ms. Lovett comes up with a plan and her meat-pie shop becomes more popular than ever.Directed by Tim Burton, ""Sweeney Todd"" seems to have found the perfect director for the subject material. Really, the only other director I can think of who might have been a better choice is Peter Greenaway. Both directors treat the screen as a canvas and create beautiful imagery out of strange and sometimes dark material. Burton brings London, in the mid 1800s, to life, complete with black smoke, dirt and grime. It is hard to imagine people living in this London, Burton's recreation, but that is sort of the point. Unless they were rich and well-off, like Judge Turpin, people struggled to survive. As the film begins, and Todd sings of London being a cesspool of despair, Burton makes us believe in this image of the world capital. This may be the first time I have seen London depicted in such a dirty, grimy state. Other stories have shown this side of London, but those films are usually filled with night scenes. Burton places much of the action in ""Todd"" during the day. There seems to be perpetual fogs (both literally and figuratively) hanging over the city, making everyone appear a little more sallow and unhealthy.As soon as Todd returns to Ms. Lovett's shop, she offers him one of ""The Worst Pies in London"" offering us more of a glimpse into her life and the life of people living in this city. This moment also helps to establish their relationship. Lovett appears to not recognize her former tenant, he does look quite different, but when he reveals who he is, she states ""I thought that might have been you."" It is Lovett who reveals what happened to his wife and daughter, and this sets Todd on his murderous rampage. But Lovett is also a little attracted to Todd, even in his murderous state. Apparently, there are worse catches in London, the London of mid 1800s anyway. Maybe this is still true today.Johnny Depp is always a strong actor. He may not appear in the best movies (see the third installment of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" for an example) but he is always at least interesting. In ""Todd"", he further explores a character he has been building with Burton over the course of their careers. Sweeney shares similarities with Willy Wonka, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and all of the other characters Depp has played in Burton films. Burton really found his muse when he started to work with Depp and any actor would relish the opportunity to play such strange characters. It is really a match made in heaven for the two men.In ""Todd"", Depp also proves he can sing. He isn't a formally trained singer, but he does a remarkably good job with what must be a difficult role. If you look at ""Todd"" a little closer, Depp, an American, has played many Brits throughout his career, but to sing with a convincing British accent? That is the challenge and Depp pulls it off very well. I have a feeling this is the aspect of the role that attracted Depp to the film in the first place. He has played very strange men before but never one who sings. And to sing an operatic score? That is an even greater challenge for an actor.As Todd, Depp shows us the rage simmering beneath the surface. It is really amazing to see this anger boiling, threatening to pour out at any moment. But Todd knows he has to keep it in check. He has a plan and if he lets the anger overtake him, his plan is ruined and he will never be able to avenge his wife's death or rescue his daughter. Turpin is his goal; everything else is just a stepping stone to vengeance.He also seems to regard Ms. Lovett as a necessity. He clearly recognizes she is more interested in him, perhaps in a romantic way. While he doesn't seem to share the level of ardor, he recognizes he needs her to keep his plan moving forward, so he plays along, stringing her along until he reaches his goal.Helena Bonham Carter, Burton's wife, is not a classically trained singer either and she does a very good job. Ms. Lovett is not quite as desperate as Todd, at least on the surface, but she certainly has things she desperately wants to have happen. She sees in Todd perhaps her last chance at happiness, strange as that may seem given the barber's psychotic tendencies.Has Alan Rickman ever turned in a bad performance? Like Depp, he has appeared in mediocre films, but anytime he appears on screen, he brings the project, good or bad, to life. Because he has played many villains, it was nice to see him play Emma Thompson's husband in ""Love, Actually"", a character similar to the role he played in his first big film, ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"". But villains is what he is best known for so, in ""Todd"", Rickman plays Judge Turpin, the man who changed Todd's life forever. Turpin's reason? He coveted Todd's beautiful wife and had Todd locked up, taking his daughter in as his ward. The beautiful wife? She couldn't stand the thought of living in Turpin's hands, so she committed suicide. When Todd returns, he sets his eyes on Turpin and would love nothing more than to get him in his barber's chair and give him a very close shave.During the intervening years, Todd's daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) has grown into a beautiful young lady. Naturally, Turpin can not hide his feelings and tries to keep her hidden from the eyes of handsome young men. When this proves too difficult, he decides he will marry her. This man is truly despicable and Rickman manages to portray his desperation in a convincing, fascinating way.Timothy Spall plays Turpin's oily henchman, flouncing around, always at Turpin's side. When he is on his own, he knows his position carries a certain amount of power and prestige, which he isn't afraid to show.Sacha Baron Cohen plays Signor Aldolfo Pirelli, the Italian barber who may provide some difficulty to Todd, stealing some of his business and hindering him from reaching his goals. The moment Cohen appears on screen, everyone recognizes him and the accent he uses is so ridiculous, it is hard to separate the actor from the role and it proves more of a distraction than anything else. It smacks of stunt casting and brings the film down a bit.There has been a lot of comment about the amount of blood in ""Todd"". Necks are slashed and a lot of blood flows, but the blood becomes cartoony and comical very quickly. It is ketchup red and flows so freely you can't help but laugh. Also, what else would you expect to see in a film about a barber who uses a straight razor to cut people's necks? In the middle of the film, as Todd works towards his goal, so many people fall victim to his razor during one musical number it is difficult to feel queasy.""Sweeney Todd"" is a very good film. Definitely not for everyone, it is an acquired taste many will appreciate.",4,Depp and Burton Slice Right to the Thick of Things,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,9386,"['know', 'lot', 'people', 'have',

And nobody does tortured dementia quite like Johnny Depp. Put them together in Stephen Sondheim's blood opera and you get the viscous splatter that is ""Sweeney Todd."" While - as many have pointed out - the film deviates from the play on several points, the main thrust of the story remains intact. Depp/Sweeney is out for revenge against the coniving Judge Turpin (a leeringly great Alan Rickman), when he falls in with Mrs Lovett (Helena Bohnam Carter) and the plan to make mincemeat outta the unsavory populous is born.Depp proves his mettle as a musical actor, while his voice has a light tenor to it, he infuses the songs with a dark growl of malevolence. Looking likeEdward Scissorhandswith better hair (or kind of like his character inSleepy Hollow), he also perfectly embodies the Gothic heart that Burton excells in. Only once does this movie even come close to a bright disposition, and that is the satirical ""By The Sea,"" sung by Carter.This is also far from what one would call a ""holiday musical."" Unless you would call it a Halloween film. If you're looking forOklahoma!orOliver!, you're in the wrong place. Ditto for everyone carping that Angela Lansbury was so much better...blah blah blah. Reality Check: that was 25 years ago. You really want that version, buy it here:Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street.

Judge Turpin is enticed by Lucy and falsely imprisons Barker to allow him to fully persue her. Benjamin returns after fifteen years only to find that his entire life is gone. His wife is dead and his daughter is in the clutches of the very man who imprisoned him. Revenge is the only thing on his mind after Mrs. Lovett, the owner of the place he used to live, filled him in on all the details of the events that transpired after he was gone. He assumes an new identity as Sweeney Todd and opens up a barber shop to lie in wait for the judge. In the meantime, before the Judge shows up, he practices on unsuspecting customers while Mrs. Lovett makes the most delicious meat pies with a very special ingredient...The first experience I ever had with Sweeney Todd was watching the version with Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett and George Hern as Sweeney Todd. I was incredibly bored and shocked at how such a disturbing, interesting story could be turned into such a bore. As disappointing as this one was, I was looking forward to Tim Burton's new endeavor because he's one of my favorite directors of all time. I'm so happy that he gave the musical new life on the screen with his collaboration with the great Stephen Sondheim.The music is wonderful throughout the film. I've heard a lot of people say there aren't any memorable songs, but I think this is more due to the fact that it sounds much more modern, syncopated, and dissonant than the typical Broadway musical. The songs have a great range from the dark and stormy Epiphany to the delightfully comical A Little Priest to the beautiful, melancholy Green Finch and Linnet Bird. My favorite song is My Friends because of the wonderful interweaving of Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett's voices. It's deceptively quiet and understated, but really reveals the truth in their relationship: Todd is completely consumed by his need for revenge and Mrs. Lovett, although forgotten by Todd, simply wants to be loved by him. I was relieved that Sondheim didn't choose to have operatic voices featured in the film because I think that's part of why I didn't like the previous rendition. I both love Johnny Depp's rough, rock influenced rendition and Helena Bonham Carter's wispy, fragile voice. They are by no means professional singers, but they embody their characters so well that their voices just fit. I really couldn't see anyone else as these characters. The two best singers in the film are easily young Ed Sanders as Toby and Jayne Wisener as Johanna. These two young people blew me away with their singing voices and I hope to see more from them.The visuals of the film are striking, portraying the gritty and dark underbelly of London. The color scheme is mostly in black and white with the only real color being the blood that spills in copious amounts across the screen. The only really vibrant, saturated colors come from the songBy the Sea, which shows Mrs. Lovett's dream of a life with Todd and Toby as her family. The absence of color in the real world shows that there is really no hope for anyone in this story. The makeup used on the main characters is reminiscent of silent films and classic horror movies. It both sets them apart from the other characters and enhances the dark ambiance that encompasses the film. One of the things I most enjoy about the film is the cinematography during songs. This is no boring musical with one angle for an entire song. The visuals are just as striking as the music with the changes in camera angle, playing with reflective and transparent surfaces, and the use of wide shots as well as close-ups. This made the film dynamic and as interesting to watch as it is to listen to.The two most compelling characters in the film are both women: Mrs. Lovett and Johanna. Mrs. Lovett is much more than a conniving woman that wants to use Todd to her own ends. Although it would be easy to simply portray her as an evil villain that cooks people into meat pies, she's really so much more than that. Everything that she does in the film is really fueled by love. She loves Sweeney Todd so much that she is willing to help him kill people so that he will be with her. Her efforts throughout the film are to protect and manipulate Todd to stay with her as long as possible. Her nurturing side is definitely featured in the film, shown through her taking Toby under her wing and treating him like a son. She also expresses sympathy for Johanna who never really had a mother or a loving family to take care of her. This different side of her really endeared her to me and made hopeful that she would get the family she wanted even though she wasn't a completely good person.Johanna is an interesting character. Because she has been isolated and ogled by Judge Turpin her whole life, one would assume that she would be naive and probably warped in some way. This isn't true at all. She is melancholy obviously because her guardian is abusive, but she sees the world in a practical way. Anthony has seen locations all over the world as a sailor, but he remains convinced that they will run away and live happily ever after together. Johanna knows that all their problems won't be solved and reveals herself to be more realistic than him. Her strength and resilience are truly impressive. It was easy to portray her as a wilting flower of a girl who was weak and bland. Jayne Wisener takes a small role and makes it truly memorable with her quiet confidence and beautiful singing voice.Sweeney Todd is one of the best musicals made in recent years. I love how Tim Burton combined silent movie horror with the more bloody, gory horror of the present. I am still impressed with all of the acting, no matter how small the role. It is a film I will be watching again and again for many years to come.",5,A modern classic,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,5878,"['Benjamin', 'Barker', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Lucy', 'have', 'daughter',

The actors actually sang instead of lipsinking, which was a nice touch.  Depp's voice surprisingly was quite good.  The dynamic sound of the organ during the beginning titles and introduction was chilling.The Blu-Ray transfer was very clear and detailed,and since the movie was purposely dark, the bits of color throughout stood out vividly.

Benjamin escapes and returns to London in the opening of the film only to find that his wife is dead and his daughter in the custody of the Judge who sent him to prison. Wanting nothing but revenge he joins forces with a woman he knew in the past, Mrs. Lovett (played by Helena Bonham Carter) who helps him open a barber shop above her meat pie shop. His plan for revenge soon spirals out of control as he starts killing his customers and then sends them below to be used in Mrs. Lovett's pies.Johnny Depp does an excellent job singing, but Helena Bonham Carter does the best job in the film. Her voice is stunning and she has the widest range or emotions to go through in the film; all the while creating a morosely charming character. The supporting cast also does very well singing and acting including Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Jamie Campbell.As all Tim Burton films, this is a visual delight. He uses that same fake-looking blood from Sleepy Hollow which helps tone down the stories graphic content. He also plays with the coloring and lighting, covering everything in bleak, dreary grays and ashes to set a tone of the overwhelming despair.This is a magnificent film, and my only complaint or more the reason why I did not give it a higher rating is because it is a musical.

He's told that his wife died and his daughter has been placed under the guardianship of the man who set him up and sent him away, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman).  Todd swears revenge. He makes the acquaintance of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who makes ""the worst pies in London"" and who has taken up residence in the building that Todd's family once lived and worked.  He sets out seeking his revenge on the judge, but along the way is distracted by a showman barber, Signor Adolfo Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen).  Todd challenges Pirelli to a barber's duel and after he loses, Pirelli threatens to reveal Todd's true identity.  With the assistance of Mrs. Lovett, the final exchange between Pirelli and Todd sets Todd on a bloody course of destruction that ultimately leads to a tragic end.SWEENEY TODD isn't your usual musical.  Blood freely gushing as Mr. Todd takes his revenge upon his various victims.  Mrs. Lovett's place becomes a booming business and her pies become the tastiest in town after she begins butchering Sweeney's victims and using them as meat.  There are some who will be taken back by the violence and there are others who may find that such a brutal subject is not worthy of a musical.Before watching the film, I wasn't sure if I was going to like SWEENEY TODD or not. I really enjoy Tim Burton's films and even though I knew the basic plot of the story, I was unfamiliar with Sondheim's music and didn't know how well it would stand up on screen.  Despite the subject matter, I thought SWEENEY TODD was an excellent musical.  I didn't mind the violence and enjoyed the dark humor scattered throughout.  Johnny Depp is wonderful as ever as Sweeney Todd; he's an extremely talented actor, but this is the first film I've seen where he sings and he sings well.  I also enjoyed the performances of Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford.  The costumes and settings are superb and provide a general mood full of gloom and doom, only sporadically broken with brilliant colors of life either from dripping blood or by the love story between Todd's daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and Todd's young friend Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower).Overall, SWEENEY TODD is a tragic musical that fans of the genre will probably enjoy watching and if you're squeamish just close your eyes when you see those silver blades unleashed.",5,"On Fleet Street, a Shave and a Haircut Can Cost Much More Than Two Bits",1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,2578,"['serving', 'time', 'abroad', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'barber', 'Benjamin', 'Barker', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'London', 'new', 'name', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'wife', 'child', 'told', 'wife', 'died', 'daughter', 'been', 'placed', 'guardianship', 'man', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'sent', 'away', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Todd', 'revenge', 'acquaintance', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'woman', 'who', 'worst', 'pies', 'London', 'who', 'taken', 'up', 'residence', 'building', 'Todd', 'family', 'once', 'lived', 'worked', 'out', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'judge', 'way', 'distracted', 'showman', 'barber', 'Signor', 'Adolfo', 'Pirelli', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Todd', 'Pirelli', 'barber', 'duel', 'Pirelli', 'reveal', 'Todd', 'true', 'identity', 'assistance', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'final', 'exchange', 'Pirelli', 'Todd', 'sets', 'Todd', 'bloody', 'course', 'destruction', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'end.SWEENEY', 'TODD', ""n't"", 'usual', 'musical', 'Blood', 'freely', 'gushing', 'Mr.', 'Todd', 'revenge', 'various', 'victims', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'place', 'booming', 'business', 'pies', 'become', 'tastiest', 'town', 'butchering', 'Sweeney', 'victims', 'using', 'meat', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'violence', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'find', 'brutal', 'subject', 'not', 'worthy', 'musical.Before', 'watching', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'not', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'even', 'knew', 'basic', 'plot', 'story', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'Sondheim', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'stand', 'up', 'screen', 'subject', 'matter', 'thought', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'was', 'excellent', 'musical', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'violence', 'enjoyed', 'dark', 'humor', 'scattered', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'wonderful', 'as', 'ever', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actor', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'where', 'well', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Judge', 'Turpin', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Beadle', 'Bamford', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'superb', 'provide', 'general', 'mood', 'full', 'gloom', 'doom', 'only', 'sporadically', 'broken', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'life', 'dripping', 'blood', 'love', 'story', 'Todd', 'daughter', 'Johanna', 'Jayne', 'Wisener', 'Todd', 'young', 'friend', 'Anthony', 'Hope', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', '.Overall', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'tragic', 'musical', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching', ""'re"", 'squeamish', 'just', 'close', 'eyes', 'when', 'see', 'silver', 'blades', 'unleashed']",N/A

I don't personally have a problem with musicals; some work, some don't. Sweeney Todd actually isn't that great of a musical. Some numbers were pretty catchy and fun, but others just flew past my head without a second thought. However, because the actors really put their heart and soul into this, and you can tell they did, the movie actually comes off as pretty great. For what it is, it works. All the actors do an extremely fine job with their roles and it all comes off very realistic. Alan Rickman, a perfection of a man, does a great, yet subtle job here as the sort of evil Judge. His scenes with Depp are thrilling and suspenseful. The only minor gripe I have is with Helena Bonham Carter. She is an excellent actress, and this is no exception, but she does an only mediocre job as a vocalist. She is the weakest link in the film. But it is not a big offender to truly turn you away.The set pieces, the costumes, they are all exquisite and fit the mood of this gloomy movie perfectly. It is actually quite a bloody and violent film, so even though its categorized as a musical, I would not let young children watch this. It's pretty gruesome at times. But that is also the great thing about this film. Its almost nonchalant about the whole murder issue. It almost feels as if you shouldn't take it seriously. Its sort of fun actually. If you love Tim Burton, this is a perfect film for you, musical lover or not.

1133808,A85AS1GBB54GP,B001209SMS,"Vincent J. Mulvihill ""vjm""","[0, 5]","Tim Burton is right on his game for this adaptation of this musical; in fact, if you've seen 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman' or 'Sleepy Hollow', you've probably seen ""Sweeney Todd.""  The dark palette Burton uses elsewhere is back and bleaker than ever (so the blood stands out, natch), with some choice CGI thrown in for good measure.  The visual effects are so overwhelming, in fact, that they almost represent another character in the film, and while occasionally this raises a film into the classic realm (see 'Schindler's List', 'Brazil' or 'Amadeus' for key examples), in this case, the dreary lack of color here actually mutes many of the performances.  Certainly the biggest character revelation in the final act of the film is tainted by Burton broad-stroking gloom and doom over every frame.Sondheim is a clever composer, but 'Todd' runs high on shock and low on substance, paling before 'Into the Woods', 'Sunday in the Park With George' (which did wordplay far superior) and even large sections of 'Dick Tracy.'  Unfortunately, Helena is solid and fun, but no great shakes and Johnny seems content to sing with a nasally David Bowie (think 1960s Bowie) tone.All of these factors conspire to make 'Todd' a good musical, when it could have been a great musical.",3,Black and White And Red All Over,1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,1270,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'right', 'game', 'adaptation', 'musical', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'Edward"", 'Scissorhands', ""'Batman"", ""'Sleepy"", 'Hollow', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'dark', 'palette', 'Burton', 'elsewhere', 'back', 'bleaker', 'ever', 'blood', 'out', 'natch', 'choice', 'CGI', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'fact', 'almost', 'represent', 'character', 'film', 'occasionally', 'film', 'classic', 'realm', 'see', 'List', ""'Brazil"", 'key', 'examples', 'case', 'dreary', 'lack', 'color', 'here', 'actually', 'many', 'performances', 'Certainly', 'biggest', 'character', 'revelation', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'tainted', 'Burton', 'broad-stroking', 'gloom', 'doom', 'frame.Sondheim', 'clever', 'composer', ""'Todd"", 'runs', 'high', 'shock', 'low', 'substance', 'paling', 'Woods', 'Park', 'George', 'did', 'wordplay', 'far', 'superior', 'even', 'large', 'sections', ""'Dick"", 'Tracy', 'Unfortunately', 'Helena', 'solid', 'fun', 'great', 'shakes', 'Johnny', 'content', 'sing', 'nasally', 'David', 'Bowie', 'think', '1960s', 'Bowie', 'tone.All', 'factors', 'conspire', 'make', ""'Todd"", 'good', 'musical', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'musical']",N/A

Johnny Depp shows some vocal skill here, as do Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, and others.  Not beautiful or really professional singing voices, but they have a great deal of character and emotion and that's what counts in this case.Burton and the cinematographer do a bloody good job of showing the red fluid as the only real color in the film except for Lovett's fantasy scene; the rest of London is dark, dirty, dank and foul; the sun never really comes out.  Obviously this is also meant to be metaphorical.Be aware that this is not a good choice for preteen girls no matter how Depp-crazed they may be.

1133810,A5A2QE6NECFR5,B001209SMS,William E. Adams,"[0, 0]","I've been a fan of this show since my barber in Hilo, Hawaii in 1980 played some of the score for me. His son was in the cast in the national touring production. I never got to see it on stage, but I owned the Broadway Cast double-LP, and I have the DVD of the stage production originally broadcast on PBS many years ago. The film version did not play my small town in rural New Mexico, so I had to wait for the disc release. I like it a lot, and the rather ordinary singing voices of Depp, Bonham-Carter, Rickman, et al didn't bother me. The condensing of the sweeping operatic score was a necesssity for the film, and since Stephen Sondheim himself was on hand to approve the film venture, the cuts are sensible. I might wish that ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" had been sung by the cast over the ending credits, but that's not a fatal omission. Depp and Bonham-Carter and everyone else act the parts with excellence. It is fun to see Rickman and Swall play bad guys outside of their ""Harry Potter"" roles, and the boy who plays Toby is the best singer of the bunch. Now for my small criticisms: the movie is just about relentlessly dark, and surely the sun shines in London every once in awhile; the singers sometimes mumble the lyrics, or lose a word due to the British accents, a flaw the stage DVD also has in abundance. The blood...ah, the blood, at the end, is heavy indeed. This truly is a horror film with music. On film, the blood can be so much more vivid and realistic than on stage that a bit less of it might have been enough. I loved the opening credit sequence, however...it seemed to have set the mood perfectly for what follows. Burton and his cast and crew can be proud of this one, but it surely isn't proper for kids under ten or squeamish viewers of either sex. I have always liked Johnny Depp, and here he proves he is up to one of his biggest challenges.
