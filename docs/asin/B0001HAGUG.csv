805611,AEFCBV52LF36H,B0001HAGUG,Garry L. Morey,"[2, 2]","I'm not a big fan of the movie 50-Packs.  Most are throw-away losers and not worth the price no matter how cheap.  But this 100-Pack of old cartoons is a pretty good deal.  The modern cartoons in production today are so pathetically abysmal that I won't let my grandkids watch them.  In their effort to be politically correct and multicultural they've managed to take out all the humor.  I show the kids these old gems and they love them.  Kids are smart enough to know that no one is really getting hurt and it's all for fun.As with all these multi-packs, be ready for some sub-standard audio/video quality.  These are not digitally remastered.  But for the price they are enjoyable and your kids can see cartoons that are actually funny.  Beware that the ""Tom & Jerry"" listed on the pack is not the cat and mouse series that everyone is familiar with.  This Tom & Jerry series is from the 1930s and is about two men.  There is still a lot of good stuff here for the price.(I would also recommend the Looney Tunes Classics that are available at Amazon.  These are many of the Warner Brothers cartoons that have been remastered with great results.)",4,Some Real Gems Here,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,1148,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'movie', '50-Packs', 'Most', 'are', 'throw-away', 'losers', 'not', 'price', 'matter', 'how', 'cheap', '100-Pack', 'old', 'cartoons', 'pretty', 'good', 'deal', 'modern', 'cartoons', 'production', 'today', 'are', 'so', 'pathetically', 'abysmal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'grandkids', 'watch', 'effort', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'multicultural', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'take', 'out', 'humor', 'show', 'kids', 'old', 'gems', 'love', 'Kids', 'are', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'one', 'really', 'getting', 'hurt', 'fun.As', 'multi-packs', 'be', 'ready', 'sub-standard', 'audio/video', 'quality', 'are', 'not', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'price', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'kids', 'can', 'see', 'cartoons', 'are', 'actually', 'funny', 'Beware', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'listed', 'pack', 'not', 'cat', 'mouse', 'series', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'series', '1930s', 'about', 'two', 'men', 'still', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', 'price', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'Classics', 'are', 'available', 'Amazon', 'are', 'many', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'cartoons', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'great', 'results']",100 Cartoon Classics

805613,A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ,B0001HAGUG,"Kimba W. Lion ""kimbawlion.com""","[35, 37]","I am loving the DVD scene. Production costs have obvisously gone low enough that Public Domain releases are coming into their own. And that's what this is: a collection of old cartoons that are in the Public Domain. Which means pretty much stuff you haven't seen before.This is not a set for children. Society has changed so much that we are just Not Allowed to think some of the thoughts that went into the jokes in these cartoons. Which means there is a subversive quality to this collection, which means it needs to exist.Some of these cartoons are simply bad. Some are very interesting. There are 4 Hoffnung Symphony Orchestra cartoons from the Halasz-Batchelor studio in England, designed for a very specialized audience but which I'm glad to have seen.I'm amused that someone said that the Tom and Jerry cartoons are the only ""real"" cartoons in this box, since these Tom and Jerrys have nothing at all to do with the cat and mouse. They are amusing, though.The fun in this set is discovering something that I've never seen before (which means it will be a while before I get around to the Popeyes and other ""famous"" cartoons). Like I said, some of these are simply bad, but a lot are simply amazing in a ""what kind of drugs were they on in the 1930s"" way. There's no way I would watch more than one disc at a sitting, and there's no way I would inflict these on a child. But I'm having fun with this set.Being a Public Domain release, basically it's put together from whatever old films they could find. Don't expect digital restoration. But the transfers are for the most part clean and clear, lightyears ahead of what we were getting on PD VHS tapes.",5,This set gets 5 stars just for existing.,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,1658,"['am', 'loving', 'DVD', 'scene', 'Production', 'costs', 'have', 'obvisously', 'gone', 'low', 'enough', 'Public', 'Domain', 'releases', 'are', 'coming', 'own', 'what', 'collection', 'old', 'cartoons', 'are', 'Public', 'Domain', 'Which', 'pretty', 'much', 'stuff', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before.This', 'not', 'set', 'children', 'Society', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'just', 'Not', 'Allowed', 'think', 'thoughts', 'went', 'jokes', 'cartoons', 'Which', 'subversive', 'quality', 'collection', 'exist.Some', 'cartoons', 'are', 'simply', 'bad', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'are', '4', 'Hoffnung', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'cartoons', 'Halasz-Batchelor', 'studio', 'England', 'designed', 'very', 'specialized', 'audience', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'seen.I', ""'m"", 'amused', 'someone', 'said', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'cartoons', 'are', 'only', 'real', 'cartoons', 'box', 'Tom', 'Jerrys', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'cat', 'mouse', 'are', 'amusing', 'though.The', 'fun', 'set', 'discovering', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'will', 'be', 'while', 'get', 'around', 'Popeyes', 'other', 'famous', 'cartoons', 'said', 'are', 'simply', 'bad', 'lot', 'are', 'simply', 'amazing', 'kind', 'drugs', 'were', '1930s', 'way', 'way', 'would', 'watch', 'more', 'one', 'disc', 'sitting', 'way', 'would', 'inflict', 'child', ""'m"", 'having', 'fun', 'set.Being', 'Public', 'Domain', 'release', 'basically', 'put', 'together', 'old', 'films', 'could', 'find', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'digital', 'restoration', 'transfers', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'clean', 'clear', 'ahead', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'PD', 'VHS', 'tapes']",100 Cartoon Classics
