So why didn't I enjoy this movie more? Well, not even breasts can make up for a lackluster script and some stinky acting. Also, for a slasher movie the deaths are so lame and uninteresting. The movie kind of reminded me of a cross between Bikini Bloodbath and Jim Wynorski's Sorority House Massacre 2, only not as fun as either of those. Oh, but it has breasts.

Silly premise, silly characters, lot's of blood & tons of beautiful nekkid chicks.  Ever see an ice cream parlor in a warehouse with an industrial shower room & 3 blue lockers?  I hadn't either.  How about death by a waffle cone?  Maybe sprinkles & whip cream?Silly premise:  Guy wants to turn a profit by having his already stunning workers wear less.  All the while there's an ice cream killer doing what he does best, kill the girls off one by one with different condiments.Quirky & funny.

1256031,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B0028S10ZG,The Phantom,"[1, 2]","This had potential. Had the producers played it straight-up as a silly,  harmless  farce of horror films with much more  nudity (and better nudity), which is what I  had been expecting based on other reviews, this could have been good. It has a pretty strong female  cast for that,  though unknown Samantha  Carlson, who opens with a shower scene, is the standout  but gets killed off right away.However, the movie has far  more  gore in it  than I had been led to believe.  Sometimes that  can  be silly,  ridiculous,  overdone and played  for  laughs--there are plenty of examples out  there. However, this adds an uncomfortably-realistic  level  of  violence to  the  gore and I would imagine that most  people  who are looking for  the sexiness wouldn't want to be surprised by finding the other  junk.Even taking away that,  this movie is darn near  unwatchable.  The  writing  is terrible  (since this actually is a remake of  an  earlier picture you'd think that the producers would have had time to get it right)  with most of the supposedly funny lines missing their  marks.  Bad acting  is par  for  the course here  but  when you can tell that somebody in the cast is clueless as to how bad that he or she is, that makes things worse.  I refer in this case to the  punk  who plays the only male  employee of the ice-cream shop,  who spends the totality of the film  trying  to  imitate  Jim  Carrey as  Fire Marshall  Bill. Every time  that he  came on screen I either had to fast forward or mute. Ironically,  watching him was like taking  an ice pick to the skull.There is  a  fair  amount of nudity,  but it  isn't well-done (basically all of it just toplessness, and nearly all of it from just one of the players--Asian brunette with a plastic-looking implant  job).  Don't buy this if you're looking for an eyeful; you WILL  be disappointed.Actually I can't really give you a good reason to buy this.  There's a reason why it isn't more popular.",2,Just this side of terrible,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,1961,"['had', 'potential', 'Had', 'producers', 'played', 'straight-up', 'silly', 'harmless', 'farce', 'horror', 'films', 'much', 'more', 'nudity', 'better', 'nudity', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'expecting', 'based', 'other', 'reviews', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'pretty', 'strong', 'female', 'cast', 'unknown', 'Samantha', 'Carlson', 'who', 'shower', 'scene', 'standout', 'killed', 'off', 'right', 'away.However', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'gore', 'had', 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'be', 'silly', 'ridiculous', 'overdone', 'played', 'laughs', 'are', 'plenty', 'examples', 'there', 'However', 'uncomfortably-realistic', 'level', 'violence', 'gore', 'would', 'imagine', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'sexiness', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'surprised', 'finding', 'other', 'junk.Even', 'taking', 'away', 'movie', 'darn', 'unwatchable', 'writing', 'terrible', 'actually', 'remake', 'earlier', 'picture', ""'d"", 'think', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'time', 'get', 'right', 'most', 'supposedly', 'funny', 'lines', 'missing', 'marks', 'Bad', 'acting', 'par', 'course', 'here', 'when', 'can', 'tell', 'somebody', 'cast', 'clueless', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'worse', 'refer', 'case', 'punk', 'who', 'only', 'male', 'employee', 'ice-cream', 'shop', 'who', 'totality', 'film', 'trying', 'imitate', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Fire', 'Marshall', 'Bill', 'time', 'came', 'screen', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'mute', 'Ironically', 'watching', 'was', 'taking', 'ice', 'pick', 'skull.There', 'fair', 'amount', 'nudity', ""n't"", 'well-done', 'basically', 'just', 'toplessness', 'nearly', 'just', 'one', 'players', 'Asian', 'brunette', 'plastic-looking', 'implant', 'job', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', ""'re"", 'looking', 'eyeful', 'WILL', 'be', 'disappointed.Actually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'good', 'reason', 'buy', 'reason', 'why', ""n't"", 'more', 'popular']",Hot Blood Sundae
