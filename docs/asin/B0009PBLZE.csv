Santana, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, the light show and hippie dancers is short in length, but still worth every penny.  SANTANA - Carlos Santana in recent years admitted the original band was his best.  They follow the Woodstock performance here playing two instrumetals proving they were no one hit wonders.  ""Abraxas"" was not out yet, so it was still a work in progress.  The musicianship is better than Woodstock, though not the fire.  Gregg Rolie, ""Chepito"" and the rest made this more of a group than in the later years when the guitar hero was backed by... ""Who's He Got This Year""? THE GRATEFUL DEAD -  Why was this band never the same after Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan died?  He was the group's premier showstopper. Jerry Garcia was the leader, ""Pigpen"" the spark plug.  He lets it all go on the R&B ""Hard To Handle"" lifting the room to peak level.  The jam on ""China Cat"" is just a notch bellow ""Europe 72"".  Still doggone good.  The drummers sizzle.  JEFFERSON AIRPLANE - Jack Casady's blistering bass solo alone on ""The Ballad Of You & Me & Pooneil"" is something to watch and hear.  The guy is wired.  Grace Slick, vocals and Jorma Kaukonen, guitar are in sync on ""Eskimo Blue Day"" even though after the song, it's apparent Slick is loaded.  This was a great 60's band that splintered later into three parts.  The Airplane is better here than at Woodstock and Monterey.  THE ALLSTAR JAM is good only for watching.  Carlos, Jerry and Jorma seem to respect each other too much rather than trying to top each other.  Which band steals the show?  It's a three way tie, all having shining moments that will never again will be dupliated.  Now that ""A Night At The Family Dog"" is finally available, I hope next to follow will be the ""Fillmore: Last Days"" movie on DVD.",5,SAN FRANCISCO'S FINEST HOUR,1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,1865,"['film', 'quality', '1970', 'average', 'best', 'DVD', 'Rock', 'essential', 'Santana', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'light', 'show', 'hippie', 'dancers', 'short', 'length', 'still', 'worth', 'penny', 'SANTANA', 'Carlos', 'Santana', 'recent', 'years', 'admitted', 'original', 'band', 'was', 'best', 'follow', 'Woodstock', 'performance', 'here', 'playing', 'two', 'instrumetals', 'proving', 'were', 'one', 'hit', 'wonders', 'Abraxas', 'was', 'not', 'out', 'yet', 'was', 'still', 'work', 'progress', 'musicianship', 'better', 'Woodstock', 'not', 'fire', 'Gregg', 'Rolie', 'Chepito', 'rest', 'made', 'more', 'group', 'later', 'years', 'when', 'guitar', 'hero', 'was', 'backed', 'Who', 'Got', 'Year', 'GRATEFUL', 'DEAD', 'Why', 'was', 'band', 'never', 'same', 'Ron', 'Pigpen', 'McKernan', 'died', 'was', 'group', 'premier', 'showstopper', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'was', 'leader', 'Pigpen', 'spark', 'plug', 'go', 'R', 'B', 'Hard', 'Handle', 'lifting', 'room', 'peak', 'level', 'jam', 'China', 'Cat', 'just', 'notch', 'Europe', '72', 'Still', 'doggone', 'good', 'drummers', 'sizzle', 'JEFFERSON', 'AIRPLANE', 'Jack', 'Casady', 'blistering', 'bass', 'solo', 'alone', 'Ballad', 'Me', 'Pooneil', 'something', 'watch', 'hear', 'guy', 'wired', 'Grace', 'Slick', 'vocals', 'Jorma', 'Kaukonen', 'guitar', 'are', 'sync', 'Eskimo', 'Blue', 'Day', 'even', 'song', 'apparent', 'Slick', 'loaded', 'was', 'great', '60', 'band', 'splintered', 'later', 'three', 'parts', 'Airplane', 'better', 'here', 'Woodstock', 'Monterey', 'THE', 'ALLSTAR', 'JAM', 'good', 'only', 'watching', 'Carlos', 'Jerry', 'Jorma', 'seem', 'respect', 'other', 'too', 'much', 'rather', 'trying', 'top', 'other', 'Which', 'band', 'show', 'three', 'way', 'tie', 'having', 'shining', 'moments', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'dupliated', 'Now', 'Night', 'Family', 'Dog', 'finally', 'available', 'hope', 'next', 'follow', 'will', 'be', 'Fillmore', 'Last', 'Days', 'movie', 'DVD']",A Night at the Family Dog 1970: (The Grateful Dead / Jefferson Airplane / Santana)

These are good performances. One thing that really stood out is at least Airplane and Santana were at Woodstock and I think the Dead were too but my copy of the movie doesnt show the Dead. What stood out is how the songs were streamlined for the different venues to be performed in.I immediately noted the way the bands play the music in a much smaller venue and the music seems to be styled and of course sounded for the smaller gathering as it was inside and of course no match for the stage at Woodstock. I noticed this particularly with Santana's Soul Sacrifice. The drum solo by Aynsley Dunbar was a little bit longer here than at Woodstock but not near the heaviness. Even though I still very muched liked it.Not much of a Dead fan but I did really like their performance all the way through. I have the first four albums of this incarnation of them so this set really appealed to me.Airplane alas needs more room to breathe with all the talent in the band. So even though I like having their performance here, I much much prefer them at Woodstock and on the DVD ""Fly"" as another reviewer noted.Very good would highly recommended and dont get on your high horse about the audio and video of the day, it is just alright with me.",5,Glad I own this piece of history,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,1363,"['actually', 'sat', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'out', 'doing', 'work', 'wife', 'assigned', 'just', 'got', 'lost', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'least', 'Airplane', 'Santana', 'were', 'Woodstock', 'think', 'Dead', 'were', 'too', 'copy', 'movie', 'doesnt', 'show', 'Dead', 'What', 'stood', 'out', 'how', 'songs', 'were', 'streamlined', 'different', 'venues', 'be', 'performed', 'in.I', 'immediately', 'noted', 'way', 'bands', 'play', 'music', 'much', 'smaller', 'venue', 'music', 'be', 'styled', 'course', 'sounded', 'smaller', 'gathering', 'was', 'inside', 'course', 'match', 'stage', 'Woodstock', 'noticed', 'particularly', 'Santana', 'Soul', 'Sacrifice', 'drum', 'solo', 'Aynsley', 'Dunbar', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'here', 'Woodstock', 'not', 'heaviness', 'Even', 'still', 'very', 'muched', 'liked', 'it.Not', 'much', 'Dead', 'fan', 'did', 'really', 'like', 'performance', 'way', 'have', 'first', 'four', 'albums', 'incarnation', 'so', 'set', 'really', 'appealed', 'me.Airplane', 'alas', 'more', 'room', 'breathe', 'talent', 'band', 'So', 'even', 'like', 'having', 'performance', 'here', 'much', 'much', 'prefer', 'Woodstock', 'DVD', 'Fly', 'reviewer', 'noted.Very', 'good', 'would', 'highly', 'recommended', 'dont', 'get', 'high', 'horse', 'audio', 'video', 'day', 'just', 'alright']",A Night at the Family Dog 1970: (The Grateful Dead / Jefferson Airplane / Santana)
910103,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B0009PBLZE,Green Manalishi,"[0, 0]","Early Santana is as much a visual experience as it is aural and this show certainly lets you appreciate it on that level.  Something about seeing the conga players hands in action, Santana's rhythm section in action is something to behold.  It's kind of funny watching Santana smoke (a cigarette?) as he watches his drum player work the kit during a solo.  The facials say it all. Santana's progressive latin rock jazz masterpiece ""Soul Sacrifice"" shines in this performance and it's great to watch the players ride it out.Pig Pen's performance on ""So Hard To Handle"" is top notch, and I don't know about anyone else, but I wouldn't have traded in those shots of the bra-less hippy dancers for anything!  Perfect touch, and in slow-motion too! What would the Dead be without their inspired audience?Actually, some of the dancers are stage-dancers and were probably paid for the show and this production - many are gorgeous and have been placed in ideal camera locations - it's doubtful they just popped in off the street.  They did seem somewhat out of place though during Grace Slick's performance - like, come on, Grace Slick is woman enough! She looked pretty good too, though we only see her sing one song (of course, only 2 are featured).Besides the total of 7 songs from the above players, an 'all-star jam' with guys from all the 3 bands is included.These performances are all great - too few - but great for what's there.  A pretty good showcase of the times, it's a stoney evening at the Family Dog for sure on this night in 1970.

With this in mind you need to remember that this was done in 1970 and is not up to today's standards what you do get is a taste of three of the top bands from that era at their best. All three bands have their original lineup this is before all of the changes in years to come. Funny that all three are still active today but in a little different form Carlos is still going strong (I got to see him this past summer and he easy amazing). We now have Furthur who are stronger than ever (saw them this summer also). And now we have Hot Tuna who have been around the years with Jorma and Jack faithfully there. Each group on the dvd do two songs ( if you consider China Cat/Rider as one) there is a nice jam with all three bands at the end. Now back in 1970 to be able to see these guys on TV was a big deal.

The video quality is quite good, considering color videotape was only a few years along, and the extrapolated Dolby 5.1 Surround is phenomenal, since this was originally recorded in mono.  There is a sense, however, as a previous reviewer noted, that these bands were about to leave the period that had been their most formative and creative.  The Airplane degenerated into Starship, the Dead became a noodling nostalgia act for Haight wannabees, and Santana became, well, Carlos Santana.
