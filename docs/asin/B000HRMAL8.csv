1015485,A1X4AI4AZOVMAM,B000HRMAL8,Betty A. Ludwig,"[28, 30]","You will get a decent workout from this DVD but it's not one of my favorites. It's more aerobic than Leslie Sansone's WOTPs series which I really like. However, the choreography is a little challenging and her queuing is not the best. It's broken into three sections that you can choose from. There is an accelerated cardio, regular cardio, and body sculpting segment. However, there is only 3 minutes difference between the accelerated cardio (25 minutes) and the regular cardio (28 minutes). The body sculpting segment isn't bad but almost as soon as you put down the weights she asks you to pick them up again. This happens multiple times throughout the 24 minute segment. Another exercise she loves is lunges so if you aren't into lunges you might want to stay away from Chris Freytag workouts. I would recommend Walk Your Way Slim with Michelle Dozios and Get Moving, Walking for Weight Loss with Madeleine Lewis. Both of these are excellent. They are both on the same aerobic level as this workout but I like them far more. Walking for Weight Loss with Madeleine Lewis has toning sections that I found to be much better than Chris Freytag's. If you don't want any toning with weights then Walk Your Way Slim with Michelle Dozios would be a good choice. Overall, it's not a bad workout which is why I gave it 3 stars but the other two DVDs that I mentioned are 5 star workouts in my opinion.",3,Not a bad workout but...,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,1396,"['will', 'get', 'decent', 'workout', 'DVD', 'not', 'one', 'favorites', 'more', 'aerobic', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'WOTPs', 'series', 'really', 'However', 'choreography', 'little', 'challenging', 'queuing', 'not', 'best', 'broken', 'three', 'sections', 'can', 'choose', 'accelerated', 'cardio', 'regular', 'cardio', 'body', 'sculpting', 'segment', 'However', 'only', '3', 'minutes', 'difference', 'accelerated', 'cardio', '25', 'minutes', 'regular', 'cardio', '28', 'minutes', 'body', 'sculpting', 'segment', ""n't"", 'bad', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'put', 'down', 'weights', 'pick', 'up', 'again', 'multiple', 'times', '24', 'minute', 'segment', 'exercise', 'lunges', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'lunges', 'might', 'want', 'stay', 'away', 'Chris', 'Freytag', 'would', 'recommend', 'Walk', 'Way', 'Slim', 'Michelle', 'Dozios', 'Get', 'Moving', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Madeleine', 'Lewis', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'same', 'aerobic', 'level', 'workout', 'like', 'far', 'more', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Madeleine', 'Lewis', 'toning', 'sections', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'Chris', 'Freytag', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'toning', 'weights', 'then', 'Walk', 'Your', 'Way', 'Slim', 'Michelle', 'Dozios', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'workout', 'why', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'other', 'two', 'DVDs', 'mentioned', 'are', '5', 'star', 'workouts', 'opinion']",Prevention Fitness Systems: Walk Yourself Fit

I have tried Leslie Sansome and can only do her workouts a few times before I get bored.  This workout however was a nice change of pace as Chris Freytag is great and she incorporates a lot more movement than Leslie does.  There are three styles you can follow: Cardio, Body Shaping, and Accelerated (I believe).  I am currently doing the Cardio section and I just love it!  I get more variety and Chris is very motivating.  There is some high impact jumping but I was able to easily do my own low impact modifications.

1015489,A23UX01YN75YQC,B000HRMAL8,H. Scott,"[4, 4]","I wanted to give this 5 stars. I really really did. There are 3 workouts to chose from. Accelerated, Body shaping and Cardio - or ABC as the instructor puts it.Workout B & C are awesome. Love them. Fun and sweaty. About 25 minutes with warm up and cool down. The B workout uses weights. There are 4 weight-using sections. So you do cardio, then 1 minute of weights, then back to cardio. It's really good. Workout C, or Cardio, is basically just a walking/marching/kicking/with some fancy footwork. Stick to it, you'll pick it up in a few minutes. Then you feel pretty smart.Ok, here is why I took off a star. I don't like The Firm workouts. I'm not that coordinated. I don't want to dance myself fit in a choreographied workout. I just want an effective, minimal brain function exercise. I have other things to think about then if I'm going to twist my knee out of socket because I can't do the jumping, twisting, fancy steps. That's just me. You may like that kind of thing, in which case you should do workout A, the Accelerated Workout.It wasn't fun, for me. I don't want to spend my precious workout time trying to learn fancy dance steps. I have limited space, limited time. So, I just skip this one. I hope I don't sound bitter, but it was disappointing. Afterall, this is a ""WALK yourself fit"", not a ""crazy dancy, fancy-moves yourself fit"". so there!I have done B & C workouts several time and I like it!! I like Chris Freytag a lot and I'll keep buying her dvds. She's good at what she does.Oh, the back up exercisers are good too. All sorts of ages and body shapes.
