Instead, I found the whole  story and execution heartwarming without a wasted step.Duschaine, (Antonio Banderas) is a ballroom dance school instructor, who witnesses a student committing serious vandalism at a neighboring New York school.  Taking matters into his own hands, he offers his volunteer services to the boy's principal whose own spunky determination sees his vision as a primrose path.  Greeted by cynicism by staff and students alike, his persistence is a testament to proving you can do just about anything, depending on your approach and method.  (Afterall, if Tony Bennett can be an MTV star, why not bring ballroom dancing to ""at risk"" students?)The acting is decent, even if it briefly falls flat in certain scenes, but they never lose a step with the editing, adding the strife of key students to the movie's rhythm. The dancing is always in fine form, providing nary a wasted moment for the drama or the dancefloor.

996416,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FUTVLY,A Customer,"[9, 12]","Overly plotted, sloppily directed, but utilizing some passable dance sequences, Take The Lead won't show you anything new that you haven't seen in the documentary Mad Hot Ballroom or even on Fox's You Think You Can Dance. Alfie Woodard and Antonio Banderas indeed save this movie, which is full of clich&eacute;d characters and middling dance music cornball.The movie starts off well, combining the world of privilege and elegant ballroom dancing with the frantic world and survival mode existence of rough and tough inner-city high school students. Banderas plays Pierre Dulaine, a man who believes in the transformative power of art, and so he volunteers to teach ballroom dancing at a tough, inner-city high school in New York.Dulaine seems a bit out of place to say the least; his ideas are at once ridiculed by teachers and students - particularly by the hard-bitten, cynical school principal (Woodard). As a form of punishment, he's given the job of supervising detention hall. No one expects the kids to let alone listen to him. They protest and give him attitude but they learn, nonetheless and actually begin to enjoy the dancing.Take the Lead would have been much more compelling - and probably a much better film - if there were just more dancing. There's one spectacular tango that Banderas does with one of his ritzy, upper Westside students, but most of the foot action consists of a strange hybrid of ballroom and hip-hop style, which doesn't quite work.Most annoying are the endless subplots of Rock (Rob Brown) and Lahrette (Yaya DaCosta), two of the group who are basically good kids trying to survive terrible home lives. Furthermore, we never get a clear sense of why Dulaine is doing this, he lost his wife five years previously and he's obviously a little tired of coaching privileged white kids, but his decision to teach these mostly black, marginalized kids lacks isn't made that clear.Then there's the love triangle, the teacher who wants Dulaine removed from the school, the dangerous john, the sick dad, Rock's flirtation with crime, the worried debutante, her mother, her mother's reputation and the all-white dance judges. And it all becomes a bit much, especially as the film wears on for nearly two hours. Given the shallowness of their roles, the performers are all fine, and believable - even if some aspects of the movie are not.Banderas as usual is smoldering and sexy - although in some scenes he's starting to look a little long in the tooth. Nevertheless he does a good job of portraying a prim, proper and chivalrous European gentleman who sweeps these disenfranchised kids up by giving them a new lease on life and showing them how to relate to one another through the power of dance.

996420,A2SW560X584UEF,B000FUTVLY,Barbara B.,"[1, 2]","Like ""Music of the Heart,"" this film was inspired by a true story of a mentoring program in NY city schools. This time, it's a NY dance teacher who starts a ballroom dance program for inner school kids.It's an enjoyable film with the gorgeous Bandares in the lead but the film makers apparently weren't satisfied with the real-life teacher's accomplishments. They felt they had to embellish them out of all sense of reality.Instead of showing Dulaine's students as energetic but definitely amateur dancers, the film has them competing in a major ballroom dancing competition. The supposed impromptu tango performed during the competition is clearly one that would have required extensive choreography and rehearsing. Are we supposed to believe that these kids, with only a few months of training, could put on an exhibition worthy of ""Flashdance""?In addition, the bonus feature on the real Dulaine shows that most of his students were grade schoolers, not the teenagers depicted in the film. The sexy dancing of the film was far removed from the innocent, graceful fox trots and waltz's of real life classes.The ending was also a bit of a let down for me. The classes were supposed to teach the kids (among other things) respect for other people. Yet they commandeer the competition's sound system and disrupt the entire event by dancing to blaring rap and hip-hop music (definitely NOT ballroom dancing by the way!).

996422,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000FUTVLY,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 0]","The life of Pierre Dulaine would, in itself, make a great movie or documentary; of mixed heritage, growing up in the Middle East, he discovered ballroom dancing as a teen in early '70s London, became a champion dancer, then emigrated to America, where he conceived the concept of teaching New York elementary school children dance, to build confidence and share in his passion, creating an urban program which has become a spectacular success.Sadly, little of this reaches the screen, in ""Take the Lead""; in it's place, you get a bored society dance instructor (Antonio Banderas), who, after seeing a car vandalized, decides to enlist his services at the local high school, where he turns detention into a makeshift dance studio for a stereotyped collection of misfits. Equal parts ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""The Breakfast Club"", and ""Footloose"", the film suffers from too predictable subplots, particularly of two black teens (Rob Brown and Yaya DaCosta), enemies after a shared tragedy, who, naturally, fall in love. While Brown and DaCosta both give excellent performances, it takes precious time away from the dancing that provides the film it's magic. Equally distracting are the 'class distinction' jabs between the 'society' dance students, and intercity teens, and an attempt to meld classic pop 'standards' and 'modern' music, creating a new hybrid dance style which immediately finds favor at a 'traditional' ballroom dance competition...a concept that was silly in the disco days of ""Flashdance"", and is even sillier, today!Frequently lost in all the 'baggage' is a restrained, yet charismatic portrayal of Dulaine by Antonio Banderas, and another of Alfre Woodard's tough-talking, 'heart of gold' School Principal roles; the chemistry between the pair is great fun, whenever they share the screen.""Take the Lead"" is, ultimately, an average film that misses an opportunity to be truly special; the kids, Dulaine, and dancing, itself, deserve far better!",3,"Clich&eacute;d Misfire, Redeemed, Somewhat, by  Performances...",1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,1958,"['life', 'Pierre', 'Dulaine', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'documentary', 'mixed', 'heritage', 'growing', 'up', 'Middle', 'East', 'discovered', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'teen', 'early', ""'70s"", 'London', 'became', 'champion', 'dancer', 'then', 'emigrated', 'America', 'where', 'conceived', 'concept', 'teaching', 'New', 'York', 'elementary', 'school', 'children', 'dance', 'build', 'confidence', 'share', 'passion', 'creating', 'urban', 'program', 'become', 'spectacular', 'success.Sadly', 'little', 'screen', 'Take', 'Lead', 'place', 'get', 'bored', 'society', 'dance', 'instructor', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'who', 'seeing', 'car', 'vandalized', 'enlist', 'services', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'detention', 'makeshift', 'dance', 'studio', 'stereotyped', 'collection', 'misfits', 'Equal', 'parts', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Footloose', 'film', 'suffers', 'too', 'predictable', 'subplots', 'particularly', 'two', 'black', 'teens', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'Yaya', 'DaCosta', 'enemies', 'shared', 'tragedy', 'who', 'naturally', 'fall', 'love', 'Brown', 'DaCosta', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'precious', 'time', 'away', 'dancing', 'film', 'magic', 'Equally', 'distracting', 'are', ""'class"", 'distinction', 'jabs', ""'society"", 'dance', 'students', 'intercity', 'teens', 'attempt', 'meld', 'classic', 'pop', ""'standards"", ""'modern"", 'music', 'creating', 'new', 'hybrid', 'dance', 'style', 'immediately', 'favor', ""'traditional"", 'ballroom', 'dance', 'competition', 'concept', 'was', 'silly', 'disco', 'days', 'Flashdance', 'even', 'sillier', 'today', 'Frequently', 'lost', ""'baggage"", 'restrained', 'yet', 'charismatic', 'portrayal', 'Dulaine', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'tough-talking', ""'heart"", 'gold', 'School', 'Principal', 'roles', 'chemistry', 'pair', 'great', 'fun', 'whenever', 'share', 'screen', 'Take', 'Lead', 'ultimately', 'average', 'film', 'opportunity', 'be', 'truly', 'special', 'kids', 'Dulaine', 'dancing', 'deserve', 'far', 'better']",N/A

Specifically, this applies to films based on real people or real situations. They often get Hollywoodized (i.e., they stray far from the actual person or situation) but remain entertaining. Cinderella Man is a case in point. It delved into the family of a hardworking and hard-hitting boxer during the depression. The subject matter was interesting and scripted well.Now we come to TAKE THE LEAD, a story based real-life ballroom dance king Pierre Dulaine, a man who brought the foxtrot, the waltz and the tango to New York area schools. Antonio Banderas plays Pierre and does so admirably. He can dance his rearend off and is a believable Dulaine.But where the story falls apart is in its telling, not necessarily the acting. Although several of the young men and women who secured parts in the film were less than stellar, they did contain the appropriate energy and distrust of anything new one would hope to see from teenagers in high school. The story, however, was a mess.Screenplay writer Dianne Houston is more appropriate for television productions rather than full length feature films (from what I've seen of her current resume), and her talent here was seriously lacking. The story of the kids' lives beyond dance is glossed over far too often, as is Pierre's past history (the death of his wife is only touched on, as is a budding relationship with a fellow dancer where he works).The dance sequences are good but don't come close to CHICAGO or MOULIN ROUGE. Even the ending competition is ""just okay."" I don't mind films that focus on real people and real situations, but they need to be told in a fashion that allows the viewer to get in tight with the characters, not just the dance moves. Which leads me to believe that his would've made an excellent documentary. I understand there's already been a short documentary made about this fascinating man and his dance instructions with kids.

Everyone is genuinely trying to shine, even the newcomers.The dancing choreography and routines will blow you away. Minute for minute, dancing this good hasn't been seen on screen since the climaxes of ""Strictly Ballroom"" or ""Swing Kids"".As you're watching the first hour and a half or so, the movie builds up a pretty impressive head of steam, generating all sorts of wonderful plots and subplots, and really building all the characters.Then the big dance scene arrives, seemingly too soon. You are treated to one of the most original and well-choreographed tango routines ever put in an english-speaking movie. Strong words, perhaps, but I'm serious.Then, as quickly as the tango routine begins, it ends, and the movie falls apart in seconds, with a pitiful attempt at a feel-good ending imitative of ""Strictly Ballroom"".That's it.

""Take the Lead"" is derivative, formulaic, and ________ (fill in cliche of your choice). But what disturbed me most is its breezy disrespect of women. Yes I know that's 'cliche' too, but here the callous contempt was especially off-putting, in its various and sundried forms. From the openly hostile behavior of the students to the chivalrous-to-a-fault behavior of the dance instructor, women are objectified as being something other than human. Just for starters, what pushed the character of ""Rock"" over the edge into extreme mayhem and vandalism in the opening sequence? Answer: His ""friends"" called him by a vulgar term meaning ""woman"". (What could be more 'insulting' than that?) That moment early on is comparable to a gun firing at the start of a race: ""And they're OFF!""The separate feature on the DVD about Pierre Dulaine (the real deal) is entertaining and instructive, but I think that attempting to lend credence to ""Take the Lead"" by assigning Dulaine's name to the character of the dance instructor is bogus.

996453,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FUTVLY,Grady Harp,"[8, 8]","The concept of taking the gentility of ballroom dancing with all the skills and discipline it requires and using that as a means of changing young people who are floating aimlessly toward possible destruction is a sound one, as evidenced in this 'biography' of the life of Pierre Dulaine.  Unfortunately the topic is overused to the point of becoming a ho-hum script gimmick and that is unfortunate. There are many things to like about this film, but the script and direction manage to go for sellout at the end, ruining what otherwise could have been a tender film.Antonio Banderas plays Dulaine, a man with a void in his life which changes when he encounters a highschool lad Rock (Rob Brown) destroying the highschool principal's car: Principal Augustine James (Alfre Woodard) is a hard-nosed disciplinarian whose heart is in the right place but who alienates her students, creating the need for a Detention Hall.  Dulaine approaches James with the idea of teaching the tough kids ballroom dancing while they are in detention and after some thought, James goes for it.  Dulaine is faced with unbelieving  and disrespectful students, which he eventually wins over on terms that show respect for their potential and the ballroom dancing begins - a competition just happens to be in the offing!The young cast is fairly strong, with some actors such as Yaya DaCosta, Jenna Dewan, Jasika Nicole, Dante Basco, Brandon D. Andrews, and  Marcus T. Paulk being particularly fine.  The girls are the dancers here and they steal the show. The problems with the script are with the choices of emphasis: we know little about Dulaine and too much about incidental kids.  But the message is clear.  The movie begins well, sags in the middle, and then just when there is the big finish, the story about the influence of ballroom dancing, etiquette, and pride disintegrates into a rather meaningless and long hip-hop session on a formal dance floor.  Banderas and Woodard try to hold it together.

996458,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000FUTVLY,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","I don't know if I would've bought into this premise if I hadn't seen the film's opening declaration: Inspired by a true story. As it is, the idea of angry, hard-boiled inner city kids being won over by ballroom dancing still seems a bit far-fetched. But Dulaine, an acclaimed past ballroom champion who, with his dance partner Yvonne Marceau, turned his performing company into an outreach program - called Dancing Classrooms - apparently did indeed positively influence and is still influencing many schools in the New York City boroughs. To quote Mr. Dulaine in a New York Daily News interview: ""The reason I started the program was because I was so timid and shy, and dancing really helped my confidence so much."" As illustrated in one scene in TAKE THE LEAD, Banderas as Dulaine talks to disgruntled parents about the pluses of ballroom dancing and how, in fact, it cultivates self-confidence and a trust and respect for others, all invaluable assets to have as one goes thru life.Of course, ""Inspired by a true story"" means that changes were made with the way it really went down. The biggest liberty that TAKE THE LEAD takes with Dulaine's story is that it bumps up the age of his students from those in the fifth/sixth grade bracket to those old enough to be in high school. That, and the over-emphasis on hip-hop. Both changes, of course, were intended to attract a wider audience; the intention misfired as I believe the domestic box office garnered a paltry 35 million. Dulaine's program, Dancing Classrooms, is also featured in the great documentary MAD HOT BALLROOM, which focused on fifth-graders competing in a New York city-wide dance-off. Most folks, including me, believe that MAD HOT BALLROOM is actually the far more entertaining picture and a more suited homage to Pierre Dulaine and his great efforts.But on to the film at hand: Antonio Banderas, as ever, brings a certain sincerity, grace, and energy, along with that old-school Spanish charm. And he can dance a little. In fact, my favorite part of the film is the steamy tango he dances with his sexy uptown student. The always reliable Alfre Woodard is predictably solid as the tough but caring principal. Reb Brown, a young, promising actor who, here, contributes with a good performance, unfortunately doesn't seem as comfortable with ballroom dancing as he is with acting. The last actor of note is Yaya DaCosta as LaRhette; she's pretty good.Unfortunately, the story is not. The plot is bogged down with predictability, as well as with the teen cast's forays into their embattled personal lives, which is meant to give them added depth but instead ends up making their characters staid and cliched. There are four romantic or quasi-romantic relationships here, all involving our ballroom delinquents, and the only remotely intriguing one is Rock and LaRhette's; sorry, but I wasn't feeling the love triangle amongst Sasha, Ramos, and the other kid. And, yes, I agree that the best parts of the film are the dance sequences, which never fail to bring life and energy to the screen. Reb Brown aside, the movie offers actors who bring the heat on the dance floor. The three-person tango in the competition stands out in my mind. Reb Brown and Yaya DaCosta's waltz does not. There's stuff thrown in the film at which I couldn't help scoffing. That Mr. Dulaine was able to bring the detention class to heel by simply playing his music too loud is pretty sneer-worthy. And, shown during the closing credits, I don't at all buy that the elder stalwarts at the tradition-bound ballroom competition would've looked on with such benevolence at the kids' hiphop hijinks on the floor - not to mention, joining in at the end for a free-for-all dance-fest. It'd be nice if something like that were to happen, but the way the scene was presented...no...As I've said, I don't know if I would've bought into this premise going in. And, the thing is, TAKE THE LEAD doesn't really do a good job of making the story credible or convincing, true as certain aspects of it may have been. It's a pleasant enough movie, though you'll roll your eyes in spots. In the end, though, should I ever need to recommend a film about ballroom dancing, I think I'll go with the original, Japanese SHALL WE DANCE? or MAD HOT BALLROOM. TAKE THE LEAD gets two and a half stars from me, the last half star because of a snippet of a classic Rakim joint the film played in passing.",3,"""Check Mr. Dulaine getting his flirt on""",1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,4418,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'premise', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'opening', 'declaration', 'Inspired', 'true', 'story', 'idea', 'angry', 'hard-boiled', 'inner', 'city', 'kids', 'being', 'won', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'still', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'Dulaine', 'acclaimed', 'past', 'ballroom', 'champion', 'who', 'dance', 'partner', 'Yvonne', 'Marceau', 'turned', 'performing', 'company', 'outreach', 'program', 'called', 'Dancing', 'Classrooms', 'apparently', 'did', 'indeed', 'positively', 'influence', 'still', 'influencing', 'many', 'schools', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'boroughs', 'quote', 'Mr.', 'Dulaine', 'New', 'York', 'Daily', 'News', 'interview', 'reason', 'started', 'program', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'timid', 'shy', 'dancing', 'really', 'helped', 'confidence', 'so', 'much', 'illustrated', 'one', 'scene', 'TAKE', 'THE', 'LEAD', 'Banderas', 'Dulaine', 'talks', 'disgruntled', 'parents', 'pluses', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'how', 'fact', 'self-confidence', 'trust', 'respect', 'others', 'invaluable', 'assets', 'have', 'one', 'thru', 'life.Of', 'course', 'Inspired', 'true', 'story', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'way', 'really', 'went', 'down', 'biggest', 'liberty', 'LEAD', 'Dulaine', 'story', 'up', 'age', 'students', 'fifth/sixth', 'grade', 'bracket', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'over-emphasis', 'hip-hop', 'changes', 'course', 'were', 'intended', 'attract', 'wider', 'audience', 'intention', 'misfired', 'believe', 'domestic', 'box', 'office', 'garnered', 'paltry', '35', 'million', 'Dulaine', 'program', 'Dancing', 'Classrooms', 'also', 'featured', 'great', 'documentary', 'MAD', 'HOT', 'BALLROOM', 'focused', 'fifth-graders', 'competing', 'New', 'York', 'city-wide', 'dance-off', 'Most', 'folks', 'including', 'believe', 'MAD', 'HOT', 'BALLROOM', 'actually', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'picture', 'more', 'suited', 'homage', 'Pierre', 'Dulaine', 'great', 'efforts.But', 'film', 'hand', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'ever', 'certain', 'sincerity', 'grace', 'energy', 'old-school', 'Spanish', 'charm', 'can', 'dance', 'little', 'fact', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'steamy', 'tango', 'sexy', 'uptown', 'student', 'always', 'reliable', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'predictably', 'solid', 'tough', 'caring', 'principal', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'young', 'promising', 'actor', 'who', 'here', 'good', 'performance', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'seem', 'comfortable', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'acting', 'last', 'actor', 'note', 'Yaya', 'DaCosta', 'LaRhette', 'pretty', 'good.Unfortunately', 'story', 'not', 'plot', 'bogged', 'down', 'predictability', 'as', 'well', 'teen', 'cast', 'forays', 'embattled', 'personal', 'lives', 'meant', 'give', 'added', 'depth', 'instead', 'up', 'making', 'characters', 'staid', 'cliched', 'are', 'four', 'romantic', 'quasi-romantic', 'relationships', 'here', 'involving', 'ballroom', 'delinquents', 'only', 'remotely', 'intriguing', 'one', 'Rock', 'LaRhette', 'sorry', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'love', 'triangle', 'amongst', 'Sasha', 'Ramos', 'other', 'kid', 'yes', 'agree', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'dance', 'sequences', 'never', 'fail', 'bring', 'life', 'energy', 'screen', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'aside', 'movie', 'actors', 'who', 'bring', 'heat', 'dance', 'floor', 'three-person', 'tango', 'competition', 'out', 'mind', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'Yaya', 'DaCosta', 'waltz', 'not', 'stuff', 'thrown', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'scoffing', 'Mr.', 'Dulaine', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'detention', 'class', 'heel', 'simply', 'playing', 'music', 'too', 'loud', 'pretty', 'sneer-worthy', 'shown', 'closing', 'credits', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'elder', 'stalwarts', 'tradition-bound', 'ballroom', 'competition', 'would', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'such', 'benevolence', 'kids', 'hiphop', 'hijinks', 'floor', 'not', 'mention', 'joining', 'end', 'free-for-all', 'dance-fest', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'something', 'were', 'happen', 'way', 'scene', 'was', 'presented', ""'ve"", 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'premise', 'going', 'thing', 'TAKE', 'LEAD', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'story', 'credible', 'convincing', 'true', 'certain', 'aspects', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'roll', 'eyes', 'spots', 'end', 'should', 'ever', 'need', 'recommend', 'film', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'think', ""'ll"", 'go', 'original', 'Japanese', 'SHALL', 'WE', 'DANCE', 'MAD', 'HOT', 'BALLROOM', 'TAKE', 'LEAD', 'two', 'half', 'stars', 'last', 'half', 'star', 'snippet', 'classic', 'Rakim', 'joint', 'film', 'played', 'passing']",N/A

996470,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000FUTVLY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Trust me, I know ballroom dancing is all the rage. From the train wreck appeal of TV's ""Dancing with the Stars"" to the hit documentary ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" (and everything in between), you can't escape this current phenomena. Ballroom dancing has become cool. So naturally, more and more films are hoping to cash in on this craze. ""Take the Lead"" is the latest cookie-cutter crowd pleaser to have inner city kids reformed by unorthodox teaching methods. Inspired by the true story of Pierre Dulaine, ""Take the Lead"" casts Antonio Banderas as a dancing instructor who develops an afterschool program for troubled teens. Remember, however, that this story is ""inspired by"" Dulaine (who also consulted on the film)--it is not ""based"" in fact.This distinction becomes important when approaching ""Take the Lead"" for entertainment purposes. Those expecting a biography or a realistic portrait of the kids in question, you might be sorely disappointed. Realizing that this is another generic underdog story, however, you might appreciate the film's spirit. I don't know if there is anything I can divulge about ""Take the Lead"" that you haven't already figured out before watching one minute of actual film. Banderas witnesses a local youth (Rob Brown) vandalizing a car. Identifying the car as belonging to the high school principal, Banderas approaches her (Alfre Woodard, always a welcome pleasure) and is immediately co-opted into running an afterschool detention! Of course, he is! Why not! That's why I never walk into a school unsolicited, they might put me in charge!From this setup, Banderas starts to teach the kids how to dance. From the stock characters, to the integration of classic dance with hip hop, to the lessons on trust and teamwork, to the big competition where our kids are underdogs, to the expected conclusion--not one minute of this film holds any surprises. In fact, the artifice of the language and the unbelievable character interactions almost stop ""Take The Lead"" dead in its first hour. However, if you stick with it--the film becomes more winning. After we have dropped the illusion that these are real kids and embrace the dancing, the film comes alive.Banderas really earned his paycheck on this one--for it is his immeasurable charm that keeps ""Take the Lead"" from sinking to the level of insufferable cuteness. Despite your best intentions, you may root for his success. I know that many people will love this film and want to share in its happiness. More power to them! But the lack of reality and originality made this film far more grounded than exuberant for me. About 2 1/2 stars (I'll round up so you won't hunt me down), I still expect most to embrace this film as a crowd pleaser.

996475,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FUTVLY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","When the music stops there are two reasons that I rounded up on ""Take the Lead.""  The first is because of Antonio Banderas.  Whether he is dancing the tango or opening the door for women, you just have to keep your eyes on this guy, and since he is relatively soft spoken for most of this 2006 film, you have to pay attention to understand what he is saying.  The other reason is because of not only the aforementioned tango that Banadres dances with Katya Virshilas, but also the tango that is danced at the end of the film during the big dance competition.  Any film that has Antonio Banderas dancing the tango is going to have its moments, which the trailer for this film amply proves.Bandares plays Pierre Dulaine, who in real life was born of Irish and French parents, but obviously now needs to justify having a Spanish accent.  He teaches ballroom dance to competitive dancers and upcoming debutantes and then because of an incident in street on his way home on his bike one night he decides to walk into the high school run by Principal Augustine James (Alfre Woodard) and tells her he wants to teach kids to do ballroom dancing.  As much as a joke as anything else, she gets him to go baby sit the kids in detention in the Dungeon.  The school's rejects look at Pierre like he is from another planet, especially when he starts playing Gershwin for them.  We now what is coming from the trailer, but it takes Pierre a while before he gets the bright idea of showing the kids what ballroom dancing can be, which is where we finally get to the big tango sequence, a.k.a. ""sex on the hardwood.""  Once the kids calms down, picking their jaws up off the floor and making other anatomical adjustments, they are ready to learn how to dance the dances Pierre has been trying to teach them.The rest of the movie is challenged to top that scene, especially given the fantastic black dress Virshilas wears that looks even better in motion.  This is one of the hottest scenes in a movie I have seen all year and I cannot even think of what comes second on that list after seeing the whole bit in the movie and not just the tantalizing tidbit in the film.  You get multi-angles on the scene in the DVD's special features, which ironically underscores one of the problems in movies like this, namely that there are always so many cuts when they edit the dance scenes that it is hard to really enjoy the performances.  I have the same complaint about most action scenes, because whether we are talking fighting or dancing, I like to actually see what is going on.I loved ""Mad Hot Ballroom,"" the documentary about the much younger kids who enjoy the real Pierre Dulaine's ballroom dance lessons and competition in New York City every year.  There is really no way that this film can match the emotional power of that documentary, especially given that this is a fairly standard mentor movie, with each of the kids in the Dungeon having their own little subplot to play out, but--and this is a key difference--with people dancing the tango.  That particular dance comes back at the end when the kids get to make the tango their own.  What they do is not as stunning as the first one, but it is fairly unique as tangos go (this side of the movie version of ""Rent"").  Ultimately, ""Take the Lead"" forgoes the total conversion of the kids by their teacher to offer a synthesis in which they bring their own style to ballroom dancing.  Clearly the point here is to feel good and to dance, but music video director Liz Friedlander's debut feature film aspires to nothing more and delivers everything that was promised in the trailer.",4,What woman would not want to dance the tango with Antonio Banderas?,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,3618,"['When', 'music', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'rounded', 'up', 'Take', 'Lead', 'first', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'dancing', 'tango', 'opening', 'door', 'women', 'just', 'have', 'keep', 'eyes', 'guy', 'relatively', 'soft', 'spoken', 'most', '2006', 'film', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'understand', 'what', 'saying', 'other', 'reason', 'not', 'only', 'aforementioned', 'tango', 'dances', 'Katya', 'Virshilas', 'also', 'tango', 'danced', 'end', 'film', 'big', 'dance', 'competition', 'Any', 'film', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'dancing', 'tango', 'going', 'have', 'moments', 'trailer', 'film', 'amply', 'Pierre', 'Dulaine', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'born', 'Irish', 'French', 'parents', 'obviously', 'now', 'justify', 'having', 'Spanish', 'accent', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'competitive', 'dancers', 'upcoming', 'debutantes', 'then', 'incident', 'street', 'way', 'home', 'bike', 'one', 'night', 'walk', 'high', 'school', 'run', 'Principal', 'Augustine', 'James', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'teach', 'kids', 'do', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'As', 'much', 'joke', 'anything', 'else', 'go', 'baby', 'sit', 'kids', 'detention', 'Dungeon', 'school', 'rejects', 'look', 'Pierre', 'planet', 'especially', 'when', 'playing', 'Gershwin', 'now', 'what', 'coming', 'trailer', 'Pierre', 'while', 'bright', 'idea', 'showing', 'kids', 'what', 'dancing', 'can', 'be', 'where', 'finally', 'get', 'big', 'tango', 'sequence', 'a.k.a', 'sex', 'hardwood', 'kids', 'calms', 'down', 'picking', 'jaws', 'floor', 'making', 'other', 'anatomical', 'adjustments', 'are', 'ready', 'learn', 'how', 'dance', 'dances', 'Pierre', 'been', 'trying', 'teach', 'them.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'challenged', 'top', 'scene', 'especially', 'given', 'fantastic', 'black', 'dress', 'Virshilas', 'even', 'better', 'motion', 'one', 'hottest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'think', 'what', 'second', 'list', 'seeing', 'whole', 'bit', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'tantalizing', 'tidbit', 'film', 'get', 'multi-angles', 'scene', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'ironically', 'one', 'problems', 'movies', 'namely', 'are', 'always', 'so', 'many', 'cuts', 'when', 'edit', 'dance', 'hard', 'really', 'enjoy', 'performances', 'have', 'same', 'complaint', 'most', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'talking', 'fighting', 'dancing', 'like', 'actually', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'on.I', 'loved', 'Mad', 'Hot', 'Ballroom', 'documentary', 'much', 'younger', 'kids', 'who', 'enjoy', 'real', 'Pierre', 'Dulaine', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'lessons', 'competition', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'year', 'really', 'way', 'film', 'can', 'match', 'emotional', 'power', 'documentary', 'especially', 'given', 'fairly', 'standard', 'mentor', 'movie', 'kids', 'Dungeon', 'having', 'own', 'little', 'subplot', 'play', 'out', 'key', 'difference', 'people', 'dancing', 'tango', 'particular', 'dance', 'back', 'end', 'when', 'kids', 'get', 'make', 'tango', 'own', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'as', 'stunning', 'first', 'one', 'fairly', 'unique', 'tangos', 'go', 'side', 'movie', 'version', 'Rent', 'Ultimately', 'Take', 'Lead', 'total', 'conversion', 'kids', 'teacher', 'offer', 'synthesis', 'bring', 'own', 'style', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'Clearly', 'point', 'here', 'feel', 'good', 'dance', 'music', 'video', 'director', 'Liz', 'Friedlander', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'aspires', 'nothing', 'more', 'delivers', 'everything', 'was', 'promised', 'trailer']",N/A

996480,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B000FUTVLY,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[92, 97]","I agree with many of the reviewers that ""Take the Lead"" could have benefitted with more dance and less ""action"".  I agree that the plotline's been done before....inspirational teacher arrives at a tough school in a tough situation, is initially mistrusted by a cast of student characters, and prevails because he/she really cares to show up, to teach, and to provide an example and inspiration to the students.  Yeah, Sidney Poitier did it, yeah, Michelle Pfeiffer did it, Robin Williams - but still, the story of Pierre Dulaine is real, and it is compelling.  And the current ballroom dance ""craze"" allowed it to be brought to the screen.Banderas always brings it to his films.  He's somewhat of a caricature; the hot, smoky Spaniard with the true heart.  I choose to believe his public persona, that he's like this in real life, as well.  Banderas is more than fine as Pierre Dulaine - he has a light, believable touch.  He inspires.  It feels as though making this movie was not just another job, another role to him. I think that quality in Banderas is like the indefinable charm that Hugh Jackman brings to a role....and it's why they're as successful on stage as they are on screen.  They're living it.His student cast - a permanent, multicultural cast of detention junkies (why Yaya Dacoste as LahRette is in detention is anybody's guess), including Rob Brown as Rock (he was good here, fantastic in Finding Forrester), is quirky but endearing (yes, that's a tired clich?, from movies and TV as well).Dulaine's got a somewhat successful dance studio; he's a widower, his life is busy but not full and these kids strike a chord with him.  There's a little mix of hip hop with his ballroom in the classroom, but by far the most fascinating scene in the film takes place at the final competition, when dancer Jenna Dewan (a bit player in the saga of the romantic life of Justin Timberlake) heats up the floor dancing the tango with not ONE, but two partners (small role successes Lyriq Bent, as Easy and Dante Basco, who has big screen potential galore, as Ramos).  This trio absolutely makes the audience, both in the film and in seats in the theater stand up and cheer for a sensuous, serious and memorable dance sequence.I loved both Japanese and American versions of ""Shall We Dance?"", I was mad for ""Mad Hot Ballroom"", I even own the DVD of Vanessa Williams'  and Chayanne's hot and sexy ""Dance With Me"" which aired out Latin Ballroom Dancing well before the current film and TV craze.  And I loved, ""Take the Lead"", as well.  Formulaic, yes, a little misdirected by first time film director Liz Friedlander, but still a great movie for dance-lovers, and, similar to ""Shall We Dance?"" and ""Dance With Me"",  it will be a popular DVD for a wider audience.4 Stars!",4,"Flaws and all, I enjoyed it!",1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,2770,"['agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'Take', 'Lead', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'more', 'dance', 'less', 'action', 'agree', 'plotline', 'been', 'done', '.inspirational', 'teacher', 'tough', 'school', 'tough', 'situation', 'initially', 'mistrusted', 'cast', 'student', 'characters', 'prevails', 'he/she', 'really', 'show', 'up', 'teach', 'provide', 'example', 'inspiration', 'students', 'Yeah', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'did', 'yeah', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'did', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'still', 'story', 'Pierre', 'Dulaine', 'real', 'compelling', 'current', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'craze', 'allowed', 'be', 'brought', 'screen.Banderas', 'always', 'films', 'somewhat', 'caricature', 'hot', 'smoky', 'Spaniard', 'true', 'heart', 'choose', 'believe', 'public', 'persona', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'Banderas', 'more', 'fine', 'Pierre', 'Dulaine', 'light', 'believable', 'touch', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'job', 'role', 'think', 'quality', 'Banderas', 'indefinable', 'charm', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'role', '.and', 'why', ""'re"", 'successful', 'stage', 'are', 'screen', ""'re"", 'living', 'it.His', 'student', 'cast', 'permanent', 'multicultural', 'cast', 'detention', 'junkies', 'why', 'Yaya', 'Dacoste', 'LahRette', 'detention', 'anybody', 'guess', 'including', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'Rock', 'was', 'good', 'here', 'fantastic', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'quirky', 'endearing', 'yes', 'tired', 'clich', 'movies', 'TV', 'as', 'well', '.Dulaine', 'got', 'somewhat', 'successful', 'dance', 'studio', 'widower', 'life', 'busy', 'not', 'full', 'kids', 'strike', 'chord', 'little', 'mix', 'hip', 'hop', 'ballroom', 'classroom', 'far', 'most', 'fascinating', 'scene', 'film', 'place', 'final', 'competition', 'when', 'dancer', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'bit', 'player', 'saga', 'romantic', 'life', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'floor', 'dancing', 'tango', 'not', 'ONE', 'two', 'partners', 'small', 'role', 'successes', 'Lyriq', 'Bent', 'Easy', 'Dante', 'Basco', 'who', 'big', 'screen', 'potential', 'galore', 'Ramos', 'trio', 'absolutely', 'audience', 'film', 'seats', 'theater', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'sensuous', 'serious', 'memorable', 'dance', 'sequence.I', 'loved', 'Japanese', 'American', 'versions', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'was', 'mad', 'Mad', 'Hot', 'Ballroom', 'even', 'own', 'DVD', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'Chayanne', 'hot', 'sexy', 'Dance', 'Me', 'aired', 'out', 'Latin', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'well', 'current', 'film', 'TV', 'craze', 'loved', 'Take', 'Lead', 'as', 'well', 'Formulaic', 'yes', 'little', 'misdirected', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'director', 'Liz', 'Friedlander', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'dance-lovers', 'similar', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'Dance', 'Me', 'will', 'be', 'popular', 'DVD', 'wider', 'audience.4', 'Stars']",N/A

It caters to wealthy clients, and is struggling but slowly becoming successful.On his way home from an exhibition one night, he witnesses a student vandalizing the principal's car.  The next school day, he shows up, not to turn the student in, but to volunteer to help by teaching ballroom dance.The principal (Alfre Woodard) is reluctant to allow the non-teacher near the kids.  This is a rough inner city school, and she doesn't think he can handle it.  But she is desperate for someone to take over the detention, so she agrees to let him do that and handle the kids however he wants.Naturally, the kids don't take well to Pierre's presence in their lives.  They enjoy their hip hop music and dance and have no use for him and his old music and formal attire.  But Pierre will not give up that easily and he slowly begins to win them over.  But will it be enough?Anybody who has seen this kind of movie before already knows the answer, and this movie provides little new in that regard.  Still, even though we know the ultimate outcome, we can't help but get sucked into the story along the way.Most of the kids stay strictly in detention, with only glimpses into their life outside of school.  Two students do get spotlighted, and their stories of personal tragedy and hard home lives serve to show just how bad all the students' lives are.  That's not to say we don't come to care for the others.  By the end, it's easy to root for all the kids to succeed, not only in the final dance competition but also in life in general.As the students begin to warm up to Pierre, the movie quickly becomes fun.  While there is plenty of straight ballroom in the story, the students begin to interject some of their moves into it as well.  These create some fun scenes, especially the climatic tango.The movie has some dark moments, especially when dealing with the realities of living in the inner city.  However, before things get too dark, the story pulls back and has a fun scene that lightens the mood.  While in some movies this might spoil the theme or story, here it works well as it highlights the themes.The obvious theme is the one preached by Pierre multiple times through the film.  Learning what you can do gives you confidence in yourself.  Pierre uses ballroom dance to do this, but it just as easily could have been something else.  However, there's also the reminder that all it takes is one person to show interest in helping someone else to turn a life around.All this is enhanced by the performances.  Antonio Banderas is strong as the lead.  The actors playing the students also do a good job, giving their characters as much life as the script allows.  And it's easy to tell everyone had fun with the dance numbers.While the subject is nothing new, the movie keeps the viewer entertained.

Some reviewers have commented on the fact it's similar to all the other dance movies out there, but it's different enough to stand on its own. Er, no. The ballroom dancing is the only thing that makes it ""different"", otherwise it's exactly the same.And the story is getting old now as well. I can think as far back as Dangerous Minds (hey, that's far back for me!), with the whole teacher trying to sort out teenage delinquents, and ending happily. (I haven't seen that film in years actually, must get it again.) The whole hip-hop dance thing has been done already, most notably to me in Save The Last Dance, with a ballet student incorporating hip-hop moves into her routine. There's also Step Up which was just out, and probably many others. There's also a very similar storyline to Sister Act 2 - look out for that.I suppose the reason why I keep watching these movies is because I secretly wanted to be a dancer when I was young. But in hindsight, I never grew tall enough, and then I got curvy. I did go to dance classes, but I gave up, cos I was missing out on the afternoon cartoons. *ahem*If you loved the film Hook, look out for one of the actors, Dante Basco, who plays Ramos and played Rufio in Hook! And he hasn't changed a bit, but the hair's got shorter. Unfortunately, he's now in his thirties & playing a teenager.Overall, I don't think I would recommend this film.

As much a modern fairy tale as anything, TAKE THE LEAD is entirely unbelieveable from start to finish, the fault of the film's writers who could have make the story much more plausible. This must be a condensed and fictionalized version of Mr. Dulane's efforts to teach ballroom dancing to ghetto kids. Too bad they didn't wish to tell the real story; it would have been much more interesting I think. There is only one good ballroom dance scene in TAKE THE LEAD, a magnificently choreographed tango danced by Mr. Banderas and one of his uptown students. The rest of the film's dancing and music, in the main, is hip hop. It is significant that the soundtrack CD for TAKE THE LEAD does not have the splendid tango music for the tango Mr. Banderas danced. Now that is a real shame; instead, the album CD is mostly rap music. The script for this film is torn between telling a dance story and a bros-in-the-hood tale and suffers for it. You wonder at Mr. Banderas patience with the miscreants he is asked to teach, who are disrespectful and sullen.

Mr.Dulane (Antonio Banderas), a ballroom dancer with his own teaching studio, decides to become a detention supervisor in an inner-city school, and then to inspire and teach these kids trust and hope (among others) through ballroom dancing.  In exchange, of course, these kids teach him a little something as well. Antonio Banderas is great and is believeable as a ballroom dancer/teacher.  The supporting cast also helps carry the movie and does an amazing job.I really enjoyed this movie.  It's an inspirational story, but it also manages to keep clear of corniness and still be entertaining thanks to Banderas' great performance, but also in large part thanks to the dancing and the mix of different styles of music.  There's funny parts, there are dramatic parts, it has all the makings of a good movie, and it succeeds, even though I thought it lost its pace once or twice, but nothing the movie doesn't recover from.I also liked the fact that while it reaches wide audiences, it also has an underlying message, criticizing today's society for setting up a certain outcasting of inner-city schools.  But not to worry, the movie has no political agenda, it's all underlying.  It's an inspirational movie that's made for entertaining the audience, not beating them on the head with criticism, and in that sense the movie does exactly what it's meant to do.I highly recommend this movie.

996492,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B000FUTVLY,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","Is there a movie Antonio Banderas is in that isn't any good?  Because I sure haven't come across it yet.  Or maybe that's just my bias speaking.  But truly, this movie, while a little weak on plot, has a good message and is full of fabulous dance.  It's hard not to like it.Peter Dulaine witnesses a crime but takes the time to think a little more of it.  He arrives at the conclusion that the local high school, that serves the underprivileged, would be a good place to start a ballroom dancing class.  He is given the detention students.  Trying to inspire them he wants to teach ballroom dance, but motivating these kids will be harder than he thinks.  After all, how are they going to apply ballroom dance to their lives?Characters:Antonio Banderas: Peter DulaineRob Brown: Jason RockwellYaya DaCosta: LaRhette DudleyAlfre Woodard: Principal AugustineLauren Collins: CaitlinThere are many other characters in this movie of course, but these are the main ones.  Banderas is a very good dancer, and he just has a charisma on screen that is hard to resist.  Playing the kindly dance instructor, he does a good job at seeming to care and really wanting to teach the kids.  And of course they're all against it of course.  Especially Rockwell and Dudley who hate each other (and the hate is played very convincingly by the actors).  I think my favorite character though is Principal Augustine.  Woodard did a good job playing an over-stressed principal who still wants the best for her kids, even if it seems impossible at times.The plot is a standard one.  A bunch of run-down kids who have someone who takes an interest in them.  We've seen it before.  But the thing is, this is based off of a true story and a real dance program in New York.  So I hope to continue to see this plotline over and over.  Because it means that somebody cares..  Although I do have to say that the ending was a little cheesy and a little disrespectful to the event.  I don't think that it probably ended that way in real life, and for that I'm glad.  But I guess for Hollywood it made sense to make it a little more sensational.  The side plots of romance I did my best to ignore, since they didn't seem to go anywhere.  To me, this movie was about the dancing.And the dancing was spectacular.  Along with the music.  I enjoyed both equally.  They infused hip hop with classical dance music and it really worked.  It was something you wanted to get up and dance to as the movie was playing.  Whoever choreographed and selected the soundtrack knew what they were doing.  I could only wish there was more of the dancing in it, as I didn't quite get my fill.A very good movie that probably could have been a little better if it weren't sensationalized.  But at least it's a feel good movie, and one you'll enjoy watching.Review by M.

I saw clips of it on tv but never had the opportunity to watch the whole thing, so I purchased it and was enthralled.  The dancing is so much fun to watch and the actors are very likeable (even though the high school kids start off kind of rough).  I wouldn't call this a family friendly movie because there are some serious subjects touched upon (alcoholism, prostitution, illegal substances) but I must say I was very impressed that the profanities were kept to a minimum and there was no sex (only implied that the mother of one teen was a prostitute).  It was a touching story about how a teacher reached a group of high school trouble-makers by teaching them to ballroom dance.I LOVED the dancing.  I didn't read other reviews enough to see what everyone else thought, but it was incredible and enjoyable to watch (I wouldn't call the actors professionals as there seemed to be some disjointed spots, but the characters they played were supposed to be amateurs anyway).The music was also fantastic.  I don't like alternative or rap music, but they did some mixes with some rap and some Gershwin classics, and the mixes were amazing.

Movies in a similar vein that came to mind were ""Stand and Deliver"", which uses math, and ""Music of the Heart"", which uses music. And in terms of the plot, there are not many surprises there. But the delivery is outstanding; the music and dancing are used perfectly to make us forget about the trite plot.""Take the Lead"" is based on the true story of Mr. Pierre Dulaine, a ballroom dancer and teacher who shows the traits of an old-fashioned gentleman and argues that the dancing cultivates these characteristics. This is a movie about contrasts and about how differences can be bridged. The music and dancing are used as a perfect metaphor for this idea. Right from the beginning we see people getting ready for a party at the beat of different music, hip hop on on side and a ballade on the other. The differences tumble down from there. From the clothing to the ambiance, the world of ballroom dancing and the world of a high school party dominated by hip hop, could not be farther apart.The two worlds collide when Jason, a student at John Drake High School, is destroying the car of the principal of the school and Pierre comes along in his bike (and this is a bicycle, mind you) and inquires about Jason's acts. The next day, Mr. Dulaine shows up at the principals office and asks for a chance to teach these kids ballroom dancing. She laughs at him, but then decides to teach him a lesson and sends him to try his plan on a group of students on detention. Pierre, who we already suspect was yearning for a challenge, does not waver in his purpose. He experiences a disastrous first reunion, but little by little manages to reach these kids and show them that they can dream again.There are several things that make this film enjoyable. First, there is the dancing, which is very entertaining and uplifting, and shows some very skilled performers. I was mostly impressed by Jenna Dewan, who is outstanding in an unconventional tango scene. Then, there is the music, which ranges from silky love songs to fashionable and catching hip hop. Finally, even though the story is unoriginal, it is told in such a way that keeps us engaged throughout the duration. Overall, this is a movie worth watching if you enjoy music and dance.",4,"""I've got five bucks saying you won't be back tomorrow""",1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,2392,"['When', 'read', 'description', 'movie', 'expectation', 'will', 'get', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'time', 'using', 'dancing', 'motivator', 'Movies', 'similar', 'vein', 'came', 'mind', 'were', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'math', 'Music', 'Heart', 'music', 'terms', 'plot', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'surprises', 'there', 'delivery', 'outstanding', 'music', 'dancing', 'are', 'used', 'perfectly', 'make', 'forget', 'trite', 'plot', 'Take', 'Lead', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Mr.', 'Pierre', 'Dulaine', 'ballroom', 'dancer', 'teacher', 'who', 'traits', 'old-fashioned', 'gentleman', 'dancing', 'characteristics', 'movie', 'contrasts', 'how', 'differences', 'can', 'be', 'bridged', 'music', 'dancing', 'are', 'used', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'idea', 'Right', 'beginning', 'see', 'people', 'getting', 'ready', 'party', 'beat', 'different', 'music', 'hip', 'hop', 'side', 'ballade', 'other', 'differences', 'tumble', 'down', 'there', 'clothing', 'ambiance', 'world', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'world', 'high', 'school', 'party', 'dominated', 'hip', 'hop', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'farther', 'apart.The', 'two', 'worlds', 'collide', 'when', 'Jason', 'student', 'John', 'Drake', 'High', 'School', 'destroying', 'car', 'principal', 'school', 'Pierre', 'along', 'bike', 'bicycle', 'Jason', 'acts', 'next', 'day', 'Mr.', 'Dulaine', 'up', 'principals', 'office', 'chance', 'teach', 'kids', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'then', 'teach', 'lesson', 'try', 'plan', 'group', 'students', 'detention', 'Pierre', 'who', 'already', 'suspect', 'was', 'yearning', 'challenge', 'not', 'waver', 'purpose', 'disastrous', 'first', 'reunion', 'little', 'little', 'manages', 'reach', 'kids', 'show', 'can', 'dream', 'again.There', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'First', 'dancing', 'very', 'entertaining', 'uplifting', 'very', 'skilled', 'performers', 'was', 'mostly', 'impressed', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'who', 'outstanding', 'unconventional', 'tango', 'scene', 'Then', 'music', 'silky', 'love', 'songs', 'fashionable', 'catching', 'hip', 'hop', 'Finally', 'even', 'story', 'unoriginal', 'told', 'such', 'way', 'engaged', 'duration', 'Overall', 'movie', 'watching', 'enjoy', 'music', 'dance']",N/A

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[4, 5]","Cons: I'm dead tired of seeing movies about teachers from different backgrounds come to inner city schools and save the day with dance competitions and miraculously great hip hop dancers who turn into great dancers in other areas.  This movie has been done over and over again but there were some really strange scenes.  For example, the best dancer was not even highlighted until the end when she had the dance-off with two men (automatic elimination), people were arriving on the floor late, music was changed when in a real competition that would never happen, and how a bunch of kids managed to get in a private ballroom to practice, no clue.  Too many things were unrealistic for me to believe in this plot.Pros: I loved every minute of the rivalry between the sister and brother of the two deceased relatives on the principal's wall. Their constant bickering and snarling at each other made for great entertainment, although predictable, but cute nonetheless.  Personally, I wish the movie was just about those two and the dancing was left out.This movie was more like a comedy than a dance movie, but I'm always pleased to see Antonio Banderas in anything. I don't think he's ever not been cool in his whole life. Charisma oozes off of that guy.  I was also pleased to see how ""Moesha's brother"" has grown over the years. He turned out quite handsome.

Except for Banderas and Woodard who are stars in their own right and perform well here, this film is also dominated by a number of unknowns who are very convincing in their roles.  This film does not shy away from the tragedies some of these inner city youths experience everyday of their lives as we witness one girl nearly assualted by a ""customer"" of her prostitute mother and one boy who witnessed his brother's death and his father's descent into alcoholism.  None of these are pretty pictures and none of these problems are solved at the end of the film.In addition, a fair commentary is made about the way many view our education system both by the public and those in the system.  In this film that commentary is embodied in a math teacher who won't cover his after school detention time as he views those kids as losers not worthy of his time and he'd rather be teaching kids that care about what he has to say.  How sad that is.  I have been teaching for 16 years now and while I enjoy it, I don't do it because my ""audience"" cares.  Wow, that sounds like an awfully big ego trip to only want to teach to the elite of the school; I hate to admit that I know such teachers.  One thing I've learned in my time in education is that the moment students (any child) say that they don't need you, then that's when they need you the most.  Ironically, this very same teacher turns in the principal later for conducting the dance classes instead of trying to teach the students.  Hmmmm . . . Didn't he say they weren't worthy of being taught?EVERYONE is entitled to a good education, even those that don't know its value yet (heck, they're kids, right?).  We can't select who is worthy and throw out the rest.

The difference in ""Take the Lead"" is that Banderas is playing a real life man. No, wait. That isn't different. Okay, he is dealing with a diverse collection of students who have trouble at school. But we think it might just be a result of problems at home. Darn, that's old hat for this genre as well. Wait! I've got it. He teaches them to dance. That is pretty much the only difference in this new entry in a tried and tired genre. And don't even get me started on the whole `high-school coach inspires his students to reach for the brass ring"" sub-genre.I wonder if there is someone in Hollywood whose job is to determine ""Okay, I think we are going to make `Ballroom Dancing' the next big thing."" How else can we explain the sometimes inexplicable shifts in Hollywood? After years of absence, westerns became more predominant for a short period. Then musicals. I suspect we might see a few more films about two men in love, due to the recent success of a recently taboo subject in film.The 1995 Japanese film ""Shall We Dance?"" was an enjoyable look at a repressed businessman finding a little joy in his life as he took ballroom dance lessons, something very foreign to his culture. From the moment it hit multiplexes, the original Japanese version had Hollywood remake stamped all over it. Ten years later, the American version, starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon appeared. Perhaps a bit too early, because it flopped. Last year also saw a very popular documentary, ""Mad Hot Ballroom"", about elementary school kids in New York who compete in ballroom dancing competitions. Then ""Dancing with the Stars"" premiered on television. Its second season recently ended and the show is a bonafide hit giving D-List celebrities and soap stars (or are they the same thing?) a second chance at stardom. Now, in two weeks time, we have two different films with ballroom dancing at their core. Neither is very good, but for very different reasons. Perhaps, we are still waiting for THE film that will bring the dancing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers back to the limelight.If you are saying to yourself ""Hey, I read part of this in thornhill's review of `Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School' review"" you are very observant. Both films share a common theme and also a remarkably similar speech about the virtues of learning to ballroom dance.Pierre Dulaine (Antonio Banderas) runs a new dance studio in New York City. The studio has a devoted roster of exclusive students, but still struggles. Pierre rides his bike home one evening and witnesses a very angry student, Rock (Rob Brown) vandalizing the car of his high school principal. The next day, Pierre offers to help out at the high school. The principal (Alfre Woodard) can't find anyone to supervise Detention, so she figures Pierre is a good alternative. Naturally. On his first day, Pierre meets the `diverse' group of troubled students. They are a hip hop crowd and can't stand any of his traditional ballroom music. A couple of days later, Pierre asks a student to stop by and they dance the sensuous tango. Now that he has their attention, he can teach them all about life. Hooray.""Take The Lead"", directed by Liz Friedlander (who appears to have gotten her start in... wait for it... music videos) and based on the true life story of Pierre Dulaine, is made according to such a tried and true formula that if you are interested, you can certainly wait for the DVD.Banderas is earnest in his portrayal of this dancing teacher. He seems to want to help with the students and his method of reaching them is through dance. That's what he knows best. But we don't really get an idea of why. Why does he want to help out these high school kids? He doesn't have a kid in their class. What makes him think he can teach them ballroom dancing? Banderas has a funny scene when he first shows up at the high school. A student in trouble, sent to the principal's office, is amazed that Dulaine opens the door for every woman to leave the office. Of course, the women are touched by the courtesy. A moment later, when Dulaine is meeting with the Principal, we spot the student opening the door for girls. It's a funny moment. And there are some good moments in the film......The film opens with quick shots of two different groups preparing for two very different dances. We see shots of Banderas and his dance students getting ready for a formal dance, putting on their tuxedos and dresses, shining their shoes, putting on their cumber bunds. These are intercut with shots of the group of high school kids preparing for a school dance, putting on jeans, t-shirts, bling, making sure their jeans ride low, showing underwear. The music accompanying both changes in the middle, initially, we are listening to a more modern take on ballroom music and then it changes to a modern hip-hop. The action moves to the two dances and they couldn't be more different......To get the student's attention, Dulaine asks a student to come and perform the tango with him. He doesn't tell the students beforehand, as soon as Morgan, his dance student, arrives she captures their attention with her beauty and confidence. When they begin to perform the tango, they capture the attention of all the students, boys and girls alike...There are a few more moments like this. Perhaps the best moment is a tango performed during the final dance competition between three of the students in Dulaine's class. Yes, three of the students.But to get to these points, we have to sit through some of the most basic, overused stereotypes in `high school' films. Dulaine's students are a `wacky' cast of individual troublemakers. From the troubled, silent young man who secretly is trying to make a better life for himself (Rob Brown), to a hip-hop Asian student who finds himself irresistible to women, to the male Caucasian student with corn rolls in his hair, to the Caucasian girl, who attends Dulaine's Dance Academy, but feels more at home with the inner-city kids in his detention class. Can't a film like this contain some interesting, unusual characters? Something new? Instead, it always seems like the screenwriters of these films use a computer program to plug in these characters. Search ""Wacky"", ""Troubled"", ""High School"". See list. Add to screenplay.The dance scenes are fun, well-shot and full of energy, but they are few and far between. In an early scene with his detention students, Dulaine watches them start to do their more comfortable, more common hip hop dancing. He is amazed. But this doesn't really lead to anything such as a new form of ballroom dancing. At one point, they start to mix his ballroom music into a hip hope groove. Again, it doesn't really lead to anything. Instead of being innovative, creating new music or dance trends, the film piles on the stock characters, their familiar drama, and the sappy, Hollywood ending this type of project requires.It is disappointing that the filmmakers couldn't figure out a way to create a new fusion of dance. The film practically telegraphs that this is going to happen, yet it never does.I have had mixed luck with ""Sneak Previews"". On the one hand, you know that a studio would never hold a sneak preview for a film that they know is bad (they generally mark those by not allowing film critics to see them before opening day). If they are going to the trouble of a sneak preview, they want to build word of mouth, good word of mouth, so it seems like these films should be the cream of the crop. But they aren't. They are the films that Hollywood loves to make. Routine, mechanical and full of stock characters.",3,"""Lead"" Does Nothing But Follow",1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,8060,"['Jaime', 'Escalante', 'students', 'stand', 'deliver', 'truth', 'Oh', 'wait',

Moon ""Movie Buff""","[0, 1]","The way the movie starts out is introducing Pierre Dulaine and what he does for a living along with other characters who would basically be the center of attention in the film. Basically the film is based on what Pierre does for these kids and along the way he encounters what they listen to and the gap between his interests and what grabs the kids attention. Eventually the two cultures come together and it makes an interesting ending.Some points are lightly touched on like Pierre being widowed and never remarrying. Of course with this film being based on the life of Pierre Dulaine, there is going to be some creative differences because - its a movie not a documentary. The idea is to show how much of an impact what Mr. Dulaine does not just for the kids he is in charge of but what influence the lessons he teaches and demonstrates to the parents later on in the film but he also learns from the kids as well ultimately causing the merging of both his and the kids thoughts as to how to proced with the way they learn how not just to dance but to cooperate with each other.The main thing is about movies is this --- if you want to see it then go see it without having any expectations whatsoever.

If it isn't that, you wasted your money. This one here was, for reasons I'm still trying to figure out.As a dance-phobic I went to see this flick to do something nice for and with my wife. A Sunday evening with some light-hearted fare, taking a break from an overly hectic schedule of things-to-do. Also, I happen to like Antonio Banderas, who is on my list of 'leading men' type actors with depth; without taking themselves too preciously serious.Anyway, if 'emotional experience' is the measure of a movie's quality, this one deserves full marks. Whatever it was that made it, it worked. That it should be 'based on a true story'--a concept I've yet to come to grips with--is a nice bonus, but it would have worked quite without that. It was a classic example of 'nice', and not in an insipid, but an entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable manner.'Feel good'is probably an accurate description, but I, for one, don't mind; and neither, unsurprisingly, did my wife.Highly recommended for those--even dance-phobes like me--who just want to spend an enjoyable couple of hours.

996525,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FUTVLY,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","I had been recently disappointed with a string of Antonio Banderas' films such as so-so ""The Legend of Zorro"" and terrible ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,"" so I didn't expect much from ""Take the Lead"" before watching it. I thought this might be another disappointment. I was wrong. Antonio Banderas as ballroom dancer teaching dancing at inner-city high school is just fantastic, exactly the reason you should see this enjoyable film.Banderas plays real-life dancer Pierre Dulaine, whose life the film is very loosely based upon. After witnessing an angry high school student ""Rock"" (Rob Brown) smashing a car parked in the street one night, Pierre Dulaine volunteers to teach ballroom dancing to the students in detention hall. Principal of the school (Alfre Woodard) accepts his offer only because no one else wants the duty of watching over detention, and it doesn't cost anything financially.Like such films as ""Save the Last Dance"" or more recently ""Step Up"" (of which star Jenna Dewan can be seen here, doing great dance scenes), the storyline of ""Take the Lead"" itself is certainly predictable. The tough reality surrounding the students is suggested through several episodes, but ""Take the Lead"" quickly moves forward and as its title suggests, it wraps up with positive messages on life, and rousing dancing sequences. It may lack the edgy direction of Baz Luhrmann's ""Strictly Ballroom,"" but it is a charmer all the same. Perhaps one or two too many characters appear and Alfre Woodard's high school principle with realistic thinking could have been more fleshed out, but still everyone is given a moment to shine, especially the young cast doing great job as rebellious but likable students.There is a documentary film ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" dealing with the same material and it may help you understand what is really going on in these classes in reality (though this film is about elementary school students).
