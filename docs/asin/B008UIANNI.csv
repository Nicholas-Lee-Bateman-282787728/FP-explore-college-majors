Madigan,"[1, 1]","Mother Dolores has weighed her vocation over against a big big career in film and she has struggled to make her vocation her new career, not without pain and sacrifice.Her films really begin the journey to the convent; there's a aura about her in her work as an actress that tells you she will be the American Vanessa Redgrave. And in her life as Mother Dolores she is just that, but I won dr if she does not often pause and think, that maybe a few more years...??It's hard to write this and not say I miss those other films she might have made..a gift of acting that she had and still has is such a monumental phenomenon...Katharine Hepburn said once that she would rather die than not act. Many great stars have said as much.. Mother Dolores throws a wrench into these statements and yet I wish....If you have seen LISA you can tell it's all THERE&#62; She simply had to take up the next role and she would have had the Academy Award so many knew she would have had if she had remained in her art. And as a teacher of actresses and actors! What couldn't she have accomplished! She had Anna Magnani, Anthony Quinn, Monty Clift, Myrna Loy as her Masters..and what would we have NOW with someone like Dolores Hart as a tutor, and still acting of course!But what would Regina Laudis be without her presence? It is so difficult to choose, I would imagine. She, the niece of Mario Lanza! I think finally these contrasts give her such a big Identity now.

I was impressed by the terrific young cast none more than Dolores Hart.  She projected poise, intelligence, and beauty.  Naturally my young heart was smitten only to find out in a where-are-they-now segment that she later eschewed the glamour of Hollywood to become a Benedictine nun.  A few years ago ""Entertainment Weekly"" did a profile on Mother Dolores in which she made it very clear that she made the right decision.  The story was insightful and portrayed a woman who was not only worldly but at peace with herself.  The beginning of ""God Is The Bigger Elvis"" pretty much follows the trajectory of the EW story.  About midway through the film Mother Dolores cedes the spotlight to her fellow sisters and their stories are just as compelling including a nun who is a recovering alcoholic and a young novice struggling with her vocation.  The only thing you can fault this film for is brevity.  It runs about thirty-five minutes.

1576381,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B008UIANNI,Jack E. Levic,"[11, 11]","GOD IS THE BIGGER ELVIS leaves us wanting more about the story of actress Dolores Hart and her 50 years as a nun. I have heard a lot about Dolores Hart through the years--the beautiful Hollywood starlet who left it all behind to join a convent in Connecticut. She gave up Hollywood to serve God and appears to have no regrets. GOD IS THE BIGGER ELVIS is a lovely documentary that brings Dolores Hart back to the screen. Aging and frail but full of life, Dolores Hart and her bright blue eyes light up the screen. She never talks about regrest but it seems like her life as a nun was her destiny and she never seems to look back with regret.Here is the real story of her choice. Other nuns are interviewed about the lives they left and there new life in the convent. It is a remarkable decision to give up so much but to hopefully gain a spiritual peace few of us experience. Mother Dolores mentions the need for hope and says, If you can find hope, you might find faith."" Her gentle soul is an inspiration.There is a bittersweet aspect to this story. Dolores Hart was engaged to be married when she told her fiance that she was entering the convent. Don Robinson never left the woman he loved for the rest of his life and regularly visited Dolores in the the convent. He dated but never married and clearly says he never got over Dolores nor did his love lesson. There is a touching scene where he visits her and as he turns to leave, they share a brief kiss on the lips and a hug. He turns to walk away and we see Dolores with tears in her eyes and she makes the sign of the cross. Sadly, Robinson died a few months later, so I wonder if in her heart, she knew his life was fading.Here we have a sweet and inspiring story of an actress who was the toast of Hollywood and left it all behind. GOD IS THE BIGGER ELVIS has one major flaw...it's too short.

1576382,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B008UIANNI,Kevin Killian,"[3, 5]","Twas not merely by reference to Swinburne that Dolores Hart became an obsession among postwar moviegoers in the last gasp of the studio system circa 1960, but the combined efforts of men like Jerry Wald, Hal Wallis, Colonel Tom Parker--the producers who discovered her and cast her in a series of Technicolor entertainments during the height of the Cold War.  She was young, but poised beyond her years.  Was there anything she couldn't do?  She never played a mother; she was always the ing&eacute;nue, though sometimes the older of two sisters--the maturity leaking through.  She had a fresh all-American look to her, though more knowing and intellectual perhaps than peers like Sandra Dee or Tuesday Weld.  And she had that Catholic thing going on, which moviegoers linked to a previous movie soubrette lost to actual real life royalty, Grace Kelly.  Dolores Hart could play in drama, in comedy, even in beach party movies, and she held her own against some of the greatest talents they threw at her.  Looking at Wild is the Wind today, it's pretty clear that she is a better actress than the infinitely more authentic Anna Magnani, but is some of this perception only hindsight in action?  Does leaving show business for a cloister confer smarts on a starlet?  I think so, if you can make it stick, and if you have a sense of humor, and apparently Mother Dolores of the convent of Regina Laudis has humor for days.I saw her at the Oscars last year, when this movie failed unaccountably to win the category it had been nominated for.  There she was, hardly a bit of makeup on her face, still that co-ed swagger, moving down the red carpet with ease.  I don't know much about cloisters, so I wonder how does the Mother Superior get time off to go to the Oscars, unless the documentary in question is viewed as a fundraising effort to make more people give more money to the cloister, but still!  The movie has three aims, just like Black Narcissus, or In This House of Brede.  One is for you to gasp at how brutalist the architecture is where these nuns must spend their lives, and two, to show how glamorous they were before marrying Christ (not only did the order nab Dolores Hart but the film also shows us a sort of Debbie Harry wild child shrugging off a life of drug and club addiction to go straight for Jesus), and three, to present the convent as the worst experience a human being could ever get herself into--I have no idea why this angle is played up so much, but several of the subjects seem completely on edge--it's like Warhol's Chelsea Girls, but much shorter (under 4 minutes) and projected onto only one screen.In the second half, a tender love story is developed.  Seems that when Dolores Hart entered the convent in 1963, she left behind a man, an architect, who never forgot her.  They were engaged and when she took the vows it broke his heart and he never married.  The filmmakers arrange a reunion scene between them that will have you grabbing for your Kleenex, or the cowl of your robe, if ever you had a ""Hart.""",5,"""We are fain of thee still, we are fain, O sanguine and subtle Dolores""",1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,3040,"['Twas', 'not', 'merely', 'reference', 'Swinburne', 'Hart', 'became', 'obsession', 'postwar', 'moviegoers', 'last', 'gasp', 'studio', 'system', 'circa', '1960', 'combined', 'efforts', 'men', 'Jerry', 'Wald', 'Hal', 'Wallis', 'Colonel', 'Tom', 'Parker', 'producers', 'who', 'discovered', 'cast', 'series', 'Technicolor', 'entertainments', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'was', 'young', 'poised', 'years', 'Was', 'anything', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'never', 'played', 'mother', 'was', 'always', 'ing', 'eacute', 'sometimes', 'older', 'two', 'sisters', 'maturity', 'leaking', 'had', 'fresh', 'all-American', 'look', 'more', 'knowing', 'intellectual', 'perhaps', 'peers', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'had', 'Catholic', 'thing', 'going', 'linked', 'previous', 'movie', 'soubrette', 'lost', 'actual', 'real', 'life', 'royalty', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'could', 'play', 'drama', 'comedy', 'even', 'beach', 'party', 'movies', 'held', 'own', 'greatest', 'talents', 'threw', 'Looking', 'Wild', 'Wind', 'today', 'pretty', 'clear', 'better', 'actress', 'infinitely', 'more', 'authentic', 'Anna', 'Magnani', 'perception', 'only', 'hindsight', 'action', 'leaving', 'show', 'business', 'cloister', 'confer', 'starlet', 'think', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'stick', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'apparently', 'Mother', 'Dolores', 'convent', 'Regina', 'Laudis', 'humor', 'days.I', 'saw', 'Oscars', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'movie', 'failed', 'unaccountably', 'win', 'category', 'had', 'been', 'nominated', 'was', 'hardly', 'bit', 'makeup', 'face', 'still', 'co-ed', 'swagger', 'moving', 'down', 'red', 'carpet', 'ease', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'cloisters', 'wonder', 'how', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'get', 'time', 'go', 'Oscars', 'documentary', 'question', 'viewed', 'fundraising', 'effort', 'make', 'more', 'people', 'give', 'more', 'money', 'cloister', 'still', 'movie', 'three', 'aims', 'just', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'House', 'Brede', 'One', 'gasp', 'how', 'brutalist', 'architecture', 'where', 'nuns', 'must', 'spend', 'lives', 'two', 'show', 'how', 'glamorous', 'were', 'marrying', 'Christ', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'order', 'nab', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'film', 'also', 'sort', 'Debbie', 'Harry', 'wild', 'child', 'shrugging', 'off', 'life', 'drug', 'club', 'addiction', 'go', 'straight', 'Jesus', 'three', 'present', 'convent', 'worst', 'experience', 'human', 'being', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'angle', 'played', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'several', 'subjects', 'seem', 'completely', 'edge', 'Warhol', 'Chelsea', 'Girls', 'much', 'shorter', '4', 'minutes', 'projected', 'only', 'one', 'screen.In', 'second', 'half', 'tender', 'love', 'story', 'developed', 'when', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'entered', 'convent', '1963', 'left', 'behind', 'man', 'architect', 'who', 'never', 'forgot', 'were', 'engaged', 'when', 'took', 'vows', 'broke', 'heart', 'never', 'married', 'filmmakers', 'arrange', 'reunion', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'grabbing', 'Kleenex', 'cowl', 'robe', 'ever', 'had', 'Hart']",God is the Bigger Elvis

It also interested me as I was starting to consider a vocation to a sisterhood myself.About two years ago, Mother Dolores was in town for a special play production that was inspired by her, and it was performed at our church auditorium.  She remained afterward generously answering all our questions, and even remained a bit more to talk to everyone as we left.  This video really captures her personality, her warmth, her sense of humor, and if anyone is discerning a vocation to the religious life, may provide insight.  For those not all that familiar with Catholic or religious vocations, will also help answer the ""why"" and what exactly a religious order does.While in the end I discerned that I wasn't called to religious life, this video (along with Audrey Hepburn's ""Nun's  Story"") showed what could have been if I had pursued it.

1576388,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B008UIANNI,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[1, 1]","Dolores Hart, a classic Hollywood beauty who starred alongside Elvis Presley and other big stars, shocked the Hollywood establishment when she chose to become a cloistered Benedictine nun in the 1950s. Since then, she has been largely forgotten by the public, only popping up now and then through her written correspondence and the &#34;Where Are They Now&#34; section of tabloid news. This beautiful, delightful, and surprising half-hour HBO special tells her life story and shows us the consequences of her choice 60 years later. Now Mother Prioress of the abbey, Hart reveals the tremendous peace and joy she has discovered in the abbey, with just a hint of sadness over the fiancee she left (and who still remains friends with her today) to join religious life. The film also gives us a history of her Hollywood career, with clips and photos, and interviews with industry veterans about her decision. It also features interviews with some of the other nuns and a look at their daily life. For an American viewing audience, this little documentary is the best you will find on contemplative religious life as a cloistered nun, as it is a truly outstanding and moving little film. Production values and everything else is extremely high, as one would expect from an HBO special produced for cable television. Forget about all of the &#34;Into Great Silence&#34; documentaries on cloistered nuns and all of the church-produced documentaries out there: This film beats them all. Unlike those other films, it is never dull or boring, breezing along at a fast pace with great level of detail in a very short running time. It also features a truly remarkable, heroic, and charismatic star in Dolores Hart.
