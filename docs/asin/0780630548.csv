Danny Glovers film Freedom Song, shows the turmoil within the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee(&quot;snick&quot;)as well as the overwhelming odds without. The general public know Dr. Martin Luther King, but little about anything else. Truth be known, Dr King would have failed without the concerted efforts of the other groups such as SNCC. It was good to see the diversity of youth the way it really was. What a positive thing for our children of all races to see, how when you believe in something the price is very high, but attainable.",5,More than just Civil Rights,984960000,"03 19, 2001",2001,742,"['Civil', 'Rights', 'may', 'be', 'cliche', 'not', 'enough', 'interesting', 'information', 'there', 'captures', 'ones', 'attention', 'feeling', 'sad', 'couple', 'days', 'lasting', 'effect', 'Danny', 'Glovers', 'film', 'Freedom', 'Song', 'turmoil', 'Student', 'Non-Violent', 'Coordinating', 'Committee', 'quot', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'general', 'public', 'know', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'little', 'anything', 'else', 'Truth', 'be', 'known', 'Dr', 'King', 'would', 'have', 'failed', 'concerted', 'efforts', 'other', 'groups', 'such', 'SNCC', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'diversity', 'youth', 'way', 'really', 'was', 'What', 'positive', 'thing', 'children', 'races', 'see', 'how', 'when', 'believe', 'something', 'price', 'very', 'high', 'attainable']",Freedom Song VHS

Danny Glovers' son could not understand why his Dad appeared to be a coward, not understanding as a young boy in that Era that this was the way it was, not saying that this iwas a correct way of thinking, it certainly was not, but  his dad was looking out for his sons' well being as we'll as his own.

37418,AH39OFADI4W11,0780630548,Granten Lee,"[0, 0]","On Memorial Day 2006, I was at my Church for our special holiday service.  I was assigned to help with passing out communion and the offering plate.  After the ushers serve, we pray and take communion ourselves.  One of the gentlemen prayed in thanks for those who served, fought and died in wars so that Americans could maintain life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Too bad he had nothing to say about those who fought the battle for the Civil Rights Movement.  Blacks have fought in this country's wars since 1775, but soldiers who came home from WWII and Korea were still denied even the most basic freedoms- to live the lives they wanted to live.  The Civil Rights movement really was the last battle of the American Revolution.Freedom Song is an outstanding film and is as important a movie as Saving Private Ryan or Flags of our Fathers.  It represents the events that made it possible for people like me- I'm African-American- to even go see SPR and Flags in any theatre I want and sit wherever I choose.  In one of the other reviews, a teacher mentioned he shows this film to his students.  God bless him.  If we forget the sacrifices of those who came before us- the civil rights crusaders or the soldiers of our country's wars- we forget who we are and what we stand for- a nation ""conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.""",5,Freedom Is Never Free,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,1386,"['Memorial', 'Day', '2006', 'was', 'Church', 'special', 'holiday', 'service', 'was', 'assigned', 'help', 'passing', 'out', 'communion', 'offering', 'plate', 'ushers', 'serve', 'pray', 'take', 'communion', 'One', 'gentlemen', 'prayed', 'thanks', 'who', 'served', 'fought', 'died', 'wars', 'Americans', 'could', 'maintain', 'life', 'liberty', 'pursuit', 'happiness', 'Too', 'bad', 'had', 'nothing', 'say', 'who', 'fought', 'battle', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'Blacks', 'have', 'fought', 'country', 'wars', '1775', 'soldiers', 'who', 'came', 'home', 'WWII', 'Korea', 'were', 'still', 'denied', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'freedoms-', 'live', 'lives', 'wanted', 'live', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'really', 'was', 'last', 'battle', 'American', 'Revolution.Freedom', 'Song', 'outstanding', 'film', 'as', 'important', 'movie', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'events', 'made', 'possible', 'people', 'me-', ""'m"", 'African-American-', 'even', 'go', 'see', 'SPR', 'Flags', 'theatre', 'want', 'sit', 'wherever', 'choose', 'one', 'other', 'reviews', 'teacher', 'mentioned', 'film', 'students', 'God', 'bless', 'forget', 'sacrifices', 'who', 'came', 'us-', 'civil', 'rights', 'crusaders', 'soldiers', 'country', 'wars-', 'forget', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'stand', 'for-', 'nation', 'conceived', 'Liberty', 'dedicated', 'proposition', 'men', 'are', 'created', 'equal']",Freedom Song VHS
