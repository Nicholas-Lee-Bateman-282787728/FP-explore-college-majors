But I am really mad about the packaging they have for this season.For this season I like the cover much better than the head one. This will probably be out of print in a few months like the others that made two different covers. I do wish however that there were more episodes like 25. I also like that it has a lot of Easter eggs and deleted scenes.The show is still funny and I still do like the show.

1049544,A1KBT3D1O0LA7L,B000MR8W8I,A. White,"[0, 0]","For years I told myself I was going to stop collecting the box sets after season nine, because I felt the later seasons were fairly hit or miss. Not long ago I received season 10 as a gift, and while there's certainly some great episodes in 10 I figured if those were combined with the greats of 11 it would make a pretty good season. So that's how I rationalize this purchase I suppose.The episodes of season 11 often get confused with other seasons, but most fans could immediately guess that it takes place after season 9. There are some classic eps here, and some easily forgettable ones as well. Unfortunately, the season felt a bit misbalanced to me with the good early in the season and bad at the end. All this is subjective of course, but I probably won't be watching the forth disc of this box set again; something I couldn't say about any of the other seasons. Also, there's a very definable shift this season in how the jokes are presented; instead of the witty, satirical humor that has been the Simpsons' MO since day one it has began to rely more on the random, off the wall humor that Family Guy has always displayed. I don't make that comparison as an insult to FG, it's just not the Simpsons style.Another area about this collection that has drawn a lot of well-deserved criticism is the packaging. Gone are the plastic pages that usually secure the discs quite well in lieu of accordion-style sleeves that the discs must be pulled out of, increasing the risk of damage and lowering convenience. While it makes more room for Simpsons-related images, and is probably cheaper to make without lowering purchase price, but the practicality and logic of this change is non-existent, aside from the likelihood of increased profits. I daresay that the packaging choice of this season is the main reason it has a lower rating of its pre and post seasons.Aside from the lower quality of episodes and packaging, season 11 will still bring in the laughs, and I don't think it possible for me not to recommend the Simpsons.",4,"Decent start, meh finish",1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,2029,"['years', 'told', 'was', 'going', 'stop', 'collecting', 'box', 'sets', 'season', 'nine', 'felt', 'later', 'seasons', 'were', 'fairly', 'hit', 'miss', 'Not', 'long', 'ago', 'received', 'season', '10', 'gift', 'certainly', 'great', 'episodes', '10', 'figured', 'were', 'combined', 'greats', '11', 'would', 'make', 'pretty', 'good', 'season', 'how', 'rationalize', 'purchase', 'suppose.The', 'episodes', 'season', '11', 'often', 'get', 'confused', 'other', 'seasons', 'most', 'fans', 'could', 'immediately', 'guess', 'place', 'season', '9', 'are', 'classic', 'eps', 'here', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'season', 'felt', 'bit', 'misbalanced', 'good', 'early', 'season', 'bad', 'end', 'subjective', 'course', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'forth', 'disc', 'box', 'set', 'again', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'other', 'seasons', 'Also', 'very', 'definable', 'shift', 'season', 'how', 'jokes', 'are', 'presented', 'instead', 'witty', 'satirical', 'humor', 'been', 'Simpsons', 'MO', 'day', 'one', 'began', 'rely', 'more', 'random', 'wall', 'humor', 'Family', 'Guy', 'always', 'displayed', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'comparison', 'insult', 'FG', 'just', 'not', 'Simpsons', 'style.Another', 'area', 'collection', 'drawn', 'lot', 'well-deserved', 'criticism', 'packaging', 'Gone', 'are', 'plastic', 'pages', 'usually', 'secure', 'discs', 'quite', 'well', 'lieu', 'accordion-style', 'sleeves', 'discs', 'must', 'be', 'pulled', 'increasing', 'risk', 'damage', 'lowering', 'convenience', 'more', 'room', 'Simpsons-related', 'images', 'probably', 'cheaper', 'make', 'lowering', 'purchase', 'price', 'practicality', 'logic', 'change', 'non-existent', 'aside', 'likelihood', 'increased', 'profits', 'daresay', 'packaging', 'choice', 'season', 'main', 'reason', 'lower', 'rating', 'pre', 'post', 'seasons.Aside', 'lower', 'quality', 'episodes', 'packaging', 'season', '11', 'will', 'still', 'bring', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'not', 'recommend', 'Simpsons']",N/A

But here's a warning:  the packaging is the cheapest, most poorly designed, pain-in-the-a$$ packaging ever thrown together for a dvd release.  Folks, it's just awful.  First you have the co-called ""collectible"" head case, which is made of thin, cheap plastic which scuffs amazingly easily.  Also, because of the weird shape and size, it is impossible to stack on your shelves with your other dvd's.  I have steadfastly avoided these awful head case packages since Fox has been producing them.But the really awful thing, which is a consistent factor with both the head case and the traditional case, is the terrible design.  No plastic spindles to keep your discs separate and secure... no, here they are jammed, tightly, into an awful foldout cardboard sleeve.  So tightly are they packed in there that trying to slip your finger into the sleeve to retrieve the disc  without tearing, bending, or otherwise breaking the package is virtually impossible.  What's worse is that the backing in these sleeves is not smooth and slick, it is instead rough and fibrous and is guaranteed to scratch the discs all to hell.  Even the outside slipcase is cheaply made, bending and crinkling with no more than a withering glance.  You should probably stay away and rent it from Netflix.And with this terrible downgrade in the quality of the packaging, you might expect a lower price.  HA!  Not a chance!  To the nitwits at Fox, we Simpsons fans have supported you for 20 whole years, and this is the best you can do for us?  You need to start having a little respect for the fans who shell out their hard-earned money for your products.I'd love to give the set five stars, but with this poorly designed, bound to fail, cheap-a$$ packaging I can only manage two.

1049546,A3H0LDBQ5G3ANL,B000MR8W8I,"Brian Moore ""kibogami""","[12, 17]","The main plot elements for this season are of varying degrees of quality but the sub-plots seem randomly generated at best.The transitional elements of the story also suffer heavily in this season. That which was once, in my opinion, one of the best parts of the Simpsons now appears a tacked on afterthought, seemingly necessary only as an attempted segue to the action.I feel that this season, above all others, really cements the ""modern"" era of the Simpsons. It amazes how the show changed so much from the 9th season to this one. A change that has lasted 10 years. To me it is nearly two different shows. A cartoon that was never conventionally ""cartoonish"" that became a parody of itself.The good news is that every now and then a gag or sometimes entire episode gives you that same feeling that we enjoyed for the first 9 1/2 years.Case in point, one word: Tomacco!The Halloween episode for this season is one of the real standouts, better than some of the last few years offerings. A lot of fun, especially the Y2K vignetteThe only entire episode that strikes me as being close to the Simpsons of years past is Little Big Mom. Lisa finds herself running the household while Marge recovers from a skiing accident. The set up is entertaining and funny, the story an enjoyable ride with a fantastic payoff.Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder is another one that has it's moments, with Homer and Maggie attempting to bond (particularly the end when the 300 balloon drops again).About half of the Missionary:Impossible episode seems like familiar territory (in the good way) when Homer asks Jebus for help , we all added another phrase to our personal Simpson's lexicon. Of course ""Tappa Tappa Tappa"" found it's way in there too courtesy of the ""Last Tap Dance in Springfield"" starring Lisa as the little girl with two left feet who is inspired by a movie to try to learn tap from a Shirley Temple-esque character.The episodes that make me cringe are numerous,including Saddlesore Galactica (the jockeys chasing Homer towards the end literally caused me to throw up my hands in disgust. Even Comic Book Guy's constant observations about how this was ""the worst episode ever"" didn't strike me as being particularly funny or even ironic. It was one of the worst ever, and I don't think it is irreverent to try to make a gag of it, just stupid.Take my Wife Sleaze (with John Goodman as a biker) The Mansion Family with Homer in charge of Burns Manor, Faith Off with Bart as a faith Healer, and the horrible alligator episode are just a few more for the less-than-memorable pile.The debate of why the writers couldn't be a little more consistent this season I will leave to the hardcore Simpson fans who know the writers, history , etc. better than I.All in all a very uneven season that continues the trend of fewer and fewer stand out gags, plots and episodes. I may have to borrow this season from one of my more dedicated friends to watch the handful of episodes that I am interested in.",3,reaching,1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,2981,"['main', 'plot', 'elements', 'season', 'are', 'varying', 'degrees', 'quality', 'sub-plots', 'seem', 'randomly', 'generated', 'best.The', 'transitional', 'elements', 'story', 'also', 'suffer', 'heavily', 'season', 'was', 'once', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'Simpsons', 'now', 'tacked', 'afterthought', 'seemingly', 'necessary', 'only', 'attempted', 'segue', 'action.I', 'feel', 'season', 'others', 'really', 'modern', 'era', 'Simpsons', 'how', 'show', 'changed', 'so', 'much', '9th', 'season', 'one', 'change', 'lasted', '10', 'years', 'nearly', 'two', 'different', 'shows', 'cartoon', 'was', 'never', 'conventionally', 'cartoonish', 'became', 'parody', 'itself.The', 'good', 'news', 'now', 'then', 'gag', 'sometimes', 'entire', 'episode', 'same', 'feeling', 'enjoyed', 'first', '9', '1/2', 'years.Case', 'point', 'one', 'word', 'Tomacco', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'real', 'standouts', 'better', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'offerings', 'lot', 'fun', 'especially', 'Y2K', 'vignetteThe', 'only', 'entire', 'episode', 'being', 'close', 'Simpsons', 'years', 'past', 'Little', 'Big', 'Mom', 'Lisa', 'running', 'household', 'Marge', 'recovers', 'skiing', 'accident', 'set', 'up', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'fantastic', 'payoff.Hello', 'Gutter', 'Hello', 'Fadder', 'one', 'moments', 'Homer', 'Maggie', 'attempting', 'bond', 'particularly', 'end', 'when', '300', 'balloon', 'drops', 'again', 'half', 'Missionary', 'Impossible', 'episode', 'familiar', 'territory', 'good', 'way', 'when', 'Homer', 'Jebus', 'help', 'added', 'phrase', 'personal', 'Simpson', 'lexicon', 'course', 'Tappa', 'Tappa', 'Tappa', 'found', 'way', 'there', 'too', 'courtesy', 'Last', 'Tap', 'Dance', 'Springfield', 'starring', 'Lisa', 'little', 'girl', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'who', 'inspired', 'movie', 'try', 'learn', 'tap', 'Shirley', 'Temple-esque', 'character.The', 'episodes', 'make', 'cringe', 'are', 'numerous', 'including', 'Saddlesore', 'Galactica', 'jockeys', 'chasing', 'Homer', 'end', 'literally', 'caused', 'throw', 'up', 'hands', 'disgust', 'Even', 'Comic', 'Book', 'Guy', 'constant', 'observations', 'how', 'was', 'worst', 'episode', 'ever', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'being', 'particularly', 'funny', 'even', 'ironic', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'irreverent', 'try', 'make', 'gag', 'just', 'stupid.Take', 'Wife', 'Sleaze', 'John', 'Goodman', 'biker', 'Mansion', 'Family', 'Homer', 'charge', 'Burns', 'Manor', 'Faith', 'Off', 'Bart', 'faith', 'Healer', 'horrible', 'alligator', 'episode', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'more', 'less-than-memorable', 'pile.The', 'debate', 'why', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'little', 'more', 'consistent', 'season', 'will', 'leave', 'hardcore', 'Simpson', 'fans', 'who', 'know', 'writers', 'history', 'etc', 'better', 'I.All', 'very', 'uneven', 'season', 'trend', 'fewer', 'fewer', 'stand', 'gags', 'plots', 'episodes', 'may', 'have', 'borrow', 'season', 'one', 'more', 'dedicated', 'friends', 'watch', 'handful', 'episodes', 'am', 'interested']",N/A

'Eight Misbehavin'' when Apu and his wife give birth to the octuplets is a close second.

None of my discs were scratched or skipped.

With this season you get some of the greatest episodes, including one of my personal favorites, ""Behind the Laughter"". Of course you also get some wonderful commentaries, which are always entertaining, and the usual raft of extras. All in all, a great set, with one notable exception.The packaging bites. Totally bites.The producers of ""The Simpsons"" and ""Futurama"" seem to have got it into their heads that making ""green"" packaging for their DVD's is somehow better. This is also seen with movies such as ""There Will Be Blood"". Basically what it boils down to is ""cheap, cardboard packaging that is almost guaranteed to damage your DVD's when you remove them.""The packaging for this season of ""The Simpsons"" is particularly notable for this failing. The disks are jammed inside tight cardboard sleeves. When you remove them, you're almost going to have to grip them by the top and bottom, promising tons of fingerprints. Unless you're very careful, you're also likely to scratch them.I understand the idea of wanting to not fill up our landfills with tons of plastic, but really, people.

I had already gotten over it!My experiences weren't good with this DVD set at all..At first..I didnt get the DVD edition I wanted. I had been collecting the heads, so when I got the edition with no head...it pissed me off because it looked nothing like my previous DVD sets, and to a DVD perfectionist like me...it annoyed me!THEN came the horrendous packaging..OK I get they dont want to use plastic...but it is so hard to get the discs out...it damages the disc!The art is fantastic, but I wish the executed the packaging a little better. I wish I could teach them a lesson or two so us Simpsons fans can get the packaging we deserve for putting up with their drastic packaging decisions over the past 5 years!!THEN came the episodes, they were just..not that funny. Honestly, I would put The Simpsons glory years at Seasons 3-9...10 if I was being really kind.However, with that being said..the last episoe 'Behind The Laughter' was GREAT! It is worth the whole set in my eyes! One of the most creative episodes in their history, in my honest opinion..its a shame it was the last episode on the disc!The extras are great, with all the commentaries..but if you arent a big commentaries fan..then theres not much else. Kind of disappointing, but the commentaries are a good enough extra.So overall, I was disappointed in the declining quality of this seasons episodes.

1049552,A32BHDDDOLQUR8,B000MR8W8I,CJ,"[3, 3]","Yes folks, the somewhat controversial season eleven of the simpsons, made more controversial by lousy packaging... but, moving on...This season does have some real winners and real stinkers in my opinion.  As those who have gotten this far probably know, this show runner (some of season nine and 10-12) knows how to do zany craziness, but lacks some of richer show structure.  For example, in some earlier seasons, there was a story A and a story B and both seemed complete even in about 23 minutes.  In even some of the better episodes, there is a strong story A with a filler B, or even worse, an iffy story A with a bunch of completely random jokes, some of them not that funny.  There is no wonder that some of the stronger episodes in this season have to deal with things like ADD, and attempts at sentimentality fall short of previous season tries.  Granted, there are a lot of laughs and a few awesome episodes, but if you are looking for the complexities of previous seasons, look elsewhere.Remember at this point you are dealing with about the third generation of writers and Groening was basically off doing Futurama (taking some people with him).  There are rehashed visits to previous original ideas (Grandpa's farm) and there are a couple of episodes of iffy huge changes (Maude Flanders, Barney sobers up).  A couple of celebrity visits are simply awful.Still funny, but I would look at other seasons first.  If you don't care for the really early stuff, try seasons eight or nine, especially for gifts for casual fans.  Or try a halloween disc for the really casual people.",4,Season Eleven - Different than Season Four,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,1589,"['Yes', 'folks', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'season', 'eleven', 'simpsons', 'made', 'more', 'controversial', 'lousy', 'packaging', 'moving', 'season', 'have', 'real', 'winners', 'real', 'stinkers', 'opinion', 'who', 'have', 'gotten', 'far', 'probably', 'know', 'show', 'runner', 'season', 'nine', '10-12', 'how', 'do', 'zany', 'craziness', 'richer', 'show', 'structure', 'example', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'was', 'story', 'A', 'story', 'B', 'seemed', 'complete', 'even', 'about', '23', 'minutes', 'even', 'better', 'episodes', 'strong', 'story', 'A', 'filler', 'B', 'even', 'worse', 'iffy', 'story', 'A', 'bunch', 'completely', 'random', 'jokes', 'not', 'funny', 'wonder', 'stronger', 'episodes', 'season', 'have', 'deal', 'things', 'ADD', 'attempts', 'sentimentality', 'fall', 'short', 'previous', 'season', 'tries', 'Granted', 'are', 'lot', 'laughs', 'few', 'awesome', 'episodes', 'are', 'looking', 'complexities', 'previous', 'seasons', 'look', 'elsewhere.Remember', 'point', 'are', 'dealing', 'third', 'generation', 'writers', 'Groening', 'was', 'basically', 'off', 'doing', 'Futurama', 'taking', 'people', 'are', 'rehashed', 'visits', 'previous', 'original', 'ideas', 'Grandpa', 'farm', 'are', 'couple', 'episodes', 'iffy', 'huge', 'changes', 'Maude', 'Flanders', 'Barney', 'up', 'couple', 'celebrity', 'visits', 'are', 'simply', 'awful.Still', 'funny', 'would', 'look', 'other', 'seasons', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'really', 'early', 'stuff', 'try', 'seasons', 'eight', 'nine', 'especially', 'gifts', 'casual', 'fans', 'try', 'halloween', 'disc', 'really', 'casual', 'people']",N/A
1049553,A8YSA65M8ILK2,B000MR8W8I,"cobaltspectre ""Water Rabbit""","[2, 2]","I love the Simpsons, and this season is on par with any of the recent outings... some episodes shine a bit brighter than others, but, despite knowing each episode virtually by heart (thanks to thrice daily airings on my local Fox affiliate), I'll always seek to own each season I can.  But, what galls me (and, obviously, quite a few others) is the new packaging.  I ordered every available season when Amazon was temporarily pricing them all well below their usual price, and I scooped them all up in whatever form they were available at that time.  This yielded mostly ordinary cardboard boxes, one ""collectible"" Homer head box, and this maddening Season 11 accordion featuring graphics of a circus sideshow appropriate to the implied challenge of getting the discs out of the packaging without damaging either the packaging or the discs.  Should I succeed, I will store the discs in low-profile plastic cases and leave the decorated accordian as a ""collectable.""  Obviously, I'll opt to preserve the discs over the packaging... I'm hoping it will be possible to do both.  I have not had a chance to examine the interior of a Krusty head ""collectable"" box; but, if it is like the Homer head box, I recommend it over this packaging debacle.  If, however, they merely cram this infernal accordian into a plastic head, I would strongly urge against it.  The Homer head set does not easily store well with any other DVD sets... it could be slightly deformed by crushing, cannot be stacked (except on top), and is generally inefficient in its use of space.  It has no more and no less than any of the other sets that came in ordinary boxes; so, I leave it to someone who wound up with one of the novelty Krusty head packages to inform us whether that packaging option afforded easier access to the discs, themselves, than the ""ordinary"" cardboard packaging option afforded us who did not get the novelty head.  If the novelty head allowed you to avoid the headaches of the escape-proof DVD prison cells for essentially the same price, jump on it!  If, however, you get this awful accordion-of-no-return disc prison, same as the rest of us, but in a plastic case shaped like Krusty's head inside a clear plastic loop, I suspect that you'll regret buying it that way.P.S.  I ultimately removed the discs without subjecting them to the oil of my fingerprints by using a length of thin, rubber tubing such as would be used to administer a blood test.  Without much expanding the cavity containing the disc, the flattened tubing slid over the printed side of the disc, and, with a finger pressing against that, and a tiny bit of tubing pinched between my thumb and the data edge of a disk, I extracted it and its brothers from their accordion prison without inflicting damage to them, myself.  I suspect that surgical gloves could have accomplished the same thing (if one has access to those).  No responsible collector would repeatedly subject their valued DVD's to that tight wood pulp abrasion press, so mine are now in the low-profile DVD cases I use to store all my DVD's that come packaged in a way that could eventually damage them.",2,Defeat the Packaging & Win a Prize!,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,3131,"['love', 'Simpsons', 'season', 'par', 'recent', 'outings', 'episodes', 'shine', 'bit', 'brighter', 'others', 'knowing', 'episode', 'virtually', 'heart', 'thanks', 'thrice', 'daily', 'airings', 'local', 'Fox', 'affiliate', ""'ll"", 'always', 'seek', 'own', 'season', 'can', 'what', 'obviously', 'quite', 'few', 'others', 'new', 'packaging', 'ordered', 'available', 'season', 'when', 'Amazon', 'was', 'temporarily', 'pricing', 'well', 'usual', 'price', 'scooped', 'up', 'form', 'were', 'available', 'time', 'yielded', 'mostly', 'ordinary', 'cardboard', 'boxes', 'one', 'collectible', 'Homer', 'head', 'box', 'maddening', 'Season', '11', 'accordion', 'featuring', 'graphics', 'circus', 'sideshow', 'appropriate', 'implied', 'challenge', 'getting', 'discs', 'packaging', 'damaging', 'packaging', 'discs', 'Should', 'succeed', 'will', 'store', 'discs', 'low-profile', 'plastic', 'cases', 'leave', 'decorated', 'accordian', 'collectable', 'Obviously', ""'ll"", 'opt', 'preserve', 'discs', 'packaging', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'possible', 'do', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'chance', 'examine', 'interior', 'Krusty', 'head', 'collectable', 'box', 'Homer', 'head', 'box', 'recommend', 'packaging', 'debacle', 'however', 'merely', 'cram', 'infernal', 'accordian', 'plastic', 'head', 'would', 'strongly', 'urge', 'Homer', 'head', 'set', 'not', 'easily', 'store', 'well', 'other', 'DVD', 'sets', 'could', 'be', 'slightly', 'deformed', 'crushing', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'stacked', 'top', 'generally', 'inefficient', 'use', 'space', 'more', 'less', 'other', 'sets', 'came', 'ordinary', 'boxes', 'so', 'leave', 'someone', 'who', 'wound', 'up', 'one', 'novelty', 'Krusty', 'head', 'packages', 'inform', 'packaging', 'option', 'afforded', 'easier', 'access', 'discs', 'ordinary', 'cardboard', 'packaging', 'option', 'afforded', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'novelty', 'head', 'novelty', 'head', 'allowed', 'avoid', 'headaches', 'escape-proof', 'DVD', 'prison', 'cells', 'essentially', 'same', 'price', 'jump', 'however', 'get', 'awful', 'accordion-of-no-return', 'disc', 'prison', 'same', 'rest', 'plastic', 'case', 'shaped', 'Krusty', 'head', 'clear', 'plastic', 'loop', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'regret', 'buying', 'way.P.S', 'ultimately', 'removed', 'discs', 'subjecting', 'oil', 'fingerprints', 'using', 'length', 'thin', 'rubber', 'tubing', 'such', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'administer', 'blood', 'test', 'much', 'expanding', 'cavity', 'containing', 'disc', 'flattened', 'tubing', 'slid', 'printed', 'side', 'disc', 'finger', 'pressing', 'tiny', 'bit', 'tubing', 'pinched', 'thumb', 'data', 'edge', 'disk', 'extracted', 'brothers', 'accordion', 'prison', 'inflicting', 'damage', 'suspect', 'surgical', 'gloves', 'could', 'have', 'accomplished', 'same', 'thing', 'one', 'access', 'responsible', 'collector', 'would', 'repeatedly', 'subject', 'valued', 'DVD', 'tight', 'wood', 'pulp', 'abrasion', 'press', 'mine', 'are', 'now', 'low-profile', 'DVD', 'cases', 'use', 'store', 'DVD', 'come', 'packaged', 'way', 'could', 'eventually', 'damage']",N/A

The DVDs aren't secure inside the slipcase (like any other DVD or CD).  Instead they are placed sideways in sleeves inside the slipcase.  They sleeves are very tight and the DVDs are difficult to remove.  You will inevitably smudge or even scratch the DVDs pulling them out.  The sleeves can be stretched a bit, but you must be careful no to tear the slipcase.  I removed each DVD and put them into a paper DVD/CD sleeve before putting them back into the sleeves of the slipcase. You could also just fold a piece of paper around the DVD and then put it back in the slipcase.

But all in all I generally feel that any Simpsons season is still a good one (if not a great one). And for that reason I have purchased every DVD set of The Simpsons released so far, including this latest release of the 11th season. And this is where my praise ends, because I am totally p.o.'d and disgusted that they would rip off the fans this way, by packaging these season 11 DVD's in such a shoddy, useless, non-user friendly, cheap, poorly designed, completely un-usable piece of cardboard excrement. The packaging is just exactly as described by others, a horrible accordian affair that sandwiches the disks between two cardboard halves so tightly that it is virtually impossible to remove a disk without damaging or tearing the cardboard, scuffing or scratching the disks, or for that matter smearing them with finger prints as you try to pry them loose with your fingers and a jaws of life. Do Matt Groening and his people have any say or approval in how the DVD's of their work are released to the fans? Or do they just sit back and collect the royalty checks and keep their mouths shut? Sadly, looking at this miserable excuse for a DVD set I would have to think that the latter is true. And the amazing thing is, that the studios are continually trying to sway people away from downloading DVD's and instead to buy their favorite shows on factory made disks. Do they really think that a poorly designed release like this is going to encorage people to BUY the next Simpsons DVD release? If they do then they are completely delusional.",1,And they're trying to discourage people from downloading?!,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,1889,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'love', 'Simpsons', 'been', 'favorite', 'show', 'very', 'first', 'full', 'season', 'way', 'back', '1990', 'let', 'also', 'say', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'such', 'thing', 'bad', 'season', 'show', 'are', 'cetainly', 'few', 'bad', 'episodes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'seasons', 'shine', 'others', 'generally', 'feel', 'Simpsons', 'season', 'still', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'reason', 'have', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'set', 'Simpsons', 'released', 'so', 'far', 'including', 'latest', 'release', '11th', 'season', 'where', 'praise', 'am', 'totally', 'p.o', ""'d"", 'disgusted', 'would', 'rip', 'off', 'fans', 'way', 'packaging', 'season', '11', 'DVD', 'such', 'shoddy', 'useless', 'non-user', 'friendly', 'cheap', 'poorly', 'designed', 'completely', 'un-usable', 'piece', 'cardboard', 'excrement', 'packaging', 'just', 'exactly', 'described', 'others', 'horrible', 'accordian', 'affair', 'disks', 'two', 'cardboard', 'halves', 'so', 'tightly', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'remove', 'disk', 'damaging', 'tearing', 'cardboard', 'scuffing', 'scratching', 'disks', 'matter', 'smearing', 'finger', 'prints', 'try', 'pry', 'loose', 'fingers', 'jaws', 'life', 'Do', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'people', 'have', 'say', 'approval', 'how', 'DVD', 'work', 'are', 'released', 'fans', 'do', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'collect', 'royalty', 'checks', 'keep', 'mouths', 'shut', 'Sadly', 'looking', 'miserable', 'excuse', 'DVD', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'latter', 'true', 'amazing', 'thing', 'studios', 'are', 'continually', 'trying', 'sway', 'people', 'away', 'downloading', 'DVD', 'instead', 'buy', 'favorite', 'shows', 'factory', 'made', 'disks', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'poorly', 'designed', 'release', 'going', 'encorage', 'people', 'BUY', 'next', 'Simpsons', 'DVD', 'release', 'do', 'then', 'are', 'completely', 'delusional']",N/A

Plus, the price is quite hefty as well!  On here I'ts $37.xx w/ s & H.. but most stores price it even higher at around $40 or higher.  Thats ridiculous!!!  I'll wait till the price drops or Till i find a used copy at my local new/used movie store.  The only episode that im curiious about anyway is the one where Ned Flanders' wife ""Maude"" dies in  some freak out accident.  Season 10 didnt even have many decent episodeds in it.  I Thought the last ep. of S-10 the tokyo one would be better than it was. I was practically falling asleep on that one. lol.  Anyway, as far as im concerned S-1->S-08 are the BEST seasons in my personal opinion!!  ONce Al Jean took over im mean the show really went TO H*ll honestly.  A few random good one liners but overall episodes after season 8 arent that good. The movie last year was good.  I personally, think they shouldve ended the show with the movie. I think that wouldve been a better ending.  Im surprised the keep going with this show.  You can tell there running out of plot ideas/stories.  How many different or 2nd jobs is Homer going to get.  THats getting old real fast!  The Treehouse of horror episodes in just about..every season are usually entertaining.  THough again Treee house of horror episodes from season 1-8 are the BEST!!  Wish i wouldnt have bought S-10 after viewing it.  I found it a major yawn fest.  I think family guy future seasons will be getting more of my $$.  I personnally hate the episodes that start off then they preview a past segment like 10-30 yrs ago incident... those are really boring...really fast!  Wonder when the show is going to call it quits?  I heard 2 things. either when the hit ep . #265 or ep. # 300?  Who knows??  I'll just record tthe ones i like off FOX on weekdays and the rest(newer ep..) i wont be viewing.  There way behind in making box sets with this show anyway like i.e.-King the hilll..same way.  Way behind on making them. If they wouldnt put so many unnecessary special features or/and commentary on every single episode then maybe they would dish out seasons on dvd quicker.  My opinion i guess. TIP: really search around for either the old or new(your preference) seasons on dvd.  Some retailers will really rip you off -BIGTIME!!  Happy viewing..! Family guy is on target with making dvd collections and up to date with them.  WHy cant the simpsons and other shows be more current??

Once the show came out on DVD, I started buying them, and I've gotten to see episodes that were new to me. I have to say that after what I'm seeing in season 11, I don't think I'll be buying any future sets. If you like these episodes, there's nothing wrong with that or you. I just honestly feel a big drop off in quality with this season. This show isn't making me laugh anymore. It seems like they jump the shark with each episode here. I understand that the show had been around for quite awhile at this point, and you gotta start running out of ideas, but this seems prevalent through the whole season. The first episode here felt to me like it was only about creating a reason for Mel Gibson to make a cameo. The episode wasn't funny, and throwing Mel Gibson at me doesn't make up for it. Many of these episodes seem to be less about story, and more about throwing gimmicks at the audience. In one, the Simpsons must flee Springfield and begin living on a farm, just to do something different. In another, for some stupid reason, Mr. Burns allows the Simpsons to watch after his mansion while he's away. They even killed off Maude Flanders. It's like they didn't have any good ideas, so they said, ""Lets kill off a character."" The season isn't terrible, but it's not at all what it used to be. I guess I just miss the earlier episodes where the show was funny and had heart, and there were actual stories, not just gimmick after gimmick. In ""Missionary: Impossible,"" there's a slam against Family Guy towards the end. Family Guy is called ""crude, low brow programming."" Why did the writers feel the need for this? Were they jealous cause they knew that Family Guy had become a much more entertaining show? Don't insult a better show because yours sucks.

So I pull and tug. Still won't budge. So I stick my fingers in further. The side breaks. Rather, I should say, that the artistic cardboard piece that holds the DVD in place breaks off the accordion-style board. So now I have a bunch of loose DVDs in a box being held in by pressure. This was the day I got it. 2nd problem is that it rubs against the packaging. DVDs are already very sensitive and easy to destroy, but to make the packaging the way they did, it's as if they're TRYING to ensure that it doesn't make it more than a few viewings.Why would they go through all the effort of creating nice artwork and putting it onto slick cardboard pages, then c%@p out at the last thought and create just a sleeve?

When Fox decided to put season 6 in the stupid ""collectible"" boxes I wasn't happy, but they seemed to learn their lesson and made replacement ""boxes"" available for season 6 and had regular boxes available for each subsequent season. For some reason, when the new season was announced at Amazon only the special edition packaging was available and  it wasn't clearly identified as a special edition. So once again, I received a crappy box that won't fit with my other DVDs on the shelf. I'm sending it back and would like to order the regular box, but for some reason Fox and Amazon has seen fit to charge $7 more for the non-special edition package. Nice try. It looks like my personal collection of Simpsons DVDs is only making it up to season 10. You should take better care of your customers.---I'm ammending my review somewhat. After reading a few other reviews where they say that the limited edition box is the exact same box as the regular one with the Krusty face stuck on, I decided to investigate further. The Krusty face is stuck on with that same sticky gummy stuff they use on the back. It came off very easily (but based on my past experience with that gummy stuff, the longer you wait to remove it the harder it will be). Knowing that the the two sets are identical except for the Krusty face stuck on makes me even more mad that Amazon is charging $7 more for the regular set. But every other review complaining about the cardboard sleeves are dead accurate. I'd still only give this a one (or zero) star rating. Fox is getting cheaper and cheaper with their packaging. This may well still be the last set I get.",1,I'm done. I'd rate this zero stars if I could.,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,1722,"['many', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'pre-order', 'Simpsons', 'DVDs', 'months', 'months', 'advance', 'When', 'Fox', 'decided', 'put', 'season', '6', 'stupid', 'collectible', 'boxes', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'seemed', 'learn', 'lesson', 'made', 'replacement', 'boxes', 'available', 'season', '6', 'had', 'regular', 'boxes', 'available', 'subsequent', 'season', 'reason', 'when', 'new', 'season', 'was', 'announced', 'Amazon', 'only', 'special', 'edition', 'packaging', 'was', 'available', 'was', ""n't"", 'clearly', 'identified', 'special', 'edition', 'So', 'once', 'again', 'received', 'crappy', 'box', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fit', 'other', 'DVDs', 'shelf', ""'m"", 'sending', 'back', 'would', 'like', 'order', 'regular', 'box', 'reason', 'Fox', 'Amazon', 'seen', 'fit', 'charge', '7', 'more', 'non-special', 'edition', 'package', 'Nice', 'try', 'personal', 'collection', 'Simpsons', 'DVDs', 'only', 'making', 'season', '10', 'should', 'take', 'better', 'care', 'customers.', '-I', ""'m"", 'ammending', 'review', 'somewhat', 'reading', 'few', 'other', 'reviews', 'where', 'say', 'limited', 'edition', 'box', 'exact', 'same', 'box', 'regular', 'one', 'Krusty', 'face', 'stuck', 'decided', 'investigate', 'further', 'Krusty', 'face', 'stuck', 'same', 'sticky', 'gummy', 'stuff', 'use', 'back', 'came', 'off', 'very', 'easily', 'based', 'past', 'experience', 'gummy', 'stuff', 'longer', 'wait', 'remove', 'harder', 'will', 'be', 'Knowing', 'two', 'sets', 'are', 'identical', 'Krusty', 'face', 'stuck', 'even', 'more', 'mad', 'Amazon', 'charging', '7', 'more', 'regular', 'set', 'other', 'review', 'complaining', 'cardboard', 'sleeves', 'are', 'dead', 'accurate', ""'d"", 'still', 'only', 'give', 'one', 'zero', 'star', 'rating', 'Fox', 'getting', 'cheaper', 'cheaper', 'packaging', 'may', 'well', 'still', 'be', 'last', 'set', 'get']",N/A

Personally, I refer to it as an animated sitcom rather than just a cartoon though beginning in this season, the show does begin to fall apart due to negligent, uncreative, ignorant writing leaving us with extremely sterilized episodes.... Much as how SNL hasn't been funny for years and feels very sterile... The same happens to the Simpsons beginning with this season.Personally, I believe the show has a lot of potential left but am convinced it is the poor writing staff who don't seem to care and I'm going to hate the first Sunday when The Simpsons is no longer apart of the Fox Sunday Night Line Up. I pray we may get a decent writing team and better producers before such a thing happens.Regardless of the top there, I'm writing this review to condemn the packaging. There is much to be said about the season itself as there are some good episodes and some terrible, but the packaging here is a major issue.As others have pointed out, you get a cheap, paper fold-out thing that has the DVDs stuck in little sleeves that you have to pull out with your fingers getting the disc smudged (from your fingers) and scratched (from the cheap paper). I'm going to be immediately ripping these discs to my computer to stream to the television as it takes a good 2 minutes to remove any of the discs from the case and no matter how careful you are, damage will be done.I have to this get a single star. The season itself deserves about a three but the packaging alone compels me to one-star. It shouldn't require minutes and unavoidable disc damage to watch these episodes. Very disappointed. This whole packaging, I have to wonder how it was conceived as no matter how you think about it, what were they thinking? There is no way this could've ever worked without damage to the discs and an extreme inconvenience.EDIT:Had to add, despite the sheer inconvenience and destructive nature of this boxset... It's cheap. The previous boxsets have all been more innovative and useful, a true boxset, unlike some TV on DVD that come with slim DVD holders (eg. King of the Hill). Originally, when I saw this at the store, I thought it was as such, not as cool as the previous boxsets but convenient, safe, and it works. But no... Nothing like that at all. Just cheap, ruinous, inconvenient paper sleeves.

1049580,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B000MR8W8I,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[25, 25]","I had been wondering when I would stop purchasing season box sets of the Simpsons. Well, I am wondering no longer. After having watched this set all the way through, I recall vividly the point at which this show ""jumped the shark.""But I'll get to that in a bit. First off, let me echo all of the other negative reviews of the packaging. This is by far the worst packaging Fox has foisted upon us - and that is saying a LOT. The cardboard sleeves seem designed to either rip in half or scratch the discs inside. Also, let me just say that the DVD menus of the Simpsons sets are atrocious. A user is forced to burrow through layer after irritating layer of menu to find an episode or to do something like turn on subtitles - a function which the disc will not allow you to adjust while the video is playing.As far as the show itself, here are the highlights:-""E-I-E-I-Annoyed Grunt"": The 'Tomacco' episode is a gem.-""Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder"": A classic. It has all the elements. Bowling, an emotionally based family-values story with Maggie, and a funny guest star who isn't too obtrusive.-""The Mansion Family"": Burns/Smithers is generally golden, and they don't disappoint here.-""Bart to the Future"": Simpsons future stories have always been pretty good. They allow for character development and future humor, which usually works.-""Little Big Mom"": once Lucy Arnez showed up, this show took off.-""Behind the Laughter"": a swan song if there ever was one. After the dreck of the preceding 2 discs, such a perfectly executed and funny episode was almost sad. Except it was still hilarious.The (very) lowlights:-""Saddlesore Galactica"": Is this the one where the show jumps the shark? Gosh, when you have a 2-minute musical number featuring evil elfin jockeys, it's hard to argue. Except for:-""Alone again, Datura-diddly"": this has to be just about the worst episode in the show's run. It has joke about an oversized penis, which is REALLY inappropriate for this show; it tries to pull heartstrings by killing a character, but fails because of the off-key humor and the fact that no one cares about Maude Flanders (not even the original voice actress, apparently); it goes on for minute after minute on two painfully unfunny sequences (NASCAR and Ned's dating), it's just a disaster from start to finish. If ""Saddlesore"" began the leap over the shark, This episode was the stuck landing on waterskis.-""Days of Wine and D'oh-ses"": another side-character focus episode, this one ruining Barney for no apparent reason.-""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge"": any group of writers who can render Parker Posey unfunny has really achieved something for the ages.Overall, this season has a few more duds than good ones. But its major offenses against the franchise would take nearly a decade and a feature film to recover from. The parade of unfunny, nonsensical guest-stars, and the departure from the kind of storytelling that made the Simpsons ""golden age"" so good (character driven stories with recognizably human motivations) were really pretty fatal to the show. I LOVED the Simpsons. But it became very difficult to watch after this season. I'm sure there are theories. The departure of this or that writer or producer, actor, etc. But it simply comes down to this: since this season, the show has never really recovered, the bloom was off the rose.It's worth a purchase at under 20 bones (I got it for 15 in a post-Xmas sale), but not for full price. It's still the Simpsons. It's still better than most stuff on TV. But if you are a true fan who has loved the ten seasons preceding this one, this one will be bittersweet at best (and downright infuriating at worst). If you are a newcomer to the show (which is difficult to imagine), you'd be better served purchasing season 4, let's say.",3,The last gasp before the Simpsons' dark age...,1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,3782,"['had', 'been', 'wondering', 'when', 'would', 'stop', 'purchasing', 'season', 'box', 'sets', 'Simpsons', 'Well', 'am', 'wondering', 'longer', 'having', 'watched', 'set', 'way', 'recall', 'vividly', 'point', 'show', 'jumped', 'shark', ""'ll"", 'get', 'bit', 'First', 'let', 'echo', 'other', 'negative', 'reviews', 'packaging', 'far', 'worst', 'packaging', 'Fox', 'foisted', 'saying', 'LOT', 'cardboard', 'seem', 'designed', 'rip', 'half', 'scratch', 'discs', 'inside', 'Also', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'DVD', 'menus', 'Simpsons', 'sets', 'are', 'atrocious', 'user', 'forced', 'burrow', 'layer', 'irritating', 'layer', 'menu', 'find', 'episode', 'do', 'something', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'function', 'disc', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'adjust', 'video', 'playing.As', 'far', 'show', 'here', 'are', 'highlights', 'E-I-E-I-Annoyed', 'Grunt', ""'Tomacco"", 'episode', 'gem.-', 'Hello', 'Gutter', 'Hello', 'Fadder', 'classic', 'elements', 'Bowling', 'emotionally', 'based', 'family-values', 'story', 'Maggie', 'funny', 'guest', 'star', 'who', ""n't"", 'too', 'obtrusive.-', 'Mansion', 'Family', 'Burns/Smithers', 'generally', 'golden', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here.-', 'Bart', 'Future', 'Simpsons', 'future', 'stories', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'allow', 'character', 'development', 'future', 'humor', 'usually', 'works.-', 'Little', 'Big', 'Mom', 'once', 'Lucy', 'Arnez', 'showed', 'up', 'show', 'took', 'off.-', 'Laughter', 'swan', 'song', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'dreck', 'preceding', '2', 'discs', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'funny', 'episode', 'was', 'almost', 'sad', 'was', 'still', 'hilarious.The', 'very', 'lowlights', 'Saddlesore', 'Galactica', 'one', 'where', 'show', 'shark', 'Gosh', 'when', 'have', '2-minute', 'musical', 'number', 'featuring', 'evil', 'elfin', 'jockeys', 'hard', 'argue', 'Alone', 'again', 'Datura-diddly', 'be', 'just', 'worst', 'episode', 'show', 'run', 'joke', 'oversized', 'penis', 'REALLY', 'inappropriate', 'show', 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'killing', 'character', 'off-key', 'humor', 'fact', 'one', 'Maude', 'Flanders', 'not', 'even', 'original', 'voice', 'actress', 'apparently', 'minute', 'minute', 'two', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'sequences', 'NASCAR', 'Ned', 'dating', 'just', 'disaster', 'start', 'finish', 'Saddlesore', 'began', 'leap', 'shark', 'episode', 'was', 'stuck', 'landing', 'waterskis.-', 'Days', 'Wine', ""D'oh-ses"", 'side-character', 'focus', 'episode', 'one', 'ruining', 'Barney', 'apparent', 'reason.-', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Marge', 'group', 'writers', 'who', 'can', 'render', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'unfunny', 'really', 'achieved', 'something', 'ages.Overall', 'season', 'few', 'more', 'duds', 'good', 'ones', 'major', 'offenses', 'franchise', 'would', 'take', 'nearly', 'decade', 'feature', 'film', 'recover', 'parade', 'unfunny', 'nonsensical', 'guest-stars', 'departure', 'kind', 'storytelling', 'made', 'Simpsons', 'golden', 'age', 'so', 'good', 'character', 'driven', 'stories', 'recognizably', 'human', 'motivations', 'were', 'really', 'pretty', 'fatal', 'show', 'LOVED', 'Simpsons', 'became', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'season', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'theories', 'departure', 'writer', 'producer', 'actor', 'etc', 'simply', 'down', 'season', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'recovered', 'bloom', 'was', 'rose.It', 'worth', 'purchase', '20', 'bones', 'got', '15', 'post-Xmas', 'sale', 'not', 'full', 'price', 'still', 'Simpsons', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'stuff', 'TV', 'are', 'true', 'fan', 'who', 'loved', 'ten', 'seasons', 'preceding', 'one', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'bittersweet', 'best', 'downright', 'infuriating', 'worst', 'are', 'newcomer', 'show', 'difficult', 'imagine', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'served', 'purchasing', 'season', '4', 'let', 'say']",N/A

1049587,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B000MR8W8I,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[62, 69]","I didn't want to just write a review about my initial response to the new box design because I think we all know how we as fans feel about that. First I wanted to give actual information about the set to people who are unsure or when shopping on Amazon don't want to be bothered to look on tv.com for episode lists.The set contains the following episodes from Season Eleven:Beyond Blunderdome- Mel Gibson and Homer team upBrother's Little Helper- Bart has ADD, takes Focusyn DrugGuess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner- Homer, Food Critic.Treehouse of Horror X- Ned: Werewolf, Bart, Lisa: Superpowers, Y2K: World EndsE-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)- Family lives on a farm, TomacoHello Gutter, Hello Fadder- Homer bowls 300 and his life peaksEight Misbehavin'- Apu has his octupletsTake My Wife, Sleaze- Homer becomes a biker, biker's kidnap margeGrift of the Magi-  Christmas, Funzo and Gary ColemanLittle Big Mom- Marge breaks leg, Lisa takes overFaith Off- Bart becomes a faith healerThe Mansion Family- The Simpsons live in Burn's MansionSaddlesore Galactica- The Simpsons get a horse, again, Furious D.Alone Again, Natura-Diddily- Maude Flanders diesMissionary: Impossible- Homer Vs. PBS, save me JebusPygmoelian- Moe gets plastic surgery.Bart to the Future- Bart is a deadbeat, Lisa is president.Days of Wine and D'oh'ses- Barney goes sober.Kill the Alligator and Run- The family goes to Florida, Spring Break.Last Tap Dance in Springfield- Lisa finds difficulty tap dancing, Bart lives at the mall.It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge- Otto's girlfriend moves in with the simpsons, Marge gets paranoid.Behind the Laughter- A parody of behind the music.Those are the episodes for anyone wondering. As for the box, Amazon sells the limited edition Krusty head cheaper but it is the same as the regular box but with a krusty face rubber cemented on, the same stuff used to hold on the listing of episodes on the back of all previous box sets, so you can remove it and have the regular box but I don't know how much damage the stuff is capable of if it bonds too much and I'd rather just pay more for the other one. The inside of the box is very disappointing, we all know and seem to agree, the cardboard is a bad idea because it defeats the most important purpose of the box set which is to keep our discs well stored and accessable. The tight carboard slots rather than plastic holders make it more difficult to get at our discs and store them properly, though I haven't had problems with it yet I foresee down the road a few years when the constant contact with cardboard will erode and scratch the discs no matter how careful I always am. We buy boxsets to own the episodes and be able to keep them so why make a set that won't preserve the life of the discs? It's not for the enviroment or they wouldn't use that wasteful Krusty head on it or use non-biodegradable cardboard. I think it is just laziness or a bad idea.Anyway everyone debates their last great season of the Simpsons and this is the one truly great last season for me. Opening with Mel Gibson and ending on the Behind the Music Parody it's entertaining from beginning to end. Twelve and thirteen move further into a bad place in the series where for some of us who grew up on it it became too hard to relate to anymore. I stopped watching completely by the end of thirteen. From here the comedy gets more obvious and straight forward and rather than the quick, rapid fire joke pacing they developed (and Family guy came out with and became known for) they move to a place where they hold on a joke for too long and seem to try too hard. It feels to me like they wrote it trying to make it funny to other people when the rule of comedy is to write something you find funny and so will other people.Great episodes on the set, commentaries and extras are what they always are and provide some viewers entertainment, I find the commentaries rather amusing as they poke fun at themselves and you can see here that they really find what they wrote in those years amusing. Packaging seems to be everyones sore spot here and I agree but sadly am used to Fox disappointing me in these recent years, first by stopping the release of King of the Hill box sets before the last great seasons and second by only releasing the first season of Malcolm in the Middle and finally with the huge amount of time they took in releasing the Simpson box sets thus far. Thankfully I will only be buying season twelve and then after that I'm finally done with Fox and their dreadful box sets. (What happened to the days of Futurama volumes 1-4, those sets were excellent).PS.People in America think they've had trouble with the sets but I live in Canada and besides the set back of season 6 and this recent development with 11 I also had them screw me up on season 8 by changing the titling on the side of the boxes to include les Simpson reverting the Simpsons to half the size to make room (since they have moved both around numerous times on following sets in experimentations but none ever match the previous box sets in the series). With the distinctive art of the show on the cover and the name simpsons in yellow on it you think anyone in any language could tell what this is without specific useless articles of speech being translated.

1049588,AFV2584U13XP3,B000MR8W8I,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[3, 3]",First I have to agree with one reviewer is that the design for this season box set was stupid. The cardboard sleeve they put the dvds inside of are annoying to get them out without causing some damage to the cardboard simpson fun house sleeve as they are held into the sleeve so tightly you have to bend the sleeve to get the dvd out.  That out of the way season itself is still a little humorous but you can see how their trying to keep the comedy still going with this season.  There are some episodes that make fun of some of the issues that were going on at that time like the giving of certain drugs to children to help them focus in school more or be less aggressive and destructive.  Or the episode when Ned Flander's wife was killed and he has to try to get back into the singles club.  I also liked the Halloween episode of this seasons Simposons with the cameo voice appearance of Lucy Lawless.  But I have to say if you seen the previous seasons or have them already on dvd you'll see the humor has dried up a bit with this season though. So at the end for the price and if you're a hard-core Simpsons fan I say get this box set for your collection but don't expect the same level of enjoyment like the previous seasons though...,3,Somewhat Still Entertaining ButThe Humor Is Stale,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,1240,"['First', 'have', 'agree', 'one', 'reviewer', 'design', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'stupid', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'put', 'dvds', 'are', 'annoying', 'get', 'out', 'causing', 'damage', 'cardboard', 'simpson', 'fun', 'house', 'sleeve', 'are', 'held', 'sleeve', 'so', 'tightly', 'have', 'bend', 'sleeve', 'get', 'dvd', 'out', 'way', 'season', 'still', 'little', 'humorous', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'trying', 'keep', 'comedy', 'still', 'going', 'season', 'are', 'episodes', 'make', 'fun', 'issues', 'were', 'going', 'time', 'giving', 'certain', 'drugs', 'children', 'help', 'focus', 'school', 'more', 'be', 'less', 'aggressive', 'destructive', 'episode', 'when', 'Ned', 'Flander', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'singles', 'club', 'also', 'liked', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'seasons', 'Simposons', 'cameo', 'voice', 'appearance', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'have', 'say', 'seen', 'previous', 'seasons', 'have', 'already', 'dvd', ""'ll"", 'see', 'humor', 'dried', 'up', 'bit', 'season', 'So', 'end', 'price', ""'re"", 'hard-core', 'Simpsons', 'fan', 'say', 'get', 'box', 'set', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'same', 'level', 'enjoyment', 'previous', 'seasons']",N/A
1049589,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B000MR8W8I,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[2, 2]","I have to agree with the other negative evaluations of the dvd cardboard packaging. I recently started watching The Simpsons again and started with Season 11 and worked my way back to season 8. I've been pleasantly entertained now for a couple of weeks. The Simpsons are a fun and zany cartoon family. I left the Simpsons for a few years preferring to watch American Dad, Family Guy and South Park and some Futurama. So watching The Simpsons again was welcomed anew by my senses. The Simpsons had something going back in the day. I can see that the quality has gone down quite a bit though in the newest episodes. But back to Season 11, yes, the packaging is a pain in the ass. I was tired when I first sat down with Season 11. I was thinking, whoa, something is different here. I had to physically bend the cardboard packaging just to FIND the dvds. You can't physically SEE just which cardboard space contains a dvd. And YES, any dirt or grit that finds its way into the cardboard will surely scratch the dvds because they must be jammed into the cardboard space and they must be PULLED out. The only plus side is the cardboard will not CRACK the way the plastic will and it is biodegradeable--- so it won't outlive us by a thousand years the way plastic will. The cardboard idea is ok but the space is too TIGHT and I found it hard to simply FIND the DVDS. This being said, the plastic ALSO breaks. There isn't really a PERFECT packaging.

McAdams,"[5, 7]","The heads were bad enough, but at least they went back to offering the standard packaging as an alternative after that one unfortunate move with season six.  And the standard packaging outsold the head packaging embarrassingly so, look up the sales stats here on Amazon.  They are not offering any such alternatives for this season, and the paper sleeves really are as bad as everyone has been saying.  I had to see it for myself to really believe it.  The discs are hard to get to, the sleeves are made out of plain paper/cardboard, and held in place with cheap glue.  I have already managed to break the glue bond on the sleeve holding the first disc, just trying to get it out of there.  I have posted four pictures of the sleeves in the customer images for this product.  I was kind of surprised that nobody had done that yet.The show itself is fine.  You either like the Simpsons, or you don't.  I, personally, do.  Although, season 11 wasn't their strongest season, that is for sure.  But the show itself isn't the only reason I buy DVD sets -- digital downloads from places like iTunes, Amazon, hulu, Netflix (not all of those options offer downloads to own, granted) and others are a perfectly acceptable way to watch TV shows.  I buy DVD sets as a collector, not just to watch the show.  I CARE about the presentation and treatment of the discs, and this season set does not do well with either one of those factors.If they continue with this unfortunate packaging decision for the next season (without offering standard packaging as an alternative), I will not purchase it on DVD.
