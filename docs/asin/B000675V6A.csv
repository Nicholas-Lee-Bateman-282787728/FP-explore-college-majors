Amazingly it belies its low budget and manages to tell a good story with a competent cast and script and the polished look of bigger budget feature.  I had no idea that it was made on a shoestring until I watched the DVD extras. This is not the usual gay-themed movie, but a well-done thriller that maintains interest throughout.  Especially notable is Malcolm Moorman, who gives a chilling performance as the serial killer.  The movie says a lot about gay cops who must remain closeted.This movie is definitely a cut above the rest and it's worth checking out.",4,"Not the usual ""gay"" movie but a well-done thriller.",1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,644,"['gritty', 'original', 'no-budget', 'film', 'gay', 'cop', 'serial', 'killer', 'Amazingly', 'low', 'budget', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'competent', 'cast', 'script', 'polished', 'look', 'bigger', 'budget', 'feature', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'made', 'shoestring', 'watched', 'DVD', 'extras', 'not', 'usual', 'gay-themed', 'movie', 'well-done', 'thriller', 'interest', 'Especially', 'notable', 'Malcolm', 'Moorman', 'who', 'chilling', 'performance', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'lot', 'gay', 'cops', 'who', 'must', 'remain', 'closeted.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'cut', 'rest', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

861978,A3I2E820C9T4YA,B000675V6A,"C.T. Chase ""cchase8860""","[2, 2]","Where William Friedkin's luridly exploitative gay-themed crime drama CRUISING dropped the ball, HARD picks up that missed opportunity and runs with it. Its low-budget origins are undeniable, and the acting talent, which ranges from fairly good to almost non-existent, happens to be the best the producers could get for free (one must assume that 99% of the cast worked for 'deferred pay' or no money at all.) But the true power of the movie lies in its message - about the aftermath of society's proclivity to marginalize and even isolate a segment of the community it considers less-than-human and utterly disposable.Newly-promoted Detective Ray Vates (co-producer and star Noel Palomaria) is almost immediately thrust into a grisly serial murder case with his hard-bitten partner (Charles Lanyer), involving the brutal mutilation and murder of a string of male hustlers and teen runaways in the seediest areas of Los Angeles. Compounding the difficulties he faces in this investigation - no viable witnesses, virulently homophobic colleagues - is the secret that Ray carries himself: he's deeply in the closet to everyone (except for his ex-wife).While canvassing a gay bar for witnesses, one of the same kinds of bars he frequents in his off-duty hours, Ray encounters Jack (Malcolm Moorman), a handsome, charismatic patron who contacts Ray again and challenges him about his ""secret identity.""  Their rough, antagonistic second meeting sparks irresistible sexual chemistry between the two men, and a night of passionate sex ensues. The cold morning light brings even more chilling reality with it, when Ray discovers that Jack is the serial killer he's been hunting all along, and a smirking Jack steals the detective's badge, taunting him to ""come and find me.""But that means that Ray is forced to confront his greatest fear - coming out to everyone in the precinct and to the world, something he's left no choice but to do, and a decision that leaves him vulnerable, reviled and ostracized by everyone save his straight partner, whose help Ray will rely on as the desperate game of cat-and-mouse between him and Jack escalates, leading to a suspenseful and chilling climax.Regardless of the technical and creative shortcomings, HARD is definitely an admirable effort from the team of Palomaria, John Huckert and John Matkowsky.  The writing is insightful, sharp and well-researched, incorporating the aspects, habits and psyche of a serial killer in an alarmingly realistic way that not even SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or SEVEN did. The sadomasochistic relationship between Jack and the bisexual married man whose home and family he completely takes over, recalls episodes from the life of Henry Lee Lucas and his lover/accomplice, Otis Toole. And several close encounters Jack has with the police, with his intended victims in plain sight, intentionally reference documented events that took place in the Jeffrey Dahmer case.The production values and cinematography are outstanding for a film with such a limited budget, and acting-wise, Palomaria as Ray Vates, Malcolm Moorman as Jack and Charles Lanyer as ""Lucky"", Jack's partner all carry the film admirably with their understated but committed performances.Lovers of gritty crime dramas would find much to like here, if they can accept that HARD is completely uncompromising about scenes that will make more than a few viewers balk even more than the violence...especially the depictions of men having sex together. This is not a politically-correct, Hollywood-sanitized product for mass-market appeal. Much like BASIC INSTINCT took an unblinking look at the sexual proclivities of its flawed hero and voraciously promiscuous anti-heroine, HARD does the same for its main characters as well.And as for the violence, the film takes the tried-and-true classic ""less is more"" approach, which is incredibly effective.  The killings, torture and rape are seen more after-the-fact, letting the viewers' minds fill in the blanks and making what little on-screen brutality that is shown that much more effective.The filmmakers have flung down a gauntlet that the big-name ""players"" of the industry would never accept, and in a way, I'm glad. HARD is intended to be the first part of a trilogy, and I certainly hope that the production team gets their chance to complete it. The characters of Ray and Jack are memorable enough that you do wind up wanting to know what happens to them after the end of this film. It's certainly HARD not to think about it...",5,Uncompromising...,1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,4502,"['Where', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'luridly', 'exploitative', 'gay-themed', 'crime', 'drama', 'CRUISING', 'dropped', 'ball', 'HARD', 'up', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'low-budget', 'origins', 'are', 'undeniable', 'acting', 'talent', 'fairly', 'good', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'be', 'best', 'producers', 'could', 'get', 'free', 'one', 'must', 'assume', '99', '%', 'cast', 'worked', ""'deferred"", 'pay', 'money', 'true', 'power', 'movie', 'message', 'aftermath', 'society', 'proclivity', 'marginalize', 'even', 'isolate', 'segment', 'community', 'less-than-human', 'utterly', 'disposable.Newly-promoted', 'Detective', 'Ray', 'Vates', 'co-producer', 'star', 'Noel', 'Palomaria', 'almost', 'immediately', 'thrust', 'grisly', 'serial', 'murder', 'case', 'hard-bitten', 'partner', 'Charles', 'Lanyer', 'involving', 'brutal', 'mutilation', 'murder', 'string', 'male', 'hustlers', 'teen', 'runaways', 'seediest', 'areas', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Compounding', 'difficulties', 'investigation', 'viable', 'witnesses', 'virulently', 'homophobic', 'colleagues', 'secret', 'Ray', 'deeply', 'closet', 'everyone', 'ex-wife', 'canvassing', 'gay', 'bar', 'witnesses', 'one', 'same', 'kinds', 'bars', 'off-duty', 'hours', 'Ray', 'Jack', 'Malcolm', 'Moorman', 'handsome', 'charismatic', 'patron', 'who', 'Ray', 'again', 'secret', 'identity', 'rough', 'antagonistic', 'second', 'meeting', 'sparks', 'irresistible', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'two', 'men', 'night', 'passionate', 'sex', 'ensues', 'cold', 'morning', 'light', 'even', 'more', 'chilling', 'reality', 'when', 'Ray', 'Jack', 'serial', 'killer', 'been', 'hunting', 'smirking', 'Jack', 'detective', 'badge', 'taunting', 'come', 'find', 'Ray', 'forced', 'confront', 'greatest', 'fear', 'coming', 'everyone', 'precinct', 'world', 'something', 'left', 'choice', 'do', 'decision', 'vulnerable', 'reviled', 'ostracized', 'everyone', 'save', 'straight', 'partner', 'help', 'Ray', 'will', 'rely', 'desperate', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'Jack', 'leading', 'suspenseful', 'chilling', 'climax.Regardless', 'technical', 'creative', 'shortcomings', 'HARD', 'definitely', 'admirable', 'effort', 'team', 'Palomaria', 'John', 'Huckert', 'John', 'Matkowsky', 'writing', 'insightful', 'sharp', 'well-researched', 'incorporating', 'aspects', 'habits', 'psyche', 'serial', 'killer', 'alarmingly', 'realistic', 'way', 'not', 'even', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'SEVEN', 'did', 'sadomasochistic', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'bisexual', 'married', 'man', 'home', 'family', 'completely', 'over', 'episodes', 'life', 'Henry', 'Lee', 'Lucas', 'lover/accomplice', 'Otis', 'Toole', 'several', 'close', 'encounters', 'Jack', 'police', 'intended', 'victims', 'plain', 'sight', 'intentionally', 'reference', 'documented', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'case.The', 'production', 'values', 'cinematography', 'are', 'outstanding', 'film', 'limited', 'budget', 'acting-wise', 'Palomaria', 'Ray', 'Vates', 'Malcolm', 'Moorman', 'Jack', 'Charles', 'Lanyer', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'partner', 'carry', 'film', 'admirably', 'understated', 'committed', 'performances.Lovers', 'gritty', 'crime', 'dramas', 'would', 'find', 'much', 'like', 'here', 'can', 'accept', 'HARD', 'completely', 'uncompromising', 'scenes', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'few', 'viewers', 'balk', 'even', 'more', 'violence', 'especially', 'depictions', 'men', 'having', 'sex', 'together', 'not', 'politically-correct', 'Hollywood-sanitized', 'product', 'mass-market', 'appeal', 'Much', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', 'took', 'unblinking', 'look', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'flawed', 'hero', 'voraciously', 'promiscuous', 'anti-heroine', 'HARD', 'same', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'well.And', 'violence', 'film', 'tried-and-true', 'classic', 'less', 'more', 'approach', 'incredibly', 'effective', 'killings', 'torture', 'rape', 'are', 'seen', 'more', 'after-the-fact', 'letting', 'viewers', 'minds', 'fill', 'blanks', 'making', 'what', 'little', 'on-screen', 'brutality', 'shown', 'much', 'more', 'effective.The', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'flung', 'down', 'gauntlet', 'big-name', 'players', 'industry', 'would', 'never', 'accept', 'way', ""'m"", 'glad', 'HARD', 'intended', 'be', 'first', 'part', 'trilogy', 'certainly', 'hope', 'production', 'team', 'chance', 'complete', 'characters', 'Ray', 'Jack', 'are', 'memorable', 'enough', 'do', 'wind', 'up', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'end', 'film', 'certainly', 'HARD', 'not', 'think']",N/A

It never came out on VHS or DVD until now! So I bought it.  While the lead actor's (the killers) acting is not as believable as I once thought (I was younger then...) the movie is still great. All of the actors are perfect for their parts, and one gets the impression there may one day be apart two. There is a lot of sex and violence in this, both very realistic. It deals with a gay cop who is forced to come out to explain an unusual happening (don't want to spoil it for you!) and a gay killer, who is sadistic and clearly has issues with societies treatment of  gay youth in trouble. He is under the impression he is putting them out of their misery, and is sort of  a dark angel.  Others disagree!  I don't really see how this can be compared to 'Cruising' (although it has been) but in my opinion, there has never been another gay film like this one. If so...this was the first of it's kind.  I have the feeling availability is limited, so you might want to endorse in this now.

Unfortunately it misses being a good movie for reasons that could have been easily rectified: 1. decrepit dwellings; the gay cop's apartment consists of a room only slightly larger than his bed with a punching bag by the door; his bathroom seems to be bigger and nicer than his whole apartment; a crappy trailer with one flowery sofa. 2. Some bad dialogue, but even worse is the delivery by the autopsy doctor, and especially by some woman in skin-tight jeans, who sounds just like a porn actress; she reminds me of the scene with Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights.""  3. Red paint which is supposed to be blood, but never dries; day-old blood turns brown, not latex red high gloss. 3. The scenes in the gay bar are not too good.Its message of a gay cop's being harassed is important, and I would like to see it spruced up so that it could gain wider acceptance.

The film shows what anti-gay feelings can lead human beings to. They first lead a lot of men to marry and then hide in some cupboard hoping the marriage will be enough to cover up reality. This hurts the wife and of course the kids who cannot accept that reality: a man is not only attracted by women. They then lead cops to some awful carelessness and even criminal sloppiness as soon as some homosexual is concerned: gay men have only one future in their minds, to die for their crime, only one crime, gay sex. Then they lead some people to get involved and even systematically active in the perspective of serial killing with a reasoning that can vary a lot but that always come back to the idea that serial killing is more or less good for the victims that are saved from their trashy lives, from their lives that are trashed by their being gay. The film tries to capture the horror of these murders from inside the mind of the serial killer, and from inside the mind of the young cop who has not come out of the cupboard yet and is confronted to the serial killer courting him, including with his murders, then to the hostility of his fellow cops when he comes out to enable the investigation to move on, and finally to the guilt he feels in himself as for his gayness, as for his attraction for the serial killer, as for the victims of this killer who he believes his following his love and his desire for him encouraged into performing more killings, proving himself through the deaths he stages and executes. Then what is left after the film? Not much except that it has revealed the hatred ""normal"" people and cops feel and express against gay men, it has revealed that this hatred will survive any kind of horror though no explanation is provided, and it stages up at the end the come back of the killer who was killed on the scene of his crimes, and it can start all over again. And that is the pessimistic lesson of the film. There is no hope. It will always be with us. It will always haunt us. It will always possess us. What?

861988,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000675V6A,Jonathan Appleseed,"[1, 3]","About twenty-seven minutes into this film, and after several exchanged glances of rolling our eyes at each other, my roommate said, ""This is the worst movie I've ever seen."" And so we went on to something else, and while I didn't think it was the *worst* movie I'd seen, it certainly was swirling around the bottom of the barrel. It worked fairly well as a police procedural - better than *some* larger budgeted movies, television, or cable shows - but the dialogue written to carry the film sounded like a training video, rendering this positive null.The next day I went back to the movie. There was only an hour left, so I thought I would see it through to the end. Everything was still sub par, but I noticed one thing. This was an earnest attempt to make a good movie. And that set it apart from others that might fall into the category of a B (or F) movie where actors toss out lines to get a buck, and the directors can the film to get their name listed. That wasn't happening here. It was apparent to me that everyone involved really wanted it to work. Everyone was giving their all.However, an earnest attempt doesn't make a good film, and it still had the same problems. Logic was chief amongst these. For example, a detective, regardless of how new he is to the badge, would never - unless he was looking for a reason to be kicked off the force - agree to meet a potential witness at a gay bar based on a ten second phone call received in the middle of the night. Especially when the detective in question isn't ""out"". That phone call has red flags all over it. Also, a killer would never - unless they were looking to be caught - use a wash-it-yourself car wash to clean themselves and their clothes of blood from a fresh kill in broad daylight. I mean, seriously. And cops, when pulling someone over who doesn't have plates, proper registration or ID, generally wouldn't ignore a bleeding, obviously drugged out kid in the passenger seat who is mouthing ""Help Me"" unless they themselves were intoxicated or dumb.Yet I saw merit. Unlike typical low-budget B films, there were themes present, mainly how a police officer deals with being outed, and the concept of expendable life. But while I appreciated the thematic content, the manner in which it was dealt was unsatisfying. I didn't learn anything new about what it's like to be outed as a cop that I haven't from watching Law & Order or movies that have dealt with the outing of military personnel. (Soldier's Girl comes immediately to mind as a 5-star example.) Some of his fellow cops harassed him, prancing around like, well, fairies, and they beat him to a bloody pulp while their Captain watched from his car with a disapproving look on his face. That perhaps said the most: the Captain wouldn't have anything to do with it.The serial killer himself isn't a particularly scary guy, but he is probably the best acted character. That is, until the end when they unwisely have him laugh like a raving lunatic (what is it with bad guys laughing at the end of books and movies...I wish that authors and filmmakers would get it into their heads that a laughing villain is not a scary one). The problem I had with the serial killer is that we don't get a motive for him until the very end, and he gives that motive to us. I think it would have made for a more interesting film if his motive had been discovered, or deduced. If he left fingerprints somewhere, they could have done a background check, found that he was ... whatever ... and started to put together a profile. But they didn't have much of a profile, which in itself was odd.My intention was to give this a one-star review. Then I watched some of the Extras, and let my emotion get the better of me. One of the actors in the film was also a technical advisor, an LA detective. He introduced the film at a screening, and explained that the film was made without a budget, that everyone donated their time and even producers did double or triple duty. When they were finished filming, they had trouble getting it printed because of the gay content. (Which, by the way, is not at all graphic. It's just there.) This detective emphasized how much of the filmmakers hearts went into the film, and that never before had a movie addressed coming out as a cop (I don't know if that's true) and especially the concept of expendable life. That gays or lesbians, if killed, are collateral damage. A coroner had a term for it that escapes me - it was abbreviated C.C. If anyone remembers, put it up as a comment?Having myself felt that there was an earnest attempt to make a good movie, and then to hear that 7 credit cards financed the making of the film and the rest of the back story, I couldn't help but appreciate their effort more. They truly started with nothing. Not bad for starting with nothing and a trusty Visa.2 stars, rounded up to 3 for an earnest attempt.",3,"Gets a ""C"" for effort",1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,4885,"['twenty-seven', 'minutes',

861989,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000675V6A,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 12]","I actually saw this film in the one theater it was shown at in Los Angeles.  It is a nasty little trifle about a gay serial killer torturing and killing young men.  A police detective, with a secret of his own (wonder what that could be), becomes involved and entwined with not just the case--but the killer, too.This is a ""gay movie"" made for a certain audience.  If you're not in that audience, don't bother.  You can see the same thing, done much better, in 1 billion other serial killer movies.  I do not subscribe, however, to the philosophy of many people who embrace any ""gay movie"", regardless of it's actual merit, with love and a 5-star rating.Let's speak honestly.  Is this movie very good?  No.  The acting is amateurish, the police procedural is comical, the killings are typically over-the-top.  Wait a minute, didn't I just describe lots of B-movie, straight-to-video clunkers.  You bet.I did appreciate, however, that finally there was a different type of ""gay movie"".  It's not a cornball coming-out comedy.  It's not an AIDs story.  It's not a message movie.  The film has no agenda other than to be entertaining.  And in that, you get lots of gore and lots of nudity and a certain amount of suspense.  It is quite graphic.  And most people would watch this type of film for just those reasons.You can see better ""gay movies"".  You can see better ""serial killer"" thrillers.  This movie, however, throws no punches and is under no illusions of grandeur.  If you need an empty-headed entertainment and you like this type of film--go for it.  If you're in an artistic mood--give it a pass.

This is a fine independent feature with interesting ideas about homophobia and the expendability of gay youth.  Where the heralded ""Silence of the Lambs"" and its sequels and prequels drip with homophobia, ""Hard"" has a uniquely queer perspective that is not saturated with the requisite self-hatred of most major studio work.
