I couldn't stand the voice of the narrator.  Sounded like someone who just graduated from broadcasting school and impressed with the sound of his own voice.  Take a pass.  I'm sure there are better docs out there on Frank!,2,Not worth the money,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,342,"['Really', 'disappointed', 'edits', 'video', 'cuts', 'were', 'rough', 'left', 'wondering', 'where', 'was', 'produced', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'voice', 'narrator', 'Sounded', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'graduated', 'broadcasting', 'school', 'impressed', 'sound', 'own', 'voice', 'Take', 'pass', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'better', 'docs', 'there', 'Frank']",N/A
