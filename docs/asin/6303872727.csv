The character designs are amazing, the animation is awesosme and you see half the time seeing nude women, including the main protagonist.My favorite scene is where you see a king surrounded by nothing but naked womens slaves who he has under his evil trance and he fondles one of the slave girls freely without consequence. It was an epic moment that bordered on hentai but it was etched in my mind ever since.Considering you pick this up for a few dollars, this hardcore anime with extreme nudity is as good as it gets in terms of pirce.Rating - A",5,Harcore and Extreme Nudity - Heacy Metal Style Anime,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,672,"['Wow', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'more', 'fan', 'service', '45', 'minutes', 'Legend', 'Lemnear', 'was', 'whole', 'Agent', 'Aika', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'amazing', 'animation', 'awesosme', 'see', 'time', 'seeing', 'nude', 'women', 'including', 'main', 'protagonist.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'king', 'surrounded', 'nothing', 'naked', 'womens', 'slaves', 'who', 'evil', 'trance', 'one', 'slave', 'girls', 'freely', 'consequence', 'was', 'epic', 'moment', 'bordered', 'hentai', 'was', 'etched', 'mind', 'ever', 'since.Considering', 'pick', 'up', 'few', 'dollars', 'hardcore', 'anime', 'extreme', 'nudity', 'as', 'good', 'terms', 'pirce.Rating', 'A']",Legend of Lemnear VHS

The movie is 45 minutes long, and it is directed by Kinji Yoshimoto.The film is about a female warrior named Lemnear who must combine her powers with a male warrior named Messhu in order to stop an evil sorcerer from destroying the world.I really love this movie. It is a great fantasy film. It is beautifully drawn, and the art style and character designs remind me a lot of video games like''Final Fantasy V Advance''. I love the art style, the music, the sound effects, the voice acting, and the story. It also has a wonderful happy ending. The film can be watched in English, or in Japanese with English subtitles.If you love Japanese anime, RPGs, or the fantasy genre, you'll love this movie.

Legend Of Lemnear was a 3-volume manga by Plastic Little creators Kinji Yoshimoto and Satoshi Urushihara, and was later adapted into this 45-minutes OVA.Set in a Conan-styled world, Lemnear is a bikini-clad warrior woman on a pterodactyl searching the landscape for the evil wizard Gardein that killed her family. This leads her to a city in the middle of the desert ruled by a lard-ass sultan who has the most bitchin' topless harem ever, but is also in the pocket of Gardein, and his master, the Dark Lord Varhol. Lemnear gets caught, and enslaved by the evil sultan, but encounters an old Gandalf dude who tells her she is the ""Champion of Silver"", and presents her with a magical necklace. After being temporarily hypnotized by the sultan, she breaks free and heads out after Gardein. She flies up on her big bird, and follows him to a giant floating fortress which is Varhol's lair. He absorbs Gardein into himself revealing that he was really a part of him all along, and that he is was the Champion of Gold. His plan was to absorb Lemnear and her captured friend Messhu(who is the Champion of Bronze)to become all powerful. Varhol then morphs into a two-headed dragon for a fight that Dirk the Daring would've survived. But Lemnear escapes with Messhu on her pterodactyl, and Varhol morphs again into a stone giant the size of a skyscraper. It takes the combine powers of Silver and Bronze to finally smite him down.Urushihara did some amazingly vibrant artwork for this, and there is truly vivid animation by AIC, whose work is seen in numerous anime movies and OVAs to this day. Most people think there's alot of similarities between this and the Taarna character from the Heavy Metal movie, mainly that she's a hot white-haired Red Sonja girl with flying dinosaur in a desolate wasteland, although this one is more fantasy-based, and is way heavier into fan service. It doesn't have much in the ways of substance, but is pretty good at least for fans of old Japanese NES fantasy games.",3,"Red Sonja, eat your heart out!",1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,2093,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'sexy', 'fantasy/adventure', 'then', 'totally', 'up', 'alley', 'Legend', 'Lemnear', 'was', '3-volume', 'manga', 'Plastic', 'Little', 'creators', 'Kinji', 'Yoshimoto', 'Satoshi', 'Urushihara', 'was', 'later', 'adapted', '45-minutes', 'OVA.Set', 'Conan-styled', 'world', 'Lemnear', 'bikini-clad', 'warrior', 'woman', 'pterodactyl', 'searching', 'landscape', 'evil', 'wizard', 'Gardein', 'killed', 'family', 'city', 'middle', 'desert', 'ruled', 'lard-ass', 'sultan', 'who', 'most', 'bitchin', 'topless', 'harem', 'ever', 'also', 'pocket', 'Gardein', 'master', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Varhol', 'Lemnear', 'caught', 'enslaved', 'evil', 'sultan', 'old', 'Gandalf', 'dude', 'who', 'Champion', 'Silver', 'magical', 'necklace', 'being', 'temporarily', 'hypnotized', 'sultan', 'free', 'out', 'Gardein', 'up', 'big', 'bird', 'giant', 'floating', 'fortress', 'Varhol', 'lair', 'Gardein', 'revealing', 'was', 'really', 'part', 'along', 'was', 'Champion', 'Gold', 'plan', 'was', 'absorb', 'Lemnear', 'captured', 'friend', 'Messhu', 'who', 'Champion', 'Bronze', 'become', 'powerful', 'Varhol', 'then', 'two-headed', 'dragon', 'fight', 'Daring', 'would', ""'ve"", 'survived', 'Lemnear', 'Messhu', 'pterodactyl', 'Varhol', 'morphs', 'again', 'stone', 'giant', 'size', 'skyscraper', 'combine', 'powers', 'Silver', 'Bronze', 'finally', 'smite', 'down.Urushihara', 'did', 'amazingly', 'vibrant', 'artwork', 'truly', 'vivid', 'animation', 'AIC', 'work', 'seen', 'numerous', 'anime', 'movies', 'OVAs', 'day', 'Most', 'people', 'think', 'alot', 'similarities', 'Taarna', 'character', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'movie', 'mainly', 'hot', 'white-haired', 'Red', 'Sonja', 'girl', 'flying', 'dinosaur', 'desolate', 'wasteland', 'one', 'more', 'fantasy-based', 'way', 'heavier', 'fan', 'service', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'ways', 'substance', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'fans', 'old', 'Japanese', 'NES', 'fantasy', 'games']",Legend of Lemnear VHS

Varnau ""nerff20""","[3, 11]","The vulgar ""Legend of Lemnear"" is one of those anime that gives the Japanese animation is poor reputation of having just sex and violence. But indeed, that's just what ""Lemnear"" has in its very short runtime (almost an hour). The plot vaguely consists of a chosen one set out to free her people, or some such nonsense. The film has no sense of character nor direction and mostly consists of animation that is subpar for the genre and useless plot devices that might be good in another movie. What the film does develop is sex and nudity. True, much anime has these two, but plenty still keeps a strong story going...

Too bad that this 45 minute &quot;movie&quot; has bad dubbing, not much of a plot, and shallow characters. But, it's done by Satoshi Urushihara, so you can except some really detailed visuals and a good deal of nudity. The theme song is also good, as is the background music, although it tends to drop in and out of tune every ten seconds or so. I don't know if it's just my copy. The last fight against Veroll and his four (!) forms was actually pretty cool, and had a sweet background song to it, audio problems aside. But as it stands, it's too short.
