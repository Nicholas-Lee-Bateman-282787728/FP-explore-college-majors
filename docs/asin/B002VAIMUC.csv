Munro,"[0, 0]","The plot re-tells the story of the founder of the Soto Zen sect of Japan beginning with his mother's plea that he discover the cause of suffering and help his fellow Japanese.  Some knowledge of Buddhism would make the film more accessible.It's helpful to remember that the time period (12th - 13th century) was the early stages of a long period of civil war in Japan.  After the relatively peaceful Heian Period, the wars between leading families to gain control of the country, consumed much of the country's history until the end of the 16th century when Ieyasu Tokugawa finally triumphed over all his rivals.  It's probably no coincidence that Zen in its various forms took hold, especially among the samurai class, at this time.There are early scenes of Dogen's journey to China to search for the true dharma teaching, until he finally meets the monk who introduces him to Chan Buddhism (the Chinese form of Zen).The plot takes a few liberties to create a love interest between a former prostitute and one of the monks who accepts Dogen's challenge, but as a viewer glide past that bit of quirkiness.  The film's representation of Zen life in a monastery and the dangers faced by all Buddhist monks who tried to dodge the political dangers of the time seems very realistic.",5,A very moving film,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,1278,"['plot', 'story', 'founder', 'Soto', 'Zen', 'sect', 'Japan', 'beginning', 'mother', 'plea', 'cause', 'suffering', 'help', 'fellow', 'Japanese', 'knowledge', 'Buddhism', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'accessible.It', 'helpful', 'remember', 'time', 'period', '12th', '13th', 'century', 'was', 'early', 'stages', 'long', 'period', 'civil', 'war', 'Japan', 'relatively', 'peaceful', 'Heian', 'Period', 'wars', 'leading', 'families', 'gain', 'control', 'country', 'consumed', 'much', 'country', 'history', 'end', '16th', 'century', 'when', 'Ieyasu', 'Tokugawa', 'finally', 'triumphed', 'rivals', 'probably', 'coincidence', 'Zen', 'various', 'forms', 'took', 'hold', 'especially', 'samurai', 'class', 'are', 'early', 'scenes', 'Dogen', 'journey', 'China', 'search', 'true', 'dharma', 'teaching', 'finally', 'monk', 'who', 'Chan', 'Buddhism', 'Chinese', 'form', 'Zen', '.The', 'plot', 'few', 'liberties', 'create', 'love', 'interest', 'former', 'prostitute', 'one', 'monks', 'who', 'accepts', 'Dogen', 'challenge', 'viewer', 'glide', 'bit', 'quirkiness', 'film', 'representation', 'Zen', 'life', 'monastery', 'dangers', 'faced', 'Buddhist', 'monks', 'who', 'tried', 'dodge', 'political', 'dangers', 'time', 'very', 'realistic']",N/A
