1620677,ASEMV95I6RNXD,B00B04NIZO,AP,"[5, 22]","I made the mistake of trusting the reviews on Amazon.com (which are usually really good/accurate; I buy a ton of movies & other stuff on Amazon), but the acting is actually unwatchable -- every single actor is bad. It could be just a poor script & bad dialogue. There's an over-the-top werewolf that howls and acts like a horny toad, the trolls are goofy and stupid and stumble around and act like clueless, inner-city gangsters, plus there's a talking dog that's really third-rate, etc. The dialogue is atrocious; it's over-acted and just bad, bad, film-making. Reminds me of a late-night B movie that would make you groan. It may have an all-star cast (that's what tricked me; tons of award winners and I like fantasy & it had good reviews) plus it has a lot of disks (7+ hours) so seemed like a good value, but we couldn't even make it past 1-2 hours of the film. Kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. It's not even good for kids, as the heroine's father uses profanity (&#34;kiss my ass,&#34; etc.) and has a magic fridge with beer falling out of it, etc. and other things that wouldn't really be good for kids. I own top-notch fantasy/action like Lord of the Rings, Matrix, X-Men, Star Trek, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Dune, Chronicles of Riddick, Chronicles of Narnia, and many more.

1620687,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B00B04NIZO,Charity Bishop,"[0, 0]","From talking mirrors to magic beans, werewolves, wishing wells, and troll dust, The 10th Kingdom is an experience you'll never forget. With an all-star cast, incredible special effects by Artisan and a truly unique premise, this modern-day fairy tale will cast a spell over the entire family. It involves laughter, tears, many valuable lessons, and a shocking plot twist. This kind of modern blend between The Princess Bride and Snow White hasn't been successfully done until now... but Hallmark pulls it off with kid gloves.Perky, blue-eyed Virginia Lewis (Kimberly Williams) lives on the edge of Central Park within biking distance of her workplace, a half-rate diner where she spends most of her time. Her father Anthony (John Larroquette), once a successful businessman, is now an underpaid, overworked and often ill-treated janitor at their apartment building. The two share a boring existence, barely standing one another and desiring for a more exciting life. Virginia has resigned herself to the fact that this desire will never come true... but little does she know the adventure that is about to envelope them all in mystery, magic, and danger. The 9 Kingdoms have lived in peace since the imprisonment of the Evil Queen, Prince Wendell White's stepmother. But with the young and selfish prince's coronation forthcoming, he has been asked to make the rounds of his province, including a routine visit to the prison. The Queen (Dianne Wiest) has awaited this moment and formulates a daring plan with the aid of the Troll King.Wendell's manservant is murdered and the prince himself is imprisoned in the body of a dog, stripped of his rights and his voice. In his place, the Queen places an imposter... her doggy friend (Daniel Lapaine). But her plans go terribly wrong when the dog manages to escape into the cellars, and from there through a magic mirror into modern-day New York. After him she sends Burley, Blabberwort, and Bluebell, along with one of the prison inmates, a werewolf imprisoned for 'sheep worrying' (played by Scott Cohen). Prince leaps out of the mirror into the Park at the precise moment Virginia speeds by on her bike. There is a violent collision and she takes the dog with her to work, little knowing a pack of strange magical creatures will soon be on her trail. After that point, strange things begin to happen to Virginia... from a dog that seems to want to tell her something to three trolls who invade her home, terrorize her father, and steal her shoes, and even to a insane guy who breaks into her grandma's apartment and tries to cook her.Through a series of comical and unexplainable events, Virginia, Tony, and Prince are forced to flee through the mirror and into the 9 Kingdoms where nothing is as it seems... talking mushrooms, wishing wells, invisibility shoes, poisoned apples, talking birds, evil huntsmen, and fairy-tale creatures run rampant, from a 200-year-old Cinderella to the Tooth Fairy. Unknown to all, the Queen has continued with her plans to overthrow the kingdom, seizing the magic mirrors that once belonged to Snow White's evil stepmother. Through them she can rule the world, and continue where her predecessor left off: by destroying the House of White. All Virginia wants to do is return to her normal life in New York, but each step takes them further from the mirror and deeper into this imperial intrigue. Although she and Tony may believe their only duty is to locate the mirror once more, they are in reality being guided by an unseen force... and their destiny is tied to that of Prince Wendell and his evil stepmother.It has suddenly become a dangerous game of hidden priorities and Virginia must learn to trust her instincts as they are joined by Wolf. Someone or something is keeping them safe from the Evil Queen, but it cannot last forever. Magic, mayhem, and mystery abound in this eight-hour television epic who now has one of the largest followings of any miniseries ever produced. The story is alive with myth, humor, and surprisingly two-dimensional characters while packing every gag, fairy tale character, and pun ever invented into a hilariously amusing story with a surprisingly dynamic climax. If you can't see the humor in the werewolves, elves, fairies, trolls, dwarves and blind woodsmen that traipse across the screen, you won't understand the messages that the film also has to offer about family, friendship, loving compassion, and forgiveness.There are numerous scenes involving a huntsman whose arrows never fail to pierce the heart of a living creature. People are killed by arrows, knifed, attacked by trolls, physically abused with punches and kicks, and poisoned. There are several instances where violence is hinted at but not seen. One chilling instance of a character's past is revealed in which a parent attempted to purposely drown them as a child; this may arouse further caution in wary viewers, since it pits child against parent, which in turn involves some emotionally-intense scenes and pieces of dialogue. Language is mild but does include minor abuses of deity. There is some sensuality played through innuendos, a suggestive shepherdess, and a scene handled delicately in the woods where two characters tousle. They giggle, nip, and roll around before the camera cuts out, returning to find them straggling into camp disheveled and exhausted. (Later one implies they'll have to get married to give their child a proper upbringing.) The first hour in New York is the most squeamish content-wise thanks to Tony, but if you can get past that, you've cleared the most major hurtle. Magic is made much of but is usually on the side of evil. Wolf makes one thought-provoking remark about magic: 'The more you use it, the more you want it.'Viewers should also be aware of several scenes that may frighten or concern younger children. Virginia, Tony, and Wolf have their fortunes told by a gypsy, but the tables turn when the old woman then purposefully places a curse on the heroine. The Queen seeks guidance from Snow White's evil stepmother by visiting her grave. (Whether or not the former Evil Queen is actually dead or not is unknown; but she does move on occasion and speak.) There are numerous instances where the characters are attacked unexpectedly, and lives are placed in peril. (To be fair, most of these scenes are also laced with irony and laugh-aloud humor.) I liked the production for more than just amazing special effects, a dozen laughs a minute, and some memorable characters. The premise appealed to me merely for the psychological struggle that went on in each of the characters. For Virginia it's a painful loss from her childhood. For Tony it's realizing where he has failed at being a father. For Wolf it's choosing the path of right or wrong and perhaps sacrificing himself in the process. And Prince learns the true meaning of leadership and responsibility. Even the Queen has a few things to face. The humor lightens what is in actuality a very deep and emotional drama flowing under the pretense of fairy tale likeness.The production is a captivating and highly entertaining saga of mystery, magic, and romance that actually leaves you with something to think about. Hidden beneath the silliness are true lessons about learning to trust yourself and others, forgiveness, not fleeing from your problems, and being courageous even when the stakes are down. Now that's magic.",4,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,7409,"['talking', 'mirrors', 'magic', 'beans', 'werewolves', 'wishing', 'wells', 'troll', 'dust', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'experience',

1620689,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B00B04NIZO,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[1, 1]","Before One Upon A Time magically dazzled the television screens, there was an underrated miniseries called The 10th Kingdom that aired in five-parts on NBC in February 2000. With a stunning cast with Diane West, Ed O'Neill, Camryn Manheim, John Larroquette, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Ann-Margret, Rutger Hauer, and Scott Cohen, one would think this lavish event would be a ratings goldmine, but sadly it received low-ratings despite the fact that it garnered good reviews from critics and viewers.The miniseries was previously released onto a single VHS, a two tapes VHS set (several scenes were removed), a three disc DVD set, and later a single double-sided DVD, all which are out-of-print. Mill Creek Entertainment recently released a three disc DVD set of The 10th Kingdom, in which I received a free copy in exchange for my honest review.The 10th Kingdom's plot twisted the classic fairy tales. In the opening, the Evil Queen escapes prison and turns Prince Wendell (the Queen's stepson and the grandson of the late Snow White) into a dog, who quickly escapes through a magic mirror and ends up in modern day New York. The Queen sends Wolf and three trolls after him. The Prince quickly crosses path with a young waitress, Virginia Lewis, along with her janitor father, Anthony Lewis. The Wolf's plans of capturing the prince comes to a halt when he lays eyes on the lovely Virginia, who he instantly falls madly in love with her. He joins Virginia, Anthony, and the Prince when they are forced to into the magic mirror and travel to the Nine Kingdoms. Many dangers and mysteries await them as they try to defeat the wicked queen, restore the Prince back into his body, and find a way home.I watched The 10th Kingdom when it originally aired and I loved it. I bought the single VHS version, but the video quality was horrible. I was thrilled to get a chance to review the DVD version. Over the last few nights I have watched the entire miniseries and it is just as good as I remember it. My favorite is the part 3 with Lucy Punch as Sally Peep, but I also like everything else about it. As a bonus there is a Making-of Featurette. The video quality is great, except for the twenty-odd-seconds of waviness in the part one scene with Virginia and the Prince in the restaurant's kitchen, but it didn't persuade me from not giving this DVD release a 5 out of 5.",5,A Magical Escape,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,2363,"['One', 'Time', 'magically', 'dazzled', 'television', 'screens', 'was', 'underrated', 'miniseries', 'called', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'aired', 'five-parts', 'NBC', 'February', '2000', 'stunning', 'cast', 'Diane', 'West', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'Kimberly', 'Williams-Paisley', 'Ann-Margret', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Scott', 'Cohen', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'lavish', 'event', 'would', 'be', 'ratings', 'goldmine', 'sadly', 'received', 'low-ratings', 'fact', 'garnered', 'good', 'reviews', 'critics', 'viewers.The', 'miniseries', 'was', 'previously', 'released', 'single', 'VHS', 'two', 'tapes', 'VHS', 'set', 'several', 'scenes', 'were', 'removed', 'three', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'later', 'single', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'are', 'out-of-print', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'recently', 'released', 'three', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'received', 'free', 'copy', 'exchange', 'honest', 'review.The', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'plot', 'twisted', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tales', 'opening', 'Evil', 'Queen', 'prison', 'Prince', 'Wendell', 'Queen', 'stepson', 'grandson', 'late', 'Snow', 'White', 'dog', 'who', 'quickly', 'magic', 'mirror', 'up', 'modern', 'day', 'New', 'York', 'Queen', 'Wolf', 'three', 'trolls', 'Prince', 'quickly', 'path', 'young', 'waitress', 'Virginia', 'Lewis', 'janitor', 'father', 'Anthony', 'Lewis', 'Wolf', 'plans', 'capturing', 'prince', 'halt', 'when', 'eyes', 'lovely', 'Virginia', 'who', 'instantly', 'madly', 'love', 'Virginia', 'Anthony', 'Prince', 'when', 'are', 'forced', 'magic', 'mirror', 'travel', 'Nine', 'Kingdoms', 'Many', 'dangers', 'mysteries', 'await', 'try', 'defeat', 'wicked', 'queen', 'restore', 'Prince', 'back', 'body', 'find', 'way', 'home.I', 'watched', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'loved', 'bought', 'single', 'VHS', 'version', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', 'thrilled', 'get', 'chance', 'review', 'DVD', 'version', 'last', 'few', 'nights', 'have', 'watched', 'entire', 'miniseries', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'favorite', 'part', '3', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'Sally', 'Peep', 'also', 'everything', 'else', 'bonus', 'Making-of', 'Featurette', 'video', 'quality', 'great', 'twenty-odd-seconds', 'waviness', 'part', 'one', 'scene', 'Virginia', 'Prince', 'restaurant', 'kitchen', 'did', ""n't"", 'persuade', 'not', 'giving', 'DVD', 'release', '5', '5']",10th Kingdom - The Epic Miniseries Event

Hennes ""Joe Tenor""","[9, 11]","I have to admit I bought this because of the high rating here on Amazon, and after viewing consider myself somewhat deceived.  Don't get me wrong, it is not awful, it just isn't great.  The acting is *extremely* heavy handed, across the board, often so much so that it pulled me right out of the story.  Once again, don't get me wrong, not saying the actors are not talented.  They were ALL hamming it up and overacting which means it is a direction issue not an actor issue.I also find myself astounded that apparently no one has an issue with the plot.  (Spoilers)One of the main story lines is that Virginia is too uptight and not trusting because of her desertion by her mother when she was a child.  OK, I am cool with that.  I am not cool with the idea her not having a boyfriend at the ripe old age of 22 is ""bad"".  I am not cool with the ""resolution"" of her issues being for her to have unprotected sex and end up pregnant by a man who has demonstrated time and time again that he is not very bright and has difficulty being decisive, reliable, or trustworthy.  Wolfy is not a character you want anywhere near your daughter.  Ever.  Yes, I know, he rushed in to save the day on the mushroom island, and helps defeat the evil queen in the end.  But his motives were still entirely selfish; it's all about him.  His character does not grow up, at all.  Throughout the whole series I knew the two were going to end up together, and the whole time I kept thinking, ""She can't really fall for this loser, can she?""  Or ""How are they going to make Wolfy someone a grown intelligent woman should want to be with?""  Ladies, before you get all up in arms ask yourself if you would even date a guy like Wolfy, I mean really.  Seriously, some of you probably have and regret it.The troll children were good comic relief, but I am glad they spent a while as a statue.The best performances were by Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Daniel Lapaine.  I especially liked the shepherdess competition.  The other characters pretty much remained one dimensional throughout the seven hours.  Once again not the actors; the direction or writing or both.  Rutger Hauer is one of my favorite actors, and there is no question that he is a great actor, but you would not know that from watching ""The Tenth Kingdom"".The opening credits are amazing, and I was not surprised to find they won an Emmy.  Ms. Stockley has an amazing and beautiful voice.  I actually went look to find the ""whole"" song from the opening and was quite disappointed to learn that what you hear in the credits is the whole song.I give it three stars, and I think that is generous.

I wish they had done the case a little different as the first disk is on one of those pieces that snaps in and of course it was broke when I opened it but whatever. Love the series. I haven't watch the disk yet so I can't tell you about the quality of the picture and if it's improved from when it was on VHS but for the price? Come on. I would have bought in Blu-ray and still might if they ever bother to come out in Blu-ray but either way I'm really very happy with this purchase. This series is great, I watched it when I was a teen and my niece did when she was just a kid. Of course we had to break it down as it's a mini-series and it's several hours long but that's okay. Definitely recommend it to adults, kids, and teens alike. As far as what it's about? Well I recommend watching the trailer on youtube or the like as that will help more than anything I can say. Either way it's a low price and really very enjoyable.

1620712,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00B04NIZO,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[17, 19]","Until the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, this movie may have been the most complex fantasy ever attempted.  In some ways the story rambles, but the intricate elements are woven together so coherently that they smoothly fit into the quest undertaken by the principal characters.Virginia and her father Tony Lewis (Kimberly Williams and John Larroquette) live in a New York apartment.  One day a dog enters Virginia's life.  However, the dog is not just any ordinary dog, but Prince Wendell (Daniel Lapaine) changed into a dog by an evil Queen (Dianne Wiest).  Soon trolls enter the picture along with magic, and the story is launched.Virginia and Tony travel through a magic mirror into the land of the nine kingdoms (with New York being the 10th kingdom).  It takes Virginia and Tony little time to realize that the world they have entered has very different rules from their own.  Their goal is to find a mirror that will allow them to travel back to their own world; the quest for the mirror forms the heart of the story.As Virginia and Tony seek for a way back, they are both are on a voyage of discovery about themselves, though Virginia has much more to learn about her life than Tony does about his.  Through a series of vignettes they learn the history of the nine kingdoms, and learn there are mysteries related to that history.  One of the most startling revelations is that Virginia and Tony are somehow involved in the nine kingdoms, but it's not until we get well into the movie that we understand the nature of their involvement.The plot is generally coherent and I had little trouble keeping track of the parallel stories.  I admit that there were a few things that confused me when I watched the story in its original television debut, but my confusion was cleared up by watching the DVD version without the commercials and all in one 7+ hour sitting.The acting talent in this movie is phenomenal.  Rutger Hauer plays the Queen's woodsman, with his own poignant story.  Warwick Davis is Acorn, a criminal with a tongue-in-cheek character.  Ed O'Neil is perfect as Relish the Troll King.  Scott Cohen as Wolf took a little getting used to, but once I realized how he fit into the story I enjoyed his antics and characterization.  Camryn Manheim makes an interesting Snow White.  Ann-Margret brings class to Queen Cinderella.  This list is but a fraction of the cast possible by the epic nature of this movie.The story is an adult fairy tale.  This movie includes violence, intense scenes, and some sexual content that is likely inappropriate for children below the age of 7 or 8 and perhaps for some older children.  However, for everyone else this movie is fun and complicated.  If you enjoy fantasy, and you can be open-minded about how fantasy is approached, this movie could be perfect for you.",5,Complex Adult Epic Fantasy,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,2810,"['Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'complex', 'fantasy', 'ever', 'attempted', 'ways', 'story', 'rambles', 'intricate', 'elements', 'are', 'woven', 'together', 'so', 'coherently', 'smoothly', 'fit', 'quest', 'undertaken', 'principal', 'characters.Virginia', 'father', 'Tony', 'Lewis', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'One', 'day', 'dog', 'Virginia', 'life', 'However', 'dog', 'not', 'just', 'ordinary', 'dog', 'Prince', 'Wendell', 'Daniel', 'Lapaine', 'changed', 'dog', 'evil', 'Queen', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Soon', 'trolls', 'enter', 'picture', 'magic', 'story', 'launched.Virginia', 'Tony', 'travel', 'magic', 'mirror', 'land', 'nine', 'kingdoms', 'New', 'York', 'being', '10th', 'kingdom', 'Virginia', 'Tony', 'little', 'time', 'realize', 'world', 'have', 'entered', 'very', 'different', 'rules', 'own', 'goal', 'find', 'mirror', 'will', 'allow', 'travel', 'back', 'own', 'world', 'quest', 'mirror', 'heart', 'story.As', 'Virginia', 'Tony', 'seek', 'way', 'back', 'are', 'are', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'though', 'Virginia', 'much', 'more', 'learn', 'life', 'Tony', 'series', 'vignettes', 'learn', 'history', 'nine', 'kingdoms', 'learn', 'are', 'mysteries', 'related', 'history', 'One', 'most', 'startling', 'revelations', 'Virginia', 'Tony', 'are', 'somehow', 'involved', 'nine', 'kingdoms', 'not', 'get', 'well', 'movie', 'understand', 'nature', 'involvement.The', 'plot', 'generally', 'coherent', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'track', 'parallel', 'stories', 'admit', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'confused', 'when', 'watched', 'story', 'original', 'television', 'debut', 'confusion', 'was', 'cleared', 'up', 'watching', 'DVD', 'version', 'commercials', 'one', '7+', 'hour', 'sitting.The', 'acting', 'talent', 'movie', 'phenomenal', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Queen', 'woodsman', 'own', 'poignant', 'story', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'Acorn', 'criminal', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'character', 'Ed', ""O'Neil"", 'perfect', 'Relish', 'Troll', 'King', 'Scott', 'Cohen', 'Wolf', 'took', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'once', 'realized', 'how', 'fit', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'antics', 'characterization', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'interesting', 'Snow', 'White', 'Ann-Margret', 'brings', 'class', 'Queen', 'Cinderella', 'list', 'fraction', 'cast', 'possible', 'epic', 'nature', 'movie.The', 'story', 'adult', 'fairy', 'tale', 'movie', 'violence', 'intense', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'content', 'likely', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'age', '7', '8', 'perhaps', 'older', 'children', 'However', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'fun', 'complicated', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'can', 'be', 'open-minded', 'how', 'fantasy', 'approached', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'perfect']",10th Kingdom - The Epic Miniseries Event

I remembered that I had really liked it when I saw it on the tube so purchased it.  I was not disappointed.  This film has held up well over the last thirteen years.  Even the CGI  still looks good.  I believe that the CGI still works because it enhances rather than dominates the film.  I want a ring that sings.  This is a modern adult fairy tale with lots of clever twists on the old stories we all grew up with.  The characters are well written and played by and outstanding cast in some fine costumes and imaginative makeup. The trolls are abfab baddies.  The tooth fairy is a dentist.  People in this tale are a complete.  No one is simply good or evil.  Queens, princes, trolls, wolves all have a flip side.  This series is much better than the current crop of fairy tale knock offs.  I highly recommend this film to an audience of adults and older teens.  If you have no other reason to buy this film get it for the opening credits that turn New York City into fairyland.  Since the film was made in 2000 you can still see the World Trade Center in the credits.
