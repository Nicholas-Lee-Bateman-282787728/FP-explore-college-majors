1606839,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00A8KJMP6,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[67, 68]","It is so sad that we have only 12 episodes spread across the three series of Garrows Law. Whilst this box set is to be welcomed it is also a matter of regret that the perverse decision was made to axe this very successful programme. What is particularly fascinating is that Sir William Garrow was a real historical figure in the UK. The writers of these programmes have clearly made a real effort to ensure that the episodes accord with what is known of his personal life. Additionally every episode is based on a true case from the annals of the Old Bailey in London, although not necessarily one with which Garrow was involved. Hence they provide an insight into the workings of the law a little over two hundred years ago.Garrow is not as widely known as he deserves. Whilst this series covers the earlier part of his career when he was a barrister, he was also a Kings Counsel prosecuting cases, although he appears here as the defending counsel. Latterly he became a politician, rising to the post of Solicitor General and confirmed his forward thinking by, amongst other credentials, supporting animal rights which was quite a departure in the first part of the 19th century. This was a time when human rights were fairly generally ignored! The cases which are included in this series are interesting and varied and if you google the details of any of them, you will be able to verify that they were actual cases at the Old Bailey. Here Garrow is the champion of the accused and it is an interesting fact that he originated the phrase 'innocent until proved guilty'. He is also credited with originating the adversarial system of justice, in use in most Western countries with forthright cross examination of witnesses.Garrow's rather complicated personal life is also based on what happened in real life. He had a long term relationship and later married Sarah, who had previously had a relationship with a Viscount. The script writer has had to fill in the gaps, however, the significant facts which can be checked out are correct. Hence this series portrays both the working life and personal life of a highly significant historical figure in an authentic manner. Andrew Buchan puts in an impressive performance in the leading role, but mention should also be made of Alun Armstrong who is very convincing as John Southouse.It was always a valid criticism of Garrows Law that the series were so short, comprising just four episodes in each. Therefore this DVD set contains just 12 episodes, four from each of the three series. Brief though it is, it provides a fascinating insight into the workings of the UK justice system in the early 19th Century, with the added interest that it is largely based on fact.",5,Premature End of an Excellent Series,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,2717,"['so', 'sad', 'have', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'spread', 'three', 'series', 'Garrows', 'Law', 'Whilst', 'box', 'set', 'be', 'welcomed', 'also', 'matter', 'regret', 'perverse', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'axe', 'very', 'successful', 'programme', 'What', 'particularly', 'fascinating', 'Sir', 'William', 'Garrow', 'was', 'real', 'historical', 'figure', 'UK', 'writers', 'programmes', 'have', 'clearly', 'made', 'real', 'effort', 'ensure', 'episodes', 'accord', 'what', 'known', 'personal', 'life', 'Additionally', 'episode', 'based', 'true', 'case', 'annals', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'London', 'not', 'necessarily', 'one', 'Garrow', 'was', 'involved', 'Hence', 'provide', 'insight', 'workings', 'law', 'little', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago.Garrow', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'Whilst', 'series', 'earlier', 'part', 'career', 'when', 'was', 'barrister', 'was', 'also', 'Kings', 'Counsel', 'prosecuting', 'cases', 'here', 'defending', 'counsel', 'Latterly', 'became', 'politician', 'rising', 'post', 'Solicitor', 'General', 'confirmed', 'forward', 'thinking', 'other', 'credentials', 'supporting', 'animal', 'rights', 'was', 'quite', 'departure', 'first', 'part', '19th', 'century', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'human', 'rights', 'were', 'fairly', 'generally', 'ignored', 'cases', 'are', 'included', 'series', 'are', 'interesting', 'varied', 'google', 'details', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'verify', 'were', 'actual', 'cases', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'Here', 'Garrow', 'champion', 'accused', 'interesting', 'fact', 'originated', 'phrase', ""'innocent"", 'proved', 'guilty', 'also', 'credited', 'originating', 'adversarial', 'system', 'justice', 'use', 'most', 'Western', 'countries', 'forthright', 'cross', 'examination', 'witnesses.Garrow', 'rather', 'complicated', 'personal', 'life', 'also', 'based', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'later', 'married', 'Sarah', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'had', 'relationship', 'Viscount', 'script', 'writer', 'had', 'fill', 'gaps', 'however', 'significant', 'facts', 'can', 'be', 'checked', 'out', 'are', 'correct', 'Hence', 'series', 'working', 'life', 'personal', 'life', 'highly', 'significant', 'historical', 'figure', 'authentic', 'manner', 'Andrew', 'Buchan', 'impressive', 'performance', 'leading', 'role', 'mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'very', 'convincing', 'John', 'Southouse.It', 'was', 'always', 'valid', 'criticism', 'Garrows', 'Law', 'series', 'were', 'so', 'short', 'comprising', 'just', 'four', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'set', 'just', '12', 'episodes', 'four', 'three', 'series', 'Brief', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'workings', 'UK', 'justice', 'system', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'added', 'interest', 'largely', 'based', 'fact']",GARROW'S LAW: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION

If you've not purchased all or part individually, then this is the opportunity. Every episode is 5-star worthy, if not more. This is a set containing 12 great movie-length stories.Historical drama is done to the excellence level of ""Foyle's War."" British courtroom drama from 1792. This series won a ""Best History"" award. It is absolute perfection in late-18th century historical reproduction in sets, costumes, & dialogue. Plots, cases, and people are from real British history of criminal court--""The Old Bailey."" Rumpole of the Bailey made this court popular on TV, but this series now documents TRUE historical beginnings of criminal justice for the accused. Even some of the dialogue was taken from court records. It was Sir William Garrow (1760-1840) who lead the way and coined: ""Innocent until proven guilty."" He was accepted to the bar in 1783. In real life, and the TV series, he is idealistic, a Robin Hood for the poor and unfairly arrested. He is young, eager, wayward, belligerent, rash, arrogant, inexperienced, loud, but often a winner. This set resembles the poor depicted in Catherine Cookson TV adaptations--a must own series as well.Excellent cast:Andrew Buchan (Cranford) is Garrow, in looks and attitude. He could be played no better.Lyndsey Marshall (Being Human) plays Lady Sarah Hill, exquisite in acting as well as filling her delightful period aristocracy costumes.Alun Armstrong (Little Dorrit, New Tricks) plays the true-to-history character, John Southouse, Garrow's mentor, a solicitor (attorney).Michael Culkin (The Hours, Lolita) is Judge Buller, mostly ruthless.Rupert Graves (Forsyte Sage, Death at a Funeral-see the UK version) plays MP Sir Arthur, Sarah's spouse.Aidan McArdle (The Duchess, Ella Enchanted) is another REAL historical figure, John Silvester, a proud, rich, barrister who constantly opposes Garrow.Costumes astound in their sumptuous accuracy. Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Glasgow were filming sites. Music is as fine as the interior sets. Dynamic dialogue offers periodic comedy. This is more like a historical documentary than TV drama. The presentation is suspenseful, dramatic, and as finely done as anything on today's TV schedule.Not just 5 stars, but PLATNUM STARS.12 SUBTITLED feature-length episodes plus plenty of bonus as good as the features.You'll see guest stars.

This is based on a true story and legal cases from the late 1700's ~ still very relevant for today.The young, barrister apprentice William Garrow decided to change the legal system from the corrupt entertainment spectacle to a system seeking the truth and justice.Often to appease the masses, poor innocent people were arrested with no counsel. People were paid off or made deals to give false testimony and/or evidence. This included judges, prosecutors, accusers and witnesses. As Mr. Garrow saw this while studying courtroom procedures, he was shocked and committed to see justice served.It also shows how Sarah Hill a woman who also wanted a healthy and just change, was limited by social standards, but did what she could to support and contribute to the historical shift in trials, the handling of evidence and the accused.The stories include court cases researched from the Old Bailey archives.
