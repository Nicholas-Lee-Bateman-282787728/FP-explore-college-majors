The parts with originality, such as the twist near the end, are the redeeming aspects that give the movie a little something to enjoy.  I barely kept watching this movie, and only because I bought it and felt obligated to watch the entire thing, and also because I was bored and had some time.  I don't recommend this movie, even if you like Miley Cyrus.  She's not very convincing as a tough girl who's used to doing undercover jobs, and maybe this is because I've seen her as Hanna Montana in the past.  If you want to watch it, I'd say rent it, don't buy it.

It does, despite itself, surprise.Rest assured there are plenty of forgettable jokes at the expense of stupid rich girls, and those one or two which find their mark raise chuckles rather than guffaws.There were guffaws, though - I don't mind admitting I had a couple - and they came almost, but not quite, in spite of the script.Sometimes plot developments were too absurd not to laugh, but director Tom Vaughan is knowing enough to realise this - the entire picture presents itself with a cheeky wink - so he deserves credit for them.But mostly, So Undercover gets away through sheer bravura and energetic performances from likeable stars. Miley Cyrus, with whose oeuvre I'm not intimately familiar, has a whale of a time with the lead, as does Jeremy Piven, who seems not to act in any noticeable way at all: Arman, his character might as well be Ari Gold, who, I imagine, might as well be Jeremy Piven.Elsewhere Joshua Bowman and Mike O'Malley lend such admirable support it's hard not to be badgered into liking this film.One chap in the cinema even applauded, though I think that was a step too far.Olly Buxton",3,Likeable romp as long as you keep your expectations low,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,1577,"['Expectations', 'are', 'funny', 'things.Only', 'fool', 'would', 'have', 'rom-com', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'playing', 'FBI', 'agent', 'deep', 'cover', 'sorority', 'house', 'Even', 'fool', 'would', 'set', 'lower', 'when', 'title', 'as', 'witless', 'So', 'Undercover', 'might', 'adjust', 'marginally', 'back', 'upwards', 'film', 'also', 'Entourage', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'daughter', 'Kelly.And', 'terms', 'So', 'Undercover', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'surprise.Rest', 'assured', 'are', 'plenty', 'forgettable', 'jokes', 'expense', 'stupid', 'rich', 'girls', 'one', 'two', 'find', 'mark', 'raise', 'chuckles', 'rather', 'guffaws.There', 'were', 'guffaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'admitting', 'had', 'couple', 'came', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'spite', 'script.Sometimes', 'plot', 'developments', 'were', 'too', 'absurd', 'not', 'laugh', 'director', 'Tom', 'Vaughan', 'knowing', 'enough', 'realise', 'entire', 'picture', 'cheeky', 'wink', 'so', 'credit', 'them.But', 'mostly', 'So', 'Undercover', 'away', 'sheer', 'bravura', 'energetic', 'performances', 'likeable', 'stars', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'oeuvre', ""'m"", 'not', 'intimately', 'familiar', 'whale', 'time', 'lead', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'who', 'not', 'act', 'noticeable', 'way', 'Arman', 'character', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'who', 'imagine', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'Jeremy', 'Piven.Elsewhere', 'Joshua', 'Bowman', 'Mike', ""O'Malley"", 'lend', 'such', 'admirable', 'support', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'badgered', 'liking', 'film.One', 'chap', 'cinema', 'even', 'applauded', 'think', 'was', 'step', 'too', 'far.Olly', 'Buxton']",So Undercover

I did feel the script was good, but the direction wasn't there. Miley can act, but she is no martial artist. In this movie she supposed to be great at it, but she doesn't do anything! She never had a single fight and she only was in one conflict, where the guy was tied up already? BS!What they needed to do, if they wanted to say how great a martial artist Miley was actually show it. To do that she would really had to train in it and made scenes where they can show some of it off...not a crazy amount, just a bit for someone not to say BS!!! But, NO! You get nothing! They could had even used stunt doubles and with good editing she would look like a Master or something, but NOOOO. Again, nothing was shown. All there was one punch and that's not really martial arts, it's one punch that any body can do and the guy was already tied up to a chair??? So, they shouldn't had even said that she was an amazing fighter.Another thing is the whole love story of the movie. I didn't really feel the chemistry between the two actors. They needed to add in more scenes to make the two looked like they even liked each other.  That whole, I see him/her I'm in love moment, didn't even spark any chemistry and looked more like confusion. Then, scene after scene was just more of the same. It seemed like they rush everything and they just felt they show just throw in some goofy random encounters and that's just spell love. WRONG!!! Throw that fake/dumb stuff out of here.This movie is basically made for teenagers and young kids. You won't like it very much, if you're some what educated and think little dumb blonde jokes are NOT really funny. You see it way too much in this movie.And for all you people that write reviews that gave this movie 5 stars. I see your reviews. I think it's great. Add 1 or 2 sentences more and that's a review. BIG WHOA. No wonder you thought the movie was so worth 5 stars. BTW, I'm being sarcastic. I didn't like them at all. hahahaI don't recommend this movie for anyone that has a brain...........but if you just like seeing Miley, she on the screen the whole time. So, I guess that makes it worth wild - 2 stars!",2,2 stars for Miley,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,2416,"['just', 'seeing', 'Miley', 'think', 'cute', 'pretty', 'Everything', 'else', 'movie', 'hated', 'So', '2', 'stars.This', 'movie', 'okay', 'story', 'line', 'really', ""did't"", 'execute', 'well', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'had', 'done', 'make', 'movie', 'better', 'did', 'feel', 'script', 'was', 'good', 'direction', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'Miley', 'can', 'act', 'martial', 'artist', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'never', 'had', 'single', 'fight', 'only', 'was', 'one', 'conflict', 'where', 'guy', 'was', 'tied', 'up', 'already', 'BS', 'What', 'needed', 'do', 'wanted', 'say', 'how', 'great', 'martial', 'artist', 'Miley', 'was', 'actually', 'show', 'do', 'would', 'really', 'had', 'train', 'made', 'scenes', 'where', 'can', 'show', 'off', 'not', 'crazy', 'amount', 'just', 'bit', 'someone', 'not', 'say', 'BS', 'NO', 'get', 'nothing', 'could', 'had', 'even', 'used', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'good', 'editing', 'would', 'look', 'Master', 'something', 'NOOOO', 'Again', 'nothing', 'was', 'shown', 'was', 'one', 'punch', 'not', 'really', 'martial', 'arts', 'one', 'punch', 'body', 'can', 'do', 'guy', 'was', 'already', 'tied', 'up', 'chair', 'So', 'should', ""n't"", 'had', 'even', 'said', 'was', 'amazing', 'fighter.Another', 'thing', 'whole', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'needed', 'add', 'more', 'scenes', 'make', 'two', 'looked', 'even', 'liked', 'other', 'whole', 'see', 'him/her', ""'m"", 'love', 'moment', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'spark', 'chemistry', 'looked', 'more', 'confusion', 'Then', 'scene', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'same', 'seemed', 'rush', 'everything', 'just', 'felt', 'show', 'just', 'throw', 'goofy', 'random', 'encounters', 'just', 'spell', 'love', 'WRONG', 'Throw', 'fake/dumb', 'stuff', 'here.This', 'movie', 'basically', 'made', 'teenagers', 'young', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', ""'re"", 'what', 'educated', 'think', 'little', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'jokes', 'are', 'NOT', 'really', 'funny', 'see', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'movie.And', 'people', 'write', 'reviews', 'gave', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'see', 'reviews', 'think', 'great', 'Add', '1', '2', 'sentences', 'more', 'review', 'BIG', 'WHOA', 'wonder', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'worth', '5', 'stars', 'BTW', ""'m"", 'being', 'sarcastic', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'hahahaI', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'brain', '..but', 'just', 'seeing', 'Miley', 'screen', 'whole', 'time', 'So', 'guess', 'worth', 'wild', '2', 'stars']",So Undercover

She was ""practically raised by the Dallas police force"" which gives her the superhuman skills and savvy of a woman far older. With her dad in a fix, Molly accepts a job from the FBI (Jeremy Piven) to protect a crime figure's daughter, Alex (Lauren McKnight) who may be a target.Molly goes undercover aka ""Miss Congeniality"" and enters a sorority to get next to Alex. She doesn't quite fit in with this crowd of ""plastics"" which makes for the fun of the film. And of course Molly develops a love interest. The story has a nice twist too.This is a fun film. The acting was a little cheesy by design. There is humor in the film, poking fun at the younger generation's language and mannerisms. Weak outtakes during the end credits. This is Miley Cyrus who is no Jennifer Lawrence and thankfully no Kristen Stewart.
