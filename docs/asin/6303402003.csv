372852,A4R9MJFF8UFND,6303402003,Brian Camp,"[5, 5]","BAOH is a compact anime sci-fi action thriller about a teenaged boy injected with ""Baoh,"" a parasitic worm which gives him a series of steadily accelerating super powers and bio-engineered weapons which he uses to defend himself against the onslaught of agents and assassins sent to kill him after he escapes from a top secret corporate-government project. Made in 1989, it has exactly the kind of detailed and boldly drawn comic book-style illustration and fluidly animated scenes of violent action that make so much anime of the mid-to-late 1980s so distinctive. When the boy goes into defensive ""Baoh"" mode, he dispatches his heavily-armed pursuers in the most spectacularly gory fashion this side of NINJA SCROLL. For those who need a break from such carnage there are scenes with the boy's cute and spunky sidekick, Sumire, a nine-year-old girl whose psychic powers make her a target of the bad guys as well. When the girl is eventually abducted and held hostage, ""Baoh"" launches a one-man assault on the organization's secret headquarters.My only complaint is that, as a single OAV volume running just under 47 minutes, it's way too short. It's based on a manga that was published in English (by Viz) in two volumes and it follows the look of the manga and the overall storyline very closely. The anime leaves out various incidents that would have filled out the story, explained things a little more, and given it a little more depth. If they'd simply filmed everything in the manga they would have had a very satisfying 90-to-100-minute feature-length film or two-part OAV. Still, it's a consistently enjoyable work for fans of this genre and one which rates repeat viewings.",4,Solid anime thriller with sci-fi theme and nonstop action,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,1683,"['BAOH', 'compact', 'anime', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'thriller', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'injected', 'Baoh', 'parasitic', 'worm', 'series', 'steadily', 'accelerating', 'super', 'powers', 'bio-engineered', 'weapons', 'defend', 'onslaught', 'agents', 'assassins', 'sent', 'kill', 'top', 'secret', 'corporate-government', 'project', 'Made', '1989', 'exactly', 'kind', 'detailed', 'boldly', 'drawn', 'comic', 'book-style', 'illustration', 'fluidly', 'animated', 'scenes', 'violent', 'action', 'make', 'so', 'much', 'anime', 'mid-to-late', '1980s', 'so', 'distinctive', 'When', 'boy', 'defensive', 'Baoh', 'mode', 'heavily-armed', 'pursuers', 'most', 'spectacularly', 'gory', 'fashion', 'side', 'NINJA', 'SCROLL', 'who', 'need', 'break', 'such', 'carnage', 'are', 'scenes', 'boy', 'cute', 'spunky', 'sidekick', 'Sumire', 'nine-year-old', 'girl', 'psychic', 'powers', 'make', 'target', 'bad', 'guys', 'well', 'When', 'girl', 'eventually', 'abducted', 'held', 'hostage', 'Baoh', 'one-man', 'assault', 'organization', 'secret', 'headquarters.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'that', 'single', 'OAV', 'volume', 'running', 'just', '47', 'minutes', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'based', 'manga', 'was', 'published', 'English', 'Viz', 'two', 'volumes', 'look', 'manga', 'overall', 'storyline', 'very', 'closely', 'anime', 'out', 'various', 'incidents', 'would', 'have', 'filled', 'out', 'story', 'explained', 'things', 'little', 'more', 'given', 'little', 'more', 'depth', ""'d"", 'simply', 'filmed', 'everything', 'manga', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'satisfying', '90-to-100-minute', 'feature-length', 'film', 'two-part', 'OAV', 'Still', 'consistently', 'enjoyable', 'work', 'fans', 'genre', 'one', 'rates', 'repeat', 'viewings']",Ad Police Files:Baoh VHS
372853,A2TZPRWK1WXPCX,6303402003,Cafe,"[1, 2]","There was a plot to this movie, but the point of this movie is not the  plot, but rather the stunning animation (on par with Ninja Scroll) and well  executed fight scenes. Baoh reminds me in some ways of &quot;Guyver&quot;  in that he is an organic superhero with all sorts of fun abilities. It's  somewhat mindless, and as I said before, quite light on the plot and  character development, but surprisingly enjoyable anyway. An interesting  touch is that Baoh apparently cannot speak when transformed, although they  sometimes allow the audience to hear his thoughts.I found the voice  acting average. Both Walken and the head of Doress overacted their parts  terribly, especially the latter, but most of the rest were competent if not  overwhelming. Music was also eminently forgettable, but appropriate for  whatever scene it was in. Also somewhat lacking was character development.  All the characters were pretty much stock for the genre, but I list that as  a neutral factor. If they weren't riveting, at least they weren't boring or  stupid.I said it before, and I'll say it again. As animation goes, it's  one of the best I've ever seen.

BAOH in my opinion, is another good example why i love anime; it has a decent plot although borrowing elements from GUYVER and the movie firestarter. but adds a bit of originality of it's own especially regarding the charcter designs, weapons and powers; i.e. the shooting bees phenomenom(baoh's hair is used as electric particles that shoot out like darts)  and it doesn't hld back when it comes to action, although the gore is a bit gratuitous that one ends up thinking,is baoh a superhero/sci-fi actioner or a horror anime?as for familiar designs, Dr. kasumione resembles G.I. JOE'S Dr. Mindbender, walken is a combination of the tracker from firestarter (played by george c. scott) and one of the mutants from x-men. Durdo has an endoskeleton like the terminator and the three steel masked finacers of Doress look like a certain villian from a certain toyline/comic/carton.the arm saber however is exactly like guyver's and that's where the simularity ends. lolthe DVD is bare bones meaning; no extras but inside the case is a nice filecard which explains baoh and his mysterious powers along with song lyrics speaking of which; the original japanese version of soldier is way better than the english song.the english dub from the dvd isn't bad, but the cheesy song ""can't stop loving you"" has got to go!!!it does not blend into the dark superhero thriller world of BAOH.INCLOSNG the animaton still holds up even 15 years later. thanks to th talented folks o toho/shinshuiea (FIST OF THE NORTHSTAR and ANGELCOP)if your'e lokng for a short balls to the wall superheroesque title, this buds for you. for those  seeking something more complicated..well there's always garasaki and boogiepop phantom..zzzzzzzzzzz",4,very good for a Guyver wannabee.,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,1784,"['Basically', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'reviews', 'anime', 'BAOH', 'opinion', 'good', 'example', 'why', 'i', 'love', 'anime', 'decent', 'plot', 'borrowing', 'elements', 'GUYVER', 'movie', 'firestarter', 'bit', 'originality', 'own', 'especially', 'regarding', 'charcter', 'designs', 'weapons', 'powers', 'i.e', 'shooting', 'bees', 'phenomenom', 'baoh', 'hair', 'used', 'electric', 'particles', 'shoot', 'out', 'darts', ""n't"", 'hld', 'back', 'when', 'action', 'gore', 'bit', 'gratuitous', 'one', 'thinking', 'baoh', 'superhero/sci-fi', 'actioner', 'horror', 'anime', 'familiar', 'designs', 'Dr.', 'kasumione', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'Dr.', 'Mindbender', 'walken', 'combination', 'tracker', 'firestarter', 'played', 'george', 'c.', 'scott', 'one', 'mutants', 'x-men', 'Durdo', 'endoskeleton', 'terminator', 'three', 'steel', 'masked', 'finacers', 'Doress', 'look', 'certain', 'villian', 'certain', 'toyline/comic/carton.the', 'arm', 'saber', 'however', 'exactly', 'guyver', 'where', 'simularity', 'lolthe', 'DVD', 'bare', 'bones', 'meaning', 'extras', 'case', 'nice', 'filecard', 'baoh', 'mysterious', 'powers', 'song', 'lyrics', 'speaking', 'original', 'japanese', 'version', 'soldier', 'way', 'better', 'english', 'song.the', 'english', 'dub', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'bad', 'cheesy', 'song', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'loving', 'got', 'go', 'not', 'blend', 'dark', 'superhero', 'thriller', 'world', 'BAOH.INCLOSNG', 'animaton', 'still', 'up', 'even', '15', 'years', 'later', 'thanks', 'th', 'talented', 'folks', 'o', 'toho/shinshuiea', 'FIST', 'THE', 'NORTHSTAR', 'ANGELCOP', 'e', 'lokng', 'short', 'balls', 'wall', 'superheroesque', 'title', 'buds', 'seeking', 'something', 'more', 'complicated..well', 'always', 'garasaki', 'boogiepop', 'phantom..zzzzzzzzzzz']",Ad Police Files:Baoh VHS

Well, Doress is planning to put a worm-like parasite in the boys brain. The worm feeds  on the kids brain, while at the same time, allows him to transform into a  big, blue superhero, (WOW!), that can shoot needles out of his head, big  blades from his arms, and other abilities that mostly end up cutting up  heads. Anyway,he meets a little girl with psychic powers,who helps him  escape from the evil organization Doress. But when the little girl is  captured, The boy must use Baohs amazing power to defeat Doress and save  his friend. Did I mention the boy has amnesia?If you didn't notice from  my description of &quot;Baoh&quot;s story that I was being sarcastic, I  will say upfront,BAOH IS AN AWFUL ANIME. Quite honestly,I could find hardly  anything decent about it besides the animation. Not that the animation was  that good. Sure,the animation was very detailed, but it was not very  attractive. The textures were ugly,and took away from the overall  experience. The story was fairly unique,but the plot was pretty bad. What  bothered me most was the extreme(and I mean extreme!) violence.I'm talking  almost X level, almost as violent as &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; .  &quot;baoh&quot;s violence was almost unbearable, mostly involving heads.  Honestly,I have never seen so many ways to destroy a head.  Heads explode  ,are chopped off, get needles blasted into them, are cut into multiple  pieces, smashed, melted, the list goes on and on. Yeech!Another flaw  this movie has is its embarassing dubbing.It's some of the worst I've ever  heard. Sometimes it is overacted,and sometimes the voices sound like the  actors are half asleep. And sometimes,they combine both bad and good  dubbing into one sentence.This anime has so many problems I can't name  them all. Don't torture yourself.This garbage won't appeal to anyone. Even  if you like the graphic violence, chaotic and excessive gore and blood, The  film will still provide you will another bad point. Just please,for your  own good,stay away.
