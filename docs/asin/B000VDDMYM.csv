1100983,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000VDDMYM,Brian E. Erland,"[22, 22]","The '07 film `Another Perfect Stranger' is the sequel to `The Perfect Stranger' released in '05. We are told that ten years have passed since Nikki Cominsky underwent a life changing experience during dinner with Jesus and now its her daughter Sarah's turn to discover the spiritual dimension in her own life.Yes, Jesus returns for a face to face conversation with another member of the Cominsky family on a journey from Michigan to Portland with a brief stop in Dallas, Texas in-between. Young Sarah is a recent high school graduate and budding artist who's undergoing a crisis of faith which has only been worsened by her Mother's sharing the story of her encounter with Christ the night before her departure. She is definitely not in the mood to be evangelized on her way to tour the prestigious Art Institute she's hoping to attend if her scholarship request is accepted.Unfortunately Sarah is seated between two men on the first leg of the flight, the one on her left happens to be a ""religious"" Christian who immediately irritates her with the normal church jargon she's trying to avoid. When he fails to convince the rebellious teen he decides to take a nap leaving her alone to converse with the up to now silent gentleman to her right. Yep, you guessed it, it's Jesus.Her initially reaction to the stranger is positive, she observes him teasing a cute little girl who keeps making funny noises in his direction and he responds in like manner. Yep, he's good with kids. When they finally get into a conversation he says, ""I hate religion"" which is another good sign to Sarah's way of thinking, a kindred spirit no doubt. Little does she know that he's pushing ""relationship"" not religion.A lively conversation ensues and when the plane lands for its brief stopover in Dallas Sarah says goodbye thinking this will be the end of their conversation.  That turns out not to be the case. They run into each other at the airport cafeteria where Jesus treats her to a grande, non-fat, vanilla latte with sugar-free whipped cream and a double fudge scone.After a quick snap and some more lively conversation they leave to catch their next flight, yes they're both on their way to Portland, what a coincidence. Now what really makes one start to wonder about this whole chance encounter thing is the fact that this mysterious stranger just happens to have the seat next to her again! What are the odds on that?You think maybe she'd have started to figure it all out by now wouldn't you? Here are some of the more obvious clues to his identity;- Children love him (as already mentioned above),- He speaks to various passengers along the way in their native tongue. When Sarah asks him ""how many languages do you speak"" he responds, ""I speak them all"" (that's a BIG hint right there).- He describes himself as a counselor and says he works for his Father's ""Management Operations"". When asked what he manages he replies ""everything.""I don't know about you, but it seems like all the identifiable signs of a friendly savior are present: good listener, sympathetic nature, multi-lingual, insightful counselor and a natural with children. If that doesn't turn the light on, how about when he finally introduces himself with the statement ""You can call me Yesh"" (short for Yeshua, i.e. Jesus). Needless to say by the time Sarah figures it all out her life has been changed forever. Another success story for the Big Guy!All joking aside, this film and its predecessor are two of the more enjoyable Christain films I've seen. Ruby Marie Lewis (Sarah) and Jefferson Moore (Jesus) are both likable and engaging and the conversations are at times contrived but overall well thought out and non-offensive to those viewers who are non believers.

As I seek to know him better by reading it daily, I learn to know, trust and obey Him because He has my best interests at heart. If you're going to wait to be visited by Jesus, Himself, to lead you into this knowledge, don't wait it's not the way He does it. His Word says ""Seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness and these things will be added unto you"". Yes, He is the Good Shepherd and comes after those who stray, but look around, hasn't anybody told you of His love for you, hasn't anybody shared with you to read His Word and see what He wants for you? If not then take it from me, He love's you and He wants the best for you. You don't need a personal visit from God to know that He love's you or that He's real. Remember what He said to Thomas about those who will believe without seeing? I guess I just wouldn't want to steer anyone into thinking that they will get a personal visit from Him to explain what He's already explained in His Word.

But I was curious how they would handle a sequel, and I think ""Another Perfect Stranger"" is an improvment over the first movie.This is set 10 years after the first movie. Nikki (from the first movie) has a daughter, Sarah has had an argument with her mother about the mother's faith after her parents were appaled to hear Sarah didn't believe in God.  After the argument, her mother had told her that she herself felt the same way Sarah does, until she had the chance to sit down to dinner with Jesus . So, now, Sarah thinks her mother is insane and religion is bad.So now it's Sarah's turn to meet the mysterious stranger. They meet on an airplane when she's going to Portland. He doesn't say he's Jesus this time. They talk, about religion, about God, and other similar topics, and you can guess how it ends.I found the issues in this movie to be more interesting than those in ""The Perfect Stranger"", but there are still problems. First of all, like the first movie, it's just not very entertaining and, would thus not be a very good witnessing tool, unless you don't want those you witness to to get bored. The other problem is also one that it has in common with the first movie. The Stranger (Yesh, he calls himself), of course knows everything. Sarah is just a young girl. And Yesh is pretty manipulative on her, so she doesn't really ask many tough questions or question what Yesh says. So again, it would not be a good witnessing tool if you're going to witness to more educated people.If you loved the first movie, and I know many do, I'd recommend this movie.
