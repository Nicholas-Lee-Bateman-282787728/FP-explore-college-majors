704166,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0000687F4,A. Burchfield,"[2, 4]","I've just gone part way through this DVD but found it pretty entertaining with good sound. There's a very wide selection of singers for you to listen to, I guess a little something for the whole 50 years the Queen has been on the throne (although I have no idea why Kermit the Frog was there on Tom Jones shoulder there at the last.)To view the program you've got several different menu choices, selection by artist or by song among them. I found that selection by artist seems to bring up everything in the show that someone had a part in, no matter how small. Emma Bunton comes up I think twice, the first time she sang, the second she was just one of the crowd on stage and couldn't even be heard individually. I wouldn't try this selection method for Phil Collins because while he sang on one or two the guy was a background drummer for almost everything in the program. Selection by song seems to be just a way to start somewhere other than the beginning, when I tried it as soon as one song was finished it moved right on to the next one.I would've liked to see more of Buckingham Palace but here you get a few aerial shots and a little bit from the ground. Elton John did his performance inside the Palace, it was interesting but I suspect that it wasn't really live but prerecorded.Occaisionally you see brief glimpses of some members of the Royal family from wherever it was that they were seated, the younger ones seemed to enjoy the show. Don't blink much or you'll miss them, the cameras mostly covered the crowds and performers (most of whom really seemed to enjoy themselves).",3,Entertaining but not a tour of the Palace,1032307200,"09 18, 2002",2002,1590,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'gone', 'part', 'way', 'DVD', 'found', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'good', 'sound', 'very', 'wide', 'selection', 'singers', 'listen', 'guess', 'little', 'something', 'whole', '50', 'years', 'Queen', 'been', 'throne', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'was', 'there', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'shoulder', 'there', 'last', 'view', 'program', ""'ve"", 'got', 'several', 'different', 'menu', 'choices', 'selection', 'artist', 'song', 'found', 'selection', 'artist', 'bring', 'up', 'everything', 'show', 'someone', 'had', 'part', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'Emma', 'Bunton', 'up', 'think', 'twice', 'first', 'time', 'sang', 'second', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'crowd', 'stage', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'heard', 'individually', 'would', ""n't"", 'try', 'selection', 'method', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'sang', 'one', 'two', 'guy', 'was', 'background', 'drummer', 'almost', 'everything', 'program', 'Selection', 'song', 'be', 'just', 'way', 'start', 'somewhere', 'other', 'beginning', 'when', 'tried', 'as', 'soon', 'one', 'song', 'was', 'finished', 'moved', 'right', 'next', 'one.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'here', 'get', 'few', 'aerial', 'shots', 'little', 'bit', 'ground', 'Elton', 'John', 'did', 'performance', 'Palace', 'was', 'interesting', 'suspect', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'live', 'prerecorded.Occaisionally', 'see', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'members', 'Royal', 'family', 'was', 'were', 'seated', 'younger', 'ones', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'blink', 'much', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'cameras', 'mostly', 'covered', 'crowds', 'performers', 'most', 'whom', 'really', 'seemed', 'enjoy']",N/A

At 3 hours[way too long], the viewer is forced to digest a mix of rock n roll legends and a bunch of young british no-names who sing classic Motown tunes [give me a break]. ... You get to hear Ricky Martin, S Club 7, Phil Collins singing ""You Can't Hurry Love""[how about a Genesis tune Phil?], and then the dreaded Moteens including Atomic Kitten, Will Young, Blue, Emma Bunton, Mis-Teeq, Toploader and the Corrs [who the hell are these people?] all singing ... cover versions of your favorite sixties classics. Tom Jones is here singing a horrible rendition of ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" as though he was performing at some casino on the Vegas strip. I hope he apologized to Joe cocker after the show for butchering the tune. Queen tries valiently to impress but without Freddie Mercury it becomes obvious you can't bring back the past. Tony Bennet seems totally out of place here as does Cliff Richard. Despite all this the last hour of the Dvd has some worthy moments. Brian Wilson's stage appearance continues to be stuperous, his performance of ""California Girls"", ""The Warmth Of The Sun"", ""God Only Knows"", and ""Good Vibratios"" however, was one of the high points of the show. Although the elder statesman of British rock Eric Clapton[Layla], Steve Winwood[Gimmie Some Lovin], Joe Cocker[With A Little Help From My Friends], Rod Stewart[Handbags and Gladrags], Ray Davies of Kinks fame[Lola] and Paul McCartney[Hey Jude] give some fine perfomances of their signature tunes during the last hour of the concert, it is not enough to offset the awful first 2/3rds of the show.

If you have to own everything Beatles-related, then you are stuck with this sad excuse for a concert video. To not have a 5.1 soundtrack on a DVD that was recorded recently is unbelievable ... To have a sticker on the case saying as seen on VH1, and not even include all the performances that were shown on VH1 is unbelievable... To leave out ALL of McCartney's solo performances (only ""duets"" and big group encores are included, minus even one of those) and include song after song of no-name, barely talented bores is just UNBELIEVABLE.I guess this thing is around 3 hours? I sat there with the remote having to fast forward through almost everything. I feel sorry for those poor people who were actually there and had to sit through this in person without a fast forward.The picture was filmed nice and clear, but the same genius who decided to leave out all the good stuff, must be the same [person] who thinks a great DVD bonus is watching fireworks on TV.

Movahedpour ""doeadear""","[28, 32]","I purchased the DVD of this concert, hoping to see the parts that had been left out of the VH-1 viewing, but, also, to see more of the introductions and extended versions of songs by the more famous performers. Although some of the songs are on display here (most notably the set with Queen and the cast of 'We Will Rock You') there is also a considerable amount left out. There is not one second of Dame Edna's hilarious introduction of Paul McCartney; nor is George Martin's heart-warming introduction of Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney's version of 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' included. Instead, there is a very bland voice-over, which takes a lot of the emotion and humor out of the day.There is also far too much of flash-in-the-pan artists I've never heard of before, and might not hear of tomorrow. It's refreshing to see the crowd's enthusiasm for Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey, and the classics of British rock, including Ray Davies, Steve Winwood, and Rod Stewart. But, the concert opens with a set by Ricky Martin. What does Ricky Martin have to do with Britain, and why is he opening the concert?Her Majesty looks uncomfortable, as usual, with her subjects, as she makes the obligatory nod and stroll past the superstars. The Prince of Wales, on the other hand, seems downright relaxed and even flirts with some of the back-up singers, before giving a heartfelt speech. The two young princes seem to be stuck between two worlds, working the crowd of pop icons, while wearing their suits and keeping their place.I did a lot of fast-forwarding on this DVD, and, except for the highlights of the classic stars, this DVD really isn't a must-see.",3,A bit of a disappointment,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1655,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'concert', 'hoping', 'see', 'parts', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'VH-1', 'viewing', 'also', 'see', 'more', 'introductions', 'extended', 'versions', 'songs', 'more', 'famous', 'performers', 'songs', 'are', 'display', 'here', 'most', 'notably', 'set', 'Queen', 'cast', ""'We"", 'Will', 'Rock', 'also', 'considerable', 'amount', 'left', 'out', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'hilarious', 'introduction', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'George', 'Martin', 'heart-warming', 'introduction', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'version', ""'While"", 'My', 'Guitar', 'Gently', 'Weeps', 'included', 'Instead', 'very', 'bland', 'voice-over', 'lot', 'emotion', 'humor', 'day.There', 'also', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'flash-in-the-pan', 'artists', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'might', 'not', 'hear', 'tomorrow', 'refreshing', 'see', 'crowd', 'enthusiasm', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'Shirley', 'Bassey', 'classics', 'British', 'rock', 'including', 'Ray', 'Davies', 'Steve', 'Winwood', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'concert', 'set', 'Ricky', 'Martin', 'What', 'Ricky', 'Martin', 'have', 'do', 'Britain', 'why', 'opening', 'concert', 'Majesty', 'uncomfortable', 'usual', 'subjects', 'obligatory', 'nod', 'stroll', 'superstars', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'other', 'hand', 'downright', 'relaxed', 'even', 'flirts', 'back-up', 'singers', 'giving', 'heartfelt', 'speech', 'two', 'young', 'princes', 'seem', 'be', 'stuck', 'two', 'worlds', 'working', 'crowd', 'pop', 'icons', 'wearing', 'suits', 'keeping', 'place.I', 'did', 'lot', 'fast-forwarding', 'DVD', 'highlights', 'classic', 'stars', 'DVD', 'really', ""n't"", 'must-see']",N/A

Couldn't he have bothered to rehearse this? And Clapton again just plays it safe, as if he's reading it, a dim comparison to his past performances of this song in concert with Harrison himself.* Stevie Winwood looking shockingly old, barely able to hit the high notes of his song - he looks like he just got a call to join the Ringo All-Stars...* Rod Stewart seems virtually unable to carry a tune.* Dame Edna's awful routines are as funny as a paper cut.And lets not even get into those awful encores.This was truly a shocking, depressing performance by nearly all concerned.

704172,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B0000687F4,Junglies,"[5, 9]","If you did not get to see this live or on VH1 then you really ought to treat yourself to this DVD.A record of the biggest street party in history, with over 12000 inside the grounds of Buckingham Palace and countless thousands thronging the Mall in central London, this DVD is a prod testament to the people of Britain as well as being an historical document of some of the world's greatest popular musicians.The concert was one of a number of events arranged to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II - fifty years on the throne, one of the longest serving monarch's thoughout Britain's long history.All of the guests were selected at randomn from the British population and were provided with a free picnic lunch. They were also treated to a regal buffet menu of some of the best of (mostly) British popular musicians.There were some surprising omissions such as Sting who has achieved worldwide acclaim, yet Ricky Martin appeared, much to British indifference. Clearly the performers could not have included the veritable galaxy of British stars of the last fifty years, and there also must have been inevitable schedule conflicts.The event was a showcase for the stars, the monarchy and the whole British people. Also it is a testimony to the technicians and the BBC for a show of high quality sound and for a DVD which has managed to hit the shelves in only five weeks. It is sad to think of all the time it took to get the proceeds from the Concert for Bangla Desh to the people who needed the help at the time.To try to select the best moments from over three hours is difficult but mention must be made of the following. Lenny Henry and Dame Edna Everage managed to inject just the right level of humour into the proceedings. Annie Lenox, alas without Dave Stewart, provided a very strong, soulful rearrangement of Sisters (are doing it for themselves), Phil Collins who I saw long ago as a drummer with a receeding hairline and long hair who occasionally sang with Genesis, did a great job on You Can't Hurry Love.The younger generation of Brit-pop  were not my cup of tea really but I am sure that they were appreciated by the younger members of the audience and I don't mean the young princes!For me the absolute highlights came with the veterans of the UK pop scene and Brian Wilson whose Beach Boys songs brought a lump to my throat having managed to see the band at Wembley Stadium in 1974. The surprising choice of Steve Winwood, surprising because he has been out of the public eye for some years, was a joy to listen to. What a voice! Both he and Joe Cocker are such distinctive vocalists with so much soul. Seeing Ray Davies again after almost thirty years but this time without the Kinks was very heartening, such a nice jacket too. Ultimately the night belonged to the Beatles and particularly in the wonderful treatment of While My Guitar Gently Weeps given by Eric Clapton and Sir Paul McCartney. Was it just me or did Eric play so soulfully in memory of a dear friend and musician.The Royal family interlude was both moving and funny with Prince Charles displaying a much hidden sense of humour. It was nice to see the young princes being very friendly with the female component of the show but not so nice to see the younger of the two not applauding the tribute to his grandmother.This is an excellent DVD, the proceeds of which will go to charity. It makes me proud of my English heritage, and proud of the Great British Pop Music Inductry.A final memorable moment - all of the performers together, ostensibly to sing the National Anthem - coming together to sing All You Need Is Love. John Lennon would be both mystified and proud to have seen that and I am glad that Yoko was in the Royal Box to share those minutes.",5,Thank Your Lucky Stars for this Party!,1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,3771,"['did', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'live', 'VH1', 'then', 'really', 'ought', 'treat', 'DVD.A', 'record', 'biggest', 'street', 'party', 'history', '12000', 'grounds', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'countless', 'thousands', 'thronging', 'Mall', 'central', 'London', 'DVD', 'prod', 'testament', 'people', 'Britain', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'historical', 'document', 'world', 'greatest', 'popular', 'musicians.The', 'concert', 'was', 'one', 'number', 'events', 'arranged', 'commemorate', 'Golden', 'Jubilee', 'reign', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'fifty', 'years', 'throne', 'one', 'longest', 'serving', 'monarch', 'thoughout', 'Britain', 'long', 'history.All', 'guests', 'were', 'selected', 'randomn', 'British', 'population', 'were', 'provided', 'free', 'picnic', 'lunch', 'were', 'also', 'treated', 'regal', 'buffet', 'menu', 'best', 'mostly', 'British', 'popular', 'musicians.There', 'were', 'surprising', 'omissions', 'such', 'Sting', 'who', 'achieved', 'worldwide', 'acclaim', 'yet', 'Ricky', 'Martin', 'appeared', 'much', 'British', 'indifference', 'Clearly', 'performers', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'included', 'veritable', 'galaxy', 'British', 'stars', 'last', 'fifty', 'years', 'there', 'also', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'inevitable', 'schedule', 'conflicts.The', 'event', 'was', 'showcase', 'stars', 'monarchy', 'whole', 'British', 'people', 'Also', 'testimony', 'technicians', 'BBC', 'show', 'high', 'quality', 'sound', 'DVD', 'managed', 'hit', 'shelves', 'only', 'five', 'weeks', 'sad', 'think', 'time', 'took', 'get', 'proceeds', 'Concert', 'Bangla', 'Desh', 'people', 'who', 'needed', 'help', 'time.To', 'try', 'select', 'best', 'moments', 'three', 'hours', 'difficult', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'following', 'Lenny', 'Henry', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'Everage', 'managed', 'inject', 'just', 'right', 'level', 'humour', 'proceedings', 'Annie', 'Lenox', 'alas', 'Dave', 'Stewart', 'provided', 'very', 'strong', 'soulful', 'rearrangement', 'Sisters', 'are', 'doing', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'who', 'saw', 'long', 'ago', 'drummer', 'receeding', 'hairline', 'long', 'hair', 'who', 'occasionally', 'sang', 'Genesis', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hurry', 'Love.The', 'younger', 'generation', 'Brit-pop', 'were', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'really', 'am', 'sure', 'were', 'appreciated', 'younger', 'members', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'young', 'princes', 'absolute', 'highlights', 'came', 'veterans', 'UK', 'pop', 'scene', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'songs', 'brought', 'lump', 'throat', 'having', 'managed', 'see', 'band', 'Wembley', 'Stadium', '1974', 'surprising', 'choice', 'Steve', 'Winwood', 'surprising', 'been', 'public', 'eye', 'years', 'was', 'joy', 'listen', 'What', 'voice', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'are', 'such', 'distinctive', 'vocalists', 'so', 'much', 'soul', 'Seeing', 'Ray', 'Davies', 'again', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'time', 'Kinks', 'was', 'very', 'heartening', 'nice', 'jacket', 'too', 'Ultimately', 'night', 'belonged', 'Beatles', 'particularly', 'wonderful', 'treatment', 'My', 'Guitar', 'Gently', 'Weeps', 'given', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Sir', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Was', 'just', 'did', 'Eric', 'play', 'so', 'soulfully', 'memory', 'dear', 'friend', 'musician.The', 'Royal', 'family', 'interlude', 'was', 'moving', 'funny', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'displaying', 'much', 'hidden', 'sense', 'humour', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'young', 'princes', 'being', 'very', 'friendly', 'female', 'component', 'show', 'not', 'so', 'nice', 'see', 'younger', 'two', 'not', 'applauding', 'tribute', 'grandmother.This', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'proceeds', 'will', 'go', 'charity', 'English', 'heritage', 'proud', 'Great', 'British', 'Pop', 'Music', 'Inductry.A', 'final', 'memorable', 'moment', 'performers', 'together', 'ostensibly', 'sing', 'National', 'Anthem', 'coming', 'together', 'sing', 'All', 'Need', 'Love', 'John', 'Lennon', 'would', 'be', 'mystified', 'proud', 'have', 'seen', 'am', 'glad', 'Yoko', 'was', 'Royal', 'Box', 'share', 'minutes']",N/A

There are so many wonderful artists here, and the song selections they have made have really added to their respective performances.  First, Paul McCartney is present, and he is always excellent, but here, he actually supports Eric Clapton in a tribute to George Harrison.  They play Harrison's majestic &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;.  Clapton does another wonderful version of &quot;Layla&quot;, in addition.  Albert Lee, and Phil Collins are in the main band that supports most of the artists.  Joe Cocker is brilliant!  The Black Sabbath song, &quot;Paranoid&quot; features Ozzy with Tony Iommi.  Brian May, with Dallas Taylor, then begins a routine that sees the cast of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; arrive and back them up on a Queen medley that is breath-taking!I was surprised at how good the Tom Jones segment is.  Jones does new new songs that are as good as any of his older ones!There are bands that I was introduced to for the first time.  The Corrs are three sisters, and a brother, from Ireland.  After they did a song here, I went out and purchased a DVD of their regular show.  I adore this band!  Also, &quot;Toploader&quot; is a young, British group that reminded me of what a group from about 1964, sounded like.  I could say much more about this wonderful disc, but it would all be just good reports about enjoyable performances, mainly.  The joy of a DVD is that one does not have to view/hear songs that one does not like.  I only suffered though the Brian Wilson segment one, or two times.  He is good at what he does, but I don't care for beach music.  Also, there is a spice girl here, and she seems to primarily be interested in getting the attention of Prince William.  That is fun as well!In comparison to other shows available on DVD, this one is well worth the price.  The background is beautiful, of course, and no expense is spared with stage decor,etc.  This is just a very good show to have for repeated viewings.",5,Epic Show pleasing all !,1040169600,"12 18, 2002",2002,2030,"['have', 'watched', 'DVD', 'many', 'times', 'purchase', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'artists', 'here', 'song', 'selections', 'have', 'made', 'have', 'really', 'added', 'respective', 'performances', 'First', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'present', 'always', 'excellent', 'here', 'actually', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'tribute', 'George', 'Harrison', 'play', 'Harrison', 'majestic', 'quot', 'My', 'Guitar', 'Gently', 'Weeps', 'quot', 'Clapton', 'wonderful', 'version', 'quot', 'Layla', 'quot', 'addition', 'Albert', 'Lee', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'are', 'main', 'band', 'most', 'artists', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'brilliant', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'song', 'quot', 'Paranoid', 'quot', 'features', 'Ozzy', 'Tony', 'Iommi', 'Brian', 'May', 'Dallas', 'Taylor', 'then', 'routine', 'cast', 'quot', 'Will', 'Rock', 'quot', 'arrive', 'back', 'up', 'Queen', 'medley', 'breath-taking', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'segment', 'Jones', 'new', 'new', 'songs', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'older', 'ones', 'are', 'was', 'introduced', 'first', 'time', 'Corrs', 'are', 'three', 'sisters', 'brother', 'Ireland', 'did', 'song', 'here', 'went', 'out', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'regular', 'show', 'adore', 'band', 'Also', 'quot', 'Toploader', 'quot', 'young', 'British', 'group', 'reminded', 'what', 'group', '1964', 'sounded', 'could', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'wonderful', 'disc', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'just', 'good', 'reports', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'mainly', 'joy', 'DVD', 'one', 'not', 'have', 'view/hear', 'songs', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'suffered', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'segment', 'one', 'two', 'times', 'good', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'beach', 'music', 'Also', 'spice', 'girl', 'here', 'primarily', 'be', 'interested', 'getting', 'attention', 'Prince', 'William', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'comparison', 'other', 'shows', 'available', 'DVD', 'one', 'well', 'price', 'background', 'beautiful', 'course', 'expense', 'spared', 'stage', 'decor', 'etc', 'just', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'have', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

They only included 3 of his songs, All you need is love, Hey Jude and While my guitar gently weeps. Songs that were cut were ""Her Majesty"" (at only 1 min long, would it have killed them to include this gem), Blackbird, and Sgt. Pepper/The End.
