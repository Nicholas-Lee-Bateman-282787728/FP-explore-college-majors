News isn't intelligent, informative, nor credible. So why haven't I thrown out my television set yet? Partially because of Laguna Beach, to be honest. It doesn't try to be smart. It doesn't try to be deep. It doesn't even try to be good. It just is what it is, and if that makes any sense, that's why it's good. I've given up on television shows that try to be smart, funny, dramatic, informative, sensitive, etc. LB doesn't try to be any of those things. You can just sit down with an episode of LB and you get a nice 1/2 hour of mindless fluff. And for that reason and that reason alone, it's why it's worth watching. It's 'escape reality' telvision... and in my opinion, that's the best kind of television there is.",5,"""Escape reality"" television worth watching",1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,828,"['nothing', 'intelligent', 'TV', 'anymore', 'Even', 'shows', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'intelligent', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'News', ""n't"", 'intelligent', 'informative', 'credible', 'So', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'thrown', 'out', 'television', 'set', 'yet', 'Partially', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'be', 'honest', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'smart', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'deep', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'be', 'good', 'just', 'what', 'sense', 'why', 'good', ""'ve"", 'given', 'up', 'television', 'shows', 'try', 'be', 'smart', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'informative', 'sensitive', 'etc', 'LB', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'things', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'down', 'episode', 'LB', 'get', 'nice', '1/2', 'hour', 'mindless', 'fluff', 'reason', 'reason', 'alone', 'why', 'worth', 'watching', ""'escape"", 'reality', 'telvision', 'opinion', 'best', 'kind', 'television']",Laguna Beach - The Complete First Season
903863,A2YAIN7B1MLETD,B0009CTVLS,"Annette De Lira ""NUTTY""","[2, 5]","I compare it to dawsons creek because to me that was the greatest teen soap ever. MTV is known for its music related and reality shows, but sometimes they try too hard to get all sorts of wild and tacky things on the air. Every season you see new shows come and go, but Laguna hopefully is here to stay. They really hit the jack pot with this. MTV needed a dramatic soap opera to keep some of their audience interested. The only other teen soap I can think of is Undressed, but we all saw that fail. I love Laguna Beach. At first I wasnt too open to it because I thought the last thing we needed are some more conceited rich kids on tv. But after watching the first show I was just hooked. Its so stylish and the settings are beautiful, in a way it  makes you envious! There's so much drama that the typical teenager in high school can relate to and I think thats what makes it great. That despite their image of worry free lives, they actually suffer the same problems that any teen would growing up or in a relationship. Its mainly about love triangles, going away to college and talking behing eachothers backs... but its great. I cant stress it enough. Now MTV has so many reality shows but most of them seemed staged to me. Pimp my ride, room raiders, date my mom, Made and a few more all seem so fake. They all seem like they've been practicing their lines yet they still suck at it. But I dunno for some reason Laguna seems real. And thats what makes it so believable...

903864,A1I61T0VRK0JKQ,B0009CTVLS,BarryChamplain,"[3, 3]","Laguna Beach is the show that gave fame to a group of random rich kids from the OC. This show was popular during my junior/senior year in high school, and while I for sure not popular or rich, I did, and do, feel a bit of a bond with this group. It's great fluff and entertaining. I personally like this season much more than the second, though I feel that it is good as well. Season three was garbage and the Laguna spinoff Newport Harbor was ok, definitely better than Laguna season three.Anyway, back to the product. This is a nice DVD set that features all full episodes and bonus footage and interviews which are pretty interesting. It is worth buying this set if you liked the show back in the day. Believe me, unless you were someone who watched all the episodes ten times each already, you will enjoy your second spin around Laguna and find yourself seeing things that you missed or don't remember from watching the original episodes. The best part is that you can usually find the first and second seasons of Laguna here on Amazon for $5-$10 each, or less, which makes enjoying this series again cheap and easy. Oh, and I'd also recommend buying this to people who are fans of Lauren Conrad and the Hills as you get to see her grow up and evolve into who she is today. If you're a Hills fan and missed Laguna, you'll probably like it as well and it will give you perspective on how Lauren and Heidi grew up.",5,A classic (if reality shows can be called classic) reality show.,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,1416,"['Laguna', 'Beach', 'show', 'gave', 'fame', 'group', 'random', 'rich', 'kids', 'OC', 'show', 'was', 'popular', 'junior/senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'sure', 'not', 'popular', 'rich', 'did', 'do', 'feel', 'bit', 'bond', 'group', 'great', 'fluff', 'entertaining', 'personally', 'season', 'much', 'more', 'second', 'feel', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Season', 'three', 'was', 'garbage', 'Laguna', 'spinoff', 'Newport', 'Harbor', 'was', 'ok', 'definitely', 'better', 'Laguna', 'season', 'three.Anyway', 'back', 'product', 'nice', 'DVD', 'set', 'full', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'footage', 'interviews', 'are', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'worth', 'buying', 'set', 'liked', 'show', 'back', 'day', 'Believe', 'were', 'someone', 'who', 'watched', 'episodes', 'ten', 'times', 'already', 'will', 'enjoy', 'second', 'spin', 'Laguna', 'find', 'seeing', 'things', 'missed', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'watching', 'original', 'episodes', 'best', 'part', 'can', 'usually', 'find', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'Laguna', 'here', 'Amazon', '5-', '10', 'less', 'enjoying', 'series', 'again', 'cheap', 'easy', 'Oh', ""'d"", 'also', 'recommend', 'buying', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Lauren', 'Conrad', 'Hills', 'get', 'see', 'grow', 'up', 'evolve', 'who', 'today', ""'re"", 'Hills', 'fan', 'missed', 'Laguna', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'give', 'perspective', 'how', 'Lauren', 'Heidi', 'grew', 'up']",Laguna Beach - The Complete First Season

903867,A144NRQVLUE8NG,B0009CTVLS,caj,"[7, 9]","This set offers a great deal of extras. It includes about 30 deleted scenes - some hilarious scenes with LC and Lo, which should have been aired in place of those nauseating scenes of Kristin and anyone she was talking to (or making out with).It has interviews with all the cast and asks some pretty good questions. There were a couple of questions that should have been asked that weren't. Examples include asking LC how she felt when Stephen mouthed 'I love you' to Kristin right before he took her up to his room in Cabo or asking Kristin how she felt when Stephen met LC at the airport in San Fran. I'm sure the reason these question weren't asked is because the interviews were filmed after the show was wrapped, but before it aired.We are taken on a 'cribs' style tour of LC's incredible new house and Lo takes us on a tour of Laguna. We are shown some footage from the casting tapes. While Trey, Talon, & Morgan are featured more in the extras than they were on the show, great kids like Dieter and Jessica are barely mentioned. I think Talon talked more on the extras than he did on the entire season.As for the shows, the picture and sound is pretty good. I give the set four stars because a lot of the original music from the show is not on this set. Why MTV couldn't shell out some bucks to do this is beyond me. You'll notice some songs did stay, like '100 years', but the replacement music mostly sucks.Laguna Beach is a great show. Although I'm looking forward to catching up with some of the cast in season 2, I'm leary because I don't know how much of 'cotton mouth' Kristin I can stomach.

903868,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0009CTVLS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","Reminisce back to the first season of ""Laguna Beach"", when the O.C. was the hot show and it was way before Heidi and Spencer of ""The Hills"".The first season revolves around the love triangle between Lauren ""LC"" (who narrates the first season), Stephen (the guy she likes and had a short fling with) and Kristin (Stephen's girlfriend).  Needless to say, LC and Kristin hate each other's guts.The show also features their friends and the teen angst that they are going through.  From high school activities, trying to get grades enough to graduate, preparing for prom, trying to get into college and spring break in Cabo.Where most shows have covered the struggles of  teen angst and financial challenges, Laguna Beach: The Real OC gives viewers a different perspective through their lives and what the affluent and popular teens of that city do for fun and how they live their lives.As for the DVD, all eleven episodes from the first season is featured.The video quality is very good  showcasting the brilliant colors of the shoreline, the surf to sunsets.As for audio, audio is in stereo but if there is one major complaint, its that some of the music has been changed for the DVD release.One of the highlights of Laguna Beach is the use of current popular music at that time.From Yellowcard, Maroon 5 to the Black Eyesd Peas.  The music really enhanced the viewability and fun factor of the show.  Unfortunately, some of the cool songs have been replaced.As for special features, although short, this is where the DVD set shines.  Included is a tour of LC's house, Lo showing us her favorite spots in Laguna Beach, casting tapes which provide information on the love triangle.  Behind-the-scenes of the season one finale, deleted scenes (which you get to see) and a really interesting interview on how the individuals felt about the show and about other people on the show.Also featured is short featurettes taken from the episodes.Plus seven music videos featuring the indie artists whose music was used on the DVD and VIP membership to MTV.com.This DVD set (and even the series) may not be for everyone.  But I enjoyed watching a different perspective of teen angst.  Lush visuals, loads of drama and good music makes Laguna Beach: The Real OC quite enjoyable.",4,For those who want to remember the series that started it all...,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,2263,"['Reminisce', 'back', 'first', 'season', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'when', 'O.C', 'was', 'hot', 'show', 'was', 'way', 'Heidi', 'Spencer', 'Hills', '.The', 'first', 'season', 'revolves', 'love', 'triangle', 'Lauren', 'LC', 'who', 'first', 'season', 'Stephen', 'guy', 'had', 'short', 'fling', 'Kristin', 'Stephen', 'girlfriend', 'Needless', 'say', 'LC', 'Kristin', 'hate', 'other', 'guts.The', 'show', 'also', 'friends', 'teen', 'angst', 'are', 'going', 'From', 'high', 'school', 'activities', 'trying', 'get', 'grades', 'enough', 'graduate', 'preparing', 'prom', 'trying', 'get', 'college', 'spring', 'break', 'Cabo.Where', 'most', 'shows', 'have', 'covered', 'struggles', 'teen', 'angst', 'financial', 'challenges', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'Real', 'OC', 'viewers', 'different', 'perspective', 'lives', 'what', 'affluent', 'popular', 'teens', 'city', 'do', 'fun', 'how', 'live', 'lives.As', 'DVD', 'eleven', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'featured.The', 'video', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'showcasting', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'shoreline', 'surf', 'sunsets.As', 'audio', 'audio', 'stereo', 'one', 'major', 'complaint', 'music', 'been', 'changed', 'DVD', 'release.One', 'highlights', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'use', 'current', 'popular', 'music', 'time.From', 'Yellowcard', 'Maroon', '5', 'Black', 'Eyesd', 'Peas', 'music', 'really', 'enhanced', 'viewability', 'fun', 'factor', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'cool', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'replaced.As', 'special', 'features', 'short', 'where', 'DVD', 'set', 'shines', 'Included', 'tour', 'LC', 'house', 'Lo', 'showing', 'favorite', 'spots', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'casting', 'tapes', 'provide', 'information', 'love', 'triangle', 'Behind-the-scenes', 'season', 'one', 'finale', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'get', 'see', 'really', 'interesting', 'interview', 'how', 'individuals', 'felt', 'show', 'other', 'people', 'show.Also', 'featured', 'short', 'featurettes', 'taken', 'episodes.Plus', 'seven', 'music', 'videos', 'featuring', 'indie', 'artists', 'music', 'was', 'used', 'DVD', 'VIP', 'membership', 'MTV.com.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'even', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'different', 'perspective', 'teen', 'angst', 'Lush', 'visuals', 'loads', 'drama', 'good', 'music', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'Real', 'OC', 'quite', 'enjoyable']",Laguna Beach - The Complete First Season

903872,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B0009CTVLS,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 4]","Laguna Beach is a beautiful resort in Southern California. It is known for its gorgeous beaches, interesting art festivals, and clean waters. I've visited it many times ever since I was a little kid, and I'm always struck at how beautiful everything is. Everything except . . . that godawful reality show! Honestly, this is one of the most horrible shows to ever hit the mainstream media. Why? Well, everything is so incredibly uninteresting. It's basically these young girls and boys talking and talking and talking and shopping and talking and talking and doing nothing and shopping and breaking up and making up and going to the beach and talking and . . . that's all they do. Come on! I'm pretty sure that not every teenager that lives in Laguna Beach is like that. They're smarter and more interesting than the ones that are on this show. And why would we be fascinated with Kristin, Jen, and everyone else? They are such a boring group of people! They do nothing productive with their own lives! Why are they doing nothing but lying around and enjoying the sunshine? Why don't we see them work? Don't they have jobs?! Good God, the creator of this show ought to be banned from television!But I think the worst sin that this show commits is that it assumes that this is ""The Real Orange County."" Bull****! You actually think that this county is full of rich white people? That is false: that's only fifteen percent of the entire population. And believe me when I say that I live in Orange County (I've been living here for about fifteen years). If you go farther up north away from Laguna Beach, you can see that it's ETHNICALLY DIVERSE. Here we have Latinos, Asians, African-Americans, etc. And not only that, we have many different philosophies on life, not to mention our variable political and religious beliefs. Oh, and we work for a living. We don't always lie around the house all the time. Don't get me wrong. I still love the south side of Orange County. Huntington, Newport, and Laguna are fantastic beaches, and the suburbia in Laguna Niguel and Mission Viejo are just beautiful. But why couldn't MTV focus on a city like Garden Grove or Buena Park or Santa Ana? THEY'RE the cities that showcase the Real Orange County.

I don't see a problem with this.Anyway, highlights of the first season include the classic first episode: ""A Black and White Affair"", the introduction of the word ""Dunzo"" to the english language (When Kristen breaks her car of course), Trey's sweet hats and longboarding, and the great Kristen/Steven fight in Cabo.Couldn't be a bigger fan of this classic series.",5,Premiere source of entertainment,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,1302,"['premier', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'historian', 'NY/NJ', 'metro', 'area', 'figured', 'needed', 'share', 'opinions', 'fine', 'season', 'First', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'flaws', 'first', 'season', '1', 'J-Wahl', '2', 'J-Wahl', '3', 'J-Wahl', 'are', 'aware', 'Jason', 'Wahler', 'took', 'being', 'a-hole', 'boyfriend', 'new', 'heights', 'repeatedly', 'made', 'way', 'various', 'ladies', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'High', 'School.Enough', 'Jason', 'Season', '1', 'have', 'Talan', 'Torriero', 'who', 'apparently', 'was', 'football', 'star', 'high', 'school', 'shocking', 'know', 'information', '32', 'year', 'old', 'friend', 'Seanstradamus', 'Powers', 'was', 'givenLaguna', 'Beach', 'Life', 'Bubblewhich', 'such', 'important', 'information', 'Yeah', '32', 'friend', 'was', 'given', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'book', 'present', 'what', 'totally', 'normal', 'Back', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'also', 'tried', 'match', 'up', 'vacation', 'schedule', 'cast', 'potential', 'next', 'trip', 'Cabo', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'this.Anyway', 'highlights', 'first', 'season', 'include', 'classic', 'first', 'episode', 'Black', 'White', 'Affair', 'introduction', 'word', 'Dunzo', 'english', 'language', 'When', 'Kristen', 'car', 'course', 'Trey', 'sweet', 'hats', 'longboarding', 'great', 'Kristen/Steven', 'fight', 'Cabo.Could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bigger', 'fan', 'classic', 'series']",Laguna Beach - The Complete First Season
