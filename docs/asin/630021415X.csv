211120,A2S244KFX0745K,630021415X,Alan Edward Creager,"[1, 4]","When watching, as well as reviewing, ""The Lords Of Discipline"", it is best not to judge the film by its faithfulness to the book it is based on. Unlike ""Christine"", which was adapted to film brilliantly by John Carpenter, ""The Lords of Discipline"" was mercilessly cut and chopped to fit it into a movie that lasted less than five hours. There is no Colonel Edward T. Reynolds, Annie Kate Gervais, no freshman year flashbacks for Will, and the terrifying might of The Ten is largely lost. They are defeated far too easily in this movie, and the near-mythical image they and General Bentley ""Shipload"" Durrell have is not very well shown in the film. Again, it's best not to compare the movie and the book too much. Better to think of them as being two completely unrelated works that happen to share the same name and basic storyline. No, that doesn't really make sense either. But it does make more sense than ""Spacecataz"", surely. Anyway.The acting in this film is top notch. Robert Prosky and G.D. Spradlin are brilliant as Colonel Thomas ""The Bear"" Berrineau and General Bentley ""Shipload"" Durrell, and while those were the ones who stood out most in my mind, all the other roles were well played.The story is well done, for the most part, though the presence of cheese with a side of cliche is quite noticeable at times. The Bear asks Will McClean, a senior with no rank whatsoever, to watch out for the Carolina Military Institute's first black cadet as he passes through the freshman system. A secret organization on campus, The Ten, moves in on that cadet, Pearce, when the cadre fail to get rid of him themselves. That's where things get anticlimactic. The cadre confronting a knob on the A Company quad at the film start, and the tragic tale of Poteete, the human yam, are very well done, as are the scenes involving Hell Night. But the scene at General Durrell's plantation house? The Ten are supposed to be the best of each class, physically and mentally, and here Will, Mark and Pig just knock them down like bowling pins. Lame.... and there is no way to effectively describe how lousy the confrontation with Durrell and the closing scene are. Bah. But next to the unforgivably awful ""Children of the Corn"" films, this movie is a work of art. It has many flaws and much cheese with cliche on the side, but I can't call it a bad movie. Robert Prosky is simply too good as ""The Bear"", and also- ""The Lords of Discipline"" was filmed in England. Why? VMI, The Citadel, and any other military schools that the film makers asked about filming on campus were quite adamant in their refusal. Didn't like what it was about, too negative about life at a military school. But how did that go, one wonders? I honestly had no idea the movie was not actually filmed in the American South until I looked it up. They convince you of the film's being set in a 1960's South Carolina that well.As I said, ""The Lords of Discipline"" is an imperfect film, and fans of the book it is based on- emphasis, 'based'- could start a riot over how unfaithful an adaptation this is. But as I have said, it's best not to think about that. This movie is actually pretty good. It's better than ""Children of the Corn"", and makes more sense than ""Spacecataz"". That's got to count for something.Did I mention that David Keith plays McClean and Bill Paxton plays John Alexander?

For that I was very forgiving about what what cut out, even painfully so.  We see no flashbacks of the main characters first three years, there was almost nothing about his passion for basketball, and the love story could have been a movie in itself.But things had to go, and rather than treat them badly, I have no resentment for what they left out.  The movie does concentrate on some important things however, and for awhile, does it well.  We see the often cruel treatment upperclassmen give underclassmen, and can see the reasoning why this seems to be necessary.  It is the overriding theme of the book, and shows the givers and takers of the harrassment very well.It also does tackle one of the important subplots, which is the treatment of the first black recruit to the academy.  The way the recruit was treated is shown in all of it's frightening detail.  David Keith, as the assigned mentor to the recruit, does his job perfectly here by not showing too much sympathy.But then it all crashes down by trying to come up with a clean, Hollywood, more upbeat ending.  The worst sin is the handling of the Pignatello character to make it much less tragic. To leave out what happens after the court martial is to take away one of the dramatic points of the story.  With that said, the ending was also much too neat.  The way it is handled fails to illustrate the parallel love-hate relationship the main character has with the academy.This was far too personal a story to be glossed over like this, and I wish Pat Conroy had had more pull to get it done right.  He should have chosen the Larry McMurtry route and got the story filmed as a mini-series.",2,"Almost had it, but stumbles badly in the stretch",1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,1800,"['movie', 'six', 'hours', 'could', 'have', 'captured', 'anywhere', 'complexity', 'subplots', 'Pat', 'Conroy', 'novel', 'life', 'military', 'academy', 'was', 'very', 'forgiving', 'what', 'what', 'cut', 'out', 'even', 'painfully', 'so', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'three', 'years', 'was', 'almost', 'nothing', 'passion', 'basketball', 'love', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'itself.But', 'things', 'had', 'go', 'rather', 'treat', 'badly', 'have', 'resentment', 'what', 'left', 'out', 'movie', 'concentrate', 'important', 'things', 'however', 'awhile', 'well', 'see', 'often', 'cruel', 'treatment', 'upperclassmen', 'give', 'underclassmen', 'can', 'see', 'reasoning', 'why', 'be', 'necessary', 'overriding', 'theme', 'book', 'givers', 'takers', 'harrassment', 'very', 'well.It', 'also', 'tackle', 'one', 'important', 'subplots', 'treatment', 'first', 'black', 'recruit', 'academy', 'way', 'recruit', 'was', 'treated', 'shown', 'frightening', 'detail', 'David', 'Keith', 'assigned', 'mentor', 'recruit', 'job', 'perfectly', 'here', 'not', 'showing', 'too', 'much', 'sympathy.But', 'then', 'crashes', 'down', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'clean', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'worst', 'sin', 'handling', 'Pignatello', 'character', 'make', 'much', 'less', 'tragic', 'leave', 'out', 'what', 'court', 'martial', 'take', 'away', 'one', 'dramatic', 'points', 'story', 'said', 'ending', 'was', 'also', 'much', 'too', 'neat', 'way', 'handled', 'fails', 'illustrate', 'parallel', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'main', 'character', 'academy.This', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'personal', 'story', 'be', 'glossed', 'wish', 'Pat', 'Conroy', 'had', 'had', 'more', 'pull', 'get', 'done', 'right', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'route', 'got', 'story', 'filmed', 'mini-series']",Lords of Discipline VHS

Yes, the book is much more detailed and interesting at certain points but it would be impossible to adapt it all into the movie.  Standing on its own, this film still delivers.Will McClean is in his senior year at the Carolina Military Institute in 1964 in the Deep South.  For the first time in the institute's history, they're going to admit a black cadet and this at a time when racial issues are still readily evident.  Will is directed by his chain of command to protect this individual and track his progress.  What is not known right away is information about a secret society within the institute known as `The 10'.  This group recruits the best cadets from within the ranks but prey on the weak and unfortunate who they decide are not worthy of remaining in the institute.  And they use whatever methods they deem necessary to force out the undesirables.As the year progresses, disturbing events begin to happen and Will learns new information about `The 10' regarding just how powerful and influential they are.  So much so that it may seriously jeopardize his relationship with his roommates and his career.  Forced to question his beliefs in an honorable military system and compelled to make the right decisions no matter the cost, he risks everything in a dramatic and exciting showdown with `The 10'.  This leads to a nice conclusion to the movie.If you have or haven't read the book that this movie is based on, it's really not that bad in and of itself.  There are a few weak points now and again but the cast is good, the story holds together, and the acting is pretty solid.  Just don't go into watching this while comparing everything to the book because that'll be a let down.  I know because I watched it again after reading the book.

I have an old VHS recording of the film, which I have viewed many times.  I have also read the book many times, and I consider it to be Conroy's best work.This is the story of four young men at Carolina Military Institute, a fictional military academy located in South Carolina, which is of course a pseudonym for The Citadel, which is a fine military academy that really does exist.  The film is set in the 1960s.  The first black cadet (first year cadets are called ""knobs"" at the Institute) has just arrived.  A secret society within the Institute, known as ""The Ten"" has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the Institute, regardless of ability.David Keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet's designated mentor.  The plot moves at a fast pace, but nevertheless does not feel rushed.  Purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel.  I feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete, and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries.I liked the script, the acting, and the ending.

Sadly there were once secret societies in some of our nations military universities. As I understand it they took root after the civil war. Essentially there were I'm very sad to write even at West Point at one time a southern racist society of students just like the '10' depicted in this movie.
