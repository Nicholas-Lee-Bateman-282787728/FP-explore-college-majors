I simply do not understand selling products that only certain people can buy. Movies have always been sold in forms that anyone could watch. Anyone can watch a film. Anyone can watch a VHS version (all VHS players play VHS tapes). Anyone can watch a DVD (all DVD players play DVDs). Why have you made it proprietary Amazon? I would like to give you money and have you give me stuff in return. I can't in this case.

571665,AC4QPFQBSWN1N,B000057MJG,"D. Tucker ""Jukebox""","[2, 2]","40 Guns to Apache Pass was a Columbia Pictures production. This review is of how Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has ignored our greatest war hero and not of the poor quality of this offering. This release is not one of Columbia Pictures/SPHE's. Our greatest war hero's memory deserves better treatment. I will purchase this DVD when Sony remasters it for DVD release. Even better, Sony should remaster Audie Murphy's remaining movies not yet released on DVD onto a series of Blu-Ray collections befitting a man of his stature. Randolph Scott deserves the same multiple Blu-Ray collections of his many westerns he starred in. C'mon Sony, start mining those golden nuggets in your vaults, polish them up (remaster) and release them in standard DVD and Blu-Ray to protect them for posterity and to give us western movie collectors something worth buying. I buy 20 western DVDs and Blu-Rays to 1 modern movie today because they knew good story telling back in the day and morals of right and wrong were reinforced with their telling. Today, we have many people wondering through life without a moral compass. But, I digress. Please give Audie and Randolph the respect they deserve and do it right! You have gold mines in your vaults if you'd only realize it and treat their fans and these stars of long ago the way they should be treated. I have written to SPHE already. I hope others will too.

571667,A274K3SRIM78BF,B000057MJG,Joe Bybel,"[8, 8]","I watched this movie on the Western channel a few weeks ago which prompted this purchase. A good movie starring one of my all-time favorites Audie Murphy. Now on to the DVD - The video needs to be remastered. It looks like a VHS copy put on a disc. This movie is good enough for some studio to remaster it. I wasn't happy with the video transfer but it's not a total loss. It is decent enough to watch. I would recommend that if you wan't to buy this to not pay a high price for it. I will keep this DVD because i'm a fan of Murphy and Calvary versus Indian movies. Being that this is an older release it may be the only copy that I ever get of this film, that would be a shame.
