The series shocked many Germans and was a great success.  I waited quite a while for the release of this series that I loved.  It was moving and realistic.  It was one of the best performances of Streep and James Woods.  I was disappointed with quality of production.  The picture was not as sharp as most 1940's conversions from film to digital format.  Also the missing segments left the series disjointed. The transition form one scene to the next made no sense.  Who ever did this release did not do a favor to this wonderful series.

The story follows a family, the Weiss's, and their trials and tribulations across Europe at this brutally difficult time. The series was notable for the appearance of Meryl Streep as a German girl, Inga Helms Weiss, married to a Jewish husband, Karl, James Woods. In four parts the series covers Kristallnacht, the formation of the Jewish ghettos and the later use of Gas Chambers. The cast is uniformly good with Fritz Weaver, Timothy Bottoms, David Warner, T P McKenna and others filling important roles.

I have it on VHS, but some works, like ""Holocaust"", have earned the right to be presented on DVD.While not entirely historically accurate in the details -- most of the characters are fictional aggregates of real people -- the depiction of the events is realistic and, sadly, not in the least bit exaggerated. If anything, it had to be toned down because the brutality of what transpired is simply too intense for most viewers -- and probably movie-makers -- to stomach.This mini-series is probably not appropriate for very young children, but it is definitely appropriate for teenagers. A place should be made in history classes (they do still teach history, right?) for viewing and discussing movies like ""Holocaust"" andRoots. If the school doesn't do it, the parents should.Before people start thinking that ""Holocaust"" is little more than a thinly-veiled documentary, let me assure you that it's story telling at its best. In fact, there are many stories happening against the backdrop of the holocaust. Some are tragic, some inspiring, some triumphant, and some... well, some personal downfalls are just sweet to savor.As a counterpoint to this intensely dramatic series, I recommend the blood-chillingThe Wannsee Conferencefor a mind-numbing inside look at the event that launched the holocaust proper.

369924,A17V5NNFG7QGKS,6303338569,Eve Galewitz,"[1, 1]","In the early days of the 21st century it is hard for us to imagine, but following World War II the subject of the Nazi holocaust was hardly spoken about.  The majority of those who survived did not speak about the atrocities they witnessed and suffered.The subject of the holocaust began to appear in literature in the late 1950's and 1960's with the publication of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and ""Night"" by Elie Wiesel; and later in films such as ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" and the ""Pawnbroker"".  However, by the 1970's universities and high schools began introducing the topic in history and literature classes.  Encouraged by the overwhelmingly postive response from educators, students and the general public, survivors began to tell their stories and thus a genre of literature was born.As the topic of the holocaust covers a wide swath of geography and time (1933-1945) the mini-series format seemed ideal.  With their success in the mini-series genre in the 1970's NBC decided approach the topic of the holocaust in the same manner.The stars were aligned when the cast was assembled, as it included:  Meryl Streep, James Woods, Michael Moriarty, Rosemary Harris, Tovah Feldshuh, Tom Bell, Sam Wanamaker, Ian Holm, Robert Stephens, Fritz Weaver, Michael Beck, Blanche Baker & Joe Bottoms.  This brilliant ensemble was made up of classically trained American & British actors all at the top of their game.  Streep was just becoming known having appeared in the ""Deer Hunter"" just before Holocaust and had not yet done ""Sophie's Choice"".  Moriarty and Woods were known as top-notch actors within the industry, but neither had yet attained name recognition, they would later achieve.Holocaust only faultered in two respects.  It greatly santized historical events and it relied on stereotypes in creating characters.  Bottoms and Feldshuh beautiful healthy looks belied the fact that Rudy and Helena were hiding out in the woods of eastern Europe for 4 years.  The family Weiss are a stereotypical Jewish family.  A renowned Jewish doctor's family; his well-to-do cultured German wife; his sensitive artist son; his lovely daughter, Anna who is supposed to evoke Anne Frank, who plays the family Bechstein; and lastly Rudy, the athlete and fighter, who will be the prototype for the new Jew re-born in Palestine/Israel.These however, are my only critiques, as everything else about Holocaust was done brilliantly. The musical score is haunting; the writing was clear and strong despite the difficulty of competing plotlines; and the brilliant performances by Wood, Streep & Moriarty are unforgettable 30 years later.A decade later, Dan Curtis and ABC Television would take on the subject of World War II and the holocaust in greater and more detailed study in Herman Wouk's ""Winds of War"" and ""War & Remembrance"".  My recommendation is to see Holocaust then follow-up with the two ABC programs to see a different and more detailed look at the same events.",4,Well Done Mini-Series,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,2955,"['early', 'days', '21st', 'century', 'hard', 'imagine', 'following', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'subject', 'Nazi', 'holocaust', 'was', 'hardly', 'spoken', 'about', 'majority', 'who', 'survived', 'did', 'not', 'speak', 'atrocities', 'witnessed', 'suffered.The', 'subject', 'holocaust', 'began', 'appear', 'literature', 'late', '1950', '1960', 'publication', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Night', 'Elie', 'Wiesel', 'later', 'films', 'such', 'Judgement', 'Nuremberg', 'Pawnbroker', 'However', '1970', 'universities', 'high', 'schools', 'began', 'introducing', 'topic', 'history', 'literature', 'classes', 'Encouraged', 'overwhelmingly', 'postive', 'response', 'educators', 'students', 'general', 'public', 'survivors', 'began', 'tell', 'stories', 'thus', 'genre', 'literature', 'was', 'topic', 'holocaust', 'wide', 'swath', 'geography', 'time', '1933-1945', 'mini-series', 'format', 'seemed', 'ideal', 'success', 'mini-series', 'genre', '1970', 'NBC', 'decided', 'approach', 'topic', 'holocaust', 'same', 'manner.The', 'stars', 'were', 'aligned', 'when', 'cast', 'was', 'assembled', 'included', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'James', 'Woods', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'Tom', 'Bell', 'Sam', 'Wanamaker', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Robert', 'Stephens', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'Blanche', 'Baker', 'Joe', 'Bottoms', 'brilliant', 'ensemble', 'was', 'made', 'classically', 'trained', 'American', 'British', 'actors', 'top', 'game', 'Streep', 'was', 'just', 'becoming', 'known', 'having', 'appeared', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'just', 'Holocaust', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'done', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'Moriarty', 'Woods', 'were', 'known', 'top-notch', 'actors', 'industry', 'had', 'yet', 'attained', 'name', 'recognition', 'would', 'later', 'achieve.Holocaust', 'only', 'faultered', 'two', 'respects', 'greatly', 'santized', 'historical', 'events', 'relied', 'stereotypes', 'creating', 'characters', 'Bottoms', 'Feldshuh', 'beautiful', 'healthy', 'looks', 'belied', 'fact', 'Rudy', 'Helena', 'were', 'hiding', 'out', 'woods', 'eastern', 'Europe', '4', 'years', 'family', 'Weiss', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'Jewish', 'family', 'renowned', 'Jewish', 'doctor', 'family', 'well-to-do', 'cultured', 'German', 'wife', 'sensitive', 'artist', 'son', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'who', 'supposed', 'evoke', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'who', 'family', 'Bechstein', 'lastly', 'Rudy', 'athlete', 'fighter', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'prototype', 'new', 'Jew', 're-born', 'Palestine/Israel.These', 'however', 'are', 'only', 'critiques', 'everything', 'else', 'Holocaust', 'was', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'musical', 'score', 'haunting', 'writing', 'was', 'clear', 'strong', 'difficulty', 'competing', 'plotlines', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Wood', 'Streep', 'Moriarty', 'are', 'unforgettable', '30', 'years', 'later.A', 'decade', 'later', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'ABC', 'Television', 'would', 'take', 'subject', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'holocaust', 'greater', 'more', 'detailed', 'study', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'Winds', 'War', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'recommendation', 'see', 'Holocaust', 'then', 'follow-up', 'two', 'ABC', 'programs', 'see', 'different', 'more', 'detailed', 'look', 'same', 'events']",Holocaust EP mode  VHS

Even after seeing it on TV years ago, a revisit is well worth the time. It is a fictional account of families on both sides of the Nazi/Jewish account. It was not really Germany, but political and ambitious desire coupled with individual egos that caused the atrocity to happen. This story is about the families Weiss, Dorf, Helms, Lowy, & the Berlin SS staff.Years after 9-11, Viet Nam, Korea, well, so many conflicts, the look back at WWII and the systematic annihilation attempt toward the European Jewish population takes on even more significance. Can it happen again? Who will say no?In this dramatization of wartime relationships, love till death, survival struggles, accountability, and history itself, a fantastic cast was assembled. At the time some of the cast were less known, such as Meryl Streep who did magnificently as Inga. But others, Rudi (Joseph Bottoms), Dr. Weiss (Fritz Weaver), Berta Weiss (Rosemary Harris), and others made you feel a part of their family. Tovah Feldshuh as Helena turned heads with her beauty as well as her emotional acting. Capt/Maj Dorf (Michael Moriarty) was so convincing that you soon got to hate him and his 'kill anyone' drive to promotion. Artist Karl Weiss (James Woods) began a huge career after this performance. The potential for picking out great acting moments is endless over this 3 DVD-5 part miniseries. One bad role was the Weiss youngest, perhaps a writing fault, not acting.The show is timeless, being a period presentation (1935-45). The division of families and the directions their lives take them, makes this show give a comprehensive look at what took place, not just in Germany, but Poland, Russia, 'work' camps, and more. There is no definitive DVD on the Holocaust topic. ""Schindler's List"" is another that should be seen by everyone for a perspective of what happened, and the fact that not all were to blame.This is truly a must see for anyone remotely interested in knowing more of the emotion and heartache that was caused by the Holocaust. It got me thinking of my own 3/4 German ancestry, the predominant German community where I live, and the fact that politics can become so corrupted that horror can win over humanity. It's been said that some guilty Nazi participants tried to confess due to the TV airing of this saga series. It's that impacting. it does have a short lighter ending which helps settle the nerves after watching for 7 1/2 hours.NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. CC was available.

It is his role that shows the true horror of the ""solution"", a decent man who lets the ""evil"" spread because he wants to get ahead. His last scene, in a small office surrounded by to American officers trying to justify his role and his horror at their revulsion of him and his speech is one of the best ever put on screen and lays the truth of the story bare. Mr. Moriarty makes a monster very human and even makes you feel sorry for him as the reality of his crime becomes apparent to him and his total meltdown leaves you drained.This is not for the faint of heart as nothing is spared and the worst is seen. Even after all these years, the anger at the death of a group of mentally ill persons in the back of a van, wells up and as the film moves on the feeling that this couldn't have happened gives way to the sad truth that it did happen and if not watched has and will happen again.The Mini-series at it's best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,A stunning testament to a time when a group of EVIL men lead Europe down a road that turned the Earth into a grave yard,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,1787,"['Words', 'fail', 'describe', 'what', 'fine', 'production', 'shows', 'final', 'solution', 'was', 'born', 'grew', 'worst', 'example', 'man', 'capacity', 'pure', 'evil', 'cast', 'Joseph', 'Bottoms', 'James', 'Woods', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'stunning', 'Weiss', 'family', 'friends', 'story', '1935', 'end', 'war', 'Europe.Streep', 'won', 'Emmy', 'award', 'James', 'Woods', 'non', 'Jewish', 'wife', 'who', 'must', 'endure', 'horror', 'horror', 'attempt', 'keep', 'husband', 'alive', 'one', 'camp', 'real', 'stand', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Moriarty', 'friend', 'man', 'who', 'Nazi', 'party', 'lower', 'level', 'who', 'ambition', 'wife', 'push', 'point', 'charge', 'camps', 'soft', 'spoken', 'almost', 'wallflower', 'who', 'demonstrations', 'gas', 'chambers', 'orders', 'new', 'faster', 'ways', 'death', 'be', 'found', 'role', 'true', 'horror', 'solution', 'decent', 'man', 'who', 'evil', 'spread', 'get', 'ahead', 'last', 'scene', 'small', 'office', 'surrounded', 'American', 'officers', 'trying', 'justify', 'role', 'horror', 'revulsion', 'speech', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'put', 'screen', 'truth', 'story', 'bare', 'Mr.', 'Moriarty', 'monster', 'very', 'human', 'even', 'feel', 'sorry', 'reality', 'crime', 'apparent', 'total', 'meltdown', 'drained.This', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'nothing', 'spared', 'worst', 'seen', 'Even', 'years', 'anger', 'death', 'group', 'mentally', 'ill', 'persons', 'back', 'van', 'up', 'film', 'moves', 'feeling', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened', 'way', 'sad', 'truth', 'did', 'happen', 'not', 'watched', 'will', 'happen', 'again.The', 'Mini-series', 'best']",Holocaust EP mode  VHS

Laurey,"[1, 1]","For those who may remember the initial airing of this miniseries in 1978 but didn't see it (some of us were more concerned with hitting the discos and learning the lastest dance moves)-- take the opportunity to catch up on what you missed. These characters beautifully represent all the real-life people who were caught up in the madness of WWII Germany. The cast is exceptional, playing both victims and tormentors--believable and very moving. Ms. Streep is generally mentioned most often, and of course earns her accolades, but she's matched every step of the way by the rest of the players. Decades before teen audiences were introduced to her as Peter Parker's Aunt May in the ""Spiderman"" series, Rosemary Harris established a solid career, and as Berta Weiss in ""Holocaust"", she can break your heart with one look. Michael Moriarty and Deborah Norton are horrifyingly convincing as the nice, lower-middle-class couple who fall for the SS propaganda hook, line, and sinker.  Particularly disturbing is a scene showing them singing Christmas carols as a family, around the piano while one child burns photos of the victimized Weiss family in the fireplace. For me, that remains more indelible and monstrous than the usual images of the thin-lipped, cruel SS officers who tortured their victims in the concentration camps...although those scenes are chillingly present as well. Marta Dorf and her easily-manipulated husband Erik represent the most dangerous, unlikely monsters of World War II:  the nice, everyday people who went about their Christian, family-oriented, churchgoing lives while they pretended they weren't actively involved in the slaughter of millions of innocent people....didn't they ever stop to imagine that it could have been their own families, their own children,literally ripped apart?  Well worth your time to see this----the ending is a bit abrupt, but so was life at that time.

369943,A14A4YYKPLYY26,6303338569,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[2, 2]","Because theHolocaustminiseries aired on TV before I was even born, it wasn't until it was shown again on The History Channel sometime in the late 90s that I saw it for the first time. At that time, I was very disappointed by the lack of closure for the characters at the end of the movie. But because I'd seen it on TV, in what I assumed was syndication, I just thought that some of the scenes had been cut in order to make room for more commercials and that I'd get to see those scenes when it was released on home video (or later on, on DVD or Blu-Ray). But several years later, when the movie was finally released on DVD, and I bought one, I saw that the ending of the movie was still just as abrupt as the version I saw on TV, and was hugely disappointed to read that the DVD ""may be edited from its original network version"". Since I wasn't even born yet, when the network version aired, I never got to see that version, so I had no way of knowing what scenes had been cut (and were missing) from the DVD version -- and even though I got an official VHS set that said it was the original full-length version of the movie, the ending was still the same as both the TV version I saw as well as the DVD set.I have been extremely interested in the subject/era of the Holocaust ever since I was around 9 years old, and I saw some of the concentration-camp scenes inWar and Remembrancewhich had a profound effect on me. Although it gave me terrible nightmares for awhile (as did reading Viktor Frankl'sMan's Search for Meaningwhich I'd read some passages of around that same time) it sparked a very deep & lifelong interest (some family members have even called it an ""obsession"") in the Holocaust.Although this is a GREAT movie, the DVD release itself is very shoddy! Not only have they admitted that scenes have been cut (though I don't know/can't tell yet what they are) the quality of the video & sound shows how cheaply its been produced and released -- utterly NOT representative of all the technology available at their disposal to remaster the video & sound to modern, digital & even HD standards!***** 5 STARS for the movie itself!*** 3 STARS for this MEDIOCRE DVD Release!**** 4 STARS overall but yet a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!From the ""blurb"" on the back of the DVD set box:A Story of Hope in a Time of DespairOscar winner Meryl Streep, James Woods and Michael Moriarty star in this epic miniseries, winner of numerous awards including eight Emmy Awards, two Golden Globes and a Peabody Award. This three-disc anniversary edition marks the first presentation of the groundbreaking miniseries on DVD.Holocaust follows the tragedy and triumph of the Weiss famly of Berlin, and intertwines their fate as European Jews with the story of a German family, the Dorfs, whose members include a high-ranking Nazi officer. Filmed on location in Germany and Austria, Holocaust uses the stories of these fictional families to portray the atrocities against the Jewish people from the 1930s to 1945, and presents a heart-wrenching portrait of their struggle.** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!! **Holocaustis the harrowing & heartbreaking story of two German families from Berlin, prior to, and during World War II -- one a Christian family who become Nazis out of economic necessity, and eventually become bloodthirsty, remorseless mass murderers, and the other, a Jewish family who become their victims, and whose lives are gradually but systematically destroyed in the diabolically evil genocide known as the ""Shoah, or more commonly called the HOLOCAUST.The ""Aryan"" Dorf family, is headed by Erik (played to CHILLING perfection by Michael Moriarty [of the early seasons of theLaw & OrderTV series])  a charming & brilliant, yet unemployed German lawyer who struggles to to find work to support his wife Marta (Deborah Norton) and two young children, Peter and Laura. At the insistence of sickly (but yet, still extremely ambitious-for-her-husband) wife, Erik joins the Nazi Party out of sheer desperation to earn income, but then rapidly advances within the SS, and in a short time, becomes essentially the ""right-hand man"" for Reinhard Heydrich (David Warner) a top-level Nazi and one of the engineers of the ""Final Solution"". As Erik rises up the ranks, and is constantly bombarded with & brainwashed by Nazi ideology, he is soon transformed from someone who, in the beginning, had little to no interest in politics, and is such a meek, mild-mannered & gentle man, that seems the type unable to harm even a fly and becomes a ruthless cold-blooded killer who's main & primary concern is career advancement, and loyalty to ""the Fatherland"" & the F&uuml;hrer. Encouraged by Marta, who is insanely obsessed with her husband's ambition (and at least in the beginning, his lack thereof!) and career advancement to the exclusion of nearly everything else, Erik abandons all morals, empathy, values & ethics, and is able to not only justify but order and even actively participate in the slaughter of millions.The other family is the completely assimilated German-Jewish, and at least in the beginning, the middle to upper-class Weiss family, headed by Dr. Josef Weiss (Fritz Weaver) a Polish-born & raised, general physician, and his cultured, aristocratic, and usually domineering German-born & raised wife, Berta (Rosemary Harris), who came from a ""Hoch-Deutsch"" family, whose ancestors were ethnic German ""court Jews"" and friends of princes & cardinals. Together, Josef & Berta have three children -- and in the beginning of the book, they are twenty-something artist, Karl (James Woods), teenage athlete & star soccer player Rudi (Joseph Bottoms), and preteen Anna (Blanche Baker)Holocaustbegins in 1935 in Berlin, with the wedding of Karl and and Inga Helms (Meryl Streep) an ""Aryan"" Christian woman. Meanwhile, the unemployed Erik and his ill wife Marta, go to see Dr. Josef Weiss, who diagnoses a systolic heart murmur, and discover that Dr. Weiss had also treated Erik Dorf's parents, as well as Erik during his childhood, decades earlier. Later, unable to find decent employment, and struggling to support his family, at the insistence of his wife, Erik interviews with Reinhard Heydrich for a job in the Nazi Party and as the old saying goes, ""the rest is history!""Beginning with the wedding of Karl & Inga in 1935, this miniseries spans the period from 1938 to 1945 and covers all the events in the Holocaust, from Kristallnacht to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the Sobibor death camp revolt, and ultimately the end of World War II & the liberation of the camps.  It portrays all the crimes of the Nazis, including ""Kristallnacht"", the ""Action T4 euthanasia"" murders of the disabled, the Babi Yar massacres, the deportations to & imprisonment in the ghettos, and of course, the murders of millions in the death camps.Holocaustis a searingly moving story, that drives home the magnitude of death, pain & destruction caused by the Hitler and his Nazi thugs during the Third Reich -- and how utterly senseless it all was.  After seeing this TV miniseries, I just felt so bereft at the thought of how many happy & loving families like the Weiss family were ruthlessly destroyed for no reason.Just like with the majority of the Holocaust-related books or films that I've read or seen over the years, I was left feeling drained, defeated and devastated at how millions of innocent people were senselessly & brutally murdered -- and especially that the rest of the world just sat by  day after day, week after week, and month after month for YEARS and just let it happen, and worse, keep happening. For all the claims & promises of ""Never Again"", the rest of the world has still sat by while genocide after genocide continues to happen -- in Cambodia, in North Korea, in Israel/Palestine, in Serbia/Croatia/Bosnia-Hercegovina, in Rwanda, the Sudan, and Sierra Leone, and in Uganda, the Congo, Darfur and so many others!Unfortunately, the world seems to have learned NOTHING from the Holocaust, and that is one of the saddest & scariest things of all!! :(",4,"Good Movie, But VERY DISAPPOINTING DVD!!!",1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,8040,"['theHolocaustminiseries', 'aired', 'TV',

I remember sitting on the couch with my entire family since my mother wanted us to see what happened to the Jews during WWII in Nazi Germany. Back then, what I saw made an everlasting impression and got me hooked on everything that was Jewish. Since then, I've been reading books and watching movies and documentaries on the Children of Abraham... Anyway, after more than twenty years, I rented this TV movie to bring back the memories of the old times. The movie is moving and compelling. The only criticism that I have is that it uses the broad term Christianity when it's actually specifically referring to Catholicism; also, in a couple of scenes it looks like an apologetic portrayal of Catholicism as the last bastion against the Nazi horror, when it is common knowledge that the Catholic church had at last a dubious role in the handling of the matter of the Jews during that period. Other than that, the movie is truly poignant and well acted by the protagonists. Perhaps, the most incredible thing is how those monsters could coldly murders millions of innocent people and then go back to their families at Christmas, sing ""Silent Night,"" and boldly proclaim to their children that they were defending the civilization of Western Europe from the threat of the Jews, the killers of Christ, like they themselves, with their folly, were not killing the spirit of Christ not one, but six million times.",4,"Haunting and Sorrowful, But...",1023494400,"06 8, 2002",2002,1462,"['was', 'kid', 'when', 'saw', 'mini-series', 'TV', 'Italy', 'remember', 'sitting', 'couch', 'entire', 'family', 'mother', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'Jews', 'WWII', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Back', 'then', 'what', 'saw', 'made', 'everlasting', 'impression', 'got', 'hooked', 'everything', 'was', 'Jewish', 'then', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'books', 'watching', 'movies', 'documentaries', 'Children', 'Abraham', 'Anyway', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'rented', 'TV', 'movie', 'bring', 'back', 'memories', 'old', 'times', 'movie', 'moving', 'compelling', 'only', 'criticism', 'have', 'broad', 'term', 'Christianity', 'when', 'actually', 'specifically', 'referring', 'Catholicism', 'also', 'couple', 'scenes', 'apologetic', 'portrayal', 'Catholicism', 'last', 'bastion', 'Nazi', 'horror', 'when', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Catholic', 'church', 'had', 'last', 'dubious', 'role', 'handling', 'matter', 'Jews', 'period', 'Other', 'movie', 'truly', 'poignant', 'well', 'acted', 'protagonists', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'incredible', 'thing', 'how', 'monsters', 'could', 'coldly', 'murders', 'millions', 'innocent', 'people', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'families', 'Christmas', 'sing', 'Silent', 'Night', 'boldly', 'proclaim', 'children', 'were', 'defending', 'civilization', 'Western', 'Europe', 'threat', 'Jews', 'killers', 'Christ', 'folly', 'were', 'not', 'killing', 'spirit', 'Christ', 'not', 'one', 'six', 'million', 'times']",Holocaust EP mode  VHS

The most unforgettable character is the chillingly cold-blooded German, Erik Dorf, played by Michael Moriarty.  His soul-less blue eyes will haunt you long after the story is finished.  One of Heydrich's SS hacks, Dorf is the master of the euphemism- calling the Nazi Final Solution for the annihilation of millions of Jews ""special handling"", calling the death camps ""Family Camps"", justifying his cruel acts as ""just following orders"", the way so many Nazis tried to justify their barbarous deeds. The scenes of the higher echelon Nazi officers reviewing the slides of the various methods of efficiently killing Jews are unfathomable in their coldness and snide comments.One particularly unforgettable scene is when various cripples, mental defectives, and psychiatric patients arrive at Haldamar, a ""sanitarium"", who willingly enter a long room where they are summarily gassed to death by carbon monoxide exhaust from a truck engine.  This was one of the early methods of purifying the Aryan race from undesirables. The question has been asked, ""How was it humanly possible?""

What is (to me at least) unique about it is the way it is presented.We follow two families from the rise to power of the Nazi party in German (circa 1934 or so) to the end  of World War II. The Weiss family (a Jewish family) and the Dorf's, who  portrays an SS family man's perspective.As the film unfolds we are  treated to the unjustness, apprehension and then horror to which the Jews  of Europe were subjected -- thru the experiences of the family Weiss -  their family slowly broken up and sent away, first to ghettos, then  ultimately to the death camps.On the other side, we see where a  'typical' SS man comes from. Erik Dorf is an unemployed lawyer whose wife  is sickly (and under the care of Dr Josef Weiss) without even the liklihood  of a job. Concerned with how to pay his debts, he ends up a lieutenant of  the SS working directly for Heydrich.What is most interesting to me in  the story is the transformation of young Dorf from a conscientous young man  with high hopes into an SS Major, a merciless killer. It provides an  insight as to why so many were anxious to wear the black uniform of the SS.  One has to ask the question, &quot;What would I do if I were living in  those times and in that situation? Would I speak out and end up in a labor  camp with the outcasts, or would I follow society and try to survive the  turmoil?&quot;.Characterizations are good and wholly believable. There  is much which tells of the dilemma some of the German aryan people must  have felt. For instance, Inga Helms Weiss -- aryan wife of the Jewish Karl  Weiss; 'Uncle' Kurt Dorf -- who tried to keep a handful of Jews from  Auswitz's death chambers; and Father Lichtenberg -- a christian priest who  spoke out for the Jews and their plight.If you'd like to understand what  human beings must have felt and had to endure in Nazi Germany - on both  sides of the fence - this is a good film to watch.

Here she wears long blonde-auburn hair and is very focused. Perhaps her ambition explains the lack of affectation so wearying in her star performances. Playing a Polish Catholic with ironic comparisons with her later Sophie's Choice, she uses her American accent. In fact the international cast which includes James Woods, Fritz Weaver, Sam Wanamaker, Rosemary Harris, Ian Holm, David Warner and Michael Moriarty are a mix of accents but it does not jar since the script by Gerald Green and the direction by Marvin J Chomsky are so good. The video release  is 3 tapes and 7.5 hours long, presenting the story of the members of the Jewish Weiss family as they live and die through Europe from 1935-1945. Cynics may baulk at the chance of someone being present or involved in every major event but Weiss is a big family and the approach personalises historical abstraction. I particularly like Green's insight into Nazi internal politics, the fact that there is no Hitler character, and Chomsky's decision not to show inside the gas chambers. Any attempt would be a disappointment and seeing someone eyehole it and then describe it as like &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot; allows you to imagine your own nightmare.

369962,A1BQPKQHV78M8,6303338569,Raul Vasquez,"[10, 13]","The ""Holocaust"" mini-series is still the most accurate depiction of the Jewish plight during the Second World War.  The Holocaust mini-series was NBC's answer to ABC's ""Roots"".  Although the mini-series is over seven hours long, it never misses a beat.  The mini-series is over 25 years old and it can hardly qualify as dated.  The only thing that remains is a crisp DVD transfer. For the time being if one wants the best picture quality available, I recommend tracking down a copy recorded in SP.""Holocaust"" is very appealing due to its historical accuracy and completeness.  The time span that the miniseries covers is equivalent to that of the reign of the Third Reich (1933-1945). True events are depicted with the broad frame of the Holocaust.  But in the end, the most likeable part of ""Holocaust"" is its character portrayals be it historical or fictional.  The historical characters are brilliantly portrayed by some of England's finest actors. David Warner plays Reinhard Heydrich with the utmost conviction.  It is no wonder that he won an Emmy for his performance.  Ian Holm (known to today's audience as Bilbo from Lord of the Rings) likewise is excellent as Heinrich Himmler. Other historical characters that are well portrayed are Adolf Eichmann, Hans Frank, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Rudolf Hoess, and Mordecai Anielewicz.  The fictional characters of the Weiss family and Erik Dorf (astounding performance by Michael Moriarty) serves a purpose as well to say the least.  The Weiss family characters were created to give the viewer the Jewish perspective of the war.  When the family is eventually separated from each other, the viewer has the opportunity to witness the events of Babi Yar, Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Kristallnacht, and the Warsaw uprising to name a few. James Woods, Meryl Streep and Rosemary Harris (she currently plays Aunt May in the Spider-man movies) do a wonderful job bringing these characters to life. But it is ultimately Michael Moriarty who really shines with his brilliant performance as the cold-blooded Nazi Erik Dorf. Although the character of Erik Dorf is fictional, it provides the viewer with a plausible scenario as to how an ""ordinary"" obscure German can rise through the ranks of the Third Reich and become evil personified.The soundtrack to ""Holocaust"" consists of original music composed by Morton Gould as well as samples of music by Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin. The music in general has its hints of melancholy and echoes of an earlier peaceful German society.""Holocaust"" also correctly portrays the Catholic Church in good light by presenting the true historical figure of Fr. Bernhard Lichtenberg (who along with Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein died for their faith).  It is an important aspect of the mini-series because recently the Catholic Church has been unjustly attacked with the accusation that Pope Pius XII did nothing for the Jews during the war. Nothing could be further from the truth. After all, shortly after the war Jewish leaders ranging from Golda Meir to Albert Einstein praised Pope Pius XII for saving tens of thousands of Jews.  It was only with the release of the fictional play ""The Deputy"" that people jumped on the bandwagon and began their assaults on Pius XII.  It is a pity that a man who saved more lives than Oskar Schindler and Raoul Wallenberg combined should be so vilified.

That is when I first saw it, when I was in high school.  I have not seen it since then, until a few days ago.  ironically, this movie was far more shocking to me now as a middle aged man, then it was when I first saw it as a teenager.  If one listens carefully to all that the nazis say, especially the character played by Michael Moriarty, one can get a really good understanding of what the nazis were all about, and why they represent evil in its purest, most diabolical form.  The acting is absolutely superb, most notably by the great Meryl Streep and James Woods, but so many others in the cast are also just phenomenally talented, such as Fritz Weaver, Rosemary Harris, Sam Wanamaker, Deborah Norton, and, of course, Michael Moriarty.  In fact, the acting is so flawless, and the story so unrelentlessly compelling, that it was just too intense for my rather sensitive nature, and so I found myself able to only take in a few minutes of it at a time.  This movie is extremely disturbing, as it should be, yet should be required viewing for anybody who cares to have a moral conscience.

When I saw the DVD was available and I had to obtain it for my library as it such a good production.  I could finally 'pension off' my old VHS tapes.That said, my complaint concerns the uniforms.  The rank collar patches for some of the SS Officers, especially Heydrich, were incorrect and on one occasion an SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer [ Lt Colonel ] is referred to a Major [ SS-Sturmbannfuhrer ].The black SS uniform was phased out in 1938 and replaced by the field gray to match the Army and Waffen [ armed ] SS formations.  The SS Officers in 'Holocaust' are still, on occasion, seen wearing the black uniform.The ReichsSicherheitDienst [ SD ] RFSS was the internal and external intelligence and information office and its members wore the field grey uniform and carried SS ranks.  The right hand collar patch in the SS carried the runes but in the SD the patch was black.  The SD was identified by the letters SD inside a diamond shaped badge called a rauter that was displayed on the lower left sleeve of the tunic.If a member of the SD was also in the Geheime StatsPolizei [ GeStaPo ] the silver letters SD were edged in silver instead of the plain black badge.  When Dorf joined the SS he was depicted with both the SS runes and the SD rauter on his uniform - the two were not worn together.The collar rank patches for the SS were re-designed in 1942 when a new rank of SS-Oberstgruppenfuher [ eq to the Army's Generaloberst ] was promulgated.  The new rank had three oak leaves pointed inward and three diamond shaped pips.At the time of his assassination in Prague Heydrich was an SS-Obergruppenfuhrer [ General ] and his collar patches in the later part of the series should have been depicted as three oak leaves pointed inward above two diamond shaped pips.  I don't believe this was accurately illustrated.I have noticed on many occasions concerning German [ especially SS ] uniforms where accuracy has been ignored.  The SS - Standartenfuhrer  [Colonel ] in 'Indiana Jones/ Last Crusade' was wearing at one time the SS black uniform then, in the desert scenes, a uniform I don't believe ever existed in the SS.  He also had  black lampassen [ stripes on the trouser legs ]- this distinction was only for generals.  I may be wrong but I believe the SS generals did not have lampassen on their uniforms.Himmler, Reichsfuhrer - SS, was very pedantic on uniform matters and issued orders that SS men were not to address each other by Army titles, as some did.  Some SS officers also wanted to have coloured piping on their caps to denote their specialist fields [ as the Army did ].  Himmler insisted that the piping was to be silver only.Roger DESHON",3,THE MINI SERIES ' HOLOCAUST',1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,2757,"['am', 'student', 'history', 'militaria', 'first', 'saw', 'programme', 'whilst', 'hospital', '1978', 'When', 'saw', 'DVD', 'was', 'available', 'had', 'obtain', 'library', 'good', 'production', 'could', 'finally', ""'pension"", 'off', 'old', 'VHS', 'tapes.That', 'said', 'complaint', 'uniforms', 'rank', 'collar', 'patches', 'SS', 'Officers', 'especially', 'Heydrich', 'were', 'incorrect', 'one', 'occasion', 'SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer', '[', 'Lt', 'Colonel', ']', 'referred', 'Major', '[', 'SS-Sturmbannfuhrer', ']', '.The', 'black', 'SS', 'uniform', 'was', 'phased', 'out', '1938', 'replaced', 'field', 'gray', 'match', 'Army', 'Waffen', '[', 'armed', ']', 'SS', 'formations', 'SS', 'Officers', ""'Holocaust"", 'are', 'still', 'occasion', 'seen', 'wearing', 'black', 'uniform.The', 'ReichsSicherheitDienst', '[', 'SD', ']', 'RFSS', 'was', 'internal', 'external', 'intelligence', 'information', 'office', 'members', 'wore', 'field', 'grey', 'uniform', 'carried', 'SS', 'ranks', 'right', 'hand', 'collar', 'patch', 'SS', 'carried', 'runes', 'SD', 'patch', 'was', 'black', 'SD', 'was', 'identified', 'letters', 'SD', 'diamond', 'shaped', 'badge', 'called', 'rauter', 'was', 'displayed', 'lower', 'left', 'sleeve', 'tunic.If', 'member', 'SD', 'was', 'also', 'Geheime', 'StatsPolizei', '[', 'GeStaPo', ']', 'silver', 'letters', 'SD', 'were', 'edged', 'silver', 'instead', 'plain', 'black', 'badge', 'When', 'Dorf', 'joined', 'SS', 'was', 'depicted', 'SS', 'runes', 'SD', 'rauter', 'uniform', 'two', 'were', 'not', 'worn', 'together.The', 'collar', 'rank', 'patches', 'SS', 'were', 're-designed', '1942', 'when', 'new', 'rank', 'SS-Oberstgruppenfuher', '[', 'eq', 'Army', 'Generaloberst', ']', 'was', 'promulgated', 'new', 'rank', 'had', 'three', 'oak', 'pointed', 'inward', 'three', 'diamond', 'shaped', 'pips.At', 'time', 'assassination', 'Prague', 'Heydrich', 'was', 'SS-Obergruppenfuhrer', '[', 'General', ']', 'collar', 'patches', 'later', 'part', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'depicted', 'three', 'oak', 'pointed', 'inward', 'two', 'diamond', 'shaped', 'pips', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'accurately', 'illustrated.I', 'have', 'noticed', 'many', 'occasions', 'concerning', 'German', '[', 'especially', 'SS', ']', 'where', 'accuracy', 'been', 'ignored', 'SS', 'Standartenfuhrer', '[', 'Colonel', ']', ""'Indiana"", 'Jones/', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'was', 'wearing', 'one', 'time', 'SS', 'black', 'uniform', 'then', 'desert', 'scenes', 'uniform', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ever', 'existed', 'SS', 'also', 'had', 'black', 'lampassen', '[', 'trouser', ']', 'distinction', 'was', 'only', 'generals', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'believe', 'SS', 'generals', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'lampassen', 'uniforms.Himmler', 'Reichsfuhrer', 'SS', 'was', 'very', 'pedantic', 'uniform', 'matters', 'issued', 'orders', 'SS', 'men', 'were', 'not', 'address', 'other', 'Army', 'titles', 'did', 'SS', 'officers', 'also', 'wanted', 'have', 'coloured', 'piping', 'caps', 'denote', 'specialist', 'fields', 'Army', 'did', ']', 'Himmler', 'insisted', 'piping', 'was', 'be', 'silver', 'only.Roger', 'DESHON']",Holocaust EP mode  VHS

Although it is a story that deals with the lives of I think 8 different characters, and therefore suffers from a slight loss in character identification, it remains a powerful film. The production values are superb, most of the acting is outstanding, and from what I know of that period in history (via Richard Evans' great books and others I've read) it manages to convey, accurately, the main events through the characters' experiences, and without undue exposition. Having said that, I think one's appreciation of the of the story can be helped by knowing the basic outline of the major events of the period, and the prime players in the Third Reich before watching the film.

369978,A3NSMGE2T71EGV,6303338569,voracious reader,"[2, 3]","This is the story of the Weiss family and The Dorff family during the holocaust.  The Weisses, an affluent well educated Jewish family living in Germany befalls the fate of all Jews living in Germany and Poland during WWII.  The Dorff family is a German family whose fortunes exceed their highest expectations by virtue of their persecution of the Jews.  Dr. Weiss and his family are all well rounded believable characters.  However, Dr. Weiss & his wife tend to view the world through rose colored glasses.  Like most German Jews they did not see the danger coming and believed it would all blow over until it was too late to leave.  I think the reality of what was about to happen was so horrific that people didn't want to believe it. Mr. Dorff who committs grevious crimes both personally and through his policies against the Jewish people is also seen as a good family man singing xmas carrols at home with his family. Mr Dorff is totally deluded in his assessment of his own conduct.  Prior to restrictions preventing Jewish doctors from treating Arayan patients Joseph Weiss treats the Dorff family.  Yet the Dorffs refuse to help them when Dr. Weisses son, Carl, is arrested.  One of my complaints about dramatizations of holocaust experiences is that the people portrayed always look a lot healthier than they were.  These actors were not thin enough for their roles.  Of course, if they had to have visual accuracy the actors would have been on death's door and unable to work.  Still anyone living in the ghettos or the camps were terribly thin and undernourished.  They had myriad bones protuding.  The characters in this movie some of whom like Mrs. Weiss who was plump were not credible.  James Woods who is  normally thin and Meryl Streep were more believable in body type.  The partisans normally healthier than ghetto or camp inmates still subsisted on meager diets of turnips and potatoes.  Rudy, his wife and the other partisans just don't  look like they are living on a subsistance diet.  There were a few Germans and clergy who helped but they were very few in number.  The clergy and the church in general bears substantial responsibility for this calamity.  Not enough Preists spoke out against it and of course, the Vatican which was the first foreign power to sign an accord with Hitler said and did nothing.  For more on this read Constantine's Sword by Carrol.  This is not a movie of happy endings.  Most of the characters perish.  In many families not one member survived Germany's goal of making the world Jew free.  The movie made an excellent point.  Hitler knew that the French and the British would say nothing about his perscution of the Jews, and they did not.  However, he was surprised at how little reaction he got from President Roosevelt.  The Germans were right.  No one wanted the Jews.  They are still right.  Today's anti-semitism is now cloaked in political thought as anti-Israeli sentiment.  Any rational person knowing the facts of the middle east dispute should come down on the side of the Israelis but we all know that Britain and France tend to side with the Arabs in any dispute with the Israelis.  Anti-semitism is alive and well in Europe. It is just wearing a different hat.Our DVD set is missing some of the beginning footage.  Apparently our DVD set is missing about 1/2 hour of the footage. I don't know if other sets have the footage and ours was just defective.  Still for a good mini-series on the holocaust I recommend this set of DVD's.  We spent an entire afternoon watching the whole series at one sitting with a break for a meal. Yet for a realistic portrait of the horrible conditions in which Jews lived during that time there is no substitute for the documentaries with actual film footage of the real ghettos and the camps.  If you are a teacher using this as a history teaching tool, it must be supllemented with footage of the real camps and ghettos.",5,Excellent & Entertaining Story of the Holocaust,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,3925,"['story', 'Weiss', 'family', 'Dorff', 'family', 'holocaust', 'Weisses', 'affluent', 'well', 'educated', 'Jewish', 'family', 'living', 'Germany', 'fate', 'Jews', 'living', 'Germany', 'Poland', 'WWII', 'Dorff', 'family', 'German', 'family', 'fortunes', 'exceed', 'highest', 'expectations', 'virtue', 'persecution', 'Jews', 'Dr.', 'Weiss', 'family', 'are', 'well', 'rounded', 'believable', 'characters', 'However', 'Dr.', 'Weiss', 'wife', 'tend', 'view', 'world', 'rose', 'colored', 'glasses', 'most', 'German', 'Jews', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'danger', 'coming', 'believed', 'would', 'all', 'blow', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'leave', 'think', 'reality', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'happen', 'was', 'so', 'horrific', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'Mr.', 'Dorff', 'who', 'committs', 'grevious', 'crimes', 'personally', 'policies', 'Jewish', 'people', 'also', 'seen', 'good', 'family', 'man', 'singing', 'xmas', 'carrols', 'home', 'family', 'Mr', 'Dorff', 'totally', 'deluded', 'assessment', 'own', 'conduct', 'Prior', 'restrictions', 'preventing', 'Jewish', 'doctors', 'treating', 'Arayan', 'patients', 'Joseph', 'Weiss', 'Dorff', 'family', 'Dorffs', 'refuse', 'help', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Weisses', 'son', 'Carl', 'arrested', 'One', 'complaints', 'dramatizations', 'holocaust', 'experiences', 'people', 'portrayed', 'always', 'look', 'lot', 'healthier', 'were', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'thin', 'enough', 'roles', 'course', 'had', 'have', 'visual', 'accuracy', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'death', 'door', 'unable', 'work', 'Still', 'anyone', 'living', 'ghettos', 'camps', 'were', 'terribly', 'thin', 'undernourished', 'had', 'myriad', 'bones', 'protuding', 'characters', 'movie', 'whom', 'Mrs.', 'Weiss', 'who', 'was', 'plump', 'were', 'not', 'credible', 'James', 'Woods', 'who', 'normally', 'thin', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'were', 'more', 'believable', 'body', 'type', 'partisans', 'normally', 'healthier', 'ghetto', 'camp', 'inmates', 'still', 'subsisted', 'meager', 'diets', 'turnips', 'potatoes', 'Rudy', 'wife', 'other', 'partisans', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'are', 'living', 'subsistance', 'diet', 'were', 'few', 'Germans', 'clergy', 'who', 'helped', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'number', 'clergy', 'church', 'general', 'bears', 'substantial', 'responsibility', 'calamity', 'Not', 'enough', 'Preists', 'spoke', 'out', 'course', 'Vatican', 'was', 'first', 'foreign', 'power', 'sign', 'accord', 'Hitler', 'said', 'did', 'nothing', 'more', 'read', 'Constantine', 'Sword', 'Carrol', 'not', 'movie', 'happy', 'endings', 'Most', 'characters', 'perish', 'many', 'families', 'not', 'one', 'member', 'survived', 'Germany', 'goal', 'making', 'world', 'Jew', 'free', 'movie', 'made', 'excellent', 'point', 'Hitler', 'knew', 'French', 'British', 'would', 'say', 'nothing', 'perscution', 'Jews', 'did', 'not', 'However', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'little', 'reaction', 'got', 'President', 'Roosevelt', 'Germans', 'were', 'right', 'one', 'wanted', 'Jews', 'are', 'still', 'right', 'Today', 'anti-semitism', 'now', 'cloaked', 'political', 'thought', 'anti-Israeli', 'sentiment', 'rational', 'person', 'knowing', 'facts', 'middle', 'east', 'dispute', 'should', 'come', 'down', 'side', 'Israelis', 'know', 'Britain', 'France', 'tend', 'side', 'Arabs', 'dispute', 'Israelis', 'Anti-semitism', 'alive', 'well', 'Europe', 'just', 'wearing', 'different', 'hat.Our', 'DVD', 'set', 'missing', 'beginning', 'footage', 'Apparently', 'DVD', 'set', 'missing', '1/2', 'hour', 'footage', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'sets', 'have', 'footage', 'ours', 'was', 'just', 'defective', 'Still', 'good', 'mini-series', 'holocaust', 'recommend', 'set', 'DVD', 'spent', 'entire', 'afternoon', 'watching', 'whole', 'series', 'one', 'sitting', 'break', 'meal', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'horrible', 'conditions', 'Jews', 'lived', 'time', 'substitute', 'documentaries', 'actual', 'film', 'footage', 'real', 'ghettos', 'camps', 'are', 'teacher', 'using', 'history', 'teaching', 'tool', 'must', 'be', 'supllemented', 'footage', 'real', 'camps', 'ghettos']",Holocaust EP mode  VHS

This 1978 mini-series is in my opinion, one of the best depictions of the Holocaust on screen.The series is set in Germany right about the time Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party are in power [the period covered is about 1935-45]. The series focusses on the trials of the Weiss family, a prominent Jewish family with the patriarch being a decorated war veteran, a grandmother, two sons, Dr Josef Weiss [Fritz Weaver] and his wife Berta [Rosemary Harris], a pharmacist Moses Weiss [Sam Wanamaker], and three grandchildren, an artist Karl [James Woods], a rebel Rudi [Joseph Bottoms], and young Anna.The series begins with the celebration of the marriage between Karl [James Woods] and his Aryan wife Inga [Meryl Streep]. The Weiss portray the assimilated Jewish family, they are not particularly religious yet proud to be Jewish, and are at ease with their Gentile friends. Yet, dark clouds are starting to gather over them and the rest of Germany's Jews as the Nazi party's anti-semitic policies are about to be put into action. It begins with little things like Dr Josef Weiss not being able to treat his Aryan patients anymore and things get worse from that point on. Kristallnacht [Night of the Broken Glass] sees the destruction of Jewish property and businesses and worse is to come.The series tries to portray the gradual persecution of the Jews before the escalation into the horror that became the Shoah. Dr Weiss is deported to Poland, where he ends up with his brother Moses in the Warsaw Ghetto. The other members of the family are also to suffer as Karl the artist is sent off to a concentration camp, leaving his wife Inga desperate to hear news of him. Rudi leaves home to join the partisans, and his mother and sister are left to fend for themselves.There are some truly horrifying scenes in this series and may not be suitable for younger viewers. Mass murder, such as Jews being burned alive, the Babi Yar Massacre in the Ukraine, and of course the gassings are all portrayed with a high degree of realism that makes one flinch and grieve at the same time for all the innocent lives lost.The series not only focusses on the Weiss family, for there is a parallel storyline involving a German named Erik Dorff [Michael Moriarty], an unemployed lawyer who at the behest of his wife decides to join the infamous SS, reporting directly to Reinhard Heydrich[ David Warner], the blond beast who was responsible for implementing many of Hitler's sadistic policies against the Jews. We see how Erik keeps justifying the murder of innocents [""We must keep killing them, don't you see? If we stop it's an admission of guilt!], and how he turns out to be such a cold-blooded human with no feelings whatsoever [a brief attack of conscience is soon forgotten]. This is very reminiscent of many of the high-ranking SS officers in history, as Rudolf Hoss, the Commandant of Auschwitz himself remained unrepentant till the end.I am very glad that this amazing series of such important historic significance is to be finally made available on DVD and i hope that it will portray the series in its entirety with preferably added features such as interviews with the cast etc. A must-have for anyone interested in the Holocaust!UPDATE: The DVD set contains 3 discs, and is NR. It runs approx. 7 hrs and 29 mins.When I compared my much worn out VHS version with the DVD set, I did notice some missing scenes. I'm not sure why this is so. Another customer actually commented that up to an hour of the original show is missing [?]. Once again, I'm not sure as to the justification for this. Also, there are no bonus features which is a disappointment considering this is the 30 year Anniversary edition. It would have been nice to have some interviews with cast members, the director, producer , even a Making Of segment.The quality of the picture transfer is average. However, despite these flaws, and considering the fact that it has taken 3 decades for this epic mini-series to be released on DVD, I would still recommend ""Holocaust"" as a must-watch for those interested in the genre.",5,One of the best depictions of the Holocaust on screen!,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,4251,"['used', 'teach', 'Holocaust', 'history', '8', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'level', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'subject', 'also', 'watched', 'numerous', 'films', 'genre', '1978', 'mini-series', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'depictions', 'Holocaust', 'screen.The', 'series', 'set', 'Germany', 'right', 'time', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'Nazi', 'party', 'are', 'power', 'period', 'covered', '1935-45', ']', 'series', 'trials', 'Weiss', 'family', 'prominent', 'Jewish', 'family', 'patriarch', 'being', 'decorated', 'war', 'veteran', 'grandmother', 'two', 'sons', 'Dr', 'Josef', 'Weiss', '[', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', ']', 'wife', 'Berta', '[', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', ']', 'pharmacist', 'Moses', 'Weiss', '[', 'Sam', 'Wanamaker', ']', 'three', 'grandchildren', 'artist', 'Karl', '[', 'James', 'Woods', ']', 'rebel', 'Rudi', '[', 'Joseph', 'Bottoms', ']', 'young', 'Anna.The', 'series', 'celebration', 'marriage', 'Karl', '[', 'James', 'Woods', ']', 'Aryan', 'wife', 'Inga', '[', 'Meryl', 'Streep', ']', 'Weiss', 'portray', 'assimilated', 'Jewish', 'family', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'religious', 'yet', 'proud', 'be', 'Jewish', 'are', 'ease', 'Gentile', 'friends', 'dark', 'clouds', 'are', 'starting', 'gather', 'rest', 'Germany', 'Jews', 'Nazi', 'party', 'anti-semitic', 'policies', 'are', 'be', 'put', 'action', 'little', 'things', 'Dr', 'Josef', 'Weiss', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'treat', 'Aryan', 'patients', 'anymore', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'point', 'Kristallnacht', '[', 'Night', 'Broken', 'Glass', ']', 'destruction', 'Jewish', 'property', 'businesses', 'worse', 'come.The', 'series', 'tries', 'portray', 'gradual', 'persecution', 'Jews', 'escalation', 'horror', 'became', 'Shoah', 'Dr', 'Weiss', 'deported', 'Poland', 'where', 'up', 'brother', 'Moses', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'are', 'also', 'suffer', 'Karl', 'artist', 'sent', 'off', 'concentration', 'camp', 'leaving', 'wife', 'Inga', 'desperate', 'hear', 'news', 'Rudi', 'home', 'join', 'partisans', 'mother', 'sister', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'are', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'scenes', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Mass', 'murder', 'such', 'Jews', 'being', 'burned', 'alive', 'Babi', 'Yar', 'Massacre', 'Ukraine', 'course', 'gassings', 'are', 'portrayed', 'high', 'degree', 'realism', 'one', 'flinch', 'grieve', 'same', 'time', 'innocent', 'lost.The', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'Weiss', 'family', 'parallel', 'storyline', 'involving', 'German', 'named', 'Erik', 'Dorff', '[', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', ']', 'unemployed', 'lawyer', 'who', 'behest', 'wife', 'join', 'infamous', 'SS', 'reporting', 'directly', 'Reinhard', 'Heydrich', '[', 'David', 'Warner', ']', 'blond', 'beast', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'implementing', 'many', 'Hitler', 'sadistic', 'policies', 'Jews', 'see', 'how', 'Erik', 'justifying', 'murder', 'innocents', '[', 'must', 'keep', 'killing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'stop', 'admission', 'guilt', ']', 'how', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'cold-blooded', 'human', 'feelings', 'whatsoever', '[', 'brief', 'attack', 'conscience', 'soon', 'forgotten', ']', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'many', 'high-ranking', 'SS', 'officers', 'history', 'Rudolf', 'Hoss', 'Commandant', 'Auschwitz', 'remained', 'unrepentant', 'end.I', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'amazing', 'series', 'such', 'important', 'historic', 'significance', 'be', 'finally', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'i', 'hope', 'will', 'portray', 'series', 'entirety', 'preferably', 'added', 'features', 'such', 'interviews', 'cast', 'etc', 'must-have', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Holocaust', 'UPDATE', 'DVD', 'set', '3', 'discs', 'NR', 'approx', '7', 'hrs', '29', 'mins.When', 'compared', 'much', 'worn', 'out', 'VHS', 'version', 'DVD', 'set', 'did', 'notice', 'missing', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'so', 'customer', 'actually', 'commented', 'up', 'hour', 'original', 'show', 'missing', '[', ']', 'Once', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'justification', 'Also', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'disappointment', 'considering', '30', 'year', 'Anniversary', 'edition', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'director', 'producer', 'even', 'Making', 'segment.The', 'quality', 'picture', 'transfer', 'average', 'However', 'flaws', 'considering', 'fact', 'taken', '3', 'decades', 'epic', 'mini-series', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'Holocaust', 'must-watch', 'interested', 'genre']",Holocaust EP mode  VHS
