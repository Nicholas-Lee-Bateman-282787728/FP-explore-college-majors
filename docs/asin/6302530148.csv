ANTIL,"[5, 11]","I watch many foreign films, and have always had trouble getting into the serious dramas, because I have to rely so heavily on the subtitles, which distracts me from immersing myself into the action.  Foreign comedies are  easy to get into.  And, though this does have some humorous bits, it's one  of the few foreign dramas with which I really became engrossed.  I found  myself guessing at every clue of the mystery and calculating every next  step of the action.  It may be bad form to give away clues to great  mysteries, but here's a tidbit to keep you from being frustrated at trying  to guess the mystery; the judge and the transvestite are the same guy.  Almodovar is a great director.  For a lighter fare, with a sadonic bite,  try Almodovar's other masterpieces, TIE ME UP TIE ME DOWN or WOMEN ON THE  VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.",4,An intriguing and riveting film.,955929600,"04 17, 2000",2000,840,"['watch', 'many', 'foreign', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'serious', 'dramas', 'have', 'rely', 'so', 'heavily', 'subtitles', 'immersing', 'action', 'Foreign', 'comedies', 'are', 'easy', 'get', 'have', 'humorous', 'bits', 'one', 'few', 'foreign', 'dramas', 'really', 'became', 'engrossed', 'found', 'guessing', 'clue', 'mystery', 'calculating', 'next', 'step', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'bad', 'form', 'give', 'away', 'clues', 'great', 'mysteries', 'here', 'tidbit', 'keep', 'being', 'frustrated', 'trying', 'guess', 'mystery', 'judge', 'transvestite', 'are', 'same', 'guy', 'Almodovar', 'great', 'director', 'lighter', 'fare', 'sadonic', 'bite', 'try', 'Almodovar', 'other', 'masterpieces', 'TIE', 'ME', 'UP', 'TIE', 'ME', 'DOWN', 'WOMEN', 'ON', 'THE', 'VERGE', 'A', 'NERVOUS', 'BREAKDOWN']",N/A

I thought both of these movies were essentially incredibly sweet despite Tie Me Up being criticized and harshly rated when it first came out.  In both movies, there were still shocking elements to choke on but the essential stories were gentler.  I liked this mother daughter story and even bought Luz Cassal's album and listened to it over and over because the soundtrack for this movie was such a pleasure.  This movie is also a feast of Armani (the mother) and Chanel (the daughter.) I really love the aesthetic of Almodovar's films.  How wonderful Spain must be if these colors and this carefree joyful eye for clothes came from there.  This movie is generally the least appreciated by critics but this is the movie that was the most watchable to me of Almodovar's movies and which I easily enjoyed. I previously liked Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown which was zany and had beautiful colors but I could never rewatch in its entirety.",5,Lethale,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,1141,"['liked', 'movie', 'later', 'catching', 'Victoria', 'Abril', 'Tie', 'Me', 'Up', 'Tie', 'Me', 'Down', 'felt', 'Almodovar', 'had', 'made', 'transition', 'more', 'comprehensible', 'narrative', 'tell', 'softer', 'more', 'complete', 'stories', 'thought', 'movies', 'were', 'essentially', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'Tie', 'Me', 'Up', 'being', 'criticized', 'harshly', 'rated', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'movies', 'were', 'still', 'shocking', 'elements', 'choke', 'essential', 'stories', 'were', 'gentler', 'liked', 'mother', 'daughter', 'story', 'even', 'bought', 'Luz', 'Cassal', 'album', 'listened', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'was', 'such', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'also', 'feast', 'Armani', 'mother', 'Chanel', 'daughter', 'really', 'love', 'aesthetic', 'Almodovar', 'films', 'How', 'wonderful', 'Spain', 'must', 'be', 'colors', 'carefree', 'joyful', 'eye', 'clothes', 'came', 'there', 'movie', 'generally', 'least', 'appreciated', 'critics', 'movie', 'was', 'most', 'watchable', 'Almodovar', 'movies', 'easily', 'enjoyed', 'previously', 'liked', 'Women', 'Verge', 'Nervous', 'Breakdown', 'was', 'zany', 'had', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'could', 'never', 'rewatch', 'entirety']",N/A

On the site, this product shows on top, under the name of the movie and by the Director's name Format: DVD instead of Format: DVD-R as it should be. In the Product's Details it doesn't show that is a DVD-R either. Just on the very bottom under Editorial Reviews a little line and another little DVD-R Note, both almost unnoticeable, that say that it is a DVD-R. I researched and like in the case of the movie ""Amphetamine""; it shows on top, under the name of the movie and by the director's name Format: DVD-R  What's this? Besides being a DVD-R, the quality is poor and it isn't a widescreen version. When I play it, it looks on the screen exactly the same like my VHS version of the movie plays, with a wide black frame around and the small picture on the center that is barely 75% of my TV screen. The screen format info isn't listed in the Product Details either. Besides all I mentioned above, the disc is also terribly scratched, as if it was a very used former rental. When I buy from independent sellers I always go reading the reviews before I buy. Buying from Amazon a ""NEW"" Lionsgate Studio product and being an Almodovar's movie, I couldn't imagine that something could go wrong. Trusting Amazon I just looked at the information on top and the Product Details. Now I feel very angry and disappointed with the purchase, I feel like I have been swindled. I paid $19.98 for a POOR quality and also scratched DVD-R when my VHS version plays the same or maybe better. Lionsgate Studio should definitely replace our product with a good quality one and remove from the market this POOR quality DVD-R. Also Amazon, if they really respect and care for their customers should immediately stop selling this DVD-R or at least update the product's details and give more and visible info and details to give buyers the choice if they want to pay a high price for such a poor quality product or not. Once you buy and open the product there isn't the way to contact Amazon and/or get a refund for your opened item. Amazon doesn't give you the option to File a Claim when you buy from them as they do when you buy from an independent seller. If you buy this product and open it you will be in the same stuation I am now. The Almodovar's movie is a very good movie as always but this DVD-R isn't worthy.

The subject could be really ""noir"", but the way it is treated, it has its black humor side, a specialty of Pedro's. A relationship between a daughter and her mother, choices they made have a profound impact on their lives even decades later. A mysterious procecutor, a fun and strange transvestite, they all have something in common. I feel that one must give the plot away if one starts telling the story, so I won't.

I've been a huge fan of the manufactured-on-demand (MOD) DVDs from Warner Archive, Sony and MGM, wherein we finally get oft-requested movies that might not have huge sales in the long run. The MOD releases have usually been remastered for HD or, at least, were transferred in a 16:9 widescreen format for optimum quality. NOT SO WITH THIS RELEASE!It appears that, while Lionsgate has the rights from Miramax, the only version of the film they have is NOT a 16:9 image. The picture quality appears taken from the VHS mastering done well over ten years ago. The colors bleed and the the image is letterboxed in a 4:3 format, so there goes AV quality out the window.Honestly I was excited for this purchase, since it's one of the last Almodovar movies not available in the US, but this is hardly worth the $19.98 retail price, considering it's lack of quality.",1,1 STAR FOR THE EXECUTION/4 STARS FOR THE FILM,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,946,"['Once', 'heard', 'Lionsgate', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'releasing', 'modern', 'classic', 'was', 'elated', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'manufactured-on-demand', 'MOD', 'DVDs', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Sony', 'MGM', 'wherein', 'finally', 'get', 'oft-requested', 'movies', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'huge', 'sales', 'long', 'run', 'MOD', 'releases', 'have', 'usually', 'been', 'remastered', 'HD', 'least', 'were', 'transferred', '16:9', 'widescreen', 'format', 'optimum', 'quality', 'NOT', 'WITH', 'THIS', 'RELEASE', 'Lionsgate', 'rights', 'Miramax', 'only', 'version', 'film', 'have', 'NOT', '16:9', 'image', 'picture', 'quality', 'taken', 'VHS', 'mastering', 'done', 'well', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'colors', 'bleed', 'image', 'letterboxed', '4:3', 'format', 'there', 'AV', 'quality', 'window.Honestly', 'was', 'excited', 'purchase', 'one', 'last', 'Almodovar', 'movies', 'not', 'available', 'US', 'hardly', 'worth', '19.98', 'retail', 'price', 'considering', 'lack', 'quality']",N/A
