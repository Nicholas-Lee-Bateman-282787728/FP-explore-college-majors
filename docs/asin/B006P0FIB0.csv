Anderson's name isn't exactly synonymous with what one might call ""quality cinema;"" despite the fact that the Resident Evil franchise has gained a cult following, he has never been behind the camera of a movie that I liked. So it was no surprise that his rock 'em, sock 'em 3D update of Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers was not very good; even the Oscar-winning talent of Christoph Waltz could do little to save it. The story, pretty much recycled and beefed up with big action sequences and CGI, is familiar: Brash, young D'artagnan must team up with the titular trio to take down the scheming Cardinal Richelieu, who has disbanded the musketeers. Throw in a big supporting cast that includes Orlando Bloom, Mads Mikkelsen, Milla Jovovich, Juno Temple, Til Schweiger and more, and one would think it had a chance. Unfortunately, Anderson's The Three Musketeers has nothing new to set it apart from the long line of adaptations that preceded it, yet executed what it did have so poorly that it isn't worth watching. In other words, almost any other version is probably better than this one.",1,Three Musketeers,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,1105,"['Paul', 'W.S', 'Anderson', 'name', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'synonymous', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'call', 'quality', 'cinema', 'fact', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'franchise', 'gained', 'cult', 'following', 'never', 'been', 'camera', 'movie', 'liked', 'was', 'surprise', 'rock', 'sock', '3D', 'update', 'Alexandre', 'Dumas', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'Oscar-winning', 'talent', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'could', 'do', 'little', 'save', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'recycled', 'beefed', 'up', 'big', 'action', 'sequences', 'CGI', 'familiar', 'Brash', 'young', ""D'artagnan"", 'must', 'team', 'up', 'titular', 'trio', 'take', 'down', 'scheming', 'Cardinal', 'Richelieu', 'who', 'disbanded', 'musketeers', 'Throw', 'big', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'Til', 'Schweiger', 'more', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'had', 'chance', 'Unfortunately', 'Anderson', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'nothing', 'new', 'set', 'apart', 'long', 'line', 'adaptations', 'preceded', 'yet', 'executed', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'so', 'poorly', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching', 'other', 'words', 'almost', 'other', 'version', 'probably', 'better', 'one']",N/A

1518494,A4VH04TA14CPE,B006P0FIB0,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[4, 7]","I know, this is an easy target. But the weirdest thing is, the hack screenwriters actually read the source material! To wit --- They get a lot of the names right for minor characters, like Jussac;- In the first duel, Rochefort gets distracted from killing d'Artagnan by Milady's arrival;- Porthos really does sponge off women in order to afford the latest fashions;- Aramis really does sarcastically pray for his enemies after killing them (that's actually inTwenty Years After);- Athos really does take Richelieu's written indulgence from Milady by force;-- and so on. And where the movie does depart from thesource material, a lot of its visual invention is actually pretty good. The ""toy army"" visuals in the opening make it clear that we're going to emphasize the fun, adventurous part of the story. And the reinterpretation of the musketeers' appearance is quite clever. Porthos as a shaven-headed, leather-clad tough guy is a good way to make him comprehensible to a modern audience. He's supposed to be imposing and brawny, and these visual cues convey that more clearly than the more historical depiction with long hair and lace doilies. Richelieu's contemptuous flattery of the king is perfect. The king himself becomes an effete teenager desperate for the queen's approval. He was much more cruel in the book, but this is a surprisingly good way to set up his jealousy of Buckingham. And, although d'Artagnan is a smirking, self-absorbed jerk...well, that part is actually kind of accurate.So the film-makers aren't talentless. The problem is that they have no respect for their audience. I know, it's Hollywood and that's hardly surprising, but still, one dares to dream.For example, the film-makers wanted their movie to appeal to pubescent boys. I can just imagine the boardroom meeting: ""All right, people, this brainstorming session will determine our bottom line! If we don't make our target ticket sales, you hack writers are out on the street! Now, what do the little SOBs like nowadays?"" ""Flatulence!"" ""Ninjas!"" ""Explosions!"" ""Hot chicks!"" ""Maybe we can make them fly? They did that inTransformers, and kids love Transformers."" ""What about kung fu? That's what they do in those Japanese cartoons, right? Kids love those!"" ""All right. Flying kung fu ninja chicks OK with everyone?""So, yeah, the good guys and bad guys fly on airships, and they launch explosives at each other, and stuff blows up. Needless to say, this leaves little room for dialogue. In fact, the need for more explosions seems to force the director to cut out parts of the script, so that the remaining dialogue is incomprehensible. So, Milady gets thrown off the port bow, and the bad guys are holding Constance hostage, and then Athos suddenly stops and makes a speech to d'Artagnan about the importance of seizing the day and living in the moment, as opposed to blind loyalty to king and country, whereupon d'Artagnan is motivated to save her. Leaving aside the question of whether this is in character (hint: no), it makes no sense. In this situation, rescuing Constance coincides with the king's interests. And if he meant that her safety is more important than the king's mission, attempting a rescue actually endangers her more. I think that no one read over the script, and this part is only there because that's the part in movies where the aloof guy is supposed to say something to motivate the brash guy.Also, the duel with Jussac is turned into a big kung-fu set-piece in which the musketeers slaughter about a hundred dudes. Contemporary directors have problems with this sort of thing. They mistakenly believe, having played too many bad video games, that fight scenes are more impressive if the heroes are shown single-handedly mowing down dozens of inept, faceless bad guys. In fact, the opposite is true. In the book, this duel takes place between four musketeers and five Cardinal's guards. This number of opponents is sufficient to make the scene immortally gripping, because the guards are part of an elite, some of the best swordsmen in France. A one-on-one duel can be terrifying, as long as the opponent convincingly looks like he knows his way around a deadly weapon. With a horde of opponents, however, there is no chance to demonstrate any actual fencing skill, and the scene is reduced to magical kung-fu decimating incompetent enemies while the camera impotently spins around.There's also some of that jolly old broad humour dealing with d'Artagnan's defecating horse and Planchet's alleged obesity. You know, there is nothing wrong with appealing to pubescent boys. But, during the past 100 years, The Three Musketeers has had no problem appealing to them. The thing is, the novel went for a rise. It appealed to their desire to be smarter, stronger, and more skillful, to their curiosity about the world, and to their fondness for rituals and secrets. The idea of political sophistication was interesting to them. Really, people are capable of more than Hollywood directors think.",2,Need you ask?,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,4997,"['know', 'easy', 'target', 'weirdest', 'thing', 'hack', 'screenwriters', 'actually', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'wit', 'get', 'lot', 'names', 'right', 'minor', 'characters', 'Jussac', 'first', 'duel', 'Rochefort', 'distracted', 'killing', ""d'Artagnan"", 'Milady', 'arrival', 'Porthos', 'really', 'sponge', 'off', 'women', 'order', 'afford', 'latest', 'fashions', 'Aramis', 'really', 'sarcastically', 'pray', 'enemies', 'killing', 'actually', 'inTwenty', 'Years', 'Athos', 'really', 'take', 'Richelieu', 'written', 'indulgence', 'Milady', 'force', 'so', 'where', 'movie', 'depart', 'thesource', 'material', 'lot', 'visual', 'invention', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'toy', 'army', 'visuals', 'opening', 'make', 'clear', ""'re"", 'going', 'emphasize', 'fun', 'adventurous', 'part', 'story', 'reinterpretation', 'musketeers', 'appearance', 'quite', 'clever', 'Porthos', 'shaven-headed', 'leather-clad', 'tough', 'guy', 'good', 'way', 'make', 'comprehensible', 'modern', 'audience', 'supposed', 'be', 'imposing', 'brawny', 'visual', 'cues', 'convey', 'more', 'clearly', 'more', 'historical', 'depiction', 'long', 'hair', 'lace', 'doilies', 'Richelieu', 'contemptuous', 'flattery', 'king', 'perfect', 'king', 'effete', 'teenager', 'desperate', 'queen', 'approval', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'cruel', 'book', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'way', 'set', 'up', 'jealousy', 'Buckingham', ""d'Artagnan"", 'smirking', 'self-absorbed', 'jerk', 'well', 'part', 'actually', 'kind', 'accurate.So', 'film-makers', 'are', ""n't"", 'talentless', 'problem', 'have', 'respect', 'audience', 'know', 'Hollywood', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'still', 'one', 'dream.For', 'example', 'film-makers', 'wanted', 'movie', 'appeal', 'pubescent', 'boys', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'boardroom', 'meeting', 'right', 'people', 'brainstorming', 'session', 'will', 'determine', 'bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'target', 'ticket', 'sales', 'hack', 'writers', 'are', 'out', 'street', 'Now', 'what', 'do', 'little', 'SOBs', 'nowadays', 'Flatulence', 'Ninjas', 'Explosions', 'Hot', 'chicks', 'Maybe', 'can', 'make', 'fly', 'did', 'inTransformers', 'kids', 'love', 'Transformers', 'What', 'kung', 'fu', 'what', 'do', 'Japanese', 'cartoons', 'right', 'Kids', 'love', 'right', 'Flying', 'kung', 'fu', 'ninja', 'chicks', 'OK', 'everyone', 'So', 'yeah', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'fly', 'airships', 'launch', 'explosives', 'other', 'stuff', 'up', 'Needless', 'say', 'little', 'room', 'dialogue', 'fact', 'need', 'more', 'explosions', 'force', 'director', 'cut', 'out', 'parts', 'script', 'remaining', 'dialogue', 'incomprehensible', 'So', 'Milady', 'thrown', 'off', 'port', 'bow', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'holding', 'Constance', 'hostage', 'then', 'Athos', 'suddenly', 'speech', ""d'Artagnan"", 'importance', 'seizing', 'day', 'living', 'moment', 'opposed', 'blind', 'loyalty', 'king', 'country', ""d'Artagnan"", 'motivated', 'save', 'Leaving', 'question', 'character', 'hint', 'sense', 'situation', 'rescuing', 'Constance', 'coincides', 'king', 'interests', 'meant', 'safety', 'more', 'important', 'king', 'mission', 'attempting', 'rescue', 'actually', 'more', 'think', 'one', 'read', 'script', 'part', 'only', 'there', 'part', 'movies', 'where', 'aloof', 'guy', 'supposed', 'say', 'something', 'motivate', 'brash', 'guy.Also', 'duel', 'Jussac', 'turned', 'big', 'kung-fu', 'set-piece', 'musketeers', 'slaughter', 'hundred', 'dudes', 'Contemporary', 'directors', 'have', 'problems', 'sort', 'thing', 'mistakenly', 'believe', 'having', 'played', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'video', 'games', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'impressive', 'heroes', 'are', 'shown', 'single-handedly', 'mowing', 'down', 'dozens', 'inept', 'faceless', 'bad', 'guys', 'fact', 'opposite', 'true', 'book', 'duel', 'place', 'four', 'musketeers', 'five', 'Cardinal', 'guards', 'number', 'opponents', 'sufficient', 'make', 'scene', 'immortally', 'gripping', 'guards', 'are', 'part', 'elite', 'best', 'swordsmen', 'France', 'one-on-one', 'duel', 'can', 'be', 'terrifying', 'as', 'long', 'opponent', 'convincingly', 'way', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'horde', 'opponents', 'however', 'chance', 'demonstrate', 'actual', 'fencing', 'skill', 'scene', 'reduced', 'magical', 'kung-fu', 'decimating', 'incompetent', 'enemies', 'camera', 'impotently', 'also', 'jolly', 'old', 'broad', 'humour', 'dealing', ""d'Artagnan"", 'defecating', 'horse', 'Planchet', 'alleged', 'obesity', 'know', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'appealing', 'pubescent', 'boys', 'past', '100', 'years', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'had', 'problem', 'appealing', 'thing', 'novel', 'went', 'rise', 'appealed', 'desire', 'be', 'smarter', 'stronger', 'more', 'skillful', 'curiosity', 'world', 'fondness', 'rituals', 'secrets', 'idea', 'political', 'sophistication', 'was', 'interesting', 'Really', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'think']",N/A

1518496,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B006P0FIB0,Anthony L.,"[0, 0]","Before watching The Three Musketeers, I asked myself how it could be rated so bad. Sure, critics are never partial to these sorts of movies, but I had hopes that it would be an action-packed, fun, crowd-pleasing adventure with some good acting. After all the cast was amazing. Excluding Logan Lerman, who has all the skill and acting range of a small pebble, the cast had the excellent Matthew Macfayden, the icy-cool Luke Evans, the electrifying Mads Mikkelsen (coolest European actor ever!), the peerless Christoph Waltz, and the flamboyant Orlando Bloom. You couldn't go wrong with that A-list. Or so I told myself, because, evidently, you COULD.So I give you My Reasons Why The Three Musketeers (2011) Sucks:1. The Cast: What -- it's greatest advantage is also it's greatest downfall? Pretty much. Let's start with Logan Lerman, in the most miscast role of all time since Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. Lerman can't act. Sometimes he chooses roles that fit him better (Percy Jackson), but his roles so far are mediocre at best, and this is a phenomenally bad role (I have hope for him, though, in the future). Nobody attempts even the faintest shadow of an accent, French or British, speaking instead in whatever accent they deem easiest. Matthew Macfayden is a phenomenal actor, but he comes off here as just silly, and Ray Stevenson is turned into a stupidly strong fighting machine. Luke Evans is the ONE good thing about this movie, I swear, as he manages to keep his dignity about him AND be cool at the same time. Bloom and Waltz chew up the scenery with their OTT roles, but neither actor is showing off their true range. Mikkelsen is usually the coolest actor onscreen, but is reduced here to a mere caricature. Milla Jovovich becomes a juvenile sex symbol, and Juno Temple is miscast. I could go on and on...2. The screenplay is ABSOLUTELY atrocious: The dialogue is abysmally bad, filled with uber cheesy oneliners and modern slang that sounds absolutely foreign in the mouths of such fine actors (you actually begin to feel sorry for Macfayden). You can have Daniel Day-Lewis and Bobby de Niro in your movies, but if you give them bad lines....they will still sound bad.3. The CGI: this is some of the worst CGI I have ever seen in a mainstream blockbuster. It is painfully obvious and terribly out of place. Be prepared to grimace, groan, and be shocked at just...really poor computer generated imagery. The slo-mo, the airships, the cityscapes...it's all really bad.4. All that steampunk nonsense. Airships, wires that act like lasers, hidden crypts, modern technology, and all that stupid stuff about Da Vinci designing all these fantastical machines....oh, and one more: AIRSHIPS. In the early 1800's. Because that's so stupid we need to say it again.5. Distance yourself in EVERY way possible from the original book. Take the most beloved work of French literature ever (aside from Les Miserables), with peerless action, humour, and characters. Then tear that down piece by piece, substitute with your own terrible plot, and garnish with slapstick. Enjoy.6. Shoot for mediocrity. To this day, there has still never been a film adaptation of Dumas's Three Musketeers that has fully satisified me. The finest one to date is the Michael York 1973 version, starring Oliver Reed, Charlton Heston, Faye Dunaway, and Michael York as D'Artagnan. The 1993 version with Chris O'Donnel, Kiefer Sutherland, and Tim Curry is silly but loads of guilty fun. The Three Musketeers (2011) has no wish to set itself above or apart any from the previous film versions. That's why it sucks.PROS: Luke Evans?...uhh, costumes?....uhh...What more can I say? This is a pretty bad movie, not even worth watching to entertain you for 1 and a half hours. Watch one of the older versions, read the awesome book, but stay away, because this is not worth watching. 2 rapiers out of 5.",2,"Mon Dieu! What sacrilege.

1518507,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B006P0FIB0,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[7, 10]","It always amazes me that Hollywood never gets tired of doing remakes of some of their films, always trying to get it right. In fact, I was recently reading about the obsession of trying to make the best ""Great Gatsby"" version of them all, with new one of them coming out soon.  All these feelings came to mind when watching the newest remake of ""The Three Musketeers."" And let me tell you that I quite enjoyed this movie. It is what we go to the theaters for: it is exciting and fun and I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, as the production is majestic and quite colorful.The story is simple, but you can tell that a lot of thinking and planning went into designing it for the screen. The opening is fascinating, as a voice, using a map with miniatures, tells us that ""It is the dawn of the 17th Century and after the assassination of his father, the young king Louis XIII ascends to the throne."" We are also told that the king (Freddie Fox) is surrounded by enemies, including his advisor, feared Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz), who is developing a plot to overthrow him. Enter Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), who makes an amazing entrance like a ninja; Aramis (Luke Evans), who does the same as sort of Batman; and Porthos (Ray Stevenson), who will remind you of the Joker. And this I say in a good way, as their appearances immediately tell you that this is great casting and that we are in for some fun. We also meet Milady De Winter (Milla Jovovich), a sexy, talented partner, who we will sadly discover is also a double-agent. The four of them team up to steal a blue-print of a DaVinci invention from the DaVinci vault in Venice. They succeed, but Milady fools the musketeers, and we learn that she was working for the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). Enter, then,D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman), who we meet while saying farewell to his parents, because he is leaving for Paris to become a musketeer. As fate has it, he does meet the musketeers, who at this time are down on their luck and fame, or, as Athos says, ""obsolete."" However, a valuable necklace with diamonds is stolen from the queen, and D'Artagnan convince the musketeers to get their act together and get the necklace back, And that is when the adventure begins.It is understandable that some people do not feel right about how the classics are taken to the screen in a certain way, especially if the ambiance or the story doesn't reflect the environment of a given historical period. But modernization brought special effects and other things that make the studios compete to see who outdo each other. And that is what we get with this new, dynamic version of the Dumas' novel. I truly had a great time watching the action sequences and the great production design, which generates a great mix of history, due to its scenarios, and remarkable cinematic techniques. The way the movie ends, opens the possibility of a sequel, which is uncertain, given that the film sadly did not fare well at the box office. However, I hope that they find a way to do it. The DVD includes audio commentaries by cast and crew, making-of documentaries, deleted and extended scenes, and more.

1518509,AB34G6VKP28L,B006P0FIB0,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[4, 8]","Alexandre Dumas' classic story has been told over and over again, but never with quite as much imagination as this. Set in a time of opulence, it features quick-witted assassins, diabolical villains, and flying ships setting sail in stormy skies.Every partnership must eventually end, and it is unfortunate for Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) that it ends with a betrayal by the woman he loves. Lady de Winter (Milla Jovovich) has not only broken his heart but made off with the object of his desire, a set of plans for a flying ship by da Vinci. Her choice to support an English rival Lord Buckingham (Orlando Bloom) over him leaves him devastated. But then, the Musketeers haven't much to do these days, since the youthful and foolish king has no further need of them, and the city of Paris is run by the Cardinal's Guards.Four years later, this does not bode well for young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) when he arrives intent on becoming a Musketeer, with the swordsmanship skills and attitude to prove it. He is not in town for more than an hour before he has collided with Athos, refused to pay a ticket given to him by Aramis (Luke Evans), and insulted Porthos (Ray Stevenson). His intention to fight all three of them in individual duals goes amiss when the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard orders his arrest, leaving the Three Musketeers and their tag-along to stumble into the midst of a diabolical plot intent on catapulting France and England into war. The order of the day is to save the queen, out-maneuver Buckingham, and outsmart the Cardinal (Christoph Waltz)... on the ground, or in the sky.What can I say about this movie? Ten minutes in and I was cringing over how awful it was. Normally, I really like Milla Jovovich, but she is horribly miscast here, lacking any screen presence or chemistry with her costars. Everyone else ranges from decent to mundane, all except for Bloom, who is having such a good time twirling his mustache (sometimes literally) that we cannot help but enjoy his scene-stealing performance. He appears to be fully aware of how absurd the entire thing is, but doesn't mind a bit. Unfortunately, we're expected to root for the budding romance between young DArtagnan and one of the queen's ladies in waiting, but neither of them can act their way out of a paper bag and have zero sexual tension. However, I will say that once you get over the rampant absurdities, this movie does become a lot of fun. Its main flaw is trying too hard and relying on too many gags, but by the midway point I was enjoying myself, and the final twenty minutes are terrific, ranging from the air battle to a swordfight on the roof of Notre Dame.In all other respects, this film is absolutely gorgeous. Shot in real locations rather than sets, it presents us with the finest of French and German architecture, with breathtaking panoramas and exquisite interiors. The costuming is also gorgeous, from ruffled petticoats and underskirts to tailored pantaloons. Now and again a lovely musical score creeps in, and the CGI in the last half is flawless. This film is so stunning on Blu Ray that I'm tempted to forgive its faults for that alone. The cheekiness of this movie is evident from the opening scenes, in which the image freezes and the name of the character is splashed across the frame.

1518510,A304GUEPCPYM3Z,B006P0FIB0,"citan-uzuki ""citan-uzuki""","[2, 2]","The story in this movie was inspired by Dumas' The Three Musketeers.  I say inspired because the story has been changed.  Dumas' characters are there, the period is right, but this is not the same story that Alexandre Dumas wrote.  Don't let that turn you off.  This is a fun movie to watch.  Quite frankly, the original story needed to be modified for the modern audience anyway.The story begins in Venice where we find our Musketeers on a mission to steal Leonardo DaVinci's engineering plans for a flying ship.  Unfortunately, they are not the only ones who are interested in the plans.  The English are also interested in building a fleet of flying ships in order to have the capability to invade their rival nations.  The trio successfully disable the guards and evade the security traps to the vault.  Now in possession of the document, the group then decides to make their escape.  A short time later, Milady DeWinter betrays them and steals the document, delivering it to their English rival, the Duke of Buckingham.Fast forward six months.  Relationship between France and England have deteriorated.  To take advantage of this, Cardinal Richeleu wants to trigger a war between the two nations, hoping to take the throne from the king during the resulting chaos.  DeWinter, who works as a double-agent, steals the Queen's prized necklace and plants false evidence pointing to a romantic relationship between the Queen and Buckingham.  The Cardinal, hoping this would force France's young King Louis XIII into declaring a war with England, manipulates the monarch into testing the Queen's fidelity.  The necklace, a gift from the king, was taken to England by DeWinter.  Richeleu manipulates the king into thinking that the Queen had given the necklace to Buckingham, as a sign of affection.  To test the Queen, King Louis decides to hold a ball.  He then specifically instructs the Queen to wear the necklace to the dance.  Constance, the beautiful lady-in-waiting to the Queen, makes a desperate plea to the young D'Artagnan to recover the necklace in time for the ball.  D'Artagnan and the three musketeers agree to sneak their way into England and steal the necklace from the tower of London.  The date of the ball is only five days away.The Musketeers, now four in number, retrieve the necklace and steals one of Buckingham's flying ships along the way.  The Cardinal, not one to be easily discouraged, sends his henchman, Rochefort, to intercept the musketeers on their way back to France.  With an improved flying boat of his own, Rochefort confronts the musketeers and forces young D'Artagnan to give up the necklace.Logan Lerman heads the all-star cast, playing D'Artagnan.  Milla Jovovich, Mads Mikkelsen, Matthew MacFadyen, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Ray Stevenson, Juno Temple, Freddie Fox, Christoph Waltz, and the very beautiful Gabriella Wilde round out the supporting roles.  I would have to say that all were great in their respective parts.  Particularly Orlando Bloom as the very arrogant Duke of Buckingham.  Gabriella Wilde is just breathtakingly beautiful as Constance, the love interest of D'Artagnan.  Paul W.S. Anderson, Milla's husband, directed the movie.This is a fun movie to watch, blending flashy action and light comedy into a very watchable story.  The terrific cast is what made the movie work.  There are a lot of elements here that have been changed from the original story.  And this is unlike any of the other previous movies made from the source material.  Let's just say this movie was inspired by the original material from Dumas, but has a story all its own.  In other words, the original story has been given the Paul W.S. Anderson treatment.

1518517,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B006P0FIB0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","Since the 1800's, the tale of ""The Three Musketeers"" has entertained generation after generation.Beginning with the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the 17th century tale would feature a young man named d'Artagnan leaving home to join the Musketters of the Guard which consisted of Athos, Porthos and Aramis.And within this last century, there have been musicals, films, games and animated TV series based on the characters featured in the novel.But as the story has been retold countless times, there was no doubt that the story of the Three Musketeers would receive a film adaptation and for filmmaker W.S. Anderson (""Death Race"", ""AVP: Aliens vs. Predator"", ""Resident Evil"" films), in order for the story not too be to banal or boring, and attract a new generation of viewers, it was time to change things up by tweeking the storyline and also modernizing it.And so, screenwriters Alex Litvak (""Predators"") and Andrew Davies (""Bridget Jones's Diary"", ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"") would be responsible in giving audiences a new fresh storyline featuring the Three Musketeers and the characters created by Alexandre Dumas.The 2011 film would feature cinematography by Glen MacPherson (""Rambo"", ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"") and music by Paul Haslinger (""Underworld: Awakening"", ""Death Race 2', ""Crank"").  And while this big budget film would utilize modern technology for CG, Paul W.S. Anderson also wanted realism and that was to create actual sets of the airships, to shoot in Bavaria for its use of French and Italian architecture and also for its talent to undergo swordfighting bootcamp.The film would earn over $135 million in the box office worldwide and now the film will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Summit Entertainment in March 2012.VIDEO:""The Three Musketeers"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and as one would expect for a big budget action film, the film looks absolutely beautiful.  For one, there are a lot of vibrant colors featured in the outdoor scenes, but it's the location of shooting in Bavaria that lends to the film feeling it's 17th Century and most importantly, CG that helps compliment in the recreation of that world.The production and set design, along with costume design is magnificent and on HD, you are able to see the detail of the clothing, to the sparks flying when the metal swords are striking each other and also seeing the clarity and detail of the surroundings of the area. The CG work is quite impressive and for the most part, this is a vibrant and well-detailed film.I didn't notice any edge enhancement, artifacts or banding while watching this film.  Colors are vibrant, black levels are nice and deep and overall, this film looks beautiful on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Three Musketeers"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Espanol Dolby Digital 5.1.As one can expect from an action film, not only do you get immersive sound during the action sequences, the music composed by Paul Haslinger sounds wonderful.  First, the action sequences.  From the clanging of swords, cannon balls being shot from airship to airship, explosions galore and wonderful panning from right to left, left to right.  And while the second half does feature most of that immersive sound during the action sequences, dialogue and music is crystal clear as well.Subtitles are presented in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Three Musketeers"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director and producer Paul W.S. Anderson and two other producers as they dissect the film, why they modernized the film to what they were most impressed by the making of the film, finding the location and the performances by their talent but also what the crew was able to pull off.  Overall, an in-depth and enjoyable audio commentary.Access: Three Musketeers - While watching the film, you can have access to ""making of"" videos, cast and crew info., factoids and also a body count meter.Paul W. S. Anderson's Musketeers - (2:29) Director Anderson talks about modernizing the film, location of where to shoot and more.Orlando Bloom: Takes on the Duke - (1:59) Orlando Bloom and Director Anderson talk about the character of Duke of Buckingham.17th Century Air Travel - (2:20) Director Paul W.S. Anderson talks about modernizing the air ships and having sets built rather than creating it all on CG.Uncovering France in Germany - (2:14) Shooting in Bavaria and why they chose the location.Deleted and Extended Scenes - (14:38) Featuring 12 extended and deleted scenes.EXTRAS:""The Three Musketeers"" come with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Three Musketeers"" have entertained generation after generation for over 150 years.But for those of us who grew up watching ""The Three Musketeers"" in cinema or cartoons, while the swashbuckling swordsman storylines were great decades ago, for this society use to immersive video game playing, big budget special effects and heroes that have a ""cool factor"", bringing ""The Three Musketeers"" to a new generation is rather tricky.Bring in director Paul W.S. Anderson, known for action films such as the ""Resident Evil"" films, ""Death Race"" and ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" and a person who is willing to modernize and give a refreshing perspective to the storyline but also targeting this new generation who may have passed on reading or watching anything that would have to do with ""The Three Musketeers"".And while listening to the audio commentary by Paul W.S. Anderson and him describing a scene which was inspired by the video game ""Assassins Creed II"", I knew immediately that he's going after an audience who loves their popcorn action, an audience who loves special effects and of course, having the beautiful Milla Jovovich in another action role does not hurt at all.But with that being said, Anderson is known for popcorn action films and in no way or form was he going to recreate the films that were made in the past.  This was going to be straight-up action like his previous films and for those who are familiar with his work, you know what you're going to get.First the positives.  What I enjoyed about ""The Three Musketeers"" was the fact that Paul W.S. Anderson wanted to make D'Artagnan as he was in the original book, an older teenager.  I also liked the fact that he shot in Bavaria and instead of sets created or CG buildings, we are seeing the actual architecture of long ago featured in a film.  Granted, to recreate popular buildings in Paris, there was CG used but still, there is no denying that this film looks good, from its design, set design and even the costume design.Another positive is the fact that Anderson wanted to achieve realism by having the talent undergo bootcamp and learn how to use a sword.  This went for several months and it shows in the film.  Another is building sets, especially the airships and then using CG when needed, but not use CG to completely build the airships.  So, that was a positive touch.Also, the characters seem rather fun, especially having Orlando Bloom and Milla Jovovich as the antagonists.  It was great to see everyone also belittle the servant Planchet and if anything, this was a good popcorn action film that delivered in action and special effects.The bad news which may be bad for those familiar with the series is that this is not the same Three Musketeers that many people grew up with.  While the Three Musketeers are featured in the film, this is a story primarily focused on D'Artagnan and some may feel the ego and bravado was a bit too overbearing.Some may also roll their eyes of the modernization of the film.  With people battling with airships, yes...17th century wooden ships that are flying in the sky with blimps using Leonardo da Vinci's blueprints.And last, a storyline that is driven to action scene after action scene while the storyline is there, it's more to boost its action sequences.  Swordfights, airship fights, etc.And for those who want a cinematic experience with strong characters with awesome character development and a deep, intellectual storyline, this film is not it.  Once again, look at Paul W. S. Anderson's oeuvre and you know that he is a director that specializes in action films and he rarely deviates from that.I personally have enjoyed Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" films and I usually know what I'm going to get with his films and with ""The Three Musketeers"", it was what I expected, a popcorn action film set in the 17th century with modernization and plenty of action and I enjoyed it to the point where I hope there is a sequel.  I never came to this film expecting anything deep or cerebral because I was familiar with Anderson's work and in a sense, his storyline does play to a new generation of audiences who enjoy popcorn action films with plenty of special effects and fighting such as ""The Pirates of the Last Caribbean"", ""Resident Evil"", ""Alien vs. Predator"", ""Transformers"", etc.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic.  Colors are vibrant, detail is amazing and the film looks great on Blu-ray and I can say the same about the lossless audio. Great use of panning of audio from the surround channels, plenty of immersive action sequences that fill up the soundscape and dialogue and music is crystal clear.  And also you get plenty of special features, although I tend to not like ""making of"" being offered by watching the movie a second time.  I prefer to have these separated.  But it is subjective and that is my own personal preference.Is it keeper?  One may want to rent it first to see if it's for them, but for those who enjoy Paul W.S. Anderson films or action films in general, it may be an action film they may want to have in their Blu-ray collection.Overall, ""The Three Musketeers"" is an action-packed film that features impressive special effects, wonderful costume set design and a fast-paced storyline.  It's definitely not the same ""Three Musketeers"" that many have grew up with in the past but a modernized, reboot of the characters for a new generation of moviegoers who love popcorn action

1518519,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B006P0FIB0,Einsatz,"[5, 7]","Whenever I watch a ""period"" film that's liberally punctuated with anachronistic elements, I automatically assume the writers are either too lazy or stupid to properly research the period in question (hoping instead that viewers won't notice their mistakes or believe that they are hip and edgy because of them!).I will say this movie was beautiful to look at.  Obviously, a lot of money was spent on sets, locations, and the incredible costumes (the wigs were another matter).  Less money was used on the screenplay and it shows.  As mentioned by others, the story had a tendency to wander from the source material.  When it bothered to adhere to some of the plotline, it came across as Classics Illustrated for those who have no intention of reading Alexandre Dumas' book Les Trois Mousquetaires.  Worse, this new, and supposedly improved, story began as a caper flick, complete with slow motion action sequences (a device I've never understood nor appreciated as it defies the term action).  At least the swordplay was fun.  I won't even go into the balloons or the pirate battle in the sky.  They could be looked upon as either stupendous or just plain stupid.  Really, dirigibles, has someone confused their centuries?As for the actors, with their accents askew, only a handful redeemed themselves, the rest were just an odd assortment of misplaced thespians in search of their character.  The worst of the lot was Christoph Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu.  His performance was flat, every scene in which he appeared he failed to register.  If it wasn't for the red outfit, I wouldn't have known he was there.  Also less than impressive was Mads Mikkelsen as Captain Rochefort.  Where was the menace?  He was supposed to be the chief villain behind the evil Richelieu.  An eye patch does not a villain make.  Another odd choice was Milla Jovoich as Milady de Winter; did no one think to clue her in as to what type of movie she was making?  Yes, standing out is usually a good thing, here, she was just out there.  And then there was Musketeer Junior, Logan Lerman as D'Artagnan with his decidedly American accent.  Hello, where were the French in all of this!?Once it was over, with the obvious threat of a sequel, I was left wondering if I really enjoyed what I just saw or not.  I honestly can't say I hated it, but I also can't say I loved it either.  Which leaves me with the dilemma, to keep or not to keep?  (I bought it used and in pristine condition.  Cheap.)

1518532,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B006P0FIB0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[8, 9]","Six feet under and rotted in the soil, Alexandre Dumas is rolling over furiously. Heck, even the makers of the much reviled THE MUSKETEER are turning over in their graves (never mind that they're probably not even dead yet). THE MUSKETEER was deplored for its shabby updating and lame use of anachronisms and its swapping of classic swordplay for a more Eastern fighting approach. This latest incarnation of Dumas' classic literature comes along and lifts that same ill-advised blueprint but adds a more pronounced Michael Bey sensibility. 2011's THE THREE MUSKETEERS is louder and bigger-budgeted and peppered with even more anachronistic touches, such as that scene in which Aramis meets D'Artagnan for the first time and he issues him a traffic citation. It's a jarring departure, if you're a stickler for faithful adaptations. Me, it depends. I enjoyed Johnny Weismuller's Tarzan films even though his interpretation of Tarzan was a far cry from E.R. Burroughs' vision. But I can't make up my mind whether to rate THE THREE MUSKETEERS 2.5 out of 5 stars, or 3.5. I had fun watching this, but there were things that seriously bugged me.The world ushers in the dawn of the 17th Century, a tumultuous time. After the assassination of his father, young King Louis XIII ascends the throne. But his inexperience and feckless nature allow his chief advisor, the manipulative Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz), to expand his power base on the sly.You may spot traces of Dumas' original narrative, but it's been garishly gussied up and liberties have been taken. Young and brash D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) of Gascony rides to Paris to make his fortune, harboring dreams of becoming a Musketeer. But no sooner does he set foot in Paris than he offends in quick succession three disapproving citizens and makes an appointment with each to settle accounts by way of duel. These three, of course, are Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, the three most notorious in the ranks of the Musketeers. When the sneery Cardinal's guards interfere, D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers quickly join forces and by so doing spark lifelong friendships.But D'Artagnan is still far from realizing his goal. The Musketeers, under Richelieu's calculated ministrations, have fallen on hard times, are rendered obsolete, are reduced to swilling cheap wine and quarreling with the Cardinal's guards. Seeking a righteous cause around which to rally, D'Artagnan and his new friends unearth a dangerous conspiracy spearheaded by Richelieu and the treacherous Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich). This bit of plot territory is familiar enough: the Musketeers must retrieve compromising jewelry and so defend the Queen's honor and prevent a war. Only, in the book, I don't remember a storming of the Tower of London or huge, battling airships or flamethrowers. Or Milady de Winter taking such a physically active role and indulging in bullet time sequences. In that sense, the role perfectly suits Milla Jovovich.So, listen, if you can find it in you to put aside director Paul W.S. Anderson's bastardization of the source material... and I know that's a hard if... then you just may have fun with this latest iteration. We get a hint that this would be a departure when the film opens up with the Three Musketeers conducting a black ops in Venice. Anderson (elsewhere known as Mr. Jovovich) has a knack for staging stunning visual panoramas, even if sometimes plot and narrative are suspect. I like this version of THE THREE MUSKETEERS on several fronts. Most notably and as mentioned, the astonishing visual aesthetics. The film does justice to costumes and sets and location. It captures the grace and opulence of French architecture, never mind that the film was shot in Bavaria. Other than the distracting spoken anachronisms, it's a fun and irreverent take. The film executes a series of dynamic action sequences, with Aramis being played up as the man of the cloth who fights with ninja-like precision. Thankfully, there actually are nice bits of swordplay and enough rousing swashbuckling to recollect THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. The tone of the characters mimics the original, only extremely exaggerated. As ever, the burnt-out Athos (an excellent Matthew Macfadyen) proves to be the most complex and interesting Musketeer. Unlike other adaptations, this film does focus more on Athos and Milady de Winter's history. Milady de Winter belongs in the Femme Fatale Hall of Fame, and, as Athos learns, you roll the dice when you have truck with a temptress whose attributes include a ""gift for corruption and a penchant for betrayal."" There are slow bits to this movie, and eye-rolling bits. And, more often than not, the stabs at humor miss the mark. The anachronistic elements could've been downplayed or just done away with. And I wasn't entirely sold on Jovovich as Milady or Orlando Bloom as the Duke of Buckingham. But it's worth a watch for the visual spectacle and the slick action. But you may wince when you hear a demoted-to-street patrol Aramis handing D'Artagnan a citation and accusing him: ""Your horse took a dump on the street."" You can apply that as a metaphor, if you like.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with director/producer Paul W.S.

It's kind of a newer more refreshing take on the 3 Musketeers, and the action in this one was enjoyable.  Most of the acting overall was pretty good (one of the musketeer guy's performances was so so, but not so much so that it would cause me to mark this movie down any over it).  I was surprised to see an arrogant, flamboyant Orlando Bloom in this movie too...I hadn't even realized he was in this.  Logan Lerman is pretty cool, and Milla Jovovich, Christopher Watlz, and Ray Stevenson are always cool.  I wasn't all that familiar with the actors playing the other 2 musketeers, but admitedly they weren't too bad, spare a slight bit of shortcoming by one of them in the acting department.  There was one scene that seemed like it could have been shot a little better, when Milla was running through a booby trapped hall in the beginning.

The Musketeers successfully pull off a heist they are betrayed by Milady (Milla Jovovich, ""The Resident Evil"" franchise) and the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom ""The Lord of the Rings"" franchise).So as we all know the Musketeers must reband together, they gain the help of D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman, ""Percy Jackson and The Olympians: The Lightning Thief""), go through to the country and France and bring peace. Of course they must also fight in some good fight sequences, have some good banter and keep the pace of the film going along good even though this has all been told, retold and re-retold many times before.At least this one has some flare to it and a good cast, Bloom is the usual cheesy and unsavory villain as The Duke, Jovovich is simply stunning, Lerman makes for a good young hero and the Musketeers are entetaining also. As stated before the action sequences are well done, the action doesn't get anymore overblown than your standard action movie and well its mindless entertainment.

Truncale ""warriorwriter""","[1, 2]","When this movie first came out in theaters I wanted to see it because of the trailers which showed Mill Jovovich sword fighting; however, it did not get great ratings and I decided to wait until the film was out on DVD.  I purchased this film for a bargain price and I viewed it last night.  Though it had its moments, with some great but too short sword scenes, I was a little disappointed.You would think that with stars such as Milla Jovovich (Who I love in the Resident Evil series etc.), Orlando Blood, Logan Lerman and Christophe Walz the movie should have been great.  It shows the importance of having good screen writers and a more compelling story line is to making a movie a success.One of the ways I use to judge a movie and decide whether it is a great, good, fair or bad movie is as follows:  A great movie is the kind I know I will view over and over again and still enjoy it.  A good movie I usually want to see at least twice.  A fair movie is one in which one  time viewing is enough.  A  bad movie rating is one that is  a total waste of  time viewing.In conclusion, this is an okay movie but not in anyway memorable.Rating:  3 Stars.  Joseph J.

For a movie to get 3 stars or more, it has to be at least good enough to keep me watching the whole thing!A tip to film-makers who want their films to be popular: give the ""Good Guys"" some likeable qualities.  Make them human, don't make them utterly invincible, and even give them a few weaknesses.  Most people don't like pompous, invincible, cocky egomaniacs, if they are supposed to identify with them as the Good Guys.  In the ""Three Musketeers"" it seems as though the whole cast is full of arrogant megalomaniacs.  It's just that the 3 ""good"" Musketeers are the smiling, ultra-confident type of egomaniac, while the bad guys are the frowning, evil type.  And then there's the ""boy"" Musketeer, D'Artagnan, who seems to be a cocky teenage superman (extremely unlikeable), and the female lead, named ""Milady,"" is the cocky, back-stabbing, sexy type (also very unlikeable, although she is on the Dark Side).  Then, of course, are various other types of bad guys, the worst being, of course, the Cardinal, who is a hypocritical, religious egomaniac, and the evil Rochefort, who is a nasty egomaniac.  30 minutes into this thing, I realized that I didn't like any of the characters.Then there's the gimmicky, ""gadget"" flavor to the movie, where, for example, a Musketeer dispatches about 5 soldiers with some sort of whirling machine-gun crossbow.  The gimmicky gadgetry seems silly & distracts.But when the Musketeers along with D'Artagnan are surrounded by about 50 soldiers, and then proceed to easily slaughter them (D'Artagnan acrobatically dispatching about 20 himself), I had had enough.  I had to quit watching it.  I was really cheering for the soldiers to get in some good sword licks on some of those cocky jerks.  Maybe even dispatch one, or at least make them sweat.  Nope, all the poor soldiers were bascially cannon-fodder for the Supermen Musketeer Assassins.  Perhaps better actors could have made me care more about their characters.

This is unfortunately another example of a mostly excellent group of actors given really clunky dialogue and inserted into a silly film. Its amazing to remember that the fun story of the Three Musketeers was already written. Its not like they came up with a goofy story and made a bad movie out of it. They just took an exciting story and made a stupid movie out it. I've seen all the actors in this movie before and have enjoyed their work, but they just had nothing to work with here. The only one who I thought did sort of a bad acting job was Logan Lerman as D'Artagnan. I didn't believe him in that part for a second.On the plus side, this is one gorgeous-looking movie. You could pause it at pretty much any point and be looking at a work of art on screen. Great costumes, fantastic sets and scenery, and pretty-nice CG.So, to wrap up: Beautiful-looking movie, good cast, terrible dialogue, silly story, bad to terrible acting, horrible direction. I just bought this at a good price from Amazon and it is the first one ever that I will be immediately selling.

1518561,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B006P0FIB0,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","There have been numerous filmed versions of Alexandre Dumas' swashbuckling tale THE THREE MUSKETEERS over the years, my favorite of which remains that starring Gene Kelly and June Allyson. Some have been good, some have been bad and many have been so-so. But it's been a while since one was made so I guess it was inevitable that we have a new one thus we have this latest version from director Paul W. S. Anderson, the director behind the RESIDENT EVIL series of films as well as 2 ALIEN sequels.Right off the bat we notice a change as the original story has portions tossed aside and new more modern items included. The original 3 Musketeers - Athos (Matthew McFayden), Aramis (Luke Evans) and Porthos (Ray Stevenson) - are aided by Milady de Winter (Milla Javovich) in finding their way into the secret archives of the Vatican in hopes of stealing plans draw by da Vinci for a flying ship. The archives are protected by all sorts of traps that seem more along the lines of things we'd create these days than then. Once they take hold of the plans, they are betrayed by de Winter as she drugs them and hands the plans off to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom).Several years pass and things change. A young man named D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) leaves his family home in the hopes of joining the legendary Musketeers where his father once served. Along the way he has a losing fight with Rochefort (Mads Mikkelson), a high placed official in the government run by Cardinal Richelieu (Christopher Waltz) but is saved by de Winter. When he arrives in Paris the brash youngster soon finds himself involved in not one but three duels with various men he bumps into not realizing that these are the legendary 3 Musketeers.Before they can fight, they are set upon by Richlieu's guard and a sword fight ensues where D'Artagnan proves his mettle with the legends. Upon finishing they are called before the king to be chastised. Except the king rewards them instead while haphazardly telling them to behave. Thus the group of four are united and their loyalty to the crown and not to Richlieu, who hopes to take over control, demonstrated.With the exception of the opening the movie thus far sticks to the original storyline. It continues with a necklace belonging to the Queen in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham but instead of her having gifted it to him here we have de Winter stealing it. That gives us more of an opportunity for Javovich to have a larger role than in the book as well as a chance for her to display the fighting/action techniques she's displayed in other roles, perhaps because he husband is the director. You think?A dance is planned and Richlieu plants in the mind of the King that the Queen could prove her loyalty to him by wearing the necklace since he was the one responsible for de Winter stealing it. With only days to save the Queen the Musketeers are sent forth to retrieve the necklace and save the day. Along the way they come across various plans to stop them as well as numerous steam punk modernistic weaponry, including the flying airships. I have to assume that the makers of this film felt that today's youthful crowd would be hard pressed to accept anything less than a video game mentality when it came to weapons and fighting sequences.All of these minor quibbles aside the film is an enjoyable piece of entertainment. The action sequences are well filmed and the effects are dazzling. The acting is far above what one would expect for something like this and the characters well though out and performed.

This is a prime example! Very little has to do with the actual book. It's not even true to the character's of the book. The Indiana Jones-ish booby traps are ridiculous, that not even a great inventor the caliber of Leonardo DaVinci could have thought up during the period of which the Three Musketeers takes place. Especially since DaVinci himself would never have thought of a need for such a vault. They never go to Italy, they never get kicked out of the Musketeers, (nor has the muketeers been disbanded as in other film adaptations). Constance isn't the Queens Lady-In-waiting either, and she's married. That aside, the entire concept of the movie is crap.Did they write the story first and hire Milla Jovovich second or the other way around. Milady is cunning, but not the limber acrobatic, mission impossible drop from the roof, Resident Evil kick butt villain portrayed here. Orlando Bloom is utterly wasted and looks ridiculous. His hair is an 80's flashback nightmare! I do enjoy Logan Lerman; however he is wrongly cast as D'artagnan. In the novel, his character is almost 20, so his casting was spot on for the age. I had trouble believing him as D'artagnan. He is still young and a relative newcomer; I do not believe that he held his own against much more seasoned actors. I do look forward to watching him grow as an individual and an actor.The flashy style used to capture the kids is out of place. The weapons used by Athos in the beginning you would expect to see in an over-the-top, unrealistic martial arts film. Buckingham's war ""ballons"" is more Avatar, The Last Airbender than 17th century Europe.The only reason I gave it to stars rather than one is because at the very least my kids should enjoy it (hopefully), so my money won't be completely wasted. well, they'll enjoy it until they're mature enough to read the real story (not the kid friendly versions).",2,Three Musketeers In Name Only,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,2027,"['seriously', 'hate', 'when', 'movie', 'writer', 'producer', 'director', 'dumb', 'down', 'classic', 'literature', 'history', 'grab', 'today', 'younger', 'audiences', 'prime', 'example', 'Very', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'book', 'not', 'even', 'true', 'character', 'book', 'Indiana', 'Jones-ish', 'booby', 'traps', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'not', 'even', 'great', 'inventor', 'caliber', 'Leonardo', 'DaVinci', 'could', 'have', 'thought', 'up', 'period', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'place', 'Especially', 'DaVinci', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'thought', 'need', 'vault', 'never', 'go', 'Italy', 'never', 'get', 'kicked', 'Musketeers', 'muketeers', 'been', 'disbanded', 'other', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Constance', ""n't"", 'Queens', 'Lady-In-waiting', 'married', 'aside', 'entire', 'concept', 'movie', 'crap.Did', 'write', 'story', 'first', 'hire', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'second', 'other', 'way', 'Milady', 'cunning', 'not', 'limber', 'acrobatic', 'mission', 'impossible', 'drop', 'roof', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'kick', 'butt', 'villain', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'ridiculous', 'hair', '80', 'flashback', 'nightmare', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'however', 'wrongly', 'cast', ""D'artagnan"", 'novel', 'character', 'almost', '20', 'casting', 'was', 'spot', 'age', 'had', 'trouble', 'believing', ""D'artagnan"", 'still', 'young', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'held', 'own', 'much', 'more', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'do', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'grow', 'individual', 'actor.The', 'flashy', 'style', 'used', 'capture', 'kids', 'place', 'weapons', 'used', 'Athos', 'beginning', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'over-the-top', 'unrealistic', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'Buckingham', 'war', 'ballons', 'more', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', '17th', 'century', 'Europe.The', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'stars', 'rather', 'one', 'very', 'least', 'kids', 'should', 'enjoy', 'hopefully', 'money', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'wasted', 'well', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'mature', 'enough', 'read', 'real', 'story', 'not', 'kid', 'friendly', 'versions']",N/A

This movie was ridiculous, that was really the only word for it. I cannot imagine what the people who put this thing together were thinking. The plot staggers all over the place without any substance. There is no drive to the story, no point to carry the story along. None of the heros made any connection with me, and did not leave me caring what happened to them. My impression of the King of France was to wonder why anyone would bother to fight for him.  The villians were just plain silly.  The Cardinal, supposed to be the main driving mastermind villan of the story, instead comes across as vague, bland and uninteresting.  The Duke of Buckingham was played more like a villain from an old cartoon show. There is a difference between comedy and farce, but you would not be able to tell that from this movie, which was pure farce.The sword fighting and special effects were nice to see, but nothing in the plot made any sense. The number of totally absurd things that happen are endless. You have whole fleets of flying boat/dirigibles, machine guns, flame throwers, intricate ""Temple of Doom"" type traps.Plus a Milady character who is a James Bond/Indiana Jones superspy. She slaughters an entire company of well armed musketeers in one scene, all while garbed in an elaborate French court gown, complete with nine layers of petty coats, and never even musses her hair. She sword fights better than Zorro, evades booby traps better than any cat burglar, again while never getting her wardrobe unsettled. And all of this happening in the 17th century!  And so on and so forth.  I like a good fantasy, but this was utterly ridiculous!It was a relief when this movie came to an end.

Actually, Stevenson plays Porthos, the musketeer who's skill with a sword is matched only by his love of wine and women. The story begins in the early 17th century when French black ops  team consisting of Athos, Porthos, and Arimis break into a super-secret underground vault in Venice to steal Leonardo Davinci's secret plans for giant for schooner shaped dirigibles. The manage to steal the plans only to have Athos girlfriend Milady (played by Milla Jovavich) betray them to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). From there we go to rural France where D'Artagnon, the son of an impoverished former musketeer leaves home to seek fortune and adventure as a swordsman.From that point on it's all fights and chases. It's just like every other Three Musketeer movie except a lot of the action centers on high speed chases and aerial cannon battles between wooden blimp. Also, many of the musketeers have very modern super-abilities.  Portho has the super strength to rip chains out of the wall. Another Musketeer has a steam-punk frogman suit. Another dives off rooftops like Batman. Miady is a super cat burglar with grappling lines hidden in her clothing.The Three Musketeers is basically silly fun. 9 year old boys will love it for the swordfights, blimp chases and explosions. 13 year old boys will like it even more for the exposed cleavage.",3,Three Musketeers with CGI galore,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,1719,"[""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', '1999', 'steam-punk', 'remake', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'interpretation', 'Three', 'Musketeers.The', 'story', 'casts', 'Logan', 'Lerman', ""D'Artagnon"", 'Mathew', 'MacFayden', 'Athos', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'Arimis', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'Roman', 'Legionaire', 'who', 'skill', 'sword', 'matched', 'only', 'love', 'wine', 'women', 'Actually', 'Stevenson', 'Porthos', 'musketeer', 'who', 'skill', 'sword', 'matched', 'only', 'love', 'wine', 'women', 'story', 'early', '17th', 'century', 'when', 'French', 'black', 'ops', 'consisting', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Arimis', 'break', 'super-secret', 'underground', 'vault', 'Venice', 'steal', 'Leonardo', 'Davinci', 'secret', 'plans', 'giant', 'schooner', 'shaped', 'dirigibles', 'manage', 'steal', 'plans', 'only', 'have', 'Athos', 'girlfriend', 'Milady', 'played', 'Milla', 'Jovavich', 'betray', 'Duke', 'Buckingham', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'go', 'rural', 'France', 'where', ""D'Artagnon"", 'son', 'impoverished', 'former', 'musketeer', 'home', 'seek', 'fortune', 'adventure', 'swordsman.From', 'point', 'fights', 'chases', 'just', 'like', 'other', 'Three', 'Musketeer', 'movie', 'lot', 'action', 'centers', 'high', 'speed', 'chases', 'aerial', 'cannon', 'battles', 'wooden', 'blimp', 'Also', 'many', 'musketeers', 'have', 'very', 'modern', 'super-abilities', 'Portho', 'super', 'strength', 'rip', 'chains', 'wall', 'Musketeer', 'steam-punk', 'frogman', 'suit', 'off', 'rooftops', 'Batman', 'Miady', 'super', 'cat', 'burglar', 'grappling', 'lines', 'hidden', 'clothing.The', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'basically', 'silly', 'fun', '9', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'will', 'love', 'swordfights', 'blimp', 'chases', 'explosions', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'will', 'like', 'even', 'more', 'exposed', 'cleavage']",N/A

Unfortunately, I'm still waiting.  This is a comic book-like adaptation which is poorly casted, heavy on computer generated imagery, and without the slightest regard for realism, sophistication, or historical accuracy.

The 70's ones were awesome.  This one is closer to those, imho, and threatened to unseat the original as my favourite, but I don't think it can quite cut it... close, though.* SPOILERS BELOW *I really don't understand why people are complaining that it's an action flick... or super-hero-esque... that's what the Musketeers are! I personally don't care whether or not it remains ""true"" to the original story, whatever, exactly, that might mean.Though the story is a little used because of the previous movies, it feels pretty fresh. But they did actually put some effort into the characters and plot and made them different than in the older movies, but just as good.That they made D'Artagnan younger and gave him an age-related dynamic with the Louis was neat.  That they made him that young also fit with his cockiness much better than the older incarnations in the other movies.  Louis was hysterical, and I'm glad they made him somewhat of a twit. The dialog was witty, funny, and well written (except for one part below). The sword fighting was extremely fun to watch, which is part of why I like the originals so much.That said, there were a couple of things that weren't so great.  I hate that ploy where writers give the main character some witty remark early on in the movie, and have him repeat it at the end... IT'S LAME, and it was lame when it happened in this movie.  It wasn't, however, a deal killer.  Milla Jovavich was disappointing, though, and she's the reason I had to give the movie only 4 stars.  She left the role feeling pretty empty, which is sad. I haven't enjoyed a single movie of hers since  The 5th Element.

(I give kudos to the Queen Anne in this version which was very well acted by Juno Temple).The role of D'Artagnan is played by an actor with a face of an 8-yr old, the body of a scrawny 12-yr old boy, and one you are hard pressed to believe he'd ever had the slightest experience with any girls. While he seems to pull off the action movements smoothly, he is just all around NOT BELIEVABLE in this role and so (I believe) was a poor casting choice for a main character.They (seem) to have spared no expense on the sets and costumes, and the addition of DaVinci's vault and his ""flying war ships"" were brilliant updates to the usual story, but they went a bit too high tech having laser beam security (of all things) in the queen's jewelry vault, and Melady using a small blow of powder from a compact to be able to see the beams.BOTTOM LINE:  It is not without flaws, and in my opinion does not hold a candle to the 1993 version, (starring Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Tim Curry, Oliver Platt, Michael Wincott, and Chris O'Donnell - which is a tough version to beat!) but the sets, the DaVinci updates to the story, and the fight scenes are very enjoyable - (at one point they even slow down the action sequence for you, which I'm sure you'll appreciate) - so it's ABSOLUTELY WORTH VIEWING if you enjoy swashbuckling type movies.

Anderson returns as director and has not lost his 3D touch (currently filming Resident Evil: Retribution 3D, which looks equally great from the 3D trailer as of Jan 2012). How good is the 3D here? Anderson learned his 3D from the Fusion 3D used on Avatar. Any more questions? Exceptional 3D in depth and the occasional pop outs.Moving on to the movie itself, I went in with the expectations that the film would deliver interesting, like-able characters, a decent storyline and plenty of great action. They sort of got the last part right, but the rest is debatable IMO.Characters: The lead hero is portrayed as an arrogant jerk, and the Three Musketeers are directionless, without a goal when the film gets underway. So who do I root for? Milla Jovovich of course. Too bad she didn't have a bigger role. Orlando Bloom appears, but does little more than talk for the few moments he appears.Storyline: The story needs a strong goal right from the start. Without it, the film feels directionless and pointless. Just some clueless characters wandering about waiting for something to do, is how I perceived it. And I wanted to enjoy the film, but by the end, I didn't care how great the 3D was, I couldn't wait to leave the theater. But that's just one opinion. Another viewing might change the bad taste.Action: Good action when it appears. The sword fights are good, but fencing is limited in the amount of jabs and strikes you can do. More creativity is welcome here. The other action scenes, ranging from Milla squeezing through some obstacle courses, to an in air battle of floating ships, are pretty well done and woke me up in the theater, but if you don't care about the characters, it's still hollow action.Visuals: Great scenery and elaborate costumes if you like the style, top notch lighting and cinematography. Solid special effects.If you like Pirate movies, then you may very well enjoy this. The setting is France, with all of the etiquette, pomp and circumstance, frilly wardrobes and prissy attitudes to go with it, notably displayed by the intentionally annoying King.Decent at best.Film: 5/10Story: 4/10Characters: 6/10Action: 8/10Visuals: 8/103D: 9/10 EXCELLENT.Overall: 6/10 (not an average, saved by the 3D and action).

It doesn't hurt that the cast is top notch...all three Musketeers give great portrayals, d'Artagnan becomes charming after the 1st 3rd of his scenes, all the baddies are well-cast (although it appears poor Mads may have had physical problems during the end sequences that they were trying to cover), and even the incidentals, such as d'Artagnan's father, stand out in great performances. Jovovich shines in almost anything she does, and she's excellent here.Constance....we need to drown Constance. The one misstep in casting. It's like trying to watch Keanu Reeves in Shakespeare.The script is where the problems occur. It's not that they took liberties...what they changed all logically makes sense in an alternate tech timeline and are really quite well done if you don't hate the fact that they changed things. It's certainly better than the Disney script. It's not that it's a badly structured script...it's not.No, the problem is that they don't know when it's good to be over the top, and when it's too much. For instance, the first act is fun, but too much, too fast (complete with comic booky Guy Ritchie style introductions)and too Mission Impossible: The Steampunk Years for the majority of the rest of the film. It makes the climax, which should be over the top for this film, a little anti-climatic.But when this film works, it really shines. There are scenes in this film that just play like the scenes you'd remember from your favorite comic books as a kid, with punch and visual flair. There is an undeniable charm to this film that makes me want to own it on Blu and watch it every now again, despite what it does to the source material. (And there'd be a great drinking game trying to find all the nods to all the films made.)

Mostly you get to witness the actors having the time of their lives as all good productions of the story have afforded us in the past all the way back to Gene Kelly and Lana Turner et al.  Orlando Bloom and Milla Jovovitch are the biggest names aboard stateside and both are no strangers to the action film genre.  The old tale has been told in every possible fashion in its many many film incarnations and so Paul W. S. Anderson (known mostly for the Resident Evil franchise) takes it in the pure action and fun direction of the modern cine-plex blockbuster and obviously has a heck of a time doing it.  For a period piece it's fun to see the formula applied to the ultimate buddy pic.  I found the 3D really added to the overall enjoyment of this particular movie when it does not to many others released these days.  Milla Jovovitch is a joy to behold and Orlando acquits himself very well but neither over shadows their fellow actors in this brisk and bawdy boisterous adaptation.  I had fun at the movies again and these days that's as rare as a good story.  The picture and sound are equal to the task on both the Blu-Ray and The Blu-Ray 3D.

Ray Stevenson is a delightful Porthos which we don't get to see enough on the screen. D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) enters town looking for adventure on his odd looking horse named ""Buttercup"" which is not very manly, even in France.D'Artagnan wants to join up with the trio, which due to budget cuts and the control of the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) has been dissolved. Through various circumstances they are joined together and have a new quest. Milla plays a woman who is skilled with the sword. Her slo-mo moves which she perfected in Resident Evil combat are used in this film. Likewise the foursome fight overwhelming odds.Gabriella Wilde, plays Constance, a lady in waiting who has the heart of D'Artagnan. She delivers to them their impossible quest, one with little chance of success, having to fight and elude armies in two countries. A negative aspect of the film is the anachronistic warship which gave the movie an uncomfortable ""Wild Wild West"" feeling, perhaps for the teen appeal. RPG type fighting.

It's too awful to even contemplate in depth, but it's pretty much a travesty. Despite the extremely talented cast, millions spent on special effects, a musical score clearly borrowed from Sherlock Holmes, beautiful costumes , and a well-known director, this version of The Three Musketeers is an epic failure. Logan Lerman is way too young to play D'Artagnan. He looks young, and he acts young. His ""romance"" with Constance is a joke; they are mistmatched beyond anything I've seen recently. Matthew Macfadyen plays Athos admirably, but his constant brooding nature gets tedious after a while, and he has very little else to do. Luke Evans is Aramis, and it would have been an excellent casting choice-if he stayed true to his novel character. Here, I have no idea whatsoever who he is supposed to be. Is he a priest? Does religion matter to him? Ray Stevenson is Porthos and I can't find any fault with his character. He is Porthos to me. Then there's Milla Jovovich as Milady. Cunning, beautiful, dangerous, and apparently a martial arts expert. Her role is so eye-roll inducing, I nearly stopped watching the movie because of her. Mads Mikkelsen as Rochefort is really good, but a bit cartoony. My big gripe is with Christoph Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu. This is a man who is supposed to inspire fear, a manipulative, evil sort of character who here is so utterly confusing and at times even a comic relief. Mind boggling. King Louis is useless here, acting like a spoilt, whiny child who is more concerned about the latest fashion than his own country's affairs. Orlando Bloom is the only one apparently having any fun here as the wicked Duke of Buckingham, but again it leads nowhere.This film is so disjointed and ridiculous I can't even be sure if we, the audience are supposed to take it seriously or what. The steampunk genre gets thrown at us at random and before you know it, you've forgotten what the actual plot of the film is. Oh yes, the perilous affair of the Queen's diamonds that the musketeers have to recover in London within a 5 day time period. Wow, I'm susprised the director even remembered to keep SOMETHING from the novel intact. I could nitpick this thing to death but it's not even worth the effort.

1518620,ARWCFLO1Q0XY9,B006P0FIB0,W. Foley,"[2, 6]","I really enjoy period piece movies and the story of the Three Musketeers. My favorite version being the 1993 telling of the story starring  Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, and Tim Curry. That version had a sense of fun, whimsical adventure which is lacking in this movie. I was very excited to see this movie because the visuals looked stunning and they certainly are. Although the story does deviate from the classic tale by Alexandre Dumas, most filmed version have taken license with the plot, just not to the extent that this current incarnation of the tale does. Having said that, my complaint is not with the story line itself just some of the mechanization of the plot; namely the use of the airship.I understand the need to suspend disbelief in movies such as this but the inclusion of flying airships made it a bit to difficult for me to do that at times. It just seemed so out of place and it had me rolling my eyes at times. I will say that it is very nicely designed and rendered in the film.My other complaint with the movie is the development of the characters. Generally in the telling of the story the main protagonist is Cardinal Richelieu. However, in this version the ""bad guy"" role is spread out among four characters;  Cardinal Richelieu, Captain Rochefort, the Duke of Buckingham and the Countess de Winter. With evil spread across so many characters motivations are a bit diluted. Also, the  Musketeers themselves seem bland and a bit dark and depressing for my tastes.Now for the positives. This movie is a feast for the eyes! The CGI in this movie is stunning and spectacular. The sets and the costumes are great and the movie really transports you to another place and time and I do like that aspect of the movie. Freddie Fox gives a very humorous and over-the-top performance of a spoiled fashion obsessed King Louis XIII. Juno Temple is equally charming and delightful as Queen Anne. The sword fights and the action scenes are also exciting and well filmed.Although the movie is uneven and I had trouble with parts of the film it is not a total loss for me.",3,The bad and the good....,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,2118,"['really', 'enjoy', 'period', 'piece', 'movies', 'story', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'favorite', 'version', 'being', '1993', 'telling', 'story', 'starring', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'version', 'had', 'sense', 'fun', 'whimsical', 'adventure', 'lacking', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'visuals', 'looked', 'stunning', 'certainly', 'are', 'story', 'deviate', 'classic', 'tale', 'Alexandre', 'Dumas', 'most', 'filmed', 'version', 'have', 'taken', 'license', 'plot', 'just', 'not', 'extent', 'current', 'incarnation', 'tale', 'Having', 'said', 'complaint', 'not', 'story', 'line', 'just', 'mechanization', 'plot', 'namely', 'use', 'airship.I', 'understand', 'need', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'movies', 'such', 'inclusion', 'flying', 'airships', 'made', 'bit', 'difficult', 'do', 'times', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'place', 'had', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'times', 'will', 'say', 'very', 'nicely', 'designed', 'rendered', 'film.My', 'other', 'complaint', 'movie', 'development', 'characters', 'Generally', 'telling', 'story', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Cardinal', 'Richelieu', 'However', 'version', 'bad', 'guy', 'role', 'spread', 'out', 'four', 'characters', 'Cardinal', 'Richelieu', 'Captain', 'Rochefort', 'Duke', 'Buckingham', 'Countess', 'Winter', 'evil', 'spread', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'motivations', 'are', 'bit', 'diluted', 'Also', 'Musketeers', 'seem', 'bland', 'bit', 'dark', 'depressing', 'tastes.Now', 'positives', 'movie', 'feast', 'eyes', 'CGI', 'movie', 'stunning', 'spectacular', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'place', 'time', 'do', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Freddie', 'Fox', 'very', 'humorous', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'spoiled', 'fashion', 'obsessed', 'King', 'Louis', 'XIII', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'equally', 'charming', 'delightful', 'Queen', 'Anne', 'sword', 'fights', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'exciting', 'well', 'movie', 'uneven', 'had', 'trouble', 'parts', 'film', 'not', 'total', 'loss']",N/A
