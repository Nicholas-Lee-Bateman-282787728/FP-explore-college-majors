With happens to fall in love with another bunny in one of the episodes which was kinda amusing, but in a way it kinda got annoying. Daisukes dad comes back into the picture and now he begins to open up towards daisuke. The third episode happened to be very good, but now Risa is just starting to get a little annoying. The way she follows Dark around is one thing i can handle, but her being a thief....i don't think so. Let's just leave that job to Dark. Any ways I would recommend this dvd to anyone who owns the previous two because it unfolds another mystery.",5,Things just got more interesting....,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,611,"['dvd', 'begin', 'unfold', 'new', 'mysteries', 'happens', 'fall', 'love', 'bunny', 'one', 'episodes', 'was', 'kinda', 'amusing', 'way', 'got', 'annoying', 'Daisukes', 'dad', 'back', 'picture', 'now', 'open', 'up', 'towards', 'daisuke', 'third', 'episode', 'happened', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'now', 'Risa', 'just', 'starting', 'get', 'little', 'annoying', 'way', 'Dark', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'can', 'handle', 'being', 'thief', '.i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Let', 'just', 'leave', 'job', 'Dark', 'Any', 'ways', 'would', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'anyone', 'who', 'previous', 'two', 'mystery']",N/A

880278,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B0007D4M8G,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","This volume was kinda up and down. I enjoyed the first episode. With becomes infatuated for a bunny at a local pet store. The ordeal leads Daisuke and Riku on a cute adventure. The 2nd episode was pretty bad. Daisuke's Grandfather is given an old violin from a famous musician who has died. Daisuke ends up trapped in the past and learns the origin and evil power of the violin. The 3rd and 4th are pretty good. Satoshi returns to fight dark and Daisuke's father also returns to help after being gone for many years.This volume has it's good and bad points. I had hopes that this series would progress a little more and develop the relationship between Daisuke and the Harada twins. It seems to be adding some filler in to take up time. From what I can gather, I think I like Riku Harada better than her sister, Risa. Daisuke is clearly a blind fool with terrible taste in girls. Anyway, this series still has lots of potential that is left untapped. So far it's just a little above average. But I'm hold out hope, there is a good story in the works.",4,Up and Down,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,1050,"['volume', 'was', 'kinda', 'up', 'down', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'episode', 'becomes', 'infatuated', 'bunny', 'local', 'pet', 'store', 'ordeal', 'Daisuke', 'Riku', 'cute', 'adventure', '2nd', 'episode', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Daisuke', 'Grandfather', 'given', 'old', 'violin', 'famous', 'musician', 'who', 'died', 'Daisuke', 'up', 'trapped', 'past', 'origin', 'evil', 'power', 'violin', '3rd', '4th', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Satoshi', 'fight', 'dark', 'Daisuke', 'father', 'also', 'help', 'being', 'gone', 'many', 'years.This', 'volume', 'good', 'bad', 'points', 'had', 'hopes', 'series', 'would', 'progress', 'little', 'more', 'develop', 'relationship', 'Daisuke', 'Harada', 'be', 'adding', 'filler', 'take', 'up', 'time', 'what', 'can', 'gather', 'think', 'like', 'Riku', 'Harada', 'better', 'sister', 'Risa', 'Daisuke', 'clearly', 'blind', 'fool', 'terrible', 'taste', 'girls', 'Anyway', 'series', 'still', 'lots', 'potential', 'left', 'untapped', 'So', 'far', 'just', 'little', 'above', 'average', ""'m"", 'hold', 'out', 'hope', 'good', 'story', 'works']",N/A
880279,A2T7TZBOTP68C7,B0007D4M8G,"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[5, 5]","DNAngel: Vol. 3: Facets of Darkness contains four episodes and lots of great extras.  In this particular volume, the extras are even better than the episodes.Episode 9 - ""A Little Romance"" - Daisuke is frustrated trying to make With, Dark's rabbit-like familiar, happy.  Before this episode, Daisuke saw With only as a pet.  But Daisuke's grandfather helps him figure out how to treat With.  With fans rejoice!! This episode is so cute!!Episode 10 - ""Portrait of a Musician"" - Daisuke, Grampa, and Risa attend the funeral of a famous violinist.  Grampa has a mysterious connection with the man and his violin.  Things become strange as Daisuke is transported back in time to witness his young grampa and the musician.  Will Daisuke be trapped in another time?Episode 11 - ""The Temple of Neptune"" - Dark sets out to steal The Horn of Neptune.  The police mount a huge operation to capture Dark.  One of them is his arch-rival Satoshi.  Dark's efforts to escape are hampered by Risa, who conviently falls through a trap door.  This is a boring episode.  The coolest part is the underwater Temple of Neptune.  The female mermaid warrior statue is something else.  I just put it on pause and really admired the statue.12. ""With Rutile"" - After twelve years of absentia, Daisuke's father returns.  I was not impressed by how Daisuke's mom was all over the guy after being gone for so long.  Daisuke is not as willing to be so nonchalant about it as his dad.  But why has his dad come back?  And will he stay, or disappear again?There is a great aerial battle between Krad and Dark.The extras are fabulous.  There is the second half of the DNAngel unplugged concert, where the Japanese singer sings another beautiful song.  In another extra, the singer and the Japanese voice actor playing Daisuke have a conversation about the series.  And Daisuke is holding a rabbit that looks just like With!  The rabbit is very sweet.  He washes himself, cuddles, just so adorable.  The funniest extra is the commentary by the American voice actors who play Daisuke's mother and father.  I was rolling on the floor, especially at the end.",3,Great Extras in Volume Three!,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,2120,"['DNAngel', 'Vol', '3', 'Facets', 'Darkness', 'four', 'episodes', 'lots', 'great', 'extras', 'particular', 'volume', 'extras', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'episodes.Episode', '9', 'Little', 'Romance', 'Daisuke', 'frustrated', 'trying', 'make', 'Dark', 'rabbit-like', 'familiar', 'happy', 'episode', 'Daisuke', 'saw', 'only', 'pet', 'Daisuke', 'grandfather', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'treat', 'fans', 'rejoice', 'episode', 'so', 'cute', 'Episode', '10', 'Portrait', 'Musician', 'Daisuke', 'Grampa', 'Risa', 'attend', 'funeral', 'famous', 'violinist', 'Grampa', 'mysterious', 'connection', 'man', 'violin', 'become', 'strange', 'Daisuke', 'transported', 'back', 'time', 'witness', 'young', 'grampa', 'musician', 'Will', 'Daisuke', 'be', 'trapped', 'time', 'Episode', '11', 'Temple', 'Neptune', 'Dark', 'out', 'steal', 'Horn', 'Neptune', 'police', 'mount', 'huge', 'operation', 'capture', 'Dark', 'One', 'arch-rival', 'Satoshi', 'Dark', 'efforts', 'escape', 'are', 'hampered', 'Risa', 'who', 'conviently', 'trap', 'door', 'boring', 'episode', 'coolest', 'part', 'underwater', 'Temple', 'Neptune', 'female', 'mermaid', 'warrior', 'statue', 'something', 'else', 'just', 'put', 'pause', 'really', 'admired', 'statue.12', 'Rutile', 'twelve', 'years', 'absentia', 'Daisuke', 'father', 'returns', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'how', 'Daisuke', 'mom', 'was', 'guy', 'being', 'gone', 'so', 'long', 'Daisuke', 'not', 'willing', 'be', 'so', 'nonchalant', 'dad', 'why', 'dad', 'come', 'back', 'will', 'stay', 'disappear', 'again', 'great', 'aerial', 'battle', 'Krad', 'Dark.The', 'extras', 'are', 'fabulous', 'second', 'half', 'DNAngel', 'unplugged', 'concert', 'where', 'Japanese', 'singer', 'sings', 'beautiful', 'song', 'extra', 'singer', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actor', 'playing', 'Daisuke', 'have', 'conversation', 'series', 'Daisuke', 'holding', 'rabbit', 'just', 'rabbit', 'very', 'sweet', 'cuddles', 'just', 'so', 'adorable', 'funniest', 'extra', 'commentary', 'American', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Daisuke', 'mother', 'father', 'was', 'rolling', 'floor', 'especially', 'end']",N/A
