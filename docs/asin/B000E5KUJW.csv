968475,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000E5KUJW,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 3]","As the Great Gatsby is one of those classics that everyone claims to love but not many are familiar with, this is an interesting updating. Instead of a bootlegger made good, the current Gatsby (or G) is a hip hop mogul who has no problem playing up the gang banger lifestyle, except where the original Jimmy Gatz is a cheap little hood that's trying hard to become an elite socialite, G (or Summer G) is a sensitive mogul - perhaps too sensitive - trapped in the criminal image that made him his fortune). As with the original, the other man is a bully, but Blair Underwood is a much more emotive and desperate bully than the character of the book. THis is mostly because the ""Daisy"" character is much more conflicted than in the source material. Whereas Fitzgerald eventually makes it obvious that she's just as heartless as her rich husband, the director of this piece gives a woman that's a little more conflicted and much more in love with G (Gatsby) than she wants to be.While that makes things more complicated, it also makes things more safe. The fact that everyone is integrity free in this piece comes as a bit of a shock when the original book was a vicious attack on the nouveau rich. This movie plays it more like a romance. Although there are some nice bits in the hiphop and the Hamptons racism (where the white people appreciate rap because they are as far away from the gangsters as they can get.)
