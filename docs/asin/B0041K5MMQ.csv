My biggest complaint is that they only have one video thus far in the series.  Another complaint I have is that you can't play chapters, you have to either play the whole movie or stop it manually @ some point.  Since I am mean and my kids are allowed only 30 minutes - 1 hour (TOPS) of tv/day, it is kind of a pain.  Otherwise, great video.Ps. Our video came w/ an Atlantix movie special feature.  It was pretty dumb - the kids kind of liked the shark and octopus parts but really it was a poorly disguised commercial for that product line",4,If ou have boys they will love it,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,643,"['Entertaining', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'boys', 'loved', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'video', 'thus', 'far', 'series', 'complaint', 'have', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'chapters', 'have', 'play', 'whole', 'movie', 'stop', 'manually', 'point', 'am', 'mean', 'kids', 'are', 'allowed', 'only', '30', 'minutes', '1', 'hour', 'TOPS', 'tv/day', 'kind', 'pain', 'Otherwise', 'great', 'video.Ps', 'video', 'came', 'Atlantix', 'movie', 'special', 'feature', 'was', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'kids', 'kind', 'liked', 'shark', 'octopus', 'parts', 'really', 'was', 'poorly', 'disguised', 'commercial', 'product', 'line']",N/A
1380231,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B0041K5MMQ,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 2]","I am an adult who love science fiction themed animated films and I picked this up on a whim. I own several of the Bionicle movies and while I must say that I do not think this film is as good the style and themes is rather similar. This miniseries is about a future world inhabited by robots, one organization seek to keep the peace and protect the citizens and that is Hero Factory which well build heroes, the main characters are a team of rookie heroes from this organization who is trying to learn the ropes while impressing their older superiors and that the same time put super criminals away.In a way this show reminds me of silver age comics, the villains are all cackling lunatics, the heroes is good, kind and heroic and none ever get seriously hurt and this is both the show's flaw and and it's strength. The action in the show is good and is sure to please a young boy, or perhaps a young girl, I know I would have loved this when I was 12. There is allot of humor in the show and it made me and my hubby laugh. The characters are charming and the animation, while it do repeat a bit at times is good.One thing I did not like about the show is that there is no explanation as to why the villains do what they do, there is never an explanation as to the various criminal robots relationship with Von Nebula the main villain, so in the plot department this miniseries is badly lacking, now if you are buying this for a 10 year old kid then that will probably not matter that much, it will be entertaining enough to see the robots fighting, but for an adult animation lover the lack of a proper plot is disappointing. That is what I liked about the Bionicle movies, they had both action and plot, just because something is meant for children do not mean that plot do not matter.I do not think this will ever gain the kind of popularity that Bionicle has, however all in all it was a entertaining film. I also have to mention that on the DVD there is a neat little bonus feature, a animated short film where a Lego sub marine crew go searching for the lost city of Atlantis, fighting sea monsters as they go, I think this short film was very well done and as it is over 20 minutes long that is a very nice bonus feature which definitely raises the worth of this DVD.In conclusion, this miniseries is mindless, it is colorful computer graphics robots fighting one another and that is about all it is, but the humor and nice character designs raises that would have been rather boring into something rather good, the inclusion of the Atlantis short film on the DVD makes this movie something worth getting, I am glad I picked it up.",4,"Charming characters, good animation but weak plot.",1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,2638,"['am', 'adult', 'who', 'love', 'science', 'fiction', 'themed', 'animated', 'films', 'picked', 'up', 'whim', 'own', 'several', 'Bionicle', 'movies', 'must', 'say', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'style', 'themes', 'rather', 'similar', 'future', 'world', 'inhabited', 'robots', 'one', 'organization', 'seek', 'keep', 'peace', 'protect', 'citizens', 'Hero', 'Factory', 'well', 'build', 'heroes', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'team', 'rookie', 'heroes', 'organization', 'who', 'trying', 'learn', 'ropes', 'impressing', 'older', 'superiors', 'same', 'time', 'put', 'super', 'criminals', 'away.In', 'way', 'show', 'silver', 'age', 'comics', 'villains', 'are', 'cackling', 'lunatics', 'heroes', 'good', 'kind', 'heroic', 'none', 'ever', 'get', 'seriously', 'hurt', 'show', 'flaw', 'strength', 'action', 'show', 'good', 'sure', 'please', 'young', 'boy', 'perhaps', 'young', 'girl', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'when', 'was', '12', 'allot', 'humor', 'show', 'made', 'hubby', 'laugh', 'characters', 'are', 'charming', 'animation', 'do', 'repeat', 'bit', 'times', 'good.One', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'explanation', 'why', 'villains', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'never', 'explanation', 'various', 'criminal', 'robots', 'relationship', 'Von', 'Nebula', 'main', 'villain', 'so', 'plot', 'department', 'miniseries', 'badly', 'lacking', 'now', 'are', 'buying', '10', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'matter', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'see', 'robots', 'fighting', 'adult', 'animation', 'lack', 'proper', 'plot', 'disappointing', 'what', 'liked', 'Bionicle', 'movies', 'had', 'action', 'plot', 'just', 'something', 'meant', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'plot', 'do', 'not', 'matter.I', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'gain', 'kind', 'popularity', 'Bionicle', 'however', 'was', 'entertaining', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'mention', 'DVD', 'neat', 'little', 'bonus', 'feature', 'animated', 'short', 'film', 'where', 'Lego', 'sub', 'marine', 'crew', 'go', 'searching', 'lost', 'city', 'Atlantis', 'fighting', 'sea', 'monsters', 'go', 'think', 'short', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'very', 'nice', 'bonus', 'feature', 'definitely', 'worth', 'DVD.In', 'conclusion', 'miniseries', 'mindless', 'colorful', 'computer', 'graphics', 'robots', 'fighting', 'one', 'humor', 'nice', 'character', 'designs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'boring', 'something', 'rather', 'good', 'inclusion', 'Atlantis', 'short', 'film', 'DVD', 'movie', 'something', 'getting', 'am', 'glad', 'picked', 'up']",N/A
