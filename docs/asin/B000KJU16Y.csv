The series is wonderfully silly escape from reality that takes the viewer into an incredible fantasy reality where children's imaginary friends become very real beings that are seen, heard, and loved by the child's family...that is, until the child grows up and severs their relationship with their imaginary friend as part of the process of growing up.Enter Madam Foster! This delightfully spirited, young-at-heart grandmother decides that she is never too old to have her imaginary friend and continues her relationship wi8th her imaginary friend right on through until she's old and grey. That decision leads this kid-hearted lady to open her home to any and all imaginary friends that have been abandoned by their creaters, and helps them find a new home with a family who's child does not have a friend of their own.Thus, this smash hit cartoon starts its hilarious ride with another young man whom, like Madam Foster, does not want to sever his relationship with his imaginary friend, but is told that his imaginary friend can no longer stay at home with him, his mean older brother, and his hard-working mom. In his search to find a way to keep his imaginary friend, Bloo, in his life, they stumble upon Madam Foster's home and think think that its a great idea that Bloo stays there until Mac can figure things out. The only bad news is that Foster's Home is just that - a foster home where Bloo will be put up for adoption like all the other friends there. That is, until Madam Foster, herself, finds out that Mac possesses the very same love and affection for Bloo that she has for her imaginary friend. So, she makes a special agreement with Mac that stipulates that Mac has to come and visit Bloo every day. As long as he does that, his beloved friend, Bloo, will never be put up for adoption.This series is insanely funny and imaginative - just as the title suggests!The DVD itself arrived in pristine condition and there is absolutely nothing wrong with the product.

I really enjoyed the character commentary on ""Store Wars"" (one of my favorite episodes on FH4IF), but I would have liked to see it on a couple of others as well (like maybe House of Bloos, World Wide Wabbit, Blooo, Berry Scary).  I also liked the promo commercials, but I felt that they needed MORE CHEESE! :) All he says is ""Hi Lady!""...come on! Add more CHEESE in the promos! :)I also thought the Imaginations Run Wild was amusing and entertaining.  No wonder this show is so popular :) They are all a bunch of characters.I thought the ""Gallery of Friends"" feature was useless and boring.  It was more like an encylopedia of friends instead of character sketches etc that I thought it would be.I am looking forward to owning all the seasons as they come out, but hope they will do more with the DVD (like maybe add a quiz in there ""What Imaginary Friend Should You Adopt? or maybe some more Cheese! :) ).  And it would be nice to see a commentary by Craig McCracken or something about his favorite episodes that he worked on.All in all, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends is worth your money because the show makes up for all what could have been on the DVD :) My family and I actually sat threw it all laughing at every single episode there was.Oh and I forgot to mention...the gag reals are hillarious...you know, the ones that get shown with the credits on TV.  That's also a bonus so check those out.

It's the awesome hit Cartoon Network series in a brand-new 2-disc DVD set !Watch the madcap mania in the first thirteen episodes of the TV show including the ""House of Bloo's"" premiere movie.  (Note that these three episodes are in a ""separate"" form; unlike the way Cartoon Network showed the whole movie in its entirety.)  Join the crazy antics led by Blooregard Q. Kazoo (or just plain Bloo) and his other imaginary pals Coco, Wilt, Eduardo, and a whole lot more friends that live in this bigger than life mansion of Madame Foster.  Some of these (mis)adventures include the time Bloo broke the statue of Madame Foster, the episode where he opened a secret door unleashing a swarm of tiny friends, and the one where he tapes some rather embarassing footage of the uptight Mr. Herriman.There are also some great special features on this DVD like a behind-the-scenes interview with creator Craig McCracken (the dude that also brought you ""The Powerpuff Girls"") and staff.  There's even some exculsive promos on this DVD, a list of some of the other imaginary friends with rather detailed descriptions, and - OOH ! - a commentary by Frankie, Mac, and Bloo on the ""Store Wars"" episode.  (Something I didn't expect since ""Cartoon Network Christmas, Volume 3"".)  And another thing, you won't see the end credit animations after each episode because they're all compiled together in the special features under the name ""End Credit Gags"".One more thing: if you see something ""gleam"" on the ""Main Menu"" and/or ""Episode Selection"" screen, you'll know that it's a ""hidden feature"" just waiting to be seen.
