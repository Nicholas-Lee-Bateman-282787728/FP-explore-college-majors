933088,A3UFCUDVASHZFU,B000ATQYQU,A. Hahn,"[4, 10]","'Mysterious Skin' examines child abuse by looking at its aftermath. It tells two stories; one of Neil, who grew up to become a rent-boy, the other of Brian, who believes he was kidnapped by aliens when he was younger. Both were sexually abused by their baseball coach but Brian doesn't really remember it. When he hears about Neil, he feels an instant connection to him and the tow gradually discover the truth of their past.I can't say I really cared about the Brian storyline. Neil's was more interesting, and frankly, more believeable. Neil isn't a really likable character but he is more charasmatic. He is the character who suffers the most after the abuse as he deals with his need for constant sexual expression in the form of degrading prostitution. In the moment when he is raped in the shower and finally breaks down, any slight interest I had in Brian vanished. You can just tell that Neil will have an interesting, and probably traumatic future.This movie was almost impossible to watch in some parts because of its very real portrayel of child abuse. There were some moments when I felt like I was watching a horror movie because of the sense of impending doom I felt. I guess that this is a warning that this movie contains some rough material that will be difficult for any sane viewer to handle.

933090,A928WN8NV03WZ,B000ATQYQU,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[4, 4]","Here is an unusual piece from infamous director Greg Arraki, who is known for such works as Nowhere, Splendor, and the Doom Generation.  This is the adaptation of the novel Mysterious Skin.  It deals with two young boys who are molested by their baseball coach.  They both take radically different paths in life, but both bear the scars of their oredeal.  This is a very deep and emotional work, but definitely not for the squeamish.The film begins with the two characters(Brad and Neil) as children in the same baseball team.  Neil has begun to develop sexually, admitting to finding men attractive and basing his attraction of his single mothers lovers.  The other, Brad, is a shy and nerdy child, whose father wants him to join the baseball team despite his lack of interest.  Neil ends up becoming closer and closer to the coach, already attracted to him, and the coach ends up taking advantage of this and molesting him.  Though Neil in his naivity glorifies this, thinking of it as his first love.  The damage done to him is obvious in the images shown of him interacting with his peers.  Brian on the other hand isn't sure what happened to him.  He has vague memories of baseball practice, rain, a blue light, and being found at home wet with a nosebleed and no memory of what happened.When we cut to the future the two kids have taken radically different paths in life.  Neil has become a rebel and a street hustler in his small town.  He abuses drugs and has unprotected sex with almost anyone he can.  He works as an announcer part time for the baseball field.  His close friends are often concerned about his dangerous lifestyle and nihlistic look at life.  Brian on the other hand is a college student and very straight laced. But he is strangely subdued, nearly asexual, and doesn't appear to have any friends.  He lives with his mother and goes to college.  His father left when he was young and has little to do with him.  He puzzles over his lost memory and nosebleeds, and is eventually convinced he was abducted by aliens.  This isn't done in a comedic fashion as he pursues it with unusual zeal.  Going as far as to contact stangers to compare stories.  Though they take different paths, the damage is obvious, and their worlds start to slowly draw together.This was an unexpected movie for filmaker Greg Arraki.  He is known for his bizarre take on teen sexuality, surrealistic imagery, and fetish for alien abduction.  This is a much more subdued film, abandoning the surrealism and complex dialogue of his normal fare.  It still shows his fascination with alien abduction, but it portrayed in a very innocent fashion.  His interest in teen sexuality is there, but on a serious note.  Showing the damage done to two children and how their lives where changed because of it.  The portrayal is graphic, and will make you uneasy, but it feels less like a fetish of the directory(i.e. Larry Clark), and more an unflinching view of a traumatizing event.  The acting is excellent; Joseph Gordon Levitt makes a suprising turn from the youngest son on Third Rock From the Sun to the sleazy hustler Neil.  His portrayal is very believable, though Neil is cocky and arrogant but has a restless and desperate nature, seemingly scared of downtime and less sure of himself than he acts.  Brian was well played by Brady Corbet.  Playing a young adult that has shut off part of himself.  He pursues his life with a childlike innocence that is at times charming and sad at the same time.  As well as showing the deep torment he doesn't understand when his curiosity drives him to explore his past.This film is well worth watching, but defintely not for squeamish.  From the uncomfortable scenes of Neil and his coach, to the damaged to the damaged youths they both become.  But beyond it is a quite remarkable movie worth watching for many reasons.",4,Excellent if disturbing story,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,3853,"['Here', 'unusual', 'piece', 'infamous', 'director', 'Greg', 'Arraki', 'who', 'known', 'such', 'works', 'Nowhere', 'Splendor', 'Doom', 'Generation', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'molested', 'baseball', 'coach', 'take', 'radically', 'different', 'paths', 'life', 'bear', 'scars', 'oredeal', 'very', 'deep', 'emotional', 'work', 'definitely', 'not', 'squeamish.The', 'film', 'two', 'characters', 'Brad', 'Neil', 'children', 'same', 'baseball', 'team', 'Neil', 'begun', 'develop', 'sexually', 'admitting', 'finding', 'men', 'attractive', 'basing', 'attraction', 'single', 'mothers', 'lovers', 'other', 'Brad', 'shy', 'nerdy', 'child', 'father', 'join', 'baseball', 'team', 'lack', 'interest', 'Neil', 'up', 'becoming', 'closer', 'closer', 'coach', 'already', 'attracted', 'coach', 'up', 'taking', 'advantage', 'molesting', 'Neil', 'naivity', 'glorifies', 'thinking', 'first', 'love', 'damage', 'done', 'obvious', 'images', 'shown', 'interacting', 'peers', 'Brian', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'vague', 'memories', 'baseball', 'practice', 'rain', 'blue', 'light', 'being', 'found', 'home', 'wet', 'nosebleed', 'memory', 'what', 'happened.When', 'cut', 'future', 'two', 'kids', 'have', 'taken', 'radically', 'different', 'paths', 'life', 'Neil', 'become', 'rebel', 'street', 'hustler', 'small', 'town', 'drugs', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'almost', 'anyone', 'can', 'announcer', 'part', 'time', 'baseball', 'field', 'close', 'friends', 'are', 'often', 'concerned', 'dangerous', 'lifestyle', 'nihlistic', 'look', 'life', 'Brian', 'other', 'hand', 'college', 'student', 'very', 'straight', 'laced', 'strangely', 'subdued', 'nearly', 'asexual', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'friends', 'mother', 'college', 'father', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'little', 'do', 'lost', 'memory', 'nosebleeds', 'eventually', 'convinced', 'was', 'abducted', 'aliens', ""n't"", 'done', 'comedic', 'fashion', 'unusual', 'zeal', 'Going', 'as', 'far', 'contact', 'stangers', 'compare', 'stories', 'take', 'different', 'paths', 'damage', 'obvious', 'worlds', 'start', 'slowly', 'draw', 'together.This', 'was', 'unexpected', 'movie', 'filmaker', 'Greg', 'Arraki', 'known', 'bizarre', 'take', 'teen', 'sexuality', 'surrealistic', 'imagery', 'fetish', 'alien', 'abduction', 'much', 'more', 'subdued', 'film', 'abandoning', 'surrealism', 'complex', 'dialogue', 'normal', 'fare', 'still', 'fascination', 'alien', 'abduction', 'portrayed', 'very', 'innocent', 'fashion', 'interest', 'teen', 'sexuality', 'there', 'serious', 'note', 'Showing', 'damage', 'done', 'two', 'children', 'how', 'lives', 'where', 'changed', 'portrayal', 'graphic', 'will', 'make', 'uneasy', 'less', 'fetish', 'directory', 'i.e', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'more', 'unflinching', 'view', 'traumatizing', 'event', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'suprising', 'turn', 'youngest', 'son', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'sleazy', 'hustler', 'Neil', 'portrayal', 'very', 'believable', 'Neil', 'cocky', 'arrogant', 'restless', 'desperate', 'nature', 'seemingly', 'scared', 'downtime', 'less', 'sure', 'Brian', 'was', 'well', 'played', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'Playing', 'young', 'adult', 'shut', 'off', 'part', 'life', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'times', 'charming', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'As', 'well', 'showing', 'deep', 'torment', ""n't"", 'understand', 'when', 'curiosity', 'explore', 'past.This', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'defintely', 'not', 'squeamish', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'Neil', 'coach', 'damaged', 'damaged', 'youths', 'become', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'many', 'reasons']",Mysterious Skin
933091,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B000ATQYQU,Amy Lynn,"[11, 12]","Plot: The movie centers around 2 boys- Neil and Brian. Age 8. They both play on the same baseball team. They both go through the same abuse from their coach. The movie then forwards to when the boys are about 18 or 19 and one of them cannot seem to remember what exactly happened to him.Neil is now a [..] charismatic teenage hustler and Brian is a nervous introvert obsessed with the idea he was abducted by aliens. Both boys were abused by the baseball coach but Brian instead thinks this trauma he remembered experiencing had to do with being abducted by aliens. All Brian can remember is having a bloody nose and finding himself somewhere else. At first he only remembers bits and pieces of the trauma.. Though he does happen to remember Neil and thinks he was also involved in this 'abduction' as he puts together the bits and pieces of what happened. He eventually ends up tracking Neil down and they both end up confronting the pain of what happened to them.The ending is very heartbreaking and somewhat disturbing. This film is not just for shock value, it has a deeper meaning and is an eye opening look at child sexual abuse.The movie was very fresh, moving and contemplative.  The only uncomfortable parts of the movie to watch were the baseball coach and his intentions with the kids. Also a scene in a hotel room where Neil gets brutalized by one of his johns. Other than that it was a very well done independent film.",4,Disturbing and Beautiful,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,1431,"['Plot', 'movie', 'centers', '2', 'boys-', 'Neil', 'Brian', 'Age', '8', 'play', 'same', 'baseball', 'team', 'go', 'same', 'abuse', 'coach', 'movie', 'then', 'forwards', 'when', 'boys', 'are', '18', '19', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'remember', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'him.Neil', 'now', '[', '..', ']', 'charismatic', 'teenage', 'hustler', 'Brian', 'nervous', 'introvert', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'was', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'boys', 'were', 'abused', 'baseball', 'coach', 'Brian', 'instead', 'trauma', 'remembered', 'experiencing', 'had', 'do', 'being', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'Brian', 'can', 'remember', 'having', 'bloody', 'nose', 'finding', 'somewhere', 'else', 'first', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'trauma..', 'happen', 'remember', 'Neil', 'was', 'also', 'involved', ""'abduction"", 'together', 'bits', 'pieces', 'what', 'happened', 'eventually', 'up', 'tracking', 'Neil', 'down', 'end', 'up', 'confronting', 'pain', 'what', 'happened', 'them.The', 'ending', 'very', 'heartbreaking', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'shock', 'value', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'eye', 'opening', 'look', 'child', 'sexual', 'abuse.The', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'fresh', 'moving', 'contemplative', 'only', 'uncomfortable', 'parts', 'movie', 'watch', 'were', 'baseball', 'coach', 'intentions', 'kids', 'Also', 'scene', 'hotel', 'room', 'where', 'Neil', 'brutalized', 'one', 'johns', 'Other', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'independent', 'film']",Mysterious Skin
933092,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000ATQYQU,Andrew Ellington,"[26, 31]","That's a pretty big statement coming from me, but there is just something about this subject that turns my stomach in a million different directions, and the way it is depicted on screen is far more graphic than I anticipated.The film revolves around two boys, Neil and Brian, who happen to both experience abuse at the hands of their soft-ball coach.  Both boys are traumatized, but in drastically different ways.  As we are introduced to them on the outset of the film through voiceover, we realize that Brian doesn't remember the attack at all and comes to believe that he was actually abducted by aliens.  Neil, on the other hand, remembers almost too well.  While it is apparent that it has altered his life in disturbing ways, he holds that `summer' in high esteem as a big part of his life.  He felt loved and important and special.My stomach was turning.As the boys grow up they struggle to make much sense of their life.  Brian is haunted by nightmares that scare him, causing him to keep a dream diary that he only shares with another young woman who claims to have been abducted too.  Neil turns tricks, sleeping with every man who will look at him twice, sabotaging his own growth by his careless actions.  Brian's search for the truth about his childhood eventually brings the two boys together, and gives them both the opportunity to heal; sort of.I have a few technical issues with the film.  For one, every adult in this film is a mere stereotype, and the acting on the part of those adult actors (aside from Elisabeth Shue, who manages to keep some dignity) causes these characters to come off like caricatures.  The coach, Brian's mother, Brian's father...and then you have some of the younger characters like Eric and Avalyn who also come off as stereotypical props.  Still, my biggest complaint is the blunt way in which the abuse is depicted.  I just have a very hard time considering this entertainment.  Now, before you jump on a high horse, understand that this is my personal opinion.  I have watched quite a few films dealing with controversial subjects and found them breathtaking in their gritty sense of realism and consider them masterpieces.  There just has to be SOME line, right?  I am very happy to read that the scenes were shot in such a way that the child actors didn't know what was going on (and with that being the case, those two young boys turned in BRILLIANT performances) but when you watch the film it almost seems far too realistic.  When it comes to subjects like child abuse, subtlety is far better in my opinion.There is nothing subtle about `Mysterious Skin', unless you are talking about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's masterclass performance.So, with all my issues here, I must say that Gordon-Levitt is brilliant here.  He understands the complexities of his character and he balances them out effortlessly.  You see the guarded insecurity that laces his outlandish and childish behavior.  The way he slinks around, his limbs almost moving in any given direction, give off an air of carelessness that is so layered and so detailed.  His defenses begin to crumble as he begins to realize that everything he thought lifted him up eventually brought him to his knees.He hates himself.I could never see this movie again, and I have a hard time even recommending it, despite Gordon-Levitt's OSCAR worthy performance.  This is just such a hard film to watch, and I have such an issue with the depictions of abuse.  It's odd because I was having a discussion with some friends the other day about films and artistic liberties and one friend asked if any film had ever gone `too far'?  I said no, because art is art and it serves a purpose.  Even if it is hard to stomach, it doesn't mean that it is `too far'.  That was before I saw this.  While I can't say that this film serves no purpose, I can say that this film went `too far' for me.",3,One of the most uncomfortable films I've ever seen...,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,3877,"['pretty', 'big', 'statement', 'coming', 'just', 'something', 'subject', 'stomach', 'million', 'different', 'directions', 'way', 'depicted', 'screen', 'far', 'more', 'graphic', 'anticipated.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'two', 'boys', 'Neil', 'Brian', 'who', 'happen', 'experience', 'abuse', 'hands', 'soft-ball', 'coach', 'boys', 'are', 'traumatized', 'drastically', 'different', 'ways', 'are', 'introduced', 'outset', 'film', 'voiceover', 'realize', 'Brian', ""n't"", 'remember', 'attack', 'believe', 'was', 'actually', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'Neil', 'other', 'hand', 'remembers', 'almost', 'too', 'well', 'apparent', 'altered', 'life', 'disturbing', 'ways', 'summer', 'high', 'esteem', 'big', 'part', 'life', 'felt', 'loved', 'important', 'special.My', 'stomach', 'was', 'boys', 'grow', 'struggle', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'life', 'Brian', 'haunted', 'nightmares', 'scare', 'causing', 'keep', 'dream', 'diary', 'only', 'shares', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'abducted', 'too', 'Neil', 'tricks', 'sleeping', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'look', 'twice', 'sabotaging', 'own', 'growth', 'careless', 'actions', 'Brian', 'search', 'truth', 'childhood', 'eventually', 'two', 'boys', 'together', 'opportunity', 'heal', 'sort', 'of.I', 'have', 'few', 'technical', 'issues', 'film', 'one', 'adult', 'film', 'mere', 'stereotype', 'acting', 'part', 'adult', 'actors', 'aside', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'who', 'keep', 'dignity', 'characters', 'come', 'off', 'caricatures', 'coach', 'Brian', 'mother', 'Brian', 'father', 'then', 'have', 'younger', 'characters', 'Eric', 'Avalyn', 'who', 'also', 'come', 'off', 'stereotypical', 'props', 'Still', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'blunt', 'way', 'abuse', 'depicted', 'just', 'have', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'considering', 'entertainment', 'Now', 'jump', 'high', 'horse', 'understand', 'personal', 'opinion', 'have', 'watched', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'dealing', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'found', 'breathtaking', 'gritty', 'sense', 'realism', 'consider', 'masterpieces', 'just', 'be', 'SOME', 'line', 'right', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'read', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'such', 'way', 'child', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'being', 'case', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'turned', 'BRILLIANT', 'performances', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'almost', 'far', 'too', 'realistic', 'When', 'subjects', 'child', 'abuse', 'subtlety', 'far', 'better', 'nothing', 'subtle', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'are', 'talking', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'masterclass', 'performance.So', 'issues', 'here', 'must', 'say', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'brilliant', 'here', 'complexities', 'character', 'out', 'effortlessly', 'see', 'guarded', 'insecurity', 'outlandish', 'childish', 'behavior', 'way', 'around', 'limbs', 'almost', 'moving', 'given', 'direction', 'give', 'off', 'air', 'carelessness', 'so', 'layered', 'so', 'detailed', 'defenses', 'begin', 'crumble', 'realize', 'everything', 'thought', 'lifted', 'up', 'eventually', 'brought', 'knees.He', 'hates', 'himself.I', 'could', 'never', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'even', 'recommending', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'OSCAR', 'worthy', 'performance', 'just', 'such', 'hard', 'film', 'watch', 'have', 'issue', 'depictions', 'abuse', 'odd', 'was', 'having', 'discussion', 'friends', 'other', 'day', 'films', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'one', 'friend', 'asked', 'film', 'had', 'ever', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'said', 'art', 'art', 'purpose', 'Even', 'hard', 'stomach', ""n't"", 'mean', 'too', 'far', 'was', 'saw', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'purpose', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'went', 'too', 'far']",Mysterious Skin

933095,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B000ATQYQU,Arcadio Bolaos,"[6, 6]","It all starts and ends with a little league's pedophile coach and two kids: Neil and Brian, who unbeknownst to their parents are the victims of a sexual predator. But what is the authentic aftermath of this encounter between the man and the 8-year-old children? The repercussions of sexual abuse will affect greatly the lives of Neil and Brian, but in so many different ways that one could almost wonder if they shared the same experience. As a matter of fact, being sexually abused is such a traumatic event for Brian that he blocks it out of his mind unable to cope with the real, and he then proceeds to fill in the memory gaps with a fantasy of alien abduction. Recurring to such self-defense mechanisms is quite a normal psychological strategy, but it also mingles well with a recurring theme in Araki's cinematography.Neil, on the other hand, fills in the gashing void with an idealized image of the pedophile. After all, during an entire summer the two of them spend many nights together. Neil actually functions as an accomplice, helping the coach to lure in unsuspecting boys, thus creating a perverse bond between them. Perhaps one of the greatest accomplishes of Scott Heim's novelMysterious Skinis to invert the roles, creating a pedophile that seems to be nicer and more caring than the boys' parents, while at the same time embedding at least one of the victims with an attitude that one would find difficult to sympathize with. Araki's film, of course, thrives because of that: the complexity between the characters relationships. This is not, after all, a lesson of morality. Here the coach leaves the town, with an untarnished reputation, and leaves behind Neil, a very obsessed boy who admits later that ""it's a huge part of me. No one ever made me feel that way before or since [...] I was his one true love"".Perversion seems to be the one predominant constant throughout Neil's life, but as Lacan would define it, a perverse individual is the one who assumes the position of the object-instrument of the ""will-to-enjoy"" (volont&eacute;-de-jouissance), which is not his own will but that of the big Other. In this case, Neil accepts to serve as a garish tool of pleasure for the coach, and years later, as a teenage hustler, he has no quandaries when it is his turn to be the instrument of joy of the other (namely his clients). Emotionally detached from everyone, only a girl, a friend from childhood, remains as his one and true humane anchor. His mother, after all, has always been a carefree woman, constantly hooking up with men, and paying no attention to his son; that's why when Neil is about to depart to New York, she looks at him and utters ""my baby, all grown up"", not as a typical motherly affirmation but rather a discovery: time flew by, and she wasn't there at all.Brian's dreams are a reminder that another boy was with him the night of the alien abduction, consequently the insecure boy starts the search for Neil, and learns of his whereabouts just after Neil has left for the big city. It is then that Neil's friend, Eric, a very flamboyant gay kid, befriends him. Brian is quite a timid and introversive teenager, perhaps as a result of having a very dominant mother and an absent father (even before he abandons the family, he was only there to state how disappointed he was at his son). Eric describes him as ""weirdly asexual"" (even without knowing how Brian had violently rejected a UFO obsessed woman that intended to caress his penis); indeed, Brian is unable to reclaim sexuality for himself, and after having always lived in a world of his own he finds in Eric's friendship everything he needs to break out of his shelf.As a male prostitute, Neil finds the horror of the real in New York, and he will soon realize how dangerous his line of business can get. Back in town, Eric is preparing himself to let go of the one reality that has sustained and nurtured his psyche, but can he embrace the real if Neil tells him exactly what happened that fatidic night? Araki brilliantly depicts this honest, heart-wrenching and unruly story, taking advantage of the exceptional acting qualities of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Neil), a daring and talented actor that has worked in many interesting independent films, such as Brick, The Lookout or Latter Days (a gay themed movie). This actor finds in Brady Corbet (Brian) the ideal partner; Corbet creates a subtle but fascinating character, completely different from his roles inFunny GamesorThirteen, proving not only that he is a great actor but that he also knows how to choose the best directors to work with.",5,Coping with sexual abuse: Perversion versus Fantasy,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,4594,"['starts', 'little', 'league', 'pedophile', 'coach', 'two', 'kids', 'Neil', 'Brian', 'who', 'unbeknownst', 'parents', 'are', 'victims', 'sexual', 'predator', 'what', 'authentic', 'aftermath', 'encounter', 'man', '8-year-old', 'children', 'repercussions', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'will', 'affect', 'greatly', 'lives', 'Neil', 'Brian', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'one', 'could', 'almost', 'wonder', 'shared', 'same', 'experience', 'matter', 'fact', 'being', 'sexually', 'abused', 'such', 'traumatic', 'event', 'Brian', 'mind', 'unable', 'cope', 'real', 'then', 'fill', 'memory', 'gaps', 'fantasy', 'alien', 'abduction', 'Recurring', 'such', 'self-defense', 'mechanisms', 'quite', 'normal', 'psychological', 'strategy', 'also', 'well', 'recurring', 'theme', 'Araki', 'cinematography.Neil', 'other', 'hand', 'fills', 'gashing', 'void', 'idealized', 'image', 'pedophile', 'entire', 'summer', 'two', 'spend', 'many', 'nights', 'together', 'Neil', 'actually', 'accomplice', 'helping', 'coach', 'lure', 'unsuspecting', 'boys', 'thus', 'creating', 'perverse', 'bond', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'greatest', 'accomplishes', 'Scott', 'Heim', 'novelMysterious', 'Skinis', 'invert', 'roles', 'creating', 'pedophile', 'be', 'nicer', 'more', 'caring', 'boys', 'parents', 'same', 'time', 'embedding', 'least', 'one', 'victims', 'attitude', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'difficult', 'sympathize', 'Araki', 'film', 'course', 'complexity', 'characters', 'relationships', 'not', 'lesson', 'morality', 'Here', 'coach', 'town', 'untarnished', 'reputation', 'Neil', 'very', 'obsessed', 'boy', 'who', 'later', 'huge', 'part', 'one', 'ever', 'made', 'feel', 'way', '[', ']', 'was', 'one', 'true', 'love', '.Perversion', 'be', 'one', 'predominant', 'constant', 'Neil', 'life', 'Lacan', 'would', 'define', 'perverse', 'individual', 'one', 'who', 'position', 'object-instrument', 'will-to-enjoy', 'volont', 'eacute', '-de-jouissance', 'not', 'own', 'will', 'big', 'Other', 'case', 'Neil', 'serve', 'garish', 'tool', 'pleasure', 'coach', 'years', 'later', 'teenage', 'hustler', 'quandaries', 'when', 'turn', 'be', 'instrument', 'joy', 'other', 'namely', 'clients', 'Emotionally', 'detached', 'everyone', 'only', 'girl', 'friend', 'childhood', 'one', 'true', 'humane', 'anchor', 'mother', 'always', 'been', 'carefree', 'woman', 'constantly', 'hooking', 'up', 'men', 'paying', 'attention', 'son', 'why', 'when', 'Neil', 'depart', 'New', 'York', 'utters', 'baby', 'grown', 'up', 'not', 'typical', 'motherly', 'affirmation', 'rather', 'discovery', 'time', 'flew', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'all.Brian', 'dreams', 'are', 'reminder', 'boy', 'was', 'night', 'alien', 'abduction', 'consequently', 'insecure', 'boy', 'search', 'Neil', 'learns', 'whereabouts', 'just', 'Neil', 'left', 'big', 'city', 'then', 'Neil', 'friend', 'Eric', 'very', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'kid', 'Brian', 'quite', 'timid', 'introversive', 'teenager', 'perhaps', 'result', 'having', 'very', 'dominant', 'mother', 'absent', 'father', 'even', 'family', 'was', 'only', 'there', 'state', 'how', 'disappointed', 'was', 'son', 'Eric', 'weirdly', 'asexual', 'even', 'knowing', 'how', 'Brian', 'had', 'violently', 'rejected', 'UFO', 'obsessed', 'woman', 'intended', 'caress', 'penis', 'indeed', 'Brian', 'unable', 'reclaim', 'sexuality', 'having', 'always', 'lived', 'world', 'own', 'Eric', 'friendship', 'everything', 'break', 'shelf.As', 'male', 'prostitute', 'Neil', 'horror', 'real', 'New', 'York', 'will', 'soon', 'realize', 'how', 'dangerous', 'line', 'business', 'can', 'get', 'Back', 'town', 'Eric', 'preparing', 'let', 'go', 'one', 'reality', 'sustained', 'nurtured', 'psyche', 'can', 'embrace', 'real', 'Neil', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'fatidic', 'night', 'Araki', 'brilliantly', 'honest', 'heart-wrenching', 'unruly', 'story', 'taking', 'advantage', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'qualities', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Neil', 'daring', 'talented', 'actor', 'worked', 'many', 'interesting', 'independent', 'films', 'such', 'Brick', 'Lookout', 'Latter', 'Days', 'gay', 'themed', 'movie', 'actor', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'Brian', 'ideal', 'partner', 'Corbet', 'subtle', 'fascinating', 'character', 'completely', 'different', 'roles', 'inFunny', 'GamesorThirteen', 'proving', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'actor', 'also', 'how', 'choose', 'best', 'directors', 'work']",Mysterious Skin

I'd known about the main leads, namely Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet, from movies like Brick and Thirteen, respectively. Both outdo any other performances of their careers in this movie, however. It's haunting, chilling, entirely too disturbing to watch at times, but yet I found myself having to watch because I was so drawn in. Not a single moment went by when I wasn't completely fascinated, or when I wasn't feeling as though I was in the story myself.

As far as quality goes, I was pleasently surprised. I have a wide variety of movies in my collection. This , is by far one of the best. Perhaps that is because I have seen similar behaviour in real life. Jospeh Gordon-Levitt shows he is not just a ""one pony show"" as he stretches to the other end of the acting spectrum, comedy being at the other end. His tormented ""my pain is mine-just deal with me, this is how I ge male acceptance"" is done to perfection, never overdone. You never know where his character is going next emotionally. An entire movie could have been written around his characters' abuse by the coach, abandoment by his father, permiscuity  by his mother and deep feelings for his best female friend.Abused by the same coach, the character of Brian(Brady Corbet)reacts totally different to his early childhood circumstances, including an emotionally detached father, a dominant mother and sexual abuse by this same coach. His path leads to a very interesting and understandable journey, as he has blocked out his abuse in an interesting way. The results of his abuse physical and emotional present themselves allthroughout his upbringing and launch him on a journey to find ""the other kid"".Linking both abused teens is a gay friend who draws on the viewers' sympathty as he seems to fall for  both.This is an ""-A-"" movie in every aspect.

933103,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B000ATQYQU,Bruce G. Taylor,"[1, 1]","Some reviewers have said that, although favorable to this film, they would not watch it more than once. I have watched it a few times now and have gotten more from it and acquired a greater appreciation for it each time. It is certainly the finest film that TLA has released up to now. Whether or not it is classified as an ""Indi"" film, I don't know, but I find it a thoroughly professional film for several reasons. The screenplay and direction are of a level not often typical of films of this kind. The superb music score by Harold Budd and Robin Guthrie is haunting and unforgettable. And if that's not enough, there's one more: Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Gordon-Levitt, 24 at the time, brings a believable and three-dimensional quality to the chraracter of Neil McCormick that is overwhelmingly genuine and mesmerizing. The rest of the cast does excellent work here, but this is really Gordon-Levitt's picture. Of the three or four films in which I've seen him, this, in my mind, is his finest.  In the most violently harrowing scene of the film, Gordon-Levitt playing a young male prostitute, encounters more than he can handle and for the first time in the film is not in control of his situation as he always has been.  He realizes that the man who has taken him home clearly intends to violently rape him.  He tries to get away by locking himself in the bathroom by means of a hook on the door.  The man slips a knife through the crack in the door and flips up the hook.  The look on Gordon-Levittt's face, and particularly in his eyes, is exactly that of a trapped animal.  How he managed to convey this expression, I couldn't say, but it will give you nightmares or bring you to tears.  He and Brady Corbet create two characters who finally meet in the final 15 minutes of the film which becomes terribly heart rending; but this is a film well worth watching because it is an important and unforgettable film dealing with the subject of child molestation that is an issue of increasing public awareness in these times.The closing voice-over lines given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Neil) to Brady Corbet (Brian) after explaining what was done to them when they were children that is the most touching moment in the film.  Brian has collapsed, weeping, in Neil arms;I wanted to tell Brian it was over now and everything would be okay.But that was a lie, plus, I couldn't speak anyway.I wish there was some way for us to go back and undo the past.But there wasn't.There was nothing we could do.So I just stayed silent and trying to telepathically communicate...how sorry I was about what had happened.And I thought of all the grief and sadness...and f----d up suffering in the world...and it made me want to escape.I wished with all my heart that we could just...Ieave this world behind.Rise like two angels in the night and magically...disappear.ps: I more recently discovered that there is an excellent commentary track on this disc with director Gregg Araki, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet. It made me even more aware of the dedication and depth of feeling they and entire cast and company had for this remarkable film. The director explicitly points out that the two young actors who play the two boys at the ages of 7 and 8 were always protected from knowing what the subject matter of the film actually was.  A specially prepared script was created for them, while their parents saw the complete script and only after being assured that their sons would always be protected from knowing the full subject matter of the film gave their approval.  In most of the scenes involving the young boys, they were not playing to other actors, but to the camera with some innocent props while the highly sophisticated editing of the film led audiences to believe they were seeing things that they actually were not.  Only after realizing these details does the intelligence and artfulness that went into this film become apparent.More recently I purchased the Blu-ray disc of this film and the improvement in video and audio are striking and well worth the investment.

933107,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000ATQYQU,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","I found this film to be really excellent even though I personally found the scenes involving child sexual molestation very disturbing.I would like to point out several strenghts of the film:First, this film demonstrated the paths that different people may take after being sexually molested. Neil McCormick (wonderfully played by Joseph Gordon Levitt) was sexually molested by his little league coach when he was 8. He was used to help seduce other boys and he quickly learned many sexual tricks and ways to manipulate his molester. This leads him to be a male prostitute, totally in control of his older clients. The path for Brian Lackey (well played by actor Brady Corbet) was a very different path with Brian having a complete lapse in memory and yet feeling some very dark secret has happened to him which he attributes to being abducted by aliens.  The film perfectly captures the impact of molestation on a child and the way this impact is carried into their later years, behaviors, and relationships.Second, this was just excellent film making. The actors are superb. Elizabeth Shue is a bad but loving mother for her son Neil. I found it interesting that Neil's mother had poor supervision skills and Brian's mother had over protective supervision skills and yet both boys were sexually molested.Third, this film does an exceptional job of creating the world of a child sexual molester. The coach, played by Bill Sage, has all the signs of a child sexual molester. He makes friends with the parents and gets their trust. He had toys and other child friendly objects in his home to play with the kids he is seducing. He has a house full of pin ball machines and computer games and kid food. He gradually seduces Neil, using photography, play, and games in the seduction process. These scenes made me very uncomfortable because the child is under the power of the adult who has much more ability and resources to manipulate the situation.This is probably the best psychological exploration of child sexual molestation and its effects on film. A difficult film at times but well worth it.",5,Excellent and moving,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,2094,"['found', 'film', 'be', 'really', 'excellent', 'even', 'personally', 'found', 'scenes', 'involving', 'child', 'sexual', 'molestation', 'very', 'disturbing.I', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'several', 'strenghts', 'film', 'First', 'film', 'demonstrated', 'paths', 'different', 'people', 'may', 'take', 'being', 'sexually', 'molested', 'Neil', 'McCormick', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'was', 'sexually', 'molested', 'little', 'league', 'coach', 'when', 'was', '8', 'was', 'used', 'help', 'seduce', 'other', 'boys', 'quickly', 'learned', 'many', 'sexual', 'tricks', 'ways', 'manipulate', 'molester', 'be', 'male', 'prostitute', 'totally', 'control', 'older', 'clients', 'path', 'Brian', 'Lackey', 'well', 'played', 'actor', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'path', 'Brian', 'having', 'complete', 'lapse', 'memory', 'yet', 'feeling', 'very', 'dark', 'secret', 'happened', 'being', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'film', 'perfectly', 'impact', 'molestation', 'child', 'way', 'impact', 'carried', 'later', 'years', 'behaviors', 'relationships.Second', 'was', 'just', 'excellent', 'film', 'making', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'bad', 'loving', 'mother', 'son', 'Neil', 'found', 'interesting', 'Neil', 'mother', 'had', 'poor', 'supervision', 'skills', 'Brian', 'mother', 'had', 'protective', 'supervision', 'skills', 'yet', 'boys', 'were', 'sexually', 'molested.Third', 'film', 'exceptional', 'job', 'creating', 'world', 'child', 'sexual', 'molester', 'coach', 'played', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'signs', 'child', 'sexual', 'molester', 'friends', 'parents', 'trust', 'had', 'toys', 'other', 'child', 'friendly', 'objects', 'home', 'play', 'kids', 'seducing', 'house', 'full', 'pin', 'ball', 'machines', 'computer', 'games', 'kid', 'food', 'gradually', 'Neil', 'using', 'photography', 'play', 'games', 'seduction', 'process', 'scenes', 'made', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'child', 'power', 'adult', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'ability', 'resources', 'manipulate', 'situation.This', 'probably', 'best', 'psychological', 'exploration', 'child', 'sexual', 'molestation', 'effects', 'film', 'difficult', 'film', 'times', 'well']",Mysterious Skin

Slipman,"[2, 2]","The independently produced ""Mysterious Skin"" is a poignant and certainly different coming of age movie, written and directed by Gregg Araki.  The film represents an account of two young boys growing up in tiny town of Hutchison, Kansas, Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey.  McCormick played by both Chase Ellison(as an 8 yr. old) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt(as a teen) and Lackey played by George Webster and Brady Corbet both played on the same Little League team.Neil was the product of a single parent household namely his free spirited mother played by Elisabeth Shue.  He was shrewdly seduced into an aberrant sexual relationship by his pedophilic baseball coach.  Years later has seen his evolution into a homosexual teenaged male prostitute who flees to New York to increase his chances for action.Brian, meanwhile, was a shy, introverted child prone to nosebeeds and bed wetting.  An unexplained episode as an 8 year old in which he had a five hour memory lapse apparently patterned his adolescence.  While growing up he believed that he'd been abducted by aliens.  This conviction shaped his existence and caused him to reach out to another who apparently shared his experience the peculiar Avalyn Friesen played by Mary Lynn Rajskub (who plays the quirky Chloe on TV's 24).Brian meanwhile had a strong belief that an experience shared by Neil and himself had a major impact on their lives.  Brian looked forward to Neil's return to Kansas at Christmas time to enlighten him.Araki portrays the lives of the boys in a gritty, revealing fashion.  No holds are barred as Neil's hustling lifestyle filled with violence and abuse is graphically portrayed.  The fragile psyche of Brian is revealed to be the product of a horrific and tabooed encounter in his early childhood.",4,The devastation of childhood trauma,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,1772,"['independently', 'produced', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'poignant', 'certainly', 'different', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'Gregg', 'Araki', 'film', 'account', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'growing', 'up', 'tiny', 'town', 'Hutchison', 'Kansas', 'Neil', 'McCormick', 'Brian', 'Lackey', 'McCormick', 'played', 'Chase', 'Ellison', '8', 'yr.', 'old', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'teen', 'Lackey', 'played', 'George', 'Webster', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'played', 'same', 'Little', 'League', 'team.Neil', 'was', 'product', 'single', 'parent', 'household', 'namely', 'free', 'spirited', 'mother', 'played', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'was', 'shrewdly', 'seduced', 'aberrant', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'pedophilic', 'baseball', 'coach', 'Years', 'later', 'seen', 'evolution', 'homosexual', 'teenaged', 'male', 'prostitute', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'increase', 'chances', 'action.Brian', 'meanwhile', 'was', 'shy', 'introverted', 'child', 'prone', 'nosebeeds', 'bed', 'wetting', 'unexplained', 'episode', '8', 'year', 'old', 'had', 'five', 'hour', 'memory', 'lapse', 'apparently', 'patterned', 'adolescence', 'growing', 'up', 'believed', ""'d"", 'been', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'conviction', 'shaped', 'existence', 'caused', 'reach', 'out', 'who', 'apparently', 'shared', 'experience', 'peculiar', 'Avalyn', 'Friesen', 'played', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'who', 'quirky', 'Chloe', 'TV', '24', '.Brian', 'meanwhile', 'had', 'strong', 'belief', 'experience', 'shared', 'Neil', 'had', 'major', 'impact', 'lives', 'Brian', 'looked', 'forward', 'Neil', 'return', 'Kansas', 'Christmas', 'time', 'enlighten', 'him.Araki', 'portrays', 'lives', 'boys', 'gritty', 'revealing', 'fashion', 'are', 'barred', 'Neil', 'hustling', 'lifestyle', 'filled', 'violence', 'abuse', 'graphically', 'portrayed', 'fragile', 'psyche', 'Brian', 'revealed', 'be', 'product', 'horrific', 'tabooed', 'encounter', 'early', 'childhood']",Mysterious Skin
933111,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000ATQYQU,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 5]","For all its focus on sexuality and abuse, the film's strongest points come in portraying teen angst in a real manner, better than even Stand By Me, as well as the loneliness children feel in small towns, especially the pointless frustration that talentless youths feel. This is because, for all the idolatry bestowed upon him by the three other teens: Wendy, Eric, and Brian, the fact is that Neil is utterly run of the mill and forgettable. And, at some level, he knows this, and reviles the others for their worship. The film has moments that evoke the best in films like My Dog Skip, My Life As A Dog, The Curse Of The Cat People, and Godzilla's Revenge, all terrific films that deal with often overlooked aspects of childhood. The film suffered many slings along the road to production- from bad reviews to attempts at censorship and banning, and, at a cost of $10 million made less than a tenth of that in box office, according to online sources. It's too bad, because films like this, despite their flaws, should be made in Hollywood, not by self-marginalized directors like Araki (who seems to revel in gay and sexually bizarre subcultural themes).Mysterious Skin is a film that, upon rewatch, and even just after letting it settle in, will inevitably leave one wanting for more, but it does show that Araki is a filmmaker with potential, mostly via the screenplay aspect of the film, although Steve Gainer's cinematography also shows potential. It is not a film that, like those of Michelangelo Antonioni nor Akira Kurosawa, will dazzle you, but it will leave something within, and that's all to rare these days. If Araki can rein in his worst tendencies (such as the belief that sex is easy for anyone to get- including nerds like Brian and Avalyn, and that there are a plethora of buff gay men willing to pay for anonymous sex with strangers), which likely emanate from his own unresolved sexual issues, his art can soar.

933115,A1KISYZSUGHL5P,B000ATQYQU,David Romano,"[7, 9]","I've yet to read the book this film is based on, and I plan to.  My main commentary is on the acting, mainly that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michelle Trachtenberg.Michelle Trachtenberg plays Wendy, best friend and soulmate ot Neil, played by Jospeh Gordon-Levitt.  I had grabbed the box recognizing Gordon-Levitt, and really dind't pay attention to the rest of the cast; the synopsis on the back caught my eye, and so I rented it.  WOW.If you're like me, you're familiar with Joseph Gordon-Levitt from ""3rd Rock From the Sun"", and Michelle Trachtenberg from Seasons 5-7 of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".  Let's face it, neither of them developed much more than a fanboy following based on sometimes canned performances on network televsion.  Gordon-Levitt was the cute teen comic relief in his show, and Michelle Trachtenbergs' ""Dawn"" character was mostly dull, and at times downright annoying.  So imagine my surprise when I first hear Neil's voice and realize that it's Gordon-Levitt.  Imagine my shock seeing little miss priss playing a young girl doing drugs, smoking cigarettes, and helping her best friend, Neil, turn tricks!The depth of these two alone makes the film worthwhile, especially Gordon-Levitt.  His self-loathing Neil, desperately trying to reclaim his status as ""Coach's favourite"" with older, unattractive men who remind him of Coach, is an emotionally void character with so much depth once you get past his outside.It's painfully obvious he is trying to reclaim something special, in a warped sort of way, and some of the scenes he finds himself in when he gets to NYC are frighteningly intense.  His first trick is with a rough-and-tumble stud who demands to be penetrated by the teenage Neil, who has to be shown how to use a condom (and has obviously never topped a guy before).  His second encounter is the most intense, moreso than his third because of the impact it has.  The ever-creepy Billy Drago plays this second trick, and when he disrobes and you see the tell-tale Karposi's Sarcoma, you don't know what to think.  Even the act of giving this man a backrub was made so disturbing, it's obvious that this encounter has changed Neil in some way.  But not enough, because he does one last trick, and ends up raped by his john.  It was frightening, but it wasn't as intense as the second scene.  Not sure why though.Trachtenberg's Wendy is there supporting Neil all the way.  where he is somewhat stuck in his childhood, she has moved on, encouraging him to find a job and playing his conscience.  She shows an edge I didn't think she possessed, to be honest.Brady Corbett (Brian) and Mary Lynn Rajskub were also excellently cast, but by about halfway through the film when it hits you like a ton of bricks that Brian was also molested by Coach, the ""alien abduction"" storyline gets a bit old.  It's well-played, and the introduction of Eric isn't as odd to me as it was to some.  After all, Brian isn't comfortable with women, he isn't a sexual being, and being friends with Eric puts him that much closer to Neil.  That part worked out very well, at least in my opinion.The last scene of the film, when Neil reveals to Brian what happened when they were mutually abused by Coach was one of the most disturbing and moving scenes of the film.  There was an emotional rawness to Brian; his pain was so obvious.  Neil was cold and matter-of-fact, almost as if just telling a story about a day at the part instead of a story of molestation.  IKt made the film, and took it to a whole new level.",5,Depth from actors I didn't think had it in them...,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,3521,"[""'ve"", 'yet', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'plan', 'main', 'commentary', 'acting', 'mainly', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg.Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Wendy', 'best', 'friend', 'soulmate', 'ot', 'Neil', 'played', 'Jospeh', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'had', 'grabbed', 'box', 'recognizing', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'really', ""dind't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'rest', 'cast', 'synopsis', 'back', 'caught', 'eye', 'so', 'rented', 'WOW.If', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', '3rd', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Seasons', '5-7', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Let', 'face', 'developed', 'much', 'more', 'fanboy', 'following', 'based', 'sometimes', 'canned', 'performances', 'network', 'televsion', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'was', 'cute', 'teen', 'comic', 'relief', 'show', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenbergs', 'Dawn', 'character', 'was', 'mostly', 'dull', 'times', 'downright', 'annoying', 'So', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'first', 'hear', 'Neil', 'voice', 'realize', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Imagine', 'shock', 'seeing', 'little', 'miss', 'priss', 'playing', 'young', 'girl', 'doing', 'drugs', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'helping', 'best', 'friend', 'Neil', 'turn', 'tricks', 'depth', 'two', 'alone', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'especially', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'self-loathing', 'Neil', 'desperately', 'trying', 'reclaim', 'status', 'Coach', 'favourite', 'older', 'unattractive', 'men', 'who', 'remind', 'Coach', 'emotionally', 'void', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'once', 'get', 'outside.It', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'trying', 'reclaim', 'something', 'special', 'warped', 'sort', 'way', 'scenes', 'when', 'NYC', 'are', 'frighteningly', 'intense', 'first', 'trick', 'rough-and-tumble', 'stud', 'who', 'be', 'penetrated', 'teenage', 'Neil', 'who', 'be', 'shown', 'how', 'use', 'condom', 'obviously', 'never', 'topped', 'guy', 'second', 'encounter', 'most', 'intense', 'moreso', 'third', 'impact', 'ever-creepy', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'second', 'trick', 'when', 'see', 'tell-tale', 'Karposi', 'Sarcoma', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'Even', 'act', 'giving', 'man', 'backrub', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'disturbing', 'obvious', 'encounter', 'changed', 'Neil', 'way', 'not', 'enough', 'one', 'last', 'trick', 'up', 'raped', 'john', 'was', 'frightening', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'intense', 'second', 'scene', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'though.Trachtenberg', 'Wendy', 'there', 'supporting', 'Neil', 'way', 'where', 'somewhat', 'stuck', 'childhood', 'moved', 'encouraging', 'find', 'job', 'playing', 'conscience', 'edge', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'possessed', 'be', 'honest.Brady', 'Corbett', 'Brian', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'were', 'also', 'excellently', 'cast', 'halfway', 'film', 'when', 'ton', 'bricks', 'Brian', 'was', 'also', 'molested', 'Coach', 'alien', 'abduction', 'storyline', 'bit', 'old', 'well-played', 'introduction', 'Eric', ""n't"", 'as', 'odd', 'was', 'Brian', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'women', ""n't"", 'sexual', 'being', 'being', 'friends', 'Eric', 'much', 'closer', 'Neil', 'part', 'worked', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'least', 'opinion.The', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Neil', 'Brian', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'were', 'mutually', 'abused', 'Coach', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'moving', 'scenes', 'film', 'was', 'emotional', 'rawness', 'Brian', 'pain', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'Neil', 'was', 'cold', 'matter-of-fact', 'almost', 'just', 'telling', 'story', 'day', 'part', 'instead', 'story', 'molestation', 'IKt', 'made', 'film', 'took', 'whole', 'new', 'level']",Mysterious Skin

Somehow I didn't have the compulsion to write anything about it, like I usually would when I have watched a (good or bad) film. It was because I was reeling from the disturbing effects the film had on me even after two days.""The summer I was eight years old, five hours disappeared from my life""? so runs the catchy opening to the adapted film. The boy grows up believeing that he was abducted by strange aliens the five hours he was lost. The other grows up to be a gay hustler until he has a tragic and violent encounter. The material wasn't groundbreaking; it talks about paedophilic gay child abuse and the effects it had on the two boys involved in it long after it was over. However, it was the realism portrayed by the leads Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock From The Sun) and Brady Corbet that really shook me inside. It also revealed the stereotypical American gay society in the 80's and early 90's. The two little known actors and the supporting cast of Jeff Licon and Michelle Trachtenberg who play Levitt's best friends also lent great depth to the movie.I really loved the scene where the snow fell and God was heard.

Granted the overriding themes are valid and worthy of exploration, I just find Araki's approach exploitative and relentless. The plot revolves around two eight year-old boys traumatized by incidents that affected them in completely different ways. Brian is a geek who thinks he was abducted by aliens, while surly Neil has become a male prostitute in a futile attempt to recapture the intimacy he felt with his Little League coach. That the boys' parallel stories converge over the next decade becomes pretty obvious when Brian's journey takes on increasingly contrived dimensions, especially as he connects with Avalyn, an obsessive farm girl who claims to have had a similar alien encounter. However, it's Neil's journey that Araki chooses to present in disturbing detail with one scene of sexual degradation after another ending with an act of violent sodomy in a bathtub.Obviously distancing himself from his ""Third Rock from the Sun"" character to develop some indie cred, Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays Neil with passive hostility in a hollow attempt to look cool. Brady Corbet certainly captures the awkwardness of Brian, but his unchanging naivet&eacute; gets tiresome. Only in the final minutes does either actor achieve a sense of poignancy. I was amazed and somewhat saddened to see Elisabeth Shue in the role of Neil's blowsy mother, though her role is gratefully brief. Michelle Trachtenberg and Jeff Licon actually manage to elicit some sympathy for their oddball characters, though Mary Lynn Rajskub takes the cake for her portrayal of Avalyn. Other roles are acted atrociously like a snuff film, which may have been Araki's intent. It's obvious that he is trying to compensate for a weakly developed storytelling technique with scenes that are designed to provoke and shock. I have to admit that when the plot strands come together at the end, the movie improves considerably. But by that point, it is too late as I became far more numbed than moved by the conclusion.",2,"Selective Memory Tale Derailed by Araki's Exploitative, Disturbing Approach",1134604800,"12 15, 2005",2005,2190,"['never', 'read', 'Scott', 'Heim', 'source', 'novel', 'regardless', 'am', 'genuinely', 'bewildered', 'praise', 'heaped', 'director-screenwriter', 'Gregg', 'Araki', 'amateurish', '2005', 'feature', 'child', 'abuse', 'recovered', 'memory', 'Granted', 'overriding', 'themes', 'are', 'valid', 'worthy', 'exploration', 'just', 'find', 'Araki', 'approach', 'exploitative', 'relentless', 'plot', 'around', 'two', 'eight', 'year-old', 'boys', 'traumatized', 'incidents', 'affected', 'completely', 'different', 'ways', 'Brian', 'geek', 'who', 'was', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'surly', 'Neil', 'become', 'male', 'prostitute', 'futile', 'attempt', 'recapture', 'intimacy', 'felt', 'Little', 'League', 'coach', 'boys', 'parallel', 'stories', 'converge', 'next', 'decade', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'when', 'Brian', 'journey', 'increasingly', 'contrived', 'dimensions', 'especially', 'Avalyn', 'obsessive', 'farm', 'girl', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'similar', 'alien', 'encounter', 'However', 'Neil', 'journey', 'Araki', 'present', 'disturbing', 'detail', 'one', 'scene', 'sexual', 'degradation', 'ending', 'act', 'violent', 'sodomy', 'bathtub.Obviously', 'distancing', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'character', 'develop', 'indie', 'cred', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'portrays', 'Neil', 'passive', 'hostility', 'hollow', 'attempt', 'look', 'cool', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'certainly', 'awkwardness', 'Brian', 'unchanging', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'tiresome', 'Only', 'final', 'minutes', 'actor', 'achieve', 'sense', 'poignancy', 'was', 'amazed', 'somewhat', 'saddened', 'see', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'role', 'Neil', 'blowsy', 'mother', 'role', 'gratefully', 'brief', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Jeff', 'Licon', 'actually', 'manage', 'elicit', 'sympathy', 'oddball', 'characters', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'cake', 'portrayal', 'Avalyn', 'Other', 'roles', 'are', 'acted', 'atrociously', 'snuff', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Araki', 'intent', 'obvious', 'trying', 'compensate', 'weakly', 'developed', 'storytelling', 'technique', 'scenes', 'are', 'designed', 'provoke', 'shock', 'have', 'admit', 'when', 'plot', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'movie', 'considerably', 'point', 'too', 'late', 'became', 'far', 'more', 'numbed', 'moved', 'conclusion']",Mysterious Skin

Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Although it is sometimes listed under gay and lesbian interest, or even under erotica, MYSTERIOUS SKIN is in fact a dark, often painful movie leavened with rare flashes of perverse humor and sexiness that only serve to make the rest of the film seem even darker.Two eight year old boys are in the same little league baseball team.  One, Neil, is already beginning to identify himself as gay; the other, Brian, is a complete innocent with few, if any, ideas about sexuality.  Both children are molested by their coach, and the molestation touches off very different reactions.As a teenager, Neil becomes a prostitute, constantly trying recreate the relationship and he had with the coach; Brian, however, blocks the memory entirely, and gradually becomes obsessed with the idea that the &#8220;lost time&#8221; arose from a UFO abduction.  Eventually Brian recalls Neil, and&#8212;believing that Neil too was a victim of UFO abduction&#8212;searches him out, hoping that Neil can remember what he does not.  And Neil has not forgotten a thing.The movie runs on parallel tracks, detailing Neil and Brian&#8217;s lives in separate fashion until the two again meet more than a decade after their molestation.  Although Brian does not remember the molestation, there is never any question about what actually occurred, so the film is not so much a &#8220;what happened&#8221; as it is a &#8220;what it did to us.&#8221;  Brian&#8217;s fixation on UFOs is actually thematic: he is convinced that he was abducted and examined by an alien, and in a sense he was, although the alien in question was not from outer space but a small town kid&#8217;s baseball coach who probably did more damage to the children than any self-respecting outer space alien would.Although the story is interesting and the script well-written, the film lives on its performances.  The child actors, especially Chase Ellison as the young Neil, are astonishing, and their accomplishment is all the more impressive when the director states, on the audio commentary track, that the children were kept oblivious to the nature of the story, with most of the molestation scenes created in the cutting room.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet are flawless as the teenage Neil and Brian, and Bill Sage is remarkably powerful in the small role of Coach, who appears only briefly in the film but seems to dominate it.MYSTERIOUS SKIN is not going to please everyone.  It is as sexually explicit as it can be without going into X territory; the seduction and molestation of the children is painful; and a fairly graphic rape scene equally so.

933134,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B000ATQYQU,Get What We Give,"[11, 13]","Mysterious Skin delivers on all cylinders as a film about child abuse and the effects it has on the children who have been abused.That is absolutely NOT what I thought this film was going to be about. It made me enjoy it all the more - though this is not a particularly enjoyable film to watch all the time.Two young men in a small town in Kansas are unconsciously dealing with the effects of former sexual abuse a young boys at the hands of their little league coach.Neil (absolutely played to perfection by Joseph Gordon Levitt) and Brian (played not quite as effectively by Brady Corbet)are both in their late teens. Neil was the ""favorite"" of the child molesting coach and spent almost every day of an entire summer in the coach's grasp, whereas Brian suffered only twice over several years at the coach's hands.Neil, we know from the start, acknowledges that he felt sexual urges for other boys prior to the molestation. After the molestation, though, he burgeons into a streetwise, emotionally unavailable street hustler, who hides his profession only from his somewhat slutty, but loving mother (Elizabeth Shue).Brian, was the worst player on the little league team. He was timid and scared of his own shadow to begin with. The molestation pushes him further into an introverted, inhibited life. Further, he doesn't remember the molestation. His life has been full of black outs, nose bleeds, and seizures, which, he is convinced, are the results of being abducted by aliens - since he has no memory of the molestation.Neil seems to know that he is a hot item. He has no problem displaying his lithe and sinewy body for any and all men willing to pay. In his small town bar, he tells his friend Eric, that he has slept with every man in the bar. Eric, a gay young man who moved to the small town from California, finds it apalling that Neil seems only attracted to older, fatter, and unavailable men - since Eric is in love with Neil.Neil moves to New York to join his best female friend, Wendy (Michelle Tractenberg) in the city that never sleeps. It isn't what he thought it would be.In his little Kansas town, he was the town's only male satyr and he was completely protected from the truly kinky lifestyle of the out homosexuality that a city like New York offers. He was also fairly protected from AIDS - it just wasn't something he had to worry about. In a telling scene, in New York, one of his first tricks insists Neil use a condom. From Neil's expression, not only does he not how to put one on, but it is doubtful he's ever seen one before.In a scene that I found terribly frightening, until I realized what was going to actually happening, Neil picks up a creepy looking trick, Zeke (played by the ever able and creepy actor Billy Drago), and is not sure he should have done so. The reality of his mistake is evident when Zeke disrobes and even naive Neil becomes aware of what his sexual promiscuity can result in: Zeke is covered with Karposi's Sarcoma lesions. Fortunately, Zeke is benevolent enough not to want Neil to actually have sex with him. It is an intense scene.Neil and Brian don't know each other. They didn't really know each other as young boys. However, Brian is encouraged by a fellow ""alien abductee"" to find others who shared his abduction. He is convinced that Neil (though he doesn't know his name) was abducted with him.Finally upon meeting Neil, when Neil returns to Kansas beaten and horribly battered by a New York trick gone bad, Brian learns the truth about what happened ten years earlier. This scene, too, is very poignant and painful to watch.Mysterious Skin is a painful, but believable film. It is not joyous, but is is insightful. Having worked with abused kids before, I found this movie very very realistic in its depiction of the two dichotomies of the abused boys portrayed in this film: one a sexual deviant after his abuse; the other sexually repressed and in denial.This is brilliant filmmaking from Greg Araki, whom I've not been impressed by in the past.Get this film to get a dose of sad reality.

933136,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ATQYQU,Grady Harp,"[7, 8]","MYSTERIOUS SKIN is a brilliant film made with tremendous courage and skill by the justly venerated Gregg Araki.  His screen adaptation of Scott Heim's fine book is tough, insightful, balanced, challenging, and wholly successful.  Few other directors, except possibly Gus van Sant and the Stephen M. Ryder/Michael Cuesta team ('L.I.E'), would be brave enough to make a motion picture that presents a story that includes pedophilia and there find a moving study of developing sexuality in youngsters that becomes an important and sophisticated drama.1981, Hutchinson, Kansas.  Neil McCormick (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is 8 years old and finds fascination watching his rather loose mother Ellen (Elizabeth Shue) have sex with multiple partners.  Neil is attracted to and desires the males Ellen brings to the house. He is a hang loose guy and the star member of a Little League baseball team coached by ruggedly handsome Bill Sage.  Also on the team is a another 8-year-old, Brian Lackey (Brady Corbet,) who is from a neighboring town and is the easily distracted, bespectacled, non-athletic son of Mr and Mrs Lackey (Chris Mulkey and Lisa Long), whose sole reason for being on the team is at the demand of his macho father.Some time lapses and Brian becomes convinced he has been abducted by aliens, the only way he can explain a loss of 5 hours of time and the presence of subsequent nosebleeds and fainting spells. In Hutchinson, Neil's attraction to his Coach results in a close friendship that just happens to evolve into sexual play, something Neil treasures as he has fallen in love with his Coach.  Neil's best friends are Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg) in whom he confides everything, and gay Eric (Jeffrey Licon) who happens to be in love with Neil.1991 and the two boys have matured - Neil has become a fulltime hustler, receiving pay for sex from older men cruising the park. Wendy moves to New York after gently warning Neil to always play safe in his 'occupation'.  Meanwhile Brian has grown up into a lad obsessed with outer space aliens and discovers a friend Avalyn (Mary Lynn Rajskub) through a TV show about people who claim to have been abducted by aliens. They bond much to Brian's now-single mother's concern, and Avalyn pledges to help Brian find the people who haunt his dreams about the missing five hours of his life at age 8.Neil moves to New York and becomes a full time hustler, falling in with all manner of johns and becomes disturbed when he is confronted by an AIDS patient john followed by a sadomasochistic john.  Wendy encourages him to leave hustling and find a 'real' job.  Neil's mother lovingly sends Neil tickets to return home for Christmas and Neil departs New York for a meaningful trip home.  While Neil has been away Brian has discovered with Avalyn's help that Neil is the strange person in his nightmares, becomes friends with Eric - his connection to Neil - and Brian awaits Neil's return to Hutchinson to confront Neil and find his missing 5 hours of years past.  Aided by Eric, Neil and Brian bond and Neil agrees to reenact a significant moment when they were eight years old, a transformative time that includes the coach and the effect of the Coach on the two boys' lives.  It is a powerful moment has monumental consequences.Araki directs this story with such grace and finesse that he makes each of the main characters not only credible but also multidimensional and loveable.  There are no good guy/bad guy polarities in Araki's vision, only a spectrum that feels as real as the air we breathe.  Every member of this large cast is superb, without exception, but the work of Joseph Gordon-Levitt anchors this film with wholly natural and brilliant acting.  The others (Brady Corbet, Michelle Trachtenberg, Elizabeth Shue, Bill Sage especially) rise to the same level.  Kudos also go to the young actors Chase Ellison and George Webster who portray Neil and Brian at the age of 8.  And the musical score unlerscores the action well.This may not be a movie for everyone, though I wish it were as seeing this film provides deep understanding into some of the sexual spectrum too many people refuse to address.  It is a wholly successful film on every level.  Highly Recommended.

The performances throughout are outstanding - especially that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an in-your-face gay teen who uses sex as a means to an end - whether hustling or simply giving it away.

A series of events after Neil's move to New York City prove that his line of work is downright hazardous, and in the end, it is up to him to pick himself up from ruin and claim a new lease on life.The performances from both lead actors as well as supporting roles from Michelle Trachtenberg were outstanding--far and away superior to their peers in every respect.

Two young, Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Brian (Brady Corbet), find themselves transfixed by the past: Brian cannot remember everything that happened to him in the summer of 1981 when he played in Little League, and Neil remembers it all too vividly. Neil has become a hustler in his hometown of Hutchison, KS, while Brian is convinced he was kidnapped by aliens and has lost his memory as a result. It doesn't give too much away to say their paths coincide by the end of the film, as they find they knew each other that summer so long ago.Araki has always been praised for his stylistic approach to films and his vision, but he's never had a film before that could well employ his themes of nihilistic youth, confused sexuality, and middle-class anomie quite as well as this one (in large part due to the fact that for once this film is based on another writer's material). Corbet and Gordon-Leavitt are both terrific in the leading roles, although the showier part of the tough charismatic Neil allows Gordon-Levitt to shine more than Corbet can with the meeker role of Brian. And shine Gordon-Levitt does: his is really a star-making performance. The actors in smaller parts--particularly the always welcome Elisabeth Shue as Neil's trashy mother, and Jeff Licon as his best friend, the sweet and less confident Eric--do very fine work, although the only real failing of the film is that Araki seems a bit unsure what to do with the smaller parts (they seem underwritten).

933154,A3O4HKFSVP9JM4,B000ATQYQU,Jennifer Heath,"[84, 89]","Be forewarned: This film takes a frank look at pedophilia, prostitution, and rape from the perspective of two sexually abused boys. If you are honestly interested in understanding the long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse, director Gregg Araki's film is an extremely thoughtful and non-exploitive examination of a painful and relatively neglected film topic.In Hutchison, Kansas, during the summer of 1981, Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Brian (Brady Corbett), are molested by their little league baseball coach (Bill Sage). Brian's response to the abuse is to blackout and to forget what happened to him. In order to account for his two blackouts, Brian imagines that aliens abducted him. Neil, however, becomes the team's star player, and develops a summer long relationship with Coach. Unlike Brian, Neil both remembers and attempts to control and re-experience his exploitation by becoming a male prostitute.  Eventually, Brian, haunted by bizarre dreams, seeks to end his general sense of malaise. After a fellow alien abductee encourages him to follow the clues from his dreams, Brian discovers that he and Neil share a common past.So many of the things in this film are spot on. In point of fact, boys are more often abused by babysitters, coaches, and teachers.  And while Neil tells his best friend Wendy about the abuse (after making her witness his abuse of another boy), neither boy tells his parents.  Also, there is no recognizable symptom of sexual abuse; the two boys respond to their experience in remarkable different ways. Neil identifies with his abuser; Brian disassociates himself from his sexuality. Though both boys develop compulsive behaviors, the film skirts clear of oversimplifying their psychological distress. And probable the most painful scene in the film, the revictimization of Neil at the hands of a client, reminds us of one horrible after effect of childhood sexual abuse; abuse victims are more likely to be raped as adolescents and adults.The weakest links in this film are the portrayals of Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Mrs. M. (Elisabeth Shue). Both Trachtenberg and Shue are too wholesome for their roles. The ""edge"" that both Wendy and Mrs. M. should have ( after all, Mrs. M is a single mom who works as a cashier by day while entertaining herself with an ever changing stream of bedmates by night, while Wendy insinuates that she lacks parental care and attention) is conveyed through visual gimmicks (the ubiquitous cigarette, tough make-up and wild hair styles) rather than compelling acting.Unlike others who have seen this film, I do not think that Araki was seeking to portray Coach as a nice guy, or even as a morally ambiguous guy. Rather, Araki is showing us a true sexual predator - a wolf in sheep's clothing, as it were.  Sexual predators work very hard to establish trust -- which requires at least a veneer of niceness - since trust is necessary in order for them to do what they want to do to their child victims.  If anything, I thought Araki showed how deeply confusing and painful it was for Neil to grapple with what he wanted to believe about Coach -- that Coach loved and cared about him -- with reality -- Coach's interest in Neil was limited to Neil's usefulness as a means of sexual satisfaction.The film's final scene, in which Brian and Neil begin to heal a traumatic betrayal of trust by trusting each other, will stay with me for a very long time.",4,Innocence Lost.,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,3432,"['Be', 'forewarned', 'film', 'frank', 'look', 'pedophilia', 'prostitution', 'rape', 'perspective', 'two', 'sexually', 'abused', 'boys', 'are', 'honestly', 'interested', 'understanding', 'long-term', 'effects', 'childhood', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'director', 'Gregg', 'Araki', 'film', 'extremely', 'thoughtful', 'non-exploitive', 'examination', 'painful', 'relatively', 'neglected', 'film', 'topic.In', 'Hutchison', 'Kansas', 'summer', '1981', 'Neil', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Brian', 'Brady', 'Corbett', 'are', 'molested', 'little', 'league', 'baseball', 'coach', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'Brian', 'response', 'abuse', 'blackout', 'forget', 'what', 'happened', 'order', 'account', 'two', 'blackouts', 'Brian', 'aliens', 'abducted', 'Neil', 'however', 'team', 'star', 'player', 'summer', 'long', 'relationship', 'Coach', 'Unlike', 'Brian', 'Neil', 'remembers', 'attempts', 'control', 're-experience', 'exploitation', 'becoming', 'male', 'prostitute', 'Eventually', 'Brian', 'haunted', 'bizarre', 'dreams', 'end', 'general', 'sense', 'malaise', 'fellow', 'alien', 'abductee', 'follow', 'clues', 'dreams', 'Brian', 'Neil', 'share', 'common', 'past.So', 'many', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'spot', 'point', 'fact', 'boys', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'abused', 'babysitters', 'coaches', 'teachers', 'Neil', 'best', 'friend', 'Wendy', 'abuse', 'making', 'witness', 'abuse', 'boy', 'boy', 'parents', 'Also', 'recognizable', 'symptom', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'two', 'boys', 'respond', 'experience', 'remarkable', 'different', 'ways', 'Neil', 'abuser', 'Brian', 'sexuality', 'boys', 'develop', 'compulsive', 'behaviors', 'film', 'skirts', 'clear', 'oversimplifying', 'psychological', 'distress', 'probable', 'most', 'painful', 'scene', 'film', 'revictimization', 'Neil', 'hands', 'client', 'one', 'horrible', 'effect', 'childhood', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'abuse', 'victims', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'raped', 'adolescents', 'adults.The', 'weakest', 'links', 'film', 'are', 'portrayals', 'Wendy', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Mrs.', 'M.', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Trachtenberg', 'Shue', 'are', 'too', 'wholesome', 'roles', 'edge', 'Wendy', 'Mrs.', 'M.', 'should', 'have', 'Mrs.', 'M', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'cashier', 'day', 'entertaining', 'ever', 'changing', 'stream', 'bedmates', 'night', 'Wendy', 'parental', 'care', 'attention', 'conveyed', 'visual', 'gimmicks', 'ubiquitous', 'cigarette', 'tough', 'make-up', 'wild', 'hair', 'styles', 'rather', 'compelling', 'acting.Unlike', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Araki', 'was', 'seeking', 'portray', 'Coach', 'nice', 'guy', 'even', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'guy', 'Rather', 'Araki', 'showing', 'true', 'sexual', 'predator', 'wolf', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'were', 'Sexual', 'predators', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'establish', 'trust', 'least', 'veneer', 'niceness', 'trust', 'necessary', 'order', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'child', 'victims', 'anything', 'thought', 'Araki', 'showed', 'how', 'deeply', 'confusing', 'painful', 'was', 'Neil', 'grapple', 'what', 'wanted', 'believe', 'Coach', 'Coach', 'loved', 'cared', 'reality', 'Coach', 'interest', 'Neil', 'was', 'limited', 'Neil', 'usefulness', 'means', 'sexual', 'satisfaction.The', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'Brian', 'Neil', 'begin', 'heal', 'traumatic', 'betrayal', 'trust', 'trusting', 'other', 'will', 'stay', 'very', 'long', 'time']",Mysterious Skin

Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[12, 21]","Inner demons being what they are, and seeing how they are inextricably bound to the drive to create art - something outside oneself - it was only a matter of time until we had a movie about the devastation that child abuse brings into the lives of children.This movie is horrible to watch, because it does not shrink from the pain of pulling off an unhealed scab.  This movie is beautifully done for the same reason.From the arrogant, abusive, self loathing of Neil (Joseph Gorfon Levitt), a teenage gay prostitute, his emotionally self-involved mother (Elizabeth Shue), the UFO obsessed Brian (Brady Corbett), every single role in this film is superbly acted and nuanced.This film is awful in content, truthful in the telling, raw in story, and given a light hand in directing that makes you feel you are there.  The aspect of the plot that gets repeated, a point that is for others to discuss is that it implys that child molestation is sexually gratifying and pleasant for the child.  That implication creates an unspoken complicity of the child that I don't think any society wants to delve into, and I'm not sure it is even a good directoral choice for this film.  It muddies the message.Still, the message is unmistakable, that these characters will absolutely never recover from what was done to them as children.  It is too bad that in all these years of filmmaking, we have never been able to get a filmmaker to make a similar message regarding the rape of women.  I've actually had filmmakers say that rape is irrelevant to character, a plot device and nothing else.I can not give this movie 5 stars, because one of the qualities of a great film to me is that it is entertaining.  This isn't.  It isn't even cathartic.  It is fantastically realized, but it is predominantly a trip down the sewer with (Neil) someone you don't like and can not trust.  You feel sorry for him, but no real solution is forthcoming.  It is real... but then, is that really what anyone wants in a movie?  No wonder movie theatres are dying.It goes down to 3 stars because I can not unreservedly recommend this film.  I will be surprised if I ever recommend this film to more than 3 people in my life.  So ultimately, it means that this incredible talent of storytelling, acting, directing, and all other aspects of this film are wasted on something that may only be viewed by the artsy intelligencia, and voting members of the Academy of Motion Pictures.

'Mysterious Skin' boorishly attacks us with flashbacks that, while not overly graphic, do enough to the viewer to leave you asking, ""Why did I rent this again?"" This was certainly the case with my friends and I, who could do nothing more than shake our heads as we fast-forwarded through gratuitous nonsensically graphic scenes that could have been left out of the film completely while still accomplishing the goal of the director. There are some seriously hard-to-take portions of film and it often seems like the director is attempting to force-feed us the horrors that child-abuse will produce down the line.The plot is based on two young men who are dealing with their shared pasts in different ways. One thinks he was abducted by aliens while the other still has a psychological bond with the man who took advantage of him. Both end up confronting each other as they confront their tragic past and form a common union that will eventually help lead to their healing.There are plenty of films out there that are of high quality work, and Mysterious Skin is well-made on the art front, but the theme is far too strong for most to deal with, especially if you have experienced the trauma that comes with child-abuse.

I was interested in this film 'cause GREG ARAKI did it and he made one of my ALL-TIME favorite films - NOWHERE (1997).  That was a while ago and since then he did SPLENDOR (which I thought was a bit too dry and goofy), but this film shows Greg Araki doing a more solid and classic-style form of filmmaking, while staying true to the heart of things.

933166,A2ZHB7E544QLLQ,B000ATQYQU,"Jon Hunt ""musician, teacher""","[1, 1]","""Mysterious Skin"", a story of the parallel lives of two boys from Hutchinson, Kansas, is riveting from the beginning. This perfectly-cast film stars the protagonists, Neil and Brian, played terrifically by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet, whose connected roots lie at the hands of their little league coach from years back... a man who sexually abused them both.The film follows both boys, particularly Neil, as he becomes a male prostitute and finds quick encounters without much effort. Neil eventually lands in New York, where his ""partners"" are available everywhere, and the sex is rougher and more demeaning. Brian, on the other hand, suffers his shame in relative silence. The final reunion of the two is both poignant and haunting.The real star of ""Mysterious Skin"" is Gordon-Levitt. He's come a long way from his ""3rd Rock from the Sun"" days and has developed into a persuasive and multi-talented actor. I hope we see more of him in the future. His performance in this film is riveting, and because of it, I highly recommend ""Mysterious Skin"".

933167,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000ATQYQU,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 5]","Movies about homosexuals, teenage hustlers, and child molesters have been being made for years. For some reason, they've suddenly surged in the past two years and became some of the most acclaimed films of the year. You've probably heard of movies like Brokeback Mountain and Transamerica, but here is another film...""Mysterious Skin."" It was one of the most acclaimed films of 2004 and proved furthermore that Joseph Gordon-Levitt can, in fact, act. I'm heterosexual, but when I heard about the movie...The premise sounded interesting. The film is interesting and contains great performances,disturbing scenes, and is (probably) one of the best films of 2004. In the beginning, we meet two kids. One is Brian, a fairly normal kid who lost 5 hours of his life before waking up in his cellar with a nosebleed. Brian thinks that he was abducted by aliens. The other kid is Neil, who is quite different from Brian. Neil, on his first day of little league baseball, sees his coach for the first time and via voice-over admits to having feelings for him right off the bat. We, the audience, sense the minute we see the coach where the story is going and we're right...Coach molests Neil and sets up the chain of events leading to the remainder of the film. 10 years later, Neil (Levitt) is a gay teenage hustler who longs to get out of the ""hick town"" he lives in. Brian (Brady Corbett, who played Evan Rachel Wood's brother in Thirteen) is obsessed with his ""abduction"" and is searching for what really happened that night. Elisabeth Shue (who looks as beautiful as she did in ""Leaving Las Vegas"") plays Neil's clueless mother and there's Brian's dad who is really a completely useless character. The movie is deeply disturbing, some of the scenes involving Neil and his johns hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm not sure if the writer/director of the film was trying to shroud Brian's ""abduction"" in mystery, but if he was...It didn't work. Before I even saw the film, I explained the synopsis to a friend who guessed what actually happened. It was the same thing I had thought, we were both right. The movie is entertaining and will keep your eyes glued to the screen, especially it's stars. Levitt has proved himself in this film, Manic, and Brick to be one of the best young (he's 27) actors around right now. Corbett proves talent as well, but barely holds his own against Levitt.

933171,A2VP5OOKKLLCPV,B000ATQYQU,"Julie Vognar ""Julie""","[4, 5]","But I have owned this movie for over two years, so I thought I should at least give some personal reactions(I don't think another rehash of the plot is necessary).The ""tagline"" (I think that means the line that appeared on many of the original posters) is ""One can't remember...and the other can't forget."" Not many have pointed out that in a sense, Neil (Gordon-Levitt) is just as stuck back there in the past as Brian (Corbet) is. Neil knew he was gay before ""Coach"" picked him out, and, in fact, thought of their relationship as a ""love affair,"" and the feeling he had for Coach as ""love."" When he starts hustling, he tries to pick men who are middle-aged (like Coach), a bit chunky (like Coach), and whom he can trust, as he trusted Coach. He has NO romance or love in his life, and no sex, except insofar as he gets sex from his johns (which considering that they do the paying, is a fair amount!). So while Brian (Corbet) has blocked the (one night stand--with Neil, the thing lasted all summer) out of his mind, substituted an alien abduction, and feels no sexual attraction for anyone, Neil's life is, in spite of its adventurousness, a certail sense of accomplishment,  and, eventully, brutality--just as stuck as Brian's is. So while Araki shw us the widely-veering away from eachother lives of the two sexually abused children, it's clear that that, in a sense, the abuse has stopped the emotional development of both.Their coming together, at the end, with Neil explaning to Brian what happened to him that night (which he has by now partially guessed), is a kind of a miracle, and we are left with a feeling of hope. Neil realizes what a destructive force Coach was, not only for Brian, but for him as well, and Brian accepts the reality of what happened to him, and (especially in the movie) seems to feel a real warmth for Neil.I tried for months to get my transgender friend to watch this movie, but as soon as I told him what it was about, he said, ""No. I don't want to see it."" He slowly chanaged his mind, and we finally did watch it together. He never laughed (not even when Neil is getting blown under the table while annuncing a local baseball game), and said Neil didn't do anything for him (considering our similarities in taste in other similar matters, I'm not quite sure I don't take this with a grain of salt). What impressed him most about the movie, aside from its exquisite direction and acting, was that ""neither of the two eight year old actors--or perhaps even younger--would have to know ANYTHING about what the movie as about."" That is absolutely true. (Of course, they may have learned about it from older friends; I don't know),. But watch it carefully. With seemless editing, what seems to be a violation, and what seems to be a seduction, of two small boys, never involves either boy directly (""Here we go."" But Coach's face moves toward the camera, not the 8-year-old Neil). Compare this to, for instance ""The Innocents,"" in which Miles has to kiss his governess full on the mouth, recite a morbid and suggestive poem, and says some fairly nasty thing to her.We never see any real sex; we never see an improper kiss (unless you count Eric's and Neils!). The language is way, way out there, and it leave no question as to what is going on, in words that I probably can't print here. For the viewer, this language makes every scene utterly real.Things and scenes i especially liked:the way Neil's mother ""doesn't know"" what he does for a living; yeah, I bet she doesn't!Avalen calls Brian out to her farm in the middkle of the night. There in the field lies a dead cow, drained of it's blood (aliens of course have done this, according to Avalen). It is slit up the center, and she urges him. ""Put your hand in!"" Eventually he does...and then, puts it in deeper, and deeper, until only his elbow shows. ""You didn't have to do THAT,"" says Avalen. Yes, he did.The rapist and batterer of Neil uses a bottle of Johnson's Baby Shampoo to hit him with (among other things),. It says ""No more tears"" on it.The way we follow Neil's thoghts in the final scene, as the camera pans up and up, until the two boys are little more than a speck on their couch. ""I wished I could tell him everything would be all right now, but I knew it wouldn't, so i didn't. I just tried to make him understand how sorry I was. I wished we could rise out of there, like two angels in the night..."" (Sorry, this is from memory; it's probably better in the film)....and I still like the blown baseball game.",5,I really think 113 reviews is enough!,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,4514,"['have', 'owned', 'movie', 'two', 'years', 'thought', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'personal', 'reactions', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'rehash', 'plot', 'necessary', '.The', 'tagline', 'think', 'line', 'appeared', 'many', 'original', 'posters', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Not', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'sense', 'Neil', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'just', 'stuck', 'back', 'there', 'past', 'Brian', 'Corbet', 'Neil', 'knew', 'was', 'gay', 'Coach', 'picked', 'out', 'fact', 'thought', 'relationship', 'love', 'affair', 'feeling', 'had', 'Coach', 'love', 'When', 'hustling', 'pick', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'middle-aged', 'Coach', 'bit', 'chunky', 'Coach', 'whom', 'can', 'trust', 'trusted', 'Coach', 'NO', 'romance', 'love', 'life', 'sex', 'except', 'insofar', 'sex', 'johns', 'considering', 'do', 'paying', 'fair', 'amount', 'So', 'Brian', 'Corbet', 'blocked', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Neil', 'thing', 'lasted', 'summer', 'mind', 'substituted', 'alien', 'abduction', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'anyone', 'Neil', 'life', 'spite', 'adventurousness', 'certail', 'sense', 'accomplishment', 'eventully', 'brutality', 'just', 'as', 'stuck', 'Brian', 'So', 'Araki', 'shw', 'widely-veering', 'away', 'eachother', 'lives', 'two', 'sexually', 'abused', 'children', 'clear', 'sense', 'abuse', 'stopped', 'emotional', 'development', 'both.Their', 'coming', 'together', 'end', 'Neil', 'explaning', 'Brian', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'now', 'partially', 'guessed', 'kind', 'miracle', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'hope', 'Neil', 'what', 'destructive', 'force', 'Coach', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'Brian', 'as', 'well', 'Brian', 'reality', 'what', 'happened', 'especially', 'movie', 'feel', 'real', 'warmth', 'Neil.I', 'tried', 'months', 'get', 'transgender', 'friend', 'watch', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'told', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'said', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'slowly', 'chanaged', 'mind', 'finally', 'did', 'watch', 'together', 'never', 'laughed', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'Neil', 'getting', 'blown', 'table', 'annuncing', 'local', 'baseball', 'game', 'said', 'Neil', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'considering', 'similarities', 'taste', 'other', 'similar', 'matters', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'grain', 'salt', 'What', 'impressed', 'most', 'movie', 'aside', 'exquisite', 'direction', 'acting', 'was', 'two', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'actors', 'perhaps', 'even', 'younger', 'would', 'have', 'know', 'ANYTHING', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'absolutely', 'true', 'course', 'may', 'have', 'learned', 'older', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'watch', 'carefully', 'seemless', 'editing', 'what', 'be', 'violation', 'what', 'be', 'seduction', 'two', 'small', 'boys', 'never', 'boy', 'directly', 'Here', 'go', 'Coach', 'face', 'camera', 'not', '8-year-old', 'Neil', 'Compare', 'instance', 'Innocents', 'Miles', 'kiss', 'governess', 'full', 'mouth', 'recite', 'morbid', 'suggestive', 'poem', 'fairly', 'nasty', 'thing', 'her.We', 'never', 'see', 'real', 'sex', 'never', 'see', 'improper', 'kiss', 'count', 'Eric', 'Neils', 'language', 'way', 'way', 'there', 'leave', 'question', 'what', 'going', 'words', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'print', 'here', 'viewer', 'language', 'scene', 'utterly', 'real.Things', 'scenes', 'i', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'Neil', 'mother', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'living', 'bet', ""n't"", 'Avalen', 'Brian', 'farm', 'middkle', 'night', 'field', 'dead', 'cow', 'drained', 'blood', 'aliens', 'course', 'have', 'done', 'according', 'Avalen', 'slit', 'up', 'center', 'Put', 'hand', 'Eventually', 'then', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'only', 'elbow', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'Avalen', 'Yes', 'rapist', 'batterer', 'Neil', 'bottle', 'Johnson', 'Baby', 'Shampoo', 'hit', 'other', 'things', 'No', 'more', 'tears', 'it.The', 'way', 'follow', 'Neil', 'thoghts', 'final', 'scene', 'camera', 'up', 'up', 'two', 'boys', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'speck', 'couch', 'wished', 'could', 'tell', 'everything', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'now', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'tried', 'make', 'understand', 'how', 'sorry', 'was', 'wished', 'could', 'rise', 'out', 'there', 'two', 'angels', 'night', 'Sorry', 'memory', 'probably', 'better', 'film', '.and', 'still', 'blown', 'baseball', 'game']",Mysterious Skin

As adults, one is a hustler, the other obssesed with UFO's and his childhood blackouts.  At the end the ""big secret"" about the nature of his blackouts is revealed....I bet you can already guess what it is.  Well, its no secret in the movie either, and the pretense of a secret or a mystery is laughable.  Its obvious.  So there's no real secret or mystery, what about the characters?  The two protaganists, beyond the fact that they were victimized, are not likeable.  One is a perp himself, the other is shallow, introverted, and withdrawn.  Yes, these are two basic routes that people take when dealing with this kind of abuse, but these characters are painted too broadly to be sympathetic.  Well then, what about the overall theme of abuse?  Is there anything redeeming or instructive for the viewer?  The answer is a resounding no.  What the film amounts to is watching two kids get abused, watch them act out in screwed up ways as adults, wrestle with the emotions, and ultimately, come to no insight or resolution themselves.  Nothing is stated about the ultimate fate of the abuser or the two victims.  So what's the point?  I'm not sure.  You do feel horrible for the two main characters, but beyond that, there IS no point.Now for the worst part.  Near the end of the movie, one of the characters describes in graphic detail exactly what was done to the boys.  Worse than that, he describes the events in weirdly gleeful terms.  As he describes it, we see the events acted out...not in detail, but still.  Now, I have no problem with this if it is to serve some greater artistic end.  Unfortunately, here it doesn't.  The only point I can see is perhaps if someone didn't realize that this type of sick stuff goes on, they may have some realizations.  I DO know that it goes on, I DON'T need to hear it described UNLESS it serves some greater purpose.This is very very potent and sensitive material, and in the right hands it can make for a powerful movie.  In this film, it has a disturbing hint of compassion exploitation.Let me just say finally that just before I watched this, I watched a film called Tarnation that touched on some of the same topics in a much much deeper way....",1,I beg to differ...,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,2301,"['guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'hype', 'about', 'story', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'sexually', 'abused', 'adults', 'one', 'hustler', 'other', 'obssesed', 'UFO', 'childhood', 'blackouts', 'end', 'big', 'secret', 'nature', 'blackouts', 'revealed', '.I', 'can', 'already', 'guess', 'what', 'Well', 'secret', 'movie', 'pretense', 'secret', 'mystery', 'laughable', 'obvious', 'real', 'secret', 'mystery', 'what', 'characters', 'two', 'protaganists', 'fact', 'were', 'victimized', 'are', 'not', 'likeable', 'One', 'perp', 'other', 'shallow', 'introverted', 'withdrawn', 'Yes', 'are', 'two', 'basic', 'routes', 'people', 'take', 'when', 'dealing', 'kind', 'abuse', 'characters', 'are', 'painted', 'too', 'broadly', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'Well', 'then', 'what', 'overall', 'theme', 'abuse', 'there', 'anything', 'redeeming', 'instructive', 'viewer', 'answer', 'resounding', 'What', 'film', 'amounts', 'watching', 'two', 'kids', 'get', 'abused', 'watch', 'act', 'out', 'screwed', 'up', 'ways', 'adults', 'wrestle', 'emotions', 'ultimately', 'come', 'insight', 'resolution', 'Nothing', 'stated', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'abuser', 'two', 'victims', 'what', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'do', 'feel', 'horrible', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'point.Now', 'worst', 'part', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'characters', 'describes', 'graphic', 'detail', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'boys', 'Worse', 'events', 'weirdly', 'gleeful', 'terms', 'see', 'events', 'acted', 'out', 'not', 'detail', 'still', 'Now', 'have', 'problem', 'serve', 'greater', 'artistic', 'end', 'Unfortunately', 'here', ""n't"", 'only', 'point', 'can', 'see', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'type', 'sick', 'stuff', 'may', 'have', 'realizations', 'DO', 'know', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'need', 'hear', 'described', 'greater', 'purpose.This', 'very', 'very', 'potent', 'sensitive', 'material', 'right', 'hands', 'can', 'make', 'powerful', 'movie', 'film', 'disturbing', 'hint', 'compassion', 'exploitation.Let', 'just', 'say', 'finally', 'just', 'watched', 'watched', 'film', 'called', 'Tarnation', 'touched', 'same', 'topics', 'much', 'much', 'deeper', 'way']",Mysterious Skin
933174,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B000ATQYQU,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[18, 21]","Ever wonder how two very different people might view a shared experience? This film explores that issue as well as many others, focusing on two boys and the effects of a shared experience which continues to haunt them as they go from boyhood into their teens.One of the boys believes the experience was wonderful, even a wish fulfillment of sorts while the other goes into total denial..with devestating results.Based on a noted book, the film stands on its own although it was a rougher experience for me, more ""real"", since the visuals were so detailed, so hard to watch (at times).

933176,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000ATQYQU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 6]","Unintentionally, I have a long history with ""Mysterious Skin.""  Upon the release of Scott Heim's debut novel in 1996, I purchased and read the book because I liked the plot description on the back cover.  Remember the day when one might actually browse in a book store?  In 2004, while living in Los Angeles, I trekked across the city to see the well-reviewed indie film having no idea that it was connected to a book I had read many years prior.  Of course, it is such a stunningly unique and memorable story, I quickly put the pieces together as the movie unfolded on the screen.  Filmmaker Gregg Araki has made some bold movies (The Doom Generation, The Living End) in his career, but (for my money) ""Mysterious Skin"" is his mini-masterpiece.  I don't use the word lightly and/or often, but this little film captures some incredibly big ideas very effectively.  A study of small town life, burgeoning sexuality, alien counter-culture, and the after effects of abuse, the weighty subject matter could have developed into a project of overstated self-importance.  Instead, it is a pitch perfect balance of tones and themes.  From laugh-out-loud moments to sequences of heart-rending emotional catharsis, its haunting final image has never left my mind.When I heard about a new Director's Special Tenth Anniversary Blu-ray, I simply had to have it!  Truthfully, the picture and sound quality aren't markedly improved from prior releases (this is a low budget indie) for the Blu-ray, but the plethora of additional Bonus Features are well worth investing in.  As I sat down to re-watch ""Mysterious Skin,"" I found it even better than I remembered.  I know the film has grown in popularity over ten years, especially as Joseph Gordon-Levitt's star has risen, but it still deserves an even wider audience.  I'll discuss the movie only briefly, but let me address the bonus features for those who are thinking of an upgrade.  One thing is clear, those involved in the project still look at it quite fondly!Features Carried Over:Commentary Track with Araki, Gordon-Levitt and Brady CorbetDeleted Scenes (not much to speak of)Audition Tapes (fascinating--my favorite Bonus Feature new or old)A Segment at a Book ReadingNew Features:Introduction by Araki (a two minute thank-you, essentially)Brady Corbet and Gordon-Levitt at Sundance in 2014.  (Glad to see Gordon-Levitt still be accessible to promoting the film!  He acknowledges how it made his career trajectory possible).Novelist Heim in a contemporary interviewNew Script Galleries, Stills, and Isolated TracksThere are certain actors that I will follow on faith, and through the years Joseph Gordon-Levitt has become one of those people. He has managed his career with precision, bouncing between indie and mainstream fare as well as lead and supporting roles. I always appreciate a young actor who is willing to take chances, to pick roles and movies that they're passionate about or that might challenge them. Gordon-Levitt rose to the top of his generation with an eclectic bounty of great performances in oddball films including Brick and The Lookout, but ""Mysterious Skin"" was a defining role in his oeuvre.  He plays a young hustler in small town Kansas.  Emotionally aloof, he embarks on dangerous assignations and longs for something grander (even if he lacks much forward momentum).  Brady Corbet (very good in the recent Simon Killer) plays a neighboring teen plagued by a social awkwardness and an obsession with alien abduction.  Having experienced black-outs in his youth, he seeks an explanation for the demons that still haunt him.  The two boys played on a little league baseball team together and past experiences will bring the young men together as Corbet seeks out Gordon-Levitt to supply some of the missing answers.  The actors share limited screen time, but the final sequence is dazzling in its sincerity.  The movie provides most of the answers you need to the mystery from its opening scenes, but the revelations are still incredibly impactful.  A great character study that is also quite funny, the movie also has nice turns by Elisabeth Shue (as Gordon-Levitt's mother), Michelle Trachtenberg, and 24's Mary Lynn Rajskub.  One of my favorites.  Discover (or re-discover) it for yourself.

And he didn't even ""look"" gay, like his flaming friend Eric.This rendition of the man-boy sexual abuse theme highlights the differing (though both pathetic) responses of two different boys.  It also distinguishes between two approaches of the male-on-male pedophile: the ""grooming"" and seduction of Neil versus the one-off (or maybe two, counting that Halloween) rape of Brian.  Survivors of childhood abuse will recognize many elements of Brian's experiences: the fragmentary and peripheral recollections (e.g., blue porch light), the nose-bleeds and fainting years after the fact, the desperate preoccupation with improbable, fabricated ""screen memories"" like the UFO abduction, and the absence of resolution at the end of the film. Finally, let me add: (1) Survivors should not watch this film unless they are VERY stable.  (2) Some viewers may find a few of the rent-boy sex scenes a bit repulsive.

933180,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000ATQYQU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 12]","When Brian was eight years old, five hours of his life disappeared.  One minute he was at a Little League baseball game somewhere in the middle of Kansas, and the next thing he knew his sister found him hiding in the basement with his nose bleeding.  By the time he is a teenager, Brian is convinced that he was the victim of an alien abduction.  He even has a clear memory of a flying saucer passing over his house, but the becomes consumed by dreams that may unlock the secret of what happened during those missing hours.  Eventually he remembers another kid being there that night.  That would be Neil, who was the star of the Little League team, while Brian was the worst player.  Dazzled by his coach (Bill Sage), Neil ends up going home with him after a game one day and after being seduced with video games and cereal, is sexually molested.  This situation continues throughout the summer.The tagline for this 2005 film says that one boy cannot remember, while the other cannot forget.  The truth does not become clear for Brian (Brady Corbet) until he finally meets up with Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) again, but we end up putting the pieces together early on in this one.  Gregg Araki (""Nowhere"") adapted Scott Heim's novel and directed the film, and the result is an unsettling film about child abuse.  To be clear, you no more see any actual child abuse in ""Mysterious Skin"" any more than you see Janet Leigh get murdered in the shower scene in ""Psycho,"" but Araki films and cuts these scenes so that you are convinced that what you are not seeing is right beyond the frame of the camera.  It is not gratuitous to say that Araki gets right in the face of his characters, which means he gets right in our faces as well, so do not be surprised if you feel compelled to stop the film from time to time because it gets intense.""Mysterious Skin"" is about what happens to the victims of pedophilia, and in that regard it takes its two characters to the extremes.  Brian remembers nothing, but is subject to nightmares and blackouts, and when a woman expresses a sexual interest in him he freaks, knowing none of the reasons for any of these aberrant behaviors.  But it is Neil who is the central character of the narrative because he not only remembers what happens, his psyche is defined by it and he is recklessly seeks opportunities to repeat the experience.  Having learned to please an older man, that becomes Neil's sexual identity, and if that means selling himself to every man in town two times over, then that is what he will do.  When they becomes boredom for him, Neil heads for the big city, oblivious to the warnings of what can happen there by his friend Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg), who knows he has a bottomless black hole where other people have a heart.  Neil tells her everything, so she knows why, but she is not the one who gets to make it clear to him as to why the last ten years have been a descent into the abyss.This is a disheartening film because it documents the damage down to these two boys without a hint of what is to be done about it.  Gordon-Levitt deserves the same sort of accolades that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal received for ""Brokeback Mountain,"" but those were not forthcoming because ""Mysterious Skin"" is not about the love that dares not speak its name.  It is not any type of love at all.  These two characters learn how they are linked together forever because of what was done to them and that their lives are ruined because of it.  In the end they do not learn that there is a light at the end of the tunnel; they simply that they are in the tunnel and why it is that the light has gone out from their lives.",5,An intensely painful look at two victims of pedophilia,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,3669,"['When', 'Brian', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'five', 'hours', 'life', 'disappeared', 'One', 'minute', 'was', 'Little', 'League', 'baseball', 'game', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Kansas', 'next', 'thing', 'knew', 'sister', 'found', 'hiding', 'basement', 'nose', 'bleeding', 'time', 'teenager', 'Brian', 'convinced', 'was', 'victim', 'alien', 'abduction', 'even', 'clear', 'memory', 'flying', 'saucer', 'passing', 'house', 'becomes', 'consumed', 'dreams', 'may', 'unlock', 'secret', 'what', 'happened', 'missing', 'hours', 'Eventually', 'kid', 'being', 'night', 'would', 'be', 'Neil', 'who', 'was', 'star', 'Little', 'League', 'team', 'Brian', 'was', 'worst', 'player', 'Dazzled', 'coach', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'Neil', 'up', 'going', 'home', 'game', 'one', 'day', 'being', 'seduced', 'video', 'games', 'cereal', 'sexually', 'molested', 'situation', 'summer.The', 'tagline', '2005', 'film', 'one', 'boy', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'other', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'truth', 'not', 'become', 'clear', 'Brian', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'finally', 'up', 'Neil', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'again', 'end', 'up', 'putting', 'pieces', 'together', 'early', 'one', 'Gregg', 'Araki', 'Nowhere', 'adapted', 'Scott', 'Heim', 'novel', 'directed', 'film', 'result', 'unsettling', 'film', 'child', 'abuse', 'be', 'clear', 'more', 'see', 'actual', 'child', 'abuse', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'more', 'see', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'get', 'murdered', 'shower', 'scene', 'Psycho', 'Araki', 'films', 'cuts', 'scenes', 'so', 'are', 'convinced', 'what', 'are', 'not', 'seeing', 'right', 'frame', 'camera', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'say', 'Araki', 'right', 'face', 'characters', 'right', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'feel', 'compelled', 'stop', 'film', 'time', 'time', 'intense', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'what', 'victims', 'pedophilia', 'regard', 'two', 'characters', 'extremes', 'Brian', 'remembers', 'nothing', 'subject', 'nightmares', 'blackouts', 'when', 'woman', 'sexual', 'interest', 'knowing', 'none', 'reasons', 'aberrant', 'behaviors', 'Neil', 'who', 'central', 'character', 'narrative', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'psyche', 'defined', 'recklessly', 'seeks', 'opportunities', 'repeat', 'experience', 'Having', 'learned', 'please', 'older', 'man', 'Neil', 'sexual', 'identity', 'selling', 'man', 'town', 'two', 'times', 'then', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'When', 'becomes', 'boredom', 'Neil', 'heads', 'big', 'city', 'oblivious', 'warnings', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'there', 'friend', 'Wendy', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'who', 'bottomless', 'black', 'hole', 'where', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'heart', 'Neil', 'everything', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'make', 'clear', 'why', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'descent', 'abyss.This', 'disheartening', 'film', 'documents', 'damage', 'down', 'two', 'boys', 'hint', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'same', 'sort', 'accolades', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'received', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'were', 'not', 'forthcoming', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'not', 'love', 'not', 'speak', 'name', 'not', 'type', 'love', 'two', 'characters', 'learn', 'how', 'are', 'linked', 'together', 'forever', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'lives', 'are', 'ruined', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'simply', 'are', 'tunnel', 'why', 'light', 'gone', 'out', 'lives']",Mysterious Skin

933182,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000ATQYQU,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","""Mysterious Skin"" was adapted for screenplay by director Gregg Araki from Scott Heim's novel.  Araki's reputation for bold films continues with this tale.  Araki was nominated for Best Director for the film by the Independent Spirit Awards.  He won the same type of award from the Seattle International Film Festival (Golden Space Needle Award), from the Rotterdam International Film Festival (MovieZone Award), from the Bergen International Film Festival (Jury Award) and from the Brisbane International Film Festival (Interfaith Award).  I found the theme of child abuse made this a very difficult film for me to watch.  The performances and the film's final frames made it rewarding.Two child actors do excellent jobs in the film.  The wide-eyed George Webster who plays young Brian and Chase Ellison as young Neil who recently filmed with Julia Roberts in ""Fireflies in the Garden"" both do excellent jobs, despite the difficult context of their performances.Brady Corbett who has been on TV's ""24,"" plays young blond Brian who has blotted out the memory and ""loses time,"" even though he is haunted by it.The film, however, belongs to Joseph Gordon-Levitt who did such a great job inStop-Lossand was from TV's ""Third Rock from the Sun.""  He was nominated for ""Beakthrough Award"" by the Gotham Awards and won a Best Actor award from the Seattle Film Festival for this film.  As the teenage Neil, Joseph plays with great distrust to the world.  He is harsh and angry.The most difficult to watch was Bill Sage as the baseball coach who takes advantage and abuses the children.  My reaction is that anyone who takes advantage of child in this way deserves capital punishment.  That said, Sage's good looks and pleasing smile spin a web in which these children fall due to parental neglect.Brian's parents are played by Lisa Long who has worked on many TV shows including ""Desperate Housewives,"" ""Eli Stone"" and ""Dharma & Greg.""  Chris Mulkey who was inNorth Country (Widescreen Edition)and works frequently on TV always has this look like he could flip you off or swear at you given the least provocation.  While he may be the greatest guy in real life, he excels at these roles.  Elisabeth Shue who was nominated for an Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" in 1996 plays Neil's single mother who is as centered on her social life as she is on her son's.Jeffrey Licon plays Eric, Neil's best friend & eventually Brian's.  His flamboyant hair & makeup make him a standout in this small-town setting.  Some may recall him playing the Goth Kid God on TV's ""Joan of Arcadia.""  His role in the film is interesting, although one wonders at his unrequited love for Neil.  Perhaps his function in the film is to show how much Neil toughens up during his sojourn in New York.Three supporting roles should also be recognized.  Michelle Trachtenberg from TV's ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" & who won a special Jury Prize for Breakthrough Performance from the Sarasota (I think that's right) Film Festival forBeautiful Ohiodoes a good job as the flamboyant Wendy who moves to New York City and brings Neil there.  Mary Lynn Rajskub who plays on TV's ""24"" and appeared inLittle Miss Sunshineplays Avalyn Friesen who is on crutches and believes she was abducted by space aliens.  Of the guys who patronize Neil's personal business, the best performance is by Billy Drago as the AIDS-infected Zeke.  Drago often plays creepy characters, but this is one creepy guy who displays his bliss.  It was a weird mix, but a memorable performance.  (I hope that was makeup on his yellow teeth!)""Mysterious Skin"" is a difficult but powerful film.  It repels even as it fascinates.  While I'm returning it the day after I watched it because I want it out of my house, it was an excellent film to watch.  The strange DVD extra where the two leading young men read excerpts from the novel point out to me how valuable a class in Oral Interpretation can be.  Overall, this film was an excellent achievement.

Moore,"[6, 7]","Gregg Araki's ""Mysterious Skin,"" based on a novel by Scott Heim, is a film that is extremely difficult to watch in places, but those who stick with it will be rewarded with one of the most powerful endings of any film in recent memory. The protagonists are Brian and Neil, two eight-year-old boys who are teammates--though not friends--on a Little League team in their small Kansas town. Ten years later, the shy, immature Brian (Brady Corbet) is convinced that he was abducted by aliens during the summer he was on the team; meanwhile, Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has become an icy, closed-off New York street hustler, openly admitting he was the sex slave of the team's coach, turning tricks in the vain hope of recapturing what he had that summer. The sci-fi mystery aspect of the plot is dispensed with quickly. It becomes obvious in the first half-hour what really happened to Brian; the real suspense lies in when Brian and Neil will finally meet again, and what will happen when they do. That meeting comprises the film's final scenes, and it will twist your heartstrings into knots. In the end, this isn't even so much a film about pedophilia as it is an indictment of a society that carelessly chews up and spits out children. Brian and Neil aren't the only victims on display here; Avelyn (Mary Lynn Rajskub), the handicapped young woman who shares with Brian the belief that she was kidnapped by aliens, is if anything even more pathetic than he (the film doesn't spell out what really happened to her, but it's all too easy to guess). Neil's friends Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Eric (Jeffrey Licon) are also sad cases in their own way, unwanted and unappreciated. All of these performers are superb, especially Gordon-Levitt, who gives as Neil one of the great tragic performances of the modern cinema. There are scenes in this film--particularly one toward the end between Neil and a sadistic john--that are harrowing almost beyond belief. But if you can come through them, you will be filled with admiration for Araki for making a film of such unflinching honesty and power, and with love for the sad, brutalized teenagers he portrays. Steve Gainer is the cinematographer, his camera brilliant and insinuating. The extras on this DVD include Corbet and Gordon-Levitt, as themselves, reading sections from Heim's novel. It doesn't really enhance our understanding of the film, but it's a blessed relief to see the happy, healthy young actors on screen.",5,A film of incredible poignancy and power.,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,2471,"['Gregg', 'Araki', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'based', 'novel', 'Scott', 'Heim', 'film', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'watch', 'places', 'who', 'stick', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'endings', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'protagonists', 'are', 'Brian', 'Neil', 'two', 'eight-year-old', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'teammates', 'not', 'friends', 'Little', 'League', 'team', 'small', 'Kansas', 'town', 'Ten', 'years', 'later', 'shy', 'immature', 'Brian', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'convinced', 'was', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'summer', 'was', 'team', 'meanwhile', 'Neil', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'become', 'icy', 'closed-off', 'New', 'York', 'street', 'hustler', 'openly', 'admitting', 'was', 'sex', 'slave', 'team', 'coach', 'turning', 'tricks', 'vain', 'hope', 'recapturing', 'what', 'had', 'summer', 'sci-fi', 'mystery', 'aspect', 'plot', 'dispensed', 'quickly', 'obvious', 'first', 'half-hour', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Brian', 'real', 'suspense', 'when', 'Brian', 'Neil', 'will', 'finally', 'meet', 'again', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'do', 'meeting', 'film', 'final', 'scenes', 'will', 'twist', 'heartstrings', 'knots', 'end', ""n't"", 'even', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'about', 'pedophilia', 'indictment', 'society', 'carelessly', 'up', 'out', 'children', 'Brian', 'Neil', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'victims', 'display', 'here', 'Avelyn', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'handicapped', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'shares', 'Brian', 'belief', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'aliens', 'anything', 'even', 'more', 'pathetic', 'film', ""n't"", 'spell', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'too', 'easy', 'guess', 'Neil', 'friends', 'Wendy', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Eric', 'Jeffrey', 'Licon', 'are', 'also', 'sad', 'cases', 'own', 'way', 'unwanted', 'unappreciated', 'performers', 'are', 'superb', 'especially', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'Neil', 'one', 'great', 'tragic', 'performances', 'modern', 'cinema', 'are', 'scenes', 'film', 'particularly', 'one', 'end', 'Neil', 'sadistic', 'john', 'are', 'harrowing', 'almost', 'belief', 'can', 'come', 'will', 'be', 'filled', 'admiration', 'Araki', 'making', 'film', 'such', 'unflinching', 'honesty', 'power', 'love', 'sad', 'brutalized', 'teenagers', 'Steve', 'Gainer', 'cinematographer', 'camera', 'brilliant', 'insinuating', 'extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'Corbet', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'reading', 'sections', 'Heim', 'novel', ""n't"", 'really', 'enhance', 'understanding', 'film', 'blessed', 'relief', 'see', 'happy', 'healthy', 'young', 'actors', 'screen']",Mysterious Skin
933190,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000ATQYQU,mirasreviews,"[9, 25]","""Mysterious Skin"" was adapted by director Gregg Araki from Scott Heim's novel about the aftermath of childhood sexual abuse. The story is recounted in the first person by 2 young men who shared a fateful experience as children but  have led disparate lives since then. Neil McCormick (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a hustler, a prostitute, who drinks too much, drugs too much, and is generally goal-less, though self-possessed and charismatic.  Brian Lackey (Brady Corbett) is a kind of semi-reclusive social misfit who experiences frequent blackouts and is preoccupied with discovering what happened to him during 2 episodes of ""missing time"" in his childhood, which he is inclined to attribute to alien abduction. The story begins in 1981 when Neil and Brian were 8 years old and members of the same Little League team, whose studly coach (Bill Sage) was the object of precocious Neil's childhood crush, and picks up in 1991, when the two 18-year-olds are struggling with their past and trying to  make a future.I suppose ""Mysterious Skin"" is intended to be a character drama and a lesson in the long-term consequences of sexual abuse, which manifest themselves differently in these 2 different personalities. But I'm not buying it. The film's pace is unbearably slow, and it is emotionally flat until the end, at which point it shifts gear into melodrama. But the biggest problem is that Neil's storyline is credible while Brian's is not. Brian has repressed memories of 2 events from his childhood. But repressed memories are very rare and occur only in cases of trauma repeated many times. Brian's memory apparently disappeared after only one event. And he has psychosomatic blackouts and nosebleeds for a decade because of it. Preposterous. If someone blacks out all the time, there is a physical reason for it. Brian's psychology is pure fantasy.And Brian's storyline is plagued by sloppiness. We see the UFO that he believes abducted him -which was not in the book- yet it's not supposed to be real. I believe director Gregg Araki is implying that another woman who claims to have been abducted by aliens, Avalyn (Mary Lynn Rajskub), was also the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of her father. But, if this is so, why did her ""missing time"" incident occur when she was in a car with her grandparents? The friendship that develops between Neil's flamboyant friend Eric (Jeff Licon) and Brian would never happen. Neil's statements at the film's conclusion come out of nowhere. They're out of character. ""Mysterious Skin""`s characters don't act organically. Their behavior doesn't follow a reasonable progression. This might have been an interesting film had it been solely about Neil. He has a strong personality, which Joseph Gordon-Levitt conveys with a certain charisma. The film's best scenes are those between the pedophile coach and clever, egotistical 8-year-old Neil. Hats off to both of these actors, Bill Sage and young Chase Ellison. But the whole Brian storyline is sloppy nonsense.The DVD (TLA 2005): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (2 min), a ""Book Reading with Brady Corbet and Joseph Gordon-Levitt"" (1 hour), in which the actors read sections about their characters from the novel, and an audio commentary with director Gregg Araki and actors Brady Corbet and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in which they recount some filming anecdotes and Araki talks about the film's visual style, the actors, and the characters. Araki does most of the talking in the commentary. My DVD had some menu problems: I could get to the set-up menu, which contains the commentary, before viewing the film but not after. I had to remove the disc from the machine, turn it off, and reload the disc to get the set-up menu option to work again. There is also no way to navigate to the Scene Menu once you've left the Main Menu. Try hitting ""Top Menu"" on your remote. Subtitles are available for the film in English.",3,Two Storylines.

933191,A2IDH9KN7OBGJW,B000ATQYQU,"Movie Buff ""patrickcat""","[5, 7]","I bought this movie based on the reviews I heard on LOGO.  One critic went as far as to say it was superior to Brokeback Mountain.  So as I sat down to watch this movie I quickly realized the subject matter.  Child abuse.  I was quickly turned off by the attitude of the character Neil played by Jason Gordon-Levitt.  The movie is about two boys who have a similar experience of being molested by the same man, their little league coach.  Neil goes on to turn tricks with men as a teen and Brian forgets those few hours of his life and now thinks he forgot because he was abducted by aliens.  Brian begins his search for Neil thinking he may be the key to learning about his alien abduction.  These are two completely different characters.  Neil who is self destructive, going with men despite the warning of his friend to be safe.  Brian the more innocent and gullible boy just trying to find his way.  When they finally meet and Neil explains what happened, I was completely taken in by the movie.  As far as 1/2 way through the movie I was thinking to myself, why am I watching this.

They are the main characters of the movie, Brian and Neil, who have an emotional journey to contend with.When Brian's story begins, it is fragmented, both by his painful memory loss and the editing.  He doesn't know what's going on, but he feels it has something in particular to do with UFOs, and starts hunting down information on his repressed memories.  Neil's story is much more stable... at first.  His is an accepting and nonconfrontational viewpoint into the world of homosexuality and prostitution, yet strangely surrounded by artwork: Pollack, Rothko, Vermeer, etc. As Brian's story progresses, his life will begin to fall into a bit more order, while as Neil's story progresses, it's going to get more messy and off-kilter.The ""mystery"" designation on the genre of this film is a bit of a misrepresentation: it really doesn't take long for the audience to understand what happened to both of them.  However, rather than watching it for any kind of twist, it's much more inspiring to watch this movie with sympathy, because for some reason I can't quite understand, every character in this movie is amazingly sympathetic.  The two main boys' emotional takes on life keeps the movie flowing wonderfully while the supporting characters' additions keep it from becoming too static.  Sometimes there's an aura of inevitability, but mostly throughout the movie the real surprises come from trying to figure out where the characters will go next in such a bizarre landscape.The cinematography is wonderful.  The composition of the shots almost always perfectly fit the internal musings of the characters, and things are left just enough confusing when confusing and revealed when revealed that the audience is almost always on perfect equal ground with the characters. The acting supports it well.  I didn't even really see actors, I pretty much accepted the characters as who I was actually watching, Neil and Brian.Finally, the soundtrack is pretty good and keeps the tone of the movie under control.

All of these scenes concern Brian (Thirteen's Brady Corbet)'s relationship with Avalyn Friesen (Mary Lynn Rajskub of 24). Every time she appeared on the screen, I couldn't help but think ""this is the conception of `grossly overweight' [as she's described in the book] in California?"" That alone was enough to throw off my enjoyment of the film; the feeling was exacerbated by a number of small changes, the kind of thing I'd normally assume was done to preserve the film's R rating, but with more involved in each case. (For example, the lovely scene in the novel where Neal (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his mother (Elisabeth Shue), and Eric (Jeff Licon) go picnicking the day before Neal leaves for New York is torn to shreds; the portion of it that might have messed with the film's rating is there, in abbreviated, almost prudish, form, but all the rest of the scene has been dispensed with.)Not a terrible movie, but do yourself a favor: see it before you read the book, so you don't know what you're missing until afterwards. ** ",3,"Decent film, but bad adaptation.",1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,1233,"['Mysterious', 'Skin', 'Gregg', 'Araki', '2004', 'good', 'deal', 'problem', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'set', 'scenes', 'Gregg', 'Araki', 'adaptation', 'Scott', 'Heim', 'intriguing', 'novel', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'scenes', 'concern', 'Brian', 'Thirteen', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'relationship', 'Avalyn', 'Friesen', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', '24', 'Every', 'time', 'appeared', 'screen', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'conception', 'grossly', 'overweight', '[', 'described', 'book', ']', 'California', 'alone', 'was', 'enough', 'throw', 'off', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'feeling', 'was', 'exacerbated', 'number', 'small', 'changes', 'kind', 'thing', ""'d"", 'normally', 'assume', 'was', 'done', 'preserve', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'more', 'involved', 'case', 'example', 'lovely', 'scene', 'novel', 'where', 'Neal', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'mother', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Eric', 'Jeff', 'Licon', 'go', 'picnicking', 'day', 'Neal', 'New', 'York', 'torn', 'shreds', 'portion', 'might', 'have', 'messed', 'film', 'rating', 'there', 'abbreviated', 'almost', 'prudish', 'form', 'rest', 'scene', 'been', 'dispensed', 'Not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'do', 'favor', 'see', 'read', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'afterwards', '**']",Mysterious Skin
933199,A224BKBLXVA859,B000ATQYQU,Rocky Sunico,"[0, 0]","Elephant in the room - there's no getting around the fact that child abuse is sort of front and center in this particular story. Neil is sexually abused at the age of 8 and those scenes may be a little uncomfortable to watch for anyone. It's interesting to note that the movie was filmed in a clever manner that isolated the child actors and kept them in the dark about the abuse aspect of their character roles. And this aspect to things is hardly a tasteless depiction of the whole thing. If anything, the whole movie acts as sort of a demonstration (or perhaps an analysis?) of the effects of child abuse long into adulthood. Neil's character has a particularly shady life all because of that first instance of exploitation.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is pretty brilliant in this movie and he's a character that you feel for even if you don't necessarily approve of his life choices. In the larger scheme of things, it's clear to us as viewers why his life has turned out the way it did starting with the abuse and including his somewhat distant mother. But this movie wouldn't have been the same had Levitt not been involved to share his unique brand of emotional intensity to the production.When you look at the whole production, Araki's often quirky style seemed a bit muted here, but in a good way. When he's given source material to adhere too, his style actually turns into something that is amazingly complex and rather involving. This is not to say his other movies aren't complex - if anything they tend to go a little overboard right into complicated and confusing. So this was definitely one of his better movies, at least in my opinion.The rest of the cast was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. That may be because of the way they were written or perhaps everyone just paled in comparison to Levitt. To be fair, they may not have had the chance to really shine given how much screen time the character of Neil gets throughout the movie. There's no doubt who the primary protagonist is despite the counter point of Brian's story. If anything, I think that side of things could have been developed a wee bit more.This is a rather short review, but there's not much else to say beyond this: it's an intelligent, well-performed movie that has a strong message to deliver.

933200,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000ATQYQU,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 9]","A must-see masterpiece, ""Mysterious Skin"" is Gregg Araki's brave, brilliant and soul-shattering film about that touchiest of all subjects - pedophilia.  Based on the novel by Scott Heim, ""Mysterious Skin"" is brutally frank and honest in its approach to the topic, forcing us to face the issue head-on without comforting filters and without concern for offending audience sensibilities.  Yet, it is a supremely humane film, illuminating the darkest corners of its characters' psyches in an effort to help us better come to terms with the devastating consequences of this sadly all-too-common tragedy.Set in a small town in Kansas in the early 1980's, the story focuses on two seemingly unrelated youngsters:  Neil, who knows he's gay at a very young age and turns to male prostitution at the age of 15, and Brian, who starts experiencing strange, unaccounted-for ""blackouts,"" which he naively attributes to his being abducted by UFOs.  But the boys share a far more sinister past, inextricably linked together by a molestation experience that continues to haunt them and that has marked and scarred them in radically different ways.Because of its refusal to flinch at or turn away from the sordid reality of its subject matter, ""Mysterious Skin"" is not a film everybody will be able to sit through.  It is ugly and harsh and almost impossible to watch at times, for there is no denying that what it shows us is deeply and profoundly disturbing and that it disgusts and offends us - as indeed it should - at the very core of our beings as humans.  Yet this is no cheesy exploitation film, but rather a heartfelt and compassionate work of art that makes us see the horror of the situation in a truly empathetic way.  We come to care very deeply for these boys as we are forced to see what it is they're going through and to share in their pain.Moreover, Heim and Araki have populated their world with unforgettable characters, all beautifully enacted by first rate performers: Michelle Trachtenberg as Neil's closest friend, Wendy, the one anchor of support Neil can count on to always be there for him even in his darkest moments; Jeffrey Licon as Eric, a gay teen with a warm heart whose unrequited love for Neil provides some of the most touching moments of the film; Mary Lynn Rajskub as a sad and lonely young woman also convinced that she has been abducted by aliens and who reaches out to Brian in love and friendship; Elizabeth Shue as Neil's well-meaning but tragically self-centered mother whose carelessness in leaving Neil alone with his coach is the catalyst that gets the tragedy rolling; and Bill Sage, in a very brave turn  as the coach himself,  whose actions have far-reaching consequences for both the boys involved.  Without exception, all these actors, including the ones playing Neil and Brian  as children, turn in mesmerizing, stellar performances.But the real acting honors go to Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet, two extraordinary young men who, as Neil and Brian, make a tremendous mark on our hearts.  Gordon-Levitt, in particular, is phenomenal in capturing the many moods of his character, beautifully conveying the sweet innocence that lies so deeply buried under a harsh, unemotional exterior that even his closest friends have a hard time locating it.  Corbet is also terrific as the nerdish Brian, a good-natured lad who slowly but surely comes to remember and understand the devastating event that has shaped and defined his life.The movie shows how, in Neil's case, the early childhood experience has made it impossible for him to view sex as anything but a ""business transaction,"" thus explaining his turn towards prostitution.  He acts out his anger and confusion by indulging in self-destructive behaviors and by shutting himself off from any kind of rich emotional attachments with anyone other than his platonic friend Wendy.  Brian, for his part, has responded by becoming, essentially, asexual, a means of subconsciously recoiling from the personal violation that occurred to him as a child and of avoiding having it ever happen to him again.  Their final scene together, in which long-festering wounds are at last opened and the ""healing"" begun, is devastating and unforgettable in its power and intensity.For, despite the darkness of the subject matter, ""Mysterious Skin"" is, finally, an optimistic, hopeful film, one that acknowledges the power of self-acceptance in making a fractured person whole again.  Beautifully written and directed by Araki, ""Mysterious Skin"" provides a heartbreaking experience that will burrow its way into the deepest recesses of your heart and stay with you for a very long time.  It is one of the few truly great films of the past several years, a complete work of art.

Without them, the viewer would not have seen how jaded, matter of fact, and even nonchalant one character was about the molestation's impact on his life. There would have been no mirror of the two boys' past and present experiences either. But I can't explain that without having a spoiler.This would be a wonderful movie for discussion.

Black,"[4, 4]","'Mysterious Skin' definitely tackles a wallop of a subject, and in doing so, it fearlessly portaits an utterly heart-breaking, though moving, and quiete often disturbing story that is ultimately powerful, and yes, mysterious.The story is about two 18 year old boys, Neil and Brian, who were victims of sexual abuse 10 years ago by their little league coach (Bill Sage). The film focuses on each boy as Brian desperately tries to remember what happened to him while the other, Neil, can't forget. In Brian's search for answers, he comes across Neil in a group picture from their little league team whom he believes has the answer to what Brian calls his ""lost time"".Directed by Greg Araki (who also adapted it from Scott Heim's novel of the same name), I expected something pretty sensational, even exploitative considering Araki's previous work. However, I was extremely impressed to see that Araki's direction and writing had really matured. The film was focused, complete, and controlled. In other words, it felt like I was watching something a vetran filmmaker had directed which is quite an accomplishment. Even with a small budget, the film never felt cheap or badly made. Araki uses many interesting camera tricks and placement that really make the film feel fresh and new.The acting, especially from the film's two leads, is fantastic! Joseph Gorden-Levitt really proves he has some serious acting chops. Brady Corbet is equally wonderful but this is Levitt's moment. The suppoting cast is also great and, well, supportive.It's no surprise that in dealing with this tough subject matter that the view will experience some difficult scenes to digest. However, rest assured, none are exploitative nor are they sensationalized. They are delt very delicately with and are there for a purpose. In fact, many of the unsettling scenes are remarkably powerful and leave the viewer an indelible impression.

For the sexually precocious Neil, it's a sexual awakening, setting him on the path to becoming a gay hustler and a life of such emotional numbness that he looks back on Coach as his ""one true love"".  For Brian, it's a hellish experience his brain all but erases with 5 hours of lost time, leaving him shy, remote, unable to engage romantically with anyone, and floundering through adolescence struggling to make sense of what happened to him.  It's only when he finally reconnects with Neil after a decade of searching that all the pieces finally fall into place... Gregg Araki's significant achievement here is to make a movie that is as moving as it is pitiless in the depiction of abuse and its consequences.  The writing is crisp, the performances brave and convincing (Joseph Gordon-Levitt especially), and it's so brilliantly structured and edited that the only time any abuse is actually ""seen"" is in the minds of the audience during the moving final confessional sequence.  It's hard to believe that this bold and tender film could be criticised for its masterful handling of a difficult subject, yet it aroused the ire of ludicrously conservative film and literature classification bodies here in Australia.  Members were apparently alarmed that it might be used as some kind of training video for paedophiles in how to ""groom"" their victims.

The first time I watched this film, I was blown away by the display of raw emotions of the two young lead actors- Joseph Gordon Levitt (who plays young hustler Neil McCormick) and Brady Corbet ( who plays Brian, the shy teen who believes he was abducted by Aliens). There is a special, albeit disturbing connection between the two young men and the film captures the journey towards their reunion and the ultimate discovery of that particular event that connects them.Gordon-Levitt delivers one of the most unforgettable performances I have seen in recent years. As a young hustler, his dark and secret past, allowed him to mask his emotions, and live life as if what he does for a living is something ordinary and mundane. With his eyes showing off nothing, and staring blankly into space, he goes from one job to another just as if he's replacing parts in an automotive shop or sorting out letters in a mail room. There are certain sex scenes that are graphic and disturbing, but it captures the world of Neil- dark, violent, uncaring... It's the only way he can go on- the absence of emotion and with it, the inability to truly love the people who care for him. Corbet also delivered an amazing performance, as Brian he is the shy, trusting and unassuming young man who is so obsessed with recording his periodic episodes of forgetfulness, that he opens himself to anyone who cared enough to listen...There is a certain fulfillment in watching this movie and see it towards its end, it opens up a world that is there, perhaps a world apart from your own, but it's there and you may need or may not need to protect yourself to discover it.",5,Sensational!,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,1784,"['Mysterious', 'Skin-', 'Sensational', 'controversial', 'intense', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'can', 'describe', 'movie', 'Gregg', 'Araki', 'based', 'novel', 'Scott', 'Heim', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'display', 'raw', 'emotions', 'two', 'young', 'lead', 'actors-', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'who', 'young', 'hustler', 'Neil', 'McCormick', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'who', 'Brian', 'shy', 'teen', 'who', 'was', 'abducted', 'Aliens', 'special', 'disturbing', 'connection', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'film', 'journey', 'reunion', 'ultimate', 'discovery', 'particular', 'event', 'them.Gordon-Levitt', 'delivers', 'one', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'young', 'hustler', 'dark', 'secret', 'past', 'allowed', 'mask', 'emotions', 'live', 'life', 'what', 'living', 'something', 'ordinary', 'mundane', 'eyes', 'showing', 'off', 'nothing', 'staring', 'blankly', 'space', 'one', 'job', 'just', 'replacing', 'parts', 'automotive', 'shop', 'sorting', 'out', 'letters', 'mail', 'room', 'are', 'certain', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'world', 'Neil-', 'dark', 'violent', 'uncaring', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'go', 'on-', 'absence', 'emotion', 'inability', 'truly', 'love', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'Corbet', 'also', 'delivered', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Brian', 'shy', 'trusting', 'unassuming', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'obsessed', 'recording', 'periodic', 'episodes', 'forgetfulness', 'anyone', 'who', 'cared', 'enough', 'listen', 'certain', 'fulfillment', 'watching', 'movie', 'see', 'towards', 'end', 'up', 'world', 'there', 'perhaps', 'world', 'apart', 'own', 'there', 'may', 'need', 'may', 'not', 'need', 'protect', 'discover']",Mysterious Skin

It stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Neil McCormick who is seduced by his Little league baseball coach when he is eight years old. He develops into the small mid town (Hutchinson) gay whore. He is clearly marked by the whole affair but felt as though he was truly loved.The story rides along side that of Bryan Lackey who has suffered blackouts and nose bleeds since he was eight. He feels that he may have been abducted by aliens and sets off on a path of discovery that leads to Neil. Meanwhile Neil has run off to be with his fag hag soul mate in New York.This all sounds like a basic plot but the story unfolds in such a way to make the 140 minutes drift by. With an 18 cert this is a challenging film, with scenes depicting paedophile activity as well as gay sex on occasion through out the film. It is a story of how children can be changed and ruined by abuse and how different people chose to handle severe trauma of this nature. It is also a very human tale which is told with great care and even warmth. It is even funny in places. This is not a typical gay film, and if you are looking for cute boys etc, then you are probably best to avoid.I found it moving, disturbing, but ultimately rewarding.

Two boys suffer sexual abuse as children; one remembers it and the other does not, until much later.It is not suitable for all viewers.  Many will be put off by the hustling between men and a teenage boy, or by the language, or something else.However, those who are able to handle it will find a disturbing, emotional journey in progress as the two boys, who lead disparate lives, eventually redisover each other and the complete truth is revealed about what happened to them so many years ago.  It's both amusing and sad that one of them thinks he was a victim of alien abduction; that's how his mind explained the trauma to him.The other boy is victimized even further; he sells himself to diseased and abusive older men to make money and perhaps to ""own"" what has happened to him.You will not forget this one easily.",4,Painful story of two damaged boys,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,852,"['not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'Two', 'boys', 'suffer', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'children', 'one', 'other', 'not', 'much', 'later.It', 'not', 'suitable', 'viewers', 'Many', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'hustling', 'men', 'teenage', 'boy', 'language', 'something', 'else.However', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'handle', 'will', 'find', 'disturbing', 'emotional', 'journey', 'progress', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'lead', 'disparate', 'lives', 'eventually', 'redisover', 'other', 'complete', 'truth', 'revealed', 'what', 'happened', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'amusing', 'sad', 'one', 'was', 'victim', 'alien', 'abduction', 'how', 'mind', 'explained', 'trauma', 'him.The', 'other', 'boy', 'victimized', 'even', 'further', 'diseased', 'abusive', 'older', 'men', 'make', 'money', 'perhaps', 'own', 'happened', 'him.You', 'will', 'not', 'forget', 'one', 'easily']",Mysterious Skin

933220,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000ATQYQU,Westley,"[13, 15]","""Mysterious Skin"" concerns two young men in 1991.  One (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a gay hustler who seems headed toward self-destructive oblivion; the other (Brady Corbet) is a repressed community college student convinced that he's been abducted repeatedly by aliens.  Told largely in flashback, the story relays how these two characters were profoundly affected by their childhoods.The acting is uniformly good.  Casting Gordon-Levitt in this role could have been gimmicky, much like Jonathon Taylor Thomas' role in the inferior ""Speedway Junky.""  However, Gordon-Levitt pulls off the role spectacularly, with a performance full of subtlety and shading.  Even though his character is off-putting and seemingly amoral, he manages to be likeable.  That the audience can sympathize with and even understand this character is a testament to Gordon-Levitt's work, as well as the terrific screenplay, adapted by the novel by Scott Heim.  Greg Araki's direction is also superb.  Many of the flashback scenes in particular required tremendous sensitivity to protect the child actors, which Araki manages with some inventive filming.  I haven't seen any of Araki's previous films, but I look forward to doing so.The movie is very good until the final scene, which is so profoundly affecting that it elevates a solid movie to an outstanding one.  The denouement is brilliant and haunting without resorting to cheap melodrama or fake catharsis - you don't get the feeling that ""all is well.""  Again, credit has to go to Araki and the stars.  Overall, this film is a superb examination of how the past can dictate our futures.  Most highly recommended.Extras include a somewhat awkward filmed reading by Barry Corbet and Joseph Gordon-Levitt of the first sections of the Heim novel as well as a highly informative commentary track with Araki, Corbet, and Gordon-Levitt.",5,"""Here we go.""",1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,1858,"['Mysterious', 'Skin', 'concerns', 'two', 'young', 'men', '1991', 'One', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'gay', 'hustler', 'who', 'headed', 'self-destructive', 'oblivion', 'other', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'repressed', 'community', 'college', 'student', 'convinced', 'been', 'abducted', 'repeatedly', 'aliens', 'Told', 'largely', 'flashback', 'story', 'how', 'two', 'characters', 'were', 'profoundly', 'affected', 'childhoods.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'Casting', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'gimmicky', 'much', 'Jonathon', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'role', 'inferior', 'Speedway', 'Junky', 'However', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'role', 'spectacularly', 'performance', 'full', 'subtlety', 'shading', 'Even', 'character', 'off-putting', 'seemingly', 'amoral', 'be', 'likeable', 'audience', 'can', 'sympathize', 'even', 'understand', 'character', 'testament', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'terrific', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Scott', 'Heim', 'Greg', 'Araki', 'direction', 'also', 'superb', 'Many', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'particular', 'required', 'tremendous', 'sensitivity', 'protect', 'child', 'actors', 'Araki', 'inventive', 'filming', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Araki', 'previous', 'films', 'look', 'forward', 'doing', 'so.The', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'final', 'scene', 'so', 'profoundly', 'affecting', 'solid', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'one', 'denouement', 'brilliant', 'haunting', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'melodrama', 'fake', 'catharsis', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'well', 'Again', 'credit', 'go', 'Araki', 'stars', 'Overall', 'film', 'superb', 'examination', 'how', 'past', 'can', 'dictate', 'futures', 'Most', 'highly', 'recommended.Extras', 'include', 'somewhat', 'awkward', 'filmed', 'reading', 'Barry', 'Corbet', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'first', 'sections', 'Heim', 'novel', 'as', 'well', 'highly', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Araki', 'Corbet', 'Gordon-Levitt']",Mysterious Skin

The story was presented with great integrity using a stark and unblinking style which avoided the obvious maudlin and didactic pitfalls of the subject matter.
