I would say it is more a woman's film but Danny Aiello who plays the part of a retired cop who lost his wife is a good representative for the male viewer to also enjoy the this film.  I have watched this movie countless times over the past few years.  I recommend this movie to anyone who I feel would like to spend a few hours with people who are learning to cope with the unexpected change to their life.  There are tears, laughs but through it all friendships that help them move forward and look forward to the new journey.  You may also appreciate some of the background music that is in a few scenes.  Is this movie somewhat old fashioned yes but in a rather contemporary way and that for me makes it a movie I would and do recommend to my neighbors who are over 55.",5,"Tears, Laughs, and Friendship",1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,892,"['am', 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'well', 'acted', 'story', 'line', 'most', 'people', '55', 'could', 'relate', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'woman', 'film', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'who', 'part', 'retired', 'cop', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'good', 'representative', 'male', 'viewer', 'also', 'enjoy', 'film', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'countless', 'times', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'feel', 'would', 'like', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'learning', 'cope', 'unexpected', 'change', 'life', 'are', 'tears', 'laughs', 'help', 'move', 'forward', 'look', 'forward', 'new', 'journey', 'may', 'also', 'appreciate', 'background', 'music', 'few', 'scenes', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'old', 'fashioned', 'yes', 'rather', 'contemporary', 'way', 'movie', 'would', 'do', 'recommend', 'neighbors', 'who', 'are', '55']",N/A
