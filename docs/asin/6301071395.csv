244720,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6301071395,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 6/13Rate: 76/13: Shy People is an unusual film that compares and contrasts people of two different worlds: the upscale, chic New York and the backwoods Louisiana bayou. Apparently, the story smacks of the common elements of a typical Tennessee Williams play. The closest resemblance is The Glass Menagerie. Meanwhile, the acting of the casting is very good, but I have my reservations about Barbara Hershey and her relative co-stars. I don't think they were authentic enough to play the roles. No matter what, they did a good job. On the other hand, as for the plot, I don't believe that the director got the point across succinctly clear as I hoped for. Perhaps this comment merits another viewing of Shy People from me in the future. There is a bit of Deliverance going on in there, but it's obvious that Grace started the mess herself by offering the hillbillies cocaine which tripped them off on the wrong course. The cinematography of the film is well-done and sets the mood of the atmosphere eloquently well. As usual, Andrei Konchalvsky's direction is solid. All in all, Shy People doesn't succeed when it needs to get the message across to the audience loud and clear.",4,Doesn't Get the Point Across Very Well.,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,1184,"['Viewed', '6/13Rate', '76/13', 'Shy', 'People', 'unusual', 'film', 'people', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'upscale', 'chic', 'New', 'York', 'backwoods', 'Louisiana', 'bayou', 'Apparently', 'story', 'smacks', 'common', 'elements', 'typical', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'closest', 'resemblance', 'Glass', 'Menagerie', 'Meanwhile', 'acting', 'casting', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'reservations', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'relative', 'co-stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'authentic', 'enough', 'play', 'roles', 'matter', 'what', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'other', 'hand', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'director', 'got', 'point', 'succinctly', 'clear', 'hoped', 'Perhaps', 'comment', 'viewing', 'Shy', 'People', 'future', 'bit', 'Deliverance', 'going', 'obvious', 'Grace', 'started', 'mess', 'offering', 'hillbillies', 'cocaine', 'tripped', 'off', 'wrong', 'course', 'cinematography', 'film', 'well-done', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'eloquently', 'well', 'usual', 'Andrei', 'Konchalvsky', 'direction', 'solid', 'Shy', 'People', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'when', 'get', 'message', 'audience', 'loud', 'clear']",Shy People VHS

244723,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6301071395,Lawyeraau,"[24, 25]","This is an unusual film with a knockout performance by Barbara Hershey, who deservedly won the 1987 Cannes Film Festival Best Actress award for her brilliant and moving portrayal of Ruth Sullivan, a fiercely proud, backwoods, bayou matriarch, who resorts to unusual tactics to keep her sons from the outside world.The story centers around the Sullivan family, the East Coast and  Louisiana branches. It turns out that the East Coast branch is headed up by magazine editor, Diana Sullivan (Jill Clayburgh), who decides to write a piece about her southern relatives. Diana heads down South with her spoiled, teenage daughter (Martha Plimpton).When they gets down there, they are is taken aback by what they find. This Southern branch of the Sullivan family seems like a throwback to another era. The first word that pops into the viewer's mind is &quot;inbreeding&quot;, so backwards do they seem. The East Coast Sullivans are wealthy and overdressed for their new environs. The Bayou Sullivans do not even have electricity. Still, they try to socialize and get to know one another, after an initial standoff.The outside world has now invaded Ruth's home, and some of Ruth's stern notions have invaded Diane's psyche. This becomes manifest at the end in the new way in which they each decide to handle their rebellious offspring. One can tell that Ruth and Diane have each touched the other in some meaningful way. This does not happen, however, before there have been some serious clashes.It is hard to describe this film, as it is not a plot driven film. What little plot there is, is a bit implausible. It is just a highly unusual, character driven film, and the one who drives it is Barbara Hershey with a performance so awesome, it will take the viewer's breath away. With a stellar supporting cast, it is film not to be missed.Filmed in the heart of Cajun country, the cinematography is magnificent, with incredible shots of the mist shrouded bayou with its unusual terrain and fauna. It makes for a haunting and highly atmospheric film.",5,THE CITY MOUSE MEETS THE COUNTRY MOUSE...,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,2041,"['unusual', 'film', 'knockout', 'performance', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'who', 'deservedly', 'won', '1987', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Best', 'Actress', 'award', 'brilliant', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'Ruth', 'Sullivan', 'fiercely', 'proud', 'backwoods', 'bayou', 'matriarch', 'who', 'unusual', 'tactics', 'keep', 'sons', 'outside', 'world.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'East', 'Coast', 'Louisiana', 'branches', 'out', 'East', 'Coast', 'branch', 'headed', 'up', 'magazine', 'editor', 'Diana', 'Sullivan', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'who', 'write', 'piece', 'southern', 'relatives', 'Diana', 'down', 'South', 'spoiled', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', '.When', 'down', 'there', 'are', 'taken', 'aback', 'what', 'find', 'Southern', 'branch', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'throwback', 'era', 'first', 'word', 'viewer', 'mind', 'quot', 'inbreeding', 'quot', 'backwards', 'do', 'seem', 'East', 'Coast', 'Sullivans', 'are', 'wealthy', 'overdressed', 'new', 'environs', 'Bayou', 'Sullivans', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'electricity', 'Still', 'try', 'socialize', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'initial', 'standoff.The', 'outside', 'world', 'now', 'invaded', 'Ruth', 'home', 'Ruth', 'stern', 'notions', 'have', 'invaded', 'Diane', 'psyche', 'manifest', 'end', 'new', 'way', 'decide', 'handle', 'rebellious', 'offspring', 'One', 'can', 'tell', 'Ruth', 'Diane', 'have', 'touched', 'other', 'meaningful', 'way', 'not', 'happen', 'however', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'clashes.It', 'hard', 'describe', 'film', 'not', 'plot', 'driven', 'film', 'What', 'little', 'plot', 'bit', 'implausible', 'just', 'highly', 'unusual', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'one', 'who', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'performance', 'so', 'awesome', 'will', 'take', 'viewer', 'breath', 'away', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Filmed', 'heart', 'Cajun', 'country', 'cinematography', 'magnificent', 'incredible', 'shots', 'mist', 'shrouded', 'bayou', 'unusual', 'terrain', 'fauna', 'haunting', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'film']",Shy People VHS

But since I like the story and the acting in it, I am willing to forget about its flaws in picture quality.Yet, as for so many other little ""jewels and gems"" out there, seemingly nobody has the time to find a pristine copy and slam it onto DVD...Is it because in this case, it was produced by The Cannon Group, a production company long gone, who was managed by the Golan-Globus team?OK, so the company does not exist anymore, but has anybody thought at buying the rights and make it their own?Just as it has happened for really crappy movies in the past?Perhaps crap is better than art.I also remember having watched the movie at theaters and it was gorgeous. The hostile, almost gothic landscape of the bayous was so romantically photographed that despite its unfriendly appearance it was almost inviting to a person who has never been there.Shy People merits a royal digital treatment, if not for the photography alone, at least for the acting contained in it.I hope someone listens to reason and works up the courage to do so.I really count on it...",4,Beautiful picture wasted on tape...,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,1178,"['recorded', 'one', 'back', 'early', 'nineties', 'HBO', 'still', 'have', 'it.Naturally', 'today', 'standards', 'awful', 'like', 'story', 'acting', 'am', 'willing', 'forget', 'flaws', 'picture', 'quality.Yet', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'little', 'jewels', 'gems', 'there', 'seemingly', 'nobody', 'time', 'find', 'pristine', 'copy', 'slam', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'produced', 'Cannon', 'Group', 'production', 'company', 'long', 'gone', 'who', 'was', 'managed', 'Golan-Globus', 'team', 'OK', 'company', 'not', 'exist', 'anymore', 'anybody', 'thought', 'buying', 'rights', 'make', 'own', 'Just', 'happened', 'really', 'crappy', 'movies', 'past', 'Perhaps', 'crap', 'better', 'art.I', 'also', 'remember', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'theaters', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'hostile', 'almost', 'gothic', 'landscape', 'bayous', 'was', 'so', 'romantically', 'photographed', 'unfriendly', 'appearance', 'was', 'almost', 'inviting', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'there.Shy', 'People', 'royal', 'digital', 'treatment', 'not', 'photography', 'alone', 'least', 'acting', 'contained', 'it.I', 'hope', 'someone', 'listens', 'reason', 'up', 'courage', 'do', 'so.I', 'really', 'count']",Shy People VHS
244725,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6301071395,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 3]","It is funny how far apart the variation of reactions is to this film:  some see a profound statement, others bald stereotypes.  What made the difference for me was the quality of the acting:  outstanding.  Hershey is at her best in this as a plain swamp woman trying to control her sons with an iron hand.  In contrast, Clayburgh is a liberal city type, who not only lets her daughter experiment with hard drugs, but turns a blind eye to the fact that she is dating one of her mother's former lovers.So far are the plot goes, Clayburgh decides to go to visit some distant relatives in Louisiana, perhaps to do a story for her magazine, but also to spend time with her daughter, who can only be described as a dangerous adolescent.  When they arrive, they are shocked at how primitive their cousin's lives are, almost living in autarchy, with few ties to the mainland.  It is a place of great freedom from social obligation but also cut off from economic opportunity, where fundamentalist conservatism is balanced by a libertine culture of stripper bars and drink.As they spend time together, the contrast only sharpens.  Hershey wants to tightly control the lives of her sons, to the point that she keeps one of them in a cage, while the other lives there with a homely wife, trying to be the man in the family.  Hershey also has some painful secrets, like the husband that left her and a son she refuses to mention.  The arrival of Clayburgh disrupts the balance, with some dire consequences:  her difficult daughter discovers that it is foolish to provoke isolated men in this back water, as she taps her supply of cocaine.  The resulting conflict reveals the pain in both families, to the point that the two women learn from eachother.Now this may sound sappy, but at least for me it was completely believable.  The characters were not at all two-dimensional, but full, quirky beings, whose little touches stick vividly in the memory.  There is a scene, for example, where Hershey comes to a bar with an old colt pistol, seeking vengeance for an assault on her son; she quickly goes beserk for reasons (later explained) and is taken to jail.  In another scene, Clayburgh goes into the bayou, desperately  in search of her traumatized daughter.  Dramatic, to be sure, but very emotionally true in my viewing.Recommended.  This is a very good indie film that deserves release on DVD.",4,culture clash between an extended family,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,2384,"['funny', 'how', 'far', 'apart', 'variation', 'reactions', 'film', 'see', 'profound', 'statement', 'others', 'bald', 'stereotypes', 'What', 'made', 'difference', 'was', 'quality', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'Hershey', 'best', 'plain', 'swamp', 'woman', 'trying', 'control', 'sons', 'iron', 'hand', 'contrast', 'Clayburgh', 'liberal', 'city', 'type', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'daughter', 'experiment', 'hard', 'drugs', 'blind', 'eye', 'fact', 'dating', 'one', 'mother', 'former', 'lovers.So', 'far', 'are', 'plot', 'Clayburgh', 'go', 'visit', 'distant', 'relatives', 'Louisiana', 'perhaps', 'do', 'story', 'magazine', 'also', 'spend', 'time', 'daughter', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'dangerous', 'adolescent', 'When', 'arrive', 'are', 'shocked', 'how', 'primitive', 'cousin', 'lives', 'are', 'almost', 'living', 'autarchy', 'few', 'ties', 'mainland', 'place', 'great', 'freedom', 'social', 'obligation', 'also', 'cut', 'off', 'economic', 'opportunity', 'where', 'fundamentalist', 'conservatism', 'balanced', 'libertine', 'culture', 'stripper', 'bars', 'drink.As', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'contrast', 'only', 'Hershey', 'tightly', 'control', 'lives', 'sons', 'point', 'one', 'cage', 'other', 'lives', 'there', 'homely', 'wife', 'trying', 'be', 'man', 'family', 'Hershey', 'also', 'painful', 'secrets', 'husband', 'left', 'son', 'mention', 'arrival', 'Clayburgh', 'balance', 'dire', 'consequences', 'difficult', 'daughter', 'discovers', 'foolish', 'provoke', 'isolated', 'men', 'back', 'water', 'supply', 'cocaine', 'resulting', 'conflict', 'pain', 'families', 'point', 'two', 'women', 'learn', 'eachother.Now', 'may', 'sound', 'sappy', 'least', 'was', 'completely', 'believable', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'two-dimensional', 'full', 'quirky', 'beings', 'little', 'touches', 'stick', 'vividly', 'memory', 'scene', 'example', 'where', 'Hershey', 'bar', 'old', 'colt', 'pistol', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'assault', 'son', 'quickly', 'beserk', 'reasons', 'later', 'explained', 'taken', 'jail', 'scene', 'Clayburgh', 'bayou', 'desperately', 'search', 'traumatized', 'daughter', 'Dramatic', 'be', 'sure', 'very', 'emotionally', 'true', 'viewing.Recommended', 'very', 'good', 'indie', 'film', 'release', 'DVD']",Shy People VHS
