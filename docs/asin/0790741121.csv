Hepburn was 28 at the time, and looked younger, Cooper was 56, and looked perhaps older, but despite the age difference, their chemistry together sparkles and sizzles.The romantic cat and mouse game played by Hepburn to intrigue and win Cooper's heart is all very innocent and sweet, and I always shed a few tears at the magical ending.Maurice Chevalier as Hepburn's father, a private detective specializing in matters of  love and deception is fabulous, and gets most of the funny lines, and John McGiver, as one of Chevalier's jealous husband clients, is also very amusing.The b &amp; w cinematography by William Mellor is exceptional, and how the camera loves Audrey, looking exquisite in an array of beautiful gowns. There is also a quartet called &quot;The Gypsies&quot;, who serenade the lovers throughout the film with some terrific czardas, and the melodic song &quot;Fascination&quot;.Light, frothy, and thoroughly enjoyable, this is one of Billy Wilder's most delightful films, and it's a treasure for Hepburn and Cooper fans.Total running time is 130 minutes.",5,Wilder's Parisian souffle,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,1439,"['two', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'glamorous', 'stars', 'silly', 'plot', 'sharp', 'witty', 'script', 'film', 'evergreen', 'one', 'never', 'tire', 'watching.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'enchanting', 'spunky', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Girl', 'quot', 'cello', 'student', 'who', 'love', 'millionaire', 'playboy', 'bachelor', 'played', 'grace', 'charm', 'quite', 'bit', 'humor', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Hepburn', 'was', '28', 'time', 'looked', 'younger', 'Cooper', 'was', '56', 'looked', 'perhaps', 'older', 'age', 'difference', 'chemistry', 'together', 'sparkles', 'sizzles.The', 'romantic', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'played', 'Hepburn', 'intrigue', 'win', 'Cooper', 'heart', 'very', 'innocent', 'sweet', 'always', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'magical', 'ending.Maurice', 'Chevalier', 'Hepburn', 'father', 'private', 'detective', 'specializing', 'matters', 'love', 'deception', 'fabulous', 'most', 'funny', 'lines', 'John', 'McGiver', 'one', 'Chevalier', 'jealous', 'husband', 'clients', 'also', 'very', 'amusing.The', 'b', 'amp', 'cinematography', 'William', 'Mellor', 'exceptional', 'how', 'camera', 'Audrey', 'looking', 'exquisite', 'array', 'beautiful', 'gowns', 'also', 'quartet', 'called', 'quot', 'Gypsies', 'quot', 'who', 'serenade', 'lovers', 'film', 'terrific', 'czardas', 'melodic', 'song', 'quot', 'Fascination', 'quot', '.Light', 'frothy', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'most', 'delightful', 'films', 'treasure', 'Hepburn', 'Cooper', 'fans.Total', 'running', 'time', '130', 'minutes']",N/A

One sees/witnesses both films simultaneously, and it's an unsettling experience. The lighthearted froth is attentuated by the presence of the second, darker film about a visibly unwell actor. Hepburn and Chevalier are both fine. Even though Wilder is a major artist, the pacing of this film feels heavy and slow. The most effective scene comes near the end, when a distraught Cooper, for once in harmony with the part he is playing,  seeks help from the detective played by Chevalier.  There's a lot of Germanic/Central European music in the film, the most amusing passage perhaps coming when Franz Waxman recomposes for the soundtrack bits of a Haydn symphony. Not a must-see by any means, but worth it perhaps for Hepburn and Chevalier fans.

In all his films he favours the eccentric, or at least a very unconventional situations. In LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON he focuses on a type of romance not exactly promoted by Guidance Councellors in any High School programmes.His Arienne is quite probably slightly mad. Not an unlikely result from having a Maurice Chevalier as your sole parent. There can be no other reasons why she should pursue a very old and somewhat unbending Gary Cooper. But no matter that. Wilder is no moralist and instead focuses his attention on the comic elements arising out of the situation.This is the most musical non Musical I know off, and not just because of the frequent appearance of a String Quartet. Hepburn, Chevalier and Cooper themselves are like a musical Trio. No one could deliver her lines like Audrey Hepburn and here she is at her lilting best, almost like a songbird. In fact, all the visual embellishments of this film, such as the little dog, the cello, the fur coat weave their way in and out of the plot like melodic strands in some piece of Chamber Music.Every time I see this film I like it more and more. The black and white cinematography is superb and comes out well on DVD. The scenes between Hepburn and Chevalier are priceless. The choice of Gary Cooper has been critizised in some quarters, but his Rock of Gibralter solidness and his All-American masculinity provide the perfect counterfoil to the flighty feminity of the Chevalier character.It may well be as Hepburn and Cooper elope in the train in the final scene that she is abandoning the Mother figure (Chevalier) for a life with a Father she longs for but never knew.

108927,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790741121,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Billy Wilder was one of the greatest directors of all time.  Seriously.  I'm not even afraid of the hyperbole that can be attributed to a statement that broad.  He really was, and the best thing about Wilder is that no matter what you cinematic tastes are, you can fully embrace and actually LOVE at least one if not all of his films.  Whether it was comedy, romance, drama, biographical or what-have-you, he had his hands in that pot and was stirring it rather well.I just felt compelled to say that right off the bat because, well, Billy Wilder always deserves to be singled out and praised before his film gets any notations.`Love in the Afternoon' is a soft and sweet love story that a young and nave girl who becomes smitten and somewhat obsessed with a middle aged womanizer who her father (a private detective) has been hired to follow by a desperate husband suspecting his wife of cheating.  When her father gathers evidence that the man's wife is seeing this playboy, he becomes irate and threatens to kill him, so this young waif of a charmer sneaks off to warn the man and falls rapidly in love with him in the process.  Of course, this young woman is taken by this man's manicured charms and his devilish persona and he is completely absorbed in her apparent innocence and yet he's bowled over by the lies she wraps around herself as protection from his devious devices.  Their game of cat and mouse is certainly a joy to watch unfold.`Love in the Afternoon' lives and dies in the very same avenue; the acting.  You have one solid, Oscar worthy star turn and you have one rather stilted and somewhat miscast one.  Let's get the bland out of the way first.  Gary Cooper, while highly respected for his work, doesn't do anything of note here.  In fact, he is far too old for the part and comes across creepy, not charming, when pursuing the childlike Hepburn.  His take on this swinger is also not as exciting as it needed to be.  He pales when next to her.  Hepburn on the other hand is sensational.  Hepburn's infatuation with the dangerous (and much older) Gary Cooper was so believable and so engaging. The way she flirted in such an innocent and unknowing manner; you could completely understand why Gary Cooper's womanizer was smitten to the point of instability.All in all, this is a really good film and one that I was delighted to watch from start to finish; I just can't help but detract a star on the basis that it would have been so much better had Cooper been replaced with a more charming and more believable actor.",4,Falling in love with Audrey Hepburn is very easy to do...,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,2539,"['Billy', 'Wilder', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'time', 'Seriously', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'hyperbole', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'statement', 'broad', 'really', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'Wilder', 'matter', 'what', 'cinematic', 'tastes', 'are', 'can', 'fully', 'embrace', 'actually', 'LOVE', 'least', 'one', 'not', 'films', 'was', 'comedy', 'romance', 'drama', 'biographical', 'what-have-you', 'had', 'hands', 'pot', 'was', 'stirring', 'rather', 'well.I', 'just', 'felt', 'compelled', 'say', 'right', 'bat', 'well', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'always', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'praised', 'film', 'notations.', 'Love', 'Afternoon', 'soft', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'young', 'nave', 'girl', 'who', 'smitten', 'somewhat', 'obsessed', 'middle', 'aged', 'womanizer', 'who', 'father', 'private', 'detective', 'been', 'hired', 'follow', 'desperate', 'husband', 'suspecting', 'wife', 'cheating', 'When', 'father', 'gathers', 'evidence', 'man', 'wife', 'seeing', 'playboy', 'irate', 'kill', 'so', 'young', 'waif', 'charmer', 'warn', 'man', 'rapidly', 'love', 'process', 'course', 'young', 'woman', 'taken', 'man', 'manicured', 'charms', 'devilish', 'persona', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'apparent', 'innocence', 'yet', 'bowled', 'lies', 'wraps', 'around', 'protection', 'devious', 'devices', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'certainly', 'joy', 'watch', 'unfold.', 'Love', 'Afternoon', 'lives', 'dies', 'very', 'same', 'avenue', 'acting', 'have', 'one', 'solid', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'star', 'turn', 'have', 'one', 'rather', 'stilted', 'somewhat', 'miscast', 'one', 'Let', 'get', 'bland', 'way', 'first', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'highly', 'respected', 'work', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'note', 'here', 'fact', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'creepy', 'not', 'charming', 'when', 'pursuing', 'childlike', 'Hepburn', 'take', 'swinger', 'also', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'needed', 'be', 'when', 'next', 'Hepburn', 'other', 'hand', 'sensational', 'Hepburn', 'infatuation', 'dangerous', 'much', 'older', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'was', 'so', 'believable', 'so', 'engaging', 'way', 'flirted', 'such', 'innocent', 'unknowing', 'manner', 'could', 'completely', 'understand', 'why', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'womanizer', 'was', 'smitten', 'point', 'instability.All', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'delighted', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'detract', 'star', 'basis', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'Cooper', 'been', 'replaced', 'more', 'charming', 'more', 'believable', 'actor']",N/A

108937,A2WLZD9BY669HY,0790741121,Candace Scott,"[86, 94]","The common criticism of this delightful film is that Gary Cooper, one of the icons of Hollywood, was ""too old"" to play the lead against the youthful Audrey Hepburn. This is, quite frankly, ludicrous and almost laughable. Though Coop was 56 when the movie was filmed, he was still incredibly handsome, well-preserved, thin and as sexy as he had been in his prime. There isn't a single moment where the viewer would doubt that this man wasn't utterly believable in the role or womanizer and seducer extraodinaire. Audrey Hepburn would have been a fool to turn her nose up at this choice male animal, even if he was 30 years her senior.Coop and Hepburn's scenes together are all marvelous, especially the famous film-ending train scene, this one still makes one's toes curl, even after 20+ viewings over the years.

As stated here by other reviewers Hepburn's chemistry with the ruggeded, quintessentially American Cooper (and the charmingly Gallic Maurice Chevalier) is simply wonderful. Would that we all carried into maturity the memory of such magical first love! And special mention must go to the delightful character actor John McGiver as the amusingly pixilated cuckold whose mission of husbandly vengeance is thwarted, thank goodness, by the plucky, quick-thinking Ariane/Audrey.I will say that I remain firmly on the fence as to the casting of Gary Cooper in the role of debonair playboy, Frank Flannagan, the object of the inexperienced Ariane's affections. Coop is nothing less than terrific, but director Billy Wilder reportedly had always wanted to work with Cary Grant, and the Flannagan character--like the Linus role in the Wilder/Hepburn outing ""Sabrina""--seems tailor-made for Grant's witty, effortless style. Though Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn would be wonderfully paired just a few years later in 1963's funny, suspenseful ""Charade"", I would love to have seen them together in this movie as well.In cinema, as in real life, love can work between two people who are simply ""right"" for each other regardless of their ages. That said, I have to admit I do sympathize somewhat with those who are uncomfortable with the age difference between Hepburn and Cooper. Cooper is rather obviously nearing 60; Hepburn, though she was in fact 27 or 28 at the time of filming, was playing a much younger character--Ariane's artless naivate (and the protective worry of her loving father) would seem to place her age somewhere between 18 and 20, not much more. Accordingly, the characters' age gulf is closer to four decades rather than three. Still, you don't get much better in American movies than Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper--they just don't make 'em like that anymore...",5,Ca C'est L'amour,1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,2142,"['think', 'delectable', 'word', 'want', 'here', 'course', 'description', 'would', 'apply', 'nearly', 'cinematic', 'thing', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'ever', 'did', 'have', 'special', 'fondness', 'romantic', 'black', 'white', 'films', '1957', 'Love', 'Afternoon', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'stated', 'here', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Hepburn', 'chemistry', 'ruggeded', 'quintessentially', 'American', 'Cooper', 'charmingly', 'Gallic', 'Maurice', 'Chevalier', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'Would', 'carried', 'maturity', 'memory', 'such', 'magical', 'first', 'love', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'go', 'delightful', 'character', 'actor', 'John', 'McGiver', 'amusingly', 'pixilated', 'cuckold', 'mission', 'husbandly', 'vengeance', 'thwarted', 'thank', 'goodness', 'plucky', 'quick-thinking', 'Ariane/Audrey.I', 'will', 'say', 'remain', 'firmly', 'fence', 'casting', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'role', 'debonair', 'playboy', 'Frank', 'Flannagan', 'object', 'inexperienced', 'Ariane', 'affections', 'Coop', 'nothing', 'less', 'terrific', 'director', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'reportedly', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'work', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Flannagan', 'character', 'Linus', 'role', 'Wilder/Hepburn', 'outing', 'Sabrina', 'tailor-made', 'Grant', 'witty', 'effortless', 'style', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'would', 'be', 'wonderfully', 'paired', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', '1963', 'funny', 'suspenseful', 'Charade', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'together', 'movie', 'well.In', 'cinema', 'real', 'life', 'love', 'can', 'work', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'simply', 'right', 'other', 'regardless', 'ages', 'said', 'have', 'admit', 'do', 'sympathize', 'somewhat', 'who', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'age', 'difference', 'Hepburn', 'Cooper', 'Cooper', 'rather', 'obviously', 'nearing', '60', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'fact', '27', '28', 'time', 'filming', 'was', 'playing', 'much', 'younger', 'character', 'Ariane', 'artless', 'naivate', 'protective', 'worry', 'loving', 'father', 'would', 'seem', 'place', 'age', 'somewhere', '18', '20', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'Accordingly', 'characters', 'age', 'gulf', 'closer', 'four', 'decades', 'rather', 'three', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'American', 'movies', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'anymore']",N/A

108946,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0790741121,Ed Uyeshima,"[44, 47]","Turner Classic Movies' classic movie series continues with this two-disc set showcasing four beloved films with romantic themes. Intriguingly, while two movies have the requisite happy ending, the other two close with former lovers resigned to the wisdom gained from relationships that could not endure. All four have been presented in pristine print condition.Splendor in the Grass(****1/2): Director Elia Kazan was able to extract a searing performance from Natalie Wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920's Kansas. She has never been more affecting then she is here as Deanie Loomis, the local butcher's daughter deeply in love with Bud Stamper, the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero. They are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry, but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents.While the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to Kazan's sure hand and William Inge's screenplay (his first directly for the screen), it's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue. At her most youthfully beautiful, Wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned. As the none-too-bright Bud, Warren Beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes Deanie's powerful fixation completely understandable. The classic Wordsworth poem from which the film's title is derived makes a fitting coda for this movie, and I still feel the intractable sense of longing in the two lead characters every time I see this movie. The 2009 DVD offers the original theatrical trailer and a familiar 1961 Roadrunner cartoon short, ""Beep Prepared"".Love in the Afternoon(****): There is likely no more romantic ending to a Hollywood movie than the one in this souffl&eacute;-light 1957 romantic comedy, where Audrey Hepburn tries to keep up with a departing train upon which Gary Cooper stands and listens intently to her babbling about her fictitious sexual conquests. Hepburn plays Ariane, a young cellist and the daughter of a Parisian private investigator named Claude Chevasse. She has an unbridled interest in her father's often tawdry cases, chief among them the affairs of Frank Flannagan, a millionaire industrialist and aging playboy who finds himself in various trysts with married women around the world. They embark on a clandestine affair under the pretense that she is as much a worldly bon vivant as he is.Things come to a head when Flannagan becomes infatuated with this mysterious ""thin girl"" and recruits Crevasse to find out who she is. Film master Billy Wilder leaves his unmistakable stamp on this confection with a clever, ironic script co-written with his long-time partner I.A.L. Diamond in their first collaboration. The dialogue is full of their trademark sparkling banter. Hepburn is her usual impeccable self as Ariane. Cooper played this type of boulevardier role in the 1930's under masters like Ernst Lubitsch, and it is quite enjoyable to see him come back to this milieu two decades later as an aging lothario. Maurice Chevalier is ideally cast as Crevasse even if he has to play down his naturally effervescent manner. Granted the film runs a little too long at 126 minutes, but it is fine, light entertainment. The print transfer on the bare-bones 2005 DVD is fine though not outstanding.Mogambo(****): Ava Gardner could hardly be considered anyone's second choice, but this is what director John Ford and screenwriter John Lee Mahin would have you believe in this overripe 1952 safari melodrama. Yet, she is the primary reason why this film is still worth a look 56 years later, epitomizing a primal sensuality and a hidden vulnerability, the combination of which was intoxicating in her prime. Ford captures this, as well as her dark beauty and sharp comedy sense, by casting her as smart-mouthed, carefree playgirl Eloise ""Honey Bear"" Kelly, who has come to a remote African outpost to meet up with a wealthy maharajah.Finding herself stood up, she is greeted by no-nonsense big game hunter Victor Marswell as she conveniently takes a shower al fresco. Looking the patrician beauty that served her well during her brief movie career, a 24-year-old Grace Kelly plays a prudish English wife in starchy, melodramatic fashion. As Marswell, the 52-year-old Clark Gable still shows his enduring appeal, but he really hands the picture to Gardner. Ford handles the exotic background as well as he does Monument Valley in his classic westerns, and the look of the film is sumptuous even by MGM's high standards. The only extra with the 2006 DVD is the original theatrical trailer.Now, Voyager(****): Let's face it - this 1942 Warner Bros film classic is a hoot. Directed by journeyman studio veteran Irving Rapper, it's an unabashed, only-in-Hollywood soap opera with Bette Davis at the peak of her popularity as she evolves from a distraught, overweight spinster to a glamorous Boston society social maven in about ten minutes. It's also a big valentine to the positive effects of psychoanalysis, as the plot focuses on heiress Charlotte Vale, a walking disaster of sheltered neurosis. Her sister-in-law contacts a doctor who convinces Charlotte to seek psychiatric treatment at a posh sanitarium. Transformed by the experience, she finds romance with architect Jerry Durrance, who is married to an unstable woman.Overcome with guilt, Charlotte returns to the sanitarium, where she meets troubled young Tina, who turns out to be Jerry's daughter. In what amounts to a showcase for her versatility, Davis is superb in both before and after modes, even playing a romantic shipboard teenager with sincerity in a flashback sequence. Paul Henried plays Jerry with requisite Continental charm, but he is truly overmatched by Davis in their scenes together. Claude Rains fares better in the pivotal role of Dr. Jaquith providing his medical advice with convincing paternal authority and genuine warmth. Gladys Cooper portrays Charlotte's iron-willed mother in a sharply uncompromising manner befitting the intimidating stature she holds in the family. The print condition on the 2005 DVD is excellent, though there are no other extras included.",4,"Romance has a 50/50 Chance in this Classic Four-Pack, Classic Hollywood DVD Set",1262822400,"01 7,

And kind of off-putting, too, due to Cooper not just -being- too old (Cary Grant made the age difference work in several films)--but really, [i]looking[/i] too old. He moves stiffly, has bags under his eyes and seems to have very little chemistry with Hepburn (while having to be leering at her--with a near-40 year age difference--something Grant wisely refused to do in Stanley Donen's movie).Wilder tries to hide Cooper's age by often photographing him in the shadows, but it really doesn't help. And, although I realize they're the two big stars in the film, I always wish the ending changed--that Cooper leaves, true to form, and the ""happy ending"" is simply that she's older and wiser as she moves on to other, better, relationships.I guess for someone who sees Cooper as charismatic and attractive here, this movie will still work.

I was utterly astounded that I found myself relating to a love story that was intended to have taken place nearly fifty years ago in Paris.  The essence of love has obviously not changed over the years, no matter how drastically the world we inhabit has changed.Billy Wilder, the man behind such classics as ""Sabrina"", ""Some Like it Hot"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", and ""The Seven Year Itch"", directed and co-wrote this timeless romance.  Starring two of Old Hollywood's greatest stars, Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper, this film is flawless.

I've made it a point to see as many of Wilder's films as I can, and I found that this film was missing the edge that his others have.  The basic story is wealthy ladies man Gary Cooper who has many women in every town he travels to, becomes involved with a mysterious, apparently experienced Audrey Hepburn, who in reality is a student and lives with her detective father Maurice Chevalier.  She falls for him quickly, and he gradually begins to fall for her, despite knowing remarkably little about her.  But can such an oddly matched couple find lasting love together?  There is some sharp dialogue in the film, as one would expect from Wilder.  He also knows how to milk a gag for what it's worth.  The ending is also very satisfying, something he was known for.  But all of that didn't add up to enough for me to really like the film.  Hepburn lights up the screen as she usually did.  Cooper, however, I think was not the best choice, lacking the worldly quality of a playboy.  He is also badly photographed in the film, although I have read that it was done purposely to downplay his age.  As for the frequently discussed age gap between the stars, they're both adults so it was not a big deal to me.  However, their lack of real chemistry and the thinness of the plot was a bigger deal.  In the hands of a director like Wilder, I expected more substance and polish.

""Love in the Afternoon"" was one of the few my girlfriend hadn't seen and, even with the criticisms on Gary Cooper, I thought that this would be worth checking out.I was surprised by how funny Chevalier was in this picture. His observations on the illicit liasons he investigates are hilarious. While he's a little oblivious to Arianne's [Audrey Hepburn] needs at the beginning, it's clear that he genuinely loves her and this film is as much about his evolution as a father as it is about the ""May-December"" romance at its center.Hepburn is her elegant self throughout. For me, she was not as believable as the innocent cellist who would swoon whenever she imagined ""Fascination"" being played. She was masterful as the skillful seductress who turns Mr. Flanagan's [Gary Cooper] playboy ways against him by pretending to be an experienced lover herself.I dock this a star because the second half lagged a bit in my opinion. Plus by the end of this movie you will remember ""Fascination"" as one of the torch songs of the flick or be so tired of it you wish to banish it from your mind forever. Count me in the latter group. On the other hand, the gypsy quartet that Mr. Flanagan hires to ""set the mood"" has some of the best comic moments in the movie.I'm not sure of the name of the actor who plays the husband who Chevalier's character works for at the beginning of the movie, but he was funny as the innocent, bumbling husband who was tricked by Hepburn and Cooper.Surely, this film is probably not the best script that Hepburn had to work with, but it does show her comic gifts.

I had a big kick out of it and I don't understand why some people dislike it.To me, the film is a masterpiece. It succeeds in so many levels like no other romantic comedy. The story is wonderfully acted and told. Intelligent script explores human soul layer after layer- all the silly things we do when we are in love and all the illogical explanations which we make to justify our madness, it is all there. The underlying dramatic theme,that love often breaks our hearts is seasoned with the right dose of humor to provide a pleasant comic relief. The movie is beautifully shot and the music score is to die for. The two leads, Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn have tremendous on-screen chemistry and make a fantastic,fun to watch on-screen couple. The supporting cast and ""The Gypsies"" are pretty amazing too.Gary Cooper is Frank Flannagan, a handsome American, very wealthy, mature and  confirmed bachelor. He likes women, champagne, everything luxurious and lives live to the full. He never gets serious about a relationship. His philosophy is ""Don't get attached. People should always behave as though they were between planes"". A fateful meeting with beautiful, young French Ariane changes  his attitude. She saves his life and they spend together his last afternoon in Paris. He leaves for America and forgets her. She doesn't forget him, she is deeply in love. A year later they meet again and this time he falls for her, but she plays mysterious and elusive, and drives him crazy. Eventually they come together by the end of the film -a beautiful, romantic and memorable end!I really enjoyed the movie and laughed out loud at the many funny scenes. There is one particular scene, where Flannagan, totally obsessed with Ariane and jealous of ""her past"" falls into pieces. He drinks the whole night and listens to Ariane's voice message in which she tells him of her ""itemized list of lovers"". The Gypsies play his favorite music. There are trolleys loaded with alcohol literally ""flying"" forward &backward; between Flannagan and the band, while his playing Ariane's message zillion times forward and backward, and the music starts and stops in the same manner. Hilarious!Gary Cooper's ability to maintain delicate balance between the dramatic and the funny side of the situation is unsurpassable! His age did not bother me the slightest. On the contrary, I thought, at 56 he is still a great actor and strikingly handsome man. His body is lean and well toned , he is wonderful to look at and worthy of love. And as a matter of fact the age difference between Flannagan and Ariane is a crucial point in the story.Gorgeous, classy and talented Audrey Hepburn is delightful to watch. I will never forget her in the final scene. She makes it so moving! Gary Cooper is amazing too. Actually, amazing is understatement. Flannagan is forced to make the toughest decision in his life and he must make it fast, now or never! Cooper has no lines, only a few words for the last five minutes screen time, but his tormented facial expression says it all. I felt his desperation and pain as though, I was on that departing train deciding ""to be or not to be"". The final could have easily become too syrupy but it isn't. There is no sugar-coated dialog and no excessive weeping, and it works magnificently.The message I got from the film is that true love has no age and conquers all. If you are among the few lucky ones who have found their match, surrender completely and enjoy your ""life sentence""!I could keep on writing and marvel about the film but my review is long enough as it is. I hope, I gave you some idea what to expect and I am leaving you now to make your mind up. If you decide to go ahead and see ""Love in the Afternoon"" the chances are you will enjoy two very nice and memorable hours. Seriously, they don't make'em like that anymore!",5,Mesmerizing!

108961,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,0790741121,K. Boullosa,"[8, 16]","Yet another entry (and Wilder's second, counting the equally ludicrously lopsided ""Sabrina"") in the all too familiar transaction, dressed up as an alleged ""fairy tale"", of Old Male Wealth Exchanged for Beautiful Young Female Flesh.And yet again, a great many viewers seem to be all too willing to ignore the elephant in the room: absent his enormous wealth, no one would find even the legendary Gary Cooper appropriate, at 56, plausible as the object of the 18-year-old ingenue's lovesick passion.  In fact, it's Ariane herself who tells us this, as she devours the news clippings about the millionaire playboy's life - it is precisely the lifestyle fueled by Flannigan's wealth that generates those clippings and Ariane's adoring ""fascination"" [sic].Coop certainly looks better in this film than Bogart did as Linus in Wilder's ""Sabrina"", but to say that he looks appropriate as anything but the ""catch of the day"" because of his wealth, is beyond ridiculous.  If anyone is being honest, Cooper looked every bit his age in this film and, as Jimmy Stewart did in ""Bell, Book, and Candle"", Coop realized when he saw the film that this was his swan song as a romantic lead, and somewhat past its sell date, at that.The filmmakers knew it too, and that is why the young Ariane is portrayed as the story's real sexual aggressor. Had Flannigan pursued the virginal, inexperienced Ariane that the audience really knows her to be, everyone would have been revolted, Cooper or no Cooper. And had Flannigan NOT been the millionaire that the audience and her father know him to be, that last scene on the train platform would never have taken place.  How likely is it that Ariane's loving and protective father would have stood by as his only child was swept off in that manner by a man he himself has met only once, and whom he knows to have a long and dishonorable history with women?For the record: the story is, of course, set in Paris.  Private detective Claude Chavasse (Maurice Chevalier) is hired by Monsieur X (a quite funny John McGiver) to follow his wife, whom he suspects is having an affair with renowned American millionaire playboy, Frank Flannigan. When M.X learns that this is, indeed, the case, he pulls out a gun and tells Claude that he plans to break in on the two at Flannigans's suite at the Ritz, and shoot Flannigan.  M.X is overheard by Claude's 18-year-old daughter, Ariane, who for years has been expertly rifling her father's files, which he believed he had kept carefully locked because of the sordid stories they contain.  Ariane has particularly gobbled up the file on Flannigan, in whom she has developed a morbid interest. To her father, Ariane presents the placid face of a young and not very talented musician, but when his back is turned, instead of practicing the cello, she sinks dreamily back into the Flannigan Files.When Ariane hears of M.X's plan, she decides to warn Flannigan, and heads off to his suite at the Ritz where, to the accompaniment of a group of gypsy musicians playing ""Fascination"", Flannigan entertains his conquests.  Sure enough, M.X's wife is there, and, thanks to Ariane's warning, when M.X bursts in, he is mortified to find not his wife on the sofa with Flannigan, but Ariane wearing his wife's little black hat and veil.  But Ariane herself has now caught Flannigan's interest, and fearing that if he knows of her mundane and inexperienced background, she will lose it, Ariane, like a Parisian Scheherezade, begins regaling Flannigan with her own romantic history, which are, in reality, all stories from her father's files, tales of affairs with bullfighters, barons, mountain climbers, bankers, etc.Flannigan has to leave Paris and travel for business, but the following year he comes back to Paris, and Ariane is waiting for him with another set of fictional conquests of her own with which to amuse him.  Throughout the film, despite Flannigan's clear amorous interest and Ariane's adoration of him, we are asked to believe that he never succeeds in actually seducing her.  Ariane refuses even to tell him her name or anything about herself that might allow Flannigan to identify her, and, finally, hooked and desperate, Flannigan ironically hires Ariane's father to trace his elusive ""Thin Girl"".As soon as Chavasse hears the long list of stories that Flannigan's mysterious lady has told him, and Flannigan's description of her, Ariane's father realizes who the lady is.  He tells Flannigan the truth, and asks him not to break his daughter's young heart - ""Such a little fish, Monsieur - throw her back into the water.""The touched and rueful Flannigan agrees to do so, and tells Ariane that he must leave again, without telling her that he now knows who she is.  Ariane comes to the train station to see Flannigan off; reluctant to let him go she runs alongside the train prattling about her lovers even as it begins to pull out, but at the last moment, as unable to part with her as she is with him, Flannigan leans down and pulls Ariane up into the train, calling her by name, as her father watches from a corner of the station.  The viewer hears Chevalier's voice informing the audience that Ariane and Flannigan are married.The song ""Fascination"" plays throughout the film, the theme used by the ubiquitous gypsy musicians whose primary client Flannigan is when he stays in Paris.  The film was written by Wilder and his fabled collaborator, I.A.L. Diamond, who also co-wrote Wilder's ""The Apartment"", and ""Some Like It Hot"" - both better films than this one, in this reviewer's opinion.Hepburn, as always, is hypnotically charming - she gives Ariane an eccentric quality in an effort to offset the essentially sordid nature of her relationship with Flannigan.  Chevalier is Chevalier, no more, no less, as Ariane's detective father.  Cooper is the Great Movie Star doing a nice turn as the bemused object of Ariane's affections.  Nevertheless, just as there were protests about how ""miscast"" Bogart was as the young Hepburn's love interest in ""Sabrina"", there were also murmurs about casting the 56-year-old Cooper as the romantic interest of Hepburn's incredibly young Ariane.  She is supposed to be about 18 years old in this film, living at home with her father, never having had a serious boyfriend, let alone a love affair, and looks as fresh as with the dew still on her.  Yet we are supposed to accept a chronological gap of nearly forty years between these two, without ever factoring in Flannigan's money.The film is certainly sophisticated and funny in places, as we watch Ariane succeed with Flannigan by being elusive, where her more experienced rivals have failed to do so by throwing themselves at him.  But these qualities do not disguise the unpleasant core of the film, which doesn't merely wink, but leers at the staggering age/experience chasm, and asks us to believe that it's all about love, and the nearly 60-year-old man's wealth has nothing to do with the 18-year-old's fascination with him, or her father's tame acceptance of her elopement with a manifestly dissolute serial womanizer.The shallow veneer of ""sophistication"" that Wilder tried to apply to this film can't diguise that it is the same old aging Hollywood director's fantasy: the utterly adorable, unspoiled, gorgeous Young Thing who falls madly in love with the aging, experienced male.  But even Wilder knew that without that bankroll behind his cinematic alter ego's sagging flesh, jowls, spotty hands, and balding head, no one would buy his fantasy.  That Wilder nevertheless tried to have it both ways, and presented the story as if that bankroll was invisible to the audience, was either Wilder's own particular form of denial, or an expression of massive contempt for his audience.Sorry - not buying.",3,"Yes, He WAS Too Old. . .",1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,7764,"['Yet', 'entry', 'Wilder', 'second', 'counting', 'equally', 'ludicrously',

As it is expected from Wilder, it has a taut script where every scene makes the main story stronger and funnier.  The tempo may sometimes be slow during the scenes with no dialogue, but  that is well done because it helps develop the delicate psychology of  seduction by Hepburn and its crumbling effects on Cooper. In this process,  she shows her most impish and mischievous side while not losing her  inherent vulnerability.  A review by Edwin Jahiel (from newsgroup reviews  on the internet movie database) states that this movie is very delicate and  original, and that the public has been sadly and gradually losing its  sophistication since this movie was made.  Here is a quote that I  completely agree with him: &quot;Cooper's unusual, un-rakish ladykiller,  for example, is deemed improbable by some people, yet it adds something new  to the traditional depiction of Don Juans.  Love in the Afternoon has wit,  humor, slapstick, sentiment that never cloys, gags and naughtiness a la  Ernst Lubitsch with whom Wilder had worked and whose major inheritor he  became, though with original creations rather than imitations.&quot;  This  movie should be in any short list of best movies.",5,A Subtle Seduction,946339200,"12 28, 1999",1999,1298,"['same', 'level', 'quot', 'Ninotchka', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ball', 'Fire', 'quot', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'expected', 'Wilder', 'taut', 'script', 'where', 'scene', 'main', 'story', 'stronger', 'funnier', 'tempo', 'may', 'sometimes', 'be', 'slow', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'well', 'done', 'develop', 'delicate', 'psychology', 'seduction', 'Hepburn', 'crumbling', 'effects', 'Cooper', 'process', 'most', 'impish', 'mischievous', 'side', 'not', 'losing', 'inherent', 'vulnerability', 'review', 'Edwin', 'Jahiel', 'newsgroup', 'internet', 'movie', 'database', 'movie', 'very', 'delicate', 'original', 'public', 'been', 'sadly', 'gradually', 'losing', 'sophistication', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Here', 'quote', 'completely', 'agree', 'quot', 'Cooper', 'unusual', 'un-rakish', 'ladykiller', 'example', 'deemed', 'improbable', 'people', 'something', 'new', 'traditional', 'depiction', 'Don', 'Juans', 'Love', 'Afternoon', 'wit', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'sentiment', 'never', 'gags', 'naughtiness', 'la', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'whom', 'Wilder', 'had', 'worked', 'major', 'inheritor', 'became', 'original', 'creations', 'rather', 'imitations.', 'quot', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'short', 'list', 'best', 'movies']",N/A

First, the age differences between the two characters is a bit disturbing. Cooper looks every bit of his 56 years, while Hepburn looks like a college freshman. Second, couldn't the worldly Cooper tell that virginal Hepburn wasn't the flighty woman she claimed to be?  Third, I was also disturbed by the ""happily ever after"" ending. Maybe my tastes are a little superior to this film (I much more prefer the ending to ""Roman Holiday,"" a much better romantic comedy), but I simply could not swallow the final scene.

The first half plays like tired Parisian boulevard comedy, with little spark or interest, despite Wilder's direction and screenplay and the presence of Gary Cooper, Maurice Chevalier and especially the always delightful Audrey Hepburn. In the second half, however, the film's wit becomes sharper, and its emotion deeper. That's because Wilder, that sly old fox, allows the film to build as its characters' emotions change, and expects the audience to have the patience to sit still and watch.I don't understand the general criticism of this film, that Cooper was too old for Hepburn. It was typical throughout Hepburn's early career to pair her with much older leading men (Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, William Holden, Fred Astaire) who brought her delicate, pensive, Cinderella qualities out in bas-relief. Hepburn has better chemistry with Cooper than she did with the notoriously prickly Bogart in an earlier Wilder film, ""Sabrina,"" and--as other reviewers have noted--Wilder has some pointed fun with both Cooper's age and his well-deserved offscreen reputation as a womanizer. Notice that Wilder doesn't shoot Cooper in close-up until the last half-hour of the film, bringing his wrinkles and his general air of exhaustion to the forefront. This has great power, for it shows the previously carefree playboy in all his world-weariness, finally ready to admit that one woman has irrevocably won his heart.Much of ""Love in the Afternoon"" isn't as good as it should be, but the last half--and particularly the last five minutes--make the film worthwhile.

Yes, there was a large age gap in Funny Face between Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire, ,and while it was distracting, it didn't sink the movie.  Later Cary Grant would also play against a much younger Audrey Hepburn.  But he's Cary Grant and he can do anything.  Besides, he was playing across a grown and sophisticated Audrey Hepburn.

108979,A1CJ85IQ8APT89,0790741121,Shell-Zee,"[1, 1]","I'll try not to avoid the obvious comparisons with Billy Wilder's other romantic comedy, starring Audrey Hepburn; ""Sabrina"" which also delt with the preverbal May-September romance. I find ""Sabrina"" to be infinitly more interesting than Love In The Afternoon. For one it also involves the added element of a love triangle, one literately based on sibling rivalry. And of course it's almost impossible to shy away from the Cooper-Bogart comparisons. Bogart's character, Lienus Laribee, the capitalist international tycoon is far more intrigueing than Cooper's, rich devil may care playboy. Bogart is not only more serious about his role in preserving his position and wealth, he's simply more believable. Cooper had of course played so many homespun heroes like Lou Gerig, Sgt. York and Mr. Deeds, that it was hard for audiences to buy the middle aged hell raising swinger the role called for.There are yet more comparisons in both of these Wilder comedies. How about the role of the long suffering fathers to the hopelessly love struck, naive innocent child, Arianne/Sabrina. Indeed both actors are oscar worthy. Remember the great line by Farchild (John Williams); ""Sabrina is a poor misplaced child. She doesn't belong in a mansion and she doesn't quite fit in a Chauffeur's apartment either"". Arianne is just as misplaced as the meddling daughter of a Parisian private detective played with great charm by the inimitable, Maurice Chevalier. Why even the songs, ""Fascination"" and ""La Vie En Rose"" play an enormous part in creating that special atmosphere, that classic Wilder enchantment. In fact the gypsy musicans add more than just atmosphere. They're quite funny, almost scene stealers. They even accomany Gary Cooper while at the Turkish bath. In the end the May-September lovers are swept off to Happily-Ever-After, one couple aboard a trans-Atlantic luxury liner (Sabrina) and the other a very touching scene at the most romatic of all venues, the railway station platfom. Had Gary Cooper not swept Miss Hepburn onboard his rail car, she would have run clear to Lyon reciting her imaginary list of love conquests.There you have it, two very fine romantic comedies by the master himself, Billy Wilder. Sabrina, the far better script. Love In The Afternoon, a charming little movie whose only real short fall is its somewhat one diminsional plot. While I've enjoyed repeated viewings of Sabrina, I doubt I'll find the urge to come back to Love In The Afternoon, other than to watch Audrey Hepburn's throughly delightful performance. For without her charm there would be little reason to invest ninety minutes sitting in the dark on this one. Bravo Miss Hepburn. Thank you for your smile, your innocence, your vulnerabilty and your lovely voice.
