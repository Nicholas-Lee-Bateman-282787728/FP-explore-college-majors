I taped it the next time, but the TV channel cut so much of the movie that it no longer made sense.  I have had this movie on my wish list with Amazon since forever, and today when I got the email that it was available, I immediately ordered it.  I know that Amazon will come through for the first reviewer, and she will get her movie.

I thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen--a wonderful story!--and of course wanted to see it again but couldn't. After many years, I learned I could purchase old movies on Amazon, looked for it, found it and ordered it! I'm so excited to be able to see it again and share it with friends. Beau Bridges is such a fine actor and person and SO HANDSOME as a young man!!(When I was a kid, I loved his father in Sea Hunt, and his other son, Jeff, is also one of my favorite actors!). The acting in Adam's Woman was superb--all of the actors give excellent performances. The only criticism I have about the movie is that I didn't ever see any kangaroos, crocodiles, or Aborigines, or any wildlife; I found that kinda weird for a movie about Australia, filmed in Australia. Aside from that, a GREAT movie, great love story!",5,A Beautiful Movie,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,895,"['saw', 'Adam', 'Woman', 'chance', 'TV', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'VCRs', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'wonderful', 'story', 'course', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", 'many', 'years', 'learned', 'could', 'purchase', 'old', 'movies', 'Amazon', 'looked', 'found', 'ordered', ""'m"", 'so', 'excited', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'again', 'share', 'friends', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'such', 'fine', 'actor', 'person', 'SO', 'HANDSOME', 'young', 'man', 'When', 'was', 'kid', 'loved', 'father', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'other', 'son', 'Jeff', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'acting', 'Adam', 'Woman', 'was', 'superb', 'actors', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'only', 'criticism', 'have', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'see', 'kangaroos', 'crocodiles', 'Aborigines', 'wildlife', 'found', 'kinda', 'weird', 'movie', 'Australia', 'filmed', 'Australia', 'Aside', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'great', 'love', 'story']",N/A
1389440,A30AO4GE5HC7M3,B0049IHWPU,Jenilyn,"[0, 0]","This 1970's movie is outdated but worth the time to watch. The storyline is interesting and depicts the settlement of Australia by convicts. Beau Bridges and Jane Merrow portray two convicts who volunteer for an experiment to settle the Australian outback. Their performance is believable and their interaction is humorous as well as romantic. If you don't expect all the bells and whistles of current day films, you will enjoy this tale and the characters who bring you the story.",3,Outdated But Worth The Time,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,481,"['1970', 'movie', 'outdated', 'time', 'watch', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'settlement', 'Australia', 'convicts', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Jane', 'Merrow', 'portray', 'two', 'convicts', 'who', 'volunteer', 'experiment', 'settle', 'Australian', 'outback', 'performance', 'believable', 'interaction', 'humorous', 'as', 'well', 'romantic', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'bells', 'whistles', 'current', 'day', 'films', 'will', 'enjoy', 'tale', 'characters', 'who', 'bring', 'story']",N/A

Two scarred individuals given a chance of a new life, by the governor, played by the great John Mills, if they're willing to marry and work the bush as settlers.Bridges' character promises Merrow's that he plans to eventually escape away and get back to America, and she can keep the homestead, i.e., strictly business and no love lost.  She goes along with it, and both find mutual respect and perhaps love after struggling to make a go at it with the land, bandits and their past.There's a lot to this movie.  Set in the Botany Bay days, when Australia did allow convicts to work and promote the land.  Not kid friendly, probalby PG-13.  There's a fair amount of sexual situations, attempted rape and suggestiveness; although, nothing's really shown.  (There is one nude, rear shot while bathing seen through some bushes.)Basically, this is a love story about two miserable beat upon people with deep down worth that find themselves getting beyond their hurt, maturing, discovering the need for each other and their place in the world.I can hardly believe this film is over 40 years old.  Where does time go.  It holds it age fairly well.  The music features several ballads to match the movie, typical for the late 60's/early 70's; the supporting cast and location shots are very good, and there's a satisfactory ending.Long lost, rarely known by most, but not forgotten by some of us older romantics, I'm glad it's available.
