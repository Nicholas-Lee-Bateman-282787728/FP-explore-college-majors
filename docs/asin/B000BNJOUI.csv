945516,AYS76OJTHVY1K,B000BNJOUI,A,"[1, 1]","A lot of people complain about the documentary on disk one.  Well, it's actually kind of interesting, although not very informative (it's 84 minuets long).  The best parts show the band in the studio recording voulume 3.But honestly, if you just forget about disk #1, and watch disk #2 first, you will realize that with this DVD set, you're getting an awsome bargain.The concert is Awsome.  Each song (10 of them, if you include the music vid. for ""the Nameless"") is taken from a different concert from a different part of the world.  While Duality (from Japan) sounds not-so-great, the rest of the tracks are amazing. The concert starts off with ""(Sic)"" and then ""The Blister Exists"".  The band actually speeds up the tempo a lot for these songs but amazingly, they still play them perfectly tight.  I was blown-away.For what you'll pay for this item, it would be worth it if it was just a live DVD.But theres more:  Disk 2 also contains all the videos from the volume 3 album (very cool).Finally, on disk 2, you get short interviws of every single member of the band un-masked.  (although if you're not too familiar with the band, you might not realize which member plays which instrument).  Each interview was about 6 or 7 minuets long and they answere some very interesting questions.  You get a real insight into the personalities of the members, and even in particaular case, watch one of them interviewed as he plays golf in Iowa.  I've never see the band like this before on any of the other DVD's, and I own every single one of them.I should note that I bought this item used, which was a damn good move, since I got it for half price and it's in perfect contition.Don't listen to the people complainting about this DVD (thank God I didn't).  I don't know what else they were expecting.",5,"Great DVD, worth it for the concert alone.",1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,1795,"['lot', 'people', 'complain', 'documentary', 'disk', 'one', 'Well', 'actually', 'kind', 'interesting', 'not', 'very', 'informative', '84', 'minuets', 'long', 'best', 'parts', 'show', 'band', 'studio', 'recording', 'voulume', '3.But', 'honestly', 'just', 'forget', 'disk', '1', 'watch', 'disk', '2', 'first', 'will', 'realize', 'DVD', 'set', ""'re"", 'getting', 'awsome', 'bargain.The', 'concert', 'Awsome', 'song', '10', 'include', 'music', 'vid', 'Nameless', 'taken', 'different', 'concert', 'different', 'part', 'world', 'Duality', 'Japan', 'not-so-great', 'rest', 'tracks', 'are', 'amazing', 'concert', 'Sic', 'then', 'Blister', 'Exists', 'band', 'actually', 'up', 'tempo', 'lot', 'songs', 'amazingly', 'still', 'play', 'perfectly', 'tight', 'was', 'blown-away.For', 'what', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'item', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'just', 'live', 'DVD.But', 'more', 'Disk', '2', 'also', 'videos', 'volume', '3', 'album', 'very', 'cool', '.Finally', 'disk', '2', 'get', 'short', 'interviws', 'single', 'member', 'band', 'un-masked', ""'re"", 'not', 'too', 'familiar', 'band', 'might', 'not', 'realize', 'member', 'plays', 'instrument', 'interview', 'was', '6', '7', 'minuets', 'long', 'answere', 'very', 'interesting', 'questions', 'get', 'real', 'insight', 'personalities', 'members', 'even', 'particaular', 'case', 'watch', 'one', 'interviewed', 'golf', 'Iowa', ""'ve"", 'never', 'see', 'band', 'other', 'DVD', 'own', 'single', 'one', 'them.I', 'should', 'note', 'bought', 'item', 'used', 'was', 'damn', 'good', 'move', 'got', 'half', 'price', 'perfect', 'contition.Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'people', 'complainting', 'DVD', 'God', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'were', 'expecting']",N/A

There are so many special effects in the movie it makes you want to puke. If you were tripping it would probably make a good movie LOL. I thought it was rather boring. The only good thing was the music videos. As for the live concert footage there wasn't much to show just little pieces edited together. I would not recommend this video.

Disc1 is without a doubt the stupidest piece of[..]Ive ever seen.  Why did i pay to watch some no-name idiot band roadie/hanger-on chug Jager and puke.  Or watch someone else unclog a toilet, Im not kidding thats how this thing opens.  Watching someone take a piss up close, or watching thier security goons beat up a fan half thier size, is this supposed to be ""hardcore"" or ""heavy""??  The audio is terrible, you cant even tell what song is being played.  I think this was put together as an art project by Saint Marys School for the Deaf and Blind. Disc2 (almost) makes up for it with interviews and videos but I'm very disappointed in the ""feature"".  Shame on you Slipknot, you pride yourself in not exploiting your fans and you unleash this steaming heap on us.  So I have to say, I loved Disasterpieces, but I will NEVER buy another Slipknot DVD.

945522,A389B5YYA5J8HE,B000BNJOUI,"Stevo ""Future Oscar Winner""","[1, 1]","Long story short, this isn't the documentary I was hoping to see.  Instead, we got a ""documentary"" of 90 minutes of various clips of everything from urine going into a toilet to a crew member vomiting after a night of drinking.  I kept thinking that after a few minutes that the weird various clips would stop and we'd get to the story, but it never happened.  90 minutes of 20 second snippets of clips of odds and ends that are never labeled, never explained.There ARE some gems, though.  Such as rehearsal footage of ""Vermillion"" from Rick Rubin's Haunted Houdini Mansion of a recording studio, a view of Joey's rotating live drum solo (from a camera mounted on the front of his kit), and various comments from band members.Shawn ""Clown"" Crahan is responsible for this charade, and recently said in ""Revolver"" magazine that he was inspired by Harmony Korine's film ""Gummo"", with its jarring edits and quirky cinematogrophy.  Good for you, bad for us.  It's the type of thing you'll only watch once, if you can get through it.Disc 2 has the great live performances, on par with the ""Disasterpieces"" DVD.  The real gem of this set is the interviews with the band members (all but ""133"", who says nothing, as usual), unmasked, and candid.  It really reveals how ordinary some of them are--Paul, for example, could be a stoner friend of mine.  Jim Root is seriously sporting the James Hetfield look here, complete with the horn-rimmed glasses.  This is the guy banging Cristina Scabbia?The menus are a joke and a pain, nothing labeled, nothing making sense.  I eventually just started pushing buttons trying to get SOMETHING to come up.  It reminded me of Korn's ""Deuce"" DVD, with it's absurd ""Asylum"" menu system.Avoid this unless you are a die hard fan.  Buy the albums instead.  They really had a chance here to show us something, and they decided to keep the masks on, figuratively speaking.  This doesn't really show us anything ""inside the Nine"", except for the interviews on Disc 2, which doesn't reveal much.  What a bummer.",2,"Ugh.
