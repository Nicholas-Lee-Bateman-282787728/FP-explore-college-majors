Be advised that you will probably get a partially crushed or broken case.  I ordered this item and it arrived in an undamaged box, as did the next two that were sent as replacents, so I doubt it was a shipping problem.  My guess is that all the &#34;new&#34; copies of this were damaged before shipping.  Amazon immediately shipped each replacement and the representative was all I could ask for.",2,Good content but very fragile case,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,508,"['content', 'dvd', 'great', 'case', 'very', 'fragile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'replaced', 'due', 'construction', 'Be', 'advised', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'partially', 'crushed', 'broken', 'case', 'ordered', 'item', 'arrived', 'undamaged', 'box', 'did', 'next', 'two', 'were', 'sent', 'replacents', 'doubt', 'was', 'shipping', 'problem', 'guess', '34', 'new', '34', 'copies', 'were', 'damaged', 'shipping', 'Amazon', 'immediately', 'shipped', 'replacement', 'representative', 'was', 'could', 'ask']",The Best of Bizarre: Uncensored Vols. 1 - 10
1102082,A3LGJXCN189ALH,B000VJ3E58,Early A. Dopter,"[6, 8]","Got a great price for a new set of the entire series.  Two reviewers loved it and one hates it.  All my life I've been surrounded by people who love ""comedy"" that I can't stand, and never heard of some of my favorite stuff (e.g., Dangerfield movie ""Meet Wally Sparks""), let alone disliked it..  No way am I not going to take a chance of something that's odd and two people loved.  The guy who hates it may be right, but comedy is too important to let other people cut me off from it.  If I don't like it, I'll stop watching.  The upside vs the downside is worth more than the $30 I'm paying.  Nobody tells me what's funny -- I decide.Will update after watching.----Saw my comment today and realized I have a duty to watch this.  It's over 2 1/2 years since I bought it and I just gave it about 15 minutes and it's awful.  I love comedy -- hey, everybody loves comedy -- but I can't explain why stuff many find funny I find lame.  The first time we see the host, he does an Ed Sullivan impersonation, and things go downhill from there.  The sketches I've seen play as typewritten -- may look funny on paper, but not as performed.  Well, you can't argue about this.  In case you're wondering, I have enjoyed hundreds of comedy films going back to the silent era, and went mad about SCTV.  But what can you do about taste? I never liked Ghostbusters.",2,Just order it and I'll tell you why,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,1347,"['Got', 'great', 'price', 'new', 'set', 'entire', 'series', 'Two', 'reviewers', 'loved', 'one', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'surrounded', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'never', 'heard', 'favorite', 'stuff', 'e.g.', 'Dangerfield', 'movie', 'Meet', 'Wally', 'Sparks', 'let', 'alone', 'disliked', 'it..', 'way', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'take', 'chance', 'something', 'odd', 'two', 'people', 'loved', 'guy', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'comedy', 'too', 'important', 'let', 'other', 'people', 'cut', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'watching', 'upside', 'vs', 'downside', 'more', '30', ""'m"", 'paying', 'Nobody', 'what', 'funny', 'decide.Will', 'update', 'watching.', 'Saw', 'comment', 'today', 'realized', 'have', 'duty', 'watch', '2', '1/2', 'years', 'bought', 'just', 'gave', '15', 'minutes', 'awful', 'love', 'comedy', 'hey', 'everybody', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'stuff', 'many', 'find', 'funny', 'find', 'lame', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'host', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'impersonation', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'there', 'sketches', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'typewritten', 'may', 'look', 'funny', 'paper', 'not', 'performed', 'Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'hundreds', 'comedy', 'films', 'going', 'back', 'silent', 'era', 'went', 'mad', 'SCTV', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'taste', 'never', 'liked', 'Ghostbusters']",The Best of Bizarre: Uncensored Vols. 1 - 10
1102083,A15B21IPSXCPXH,B000VJ3E58,Explorator,"[33, 33]","Bizarre was a comedy series that ran for 6 seasons on Showtime in the early 80s and featured outrageous politically incorrect humor with occasional nude scenes. It was unusually HILARIOUS! Very few shows can actually rip the laugh right out of you but Bizarre is one of those rare excellent comedy shows that does it more often than just about any other comedy show. Fans of SNL, SCTV and similar shows are in for a real shock if they check out this series. Bizarre had many more GREAT sketches than not, and in my opinion none of them are awful. The charming dimwit stuntman 'Super Dave' got his start in this series and his funniest stunts are in these episodes. Also another comedy sketch classic 'The Bigots' (a family of broad 'ethnic diversity' who continuously hurl slurs at each other) are featured in many of these episodes. Each disc contains 4 hours of episodes (they are dual layer so the picture quality is very good)! This is the way DVD collections should be done! Any comedy fan who wants to laugh till they cry will LOVE this collection!",5,ONE OF THE FUNNIEST SHOWS EVER!
