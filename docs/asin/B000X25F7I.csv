1113146,ACI2YHHDAB8UC,B000X25F7I,"GuanajaSharon ""Appreciator of Arts""","[1, 2]","First of all, I am not a prudish person but I am getting a bit tired of HBO deciding that the only word worth repeating over and over in the English language is the ""F"" word.  It seems their characters, be it in Deadwood or The Wire have an obsession with this word and can't seem to talk intelligently without it.While the acting in both series was excellent and the story line was intriguing, trying to figure out what the characters were actually saying in ""The Wire"" was a real challenge.  I realize that people in the ghetto speak their own language but, frankly, I fail to appreciate the fact that people who have responsible positions in society (the police in all their positions)also cannot get past using constant ""gutter"" language.  It assails my ears and, frankly, I may be naive in believeing that surely all people in higher positions do not feel the need to use gutter language throughout the day.As in Deadwood (and I do not agree with those who created this series, that this was the everyday language of the people in Deadwood at that time), even though the story line was interesting, the acting well done (outside the fact that certain characters couldn't say a sentence without every third word being ""F____"")I stopped buying the series so as to get on to something entertaining but less assailing to my ears!I doubt I will spend any more money on The Wire, as I watch movies for my own pleasure and to give me release from a busy day and, yes, quiet possibly to have a point made without a lot of potty mouth!",3,"The Wire - As in, walk the line!",1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,1531,"['First', 'am', 'not', 'prudish', 'person', 'am', 'getting', 'bit', 'tired', 'HBO', 'deciding', 'only', 'word', 'repeating', 'English', 'language', 'F', 'word', 'characters', 'be', 'Deadwood', 'Wire', 'have', 'obsession', 'word', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'talk', 'intelligently', 'acting', 'series', 'was', 'excellent', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'intriguing', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'actually', 'saying', 'Wire', 'was', 'real', 'challenge', 'realize', 'people', 'ghetto', 'speak', 'own', 'language', 'frankly', 'fail', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'responsible', 'positions', 'society', 'police', 'positions', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'using', 'constant', 'gutter', 'language', 'ears', 'frankly', 'may', 'be', 'naive', 'believeing', 'surely', 'people', 'higher', 'positions', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'need', 'use', 'gutter', 'language', 'day.As', 'Deadwood', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'who', 'created', 'series', 'was', 'everyday', 'language', 'people', 'Deadwood', 'time', 'even', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'interesting', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'fact', 'certain', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'sentence', 'third', 'word', 'being', 'F____', 'stopped', 'buying', 'series', 'so', 'get', 'something', 'entertaining', 'less', 'assailing', 'ears', 'doubt', 'will', 'spend', 'more', 'money', 'Wire', 'watch', 'movies', 'own', 'pleasure', 'give', 'release', 'busy', 'day', 'yes', 'quiet', 'possibly', 'have', 'point', 'made', 'lot', 'potty', 'mouth']",The Wire - Seasons 1-4

This was before cable and the good stuff; 'Naked City', The Twilight Zone', etc., was few and far between, it always depressed me that the medium wasn't better used to enlighten the masses.  All that wasted potential.Fast forward to 2002...'The Wire', I didn't have HBO, I'd heard about The Sopranos, Sex and the City, OZ...good, but not really my cup.  Fortunately, my wife's collegue loaned her season one...wow...I haven't been the same since.  My faith in the possibilities has been restored.  Let there be no doubt, this is the best television series...EVER.  Many have said that on this page, it is not hype, while they changed a few names 'to protect the innocent', anyone, like myself, who has lived in the Washington-Baltimore region know who the players are.  Truly, this is a sociological study for our times, Baltimore is simply the microcosm...America is in critical condition and the prognosis is not good.

Well, it is pretty depressing, but it is also a wrenchingly honest depiction of inner city dysfunction that pulls few punches. It is also well acted, beautifully shot and directed and it is both illuminating and riveting. What else produced for the small screen can make those claims? Nothing else that I know of.I could go on and on, but the short of it is this - see it. See it because seeing it helps you understand how bad it really is - the various worlds that The Wire is depicting. And while it is a gloomy view - how could it not be and still be honest - it is also peopled by such a wide array of characters many of whom are so wonderful that when all is said and done the show does not screech -""GIVE UP"" but rather ""PAY ATTENTION.""And what does it depict: the ugly innards of bureaucracy; the extraordinary cultural malignancy that dominates so much of inner-city American life; the incredible obstacles confronting anyone who truly wants to make a difference; the cameraderie that develops when good people get together and really try; the hardship that will visit those who speak truthfully when few really want to hear the truth; the enormous wasted talent and energy of those who ravage our urban communities with their drugging and their vacuous violence and promiscuity; and the strange and perverse allure of it all.As others have pointed out, Season Two is the weak link (I have not yet seen Season Five but I surely will.) but see it all.

It's easy for me to explain why so many other shows are poorly made.  I wish it was easy to explain what makes The Wire so good.It is violent, and season 4, because it deals with children, is very depressing.  Everyone I meet, I ask them , have you seen it?  And I ask them, 'what else do you think is as good as The Wire?'  Perhaps there are shows I've missed.
