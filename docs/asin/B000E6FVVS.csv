Most any mortal would be impressed by Andy's monstrous music knowledge, but, unfortunately, on this DVD, Andy kinda downplays the Police and instead made an ultra advanced jazz clinic.PROS:* Talks about/illustrates his unorthodox approach to chords within the pop genre* Teaches the progressions to a few police hits (probably the ones he contributed to most, since we know Sting developed most of Police's core song ideas) and even plays cool live segments of them with his most recent trioCONS:* Most of the material is extremely advanced jazz and discussed as if he were talking to advanced players* Andy's guitar has no dots/fret markers, so watching him play on-screen is relatively useless (fortunately, a booklet is included)* He also has an annoying habit of monotone grunting while he plays...fine for stage, but not good for close proximity instruction",3,some basic pop...& tons of ultra advanced jazz,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,907,"['bought', ""'m"", 'big', 'Police', 'fan', 'Most', 'mortal', 'would', 'be', 'impressed', 'Andy', 'monstrous', 'music', 'knowledge', 'unfortunately', 'DVD', 'Andy', 'kinda', 'Police', 'instead', 'made', 'ultra', 'advanced', 'jazz', 'clinic.PROS', '*', 'Talks', 'unorthodox', 'approach', 'chords', 'pop', 'genre*', 'Teaches', 'progressions', 'few', 'police', 'hits', 'probably', 'ones', 'contributed', 'most', 'know', 'Sting', 'developed', 'most', 'Police', 'core', 'song', 'ideas', 'even', 'plays', 'cool', 'live', 'segments', 'most', 'recent', 'trioCONS', '*', 'Most', 'material', 'extremely', 'advanced', 'jazz', 'discussed', 'were', 'talking', 'advanced', 'players*', 'Andy', 'guitar', 'dots/fret', 'markers', 'so', 'watching', 'play', 'on-screen', 'relatively', 'useless', 'fortunately', 'booklet', 'included', '*', 'also', 'annoying', 'habit', 'monotone', 'grunting', 'fine', 'stage', 'not', 'good', 'close', 'proximity', 'instruction']",Andy Summers: Guitar

For the most part I have enjoyed all of them to one extent or another.  But this one really stands out, and it does so for a number of reasons.  Andy Summers has a very good point to make regarding ""interesting"" chords and chord progressions -- with a ""twist of lemon"" as he likes to say.  In talking about his Jazz background he mentions the quick tempo chord changes that don't always let one fully appreciate the character of the more complex harmonies that there are to be heard.  The entire first section is dedicated to a chord library that has numerous variations on harmonies that most guitarists have probably never considered.  It is doubtful that anyone will use all of these.  But it is likely that any guitarist, even a lazy hack like myself, will be interested enough to pick up a guitar a learn a few of these and find a use for.  Many of the chords are finger exercises in themselves, which also makes them useful.There is a section devoted to his years with the Police.  Though most of us probably managed to learn the Police standards when growing up it is worth while listening to him talk about his approach to the songs. I was interested to hear him talk about how few guitarists can really play a straight 4 by themselves.  It's also quite interesting to hear him talk about his years with the Police.  He almost sounds like he's apologizing for them.  Which is interesting because he appeared, in 1997 when this was shot, to be something of a British schoolmaster behind a green hollow-body electric guitar speaking cautiously, and almost hesitantly about the songs being what he used to do. All this was well before the Police went on reunion tour in 2006 -- go figure.There are also several of Summers' solo works which are worth listening to.  In both sections he alternates explanations with a studio band performance, that's usually quite good.  Most of the time he is playing a Gibson 335 and the tone is superb.Fan of Summers or not, this is one to check out.

969998,A75W8I0OLFBD6,B000E6FVVS,"Simms ""DOC""","[2, 2]","I've been slaving over Andy's DVD for few months; I can tell you that nothing is like learning it from the Icon himself. I know just a few simple chords and not even good at them to be honest, know no scales. I like music writings and I wish I could read them but I can't. Anyhow, I started with ""Message in the bottle"", (so, I identified with), picked it up quick as novice as I was. ""It was in the air"" and went right into my head, I slaved over it more, as painful as it was to my fingers, wrist and arm, it was enjoyable to me, hearing what I was playing. In the meantime, I started on ""Roxanne"" (another so, I identified with), I can tell you, now, I play that too, at least most of it. I admit I got room for improvent and it's been great with his DVD. Now, I am working on ""Every breath you take"", another classic song. It's not easy, not a walk in a park by a long shot for a semi beginner like me, but, like Andy said, ""You either got it or you don't"", and I feel like I do. So I bought an old no name electric guitar with a very old Peavey amp for a $100 at a flea market, that's all I could afford. My advice to anyone especially if you're a beginner is, do not get disappointed by the long stretches, like Andy said it is a good practice for your fingers. It strengthens your digits, wrist and arm muscles and tendons, you just got to be patient and resilient like I was as a beginner or novice.Oh yes, I did buy his book, more on that later. For $5 more it is definately worth it, also makes your purchase over $25 and shipping will be free. Just a suggestion!""EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE"" - Ok here's what I began to understand from the triads in every breath you take intro. It's covering a stretch of 5 frets  with three fingers, keeping two fingers on the same  frets while alternating a third finger to form a transition from triad to diad and back depending on the beat (INDEX FINGER MAY FUZZ A LITTLE IN THE BEGINNING BUT IT'LL EVENTUALLY PASS WITH PRACTICE). I still can't tell the notes but sure it's nice plan.more on this later.",5,NOTHING IS LIKE LEARNING IT FROM THE ICON HIMSELF!,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,2046,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'slaving', 'Andy', 'DVD', 'few', 'months', 'can', 'tell', 'nothing', 'learning', 'Icon', 'know', 'just', 'few', 'simple', 'chords', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'be', 'honest', 'know', 'scales', 'like', 'music', 'writings', 'wish', 'could', 'read', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Anyhow', 'started', 'Message', 'bottle', 'so', 'identified', 'picked', 'up', 'quick', 'as', 'novice', 'was', 'was', 'air', 'went', 'right', 'head', 'slaved', 'more', 'as', 'painful', 'was', 'fingers', 'wrist', 'arm', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'hearing', 'what', 'was', 'playing', 'meantime', 'started', 'Roxanne', 'so', 'identified', 'can', 'tell', 'now', 'play', 'too', 'least', 'most', 'admit', 'got', 'room', 'improvent', 'been', 'great', 'DVD', 'Now', 'am', 'working', 'Every', 'breath', 'take', 'classic', 'song', 'not', 'easy', 'not', 'walk', 'park', 'long', 'shot', 'semi', 'beginner', 'Andy', 'said', 'got', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'do', 'So', 'bought', 'old', 'name', 'electric', 'guitar', 'very', 'old', 'Peavey', 'amp', '100', 'flea', 'market', 'could', 'afford', 'advice', 'anyone', 'especially', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'disappointed', 'long', 'stretches', 'Andy', 'said', 'good', 'practice', 'fingers', 'digits', 'wrist', 'arm', 'muscles', 'tendons', 'just', 'got', 'be', 'patient', 'resilient', 'was', 'beginner', 'novice.Oh', 'yes', 'did', 'buy', 'book', 'more', 'later', '5', 'more', 'definately', 'worth', 'also', 'purchase', '25', 'shipping', 'will', 'be', 'free', 'Just', 'suggestion', 'EVERY', 'BREATH', 'YOU', 'TAKE', 'Ok', 'here', 'what', 'began', 'understand', 'triads', 'breath', 'take', 'intro', 'covering', 'stretch', '5', 'frets', 'three', 'fingers', 'keeping', 'two', 'fingers', 'same', 'frets', 'alternating', 'third', 'finger', 'form', 'transition', 'triad', 'diad', 'back', 'depending', 'beat', 'INDEX', 'FINGER', 'MAY', 'FUZZ', 'A', 'LITTLE', 'IN', 'THE', 'BEGINNING', 'BUT', 'IT', ""'LL"", 'EVENTUALLY', 'PASS', 'WITH', 'PRACTICE', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'notes', 'sure', 'nice', 'plan.more', 'later']",Andy Summers: Guitar
