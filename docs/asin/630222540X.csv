I watched it again last night and found it was still as entertaining as the first time I saw it. Good cast, story, effects, and music make it a good buy. The scary thing with this movie is the reality factor. Considering the problems we have had with foreign relations, drug cartels, and the Virginia Tech incident with Cho, you have to give this story some credibility. I had forgot Ermey was in this, so it was a pleasant surprise. Astin and Gossett turn in great performances. I like this movie because it takes regular students and shows how their ingenuity and determination helps them to save all but one student from terrorist.

Anytime it comes on TV i watch it, I own it on VHS, I saw three times in the theatre.  Now I can finally own it on DVD.The movie takes place in a Prep School for misfit boys.  Sean Astin leads a motley crew of bad boys who try to save their school and their friends from a group of Columbian terrorists.  He is joined by Will Wheaton and Keith Coogan as two of his friends and Louis Gossett Jr. as the schools headmaster.  Astin and his friends come up with a masterful plan to create a landscape of diversions to allow Billy (Astin) to escape the grounds just long enough to deliver schematics of the guns, drawing of the terrorists and where they are placed.  He must then make it back in time for roll call or his classmates will be killed.

302486,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,630222540X,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 5]","Well, when I was a kid you had the Hardy Boys, but by the 90s even the updated Hardys (no more tooling around in 'roadsters') were pretty passe.  TOY SOLDIERS has been described as a teen version of DIE HARD, and filmmaker Daniel Petrie was certainly savvy enough to realize that since it was largely that very age group that was responsible for the success of high action films starring macho actors approaching (if not already well into) middle age, how could he go wrong if he adhered to the basic formula but made his heroes rebellious teens instead of wiseacre adults?And for what it is, it does work.  Younger viewers are not likely to realize how derivative and formulaic this movie about terrorists taking over a private school for rebellious kids really is.  TOY SOLDIERS is definitely a teen film for the 90s (and beyond) in its relatively frank use of profanity, casual mentions of masturbation and its depiction of a prank phone call to an adult service.  Contemporary teens will likely find this an ""authentic"" touch.  Their parents may be surprised--and some a bit disconcerted--to see how far beyond the Hardy Boys we've come.  Frank and Joe never used the ""F"" word.But some things never do change, and the film's basic appeal to young viewers is the same as that of boys' action adventure tales from time immemorial.  Or at least as long as there have been boys' action adventure stories.  The fantasy of kids being able to competently and heroically maneuvre in the adult world will always hold an appeal for younger audiences.

302490,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,630222540X,Jason,"[0, 0]","Toy Soldiers is one of those awesome 80s movies that didn't try to wow the audience with believability.  It's a good thing; too, because the formula used is a complete winner.  It is just underdogs versus villains, precocious American teens defeating a vastly superior foreign enemy; it's the in-school suspension version ofRed Dawn.The film centers on a prep school, Regis, and a group of unruly friends led by Billy Tepper (Astin), who has been kicked out of multiple schools before this one.  Along with friends Joey Trotta (Wheaton), a mobster's son; Keith Coogan (Bradberry), the artist; Ricardo Montoya (Perez), the translator; and Hank Giles (Russell), the token.  Together they form the school's upper-class leadership, the guys with the best pranks and Listerine-vodka, the admired school celebrities.  Along the way they must match wits with Edward Parker (Gossett, Jr.), the tough-love approach Dean who serves as a mentor.When the school is taken over by South American terrorists who are armed to the teeth with machine guns, explosives, and ransom demands, guess which kids just happen to be part of VERY wealthy and very influential families, and therefore important in the ransom plot?  Naturally, the Regis ""Rejects"" pause from zit popping to bravely band together and concoct a plan that may as well have been hatched in the Mystery Machine.  Somehow, however, despite the fact that their plan requires the theft of a military HMMWV, and hinges upon a remote controlled UFO/plane hybrid owned by a kid named ""Yogurt,"" the surrounding military and Parker agree that it's probably the best bet for success.  You can't make this stuff up.From beginning to end, this movie is enjoyable.  The acting is top-notch, and head terrorist Luis Cali - portrayed convincingly by Andrew Divoff - should get more attention for his fine work.  Once the first act is over the direction doesn't allow for a dull moment the rest of the way.  Great action, funny situations, heck, even the score is memorable.  The only egregious flaw in this movie is the casting of pipe-cleaner thin Will Wheaton as a tough mobster son.  If there is a worse casting misfire in Hollywood history I'd like to see it.This is a textbook, classic version of enjoyable, completely unbelievable movie.  It's right up there with Red Dawn andIron Eagle(in which Louis Gossett, Jr. also stars) for me, and not only will I watch all three whenever they come TV, I'll defend them as well.  With the absolutely ridiculous premise of a boarding school being infiltrated and controlled by a South American terrorist group who fall to the logistics and strategy of a handful of mavericky kids who probably failed algebra and are inexplicably led by a 5-foot-nothing hero in Sean Astin, it just can't be taken seriously.

302509,A3GN5N99RJ62H3,630222540X,vincent r meglis,"[15, 18]","This is one movie that absolutely deserves to be transfered to dvd.  Why it hasn't yet, I don't understand!  I remember when Toy Soldiers first came out, I must have seen it three or four times in the thearters alone.  Then when it was released on vhs, I watched it another fifty or so, over the years.  The film never got the recognition it deserved, and because of that, it kind of just fell to the waste side.  In my opinion, this is one of the best films of the last decade.  The story, acting, and fx were all excellent.  The film is about a prep school for boys that gets taken over by terrorists.  The Regis school is where the country's best families send the world's worst students.  Although, the students are not really all that bad, they do get into trouble quite often.  The films centers on one particular group of friends at the school.  Sean Astin((""Rudy"")as Billy Tepper) is the star of the film, but the other's do as good a job.  Others in the group include Wil Wheaton((""Stand By Me"")as Joey Trotta) and Keith Coogan((""Don't Tell Mom The Babysitters Dead"")as Jonathan Bradberry).  They are all on the school's scoccer team and also room together.  The U.S. takes the head terrorist's father into custody and that's where everything begins.  The terrorists, led by Luis Cali(Andrew Divoff(Fuast-Love Of The Dammed)), first take over the courthouse where the judge that put his father away is.  They demand that the judge tell them where they took Luis's father and want him released immediately.  But when the judge won't say anything, they force him into a chopper, take off from the courthouse roof, and toss him out.  When Luis Cali learns that the judge's son is living at the Regis School, he figures they can use him as a trade off for his father.  Not suspecting anything, but just to be safe, the FBI takes the judge's son out of the school and into protective custody.  The boy's at the Regis School are in the middle of lunch in the cafateria, when Luis and his gang get there.  They walk right in and shoot a round from a machine gun into the ceiling of the cafateria, causing all the boys to drop to the floor.  They seal off all the enterances and exits, and wire the entire building with explosives.  They have check points at all corners of the roof, two guys at each with sub-machine guns and rocket launchers.  When Luis Cali learns that the judge's son has left the school, he has his people look through the school files to see who else he can use as a trade-off for his father.  He decides that there are enough important families, who will cause problems for the government if they don't adhere to his demands, who have there kid at the Regis school.  Billy and his friends agree that they have to do something to help the police and military that are now surrounding the school.  They create a plan that will get Billy to the other side to tell everyone where each of the terrorists are positioned and what type of weapons they have.  The plan works fine and everything seems to be working out, until one of the boys in their group is shot and killed.  Billy decides that helping the authorities isn't the best idea because somebody else might get killed.  But his friends tell him that he can't back out now, that everyone is  counting on them to do what they said they would.  So everything is back on, and the military, along with the help of Billy and co., set out to bring the terrorists down.  I almost forgot to mention Louis Gossett Jr, who plays Dean Parker in the film.  He, as everyone else, does a fantastic job.  I don't want to go into anymore detail because you have to see this movie for yourself.  There isn't a boring or slow part in any of the film.  You definitely won't be disappointed with this one.  Buy it while you can, since there doesn't seem to be any signs that this is comming to dvd anytime soon.

302510,A3OI841P5R6FCH,630222540X,Zagnorch,"[3, 10]","I find `Toy Soldiers' to be a somewhat passable bit of action entertainment, although it's not all that extraordinary. Sean Astin leads a group of high-class reform school kids in an effort to stop the terrorist group that has overtaken the campus. Kinda like low-rent `Die Hard' with hunky-looking teenage boys, which leads me to believe that this flick was aimed more at the teenage female demographic. Louis Gossett, Jr., playing the school headmaster, seems to be just biding his time between `Iron Eagle' flicks here. So unless you're really desperate for a group-of-teenage-kids-saving-the-day flick filled with naughty language and exit wounds, you might wanna just pass this by.Fortunately, `Toy Soldiers' does have one redeeming quality: the demise of Wil Wheaton's character by high-velocity lead. For a trekkie who's always disliked Wheaton's Wesley Crusher character on NextGen, this particular moment is a real treat. I'm hoping they'll put this on DVD someday just so I can loop this  scene and watch it over and over and over again, heh.
