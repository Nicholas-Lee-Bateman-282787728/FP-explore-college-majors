1143632,A3LCW5H7XK5B22,B0013LRKRG,Down to Earth Reader,"[5, 6]","I agree with the review criticizing the ""based on a true story"" claim. According to the Reader's Digest story ""Ace and the Dog Man"", this was a really great police dog who did amazing things. But there was no indication anywhere online that Ace was sentenced to being put to sleep for a crime he didn't commit, nor could I find anything about the daughter who wouldn't give up believing Ace was still alive. Is she even real? At any rate, the writer's attempt to create a story about a great dog was unbelievable, frustratingly stupid as far as an inept police department, and while the daughter's intelligence, persistence and intuitiveness was extremely admirable detective work, it really didn't accomplish anything to actually save the dog or bring it home.The only good part about the movie, is that it's clean, it has a happy ending where right and good prevail over bad and wrong. I'd only recommend it to grade school kids and then use it as an exercise in finding the lack of logic in both the storyline and the police department's procedures and decisions, and at the same time noticing the ingenuity and persistence (also recklessness) in the daughter's actions.",3,FRUSTRATING - or a fun lesson in (lack of) logic,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,1173,"['agree', 'review', 'criticizing', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'claim', 'According', 'Reader', 'Digest', 'story', 'Ace', 'Dog', 'Man', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'police', 'dog', 'who', 'did', 'amazing', 'things', 'was', 'indication', 'anywhere', 'Ace', 'was', 'sentenced', 'being', 'put', 'sleep', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'could', 'find', 'anything', 'daughter', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'believing', 'Ace', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'even', 'real', 'rate', 'writer', 'attempt', 'create', 'story', 'great', 'dog', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'frustratingly', 'stupid', 'as', 'far', 'inept', 'police', 'department', 'daughter', 'intelligence', 'persistence', 'intuitiveness', 'was', 'extremely', 'admirable', 'detective', 'work', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'accomplish', 'anything', 'actually', 'save', 'dog', 'bring', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'clean', 'happy', 'ending', 'where', 'right', 'good', 'prevail', 'bad', 'wrong', ""'d"", 'only', 'recommend', 'grade', 'school', 'kids', 'then', 'use', 'exercise', 'finding', 'lack', 'logic', 'storyline', 'police', 'department', 'procedures', 'decisions', 'same', 'time', 'noticing', 'ingenuity', 'persistence', 'also', 'recklessness', 'daughter', 'actions']",Ace Of Hearts

Dan is a dad that sometimes is so protective of his canine partner that he spends more time with the dog than his teenage daughter or his wife.  It doesn't take long to see that Ace respects Dan more than any of the other family members...even taking over dan's wife side of the bed.  This leads to stress in both relationships as wife and daughter feel they are always second best to the dog.Unfortunately on one occasion, Ace gets blamed for attacking a theif named Torko's throat.  The lacking evidence to the crime that Ace chased him down for protrays the criminal as an innocent bystander attacked by a vicious dog.  This leads to Ace being sent to be put down or Torko's lawyer will press charges. The caring handler that Dan is...decides to drive him there with dignity since Ace is distressed to be apart from him.Pair a smart canine with an inept employee and a blessing of an escape results where Ace must find his way home. In the meantime, both Dan and his daughter Julia try to clear Ace's name while dealing with both grief, ashes labeled as Ace, and evidence that leaves the possibility that Ace is alive.Definitely a heartwarming animal story here of a dog that steals hearts.
