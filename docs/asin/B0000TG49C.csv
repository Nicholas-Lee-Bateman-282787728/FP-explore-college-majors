782983,A364VIQ3KLAWVX,B0000TG49C,H. M Pyles,"[18, 20]","""I'm Often Mistaken for Aristocracy.""  This episode title sums up the central problem of Hyacinth's life.  Through some ironic twist of fate, she was born to the wrong set and must bend all her efforts to correcting the error.Her ever-suffering husband Richard is cashiered into early retirement from his job as a minor local bureaucrat.  But in Hyacinth's delusional world, his invitation to the Queen's annual garden party for retiring senior government officials has gone inexplicably missing, and she sets out to track it down.She is an undiscovered chanteuse who is finally accorded her long-overdue chance when a minor local musical director moves in next door.  The facts that her singing can knock cats off garbage cans and that her neighbor lives in virtual hiding to avoid her are completely lost on Hyacinth, who simply cannot abide the injustice of depriving the world -- or at least her church socials -- of the joys of her caterwauling.She may not be able to afford the ""right"" trips, but she can certainly see to it that she is seen picking up the right brochures.  And she was born to host elegant candlelight dinners on her Royal Doulton china with blue periwinkles.  The fact that no one ever accepts the invitations is no reason to cease going on about them endlessly.And her sisters and brother-in-law!  In this assemblage of some of the screen's most loveable louts one comes face to face with the ultimate futility of Hyancinth's quest to rise above it all.  It's pure physics.  No one could ever escape this much gravity.This is comedy in the disturbing vein of Carol Burnett's notoriously dysfunctional ""Mama's Family"".  And, like the Harper family's, Hyacinth's hijinks are hilarious . . . not just because they are full of comedic pratfalls, characters you almost know in your own life, and the astonishing abandon of the actors playing the roles -- but because they take you right to the edge of an insane mind kept on kilter only by skipping from one cognitive disconnect to another, like jumping stones over a raging river.  One misstep, and Hyacinth would end up in the asylum where she belongs.",5,The Grand Dame of Self-Delusion Rides Again,1080691200,"03 31, 2004",2004,2125,"[""'m"", 'Often', 'Mistaken', 'Aristocracy', 'episode', 'title', 'sums', 'up', 'central', 'problem', 'Hyacinth', 'life', 'ironic', 'twist', 'fate', 'was', 'born', 'wrong', 'set', 'must', 'bend', 'efforts', 'correcting', 'error.Her', 'ever-suffering', 'husband', 'Richard', 'cashiered', 'early', 'retirement', 'job', 'minor', 'local', 'bureaucrat', 'Hyacinth', 'delusional', 'world', 'invitation', 'Queen', 'annual', 'garden', 'party', 'retiring', 'senior', 'government', 'officials', 'gone', 'inexplicably', 'missing', 'out', 'track', 'down.She', 'undiscovered', 'chanteuse', 'who', 'finally', 'accorded', 'long-overdue', 'chance', 'when', 'minor', 'local', 'musical', 'director', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'facts', 'singing', 'can', 'knock', 'cats', 'off', 'garbage', 'cans', 'neighbor', 'lives', 'virtual', 'hiding', 'avoid', 'are', 'completely', 'lost', 'Hyacinth', 'who', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'abide', 'injustice', 'depriving', 'world', 'least', 'church', 'socials', 'joys', 'caterwauling.She', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'right', 'trips', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'seen', 'picking', 'up', 'right', 'brochures', 'was', 'born', 'host', 'elegant', 'candlelight', 'dinners', 'Royal', 'Doulton', 'china', 'blue', 'periwinkles', 'fact', 'one', 'ever', 'invitations', 'reason', 'cease', 'going', 'endlessly.And', 'sisters', 'brother-in-law', 'assemblage', 'screen', 'most', 'loveable', 'louts', 'one', 'face', 'face', 'ultimate', 'futility', 'Hyancinth', 'quest', 'rise', 'pure', 'physics', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'escape', 'much', 'gravity.This', 'comedy', 'disturbing', 'vein', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'notoriously', 'dysfunctional', 'Mama', 'Family', 'Harper', 'family', 'Hyacinth', 'hijinks', 'are', 'hilarious', 'not', 'just', 'are', 'full', 'comedic', 'pratfalls', 'characters', 'almost', 'know', 'own', 'life', 'astonishing', 'abandon', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'take', 'right', 'edge', 'insane', 'mind', 'kept', 'kilter', 'only', 'skipping', 'one', 'cognitive', 'disconnect', 'jumping', 'stones', 'raging', 'river', 'One', 'misstep', 'Hyacinth', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'asylum', 'where']",Keeping Up Appearances: Hyacinth Springs Eternal Set - Volume 5-8

782993,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0000TG49C,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[49, 52]","&quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; was a 44-episode, British TV sitcom that ran for five seasons between 1990 and 1995, with several specials filmed through 1997. The show's primary character was Hyancinth Bucket (Patricia Routledge), who always pronounced her last name as 'Bouquet' to make it sound as impressive as possible. She was obsessed with making her family appear as affluent and upper class as possible, which involved keeping her home immaculately clean and bragging to everyone about any new acquisition. While Hyancinth believes that she is admired and well respected by her piers, the reality is that no one wants anything to do with her.  Her husband, Richard Bucket (Clive Swift), does not share Hyacinth's obsession, but he accommodates her as best as he can. Unfortunately for Hyacinth, her various plans to improve their station in life are often sidetracked by issues from her less affluent sisters or her senile father. The people that are most intimidated by Hyacinth are her next-door neighbor Elizabeth Hawksworth Warden (Josephine Tewson) and her brother Emmet Hawksworth (David Griffin, who appeared in the second season onward). The local church vicar, Michael (Jeremy Gittins), and his wife (played by Marion Barron) also try to avoid Hyacinth as much as possible.Hyacinth's three sisters live to varying degrees of affluence. Daisy (Judy Cornwell) and her blue-collar husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes) live in a row house that is in dire need of repair, with a wrecked car parked out front and an unkempt interior. Hyancinth's unmarried sister Rose (played by Shirley Stelfox in 1990 and Mary Millar between 1991 and 1995) lives with Daisy and Onslow and enjoys spending time with many men to the chagrin of Hyancinth. Hyancinth's only affluent sister, Violet (Anna Dawson), is rarely seen, but Hyacinth often speaks with her on the telephone. However, Violet's husband Bruce (John Evitts), who is also rarely seen, often has a penchant for wearing women's clothes to Hyacinth's embarrassment. Their senile father (George Webb) lives with Daisy and Onslow, and has a tendency to run away and get himself into all sorts of trouble.This 4-DVD set includes the following:* Volume #5, entitled &quot;Everything's Coming Up Hyacinth&quot;, includes all seven episodes from the third season.* Volume #6, entitled &quot;Some Like it Hyacinth&quot;, includes all seven episodes from the fourth season.* Volume #7, entitled &quot;Living the Hyacinth Life&quot;, includes the first six episodes of the fifth season and interviews with Patricia Rutledge and Clive Swift.* Volume #8, entitled &quot;Hats Off to Hyacinth&quot;, includes the last four episodes of the fifth season and the 1997 special &quot;The Memoirs of Hyancinth Bucket&quot;.Though &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; is not as well known in the U.S. as &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; (nor is it as outrageous), it is a very good example of British comedy.

782994,A2ZSUIGBPVGKHN,B0000TG49C,Moira,"[1, 1]","It's been quite a few years since I discovered this program on BBC, and I now own the complete collection on DVD. Patricia Routledge, quite simply, gives the most hilarious performance as the socially correct and pretentious Hyacinth Bucket (Bouquet in her parlance). No matter how much she knows about or attempts to practice with regard to etiquette, her motley assortment of dysfunctional family members offers up many opportunities to embarrass Hyacinth and she spends a great deal of time trying to avoid her sisters, the trampy Rose, unstylish and untidy Daisy, and lazy brother-in-law Onslow who live in a state of blissful disregard and indifference for their rundown and perpetually disheveled home and rattle trap car. Conversely, Hyacinth loves to tell everyone about her sister, Violet, who lives in a high end house and owns a &#34;sauna, Mercedes, and has room for a pony&#34; even though Violet and her husband Bruce are just as dysfunctional as the less well off members of the family. No one is safe from Hyacinth's annoying behavior and obliviousness to just how much she irritates everyone who knows her, especially her next door neighbors, the milkman, the postman, and the vicar. Hyacinth's husband, Richard, is the long suffering spouse that everyone feels sorry for. Filled with the unique British humor and Routledge's stellar performance, this series is bound to provide many laughs for those who watch.

783002,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0000TG49C,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 4]","Though not really rabid, Emmet and the rest of the cast will do nearly anything to avoid Hyacinth, the ""Bucket Woman."" Patricia Routledge is perfect in this series as Hyacinth Bucket (""it's pronounced 'Bouquet'""...) as a social climber who will do anything to be noticed by the upper class. Well known for her candlelight suppers, Hyacinth ventures into more novel entertaining venues in these episodes. One of my favorites of this set is ""Riparian Entertainments,"" which has a deliciously wicked nautical twist. Interestingly several of the other episodes in this set also have a nautical back story.In these episodes Elizabeth and Emmet develop into central roles; Elizabeth gets ever more nervous around Hyacinth and develops an unusual drinking problem, while Emmet goes to any lengths to hide from Hyacinth (""She'll sing at me!"") The rest of the cast is perfect as well: Rose is sworn off men (...again...sadly Mary Millar recently passed away,) Daisy and Onslow manage to offend Hyacinth with their lower class sensibilities and ""bone-idleness,"" while simultaneously being the most likeable members of the cast. I especially enjoy seeing Onslow in his sweater vest or Green Bay Packers t-shirt reading ""Principles of Condensed Matter Physics."" The supporting cast members are fabulous as well: the postman and milkman are wonderful in their attempts to avoid Hyacinth, and the Vicar and his wife are delightfully resourceful in keeping Hyacinth at arm's length as well.These DVD's are the last half of the series and largely cover the leisure years after poor Richard (played to perfection by Clive Swift) retires. I don't envy his retirement one bit no matter how many golf outings, dress balls, or estate sales he gets to attend...but I do especially like the outing where Hyacinth and Richard go horseback riding with Emmet, an expert rider.This is a great series and a great boxed set. There are several extras ranging from public service announcements to outtakes, all of which are worth watching. Most of all, though, sit back and revel in the good humor and hilarity ranging from the incredibly subtle to the sublimely ridiculous. I highly recommend this set to anyone with a sense of humor.
