I also agree with other comments about how dark this film is.  It almost looks like it was all shot in the evening. A few scenes are somewhat light but more than 75% of this print is much too dark. Looked like the contrast needed to be turned way up. I have seen this film on AMC some years ago and it looked fine.  Watching the film slightly hurt my eyes.  I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.  Yes, it seems like FOX couldn't care less of print quality which varies from release to release on their MOD program. I have purchased several releases from FOX and none looked as bad as this one.  I would compare the print quality to the lousy PD prints that Alpha releases.

I guess Fox thought this would be a funny idea for a movie, but instead it is forced and unfunny. It has a great cast, but only Charles Coburn comes out ahead. And Paul Douglas and Linda Darnell look absolutely ridiculous mouthing the operatic arias. The whole film just doesn't work.",1,"Bad print, silly movie",1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,365,"['First', 'all', 'dark', 'print', 'humming', 'sound', 'soundtrack', 'guess', 'Fox', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'idea', 'movie', 'instead', 'forced', 'unfunny', 'great', 'cast', 'only', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'out', 'ahead', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'look', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'mouthing', 'operatic', 'arias', 'whole', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'work']",N/A
1603627,A2NXW3MT1V3BWD,B00A1AU5YK,"R. Ginocchio ""Classics Fan""","[1, 1]","Paul Douglas is the husband of a would be singer.  Celeste Holm is his okay singing wife whom he tries to placate with a public performance only to be discovered himself as an opera star by Linda Darnell.  Charles Coburn lends his skill as Douglas' advice bearing father-in-law trying to steer him away from mistakes he made with his own wife.  There are a lot of funny moments in the film and all the leads are good in their roles.  The only drawback is the ending is a little too slapstick for the rest of the film.  If you like Darnell or Douglas you will like the movie, but really Celeste Holm is the best of the bunch here.  She does some great comic work as a wife who thinks she is better than she is only to find out her husband has all the talent.",4,"funny, but a little slapstick at the end",1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,757,"['Paul', 'Douglas', 'husband', 'would', 'be', 'singer', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'okay', 'singing', 'wife', 'whom', 'placate', 'public', 'performance', 'only', 'be', 'discovered', 'opera', 'star', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'skill', 'Douglas', 'advice', 'bearing', 'father-in-law', 'trying', 'steer', 'away', 'mistakes', 'made', 'own', 'wife', 'are', 'lot', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'leads', 'are', 'good', 'roles', 'only', 'drawback', 'ending', 'little', 'too', 'slapstick', 'rest', 'film', 'like', 'Darnell', 'Douglas', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'really', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'best', 'bunch', 'here', 'great', 'comic', 'work', 'wife', 'who', 'better', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'husband', 'talent']",N/A
1603628,A2TO31D8XDFPZR,B00A1AU5YK,Roger Blunck,"[6, 6]","As a movie fan going way back I have been a fan of 20th Century Fox for a long time.  They've made many fine films & this is one of them.  I was thrilled that they were finally opening their library on DVD.  Unfortunately, their quality of product is very uneven. There's no quality control of any kind.  If we spend the money we deserve to get good quality product.  The print of ""Everybody Does It"" represents the laziness of the 20th Archive people.  It's lazy, sloppy work since good prints of this film do exist as proven by prints on TV in the past.  This print starts out too dark, then it gets light, then it gets dark throughout.  Added to that there's a tremendous amount of optical noise, film marks and humming in a couple of scenes.  For a black-and-white film from 1949 they can do better than this!  I've purchased other films and the two that are the best so far are ""My Gal Sal"" and ""Nob Hill"".  Both are in excellent condition and look like real Technicolor.  ""Do You Love Me"" is okay but murky and sometimes out-of-focus.  Obviously it's the print shown on the Fox Movie Channel which was nothing to write home about.  ""Junior Miss"" is fine as is ""Claudia & David.""  The print of ""Claudia"" however is rather ragged.  ""Life Begins at 8:30"" is fine.  They are not killing themselves supplying product and don't seem to care if you like it or not.  If you purchase them you're taking a chance.  TCM and Warner Archive give you good product even with films that go back to 1931.  Just a word of warning to future DVD fans.  We should keep each other informed so we know which discs to avoid.",4,"Fun Movie, Top Cast, Bad Print",1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,1606,"['movie', 'fan', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'have', 'been', 'fan', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'made', 'many', 'fine', 'films', 'one', 'was', 'thrilled', 'were', 'finally', 'opening', 'library', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'quality', 'product', 'very', 'uneven', 'quality', 'control', 'kind', 'spend', 'money', 'deserve', 'get', 'good', 'quality', 'product', 'print', 'Everybody', 'laziness', '20th', 'Archive', 'people', 'lazy', 'sloppy', 'work', 'good', 'prints', 'film', 'do', 'exist', 'proven', 'prints', 'TV', 'past', 'print', 'out', 'too', 'dark', 'then', 'light', 'then', 'dark', 'Added', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'optical', 'noise', 'film', 'marks', 'humming', 'couple', 'scenes', 'black-and-white', 'film', '1949', 'can', 'do', 'better', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'other', 'films', 'two', 'are', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'Gal', 'Sal', 'Nob', 'Hill', 'are', 'excellent', 'condition', 'look', 'real', 'Technicolor', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', 'okay', 'murky', 'sometimes', 'out-of-focus', 'print', 'shown', 'Fox', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'was', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'Junior', 'Miss', 'fine', 'Claudia', 'David', 'print', 'Claudia', 'however', 'rather', 'ragged', 'Life', '8:30', 'fine', 'are', 'not', 'killing', 'supplying', 'product', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'like', 'not', 'purchase', ""'re"", 'taking', 'chance', 'TCM', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'give', 'good', 'product', 'even', 'films', 'go', 'back', '1931', 'Just', 'word', 'warning', 'future', 'DVD', 'fans', 'should', 'keep', 'other', 'informed', 'know', 'discs', 'avoid']",N/A
