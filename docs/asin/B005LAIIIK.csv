Asghar Farhadi draws you in from the word go and keeps you completely hooked until the end.

One day there is an argument between the attendant and Nader and soon Nader finds himself facing a jail sentence.The pace of the film while not extremely slow is still very languid. Many of the situations that arise in the movie give us insights of life in a religious Islamic society.But at its heart is a human drama of a troubled marriage, parenthood, fatherly love, familial responsibilities- these are many themes and they are all conducted expertly by Asghar Farhadi- the director.8/22/2013",4,Arent these people just like us?,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1042,"['Separation', 'distinct', 'film', 'simplicity', 'yet', 'rich', 'details', 'end', 'film', 'start', 'taking', 'sides', 'relating', 'people', 'screen', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'lot.Nader', 'Peyman', 'Maadi', 'hesitating', 'move', 'overseas', 'wife', 'Simin', 'Leila', 'Hatami', 'daughter', 'Termeh', 'Sarina', 'Farhadi', 'not', 'want', 'leave', 'father', 'who', 'suffering', 'AlzheimersSimin', 'files', 'divorce', 'moves', 'parents', 'house', 'Nader', 'forced', 'hire', 'home', 'attendant', 'Sareh', 'Bayat', 'caretaker', 'old', 'man', 'One', 'day', 'argument', 'attendant', 'Nader', 'soon', 'Nader', 'facing', 'jail', 'sentence.The', 'pace', 'film', 'not', 'extremely', 'slow', 'still', 'very', 'languid', 'Many', 'situations', 'arise', 'movie', 'give', 'insights', 'life', 'religious', 'Islamic', 'society.But', 'heart', 'human', 'drama', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'parenthood', 'fatherly', 'love', 'familial', 'responsibilities-', 'are', 'many', 'themes', 'are', 'conducted', 'expertly', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi-', 'director.8/22/2013']",N/A
1486813,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B005LAIIIK,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 3]","I think most people have experienced in life at least once the law of unintended consequences, where a number of moves, seemingly small and harmless in themselves, end up in an explosive and desperate situation when they add up. In this wonderful Iranian drama (I WILL DISCLOSE SOME SPOILERS), Nader and Simin, a middle class, westernized couple in Tehran, are divorcing. Nader, the wife, wants to leave Iran for abroad with their daughter; Simin (an extraordinary performance by Peyman Moaadi) wants to stay to take care of his Alzheimer disease ravaged father. Nader moves out of the house, and to take care of his father, Simin hires Razieh, a religious, working class woman, who is clearly out of her depth in having to take care of an incontinent, senile man. In her second day at work, she leaves for a moment the apartment, leaving the father tied at the bed. Simin soon arrives and finds his father has fallen from bed and is unconscious. Razieh returns, Simin angrily confronts her, he accuses her of negligence in caring for his father and (it turns out falsely) of stealing money, they start arguing and he ends up shoving her from the apartment. She falls and ends up losing her four months pregnancy. When her unemployed husband Hodjat learns of this, he pushes charges of murder toward Simin, and soon there is a huge legal confrontation between the couples. I will not reveal more, but we are less than half ways into the movie, and in the course of the trial, many things would turn out not to be what we supposed at first.Director Ashgar Farhadi intelligently does not take sides, and refrains from portraying one couple as good and the other couple as bad. Nevertheless, I think Western audiences will tend to sympathize with Nader and Simin, whose lives they would find easier to identify with. And Hodjat is such a hothead that is hard to feel any sympathy for him. But almost every character in the movie acts in a very selfish way (starting with Nader, wishing to leave Iran and her family without establishing a good reason). And almost every character would eventually lie to the judge when it fits their need. And it is the working class couple who has suffered the most grievous loss (though whose responsibility this was is not clear until the very end), and it is Simin who is probably the most smug character in the movie, though the movie makes clear that no one meant bad to anyone, and that they ended up up here due to an extraordinarily improbable chain of events.",5,Excellent,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,2498,"['think', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'experienced', 'life', 'least', 'once', 'law', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'where', 'number', 'moves', 'seemingly', 'small', 'harmless', 'end', 'up', 'explosive', 'desperate', 'situation', 'when', 'add', 'up', 'wonderful', 'Iranian', 'drama', 'WILL', 'DISCLOSE', 'SOME', 'SPOILERS', 'Nader', 'Simin', 'middle', 'class', 'westernized', 'couple', 'Tehran', 'are', 'divorcing', 'Nader', 'wife', 'leave', 'Iran', 'abroad', 'daughter', 'Simin', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'Peyman', 'Moaadi', 'stay', 'take', 'care', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'ravaged', 'father', 'Nader', 'house', 'take', 'care', 'father', 'Simin', 'Razieh', 'religious', 'working', 'class', 'woman', 'who', 'clearly', 'out', 'depth', 'having', 'take', 'care', 'incontinent', 'senile', 'man', 'second', 'day', 'work', 'moment', 'apartment', 'leaving', 'father', 'tied', 'bed', 'Simin', 'soon', 'father', 'fallen', 'bed', 'unconscious', 'Razieh', 'returns', 'Simin', 'angrily', 'negligence', 'caring', 'father', 'out', 'falsely', 'stealing', 'money', 'start', 'arguing', 'up', 'shoving', 'apartment', 'up', 'losing', 'four', 'months', 'pregnancy', 'When', 'unemployed', 'husband', 'Hodjat', 'charges', 'murder', 'Simin', 'soon', 'huge', 'legal', 'confrontation', 'couples', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'more', 'are', 'less', 'half', 'ways', 'movie', 'course', 'trial', 'many', 'things', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'supposed', 'first.Director', 'Ashgar', 'Farhadi', 'intelligently', 'not', 'take', 'sides', 'refrains', 'portraying', 'one', 'couple', 'good', 'other', 'couple', 'bad', 'Nevertheless', 'think', 'Western', 'audiences', 'will', 'tend', 'sympathize', 'Nader', 'Simin', 'lives', 'would', 'find', 'easier', 'identify', 'Hodjat', 'such', 'hothead', 'hard', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'almost', 'character', 'movie', 'very', 'selfish', 'way', 'starting', 'Nader', 'wishing', 'leave', 'Iran', 'family', 'establishing', 'good', 'reason', 'almost', 'character', 'would', 'eventually', 'lie', 'judge', 'when', 'need', 'working', 'class', 'couple', 'who', 'suffered', 'most', 'grievous', 'loss', 'responsibility', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'very', 'end', 'Simin', 'who', 'probably', 'most', 'smug', 'character', 'movie', 'movie', 'clear', 'one', 'meant', 'bad', 'anyone', 'ended', 'up', 'up', 'here', 'due', 'extraordinarily', 'improbable', 'chain', 'events']",N/A
1486814,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B005LAIIIK,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","'A Separation' is a truly exceptional piece of work from writer/director Asghar Farhadi.  It is well-deserving of its Academy Award for best foreign film.  I'd call it my second-favorite film of 2011.  [I would have given the Oscar toBeginners.  I found 'The Artist' to be a good little film, but no world beater.]It's my favorite type of film.  It gives the viewer a deep slice of life of a country outsiders don't understand very well.  And, behind the curtain, we find its citizens living extraordinary lives in difficult circumstances.  We empathize with them and celebrate their humanity and dignity.  In that regard, let's put 'A Separation' into the league with two recent brilliant films of the same ilk:4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 DaysandThe Lives of Others- depressing tones, repressive or faltering governments, beleaguered citizens placed into extreme circumstances with the most difficult of choices.The casting is brilliant: Leila Hatami - star of Farhadi'sLeila- personifies the elegance and beauty of Persian woman. Peyman Moaadi, as her husband, is striking and magnetic.  I never lost my support for his character, even as his story gets a bit slippery towards the end.  But it's Sarina Farhadi (yes, the director's daughter) as the couple's daughter, Termeh, who will steal your heart.

I saw NONE of that in this film.  maybe i missed one somewhere but it was isolated if i did. as to the dress, although we typically notice all the women are veiled, this time i noticed that virtually everyone was wearing blue jeans and shirts, both men and women.  the women put veils on top of that.  there does not seem to be much in the way of wearing business clothes by anyone. even the judge was dressed like this. the halls in the court were jam packed with people dressed like this, waiting, and it didn't look like much was being accomplished, if one had cut the movie to America while watching, it would seem like the film was also cutting to a different time period. this film looks like it is set in the 1970s by the time you visit all of these places in the city.  UPDATE: in the most recent film PAST, i saw only one computer in use. one of the children was using a laptop to while away the time while he was left on his own in a corner of his father's dry cleaning store. i did see cell phones in use but these characters used them as phones. there is also the mention that email was used to harass a character's wife but that is mentioned not seen. as to clothes, the woman who was French was dressed simply but beautifully whereas the other characters were in the usual blue jeans and shirts.",5,"the land of very few legal rights and widespread, untended social ills",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,3882,"['legal', 'system', 'film', 'left', 'i', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'open', 'one', 'legal', 'proceeding', 'where', 'wife', 'trying', 'obtain', 'divorce', 'then', 'half', 'hour', 'later', 'film', 'engrossed', 'yet', 'legal', 'system', 'time', 'murder', '4.5', 'month', 'old', 'fetus', 'mother', 'miscarriage', 'proceeding', 'segues', 'charge', 'mistreating', 'elderly', 'then', 'discover', 'one', 'guy', 'been', 'sitting', 'debtor', 'prison', 'whole', 'time', 'proceedings', 'plaintiff', 'defendant', 'talk', 'once', 'same', 'time', 'judge', 'judge', 'just', 'basically', 'guilty', 'more', 'more', 'crimes', 'do', 'so', 'rules', 'evidence', 'are', 'followed', 'attorneys', 'are', 'used', 'order', 'court', 'mounting', 'crimes', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'help', 'matters', 'yet', 'social', 'ills', 'are', 'so', 'manifest', 'yet', 'one', 'interested', 'incompetent', 'senior', 'alzheimer', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'who', 'already', 'one', 'child', 'who', 'pregnant', 'again', 'husband', 'debtor', 'prison', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'separated', 'wife', 'leave', 'ills', 'land', 'move', 'elsewhere', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'future', 'daughter', 'lots', 'else', 'going', 'film', 'primarily', 'gave', 'look', 'retrogressive', 'laws', 'untended', 'social', 'ills', 'middleast', 'was', 'eye', 'opener', 'anything', 'else', 'i', ""'ve"", 'read', 'seen', 'legal', 'system', 'usa', 'was', 'not', 'retrograde', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'astonishing', 'film', 'i', 'was', 'THERE', 'update', 'i', 'just', 'saw', 'director', 'PAST', 'up', 'Oscar', 'March', '2014', 'ceremony', 'film', 'also', 'use', 'legal', 'system', 'courts', 'married', 'couple', 'SEPARATION', 'see', 'Iranian', 'legal', 'system', 'extremely', 'chaotic', 'courts', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'PAST', 'have', 'french', 'legal', 'system', 'not', 'different', 'orderly', 'process', 'one', 'USA', 'UK', 'courts', 'i', 'had', 'law', 'professor', 'decades', 'who', 'said', 'show', 'country', 'legal', 'system', 'case', 'law', 'i', ""'ll"", 'show', 'country', 'people', 'seeing', 'couples', 'getting', 'divorces', 'Iran', 'vs', 'France', 'was', 'MAJOR', 'eye', 'opener', 'validity', 'maxim.Note', 'film', 'was', 'made', '2011', 'yet', 'everywhere', 'went', 'film', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'technology', 'most', 'movies', 'even', 'set', 'other', 'countries', 'see', 'most', 'people', 'carrying', 'around', 'laptops', 'ipads', 'tablets', 'cellphones', 'go', 'place', 'business', 'institution', 'technology', 'everywhere', 'such', 'schools', 'courts', 'hospitals', 'family', 'homework', 'spot', 'so', 'saw', 'NONE', 'film', 'maybe', 'i', 'missed', 'one', 'somewhere', 'was', 'isolated', 'i', 'did', 'dress', 'typically', 'notice', 'women', 'are', 'veiled', 'time', 'i', 'noticed', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'was', 'wearing', 'blue', 'jeans', 'shirts', 'men', 'women', 'women', 'put', 'veils', 'top', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'way', 'wearing', 'business', 'clothes', 'anyone', 'even', 'judge', 'was', 'dressed', 'halls', 'court', 'were', 'jam', 'packed', 'people', 'dressed', 'waiting', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'was', 'being', 'accomplished', 'one', 'had', 'cut', 'movie', 'America', 'watching', 'would', 'seem', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'cutting', 'different', 'time', 'period', 'film', 'set', '1970s', 'time', 'visit', 'places', 'city', 'UPDATE', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'PAST', 'i', 'saw', 'only', 'one', 'computer', 'use', 'one', 'children', 'was', 'using', 'laptop', 'while', 'away', 'time', 'was', 'left', 'own', 'corner', 'father', 'dry', 'cleaning', 'store', 'i', 'did', 'see', 'cell', 'phones', 'use', 'characters', 'used', 'phones', 'also', 'mention', 'email', 'was', 'used', 'harass', 'character', 'wife', 'mentioned', 'not', 'seen', 'clothes', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'French', 'was', 'dressed', 'simply', 'beautifully', 'whereas', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'usual', 'blue', 'jeans', 'shirts']",N/A

Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","Earlier this year,  the 2011 film ""A Separation"" (Jodaeiye Nader az Simin), written, directed and produced by Asghar Farhadi (""About Elly"", ""Fireworks Wednesday"", ""Beautiful City"") became the first Iranian film to win an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"".The film has achieved success in other countries, winning the ""Golden Bear"" for Best Film, Best Actress and Best Actor awards at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival, winning a Golden Globe for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" and other awards around the world.Also receiving a nearly unanimous favorable rating from film critics internationally, including voted #1 by Roger Ebert for ""Best Film of 2011&#8243; and placing #2 in the annual ""Best Film of 2011&#8243; by Sight & Sound's critic poll.VIDEO:""A Separation"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  Despite being a low-budget film, the clarity and detail of the film is very good.  The film is colorful, warm and for the most part, considering the majority of the shots are indoors, picture quality is very good.  I didn't notice any artifacts, banding or any problems while watching this film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""A Separation"" is presented in Persian/Farsi, French LCR DTS-HD MA (Discrete Surround). Because the film is a lossless stereo track, while the film is primarily dialogue driven, the dialogue is crystal clear along with the music by Sattar Oraki which sounds wonderful.  While it would have been nice to have a 5.1 lossless track for ambiance and better dynamic range especially in scenes featuring crowds or traffic noise, but because the film is primarily within close quarters, dynamic range is limited, but yet dialogue and music are clear.Subtitles are in English and French.SPECIAL FEATURES""A Separation"" comes with the following special features:Commentary with Writer/Director Asghar Farhadi - Featuring a detailed audio commentary by filmmaker Asghar Farhadi (note: commentary is presented with English subtitles).An Evening With Asghar Farhadi - (30:42) A post screening Q&A; with director Asghar Farhadi.Birth of a Director - (7:52) An interview with director Asghar Farhadi discussing his films.Theatrical Trailer - (2:03) The theatrical trailer for ""A Separation"".JUDGMENT CALL:Asghar Farhadi's ""A Separation"" is an amazing and cleverly written film.  A film that captivates an audience and you become emotionally invested in it because not only is it a family drama, it's also an emotional drama in which you sympathize with all characters, who each have their own personal motivation.Is it philosophical?  There are tangents within each human connection that there is no way anyone can pick one side.Simin is a mother who puts her daughter's future ahead of her own marriage.  She is not being selfish, knowing how life is in Iran, all she wants is the best for her daughter and knowing that moving to a better area can lead to a better life for her family.  In her mind, her father-in-law is alive, but he rarely speaks and is just a person with no future as he had lived his life and now, no longer has any recollection of it.  He doesn't even know his own son, that is how bad Alzheimer's disease has consumed him.  So, can you blame Simin for now wanting to make a move on life?  It doesn't mean she doesn't love her husband or her father-in-law but for most parents, to invest in your children's future and making sure they have a  better life than their parents is important.For Nader, he is the evocative character.  A loving son, a caring father, but his wife is forcing him make a choice...father or family?  This is a difficult choice because perhaps for Nader, his father is what made him to become a man.  It appears that his father was a big part of his life and it shows as Nader gives all he can to take care of his father within reasonable means.  And there is no way his wife is going to destroy that important father and son relationship.  His father may not be the same man as he once was, but he feels that he owes it to him, to care for him while he is alive.  And the fact that his wife leaves him, his feelings towards her is no longer the same.  And there is no doubt that his argument with Razieh, the woman hired to care for his father was fueled by anger.  By tying his father up and his father close to dying, it's hard to be angry with Razie and why he reacts the way he does towards her.  Pushing her is wrong, but did he know she was pregnant or not?For the 11-year-old daughter Termeh, she represents the blood connection to Nader and Simin.  The only connection to keeping the family together.  She knows she can go with her mother and leave, but she would never do such a thing because she loves her father as well.  And as long as she stays with her father, she knows that her mother will never leave far away from her.  But as Termeh is a smart girl, the court case revolving around her father begins to take its toll, as she starts to learn how different they towards each other.  But all she wants is for her parents to be married...but will she have any power to keep them together or will they remain separated.And as you have the family drama persisting throughout the film, you now deal with the supporting characters.Razieh, the very religious woman with a daughter, pregnant but must deal with her husband's financial problems and temper.  She takes on a job, far from her home in order to make money to help the family.  But having been shamed by Nader and accused for stealing money, which she argues that she didn't, to make things worse, she loses her baby because of Nader.And now this becomes the focus of the story as she wants Nader punished for the loss of her child.  Her husband Hodjat has a hot-temper but he also would rather see Nader punished for the loss of his baby than take any financial payment.  But because of his temper and troubles, when it is used against him, he feels that its unfair to him and his wife.  For Razieh, because they are poor, because their is no official papers to show employment, because her husband's hot temper is becoming a hindrance, the audience begins to question.  Is Nader responsible for her miscarriage?There are many situations which we may feel are implausible and ineffable, but once you start to feel yourself straying to one side and supporting a character, situations start to make you reverse and question that decision.  Is Nader genuine?  Is he telling the truth or is he lying?  Is the religious Razieh lying?  Will Termeh be dragged into this as well?  It's all part of the wonderful pacing and buildup of the film, which I found captivating!""A Separation"" is a Blu-ray release that looks great via HD.  While the lossless audio is primarily dialogue and is front channel driven, there are careful shots that are employed in the film.  Facial reactions, well-planned editing that compliments the film's pacing.  And there is also a few special features included as well, that introduces us to the work of filmmaker Asghar Farhadi.What I enjoyed about Asghar Farhadi's film is that it's not polemic, it's not forcing religion or any belief.  It's a film that makes us sympathize with every character, as they all believe what they are doing is right.  The film is character-driven and what Farhadi was able to create are moments that make us feel we know the facts, when we really don't. Each person has their own personal motive.But it's their genuine actions, their own personal convictions that keep them separated.  Its strong storytelling and character development is what adds to the efficacy of Farhadi's masterpiece!""A Separation"" is a film that is very deserving of all the awards it has won, it is deserving of its Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" and its a rare film to see in today's world.  Yes, the film is made in Iran and gives us a perspective of how law is served, how religion is important to certain people of society but it's also a modern film that strays away from what people think about films being created in the Middle East.  Nader and Simin are among the upper middle class in Tehran, their daughter is educated and no matter how much media tends to portray Iranians, for those of us in the west, it's important to have films such as ""A Separation"" showing audience of a modern society but also their culture, laws and no matter where you are in this world, problems exist not only for the poor but even people with money.  Life's never perfect and for marriages, there are sacrifices that need to be made.  But how far will one go to make a sacrifice for their family?Overall, Asghar Farhadi has written and directed a pure cinematic masterpiece. Captivating, compelling and wonderful! ""A Separation"" is highly recommended.",4,"Asghar Farhadi has written and directed a pure cinematic masterpiece.

Simin wants to go abroad, but Nader feels himself unable to follow as he has to look after his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who has Alzheimer's.  Daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) stays with Nader, but still wants her parents to be together.  Nader hires Razieh to come and look after his house while he (Nader) is out at work, but things do not go according to plan.  Razieh loses her unborn child, and her husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) accuses Nader of contributing to the tragedy.  The conflicts between the two families - those of Nader and Hojjat - end up in the courts, involving issues not just of justice but religious and social traditions as well. Asghar Farhadi's film is shot in documentary-style, with no musical accompaniment.  Its structure can be described as elliptical; the end mirrors the beginning, depicting the difficulties of family life in a society where women have to act according to certain prescribed social and moral guidelines, while their male partners often allow belief in tradition to influence their judgment.  Such attitudes are not peculiar to Farhadi's context; they prevail in other territories as well.  A SEPARATION is a study in non-communication: both families are articulate, and can express their feelings through well-crafted dialog, but they do not listen to one another.

Sooo condescending!} The actors have an edge in plausibility by NOT being familiar to English-language audiences from other roles, but even so their dramatic control of face/body/voice could hardly be improved. Editing and camerawork are outstanding, and the script is deep, both emotionally and thematically. A powerful film, in short, and several orders of magnitude more intelligent than any ""American Language"" film I saw in 2011.Second, it seems to be profoundly revealing of Life in contemporary Iran. I write ""seems"" because I have not visited Iran and have no first-person experience of Life there with which to compare what the film portrays. That portrayal is clearly NOT a whitewash of social problems in Iran; in fact it has the grit of honest realism. The depiction of the Iranian justice system in action could not have pleased Iranian authorities, but there it is on screen! The gender relations are not as simplistic and uniform as many Americans shallowly assume. The two principal women characters could scarcely be more different, one of them impoverished, uneducated and burqa-clad, the other an ambitious ""modern"" woman from a well-off family who dyes her hair and wears the least ""devout"" scarf possible. Attitudes toward Islam are likewise not uniform or simple; the lives of both couples in the film are permeated by religion but the four characters plainly hold their ""faith"" in different compartments of their minds. The mere fact that such a film could be made in Iran and shown to the World makes me think that Iran is not as rigidly supervised by Ayatollahs as the western press portrays it.

1486827,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005LAIIIK,Grady Harp,"[7, 7]","A SEPARATION is a profoundly moving film from Iran, written and directed by Asghar Farhadi, acted by a truly gifted cast of artists, and a film that dares to dig deeply into so many issues that are not only serving to enlighten the world about conditions in Iran, but also to make us each reevaluate our feelings about family, faith, love, responsibility, parenting, and surviving in a world that often seems incompatible with life as we once knew it. One of the reasons the film works so intensely well is the directors ignoring the outside influences of musical score and cinematic effects, instead relying on person to person communication in claustrophobic confines that drives the story in an almost breathless pace that heightens the drama.Briefly, the story deals with husband and wife Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) who are arguing about living abroad. Simin prefers to live abroad to provide better opportunities for their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). However, Nader refuses to go because he thinks he must stay in Iran and takes care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who suffers from Alzheimers. So committed is Simin to make this escape from the confines and turmoil of Iran that she decides to get a divorce and leave the country with her daughter. Nadar must work at the bank to support his father and Termeh who has decided to stay home in Iran with her father, so he hires a caregiver Razieh (Sareh Bayat) who comes to work with her 6 year old daughter: Razieh is pregnant, her unemployed cobbler husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) is in and out of debtors prison, and in general Hodjat and Razieh represent the agony of the struggling lower class. Razieh cannot cope with caring for the Alzheimer victim, stressors occur, Nader throws Razieh out of his house when he discovers his father's lack of care, and in the struggle Razieh has a miscarriage.  The remainder of the film is the struggle between the two couples - middle class Nader and Simin and poverty lower class Razieh and Hodjat.  The audience is placed in the `courtroom' (actually a simple confrontation with a judge) concerning divorce, the accident that turns a miscarriage into an accusation of murder, and the battle between the two couples, which is a battle between classes. Religious issues are raised: philosophical issues are in focus. From all of these incidents we learn more about the current standards of life in Iran than any book has shared.It is rare when a film leaves the audience speechless.  This one does.

What is surprising is the degree of freedom in legal and personal rights that women have in Iran from what is customarily found in most centralized Islamic nations. That is probably due to the historic value placed on education for both genders in that country. What is not surprising is that women must still kowtow; be servile and submissive to males because of an abusive and manipulative misinterpretation of the Quran. This is most visibly symbolized by their restrictive clothing while the man wears his freedom openly.My extracted simplistic theme for this particular social setting is that devotion results in separation:Son devoted to father. Wife to husband. Parents to their child. Child to parents. Muslims to the Quran (the separation is from others; from freedom; from naturalness of life).

1486831,A167K0YA96FD56,B005LAIIIK,Ian Gordon Malcomson,"[1, 2]","Iran has come to be seen in the West as a perpetual rogue state and political pariah because of its commitment to promoting hard-line Islamic fundamentalism and creating a nuclear weapons program. The makers of this film want to offer their audience another more disturbing view of Iran that goes inside the country and looks at how the institution of the family fares when it is under attack. The picture it presents is one of very divided society along the lines of conflicting religious and social values that cross generations and speak to a country that may not be united behind its political leaders and their rigid ideology. The main characters in this film are Nader and Simin, typical modern Iranian parents who unfortunately have fallen out over how to raise their daughter, Termeh. While the father wants to keep her in Iran so she can be educated according to the Quran, the mother favours taking her abroad for a western education. These two irreconcilable views invariably lead to the break-up of their marriage and a chain of nasty events that even the mighty autocratic regime of Iran, with the help of the Quran, is unable to resolve. While the family institution represents some of the strongest links in any society, when they begin to break apart, like in this story, its individuals become very vulnerable to outside attacks. Children suffer from the lack of parental nurturing; elderly parents don't get the help they need; outsiders step in and exploit people's emotions; and individuals ultimately turn inward and become self-centered. While Islamic law attempts to resolve these troubling situations by imposing rules, it cannot overcome the fact that Iran is a society made up of individuals who have not yet learned to put the interests of others before their own. Come to think of it, this is a human failing that dogs most of the human family with one exception: the Iranian regime papers over it with a facade of morality that is supposed to hold the family together even if it is clearly dysfunctional.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[0, 0]","This Oscar-winning (Best Foreign Film) drama from Iran is every bit as good as one of you JayFlix.net folks insisted it was! Persistence pays (AND backing a highly acclaimed film). Thanks for all those reminders. Part of what makes this so convincing is the unfamiliarity of the faces, but the rest is excellent direction, wonderful acting and an unpredictable story.An elderly man is slowly sinking into the oblivion of Alzheimer's while his over-wrought son tries to provide care for him, hold a job, be an involved parent for his only child and, in his spare time, save his marriage. His wife has worked diligently to get visas so she, her husband and their daughter can leave Iran. The husband is adamantly opposed; he can't leave while his father (who no longer recognizes him) needs his help. The central issue is his father's disease and its disastrous effects on his family. It doesn't matter if we are in Tehran or Toledo, the ripple effects of Alzheimer's are the same.Here are the players:* Peyman Moadi (&#34;About Elly&#34;) Nader is dynamic, impatient, arbi- trary and loving. He cannot yield one iota, for fear he will lose everything. He feels his pride, his honor and his duty are in jeopardy, so nothing must interfere: not a wife, not a caretaker, not a daughter.* Leila Hatami (&#34;The Deserted Station&#34;) Simin is smart, deter- mined and organized; she is the wife who wants a better life else- where. Even though she can't say so out loud, she is stifled by her world and doesn't want her daughter to grow up in it.* Sareh Bayat (&#34;Devil's Take&#34;) Razieh is devout, obedient and desperate. She has been hired secretly (she is a woman) to care for the Alzheimer's patient. When he soils himself she has to call a Muslim help line to see if it is a sin for her to clean him up with no male in attendance.* Shahab Hosseini (&#34;Final Whistle&#34;) Hodjat is the furious husband of the caretaker; she failed to get his permission before going to work. His rage fuels the last half of this film.* Sarina Farhadi in her screen debut, is Termeh, the teenage daughter who is caught in the tug-of-war between her parents.I found the legal battles to be extremely interesting. All the parties convene in an office with what appears to be a magistrate. Each person presents his or her side of the story, amid interruptions and distractions from others, and the official tries to ascertain the truth. The part I really liked: NO LAWYERS!

1486835,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B005LAIIIK,Jiang Xueqin,"[109, 114]","The Iranian film ""A Separation"" will most likely win this year's Oscar for Best Foreign Film, and has already won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film as well as best film at the Berlin International Film Festival. ""A Separation"" is writer and director Asghar Farhadi's fifth film, and it's the one that will establish him as one of the world's most brilliant storytellers.The title ostensibly refers to an urban middle class couple who have separated from each other; English teacher Simin has gotten a visa to emigrate to the West, but her husband Nader, who works in a bank, refuses to leave his father who has Alzheimer's. They have an 11-year-old daughter Termeh (played by the director's daughter) who doesn't want her parents to leave each other, and so chooses to stay with her father, knowing that Simin won't leave Iran without her.But the title also refers to the rural-urban, traditional-modern, moral-utilitarian divides that coalesce to form the main conflict in this movie. After Simin leaves to live with her parents, Nader hires a villager named Razieh to look after his father. Looking after a male patient with dementia is too much for the pregnant Razieh, who must commute three hours to work. When Nader's father soils his pants, the profoundly pious Razieh has a crisis of faith, and seeks religious counsel to see if God will permit her to change the poor man's pants. She's underpaid and exhausted, but ultimately she's bound to the family's misfortunes by her own: her husband has lost his job as a cobbler, has to take medication for the consequent depression, and is in and out of debtors' prison. One day, Nader returns home to find Razieh absent and his father tied to the bed, and he becomes so distraught and angry that he fires Razieh by pushing her out the door. Then Nader and Simin find themselves in a hospital where they learn that Razieh has had a miscarriage. The two families entangle themselves in a legal fight to determine who was culpable for Razieh's miscarriage, and in the process dig themselves deeper and deeper into a moral conundrum.Farhadi manages several neat tricks with this movie. ""A Separation"" is morally complex without being morally confusing, is dramatically tense and emotionally powerful without being melodramatic and emotionally overwhelming, and is sympathetic to all characters and viewpoints while affirming the power of truth and love.Farhadi accomplishes this by building strong contrasts and comparisons between the three sets of characters. There's the two wives Simin and Razieh, while standing with their husbands and across from each other, nevertheless are devout to the ""truth"" (Simin to a modern and metaphysical ""truth,"" Razieh to the Koran), and thus stood together throughout the film.Then there's the two families' daughters who live in different worlds. One scene in a court of law outside the judge's chambers captures how irreconcilable this chasm really is: While waiting for their parents, Termeh is pre-occupied studying for her final exams with the help of her grandmother, while Razieh's 6-year-old daughter looks on with sad bright eyes, having never been inside a classroom and knowing she'll never get into one. But despite their differences they're both united by a child-like attachment to what is right, what is fair, and what is true - an innocence that makes them equally suffer as the film sinks into its moral murkiness.What ultimately drives the plot of the film is the conflict between the two husbands, who are tragically alike. Razieh's husband Hodjat is consumed with anger at his poverty and powerlessness, and he becomes more volatile and violent as he seeks justice for his wife and his unborn child, but feels helpless against a modern middle class urban society that seems to have united against his family. Simin's husband Nader is consumed by pride, which ironically makes this secular man a fanatic, as he seeks to prove his innocence, even if he has to lie, conspire, and abandon his wife to do so.Besides using vivid characterization, Farhadi also manages to balance the complexity, contradictions, and conflicts by filming minimally in interiors. Every scene is either shot inside an apartment or a hospital or a court or a school or a car. He doesn't use wide angles to allow the audience to breathe a bit, nor does he attempt to control mood with music, color, and lighting. But the film's claustrophobia works to the story's advantage, magnifying and reflecting the tension and the anxiety in the characters themselves.What ultimately makes this movie work so well then are the individual performances of all the actors. In his book The Ends of the Earth, Robert Kaplan argues that Westerners have a misconception of Iranians as cold and aloof Muslims, while in reality they're poetic and passionate Persians - which is perhaps why they often make such gifted actors.Towards the climax of the movie, Simin has negotiated a truce with Hodjat to pay ""blood money"" for the miscarriage so that the feuding can stop its downward spiral. Simin and Termeh, who is now living with her mother, go tell the good news to Nader in his apartment. Arguing that by paying he would profess his guilt, he refuses, and Simin walks out angrily. She attempts to take Termeh with her, but Termeh refuses. The 11 year-old fears his father's lies and equivocations, but above all she fears losing him, and so she tries to convince his father to take the deal. Then Nader says to her in that cold calculating manner only he's capable of: ""If you think I'm guilty go get your mother, and I'll do what she wants.""Termeh's facial response powerfully captures so many hues and shades: It's at the same time loud and numb, stunned and aware, hurt and empowered. That one-second facial expression, caught between crying and laughing, reveals that if no one else has changed, she at least has. And she now knows that no matter how much she loves her father he's lost to her and to himself.""A Separation"" is a bold masterpiece of Iranian film-making.",5,Genius,1327622400,"01 27,

The two couples' unwanted entanglement in the judicial system, the strong emotions involved, and the shifting mix of truth-telling and concealment make for a strong story, masterfully told.Other reviews outline the events very well. Some thoughts beyond the story itself:How warm and real the relationships are. Nader has unconditional love for his old and senile father, who hardly even recognizes him. Both Nader and Simin adore their daughter, so much so that Nader knows as long as Termeh stays with him, Simin will never go the West. When Simin and Razieh talk, woman to woman, there is mutual respect that transcends class differences.The Islamic clothing for the women didn't bother me - in fact the omnipresent headscarves looked quite attractive. It rapidly came to seem quite natural and suitable, not in any way ""suppressing"" them but in fact making one see them more fully as persons. I began to see why Muslims are bothered by the West's more revealing dress. Of course, we're not talking burkas here - these go way too far!The sessions with the judge - very reminiscent of the French ""juge d'instruction"" - were fascinating. I could see the merits of a process that is absolutely dedicated to finding out the truth, not in creating the most plausible story. However, it would depend on all the judges being as steady and perceptive as the one in the film - is that possible? Hmm....But finally the film's overriding merit is to remind us, vividly, that the people of Iran are just trying to live their lives, raise their children, get through their problems, just as we are.

Van Hoy III,"[0, 0]","This film while being an interesting human drama showing the helplessness of free will determining destiny - a common theme in so many middle eastern films.  It is above all else a window into how little difference there is living a middle class life in Iran today vs. here.  I was constantly surprised at the creature comfort (mod cons) level of what I assumed are a typical Iranian family.  The problems of dealing with government justice and day to day moral issues in a Muslim society mirrored themes familiar to us here.  The characters where complex and all the more interesting because of their religious paradigms.  The patience and familial interactions were admirable and the theme, while overlaid with the social requirements that are unique to that country, can't avoid being compared to lives here.  I think this film is very watchable and works to take you to highs and lows as well as any movie I have seen lately.

1486839,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B005LAIIIK,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 0]","I was about halfway into &#34;A Separation&#34; when I noticed that the fim was unrelentingly claustrophobic. Many scenes took place in hallways, or were shot through doorways, and there was almost always a wall or some other barrier present, even if it was just the back of someone's head. The outdoor scenes offered little relief, with the same walls or other enclosures, and any vista of sky reduced to a mere patch. If the point was to emphasize how the characters' lives were circumscribed by the limitations imposed by the old man's condition, the culture, the religion, and the legal system, then the filmmakers succeeded, albeit in a heavy-handed and obvious way. I'm not sure it would have been possible to have directed the film in this manner without the motif being so apparent.Another interesting choice was to not show the divorce court judge at the beginning and end of the film - the camera is from his POV, but we never see him the way we see the criminal court judge. This communicates the idea that this particular aspect of the Iranian legal system is impersonal, all-seeing, almost godlike, while the criminal courts are just another bureaucracy.Other reviewers are praising the ending for being &#34;un-Hollywood&#34; in that it is unresolved; I would say that the ending is a cop-out. The girl repeats several times that she has made her decision, but we never learn what it is - like Schrodinger's cat, the situation is ambiguous as long as it remains unknown to us. There's no deep philosophical message here - it's just a refusal or inability to end the film, and ultimately unsatisfying, as if the filmmakers couldn't decide themselves what they wanted. A tidy &#34;resolution&#34; isn't necessary. Ending it with the girl saying that she had decided to stay with both parents, forcing them to work out the details without specifying exactly how this would be accomplished, would have finished the film with sufficient &#34;un-Hollywood ambiguity.&#34;Overall, well done in that for a dialogue-driven film, the characters' interactions were believable, and a good exposition of the effect that caring for a sick, elderly parent can have on a family.",4,Cinematography tells the story,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,2176,"['was', 'about', 'halfway', '34', 'A', 'Separation', '34', 'when', 'noticed', 'fim', 'was', 'unrelentingly', 'claustrophobic', 'Many', 'scenes', 'took', 'place', 'hallways', 'were', 'shot', 'doorways', 'was', 'almost', 'always', 'wall', 'other', 'barrier', 'present', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'back', 'someone', 'head', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'offered', 'little', 'relief', 'same', 'walls', 'other', 'enclosures', 'vista', 'sky', 'reduced', 'mere', 'patch', 'point', 'was', 'emphasize', 'how', 'characters', 'lives', 'were', 'circumscribed', 'limitations', 'imposed', 'old', 'man', 'condition', 'culture', 'religion', 'legal', 'system', 'then', 'filmmakers', 'succeeded', 'albeit', 'heavy-handed', 'obvious', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'have', 'directed', 'film', 'manner', 'motif', 'being', 'so', 'apparent.Another', 'interesting', 'choice', 'was', 'not', 'show', 'divorce', 'court', 'judge', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'camera', 'POV', 'never', 'see', 'way', 'see', 'criminal', 'court', 'judge', 'idea', 'particular', 'aspect', 'Iranian', 'legal', 'system', 'impersonal', 'all-seeing', 'almost', 'godlike', 'criminal', 'courts', 'are', 'just', 'bureaucracy.Other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'praising', 'ending', 'being', '34', 'un-Hollywood', '34', 'unresolved', 'would', 'say', 'ending', 'cop-out', 'girl', 'several', 'times', 'made', 'decision', 'never', 'learn', 'what', 'Schrodinger', 'cat', 'situation', 'ambiguous', 'as', 'long', 'unknown', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'message', 'here', 'just', 'refusal', 'inability', 'end', 'film', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'wanted', 'A', 'tidy', '34', 'resolution', '34', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'Ending', 'girl', 'saying', 'had', 'decided', 'stay', 'parents', 'forcing', 'work', 'out', 'details', 'specifying', 'exactly', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'accomplished', 'would', 'have', 'finished', 'film', 'sufficient', '34', 'un-Hollywood', 'ambiguity.', '34', 'Overall', 'well', 'done', 'dialogue-driven', 'film', 'characters', 'interactions', 'were', 'believable', 'good', 'exposition', 'effect', 'caring', 'sick', 'elderly', 'parent', 'can', 'have', 'family']",N/A

1486843,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B005LAIIIK,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","""A Separation"" is a brilliant film out of Iran and given today's political climate I'm afraid I have to wonder when we'll see another fine Iranian film again. After reading the fine reviews posted here already, there is little new information I can give you about the general plot and the way the film portrays life. I will say, however, that I agree with the reviewers who write that this stunning film explores separations between parents, classes in Iranian society with all that that implies; the separation between the devout religious Iranians and other Iranians who live a more secular, modern day world life; the contrast between the past represented by Nader's elderly father and the future represented by Simin and Nader's young daughter--and more. Interestingly enough, despite all the dichotomies, the principle characters all come in shades of grey; there are no clear cut heroes or villains and that's quite something!The plot moves along well and despite its two hour length things never progressed too slowly. Indeed, I was fascinated by the story as it unfolded. The acting is superlative; all of the actors, both experienced and not so experienced give nuanced, convincing and passionate performances that I won't forget anytime soon. The choreography and the cinematography reflect great forethought and the musical score enhances the film as well.When the action starts we quickly meet Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moadi). While Simin wants to leave Iran with their daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) for a better quality of life, Nader wants to stay in Iran and take care of his father who has Alzheimer's disease. Things are so bad between Simin and Nader that they go before a judge for a divorce but the judge will not grant them a divorce. Simin pretends to leave the country to manipulate Nader and Termeh but in reality Simin goes to stay with her mother. Termeh stays with Nader knowing that Simin would never leave the country without her--thus Termeh tries to keep her parents together.Now that Simin is living elsewhere, Nader hires a highly religious woman Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to look after his father while he is working; but after Nader's father soils his pants Razieh feels she can no longer look after Nader's father because of her religious beliefs. While there's more to this that you'll discover when you watch this film, essentially Nader accuses Razieh of stealing money and tying his father down to the bed while she goes out on what was supposedly an errand; and he fires her. In the ensuing argument Nader literally throws Razieh out and things become very complicated and serious after that. Razieh and her infuriated husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) file a criminal complaint against Nader for not paying Razieh and more; and Nader states before the same judge that Razieh stole money from him and almost killed his father by leaving him alone tied to the bed. The rest of the plot reveals how all this works out although there is a plot twist at the very end of the film that will leave you watching the ending credits with baited breath!In addition, look for excellent performances by Ali-Asghar Shahbazi as Nader's father; Shirin Yazdanbakhsh as Simin's mother; Merila Zare'I as Miss Ghahraii; Kimia Hosseini as Somayeh and Babak Karimi as the interrogator/judge.I recommend ""A Separation"" for people who appreciate five star foreign films; this motion picture more than earned its awards and accolades!

The judge refuses the divorce, but Simin moves out of the house anyway.With Simin gone, Nader hires a young married woman to stay with and care for his father while he is working.  However, after Nader comes home one day to find the caretaker gone; his father tied to his bed and unconscious, emotions and events escalate to the point where the lives of all parties are put into jeopardy and changed forever...not necessarily for the better.A SEPARATION is an engrossing drama with some surprising story twists.

Many Americans will not watch 'a movie you have to read' as they usually put it, but I find that foreign flicks give the viewer more than what Hollywood pumps out.'A Separation' was excellent. The storytelling was universal in a way that rarely comes along. The acting by the old man was phenomenal, tears welled up in my eyes while thinking of an aged old man, barely there anymore... the actor portrayed it perfectly. Also the father and daughter were terrific, along with the old man's aide, who really was the best of them all. When she was on the bus going to work after the old man was wondering outside the day before... the look on her face was downright heartbreaking... One big drawback, for me, was the mothers acting. She kept pulling a face like she was on the verge of smiling. Almost making herself look as attractive as possible because there was a camera in her face. I found it distracting and was glad she wasn't in the film that often... When she was supposed to look disappointed or frustrated, she didn't pull it off in the least. The other actors made up for her amateurish attempt to act.The first half of the film was fast paced.. The second half was slower which made it drag on in a way I'm not used to. If a film 'drags on' its usually a negative thing, but I don't mean it in a negative way, I'm not sure really how to describe it. It set the pace sort of thing.(no spoilers) The ending... I really liked it, but can see how people would be disappointed because the conclusion didn't really come. It wasn't like the movie just ended in the middle of a scene though. The viewer is supposed to use their brain to decide what happened. Much like one of my favorites '2001: A Space Odyssey' you are supposed to be thinking and not simply have everything in the movie explained.Getting on to the blu ray. Sound was good, but it's a dialogue driven film (it was in 3.0 not 5.1 or 7.1) Picture was sometimes great, sometimes not. It looked a little fuzzy at times (I don't think it was the transfer, rather the look that was intended by the director..)

1486853,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B005LAIIIK,Paul Allaer,"[1, 1]","""A Separation"" (2011 release from Iran; 123 min.) brings a complex family and morality drama, set in Tehran, of all places. The movie starts off with the 2 main characters, Nader and Simin, in front of a family judge to hear Simin's request for a divorce if her hysband doesn't want to move abroad along with their 11 yr. old daughter. Nader refuses, and knowing full well that Simin will not leave the country without her daughter, Simin moves out and back in with her parents (hence, the ""separation""). This necessitates Nader to hire someone to take care of his ailing father who suffers from Alzheimer's, while Nader is at work during the day. The woman he hires to help is pregnant and for reasons too long to explain here, at some point he and the woman get into a heated argument, he shoves her out the door of the apartment, she falls and she miscarries (another ""separation""). The woman's husband files a complaint and a court must determine who is at fault, who knew what when, and what the penalty should be.It takes the movie about 25-30 min. to set the table for the unfolding drama, and while I was a bit unsure in that first half hour what direction the movie would take, once it all started clicking I have to say I was blown away at all levels.  Let's start with writer-director Asghar Farhadi, who has a clear vision for the film, and maps it all out. But wait, there is much more. The acting is simply superb, starting with the wife who leaves, played by Leila Hatami (I don't think I've ever seen a redhaired Iranian woman before), her husband (played by Peyman Moaadi), all the way to their 11 yr. old daughter, played by Sarina Farhadi, who is an acting revelation (just wait until you see the very last scene of the movie, it will amaze you).""A Seapartion"" won this year's Oscar fro Best Foreign Movie, and deservedly so (even though there were other strong contenders, check out also Belgium's ""Bullhead""). I read somewhere that the production budget for ""A Separation"" was a mere $500,000, proving once again that it doesn't take mega-millions to make an engaging and terrific film (by contrast, Disney's new movie ""John Carter"" has a rumored production budget of $250 million). Most interestingly, while the Iranian government did not provide any financial assistance to ""A Separation"", it did not ban the movie from being made or from being shown in local theaters. Last but not least, one of the pleasures watching this movie are the glimpses one can detect of the ""ordinary"" life in Teheran. In all, ""A Seperation"" is a must-see for any foreign movie buff, or for anyone interested in an intellectually challenging movie.

I had watched an earlier Iranian Oscar nominee that was pretty good but I was not really prepared to expect a sudden series of 5 star movies from Iran.  However, ""A Separation"" IS a five star movie.From the beginning, the film seems to hold back enough details that we are never quite sure what is happening or about to happen.  There are scenes that seem to be brief and unimportant yet, later in the film, things seem to depend on those earlier scenes.  I was watching a rented movie and I could have rewound to double check certain scenes (and one in particular).  However, I realized that the film challeged me to make the same kind of on-the-spot decisions that we have to confront in real life and real time.  I still have only watched the one viewing start to finish and I am realizing that to see the film another time would probably both add and take away from its' impact.  The ending is wonderfully left open to interpretation.

Her husband, who she sees as honest and good wants to remain in Iran in order to take care of his father who has Alzheimer's disease.  During their initial separation, wife moves out to live with her family while her 11 year old daughter remains to live with the father in hope that her parents will reconcile and stay together.  In order to take care of the ill father while at work, husband hires a woman to be his caretaker.  Her devout religious convictions cause conflict in her on how to take care of him at times when the old man needs to have his clothes changed.  One day, tragic turn of events puts into motion series of events that lead to serious law suit that can lead to a long prison sentence or expensive settlement between various parties.At times unnecessarily protracted, this film provides a look at society in Iran.  It shows class difference within society; complicated relationship between man and wife when their loyalties split between his desire to take care of his father and her desire to secure her daughter's future.  Both people have noble ideals for their family, but their loyalties to these two very different causes are irreconcilable considering the circumstances.

1486859,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B005LAIIIK,RMurray847,"[6, 6]","A SEPARATION is a film about a group of good, decent people who fall into enormous, soul-shattering ethical and legal dilemmas in part because they are trying to do good.  To be righteous.  To be free from sin.  To take care of their children.  And it all falls apart so easily, right before our eyes.Set in modern day Iran, the issues of the film are very much rooted in that society...and yet they are universally understandable.  It's a tiny story and it's a big story that speaks to everyone.  It's important that the film is set in Iran, because of the laws and culture that will weigh so heavily on the main characters.  But it feels surprisingly relevant and very close & credible.The film begins as the main couple of the story, Nader & Simin, are appearing before a judge of some kind.  They are intelligent, attractive, educated and fond of each other.  But their lives are about to take divergent paths.  Simin is asking for a divorce from her husband, because she wants to be able to leave the country with her teenage daughter, who is a bright, studious girl with a great future ahead of her in a country that doesn't put so many obstacles in front of women.  Nader does not want to leave, because he feels he must stay and take care of his Alzheimer's -ridden father.  Simin advocates that the father go into a home, because he doesn't know his son...and because the welfare of their daughter comes first.  Simin seems both callous to her husband's desire to tend to his beloved father, and she seems completely right too.  Her daughter NEEDS a chance to fulfill her promise.The parents dote on their terrific girl.  She loves them.  She loves her wretched grandfather.  They are a terrific if troubled family.  But Simin moves out of the house, and Nader must hire a woman to tend to his father while he is at work.  Razieh comes to the job from a long commute away, accompanied by her small daughter.  She is likely from the country, and wears more traditional, conservative clothing.  She is lower class, devote, shy and frightened by the job she has undertaken.From this simple setup develops a complicated story of misunderstandings, cultural roadblocks, honor betrayed, legal machinations and the sickening realization that everyone is digging themselves into holes from which they cannot emerge unscathed.I don't want to tell you anymore, because the joy of this film lies in part in discovering its secrets.  All the characters, even Razieh's hot-headed husband, are mostly good people who make some small but unfortunate choices.  It's a chilling film in many ways, because while the passions run hot in these characters as they fight for their souls, they must maintain a mantle of politeness and respect.  Their culture demands manners, even as it prevents them from expressing what is REALLY on their minds.This is a small story, as I said.  It involves primarily two families and their troubles.  Nothing that happens would ever make the news, even on a small scale.  The world churns on around them, completely oblivious to their plight.  And yet, for the viewer, the film quietly grabs your attention in its opening moments, and simply does not let go.  In part, this is because the script (Oscar nominated) makes each and every person a distinct, fleshed-out and understandable character.  If you've ever wondered what folks mean when they decry a movie's lack of character development, check out A SEPARATION.  You'll understand what true characters are.The film is brilliantly acted, as well.  Every part offers juicy moments for the actors and they tear into their work.  Peyman Moadi as Nader and Leila Hatami as Simin are fantastic, but no one really lags behind.  Young Sarina Farhadi as the daughter Termeh is heartbreaking, and special notice must go to Ali-Asghar Shahbazi as the elderly father.  He's so immersed in his role, you forget utterly that this is an actor portraying a man with Alzheimer's.For me, 2011 was not a great year for movies.  Very few moved me.  THE ARTIST and THE DESCENDANTS were delightful and excellent...but did not make me lean forward in my seat in utter engrossment.  Finally, A SEPARATION (even though I saw it in 2012) came along and in its subtle power, made me remember how worthwhile the wait is for a truly great movie.",5,Likely the best film of 2011.

1486862,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B005LAIIIK,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Going strictly by its press releases, one might conclude that the Oscar-winning ""A Separation""  is mainly about the difficulties Iranian couples face in procuring a divorce. But that turns out to be a fairly small part of the movie, actually.  In fact, on a political level, the film is more of an indictment of a legal system wherein a person who inadvertently causes a woman to have a miscarriage can be charged with the murder of that child.But politics and social reform take a back seat in the movie to its human drama, as writer/director Asghar Farhadi provides us with a naturalistic tale of ordinary, decent people trying - but often failing - to lead ordinary, decent lives in a world too often ruled by the cruel exigencies of random chance.Simin (Leila Hatami) is seeking a divorce from her husband, Nader (Peyman Moaddi).  It's not that she really wants a divorce; it's that she wants the two of them to move out of the country with their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Fahadi), to seek a more promising future for themselves somewhere else, but Nader wants to stay in the country to take care of his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's.  However, the judge deems that there are not sufficient grounds in this case to grant a divorce.  When Simin moves back in with her parents, Nader is forced to hire a woman (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father during the day while he's at work.  It is at that point that the real trouble begins.I don't want to give much more of the plot away than that; suffice it to say, the movie is a realistic drama made up of characters who are neither heroes nor villains, sinners nor saints.  There's plenty of blame to go around for what happens in the story - and at times it feels a bit like an episode of Adults Behaving Badly - but Farhadi always make us aware of just how flawed but well-intentioned these wholly recognizable figures are.  Their customs and religious beliefs may seem a bit foreign to Western eyes, but the issues of marital discord, of caring for an elderly parent, of trying but often failing at being a role model for one's children, and of refusing to accept the consequences of one's actions are universal in their scope and nature.There's a certain redundancy in the narrative and an occasional flatness in the storytelling, but excellent performances and a bravely inconclusive, lady-or-the-tiger fadeout hold us in the movie's thrall.",4,"naturalistic in style, universal in scope",1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,2421,"['Going', 'strictly', 'press', 'releases', 'one', 'might', 'conclude', 'Oscar-winning', 'Separation', 'mainly', 'difficulties', 'Iranian', 'couples', 'face', 'procuring', 'divorce', 'out', 'be', 'fairly', 'small', 'part', 'movie', 'actually', 'fact', 'political', 'level', 'film', 'more', 'indictment', 'legal', 'system', 'wherein', 'person', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'woman', 'have', 'miscarriage', 'can', 'be', 'charged', 'murder', 'child.But', 'politics', 'social', 'reform', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'movie', 'human', 'drama', 'writer/director', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi', 'naturalistic', 'tale', 'ordinary', 'decent', 'people', 'trying', 'often', 'failing', 'lead', 'ordinary', 'decent', 'lives', 'world', 'too', 'often', 'ruled', 'cruel', 'exigencies', 'random', 'chance.Simin', 'Leila', 'Hatami', 'seeking', 'divorce', 'husband', 'Nader', 'Peyman', 'Moaddi', 'not', 'really', 'divorce', 'two', 'move', 'country', '11-year-old', 'daughter', 'Termeh', 'Sarina', 'Fahadi', 'seek', 'more', 'promising', 'future', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Nader', 'stay', 'country', 'take', 'care', 'father', 'who', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'However', 'judge', 'are', 'not', 'sufficient', 'grounds', 'case', 'grant', 'divorce', 'When', 'Simin', 'back', 'parents', 'Nader', 'forced', 'hire', 'woman', 'Sareh', 'Bayat', 'take', 'care', 'father', 'day', 'work', 'point', 'real', 'trouble', 'begins.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'away', 'suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'realistic', 'drama', 'made', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'heroes', 'villains', 'sinners', 'saints', 'plenty', 'blame', 'go', 'around', 'what', 'story', 'times', 'bit', 'episode', 'Adults', 'Behaving', 'Badly', 'Farhadi', 'always', 'make', 'aware', 'just', 'how', 'flawed', 'well-intentioned', 'wholly', 'recognizable', 'figures', 'are', 'customs', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'foreign', 'Western', 'eyes', 'issues', 'marital', 'discord', 'caring', 'elderly', 'parent', 'trying', 'often', 'failing', 'being', 'role', 'model', 'one', 'children', 'refusing', 'accept', 'consequences', 'one', 'actions', 'are', 'universal', 'scope', 'certain', 'redundancy', 'narrative', 'occasional', 'flatness', 'storytelling', 'excellent', 'performances', 'bravely', 'inconclusive', 'lady-or-the-tiger', 'fadeout', 'hold', 'movie', 'thrall']",N/A

Apart from the static opening shots,the camera is constantly moving,framing and reframing tight groupings of people in confined spaces,shifting perspectives,not privileging any one viewpoint.The camera doesn't show all the details explicitly.Some angles prevent the viewer from seeing this,without the viewer suspecting the camera is hiding anything.To show everything would give the game away.Farhadi doesn't overwrite,we read between the lines,forcing the audience to think back to earlier scenes to understand better what is happening.The characters underplay the feelings,allowing the camera to pick up their intentions from their expressions and gestures.The children are given pivotal roles,they are the real judges.Between the old man,Nader's father,who doesn't remember the past and the children who haven't had much life experience,what links the characters is they have no control over their own destiny.It is other people who tell them how to live their lives.Language and words exist for better communication between people,but they are also the source of misunderstandings.We see a separation between the middle-class secular couple and the working-class devout couple who are financially struggling.The film is less interested in probing the emotions of a fracturing marriage than in using the situation to question the ethical and moral dilemmas and issues of class and religion that face Iranians today.The relationship between the father and daughter is the central one.Nader's daughter Termeh emerges as the film's moral focus.She has to choose who to live with,her father or mother.She must already at age 11 decide her own fate,her 1st step as a grown-up.A film of great ambiguity and self-awareness stripping away all our prejudices about Iran and

There is little this reviewer can add to the reviews already on this website without repeating what has been said. This work is an inspired masterpiece. It hosts a well-written and constructed script;  full dimensional characters which  are not cardboard caricatures given to us by Hollywood; real-life situations that are totally believable and to which anyone can identify; the acting is; perfectly executed and convincing acting; and strong direction.This is an amazing film by any standard. The fact that it was made at all is a miracle. The Iranian government initially would not allow the film to be made, for political reasons. Deft diplomacy by the director allowed the green light for this film to be made.On a deeper level this film underscores that differences in politics or government or society in the present age are largely irrelevant. This is a couple everyone can identify with; the situations faced by this family could have happened in Europe, North America, or the Far East. This film tends to contradict a saying attributed to Leo Tolstoy, That happy people are happy for the same reason, but unhappy people have their own individual reasons for that unhappiness. Here, the cause of the family tension in Simin and Nadar's marriage could have existed in California, yet the locale of the movie is in Teheran. The anguish experienced by their daughter Termeh could be shared with any adolescent. Simin's and Nadar's use of Termeh as a bargaining chip to leverage control in their divorce is sadly not uncommon in dissolution matters. Add to this mix issues of integrity, pride, personal responsibility and honesty, and the final result is a compelling family drama.This movie is not meant for casual viewing. While a fine film in its own right, Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage is far too cerebral and rarified, even though the subject matter is completely different. In that movie you can fall asleep listening to Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson talk. Here, the story of Nadar and Simin will grab you and pull you in. Scene after compelling scene will force you to pay attention and watch the drama playing out before your eyes. This movie won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film for 2011.

1486870,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005LAIIIK,Turfseer,"[15, 18]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***With the release of the superb 'A Separation', director Ashgar Farhadi has done much to open peoples' eyes that Iran is a much more complex society than has generally been perceived in the West. The film's title might lead one to believe that this story is merely about the separation of a husband and wife but it's much more than that--at times I felt I was watching a Hitchcock-like thriller, with all the attendant twists and turns associated with the suspense master himself.In a sense, the separation between Nader and Simin, the secular middle class couple who are seen at the beginning of the film in a divorce court, is the catalyst for all the stunning developments to come. Because the judge rejects Simin's application for a divorce, she returns to her parents' home and leaves Nader, along with their eleven year old daughter Termeh (magnificently played by Sarina Farhadi, the director's real-life daughter) to care for Nader's Alzheimer's-stricken father.Nader is the film's protagonist and should be seen as an admirable and complex character. Some may view him as foolhardy to continue taking care of his father, virtually on his own, but his decision is a testament to the strength and nobility of his character. Note the subtle scene where he orders Termeh to return a tip to a gas station attendant, after the attendant fails to perform a required service, thus teaching his daughter not only the value of hard work but also to be assertive (especially in a society where women are not always encouraged to be like that).The film's antagonist, Razieh, is also a complex character. She shows up at Nader's house with her young daughter, having agreed to work as a domestic, taking care of Nader's father. Razieh is from a lower middle class background, dresses in a conservation Chador and ends up consulting a religious phone hot line, asking for advice whether it's against Muslim religious law to wash Nader's father. Even when the Iman tells her that she's permitted to do so, she understandably has a very hard time performing such unsavory work.Nonetheless, Razieh uses remarkably poor judgment by tying up Nader's father and leaving the home to keep a doctor's appointment. Perhaps it's her unfamiliarity with elderly people stricken with Alzheimer's, that leads her to believe that such a senile man will be okay on his own, while she leaves the home. It's also quite understandable that Nader ends up quite upset to find Razieh gone and his father on the floor, hardly breathing. When Razieh returns, he berates her, discovers money missing and concludes that she was responsible for stealing it. What Nader wasn't aware of, was that Simin had earlier paid movers with the money. Now it's Razieh's turn to become upset as she's been falsely accused of stealing the money and then makes things worse in Nader's eyes, for requesting her day's pay. We break into Act 2, when Nader pushes Razieh out the door, leading her to accuse him of causing the miscarriage of her baby.The ensuing complications are too detailed to list here but let me say that director Farhadi has done a masterful job in chronicling the day to day operations of the Iranian justice system. Again, it's a nuanced portrait of a Judge who seems almost bored by being forced to sit through one conflicting domestic situation after another as well as revealing an attitude of inflexibility in applying the vagaries of the Iranian penal code. Nonetheless, it's not a complete kangaroo court, as investigations do seem to be ordered and there is a modicum of an attempt to ascertain the true facts.While we do learn Nader is found to have lied to the court when he denies knowing that Razieh was pregnant, even Termeh realizes that sometimes 'white lies' are necessary and perjures herself before the Court, to ensure that her father doesn't go to prison and his life is not ruined.Equally fascinating is Razieh's husband Hodjat's machinations in his quest for justice, which ends up more like a thirst for revenge. Hodjat represents the dark side of the Iranian populace. He's a hothead, who will take extra-judicial steps including threatening Termeh's tutor, who testified in Nader's defense. Hodjat is so menacing that the tutor even changes her testimony which jeopardizes Nader's case. Hodjat still is operating under the mistaken belief that his wife's claims are legitimate but when we learn that Razieh lost the baby because she was hit by a car (while outside looking for Nader's father who had wandered out of the house), Razieh's honor becomes much more questionable than that of her husband. After all, Razieh refuses to swear on the Koran, not because she's ashamed of accusing an innocent man, but because she fears that by testifying falsely, Allah may seek revenge on her and her daughter for her sins.It's up to Simin to finally convince Nader to compensate Razieh's family. While Nader earlier casts Simin as someone who too easily runs away from difficult conflicts, he realizes the only way out is to compromise and pay compensation to Razieh's family. Of all the characters in the film, Simin is perhaps the most thinly drawn. Why does she want to leave Iran? Is it because she's tired of taking care of Nader's father? We don't find out that much about her but when she and Nader argue, the scenes are electric.Justice is finally served when Razieh refuses to swear on the Koran. As the legitimacy over Razieh's initial accusation and Nader's debt to her family is resolved, the subplot concerning the pending custody of Termeh is not. We're left to guess which parent Termeh chooses to live with at film's end.'A Separation' is a superb film which, if it only could be, should not only be nominated for Best Foreign language film but for the Academy's 'Best Picture' as well.",5,Superb Iranian domestic drama and suspense thriller deserves all the accolades heaped upon it!,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,5830,"['***', 'review', 'may',

1486873,A366K6G0ISLX7Q,B005LAIIIK,vs,"[3, 6]","I watched both Separation and Fireworks Wednesday by Asghar Farhadi. Both movies are very good. They are very much alike too. In part it's because of Farhadi's recognizable style, but to an extent the characters in the movies are very similar, young working couples, city dwellers, pretty much like Manhattenites in Woody Allen movies, probably more so.Even though there's no adultery and jealousy  in Separation (which are prominently present  in Fireworks Wednesday), still one cannot but see these movies as parts of one single story of life in an Iranian city. Married couples, small kids getting involved in their parent's complex relationships, in-laws and neighbors - these people are present in both films.Yes, the story in Separation is more tragic and even has some detective/whodunit line, definitely more convoluted and has some more or less unexpected turns, maybe it even has certain philosophical dimension, but... to my taste, Fireworks Wednesday is more subtle and poignant.I won't say either film is so much better than the other, they're both good, but I don't think either of them deserves this much of acclaim the're getting. One only needs to compare them with Distant by Nuri Bilge Ceylan to see that we probably can expect a bit more subtlety from modern cinema than is present in Asghar Farhadi's films.",4,"very good movie, but...",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1328,"['watched', 'Separation', 'Fireworks', 'Wednesday', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'too', 'part', 'Farhadi', 'recognizable', 'style', 'extent', 'characters', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'young', 'working', 'couples', 'city', 'dwellers', 'pretty', 'much', 'Manhattenites', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'probably', 'more', 'so.Even', 'adultery', 'jealousy', 'Separation', 'are', 'prominently', 'present', 'Fireworks', 'Wednesday', 'still', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'movies', 'parts', 'one', 'single', 'story', 'life', 'Iranian', 'city', 'Married', 'couples', 'small', 'kids', 'getting', 'involved', 'parent', 'complex', 'relationships', 'in-laws', 'neighbors', 'people', 'are', 'present', 'films.Yes', 'story', 'Separation', 'more', 'tragic', 'even', 'detective/whodunit', 'line', 'definitely', 'more', 'convoluted', 'more', 'less', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'maybe', 'even', 'certain', 'philosophical', 'dimension', 'taste', 'Fireworks', 'Wednesday', 'more', 'subtle', 'poignant.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'either', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'other', ""'re"", 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'acclaim', ""'re"", 'getting', 'One', 'only', 'compare', 'Distant', 'Nuri', 'Bilge', 'Ceylan', 'see', 'probably', 'can', 'expect', 'bit', 'more', 'subtlety', 'modern', 'cinema', 'present', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi', 'films']",N/A
