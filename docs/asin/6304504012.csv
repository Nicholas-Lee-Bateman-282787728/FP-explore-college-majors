Madonna wasnt the original choice Gloria Estefan was but Parker and the studio heads though tshe wasn't bankable and went with Madonna.  Who had to take voice lessons- finally!  The results are worth it madonna is not an actress and never will be-she just doesnt have the presence. She has built this persona as MADONNA that you cant see her as anything else and the definition of an actor is to be a chameleon.  But What she does here is give you the best video of her career she mourns at you and begs for you ta accept he rinterpertaion of the materials.  And i do accept it. Bandeas is good here if not a bit overwhelming but the true star here is the cinematography.

426867,ASC5CH6RALOHL,6304504012,"Alden Utter ""nedlum""","[3, 4]","Evita is a good film on many levels. As a musical, it has a fantastic soundtrack; songs such as ""High Flying, Adored"" and ""Waltz for Evita and Ch&eacute;"" stay with you long after the credits finish. As a bioepic, it is also strong, giving the viewer the feel for the rapid rise and fall of Eva Duarte. And, needless to say, as a Madonna movie, it's practically Citizen Kane.However, there is another way of looking at the film: as a statement about government. The nameless everyman played by Antonio Banderas is named ""Ch&eacute;"" where he is named at all, an almost certain reference to Ch&eacute; Guevara. And the film itself shows Juan Peron rise to power as a populist general, only to turn against his people as a dictator as brutal as those that preceded him. Eva was used to distract people as their liberties were trampled; ""She's the one that's kept us where we are"" Juan sings. And when she dies (it happens at the start, so it's hardly a spoiler), Ch&eacute; rightly sings that ""Your queen is dead, your king is through). Evita held the government in place, and it will crumble with out her, because of it's repressive ruleAnd... um, I guess I may have sort of wandered off here.

Madonna stars in movie as the title role of Evita. This movie is the story of Argentina's former first lady, Eva Peron. This film starts from the end and then goes from beginning to end. It shows how she went to Buenos Aires with a tango singer. It shows hows Eva took on lovers to get jobs, and even helped her husband, who is played by Jonathan Pryce, get the presidency for 2 terms. She and her husband did have 2 weddings, one was in a church and one was a civil ceremony. Eva also traveled while she was first lady. She got woman the right to vote. She also did start a foundation. She did help build houses, hopitals, and schools. When her husband went for his 2nd term as president, the people rallied for her to be vice-president. Eva Peron did had many Christain Dior, over 100 furs, and a jewelry collection comparable to Cleopatra's. Sadly, Evita died when she was just 33, of uterine cancer.

426871,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,6304504012,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","""Evita"" is a surprising synthesis of Andrew Lloyd Webber and pop diva Madonna. Both are known for flighty works-such asCats - The Musical (Commemorative Edition)andMaterial Girl / Pretender (Rmx), but together, they made showbiz magic in this extravaganza about Argentina's Spiritual Leader, goddess, actress, and First Lady Evita Peron. Madonna is electrifying as the South American diva, be she belting out ""The New Argentina"" as her husband Juan (Jonathan Pryce) comes to power, the powerful ""Don't cry for me Argentina"", exhilarated in the ""Rainbow Tour"", or desperate in the ""You Must Love Me"" that was specially penned for the film. Madonna gives the musical body-but Antonio Banderas, Pedro Almodovar's male Muse (Law of Desire,Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,Matador (1986)) is the soul as Evita's conscience, Che Guevara.Antonio Banderas has stage presence, so to speak. Though he represents the Everyman, questioning Evita's rise to power (""Flying High"",""Waltz of Evita&Che;""), he stands out. He's enamored, confused, the one who questions the disappearances of the Perons' enemies, while kissing her coffin in the end when Juan will not.Exposing the Real Che Guevara: And the Useful Idiots Who Idolize Himis a good antidote, but Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice intended for Che to be Evita's working class counterpart for a reason. It's a musical, not real life.""Evita"" does gloss over the Perons' misdeeds to a certain extent... but the point is to show the emptiness of Evita's fantasies, her delusions of grandeur. Both Evita and Juan were a match. There's a musical sequence of Evita sleeping her way to power-Juan was not that different with his various mistresses (""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"") In a way, they were compatible. Jonathan Pryce, who was the emotionally unavailable Lytton Strachey opposite Emma Thompson's DoraCarrington, is equally convincing as Juan Peron, who really can't face the rejection of his teenaged mistress, or Evita's cancer. In real life, Juan physically&emotionally; abandoned Evita when she was dying-and he made her wear a mask, despite the fact she suffered from cervical cancer. Yet once she died, he displayed her embalmed body on his dining room table with his new wife Isabel. Isabel combed the dead Evita's hair daily. She became a symbol. In the opening Requiem, Evita is equated with the Virgin Mary. An interesting companion to Webber's ""Evita"" is David Byrne/Fatboy Slim'sHere Lies Love (2CD)about the Philippines' First Lady, Imelda Marcos.""Evita"" is an electrifying musical.

Not that I'm a giant fan of Madonna's, but my wife swore by the film and it did garner significant awards consideration, so I was intrigued and certainly wanted to check it out for myself.  After the first scene I knew that this was not going to be an easy viewing.  The poorly constructed film barely lets us in to see why Evita was so well loved.  I mean, basically she whored herself into prominence, sang to her people about their unnecessary tears and then died.  There is no depth given to her.  By the films end I knew who she was and how she got there, but I didn't care about it because I was never really told why she did anything.Madonna sings under hear breath a lot and sells her big moment well enough, but not well enough to validate that Golden Globe she tucked away because of this tragic experience.  Banderas is an embarrassment.  The man can sing and yet he sings almost as dreadfully as Brosnan did in that other ill-advised musical `Mama Mia'.  He also serves as like a narrator of sorts who pops up everywhere to tell us about the political upheaval and Evita's health and what-have-you.  There is some beautiful photography, but overall this is a complete mess.

Not only is the continuity vulgarized, the director often manages to confuse the film viewer as to what exactly is going on. This is not a great film, not even a good one, what carries it are the production values, songs, and locations.After getting through the extremely boring commencement of the picture, I noticed that there would be no dialogue in this picture at all, at every moment someone was singing a silly and repetitive song. This isn't bad in its whole, but when everyone is already confused about the character it becomes extremely agitating. The voice dubs of the songs are so apparent that the film seems contrived and indifferent to its tackiness. Here we have people that are supposed to be singing and yet the contorted sound room song is playing and they are merely mouthing their parts. Banderas is terrible in his singing abilities yet his presence is well recommended.

Everytime this has been attemped, historically, the results are bad, most adaptions of famous shows are only OK at best, some  are awful.  The medium is totally different, the demands are different,  the singing is different, the acting style is different. Yes, the shows  usually are &quot;better&quot;, in a sense,  that's how it was originally  written, as a stage play. You have got to really change things to make a  successful movie.So how good an ADAPTION is this?  Very good indeed.  The story was changed to very effectively fit the medium. Madonna stretched  herself unbelievably to do this role, and I think she did very well. You  may quite validly prefer the stage version of Evita (I like both), but its  almost like apples and oranges. As good as Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin  were, they would, if they played it the same way anyway, come off mannered  and absurd in a movie context. All the conventions of the stage would be  laughable. (unless it was simply, of course, an actual filmed stage  production). On the other hand, Madonna and Banderas are not nearly strong  and polished enough for a stage. Most of the changes (a few I don't  understand), make a lot of sense, when you consider how a movie has to  flow.As for this movie not being deep or historical, its a musical for  Pete's sake, not &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; I don't know enough about  Eva Peron to really say, but I don't see how you could present a real  historical drama in a musical context. I think the problem is people don't  like or understand opera, which this essentially is. Most of the great  operas have ludicrous story lines! Also if you are going to go in knowing  you &quot;hate&quot; musicals, &quot;hate&quot; Madonna, then fine, this is  not to your taste. Banderas is not a polished singer, but his rough edged  singing is very appealing and effective in this context.The  cinematography, costumes are outstanding, and serve the story well. Only as  the dying Evita, do I find Madonna not very believable. I think Evita is  thrilling, its one of my favorite movies of recent years.I love the show  Evita, and I love this too, but in a very different way.",4,EXCELLENT Adaption of the broadway show - have an open mind.,949017600,"01 28, 2000",2000,2260,"['Boy', 'do', 'people', 'miss', 'point', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'present', 'movie', 'broadway', 'show', 'Everytime', 'been', 'attemped', 'historically', 'results', 'are', 'bad', 'most', 'adaptions', 'famous', 'shows', 'are', 'only', 'OK', 'best', 'are', 'awful', 'medium', 'totally', 'different', 'demands', 'are', 'different', 'singing', 'different', 'acting', 'style', 'different', 'Yes', 'shows', 'usually', 'are', 'quot', 'better', 'quot', 'sense', 'how', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'stage', 'play', 'have', 'got', 'really', 'change', 'things', 'make', 'successful', 'movie.So', 'how', 'good', 'ADAPTION', 'Very', 'good', 'indeed', 'story', 'was', 'changed', 'very', 'effectively', 'fit', 'medium', 'Madonna', 'stretched', 'unbelievably', 'do', 'role', 'think', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'quite', 'validly', 'prefer', 'stage', 'version', 'Evita', 'almost', 'apples', 'oranges', 'As', 'good', 'Patti', 'Lupone', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'were', 'would', 'played', 'same', 'way', 'anyway', 'come', 'off', 'mannered', 'absurd', 'movie', 'context', 'conventions', 'stage', 'would', 'be', 'laughable', 'was', 'simply', 'course', 'actual', 'filmed', 'stage', 'production', 'other', 'hand', 'Madonna', 'Banderas', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'strong', 'polished', 'enough', 'stage', 'Most', 'changes', 'few', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'movie', 'flow.As', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'deep', 'historical', 'musical', 'Pete', 'sake', 'not', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'really', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'present', 'real', 'historical', 'drama', 'musical', 'context', 'think', 'problem', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'understand', 'opera', 'essentially', 'Most', 'great', 'operas', 'have', 'ludicrous', 'story', 'lines', 'Also', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'knowing', 'quot', 'hate', 'quot', 'musicals', 'quot', 'hate', 'quot', 'Madonna', 'then', 'fine', 'not', 'taste', 'Banderas', 'not', 'polished', 'singer', 'rough', 'edged', 'singing', 'very', 'appealing', 'effective', 'context.The', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'are', 'outstanding', 'serve', 'story', 'well', 'Only', 'dying', 'Evita', 'do', 'find', 'Madonna', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'think', 'Evita', 'thrilling', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'recent', 'years.I', 'show', 'Evita', 'love', 'too', 'very', 'different', 'way']",N/A
426881,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,6304504012,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[3, 5]",Alan Paker's Evita is a big Hollywood musical based on an even bigger Broadway stage hit. It took twenty years and multiple changes of  directors and stars to get to this point. The question that remains is was it all worth it. From my point of view the answer is a definite maybe.Evita tells the watered down story of Eva Peron a woman who wanted it all and seemingly got it all by the time of her death at age 33. Madonna pulls off the role with ease. She blends herself into the role with abandon. It does not matter that she no longer looks like the 15 year old Eva Duarte she is supposed to be playing at the beginning of the film. Her vocals sweep and soar and we actually have a great time watching the Material Girl try to pull off the part of a lifetime.The Greek chorus of the film is the character Che played by Antonio Banderas. Banderas is one of the surprises of the film. His singing is more than adequate and just under the surface there is the cynicism that is necessary to make the part work. The character of Eva had to be watered down for the movie to be shot on location and if you watch just closely enough Banderas brings some of Eva's questionable character back.Alan Parker acquits himself well as director. The film moves along swiftly and looks great. Watch the crowd scenes during Peron's rise to power and the stirring cinematography that accompanies &quot;A New Argentina&quot; to see what I mean. If there is a problem here it is that at some points the film looks rather like a long form music video than an actaul feature film.My only real problem with this disc is that there are no extras at all. Not even the theatrical trailer is presented. Hollywood pictures did a fine job with the transfer but give the buyer a little more for his money.Watch this one with the sound up it is well worth your time.,3,So who is this Santa Evita?,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,1837,"['Alan', 'Paker', 'Evita', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'musical', 'based', 'even', 'bigger', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'hit', 'took', 'twenty', 'years', 'multiple', 'changes', 'directors', 'stars', 'get', 'point', 'question', 'was', 'point', 'view', 'answer', 'definite', 'maybe.Evita', 'watered', 'down', 'story', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'woman', 'who', 'wanted', 'seemingly', 'got', 'time', 'death', 'age', '33', 'Madonna', 'role', 'ease', 'role', 'abandon', 'not', 'matter', 'no', 'longer', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Eva', 'Duarte', 'supposed', 'be', 'playing', 'beginning', 'film', 'vocals', 'sweep', 'soar', 'actually', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'Material', 'Girl', 'try', 'pull', 'off', 'part', 'lifetime.The', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'film', 'character', 'Che', 'played', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Banderas', 'one', 'surprises', 'film', 'singing', 'more', 'adequate', 'just', 'surface', 'cynicism', 'necessary', 'make', 'part', 'work', 'character', 'Eva', 'had', 'be', 'watered', 'down', 'movie', 'be', 'shot', 'location', 'watch', 'just', 'closely', 'enough', 'Banderas', 'Eva', 'questionable', 'character', 'back.Alan', 'Parker', 'well', 'director', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'swiftly', 'great', 'Watch', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'Peron', 'rise', 'power', 'stirring', 'cinematography', 'quot', 'New', 'Argentina', 'quot', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'problem', 'here', 'points', 'film', 'rather', 'long', 'form', 'music', 'video', 'actaul', 'feature', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'disc', 'are', 'extras', 'Not', 'even', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'presented', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'transfer', 'give', 'buyer', 'little', 'more', 'money.Watch', 'one', 'sound', 'well', 'time']",N/A

B Collins Jr.,"[13, 14]","This masterpiece of film-making needs re-evaluation since in hindsight it can be seen for the superb and masterful work of art and entertainment that it is. I have now seen the film three times and each time I am amazed that this film has not been recognized widely for its considerable attributes.How does a director convey the oppressive nature of Fascism in a musical? Alan Parker succeeds wonderfully through his use of a muted brown, beige, black, and vanilla color range. He does it through the wonderful photography of riots, poverty, wealth, militarism, and the signs and symbols of power. The cinematography in this film is great. The art direction is super. The editing is perfect. It is a mystery to me why this film wasn't more appreciated by the public.I think one reason is that folks don't know history and understand the rise of fascism in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Argentina in the 1930s and 1940s. Peron's brand of fascism was threatening to the oligarchy in Argentina that had ruled a nation of farmers and cowboys and peasants. Thus there is no clear picture of good guys and bad guys in the film. At times Eva's appeals to the poor and underserved, the establishment of her foundation, and her ability to communicate with the masses puts her in the role of saint. However, the extortion of the rich to pay for her charities and thus maintain the popularity of Peron is a shrewed political power play.Madonna is super in this film. Her acting is not naturalistic because she is playing an over-the-top diva and saint. It is Antonio Banderas who gives us a running commentary thorughout the film that continually grounds the viewer in the facts and the actions in this opera.One last comment: there are very few songs that have the power of Webber and Rice's Don't Cry for Me Argentina. Madonna's performance is spotless when she sings this from her balcony to the crowd below.",5,Banderas and Madonna are in top form in this great film.,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,1897,"['masterpiece', 'film-making', 'needs', 're-evaluation', 'hindsight', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'superb', 'masterful', 'work', 'art', 'entertainment', 'have', 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'time', 'am', 'amazed', 'film', 'not', 'been', 'recognized', 'widely', 'considerable', 'attributes.How', 'director', 'convey', 'oppressive', 'nature', 'Fascism', 'musical', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'wonderfully', 'use', 'muted', 'brown', 'beige', 'black', 'vanilla', 'color', 'range', 'wonderful', 'photography', 'riots', 'poverty', 'wealth', 'militarism', 'signs', 'symbols', 'power', 'cinematography', 'film', 'great', 'art', 'direction', 'super', 'editing', 'perfect', 'mystery', 'why', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'appreciated', 'public.I', 'think', 'one', 'reason', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'history', 'understand', 'rise', 'fascism', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Argentina', '1930s', '1940s', 'Peron', 'brand', 'fascism', 'was', 'threatening', 'oligarchy', 'Argentina', 'had', 'ruled', 'nation', 'farmers', 'cowboys', 'peasants', 'Thus', 'clear', 'picture', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'film', 'times', 'Eva', 'appeals', 'poor', 'underserved', 'establishment', 'foundation', 'ability', 'communicate', 'masses', 'role', 'saint', 'However', 'extortion', 'rich', 'pay', 'charities', 'thus', 'maintain', 'popularity', 'Peron', 'shrewed', 'political', 'power', 'play.Madonna', 'super', 'film', 'acting', 'not', 'naturalistic', 'playing', 'over-the-top', 'diva', 'saint', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'who', 'running', 'commentary', 'film', 'continually', 'viewer', 'facts', 'actions', 'opera.One', 'last', 'comment', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'songs', 'have', 'power', 'Webber', 'Rice', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Me', 'Argentina', 'Madonna', 'performance', 'spotless', 'when', 'balcony', 'crowd']",N/A

But I must say: If this film irked you, you should've seen the stage show, which was even more brittle and astringent with its completely *unsympathetic* portrayal of Sra. Peron. One masterstroke is that the film sets out to give Eva more sympathy than the play did (never mind that she ultimately remained an enigma; that was the case of the actual woman also). But the film makes some important alterations throughout the story. In the stage show Eva uses, then throws over, Magaldi. This is reversed in the film, with Magaldi leaving her at his door (making her a kind of spurned victim) which ultimately leads to the spotlight torch song ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall"" (sung on stage, by the way, by a background character). Later, when she sings ""You Must Love Me,"" she is further softening the Evita character. (The lyrics illustrate the couple's marriage of convenience and how now that they're coming to the end, maybe there's love in their union after all.) But many scenes- several of Madonna's songs, *all* of Banderas's - are quite impressive. And the scene on the balcony (the ""Casa Rosada""), is worth the price of the DVD, just to hear the chant of ""Peron! Peron!"" change over to ""Evii-ta!

Adapted from famed Broadway producer Andrew Lloyd Weber's long-running stage play about Evita Peron, the charismatic late first lady of Argentina, the movie treatment attracted much casting speculation and critics wrote with some wariness at the decision to cast Madonna. But she portrays the enigmatic Evita with a magnatism that projects from the screen, and Madonna shines in conveying the emotional distance that the real-life lady apparently projected. Madonna handily earned the Golden Globe best actress award she won but was passed over, perhaps unfairly, at Oscar time. As compelling as Madonna is, though, she is nearly upstaged by Antonia Banderas in a surprisingly masterful singing role. As the narrator commenting on behalf of Argentina's devastated working class in the early 1950's, Banderas is simply astonishing. You don't have to be a Madonna or Banderas fan to appreciate this film their vocal interpretations of the songs in it, highlighted by the stirringly emotional Oscar-winner, ""You Must Love Me.""

426889,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,6304504012,David Bower,"[4, 5]","One would not usually think of a movie musical as being troubling and difficult to watch, but this one was exactly that for me.The movie Evita affected me at two distinct levels, one as the hit musical, and two as a commentary on life and politics; first the easy one, Evita as a hit musical.The music of Andrew Lloyd Webber provides the foundation for this work; his music is so distinctive that it immediately identifies the work as his. Webber's music is powerful and intense; the pace hardly ever slackens as the story unfolds about this young woman who was born in very humble surroundings but is driven to make something of herself.The title role is played by Madonna who turns in a powerful performance of this driven woman. Using every means at her disposal the Evita character pushes herself into a place of influence in Argentina.Fans of either Madonna or Andrew Lloyd Webber will find this a treasure trove of musical gems; Madonna was a good choice in the role as her appearance and bearing seem to support the Evita character being portrayed.The second level is more involved and troubling; we see two people, Juan and Eva, who desire power using demagoguery to effectively influence political events. What is even more troubling is the ease with which large groups of people were emotionally swayed to support these desires; we see the weaknesses of the democratic process being exploited to establish control.Peron's partnership with Eva produced a potent force which finally placed them in the top positions of power in Argentina. Their demagoguery kept them there longer than might have been expected. Their policy of promising everything to everybody but actually benefitting only a chosen few was clever enough to deceive enough of the people to maintain their positions of leadership.All of this is history, but the disturbing thing is the parallels one sees today in the United States. These parallels made the movie troubling and difficult for me to watch. It may be as Hegel is quoted saying: ""What experience and history teach is this--that people and governments never have learned anything from history, or acted on principles deduced from it.""",3,Disturbing Display of Demagoguery,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,2170,"['One', 'would', 'not', 'usually', 'think', 'movie', 'musical', 'being', 'troubling', 'difficult', 'watch', 'one', 'was', 'exactly', 'me.The', 'movie', 'Evita', 'affected', 'two', 'distinct', 'levels', 'one', 'hit', 'musical', 'two', 'commentary', 'life', 'politics', 'first', 'easy', 'one', 'Evita', 'hit', 'musical.The', 'music', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'foundation', 'work', 'music', 'so', 'distinctive', 'immediately', 'work', 'Webber', 'music', 'powerful', 'intense', 'pace', 'hardly', 'ever', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'very', 'humble', 'surroundings', 'driven', 'make', 'something', 'herself.The', 'title', 'role', 'played', 'Madonna', 'who', 'powerful', 'performance', 'driven', 'woman', 'Using', 'means', 'disposal', 'Evita', 'character', 'place', 'influence', 'Argentina.Fans', 'Madonna', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'will', 'find', 'treasure', 'trove', 'musical', 'gems', 'Madonna', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'role', 'appearance', 'bearing', 'seem', 'support', 'Evita', 'character', 'being', 'portrayed.The', 'second', 'level', 'more', 'involved', 'troubling', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'Juan', 'Eva', 'who', 'desire', 'power', 'using', 'demagoguery', 'effectively', 'influence', 'political', 'events', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'troubling', 'ease', 'large', 'groups', 'people', 'were', 'emotionally', 'swayed', 'support', 'desires', 'see', 'weaknesses', 'democratic', 'process', 'being', 'exploited', 'establish', 'control.Peron', 'partnership', 'Eva', 'produced', 'potent', 'force', 'finally', 'placed', 'top', 'positions', 'power', 'Argentina', 'demagoguery', 'kept', 'there', 'longer', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'policy', 'promising', 'everything', 'everybody', 'actually', 'benefitting', 'only', 'chosen', 'few', 'was', 'clever', 'enough', 'deceive', 'enough', 'people', 'maintain', 'positions', 'leadership.All', 'history', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'parallels', 'one', 'sees', 'today', 'United', 'States', 'parallels', 'made', 'movie', 'troubling', 'difficult', 'watch', 'may', 'be', 'Hegel', 'quoted', 'saying', 'What', 'experience', 'history', 'teach', 'people', 'governments', 'never', 'have', 'learned', 'anything', 'history', 'acted', 'principles', 'deduced']",N/A

Evita opens gorgeous and glowing. And guess what? Madonna has to carry the picture. Can she act? Well, she  can sing and act at the same time, and that's good enough for me.  What keeps this salsa-tinged soap-opera afloat is an ingenious device that  comes in the form of Che (Antonio Banderas), a South American everyman:  he's a waiter; he's a reporter; he's a revolutionary. He provides the story  with a conscience. And let me tell you, this story needs one. Eva and Juan  Peron (Jonathan Pryce), you see, captivated a country desperate for  stability in the late forties. Argentina under their leadership was, in the  end, arguably better off but definitely better looking.That attention  to style also seems to be the aim of director Alan Parker. His eye for the  visually operatic is flawless here. Whether she is handing out ill-gotten  money to the poor, or standing on a balcony tearfully protesting her  worthiness, Evita (and Madonna for that matter) is one of the best at  stroking and stoking the emotions of her people.

426894,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6304504012,Deborah Earle,"[6, 7]","Madonna was well-chosen for the title role of this musical. She is a promiscuous bottle blonde who lost a parent when young, just like the illustrious former First Lady of Argentina.Eva Peron was a woman who lived fast, died young, left behind a good-looking corpse, and a smashing wardrobe. This film emphasizes at least two of those aspects of Evita's life. Jonathan Pryce bears little resemblance to the real Juan Peron, but he can carry a tune. He never appears to be the menacing dictator that Peron was known to have been, but when he confronts his teenage mistress(sympathetically played by Andrea Corr), or Eva's terminal illness, he comes across as a sheepish little boy who was caught with his hand in the cookie jar.Victoria Sus captures the streetwise persona that must have been Juana Ibarguren. While the contempt that the widow of Eva's father must have had for her and her five children is understandable, it should be remembered that Eva's mother did what she had to do to survive at a time when women had fewer options. If there is anything to be said for Eva's contraversial rise to power, she did give Argentinian women the vote, which would help to lessen the chances of their having to prostitute themselves in order to survive as she and her mother did.Antonio Banderas wears many different hats as fellow Argentinian, Che Guevara, who in fact, never met Eva Peron. His subtle tone is quite suitable for rock operas and in fact, it reminds me a little of Ted Neely's singing in &quot;Jesus Christ, Superstar&quot;, another Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. His mannerisms are mocking and unsymapthetic as he mixes in with all elements of Argentine society, trying to get the scoop on this young woman who has taken her country by storm.There is a noticeable change in lyrics where certain numbers are concerned. When the song, &quot;And the Money Kept Rolling In&quot; is played, a very important stanza about the Perons' fleecing of their nation's treasury is left out. I have wondered if the producers of this film had to strike a deal with the Argentinian government to leave that stanza out in order to film in a country where Eva is still so revered. Earlier, Eva's lines in &quot;Peron's Latest Flame&quot; are changed from &quot;Is that the extent of your interest in me? It shows how futile acting must be.&quot; to&quot; Acting is limiting. The lines not mine. That's no help to the Argentine.&quot; But it's great how Lloyd-Webber recreates the two groups most opposed to Eva's rise to power in that song by making the military officers shout their lyrics as military officers would when giving or responding to commands, and the aristocracy sing theirs in a ringing chorale to express their highbrow mannerisms.Jimmy Nail is given the other standout performance as Eva's first lover, Agustin Magaldi. He has a pleasant voice, but somehow an audience would get the impression that he wasn't all that great a singer. Julian Littman does bear a close resemblance to Eva's devoted brother, Juan.The most comically pathetic character is, perhaps Marcelo Alejandro Marcelli's beautiful-eyed Huevo, the photographer who helps Eva land her first gig as a professional model, only to find himself being spurned by her as she goes on to more advantageous conquests.The film doesn't capture everything accurately. But it's quite a musical. At once, it is solemn, majestic, passionate, riveting, rollicking, funny,and dignified. It never lets up for a moment as it captures the fire, color and spirit of both its title character and of her beloved Argentina in the early part of the 20th century.",5,"Live Fast, Die Young, Leave Behind a Good-Looking Corpse",1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,3613,"['Madonna', 'was', 'well-chosen', 'title', 'role', 'musical', 'promiscuous', 'bottle', 'blonde', 'who', 'lost', 'parent', 'when', 'young', 'just', 'illustrious', 'former', 'First', 'Lady', 'Argentina.Eva', 'Peron', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'fast', 'died', 'young', 'left', 'behind', 'good-looking', 'corpse', 'smashing', 'wardrobe', 'film', 'least', 'two', 'aspects', 'Evita', 'life', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'little', 'resemblance', 'real', 'Juan', 'Peron', 'can', 'carry', 'tune', 'never', 'be', 'menacing', 'dictator', 'Peron', 'was', 'known', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'teenage', 'mistress', 'sympathetically', 'played', 'Andrea', 'Corr', 'Eva', 'terminal', 'illness', 'across', 'sheepish', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'caught', 'hand', 'cookie', 'jar.Victoria', 'Sus', 'streetwise', 'persona', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Juana', 'Ibarguren', 'contempt', 'widow', 'Eva', 'father', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'five', 'children', 'understandable', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'Eva', 'mother', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'survive', 'time', 'when', 'women', 'had', 'fewer', 'options', 'anything', 'be', 'said', 'Eva', 'contraversial', 'rise', 'power', 'did', 'give', 'Argentinian', 'women', 'vote', 'would', 'help', 'lessen', 'chances', 'having', 'prostitute', 'order', 'survive', 'mother', 'did.Antonio', 'Banderas', 'many', 'different', 'hats', 'fellow', 'Argentinian', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'who', 'fact', 'never', 'met', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'subtle', 'tone', 'quite', 'suitable', 'rock', 'operas', 'fact', 'little', 'Ted', 'Neely', 'singing', 'quot', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'quot', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'musical', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'mocking', 'unsymapthetic', 'elements', 'Argentine', 'society', 'trying', 'get', 'scoop', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'taken', 'country', 'storm.There', 'noticeable', 'change', 'lyrics', 'where', 'certain', 'numbers', 'are', 'concerned', 'When', 'song', 'quot', 'Money', 'Kept', 'Rolling', 'quot', 'played', 'very', 'important', 'stanza', 'Perons', 'fleecing', 'nation', 'treasury', 'left', 'out', 'have', 'wondered', 'producers', 'film', 'had', 'strike', 'deal', 'Argentinian', 'government', 'leave', 'stanza', 'out', 'order', 'film', 'country', 'where', 'Eva', 'still', 'so', 'revered', 'Earlier', 'Eva', 'lines', 'quot', 'Peron', 'Latest', 'Flame', 'quot', 'are', 'changed', 'quot', 'extent', 'interest', 'how', 'futile', 'acting', 'must', 'be.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Acting', 'limiting', 'lines', 'not', 'mine', 'help', 'Argentine.', 'quot', 'great', 'how', 'Lloyd-Webber', 'two', 'groups', 'most', 'opposed', 'Eva', 'rise', 'power', 'song', 'making', 'military', 'officers', 'shout', 'lyrics', 'military', 'officers', 'would', 'when', 'giving', 'responding', 'commands', 'aristocracy', 'sing', 'theirs', 'ringing', 'chorale', 'express', 'highbrow', 'mannerisms.Jimmy', 'Nail', 'given', 'other', 'standout', 'performance', 'Eva', 'first', 'lover', 'Agustin', 'Magaldi', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'somehow', 'audience', 'would', 'get', 'impression', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'singer', 'Julian', 'Littman', 'bear', 'close', 'resemblance', 'Eva', 'devoted', 'brother', 'Juan.The', 'most', 'comically', 'pathetic', 'character', 'perhaps', 'Marcelo', 'Alejandro', 'Marcelli', 'beautiful-eyed', 'Huevo', 'photographer', 'who', 'Eva', 'land', 'first', 'gig', 'professional', 'model', 'only', 'find', 'being', 'spurned', 'more', 'advantageous', 'conquests.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'capture', 'everything', 'accurately', 'quite', 'musical', 'once', 'solemn', 'majestic', 'passionate', 'riveting', 'rollicking', 'funny', 'dignified', 'never', 'up', 'moment', 'fire', 'color', 'spirit', 'title', 'character', 'beloved', 'Argentina', 'early', 'part', '20th', 'century']",N/A
426895,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6304504012,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 5]","On July 26, 1952, a 33-year-old woman named Maria Eva Durarte de Peron would become part of international pop culture.  On that very day, the second wife of Argentina President Juan Peron and the First Lady of Argentina would pass away due to cancer.  And her memory continues to live on today!Eva ""Evita"" Peron, her story has captured the attention of people worldwide.  Growing up poor, leaving her family at the age of 15 from a rural village to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires, hoping to pursue a career as an actress and at the age of 25, meeting then-Colonel Juan Peron at a charity event for earthquake victims, the two would marry a year later.And Juan Peron would become President of Argentina, but as the First Lady, Eva would become powerful within the trad unions, speaking on behalf of labor rights, running the Ministries of Labor and Health, running her own charity and showing that a woman can be come a true leader.  She was championed by the low-income and working class of Argentina and despite her ailing health, she continued to remain strong despite being opposed by Argentina's military and the upperclass.So, popular Evita was in international pop culture, a 1981 telefilm titled ""The Woman with the Whip"" starring Faye Dunaway was created.  And also a successful musical production titled ""Evita"" by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber would once again pay tribute to Eva Peron.  So, successful that the musical generated over $2 billion in revenue back in 1980.But since 1978, there was always hope to bring ""Evita"" to the big screen and after a 20-year production delay, in 1996, director and co-writer Alan Parker (""Angela's Ashes"", ""Mississippi Burning"", ""Angel Heart"") and co-writer Oliver Stone (""Platoon"", ""JFK"", ""National Born Killers"") were able to take Evita to the big screen thanks to the casting of Madonna (""Body of Evidence"", ""A League of their Own"", ""Dick Tracy""), Antonio Banderas (""Desperado"", ""The Mask of Zorro"", ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"") and Jonathan Pryce (""Brazil"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films).""Evita"" is a musical narrated by Che (as portrayed by Antonio Banderas), who tells the story of Eva Duarte (as portrayed by Madonna) from a child of a poor family, leaving her home to become an actress in Buenos Aires, where she would have an affair with Agustin Magaldi (as portrayed by Jimmy Nail) but eventually, through an earthquake benefit, meeting Colonel Juan Peron (as portrayed by Jonathan Pryce) and a year later, marrying him.The musical would show audiences the rise and power of Juan Peron as he becomes Argentina's President and how the First Lady of Argentina together, would create a new government that would serve the poor.But through her hard work, Che narrates her sickness and leading to her death.VIDEO:""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1).  When I first watched this film years ago, I noticed how this film looked so beautiful, so grand because of the many people that were featured.  The eloquence of showcasing Eva Peron throughout her life but also amongst the political chaos to the thousands of people who supported her and of course, her husband.  But the cinematography of Darius Khondji (""Se7en"", ""Midnight in Paris"", ""Alien: Resurrection"") is beautiful.Compared to the original DVD release, the film features much more clarity, much more detail but it is a film that utilizes a lot of earth tones, so colors are warmer than vibrant.  The video is definitely an upgrade from the original DVD and fans of the film will definitely want to upgrade for the improve picture quality.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The film is a musical and with a musical, you expect it to sound incredible via lossless. And as expected, the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber sounds incredible in HD.  While primarily a dialogue and music-driven film through the front channels, I didn't notice the surround channels being used as much but towards the end of the film, I did notice a bit of LFE.Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:The Making of Evita - (42:13)  A documentary featuring behind-the-scenes making of the film, interviews with the cast, director and knowings the challenges that existed in bringing this musical to the big screen but also the challenges that Madonna and talents had to face as well.  As well as the importance of location, look and costume design.  Very informative feature.Music Video - (3:16) Featuring Madonna's ""You Must Love Me"".Teaser Trailer - (1:54) A teaser trailer for ""Evita"".JUDGMENT CALL:Whenever I hear the song ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"", I think of Madonna singing this song on the balcony, as her character of Eva Peron, knowing that her final days are coming and just wanting to say one last goodbye to the people who have supported her.""Evita"" is a musical that I enjoyed for its ambition and cinematography.  To shoot in Argentina, to include so many extras to make the political rallying and the funeral of Evita seem real, this was accomplished remarkably well in the film.Madonna does a fantastic job in playing the main character role of Evita.  From the look and the emotion, Madonna was able to bring sexiness but also an emotional demeanor to her character with efficacy.  And of course, hearing her sing, I absolutely enjoyed her songs.But not everyone's songs.Antonio Banderas was fine as the narrator, Che, who in the movie, was close to the Peron's, and as much as I enjoyed Antonio Banderas in ""Desperado"" (and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"") and the ""Zorro"" films, he is more of an action star in my book.  Not as a singer.  And as much as Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice really tried to bring out the machismo of Banderas through music, I wasn't so much of a fan of Banderas' singing vocals for the film then and the same now.And while Jonathan Pryce is a fine actor, I just didn't feel the chemistry was right between Pryce and Madonna.  So perhaps, the casting never set well with me to begin with.  And watching this film again in 2012, I still feel the same way.As for the Blu-ray release, while the special features are the same as the DVD release, this film is primarily for the fans who want to watch this film in HD and enjoy the better transfer of this film and hear the music in lossless.Overall, ""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" is a film that I will forever remember as possibly Madonna's greatest performance in a film.  She embodied and gracefully portrayed the role of Eva Peron with success and because of her involvement, I enjoyed this musical much more.  The cinematography for this film by Darius Khondji is absolutely beautiful and Alan Parker did a great job directing this film, it's just the casting that I felt was off.  But still, I did enjoy this film a lot.""Evita"" is a fine musical that really showcases the life of Eva Peron in a positive way and it helps to have a film, especially a talent such as Madonna playing the role and doing a great job in her performance.  And while I may not feel the same way about the vocal performance by Banderas and by Pryce (although I enjoyed Pryce a lot more than Banderas), both did a great job with their character role as well.""Evita: 15th Anniversary Edition"" may not be the greatest musical on film, but it is a memorable film with beautiful music, beautiful cinematography and a wonderful performance by Madonna.

426896,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6304504012,Dennis Littrell,"[62, 76]","One of the interesting sidelights to this movie is the fact that Oliver Stone wrote part of the screenplay.  While watching it I kept wondering what part?  Stone, whose edgy, over the top indictments of oppression, corruption and especially military stupidity, wouldn't seem to be one to celebrate the elevation of Eva Peron to something close to sainthood, which is what this movie does.  Maybe all his work ended up on the cutting room floor.  Or maybe it was obscured by Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.  Certainly we do not see the decamisados (Peron's version of his friend Mussolini's Blackshirts) torturing anyone, and although the ""disappeared"" are mentioned in passing, there is no retrospective that allows us to see just how widespread and horrific were the murders committed by the Peronists.Anyway, Madonna, who certainly fits the part like a glove, stars as Evita, and she gives the performance of her life.  Yet somehow it is unconvincing, or I should say, somehow the film doesn't really get to the essence of the woman who rose from poverty to the pinnacle of power in Argentina, a woman extravagantly loved by the common people of Argentina even while she was a party to the fascist oppression.  I don't think this is Madonna's fault. Her voice is good, not great, of course, but her dramatic skills are very much in evidence, skills that have always been underrated, although I'm not sure why. If you watch her in this and in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) you can see that she has a range easily exceeding that of most actresses.  I think that ironically it is the very quality of common origin and common appeal that the Argentines so loved in Evita that the critics hold against Madonna.Antonio Banderas plays Che, who narrates and attempts to objectify the events while symbolizing both Evita's alter-ego and the man who would really be her proper mate were it not for her rapacious political appetite.  Che's character and his dramatic role (from the play by Tim Rice) is perhaps the most important artistic achievement of the musical after Webber's beautiful and inspiring music.  Banderas is winning and enormously vivid in the part, and he sings well and expressively.Jonathan Pryce plays Peron with more dignity and humanity than history might allow.  His sensitivity as an actor combined with a modest demeanor seemed to me so unrealistic as to be almost a miscasting.  Yet he is perhaps as compelling as anyone on the screen and he certainly looked the part.  Interesting is Jimmy Nail as the cabaret singer Magaldi.  He combines sleazy good looks with a kind of vulnerable persona that seems exactly right.Well, what can be said about the music except that it is one of Webber's great triumphs and so very typical of his work.  It is beautiful, stirring, moving, enchanting and memorable.  Who can forget the haunting, plaintive refrain of ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" or the gorgeous simplicity of ""You Must Love Me""?  While Madonna's voice would not fill up a concert hall or take her by itself to the Broadway stage, she does an outstanding job with Webber's songs.  A natural performer (Madonna's key talent), her expressive interpretations range from the ordinary to the transfixing.  I very much enjoyed her efforts and predict that critics in the future will be kinder to her than today's critics.The ending seemed too drawn out and then when the screen faded to black and the credits began to run it seemed almost abrupt and without resolution.  I also did not like the way that Madonna (38 at the time) seemed no younger in the earlier scenes with her hair dyed pitch black.  I think director Alan Parker should have given us more of an illusion of youth, perhaps spared her some of the closeups and fuzzed out the lines under her eyes. Strange how the golden blonde hair and exquisitely applied makeup in the remainder of the film made her look younger.  All directors should know what Madonna learned many years ago: blonde hair usually makes a woman look younger because those with naturally light-colored hair are their blondest as children.  Like big eyes and relatively big heads, blonde hair is a signal of youth that arrests our eyes.Despite the flaws this is an engrossing cinematic experience, and for Madonna fans, Banderas fans, and in particular fans of Andrew Lloyd Webber, it is a film not to be missed.",4,Wonderful to watch but unfulfilling,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,4357,"['One', 'interesting', 'sidelights', 'movie', 'fact', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'wrote', 'part', 'screenplay', 'watching', 'kept', 'wondering', 'what', 'part', 'Stone', 'edgy', 'top', 'indictments', 'oppression', 'corruption', 'especially', 'military', 'stupidity', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'one', 'celebrate', 'elevation', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'something', 'close', 'sainthood', 'what', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'work', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'maybe', 'was', 'obscured', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'music', 'Certainly', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'decamisados', 'Peron', 'version', 'friend', 'Mussolini', 'Blackshirts', 'torturing', 'anyone', 'disappeared', 'are', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'retrospective', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'widespread', 'horrific', 'were', 'murders', 'committed', 'Peronists.Anyway', 'Madonna', 'who', 'certainly', 'part', 'glove', 'Evita', 'performance', 'life', 'somehow', 'unconvincing', 'should', 'say', 'somehow', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'essence', 'woman', 'who', 'rose', 'poverty', 'pinnacle', 'power', 'Argentina', 'woman', 'extravagantly', 'loved', 'common', 'people', 'Argentina', 'even', 'was', 'party', 'fascist', 'oppression', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Madonna', 'fault', 'voice', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'course', 'dramatic', 'skills', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'evidence', 'skills', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'underrated', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'watch', 'Desperately', 'Seeking', 'Susan', '1985', 'can', 'see', 'range', 'easily', 'exceeding', 'most', 'actresses', 'think', 'ironically', 'very', 'quality', 'common', 'origin', 'common', 'appeal', 'Argentines', 'so', 'loved', 'Evita', 'critics', 'hold', 'Madonna.Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Che', 'who', 'attempts', 'objectify', 'events', 'symbolizing', 'Evita', 'alter-ego', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'proper', 'mate', 'were', 'not', 'rapacious', 'political', 'appetite', 'Che', 'character', 'dramatic', 'role', 'play', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'musical', 'Webber', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'music', 'Banderas', 'winning', 'enormously', 'vivid', 'part', 'well', 'expressively.Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Peron', 'more', 'dignity', 'humanity', 'history', 'might', 'allow', 'sensitivity', 'actor', 'combined', 'modest', 'demeanor', 'seemed', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'be', 'almost', 'miscasting', 'perhaps', 'as', 'compelling', 'anyone', 'screen', 'certainly', 'looked', 'part', 'Interesting', 'Jimmy', 'Nail', 'cabaret', 'singer', 'Magaldi', 'sleazy', 'good', 'looks', 'kind', 'vulnerable', 'persona', 'exactly', 'right.Well', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'music', 'one', 'Webber', 'great', 'triumphs', 'so', 'very', 'typical', 'work', 'beautiful', 'stirring', 'moving', 'enchanting', 'memorable', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'haunting', 'plaintive', 'refrain', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Me', 'Argentina', 'gorgeous', 'simplicity', 'Must', 'Love', 'Me', 'Madonna', 'voice', 'would', 'not', 'fill', 'up', 'concert', 'hall', 'take', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'outstanding', 'job', 'Webber', 'songs', 'natural', 'performer', 'Madonna', 'key', 'talent', 'expressive', 'interpretations', 'range', 'ordinary', 'transfixing', 'very', 'much', 'efforts', 'predict', 'critics', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'kinder', 'today', 'critics.The', 'ending', 'seemed', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'then', 'when', 'screen', 'faded', 'black', 'credits', 'began', 'run', 'seemed', 'almost', 'abrupt', 'resolution', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'way', 'Madonna', '38', 'time', 'seemed', 'younger', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'hair', 'dyed', 'pitch', 'black', 'think', 'director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'illusion', 'youth', 'perhaps', 'spared', 'closeups', 'fuzzed', 'out', 'lines', 'eyes', 'Strange', 'how', 'golden', 'blonde', 'hair', 'exquisitely', 'applied', 'makeup', 'remainder', 'film', 'made', 'look', 'younger', 'directors', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'Madonna', 'learned', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'blonde', 'hair', 'usually', 'woman', 'look', 'younger', 'naturally', 'light-colored', 'hair', 'are', 'blondest', 'children', 'big', 'eyes', 'relatively', 'big', 'heads', 'blonde', 'hair', 'signal', 'youth', 'eyes.Despite', 'flaws', 'engrossing', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Madonna', 'fans', 'Banderas', 'fans', 'particular', 'fans', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

Madonna-bashing was a popular sport, especially for her acting performances. There is nothing wrong with her performance here, either as an actress or singer (even though she can be seen breathing when she is supposed to be lying dead in her coffin). The real revelation, though is Jonathan Pryce. We all knew he could act from films like Brazil and Breaking Glass, but here he shows he is also quite a good singer. It's clear that he did all his own songs himself, and some of the charisma he injects into the role of Peron rubs off on his singing performance. This is also true of Madonna, who singing isn't up to Judy Covington's original, but she just seems so right for the role, especially when the excellent period make-up and clothes are added. Jimmy Nail has fun as Magaldi, and Banderas (probably hiding from Madonna after her comments in In Bed With Madonna!) works well as the modified Che, no longer representing Che Guevara but now a metaphor for the Argentinean workers.Parker manages some amazing feats, securing the use of the genuine Casa Rosada to film the balcony scenes, as well as the services of hundreds of Argentineans to play the grieving public. These give the director impressive distance shots to balance his subtle close-ups, reflecting the huge impact that this very personal story made on one country. Parker sticks to the original narrative of the musical without additional dialogue, retaining Rice and Lloyd-Webber's spirit. The sound quality is spectacular, the THX or surround giving us the full dynamic range of the orchestra. The additional song 'You Must Love Me' shows that Rice and Lloyd-Webber haven't lost their touch, and Madonna's idea of transferring 'Another Suitcase In Another Hall' to her character is spot on.",5,Alan Parker captures the spirit &amp; quality of the stage show,1007596800,"12 6, 2001",2001,1823,"['Many', 'watched', 'film', 'see', 'lead', 'actress', 'would', 'fail', 'Madonna-bashing', 'was', 'popular', 'sport', 'especially', 'acting', 'performances', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'performance', 'here', 'either', 'actress', 'singer', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'breathing', 'when', 'supposed', 'be', 'lying', 'dead', 'coffin', 'real', 'revelation', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'knew', 'could', 'act', 'films', 'Brazil', 'Breaking', 'Glass', 'here', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'singer', 'clear', 'did', 'all', 'own', 'songs', 'charisma', 'role', 'Peron', 'rubs', 'off', 'singing', 'performance', 'also', 'true', 'Madonna', 'who', 'singing', ""n't"", 'up', 'Judy', 'Covington', 'original', 'just', 'so', 'right', 'role', 'especially', 'when', 'excellent', 'period', 'make-up', 'clothes', 'are', 'added', 'Jimmy', 'Nail', 'fun', 'Magaldi', 'Banderas', 'probably', 'hiding', 'Madonna', 'comments', 'Bed', 'Madonna', 'well', 'modified', 'Che', 'no', 'longer', 'representing', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'now', 'metaphor', 'Argentinean', 'workers.Parker', 'amazing', 'feats', 'securing', 'use', 'genuine', 'Casa', 'Rosada', 'film', 'balcony', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'services', 'hundreds', 'Argentineans', 'play', 'grieving', 'public', 'give', 'director', 'impressive', 'distance', 'shots', 'balance', 'subtle', 'close-ups', 'reflecting', 'huge', 'impact', 'very', 'personal', 'story', 'made', 'one', 'country', 'Parker', 'original', 'narrative', 'musical', 'additional', 'dialogue', 'retaining', 'Rice', 'Lloyd-Webber', 'spirit', 'sound', 'quality', 'spectacular', 'THX', 'surround', 'giving', 'full', 'dynamic', 'range', 'orchestra', 'additional', 'song', 'Must', 'Love', 'Me', 'shows', 'Rice', 'Lloyd-Webber', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'touch', 'Madonna', 'idea', 'transferring', 'Suitcase', 'Hall', 'character', 'spot']",N/A

426905,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,6304504012,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[14, 17]","The life of Eva Peron is one that has intrigued many throughout the years. Even before Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice decided to write a musical about her brief but amazing life, there were others who had tried to revive her legend. There was a short lived off-broadway play called ""The Diamond Orchid"" which was loosely based on her life, a soft-core European movie titled ""Little Mother"" released in the early 70's and a short lived French play titled ""Eva Peron by Copi"" which had the role of Evita played by a Transvestite. But it wasn't until the release of a double album in 1976 by Lloyd Webber and Rice that made Evita famous once again. 20 years later, after many false go-aheads, the film version was finally released.The musical traces the brief but meteoric rise of Maria Eva Duarte de Peron. Her sudden rise from childhood poverty to becoming one of the world's most powerful woman, made her a hero to some, a power hungry villain to others. The movie, like the woman, was controversial. Even after the movie was over many were still left with the questions, was she a Saint or a Sinner? Good or Bad? Was she the Savior to Argentina's ""shirtless"" ones or a Monstrous dictator to the well-to-do? People will just have to come up with their own conclusions but having studied the subject for over 12 years now, I must state that you should not take a Broadway/Hollywood musical as a history lesson. Especially when the subject matter is someone who's as complicated as Eva Peron. Both Peronists and Anti-Peronists agree- the woman was an enigma, a paradox. We may never know the whole truth. However the facts should be noted. Her foundation built over 1000 schools (according to historians although the totals vary), over 100 hospitals, thousands of homes for the poor, several orphanages, old age homes, shelters for runaway girls, shelters for unwed mother, a complete miniature village for children, and youth hostels all between 1948-1952. Health care became free to the poor and the mortality rates among children improved and many diseases such as cholera and TB were reduced. She also sat in her office for 15-20 hours a day receiving the poor up until the last year of her life. She would visit shanty towns and personally give out food, sugar or a bottle of cider. She would pick up homeless people off the streets and take them back, in her limousine, to the residential palace where she would bathe them and feed them. Many have laughed at the idea of Eva Peron being referred to as ""Santa Evita"" (Saint Evita) but the above accomplishments are the reasons as to why so many thought of her as a Saint. And then of course there is the darker aspects of her character which are emphasized in the Black Myth. Her undying loyalty to her husband and his cause, her driving ambition, her alleged ruthlessness, her determination to succeed no matter what the cost. What is the point of these ramblings? Well, her career, her legend is far too complex to explain in a 2 hours musical that is largely based on gossip and supposition.Moving on to the movie and it is beautifully filmed with sumptuous costumes, glorious sets and Lloyd Webber's score is one of his best. Many have complained about the repetitiveness of the music but objectively speaking, you can't really write a rock opera (no spoken dialogue) without recycling some of the tunes and a lot of contemporary theatre composers repeat the main tunes throughout their score. You can't expect Sir. Lloyd Webber to write a new tune for every single sung phrase, let's be realistic. He is not the first and certainly won't be the last contemporary theatre composer to repeats his melodies throughout. Speaking of the music- it ranges from exciting- ""Buenos Aires"", ""Rainbow High"" (my personal favorite) to theatrical-""A New Argentina"", ""Rainbow Tour"", to haunting- ""I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You"", ""Another Suitcase In Another Hall"", ""You Must Love Me"". It is true that the score had to be modified to better suit Madonna's range but in actuality she never sounded better. Madonna's passion for the role is clearly evident in her performance. We saw Eva's passion, power, ambition and pain. We were charmed by her youthful vitality in the first half of the film (despite looking much older than 15), moved by her sincere attempt to win acceptance in the middle and saddened by the pain of her ravaged body in the final frames. The physical resemblance was also striking. However, I must state that Eva Peron at her physical peak (before the cancer destroyed her appearance) had a particularly unique aspect to her beauty. Many have resembled her or at least tried to resemble her but the original woman had characteristics that made her beauty and elegance stand out. Looking at the several picture magazines of the time period and the newsreel footage of her, she was a larger than life persona with an aura of a goddess- the song ""Rainbow High"" is very accurate in its treatment of her elegance during that stage in her life where high maintenance glamour was at the forefront.Being a fan and collector of Eva Peron, I have read and collected several magazines and books- I have over 100 in my collection, and I still find her story fascinating. Although the musical ""Evita"" is biased and one-sided, the stage version of the show captivated me from the opening number to the final scene so I was eagerly anticipating the release of the movie musical version. Almost 20 years separate the original stage version and the movie version and there were some changes made, most notably- Eva Peron's character was portrayed more sympathetically. Many felt that the reason for this was solely because the makers needed Former Argentine President Carlos Menem's approval so they could use the Presidential Palace in the celebrated balcony scene. Anyone who has read Alan Parker's Book, ""The Making of Evita"" will know that that is not entirely true. There have been many books about Eva Peron published since the opening of the stage musical but at the time when Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice decided to write a musical about Evita, there were not that many biographies on the subject. The only major biography available at the time was Mary Main's hostile and inaccurate ""The Woman With the Whip"". Notable historians of Eva Peron (Maryssa Navarro, Nicholas Fraser, J M Taylor, Alicia Dujovne Ortiz and even Alan Parker) have denounced this book since the books author was a rich Anglo-Argentine who used the opposition as her informants and her book (although well written) is a malicious, anti-Peronist and damaging view of Eva's life. She accuses Eva Peron of every unpleasant act known to man. Stating she slept her way to the top is one thing but accusing someone of murder and torture without having the slightest shred of evidence is pretty irresponsible- Mary Main even states in her book ...""there is no proof"". Alan Parker and Madonna who had read every book there was on Evita took this into consideration and is why they chose to portray a more balanced view of the woman.""Chicago"" (2002), is being credited as the film that revived the movie musical and although it is entertaining and technically well made, it was by no means (and I know that many would agree) the best film of the year. ""Evita"" pre-dates ""Chicago"" by many years and was the first major musical to come from Hollywood since ""Grease"". ""Evita"" is rarely given credit for breathing new life to a movie genre that had been dead for nearly 2 decades. In 1996 ""Evita"" (and Madonna) was snubbed by the Oscar's- although the movie did receive 5 Oscar nominations and it did win 3 Golden Globes, it didn't receive a nomination for ""Best Picture"" or ""Best Director"". Whether you loved the movie or hated it, one has to admit that Alan Parker did an extraordinary job in transferring the musical from stage to screen.In closing, ""Evita"" - the movie, like the woman herself, is a love it or hate it type of experience. Many will hate the subject matter, the politics, the fact that there is no spoken dialogue (rock operas/sung-through musicals are an acquired taste). Others will take offense at the film's so called glorification of an ""immoral"" and beautiful fascist leader. But for those wanting to experience something a little different- a Hollywood-esque attempt at a history lesson with some tango, pop, and theatre thrown in, ""Evita"" may be the movie for you. Give it a chance and you just might fall under the seductive spell of the elegantly dressed and bejeweled temptress in front of the microphone. That is the magic of ""Evita"".",5,Evita is Immortalized on the Silver Screen in a Spectacular Film Version of the Famous Musical.,1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,8586,"['life', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'one',

A meaty storyline, we all seem to relish in the tales of heroines who die young, a sumptuous latin setting and the winning combination of Tim Rice And Andrew Lloyd Webber.Madonna gives her best performance on film ever, but still manages to miss the mark. I enjoy Madonna, but just felt that she was not feminine enough, not pretty enough and was unable to sing strongly enough. I was never convinced it was Evita on the screen, always Madonna. I personally felt that all Madonna's years in the gym worked against her, as I was unable to ever see the fragility and vulnerability that Evita fought, and eventually succumbed to, all her life. I also think Madonna has a fine voice for pop music but fell short of her requirement in this role, too many times I awaited a high point or crescendo, and was left with a flat note or weak attempt. Although she did sound great on some of the less challenging numbers.Jonathon Pryce, who plays Peron, seemed uncomfortable in his role. I found myself wondering if he was trying to not overshadow his co-star. Unfortunately this left his performance flat and wooden, and nowhere near the level of expertise we have come to expect from him.As for Antonio Banderas, WOW. He stole the show, he is electric, passionate, humorous and who knew he could sing. He actually shows up Madonna when it comes to the singing, a rather sad statement, but true.All in all, the movie is well worth viewing, and I do not regret buying the DVD.

426931,AGY13TEH0Z785,6304504012,Jennifer Smith,"[3, 8]","Okay...to my opinion on Evita, The Motion Picture.  I am not comparing this to the Broadway play--I have not seen the play.  I am a musical fanatic, so it's not that I find musical productions boring or trite or weird or anything.  The movie really didn't do it for me.  I don't think Madonna should have been cast as Evita.Yes, I'm aware that there were similarities in Evita's and Madonna's lives, and even physical likenesses.  And yes, Madonna is a singer.  However, Madonna's voice, I feel, is not suited for the rangy, lusty material in this musical.  ""Like A Virgin"" is not ""Buenos Aires.""  After seeing this movie I listened to other recordings of Evita, and Madonna's renditions don't even come close to matching the passion and gusto to those of Laurie Beechman or Patti LuPone.  In fact, the ranges of the songs were quite obviously adjusted to compensate for Madonna's lack of vocal ability.One reviewer stated that ""This isn't the Broadway version, but this movie stands on its own.""  No, I don't agree.  A movie should be compared to others in its own genre.  A Broadway musical should not be made into a 3-hour music video.I also had a hard time with the way Evita was shot.  The song ""Buenos Aires"" is really lively and full of energy.  Madonna should have been out on a bright, sunny open marketplace, dancing(utilizing one of her strengths), with action happening all around; horses, peddlers, merchants, and aristocrats.

One is that I will always hate Andrew Lloyd Webber and another is that Madonna will never be a good actress. After seeing Alan Parker's 1996 musical ""Evita"" however, starring Madonna and featuring the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, I have had to amend those two statements slightly.""Evita"" is a gorgeous, lush film, full of thousands of extras, great location scenes and features a very talented cast. It acts almost as an incredibly big budgeted and elaborate music video, mainly because it features almost constant singing, and well, it stars one of the most visible music video stars of all time. Madonna finally found her part in this film, and no, it wasn't just easier because she didn't have a lot of speaking lines. It is clear that not only did she take voice lessons (which actually is true) because her voice quality was better than ""normal"", and has stayed that way since the making of this film, but she was able to knock off some decent dramatic moments. Banderas, though he spent a lot of the film looking pretty furious with the camera, doesn't have to prove any acting mettle (anyone who has seen him in an Almodovar film can attest to this) but did come up with a surprisingly good singing voice. Jonathan Pryce, who was curiously cast as Peron also did a good job, though his part was fairly minor, and even at that he was relegated to giving Evita a lot of loving looks. It's a slick production, some catchy music (I cannot believe I am actually saying that I actually really like a film featuring the music of the insipid, mainstream, gnome-like Webber) that is good enough to listen to extracurricularly and performances that weren't bad made for a pretty good and very entertaining viewing. Don't get me wrong - there are more than a few eye-rolling moments in ""Evita"", but the good definitely outweighs the bad, exponentially. The story, while coherent, was pretty mediocre, and I found that I felt that there were some things that were glossed over or trivialized with a cute musical number. I also have to add that Madonna in the beginning of the movie did look too old to be in her late teens.Admittedly, however, this IS a musical and you don't sign up for a hard-hitting knowledge fest when you watch one. This wasn't the first time I had seen this film, and yet I still end up getting so wrapped up in the action that I end up bawling a couple of times, and this viewing was no exception. While this hasn't made me a Madonna fan, I do hold her in higher esteem after seeing this film. I recommend this film for musical lovers and for those who simply appreciate great cinema.",4,Looks can be deceiving......took me this long to realize it.,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,2708,"['used', 'think', 'were', 'couple', 'absolutes', 'world', 'other', 'standard', 'issue', 'ones', 'One', 'will', 'always', 'hate', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Madonna', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'seeing', 'Alan', 'Parker', '1996', 'musical', 'Evita', 'however', 'starring', 'Madonna', 'featuring', 'music', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'have', 'had', 'amend', 'two', 'statements', 'slightly', 'Evita', 'gorgeous', 'lush', 'film', 'full', 'thousands', 'extras', 'great', 'location', 'scenes', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'almost', 'incredibly', 'big', 'budgeted', 'elaborate', 'music', 'video', 'mainly', 'almost', 'constant', 'singing', 'well', 'one', 'most', 'visible', 'music', 'video', 'stars', 'time', 'Madonna', 'finally', 'found', 'part', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'easier', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'speaking', 'lines', 'clear', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'take', 'voice', 'lessons', 'actually', 'true', 'voice', 'quality', 'was', 'better', 'normal', 'stayed', 'way', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'knock', 'off', 'decent', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Banderas', 'spent', 'lot', 'film', 'looking', 'pretty', 'furious', 'camera', ""n't"", 'have', 'prove', 'acting', 'mettle', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Almodovar', 'film', 'can', 'attest', 'did', 'come', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'singing', 'voice', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'who', 'was', 'curiously', 'cast', 'Peron', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'was', 'fairly', 'minor', 'even', 'was', 'relegated', 'giving', 'Evita', 'lot', 'loving', 'looks', 'slick', 'production', 'catchy', 'music', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'am', 'actually', 'saying', 'actually', 'really', 'film', 'featuring', 'music', 'insipid', 'mainstream', 'gnome-like', 'Webber', 'good', 'enough', 'listen', 'extracurricularly', 'performances', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'made', 'pretty', 'good', 'very', 'entertaining', 'viewing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'eye-rolling', 'moments', 'Evita', 'good', 'definitely', 'bad', 'exponentially', 'story', 'coherent', 'was', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'found', 'felt', 'were', 'things', 'were', 'glossed', 'trivialized', 'cute', 'musical', 'number', 'also', 'have', 'add', 'Madonna', 'beginning', 'movie', 'did', 'look', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'late', 'teens.Admittedly', 'however', 'musical', 'do', ""n't"", 'sign', 'up', 'hard-hitting', 'knowledge', 'fest', 'when', 'watch', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'still', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'action', 'end', 'up', 'bawling', 'couple', 'times', 'viewing', 'was', 'exception', ""n't"", 'made', 'Madonna', 'fan', 'do', 'hold', 'higher', 'esteem', 'seeing', 'film', 'recommend', 'film', 'musical', 'lovers', 'who', 'simply', 'appreciate', 'great', 'cinema']",N/A
426933,AI1VD7QWKM0V1,6304504012,Jessica Winney,"[1, 5]","I was so excited to see this movie when I heard that it was going to be released in 1996.  I was in the sixth grade and I loved Madonna, so anything with her in it was going to get my attention.  I had never heard of Eva Peron the person and I had certainly never heard of Evita the musical at the time I found out about the movie, but I quickly learned about Eva Peron through various documentaries about her that came out around the time the movie was released.  A&E did a documentary about her as part of their ""Biography"" series and I believe Lifetime did another documentary about her as part of their ""Intimate Portrait"" series.  I watched them both, then purchased Fraser and Navarro's biography and quickly became fascinated with the story of the dirt poor, illegitimate girl who rose to fame as an actress, married a rising colonel, became First Lady, went on to become a fanatical champion of the poor and of her husband's regime, dressed really, really well, then died tragically of cancer at 33, after which her husband had her body embalmed so it would last for eternity.  What's not to love?  The story's better than fiction.  Then I saw this movie and I was so disappointed!  I watched it again recently on DVD thinking I might have a different opinion of it and I didn't.  While the songs from the musical were great and I bought the soundtrack, I thought there was so much more to Evita's story than what could be told accurately in musical form (there are some things you just can't communicate in a song, you actually need to speak).  While I realize that the Broadway musical was performed with no dialogue, I just didn't feel that idea carried over very well onto film.  On film the whole thing came across like a really long music video starring Madonna and I found myself getting bored very quickly.  I thought that Madonna, who I love, was too old for the part (especially in the younger Evita scenes before she bleaches her hair blonde).  I thought (and still think) that instead of trying to re-create the musical as a film, they should have made a real movie (with dialogue) about Evita, like movies have been made about other historical figures.",2,Needed Dialogue,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,2173,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'released', '1996', 'was', 'sixth', 'grade', 'loved', 'Madonna', 'anything', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'attention', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'person', 'had', 'certainly', 'never', 'heard', 'Evita', 'musical', 'time', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'quickly', 'learned', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'various', 'documentaries', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'A', 'E', 'did', 'documentary', 'about', 'part', 'Biography', 'series', 'believe', 'Lifetime', 'did', 'documentary', 'about', 'part', 'Intimate', 'Portrait', 'series', 'watched', 'then', 'purchased', 'Fraser', 'Navarro', 'biography', 'quickly', 'became', 'fascinated', 'story', 'dirt', 'poor', 'illegitimate', 'girl', 'who', 'rose', 'fame', 'actress', 'married', 'rising', 'colonel', 'became', 'First', 'Lady', 'went', 'become', 'fanatical', 'champion', 'poor', 'husband', 'regime', 'dressed', 'really', 'really', 'well', 'then', 'died', 'tragically', 'cancer', '33', 'husband', 'had', 'body', 'embalmed', 'would', 'last', 'eternity', 'What', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'better', 'fiction', 'Then', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'watched', 'again', 'recently', 'DVD', 'thinking', 'might', 'have', 'different', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'songs', 'musical', 'were', 'great', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Evita', 'story', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'told', 'accurately', 'musical', 'form', 'are', 'things', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'song', 'actually', 'need', 'speak', 'realize', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'was', 'performed', 'dialogue', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'idea', 'carried', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'film', 'whole', 'thing', 'came', 'really', 'long', 'music', 'video', 'starring', 'Madonna', 'found', 'getting', 'bored', 'very', 'quickly', 'thought', 'Madonna', 'who', 'love', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'especially', 'younger', 'Evita', 'scenes', 'hair', 'blonde', 'thought', 'still', 'think', 'instead', 'trying', 're-create', 'musical', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'real', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'Evita', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'other', 'historical', 'figures']",N/A

To be sure, this is an either love-it-or-hate-it film, but if you allow yourself to get swept up in the first few moments, and accept the fact that there is no dialogue, only song, you are guaranteed an almost singular theatrical experience.  I was prepared to dismiss this film as another &quot;event movie&quot; and unexpectedly found myself enjoying every frame.  Madonna proves she is more than simply capable as an actress - here, she gives a career-definining performance that few of her contemporaries could have ever delivered.  Banderas is equally superb as Che, and JOnathan Pryce shines as Peron.  Part history lesson, all glorious music, Alan Parker's definitive screen classic sprawls before you in an epic that cannot be dismissed.

This role calls for a powerful singer and anyone who saw Patti LuPone do this role on Broadway will be struck with how unsuited Madonna's voice is for it. But she did try. Her dancing is fine, her look is almost right. She was too old to play young Eva and too robust looking to play sick, dying Eva but did a passable job as Eva at her height. And then there was the acting problem. Sometimes she was well grounded in the character and sometimes all you could see was Madonna just going through the motions pretending to be Evita. She and Jonathan Pryce had no chemistry at all and that was a flaw. The Perons may not have been a love match but they were a powerful team and it just didn't come across that way in the movie. The best thing about the movie is Antonio Banderas as the sarcastic, angry and ultimately shocked and heartbroken Che. He's not playing the historical Che of course but Che as a sort of smarter than the masses Greek chorus who follows Eva around pointing out the truth of her pretenions.This was a beautiful looking movie.

426952,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6304504012,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 8]","""Evita"" is more of an opera than it is a musical, which is to say that unlike ""The Sound of Music"" or ""Fiddler on the Roof"" you do not have any scenes with spoken dialogue.  Such scenes are important in those particular film versions because it is through dramatic action rather than songs that the seriousness of the Nazi occupation or the Tsar's pogroms are brought home to the audience.  But even without such opportunities Alan Parker's film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's ""Evita"" is a beautiful spectacle that is as well grounded in history as it is in the songs.  Darius Khondji's luscious cinematography is as much the star of the show as the music, whether he is depicting the grand pageantry of Evita's funeral or the stark figures of two people dancing a confrontational waltz.  You will want the widescreen version of this film.The real Evita Peron has always reminded me of Marilyn Monroe, in that I never really thought either woman was particularly attractive in the photographs I saw of them.  But when I saw actual film footage of either Evita or Marilyn (the original stage production of ""Evita"" did this especially well in the Rainbow Tour sequence) I could immediately tell these women had ""it.""  By such a standard Madonna is an apt casting choice.  Her singing is not quite up to the score, but it is up to the character of Eva Peron.  Besides, the fact Madonna managed to convince the President of Argentina to let her sing ""Don't Cry For Me, Argentina"" from the balcony of the Casa Rosada pretty much tips the balance of judgment in her favor as far as I am concerned.Ironically, given that I insist on characterizing ""Evita"" as an opera, I am arguing that unlike a performance at the Metropolitan Opera the voice is not the primary consideration in evaluating the performances.  Antonio Banderas is certainly the most pleasant surprise in the film, and his performance as Che Guevara needs to be seen as well as heard because it is more a matter of the actor's attitude than his more than adequate singing voice.  Jonathan Pryce underplays the role of Juan Peron more than his theatrical counterparts, but that is certainly more in keeping with the tone and tenor of the film.Alan Parker was the perfect choice to direct this film, since his resume includes both reality based musicals (""The Commitments,"" ""Fame"") and dramas (""Mississippi Burning,"" ""Midnight Express"").  The controversy over how much credit Oliver Stone deserves for his screenwriting aside, the adaptation of the stage version is superb.  The use of two ""new"" songs (one is from the original studio album with the lyrics changed to cover the growing unrest in Argentina instead of Che's dream of inventing a new insecticide) helps to transform ""Evita"" from a theater piece into a cohesive film.  Critics of the musical have argued ""Evita"" is a glorification of fascism, but there is less reason to make such a charge against this movie, where political slant of the film slowly but surely strips away the pretense of the rags to riches story.The DVD version, while as excellent a pairing of picture and sound quality as you are going to find, has el zippo grande in the way of extras, which is an absolute shame.  It took longer for the film version of ""Evita"" to be made than it did ""Gone With the Wind"" and the story behind the making of this film is almost as interesting.  There will features about the making of ""Evita"" that could have been included, as well as the music videos or some mini-documentary on the real Eva Person, and certainly the commentary of the director would have been especially interesting given the storied history of this production.

Many people criticize her acting (""such a drama queen,"" ""overestimates her abilities,"" blah blah blah), but I thought she was pretty good in this one. Besides, her singing and dancing made up for anything else that could be wrong, in my opinion. Her voice is so distinctive, so strong, so closely fitting to emotions that the songs should envoke.Antonio Banderas was excellent too. What a voice AND what gorgeous hair. Being a huge musical and Madonna fan, I was so excited for this movie to come out...I can hardly believe it's been 10 years now. I was in 9th grade, and the ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" dance mix was constantly on the radio - I even bought the single, along with the 2-disc soundtrack. I still have the ticket stub (when matinees were only [...]!) on my bulletin board.When the movie was over in the theater, I remember hearing the woman behind me tell her friend, ""That's gotta win an Oscar,"" and I agreed with her. I think it only won one oscar, though it was nominated for several. Hollywood critics tend to snub musicals, especially this one, because few of them seem to respect Madonna as an actress.Overall, I think Evita is highly entertaining, a perfect escape from reality, beautiful to watch. I did find it kind of funny that they tried to pass Madonna off as a 15 year old in the beginning of the movie, when she's trying to convince Magaldi to take her to the city (#5 on the soundtrack). She looked good with dark brown hair, but not any younger than her late 20s.My favorite songs (though I love most of them) are Rainbow High (the shopping spree) and Waltz for Eve and Che. Good Night and Thank You is pretty funny.The best part about this movie is that it's a complete musical. Barely any normal dialogue.

I had mixed feelings on Madonna playing the role, but those feelings were soothed.  She is perfect as Eva Peron.  She has so much passion for the role!  This is the part she was born to play.  Antonio Banderas can sing--who knew?  He is perfect as Che, Eva's opposition.  And can he carry a tune!  Listen to him especially during 'High Flying Adored.'  Wow!!  And let's not forget the legendary Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron.  He, like Madonna, has so much passion for the role.  Would you expect anything else from The Engineer from 'Miss Saigon'?  Make sure you pay attention to 'You Must Love Me,' the song that won the Oscar.Lloyd Webber gives us one of the best productions I have ever seen.

I think this film is a true work of art, and if you never see the film, you will be missing  out on a superb work of cinematographic art -  One of the greatest  qualities of this film is that it does not excessively stray from the  original material (And when it does, it does so in the right places).  Andrew Lloyd Webber's great score gives this film the musical beauty that  made the Broadway production a hit almost thirty years ago. The script  contains the classic Tim Rice trademark - the ambiguity in characters. It  does not allow the viewer to say &quot;Aha - she's good!&quot;, or  &quot;Aha - she's bad!&quot;. There is plenty of evidence to support both  sides, leaving the viewer thinking about Evita even after seeing the movie  (How many other movies do you know that make the viewer think?).  As  for the cast, I think the actors performed surprisingly well. I further  think Banderas outdid Pattinkin. I'm sure Mandy's fans want to bite my head  off (or think that I lack one), and to them I say this -- The day I hear  Mandy perform &quot;sing you fools&quot; with enough emotion to make me  snarl with anger at communist dictatorships for days after seeing the film,  I'll change my views. True, Madonna is not a vocal superstar like Patti  LuPone, but considering that she performed the same role as Patti, with the  score transposed only one step down - all during a pregnancy, I think her  performance is rather commendable.  The cinematography itself is  stunning - There is not a single frame in the film at which you can say  &quot;What the heck are they showing me that?&quot;. Every shot is well  planned and contributes to the plot and the mood of the film.  The  bottom line - see this movie.

Evita premiered on Broadway in 1979 with Patti LuPone.  This made overnight stars of not only Paige and LuPone and Mandy Patinkin but Andrew Lloyd Webber.Since then it has become a Hollywood Jonah.  Everyone from Barbra Streisand to Bette Middler to Meryl Streep have been cast in (or mentioned for) the lead and as many top line directors including Oliver Stone have been attached.  Disney finally bought the rights for Maddona and the film died.  A decade passed and finally everything falls in place including Maddona.  I am not a big fan of Maddona but she can sing, she is Latino and she is not too old to play Eva Peron.This film came together with near perfection.  The film went back to the concept album.  The only major changes were Eva now sings the best song in the score ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"" and for continuity some of Che's songs were assigned to others (in the musical Che performed many minor characters.Madonna was brilliant as Eva but the find was Antonio Banderas as Che.  No one knew that he could sing!  The only miscasting is Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron but this is a minor flaw.For most of the 80's and 90's, musicals have been disasters.  The main reason is directors chosen have no musical experience (John Huston did Annie and Richard Attenborough did A Chorus Line).  For Evita, Alan Parker was chosen.  Parker scored a triumph for the musical Fame in 1980.  Parker's choices were perfection, this is a crisp and clean film.  The film could have been overly sentimental or cloying but Parker chose the straight path, tell the story and let the emotion evolve from the story.If you liked the musical, you will love the movie.

No one could have done the role more justice.  Together with Antonio Bandaras and Jonathan Price, the screen ignites with hot music, cool numbers and ""that little something extra"".  A new song, 'You Must Love Me' that Madonna wrote really gives the film a shot in the arm during its second half.Unfortunately, the transfer of this film is just bare bones and a shade above my usual vote for ""bad"".  Though widescreen, this movie is not enhanced for 16X9 televisions.  Aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement are present throughout.  Colors are slightly muddy and darker scenes really suffer from a loss of fine detail.  The 5.1 audio is explosive, giving full range to Andrew Lloyd Webber's classy classic score.  WARNING: This is not a Hollywood musical - it's a rock opera.  In other words very little is said on the screen that is not accompanied by a full orchestra arrangement.

Another very  big innacuracy is the unproven fact that Eva ran away with Magaldi, the tango singer, even though it's one of the many theories on how she made it to the big city and perhaps the most accepted, but, he was not married nor he had a child.I could go on and on and on about the many errors in the movie, rumor has it that Rice and Webber based the whole musical solely on one book, without doing any extensive reasearch about the life of Eva Peron, I read the book that they claim was the base for the whole thing and I have to say, it's the most boring book I've read and it was written by a total anti peronist.In short, if you want to see a good musical, great scenarios, nice customs, very good music and see a great Madonna performance, EVITA will please you, however, if you are interested in the life of the real Eva, I suggest you get some of the books that are offered here, like the one by Alicia Dujovne Ortiz or the one by Marisa Navarro and even the novel Santa Evita (GREAT BOOK), they will give you a better view and you can rest assure that extensive research was done by their authors and it's not a partial view of 2 people who only write music or of an anti peronist who decided to bad mouth Evita.",4,Great Movie many historical innacuracies,1055808000,"06 17, 2003",2003,1908,"['am', 'true', 'Madonna', 'fan', 'even', 'Madonna', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'already', 'hooked', 'story', 'Eva', 'Peron.Although', 'movie', 'amazing', 'visual', 'effects', 'music', 'even', 'how', 'much', 'Madonna', 'looked', 'Eva', 'portrayed', 'strong', 'character', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'historical', 'incongruences', 'way', 'was', 'implied', 'Eva', 'slept', 'way', 'top', 'maybe', 'did', 'have', 'affairs', 'notable', 'gentlemen', ""n't"", 'first', 'last', 'one', 'sleep', 'way', 'first', 'thing', 'made', 'shake', 'head', 'was', 'father', 'funeral', 'scene', 'real', 'life', 'Eva', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'thing', 'father', 'dead', 'yet', 'movie', 'very', 'big', 'innacuracy', 'unproven', 'fact', 'Eva', 'ran', 'away', 'Magaldi', 'tango', 'singer', 'even', 'one', 'many', 'theories', 'how', 'made', 'big', 'city', 'perhaps', 'most', 'accepted', 'was', 'not', 'married', 'had', 'child.I', 'could', 'go', 'many', 'errors', 'movie', 'rumor', 'Rice', 'Webber', 'based', 'whole', 'musical', 'solely', 'one', 'book', 'doing', 'extensive', 'reasearch', 'life', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'read', 'book', 'claim', 'was', 'base', 'whole', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'boring', 'book', ""'ve"", 'read', 'was', 'written', 'total', 'anti', 'peronist.In', 'short', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'musical', 'great', 'scenarios', 'nice', 'customs', 'very', 'good', 'music', 'see', 'great', 'Madonna', 'performance', 'EVITA', 'will', 'please', 'however', 'are', 'interested', 'life', 'real', 'Eva', 'suggest', 'get', 'books', 'are', 'offered', 'here', 'one', 'Alicia', 'Dujovne', 'Ortiz', 'one', 'Marisa', 'Navarro', 'even', 'novel', 'Santa', 'Evita', 'GREAT', 'BOOK', 'will', 'give', 'better', 'view', 'can', 'rest', 'assure', 'extensive', 'research', 'was', 'done', 'authors', 'not', 'partial', 'view', '2', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'write', 'music', 'anti', 'peronist', 'who', 'decided', 'bad', 'mouth', 'Evita']",N/A

Not only is the continuity vulgarized, the director often manages to confuse the film viewer as to what exactly is going on. This is not a great film, not even a good one, what carries it are the production values, songs, and locations.After getting through the extremely boring commencement of the picture, I noticed that there would be no dialogue in this picture at all, at every moment someone was singing a silly and repetitive song. This isn't bad in its whole, but when everyone is already confused about the character it becomes extremely agitating. The voice dubs of the songs are so apparent that the film seems contrived and indifferent to its tackiness. Here we have people that are supposed to be singing and yet the contorted sound room song is playing and they are merely mouthing their parts. Banderas is terrible in his singing abilities yet his presence is well recommended. In this role he plays the conscience of the working class, a ""Che Guevera"" type revolutionary whom witnesses Eva's ascension and ultimate fall.Madonna is wonderful in this role, not only can she move around the screen in charismatic beauty but her songs are capable and worthy. The sets are absolutely gorgeous and the costumes are fabulous. What we get in the end is a romanticized MTV style video but it is dreadfully long at 2 1/2 hours. I couldn't wait til the termination.

But, Madonna and Antonio do a fairly good job.Second, Madonna's voice. It's not that she doesn't have a nice voice because she does. It's just that her voice doesn't fit the character of Eva peron. Again, this problem could've been solved by casting Patti LuPone.Third, this is my BIGGEST problem with this movie- I don't like the changes they made from the original play. Others movies have been changed and it worked out fine, but this one........is another story. I do like the new song they put it- the kind of rockish one that tells about the problems with the country. However, every other change they make, gives the wrong impression of Eva Peron. The movie makes her out to be a whole lot nicer than she really was. I just don't like this portrayl of Eva Peron because it's not who she was. I also don't like how they portrayed her husband, Juan Peron. The movie made him seem like a straight, grown-up man while in real life, he was actual very childish and immature.All in all, I love this movie and can watch it over and over again.

Harmon ""bobnbob3""","[30, 32]","Worth noting that Evita is wall-to-wall music with virtually no spoken lines: not an opera so much as an extended music video, so the pop-music motifs need not be an anachronism.I'm not a fan of Madonna, I find Andrew Lloyd Webber's music a bit obvious .. and yet -- and yet. Here everything seems to come together. It's a visually gorgeous film, the added songs (The Lady's Got Potential, You Must Love Me) are strong enhancements. The Che character's change from Che Guevara in the stage version to an Argentine Everyman here (desk clerk, bartender, cabinet minister, union activist) is an improvement over the stage musical and Antonio Banderas is a smoldering presence who carries the movie. Jimmy Nail is perfect as the oily tango singer; Jonathan Pryce capable in an equally slick role as the would-be, but hesitant, dictator. The montage songs are splendid, like Goodnight and Thank You, that bucket-brigade sequence of Eva's lovers that she uses (and the film uses) to get her from the street to the Casa Rosada, or like A New Argentina, in which Eva takes Juan from jail to the presidency. The faux-English country house lawn where Eva faces down upper-class disdain (Peron's Latest Flame, The Actress Hasn't Learned the Lines You Like to Hear) is another brilliant staging. It all rings true, visually.I've had others tell me the lyrics seemed shallow. ""Don't cry for me, Argentina, and don't forget to get milk and bread at the store ... "" Well, yes. That's the point. She didn't say much more than that. Banality often suffices in public life; politics are shtick in a media age; actors can leverage elections. The lady couldn't act but she could, as others have said, seduce a nation. She won't be the last actor to do so.Recommend owning the DVD for the cinematic values at the very least. It's a dark vision of public affairs but the times probably affirm it. And it was the best role of Eva's lifetime.

And what a movie.Madonna gives a fine performance in this role, and I honestly can't think on an actress out there that could have given a better performance as Evita. I think Alan Parker intentionally took advantage of Madonna's experience in music video to make the movie version of Evita as fast paced as a music video album - and it works remarkably well. No, it isn't the stage version. This movie stands on its own. Yeah, Madonna is emotionally distant, but she was obviously playing up the real character's narcissistic qualities to the hilt. I think the emotional distance let's you understand how corrupt and manipulative the Peron's really were. You are fascinated by Evita and admire her drive, but see a balanced picture of her - not a saint by any means.Besides the great photography and editing, the sound of the DVD version of this film is something worth going out and buying a surround sound system for. The songs have never sounded better, the orchestra is wonderful, and there are moments in the soundtrack that make your hair stand up on edge.Parker slowly builds up to the famous balcony scene where Evita sings &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina.&quot; I have never really liked that song, but Parker and Madonna put it in a context where you almost want to stand up and cheer. Suspend disbelief is an understatement. Parker gets the audience caught up in the spirit of revolution, of Argentina, and of the masses. I haven't experienced anything like that since seeing a live performance of Les Miserables.My only criticism of the movie would be that Parker failed to take advantage of putting any real dance sequences in the film. Most significant was the Buenos Aires sequence where we see Madonna riding a train when she should have been dancing her brains out.Madonna helped mix the soundtrack - she should have won on Oscar or Grammy for that alone. The big surprise was how well Anthony Banderos sang as Che. His voice stands up to any singer on Broadway. Jonathan Pryce give a fine performance as Juan Perron. There are no real special features to speak of, which is a real disappointment. But I can give this five stars with a clear conscience because of the fine performances, the stunning widescreen presentation, the quality of the video, and great mix of the soundtrack.

It is what's known as a rock opera with very little dialogue in the entire plot (and most of the dialogue is speeches made by Eva or Juan).  Also, as a first time viewer, one may get somewhat confused over what exactly is going on, such as the scene where Eva is asking Magaldi to take her to Buenos Aires.  However as one watches it a second or third time they begin to pick up personality traits of Eva and even more details of her story.Antonio Banderas' performance as Che Guervare was magnificant though upstaged by Madonna the majority of the time, prevelant in the scene ""Waltz for Eva and Che"" and in ""Goodnight and Thank You""  The other principle vocalists were great such as Jimmy Nail (Augustin Magaldi) and Johnathan Pryce (Peron).  The differential in voices for each of this characters makes the viewer want to listen and get lost in what they're saying.Madonna, managed to be serious in her role, which is different from the roles that she usually plays.  She looked decent in costumes, compared to what she usually wears, and had the diva attitude that made Evita jump off the screen and into the homes of the viewers.  There is a slight irony that comes from Madonna playing Eva in that Eva was a love/hate persona much like Madonna of the current generation.Everytime the DVD is watch there is more to be gained.

She sings, she kind of acts, and  it's all very trite.The star of this movie is Banderas. He's a powerful  presence that controls every frame that he's in. The only time that Madonna  shines in the movie is when she and Banderas are having their fantasy  debate over the politics of the country. They have a great chemistry, or at  least a better one than their last movie outing (which would be the  egotistical Truth or Dare where Banderas smiled at Madonna, nodded to his  wife, and let her know that he was not going to be getting into this  woman's list of sexual conquests). Jonathan Pryce is pretty good too, but  he has nothing to work with.The rest of the movie is boring. Tim Rice  and Andrew Lloyd Weber have ruled Broadway by creating epic pangeants on  the basis of two songs. Almost every single song in this movie is a rehash  of &quot;don't cry for me Argentina&quot; that you kind of hate that song  when they finally sing it. THere's a second song in the thing too, but I  forget it. The only decent piece is that revolution song sung by Banderas  the chronicles the shifting allegiances of a country that pulls a military  coup every six months. It's a dopy rock opera song but at least it's not so  blatantly the main song rehashed.The plot of the movie is non-existant.  Actually that's not accurate. The plot of the movie happens in the first  hour. Eva comes to the capital, beds a bunch of guys, ends up with Juan  Peron, becomes first lady based both on her personality than his political  manuvering.The rest of the movie has her dying of cancer.

Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron, Antonio Banderas as a fiery revolutionary &#34;chorus&#34; character, and especially Madonna as Evita make this essentially shallow and silly material work. Some of the songs are catchy, but it's the film's image of power and success built on the suffering and exploitation of the poor that remains in one's memory. In the wake of Pope Francis's election, Madonna's look here recalls images of Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner decked out in haute couture outfits during her presidential election in a country where millions live in utter poverty, and it's no surprise that the &#34;Peronist&#34; party remains in power there today.Madonna, after making a favorable impression in &#34;Dick Tracy,&#34; gets the role of her life here as the powerful woman who uses sex to rise to the top of her game before a swift and tragic demise. As one expects from Madonna, the film is laden with Catholic imagery (she has a rock-star swoon during communion in one scene) mingled with symbols of power and sex. She sings and seduces her way through the film with cheerful, effortless charm. There is certainly a narcissism and superficiality to Evita, but it's a fun movie inasmuch as it revels in these qualities with a cheeky self-awareness that hints at the dark side of its protagonist.This DVD is the original bare bones 1990s release, with &#34;play&#34; and chapter stops, no special features.

The points I make, though, I still think are valid.The casting of this movie was quite good...the stars of the show pulled off their roles magnificently.  Antonio Banderas, in the lead as the narrator, Ch&eacute;, sung surprisingly well.  He also acted out the part superbly.  While he's no Colm Wilkinson, there's an undeniable charm to his portrayal.  Even with the abbreviated material he's given to work with, he pulls it off with style, which says something for a role with magnificent performances by Colm and by David Essex.  He's not vocally better than either, but he plays the part to a T, and his songs seem HONEST.  Also, he's a better Ch&eacute; than Mandy Patinkin, but I suppose anybody who tried to actually play the part would be.Madonna is the surprise of this movie.  She sings quite well, and given the rock feel of the show, is fairly appropriate for the part of Eva Peron.  She's also visually very similar to photographs of Eva, and looks very convincing after the scenes where she is supposed to be young.  However...the point of the musical is that Eva Peron is a manipulative (rhymes with witch).  Madonna scared me here by seeming VERY sympathetic to her character.  Still, her performance is excellent, if not up to Antonio Banderas's.  Jonathan Pryce put in an outstanding performance as Peron, too.A caveat emptor:  the musical was actually made less harsh for the movie version, so that it could be filmed in Argentina.  It was very nearly worth it...not entirely, mind you, and the addition of &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; seemed entirely out of place in a musical about a man and a woman who mutually USE each other.  Still, her &quot;Don't Cry for Me Argentina&quot; was manipulative to the audience just as the speech was meant to be to the crowd.  And the two Ch&eacute; tours de force, &quot;Oh What a Circus&quot; and &quot;High Flying, Adored&quot; are more or less in tact, and done wonderfully.  The re-adaptation of &quot;The Lady's Got Potential&quot; was excellent, and &quot;And the Money Kept Rolling In&quot; was toned down a lot, but Banderas had a LOT of fun in the number.The movie's worth seeing if you like Evita, or are thinking you might be getting into it.

427019,A3I4XJW0NJROQ2,6304504012,w.s.,"[0, 0]","'Evita' is a brilliant film adaptation of the Broadway musical, written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. It tells the story of Argentina's First Lady Eva Duarte de Peron, also known as Evita. Evita was born into severe circumstances. Her father died when she was a little girl and her family (who was considered illegitimate since her father and mother never married) endured poverty and alienation. But all of this struggle lit a fierce fire in her belly, and she struck out on her own as a teenager in search of fame and fortune. This journey took her from radio star and film actress to the First Lady of Argentina. During her prime, she received both incredible admiration from the masses and criticism from the establishment. When she died at age 33 from cancer, she left behind a legacy that still haunts Argentina to this day.The film features both amazing music and acting. There is wall-to-wall singing and very little spoken dialogue, but I didn't care since I have a deep love for music. However, people who don't care for musicals would obviously be advised to stay away. Antonio Banderas does a great job as the film's narrator Che. He displays great emotional intensity and adds an authentic Latin flavor to the role. And who knew he could sing that well? Jonathan Pryce is an appropriate Juan Peron: charismatic in his own way, but passive enough to stand back in awe of his powerful wife at times.But the star of the show is clearly Madonna. She put her heart and soul into this role and, given her previously bad films, I was impressed. She clearly feels a connection to Evita, and both women have many similarities. They both lost one of their parents at a very young age, they both possess boundless ambition and strong will, they both received great adulation and scrutiny, etc, etc. I'm sure this was a big reason why the part fit Madonna like a glove. Also, Madonna is reportedly responsible for making Eva more dimensional, and therefore more realistic, than the stage version. Tim Rice wrote the musical with Mary Main's slanderous biography, The Woman With The Whip, as a main inspiration. Therefore, Eva was mainly portrayed as a ruthless power hungry tyrant in the play. Eva could be manipulative and domineering at times, but there was also a softer, warmer side to her that the movie version managed to show.Besides her acting, Madonna's vocal range and quality also improved, compared to her earlier days as a ""raw talent"". Many complained that Madonna, a pop singer, didn't have the chops to tackle the role that Broadway singers Patti LuPone and Elaine Page played. Well, their voices have different objectives. Its all about context. Broadway singers are allowed to fill up the huge theaters with their huge voices. However, an operatic style would have been too overbearing for a film. A capable pop singer, with a less harsh and simpler style of singing, is much more appropriate for a movie. Plus, all of her experience as a music performer gave her the training to portray emotions convincingly through song. She manages to be alternately passionate (""A New Argentina"", ""Waltz for Che and Eva""), self-confident (""Rainbow High"", ""Buenos Aires"") and vulnerable (""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"", ""You Must Love Me"").If you're a fan of Madonna, musicals, or want to learn about a fascinating historical figure, then buy this film.

I agree with most people that didn't like the movie at all. Madonna is not a good actress, but also she doesn't have the vocals to pull this movie off. It's not all bad. In many songs she sounds very good but it does seem strained at times and uncomfortable. No doubt her vocals have improved due to her singing lessons for this film, which is evident in her later albums.The movie as a whole is very MTV. It's chopped up in way to get tour attention and distracting from a weak script. I didn't come away really knowing Evita as a person. The movie is completely sung which is a little irritating. If it was done the way most musicals are done then I think there would have been better character development. Let's blame the director for that.The DVD itself is bare. It should have the actors at the premiere, Madonna's speech for her Golden Globe (which by the way was very moving). If only she can incorporate those kind of emotions to her acting then she would be on to something. The picture and sound are beautiful and Madonna does look amazing. If you don't care for Madonna, don't subject yourself to this movie. If you are a Madonna fan, skip to the more enjoyable songs. There are some good songs and Madonna does some of those songs well.",3,Not Great. 2.5 Stars,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,1354,"['First', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Madonna', 'fan', 'loved', 'music', '20', 'years', 'acting', 'story', 'agree', 'most', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Madonna', 'not', 'good', 'actress', 'also', ""n't"", 'have', 'vocals', 'pull', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'many', 'songs', 'very', 'good', 'seem', 'strained', 'times', 'uncomfortable', 'doubt', 'vocals', 'have', 'improved', 'due', 'singing', 'lessons', 'film', 'evident', 'later', 'albums.The', 'movie', 'whole', 'very', 'MTV', 'chopped', 'up', 'way', 'get', 'tour', 'attention', 'distracting', 'weak', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'really', 'knowing', 'Evita', 'person', 'movie', 'completely', 'sung', 'little', 'irritating', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'most', 'musicals', 'are', 'done', 'then', 'think', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'Let', 'blame', 'director', 'that.The', 'DVD', 'bare', 'should', 'have', 'actors', 'premiere', 'Madonna', 'speech', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'way', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'only', 'can', 'incorporate', 'kind', 'emotions', 'acting', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Madonna', 'look', 'amazing', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Madonna', 'do', ""n't"", 'subject', 'movie', 'are', 'Madonna', 'fan', 'skip', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'songs', 'Madonna', 'songs', 'well']",N/A

Everybody says that Eva Peron lived a shallow-hallow life.  Okay, that's fine ... but then why discredit the movie for depicting this exact situation?  During the movie we, as viewers, are ""emotionally distanced"" from Madonna as Evita, but ... in real life that's exactly how her subjects felt, too, right?  So how does the movie ""fail"" on that account?And as far as Madonna goes ... this was pretty much the first (and last) time I ever saw her ""acting"" in every sense of the word.  She was, by far, quite convincing.  Way to go on that Golden Globe win!But I do understand the tediousness of sitting through two-plus hours of complete and utter singing and emoting.  There was simply NO downtime at all ANYWHERE during the course of the movie.  It works best watching it at home on television ... at least then you can pause and start and pause and start at will.  I pity those that actually had to sit through this in a theater.",5,"Don't cry for Madonna, Argentina ...",1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,1051,"['First', 'think', 'people', 'take', 'time', 'type', 'up', 'movie', 'reviews', 'forget', 'what', ""'re"", 'typing', 'exactly', 'Everybody', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'lived', 'shallow-hallow', 'life', 'Okay', 'fine', 'then', 'why', 'discredit', 'movie', 'depicting', 'exact', 'situation', 'movie', 'viewers', 'are', 'emotionally', 'distanced', 'Madonna', 'Evita', 'real', 'life', 'exactly', 'how', 'subjects', 'felt', 'too', 'right', 'So', 'how', 'movie', 'fail', 'account', 'as', 'far', 'Madonna', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'first', 'last', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'acting', 'sense', 'word', 'was', 'far', 'quite', 'convincing', 'Way', 'go', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'win', 'do', 'understand', 'tediousness', 'sitting', 'two-plus', 'hours', 'complete', 'utter', 'singing', 'emoting', 'was', 'simply', 'NO', 'downtime', 'ANYWHERE', 'course', 'movie', 'best', 'watching', 'home', 'television', 'least', 'then', 'can', 'pause', 'start', 'pause', 'start', 'will', 'pity', 'actually', 'had', 'sit', 'theater']",N/A
427022,AGW68YZZPOK6,6304504012,Xavier Limtuaco,"[3, 3]","I finally got the Blu-ray edition of Evita and it is simply superb! I wasn't exactly happy about the sound quality of the DVD edition but now, with even sharper images and brilliant sound, this modern classic gets the treatment it deserves on Blu-ray. Plus, there is a 42-minute movie-in-the-making, the wonderful teaser trailer of the film (I was entranced when I first saw this in theaters 16 years ago) and the video of the Oscar-winninng ""You Must Love Me"" which were not available in the DVD edition.With the fantastic audio-visuals of this timeless musical, I was so enthralled in watching Evita all over again and Madonna was simply brilliant in her final balcony scene and death scene that she succeeded in moving me to tears once again much like when I first saw this film on the wide screen. Making ""Evita"" was one of the best decisions Madonna ever made in her movie career since playing Eva Peron was truly the role of a lifetime. It is, therefore, an injustice that she was not even nominated for an Oscar and the film and director too. She deserved the Oscar that year! Nevertheless, Madonna's Golden Globe win as Best Actress was really much deserved and getting to play Evita (with so many acting and music highlights plus 90 beautiful costume changes) was already a reward in itself. Evita also won the Golden Globe for Best Picture and Best Song and was one of the year's Ten Best Films of the National Board of Review in 1996. Those awards were real affirmations of the film's excellence.For all lovers of musicals, please add Evita on Blu-ray in your list of must-haves. Madonna fans should be proud that Evita finally got the treatment it deserves on Blu-ray after 16 long years! Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce also deserve special mention for also showing their best as Che and Juan Peron respectively. They were both brilliant in their roles. Kudos to Alan Parker for your vision and inspired direction.
