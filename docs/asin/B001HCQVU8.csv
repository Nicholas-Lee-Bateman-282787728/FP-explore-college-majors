1199908,A1KFWSYZIOBI3Y,B001HCQVU8,"DaRRen ""Darren""","[7, 8]","This was a great thriller. It has this 1980s quality to it -- which means it does not rely on special effects and blood splatter to pull in the viewer. Instead, it works due to good writing and acting. I am surprised that it does not have more reviews. This is a very entertaining film. I am now going to watch the others in the series.The only criticism I could offer is that there were so many characters in this film that it was difficult to keep the names together. Perhaps the other shows introduce the characters; I didn't know it was  series until doing some web research. This is only a minor flaw.",5,Really good thriller!,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,606,"['was', 'great', 'thriller', '1980s', 'quality', 'not', 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'blood', 'splatter', 'pull', 'viewer', 'Instead', 'due', 'good', 'writing', 'acting', 'am', 'surprised', 'not', 'have', 'more', 'reviews', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'am', 'now', 'going', 'watch', 'others', 'series.The', 'only', 'criticism', 'could', 'offer', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'was', 'difficult', 'keep', 'names', 'together', 'Perhaps', 'other', 'shows', 'introduce', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'series', 'doing', 'web', 'research', 'only', 'minor', 'flaw']",N/A

From the soundtrack to the acting by Victor Garber, the movie just does not have the intensity of a murder mystery. I realize (now) that it was made for television, but even knowing that does not help improve my opinion. Perhaps not having cable or satellite in our home for the past 15 years has raised my expectations for made-for-tv movies to a level that is too high.",3,Average,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,455,"['story', 'depth', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'soundtrack', 'acting', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'have', 'intensity', 'murder', 'mystery', 'realize', 'now', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'even', 'knowing', 'not', 'help', 'improve', 'opinion', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'having', 'cable', 'satellite', 'home', 'past', '15', 'years', 'raised', 'expectations', 'made-for-tv', 'movies', 'level', 'too', 'high']",N/A
1199912,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B001HCQVU8,Michael Butts,"[19, 20]","One of the four movies in the 'Joanne Kilbourne Mysteries', A COLDER KIND OF DEATH is a competent little thriller.  Wendy Crewson returns as Kilbourne, who is shocked when the murderer of her husband is finally caught after six years.  The accused professes his innocence, but in vain when a sniper kills him on the way out of the police station.  Who is responsible and why did they kill him.  The accused also has a malicious wife, played with seething venom by Kari Matchett, who suggests she had an affair with the late Mr. Kilbourne.  The suspects include a cache of politically motivated friends, including Oscar nominee Teri Garr (from TOOTSIE).Brad Turner keeps his direction crisp, and the performances overall are very good.  Victor Garber (now on ABC's ALIAS) has a solid presence as Kilbourne's ex-partner.I've enjoyed the three of these movies I've viewed so far; they're intelligent and good mysteries.",4,THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,916,"['One', 'four', 'movies', ""'Joanne"", 'Kilbourne', 'Mysteries', 'A', 'COLDER', 'KIND', 'OF', 'DEATH', 'competent', 'little', 'thriller', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'Kilbourne', 'who', 'shocked', 'when', 'murderer', 'husband', 'finally', 'caught', 'six', 'years', 'accused', 'innocence', 'vain', 'when', 'sniper', 'way', 'police', 'station', 'Who', 'responsible', 'why', 'did', 'kill', 'accused', 'also', 'malicious', 'wife', 'played', 'seething', 'venom', 'Kari', 'Matchett', 'who', 'had', 'affair', 'late', 'Mr.', 'Kilbourne', 'suspects', 'include', 'cache', 'politically', 'motivated', 'friends', 'including', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'TOOTSIE', '.Brad', 'Turner', 'direction', 'crisp', 'performances', 'overall', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'now', 'ABC', 'ALIAS', 'solid', 'presence', 'Kilbourne', 'ex-partner.I', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'three', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'so', 'far', ""'re"", 'intelligent', 'good', 'mysteries']",N/A
