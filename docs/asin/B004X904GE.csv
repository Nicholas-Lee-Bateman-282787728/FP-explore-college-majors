1431638,AKZGOBZGR1WA3,B004X904GE,A.K.A. Me,"[17, 17]","This series couldn't be cuter or more entertaining. I've had cats and dogs all my life, but would not have described myself as a ""cat person"" until this show came along, and now I am HOOKED! The host is a charming young man who really does seem to love cats. He visits cats and their owners all over the country. The show has featured the ""Cat House"" which many of us are familiar with, but I just can't get enough of; a tree surgeon who rescues cats-up-tall-trees in his spare time, the Alamo's Guard-Cat, performing cats, fashionista cats, cats in wigs, and some WONDERFUL folks who have devoted their lives to saving cats from abuse, neglect and euthanasia. A recent viral video of a California ""cat burglar"" came from this show, as did many other much-viewed videos, I'm sure. Our host plays with the cats, talks with the cats, and sings to the cats. In one episode, he becomes part of an animal sculpture! Even the theme song hooks you. I recommend this for cat lovers of all ages, animal lovers in general, and it might even win over a few who are not-so-sold on cats...yet.NOTE: I wrote this review before the DVD series was released. According to a more recent review, the last episode of the series is missing from the DVD set. You have to wonder how on earth something like that can happen ... this kind of carelessness might explain questions I have had about the quality of other series I have had in the past, but in any event, although I intended to purchase this series pretty quickly upon its release, that isn't going to happen until this error is corrected.",5,"CATegorically, the Cat's Pajamas!",1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,1575,"['series', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'cuter', 'more', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'had', 'cats', 'dogs', 'life', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'described', 'cat', 'person', 'show', 'came', 'along', 'now', 'am', 'HOOKED', 'host', 'charming', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'seem', 'love', 'cats', 'cats', 'owners', 'country', 'show', 'featured', 'Cat', 'House', 'many', 'are', 'familiar', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'tree', 'surgeon', 'who', 'cats-up-tall-trees', 'spare', 'time', 'Alamo', 'Guard-Cat', 'performing', 'cats', 'fashionista', 'cats', 'cats', 'wigs', 'WONDERFUL', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'devoted', 'lives', 'saving', 'cats', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'euthanasia', 'recent', 'viral', 'video', 'California', 'cat', 'burglar', 'came', 'show', 'did', 'many', 'other', 'much-viewed', 'videos', ""'m"", 'sure', 'host', 'plays', 'cats', 'talks', 'cats', 'sings', 'cats', 'one', 'episode', 'part', 'animal', 'sculpture', 'Even', 'theme', 'song', 'hooks', 'recommend', 'cat', 'lovers', 'ages', 'animal', 'lovers', 'general', 'might', 'even', 'win', 'over', 'few', 'who', 'are', 'not-so-sold', 'cats', 'yet.NOTE', 'wrote', 'review', 'DVD', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'According', 'more', 'recent', 'review', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'missing', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'earth', 'something', 'can', 'happen', 'kind', 'carelessness', 'might', 'explain', 'questions', 'have', 'had', 'quality', 'other', 'series', 'have', 'had', 'past', 'event', 'intended', 'purchase', 'series', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'release', ""n't"", 'going', 'happen', 'error', 'corrected']",Must Love Cats

The problem with the DVD release of the first season is that it is missing the sixth and final episode wherein host John Fulton tours the Southeast; he also revisits Dusty the ""Klepto Kitty"" in San Mateo, California.  I recorded all the shows when they originally aired, and I thought one was missing on this DVD, so I double-checked.  This episode is listed in the episode guide on Animal Planet's website and is titled, ""Cat Colleges and Kitty Heroes.""  I don't know why it was left off, but it's a rip-off to leave off an episode, so I'm giving the DVD 4 stars.
