1110332,A28Z84QTQ3ZLF3,B000WMA6I2,a movie fan,"[16, 17]","I skipped this when it came out, not realizing that it contained two of Lincoln Perry's performances, as Stepin Fetchit. Perry was one of the most brilliant comics of his time, and has been unfairly maligned because of a cultural misinterpretation of his great creation, Stepin Fetchit. Perry was thoughtful and articulate, but his Fetchit character, based on someone Perry judged to be the world's laziest man, was a comic exaggeration taken to surreal levels. Basically, Perry, billed as Stepin Fetchit, played the same character in every film. It's a knife-edge gag, however, because it can be taken as a demeaning stereotype of African-Americans or, as Perry intended, a lovable comic foil he could mine for surprising and clever comic bits. It made him an inveterate scene-stealer, acknowledged as such by some of Hollywood's leading actors, and it is remarkable to watch him interact with Will Rogers. Perry said he and Rogers would just get a sense of the script and then cut loose during the take. There are some cringe-inducing moments when that comedy teeters onto the wrong side of the knife (due mostly to the scripts), but Black audiences of the 30s understood the gag and rejected the idea of a stereotype. They could appreciate the comic genius of Perry's exaggerations; the more popular his movies, the more popular he became with live audiences on the Black theater circuit. It's nice to be able to see Perry's performances intact, especially in Judge Priest, one of his most extended roles.Interestingly, Perry was under studio contract, not a rogue comic hired for specific roles, and had mid-level billing (in the cast card, the leads were in large letters, the studio regulars in medium letters, and, lastly, the minor characters in small letters). However, he and Hattie McDaniel, in medium letters, were listed at the end of the cast card - the back of the bus, you might say.It helps a lot to read Mel Watkins biography of Perry, titled STEPIN FETCHIT, to put Perry's work into perspective.",5,Overlooked performances,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,2014,"['skipped', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'not', 'realizing', 'contained', 'two', 'Lincoln', 'Perry', 'performances', 'Stepin', 'Fetchit', 'Perry', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'comics', 'time', 'been', 'unfairly', 'maligned', 'cultural', 'misinterpretation', 'great', 'creation', 'Stepin', 'Fetchit', 'Perry', 'was', 'thoughtful', 'articulate', 'Fetchit', 'character', 'based', 'someone', 'Perry', 'judged', 'be', 'world', 'laziest', 'man', 'was', 'comic', 'exaggeration', 'taken', 'surreal', 'levels', 'Basically', 'Perry', 'billed', 'Stepin', 'Fetchit', 'played', 'same', 'character', 'film', 'knife-edge', 'gag', 'however', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'demeaning', 'stereotype', 'African-Americans', 'Perry', 'intended', 'lovable', 'comic', 'foil', 'could', 'mine', 'surprising', 'clever', 'comic', 'bits', 'made', 'inveterate', 'scene-stealer', 'acknowledged', 'such', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'actors', 'remarkable', 'watch', 'interact', 'Will', 'Rogers', 'Perry', 'said', 'Rogers', 'would', 'just', 'get', 'sense', 'script', 'then', 'cut', 'loose', 'take', 'are', 'cringe-inducing', 'moments', 'when', 'comedy', 'teeters', 'wrong', 'side', 'knife', 'due', 'mostly', 'scripts', 'Black', 'audiences', '30s', 'understood', 'gag', 'rejected', 'idea', 'stereotype', 'could', 'appreciate', 'comic', 'genius', 'Perry', 'exaggerations', 'more', 'popular', 'movies', 'more', 'popular', 'became', 'live', 'audiences', 'Black', 'theater', 'circuit', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Perry', 'performances', 'intact', 'especially', 'Judge', 'Priest', 'one', 'most', 'extended', 'roles.Interestingly', 'Perry', 'was', 'studio', 'contract', 'not', 'rogue', 'comic', 'hired', 'specific', 'roles', 'had', 'mid-level', 'billing', 'cast', 'card', 'leads', 'were', 'large', 'letters', 'studio', 'medium', 'letters', 'lastly', 'minor', 'characters', 'small', 'letters', 'However', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'medium', 'letters', 'were', 'listed', 'end', 'cast', 'card', 'back', 'bus', 'might', 'say.It', 'lot', 'read', 'Mel', 'Watkins', 'biography', 'Perry', 'titled', 'STEPIN', 'FETCHIT', 'put', 'Perry', 'work', 'perspective']",Ford At Fox Collection: (Steamboat Around the Bend / Judge Priest / Doctor Bull / When Willie Comes Marching Home / Up the River / and more)

1110335,A2A2YGCSWWAF13,B000WMA6I2,Classics Collector,"[2, 2]","I'm late to the party on Will Rogers and no authority on his importance to American culture, though with even slight understanding it's evident how unbelievably popular he was in his time.  Aside from the giant shadow he must have cast, 2 of these films, Judge Priest and Dr. Bull are as pure a confluence of John Ford strengths and an actor's gifts (and screenwriter's wit) as there are in the John Ford canon.  Both are fantastic ruminations on times past, even as they were being produced, both romantic and harsh and world weary (The best Ford's are all these).  Will Rogers might be the original method actor.  Though surely he is working from brilliant scripts, his delivery has all the earmarks of being spoken for the first time without self-consciousness, improv must have been a huge component of it, and Ford lets him go.  He is charming, even while trying to be, and that's difficult to pull off.  It just comes to him.It would be difficult also, not to mention Stepin Fetchit .........but one is almost speechless with his characterizations of a no account in Judge Priest.  It might seem sacrilege but you can't take your eyes off him while trying to fathom the depths that he goes to get there.  High art or high camp and unbelievably racist....it's all there.The other films are worthy of mention also.The Cagney piece, What Price Glory, is a great surprise.  Based on a play, set in World War 1 foxholes and bunkers and in color!  Strange and well done, not Ford per se but great Cagney.The others have merit as well, must sees for Ford afficianados and the price is worth Priest & Bull so why not?  Only real problem is that the copy of Up The River is a butchered mess, chunks of it abruptly cut off, it's a shame but they must have done their best with the available print.  They probably shouldn't have included it or at they should have least mentioned it's sorry state it but it's still a lark to see Tracy in his first celluloid.

1110336,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,B000WMA6I2,Donald M. Bishop,"[3, 4]","This early John Ford film starring Will Rogers in the title role is agreeable, satisfying, and entertaining. ""Doc Bull"" is the only physician in a small Connecticut town, on call at all times, beginning to feel his age, and trying hard to keep up with progress in medicine. He is a widower whose friendship with a local widow provides grist for town gossips. A typhoid outbreak tests him and the town.The first reason to watch the film is to see the fine performance by Rogers, amusing at some times, poignant in others.The second reason is to glimpse life in America in the 1930s. Doctors made house calls. Mail came by train. Telephone operators connected every call by hand, and from listening to the conversations knew everything that went on. (In one scene, Rogers has a fine rant against the telephone. It sounds just like our generation cursing the blackberry.)There's a social issue in the film. In the 1930s many Americans still put a great emphasis on a family's ""stock"" (its origins), and the older generation wanted to match young adults only with proper and approved mates of the same religion and class. Dr. Bull has a more liberal view. Perhaps this was one of the movies that helped move America toward its socially more democratic future.-30-",4,DOCTOR BULL:  Will Rogers in an entertaining tale of a small town doctor in the 1930s,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,1259,"['early', 'John', 'Ford', 'film', 'starring', 'Will', 'Rogers', 'title', 'role', 'agreeable', 'satisfying', 'entertaining', 'Doc', 'Bull', 'only', 'physician', 'small', 'Connecticut', 'town', 'call', 'times', 'beginning', 'feel', 'age', 'trying', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'progress', 'medicine', 'widower', 'friendship', 'local', 'widow', 'grist', 'town', 'gossips', 'typhoid', 'outbreak', 'tests', 'town.The', 'first', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'fine', 'performance', 'Rogers', 'amusing', 'times', 'poignant', 'others.The', 'second', 'reason', 'glimpse', 'life', 'America', '1930s', 'Doctors', 'made', 'house', 'calls', 'Mail', 'came', 'train', 'Telephone', 'operators', 'connected', 'call', 'hand', 'listening', 'conversations', 'knew', 'everything', 'went', 'one', 'scene', 'Rogers', 'fine', 'rant', 'telephone', 'just', 'generation', 'cursing', 'blackberry', 'social', 'issue', 'film', '1930s', 'many', 'Americans', 'still', 'put', 'great', 'emphasis', 'family', 'stock', 'origins', 'older', 'generation', 'wanted', 'match', 'young', 'adults', 'only', 'proper', 'approved', 'mates', 'same', 'religion', 'class', 'Dr.', 'Bull', 'more', 'liberal', 'view', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'helped', 'move', 'America', 'socially', 'more', 'democratic', 'future.-30-']",Ford At Fox Collection: (Steamboat Around the Bend / Judge Priest / Doctor Bull / When Willie Comes Marching Home / Up the River / and more)
