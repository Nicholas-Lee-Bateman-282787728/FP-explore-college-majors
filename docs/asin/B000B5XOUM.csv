936104,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B000B5XOUM,M. Fields,"[9, 36]","This show is basic formula stuff for the 60's.  Kids get into trouble, get a lecture from the parents and hopefully learn a lesson in the end.  That's the way most of these family shows were written in the 50's and 60's.  Most family sitcoms are still written this way but the difference is that the kids these days are smart-mouthed, back talking to their parents, wise cracking delinquents while he parents are made to look stupid and ineffectual.The Brady bunch has a certain charm all it's own.  It was somewhat patterned after Please Don't Eat The Daisies.  Anyone remember that show or am I just dating myself?  The Brady Bunch really wasn't all that funny but I watched it anyway.  As an African American child growing up in the 60s there wasn't much else to watch.  We watched this show even though there weren't any little black children on it.  Okay, so they stuck a couple of extras in every now and then but you know what I mean.  Even as I child I didn't find the show that amusing but it was still something to watch.  I bet you most African Americans won't admit to watching it.  Do I still watch it?  Yes.  I admit it.  The innocence of it still appeals to me.  The kids don't talk back to their parents.  They have to share one t.v. set (yikes!) and the family actually eats dinner at the dining room table.The kids clothes are often made fun of now but they weren't as bad as all that.  They wore 60s clothes but the outfits weren't mismatched as some of the comedy shows portray now.  I do think Cindy's dresses were much too short even for a kid her age.It was also very apparent to me (even when I was a child) that this group of people really liked each other and for the most part got along very well.  Robert Reed especially loved his on screen children and treated them very well.  He used to take the kids on trips and vacations.  He was estranged from his own daughter which caused him a great deal of pain.  Although now a lot of people feel that this show was a waste of Robert Reed's time because he went on to do some very memorable things after The Brady Bunch.  He was a very talented actor.  You may remember him from roots as one of the slave owners.  He even felt it was beneath him from time to time but it was work just the same.  Any way, when a cast gets along well and really likes each other it seems to come through on screen.  So even though I don't think The Bradys are very funny there are many elements of the show that appealed to me back then and still do.  I remain fond of it to this day.There's just one thing I have to admit here and now.  I've always hated Cindy.  I still do.

936110,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000B5XOUM,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[7, 10]","Even though the Brady Bunch began in the 1960's, the show is commonly referred as 70's pop culture. This one season contains so many classic episodes which demonstrate why the `Bunch' and the disco era became forever entwined in pop culture history. If you have to buy one season of the Bunch, this is it!The Brady Bunch launches the 23-episode 1972-1973 season with an awesome 3-part Hawaii trip. Mike's construction firm is building a property in this (then-still-relatively young) state so he gets permission to take the entire family along on the business trip.  The Brady Bunch often gets faulted for being `too nice' but I've got to give this three-parter props; the Brady girls independently figure out what to do after their brothers are kidnapped by an evil archeologist wanting an ancient taboo idol found by Bobby. These are the episodes which really do keep you in suspense. I'm thinking the fact that the young actors actually got to run around Hawaii also contributed to their stellar on-screen performances in the episodes.Another good episode is ""Today I am a freshman"". Eager to fit in at high school after she was the undisputed queen of junior high, Marcia literally joins every club which she gets contact information for. Marcia thinks that she is following the `get involved' advice which her parents gave, but doesn't realize that she had overlooked the importance of balancing schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Wearing herself out, it then becomes impossible for Marcia to maintain good high school grades-something which both she and her parents also expect. The Brady Bunch is often criticized for having `unrealistic plotlines', but this episode remains universally relatable to people who are entering high school and thus adjusting to their new surroundings.Now older, Bobby (Mike Lookinland) and Cindy (Susan Olsen) receive more independent time in this season. They are no longer only reacting to and commenting on their older family members. Their wanting to fit in-and sub sequentially get along with the rest of the family is explored throughout several episodes.In ""Law and disorder"" Bobby is upset after being given the `dorky' position of ""safety monitor"" until Carol and Mike convince him that it is an important job. Success then goes to Bobby's head while he attempts to `protect' his family from every safety infraction possible, becoming a LARGE pain in the process.  Bobby also learns the truth about his idol in ""Bobby's hero"". Exasperated with Bobby's idolization of Jesse James, the principal then calls Mike and Carol in for a conference. Subsequently, they introduce Bobby to descendants of the people whom Jesse James hurt. Bobby's natural empathy for people consequently makes him think what if his family had been hurt by Jesse James. His `idol' subsequently is eliminated.Of course, Cindy has growing experiences of her own. In ""you can't win them all"" she becomes a prima-donna after winning a commercial spot. The rest of the family likes Cindy but is unwilling to spoil her just because she is appearing on TV. They believe that their own lives are just as important. I really wish that modern `family' shows would study this season to understand the very critical difference between youth acting and cloying.However, The Brady Bunch's oft-mythologized `hokeyness' gets shown throughout ""The show must go on"". Both parents and kids are genuinely enthusiastic about participating together in the school talent show. The Brady Bunch then debuts as a singing group in ""Amateur nite"", because the kids want to buy a silver plate for Mike and Carol's wedding anniversary and can get necessary money through appearing on a talent show. Although most parents would have been happier with a gift period, this episode also launched the Brady Kids into a quasi-real singing group off-camera. In addition to filming the series, the kids also would sing around the country.Other famous episodes include ""The subject was noses"" (the `football to Marcia's nose'episode), ""A room at the top"" (Greg ultimately creates his `pad' in the attic after a fight with), ""Career fever"" (Circumstantial evidence convinces Mike that Greg wants to follow in his footsteps and also become an architect), and ""Love and the older man"" (when Marcia learns that Stanely Vogel, the `groovy' new dentist whom she has a crush on, only wants her as a babysitter while he and his wife go out).The one episode which cannot translate well at all is ""You're never too old"". Mike and Carol Brady actually fix up their parents with each other, seemingly oblivious of the legal or at least cultural restrictions on their arrangement. Since Mike and Carol Brady are married to each other, why on earth are they trying to get their own parents romantically together? I just can't think of a reason why this episode was created during the era of heavy `family show' policing, unless somebody at the production studio and/or network fell asleep on their script review job. This plot just does not make any sense. However, this same episode CAN be used today to show people that `the good old days' also had questionable `family' content on television.I also noticed the credits glitch at the end of ""Love and the older man"". I thought it was just my player and or DVD copy.Overall however, this is a good season, perhaps best of the entire series. The sheer volume of `famous episodes' in this one collection means that this is THE season which both devoted and informal Brady fans MUST purchase for their DVD libraries.  If you're on a budget or live in a world where only one Brady Bunch DVD can be purchased, this is the season for you.",5,Say 'aloha' to the 'Bunch' with season 4,1131062400,"11 4,

936114,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000B5XOUM,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[2, 2]","Season four of ""The Brady Bunch"" is highly regarded as the greatest season of the series by Brady enthusiasts. The writing was impeccable with the creative team knowing each character and the stories were involving and inspired. This set features all 23 episodes uncut that originally aired on ABC in the 1972-1973 TV season. The opener that year is the most popular Brady episode, which is a three parter, that has the Bradys vacationing in beautiful Hawaii. None other than horror movie actor Vincent Price guest-stars and the family finds themselves embroiled in vodoo, curses, poison spiders, caves, surfing, and Don Ho. Another great episode is the ""unofficial"" Halloween episode titled ""Fright Night"". The kids try to scare each other, but Alice is the one who ends up horrified. I watch this show every October 31st! ""Goodbye, Alice, Hello"" is a sad episode as Alice leaves the Bradys after a series of misunderstandings between her and the children. ""Amateur Night"" has the Brady kids singing on TV and this episode is known for the song ""It's A Sunshine Day"". Finally, ""The Subject Was Noses"" has Marcia being hit in the nose by a football. A wonderful season that will be enjoyed by many generations to come!",5,"""The Best Season of ""The Brady Bunch""""",1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,1218,"['Season', 'four', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'highly', 'regarded', 'greatest', 'season', 'series', 'Brady', 'enthusiasts', 'writing', 'was', 'impeccable', 'creative', 'team', 'knowing', 'character', 'stories', 'were', 'involving', 'inspired', 'set', '23', 'episodes', 'uncut', 'originally', 'aired', 'ABC', '1972-1973', 'TV', 'season', 'opener', 'year', 'most', 'popular', 'Brady', 'episode', 'three', 'parter', 'Bradys', 'vacationing', 'beautiful', 'Hawaii', 'None', 'other', 'horror', 'movie', 'actor', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'guest-stars', 'family', 'embroiled', 'vodoo', 'curses', 'poison', 'spiders', 'caves', 'surfing', 'Don', 'Ho', 'great', 'episode', 'unofficial', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'titled', 'Fright', 'Night', 'kids', 'try', 'scare', 'other', 'Alice', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'horrified', 'watch', 'show', 'October', '31st', 'Goodbye', 'Alice', 'Hello', 'sad', 'episode', 'Alice', 'Bradys', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'children', 'Amateur', 'Night', 'Brady', 'kids', 'singing', 'TV', 'episode', 'known', 'song', 'Sunshine', 'Day', 'Finally', 'Subject', 'Was', 'Noses', 'Marcia', 'being', 'hit', 'nose', 'football', 'wonderful', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'generations', 'come']",N/A

936116,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B000B5XOUM,The Groove,"[10, 11]","In my opinion, the fourth season (1972-73) of the Brady Bunch is the best and most fun of the entire series.  It has the most memorable episodes and the most quotable lines.  I won't bother summarizing the Hawaii episodes, as many of us are already familiar with them.  Instead, I'll comment on only a handful of the episodes that stand out the best.TODAY I AM A FRESHMANMarcia (Maureen McCormick) gets the jitters on her first day of high school and she tries way too hard to make a good first impression on her classmates.  She then signs up for every school club available and makes a total fool of herself.JAN, THE ONLY CHILDPoor Jan (Eve Plumb).  Every season, she has something to whine about.  First, there was middle child syndrome.  Then, she found herself competing with Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  Now, she complains that she has no privacy living with 2 sisters and 3 brothers.  So the rest of the Brady kids alienate Jan by staying far out of her way.GOODBYE, ALICE, HELLOHousekeeper Alice (Ann B. Davis) begins to piss off the Brady kids by inadvertently snitching on them (Marcia left the stereo on and Peter broke Mom's lamp).  Convinced that she's on a mission to get them into trouble, the Brady kids give Alice the cold shoulder, and she ends up quitting.GREG GETS GROUNDEDBobby (Mike Lookinland) puts Greg (Barry Williams) in the hot seat by telling his parents that he almost got them into a car accident.  Mike (Robert Reed) almost throws a fit and bans Greg from driving for a week.  This is problematic, as Greg already has a date lined up with Rachel.BOBBY'S HEROApparently, Bobby has bad taste in picking his heroes.  When his principal tells his parents that he wrote a gleaming essay on Jesse James, Mike and Carol (Florence Henderson) get concerned to say the least.THE SUBJECT WAS NOSESHere's a favorite of mine.  Marcia breaks her date with Charlie to go out with Doug, the big man on campus.  Later that afternoon, she gets whacked in the face by a stray football (""Oh, my nose!""), putting her date with Doug in serious jeopardy.HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESSPeter (Christopher Knight) learns a valuable lesson that, sometimes, trying too hard on the job can get you fired.  He gets a job as a mechanic at Martinelli's bike shop, but when his slow pace hurts business, Mr. Martinelli has no choice but to let Peter go.  Peter is too ashamed to tell his parents the bad news, but the truth eventually emerges.ROOM AT THE TOPLet the battle of the sexes continue!  When Carol and Alice clean out the attic, both Greg and Marcia fight over who gets to move into it.These episodes are spread over 4 DVDs, none of which have any bonus features.  The picture quality varies, and the sound is in mono.  Regardless, fans of the beloved TV series would be foolish to pass up on this DVD, which is a must-own for any Bradyholic.",4,"""Oh, My Nose!""",1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,2842,"['opinion', 'fourth', 'season', '1972-73', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'best', 'most', 'fun', 'entire', 'series', 'most', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'most', 'quotable', 'lines', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'summarizing', 'Hawaii', 'episodes', 'many', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'Instead', ""'ll"", 'comment', 'only', 'handful', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'best.TODAY', 'AM', 'FRESHMANMarcia', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'jitters', 'first', 'day', 'high', 'school', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'good', 'first', 'impression', 'classmates', 'then', 'signs', 'up', 'school', 'club', 'available', 'total', 'fool', 'herself.JAN', 'THE', 'ONLY', 'CHILDPoor', 'Jan', 'Eve', 'Plumb', 'season', 'something', 'whine', 'First', 'was', 'middle', 'child', 'syndrome', 'Then', 'found', 'competing', 'Marcia', 'Marcia', 'Marcia', 'Now', 'privacy', 'living', '2', 'sisters', '3', 'brothers', 'rest', 'Brady', 'kids', 'alienate', 'Jan', 'staying', 'far', 'way.GOODBYE', 'ALICE', 'HELLOHousekeeper', 'Alice', 'Ann', 'B.', 'Davis', 'piss', 'off', 'Brady', 'kids', 'inadvertently', 'snitching', 'Marcia', 'left', 'stereo', 'Peter', 'broke', 'Mom', 'lamp', 'Convinced', 'mission', 'get', 'trouble', 'Brady', 'kids', 'give', 'Alice', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'up', 'quitting.GREG', 'GETS', 'GROUNDEDBobby', 'Mike', 'Lookinland', 'Greg', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'hot', 'seat', 'telling', 'parents', 'almost', 'got', 'car', 'accident', 'Mike', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'almost', 'fit', 'bans', 'Greg', 'driving', 'week', 'problematic', 'Greg', 'already', 'date', 'lined', 'up', 'Rachel.BOBBY', 'HEROApparently', 'Bobby', 'bad', 'taste', 'picking', 'heroes', 'When', 'principal', 'parents', 'wrote', 'gleaming', 'essay', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Mike', 'Carol', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'get', 'concerned', 'say', 'least.THE', 'SUBJECT', 'WAS', 'NOSESHere', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Marcia', 'date', 'Charlie', 'go', 'out', 'Doug', 'big', 'man', 'campus', 'Later', 'afternoon', 'whacked', 'face', 'stray', 'football', 'Oh', 'nose', 'putting', 'date', 'Doug', 'serious', 'jeopardy.HOW', 'TO', 'SUCCEED', 'IN', 'BUSINESSPeter', 'Christopher', 'Knight', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'sometimes', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'job', 'can', 'get', 'fired', 'job', 'mechanic', 'Martinelli', 'bike', 'shop', 'when', 'slow', 'pace', 'business', 'Mr.', 'Martinelli', 'choice', 'let', 'Peter', 'go', 'Peter', 'too', 'ashamed', 'tell', 'parents', 'bad', 'news', 'truth', 'eventually', 'AT', 'THE', 'TOPLet', 'battle', 'sexes', 'continue', 'When', 'Carol', 'Alice', 'clean', 'out', 'attic', 'Greg', 'Marcia', 'fight', 'who', 'move', 'it.These', 'episodes', 'are', 'spread', '4', 'DVDs', 'none', 'have', 'bonus', 'features', 'picture', 'quality', 'varies', 'sound', 'mono', 'Regardless', 'fans', 'beloved', 'TV', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'pass', 'up', 'DVD', 'must-own', 'Bradyholic']",N/A
