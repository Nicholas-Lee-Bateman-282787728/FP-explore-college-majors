DeMille were alive today and had the advantages of modern technology and audience changes, would his rendition be unlike this movie in 2006?'  I have to answer, 'Yes, partly--but mainly, no.'  The celestial scenes are done with a modern grandeur, but the ordinary people with their ordinary circumstances would have been left out, so director Catherine Hardwicke and writer Mike Rich really get it right.  There are a lot of interpretational scenes that interweve throughout the bible's text, but the inspiration and guesswork are effective enough.  Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary, Oscar Isaac as Joseph, fit the bill, and the very fact that we have mainly little-known actors only accentuates those human, mundane moments that are interrupted by very extraordinary events. Occasionally, however, the lesser talents don't live up to most actors in major releases, but even here we have a better offering than in the old days.  Certainly, they try to emulate the Christmas story on the foot of 'The Passion of Christ,' but instead of having more than a few pieces spoken in Hebrew, they have accents, and this is sufficient.  The editing wisely doesn't linger too long on any one scene.  They also embellish history and culture to make the film a flesh and blood account.  (Who could disagree with the troubles the couple has crossing a river, fleeing on their way to Egypt?)  The scenes take three focuses:  There's Mary and Joseph and some of the guesswork that goes along with their families' reactions.  Then, there's the three wisemen and the development of prophecy.  (There are even some funny moments amongst them.  It could have seemed irreverent or clumsy--like 'The Three Stooges,' but they know how to strike the right chord.  Life is funny, afterall, so why not in the details of 'The Nativity's development?)  Effectively, the movie continually returns to the menace of the Roman soldiers, which provides a tangible tension that is realized in the movie and the story.  Similarly, work, circumcision, Hebrew prayer, and tangibly painful birth scenes increase the movie's feel and authenticity.'The Nativity Story' has the overall ingredients to provide a believable film with flesh and blood characters that bring the Nativity scene to life.",4,Traditional/Authentic/Beautiful 'Nativity',1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,2369,"['are', 'elements', ""'The"", 'Nativity', 'Story', 'are', 'so', 'old-fashioned', 'found', 'asking', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'had', 'advantages', 'modern', 'technology', 'audience', 'changes', 'would', 'rendition', 'be', 'movie', '2006', 'have', 'answer', ""'Yes"", 'partly', 'mainly', 'celestial', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'modern', 'grandeur', 'ordinary', 'people', 'ordinary', 'circumstances', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'so', 'director', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'writer', 'Mike', 'Rich', 'really', 'get', 'right', 'are', 'lot', 'interpretational', 'scenes', 'interweve', 'bible', 'text', 'inspiration', 'guesswork', 'are', 'effective', 'enough', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'Mary', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Joseph', 'fit', 'bill', 'very', 'fact', 'have', 'mainly', 'little-known', 'actors', 'only', 'human', 'mundane', 'moments', 'are', 'interrupted', 'very', 'extraordinary', 'events', 'Occasionally', 'however', 'lesser', 'talents', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'most', 'actors', 'major', 'releases', 'even', 'here', 'have', 'better', 'offering', 'old', 'days', 'Certainly', 'try', 'emulate', 'Christmas', 'story', 'foot', ""'The"", 'Passion', 'Christ', 'instead', 'having', 'more', 'few', 'pieces', 'spoken', 'Hebrew', 'have', 'accents', 'sufficient', 'editing', 'wisely', ""n't"", 'linger', 'too', 'long', 'one', 'scene', 'also', 'embellish', 'history', 'culture', 'make', 'film', 'flesh', 'blood', 'account', 'Who', 'could', 'disagree', 'troubles', 'couple', 'crossing', 'river', 'fleeing', 'way', 'Egypt', 'scenes', 'take', 'three', 'focuses', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'guesswork', 'along', 'families', 'reactions', 'Then', 'three', 'wisemen', 'development', 'prophecy', 'are', 'even', 'funny', 'moments', 'amongst', 'could', 'have', 'seemed', 'irreverent', 'clumsy', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'know', 'how', 'strike', 'right', 'chord', 'Life', 'funny', 'afterall', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'details', ""'The"", 'Nativity', 'development', 'Effectively', 'movie', 'continually', 'menace', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'tangible', 'tension', 'realized', 'movie', 'story', 'Similarly', 'work', 'circumcision', 'Hebrew', 'prayer', 'tangibly', 'painful', 'birth', 'scenes', 'increase', 'movie', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'overall', 'ingredients', 'provide', 'believable', 'film', 'flesh', 'blood', 'characters', 'bring', 'Nativity', 'scene', 'life']",N/A

This really told the part of the story from Mary and Joseph's point of view and what all they went through. The people from their community really admired Joseph because he was a good man and hard worker. As for Mary all the children really loved and looked up to Mary. Mary and Joseph were to be wed. When Mary went and visited her sister an angel came to her with the news that she would have the son of GOD. When Mary returned pregant before her and Joseph were married everyone looked down on her. Joseph was disappointed, but unlike everyone else believed her when she told him of the angel. Joseph stood by her side and protected her. When the King ordered everyone to go back to their homeland to pay taxes and get a census of the people Joseph and Mary went on their way to Nazereth. The King had also ordered to kill all of the young boys under the age of 2. The guards looked past Mary even though she was actually the one carrying the Baby of all Kings, the baby the King wanted dead. When the soldiers heard about Mary and the birth of her child from the three traveling Kings the soldiers went to find Mary and her baby. When they arrived they had already fleed the barn where Baby Jesus was born! This was a very well made movie with great actors and actresses.

Mainly, that they fleshed out Joseph's character.  In the bible, you hear from the angel Gabriel, Mary, Herod, and many others key characters involved with the story, but Joseph never says a recorded word.  How he must of felt in those days, betrayed and humiliated that a woman of virtue he had chosen for his wife was suddenly with child.  Many believe him to be truly a marginal player, but he had such a strong faith that many people wish that they had today.  This film shows how both Mary and Joseph came to terms with what was happening to both of them, and it also showed their fears of what was to come.  Joseph protected Mary from harm, he traveled with her to Bethlehem and protected both her and her unborn child, and then onto Egypt before Herod's attack. I think Joseph was the original model for the strong, silent type.  I am sure Joseph had dreams and goals of his own, but he had to put them aside.  He overcame anger and frustration to become the step-father of the Christ child.

Lukewarm reviews kept me from rushing out to catch the movie in the theater. I was able to watch in in the comfort of my own home with my family and we thoroughly enjoyed it.Not being a biblical scholar, I can't tell you if this followed the gospels perfectly, but the story presented in the movie is quite faithful to the birth of Jesus presented in the Bible. The sets are realistic and the cast is solid, if a bit somber, Keisha Castle-Hughes is great as Mary. In the opening, she's a young teenager having fun with her friends. When Joseph chooses her hand in marriage, Mary is depressed. Joseph is a nice man and she respects him, but the prospects of an arranged marriage don't thrill her. Then Mary receives the vision of the angel telling her she will give birth to a child. From this point on, Mary looses the fun innocence she had and seems to carry the weight on the world on her shoulders the rest of the movie. The relationship between Mary and Joseph could have had a few lighter moments. I'm sure they weren't depressed all the time.The somber mood of the movie was unable to hold the interest of my kids, but my wife and I were enthralled by the story. Everything is there, the trip to Bethlehem, the shepards, the wisemen, and King Herrod, who is threatened by the coming Messiah.This movie is a really good movie portraying the birth of Jesus Christ.

Erland,"[2, 2]","'The Nativity Story' is a reverent, straight forward presentation chronicling the events leading up to and shortly after the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. The problem with making a movie about such a universally known tale is that it's almost impossible to create any level of excitement or anticipation, everyone knows exactly where the storyline is heading and what's going to happen along the way. How then do you stimulate interest and focus from the audience? You treat a classic tale in a classic manner. Remain true to the original text, make certain the character portrayals are believable yet iconic and stir the senses with breathtaking Middle East scenery and an inspiring, heartfelt soundtrack. And one more thing, develop some small element in the story that the audience hasn't seen in other films covering the Biblical account. You know, something that allows the movie to make a unique impression on the viewer and thus stand out from other versions.In my opinion 'The Nativity Story' followed all the points mentioned above to near perfection. I was especially impressed by Oscar Isaac in the role of Joseph the carpenter. Joseph is generally an all but forgotten character in the nativity narrative while all the focus is on Mary. In this film you finally get a glimpse of the real Joseph, a man of deep faith, honesty, honor and commitment. Oscar Isaac delivers a fully developed Joseph, a man you can respect and understand why he was chosen by God in the same way Mary was. His superb portrayal stands out in my mind as the one of those stand out elements that set this film apart from others dealing with the same subject matter. Another important element was the extended time spent on examining the personalities and motives of the three wise men. There interaction with each other was not only a refreshing addition but added an unexpected comical element.

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[6, 7]","You can't go wrong with buying this DVD because you get BOTH the FULL screen AND the WIDESCREEN versions! Even though there are no other Bonus Features (no Director's Commentary, no Deleted Scenes, etc.), I think getting BOTH screen versions for the price of one DVD is an incredible Bonus Feature!The movie is not perfect, it is a little slow at times, but can you name a better film about the birth of Jesus Christ? I can't even think of another DVD movie that is entirely about the birth of Jesus, though many might include it as part of Christ's overall life story.The film is VERY accurate to the Bible, especially when compared to any other Bible films from standard, non-religious movie studios! Some Bible students might nitpick about certain Bible verses not being quoted verbatim, or incompletely, but I am just very pleased by how much the filmmakers got RIGHT compared to the Bible passages! They show village children learning Old Testament Nursery rhymes, and they do nothing major to contradict the Bible story, and the best thing is that there are NO subplots that distract from the Bible story, everything fills-in the story better.Half of this movie is straight out of Scripture, and the rest is thoughtfully filled in, IN CHARACTER, with terrific costumes, sets and scenery! The filmmakers paid great attention to Bible research, too, concerning customs and daily living routines for all of the characters, too!Joseph steals the show as Mary's humble suitor, yet he is also very resourceful and responsible. The film starts out with his unrequited love for Mary, especially after Mary's dad arranges their marriage without Mary's input, but Joseph eventually wins her over (and the audience, as well).King Herod and his slimy Son are perfect, classic movie villains! It is very interesting the way the writers spread their influence throughout the film, for dramatic tension. Well done!The Three Wise Men are pretty funny and provide some humor sprinkled throughout the movie.Mary is perhaps the film's greatest weakness, as played by Keisha Castle-Hughes. She is too quiet, serious, and reserved throughout most of the film. I guess it is better than her playing Mary as too loud and irreverent, but she is in most of the scenes and is usually just solemnly observing everybody else.The off camera media gossip about the irony of this teenage actress portraying Mary, while getting pregnant by her teenage boyfriend outside of marriage, before the film was released, seemed to get around the mainstream media more than any other normal mention of this movie, and may have contributed to the films lackluster box office revenue at the theaters among Christian moviegoers who didn't appreciate the connection. I think THE NATIVITY STORY will eventually become a holiday classic, though. Films like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE were disappointing when first released, but eventually become classics later.The official book, THE NATIVITY STORY -- A NOVEL by Angela Hunt and Mike Rich, is also recommended by me because it fills in tons more information about the customs and daily living routines of the characters! THE NATIVITY STORY -- THE GIFT BOOK is not so good, once you own the DVD, because there is not much text per page, and mostly just some photos shot on the set, but nothing that you don't already see while watching the film, it doesn't give you much more for the money.",5,"Overlooked Classic Film, Best Movie Ever About the Birth of Jesus!",1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,3393,"['ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'buying', 'DVD', 'get', 'FULL', 'screen', 'WIDESCREEN', 'versions', 'Even', 'are', 'other', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'etc', 'think', 'getting', 'BOTH', 'screen', 'versions', 'price', 'one', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'Bonus', 'Feature', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'can', 'name', 'better', 'film', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'DVD', 'movie', 'entirely', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'though', 'many', 'might', 'include', 'part', 'Christ', 'overall', 'life', 'story.The', 'film', 'VERY', 'accurate', 'Bible', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'Bible', 'films', 'standard', 'non-religious', 'movie', 'studios', 'Bible', 'students', 'might', 'nitpick', 'certain', 'Bible', 'verses', 'not', 'being', 'quoted', 'verbatim', 'incompletely', 'am', 'just', 'very', 'pleased', 'how', 'much', 'filmmakers', 'got', 'RIGHT', 'compared', 'Bible', 'passages', 'show', 'village', 'children', 'learning', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Nursery', 'do', 'nothing', 'major', 'contradict', 'Bible', 'story', 'best', 'thing', 'are', 'NO', 'subplots', 'distract', 'Bible', 'story', 'everything', 'fills-in', 'story', 'better.Half', 'movie', 'straight', 'Scripture', 'rest', 'thoughtfully', 'filled', 'IN', 'CHARACTER', 'terrific', 'costumes', 'sets', 'scenery', 'filmmakers', 'paid', 'great', 'attention', 'Bible', 'research', 'too', 'concerning', 'customs', 'daily', 'living', 'routines', 'characters', 'too', 'Joseph', 'show', 'Mary', 'humble', 'suitor', 'also', 'very', 'resourceful', 'responsible', 'film', 'out', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Mary', 'especially', 'Mary', 'dad', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'input', 'Joseph', 'eventually', 'over', 'audience', 'well', '.King', 'Herod', 'slimy', 'Son', 'are', 'perfect', 'classic', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'way', 'writers', 'spread', 'influence', 'film', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Well', 'done', 'Three', 'Wise', 'Men', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'provide', 'humor', 'sprinkled', 'movie.Mary', 'perhaps', 'film', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'played', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'too', 'quiet', 'serious', 'reserved', 'most', 'film', 'guess', 'better', 'playing', 'Mary', 'too', 'loud', 'irreverent', 'most', 'scenes', 'usually', 'just', 'solemnly', 'observing', 'everybody', 'camera', 'media', 'gossip', 'irony', 'teenage', 'actress', 'portraying', 'Mary', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'teenage', 'boyfriend', 'marriage', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'seemed', 'get', 'mainstream', 'media', 'more', 'other', 'normal', 'mention', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'contributed', 'films', 'lackluster', 'box', 'office', 'revenue', 'theaters', 'Christian', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'connection', 'think', 'NATIVITY', 'STORY', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'holiday', 'classic', 'though', 'Films', 'IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', 'were', 'disappointing', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'eventually', 'become', 'classics', 'later.The', 'official', 'book', 'THE', 'NATIVITY', 'STORY', 'NOVEL', 'Angela', 'Hunt', 'Mike', 'Rich', 'also', 'recommended', 'tons', 'more', 'information', 'customs', 'daily', 'living', 'routines', 'characters', 'NATIVITY', 'STORY', 'GIFT', 'BOOK', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'once', 'own', 'DVD', 'not', 'much', 'page', 'mostly', 'just', 'photos', 'shot', 'set', 'nothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'see', 'watching', 'film', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'more', 'money']",N/A

It then switches to a year earlier in the village of Nazareth where Mary and Joseph playfully flirt.  Mary and Joseph later marry but cannot consummate their marriage.  The law states that she must remain pure for one year.  She questions why her father forced her to marry Joseph since she barely knew him and didn&#8217;t love him.  Her mother explains that her father didn&#8217;t because he loved her and that Joseph could give her a better life.  Mary visits her cousin and returns pregnant.  Her mother is worried she would be stoned in the streets and Mary vows to her father that she has broken no vow.  An Angel visits Joseph in a dream and tells him of Mary&#8217;s Immaculate Conception. Joseph must return to Bethlehem for the census that King Herod ordered.  Mary travels with him and ends up giving birth to Jesus in a manger in Bethlehem with Joseph by her side. The baby is wrapped in cloth and laid in a manger. The shepherds in the field, seeing the light from the star, come to pay respects to the newborn king. The wise men also arrive, and bring gifts for the baby. The wise men then leave, and on their way back decide to travel around Jerusalem and defy Herod's order to return with a report. The movie ends with Mary and Joseph leaving the manger right before the Roman soldiers arrive to execute all male babies under two. They see the empty manger, and then ride off. Joseph and Mary flee with Jesus to Egypt.The Nativity Story is found in the Gospels of both Matthew and Luke but I will concentrate on the Gospel of Luke.  There have been questions on the approximate time on when Luke wrote about the nativity.  Was it written fifty years after Christ and what is the significance of this?  In reality the closer the writings are to the actual events, than the more likely they are to be true.  Fifty years after Christ just happens to be the exact time when the apocryphal gospels begin to appear. Therefore, Luke&#8217;s nativity narrative, even if written about fifty years after Christ, is well within two generations.Even though there are differences in secondary details, there is a historically reliable core that is common to both Gospels. The Virgin Mary is told by an angel that she will conceive by the Holy Spirit. Mary is told to name the boy Jesus. Baby Jesus is born in Bethlehem, and after a short time, they return to Nazareth.  Ironically, the differences in the secondary details between the two Nativity stories can be viewed as positive evidence for the story&#8217;s authenticity. They reveal that we have two independent narrators recording different aspects of the same great event.Did the census that brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem actually exist?

It then continues by moving back one year to the events that led to the murder of innocent children. At the Holy Temple of Jerusalem, Zachariah is told by God that his wife Elizabeth would bear his son and that he would be named John, which comes as a shock to him. Shortly after in Nazareth, after given away by his father to marry Joseph of Judea, Mary is spoken to by God and told that she will conceive and give birth to an offspring whose name shall be Jesus. Mary then goes to stay with her cousin Elizabeth for the harvest and decides to return home right after witnessing the birth of John. Upon her return to Nazareth, her pregnancy leaves everyone in shock. Neither her parents or Joseph can believe that the child Mary is expecting is from God. That is until Joseph is visited by an angel in a dream and no longer doubts Mary. During this time, a census is put into effect in which everyone must return to their place of birth. As a result, Joseph takes Mary and both make their strenuous journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Mary will give birth to baby Jesus. As Mary  is giving birth, a great star is seen in the sky by the three Magi, Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthazar. They immediately show up at the stable and shower the newborn with gifts. The three Magi had previously visited Herod and were asked to report the newborn's location back to him but they never did, which caused Herod to demand the murder of every young boy under two years of age in Bethlehem.

1044946,AB34G6VKP28L,B000MCIC24,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[1, 1]","One of the most beloved stories in scripture is how Jesus came into being, through the spoken word of God and two extremely young, willing people to serve His will. It was a time of great tribulation in Judea. This is the first attempt that has been made to make a big-budget film about Mary and Joseph, and the miraculous baby born beneath a triumphant star. Overall, it is excellent, but individually, the characters needed more depth.Judea lies beneath the heavy hand of Rome, through the leadership of King Herod (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), who is more concerned for his own well-being than that of his people. It has come time for the annual taxes and many families in the area do not have enough to pay their debt. Children, donkeys, and property are forfeit, among them the only pack animal owned by Mary's father. Young and naive of the world, Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) spends her hours working hard in the family business and selling bread to the older, wealthier widows of the district. Joseph, (Oscar Isaac) the local carpenter, has fallen in love with her, and asks for her hand in marriage. It is given. Mary is uncertain of the engagement. Then comes a messenger of God (Alexander Siddig) to tell her that she will bear the child of God, and future savior of her people.Frightened but willing to serve her heavenly father, Mary agrees. Frightened for what it is to come, and the shunning she will receive from family and friends, she journeys to the house of her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) who, miraculously, is carrying a child in her own age. Her husband Zechariah (Stanley Townsend) is very understanding toward Mary's plight, an emotion not shared by her family when she returns six months pregnant. In the meantime, three wise men from the East have been studying various prophecies and astronomy and believe that soon three planets will align, creating the illusion of a powerful star over Judea, and signifying the coming of the messiah. From there, the story follows the biblical account. It's one of the better-produced films I have seen, with a slew of decent actors and careful thought and preparation to its outline.I know a great deal about the culture and time and for the most part the screenplay paints a realistic view of life during that time, including the brutality of the Roman soldiers and the egocentric traits of Herod. It introduces his self-serving son in a minor role (the Herod who would be alive during Christ's crucifixion) and pays careful attention to scripture as it unfolds the story. In that respect, it's very worthwhile. However, there is one crucial ingredient missing: Passion. Enthusiasm. Emotion. The Jews were an emotional culture, but none of that bleeds through, particularly in Mary. The one central force from which the story evolves, Mary is stoic to the point of being boring. She should have been the most likable, interesting character, but instead seems a banal presence around which other characters revolve. I don't know if it's Keisha's fault for not being enthusiastic about the role, the fact that the script doesn't give her much to work with, or poor directing, but she shows nothing ... not when the angel comes to her, or when she awakens in the night, or even when Joseph tells her he will take the baby as his own and be bound to her in marriage, even at the sake of being shunned right along with her. The most she cracks is a smile, where I expected abundant gratitude, even tears of joy.This is all the more sad, because the other characters are fabulous. You get a sense of evil from Herod, the wise men are appropriately humorous, and Joseph is awesome! Mild-mannered but strong, caring to the point of giving his last share of bread to the family donkey, and frightened when helping Mary deliver her child. I wanted more from it than it offered me, but at least it is a story worth telling.",3,Slightly Disappointing,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3880,"['One', 'most', 'beloved', 'stories', 'scripture', 'how', 'Jesus', 'came', 'being', 'spoken', 'word', 'God', 'two', 'extremely', 'young', 'willing', 'people', 'serve', 'will', 'was', 'time', 'great', 'tribulation', 'Judea', 'first', 'attempt', 'been', 'made', 'make', 'big-budget', 'film', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'miraculous', 'baby', 'born', 'triumphant', 'star', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'individually', 'characters', 'needed', 'more', 'depth.Judea', 'heavy', 'hand', 'Rome', 'leadership', 'King', 'Herod', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'own', 'well-being', 'people', 'come', 'time', 'annual', 'taxes', 'many', 'families', 'area', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'pay', 'debt', 'Children', 'donkeys', 'property', 'are', 'forfeit', 'only', 'pack', 'animal', 'owned', 'Mary', 'father', 'Young', 'naive', 'world', 'Mary', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'hours', 'working', 'hard', 'family', 'business', 'selling', 'bread', 'older', 'wealthier', 'widows', 'district', 'Joseph', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'local', 'carpenter', 'fallen', 'love', 'hand', 'marriage', 'given', 'Mary', 'uncertain', 'engagement', 'Then', 'messenger', 'God', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'tell', 'will', 'bear', 'child', 'God', 'future', 'savior', 'people.Frightened', 'willing', 'serve', 'heavenly', 'father', 'Mary', 'Frightened', 'what', 'come', 'shunning', 'will', 'receive', 'family', 'friends', 'house', 'cousin', 'Elizabeth', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'who', 'miraculously', 'carrying', 'child', 'own', 'age', 'husband', 'Zechariah', 'Stanley', 'Townsend', 'very', 'understanding', 'Mary', 'plight', 'emotion', 'not', 'shared', 'family', 'when', 'six', 'months', 'pregnant', 'meantime', 'three', 'wise', 'men', 'East', 'have', 'been', 'studying', 'various', 'prophecies', 'astronomy', 'believe', 'soon', 'three', 'planets', 'will', 'align', 'creating', 'illusion', 'powerful', 'star', 'Judea', 'signifying', 'coming', 'messiah', 'there', 'story', 'biblical', 'account', 'one', 'better-produced', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'slew', 'decent', 'actors', 'careful', 'thought', 'preparation', 'outline.I', 'know', 'great', 'deal', 'culture', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'screenplay', 'realistic', 'view', 'life', 'time', 'including', 'brutality', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'egocentric', 'traits', 'Herod', 'self-serving', 'son', 'minor', 'role', 'Herod', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'alive', 'Christ', 'crucifixion', 'careful', 'attention', 'scripture', 'story', 'respect', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'However', 'one', 'crucial', 'ingredient', 'missing', 'Passion', 'Enthusiasm', 'Emotion', 'Jews', 'were', 'emotional', 'culture', 'none', 'bleeds', 'particularly', 'Mary', 'one', 'central', 'force', 'story', 'evolves', 'Mary', 'stoic', 'point', 'being', 'boring', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'likable', 'interesting', 'character', 'instead', 'banal', 'presence', 'other', 'characters', 'revolve', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Keisha', 'fault', 'not', 'being', 'enthusiastic', 'role', 'fact', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'work', 'poor', 'directing', 'nothing', 'not', 'when', 'angel', 'when', 'night', 'even', 'when', 'Joseph', 'will', 'take', 'baby', 'own', 'be', 'bound', 'marriage', 'even', 'sake', 'being', 'shunned', 'right', 'most', 'smile', 'where', 'expected', 'abundant', 'gratitude', 'even', 'tears', 'joy.This', 'more', 'sad', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'fabulous', 'get', 'sense', 'evil', 'Herod', 'wise', 'men', 'are', 'appropriately', 'humorous', 'Joseph', 'awesome', 'Mild-mannered', 'strong', 'caring', 'point', 'giving', 'last', 'share', 'bread', 'family', 'donkey', 'frightened', 'when', 'helping', 'Mary', 'deliver', 'child', 'wanted', 'more', 'offered', 'least', 'story', 'worth', 'telling']",N/A

However, this past year I was pleasantly surprised at END OF THE SPEAR, ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING, and FACING THE GIANTS.Finally a spark of hope began to grow that perhaps if I looked forward to seeing a christian based film that I would not be disappointed after all.Then I went to see THE NATIVITY.I actually looked forward to seeing this movie.  The previews looked great- and I was excited to see it.The beginning was great- the humanity of Mary and Joseph was fun and the casting seemed to be well done.  I enjoyed the realism in the town gathering herbs and community harvest etc.  This promised to be a good movie.Then it began the rapid descent down and it never recovered.I tried to like this movie.  I really did, but by the time I was about half to two thirds of the way through it, I honestly wanted to run from the theater and escape the horrible boredom of the movie.At one point, I got up and began to move around just so I could stay awake.  I did not want to leave because I wanted to give the movie every chance, but it did not get any better.The pace was boring, the movie lacked any luster at all and there was almost no color in it whatsoever- which made it visually boring as well.  I felt like I did not care about this couple and their baby- which I do not think I have ever experienced in a movie on this topic before, that I can recall.Everything just seemed off and I did not enjoy it very much once I got about 1/3 of the way into it.  My husband felt the same way which surprised me as he usually likes things that I do not necessarily like.In fact at one point, he asked me what that homeless guy was doing in a tree- and I figured out that it was supposed to be the angel annoucing the Christ child's birth to the shepherds.Perhaps if I see the DVD some day I will feel differently, but I could not WAIT to leave the theater and get away from this movie.

That is especially the case with The Nativity Story, a truly wonderful film that conveys great spiritual power, even as it brings home the humanity of Mary and Joseph to a degree few of its predecessors ever even attempted.  Keisha Castle-Hughes is wonderful as young Mary, but I tend to look upon this film as Joseph's story, and Oscar Isaac is more than up to the task of bringing this humble carpenter to vivid life.The Nativity Story basically tells the story of Mary and Joseph from the time Mary is betrothed and then finds out she is to give birth to God's Son up through the time of Jesus' birth and the family's evacuation to Egypt.  It does an exceptional job of humanizing Mary and Joseph.  At 14, Mary is on the brink of womanhood, and early on we are treated with several moments showing us a glimpse of the normal child she was.  Her sudden betrothal to Joseph is not something she welcomes, but we see it as a reality of family survival in those troubled times under the double domination of Herod and Rome.  When the angel appears to her, she accepts the good news he brings - yet she doesn't completely believe it until she finds her much older cousin Elizabeth carrying the child who would be Jesus' messenger.  Her most trying time comes when she returns home.  A lot of adaptations tend to gloss over this part.  Put yourself in her place, though - she's a 14-year-old girl, betrothed to a good man, who returns home with a child she claims to have been miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit.  Her story was even less plausible back then than it would be today.  Suddenly, she is a pariah of sorts, looked down upon by all who know her, her very future very much in doubt.The thing I loved most about this film is the depth of its portrayal of Joseph.  All too often, Joseph gets short shrift in the story of Christ's birth, but this film has one of the best characterizations of Joseph I've ever seen.  Obviously mortified by Mary's pregnancy, he refuses to accuse her (thus very probably saving her life).  Even after he is visited by an angel and told that Mary is indeed carrying the Son of God, it takes a lot of courage for him to take Mary as his wife and to claim a child that is not his.  On the long and hard road to Bethlehem, we see many small yet all-encompassing examples of his sacrifice for Mary and the Child.  After their arrival and frantic effort to find a room, it is Joseph who delivers the child himself.  The bond that grows between he and Mary is one of this film's many great strengths.The portrayal of the three Wise Men from the East is especially interesting, as they sometimes serve up a few bits of comic relief.  One of them, for example, is less than enthused about actually traveling to Judea to find the child whose birth they have predicted based upon their study of the stars (with the star of Bethlehem being attributed to the rare convergence of three heavenly bodies).  It really was a hard journey, requiring several months of travel across deserts and mountains.  By conveying their journey basically in its entirety, this film produced in me a new level of respect for these men and their significance in the story of Jesus' birth.The final half hour of the film pretty much blew me away.  The light of the Star shining down on the manger, the depiction of the shepherds, the arrival of the Magi - it all really brings home the significance of this newborn baby.  As if that isn't enough, the story also features some subtle and profound foreshadowing of later events in Jesus' life.  For Christians, the film is truly a blessing, but even nonbelievers should appreciate the poignancy of the story, the fine acting, and the excellent cinematography - and everyone should welcome the opportunity to glance into the rearview mirror of time and get a sense of life as it was just over two thousand years ago.",5,A wonderful and surprisingly moving look at the story of Jesus' birth,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,4027,"['When', ""'re"", 'talking', 'film', 'adaptations', 'story', 'Christ', 'birth', 'old', 'rubric', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'not', 'apply', 'especially', 'case', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'film', 'great', 'spiritual', 'power', 'even', 'home', 'humanity', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'degree', 'few', 'predecessors', 'ever', 'even', 'attempted', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'wonderful', 'young', 'Mary', 'tend', 'look', 'film', 'Joseph', 'story', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'bringing', 'humble', 'carpenter', 'vivid', 'life.The', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'basically', 'story', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'time', 'Mary', 'betrothed', 'then', 'out', 'give', 'birth', 'God', 'Son', 'up', 'time', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'family', 'evacuation', 'Egypt', 'exceptional', 'job', 'humanizing', 'Mary', 'Joseph', '14', 'Mary', 'brink', 'womanhood', 'early', 'are', 'treated', 'several', 'moments', 'showing', 'glimpse', 'normal', 'child', 'was', 'sudden', 'betrothal', 'Joseph', 'not', 'something', 'see', 'reality', 'family', 'survival', 'troubled', 'times', 'double', 'domination', 'Herod', 'Rome', 'When', 'angel', 'good', 'news', 'yet', ""n't"", 'completely', 'believe', 'much', 'older', 'cousin', 'Elizabeth', 'carrying', 'child', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'Jesus', 'messenger', 'most', 'trying', 'time', 'when', 'home', 'lot', 'adaptations', 'tend', 'gloss', 'part', 'Put', 'place', '14-year-old', 'girl', 'betrothed', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'home', 'child', 'have', 'been', 'miraculously', 'conceived', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'story', 'was', 'even', 'less', 'plausible', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'today', 'Suddenly', 'pariah', 'sorts', 'looked', 'down', 'upon', 'who', 'know', 'very', 'future', 'very', 'much', 'doubt.The', 'thing', 'loved', 'most', 'film', 'depth', 'portrayal', 'Joseph', 'All', 'too', 'often', 'Joseph', 'short', 'shrift', 'story', 'Christ', 'birth', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'characterizations', 'Joseph', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Obviously', 'mortified', 'Mary', 'pregnancy', 'accuse', 'thus', 'very', 'probably', 'saving', 'life', 'Even', 'visited', 'angel', 'told', 'Mary', 'indeed', 'carrying', 'Son', 'God', 'lot', 'courage', 'take', 'Mary', 'wife', 'claim', 'child', 'not', 'long', 'hard', 'road', 'Bethlehem', 'see', 'many', 'small', 'yet', 'all-encompassing', 'examples', 'sacrifice', 'Mary', 'Child', 'arrival', 'frantic', 'effort', 'find', 'room', 'Joseph', 'who', 'child', 'bond', 'Mary', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'great', 'strengths.The', 'portrayal', 'three', 'Wise', 'Men', 'East', 'especially', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'serve', 'up', 'few', 'bits', 'comic', 'relief', 'One', 'example', 'less', 'enthused', 'actually', 'traveling', 'Judea', 'find', 'child', 'birth', 'have', 'predicted', 'based', 'study', 'stars', 'star', 'Bethlehem', 'being', 'attributed', 'rare', 'convergence', 'three', 'heavenly', 'bodies', 'really', 'was', 'hard', 'journey', 'requiring', 'several', 'months', 'travel', 'deserts', 'mountains', 'conveying', 'journey', 'basically', 'entirety', 'film', 'produced', 'new', 'level', 'respect', 'men', 'significance', 'story', 'Jesus', 'birth.The', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'away', 'light', 'Star', 'shining', 'down', 'manger', 'depiction', 'shepherds', 'arrival', 'Magi', 'really', 'home', 'significance', 'newborn', 'baby', ""n't"", 'enough', 'story', 'also', 'subtle', 'profound', 'foreshadowing', 'later', 'events', 'Jesus', 'life', 'Christians', 'film', 'truly', 'blessing', 'even', 'nonbelievers', 'should', 'appreciate', 'poignancy', 'story', 'fine', 'acting', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'everyone', 'should', 'welcome', 'opportunity', 'glance', 'rearview', 'mirror', 'time', 'get', 'sense', 'life', 'was', 'just', 'two', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago']",N/A

It is the best done story of the nativity that I have ever seen. I thought I would be bored with ""The Nativity Story"", because I am so familiar with the Bible's account. I ,however, enjoyed how the movie explored different aspects of Mary and Joseph's life that I have not seen portrayed before. I understand that the screen writer and director consulted Jewish and Christian scholars to be as culturally accurate of that time period as possible. I also liked the way that Mary and Joseph's journey to Bethlehem was portrayed. It was depicted as a hard journey through the dessert and mountainous ranges, and they didn't have much to eat. This is probably most accurate of what they actually experienced.  Finally, I loved the costumes.

Collier ""Shelf-Help""","[1, 1]","New Line Cinema's popularity has surged in the last several years thanks both to the critical as well as the commercial success THE LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy.  New Line's production of THE NATIVITY STORY carries the exact same quality and appeal.Far from the (unfortunately) all too typical standards of the average Christian movie, THE NATIVITY STORY stands apart with top notch performances from not only the starring roles but all of the supporting roles as well.  The acting in this film is just as good as any that will be nominated for Academy Awards this year.  The cinematography and editing are also very well done.  As a lover of well-made, quality films, I could not have asked for it to have been any better made.The music echoes of the Old Testament Hebrew style.  Though it's not as operatic as many of the more commercially popular Hollywood scores, its blend of Christmas themes and tone-setting new age styles makes the film much more enjoyable and intriguing.Where THE NATIVITY STORY really shines is through the emotional trauma of the principal characters including Mary, Joseph, and Mary's mother and father.  The uncertainty, the stress, the fears, and the exhilaration at what has befallen them are all vividly and memorably portrayed.Now that I have given this well-made movie all the credit it deserves, I have to point out a few places where it fell miserably short.  The problem I have that comes most prominently to mind is when Mary and Joseph pass through the crowded streets of Jerusalem and pass a Messianic prophet (who is portrayed more or less as a madman) and ignore him.  Then Mary has her palm read by a kind and compassionate palm reader.  Mary, being a devoted and righteous Hebrew, never would have allowed such a thing!  These types of mediums were expressly forbidden in the Mosaic law.  It may sound like I'm being too nitpicky.  But anyone who has studied the Old Testament will say that this is a very serious flaw in the film.Another problem is when the Magi visit Mary, Joseph, and Jesus in the stable.  This is the most common misconception in the Christmas story, as the Bible clearly states that they arrived after He had already been born.  (See Matthew 2.)  For me it's not a major problem, but it would have been nice to see someone finally get it right for a change.  Also, instead of being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, one of the Magi just implies that it's due to his gut feeling.In the overall scope of the picture, the flaws are minor -- except for the first one.  That's a major flaw that the writers should have left on the editing room floor -- or, better yet -- not have written at all.",3,Amazingly well made...but beware a few flaws,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,2662,"['New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'popularity', 'surged', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'thanks', 'critical', 'as', 'well', 'commercial', 'success', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'Trilogy', 'New', 'Line', 'production', 'THE', 'NATIVITY', 'STORY', 'exact', 'same', 'quality', 'appeal.Far', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'typical', 'standards', 'average', 'Christian', 'movie', 'THE', 'NATIVITY', 'STORY', 'apart', 'top', 'notch', 'performances', 'not', 'only', 'starring', 'roles', 'supporting', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'will', 'be', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'year', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'lover', 'well-made', 'quality', 'films', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'asked', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'made.The', 'music', 'echoes', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Hebrew', 'style', 'not', 'as', 'operatic', 'many', 'more', 'commercially', 'popular', 'Hollywood', 'scores', 'blend', 'Christmas', 'themes', 'tone-setting', 'new', 'age', 'styles', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'intriguing.Where', 'THE', 'NATIVITY', 'STORY', 'really', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'principal', 'characters', 'including', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'Mary', 'mother', 'father', 'uncertainty', 'stress', 'fears', 'exhilaration', 'what', 'befallen', 'are', 'vividly', 'memorably', 'portrayed.Now', 'have', 'given', 'well-made', 'movie', 'credit', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'fell', 'miserably', 'short', 'problem', 'have', 'most', 'prominently', 'mind', 'when', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'pass', 'crowded', 'streets', 'Jerusalem', 'pass', 'Messianic', 'prophet', 'who', 'portrayed', 'more', 'madman', 'Then', 'Mary', 'palm', 'read', 'kind', 'compassionate', 'palm', 'reader', 'Mary', 'being', 'devoted', 'righteous', 'Hebrew', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'thing', 'types', 'mediums', 'were', 'expressly', 'forbidden', 'Mosaic', 'law', 'may', 'sound', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'nitpicky', 'anyone', 'who', 'studied', 'Old', 'Testament', 'will', 'say', 'very', 'serious', 'flaw', 'film.Another', 'problem', 'when', 'Magi', 'visit', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'Jesus', 'stable', 'most', 'common', 'misconception', 'Christmas', 'story', 'Bible', 'clearly', 'arrived', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'born', 'See', 'Matthew', '2', 'not', 'major', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'someone', 'finally', 'get', 'right', 'change', 'Also', 'instead', 'being', 'warned', 'dream', 'not', 'return', 'Herod', 'one', 'Magi', 'just', 'due', 'gut', 'feeling.In', 'overall', 'scope', 'picture', 'flaws', 'are', 'minor', 'first', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'editing', 'room', 'floor', 'better', 'yet', 'not', 'have', 'written']",N/A

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[48, 68]","In spite of two present day controversies surrounding the 2006 film,----it seems advertising for the film was verboten in Chicago's Christkindlmarket where a spokesman for the Mayor's office declared the film ""insensitive to the many people of different faiths"" containing a ""blatant commercial message"" and Keisha Castle-Hughes the sixteen year old star who portrays Mary missed the premiere of the film at the Vatican because she is expecting a baby with her 19 year old partner----""The Nativity Story,"" director Catharine Hardwicke still manages to juxtapose the traditional elements of a story all too familiar with any Sunday school student with the modern issues of unwed pregnancy and confused adolescence of today's youth.  The end result presents a pageantry as rich as any of the tapestries donned by the cinematic three Magi yet enriched with the psychological weft and warp of the same brand of teenaged angst Hardwicke portrays in her grittier offerings, ""Thirteen"" and ""The Lords of Dogtown.""Okay - Mary, played with a complacent and dignified reserve by Whale Rider's Keisha Castle-Hughes, certainly does not indulge in any 21st century hi-jinx involving designer hallucinogens or Melrose Place shoplifting.  However, on a level just a compelling, the anxieties surrounding teenaged pregnancy albeit tempered somewhat by 2000+ years of Biblical familiarity help move the larger-than-life characters out of the plaster saint realm of the Christmas cr&egrave;che and into a universally empathetic adolescent world where parents-to-be, their parents combined with other authority figures in the forum of community are forced to deal with events that shake clung-to-for-dear-life conventions.  Initially, Castle-Hughes depicts Mary with an indignant belligerence.  Bordering on young womanhood, she straddles a splintery fence where she is too old to run and play with the other children; yet too young to accept the fact that at fourteen years old she is engaged to a man she neither knows nor loves.  With the advent of the angel Gabriel and his miraculous message, Mary breathes a deep sigh and accepts her role in the grand scheme of things with magnificent gravitas.Without the contemporary medical substantiation of a DNA test, Joseph (Oscar Isaac) must field the shocked stares and whispered gossip of the otherwise God-fearing Nazarenes with a thwarting skeptical silence that glitters steadily from large and liquid Godiva chocolate eyes.  Flooded with a deer-in-the-headlight's wonder at this unbelievable and uncomfortable turn of events, he too must dig deep into his core, sacrifice a bit of his dream and take under his wing not just another man's but another entity's child.  His predicament couldn't get anymore life changing and surely one to which young unexpected expectant fathers anywhere can relate.Even with this insight into the everyday issues faced by these two unseasoned parents, the larger story as supported by the secondary players sweeps the audience along with its Biblical accuracy.  As the film's villains, King Herod and Herod Antipas (Ciaran Hinds and Alessandro Giuggioli) sneer brilliantly in smug Snidely Whiplash style as they discuss the Messiah prophesy and decide how to do away with the unknown competition of the newborn King of Kings heralded in the stars.  24's Shohreh Aghdashloo formulates an exotic amalgamation of the hot and the passionate to craft John the Baptist's mother, Elizabeth,; this actress's lovely expansiveness provides the right combination of vehemence and encouragement to compliment and soothe Castle-Hughes' adolescent uncertainty.  The exploits of the three Magi as depicted by Nadim Sawalha, Eriq Ebouaney and Stefan Kalipha allow the audience a break from the seriousness of the subject matter; we giggle as the trio mixes astrology, astronomy and a dash of slapstick as they journey unknowingly on a trek across the desert and that of the expectations of the human heart.  Satisfyingly predictable, all threads of this finely crafted visual textile come together in the famous stable floodlit by a conjunction of heavenly bodies so phenomenal that in one's heart of hearts, one can only hope that the depiction mirrored some semblance of the actual event.""The Nativity"" pleases then on both a psychological and illustrative level.  Hardwicke, setting the story in the same village Mel Gibson used for his ""Passion of the Christ,"" presents a less brutal sense of reality for that historic time period in her depiction of Nazareth and the larger cities the couple journeys through as they head towards Bethlehem. Jerusalem reminds one of the tiered cities in ""Lord of the Rings"" but works nevertheless.Bottom Line?  Despite the controversies that seem to surround any religiously themed film showcased in today's ridiculously politically correct arena (the American Constitution still stands by its free speech amendment and the right for any citizen to choose individually what they wish to see or not see) and the disturbing parallel insinuated by the press between Keisha Castle-Hughes' pregnancy and that of her character in the film, ""The Nativity"" remains a lovely reconstruction of the gospels of St. Luke and St. Matthew and is appropriate and recommended for all ages.  Note: Some parents may not want their younger children to witness the birth of St. John the Baptist.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,A Shining Christmas Star,1165104000,"12 3,

We get to see Joseph and Mary as people of character who really want to live righteously for the Lord. We see the godly and discerning Elizabeth as she counsels Mary on how to handle these unique circumstances.I have always wondered how Mary broke the news to Joseph and her family about her divine pregnancy. How do you explain something like that? This movie gives a very realistic picture of how that news would have been initially received.After Joseph's dream reveals to him that Mary's pregnancy is from the Lord, he goes to her and says ""I believe you! I believe you! You shall call His name Jesus!"" It is a touching scene!Next, you have the long 100 mile journey to Bethlehem to register for the census. The baby Jesus is born in a cave in Bethlehem, though a good case can be made that the manger he was placed in was in the part of a house occupied by animals than a cave per se.Also, the Magi (who are the funniest people in the film) are portrayed as coming to the cave the same night the shepherds are there, though scholars have suggested that the visit of the Magi in Matthew 2 may have been a few months later.But I found the movie to be deeply satisfying, and it made me worship Jesus again as our Savior and Newborn King!

But, if you want a sense of the mystery and beauty... the true meaning of Christmas, you will find this film everything your heart could desire.  Throughout, the writers and director did everything possible to be in conformity with the history and theology of the birth of Christ, so that no mainstream Christian will find anything contrary to the scriptural account.  While there are moments (like the slaughter of the infants and the birth of John the Baptist) which may not be suitable to little children, I highly recommend this film for family viewing.  With a little sensitive explanation, most kids 12 and up should have no difficulties.As for the performances, they are excellent (with, perhaps, the single exception of the Archangel Gabriel, whom I found a bit distracting)!  Throughout, you get the sense of really getting to know the principle characters of the nativity narratives... what they might have been thinking, how they may have felt.  The film provides unique perspectives that most never take the time to think through, and those perspectives bring the story to life.  Again, if you have problems with films that are not packed with motion and non-stop action, you probably won't make it through this one.  If you enjoy deep thought and prayer, on the other hand, this film will more than satisfy.  I love it and I'm buying multiple copies for all of my friends that missed it in the theaters.Note:  After reading a few other comments from others, I wanted to add a brief post-script regarding the scriptural accuracy of the film.  There are a few trivial differences from scripture such as the Magi coming to the manger on the night of the birth and not arriving at ""the house"" some time later.  But, let's be reasonable. You DO have to allow for the time constraints of the movie and permit a couple times where the story is ""condensed"" (such as in this moment) in order to keep the story line moving.  However, you will find that, where these liberties are taken, it has no impact on the story and the message of the bible.  I know my scriptures well and I had no problems with this movie.  I would hope that this movie would become a tradition for every Christian household during the Christmas season so that Christmas would once again become that season of grace... of quiet and humility... of hiddenness and charity... just as it was meant to be (instead of plastic trees, loud noise, pushing and shoving at the malls, runaway commercialism, etc.)  Perhaps, if this movie hasn't made the kind of money that sick comedies or blood-and-gore action movies usually draw, it's a good sign.  Maybe it will tell us that this movie brings to us precisely the kind of counter-cultural message that the world needs to hear... a message ""rejected"" that is the very cornerstone of Christian belief.",5,Prayerful meditation on the season of Christmas,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,2922,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'gradiose', 'production', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'style', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'want', 'sense', 'mystery', 'beauty', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'everything', 'heart', 'could', 'desire', 'Throughout', 'writers', 'director', 'did', 'everything', 'possible', 'be', 'conformity', 'history', 'theology', 'birth', 'Christ', 'mainstream', 'Christian', 'will', 'find', 'anything', 'contrary', 'scriptural', 'account', 'are', 'moments', 'slaughter', 'infants', 'birth', 'John', 'Baptist', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'little', 'children', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'family', 'viewing', 'little', 'sensitive', 'explanation', 'most', 'kids', '12', 'up', 'should', 'have', 'difficulties.As', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'perhaps', 'single', 'exception', 'Archangel', 'Gabriel', 'whom', 'found', 'bit', 'distracting', 'Throughout', 'get', 'sense', 'really', 'getting', 'know', 'principle', 'characters', 'nativity', 'narratives', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'thinking', 'how', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'film', 'unique', 'perspectives', 'most', 'never', 'take', 'time', 'think', 'perspectives', 'bring', 'story', 'life', 'Again', 'have', 'problems', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'packed', 'motion', 'non-stop', 'action', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'enjoy', 'deep', 'thought', 'prayer', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'will', 'more', 'satisfy', 'love', ""'m"", 'buying', 'multiple', 'copies', 'friends', 'missed', 'theaters.Note', 'reading', 'few', 'other', 'comments', 'others', 'wanted', 'add', 'brief', 'post-script', 'regarding', 'scriptural', 'accuracy', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'trivial', 'differences', 'scripture', 'such', 'Magi', 'coming', 'manger', 'night', 'birth', 'not', 'arriving', 'house', 'time', 'later', 'let', 'be', 'reasonable', 'DO', 'have', 'allow', 'time', 'constraints', 'movie', 'permit', 'couple', 'times', 'where', 'story', 'condensed', 'such', 'moment', 'order', 'keep', 'story', 'line', 'moving', 'However', 'will', 'find', 'where', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'impact', 'story', 'message', 'bible', 'know', 'scriptures', 'well', 'had', 'problems', 'movie', 'would', 'hope', 'movie', 'would', 'become', 'tradition', 'Christian', 'household', 'Christmas', 'season', 'so', 'Christmas', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'become', 'season', 'grace', 'quiet', 'humility', 'hiddenness', 'charity', 'just', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'instead', 'plastic', 'trees', 'loud', 'noise', 'pushing', 'shoving', 'malls', 'runaway', 'commercialism', 'etc', 'Perhaps', 'movie', ""n't"", 'made', 'kind', 'money', 'sick', 'comedies', 'blood-and-gore', 'action', 'movies', 'usually', 'draw', 'good', 'sign', 'will', 'tell', 'movie', 'precisely', 'kind', 'counter-cultural', 'message', 'world', 'hear', 'message', 'rejected', 'very', 'cornerstone', 'Christian', 'belief']",N/A

The young teen-age girl Mary, from Nazareth in Galilee, is told by the angel Gabriel that she will soon be with child, and he would be the one to bear the sins of the world. Then, from the all-too-familiar story we know that Mary and her fiance Joseph go to Jerusalem to pay their taxes, but stop at Bethlehem where the child is born. The Wise Men later come, as do the shepherds, to see the newborn child Jesus.This movie shows clearly to the general public that Mary is just a flighty teenage girl, not too well-known, from the poor village of Nazareth. And yet, the savior of the world will be born of her. The movie maintained my attention as the facts were, again, dramatically presented to the public. Of course, in places some dramatic license is taken, particularly when Mary and Joseph are crossing a river and have a slight accident, just to cite one instance. And one question remains unanswered, concerning how many magi actually went to Jerusalem. Did only three Wise Men go to Bethlehem? Or were there more than that? Or were there less than three? One true fact that was depicted, and graphically, was the slaughtering of the children of Israel, thanks to the fiat of Herod. But despite the dramatic license and the unanswered questions, I personally was given an idea of what the situation was like with Mary and Joseph circa two thousand years ago. Israel looked convincing. (Especially when it was actually Morocco.) The acting was impressive, though the actors were not well-known themselves. I did not feel the movie was a bit boring.

However, the acting and the production details are wonderful. It brings to mind the question, if you believe the account of Jesus' birth what are you doing about it in your life?My daughter and I both fell in love with Joseph who appears always in the background in the Bible but you truly realize now how he would have been a great man. Kind, compassionate, a selfless giver, a strong leader and protector, loyal, filled with honor and integrity and a great teacher. Wow! You see he and Mary's relationship truly blossom while he and Mary are traveling that hundred miles over that rugged terrain. How many men would make that journey and take care of a girl who was not carrying his child?

For the most part, the casting is good - Mary, Joseph, Herod. It's interesting to hear their accented readings, especially Gabriel's, even if of course they should be speaking Aramaic (and Farsi, for the wise men). I'm not sure of the astronomical accuracy regarding the Star - see BethlehemStar for a different view. And there are some additions to the story, most notably Mary's rejection of Joseph, but it makes for some development in the story, and is mostly benign. I'd have made the Magi's caravan a little more substantial for such a journey.The slaughter of the 2-and-unders is not left out. There is no heavenly choir, though - I'd have liked to have seen how they handled that (well, I guess they did, by omitting it).

I found this retelling of the birth of the Messiah to be refreshingly free of ""artistic license"", with only a few minor elements added by the screenwriters.I especially like the way the film conveys the awkwardness of Mary's situation.  Her family wants to believe her story about the angel and her miraculous pregnancy, but they still have their doubts.  The pain and betrayal on Joseph's face when he first sees her ""condition"" is genuinely heartrending.  Despite their marriage being an arranged one, it's obvious that he truly loves Mary.  He struggles to believe her, but it's only when the angel appears to him in a dream that he is able to accept her story.  The knowing looks and wary aloofness of the neighbors isn't described in the Bible, but I would be shocked if it didn't happen.  In fact, the Gospel of John does indicate that there were rumors about Jesus' parentage (see John 8:41).There are other good moments, too.  I liked Joseph's desperation as he races from door to door in Bethlehem looking for a place to stay.  It never occurred to me before that Mary's labor might have begun before they actually arrived at the stable; it's certainly believable that Joseph would have been nearly frantic to get shelter.Another sequence I liked was Mary's meeting with her cousin Elisabeth.  I tend to forget that Elisabeth was much older than Mary.  God must have known that Mary would need a confidant and mentor, someone who would believe her because of her own miraculous pregnancy.The film is not without its flaws.  For some reason they left out the ""multitude of the heavenly host"" that appeared to the shepherds.  It also reinforces an age-old error by having the Wise Men show up at the manger (the Bible indicates that Mary & Joseph had moved into a house by the time of the Magi's visit, and also refers to Jesus as a ""young Child"" rather than a baby).  By the way, I had read that the movie portrayed the Wise Men as ""comic relief"".  I was afraid they would be more like the Three Stooges than the Three Magi, but fortunately, the humor is very gentle and only serves to make them more human and likeable.Technically, the film is solid, although Keisha Castle-Hughes could have used more facial expression in her performance.  I would also like to see a religious movie whose musical score doesn't go to the ""oooh..aaaah"" choral well too often.  Overall, though, I enjoyed the film and would recommend it for anyone who would like to see the birth of Christ in a fresh light.",4,Realistic portrayal of Mary & Joseph,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,2616,"['Most', 'Bible-based', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'imagination', 'revelation', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'exception', 'rule', 'found', 'retelling', 'birth', 'Messiah', 'be', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'artistic', 'license', 'only', 'few', 'minor', 'elements', 'added', 'screenwriters.I', 'especially', 'way', 'film', 'conveys', 'awkwardness', 'Mary', 'situation', 'family', 'believe', 'story', 'angel', 'miraculous', 'pregnancy', 'still', 'have', 'doubts', 'pain', 'betrayal', 'Joseph', 'face', 'when', 'first', 'condition', 'genuinely', 'heartrending', 'marriage', 'being', 'arranged', 'one', 'obvious', 'Mary', 'believe', 'only', 'when', 'angel', 'dream', 'able', 'accept', 'story', 'knowing', 'wary', 'aloofness', 'neighbors', ""n't"", 'described', 'Bible', 'would', 'be', 'shocked', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'fact', 'Gospel', 'John', 'indicate', 'were', 'rumors', 'Jesus', 'parentage', 'see', 'John', '8:41', 'are', 'other', 'good', 'moments', 'too', 'liked', 'Joseph', 'desperation', 'door', 'door', 'Bethlehem', 'looking', 'place', 'stay', 'never', 'occurred', 'Mary', 'labor', 'might', 'have', 'begun', 'actually', 'arrived', 'stable', 'certainly', 'believable', 'Joseph', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'frantic', 'get', 'shelter.Another', 'sequence', 'liked', 'was', 'Mary', 'meeting', 'cousin', 'Elisabeth', 'tend', 'forget', 'Elisabeth', 'was', 'much', 'older', 'Mary', 'God', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'Mary', 'would', 'need', 'confidant', 'mentor', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'believe', 'own', 'miraculous', 'pregnancy.The', 'film', 'not', 'flaws', 'reason', 'left', 'out', 'multitude', 'heavenly', 'host', 'appeared', 'shepherds', 'also', 'age-old', 'error', 'having', 'Wise', 'Men', 'show', 'up', 'manger', 'Bible', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'had', 'moved', 'house', 'time', 'Magi', 'visit', 'also', 'refers', 'Jesus', 'young', 'Child', 'rather', 'baby', 'way', 'had', 'read', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'Wise', 'Men', 'comic', 'relief', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Three', 'Magi', 'fortunately', 'humor', 'very', 'gentle', 'only', 'serves', 'make', 'more', 'human', 'likeable.Technically', 'film', 'solid', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'facial', 'expression', 'performance', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'see', 'religious', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', ""n't"", 'go', 'oooh..aaaah', 'choral', 'well', 'too', 'often', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'birth', 'Christ', 'fresh', 'light']",N/A

I think all families should watch this movie together maybe it would put everyone, including the children back into perspective of the true meaning of Christmas. In todays society most children believe Christmas is all about Santa Claus, shopping, gifts, wrapping and not to mention food. I have felt for a long time that Christmas is to commercialized, even when people do not have the money they add to their debt. I think this movie did a pretty good job demonstrating the need for everyone, not just families to join together. Ofcourse everybody has seen all sorts of Christmas movies and to me they all seem to follow the same commercialized storyline.

The story begins with Mary, a young girl who gets married to Joseph, but it unable to consummate the marriage with him. One night an angel comes to her in her dream and tells her that she will bear the Son of God, knowing this she goes to Zachariah, whose wife comforts her and finds her a safe place for until she is pregnant. When Mary returns to her town, she is shunned by all, but accepted by Joseph, due to the fact that the same angel appears to Joseph and tells him that Mary is pure and innocent. He too, is then shunned by the town; they travel to Bethlehem because of King Herod's orders for people to return to the towns of their birth. Herod did that because of a prophecy foreseeing the coming of the Messiah, the savior, and ultimately his destroyer. However when Herod finds out from the three priests that Messiah is not a grown man, but a baby, he orders his soldiers to kill all the babies in Bethlehem. Meanwhile, Mary and Joseph seek refuge in a stable, where she gives birth to Jesus Christ. The three priests come to the stable bringing the gift of gold, myrrh, and incense. By morning they escape the soldiers' massacre as they depart Bethlehem.This story is related to Christianity as it speaks of the most influential figures in the religion. It marks the beginning of Christianity and also enforces the presence of God amongst his people and the ideology that Jesus' birth was of a divine nature and also that God is capable of all things. It tells about the struggles that Mary and Joseph faced and how faith in God carried them safely to Bethlehem to fulfill the prophecy of the coming of the Messiah.",4,Wonderful Story.,1226707200,"11 15, 2008",2008,1771,"['Nativity', 'Story', 'account', 'period', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'review', 'biblical', 'narrative', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'story', 'Mary', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'married', 'Joseph', 'unable', 'consummate', 'marriage', 'One', 'night', 'angel', 'dream', 'will', 'bear', 'Son', 'God', 'knowing', 'Zachariah', 'wife', 'safe', 'place', 'pregnant', 'When', 'Mary', 'town', 'shunned', 'accepted', 'Joseph', 'due', 'fact', 'same', 'angel', 'Joseph', 'Mary', 'pure', 'innocent', 'too', 'then', 'shunned', 'town', 'travel', 'Bethlehem', 'King', 'Herod', 'orders', 'people', 'return', 'towns', 'birth', 'Herod', 'did', 'prophecy', 'foreseeing', 'coming', 'Messiah', 'savior', 'ultimately', 'destroyer', 'However', 'when', 'Herod', 'out', 'three', 'priests', 'Messiah', 'not', 'grown', 'man', 'baby', 'orders', 'soldiers', 'kill', 'babies', 'Bethlehem', 'Meanwhile', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'seek', 'refuge', 'stable', 'where', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'three', 'priests', 'come', 'stable', 'bringing', 'gift', 'gold', 'myrrh', 'incense', 'morning', 'escape', 'soldiers', 'massacre', 'depart', 'Bethlehem.This', 'story', 'related', 'Christianity', 'most', 'influential', 'figures', 'religion', 'beginning', 'Christianity', 'also', 'presence', 'God', 'people', 'ideology', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'was', 'divine', 'nature', 'also', 'God', 'capable', 'things', 'struggles', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'faced', 'how', 'faith', 'God', 'carried', 'safely', 'Bethlehem', 'fulfill', 'prophecy', 'coming', 'Messiah']",N/A

When Luke & Matthew recorded the nativity story all of their focus was on the fact of the divine incarnation itself, rather than the social backgrounds of the various mortals called upon to facilitate God's purpose. We know the shepherds would have been poverty-stricken (they never bought a single Christmas present!), but Luke emphasises their excitement as they ""hurried off"" to Bethlehem. Likewise we know the Magi would have been phenomenally wealthy (Myrrh costing $10,000 a kilo in 5 BC!), but Matthew chooses instead to emphasise their joyful ecstasy when the star re-appears over Bethlehem. In my view, the directors of this movie dwelt too much on the socio-economic climate of 5 BC Nazareth.But I thoroughly enjoyed the second half - right from the moment that Joseph takes his white ass down to Bethlehem, with his wife Mary side-saddling on its back. The hazardous journey is well depicted, as is the arrival in Bethlehem. Contrary to popular belief, the Magi wouldn't have visited Jesus on the night of his birth. But there's no theological compromise required in bringing their visit forward a few days for drama's sake. In fact the story reaches a beautiful climax when the shepherds & wise men all worship the Christ-child together as the star shines directly into the cave.Overall this film had the potential to be better, but it's still worth a watch.",4,A Film of Two Halves,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,1434,"['enjoyed', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'first', 'When', 'Luke', 'Matthew', 'recorded', 'nativity', 'story', 'focus', 'was', 'fact', 'divine', 'incarnation', 'rather', 'social', 'backgrounds', 'various', 'mortals', 'called', 'facilitate', 'God', 'purpose', 'know', 'shepherds', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'poverty-stricken', 'never', 'bought', 'single', 'Christmas', 'present', 'Luke', 'excitement', 'hurried', 'off', 'Bethlehem', 'Likewise', 'know', 'Magi', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'phenomenally', 'wealthy', 'Myrrh', 'costing', '10,000', 'kilo', '5', 'BC', 'Matthew', 'instead', 'emphasise', 'joyful', 'ecstasy', 'when', 'star', 're-appears', 'Bethlehem', 'view', 'directors', 'movie', 'dwelt', 'too', 'much', 'socio-economic', 'climate', '5', 'BC', 'Nazareth.But', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'half', 'right', 'moment', 'Joseph', 'white', 'ass', 'down', 'Bethlehem', 'wife', 'Mary', 'side-saddling', 'back', 'hazardous', 'journey', 'well', 'depicted', 'arrival', 'Bethlehem', 'Contrary', 'popular', 'belief', 'Magi', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'visited', 'Jesus', 'night', 'birth', 'theological', 'compromise', 'required', 'bringing', 'visit', 'forward', 'few', 'days', 'drama', 'sake', 'fact', 'story', 'beautiful', 'climax', 'when', 'shepherds', 'wise', 'men', 'worship', 'Christ-child', 'together', 'star', 'directly', 'cave.Overall', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'better', 'still', 'worth', 'watch']",N/A

1044987,A3Q04XXGGED746,B000MCIC24,"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker""","[7, 7]","This film, partly using Morocco as the backdrop for events that actually transpired in ancient Roman-ruled Israel, presents a human-experience-centered view of the events surrounding the Incarnation. Even the supernatural occurrences are shown in a low-keyed, unspectacular manner. For instance, when angels speak, they are depicted as being essentially no different from ordinary men speaking.All in all, the film appears to be faithful to the Scriptures, with one obvious exception. The Magi are depicted as figuring out themselves that it would be unwise to return to Herod, when actually it was an angel who told them not to return to Herod.Of course, some of the fine details are necessarily subject to interpretation. For instance, the Star of Bethlehem is portrayed as a conjunction of planets. Others argue that such a conjunction would have only been partial and would never have created a single apparent star, let alone an exceptionally bright one. In fact, there is evidence from Chinese and Korean records of an exceptionally bright star at that time--probably a supernova. Still others think that the Star of Bethlehem must have been a miraculous event.In the film, Mary is portrayed as on the verge of giving birth as she and Joseph first enter Bethlehem. They frantically search for an inn and finally have to settle for a stable. Others think that Mary and Joseph may have been already in Bethlehem for perhaps several months before the Holy Birth. In that case, the inability of Mary and Joseph to find an inn would have resulted from the long-term crowding of Bethlehem caused by the Roman-imposed census, not the unavailability of inns on just a certain night.For even those familiar with the Nativity, the events in the film lead to an air of suspense. The viewer can almost feel the conflict that Joseph and Mary experience when she is widely believed to have committed adultery. Mary has to struggle with being believed by others that the Fruit of her womb had been conceived by the Holy Spirit. Joseph, at minimum, wants there to be no accusation (of adultery) so that there would be no trial and no stoning of Mary as an adulteress. Finally, the angel allays Joseph's fears.The actual slaughter of the innocents by Herod's soldiers is given relatively slight attention. This is in keeping with the minimum of violence that is characteristic of this film.",5,A Simple and Down-to-Earth Portrayal of the Incarnation,1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,2379,"['film', 'partly', 'using', 'Morocco', 'backdrop', 'events', 'actually', 'transpired', 'ancient', 'Roman-ruled', 'Israel', 'human-experience-centered', 'view', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Incarnation', 'Even', 'supernatural', 'occurrences', 'are', 'shown', 'low-keyed', 'unspectacular', 'manner', 'instance', 'when', 'angels', 'speak', 'are', 'depicted', 'being', 'essentially', 'different', 'ordinary', 'men', 'speaking.All', 'film', 'be', 'faithful', 'Scriptures', 'one', 'obvious', 'exception', 'Magi', 'are', 'depicted', 'figuring', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'unwise', 'return', 'Herod', 'when', 'actually', 'was', 'angel', 'who', 'told', 'not', 'return', 'Herod.Of', 'course', 'fine', 'details', 'are', 'necessarily', 'subject', 'interpretation', 'instance', 'Star', 'Bethlehem', 'portrayed', 'conjunction', 'planets', 'Others', 'argue', 'conjunction', 'would', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'partial', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'created', 'single', 'apparent', 'star', 'let', 'alone', 'exceptionally', 'bright', 'one', 'fact', 'evidence', 'Chinese', 'Korean', 'records', 'exceptionally', 'bright', 'star', 'time', 'probably', 'supernova', 'Still', 'others', 'think', 'Star', 'Bethlehem', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'miraculous', 'event.In', 'film', 'Mary', 'portrayed', 'verge', 'giving', 'birth', 'Joseph', 'first', 'enter', 'Bethlehem', 'frantically', 'search', 'inn', 'finally', 'have', 'settle', 'stable', 'Others', 'think', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'already', 'Bethlehem', 'perhaps', 'several', 'months', 'Holy', 'Birth', 'case', 'inability', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'find', 'inn', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'long-term', 'crowding', 'Bethlehem', 'caused', 'Roman-imposed', 'census', 'not', 'unavailability', 'inns', 'just', 'certain', 'night.For', 'even', 'familiar', 'Nativity', 'events', 'film', 'lead', 'air', 'suspense', 'viewer', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'conflict', 'Joseph', 'Mary', 'experience', 'when', 'widely', 'believed', 'have', 'committed', 'adultery', 'Mary', 'struggle', 'being', 'believed', 'others', 'Fruit', 'womb', 'had', 'been', 'conceived', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'Joseph', 'minimum', 'be', 'accusation', 'adultery', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'trial', 'stoning', 'Mary', 'adulteress', 'Finally', 'angel', 'Joseph', 'fears.The', 'actual', 'slaughter', 'innocents', 'Herod', 'soldiers', 'given', 'relatively', 'slight', 'attention', 'keeping', 'minimum', 'violence', 'characteristic', 'film']",N/A

Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is pouty, but generally obedient to her parents. Joseph is a hardworking young carpenter with his eye on the girl. The wise men -- portrayed here as Babylonian house astrologers -- include the traditional white and black man, though curiously, the one from the Orient is another white guy. They do provide a few of the lighthearted elements in this otherwise safe film as they bicker about whether the journey to Bethlehem should be a spiritual one or an arduous one. Otherwise, all the traditional elements are here -- the announcement by an angel, a visit to a older pregnant cousin, a difficult, wind-blown trek to be counted in a census, camels on sand dunes, etc.What's missing is any of the humanity of other versions. Actors read their lines without much conviction and with no sense that events could transpire in any way but the scripted one. When 3 stars (actually, 2 planets and a mysterious heavenly body) combine into a blinding spotlight (accompanied by a Star Wars light saber sound effects) no one reacts, as though such celestial light shows were run of the mill in the first century.Every movie version of the Jesus story bring its own special touch. In ""The Nativity Story,"" village life is depicted with loving attention to detail. Entire families sleep together in the same room, roofs are painstakingly wrought of wattle and daub and women spend lots of time toting jugs of water. And I think this is one of the few movies to depict Mary as having a living mother *and* father. The people of Nazareth act in true peasant fashion, holding grudges and having dirty faces and hands. Too bad the movie's writers didn't imbue the plot and dialog with the same sense of gritty realism. And history buffs might grind their teeth at some of the confusions, the most egregious being the equation of Roman and Herodian soldiers.As it stands, ""The Nativity Story"" is decent Sunday school fare, with nothing controversial and nothing illuminating.",3,"Pious, yet flat retelling",1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,2100,"['little', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'would', 'give', 'even', 'most', 'pious', 'Christian', 'slightest', 'case', 'reflux', 'Mary', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'pouty', 'generally', 'obedient', 'parents', 'Joseph', 'hardworking', 'young', 'carpenter', 'eye', 'girl', 'wise', 'men', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Babylonian', 'house', 'astrologers', 'include', 'traditional', 'white', 'black', 'man', 'though', 'curiously', 'one', 'Orient', 'white', 'guy', 'do', 'provide', 'few', 'lighthearted', 'elements', 'otherwise', 'safe', 'film', 'bicker', 'journey', 'Bethlehem', 'should', 'be', 'spiritual', 'one', 'arduous', 'one', 'Otherwise', 'traditional', 'elements', 'are', 'here', 'announcement', 'angel', 'visit', 'older', 'pregnant', 'cousin', 'difficult', 'wind-blown', 'trek', 'be', 'counted', 'census', 'camels', 'sand', 'dunes', 'etc.What', 'missing', 'humanity', 'other', 'versions', 'Actors', 'read', 'lines', 'much', 'conviction', 'sense', 'events', 'could', 'transpire', 'way', 'scripted', 'one', 'When', '3', 'stars', 'actually', '2', 'planets', 'mysterious', 'heavenly', 'body', 'combine', 'blinding', 'spotlight', 'accompanied', 'Star', 'Wars', 'light', 'saber', 'sound', 'effects', 'one', 'such', 'celestial', 'light', 'shows', 'were', 'run', 'mill', 'first', 'century.Every', 'movie', 'version', 'Jesus', 'story', 'bring', 'own', 'special', 'touch', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'village', 'life', 'depicted', 'loving', 'attention', 'detail', 'Entire', 'families', 'sleep', 'together', 'same', 'room', 'roofs', 'are', 'painstakingly', 'wrought', 'wattle', 'daub', 'women', 'spend', 'lots', 'time', 'toting', 'jugs', 'water', 'think', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'depict', 'Mary', 'having', 'living', 'mother', '*and*', 'father', 'people', 'Nazareth', 'act', 'true', 'peasant', 'fashion', 'holding', 'grudges', 'having', 'dirty', 'hands', 'Too', 'bad', 'movie', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'imbue', 'plot', 'dialog', 'same', 'sense', 'gritty', 'realism', 'history', 'buffs', 'might', 'grind', 'teeth', 'confusions', 'most', 'egregious', 'being', 'equation', 'Roman', 'Herodian', 'soldiers.As', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'decent', 'Sunday', 'school', 'fare', 'nothing', 'controversial', 'nothing', 'illuminating']",N/A
1044991,A2OP1HD9RGX5OW,B000MCIC24,"Jedidiah Palosaari ""Not My Real Name""","[7, 8]","It's hard to find something wrong with this movie. Mary is done by Keisha Castle-Hughes, one of the best young actresses I've seen, from the phenomenal Whale Rider. The original writing is top-notch. The directing isn't that bad either. They have really brought to life what is what like in 1st century Palestine, from the ululating zigharat at the birth of John to the cry for release from oppression of Roman taxes. This isn't Hollywood beautiful people or even white Britains in the middle of ancient Israel- these are average looking people, and very Semitic to boot. I'd imagine actually that much of the American audience would see the classic terrorist stereotype in Joseph's face. And there's even some extra action and humor thrown in.But even more than the accurate culture description was really laying out what it was like for a teenager in this situation. This was a marriage true to the culture, not aligned for the comfort of Westerners in ""falling in love"", but the typical one of the Middle East, then and now, arranged, and difficult to accept for Mary. The movie also showed what it was like for her to be suddenly told that she was giving birth. Who's going to believe this? An angel told me? Please! She faced ostracism at the least; death was more likely. She was an unwed mother at a time when it was decidedly not popular. Although I am familiar with the story, for the first time I really saw the bravery in Mary, and what she faced, following a vision that no one else had initially seen.But best of all, I hadn't realized that the movie was also filmed in Morocco. I recognized Ait Benhaddou, near Oarzazet. They actually repeatedly return to this same small village, although it becomes a number of different places through the magic of Hollywood. I'm fairly sure they also visited Toubkal as well, the highest mountain in Morocco. And I think I saw the only level stretch along that long hike up the mountain, only this time a donkey journey up from Jerusalem.It is true, some elements were not quite kosher. The ending was a bit rushed. And they left out the little bit of the Christmas Story that no one likes to talk about- for it makes Matthew and Luke difficult to harmonize. Namely the christening of Christ in Jerusalem. Honestly though, there was a reason a woman didn't reach the state of purity for seven days after birth. You ever ridden a donkey? They're better than camels, I admit. But not much. There's none of the easy canter of a horse. Now imagine that you are a woman who's just given birth. No way Mary is getting up the next day for a journey to Egypt.It's a special kind of movie that can show real life, real people, and at the same time tie me deeper into the numinous spiritual reality behind the story. Watching this, I understood better the glory of Christ, the shock and awe of His coming, and what it means to follow in His path, despised and rejected among men.",5,It's hard to find something not to like.,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2920,"['hard', 'find', 'something', 'wrong', 'movie', 'Mary', 'done', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'one', 'best', 'young', 'actresses', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'phenomenal', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'original', 'writing', 'top-notch', 'directing', ""n't"", 'bad', 'have', 'really', 'brought', 'life', 'what', 'what', '1st', 'century', 'Palestine', 'ululating', 'zigharat', 'birth', 'John', 'cry', 'release', 'oppression', 'Roman', 'taxes', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'beautiful', 'people', 'even', 'white', 'Britains', 'middle', 'ancient', 'Israel-', 'are', 'average', 'looking', 'people', 'very', 'Semitic', 'boot', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'actually', 'much', 'American', 'audience', 'would', 'see', 'classic', 'terrorist', 'stereotype', 'Joseph', 'face', 'even', 'extra', 'action', 'humor', 'thrown', 'in.But', 'even', 'more', 'accurate', 'culture', 'description', 'was', 'really', 'laying', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'teenager', 'situation', 'was', 'marriage', 'true', 'culture', 'not', 'aligned', 'comfort', 'Westerners', 'falling', 'love', 'typical', 'one', 'Middle', 'East', 'then', 'now', 'arranged', 'difficult', 'accept', 'Mary', 'movie', 'also', 'showed', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'suddenly', 'told', 'was', 'giving', 'birth', 'Who', 'going', 'believe', 'angel', 'told', 'Please', 'faced', 'ostracism', 'least', 'death', 'was', 'more', 'likely', 'was', 'unwed', 'mother', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'decidedly', 'not', 'popular', 'am', 'familiar', 'story', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'saw', 'bravery', 'Mary', 'what', 'faced', 'following', 'vision', 'one', 'else', 'had', 'initially', 'seen.But', 'best', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'Morocco', 'recognized', 'Ait', 'Benhaddou', 'Oarzazet', 'actually', 'repeatedly', 'return', 'same', 'small', 'village', 'number', 'different', 'places', 'magic', 'Hollywood', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'sure', 'also', 'visited', 'Toubkal', 'as', 'well', 'highest', 'mountain', 'Morocco', 'think', 'saw', 'only', 'level', 'stretch', 'long', 'hike', 'mountain', 'only', 'time', 'donkey', 'journey', 'Jerusalem.It', 'true', 'elements', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'kosher', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'rushed', 'left', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'one', 'talk', 'about-', 'Matthew', 'Luke', 'difficult', 'harmonize', 'Namely', 'christening', 'Christ', 'Jerusalem', 'Honestly', 'was', 'reason', 'woman', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'state', 'purity', 'seven', 'days', 'birth', 'ever', 'ridden', 'donkey', ""'re"", 'better', 'camels', 'admit', 'not', 'much', 'none', 'easy', 'canter', 'horse', 'Now', 'imagine', 'are', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'given', 'birth', 'way', 'Mary', 'getting', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'journey', 'Egypt.It', 'special', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'show', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'people', 'same', 'time', 'numinous', 'spiritual', 'reality', 'story', 'Watching', 'understood', 'better', 'glory', 'Christ', 'shock', 'awe', 'coming', 'what', 'follow', 'path', 'despised', 'rejected', 'men']",N/A

Considering the sparse details of the original narrative the writers were dealing with, I thought they did a good job of imagining some of the details without getting in the way of the story. They did not do a great job of harmonizing the Matthew and Luke accounts, but they tried. The sets looked good. Jerusalem in the distance looked a little fake at times, but the houses, the costumes, and the general milieu looked very good. The acting was good. The actress who played Elizabeth was especially good. The love relationship between Joseph and Mary was developed well.My biggest problem with the movie is the appearance of angels. They used a flying bird (not a dove) to prepare the audience for the coming and leaving of an angel. It was confusing. No angel appeared with Zacharias in the temple, just a voice and some strange moving incense smoke. There were no multitudes of hosts of angels praising God at the announcement of Christ's birth to the shepherds.The biggest plus of the movie is that they pretty much stuck to the story. For a believing Christian, there is no greater drama than the Word of God becoming flesh to live among the sons of man and save them. The movie helped the viewer to imagine how that might have happened in the warp and woof of history. It showed the geography, the grit and dust, and the human emotions. The movie is to be commended for that.

Greydanus went on to report on some clarifications offered by Avery Cardinal Dulles: ""the possibility that Mary 'could have suffered some pains in birth' may be 'compatible with Catholic doctrine.'""A review on the web site of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops describes this film as a ""Dramatization of the New Testament birth narratives from the Annunciation to the birth of Jesus, focusing on the relationship between Mary...and Joseph...and their arduous trek from Nazareth to Bethlehem, with subplots tracking the journey of the three Magi and the efforts of King Herod...to prevent the prophecy of a messiah from coming to pass. A composite of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, embroidered with apocryphal traditions and the imagination of the filmmaker, the Bible story gets the prestige treatment...with soulful performances from an excellent international cast...and impressive production design.""",5,A Beautiful Reflection on the Nativity,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,1822,"['LikeJoseph', 'Nazareth', 'foundThe', 'Nativity', 'Storyto', 'be', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'offering', 'profound', 'reflection', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'world', 'Holy', 'Family', 'lived', 'UnlikeJoseph', 'Nazareth', 'makers', 'ofThe', 'Nativity', 'Storyclearly', 'had', 'more', 'financial', 'technical', 'resources', 'disposal.The', 'Nativity', 'Storyis', 'visually', 'stunning', 'i.e.', 'A', 'review', 'web', 'site', 'U.S.', 'Conference', 'Catholic', 'Bishops', 'mentions', 'was', 'Filmed', 'Matera', 'ancient', 'Italian', 'town', 'where', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'shot', 'Passion', 'Morocco', 'also', 'incorporate', 'outstanding', 'visual', 'effects', 'article', 'Steven', 'D.', 'Greydanus', 'DecentFilms.com', 'November', '26', '2006', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'first', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'film', 'focus', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'had', 'worldwide', 'premiere', 'Pope', 'Paul', 'VI', 'Hall', 'Vatican', 'City', 'becoming', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'premiere', 'Vatican', 'Greydanus', 'went', 'report', 'clarifications', 'offered', 'Avery', 'Cardinal', 'Dulles', 'possibility', 'Mary', ""'could"", 'have', 'suffered', 'pains', 'birth', 'may', 'be', ""'compatible"", 'Catholic', 'doctrine', 'review', 'web', 'site', 'U.S.', 'Conference', 'Catholic', 'Bishops', 'film', 'Dramatization', 'New', 'Testament', 'birth', 'narratives', 'Annunciation', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'focusing', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'arduous', 'trek', 'Nazareth', 'Bethlehem', 'subplots', 'tracking', 'journey', 'three', 'Magi', 'efforts', 'King', 'Herod', 'prevent', 'prophecy', 'messiah', 'coming', 'pass', 'composite', 'Gospels', 'Matthew', 'Luke', 'embroidered', 'apocryphal', 'traditions', 'imagination', 'filmmaker', 'Bible', 'story', 'prestige', 'treatment', 'soulful', 'performances', 'excellent', 'international', 'cast', 'impressive', 'production', 'design']",N/A

I was delighted that the director followed the Bible (did not change anything) yet at the same time she fleshed out the characters and made them seem flawed and human just like the rest of us (in need of a Savior). The only mistakes in the film, and they are picky ones; is that Joseph, Mary, & Jesus flee to Egypt before the couple takes Jesus to the temple, hence Anna, the  prophetess and Simeon (Luke chapter 2) are left out of the story. Also, the Wise men's dream, not to return to Herod is left out. All in all, it is a great job.

1045000,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000MCIC24,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[12, 33]","We never thought that the greatest story ever told could be so boring and uninspiring. ""The Nativity Story"" is one of those movies that just feels ""rushed"" for the holiday season. Could this be an unexpected prequel of The Passion of the Christ? We don't really think so. Unfortunately, the film never really takes off and its problems show up right away.Story:The movie is based on biblical events. Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is a young woman who lives in Nazareth with her relatives. She is betrothed to marry Joseph (Oscar Isaac), but apparently she is not too happy about it. Suddenly while she is resting on the fields she has a vision. An angel (Alexander Siddig) tells her that she has become pregnant by the Holy Spirit. Many miles away, the three Magi research why the three bright stars in the night sky are going to unite. They can only conclude that is a sign of the birth of Christ.Joseph is not too happy about Mary after finding out that she is pregnant--apparently from somebody else. She explains to his family and Joseph the visions she saw and the reason why she became pregnant. Naturally, many people don't believe her--even close relatives and friends. There is some doubt in Joseph until he experiences a vision of his own while sleeping.Meanwhile King Herod (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) is paranoid about the prophecy that says that a new king will be born in Bethlehem and overthrow his rule. He decides to kill all the infants from the city. Jesus is born in Bethlehem in a cave-like stable and the three Magi are present to see this important event, but they cannot stay too long. The angel again appears to Joseph telling him to escape to Egypt.Review:Catherine Hardwicke--who only directed two mayor films before this one--brings us a movie that never embraces the audience because it has no drama. We get a long introduction of some of the characters that really don't advance much of the story--the three Magi is a perfect example. This is one of those movies that begin with the end. Why not start the film with Mary's first vision? Why don't we start the movie in a regular timeline? Also, the use of flashbacks could have helped to tell the story better. ""The Nativity Story"" doesn't focus much on Mary's personality. We still want to know more about her dreams and struggles, but we get none of it. Our young actress  doesn't give us any realism or drama. She says her lines with a dull voice and expressionless face. Unfortunately, Joseph is not far behind either. In short, Mary and Joseph are cardboard characters who make this film feel like a high school play.In the technical department, the movie is a disaster. ""The Nativity Story"" has the sloppiest film editing I have seen this year--scene transitions look unnatural and sometimes without a main purpose. Why do we have to hear the three Magi argue time and again? Why do they need so much screen time? An important flaw we notice is the amateur photography applied to this film. We wonder who was in charge of the camera work. This is not ""The Passion of the Christ"" where we saw great composition in its photography. The camera doesn't focus on the main subjects or adds too many. Sometimes the images we see are too high, low, far away--in other words, no right visual perspective. This kind of camera work distracts the audience and takes away the drama.The Verdict:""The Nativity Story"" doesn't even come close to the great biblical epics from the 50s and 60s. The movie had potential, but its dull characters, bad photography, ADHD directing and the ""rushed"" feeling created a boring experience. Maybe they were playing safe when they made this film. Who knows? Maybe a little controversy would have helped the movie's income. We recommend you to stay home and rent Ben Hur instead--We know it's a long film but the horse race and Charlton Heston's acting will keep you entertain for hours.",2,The Nativity Story doesn't even come close to the great biblical epics from the 50s and 60s.,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,3884,"['never', 'thought', 'greatest', 'story', 'ever', 'told', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'boring', 'uninspiring', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'one', 'movies', 'just', 'rushed', 'holiday', 'season', 'Could', 'be', 'unexpected', 'prequel', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'so', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'problems', 'show', 'up', 'right', 'away.Story', 'movie', 'based', 'biblical', 'events', 'Mary', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'Nazareth', 'relatives', 'betrothed', 'marry', 'Joseph', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'apparently', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'Suddenly', 'resting', 'fields', 'vision', 'angel', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'become', 'pregnant', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'Many', 'miles', 'away', 'three', 'Magi', 'research', 'why', 'three', 'bright', 'stars', 'night', 'sky', 'are', 'going', 'unite', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'sign', 'birth', 'Christ.Joseph', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'Mary', 'finding', 'out', 'pregnant', 'apparently', 'somebody', 'else', 'family', 'Joseph', 'visions', 'saw', 'reason', 'why', 'became', 'pregnant', 'Naturally', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'even', 'close', 'relatives', 'friends', 'doubt', 'Joseph', 'vision', 'own', 'while', 'sleeping.Meanwhile', 'King', 'Herod', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'paranoid', 'prophecy', 'new', 'king', 'will', 'be', 'born', 'Bethlehem', 'overthrow', 'rule', 'kill', 'infants', 'city', 'Jesus', 'born', 'Bethlehem', 'cave-like', 'stable', 'three', 'Magi', 'are', 'present', 'see', 'important', 'event', 'can', 'not', 'stay', 'too', 'long', 'angel', 'again', 'Joseph', 'telling', 'escape', 'Egypt.Review', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'who', 'only', 'directed', 'two', 'mayor', 'films', 'one', 'movie', 'never', 'audience', 'drama', 'get', 'long', 'introduction', 'characters', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'advance', 'much', 'story', 'three', 'Magi', 'perfect', 'example', 'one', 'movies', 'begin', 'end', 'Why', 'not', 'start', 'film', 'Mary', 'first', 'vision', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'movie', 'regular', 'timeline', 'Also', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'tell', 'story', 'better', 'Nativity', 'Story', ""n't"", 'focus', 'much', 'Mary', 'personality', 'still', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'dreams', 'struggles', 'get', 'none', 'young', 'actress', ""n't"", 'give', 'realism', 'drama', 'lines', 'dull', 'voice', 'expressionless', 'face', 'Unfortunately', 'Joseph', 'not', 'far', 'short', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'are', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'who', 'make', 'film', 'feel', 'high', 'school', 'play.In', 'technical', 'department', 'movie', 'disaster', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'sloppiest', 'film', 'editing', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'scene', 'transitions', 'look', 'unnatural', 'sometimes', 'main', 'purpose', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'hear', 'three', 'Magi', 'argue', 'time', 'again', 'Why', 'do', 'need', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'important', 'flaw', 'notice', 'amateur', 'photography', 'applied', 'film', 'wonder', 'who', 'was', 'charge', 'camera', 'work', 'not', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'where', 'saw', 'great', 'composition', 'photography', 'camera', ""n't"", 'focus', 'main', 'subjects', 'too', 'many', 'Sometimes', 'images', 'see', 'are', 'too', 'high', 'low', 'far', 'away', 'other', 'words', 'right', 'visual', 'perspective', 'kind', 'camera', 'work', 'audience', 'away', 'drama.The', 'Verdict', 'Nativity', 'Story', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'great', 'biblical', 'epics', '50s', '60s', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'dull', 'characters', 'bad', 'photography', 'ADHD', 'directing', 'rushed', 'feeling', 'created', 'boring', 'experience', 'Maybe', 'were', 'playing', 'safe', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'Who', 'Maybe', 'little', 'controversy', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'movie', 'income', 'recommend', 'stay', 'home', 'rent', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'instead', 'know', 'long', 'film', 'horse', 'race', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'acting', 'will', 'keep', 'entertain', 'hours']",N/A

1045004,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000MCIC24,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 5]","While some will argue about the inaccuracies of the film, ""The Nativity Story"" does a very fine job of expanding on the story of Jesus' birth by focusing not on the actual birth, but on the relationships between Mary, Joseph, and their neighbors, friends and family as the story unfolds. The movie begins with King Herod's slaughter of Bethlehem's oldest sons under the age of two. It then cuts back one year earlier to show us the announcement of John the Baptist's birth to his soon-to-be-mute father, Zechariah. From there, we see the day-to-day lives of people suffering under Herod's rule. We witness young Mary and her family struggle to make ends meet and to pay the taxes forced upon them by Rome. We also see Joseph ask Mary's father for her hand in marriage which, essentially, is a good business move for the family. As the rest of the story unfolds, Gabriel announces the birth to Mary, she visits and is mentored by her cousin Elizabeth, and then she returns home obviously pregnant. Not wanting any harm to come to her, Joseph refuses to announce any charges against Mary, which could lead to her death by stoning. Gabriel then visits Joseph in a dream and calms his worries. After this Joseph and Mary set out for Bethlehem following the ruling of Herod who now wants a census taken. Of course, he's secretly hoping that the census will reveal this great ""King of the Jews"" who threatens his reign.The bulk of the tale takes place on the road to Bethlehem. We see a number of trials that Mary and Joseph go through, as well as a glimpse of what might have gone through both of their heads as they awaited the arrival of Jesus. We also see the journey of the three Magi who've set out to see the prophecy of a king revealed. Although they supply a bit of light comic relief, the Magi aren't reduced to idiots.As mentioned, some liberties are taken with the story, especially during the actual birth of Jesus and the eventual flight to Egypt. One could argue for days over these points in the plot, but just know that ""The Nativity Story"" gets the story correct in all the right places.Director Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") and writer Mike Rich (""Finding Forrester"") take special care with the telling of this story. It's executed at a somewhat slow pace, but not so slow that one loses interest. Keisha Castle-Hughes does a very good job as Mary, but I feel that the real star here is Oscar Isaac as Joseph. Joseph has always been treated as something of a third wheel in many theatrical tellings of this story. In ""The Nativity Story,"" however, we get to see him not only sacrifice his standing in society by accepting a woman who appears to have had relations outside of wedlock, but we also see him as a caring, loving man willing to risk his life for a child that isn't his own. Joseph has a very key role in the birth of Our Lord, and he finally gets his well-deserved screen time here.Of note is the music in this film, which is some of the most beautiful music I've heard in a movie in a long time.The DVD presentation of this film is good, but the audio is too low at times.

Creativity, acting, direction, etc., are all still important, but perhaps most important of all is adherence to the source material:  in a word, truth.  Based on that standard, THE NATIVITY STORY succeeds admirably.  Not that traditional elements of filmmaking are sub-par or neglected--setting and period detail are superbly realized, the script is literate and complements the Scriptures from which it is derived, and the acting is excellent.  Keisha Castle-Hughes portrays a believable young woman who overcomes her doubts, fears, and disappointments to accept the awesome destiny laid upon her, while Oscar Isaac brings Joseph to life with equal realism.  Veteran actor Ciaran Hinds brings authority and menace to the role of King Herod, and the rest of the cast plays each part with respect and reverence.  Indeed, reverence permeates the whole film.  Director Catherine Hardwicke's direction is frequently understated and everything is conducted with a low-key respect for the subject matter that is most unlike the bombastic displays usually considered necessary to make a successful motion picture in today's market.  There are a few details that depart somewhat from Scripture, but for the most part the movie stays true to its Biblical roots, offering a beautiful adaptation of that silent night in a manger so long ago.  The relationship between Mary and Joseph evolves with tenderness and care, and the holiness of Jesus's birth, while surely beyond the power of any film to capture accurately, is certainly portrayed with the appropriate sobriety and gravitas.

Bernabo,"[5, 5]","I was not surprised in the wake of the phenomenal success of ""The Passion of the Christ"" that a movie would be made about the birth of Jesus.  ""The Nativity Story"" was produced by New Line Cinema and directed by Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen,"" ""Lords of Dogtown"") from a script by Mike Rich (""Radio,"" ""The Rookie,"" ""Finding Forrester"").  The strongest similarity to ""The Passion"" is that ""The Nativity Story"" tries to accurately recreate the time and the place, from the Jewish community in which Mary and Joseph live, to the political realities of the Roman occupation, to the wretched poverty of the shepherds tending their flocks by night.  The result is appropriately reverent, but it also lacks the drama and dare I say it the passion of the blockbuster that inspired it.  Still, what else could we expect?  The birth of Jesus was a prologue to his ministry, crucifixion and resurrection that half the gospels fail to mention, and at the very least this 2006 film reminds us why it is necessary.For me the pivotal scene is on the road from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where a snake attacks them as Joseph leads Mary's donkey across a river.  My immediate reaction was that they were going to far here, adding to the story something akin to when the pirates attacked the ark in the woeful television movie about Noah.  But then I rethought what was happening in the scene and had to admit that it was not that far fetched that Satan would try to prevent the birth of Christ.  Still, having a bit of action in the story of the Nativity goes against the grain, and the same can be said for the attempts to make the wise men the comic relief of the whole story.  But at least each wise man is a distinct character, because the film take the time to flesh each of them out so that they are more than the embodiment of a Christmas carol.The Gospel of Luke provides most of what we know about the birth of Jesus with the details on the Annunciation, Mary's visit to Elizabeth, the birth of John the Baptist, the enrollment requiring Joseph to take Mary to Bethlehem, and the appearance of the angels and shepherds.  It is from the Gospel of Matthew that we have an angel appearing to Joseph to tell him not to fear taking Mary as his wife, the coming of the wise men from the East, and the flight into Egypt before the infanticide ordered by Herod the Great.  Weaving these two narrative threads together is certainly not as difficult as integrating the words that Jesus spoke on the cross, so the story being told is familiar.  As you would expect the political climate is played up a bit more, as is the reaction by the family of Mary to her pregnancy, and the overall result is that to make this a feature-length film everything just takes a little longer, which serves to slow down the pace a tad too much.It is from Luke that we have Mary's acceptance of being the handmaiden of the Lord and the song of Mary (""My soul magnifies the Lord"").  It also has what is clearly the key to Mary in this film, namely that when the shepherds relate all that the angels have told them, ""Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.""  I was excited when they announced that Keisha Castle-Hughes was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for ""Whale Rider"" because I was quite moved by her performance.  But when I went back and watched the film a second time I found that except for the scene where she gives her tearful speech, a wonderful scene that will break your heart, Castle-Hughes spends most of the film saying little and staring at the other characters.  So when it comes to her character saying little and pondering instead, she certainly has the experience to play the Mary as written for this film.  But that silence does not work as well in this film and I still have a preference for the young Mary created by Olivia De Hussy in Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" although I find Maia Morgenstern's performance in ""The Passion"" to be the most memorable cinematic Mary that I have seen to date.You will not get a better sense of the relationship between Mary and Joseph (Oscar Isaac), because this film does not go far beyond what we read in Scripture.  That is probably the greatest missed opportunity here, but certainly trying to explore that relationship is fraught with peril and a risk the producers were unwilling to take.  Consequently the young actors end up being overshadowed by the more experienced members of the cast, most notably Ciaran Hinds as King Herod, Shohreh Aghdashloo as Elizabeth, and Alexander Siddig as the Angel Gabriel.  As for the irony that the unmarried 16-year-old Castle-Hughes became pregnant by her 19-year-old boyfriend of three years the same year she was playing the Virgin Mary in a movie, all I can think of if the Nativity story were to play out today is Nancy Grace demanding the law be obeyed and Mary be stoned.

While she is not happy with the arranged marriage, her life gets much more complicated when the Angel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig) appears and tells her she will bear the Messiah.Meanwhile, three Magi are studying the night sky.  As they see three stars coming together, they conclude that prophecy is being fulfilled and a great king is being born.  They set out to find this child.  And King Herod (Ciaran Hinds) continues his paranoia over his thrown.  The same prophecies worry him.  Is there a new threat to his throne?When a movie tells a familiar story, it faces an uphill battle.  It must find a way to draw the viewer into the events even though they know the outcome.  This movie almost succeeded for me.  I was pulled in most of the time watching these characters from the Biblical story brought to life.  The friends I saw it with loved it and were deeply moved by it.  At times, however, I found the low budget a bit of a distraction.The producers of the film try to present the story with as little flash as possible.  Since the story is set 2000 years ago, it mostly works.  I did spot the occasional matte painting in the background, but was willing to forgive this ""low tech"" approach.  What did bother me were scenes at the end that needed extras like the empty town of Bethlehem and the missing Angel chorus.There was much to enjoy about the movie, however.  The costumes and sets were wonderful.  Also accurate was the depiction of the times in which the story takes place.  We often forget the harsh treatment from the Romans and the consequences for both Mary and Joseph because of her pregnancy.The performances are also great.  Herod's mental illness comes through, yet he is very menacing.  The Magi are lots of fun and provide some light moments.  Absolutely perfect are Keisha Castle-Hughes and Oscar Isaac as Mary and Joseph.  They are likable, have good chemistry, and expertly show their characters' struggles.The ending of the movie is very moving as the shepherds and Magi arrive to pay tribute to Jesus.  And I'll grant the producers artistic license on this.  I doubt they were there at the same time, but it makes for a better movie.A bigger budget could have made this a better movie.  Still, it is good because it shows the human elements and consequences we tend to gloss over in our annual Christmas celebrations.",4,Low Budget But Good,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,2665,"['village', 'Nazareth', 'young', 'woman', 'Mary', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'daughter', 'struggling', 'family', 'barely', 'make', 'enough', 'eat', 'pay', 'taxes', 'when', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'come', 'town', 'why', 'when', 'Joseph', 'carpenter', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'father', 'quickly', 'accepts', 'not', 'happy', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'life', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Angel', 'Gabriel', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'will', 'bear', 'Messiah.Meanwhile', 'three', 'Magi', 'are', 'studying', 'night', 'sky', 'see', 'three', 'stars', 'coming', 'together', 'conclude', 'prophecy', 'being', 'fulfilled', 'great', 'king', 'being', 'born', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'child', 'King', 'Herod', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'paranoia', 'thrown', 'same', 'prophecies', 'worry', 'there', 'new', 'threat', 'throne', 'When', 'movie', 'familiar', 'story', 'uphill', 'battle', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'draw', 'viewer', 'events', 'even', 'know', 'outcome', 'movie', 'almost', 'succeeded', 'was', 'pulled', 'most', 'time', 'watching', 'characters', 'Biblical', 'story', 'brought', 'life', 'friends', 'saw', 'loved', 'were', 'deeply', 'moved', 'times', 'however', 'found', 'low', 'budget', 'bit', 'distraction.The', 'producers', 'film', 'try', 'present', 'story', 'as', 'little', 'flash', 'possible', 'story', 'set', '2000', 'years', 'ago', 'mostly', 'did', 'spot', 'occasional', 'matte', 'painting', 'background', 'was', 'willing', 'forgive', 'low', 'tech', 'approach', 'What', 'did', 'bother', 'were', 'scenes', 'end', 'needed', 'extras', 'empty', 'town', 'Bethlehem', 'missing', 'Angel', 'chorus.There', 'was', 'much', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'however', 'costumes', 'sets', 'were', 'wonderful', 'Also', 'accurate', 'was', 'depiction', 'times', 'story', 'place', 'often', 'forget', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'Romans', 'consequences', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'pregnancy.The', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'Herod', 'mental', 'illness', 'very', 'menacing', 'Magi', 'are', 'lots', 'fun', 'provide', 'light', 'moments', 'Absolutely', 'perfect', 'are', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'are', 'likable', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'expertly', 'show', 'characters', 'struggles.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'very', 'moving', 'shepherds', 'Magi', 'arrive', 'pay', 'tribute', 'Jesus', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'producers', 'artistic', 'license', 'doubt', 'were', 'there', 'same', 'time', 'better', 'movie.A', 'bigger', 'budget', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'Still', 'good', 'human', 'elements', 'consequences', 'tend', 'gloss', 'over', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'celebrations']",N/A

However, ""The Nativity Story"" is a truly moving depiction of the birth of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.  Rich in period detail, the movie is fairly accurate to Scripture.  We witness the beautiful unfolding of the Reincarnation, in which the Infinent, Supreme Ruler of the universe chose to be born in the most humble of circumstances  He clothed Himself in feeble flesh in order to empathize with us all, (Hebrews Chapter 2).  The Word, who, at the very beginning cried, ""Let there be light,"" (Genesis 1), now cries for His mother's milk.  How truly unfathomable and extraordinary!I was skeptical when I rented this film, but my misgivings were quickly dispelled.Israel struggles to survive under the weight of Roman oppression and the tyrannical rule of King Herod the Great, (a ruthless dictator who will attempt to thwart anyone foolish enough to threaten his power).  In the midst of this turmoil, a young virgin girl is given a momentous task.  God has chosen her to bear the Deliverer of the world.  Mary is betrothed to a carpenter named Joseph.  Will doubts and evil plots destroy all, or will God Almighty prevail?The most striking aspect of this film is the beautiful way God utilizes humble people and circumstances to fulfill His plan.  His plans contrast startlingly with the power-hungry individuals who rule through planting seeds of fear and disstruction.  I am reminded of 1 Corinthians 1:24, where the Apostle Paul states, ""God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the strong, and the foolish things of the world to confound the wise"".  He uses people we least expect to carry out His plans.  The treatment of the Magi was particularly moving as we see how Gentiles exhibited strong faith in seeking the newborn King simply on the basis of a star.  We also see how the shepherds, who were considered outcasts, were some of the first to worship the King of Kings.The acting in this film is truly extraordinary.  Keisha Castle-Hughes beautifully conveys Mary's strength and vulnerability.  She is frightened yet willing to trust and say yes.  Oscar Isaacs is mesmerizing as Joseph.  His quiet persona cannot mask his inner strength and beauty as he portrays a touching tenderness toward Mary.  Often, Joseph is ignored, but he is truly a strong individual who was given a tremendous task.  The most touching scene of the film is a conversation in which Mary and Joseph discuss their roles as earthly parents to God's only Son.  Joseph wonders, ""Will I be able to teach him anything"".  We see that these two courageous individuals struggled with the same dilemmas faced by all parents.  Their faith stands as a true testimony of God's provision.  He placed His Son in the best family to raise Him.Please give this phenomenal film a chance.

Our savior was born on that blessed day to save all mankind, and this movie really captures the story of the first Christmas.  And so does the scriptures...And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Agustus, that all the world should be taxed.(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem: (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.And the angel said unto them, fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.For unto you is born this day in the city of David a saviour, which is Christ the Lord.And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.Luke 2:1-14If you're interested, read all of Matthew 2.

1045038,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B000MCIC24,moviemusicbuff,"[7, 7]","I saw this movie when it first came out on a private screening.  It is a very faithful adaptation of the biblical account of the birth of Christ.  The producers, the screenwriter (Mike Rich, ""Finding Forrester"") and the director (Catherine Hardwicke, ""Thirteen"") are all very accomplished.  It is by far the best movie adaptation of the Nativity story.The good:1) Keisha Castle-Hughes does a marvelous job of portraying Mary, the mother of Jesus. She is able to capture the spiritual maturity of the mother of the Savior.  Oscar Isaacs also does a great job of portraying the righteous Joseph.  His love and sensitivity toward Mary is very apparent. What I found most fascinating about this movie is the portrayal of the relationship between Mary and Joseph.  Initially, Mary is hesitant about her betrothal to Joseph, but as time progresses, she begins to warm up and eventually love & respect her husband.  This movie also portrays very well the dilemma between Mary and Joseph regarding her awkward pregnancy during their betrothal period -- how the different family members reacted toward the news, and Mary's great faith in God.  Also, the scene where Joseph and Mary arrive in Bethlehem, and they are frantically looking for a place to stay is very well-done.2) The other notable actor is Ciaran Hinds, who does a great job of portraying the cruelty, cunning, and paranoia of King Herod.3) The 3 Wise Men offer comic relief in this movie, but their portrayal seems to be copied from the ""Jesus of Nazareth"" portrayal of the 3 Wise Men with one of the Wise Men being African, one Middle-Eastern, and one European.4) There is a lot of care to make the movie look as authentic as possible.  One can tell that there was a lot of research done to make sure the clothes, housing, and village life seem to reflect what is known about small-town Jewish life during the time of Jesus.5) The music is beautiful.  There are wonderful arrangements of famous hymns interspersed with original music.The not-so good:1) The pacing of the movie could have moved along faster. It seemed pretty slow in the middle.2) If the movie really wanted to be accurate to the biblical account, most likely there were more than 3 astrologers (wise men), and these wise men visited the Christ-child after His birth when He was living in a house.

1045043,A2TZNPWHFZFO5Z,B000MCIC24,Nappaland.com,"[5, 7]","Plot Summary: Christ is born...Reason for the Rating: Some violent content.When I saw the trailer for The Nativity Story, I was excited. Finally, a movie that would tell the story of Christ's birth, and one that was not animated or made on a terminally low budget. I mean, it was being released by New Line Cinema (which has released movies of all kinds from Wedding Crashers and A History of Violence, to The Notebook). The screenplay was written by Mike Rich (Finding Forrester), and stars Keisha Castle-Hughes (The Whale Rider) as Mary.After watching an early screening of the film, however, I must admit that I came away with mixed feelings. Is it a cinematically high quality film about the birth of Christ? Yes. Is it the visual masterpieces that it has been hyped up to be? Well, no. At least not in this reviewer's opinion.We all know the story of Christ's birth--how an angel visited Mary and told her she had been chosen to bear God's son, Jesus. How she travels to visit her cousin, Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist, and has her angelic visit confirmed. She and Joseph traveled to Bethlehem because of the census, and Jesus was born there in a stable. We know an angel appeared to the shepherds, who then came to see Jesus in the manger, and the three wise men followed a star to find the Christ child.But, as you have read the Christmas account, did you ever think what it must have been like for Mary? She was only a child herself, 13 or 14 years of age. Sure, the angel appeared to her, but not to her parents. Can you imagine what that conversation must have been like? How does a young teenager handle that kind of emotional turmoil? This is one reason I was so looking forward to seeing The Nativity Story, and it is also one of the reasons I was disappointed in the movie.The Mary portrayed in this movie is stoic and hides all emotion. The only reason we know she was feeling much of anything, is because of her narration. Most innocent teenage girls I know would cry if her parents misunderstood and accused them of sleeping around. In the movie, Mary simply tells her parents, ""I've told the truth. It's your choice whether you believe it.""If you are a Christmas purist, you may also be disappointed with the movie, as there are several inaccuracies. For instance, the angel who appears to Mary, Joseph, and the shepherd (he only appears to one shepherd in the movie) is a sad representation of an angel. There really was no reason for him to say, ""Do not be afraid,"" because he was anything but awe-inspiring (other than his awfully bad hair). He is also the only angel in the movie. No angelic host filling the sky when the shepherd is told of Christ's birth. And the three wise men are the traditional Gasper, Melchior, and Balthazar.However, if you can look past these issues and some poor accents, the movie is still the best nativity movie made to date. The character of Joseph is touching, and it is heart-breaking to see such a gentle, upright man realize he will be the father to God on earth (""What can I teach him?""), and to accept this role with honor. His love and acceptance of Mary, despite the shame her situation brought on him, is beautiful. He really must have been an amazing man who God picked to be Christ's father here on earth. Joseph and Mary's relationship is one that is often overlooked in the Christmas story, but one that has much to teach us about honor, respect, and love.Additionally, this movie is steeped in historical facts. Much detail is given to King Herod and his thirst for power and fear of being overthrown. The traditions of the day and hardships of life are realistically shown throughout the movie. You will come away with a sense of what it was like to live during this time, as well as the political harshness Joseph and Mary lived under. You will be impressed when you consider all they endured prior to Christ's birth, and how emotional it must have been to see the face of God in a small baby.MOVIEBLOG RECOMMENDS:While the special effects and some biblical detail are missing, this is a movie that will get your family in the true spirit of Christmas, and spark conversation about what it really must have been like that first Christmas.AFTER THE SHOW:* Do you think this was a realistic portrayal of Mary's reaction? How would you react in this situation?* In what ways did this movie help you see the details of Christmas differently? Explain.* God could have chosen for his son to be born any way possible. Why do you think he chose for him to be born in obscurity, with not even a mid-wife to help with the birth?JW",4,A [...] Review,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,4608,"['Plot', 'Summary', 'Christ', 'born', 'Reason', 'Rating', 'violent', 'content.When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'was', 'excited', 'Finally', 'movie', 'would', 'tell', 'story', 'Christ', 'birth', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'animated', 'made', 'terminally', 'low', 'budget', 'mean', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'released', 'movies', 'kinds', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'Notebook', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Mike', 'Rich', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'stars', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'Mary.After', 'watching', 'early', 'screening', 'film', 'however', 'must', 'admit', 'came', 'away', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'cinematically', 'high', 'quality', 'film', 'birth', 'Christ', 'Yes', 'visual', 'masterpieces', 'been', 'hyped', 'up', 'be', 'Well', 'least', 'not', 'reviewer', 'know', 'story', 'Christ', 'birth', 'how', 'angel', 'visited', 'Mary', 'told', 'had', 'been', 'chosen', 'bear', 'God', 'son', 'Jesus', 'How', 'visit', 'cousin', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'pregnant', 'John', 'Baptist', 'angelic', 'visit', 'confirmed', 'Joseph', 'traveled', 'Bethlehem', 'census', 'Jesus', 'was', 'born', 'there', 'stable', 'know', 'angel', 'appeared', 'shepherds', 'who', 'then', 'came', 'see', 'Jesus', 'manger', 'three', 'wise', 'men', 'followed', 'star', 'find', 'Christ', 'child.But', 'have', 'read', 'Christmas', 'account', 'did', 'ever', 'think', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Mary', 'was', 'only', 'child', '13', '14', 'years', 'age', 'Sure', 'angel', 'appeared', 'not', 'parents', 'Can', 'imagine', 'what', 'conversation', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'How', 'young', 'teenager', 'handle', 'kind', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'one', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'also', 'one', 'reasons', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie.The', 'Mary', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'stoic', 'emotion', 'only', 'reason', 'know', 'was', 'feeling', 'much', 'anything', 'narration', 'Most', 'innocent', 'teenage', 'girls', 'know', 'would', 'cry', 'parents', 'misunderstood', 'accused', 'sleeping', 'around', 'movie', 'Mary', 'simply', 'parents', ""'ve"", 'told', 'truth', 'choice', 'believe', 'are', 'Christmas', 'purist', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'inaccuracies', 'instance', 'angel', 'who', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'shepherd', 'only', 'one', 'shepherd', 'movie', 'sad', 'representation', 'angel', 'really', 'was', 'reason', 'say', 'Do', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'was', 'anything', 'awe-inspiring', 'other', 'awfully', 'bad', 'hair', 'also', 'only', 'angel', 'movie', 'angelic', 'host', 'filling', 'sky', 'when', 'shepherd', 'told', 'Christ', 'birth', 'three', 'wise', 'men', 'are', 'traditional', 'Gasper', 'Melchior', 'Balthazar.However', 'can', 'look', 'issues', 'poor', 'accents', 'movie', 'still', 'best', 'nativity', 'movie', 'made', 'date', 'character', 'Joseph', 'touching', 'heart-breaking', 'see', 'such', 'gentle', 'upright', 'man', 'realize', 'will', 'be', 'father', 'God', 'earth', 'What', 'can', 'teach', 'accept', 'role', 'honor', 'love', 'acceptance', 'Mary', 'shame', 'situation', 'brought', 'beautiful', 'really', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'man', 'who', 'God', 'picked', 'be', 'Christ', 'father', 'here', 'earth', 'Joseph', 'Mary', 'relationship', 'one', 'often', 'overlooked', 'Christmas', 'story', 'one', 'much', 'teach', 'honor', 'respect', 'love.Additionally', 'movie', 'steeped', 'historical', 'facts', 'Much', 'detail', 'given', 'King', 'Herod', 'thirst', 'power', 'fear', 'being', 'overthrown', 'traditions', 'day', 'hardships', 'life', 'are', 'realistically', 'shown', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'live', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'political', 'harshness', 'Joseph', 'Mary', 'lived', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'when', 'consider', 'endured', 'prior', 'Christ', 'birth', 'how', 'emotional', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'face', 'God', 'small', 'baby.MOVIEBLOG', 'RECOMMENDS', 'special', 'effects', 'biblical', 'detail', 'are', 'missing', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'family', 'true', 'spirit', 'Christmas', 'spark', 'conversation', 'what', 'really', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'Christmas.AFTER', 'THE', 'SHOW', '*', 'Do', 'think', 'was', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'Mary', 'reaction', 'How', 'would', 'react', 'situation', '*', 'what', 'ways', 'did', 'movie', 'help', 'see', 'details', 'Christmas', 'differently', 'Explain', '*', 'God', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'son', 'be', 'born', 'way', 'possible', 'Why', 'do', 'think', 'chose', 'be', 'born', 'obscurity', 'not', 'even', 'mid-wife', 'help', 'birth', 'JW']",N/A

This gritty, realistic, and generally orthodox film about the Nativity is highly recommended for its attention to such detail, and to its dogmatic assertions:  one of the Magi proclaims the Child as ""God made flesh,"" which isn't strictly scriptural but true nonetheless.  No, not everything is perfect from an Orthodox point of view.  The angel Gabriel, for example, should have been depicted, as is traditional, as a young man, not a bearded guy.  The Magi probably came later.  The film faithfully has the shepherds hear (but just from one angel, alas) that ""you will find Him lying in a manger,"" but when they arrive, the Child is in His mother's arms.  Small stuff, this, given that the film is the best depiction I've seen of the Nativity.

1045054,AX5EPK0DQP23Z,B000MCIC24,Paul Wake,"[4, 6]","Most of the previous reviewers (who have reviewed the movie itself rather than the DVD, which isn't out yet) have done a fine job of reviewing the movie.  I consider their reviews accurate, and I too loved the movie.  Yes, the critics you'll read in the newspapers find the movie boring.  That's because they find religion boring and offensive.  For people who believe in Jesus Christ rather than James Bond, going to the theater this Christmas season to see The Nativity Story, and then buying it for future Christmas seasons, is a really good idea.  I'd hesitated to go based on who directed the film, but it turned out well (if you get too picky about perfection in directors and actors, you miss great films like The End of the Spear).  Not perfectly (I'm not sure, for example, that the Wise-Men-as-comedy-troupe works so well), but very well, especially as a story not just about baby Jesus but also about Mary and Joseph.I write simply to address the question one person asked about whether the movie is appropriate for preteens.The movie begins with Herod's soldiers raiding Bethlehem to kill the male babies.  No babies get sliced up onscreen, but it's clear that is what is happening in the town.  It might be too intense for some kids, as might be a scene where a daughter is forcibly taken away by the Romans in payment of taxes.  It's definitely not at the intensity of The Passion of the Christ, though (a great movie that I can't imagine taking preteens to see).  There's also a circumcision scene, in which anyone who knows anything about Jewish traditions knows what is happening to the baby, and that would make anyone cringe.  There are also passing shots of people who have been crucified.  Overall, the movie's pacing is slow but builds to a good climax.  Interspersed are some realities of biblical life.  I took my kids, who range from 8 up, and would have regretted not taking them.  The bishop of my LDS congregation recommended the movie without reservation.  But there may be some preteens who would do better without seeing it.  You know your kids best.

1045055,A3PT0PHUY3RC1F,B000MCIC24,P. Kennedy,"[1, 2]","This movie provides an excellent recap of the lives of Mary and Joseph leading up to Jesus's birth.  As with most movies, there are some minor inconsistencies between the story reflected in the movie and what is written in the New Testament.  One such inconsistency is how the story tells about the three magi who are following the signs from the stars in hopes of Jesus's birth.  According to the New Testament (Matthew 2:10), ""When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.""  Once they noticed the stars lined up while on their horses, they seemed more at peace than overly excited.  Additionally, according to the movie these three magi were close to Bethlehem the night of his birth and followed the light from the three stars to find the newborn child.  However, according to the New Testament (Matthew 2:11), the magi (an unidentified number) actually went to Mary and Joseph's house and fell down to worship him, then presented the gifts.  They probably chose to show the magi that same night to go along with the story as it is familiarly retold.  Another example of a part of the movie that seems a bit off is when Mary is shown in the movie to witness John's birth and then returns home but in Luke 1:56, Mary returns home and in Luke 1:57, Elizabeth gives birth.Nevertheless, overall I believe it was very realistic and fairly close to what is recorded in the New Testament.  For example, King Herod's rule and the Roman oppression seemed accurately portrayed, especially during the scenes of innocent killing, tax collections, and ordering the census.  The angel appearing for Zechariah, Mary, Joseph and the shepherds seemed accurately represented according to the Bible as well.  Even the part where Zechariah was unable to talk due to him not believing the angel in the temple and then later having to write his son's name, John, on the tablet which suddenly allowed his tongue to loosen is as mentioned in Luke, chapter 1.",5,A wonderful story,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,1957,"['movie', 'excellent', 'recap', 'lives', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'leading', 'up', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'minor', 'inconsistencies', 'story', 'reflected', 'movie', 'what', 'written', 'New', 'Testament', 'One', 'such', 'inconsistency', 'how', 'story', 'three', 'magi', 'who', 'are', 'following', 'signs', 'stars', 'hopes', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'According', 'New', 'Testament', 'Matthew', '2:10', 'When', 'saw', 'star', 'rejoiced', 'exceedingly', 'great', 'joy', 'noticed', 'stars', 'lined', 'up', 'horses', 'seemed', 'more', 'peace', 'overly', 'excited', 'Additionally', 'according', 'movie', 'three', 'magi', 'were', 'close', 'Bethlehem', 'night', 'birth', 'followed', 'light', 'three', 'stars', 'find', 'newborn', 'child', 'However', 'according', 'New', 'Testament', 'Matthew', '2:11', 'magi', 'unidentified', 'number', 'actually', 'went', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'house', 'fell', 'down', 'worship', 'then', 'presented', 'gifts', 'probably', 'chose', 'show', 'magi', 'same', 'night', 'go', 'along', 'story', 'familiarly', 'retold', 'example', 'part', 'movie', 'bit', 'off', 'when', 'Mary', 'shown', 'movie', 'witness', 'John', 'birth', 'then', 'home', 'Luke', '1:56', 'Mary', 'home', 'Luke', '1:57', 'Elizabeth', 'birth.Nevertheless', 'overall', 'believe', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'fairly', 'close', 'what', 'recorded', 'New', 'Testament', 'example', 'King', 'Herod', 'rule', 'Roman', 'oppression', 'seemed', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'especially', 'scenes', 'innocent', 'killing', 'tax', 'collections', 'ordering', 'census', 'angel', 'appearing', 'Zechariah', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'shepherds', 'seemed', 'accurately', 'represented', 'according', 'Bible', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'part', 'where', 'Zechariah', 'was', 'unable', 'talk', 'due', 'not', 'believing', 'angel', 'temple', 'then', 'later', 'having', 'write', 'son', 'name', 'John', 'tablet', 'suddenly', 'allowed', 'tongue', 'loosen', 'as', 'mentioned', 'Luke', 'chapter', '1']",N/A

A family discussion occurs and Marys father asks if she slept with one of Herod's soldiers (A veiled reference to Panthera who supposedly slept with Mary). Mary denies she slept with a Roman Soldier.My Comment: Celsus, an influential 2nd-century Platonist of Alexandria and perhaps the first serious critic of Christianity (Encarta) is the source of this falsehood about Panthera and Mary. This has also been featured on In Search of Christmas on The History Channel.Disney owns the History Channel and other broadcasters that have spread biblically inaccurate information. Mike Rich, this films screenwriter, also wrote Disney's ""The Rookie."" Mary went with Ruth, a family friend, to visit Elizabeth. Mary's Parents arranged her entire trip (in the film) so Mary did not travel with anyone but what was pre-arranged. Why would Mary's Father ask the question if ""he"" arranged the entire trip? Where else would this idea come but from Celsus - Disney/Mike Rich/History Channel program and then dropped into the film?- Mary accepted a palm reader as normal?- Mary encountered the Angel in the Wilderness?- Herod is tormented by a prophecy about the new coming King who will defeat him.My Comment: It was not until the Magi arrived in Jerusalem that Herod was concerned about this new King and sought to kill the male infants (Matthew 2:1-3). The Magi DO NOT enter Jerusalem until the last 15 minutes of the film and meet with Herod. Why is Herod concerned prior to the Magi's arrival about a prophecy he has not yet heard?- The Magi ""followed"" the star in the film or did they?My Comment: The star did not appear in the film until the Magi were on their way. So what did they follow? Hmm? See Matthew 2:2 > ""For we have seen the star in the East.."" See also 2:9.- When Mike Rich, screenwriter of The Nativity Story, was interviewed by radio host Hugh Hewitt a few weeks ago he was asked if the Apocryphal Gospels would be used in the film. Mike Rich said no.My Comment: Both Anna and Joachim, Mary's parents in the film, are from the Apocryphal Gospels not from the New Testament books of Luke or Matthew.- Only one shepherd is told about Jesus' birth by an angel yet many shepherds go to see the newborn.My Comment: How did the other shepherds learn about this if only one shepherd was told by an angel about Jesus' birth? The shepherd did not relay this information to others in the film yet they all went to the cave to see Jesus. Okay? The Magi visit the cave the very night Jesus was born. Not Biblical. Note: See Matthew 2:11- Herod Antipas, the son of King Herod, states ""the sons of Bethlehem shall be no more"" in the film.My Comment: Biblically speaking Bethlehem and the surrounding areas were hit by the soldiers not just Bethlehem.

The fact that it's now in Blu-ray, and the higher resolution makes the scenes jump off the screen. Whoever remastered this did a fie job.As for the film itself, my opion hasn't changed. It brings out two aspects of the Nativity story that are just about never shown. The first is how people must have reacted to Mary's pregnancy when the baby was obviously not her husband's. This is done without dialog -- just the shocked expressions on peoples' faces as they see her upon her return.The second aspect concerns Joseph. He is usually just that (not very important) guy kneeling next to the manger, definitely a small supporting role -- to use William Goldman's phrase, &#34;the Elisha Cook Jr. part.&#34; Here Joseph is brought to the fore. After being visited by the angel, he ignores other opinions (and no doubt derision) and accepts both Mary and her unborn child. He protects Mary and the child, going without food so Mary, the baby and the animal carrying them can eat.All this is told in a very low-key fashion, and the film is more powerful for it.

1045068,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000MCIC24,Samuel McKewon,"[7, 11]","It's called ""The Nativity Story,"" and the filmmakers deliver just that: A reverent, pastoral, handsome retelling of the birth of Jesus Christ and the faith of his virgin mother, Mary.Most details contained in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke are here: King Herod's paranoid, angry rule, the three magi who foresee the birth of Jesus, the shepherds in the field, guided by an angel to a manger. Even the birth of John The Baptist to Elizabeth, Mary's relative.But an added bonus of Mike Rich's screenplay is a fuller insight into Mary's husband, Joseph, portrayed here by Oscar Isaac as a shy, generous man who handpicks Mary for her virtue - thrown into question when she starts to show.Driven by a vision from an angel to stick by Mary, Joseph is compelled by God to claim the child as his own and give Jesus his name. The journey to Bethlehem, and Jesus' birth, occupies the last half of ""The Nativity Story"" and offers the couple a chance to bond. In an unguarded moment, Joseph looks at Mary and says: ""I don't know what I'll be able to teach him.""Keisha Castle Hughes (""Whale Rider"") plays Mary in the (slightly unfortunate) cinematic tradition of solemn, otherworldly stoicism. She carries inside her the most significant prophecy in the history of the world, and she greets this news with a reverential bow, pursed lips and a solitary tear. She meets her father's accusations of promiscuity with a steady gaze that would have impressed Charlton Heston.Is this an accurate portrait of Mary's faith? It's certainly one we see in films. ""The Nativity Story"" isn't dry, but it reflects what some critics call ""Hallmark"" sentimentality because it never finds a way to ground Mary in feelings that, as a girl, she must have felt. This was a kid, just that, in physical turmoil, confusion and danger. She didn't just spend the last three weeks centering herself at some Samaritan Zen institute.Yes, Mary's ""certitude"" is important - it's the mark of her spiritual character - and Hughes channels that. But divine faith  translated as eternal calm and enlightenment is not exactly a picture of relational Christianity. Jesus was no stiff; he weeps and loves and laughs and eats and preaches throughout the four Gospels. He lived a full emotional life.So, presumably, did Mary. God gave her a preeminent responsibility, but it didn't involve living on some higher emotional plane. It's a shame that Hughes - who was actually pregnant during the shoot - sits on a donkey for 100 miles, mildly winded, slightly distressed. I mean, think about it. She must have suffered greatly. The journey stunk.Maybe because director Catherine Hardwicke captured adolescence so effectively in ""Thirteen"" and ""The Lords of Dogtown"" I expected a fuller portrayal. But, even as an inspired choice for this material, her directing choices show the weight of the project and the expectations, taking the safest, most traditional route. She dials down her camera tricks of excessive, out-of-nowhere zooms, favoring wide desert vistas.They look great. They've looked great in a lot of epic films, though. And the movie's accuracy is impressive - Bethlehem is little more than a collection of rock huts set against a low plateau. ""The Nativity Story"" also establishes an endearing relationship toward animals, specifically that donkey.Truth is, the movie has a lot of little smiles, and most families, for whom this movie intended, aren`t going to have these same mild criticisms.

What is particularly special about this film is the simple way the characters and their lives are portrayed. These were poor, humble people just trying to get by in hard times. In the midst of all that, God decides to send his son. It's a powerful statement on how God uses even the humblest and ""lowest"" of people to carry out his mission.Mary and Joseph are perfectly cast, and I can't imagine anyone else in those roles. Kudos to the filmmakers for casting actors of appropriate ages. Keisha Castle-Hughes was 15 when she filmed this, and Mary wasn't much older than that (and was probably younger). And Joseph is a young man in his 20's who ends up being a perfect match for her. The way their relationship grows is subtle and touching.Like most classic Christmas movies before it, this movie didn't do well during its initial theatrical run.

It was real life. Every day life. And it really happened. To ordinary people. And not within the space of 2 hours, either. They actually had to live this stuff out -- day by day by grueling day. And so I really appreciated how the movie gets that idea across withOUT the usual Hollywood pyrotechnics, FX & swelling orchestral music score ...I also like the way the movie weaves all the many & various threads of all the many & various lives together in a way that really makes sense -- which is a picture that's hard for most people to get, no matter how many times they've read the Biblical accounts. So, in that sense, the movie really does succeed in bringing the nativity story to life in a way that I've never seen done before.And seeing the little ""baby Jesus"" being lifted up did make me cry, because it made me come to terms with the fact that -- at one time -- He was just that little, just that vulnerable, just that in need of someone to take care of Him & -- WOW -- can you imagine the awesome responsibility? And (although the movie didn't come right out & say it) the Magi's expensive gifts did make Mary/Joseph/Jesus' flight to Egypt possible & was a powerful reminder to me of how God STILL provides for us when we're in desperate need ...And so the movie does work on many different levels & probably needs to be seen a few times in order to fully appreciate the numerous nuances.

1045072,A15DMWRBLGW7C5,B000MCIC24,Sheridan Claude,"[1, 2]","The Nativity kept remarkably close to the biblical account of the birth of Christ, with a few excepts. For instance, the film dramatized a potentially dangerous river crossing when Mary and Joseph were heading for Bethlehem. But the story drew me in and gave me a wonderful insider's view of the whole awesome reality of Jesus' birth.The nativity portion of the story was a traditional, and incorrect, rendition, with the Magi arriving at the manger just after the arrival of the shepherds. Speaking of the Magi, they provided some comic relief with their verbal interchanges; relief that was needed because of the tense nature of the overall story.The film is high quality, with superb costuming, acting, and cinematography. It's not a cheap imitation. But I was disappointed with the announcement of the angels to the shepherds. They could have filled the night sky with angels, and showed a number of astonished, shocked shepherds. Instead, they used only one angel that stood on a hilltop, and one shepherd's reaction. It was a place they could have been biblically over the top, and they scaled it down.One last thing: the birth of the Christ child was tastefully done, while maintaining a strong sense of reality. Excellent acting! It brought me to tears.I highly recommend this film.

1045074,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000MCIC24,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","The title of ""The Nativity Story"" says it all: the tale of Jesus's birth, from Mary's early meetings with Joseph, through the angel's prophecies, and all the way to the Bethlehem manger.  Boasting great production and one of the most authentic feels for a historic tale, ""The Nativity Story"" captures a lot of different moods of the time: a dark and desperate atmosphere for the depiction of life under a tyrant (in this case King Herod) to magic-feeling, inspirational moments, and a surprisingly large dose of playfulness and humor.  A lot of the gentle humor comes from the depiction of the Three Kings following the Star Of Bethlehem.  Handled wrong, inserting a lot of comedy into their voyage and dialogues could have come off tacky, but here it adds very nicely to the overall picture.  The characters of Mary and Joseph are developed exceptionally well.  Also of note is the superior cinematography, brilliantly capturing the rugged, magnificent beauty of the Middle East.  Very nice musical score too, and a momentous finale that ranks high in the pantheon of movie climaxes.A lot of people say this movie is too 'restrained' or subtle.  I disagree.  When filiming an epic, there's a time to go in with lots of bombast and big visuals, like with ""Star Wars"" or ""Chronicles Of Narnia"" or ""Lord Of The Rings"", but there's also a time to step back a bit and go slower, with a few less big dramatic impacts, and a bit more focus on capturing the day-to-day context in which the big events take place.  The former approach worked smashingly on the other movies mentioned, and the latter works smashingly here.  Fans of Keisha Castle-Hughes's performance as Mary will probably want to check outWhale Rider, another great movie; and if you enjoy The Nativity Story I really recommendJesus, the 2000 tv mini-series, which has never gotten the full credit it's due.",5,One Of The Greatest Historic Epics - 10/10,1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,1865,"['title', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'tale', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'Mary', 'early', 'meetings', 'Joseph', 'angel', 'prophecies', 'way', 'Bethlehem', 'manger', 'Boasting', 'great', 'production', 'one', 'most', 'authentic', 'feels', 'historic', 'tale', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'lot', 'different', 'moods', 'time', 'dark', 'desperate', 'atmosphere', 'depiction', 'life', 'tyrant', 'case', 'King', 'Herod', 'magic-feeling', 'inspirational', 'moments', 'surprisingly', 'large', 'dose', 'playfulness', 'humor', 'lot', 'gentle', 'humor', 'depiction', 'Three', 'Kings', 'following', 'Star', 'Bethlehem', 'Handled', 'wrong', 'inserting', 'lot', 'comedy', 'voyage', 'dialogues', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'tacky', 'here', 'very', 'nicely', 'overall', 'picture', 'characters', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'are', 'developed', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Also', 'note', 'superior', 'cinematography', 'brilliantly', 'capturing', 'rugged', 'magnificent', 'beauty', 'Middle', 'East', 'Very', 'nice', 'musical', 'score', 'too', 'momentous', 'finale', 'high', 'pantheon', 'movie', 'climaxes.A', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'movie', 'too', ""'restrained"", 'subtle', 'disagree', 'When', 'filiming', 'epic', 'time', 'go', 'lots', 'bombast', 'big', 'visuals', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'also', 'time', 'step', 'back', 'bit', 'go', 'slower', 'few', 'less', 'big', 'dramatic', 'impacts', 'bit', 'more', 'focus', 'capturing', 'day-to-day', 'context', 'big', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'former', 'approach', 'worked', 'smashingly', 'other', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'latter', 'works', 'smashingly', 'here', 'Fans', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'performance', 'Mary', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'check', 'outWhale', 'Rider', 'great', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'really', 'recommendJesus', '2000', 'tv', 'mini-series', 'never', 'gotten', 'full', 'credit', 'due']",N/A

The greatest story ever told has been with us for almost 2000 years, and it will never get any better than this.  Only the angelic ""ruckus"" over Bethlehem that holy night, was missing from this film.I have 1150 DVD American and Foreign movies in my collection. I just watched ""The Nativity Story"" and was enthralled with its simple beauty. Like the 1979 movie ""Jesus"" (with Brian Deacon), I was very happy to see it was not shot on a Hollywood lot, and its principle cast looked the part. They looked Jewish. There was not one cockney or British accent detected.  There was no more than a few out of place blue-eyes in the entire movie.The young girl (Keisha) who played the humble young Jewish girl Mary did an amazing job. Casting was superb all around. The movie did justice to Joseph, as a good, patient, honest, sincere, caring, God-loving man. Also, it did not merely toss aside the arduous 100+ mile trek from Nazareth to Bethlehem either. In this movie, I somehow felt I was an ""eye-witness"" to the privileged feeling even the struggling donkey who carried the holy mother and blessed Savior must have felt.I liked how the movie did not skip over the huge dilemma holy Mary must have faced when she had to present herself to her betrothed husband, her family and her village --already with child. And it gave us a good peek into Jewish village life during this period. Also, this excellent movie touched on the tumultuous times God had picked to arrive, in order to offer Himself as a korban (sacrificial lamb); for the lost sheep of Israel.Who will believe it?  The greatest of kings. Born in the humblest of places.... God, born in the flesh!For unto us a Child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder: and his name will be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Isaiah 9:6 (written: 712 BC - Before Christ)This is a timeless story, and an excellent movie; I will always cherish. It is among the top in my collection now.

The only real major fault with the film is in portrarying the wise men as coming to visit Jesus the night of Jesus' birth.  Most scholars believe the wise men probably came quite a bit later.  The Gospel of Matthew does not dwell on the birth of Jesus. Matthew simply records ""After Jesus was born..."" Magi from the east came..."" asking about the birth.  Then King Herod began to search the scriptures to pinpoint the birth.  He then relied on the Magi to go to Bethlehem to search out the child who had been born.  The Magi found Joseph, Mary and Jesus in a ""house,"" and not the stable where Jesus had been born.  The Magi were then warned in a dream not to go back to Herod.  When they didn't return Herod gave orders to kill all boys in Bethlehem who were ""two years old and under"" in an apparent attempt to kill Jesus.

I also loved the beautiful scene , when Jesus was born! I just loved the three wise men! I just wished that the movie lasted longer! In this movie I realized how special and good Mary and Joseph where, and how devoted they where to God!  This movie gives you the reasons why God chose Mary and Joseph, to be Jesus's parents here on earth!

1045086,A3LY48PLYZQEBB,B000MCIC24,Terrie L. Yow,"[0, 2]","Movie Review - The Nativity StoryThe Nativity Story is a moving recount of the life of Mary and Joseph and the events before and during the selection as parents to God's only Son. The movie depcits their struggles and long journey that ends in a lowly stable located in Bethlehem where the miracle birth of Jesus, Christ and Savior to the world, takes place.Christianity is based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The message of love resonates through His entire ministry. Although crucified in His early thirties for a crime he did not commit, His teachings continued through the devotion of His twelve disciples and the many people whose lives He touched. By giving His life, Jesus saved the world and provided salvation to those who seek it. Through the blood that he shed, all who believe in Him will have everlasting life. Three days after His crucifixion, Jesus arose from the dead. During this time, he spent much time consoling and encouraging his disciples to continue their mission of spreading the gospel. Many of His teachings and life stories can be found in the books of Matthew, Luke, Paul, and John, from the New Testament. The ministry of Christ is still very much alive today as Christians all over the world celebrate His life and practice his teachings.The script focuses largely on Mary and her struggles of carrying this miracle child. How is she supposed to explain her pregnancy, when being pregnant outside of marriage is considered a disgrace? To complicate matters further, she must try to explain how she became pregnant while still a virgin.The movie starts off a little slow, but has a strong ending. It is a very good film choice for the entire family and will be especially memorable to watch around the Christmas holiday season.",4,The Nativity Story,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,1770,"['Movie', 'Review', 'Nativity', 'StoryThe', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'moving', 'recount', 'life', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'events', 'selection', 'parents', 'God', 'only', 'Son', 'movie', 'struggles', 'long', 'journey', 'lowly', 'stable', 'located', 'Bethlehem', 'where', 'miracle', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Savior', 'world', 'place.Christianity', 'based', 'life', 'teachings', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'message', 'love', 'resonates', 'entire', 'ministry', 'crucified', 'early', 'thirties', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'teachings', 'continued', 'devotion', 'twelve', 'disciples', 'many', 'people', 'lives', 'touched', 'giving', 'life', 'Jesus', 'saved', 'world', 'provided', 'salvation', 'who', 'seek', 'blood', 'shed', 'who', 'believe', 'Him', 'will', 'have', 'everlasting', 'life', 'Three', 'days', 'crucifixion', 'Jesus', 'arose', 'dead', 'time', 'spent', 'much', 'time', 'consoling', 'encouraging', 'disciples', 'continue', 'mission', 'spreading', 'gospel', 'Many', 'teachings', 'life', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'books', 'Matthew', 'Luke', 'Paul', 'John', 'New', 'Testament', 'ministry', 'Christ', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'today', 'Christians', 'world', 'celebrate', 'life', 'practice', 'teachings.The', 'script', 'largely', 'Mary', 'struggles', 'carrying', 'miracle', 'child', 'How', 'supposed', 'explain', 'pregnancy', 'when', 'being', 'pregnant', 'marriage', 'considered', 'disgrace', 'complicate', 'matters', 'further', 'must', 'try', 'explain', 'how', 'became', 'pregnant', 'still', 'virgin.The', 'movie', 'off', 'little', 'slow', 'strong', 'ending', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'choice', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'especially', 'memorable', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'season']",N/A

We are grateful to the director, Catherine Hardwicke, for giving us a beautiful film which shows us the Holy Family in its vulnerable humanity -- menaced by the civil authorities of the day, subject to the gossiping malice of their fellow townsfolk, awed by the great mystery that has involved them and embraced them.I had read a review of this film, before seeing it, which faulted the portrayal of Our Lady as ""pouty, sullen, and frowning.""  Ms Castle-Hughes gives us a very human Blessed Virgin Mary, but a Mary in which there are glimpses of the boldness appropriate to the Queen of Heaven, as Catholics would denominate her -- ""incomparably more glorious than the seraphim"" but incontrovertibly, one of us, in all things except sin.  Oscar Isaac, who portrays St Joseph, is quite convincing in his role as protector of Our Lady and her Divine Son.I was led to expect (from the review that I had read) a deficit of reverence before the sacred mysteries of salvation.  This is, I am relieved to report, not the case.  ""The Nativity Story"" is indeed reverent before the grandeur of the great events of Christian history -- although we do find Alexander Siddig's Angel Gabriel a bit ""earthy"" for an angel! -- and it is also unflinching in its depiction of what life was like for oppressed Jews in the occupied Holy Land.The phrase with which I would sum up ""The Nativity Story"" is: Unstereotyped piety.  It is earthy in a way that, for this viewer, serves to accentuate the holiness of the participants in this history.  The makers of the film have afforded us an opportunity to meditate upon these joyful and solemn mysteries; and, for that, we are most grateful.

1045088,A3QUTLN2YLW30Z,B000MCIC24,Thomas Zabiega,"[12, 21]","This is truly a very inspiring and emotional movie, beautifully produced.  However, there are several problems with it that make it an incompletely Christian movie, and especially any Catholic or Orthodox Christian (who believe Mary is without sin) should be wary about it.  First of all, Mary in the movie initially acts like a brat when confronted with the fact she will marry Joseph.  Even the most imperfect Jewish girl in ancient times would not have showed such disrespect to her parents, especially in times where every culture had arranged marriages.  So, sin #1 for Mary (breaking the 4th Commandment).  Then the scene when Mary and Joseph meet a fortune teller in Jerusalem, and Mary allows her to read her palm.  Mary does not reject the prediction of the fortune teller, but simply feels sad for Joseph that the fortune teller knows the child is not his biologically.  Earth to the Christian director of this movie:  this is the breaking of the 1st Commandment.  Going to a fortune teller was a sin for Jews in those times, and is a mortal sin for Christians today, as we cannot have false gods telling us the future.  In fact, this is so dangerous that experienced exorcists say going to a fortune teller is one of the few ways a person can open themselves up to the devil, even to possession.  So would Mary allow for something like that?  Even a somewhat immoral Jewish girl would have thought twice, so the Blessed Virgin Mary would have never done something so sinful.  That is why I cannot own this movie and can only show fragments of it to my children.  That is sad, because the movie is quite beautiful, but the producers didn't do their homework.",2,"Touching movie, but dangerous for uncatechized Christians",1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,1668,"['truly', 'very', 'inspiring', 'emotional', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'However', 'are', 'several', 'problems', 'make', 'incompletely', 'Christian', 'movie', 'especially', 'Catholic', 'Orthodox', 'Christian', 'who', 'believe', 'Mary', 'sin', 'should', 'be', 'wary', 'First', 'Mary', 'movie', 'initially', 'brat', 'when', 'confronted', 'fact', 'will', 'marry', 'Joseph', 'Even', 'most', 'imperfect', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'ancient', 'times', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'showed', 'such', 'disrespect', 'parents', 'especially', 'times', 'where', 'culture', 'had', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'So', 'sin', '1', 'Mary', 'breaking', '4th', 'Commandment', 'Then', 'scene', 'when', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'meet', 'fortune', 'teller', 'Jerusalem', 'Mary', 'read', 'palm', 'Mary', 'not', 'reject', 'prediction', 'fortune', 'teller', 'simply', 'feels', 'sad', 'Joseph', 'fortune', 'teller', 'child', 'not', 'biologically', 'Earth', 'Christian', 'director', 'movie', 'breaking', '1st', 'Commandment', 'Going', 'fortune', 'teller', 'was', 'sin', 'Jews', 'times', 'mortal', 'sin', 'Christians', 'today', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'false', 'gods', 'telling', 'future', 'fact', 'so', 'dangerous', 'experienced', 'exorcists', 'say', 'going', 'fortune', 'teller', 'one', 'few', 'ways', 'person', 'can', 'open', 'up', 'devil', 'even', 'possession', 'So', 'would', 'Mary', 'allow', 'something', 'Even', 'somewhat', 'immoral', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'twice', 'Blessed', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'something', 'so', 'sinful', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'own', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'show', 'fragments', 'children', 'sad', 'movie', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'homework']",N/A

1045090,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000MCIC24,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[2, 4]","Almost everything I heard about this film was wrong. I went expecting mediocrity, and what I got was what I would consider to be one of the finest examples of an intelligent Christian film yet. This is the first movie about the Bible that I am aware of that actually gives the story a Middle Eastern setting. Everything else ever done either caters to Catholicism, making it far too Western in look and feel; or is woefully void of any knowledge of Eastern culture whatsoever. This film makes the viewer feel he really is in the land where these events took place, and that these really are the people that made them happen.Catherine Hardwicke (direction), Mike Rich (screenplay) and company have done their homework well. Almost every scene is an authentic and powerful picture (kudos to the art department): from Zechariah's revelation in the Holy of Holies, to the Persian wise men in their observatory, to the plotting of the two Herods in their palace, to continual confrontations with the Roman soldiers in the streets, to Mary and Joseph passing through Jerusalem on their way to Bethlehem, to examples of the humble pastoral existence of the Nazarene peasants. Every scene seems like that must have been the way it looked.One of my few complaints is with the cinematography. I don't know the name of the technique, but it is a high-contrast, blue-black effect that I assume is supposed to make the film seem more documentary. In Gladiator, it helped create a dark, ominous mood for the Roman sections. Except for the scenes in Jerusalem, no such mood was required in this film. By sucking all the warm colors out of a scene, it turned potentially beautiful shots into something cold and photo journalistic. I found it hard to look at, and thought it took away from the overall beauty of the film.Rich's screenplay is excellent, not only for it's faithfulness to the Biblical text, but for the intelligent way he filled in the gaps with meaningful dialogue that revealed the thoughts and feelings of the characters. I had never thought about how it would have appeared for Mary to return from Elizabeth's, pregnant - either for her or Joseph. There was great shame to both of them, and this was handled well in the script. I like the way Mary and Joseph talk about what it will be like to raise such a child, and how scared they are. I also like the way the writer and director showed Joseph's character by having him buy back the donkey for Mary's father; how he went without food on their journey so he'd have enough for Mary and the donkey; how he protected Mary from pickpockets in Jerusalem; and how he saved her life in the river. Those are the types of details that flesh out a character and make him seem real.The acting is no less powerful than the visuals and script. My favorite actor was Oscar Isaac (Guerrilla) as Joseph - although everyone was superb, including Keisha Castle-Hughes (Whale Rider) as Mary and Shohreh Aghdashloo (House of Sand and Fog) as Elizabeth. It's the little things that make a performance memorable. I especially liked the fortune-teller in the Jerusalem marketplace that stopped and spoke with Mary and Joseph, and the shepherd on the hill that they stopped and spoke with. I thought Herod was sufficiently menacing. I could feel the evil in the Jerusalem Temple area, and the hypocrisy in the priests as they sacrificed the bull. There was almost no one that wasn't 100% believable to me.This is very intelligent filmmaking - not brilliant, but intelligent; and, except for the lack of color in the cinematography as I noted, a very enjoyable film. But it is also a powerful story, and does not drag as some have said. It is a bit on the dark side - as is life - and therefore I would not recommend it for the little kiddies. But for older kids (perhaps ten and up) and adults, it will be a memorable experience, and hopefully a tradition for many years to come.Waitsel Smith",5,"WELL DONE, INTELLIGENT CHRISTIAN FILM",1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,3922,"['Almost', 'everything', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'wrong', 'went', 'expecting', 'mediocrity', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'examples', 'intelligent', 'Christian', 'film', 'yet', 'first', 'movie', 'Bible', 'am', 'aware', 'actually', 'story', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'setting', 'Everything', 'else', 'ever', 'done', 'caters', 'Catholicism', 'making', 'far', 'too', 'Western', 'look', 'feel', 'woefully', 'void', 'knowledge', 'Eastern', 'culture', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'viewer', 'feel', 'really', 'land', 'where', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'really', 'are', 'people', 'made', 'happen.Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'direction', 'Mike', 'Rich', 'screenplay', 'company', 'have', 'done', 'homework', 'well', 'scene', 'authentic', 'powerful', 'picture', 'kudos', 'art', 'department', 'Zechariah', 'revelation', 'Holy', 'Holies', 'Persian', 'wise', 'men', 'observatory', 'plotting', 'two', 'Herods', 'palace', 'continual', 'confrontations', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'streets', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'passing', 'Jerusalem', 'way', 'Bethlehem', 'examples', 'humble', 'pastoral', 'existence', 'Nazarene', 'peasants', 'Every', 'scene', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'few', 'complaints', 'cinematography', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'technique', 'high-contrast', 'blue-black', 'effect', 'assume', 'supposed', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'documentary', 'Gladiator', 'helped', 'create', 'dark', 'ominous', 'mood', 'Roman', 'sections', 'scenes', 'Jerusalem', 'such', 'mood', 'was', 'required', 'film', 'sucking', 'warm', 'colors', 'scene', 'turned', 'potentially', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'something', 'cold', 'photo', 'journalistic', 'found', 'hard', 'look', 'thought', 'took', 'away', 'overall', 'beauty', 'film.Rich', 'screenplay', 'excellent', 'not', 'only', 'faithfulness', 'Biblical', 'text', 'intelligent', 'way', 'filled', 'gaps', 'meaningful', 'dialogue', 'revealed', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'characters', 'had', 'never', 'thought', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'appeared', 'Mary', 'return', 'Elizabeth', 'pregnant', 'either', 'Joseph', 'was', 'great', 'shame', 'was', 'handled', 'well', 'script', 'way', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'talk', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'raise', 'child', 'how', 'scared', 'are', 'also', 'way', 'writer', 'director', 'showed', 'Joseph', 'character', 'having', 'buy', 'back', 'donkey', 'Mary', 'father', 'how', 'went', 'food', 'journey', ""'d"", 'have', 'enough', 'Mary', 'donkey', 'how', 'protected', 'Mary', 'pickpockets', 'Jerusalem', 'how', 'saved', 'life', 'river', 'are', 'types', 'details', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'make', 'seem', 'real.The', 'acting', 'less', 'powerful', 'visuals', 'script', 'favorite', 'actor', 'was', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Guerrilla', 'Joseph', 'everyone', 'was', 'superb', 'including', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'Mary', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'Elizabeth', 'little', 'things', 'make', 'performance', 'memorable', 'especially', 'liked', 'fortune-teller', 'Jerusalem', 'marketplace', 'stopped', 'spoke', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'shepherd', 'hill', 'stopped', 'spoke', 'thought', 'Herod', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'menacing', 'could', 'feel', 'evil', 'Jerusalem', 'Temple', 'area', 'hypocrisy', 'priests', 'sacrificed', 'bull', 'was', 'almost', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'believable', 'me.This', 'very', 'intelligent', 'filmmaking', 'not', 'brilliant', 'intelligent', 'lack', 'color', 'cinematography', 'noted', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'also', 'powerful', 'story', 'not', 'drag', 'have', 'said', 'bit', 'dark', 'side', 'life', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'little', 'kiddies', 'older', 'kids', 'perhaps', 'ten', 'up', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'memorable', 'experience', 'hopefully', 'tradition', 'many', 'years', 'come.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
