1422639,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B004O26L9O,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","One of the best revenge dramas I have ever seen. Brutal and compelling and shot in the seedier parts of Austin, Texas by British director Simon Rumley on a very low budget, it's enhanced by the very fine cast (which includes some respected though not very famous actors, including Noah Taylor playing niftily against character). The movie is about essentially a love (or perhaps death) triangle: Nate, an Iraq war veteran in his thirties who looks edgy and might be somewhat disturbed and Franki, a drummer in an upcoming garage band are the men whose life is intersected through Erica, an attractive girl whose life is a mess working at odd jobs as well as the occasional gig as a prostitute. A sexually transmitted disease will unleash a terrible mayhem of death and revenge. I don't want to add more about the plot, but the results can be brutal in the extreme, even if the climactic act of violence is shot off camera. Starts somewhat slow, and it takes its time to develop its plot, but the third and final act will leave everyone speechless.",5,"Terrific revenge drama, though not for the squeamish",1309996800,"07 7, 2011",2011,1047,"['One', 'best', 'revenge', 'dramas', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Brutal', 'compelling', 'shot', 'seedier', 'parts', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'British', 'director', 'Simon', 'Rumley', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'enhanced', 'very', 'fine', 'cast', 'respected', 'not', 'very', 'famous', 'actors', 'including', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'playing', 'niftily', 'character', 'movie', 'essentially', 'love', 'perhaps', 'death', 'triangle', 'Nate', 'Iraq', 'war', 'veteran', 'thirties', 'who', 'edgy', 'might', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disturbed', 'Franki', 'drummer', 'upcoming', 'garage', 'band', 'are', 'men', 'life', 'intersected', 'Erica', 'attractive', 'girl', 'life', 'mess', 'working', 'odd', 'jobs', 'as', 'well', 'occasional', 'gig', 'prostitute', 'sexually', 'transmitted', 'disease', 'will', 'unleash', 'terrible', 'mayhem', 'death', 'revenge', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'add', 'more', 'plot', 'results', 'can', 'be', 'brutal', 'extreme', 'even', 'climactic', 'act', 'violence', 'shot', 'off', 'camera', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'time', 'develop', 'plot', 'third', 'final', 'act', 'will', 'leave', 'everyone', 'speechless']",N/A

If this were a clearer story about a victim dying a terrible death at the hands of criminals who then went on to smear her reputation posthumously by claiming that she slept around, it wouldn't change how absolutely breathtaking and satisfying Noah Taylor's vengeance is.It's no accident that he was cast as the ultimate protagonist because he is that much more inherently attractive and charming than his opponents.  Even when he is living in a trailor outside Tomb Raider's mansion, Noah Taylor had great screen presence and it really shows here.  He doesn't have to be bulky or loofah'd up to be compelling and believable as The Punisher.It was an instructive experience watching the last part of the film and not having any sympathy for the transgressors and their families because they clearly went after Erica and treated her as badly as possible because they believed that no one would come after them on her behalf.

1422641,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004O26L9O,C. Sawin,"[9, 10]","Rarely is a film able to be both enticing and disturbing. There have been some pretty messed up films the past few years like Antichrist and A Serbian Film. Other than Antichrist having gorgeous cinematography, genital mutilation is probably what you'll take away from it while A Serbian Film shows you the affects it could have on someone forced to make a snuff film against their will. I Saw the Devil is a great example of being both brutal in content and absolutely engaging thanks to fantastic performances and a well-thought-out revenge plot. Now imagine having the last act of a film containing subject matter as unnerving as the violence in I Saw the Devil but leaving a little more to your imagination while the first two acts remind you of something straight out of an Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu film and you've got Red White & Blue in a nutshell.When Red White & Blue first gets going, you probably won't really know what to think. Some chick is just running around having sex with a handful of various men every night? So what? But it's deeper than that. Once Nate (Noah Taylor) enters the picture, things begin to get a little more interesting. Does Nate really seem like the type of guy to get honorably discharged from the army, get an offer for a CIA job, and spend his time thinking it over while working at a home improvement store? You'll have to be the judge of that yourself. His admiration for Erica (Amanda Fuller) is one of the driving factors of the film though. Then Franki (Marc Senter) works his way into the equation, as well. He thought he was having a one-night stand with Erica that no one would ever know about, but it turned into something that would haunt him for the rest of his life. Franki is in a band with his three best friends that seems to be on the up-and-up while his mom is battling cancer, but things begin to go downhill at a rapid pace once Franki's girlfriend reveals she cheated on him. An unflinching drama slowly snowballs into a revenge thriller that'll jump to the next scene right when you're on the verge of cringing.The film does a fantastic job of reeling you in and making you care about these characters over the course of its hour and forty minute duration. Amanda Fuller plays up Erica having intimacy issues to near perfection as her awkward body language and inability to fight off bursting to tears whenever a man wants to do anything more with her than have sex defines her character far more than simple words ever could. Noah Taylor's Nate is a bit of a mystery. He comes off as odd at first, but he becomes a man on a mission. He'll go to great lengths to get what he wants and his savagery along with his brutality easily makes his performance the highlight of the film. Marc Senter's disturbing and mesmerizing performance in The Lost made a fairly long-lasting impression on me. At least long enough for me to recognize him in this film. Franki is a similar character and Senter's performance is just as captivating despite how deranged his character really is.Red White & Blue will more than likely make you go through a wide spectrum of reactions. It'll start off with a ""What the hell is this?"" that'll transition to, ""Damn, and I thought I was a jerk,"" before ending with, ""So yeah, gangbangs probably aren't a very good idea..."" The film takes an engrossing story and manages to tell it by encompassing several different genres; drama, mystery and thriller with a few horror elements for good measure. Add a fantastic cast that works as a cohesive unit that also doesn't allow for any hiccups and you've got one helluva film on your hands. Red White & Blue is some of the best storytelling to be told on film in quite some time.",4,Unflinching and extraordinary,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,3728,"['Rarely', 'film', 'able', 'be', 'enticing', 'disturbing', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'messed', 'up', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Antichrist', 'A', 'Serbian', 'Film', 'Other', 'Antichrist', 'having', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'genital', 'mutilation', 'probably', 'what', ""'ll"", 'take', 'away', 'A', 'Serbian', 'Film', 'affects', 'could', 'have', 'someone', 'forced', 'make', 'snuff', 'film', 'will', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'great', 'example', 'being', 'brutal', 'content', 'absolutely', 'engaging', 'thanks', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'well-thought-out', 'revenge', 'plot', 'Now', 'imagine', 'having', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'containing', 'subject', 'matter', 'as', 'unnerving', 'violence', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'leaving', 'little', 'more', 'imagination', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'remind', 'something', 'straight', 'Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Red', 'White', 'Blue', 'nutshell.When', 'Red', 'White', 'Blue', 'first', 'going', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'chick', 'just', 'running', 'around', 'having', 'sex', 'handful', 'various', 'men', 'night', 'what', 'deeper', 'Once', 'Nate', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'picture', 'things', 'begin', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'Does', 'Nate', 'really', 'seem', 'type', 'guy', 'get', 'honorably', 'discharged', 'army', 'get', 'offer', 'CIA', 'job', 'spend', 'time', 'thinking', 'working', 'home', 'improvement', 'store', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'judge', 'admiration', 'Erica', 'Amanda', 'Fuller', 'one', 'driving', 'factors', 'film', 'Then', 'Franki', 'Marc', 'Senter', 'way', 'equation', 'as', 'well', 'thought', 'was', 'having', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Erica', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'know', 'turned', 'something', 'would', 'haunt', 'rest', 'life', 'Franki', 'band', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'be', 'up-and-up', 'mom', 'battling', 'cancer', 'things', 'begin', 'go', 'downhill', 'rapid', 'pace', 'once', 'Franki', 'girlfriend', 'cheated', 'unflinching', 'drama', 'slowly', 'revenge', 'thriller', ""'ll"", 'jump', 'next', 'scene', 'right', 'when', ""'re"", 'verge', 'cringing.The', 'film', 'fantastic', 'job', 'reeling', 'making', 'care', 'characters', 'course', 'hour', 'forty', 'minute', 'duration', 'Amanda', 'Fuller', 'up', 'Erica', 'having', 'intimacy', 'issues', 'near', 'perfection', 'awkward', 'body', 'language', 'inability', 'fight', 'off', 'bursting', 'tears', 'whenever', 'man', 'do', 'anything', 'more', 'have', 'sex', 'defines', 'character', 'far', 'more', 'simple', 'words', 'ever', 'could', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'Nate', 'bit', 'mystery', 'off', 'odd', 'first', 'man', 'mission', ""'ll"", 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'get', 'what', 'savagery', 'brutality', 'easily', 'performance', 'highlight', 'film', 'Marc', 'Senter', 'disturbing', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'Lost', 'made', 'fairly', 'long-lasting', 'impression', 'least', 'long', 'enough', 'recognize', 'film', 'Franki', 'similar', 'character', 'Senter', 'performance', 'just', 'captivating', 'how', 'deranged', 'character', 'really', 'is.Red', 'White', 'Blue', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'make', 'go', 'wide', 'spectrum', 'reactions', ""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'What', 'hell', ""'ll"", 'transition', 'Damn', 'thought', 'was', 'jerk', 'ending', 'So', 'yeah', 'gangbangs', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'film', 'engrossing', 'story', 'manages', 'tell', 'encompassing', 'several', 'different', 'genres', 'drama', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'few', 'horror', 'elements', 'good', 'measure', 'Add', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'cohesive', 'unit', 'also', ""n't"", 'allow', 'hiccups', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'helluva', 'film', 'hands', 'Red', 'White', 'Blue', 'best', 'storytelling', 'be', 'told', 'film', 'quite', 'time']",N/A

1422643,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B004O26L9O,Douglas King,"[5, 5]","Since I am only the second person to review this film, it's clear that it's not very well known. I had never heard of it when I stumbled upon it, and, while watching it, was surprised by a number of things: first and foremost, how good it is, how unpredictable the story is, and also how horribly grim it ends up being.The film first introduces the audience to Erica, a promiscuous, damaged woman with seemingly no social connections. She is seen engaging in random sexual encounters, rebuffing any kind of real warmth and affection, until she takes a job at a hardware store and tentatively starts a friendship with fellow employee and veteran Nate. This part of the film is really rather sweet, and it seems like it's going to be the kind of story where two damaged people are redeemed by love.The film then shifts its focus to one of the characters first introduced in the beginning of the film, when Erica was ""partying"" with several members of a local rock band. Franki, the lead singer, is trying to balance both his band's early success with his mother's cancer and having to work dead end jobs. Unfortunately, during this section of the film, Franki's life takes a huge turn for the worse when both his health and that of his mother's are severely threatened, and the character's meltdown leads to a series of tragic events. Franki's storyline is then tied back to that of Erica and Nate, and it's clear that, instead of a series of vignettes about characters who only meet peripherally, there is really just one story at play here.To give much more away would be a crime, because one of the best things about the film is that it offers constant surprises. I will say that, despite (or maybe even because of) moments of tenderness and genuine human interaction, the film ends up a grim, grisly affair, albeit one that is well acted, written, and directed enough to make it worth a watch if you've got the stomach for such things.

As a matter of fact, given the average mediocre reviews from the Amazon users, (who tend to be a kind lot) I'm trying to remember what caused me to rent this in the first place.Here's the scoop. Erica goes around sleeping with essentially everyone. She will do so 1 time only. No relationships, names or anything else that will put her closer than arms length to anyone. She gets a job at a home improvement store where she meets the Noah Taylor character Nate. Things do change a bit for her. Then an earlier character, Franki (a rock musician) re-emerges because she has made an indelible and long lasting impression on him and everything changes for everyone involved.As this started out I liked it a lot. I liked the characters I was meeting. Amanda Fuller does a great job as Erica. She looks like a rough-edged Ellen Page. Noah Taylor has been good in everything I've seen him in and he's no less effective here. Something didn't work for me with Marc Senter's Franki though. I'm not certain what it was but he seemed ""off."" What put me off was the hairpin turn. This starts out as Erica's story. You meet her, see what she's about and you get a whiff of where things can and might go. Then the Franki character comes back into the picture and it turns into an entirely different movie. Then something happens at the very end that threw me for a loop. Either I wasn't paying attention or this thing flew in from left field. All I can say is it left me scratching my head.This was shot on the cheap. No fancy anything here. Just writing and acting. The music was generally good but maybe a bit over-wrought at times.

I'm not entirely sure what would have brought that out; there were a lot of little bits, rather than one big ice floe, that kept the great film under; some places where the script could have used some attention (there's a scene between Erica and Nate towards the end of the film's first chapter where the dialogue is just howlingly bad), a few pieces of casting that seemed just a tiny bit off, a handful of places where maybe the lighting could have been better or the sound design was a touch off. Nothing major, for the most part. It's like a really good thriller got stuck in a cloud of gnats.The film is told in three loose ""chapters"", and follows three main characters. First is Erica (Creature's Amanda Fuller), what would have been termed in the old days a loose woman (in the extreme). She is the subject of the first chapter; after we see a few of these encounters, she meets Nate (Almost Famous' Noah Taylor), a shady character who offers her a job at a hardware megastore and slowly finds his way behind all the walls she's put up against friendship by revealing a number of his own secrets (it should be obvious within three conversations what he's getting at, but just in case you're slow on the uptake, I won't spoil it for you). The second chapter gives us Franki (The Lost's Marc Senter), the singer of a local band on the brink of stardom who we met in the opening scene (the whole band got themselves an offer from Erica, and with one exception, they all took her up on it). He has a very sick mother, we're never quite sure with what (but we know it involves chemo and him donating blood on a regular basis for her to use), and he and his now-estranged father are not at all on good terms since his father found himself a new bimbo, but otherwise, things are looking up...until he gets a piece of information that puts him, and the rest of the band, on a collision course with Erica once again, leading to the third chapter. Things get, shall we say, a little out of control.There have been the inevitable comparisons with...a certain film. Telling you which would spoil the entire second half of the movie, so I won't (though read any other five random reviews of the film and you're bound to see it), and they are in some ways warranted  despite a major role reversal and this film going on considerably longer post-the events that invite the comparison.  But Red White and Blue is its own movie, and it's usually possible to see that very good film that this could easily have been with maybe one more rewrite, a little more attention to detail, some better pacing (I'm blaming the editing room, not the script, this time), maybe a few key personnel changes behind the camera (a really hotshot cinematographer would have done wonders here). On the other hand, it's got one of the best soundtracks since Charles Pinion's Twisted Issues, the three principals all turn in strong performances (Taylor is the best of the lot, which doesn't surprise me; he's got more experience than the other two combined), and Simon Rumley knows where to put a camera to make things work about as well as they can in any given scene. There's a good deal to like about this movie; I just saw a lot of potential throughout that was almost--but not quite--realized. That does not mean you should not see this film. Quite the opposite. This is a good thriller that could have been top-notch. ***",3,"Potential, but much of it unrealized.",1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,3555,"['Red', 'White', 'Blue', 'Simon', 'Rumley', '2010', 'Simon', 'Rumley', 'Red', 'White', 'Blue', 'often', 'lurking', 'just', 'surface', 'great', 'film', 'straining', 'be', 'released', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'out', 'were', 'lot', 'little', 'bits', 'rather', 'one', 'big', 'ice', 'floe', 'kept', 'great', 'film', 'places', 'where', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'attention', 'scene', 'Erica', 'Nate', 'towards', 'end', 'film', 'first', 'chapter', 'where', 'dialogue', 'just', 'howlingly', 'bad', 'few', 'pieces', 'casting', 'seemed', 'just', 'tiny', 'bit', 'handful', 'places', 'where', 'maybe', 'lighting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'sound', 'design', 'was', 'touch', 'off', 'Nothing', 'major', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'good', 'thriller', 'got', 'stuck', 'cloud', 'gnats.The', 'film', 'told', 'three', 'loose', 'chapters', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'First', 'Erica', 'Creature', 'Amanda', 'Fuller', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'termed', 'old', 'days', 'loose', 'woman', 'extreme', 'subject', 'first', 'chapter', 'see', 'few', 'encounters', 'Nate', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'shady', 'character', 'who', 'job', 'hardware', 'megastore', 'slowly', 'way', 'walls', 'put', 'up', 'friendship', 'revealing', 'number', 'own', 'secrets', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'three', 'conversations', 'what', 'getting', 'just', 'case', ""'re"", 'slow', 'uptake', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'second', 'chapter', 'Franki', 'Lost', 'Marc', 'Senter', 'singer', 'local', 'band', 'brink', 'stardom', 'who', 'met', 'opening', 'scene', 'whole', 'band', 'got', 'offer', 'Erica', 'one', 'exception', 'took', 'up', 'very', 'sick', 'mother', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'know', 'chemo', 'donating', 'blood', 'regular', 'basis', 'use', 'now-estranged', 'father', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'terms', 'father', 'found', 'new', 'bimbo', 'otherwise', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'up', 'piece', 'information', 'rest', 'band', 'collision', 'course', 'Erica', 'once', 'again', 'leading', 'third', 'chapter', 'Things', 'get', 'shall', 'say', 'little', 'control.There', 'have', 'been', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'certain', 'film', 'Telling', 'would', 'spoil', 'entire', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'read', 'other', 'five', 'random', 'reviews', 'film', ""'re"", 'bound', 'see', 'are', 'ways', 'warranted', 'major', 'role', 'reversal', 'film', 'going', 'considerably', 'longer', 'post-the', 'events', 'invite', 'comparison', 'Red', 'White', 'Blue', 'own', 'movie', 'usually', 'possible', 'see', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'maybe', 'one', 'more', 'rewrite', 'little', 'more', 'attention', 'detail', 'better', 'pacing', ""'m"", 'blaming', 'editing', 'room', 'not', 'script', 'time', 'maybe', 'few', 'key', 'personnel', 'changes', 'camera', 'really', 'hotshot', 'cinematographer', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'wonders', 'here', 'other', 'hand', 'got', 'one', 'best', 'soundtracks', 'Charles', 'Pinion', 'Twisted', 'Issues', 'three', 'principals', 'turn', 'strong', 'performances', 'Taylor', 'best', 'lot', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'got', 'more', 'experience', 'other', 'two', 'combined', 'Simon', 'Rumley', 'where', 'put', 'camera', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'given', 'scene', 'good', 'deal', 'like', 'movie', 'just', 'saw', 'lot', 'potential', 'was', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'realized', 'not', 'mean', 'should', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'opposite', 'good', 'thriller', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'top-notch', '***']",N/A

After thinking about it for a while though, I've come to the conclusion that this is a highly unlikeable movie...by design. Some people will be able to appreciate it on it's own terms, however these people are probably in the minority in my humble opinion.I generally really enjoy films that are on the darker end, thematically. So after reading the synopsis and some glowing reviews, I was very excited to see this one. I sat down to watch it...and I felt like I was waiting for something deep and interesting to develop, but it never did.Here are the two things that doomed this film for me from the start:-An extremely unlikeable cast of main characters.-Vague storytelling that fails to entice or invoke a sense of mystery like it's trying to.With the above aspects in mind...everything else just failed to 'click' for me. I found that I didn't care at all what happened to these people, so when moments arised that were supposed to be thrilling and tense, they fell a little flat.I don't doubt that a few people will find redeeming qualities here...I simply did not. Certainly not a horrible movie, I was just expecting so much more.2.25/5.",2,Didn't quite work for me...,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,1188,"['wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'thinking', 'while', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'highly', 'unlikeable', 'movie', 'design', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'own', 'terms', 'however', 'people', 'are', 'probably', 'minority', 'humble', 'opinion.I', 'generally', 'really', 'enjoy', 'films', 'are', 'darker', 'end', 'thematically', 'So', 'reading', 'synopsis', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'one', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'felt', 'was', 'waiting', 'something', 'deep', 'interesting', 'develop', 'never', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'doomed', 'film', 'start', '-An', 'extremely', 'unlikeable', 'cast', 'main', 'characters.-Vague', 'storytelling', 'entice', 'invoke', 'sense', 'mystery', 'trying', 'to.With', 'above', 'aspects', 'mind', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'failed', ""'click"", 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'people', 'so', 'when', 'moments', 'arised', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'thrilling', 'tense', 'fell', 'little', 'flat.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'few', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'here', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'Certainly', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'expecting', 'so', 'much', 'more.2.25/5']",N/A
