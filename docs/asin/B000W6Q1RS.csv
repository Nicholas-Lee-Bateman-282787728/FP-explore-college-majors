This is a remarkably clever series which, sadly, ends after Season Three.Most of the same loons from Season One are carried over into Season Two, but some new faces are introduced into this Vancouver apartment house setting with its microcosm of idiosyncratic personalities.The same salty language and thematic frankness that appeared in Season One re-occurs in Season Two, but somehow it's not offensive, just honest.  It's not a show for children, largely because most of it will be over their heads.I found Season One to be extremely humorous; however, the smile factor of Season Two is not quite as high.  Having said that, the viewer needs to watch Season Two in order to progress to Season Three which is right back to the top of its game.After watching this series I got on the computer to see if there is anything more forthcoming from Robson Arms.  Alas, after Season Three, there's not.

The show is very funny, and helps fill my void of all things Canada here south of the border. Each week focuses on a different tenant and their story and laughter ensues.
