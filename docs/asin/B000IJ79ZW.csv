The 30 minute workout puts all of the elements you learned in the instructional section together.  The 60 minute workout, puts it all together, but at a faster pace. This is great if you want to learn a dance routine.

1020865,AU0LLORGK9IDR,B000IJ79ZW,Julie H. Rose,"[22, 23]","I have to agree with ""YogaGirl"" about the music, but it's all a matter of taste! I find the music so awful that, I too, quit the workout.  I only got 15 minutes into it.  I love to dance but the music has to inspire me. If I want to move my hips, I think I'd do better to put on a Prince or James Brown CD and forgo any instruction!I thought, from the description on the DVD box, that this was more of a ballet-type workout, so I was dissapointed.Anyway, if you feel you need instruction in simple jazz dance, want a workout and aren't picky about your music (or like ""Broadway style jazz"", you'll probably like it.  Obviously, other reviewers do.I doubt I'll ever use it again, and even tho' I didn't pay much for it, I feel like I've wasted my money.I wanted to write this review, because I've bought various workout DVDs based on reviews, and I've come to see that it's SO VERY MUCH a matter of taste.

1020870,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B000IJ79ZW,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[8, 8]","YogaGirl wrote a great review. I can only add:Patricia has a GREAT personality with never ending patience & passion for dancing. She really makes sure you get everything right to really copy the dancers down to keeping that arm really straight, which knee should be bent, etc.The set is simple hardwood with the back wall being one big huge fake window showing a tropical jungle view & huge stone underneath.There are two workouts: the main hour & 3 min one that has a great warm up & cool down & teaches you the moves calmly & then 1/2 time, then full time, she will then add on to that move more to it's finished look & then goes normal speed a few times& when the credits roll, all the stagehands get on the set & dance with the dancers which is very cute & fun.The other workout is 30 min w/o a warm or cool down & again builds up the moves, but a bit faster.Bonus Section:About Patricia (11 min) she is one of 7 sisters & 3 brothers... no wonder she has such passion, you have to! lolTeaching the Moves (60 min) her teaching alone all the moves: posture, catwalk (walking around sexy/confidently), posing, bus stop, snake (plie, sexy), quick step, shakira, flash dance, arms, jazz. She spends even 8 min alone on posture, 3 min on the catwalk...The moves are cute, old style broadway with a couple dance video worthy moves, nothing complex.I love her style of teaching, even the 30 min alone was enough instruction to keep up EASILY for me right off the bat. I wish all dance instruction videos had her passion & style of teaching. I hope she makes more with more complex club or dance video style dancing. With the 45 min almost anyone with even 2 feet could get it. With the extra hour tutorial... maybe for perfectionists or those who like instruction extra slow & over think.Yes, the music is the cheap electronic style, kinda the tinkling w/single beat ""pause"" part of a club style music, but I've heard much worse & it's on par with older aerobics gym workouts. Most dance instruction has NO music, so I'm happy with anything. Other reviewers playing other songs during is a great idea.I took off 1 star for the music & wishing more moves were more up to date.Gaiam makes this & usually they do previews of their DVDs so maybe they'll make one soon.",4,Passionate Patricia & simple Jazz workout that anyone can do,1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,2260,"['YogaGirl', 'wrote', 'great', 'review', 'can', 'only', 'add', 'Patricia', 'GREAT', 'personality', 'never', 'ending', 'patience', 'passion', 'dancing', 'really', 'sure', 'get', 'everything', 'right', 'really', 'copy', 'dancers', 'down', 'keeping', 'arm', 'really', 'straight', 'knee', 'should', 'be', 'bent', 'etc.The', 'set', 'simple', 'hardwood', 'back', 'wall', 'being', 'one', 'big', 'huge', 'fake', 'window', 'showing', 'tropical', 'jungle', 'view', 'huge', 'stone', 'are', 'two', 'workouts', 'main', 'hour', '3', 'min', 'one', 'great', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'teaches', 'moves', 'calmly', 'then', '1/2', 'time', 'then', 'full', 'time', 'will', 'then', 'add', 'move', 'more', 'finished', 'look', 'then', 'normal', 'speed', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', 'stagehands', 'get', 'set', 'dance', 'dancers', 'very', 'cute', 'fun.The', 'other', 'workout', '30', 'min', 'w/o', 'warm', 'cool', 'down', 'again', 'up', 'moves', 'bit', 'faster.Bonus', 'Section', 'Patricia', '11', 'min', 'one', '7', 'sisters', '3', 'brothers', 'wonder', 'such', 'passion', 'have', 'lolTeaching', 'Moves', '60', 'min', 'teaching', 'alone', 'moves', 'posture', 'catwalk', 'walking', 'around', 'sexy/confidently', 'posing', 'bus', 'stop', 'snake', 'plie', 'sexy', 'quick', 'step', 'shakira', 'flash', 'dance', 'arms', 'jazz', 'even', '8', 'min', 'alone', 'posture', '3', 'min', 'catwalk', 'moves', 'are', 'cute', 'old', 'style', 'broadway', 'couple', 'dance', 'video', 'worthy', 'moves', 'nothing', 'complex.I', 'style', 'teaching', 'even', '30', 'min', 'alone', 'was', 'enough', 'instruction', 'keep', 'up', 'EASILY', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'wish', 'dance', 'instruction', 'videos', 'had', 'passion', 'style', 'teaching', 'hope', 'more', 'more', 'complex', 'club', 'dance', 'video', 'style', 'dancing', '45', 'min', 'almost', 'anyone', 'even', '2', 'feet', 'could', 'get', 'extra', 'hour', 'tutorial', 'maybe', 'perfectionists', 'who', 'like', 'instruction', 'extra', 'slow', 'think.Yes', 'music', 'cheap', 'electronic', 'style', 'kinda', 'tinkling', 'w/single', 'beat', 'pause', 'part', 'club', 'style', 'music', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'much', 'worse', 'par', 'older', 'aerobics', 'gym', 'workouts', 'Most', 'dance', 'instruction', 'NO', 'music', ""'m"", 'happy', 'anything', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'playing', 'other', 'songs', 'great', 'idea.I', 'took', 'off', '1', 'star', 'music', 'wishing', 'more', 'moves', 'were', 'more', 'up', 'date.Gaiam', 'usually', 'do', 'previews', 'DVDs', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'make', 'one', 'soon']",Dancer’s Body workout with Patricia Moreno
1020871,AWMU4C4CH21TE,B000IJ79ZW,YogaGirl,"[18, 21]","Ok, from the comments on the other reviews, I will attempt to be very specific in my review.  Got this DVD today and only previewed it. UPDATE:  Just finished doing part of the DVD.  The music is so horrible that I was bored to tears. The routine is good but I can't dance to such crappy canned music.  If I could change my rating I would give it 2 stars. Hated hated the music.  Stopped the DVD half way thru the routine.  The music is so bad that if Patricia didn't count you wouldn't know what the beat was. Anyway here is the rest of my review.Setting:  4 dancers + Patricia in a hard wood floor dance studio.  They are in sneakers and jazz dance shoes. 3 of the dances look like professionals.  One of the dancers looks like she has had quite a bit of Fosse jazz dancing.Music:  Elevator jazz.  This is the most disappointing to me.  I love music and this choregraphy would have been so much better if the music were louder with a more defined beat.  Perhaps afro-jazz or latin jazz would be better.  I didn't know quite what it was, but I didn't like it.  As I was watching the dvd I kept thinking how can I do this with my own music.  Even just plain percussion would have been better than this generic Kenny G stuff. A couple of times they got off beat because of the generic canned music.  Patricia dear, next time use a live percussion band or real jazz or real broadway 'Fosse' music!! UPDATE: I watched the dvd while listening to some Michael Jackson music.  I think that it will do okay with almost any MJ music.  Why didn't she use this to begin with!!!Choreography:  She has a warm up and cool down. Think Bob Fosse type jazz dancing.  Lots of jazz hands, shakira hips, step ball changes and turns.  Like I said, great moves, but the music was uninspiring.  Patricia goes over each step many many times.  She also adds on and goes back to the top.  I have carpet so I don't know if the turns will work for me.  At the end she goes over the entire routine once and then 4 times without stopping.  The choreography is quite fast.  If you live in New York and have heard of Broadway Dance, think of one of their jazz classes and you will have a good idea of what the routine is like.Overall thoughts:  I liked the routine.  I'm sure I'll sweat up a storm, but I hated the music.  Will I do it over and over?  NO. Hate the music. I can't dance to music I don't like. This goes in the back of my closet.",4,"Great choreography, terrible music",1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2413,"['Ok', 'comments', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'attempt', 'be', 'very', 'specific', 'review', 'Got', 'DVD', 'today', 'only', 'previewed', 'UPDATE', 'Just', 'finished', 'doing', 'part', 'DVD', 'music', 'so', 'horrible', 'was', 'bored', 'tears', 'routine', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'such', 'crappy', 'canned', 'music', 'could', 'change', 'rating', 'would', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'Hated', 'hated', 'music', 'Stopped', 'DVD', 'half', 'way', 'routine', 'music', 'so', 'bad', 'Patricia', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'beat', 'was', 'Anyway', 'here', 'rest', 'review.Setting', '4', 'dancers', '+', 'Patricia', 'hard', 'wood', 'floor', 'dance', 'studio', 'are', 'sneakers', 'jazz', 'dance', 'shoes', '3', 'dances', 'look', 'professionals', 'One', 'dancers', 'looks', 'had', 'quite', 'bit', 'Fosse', 'jazz', 'dancing.Music', 'Elevator', 'jazz', 'most', 'disappointing', 'love', 'music', 'choregraphy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'music', 'were', 'louder', 'more', 'defined', 'beat', 'Perhaps', 'afro-jazz', 'latin', 'jazz', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'watching', 'dvd', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'can', 'do', 'own', 'music', 'Even', 'just', 'plain', 'percussion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'generic', 'Kenny', 'G', 'stuff', 'couple', 'times', 'got', 'off', 'beat', 'generic', 'canned', 'music', 'Patricia', 'dear', 'next', 'time', 'use', 'live', 'percussion', 'band', 'real', 'jazz', 'real', 'broadway', 'music', 'UPDATE', 'watched', 'dvd', 'listening', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'music', 'think', 'will', 'do', 'okay', 'almost', 'MJ', 'music', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'begin', 'Choreography', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'Think', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'type', 'jazz', 'dancing', 'Lots', 'jazz', 'hands', 'shakira', 'hips', 'step', 'ball', 'changes', 'said', 'great', 'moves', 'music', 'was', 'uninspiring', 'Patricia', 'step', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'also', 'back', 'top', 'have', 'carpet', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'turns', 'will', 'work', 'end', 'entire', 'routine', 'once', 'then', '4', 'times', 'stopping', 'choreography', 'quite', 'fast', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'have', 'heard', 'Broadway', 'Dance', 'think', 'one', 'jazz', 'classes', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'routine', 'like.Overall', 'thoughts', 'liked', 'routine', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'sweat', 'up', 'storm', 'hated', 'music', 'Will', 'do', 'NO', 'Hate', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'back', 'closet']",Dancer’s Body workout with Patricia Moreno
