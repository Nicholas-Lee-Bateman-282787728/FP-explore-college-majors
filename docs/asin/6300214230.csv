211722,A1C0NMCONVFVF4,6300214230,Chloe,"[0, 1]","I enjoyed the pace & the characters were engaging enough. I've long been an ardent follower of suspense & thriller flicks. As such, I'm surprised I'd only just gotten around to watching this one. The violence is a little unsettling, but chillingly realistic of the villain in the film. I may rewatch it again before long. No trailer. DVD quality is decent.It's stated that The Fan is presented in widescreen format on the back cover, which it is not. It would have been nice to have been given the movie's original theatrical trailer, but I guess I can live without it. I'm more puzzled & peeved as to why this isn't in letterbox/widescreen format as indicated. *The bars on the top & bottom of the screen are normal* it says on the back cover of the DVD. Really? What bars (this is fullscreen)??! Strange, since I own loads of DVDs, which when stated widescreen, they are indeed widescreen. If another release comes out by a different distributor, I will buy it as well. Maybe they will present this in widescreen & my collection of this film will be complete. I would definitely recommend the film to fans of Bacall, Michael Biehn, James Garner, Maureen Stapleton.

I found it to be an interesting character study of an obsessed fan, played by Michael Biehn. He was a new actor at the time and a total unknown, which helped in this role. He went to star in ""The Terminator"" and has had a decent career. The other co-star....well, you might have heard of her: Lauren Bacall.I read a lot of criticism of Bacall for this role, and think it is totally unjustified. She was just fine, thank you, playing a believable character: a veteran actress being stalked by some deranged killer.With Maureen Stapleton, James Garner, Hector Elizondo, some great cinematography with wonderful close-up shots and a good score, what's not to like?

211725,AJ63Q41MSXHBB,6300214230,Dan the monster movie fan,"[0, 0]","The Fan is a thriller from 1981, the cast is fantastic, the dialogue is fine, and the writing is decent... However the film has its faults, lets take a look at, The Fan.Plot: Douglas is an admiring fan of super star Sally Ross. He grows ever more obsessed, to the degree of murder. Her admirer's letters grow from sweet, to creepy, to down right insane, going so far as to question the embrace of a cleaver in her privates. Sally grows afraid, but she must gather courage to vanquish her assailant.The premise is unique and a great one, Michael Biehn steals the show as admirer- Douglas Breen, and upstages everyone. However, Maureen Stapleton as secretary Belle is great, and steals the viewers as eye as a witty, hot headed, elderly character. Lauren Bacall does her job well as Sally. Hector Elizondo as Inspector Andrews also steals the scenes he's in. James Garner although great, his character is rather useless and unneeded as he wouldn't change much if he was taken out, except for the running time would be shorter (which would kinda be a good thing). Jake was Sally's ex lover who comes back, and the romantic sub plot between he and Sally feels forced, and takes up too much time, leaving the viewer rather bored through the romantic scenes. These romance scenes drag the film out longer, and amount to nothing. The most interesting plot(s) of the film deal with Douglas, as he's the most interesting character, and surprisingly likeable, however everyone is likeable here. The film's running time is a bit of a slow burn. The death scenes, aren't really very shocking but work, however 2 deaths occur of screen, which if had been shown, would've helped the film. Sally's song and dance, is awful, but hilarious so it's at least entertaining. Another issue I have is the finale, it feels too rushed, and would've had more impact if both Sally & Douglas would've died together. Why not have Doug accidentally kill, Sally, *he props her up in one of the auditorium seats, he sits down next to her and kills himself after saying, &#34;We'll finally be together forever&#34;. Then do the awesome shot that they did at the end, only except Sally is next to him, both dead.* The actual ending while decent, leaves you wanting more. The film garners great suspense, and tension, the score is phenomenal as well. The film it self is classy, but a tad sloppy. However the film needed a bit more oomph in it.  Truthfully the film is a tad predictable in parts, and a bit slow, but in the end it still satisfies. If you're looking for a slasher- thriller more exhilarating, you'll have to look else where. If you want a terrific and unpredictable slasher-suspense-thriller, see Brian De Palma's Dressed To Kill (1980), it's more completed, and more well crafted, it's also a tribute to the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.I can't say anything spectacular about the DVD, as it's basic with no extra features, and way too pricey for the film's caliber. I'd say wait for a cheaper release, if you want it for your collection, or if you wish to purchase the DVD.Final Thoughts: The Fan is a classy, nearly fantastic picture, a bit clumsy in parts, but still satisfying.My Rating: Film- 3/5 Stars, DVD - 2/5 stars",4,Not great but not awful.,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,3213,"['Fan', 'thriller', '1981', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'dialogue', 'fine', 'writing', 'decent', 'However', 'film', 'faults', 'lets', 'take', 'look', 'Fan.Plot', 'Douglas', 'admiring', 'fan', 'super', 'star', 'Sally', 'Ross', 'ever', 'more', 'obsessed', 'degree', 'murder', 'admirer', 'letters', 'grow', 'sweet', 'creepy', 'down', 'right', 'insane', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'question', 'embrace', 'cleaver', 'privates', 'Sally', 'afraid', 'must', 'gather', 'courage', 'vanquish', 'assailant.The', 'premise', 'unique', 'great', 'one', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'show', 'admirer-', 'Douglas', 'Breen', 'everyone', 'However', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'secretary', 'Belle', 'great', 'viewers', 'as', 'eye', 'witty', 'hot', 'headed', 'elderly', 'character', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'job', 'well', 'Sally', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Inspector', 'Andrews', 'also', 'scenes', 'James', 'Garner', 'great', 'character', 'rather', 'useless', 'unneeded', 'would', ""n't"", 'change', 'much', 'was', 'taken', 'out', 'running', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'shorter', 'would', 'kinda', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'Jake', 'was', 'Sally', 'ex', 'lover', 'who', 'back', 'romantic', 'sub', 'plot', 'Sally', 'feels', 'forced', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'rather', 'bored', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'romance', 'scenes', 'drag', 'film', 'out', 'longer', 'amount', 'nothing', 'most', 'interesting', 'plot', 's', 'film', 'deal', 'Douglas', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'surprisingly', 'likeable', 'however', 'everyone', 'likeable', 'here', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'bit', 'slow', 'burn', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'very', 'shocking', 'work', 'however', '2', 'deaths', 'screen', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'film', 'Sally', 'song', 'dance', 'awful', 'hilarious', 'least', 'entertaining', 'issue', 'have', 'finale', 'too', 'rushed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'Sally', 'Douglas', 'would', ""'ve"", 'died', 'together', 'Why', 'not', 'have', 'Doug', 'accidentally', 'kill', 'Sally', '*he', 'up', 'one', 'auditorium', 'seats', 'down', 'next', 'saying', '34', ""'ll"", 'finally', 'be', 'together', 'forever', '34', 'Then', 'do', 'awesome', 'shot', 'did', 'end', 'only', 'Sally', 'next', 'dead', '*', 'actual', 'ending', 'decent', 'wanting', 'more', 'film', 'garners', 'great', 'suspense', 'tension', 'score', 'phenomenal', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'classy', 'tad', 'sloppy', 'However', 'film', 'needed', 'bit', 'more', 'oomph', 'Truthfully', 'film', 'tad', 'predictable', 'parts', 'bit', 'slow', 'end', 'still', ""'re"", 'looking', 'slasher-', 'thriller', 'more', 'exhilarating', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'else', 'where', 'want', 'terrific', 'unpredictable', 'slasher-suspense-thriller', 'see', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'Dressed', 'Kill', '1980', 'more', 'completed', 'more', 'well', 'crafted', 'also', 'tribute', 'master', 'suspense', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'spectacular', 'DVD', 'basic', 'extra', 'features', 'way', 'too', 'pricey', 'film', 'caliber', ""'d"", 'say', 'wait', 'cheaper', 'release', 'want', 'collection', 'wish', 'purchase', 'DVD.Final', 'Thoughts', 'Fan', 'classy', 'nearly', 'fantastic', 'picture', 'bit', 'clumsy', 'parts', 'still', 'satisfying.My', 'Rating', 'Film-', '3/5', 'Stars', 'DVD', '2/5', 'stars']",The Fan VHS

211728,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6300214230,Jeffrey Leach,"[2, 6]","""The Fan"" fits into a category reserved for films such as ""The Sentinel,"" ""Ghost Story,"" ""Burnt Offerings,"" and any other big budget studio film that tried to cash in on the exploding popularity of the horror genre in the 1970s and early 1980s. Loaded with big name stars and stylish set pieces, these movies largely failed to earn critical or audience praise because they couldn't compete with the down and dirty gorefests like ""Friday the 13th"" let alone other slasher, demon possession, or ghost flicks. A precious few--""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" come immediately to mind--did succeed at the box office and went on to attain wider pop culture status. Sadly, ""The Fan"" is not one of these films. No one raves about a horror movie starring Lauren Becall and James Garner. No one, except for ""Terminator"" enthusiasts, seems to know that Michael Biehn co-starred in ""The Fan"" three years before ""The Terminator"" opened to everlasting cult status. In a way, obscurity is perhaps the best place for ""The Fan."" But in other aspects, it's a shame this film hasn't received greater attention from horror aficionados. Surprisingly, the movie does have a few interesting things going for it.""The Fan"" tells us the story of aging actress and all around screen siren Sally Ross (Lauren Becall). Although her best days seem far behind her, she still manages to draw a crowd from time to time. Sometimes a fan even steals her pens! Oh, the trials and travails of celebrity! She also must keep a secretary, in this case the mouthy Belle Goldman (Maureen Stapleton), on the payroll to answer fan mail. Then there's Jake Berman (James Garner), Sally's ex-husband and a noted film director, to deal with as well. Ross still keeps a flame burning for her former beau, going so far as to occasionally call him and leave long messages on his answering machine. Berman seems to recognize that he and Sally had something special too, and whenever he pops in for a visit the two banter back and forth like cranky little lovers. Fans, Goldman, and Berman form the backdrop to Sally's latest venture, a stage production in which the actress must sing and dance in front of a live audience for the first time in her career. It's going to be a real challenge for this grand old dame, but she's a real trooper who doesn't mind putting in time training to be a hoofer. Alas, circumstances beyond Sally Ross's control will soon threaten those she loves as well as her budding career as a song and dance diva.Enter Douglas Breen (Michael Biehn), a young man with an unhealthy interest in everything Sally Ross. He spends most of his time tapping out lengthy letters to her on a decrepit typewriter in his dingy apartment, letters full of fawning adoration for her talent and looks. Predictably, Belle Goldman intercepts these letters and fires off a standard pre-printed response. Breen, offended that Sally doesn't share his feelings, begins sending letters seething with threats. Ross is too caught up in her feelings for Berman and the rehearsals for the stage show to know anything about Douglas Breen, but Belle Goldman recognizes a nut when she sees one and tries to get Sally's attention. Nothing happens until Breen makes a move, viciously attacking Belle in the subway one evening as she heads home from Sally's apartment. Finally, Ross pays attention. She begins consulting with a concerned cop, Inspector Andrews (Hector Elizondo), but the attacks continue. A young man Sally dates falls prey to Breen's razorblade in a public swimming pool, and she arrives home one day to find her apartment ransacked. Breen appears unstoppable and invisible, yet his apparent death seemed to put a stop to the reign of terror before it reached its bloody apogee. But is Douglas Breen truly dead? And is Sally Ross safe?""The Fan"" is a failure for a number of reasons. First, it's boring for a slasher film. Nothing much happens for most of the film, and even the conclusion left me wanting more. Second, while it's always enjoyable to see Lauren Becall on the big screen, this film is beneath her talents. Most people seem to find her song and dance routine hilarious, but I actually sort of liked it. I'm not saying it isn't cheesy--it is the early 1980s, after all--but her performance on stage at the end of the film is probably the most interesting thing in the film. Third, and finally, I can't stand how this film wasted James Garner. I'm a big fan of this actor, especially his television show ""The Rockford Files,"" and to see him thrown into what is essentially a cameo role really disappoints. He shows up to say hello whenever Ross needs him and then disappears for large parts of the film. I kept thinking how much better the film would have been if Garner played the cop. Heck, how much better if Garner had played the fan! Anything that would have put him in a bigger role! The one saving grace of ""The Fan,"" other than Becall, is the scene where Douglas Breen fakes his own demise. It's an amazingly sordid scene, and up until this incident I wondered how the movie earned its 'R' rating.Unfortunately, the DVD contains no extras, but the movie does contain all of the aforementioned activities plus Dana Delaney, Griffin Dunne, and a few other well-known faces in very small roles. The musical score from Pino Donaggio, the same guy who did the music for ""Tourist Trap,"" gives the movie a nice edgy feel. I recommend ""The Fan"" for horror buffs who simply must see as many horror films as possible and Lauren Becall fans, but all others should stay away.",3,Nothing to write home about,1106438400,"01 23,

Maybe in the hands of a better director it would have worked. Bacall tries to make the dilemma of an aging stage star terrorized by a psychotic stalker believable but everything is against her. She forges ahead with her ""comeback"" Broadway show even after several of those near and dear to her are either slashed to death or just slashed by the straight-razor weilding weirdo who sends her dirty ""fan"" letters. The facial slashing of poor Maureen Stapleton is downright ugly and repugnant. But it sure heals fast in time for the opening of Bacalls' show. No one could have healed that fast---the multiple slashes were DEEP. Bacall trudges through her stage show numbers surrounded by adoring male dancers. After all, Broadway has been called the Gay White Way and no aging diva would set foot onstage without adoring male dancers. James Garner is utterly wasted as her love interest. He seems to be in the movie just because the two are friends. At any rate, despite Bacall's formidable presence this is a tacky New York filmed slasher show that disappoints on all counts.

Years later in the 90s, I saw it on Encore and taped it from there. Once I saw this movie in its entirety, I thought it was a great movie, even though the subject matter was pretty scary. Lauren Bacall stars as Sally Ross, an actress of movies and the Broadway stage. Michael Biehn plays Douglas Breen, who is the title character in the film. Douglas is a huge fan of Sally, but is psychologically unstable and starts writing her letters almost constantly. But Sally's secretary, Belle Goldman (played by Maureen Stapleton) is responding to the letters, which sets Douglas off. There's a scene where he pretends to have Sally over at his apartment for dinner (a sign of his instability). Later on, he gets fired from his job at the local record store, and then things get worse from then on. When things aren't going well for him in getting an answer back from Sally, he goes after the people who are closest to her. He attacks Belle in the hallway of a subway station (with a straight razor), then goes after Sally's boyfriend and kills him in the swimming pool of the local YMCA, then breaks into Sally's apartment, later on, attacks and kills the maid, then vandalizes the apartment. After Belle gets attacked, Sally ends up getting round the clock police protection. Meanwhile, Sally is doing rehearsals for a new musical, but is showing signs of nervousness due to the attacks against her closest friends. Later, Douglas meets a gay guy in a bar (who looks almost identical to him), and they go back to his place, only to kill him and burn him, leaving Sally a note telling her she is free from him. James Garner plays Sally's ex-husband, Jake, whom Sally sees occasionally, even though he is remarried. Then comes the night of her musical, and Douglas shows up shortly before the show ends, then hurries backstage to try and see her. He manages to get there, only to kill Sally's new maid (and the guy known as ""Pop"") and Sally gets scared. She tries to get away, but Douglas expresses his anger toward her for not staying in touch. After several more minutes, he embraces her, and Sally pretends to comfort him...only to jab his pocket knife into his neck in order to get away. I read somewhere that this movie was both a critical and commercial failure upon its initial release, but I feel that it is a movie worth watching, regardless of how it did at the box office.

211736,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6300214230,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 8]","The Fan (Edward Bianchi, 1981)Over the last decade, Edward Bianchi has become one of television's go-to directors, helming episodes of such award-winning shows as Damages, Deadwood, and The Wire, among many others. You'd never have known it after his first film, The Fan, which received such a beating from the press, and bombed badly enough upon release, that he came close to never working in Hollywood again. (Before getting his start in TV directing in 1998, Bianchi directed only one more feature film, ten years after this. It, too, bombed.) But for some reason, while I never got to see it in its theatrical release, The Fan has been swimming around in the back of my head, reminding me now and then that it was something I really wanted to see when it came out. It finally surfaced in my head at the same time it popped up on cable, so I decided to give it a go. I have seen top-notch casts in bottom-notch movies before, so it wasn't a complete surprise, but it seemed as if so much more could have been done with this that I couldn't help but be disappointed.Plot: Lauren Bacall plays Sally Ross, an aging stage and screen star. Michael Biehn, in an early role, is Douglas Breen, her number one fan. He also happens to be a razor-wielding psycho. When Ross' secretary, Belle (Maureen Stapleton), cuts him off after his letters get more erratic, he decides to get her out of the way so the two of them can be together. And boy, what happens when he finds out she's got a new love interest...It occurred to me at one point while I was mulling this over that someone, while putting this together, must have intended it as a parody. There's no other reason I can imagine for some of the crazy casting choices that were made (not to mention the incredible musical-within-the-movie, which is jaw-droppingly sleazy; this only two years after All That Jazz wrote the textbook on musicals-in-movies). If it was in any way meant seriously, then the project has to be looked at as an abject, unintentionally hilarious failure; it's the seventies equivalent (Hollywood trying to do giallo) of recent Asian horror film remakes, and with much the same results. If you look at it as some sort of off-the-wall parody, however, a movie that should have been marketed as a black comedy, then a lot of the silliness can be explained away, and this becomes a much more enjoyable experience. That said, since there was not a single clue anywhere that the connections here actually meant for the movie to suck, I'm forced to go with the ""serious"" interpretation, and rate it accordingly. It's great for a few laughs, though. * ",2,Unintentionally hilarious.,1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,2615,"['Fan', 'Edward', 'Bianchi', '1981', 'last', 'decade', 'Edward', 'Bianchi', 'become', 'one', 'television', 'go-to', 'directors', 'helming', 'episodes', 'such', 'award-winning', 'shows', 'Damages', 'Deadwood', 'Wire', 'many', 'others', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'known', 'first', 'film', 'Fan', 'received', 'beating', 'press', 'bombed', 'badly', 'enough', 'release', 'came', 'close', 'never', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'again', 'getting', 'start', 'TV', 'directing', '1998', 'Bianchi', 'directed', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'feature', 'film', 'ten', 'years', 'too', 'bombed', 'reason', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Fan', 'been', 'swimming', 'around', 'back', 'head', 'reminding', 'now', 'then', 'was', 'something', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'finally', 'surfaced', 'head', 'same', 'time', 'popped', 'up', 'cable', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'have', 'seen', 'top-notch', 'casts', 'bottom-notch', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'complete', 'surprise', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'disappointed.Plot', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Sally', 'Ross', 'aging', 'stage', 'screen', 'star', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'early', 'role', 'Douglas', 'Breen', 'number', 'one', 'fan', 'also', 'be', 'razor-wielding', 'psycho', 'When', 'Ross', 'secretary', 'Belle', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'off', 'letters', 'get', 'more', 'erratic', 'get', 'way', 'two', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'boy', 'what', 'when', 'out', 'got', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'occurred', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'mulling', 'someone', 'putting', 'together', 'must', 'have', 'intended', 'parody', 'other', 'reason', 'can', 'imagine', 'crazy', 'casting', 'choices', 'were', 'made', 'not', 'mention', 'incredible', 'musical-within-the-movie', 'jaw-droppingly', 'sleazy', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'Jazz', 'wrote', 'textbook', 'musicals-in-movies', 'was', 'way', 'meant', 'seriously', 'then', 'project', 'be', 'looked', 'abject', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'failure', 'seventies', 'equivalent', 'Hollywood', 'trying', 'do', 'giallo', 'recent', 'Asian', 'horror', 'film', 'remakes', 'much', 'same', 'results', 'look', 'sort', 'off-the-wall', 'parody', 'however', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'marketed', 'black', 'comedy', 'then', 'lot', 'silliness', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'away', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'single', 'clue', 'anywhere', 'connections', 'here', 'actually', 'meant', 'movie', 'suck', ""'m"", 'forced', 'go', 'serious', 'interpretation', 'rate', 'accordingly', 'great', 'few', 'laughs', 'though', '*']",The Fan VHS
211737,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6300214230,Simon Davis,"[12, 14]","Quite a while before ""stalking"" as such was as widely known and reported on as it is nowadays this taut little suspense drama ""The Fan"", came along which I feel for the time, told an original story and filled it with good performers and edge of the seat situations.At the time of its release ""The Fan"" based on the thriller novel by Bob Randall got alot of flak about some of the bloody scenes and the unnecessary violence but I feel it tells the story well and really is not excessive in its depiction of an ardent fan who loves an actress and  slowly becomes obsessed to the point of hatred when his advances are ignored.The real strong point of ""The Fan"" is in its perfect casting in all departments with both old and new performers. Central to all of the story and action is veteran actress Lauren Bacall in one of her rare starring roles in the 1980's. She portrays Sally Ross, one time Hollywood actress now successful Broadway actress who becomes the unwilling object of one fans over the top adoration. Bacall brings a great deal of style to her performance here and it really is a performance that comes from the old school of Hollywood acting , with glamour, witty lines and lots of cigarette smoking!! All the insider lines about fan letters and publicity and nerves about the next career move are all interwoven into the script in a naturalistic manner which makes you feel that Lauren Bacall could have been using her own experiences to build up the script.  She makes Sally a multi dimensional character with elements of bitchiness, insecurity and confidence all rolled into one. She really makes the film and there's alot of insider bits about Hollywood and Broadway ups and downs to make the performance just a trifle auto - biographical. James Garner also makes a welcome return to mainstream acting in the role of Jake Berman, Sally's ex husband and still best friend who finds himself having to literally protect Sally as the tension of the story mounts. While his is a supporting role he makes the most of his scenes . His and Bacall's interplay is really a pleasure to watch as two old style performers really show what screen chemistry in the old Hollywood was all about.The really star making performance in this film however absolutely goes to Michael Biehn in the role of the obsessive fan Douglas Breen. I think he was sensational in this performance as a lonely young man who develops an obsession on star Sally Ross which goes from interest in her, to love, and then through frustration, to hatred and attempted murder. He brings all the right qualities to his performance and is at times both pathetic and scary. His violent scenes where he attacks Sally's personal assistant Belle Goldman (beautifully played by veteran actress Maureen Stapleton)and Sally's leading man in the swimming Pool are harrowing but really add to the high drama of the piece. I'm surprised that after such a great performance in his first feature film after numerous television acting roles that Michael Biehn went into action flicks when he had such great talent for drama.The overraul look of ""The Fan"" is great and it really captures that exciting atmosphere of the Broadway world very well. The one major failing of the production however is the absolutely God Awful musical production that Sally is rehearsing while being stalked by Douglas Breen. It is atrocious and I couldn't imagine it ever entertaining a New York audience for more than one second little alone becoming the hit of the season.The well staged climax of the story as Douglas traps Sally in the dark and empty Broadway theatre is terrific and really brings the story to an exciting climax as Sally is first pursued and then cornered by her former admirer and has to turn the tables on him by pretending to want to be with him to be able to get away. This climax is taut, has minimal dialogue, and really uses all the elements of the theatre to great effect in creating an edge of the seat finale to the story.Lauren Bacall really has a star role here and I feel she brings all her decades of great acting experience to the fore to make a great impression as fading star Sally Ross. Matched all the way by Michael Biehn it is a unique blending of old and new acting and the two really lift ""The Fan"" up to being a great little thriller to engross you as it does me with each screening.",4,Suspense filled drama with bite,1028073600,"07 31, 2002",2002,4363,"['while', 'stalking', 'such', 'was', 'widely', 'known', 'reported', 'nowadays', 'taut', 'little', 'suspense', 'drama', 'Fan', 'came', 'feel', 'time', 'told', 'original', 'story', 'filled', 'good', 'performers', 'edge', 'seat', 'situations.At', 'time', 'release', 'Fan', 'based', 'thriller', 'novel', 'Bob', 'Randall', 'got', 'alot', 'flak', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'unnecessary', 'violence', 'feel', 'story', 'well', 'really', 'not', 'excessive', 'depiction', 'ardent', 'fan', 'who', 'actress', 'slowly', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'point', 'hatred', 'when', 'advances', 'are', 'ignored.The', 'real', 'strong', 'point', 'Fan', 'perfect', 'casting', 'departments', 'old', 'new', 'performers', 'Central', 'story', 'action', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'one', 'rare', 'starring', 'roles', '1980', 'Sally', 'Ross', 'one', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'actress', 'now', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'actress', 'who', 'unwilling', 'object', 'one', 'fans', 'top', 'adoration', 'Bacall', 'great', 'deal', 'style', 'performance', 'here', 'really', 'performance', 'old', 'school', 'Hollywood', 'acting', 'glamour', 'witty', 'lines', 'lots', 'cigarette', 'smoking', 'insider', 'lines', 'fan', 'letters', 'publicity', 'nerves', 'next', 'career', 'move', 'are', 'interwoven', 'script', 'naturalistic', 'manner', 'feel', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'own', 'experiences', 'build', 'up', 'script', 'Sally', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'character', 'elements', 'bitchiness', 'insecurity', 'confidence', 'rolled', 'one', 'really', 'film', 'alot', 'insider', 'bits', 'Hollywood', 'Broadway', 'ups', 'downs', 'make', 'performance', 'just', 'trifle', 'auto', 'biographical', 'James', 'Garner', 'also', 'welcome', 'return', 'mainstream', 'acting', 'role', 'Jake', 'Berman', 'Sally', 'ex', 'husband', 'still', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'having', 'literally', 'protect', 'Sally', 'tension', 'story', 'mounts', 'supporting', 'role', 'most', 'scenes', 'Bacall', 'interplay', 'really', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'two', 'old', 'style', 'performers', 'really', 'show', 'what', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'about.The', 'really', 'star', 'making', 'performance', 'film', 'however', 'absolutely', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'role', 'obsessive', 'fan', 'Douglas', 'Breen', 'think', 'was', 'sensational', 'performance', 'lonely', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'obsession', 'star', 'Sally', 'Ross', 'interest', 'love', 'then', 'frustration', 'hatred', 'attempted', 'murder', 'right', 'qualities', 'performance', 'times', 'pathetic', 'scary', 'violent', 'scenes', 'where', 'Sally', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Belle', 'Goldman', 'beautifully', 'played', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'Sally', 'leading', 'man', 'swimming', 'Pool', 'are', 'harrowing', 'really', 'add', 'high', 'drama', 'piece', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'such', 'great', 'performance', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'numerous', 'television', 'acting', 'roles', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'went', 'action', 'flicks', 'when', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'talent', 'drama.The', 'overraul', 'look', 'Fan', 'great', 'really', 'exciting', 'atmosphere', 'Broadway', 'world', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'major', 'failing', 'production', 'however', 'absolutely', 'God', 'Awful', 'musical', 'production', 'Sally', 'rehearsing', 'being', 'stalked', 'Douglas', 'Breen', 'atrocious', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'ever', 'entertaining', 'New', 'York', 'audience', 'more', 'one', 'second', 'little', 'alone', 'becoming', 'hit', 'season.The', 'well', 'staged', 'climax', 'story', 'Douglas', 'Sally', 'dark', 'empty', 'Broadway', 'theatre', 'terrific', 'really', 'story', 'exciting', 'climax', 'Sally', 'first', 'pursued', 'then', 'cornered', 'former', 'admirer', 'turn', 'tables', 'pretending', 'want', 'be', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'climax', 'taut', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'really', 'elements', 'theatre', 'great', 'effect', 'creating', 'edge', 'seat', 'finale', 'story.Lauren', 'Bacall', 'really', 'star', 'role', 'here', 'feel', 'decades', 'great', 'acting', 'experience', 'fore', 'make', 'great', 'impression', 'fading', 'star', 'Sally', 'Ross', 'Matched', 'way', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'unique', 'blending', 'old', 'new', 'acting', 'two', 'really', 'lift', 'Fan', 'up', 'being', 'great', 'little', 'thriller', 'engross', 'screening']",The Fan VHS

Upon viewing it twenty years later, I remain correct - in 1981 it *was* a stylish, gripping thriller, but not any more. It contains several of those ""Who would pay money to see that?"" performances-within-performances that we have written about before. This time, the perpetrator is Lauren Bacall, playing a Broadway actress (naturally) who talks/sings her way through a few self-important numbers about what it's like to be a famous star. The numbers are simply awful and for people who already have a bad attitude about Broadway, this is the kind of routine that gives them plenty of ammunition for hating it. The best things about Bacall's performance are her Halston clothes. Riding high from his days as the conquering hero of the Seventies, Halston was going through major personal and business problems at this time, but the clothes produced at that time are nothing short of magnificent American classics. In addition to the traditional Halston looks of cashmere twinsets paired with straight-legged slacks with gorgeous trenchcoats draped over the shoulders, Bacall wears a few of Halston's most spectacular creations. Though much of the most interesting details are lost on the screen, Bacall wears Halston's ""spiral-cut"" caftans created from a single piece of fabric with a single seam that winds around the body. The way they drape and mold to the body is a testament to Halston's incredible creative abilities. The clothes, as beautiful relics of that era, are the best thing about this movie.",2,Bacall's Halston Clothes Are The Best Thing About This Movie,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,1588,"['When', 'first', 'saw', '*The', 'Fan*', '1981', 'thought', 'was', 'stylish', 'gripping', 'thriller', 'viewing', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'remain', 'correct', '1981', '*was*', 'stylish', 'gripping', 'thriller', 'not', 'more', 'several', 'Who', 'would', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'performances-within-performances', 'have', 'written', 'before', 'time', 'perpetrator', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'playing', 'Broadway', 'actress', 'naturally', 'who', 'way', 'few', 'self-important', 'numbers', 'what', 'be', 'famous', 'star', 'numbers', 'are', 'simply', 'awful', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'have', 'bad', 'attitude', 'Broadway', 'kind', 'routine', 'plenty', 'ammunition', 'hating', 'best', 'things', 'Bacall', 'performance', 'are', 'Halston', 'clothes', 'Riding', 'high', 'days', 'conquering', 'hero', 'Seventies', 'Halston', 'was', 'going', 'major', 'personal', 'business', 'problems', 'time', 'clothes', 'produced', 'time', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'magnificent', 'American', 'classics', 'addition', 'traditional', 'Halston', 'cashmere', 'twinsets', 'paired', 'straight-legged', 'slacks', 'gorgeous', 'trenchcoats', 'draped', 'shoulders', 'Bacall', 'few', 'Halston', 'most', 'spectacular', 'creations', 'much', 'most', 'interesting', 'details', 'are', 'lost', 'screen', 'Bacall', 'Halston', 'spiral-cut', 'caftans', 'created', 'single', 'piece', 'fabric', 'single', 'seam', 'body', 'way', 'drape', 'mold', 'body', 'testament', 'Halston', 'incredible', 'creative', 'abilities', 'clothes', 'beautiful', 'relics', 'era', 'are', 'best', 'thing', 'movie']",The Fan VHS

The irony is that I am now Lauren Bacall's age at the time she made the film (56) although in her case, the hard living with Bogey didn't help preserve a more youthful image. I do applaud Bacall for letting her lines and wrinkles show so harshly. She does look beautiful though in her costumes and gowns throughout the picture. There she was looking sleek and fit in the dance studio scene as rolley-poley little Maureen Stapleton reaches into a paper bag and presents Bacall with a cup of yogurt while she grabs the beefy sandwich.Film stars are just as insecure as Bacall's Sally Ross is portrayed to be here....you see Bacall's character returning to her apartment in the beginning of the film and she is ALONE.  She is divorced from James Garner's character but she still needs him and wants him in her life. I think Bacall's Sally Ross was a look into Bacall's personality absolutely. I mean, the way she keeps making snide remarksabout Jame's Garner's character's fianc&eacute;e...very telling.One thing I noticed is that not many reviewers have much to say about the actor that played the psycho fan, Douglas.I thought the actor did a very good job portraying the obsessed fan.  His eyes always looked mean and spiteful.  I thought he wasparticularly effective in the scene at the end when he walks into the theater and is watching Sally Ross singing the closing song in theshow.  He is loving her and hating her all in the same moment. His hands are clasped together and the frustration he isexperiencing really comes across to the audience.I will probably go on watching this film over and over again to spot things I have missed.Check it out.",4,Picture with pizzazz,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,2067,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'when', 'originally', 'opened', 'back', '1981', 'only', 'vaguely', 'recall', 'hearing', 'anything', 'back', 'then.Then', 'just', 'recently', 'came', 'Exfinity', 'decided', 'watch', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'insomnia', 'was', 'way.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'campy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'too', 'found', 'fascinating', 'have', 'watched', 'once', 'day', 'past', 'several', 'weeks', 'irony', 'am', 'now', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'age', 'time', 'made', 'film', '56', 'case', 'hard', 'living', 'Bogey', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'preserve', 'more', 'youthful', 'image', 'do', 'applaud', 'Bacall', 'letting', 'lines', 'wrinkles', 'show', 'so', 'harshly', 'look', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'gowns', 'picture', 'was', 'looking', 'sleek', 'fit', 'dance', 'studio', 'scene', 'rolley-poley', 'little', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'paper', 'bag', 'presents', 'Bacall', 'cup', 'yogurt', 'grabs', 'beefy', 'sandwich.Film', 'stars', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'insecure', 'Bacall', 'Sally', 'Ross', 'portrayed', 'be', 'here', '.you', 'see', 'Bacall', 'character', 'returning', 'apartment', 'beginning', 'film', 'ALONE', 'divorced', 'James', 'Garner', 'character', 'still', 'life', 'think', 'Bacall', 'Sally', 'Ross', 'was', 'look', 'Bacall', 'personality', 'absolutely', 'mean', 'way', 'making', 'snide', 'remarksabout', 'Jame', 'Garner', 'character', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'very', 'telling.One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'not', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'much', 'say', 'actor', 'played', 'psycho', 'fan', 'Douglas.I', 'thought', 'actor', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'obsessed', 'fan', 'eyes', 'always', 'looked', 'mean', 'spiteful', 'thought', 'wasparticularly', 'effective', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'theater', 'watching', 'Sally', 'Ross', 'singing', 'closing', 'song', 'theshow', 'loving', 'hating', 'same', 'moment', 'hands', 'are', 'clasped', 'together', 'frustration', 'isexperiencing', 'really', 'audience.I', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'watching', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'spot', 'things', 'have', 'missed.Check', 'out']",The Fan VHS

And there is almost nothing hotter than Michael Biehn playing a freakin' lunatic in a movie (The Abyss, Tombstone, Deadly Intentions, you know what I mean).Anyway, the movie is okay at best.  The acting is good, and the film LOOKS good but it's just a bit on the slow and boring side.  Either way I still watch it from time to time.  About four or five years ago I decided to hunt down a copy of the book The Fan, by Bob Randall, upon which this movie was based and my god was I glad I did.  The book is just flat out creepy; it makes my skin crawl just thinking about it.  I so wish the movie had gone more that way especially with the ending but I can see why it didn't given what audiences typically want.  Some of the stuff in this book I wouldn't even WANT to see on film!  And I am a fan of horrible, scary, disturbing stuff.  :-/At any rate I am not here to rate the book, I am here to rate the movie.
