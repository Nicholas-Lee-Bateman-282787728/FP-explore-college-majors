726592,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00007CVRU,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 2]","This 2002 movie release is unique,  amusing, and filled with subtle humor, very subtle.  The entire concept of the movie is based on a female agent's  determination to collect votes from island villagers on election day.The film is set on the islands of the Persian Gulf.  You will also discover the culture of the country and how men and women are differentiated.  Yes, it may be slow at times, what I believe the Director Payami allows the viewer to embrace the time span that allows one to  feel  the pressure of time running out.Like any other country encouraging its people to come out for election day, we identify with  the obstacles the agent encounters along the way.  She is partnered with an army guard with a rifle who plays the role of a confused and non-sympathetic companion to drives her to the villages.Some encounters are a truckload of women brought in by a man who decides that HE will vote for them; a man who feels GOD will get his vote;  a group of men who don't recognize their candidate in the line-up, so they won't vote;  and a man who won't vote under the pressure of  a soldier carries a rifle.This is an excellent film, main characters are well-cast, and the island villagers are memorable.

726593,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00007CVRU,Andy Orrock,"[4, 5]","'Secret Ballot' is the epitome of a 'small' movie.  Set on a desolate island off the coast of Iran, it's the story of a voting agent's day - 8:30 AM to 5 PM - as she tries to collect the votes of the island's sparse population while in the company of a grumpy Iranian army conscript.Along the way, she tackles:1) Sexism (as the conscript tells her: ""They told me an agent was coming, not a woman"").2) Illiteracy (she's forced to resort to pictures of the candidates)3) Fundamentalism (""I cast my vote for God"" one guy keeps telling her)4) Apathy and skeptism (and who can blame these folks?  Despite Khatami's 'democratic' victory, the unelected theocrats still rule the day in Iran)...and a lot more.The relationship between the two leads develops slowly and you have very nuanced exchanges like:Conscript: ""When is the next election?""Agent: ""In four years.  Elections are held every four years.""Conscript: ""Why not hold them three or four times a year?  That would be better""...by this point in the film, this isn't a political statement.  It's just the conscript's very (very) subtle way of saying ""Gee, it would be great if I could see you more.""Here's a warning:  This is a *very* slow-moving film.  There are sequences at the beginning where you see a soldier spend five minutes getting ready for bed (in a dilapidated outside cot); then the agent spend two minutes getting the sand off of her feet.I can see Babak Payami's motivation here.  We're being shown how simple and unaffected - and pretty darn difficult - life is on this island.  But if you're watching this on a full stomach, be careful: you may nod off.  This is not intended as a slam of the film, which - on the whole - I enjoyed very much.  I'm just saying you're going to need some energy to soldier through the first 20 minutes of 'Secret Ballot.'

726596,A17IW44FV0HUTY,B00007CVRU,Glen Engel Cox,"[0, 7]","This has to be the slowest movie I've seen since La Dolce Vita. The idea is great--an Iranian election agent trying to gather votes from a remote island whose residents are really quite disenfranchised from the whole process--but the concept has trouble being stretched over a 105 minutes, and would perhaps been better served by 30.Some of the drawn out portions are identifiably purposeful, to illustrate the slow pace of life, for example, of the guards, one of whom has to escort the agent as she attempts to collect votes. And maybe some of those scenes had more interest when shone upon a large screen rather than the 12-inch television that we currently use. I don't believe either that the movie, while a comedy, is meant to be as insanely hilarious as something like The Gods Must Be Crazy, but attempts ironic detachment, a kind of intellectual humor that doesn't make your belly ache but your head nod. Even so, the nod my head tended to give it was more in falling asleep.And unlike some movies, the theme isn't impossible to discern. You know exactly what the writer-director is trying to underline with the scene where the guard stops at a red light in the middle of the desert even though there is nobody else in sight, and the election official urges him to move on or they will be late to catch her returning boat and thus invalidating the votes she has collected.

726598,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00007CVRU,Joseph Haschka,"[7, 8]","In the first scene of SECRET BALLOT, a large box is parachuted from of a plane flying out of the sunrise. It lands on an Iranian island, on the beach guarded by two soldiers. These are apparently the only two armed representatives of authority in the place, and ""guard"" may be an overstatement. Catching smugglers is their assignment, but they do it with only one bed, one rifle, and one timepiece between them. In any case, inside the crate are a ballot box and instructions for the soldiers to expect the arrival of an elections agent at 8:00 AM. They're further ordered to escort the agent around the island and collect votes in that day's national election.A half-hour late, a small motorboat lands on the beach, and off clambers the agent - a modern young woman complete with chador and a missionary zeal for her job, which must be completed by 5:00 PM. At first, the soldier on duty is reluctant to do the agent's bidding. After all, she's a woman, and this is Islamic Iran. However, after she waves the undeniable fact of ""his orders"" in his face, off they bounce in a jeep to harvest ballots for the box. The film's screenplay does not provide names for the agent or the soldier, but they're played by Nassim Abdi and Cyrus Abidi respectively.The humor and pace of SECRET BALLOT is much like the island itself - sleepy. In fact, you may need a large java to stay focused on the English subtitles of the Farsi dialogue. But the film isn't without a gentle charm, especially if you're curious about the world around you and you've not been to this corner of it.The soldier is, to put it charitably, a stolid, unimaginative sort. But he does know the pulse of the island. During the day's rounds, the agent, her idealism, and the ""approved list"" of candidates (from which each voter must select two) are confronted by the realities of the local electorate, e.g., woman who won't vote without instructions from their men, men who won't vote because their candidates aren't on the list, and a religious fundamentalist who insists on Allah as a write-in candidate. At day's end, the agent and the soldier see each other in a different light, and each is the better for it. We first suspect the change in perhaps the movie's most humorous scene when the soldier halts the jeep at a red light in the middle of nowhere with no other moving vehicles in sight.SECRET BALLOT has no eye-popping special FX, white-knuckle action, belly laughs, or stunning dramatic moments. But I'm giving it a marginal thumbs-up because it's a small window on a world much different than my own, and I appreciate the perspicacity of the view.",3,Democracy storms a sleepy place,1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,2620,"['first', 'scene', 'SECRET', 'BALLOT', 'large', 'box', 'parachuted', 'plane', 'flying', 'sunrise', 'Iranian', 'island', 'beach', 'guarded', 'two', 'soldiers', 'are', 'apparently', 'only', 'two', 'armed', 'representatives', 'authority', 'place', 'guard', 'may', 'be', 'overstatement', 'Catching', 'smugglers', 'assignment', 'do', 'only', 'one', 'bed', 'one', 'rifle', 'one', 'timepiece', 'case', 'crate', 'are', 'ballot', 'box', 'instructions', 'soldiers', 'expect', 'arrival', 'elections', 'agent', '8:00', 'AM', ""'re"", 'further', 'ordered', 'escort', 'agent', 'island', 'collect', 'votes', 'day', 'national', 'election.A', 'half-hour', 'late', 'small', 'motorboat', 'beach', 'clambers', 'agent', 'modern', 'young', 'woman', 'complete', 'chador', 'missionary', 'zeal', 'job', 'must', 'be', 'completed', '5:00', 'PM', 'first', 'soldier', 'duty', 'reluctant', 'do', 'agent', 'bidding', 'woman', 'Islamic', 'Iran', 'However', 'undeniable', 'fact', 'orders', 'face', 'bounce', 'jeep', 'harvest', 'ballots', 'box', 'film', 'screenplay', 'not', 'provide', 'names', 'agent', 'soldier', ""'re"", 'played', 'Nassim', 'Abdi', 'Cyrus', 'Abidi', 'respectively.The', 'humor', 'pace', 'SECRET', 'BALLOT', 'much', 'island', 'sleepy', 'fact', 'may', 'need', 'large', 'java', 'stay', 'focused', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Farsi', 'dialogue', 'film', ""n't"", 'gentle', 'charm', 'especially', ""'re"", 'curious', 'world', ""'ve"", 'not', 'been', 'corner', 'it.The', 'soldier', 'put', 'charitably', 'stolid', 'unimaginative', 'sort', 'know', 'pulse', 'island', 'day', 'rounds', 'agent', 'idealism', 'approved', 'list', 'candidates', 'voter', 'must', 'select', 'two', 'are', 'confronted', 'realities', 'local', 'electorate', 'e.g.', 'woman', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'vote', 'instructions', 'men', 'men', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'vote', 'candidates', 'are', ""n't"", 'list', 'religious', 'fundamentalist', 'who', 'Allah', 'write-in', 'candidate', 'day', 'end', 'agent', 'soldier', 'see', 'other', 'different', 'light', 'better', 'first', 'suspect', 'change', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'most', 'humorous', 'scene', 'when', 'soldier', 'halts', 'jeep', 'red', 'light', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'other', 'moving', 'vehicles', 'sight.SECRET', 'BALLOT', 'eye-popping', 'special', 'FX', 'white-knuckle', 'action', 'belly', 'stunning', 'dramatic', 'moments', ""'m"", 'giving', 'marginal', 'thumbs-up', 'small', 'window', 'world', 'much', 'different', 'own', 'appreciate', 'perspicacity', 'view']",Secret Ballot

She introduces herself to one soldier, then tells him that he will escort her around the island to collect the residents' votes.  It's election day.The soldier is unhappy with this arrangement, and demands to see his orders.  His orders state that an ""agent"" will arrive to administer voting, not a woman!  None too happy about a requirement that he serve a female boss for one day, he obliges.  He insists on carrying his gun, because without the gun, he gets no respect.  The woman insists that he leave the gun, because citizens should be ""free"" to vote.The pair encounter various unusual citizens on the island, including a rural encampment where a baby is being born, a solar energy station (?) which is tended by an old man, and a camp ruled by a woman called Granny, who refuses to see the vote-takers.  Along the way the woman engages her escort, and several of the potential voters, in debates about why and how people should vote.One of the better episodes involves a man who brings about a dozen women to vote, then claims he will vote for them.  Another involves a trio of voters who truly want to vote, but the candidate they prefer is not on the list of approved candidates.Secret Ballot is an Iranian film from director Babak Payami. While not on the level of such Iranian movie masterpieces as Abbas Kiarostami's Taste of Cherry, or the films of Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Secret Ballot is worth a viewing.  It is a slight and modest film, but thoughtprovoking, and, at times, beautiful.The pace of Secret Ballot is leisurely at best, plodding at its worst.  Often, scenes are ill conceived or seem to drag on beyond any possible entertainment or educational value.  Still, the movie is beautifully shot, and the conversations between the female agent and male soldier are worth the price of a rental.

It then pans to a bunk bed in the open by the beach with a soldier sleeping. He wakes and discovers the crate contains all the ballots and voting materials for the upcoming election and a notice that the voting agent will be arriving shortly and his assignment is to chaperon the agent around the island to collect and verify the votes. This is an Iranian island and when he discovers the bureaucratic agent is a woman, that is his first problem. The second is locating all the voters on the island and convincing them that voting is their responsibility and that it does impact their lives. The one day adventure of this odd couple, a reluctant Iranian soldier and enthusiastic, persevering female agent produces some humorous as well as sobering encounters with the reality of life on this island. Is the film primarily about democracy, gender discrimination or life in Iran? Perhaps it's a combination of all three in this documentary-like film.

This might just be my favorite romantic movie.Blatant political satire (objections to voting at gunpoint, pulling votes out from under a rock) and social commentary are the setting for a slow-motion love story. The plot is simple: the ballot-collecting job of an idealistic, can-do election agent and her cynical soldier escort is thwarted by the malaise and indifference that hold sway on a backward rural island, then the girl gets on an airplane and flies off into the sunset, leaving the guy to his life of sitting on a plank staring out at the sea. Sounds glum, but the real action is in the unspoken rapport creeping subtly between the agent and the soldier.It takes almost two hours to get to the place most movies pass by under the opening credits. Like the guy says at the beginning, (and again at the end): ""Nothing ever happens on time."" Everything in this movie takes forever, but time's up before you know what's happening. Then she's gone. Man, that island is going to be really lonely now, until the next election day.

The only thing special is that you have control of what language to see the subtitles...that's about it...and scene selections.Now, this movie is so through provoking and powerful. It is about a women who is sent by the government to get people to vote. She has her problems from the moment she steps of the boat with the person who is to escort but she shows herself as a powerful and intelligent woman and simply deals with the matter in that fashion. She is the off to find people to vote. However she find herself dealing with many issues of the people. For exmaple: a group of women come to vote and the man states he will do the voting for them. Instead of getting upset and losing image, she simply explains that every citizen has the right to vote on the own and have their own opinion. Something, we westerners take for granted. She is also confronted by people who are against voting and she finds herself breaking some of the religious rules to try to get them to vote.  I won't give anymore away.

726603,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00007CVRU,Stephen A. Haines,"[8, 8]","The tranquility of a desert dawn is rudely interrupted by aircraft engines.  A parachuted box varies the mundane task of two soldiers watching for smugglers.  With the arrival of a boat dispatching a young woman on the beach, nothing will ever be the same.  Democracy has arrived on an Iranian island - wearing a chador and sturdy walking shoes.Few films have started in as low a key as this one.  Fewer still have built a story of such intense human realism from such a gentle beginning.  The soldier, shocked at the arrival of a woman as the Election Officer, is reluctant to be commandeered as her escort.  She has the power of The Law on her side, however.  They must tour the island, collecting votes, and return to camp to meet the boat at 5:00 o'clock - ""You're ordered to escort me"".The ensuing day is marked by clashes of personality, background, role and purpose.  The soldier's job is to catch law-breakers.  That covers just about anyone whose behaviour he can't immediately comprehend.  A man running across the sands is a voter to one and a fleeing criminal to the other.  Which is he?  That he votes doesn't settle the question.  Voters come in all shapes, sizes, dress - and attitudes - ""even smugglers can vote"", she says.  A group of women voters are delivered in a giant dump truck - but they speak a dialect the Election Officer doesn't know.  Although the slate is ten ""approved candidates"" [approved by who?], one man bypasses them to vote for his own favourite.  Others don't want to take the time - ""voting doesn't catch fish"".The Election Officer has her own answers to these complaints.  With an enthusiasm a Britannica salesman would envy, she sells democracy to the island's residents.  And a few others.  She rises to every objection: ""If you vote, you can plan your life better"".  Illiterate voters who can't read the names are encouraged to ""vote for the photographs"".  Her intensity is palpable - would there were more like her here!  At the end, there is only one vote left to obtain.  The scene resolves the entire film while resolving nothing.  There should be a sequel, but it will never be filmed.Payami's film is almost indescribable in its stark beauty.  The purity of the desert provides an excellent background to the intense human story.  There are many levels to cope with as you watch it unfold.  These are people distrustful of what they can't grasp, control or understand.  An election has remote meaning to a culture unused to its vagaries.  They are far from ignornant, but they are an isolated community.  Payami offers no issues, parties, ambitions either distant nor local in the election.  Survival, the daily struggle on the island, is the key.  Payami highlights the protagonists when needed, but sets them against the changing background as the Election Officer and the Soldier tour the island.  The foreground changes, also, as the Officer and Soldier work out their roles.  Highly recommended.

726604,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00007CVRU,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[4, 4]","Billed as a comedy but actually just as much, or more, a drama, something I usually find wrecks movies I got expecting to be a comedy, diluting the humorous parts to the point of impotence and failing to work well on a dramatic level.  However, this one of the rare 'dramedies' that hits its mark full on.  ""Secret Ballot"" is an Iranian-made movie about the fledgling Iranian democracy emerging (the film, incidentally, was  made before this year's democratic setbacks with the summary disqualifacations of most reform-minded candidates), with a female elections official (wonderfully played by Nassim Abdi) making the rounds with a mobile ballot box to collect votes from residents in a remote region of the Iranian coast and its nearby islands, with Cyrus Abidi as the soldier grudgingly compelled to drive her on her rounds.  The humor is light but rich, the drama elements subtle but highly effective, and both raise up some issues without being politically overbearing.  The terrain is beautiful and majestic, captured perfectly by the unique cinematography/editing style that uses a number of long, real-time shots with very few cutaways.  When a little boat heads out to the larger fishing vessel a few hundred feet offshore it's done in real-time; you can see people getting on and off the smaller boat, faintly seeing them moving around on the the big boat, before the little boat begins to return to shore in the same shot.  It might sound tedious but it's not, it just lets you experience the atmosphere and the ocean waves perfectly.  The election worker is bright and full of optimism, either oblivious to the distrust of the the system she's working for or utterly refusing to be brought down by it, so steadfast is she in her belief that she's helping everybody move together towards a better future.  It's the Middle Eastern Amelie!  The soldier at first appears to be the portrait of sullen apathy, but very quickly it shows through that this is an intelligent individual, bogged down in quiet frustration of a life and a system that haven't worked out the way he would have liked.  A large number of other interesting characters come and go for varying lengths of time, and it's up to the viewer to determine if there's also a subtle but powerful romantic angle here too.This is the first Iranian movie I've ever seen, and it's left me wanting to sample more, from different genres too, as well as movies from some other countries in the Middle East, both the Arabic countries and Israel.  Very, very refreshing to see the Middle East in a vein other than what you see on the news, which seems to be just real-life violence and tragedy, while the rest gets ignored.

726605,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00007CVRU,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 6]","""Secret Ballot"" starts with a unique visual image: a tiny speck of airplane's shadow and something dropping from it, against the beautiful sunrise.  And that something plays the central role of this mildly amusing, low-keyed political satire.  But that is not all that you will see in this Iran-Italy production.""Secret Ballot"" is about an incongrous pair: one laconic soldier guarding somewhere on the sleepy coast of an unnamed island in Iran, and a talkative female civil servant coming there to collect votes for the election.  The latter has to complete her job by 5 p.m., and the soldier, to his great dismay, is ordered to accompany her around the island.The small tour is filled with episodes concerning their task. and not many islanders are friendly to her.  Or they just don't understand her job.  In spite of her lofty idealism and unstoppable energy, her job turns out nothing smooth because of the differences of belief, custom, and language.  And so many unexpected things happen to her -- one of the votes is even hidden under a rock.To see her doing at best (still not without disillusion about democracy in general) makes you see the point of the film clear, but there is another asset to the film, an underplayed romantic aspect between the two leads.  Watching over her never-ending struggle, the soldier, who was at first very hostile, gradually changes his attitudes towards her.  As the appointed time for her to leave comes near, we also understand his feelings to her in his words, which are in themselves very few.  Don't miss that point, and that's why a slightly surprise ending gives the entire film more pathos than you expect.  No longer this island is a sleepy place for the soldier.As is often the case with Iranian films, ""Secret Ballot"" is slow-paced and would require your patience.  In case you feel sleepy (I confess I did), you might know the following facts about the film.  The two leads are in fact non-professionals, and the heroine Nassim Abidi is a student majoring in journalism in college.  The director managed to persuade her to join in the film despite the great reluctance on her side.  This episode may sound unbelievable when you see her very natural acting on the screen, which is one of the merits of teh film.  The soldier's player Cyrus Abidi is recruited for the role in the shopping center in the Kish Island where the film was shot.  Actually, it was after the original person who was to play the role bailed out.The film is, as I said, shot on the beautiful Kish island on the Persian Gulf, and the island is known as one of the resort places of Iran.  If you want to see more of this beautiful place, see another Iranian film ""The Day I Became a Woman.""All in all, ""Secret Ballot"" is an amusing and thought-provoking film.  The director Babak Payami, who was born in Iran but had lived in Canada for nearly twenty years until 1998, has a knack for realizing the atomosphere of the place.  The film's long sequence may be called overused, and the running time should be shorter than now, ""Secret Ballot"" is a charming film, especially because of its bitter-sweet ending.  Don't follow the story; watch this one very slowly.",3,"(In Fact, It's 3.5 Ponits) One Day, She Came from the Sea...",1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,3184,"['Secret', 'Ballot', 'unique', 'visual', 'image', 'tiny', 'speck', 'airplane', 'shadow', 'something', 'dropping', 'beautiful', 'sunrise', 'something', 'central', 'role', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'low-keyed', 'political', 'satire', 'not', 'will', 'see', 'Iran-Italy', 'production', 'Secret', 'Ballot', 'incongrous', 'pair', 'one', 'laconic', 'soldier', 'guarding', 'somewhere', 'sleepy', 'coast', 'unnamed', 'island', 'Iran', 'talkative', 'female', 'civil', 'servant', 'coming', 'there', 'collect', 'votes', 'election', 'latter', 'complete', 'job', '5', 'p.m.', 'soldier', 'great', 'dismay', 'ordered', 'accompany', 'island.The', 'small', 'tour', 'filled', 'episodes', 'concerning', 'task', 'not', 'many', 'islanders', 'are', 'friendly', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'job', 'spite', 'lofty', 'idealism', 'unstoppable', 'energy', 'job', 'out', 'nothing', 'smooth', 'differences', 'belief', 'custom', 'language', 'so', 'many', 'unexpected', 'things', 'happen', 'one', 'votes', 'even', 'hidden', 'rock.To', 'see', 'doing', 'best', 'still', 'not', 'disillusion', 'democracy', 'general', 'see', 'point', 'film', 'clear', 'asset', 'film', 'underplayed', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'two', 'leads', 'Watching', 'never-ending', 'struggle', 'soldier', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'very', 'hostile', 'gradually', 'attitudes', 'appointed', 'time', 'leave', 'near', 'also', 'understand', 'feelings', 'words', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'point', 'why', 'slightly', 'surprise', 'ending', 'entire', 'film', 'more', 'pathos', 'expect', 'No', 'longer', 'island', 'sleepy', 'place', 'soldier.As', 'often', 'case', 'Iranian', 'films', 'Secret', 'Ballot', 'slow-paced', 'would', 'require', 'patience', 'case', 'feel', 'sleepy', 'confess', 'did', 'might', 'know', 'following', 'facts', 'film', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'fact', 'non-professionals', 'heroine', 'Nassim', 'Abidi', 'student', 'majoring', 'journalism', 'college', 'director', 'managed', 'persuade', 'join', 'film', 'great', 'reluctance', 'side', 'episode', 'may', 'sound', 'unbelievable', 'when', 'see', 'very', 'natural', 'acting', 'screen', 'one', 'merits', 'teh', 'film', 'soldier', 'player', 'Cyrus', 'Abidi', 'recruited', 'role', 'shopping', 'center', 'Kish', 'Island', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Actually', 'was', 'original', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'play', 'role', 'bailed', 'out.The', 'film', 'said', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'Kish', 'island', 'Persian', 'Gulf', 'island', 'known', 'one', 'resort', 'places', 'Iran', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'beautiful', 'place', 'see', 'Iranian', 'film', 'Day', 'Became', 'Woman', 'Secret', 'Ballot', 'amusing', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'director', 'Babak', 'Payami', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Iran', 'had', 'lived', 'Canada', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', '1998', 'knack', 'realizing', 'atomosphere', 'place', 'film', 'long', 'sequence', 'may', 'be', 'called', 'overused', 'running', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'shorter', 'now', 'Secret', 'Ballot', 'charming', 'film', 'especially', 'bitter-sweet', 'ending', 'Do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'story', 'watch', 'one', 'very', 'slowly']",Secret Ballot
