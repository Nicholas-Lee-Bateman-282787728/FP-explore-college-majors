454911,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,630522661X,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[15, 18]","Anyone wanting to see ""Patton"" Part II in this film will be very disappointed; the films are different in pacing, outlook, and genre, and it is to George C. Scott's credit that he could portray both parts with equal skill, and perhaps this one was the hardest, to keep our interest (and I found it to be a fascinating film) while lying paralyzed in bed.In the 1970 ""Patton"", the general was in his prime and at his best, with a sense of purpose...once the war was won, his reason for living came to an end, and he could not handle the political aspects of ""winning the peace"", with the constant pressure of having to present the ""politically correct"" stance towards the media; in many ways this is a timely film to watch, as the reconstruction phase of Germany was similar to present day Iraq, with chaos and some of the former regime clinging on to remnants of power, and a media bent on finding fault with the process.After a tragic car accident, in which General Patton was paralyzed from the neck down, it was a matter of waiting out the final hours. The script by William Luce is poignant and often poetic, and the acting by the entire cast excellent. The two women in his life are played with sensitivity, his wife by Eva Marie Saint, and mistress by Kathryn Leigh Scott. Many scenes are recalled from his youth in flashback  (Ron Berglas plays the young Lt. Patton), some of it quite touching.Others of note in the cast are Murray Hamilton as his good friend Gen. ""Hap"" Gay, Ed Lauter as Dr. Lt. Col. Paul Hill, and Richard Dysart as Gen. Eisenhower.Filmed on location in England (the countryside shots are lovely), and directed for television by Delbert Mann, this is a serious film on a serious subject, and one many of us have been faced with, whether with an ailing parent, or the eventuality of our own passing. General Patton confronted his destiny with courage, and the love of a patient, strong woman, and said ""dying has always intrigued me...I'm not afraid, only curious"".This is way above average TV fare, with a brilliant performance by Scott, and total running time is 146 minutes.",5,"""death and the general, arm in arm""",1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,2101,"['Anyone', 'wanting', 'see', 'Patton', 'Part', 'II', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'films', 'are', 'different', 'pacing', 'outlook', 'genre', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'credit', 'could', 'portray', 'parts', 'equal', 'skill', 'perhaps', 'one', 'was', 'hardest', 'keep', 'interest', 'found', 'be', 'fascinating', 'film', 'lying', 'paralyzed', 'bed.In', '1970', 'Patton', 'general', 'was', 'prime', 'best', 'sense', 'purpose', 'once', 'war', 'was', 'won', 'reason', 'living', 'came', 'end', 'could', 'not', 'handle', 'political', 'aspects', 'winning', 'peace', 'constant', 'pressure', 'having', 'present', 'politically', 'correct', 'stance', 'media', 'many', 'ways', 'timely', 'film', 'watch', 'reconstruction', 'phase', 'Germany', 'was', 'similar', 'present', 'day', 'Iraq', 'chaos', 'former', 'regime', 'clinging', 'remnants', 'power', 'media', 'bent', 'finding', 'fault', 'process.After', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'General', 'Patton', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'neck', 'down', 'was', 'matter', 'waiting', 'out', 'final', 'hours', 'script', 'William', 'Luce', 'poignant', 'often', 'poetic', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'excellent', 'two', 'women', 'life', 'are', 'played', 'sensitivity', 'wife', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'mistress', 'Kathryn', 'Leigh', 'Scott', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'recalled', 'youth', 'flashback', 'Ron', 'Berglas', 'young', 'Lt.', 'Patton', 'quite', 'touching.Others', 'note', 'cast', 'are', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'good', 'friend', 'Gen.', 'Hap', 'Gay', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'Dr.', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Paul', 'Hill', 'Richard', 'Dysart', 'Gen.', 'Eisenhower.Filmed', 'location', 'England', 'countryside', 'shots', 'are', 'lovely', 'directed', 'television', 'Delbert', 'Mann', 'serious', 'film', 'serious', 'subject', 'one', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'faced', 'ailing', 'parent', 'eventuality', 'own', 'passing', 'General', 'Patton', 'confronted', 'destiny', 'courage', 'love', 'patient', 'strong', 'woman', 'said', 'dying', 'always', 'intrigued', ""'m"", 'not', 'afraid', 'only', 'curious', '.This', 'way', 'average', 'TV', 'fare', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Scott', 'total', 'running', 'time', '146', 'minutes']",Last Days of Patton VHS

I watched the movie this morning.The acting is superb, as is expected from the cast, and the first hour is full of suspense and build-up.  We see the tension between Eisenhower and Patton, we see Patton's respect for the German prisoners, and we learn about Patton's distaste for the Russians. But did Eisenhower want to hear that? No, he instead ""transferred"" him to a ""paper Army"" (Patton's words) where we see his depression start to mount.The accident happens in the second hour, but the last 90 minutes drag and drag.  The last 90 minutes we see Patton slowly fading in mind and body as he lays in his hospital bed.  Gone are his wit and acuteness.  All the viewer has now is the dialogue of the supporting actors, which is dull at best.  The end finale then comes abruptly as he dies and the camera lights fade and zoom out from his bed.As for production and connectivity, my download connection rated ""poor"" to ""good"" for most of the viewing, showing one to two bars under the ""connection"" meter.

454918,ABV17UGYVAOE,630522661X,Charles de Plume,"[7, 8]","BALONEYI'm glad the overall rating for this film is 4 stars. I say, Baloney, to the nitpickers. This is a very, very fine film that treats both the facts and the book upon which this film is based with accuracy and sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with the long final scene with Patton talking non-stop while lying in a hospital bed. In some ways, that is more about the true Patton than the image of him barking out orders. This death scene, in my view, is an achievement in biographical film making. True, some facts in the film were softened, such as Ike's chastisements of Patton, turning the final interview into an austere reprimand rather than the catalysimic destruction of a friendship that it was. And Patton was secretly under observation for signs of psychopathology (good thing our Civil War generals didn't live in the 20th Century!) And Patton was a lot more disgusted with the European Jews--and a lot chummier with the German Regular Army officers, than depicted in the film, but these facts are suggested in the film. And I feel that all of this is okay. Generally speaking, this genre is watched by history buffs, anyway, and we can fill in the blanks. We should all know by now that there's only so much you can do with a two-hour movie. I'll never forget the scene of Patton's wife in a powder blue dress and floppy hat test-driving a prototype tank in front of the mossback Cavalry Generals. By the way, Scott was 42 years old when he performed in the original PATTON. General Patton himself was between ages 59 to 60 during WW2. In this present film, Scott is the same age as Patton was.

454923,A1Z4VB9DA01AXP,630522661X,"Gregory Canellis ""Student of military history...","[101, 106]","Actor George C. Scott delivers an encore performance of his most famous character: Lt. Gen. George S. Patton Jr. Just as the original ""Patton"" was based in part on Ladislas Farago's biography ""Patton: Ordeal and Triumph,"" so too is the sequel based on Farago's second installment of the same title.It is ironic, perhaps that Scott seems tired in this follow-up role and does not deliver a tour de force comparable to his original performance. Then again, the real life Patton was also tired: relieved of command of his beloved Third Army for not being what today would be termed ""politically correct,"" and instead placed in command of a ""paper army"" whose mission was to write the history of the Second WorldWar. Disgruntled with the turn his military career had taken, Patton was to return home, hang up his ivory-handled pistols for good and write a tell all memoir. A day of pheasant hunting in Germany was all that seperated Patton the soldier from Patton the civilian. The out-spoken general never made it. He suffered a broken neck en route in a silly fender-bender with an army 6 x 6 and died of complications twelve days later.  In spite of Scott's subdued portrayal of Patton II, the scenes are superb; the supporting cast top-notch; and the story-line, including the usual amount of dramatic license, holds true to the facts. Throughout the film, the viewer is treated to flashbacks memories of Patton's earlier life as a child, as a young junior officer, and themes the first ""Patton"" dared not touch, such as  Patton's supposed wartime affair with his wife's niece, a woman half the general's age. Unlike the first ""Patton,"" these flashbacks give the film a true biographical feel. I was touched with the strength his wife Beatrice exhibited by her husband's side, reading to him from his favorite books by the likes of Napolean and other great captains while her injured husband lay with a head brace and fish hooks embedded in his scalp in an effort to support his shattered neck.

Patton wrestles with how to handle post-war Bavaria:  Should he exclude Nazis from the new government, or should he include them to speed rebuilding? Should he allow SS members to continue to train in the prison camps? He clashes with Ike, and frets over not having men to lead in battle.Life after the German surrender was nothing but worsening problems for the general, what with his chafing at running a bureaucracy, his stripping of authority by Ike, and finally on the day before he was to ship home, getting into a freak accident that broke his neck and paralyzed him.I'm not sure some of the critics of this film appreciate how well Scott does with a tremendous challenge of depicting a physically dead man from the neck down, a man who once moved armies in one of the most important times in modern history, now bedridden and suspecting he faces death despite his doctors' forced cheer. It is touching to see his wife scramble to his side to comfort him and read him books, and disconcerting to know that her niece appears to be having an illicit affair with her own uncle-by-marriage.This is a dark film, as it watches Patton's wife struggle with her husband's rather brave acceptance that he is transitioning towards death, and find bravery within herself as well.Finally, as my husband observes, the best thing that happened to Patton was having George C.

Unfortunately, this seems to have been a mistake. The sequel has little of the quality of the original movie and even less interest. As biography, it was fair. As entertainment, it was a bore.Scott still manages to maintain the image of the famous general. His bull headedness is present as is his conviction that he is the only savior of western civilization. So to does the impression that for Patton there is no calling more honorable than that of the soldier, even enemy soldiers. This comes out early in the movie while the general was assigned as the military governor of Bavaria. He dresses down some SS prisoners for thei slovenly ways and even they resond to his leadership style. There is a purpose to it, though, he wants them ready to fight under his command should the need to confront the Soviets arrise.Patton's nature puts him at loggerheads with his superiors and the press. Eventually, he is to be releived for cause but fate intervenes in the form of an auto accident. The general breaks his neck and is paralyzed THe second half of the movie deals with his reaction, that of his family and friends and also that of politicians and the press.There is very little excitment in this production. It relies heavily on dialog that could have been better. It also places some reliance on flashbacks which were inteded to demonstrate what kind of a man the general was. Some of these are effective; most are not. In general, it is a fairly boring movie.There is some truth to the argument that the movie has some merit just as a biography. It does a fairly credible job of pointing out the conflicts in play right after the second world war. It aslo depicts the events concerned mostly as they happened. It is still boring.The quality of the DVD also leaves much to be desired. Some of this is because this was a made for TV movie but much of the blame can be laid on the transfer itself. It has a tendency to skips and miss frames. Based on other reviews, I was not the only one to have this problem.If your are a fan of historical biography, this movie may appeal to you.

The book details Patton's activities during the last months of the war and continues to his untimely demise.  It also briefly explored the conspiracy theory's surrounding Patton's accident.  Unfortunately the movie concentrates on George S. Patton Jr.'s time as military governor, thinly veiled attempts to militarily rehabilitate German POWs incarcerated in Bavaria, and blatant animosity toward the Soviets.  Additionally, the film spends an awful lot of time on a paralyzed Patton, complete with flashbacks,  imobilized in his hospital bed.It was great to see George C. Scott reprise his role as Patton.  The problem was that it was easier for a late 1960s Scott to be made up to appear as an older general in PATTON than it was to tackle the problem of an older and more stout Scott as Patton in the 1986 television movie.  Scott was just too plump for the role and those overly puffy white eyebrows were more appropriate for Santa Claus than Patton.Remember too that this was a television movie filmed in Great Britain.  As such, the budget and associated production was not that of the original motion picture.  The US military vehicles are obviously from museums and private collector collections as the gray-green paint is absolutely perfect.  Likewise the GIs appear to be wearing less authentic looking period uniforms.  Additionally, where the original PATTON was filmed in a variety of Spanish locations including beaches, desert, and thick forest, LAST DAYS is mired in limited British locations.  In one scene the painted matte background of the Bavarian Alps is phony and distracting.Although I cannot imagine anyone other than George C. Scott playing the part of Patton, he was not physically ready to take on the role.  Remember that the previous year Scott also portrayed a very chubby Benito Mussolini in MUSSOLINI: THE UNTOLD STORY.  Other former 'Pattons', such as George Kennedy, Kirk Douglas, and Darren McGavin never fit the role. This movie probably should never have been made in the first place, or limited as a narrarated docu-drama.THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON  is as far removed from the original wide-screen movie as THE DIRTY DOZEN: (THE) NEXT MISSION is from the first THE DIRTY DOZEN film.Worse for the film is that its sale and distribution, much like older movies that entered the public domain, have fallen to several different media companies.  As such you can find this movie with different covers, sometimes matched with other movies, and differing quality.

Though I was disappointed with this film, I wanted more at the end. I felt the flashbacks did not go deep enough into his early life. It was almost as if this film came from scenes cut from the first movie, which won eight Academy Awards, and the flashbacks were filmed later and spliced in.  Because of this, The Last Days of Patton dragged at times. The producer and director should have put more time into the flashbacks. This might have remedied that problem. It's too bad that Patton died before he had a chance to retire and write his memoir. Since he was the type of man who spoke out about what he believed (which got him in trouble more than once even if he was right most of the time), his memoir would have been a great read.

Scott, reprising his role as General Patton.Alas, one can guess the source of this DVD. A VHS tape.I already owned the original Fox VHS tape, which I will continue to keep.Yet, in quality, both are equivalent, neither worse, nor better.The only minus lies in the fact that the DVD sports an evident superimposed logo on one corner of the image.But this is not disturbing, since it is halfway transparent.Yet they could have done without it.So, back to the contents of this made-for-TV movie.First of all, it comes in its original full content version, running slightly over three hours long.The acting is fair for this kind of movie.Names such as Murray Hamilton, Eva Marie Saint and Daniel Benzali (in one of his earliest appearances), giveyou an idea of the caliber of actors involved.As the title states, this is a more or less faithful account of the last days of Patton, involving him as theMilitary Governor of occupied Bavaria and his relations and conflicts with General Eisenhower, which encompassesthe first half of the movie, to the tragic car accident that caused him to break his neck and surviving it fora while (the second part of the movie).We are also introduced into some flashbacks on Patton's earlier military career and his struggles to transforma static Army, into a rolling and moving Force.We get to see some of his romantic life and finally, is ultimate battle with Death itself.He died a hero and consequent to what he believed in.It is a very touching and moving picture of a very controversial historic figure, but despite all his humanfrailties this big hulk of a man demonstrates that one can keep his dignity even to the end.He was a fighter, beloved and perhaps even hated by those who knew him personally, but at least he was one manwho helped move things along in a time where many were too scared to act.He was a leader, he was a war philosopher, a classic hero, like those he worshiped from Ancient History, andtherefore he may be considered sitting in the Pantheon of these peers of his.This movie is a worthy complement to ""Patton"".If only 20th Century-Fox would care to pick it up again, restore its original filmed material, digitalize itand transfer it cleanly on DVD, they would have the appreciation of many who did appreciate and love the workdone on the transfer of ""Patton"".Only time will tell, but I am sure, one day, someone may wake up and smell the coffee...In the meantime, I can recommend this as an interim to that next version.As said, it is not worse, nor better than its VHS counterpart, but being this a DVD, brings a more durable platformto it.To me it is a worthy investment, if just as a
