It has character, it's artsy, daring, and nicely put together. Actors are nicely cast. Settings are really good. I rented the movie first, now I own it and will skip through that ""bus scene"".

1289291,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002TZS5NI,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 7]","Perhaps this is a re-telling of the Russian RUSALKA legend, I don't know .... however, thanks to the diligent Review Police, I have been duly 'warned' that a RUSALKA is a Slavic water sprite, originating with the spirit of someone who died too young or died wrongfully. These water sprites, I am told, return to haunt the living. However, all my checks into Russian dictionaries say a ""rusalka"" is a ""mermaid"". Also there are other films by the title ""Rusalka"" and of course the classical music pice by Dvorak (I think).Film is whatever it represents plus the audience to whom it represents itself. So I will tell you my impressions, since that is what a critic does.RUSALKA (the original proper Russian title of ""MERMAID"") a 2007 offering set in 2008 (there's a calendar in the film) was as disturbing as it was enlightening. While I've always thought most Russian film was too heavy and humorless, it has a lot to teach us about the nitty gritty of human nature. Off the bat, I can't understand why this film was titled ""Mermaid"" instead of ""Moon Child"".Young Alisa (the astoundingly youthful 27-year-old Masha Shalaeva a/k/a Shalayeva), here playing a teen from the seaside, moves with her family to Moscow. Alisa seems to be somewhat autistic (she has recently graduated from a special ed school), though she is smart and has the power, like a Jedi, to affect events for the benefit of others. She truly is magical, and with her beauty (which I found as an anthropologist to be riveting) she presents a profound character. She is sweet, innocent and lonely--this actress can really communicate all that without a word.Bouncing around the streets of Moscow with no clues about life, she experiments with the idea of standing at the edge of a high bridge. A handsome young man blows past her and attempts suicide, jumping in the water. Well, Alisa being who she is immediately follows him to save him. He identifies himself in a drunken stupor as Sasha, but he is really Alexandr Mitrevitch (a beautiful actor named Evgeny Tsyganov). Alisa gets him home and decides she will clean house for him...which she never does. She innocently spends several nights sleeping on his couch, while he grumpily goes to work selling plots on the moon.You read that right: the moon. Alexandr has become wealthy from this sci-fi real estate venue. When he is stuck for a model to present as the company's ""moon child"", Alisa appears accidentally on camera. Instant fame. And Alexandr is falling for her in an avuncular way. Never does he try to invade her privacy or violate her, even when she tells him she loves him. I guess the big nitpicky idea is his ""Moon Girl"" is a water sprite, there to save him form the dregs of materialism, which have evidently sucked his soul dry. Ah well, ho-hum.I cannot give away too much, as the three reviewers before me have said. There is too much to see and feel. I must issue a warning: this film has a number of savage scenes (in my opinion) and I felt enraged, robbed and bereft at the end. I will not spoil that either, but I suppose any half-wit can guess at the ending anyway.This film is amateurish and annoying as hell in certain places. It was like a music video with no music, as if everyone was on acid when they shot this film. Certainly everyone acts like they're high all the time...and I DO NOT LIKE THAT.Another thing I cannot stand is even a HINT of exploitation of developmental disabilities. I think too many films like this get away with too much, and this film is no different, no matter how many people scream that the girl is a water sprite or angel or whatever. Exploitation of the mentally challenged always begins with what beautiful little angels they are. This is much like the constant insistence on portraying people with albinism as villains and monsters.I have albinism, mild autism and other troubles. I am very, very sensitive to things others care little to notice.If I knew for sure the character of Alisa is supposed to be disabled, I would take yet another star from it. That is why I give it a generous 2 stars under the circumstances. On the other hand, if this is a fairy tale about a truly out-of-place humanoid dealing with lousy regular humans, why don't they just say so?Too much Russian roulette for my taste!Perhaps you will see something other than what I saw in this less-than-mediocre story. Perhaps Russia is reaching a breakthrough in film today, like we did back in the 1970s. I leave you to judge all that. One last thing: anyone expecting this film to be like the equally annoying AMELIE will be very unhappy.",2,"Mermaids, Russian-style",1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,4587,"['Perhaps', 're-telling', 'Russian', 'RUSALKA', 'legend', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'however', 'thanks', 'diligent', 'Review', 'Police', 'have', 'been', 'duly', ""'warned"", 'RUSALKA', 'Slavic', 'water', 'sprite', 'originating', 'spirit', 'someone', 'who', 'died', 'too', 'young', 'died', 'wrongfully', 'water', 'sprites', 'am', 'told', 'return', 'haunt', 'living', 'However', 'checks', 'Russian', 'dictionaries', 'say', 'rusalka', 'mermaid', 'Also', 'are', 'other', 'films', 'title', 'Rusalka', 'course', 'classical', 'music', 'pice', 'Dvorak', 'think', '.Film', 'audience', 'whom', 'So', 'will', 'tell', 'impressions', 'what', 'critic', 'does.RUSALKA', 'original', 'proper', 'Russian', 'title', 'MERMAID', '2007', 'offering', 'set', '2008', 'calendar', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'disturbing', 'was', 'enlightening', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'most', 'Russian', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'heavy', 'humorless', 'lot', 'teach', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'human', 'nature', 'bat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'titled', 'Mermaid', 'instead', 'Moon', 'Child', '.Young', 'Alisa', 'astoundingly', 'youthful', '27-year-old', 'Masha', 'Shalaeva', 'Shalayeva', 'here', 'playing', 'teen', 'seaside', 'moves', 'family', 'Moscow', 'Alisa', 'be', 'somewhat', 'autistic', 'recently', 'graduated', 'special', 'ed', 'school', 'smart', 'power', 'Jedi', 'affect', 'events', 'benefit', 'others', 'truly', 'magical', 'beauty', 'found', 'anthropologist', 'be', 'riveting', 'profound', 'character', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'lonely', 'actress', 'can', 'really', 'communicate', 'word.Bouncing', 'streets', 'Moscow', 'clues', 'life', 'idea', 'standing', 'edge', 'high', 'bridge', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'water', 'Well', 'Alisa', 'being', 'who', 'immediately', 'save', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'Sasha', 'really', 'Alexandr', 'Mitrevitch', 'beautiful', 'actor', 'named', 'Evgeny', 'Tsyganov', 'Alisa', 'home', 'will', 'clean', 'house', 'never', 'innocently', 'several', 'nights', 'sleeping', 'couch', 'grumpily', 'work', 'selling', 'plots', 'moon.You', 'read', 'right', 'moon', 'Alexandr', 'become', 'wealthy', 'sci-fi', 'real', 'estate', 'venue', 'When', 'stuck', 'model', 'present', 'company', 'moon', 'child', 'Alisa', 'accidentally', 'camera', 'Instant', 'fame', 'Alexandr', 'falling', 'avuncular', 'way', 'Never', 'try', 'invade', 'privacy', 'violate', 'even', 'when', 'guess', 'big', 'nitpicky', 'idea', 'Moon', 'Girl', 'water', 'sprite', 'save', 'form', 'dregs', 'materialism', 'have', 'evidently', 'sucked', 'soul', 'dry', 'Ah', 'well', 'ho-hum.I', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'three', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'too', 'much', 'see', 'feel', 'must', 'issue', 'warning', 'film', 'number', 'savage', 'scenes', 'opinion', 'felt', 'enraged', 'robbed', 'bereft', 'end', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'suppose', 'half-wit', 'can', 'guess', 'ending', 'anyway.This', 'film', 'amateurish', 'annoying', 'as', 'hell', 'certain', 'places', 'was', 'music', 'video', 'music', 'everyone', 'was', 'acid', 'when', 'shot', 'film', 'Certainly', 'everyone', 'acts', ""'re"", 'high', 'time', 'DO', 'NOT', 'LIKE', 'THAT.Another', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'even', 'HINT', 'exploitation', 'developmental', 'disabilities', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'get', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'different', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'scream', 'girl', 'water', 'sprite', 'angel', 'Exploitation', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'always', 'what', 'beautiful', 'little', 'angels', 'are', 'much', 'constant', 'insistence', 'portraying', 'people', 'albinism', 'villains', 'monsters.I', 'have', 'albinism', 'mild', 'autism', 'other', 'troubles', 'am', 'very', 'very', 'sensitive', 'things', 'others', 'care', 'little', 'notice.If', 'knew', 'sure', 'character', 'Alisa', 'supposed', 'be', 'disabled', 'would', 'take', 'yet', 'star', 'why', 'give', 'generous', '2', 'stars', 'circumstances', 'other', 'hand', 'fairy', 'tale', 'truly', 'out-of-place', 'humanoid', 'dealing', 'lousy', 'regular', 'humans', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'say', 'so', 'Too', 'much', 'Russian', 'roulette', 'taste', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'see', 'something', 'other', 'what', 'saw', 'less-than-mediocre', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'Russia', 'reaching', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'today', 'did', 'back', '1970s', 'leave', 'judge', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'equally', 'annoying', 'AMELIE', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'unhappy']",N/A

1289293,A317VHIH59WE32,B002TZS5NI,I Wasn't Here,"[3, 4]","I loved this movie. I have a thing for foreign films, so I was excited to try this one out. I suppose the thing people should remember is to keep an open mind, otherwise they may be disappointed, and if you're not the type of person who likes weird films, or foreign films in general, then this probably isn't for you. Also, I think you should not even compare this to Amelie, especially if that is the reason you are watching this. I like Amelie too, but they are very different. I suppose the comparison comes from the heroines, who are both very quirky, loveable young women, and perhaps the slightly off-beat way the story is told and filmed. Just a heads up for those of you who think this is another Amelie.I love the character of Alice, the heroine of Mermaid. She is odd, unique, unreal, and a pleasure to watch. I wouldn't mind seeing more of this actress. She is unlike anyone else.The ending surprised me, which I think it did a lot of people, but I actually liked it. I won't give it away, though. It fit the story, oddly enough, and I was satisfied. Some people hate it, though, so be prepared. Also, this is based off of The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen (the book is different from the Disney movie), and I know people have been complaining that the ending is a cop-out, but it falls in line with the fairytale. I don't think they ended it that way to be shocking or to make it more final, it was just a modern version of what happened in the fairytale.This movie is categorized as a drama, and although it isn't necessarily a happy film, I never felt that it was overly serious or depressing. It's amazing how the film-makers were able to keep it light and giddy throughout. I think that had a lot to do with Alice. She makes you want to smile and is more or less a self-reliant, happy-ish, quirky girl who does her own thing. There is also a slight element of fantasy in this, but not enough to make it a fantasy or supernatural. It has just a touch of fairy tale in it.So, worth watching, but it's not for everyone. Personally, I'll probably end up buying it at some point. I rented it first, which is a good idea for anyone, really. But I personally recommend this lovely, weird movie.",5,Great Film!,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,2216,"['loved', 'movie', 'have', 'thing', 'foreign', 'films', 'was', 'excited', 'try', 'one', 'out', 'suppose', 'thing', 'people', 'should', 'remember', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'otherwise', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'re"", 'not', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'weird', 'films', 'foreign', 'films', 'general', 'then', 'probably', ""n't"", 'Also', 'think', 'should', 'not', 'even', 'compare', 'Amelie', 'especially', 'reason', 'are', 'watching', 'Amelie', 'too', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'suppose', 'comparison', 'heroines', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'quirky', 'loveable', 'young', 'women', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'off-beat', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'filmed', 'Just', 'heads', 'up', 'who', 'think', 'Amelie.I', 'love', 'character', 'Alice', 'heroine', 'Mermaid', 'odd', 'unique', 'unreal', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'more', 'actress', 'anyone', 'else.The', 'ending', 'surprised', 'think', 'did', 'lot', 'people', 'actually', 'liked', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'though', 'fit', 'story', 'oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'satisfied', 'people', 'hate', 'though', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'Also', 'based', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'book', 'different', 'Disney', 'movie', 'know', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'complaining', 'ending', 'cop-out', 'line', 'fairytale', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ended', 'way', 'be', 'shocking', 'make', 'more', 'final', 'was', 'just', 'modern', 'version', 'what', 'happened', 'fairytale.This', 'movie', 'categorized', 'drama', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'happy', 'film', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'overly', 'serious', 'depressing', 'amazing', 'how', 'film-makers', 'were', 'able', 'keep', 'light', 'giddy', 'think', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'Alice', 'want', 'smile', 'more', 'less', 'self-reliant', 'happy-ish', 'quirky', 'girl', 'who', 'own', 'thing', 'also', 'slight', 'element', 'fantasy', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'fantasy', 'supernatural', 'just', 'touch', 'fairy', 'tale', 'it.So', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'everyone', 'Personally', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'point', 'rented', 'first', 'good', 'idea', 'anyone', 'really', 'personally', 'recommend', 'lovely', 'weird', 'movie']",N/A
1289294,A22KG0EAUW6U7I,B002TZS5NI,Lost Wanderer,"[1, 1]","I find it very curious that this lighthearted comedy is somehow polarizing, drawing some harshly negative reactions. The rather unconventional ending, at least from Hollywood/Disney standard, seems to put some people off further. I feel the IFC's official liner notes got the story totally wrong too. ""Alisa, a lonely little girl from a seaside village...believing she has the power to make wishes come true... when forced to move to Moscow, her fairy tale world will collide head-on with the realities of love, innocence and material life in modern Russia"". What???While some people seem to take everything in this movie literally and consider it outrageous, insulting or whatever, to me this really is a fantastic, very sweet ode to not-so-beautiful, not-so-perfect people, like most of us. I do not think ""Mermaid"" compares to ""Amelie"", and that is not a bad thing at all. While in Amelie life is all beautiful and people are all good, Mermaid is a lot closer to the real world where lucky beautiful people take it all.Most of Russian movies distributed in US today are sci-fi/action/epic films full of giddy computer special effects, but ""Mermaid"" is very intelligent, subtle, fantastic a comedy.

Beautifully so. It quietly shows us our own ugliness in preferring surface beauty, glitz, and material things to lasting, spiritual things. It is in no way a dark story, though. It is a story of light; the darkness is there, but it neither understands nor overcomes the light.One thing you have to remember when watching this, particularly when taking in the shocking ending, is that this is based on Hans Christian Anderson's ""Little Mermaid"". Not the Disney version, but Anderson's version, which is not happy. I was outraged by the ending until I realized what I had watched. It isn't obvious. But the original story is there, definitely -- and for my money, this is the most genuinely magical film made of a fairy tale since Jean Cocteau's ""Belle et Bete"".
