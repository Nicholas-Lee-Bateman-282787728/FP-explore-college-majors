869086,A2IIO11GKDUYT9,B0006IIPYE,"Alex Beere ""Alex""","[3, 5]","This movie is a sexual holocaust, but I'm still a believer that such rites of dehumanization do have a place in modern cinema. Someone had to do it, and the fact that it is directed by a woman gives her free license to obliterate the preconceptions of femininity and its plethora of powers and weaknesses. It paints a stark picture of the behavioral patterns which we're forced to adhere to in our day-to-day lives and attacks them in a very blunt fashion. I love it. It's confronting and unrelenting.The French have always known how to gut their audience, and this movie is something I look upon as a challenge. Initially I was set on edge, and its unrelenting subject matter and subsequent exploration of the anatomical mechanisms of sexuality is something which I found to challenge my previous views in many ways.Amira Caser is immaculate in her role, her simple facial expressions portray the complexities of the vulnerable state she allows herself to be placed in throughout the most confronting scenes, with simple and subtle gestures of fear and excitement showing glimpses for all those who choose to absorb this film fully.Perhaps the fact that this movie stars prominent porn actor Rocco could taint its subject to the general audience, but the role he fills demands than he be comfortable and confident in his expression of explicit sexual materials and for this reason I believe he is perfectly suited for the part, and really not a bad actor at the end of the day.My conclusion is that this film is more challenging and abrasive than any horror you've yet seen, and it takes a stronger being who is prepared to explore this topic brutally, without having it painted in a soft light, and for its honesty I must give it full credit.",5,Unjustly overlooked by those with a healthy biblical fear of femaninity,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,1744,"['movie', 'sexual', 'holocaust', ""'m"", 'still', 'believer', 'such', 'rites', 'dehumanization', 'do', 'have', 'place', 'modern', 'cinema', 'Someone', 'had', 'do', 'fact', 'directed', 'woman', 'free', 'license', 'obliterate', 'preconceptions', 'femininity', 'plethora', 'powers', 'weaknesses', 'stark', 'picture', 'behavioral', 'patterns', ""'re"", 'forced', 'adhere', 'day-to-day', 'lives', 'attacks', 'very', 'blunt', 'fashion', 'love', 'confronting', 'unrelenting.The', 'French', 'have', 'always', 'known', 'how', 'gut', 'audience', 'movie', 'something', 'look', 'challenge', 'Initially', 'was', 'set', 'edge', 'unrelenting', 'subject', 'matter', 'subsequent', 'exploration', 'anatomical', 'mechanisms', 'sexuality', 'something', 'found', 'challenge', 'previous', 'views', 'many', 'ways.Amira', 'Caser', 'immaculate', 'role', 'simple', 'facial', 'expressions', 'portray', 'complexities', 'vulnerable', 'state', 'be', 'placed', 'most', 'confronting', 'scenes', 'simple', 'subtle', 'gestures', 'fear', 'excitement', 'showing', 'glimpses', 'who', 'choose', 'absorb', 'film', 'fact', 'movie', 'prominent', 'porn', 'actor', 'Rocco', 'could', 'taint', 'subject', 'general', 'audience', 'role', 'demands', 'be', 'comfortable', 'confident', 'expression', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'materials', 'reason', 'believe', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'part', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'end', 'day.My', 'conclusion', 'film', 'more', 'challenging', 'abrasive', 'horror', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'stronger', 'being', 'who', 'prepared', 'explore', 'topic', 'brutally', 'having', 'painted', 'soft', 'light', 'honesty', 'must', 'give', 'full', 'credit']",N/A
869087,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,B0006IIPYE,Alexiel,"[58, 79]","I suppose it is theoretically possibly that a viewer could be ""shocked"" or ""enthralled"" by this movie if they had never seen anything outside the Hollywood movie and certainly no previous Catherine Breillat movies. But even then, I am skeptical.This movie is boring, and it has a ""been there, done that"" feel from Breillat. This movie's problems are indicative of what I feel is the larger problem plaguing ""art house"" cinema the last couple of years. They have become as formulaic and thoughtlessly perfunctory as your most paint-by-numbers Hollywood romantic comedy. Too many movies that are supposed to be providing intelligent and thought-provoking alternatives to what elitists call ""The Hollywood swill"" are not doing that. Instead, the art house formula has grown distressingly predictable lately. Build a movie around graphic sex and/or violence and let the controversy fly, if anyone actually cares. Maybe some people will jump to your defense and declare your film a masterpiece.Even more distressing though, is the even more prevalent art-house formula of atrributing a bizarre (often sexual or neurotic) character trait and then spending a dreary movie length watching the character fuss and moan and generally be an introverted, narcissistic, navel-gazer over said trait.Example. In Breillat's superior film ""Romance"" a woman feels cut off and empty and sexually and emotionally unsatisfied, so she has degrading sex. Fine. But wait a minute. Didn't we see this in ""Intimacy"" and ""The Piano Teacher"" (the latter being the best of all these films)?And therein lies the problem. It's a formula, just like ""Legally Blonde"" or ""30 Going On 30."" It becomes even more readily apparent when you watch these films, and other films by Breillat as consecutively as you can. If we are taking some of these French films at face value (which I would not advise) we could come to the conclusion, that in France, it is the worst thing on earth to be sexually unsatisfied or repressed. Because, like Breillat, these characters (with the exception of The Piano Teacher) seem to monomaniacal, uninteresting sex zombies. The viewer is treated to ""I'm sexually unsatisfied/repressed. Let us wring our hands over this tragedy and fling melodrama around like nobody's business."" You know the like. People end up mutilating their genitals, or waxing pseudo-philosophical on the ugliness of the female vessel, or having rough, degrading sex, etc.You reach a point where you simply don't care any more. Go ahead, watch a lot of Breillat films as close together as you dare. At the end of them, you simply will not give a damn about these overwrought characters and their sexual neuroses. Honestly. You will begin to wonder: don't these characters have better things to worry about? Or better yet: why should I care or even watch such vapid, one-dimensional characters?The answer to that question is: I don't know. But I do know art house cinema has to do better than give us characters with bizarre character traits and then muddle over them endlessly with precious little else to work with.As for Breillat, ""Anatomy Of Hell"" shows that, short of American director-voyeur of ""kids being bad and having sex, ready, set, be shocked, middle America who's been living under a rock"" Larry Clark (a man content to make the same movie over and over and over again) she may be the most one-track, one-trick, monomaniacal director in the world. She is easily the equal of Woody Allen when it comes to working out your personal neuroses on the screen and calling it art. But at least Allen could take the audience to a larger variety of places. With Breillat, it's just sex, sex, and sex, and ""Anatomy of Hell"" is no different.With regards back to my condemnation of art house cinema as too formulaic in some regards now, it is quite laughable that a mainstream Hollywood film like ""Closer"" (you don't get more mainstream than Jude Law, Julia Roberts, and Natalie Portman at the writing of this), has better dialogue, is more incisiveness and vastly more intelligent, interesting, and ultimately, shocking (shocking us with intellectually brutal truths, not cheap physical acts) than ""Anatomy of Hell."" I find it laughably because the movies on the fringe, the art house cinema, is supposed to be more intelligent and tell us more than the bloated Hollywood mainstream, or so film elitists would have us think.Well, ""Anatomy Of Hell"" soundly proves them wrong. The characters are preposterous and boring. From its ridiculously formulaic and a postmodern style that was dated a decade ago, the main characters of course have no names. Yes, yes, it doesn't take a Michael Bay fan to read into this. The man is a misogynistic straw man to be easily knocked over by women. His character is tantamount to lampooning Archie Bunker and saying ""Take THAT Republicans!"" He finds the female genitals disgusting and likens them to a bird squashed in the film (and that is just delightful, isn't it?).The movie is absurdly heavy-handed, bowed by the force of its own artificial weightiness. If you want inane discussion of the war of the sexes that is almost laughably overwrought, made all the more unbelievable by its own strident seriousness, sounding like something written by a deadly earnest, deadly pretentious 1970s college student, you've come to the right place.I also find the editorial review laughable. It says something to the effect of this movie ""pushing the boundaries of film"" or some such thing. How ludicrous. Director Breillat actually pushed the envelope on shocking sexual imagery back in 1976 with ""Une Vraie Jeune Fille,"" or ""A Real Young Girl,"" a far more shocking and graphic (and better, with more substance and better supported messages) movie than this one. 30 years later, and Breillat hasn't moved one bit - she's jogging in place. What was shocking, interesting, bold, and innovative in 1976 is now dated. It shows how little her filmmaking has grown (and in the ways it has regressed) that in terms of ""pushing the envelope"" on sexual politics and identity she's been upstaged by herself nearly 30 years earlier.Furthermore, some of the best ground in ""Anatomy Of Hell"" was covered in superior fashion in Breillat's ""Romance"" and ""Sex Is Comedy."" Now, neither of those movies are great, but ""Romance"" is a solid 3 star movie. Even the ground it just touches upon does better work with the material than a half hour devoted to the same subject in ""Anatomy of Hell."" After watching the movie, you basically haven't made a journey since the beginning. Like the characters, you're left with an empty experience that has shown or accomplished nothing.So, in conclusion, this movie fails as art, fails in all of its objectives except perhaps repugnance, and it certainly fails as entertainment. I do not recommend it.",1,Boring... more of the same from Catherine Breillat.,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,6811,"['suppose', 'theoretically', 'possibly', 'viewer', 'could', 'be', 'shocked',

The subject matter of the movie has been delved in by others, so I won't waste time on it.A generic woman finds a gay man, to observe her and explore the perception that men have of women. During the course of four nights, the perception is dissected, and examined. The woman expresses, nude, before this male that is not attracted to her, her deepest concepts of the battle of the sexes. He in turn, although by definition not attracted to women, observes, comments and indulges. In the end, as in most of Breillat's movies, the questions are left for the viewer to answer, and also to ask.The actress, Amira Casar is a beauty, and we see a lot of her. The acting is tightly done, and if appears stilted, it is because the situation is in itself stilted.You will need a stong stomach to watch the whole movie, since there is a particularly revolting scene, but even that scene, fits with the story, and with the desire of the woman to be totally exposed, totally vulnerable and totally degraded.I have watched some of Breillat's work (A real young girl, Romance) and to me, this is the deepest, most thought provoking of her movies. As opposed to the previously mentioned ones, that I watched once and resold, or gave away, I shall keep this one, and will probably watch it again, more than once, to dissect it further.The DVD has an interview with the director, and there we find out why a body double was used for the close-up shots: She wanted a hairy person",5,Deep insight,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,1501,"['Breillat', 'best', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'been', 'delved', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'it.A', 'generic', 'woman', 'gay', 'man', 'observe', 'explore', 'perception', 'men', 'have', 'women', 'course', 'four', 'nights', 'perception', 'dissected', 'examined', 'woman', 'nude', 'male', 'not', 'attracted', 'deepest', 'concepts', 'battle', 'sexes', 'turn', 'definition', 'not', 'attracted', 'women', 'observes', 'comments', 'indulges', 'end', 'most', 'Breillat', 'movies', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'viewer', 'answer', 'also', 'ask.The', 'actress', 'Amira', 'Casar', 'beauty', 'see', 'lot', 'acting', 'tightly', 'done', 'stilted', 'situation', 'stilted.You', 'will', 'need', 'stong', 'stomach', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'particularly', 'revolting', 'scene', 'even', 'scene', 'story', 'desire', 'woman', 'be', 'totally', 'exposed', 'totally', 'vulnerable', 'totally', 'degraded.I', 'have', 'watched', 'Breillat', 'work', 'real', 'young', 'girl', 'Romance', 'deepest', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movies', 'opposed', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'ones', 'watched', 'once', 'resold', 'gave', 'away', 'shall', 'keep', 'one', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'more', 'once', 'dissect', 'further.The', 'DVD', 'interview', 'director', 'there', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'body', 'double', 'was', 'used', 'close-up', 'shots', 'wanted', 'hairy', 'person']",N/A
869090,ARA48345JZPZR,B0006IIPYE,Archmaker,"[57, 70]","Do you know what you get when you combine porn with art?  Lousy porn and even lousier art.  Curiosity and some rapturous reviews brought me to Catherine Breillart's films, which I find so dismal I usually wouldn't bother to write about them.  But I find the intellectual acrobatics involved in elevating this type of fetishistic dreck into something someone finds profound most interesting and symptomatic of the exhaustion of both the art and the intellectualism that explains it.Breillart's claim to fame is this marriage of full frontal, hard core porn with her particular intellectual conceits.  Here we have another demented Frenchwoman working out her ""issues"" while having her own very special vagina monologues with a gay man as the camera practically inserts itself in every orifice.  Wonderful.I suppose everything worth doing has been done in art.  That is the only explanation for this bankrupt and disheartening work.  It isn't that anything is taboo or that the subject matter is off-limits. The male/female dichotomy and sexual relations have always been the subject of art. It is in the execution.  The films I've seen so far just aren't very good.The use of shocking and graphic images here is not insightful, nor does it represent anything revolutionary.  They make no statement.  They don't breathe life into film, they breathe decay and decline.  This is the art of exhaustion and despair.  This is the graphic image for its own sake.Breillart represents nothing more than the celebration of the mediocre.  The elevation of mundane rubbish to supposed high art. The never ending contest to out-sensationalize.  You could throw a fistful of crap against a wall, and someone would consider it brilliant.  Some of us, however, still see it as crap-on-the-wall.  A monkey can play with his dung, but he can't write a symphony or a sonnet, and if we exhalt the one, it must be to the detriment of the other.I don't want to belabor this and ruminate too long on something that is, after all, only a movie that few people will watch, and fewer still will rhapsodize over.  I believe that this type of stuff wears itself out and is fairly quickly forgotten. There are only so many ways to shock and sensationalize.  Watching Breillart work out her fetishes on screen is recommended soley for the seriously bored.The ugly, sordid, scatological, and perverse abounds in this life, and it doesn't take a lot of imagination to exhibit it.

The film makes a rather stilted commentary centred around the notion of the Other, and of how as the Subject, we are desperate, if not phenomenally suicidal, to constantly yearn for the look of the Other to reflect upon our physical selves which we cannot escape, which is both a necessary ""evil"" and self-sustaining as it is tormenting and perpetually unfulfilled. Breillat is only excused by the highly symbolic, theatrical style of the film with a disclaimer that relinquishes the reality of the characters portrayed.The choice of Siffredi as the male lead couldn't have been more surprising - few mainstream actors would have gone to the extent of no-bars-held in displaying their endowment aroused - close-up and in full glory. Siffredi's portfolio wouldn't stifle audiences more familiar with his pornographic work to boredom; his role in the film is highly restrained in the emotional sense, and there is a certain heightened sense of eroticism that goes with it. Amira on the other hand, plays a dejected Venus fallen from adoration - bordering on the inane and desperately seeking ways to turn the most quietly staunched of misogynists to reconsider sexuality in all its face value.Unfortunately for all the philosophical postulations, the film is led more by the attempts to revolt and to shock, rather than to make a genuine attempt at examining the relations between the sexes. The man played by Siffredi could have not engaged in torrid sex with the woman - but the film would have lost its focus and the entire point that resolves in mutual sexual gratification, so that in the end, the entire film is more of an arthouse porn than art.Fans and non-fans of Siffredi alike, this DVD is a collectable tribute to him in his prime.",3,Fine Arthouse Porn,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,1905,"['Anatomy', 'Hell', 'metaphorical', 'reference', 'nether', 'realm', ""'m"", 'not', 'wrong', 'Briellat', 'adaptation', 'Jean-Paul', 'Sartre', 'famous', 'quote', 'Hell', 'Other', 'film', 'rather', 'stilted', 'commentary', 'centred', 'notion', 'Other', 'how', 'Subject', 'are', 'desperate', 'not', 'phenomenally', 'suicidal', 'constantly', 'yearn', 'look', 'Other', 'reflect', 'physical', 'selves', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'necessary', 'evil', 'self-sustaining', 'tormenting', 'perpetually', 'unfulfilled', 'Breillat', 'only', 'excused', 'highly', 'symbolic', 'theatrical', 'style', 'film', 'disclaimer', 'reality', 'characters', 'portrayed.The', 'choice', 'Siffredi', 'male', 'lead', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'surprising', 'few', 'mainstream', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'extent', 'no-bars-held', 'displaying', 'endowment', 'aroused', 'close-up', 'full', 'glory', 'Siffredi', 'portfolio', 'would', ""n't"", 'stifle', 'audiences', 'more', 'familiar', 'pornographic', 'work', 'boredom', 'role', 'film', 'highly', 'restrained', 'emotional', 'sense', 'certain', 'heightened', 'sense', 'eroticism', 'Amira', 'other', 'hand', 'dejected', 'Venus', 'fallen', 'adoration', 'bordering', 'inane', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'ways', 'turn', 'most', 'quietly', 'staunched', 'misogynists', 'reconsider', 'sexuality', 'face', 'value.Unfortunately', 'philosophical', 'postulations', 'film', 'led', 'more', 'attempts', 'revolt', 'shock', 'rather', 'make', 'genuine', 'attempt', 'examining', 'relations', 'sexes', 'man', 'played', 'Siffredi', 'could', 'have', 'not', 'engaged', 'torrid', 'sex', 'woman', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'focus', 'entire', 'point', 'mutual', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'end', 'entire', 'film', 'more', 'arthouse', 'porn', 'art.Fans', 'non-fans', 'Siffredi', 'alike', 'DVD', 'collectable', 'tribute', 'prime']",N/A

No more necessary than if the man had done a tit for tat and shat on the bed after a similar discourse on his sexualityI. ( at least he had the grace to treat it as accidental to buggery ) A high percentage of sex or its politics is not about making babies so the biology of wombs as she would have it is irrelevant. It is what makes humans different from animals.Her real question is why do men treat her blood like feces. They don't.

Or just observe the indiscriminative gun use in film .Blood is the first thing to spill. Men are therefore alarmed fearfull and repulsed by the overlap because it is enough of a turn-off from having sex or on an instinctual level to procreate. In this respect her film devolved at the end into feminine/ feminist self-indulgent Navel gazing that lacked scope.

None of her films are done for shock value.  This is my favorite among her work.  The performances are superb, especially that of Rocco Siffredi, who is a real porn star in Italy.  Breillat cast him because he was unafraid of the part, and she also added that ""most French actors aren't very handsome"".  He acquits himself quite well, and shows that a porn star can act.  More often than not, porn stars are terrible actors, as porn doesn't require any emotions, just stamina.  Breillat understands the true complexity of relationships, and it unnerves people.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 4]","There are many different types of films, with extremes at either end, and somewhere in the middle the balance that mainstream cinema exploits.  ""Anatomy of Hell"" isn't a mainstream movie, it's the kind of film mainstream audiences run from.  It's the kind of movie that unsuspecting pedestrians campaign against, dismiss, and attack - all without ever actually trying to understand what it's about.  It's a film made by a woman, and perhaps only a woman could have made it. Having seen this movie tonight I must say I was quite shocked at the contents in Catherine Breillats ""Anatomy of Hell"" because this film makes it my orientation of her work.The plot of the film couldn't be simpler.  Man meets woman, woman offers to pay man to watch her at night in her home, so that he might learn about women and himself.  The man is gay, so sexually he has no interest in her.  However, he's also human and that's it.  This minimalist plot is what everything else hangs upon, don't be expecting extravagant sets or fancy lighting effects, this movie takes place in three locations, and two of those are used only briefly. I personally thought this film was great because it shines a light on the darker side of life focusing on the relationship between heterosexual women, ""Amira Casar"" and a homosexual man"" Rocco Siffredi."" The film did make me wonder if things like this actually go on in real life but I won't be surprise if it does. Some parts in this film I personally thought should have been left out but then again that will defeats the purpose of Breillats work. There's one specific part in this film which almost made me gag and unfortunately I was drinking fruit punch unaware of that upcoming scene.In the end we know not of their pasts, but we find that they both must discover something about themselves - since they willingly enter into a contract. This may be, on one hand, discovery about one's sexuality, and on the other, discovery of explaining one's sexuality. I am sure many others will see this simply as a pretentious effort at describing feminism. This is an argument of our culture, and my view is that human culture is primarily male dominated (the few remaining matriarchal societies are being eradicated by logging :( and so many people will be offended by the content of the film.

Especially when I have some understanding of the ground I'm going to cover before engaging in a Catherine Breillat film-watching experience.  I actually enjoyed her filmFat Girltremendously, and I even liked and recommend the more obviously gratuitous movieRomance.  If Breillat is a voice for womenkind, then those graphic films had a more concrete bone to pick with mankind.  Anatomy of Hell is a film that tries even harder to successfully offer the idea that pornography, which in some cases this film turns out to be, can in fact be made effectively by a good director, albeit the means here as opposed to pornography are intended to serve a far more worthy end.  Breillat is a filmmaker with merit but this particular film's message, if it exists at all, is so abstract that it gets completely lost and suddenly the accusations that Breillat is intentionally trying to offend us creep up from the dark again to spoil her valiant crusade against the crimes of man.  It is a shame because I really cherish the idea that a filmmaker of Breillat's boldness can and does exist.Anatomy of Hell, or Anatomie de l'enfer, is actually adapted from Breillat's novelPornocratie.  It follows an unnamed and troubled woman (Amira Casar) who meets an unnamed homosexual man (Rocco Siffredi) under some pretty dire circumstances.  After their initial encounter she makes a strange request that the man watch over her for four days.  During this time the conversations get very obscure, probably a bit pretentious, and of course the dialogue seems to me completely unlikely to come from anyone's mouth.  I will admit my French is not good enough to follow these scenes without subtitles so perhaps the conversations went over my head due to poor translation, but I doubt it.I guess the point of the film was not completely over my head.  Breillat clearly wants us to look into the rawness of a woman no matter how ugly and unpleasant it has the potential to be.  However, in my view, she goes far beyond that for the sake of shock and I'm not so sure I'm willing to forgive that, so the film really fails for me.

869102,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B0006IIPYE,Margaux Paschke,"[63, 68]","The film is very thought provoking and doesn't mind pushing buttons or boundaries to achieve this end.  Although I agree with another reviewer's (Dexter Tay) assessment that this film certainly pertains to Sartre's ""Hell is the Other"" view, I do not believe this film is more arthouse porn then art.  I find it very interesting that the reviews are fairly divided between the sexes.  Females seem to rave about this movie and males seem to find things wrong.  Hmmmm.This film is basically two characters, one female and one male (names aren't used because they don't matter - they are ourselves) who are complete strangers and come together to discuss the real view they have of the ""Other"" as well as themselves.  The setting is very bare as there is no need for props - it is the inter-relationship that is front and center and no diversions are allowed.  So even though there are several graphic scenes, be prepared for much more dialogue and philosophical discussions between man and woman then actual sexual content.  Two scenes stand out from all others: (1) when the women opines on the ridiculousness of the sanitary outer covering of a tampon to prevent intimacy.  The very act by its nature is intimate.  Why are men and women horrified by menstruation?  This topic is delved into with such honesty that the viewer automatically shies away; and (2) when the man complains to another about the way the woman let him debase her and with every humiliation, asked for more.

A woman pays a man, who is gay, to watch her for four nights during her most intimate moments. The movie then progresses through each of those four nights and the exploration that occurs between man and woman through sex and gender. Both the man and the woman attempt to explore the female gender, as well the social, sexual and intimate implications that the male and female genders have imposed upon it. What develops is a strange intimacy between the two which frees the characters to explore female sexuality.What little dialogue there is becomes a vocalization of the fears men have about women and the &#34;hell&#34; women's bodies represent. The dialogue was honest and thought provoking, much like a philosophical interpretation of the meaning of the female gender. The theoretical principles explores taboos not only through the dialogue but through a series of images that may be shocking for most people.Breillat, the director holds little back and delves into the exploration of the woman's body as it embodies temptation, desire, curiosity, sin and &#34;hell&#34;.

869110,A1HK1LRON0UJ5X,B0006IIPYE,William McNeill,"[3, 3]","Catherine's Breillat's Anatomy of Hell opens with title cards telling us that 1) it is a work of fiction and 2) the lead actress had a body double. The action then shifts to a gay dance club where a brunette cipher and a homosexual misogynist meet via an implausible series of violent and sexual acts that that might have seemed transgressive before the era of 24/7 internet porn. They strike a bargain: she will pay him to come to a desolate beach house where he will watch her when she is ""unwatchable"". What this means is that they will both lie around her shabby-chic bedroom reciting passages from Breillat's 2001 bookPornocratie. If you're going to film an essay, you'd better have something interesting to say, and unfortunately Breillat's script consists of a series of alternately tedious and risible clich&eacute;s about the chthonic power of women's genitalia and men's all-consuming terror of the same. The movie ambles along like this for an hour or so and then ends. It is almost a brilliant parody of a French art film.Breillat is a provocateur. Her reputation rests on her films' unblinking depiction of women who willingly submit themselves to sexual humiliation, and the fact that she is herself a woman, which insulates her oeuvre against a knee-jerk charge of misogyny (cf. Lars von Trier) while securing it a reputation as some sort of feminist document, because what else could she be up to? When the provocation works, her movies get under your skin: Breillat's 2001 coming of age dramaFat Girlis nothing if not shocking. But when it doesn't their failure is jejune and embarrassing. Anatomy of Hell falls into the latter camp. There is copious nudity, explicit sex, gynecological close-ups, unsimulated vaginal insertion of various items, and a bit of splashing about in menstrual blood. Some of it is gross, but none of it will be the least bit shocking to any person in possession of a vagina, or any man who has been in an intimate relationship with a woman. Gay men are perhaps a little less acquainted with the whole business, though they would be more typically inclined to respond with a shrug, unlike the male protagonist who ends the movie inexplicably reduced to tears.The only part of Anatomy of Hell that lingers is that initial disclaimer about the body double, which is presented in flowery elliptical language that seems to be delicately avoiding saying something, though it's not clear what. Regardless, its upshot is that the vulva and face we see on screen do not belong to the same real-life person. Maybe Breillat included this at the insistence of her actress Amira Casar, and the vagueness comes from her annoyance at having had to compromise on this bit of prudery. If not, what was the point? If we are supposed to empathize with a leading lady's willingness to endure indignities for the sake of art, shouldn't we have the exact same empathy for a body double who is only photographed from the waist down?

The last movie that is similar to this film that I had seen was Irreversible(Monica Belluci), which was more engrossing and distasteful than Anatomy of Hell. In this conversational erotic film, the two leads explore many issues revolving body parts, sexual desires and politics. Don't expect the sex and nudity to be stimulating, because it's rather shocking and the sexual activities are hardcore, not simulated.It's quite a surprise to see that Rocco Siffredi(legendary straight porn star) could pull of Frenching kissing a guy in a gay bar in the opening scene. He was cruised by Amira Casar and when he saw her cutting her wrist in the bathroom, he took her to the doctor. Then they went for a walk together, and later she orally served him on the street. She persuaded him to go home with her and would pay him a big chunk of cash if he would stay and watch her where she's unwatchable. He was curious and agreed with the deal.In the following four days, they talk about sex and she allowed him to ""scrutinize"" her body while she was sleeping. He reluctantly indulged himself to play around with her body parts. She gets penetrated by him with fingers and his (...) and the handle of a gardening tool.....She seemed to enjoy the domination and humilation on him. He breaks down into massive tears after having the first sexual act, because he was so revolted. More shockingly of all, is the scene when he made out with her while she was having her period. It was visually disturbing to watch his blood soaked (...) and his reaction to what he had done. Even more shocking was when she puts her blood-soaked tampon into a glass of water, and they both drank half of it!What really bothered me was the unsafe sexual intercourse and the drinking of the ""period water"".
