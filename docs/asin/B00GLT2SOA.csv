1678684,A23MBD9OAUQ6OK,B00GLT2SOA,"H. F. Wiegand ""dream writer""","[3, 3]","Mama's Family Season Three is hilarious and highly engaging. In a nod to continuity, Rue McClanahan's character of Aunt Fran is put to rest in the opening episode, which also brings a new character into the family--Bubba Higgins, offspring of Carol Burnett's Eunice character and Harvey Korman's Ed. Bubba is a somewhat reformed juvenile delinquent with a juvenile hall record. A very special relationship develops between Bubba and his Grandma--Thelma Harper, still played to perfection by Vicki Lawrence. Even though Bubba has his problems with Grandma, they both manage to work it out--unlike with Eunice.  Maybe Mama sees in Bubba a chance to establish a firmer foundation than she had with either of her daughters. Speaking of the other daughter, Betty White reprises her role as Ellen one last time. While it's sad to see the departure of comedy greats White, McClanahan, and Burnett from this season (Rue and Carol do not appear at all), the series manages to continue delivering laughs with Mama's son Vint (Ken Berry), daughter-in-law Naomi (Dorothy Lyman), and another new-to-this-season character, Mama's neighbor Iola (Beverly Archer), in addition to the aforementioned Bubba, who is played by Allan Kayser. Highlights include Ellen's series swan song &#34;Best Medicine,&#34; and also some of my favorites, &#34;The Love Letter,&#34; &#34;Steal One, Pearl Two&#34;, and &#34;Buck Private Bubba.&#34; There is a hilarious Thanksgiving episode and a less funny but still enjoyable Christmas episode. The character of Mama softens as this season progresses, but that is necessary for the longevity of any series--crotchetiness only goes so far before audiences want to see more genuine humanity. Mama's transformation is painful yet plausible, as she progresses through many stages of reconcilation with her family members and tries her best to be understanding, often with very humorous results. Vicki Lawrence and the writers did not tone down the character all at once--they did it believably by degrees.One plot point is never cleared up--in Seasons One and Two, Vint's daughter Sonia occupied the spare bedroom upstairs, while his son Buzz slept in the attic. Aunt Fran was livid about losing her planned office space by having to give over the room to Sonia. So now in Season Three, when Aunt Fran is deceased and Sonia and Buzz have gone away to school, there should be TWO extra bedrooms upstairs (plus the attic room)--plenty of room for Bubba to have a room of his own, and Vint and Naomi to move upstairs and out of the basement as well.  Yet in Episode One of this season, Naomi is at first upset when Bubba gets Aunt Fran's old room because it means that she and Vint have to continue to live in the basement. But what happened to Sonia's old room?There are many extras on this DVD set, including a Carol Burnett sketch that focuses on Eunice and Ed's son Bubba when he was in school, even though Bubba is not seen in the sketch. Maggie Smith is first-rate as Bubba's long-suffering teacher. There is also an interview with Allan Kayser regarding his role in the series. Interestingly, he reveals that in preparation for the part he studied Carol's performances as Eunice so that he could do a convincing job of playing her son. (Too bad they never got to appear together in an episode.)Long-time fans of the Mama character may feel a little let down, as this season is less acrimonious than Seasons One and Two, and there seem to be fewer guest stars this time around. It's a tamer version of Mama's Family than before, but it makes up for this with greater depth of character and still a healthy portion of belly laughs.",5,There's Life in the Old Girl Yet,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,3645,"['Mama', 'Family', 'Season', 'Three', 'hilarious', 'highly', 'engaging', 'nod', 'continuity', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'character', 'Aunt', 'Fran', 'put', 'rest', 'opening', 'episode', 'also', 'new', 'character', 'family', 'Bubba', 'Higgins', 'offspring', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Eunice', 'character', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'Ed', 'Bubba', 'somewhat', 'reformed', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'juvenile', 'hall', 'record', 'very', 'special', 'relationship', 'Bubba', 'Grandma', 'Thelma', 'Harper', 'still', 'played', 'perfection', 'Vicki', 'Lawrence', 'Even', 'Bubba', 'problems', 'Grandma', 'manage', 'work', 'out', 'Eunice', 'Maybe', 'Mama', 'Bubba', 'chance', 'establish', 'firmer', 'foundation', 'had', 'daughters', 'Speaking', 'other', 'daughter', 'Betty', 'White', 'role', 'Ellen', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'sad', 'see', 'departure', 'comedy', 'greats', 'White', 'McClanahan', 'Burnett', 'season', 'Rue', 'Carol', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'series', 'continue', 'delivering', 'laughs', 'Mama', 'son', 'Vint', 'Ken', 'Berry', 'daughter-in-law', 'Naomi', 'Dorothy', 'Lyman', 'new-to-this-season', 'character', 'Mama', 'neighbor', 'Iola', 'Beverly', 'Archer', 'addition', 'aforementioned', 'Bubba', 'who', 'played', 'Allan', 'Kayser', 'Highlights', 'include', 'Ellen', 'series', 'swan', 'song', '34', 'Best', 'Medicine', '34', 'also', 'favorites', '34', 'Love', 'Letter', '34', '34', 'Steal', 'One', 'Pearl', 'Two', '34', '34', 'Buck', 'Private', 'Bubba.', '34', 'hilarious', 'Thanksgiving', 'episode', 'less', 'funny', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'character', 'Mama', 'season', 'necessary', 'longevity', 'series', 'crotchetiness', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'audiences', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'genuine', 'humanity', 'Mama', 'transformation', 'painful', 'yet', 'plausible', 'many', 'stages', 'reconcilation', 'family', 'members', 'best', 'be', 'understanding', 'often', 'very', 'humorous', 'results', 'Vicki', 'Lawrence', 'writers', 'did', 'not', 'tone', 'down', 'character', 'once', 'did', 'believably', 'degrees.One', 'plot', 'point', 'never', 'cleared', 'up', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'Vint', 'daughter', 'Sonia', 'occupied', 'spare', 'bedroom', 'upstairs', 'son', 'Buzz', 'slept', 'attic', 'Aunt', 'Fran', 'was', 'livid', 'losing', 'planned', 'office', 'space', 'having', 'give', 'over', 'room', 'Sonia', 'So', 'now', 'Season', 'Three', 'when', 'Aunt', 'Fran', 'deceased', 'Sonia', 'Buzz', 'have', 'gone', 'away', 'school', 'should', 'be', 'TWO', 'extra', 'bedrooms', 'upstairs', 'attic', 'room', 'plenty', 'room', 'Bubba', 'have', 'room', 'own', 'Vint', 'Naomi', 'move', 'upstairs', 'basement', 'as', 'well', 'Episode', 'One', 'season', 'Naomi', 'first', 'upset', 'when', 'Bubba', 'Aunt', 'Fran', 'old', 'room', 'Vint', 'have', 'continue', 'live', 'basement', 'what', 'happened', 'Sonia', 'old', 'room', 'are', 'many', 'extras', 'DVD', 'set', 'including', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'sketch', 'Eunice', 'Ed', 'son', 'Bubba', 'when', 'was', 'school', 'even', 'Bubba', 'not', 'seen', 'sketch', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'first-rate', 'Bubba', 'long-suffering', 'teacher', 'also', 'interview', 'Allan', 'Kayser', 'regarding', 'role', 'series', 'Interestingly', 'preparation', 'part', 'studied', 'Carol', 'performances', 'Eunice', 'could', 'do', 'convincing', 'job', 'playing', 'son', 'Too', 'bad', 'never', 'got', 'appear', 'together', 'episode', 'Long-time', 'fans', 'Mama', 'character', 'may', 'feel', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'season', 'less', 'acrimonious', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'fewer', 'guest', 'stars', 'time', 'around', 'tamer', 'version', 'Mama', 'Family', 'before', 'up', 'greater', 'depth', 'character', 'still', 'healthy', 'portion', 'belly', 'laughs']",Mama's Family: Season 3
1678685,A37ICVM4HSJJFN,B00GLT2SOA,"Infiltrator ""J.A.""","[11, 14]","Sure, the first two seasons introduced us to what what was going to be an even bigger show in syndication, but the difference is evident after the format switched (and the grandkids left).  At some point a show can have TOO MUCH starpower, and that's exactly what happened in the first two seasons.  Carol Burnett was already a comedian, as was Betty White, and even Rue McLanahan to a certain extent.  When all these characters left, it was up to the writers and producers to come up with clever sub-plots and they certainly pulled it off!  Turning Vinton into a dimwitted husband, instead of the leader, was a great way to set up storylines for his relationship with Naomi.  Iola, was a very interesting neighbor, and she added her own personality to the Harper household.  Bubba was also a needed addition, because contrary to the boring and monotonous grandkids, he was a more realistic teenager.  This show definitely took off in season 3, and continued to it's final episode (in in 1990).

They fleshed out Raytown and its residents to fit with the Harpers, making it the southern town where it was supposed to take place! Bringing in Bubba and Iola made the series richer and much more truthful - much more realistic than Buzz and Sonja of the previous seasons. Even the set was brighter and warmer!The amazing extras on this set are all about Bubba! It starts with a classic Family sketch from The Carol Burnett Show featuring Maggie Smith as Bubba's teacher discussing his behaviour. Then there's the Mama's Family Tree: The Sprouts (all about Bubba) montage and interview clips, and finally an interview with Allan Kayser. The one extra not ""all about Bubba"" is the 25 minute cast reunion: superb!
