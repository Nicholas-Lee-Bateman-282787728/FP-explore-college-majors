1166596,AB0GGIQBNB36Q,B001APM412,Ben Milton,"[0, 0]","When I first saw the title, I thought that it would be another bad made for T.V. movie, buuuuut. It isn't,  Spoiler alert, The HMS Scorpion was lost at sea in 1943, in the Baltic sea. But in 1981 she resurfaces, with no crew on board. Now British command wants to retrace the scorpion's mission step by step, to find out what happened to her. With one little surprise, there was one survivor of the scorpion. And he comes along for the ride, since he can't remember anything about his final moments aboard. Now what I like about this movie, is you get to see commander Tyler literally go crazy. But they nicely throw in the ghost aspect of the sub and crew, when the scorpion went through the Triangle, the ship remained in 1943. But it's 1981 outside the sub, even the modern day crew, start becoming the original crew, one thing that is done very well is that because the sub is pretty much alive. She starts reliving the mission literally, everything exactly as it happened. When they destroy an enemy sub, it happens exactly when and where it happened in 1943. Some have complained that we don't see enough of the ghosts, but that's what makes this movie better. We get just enough, to make us wanting more. Even when Jack Hardy, the surviving crew member starts having flashbacks. And hearing voices, What makes the movie work, is he's the only one who doesn't slip into 1943. Unlike the rest of the crew, even the ghost of the original captain is dominant in this movie. He makes a brief appearance at the end, all in all. A great movie, that's surprising, Don't let the title fool you.",5,Surprisingly very very good,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,1592,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'title', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'made', 'T.V', 'movie', 'buuuuut', ""n't"", 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'HMS', 'Scorpion', 'was', 'lost', 'sea', '1943', 'Baltic', 'sea', '1981', 'crew', 'board', 'Now', 'British', 'command', 'retrace', 'scorpion', 'mission', 'step', 'step', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'one', 'little', 'surprise', 'was', 'one', 'survivor', 'scorpion', 'along', 'ride', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'final', 'moments', 'Now', 'what', 'like', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'commander', 'Tyler', 'literally', 'go', 'crazy', 'nicely', 'throw', 'ghost', 'aspect', 'sub', 'crew', 'when', 'scorpion', 'went', 'Triangle', 'ship', 'remained', '1943', '1981', 'sub', 'even', 'modern', 'day', 'crew', 'start', 'becoming', 'original', 'crew', 'one', 'thing', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'sub', 'pretty', 'much', 'alive', 'reliving', 'mission', 'literally', 'everything', 'exactly', 'happened', 'When', 'destroy', 'enemy', 'sub', 'exactly', 'when', 'where', 'happened', '1943', 'have', 'complained', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'ghosts', 'what', 'movie', 'better', 'get', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'wanting', 'more', 'Even', 'when', 'Jack', 'Hardy', 'surviving', 'crew', 'member', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'hearing', 'voices', 'What', 'movie', 'work', 'only', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'slip', '1943', 'rest', 'crew', 'even', 'ghost', 'original', 'captain', 'dominant', 'movie', 'brief', 'appearance', 'end', 'A', 'great', 'movie', 'surprising', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'title', 'fool']",Ghost Boat

I found it very suspenseful and watched both episodes at once.  I have always liked submarine movies about WWII, and the history of earlier boats.  If you have never seen DAS BOAT, you really should see that movie also.  It has got to be THE most realistic submarine movie ever made!
