He especially loves Dora & Diego, however, the Dora & Diego shows on this video are on other Christmas videos; in fact, I already own those videos & did not realize that when I got this. They could have added some new Dora & Diego Christmas episodes, the ones on here are a few years old. It's nice that this does have some of the new Nick shows such as Ni Hao Kai-lan & Umi Zoomi, which my son also loves. It would have been nice to have the Backyardigans on here as well.But all in all, it is a very good video of Christmas episodes, and my son loves it!

1455756,A24GQJSGZ4XOWL,B005DKS1SU,Sandra,"[0, 0]","This was a Christmas gift for my 3 year old grandaughter. She loves these T.V. shows & she learns a lot from them (she can count up to 10, knows all of her shapes & colors,  knows the letters of the alphabet, can understand & speak some -a fairly good amount of- Spanish, her vocabulary is way above the level of a 3 year old, and she can read some words in books).  She amazes a lot of people & they always ask where she learns these things. We feel she enjoys herself learning from her ""friends"" on T.V. She also has their books.  I have a DVD player in my car & I have a selection of these shows on separate DVDs which she loves. Now she can see them all on 1 DVD (we use the DVD player in town & it's not always convenient to change a DVD when driving). This DVD will be especially good for the long trips we take (over 2 hours). Anyone with little ones will know how much education kids can absorb while watching something they enjoy!
