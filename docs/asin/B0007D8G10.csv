880320,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0007D8G10,Brian E. Erland,"[15, 16]","Released in '02 `I Am Dina' is a beautifully filmed Brontesque styled film that is so out of the norm it appears to have created a genre unique unto itself. The constant juxtaposition of the idyllic rural lifestyle of 19th century Northern Norway and the magnificent Norwegian vistas worthy of a National Geographic travelogue are indeed a striking contrast to the dark, supernaturally tinted, psycho-sexual drama that slowly unfolds before its stunned and unprepared audience. Accompanied by a superbly crafted script and superior performances all-around one is left to wonder why such a film has lanquished in obscurity for the past five years.Maria Bonnevie delivers a haunting and unnerving performance in the role of Dina. Her tormented, otherworldly countenance is both frightening and beautiful and the camera makes good use of her features with continual close-ups of her expressive face. If there were ever a pair of eyes that could gase into a mans soul these are the ones. Other personal favorites in the film are; Soren Saetter-Lassen as Lorch, Mads Mikkelsen as Niels, Christopher Eccleston as Leo and of course the legendary Gerard Depardieu as Jacob.If you're in the mood for something light and romantic watch something else, however if you're looking for something somber and brooding look no further.My Rating: -4  Stars-.",4,"""Look At Me"" ~ Fjords, Fatalities And The Dark Feminine",1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,1340,"['Released', ""'02"", 'Am', 'Dina', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'Brontesque', 'styled', 'film', 'so', 'norm', 'have', 'created', 'genre', 'unique', 'constant', 'juxtaposition', 'idyllic', 'rural', 'lifestyle', '19th', 'century', 'Northern', 'Norway', 'magnificent', 'Norwegian', 'vistas', 'worthy', 'National', 'Geographic', 'travelogue', 'are', 'indeed', 'striking', 'contrast', 'dark', 'supernaturally', 'tinted', 'psycho-sexual', 'drama', 'slowly', 'stunned', 'unprepared', 'audience', 'Accompanied', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'script', 'superior', 'performances', 'all-around', 'one', 'left', 'wonder', 'why', 'such', 'film', 'lanquished', 'obscurity', 'past', 'five', 'years.Maria', 'Bonnevie', 'haunting', 'unnerving', 'performance', 'role', 'Dina', 'Her', 'tormented', 'otherworldly', 'countenance', 'frightening', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'good', 'use', 'features', 'continual', 'close-ups', 'expressive', 'face', 'were', 'ever', 'pair', 'eyes', 'could', 'gase', 'mans', 'soul', 'are', 'ones', 'Other', 'personal', 'favorites', 'film', 'are', 'Soren', 'Saetter-Lassen', 'Lorch', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Niels', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Leo', 'course', 'legendary', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'Jacob.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'something', 'light', 'romantic', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'however', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'somber', 'brooding', 'look', 'further.My', 'Rating', '-4', 'Stars-']",N/A

880323,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0007D8G10,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","Just finished this and I barely know what to think. At some level I was confused but, at the same time, totally absorbed in its passion.Here's the scoop. At a young age, Dina accidentally causes the death of her mother. Her father banishes her from the house and she is left alone in someone's attic, for some while, to suffer, alone, the horror of what has happened. She is gradually brought back into the house and tutored by a musician. He teaches her music, how to read, and tries to steer her into some degree of emotional normalcy. Her father wants little to do with her and she matures into a very interesting, wild and haunted individual.Though there is somewhat of a story and character arc here, it is mostly episodic. You see Dina in various episodes throughout her life which explore her person. She has a constant wide (wild)- eyed look. She doesn't blink much. She's tough both emotionally and physically. She never wears shoes, not even in the winter. And that's saying something because this is set in a rural Norwegian town in the 19th century. She's an accomplished cellist and appears not only to be quite bright but cunning as well. She can pick up on the smallest clues to see what's happening around her. But she's haunted by her mother's death and this effects everything she does. Death always seems close at hand and her relationships with people in general, and men in particular, are wildly unpredictable.This might be where I had a problem. I'm not certain what the writer/ director was trying to say. Yup. She's big time screwed up. But, even with her death obsession, she seems to be more alive than those around her. It's just I felt so little procession in the film. It seemed to be a bunch of set pieces strung together. Maybe I need to see it again to get the whole of it.This film has a great look to it. The sense of period is played well. The cast is good. Maria Bonnevie is great as Dina. Gerard Depardieu, Chris Eccelston and Madds Mikkelson all do fine jobs. There is great passion in every frame of this movie. I liked it a lot and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys foreign films.

880324,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B0007D8G10,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[5, 7]","Based on the novel by Herbjrg Wassmoole, Ole Bornedal directed the drama I Am Dina. In Northern Norway during the 1860s, a little girl named Dina accidentally causes her mother's death. Overcome with grief, her father (Bjrn Floberg) refuses to raise her, leaving her in the care of the household servants. Dina grows up wild and unmanageable, with her only friend being the stable boy, Tomas (Hans Matheson)and finding in the cello her only silent partner. She summons her mother's ghost and develops a strange fascination with death as well as a fervent passion for living, as well as an indomitable character.Family friend Jacob (G&eacute;rard Depardieu) encourages Dina's father to hire Lorch (Sren Stter-Lassen), a tutor who introduces her to the cello. When Dina is old enough (played by Maria Bonnevie), she marries Jacob and moves to Reinsnes, a port he runs with his mother, Karen (Wenche Foss), and his stepsons Niels (Mads Mikkelsen) and Anders (Jrgen Langhelle). Niels doesn't like Dina's wild ways, or the fact that she has taken over accounting duties at Reinsnes. Dina's eccentric tendencies become even stronger, eventually leading Jacob into an accident of his own and bringing Tomas back into her life.Potent and remarkable film, that deserves from you special attention due the marvelous script, stunning artistic direction and towering performances of all the cast. One may feel the undeniable visual narrative of Ingmar Bergman.

880330,A3IB6BLXU304PF,B0007D8G10,Zenful,"[11, 12]","This is a haunting and engaging story about a young girl banished to a life of self torment, an only child denied the love of her father when she accidentally causes the death of her mother.  The first moments of this film are riveting, soft and serene and then quickly blood curdling, as we see the young girl playing whimsically in the 1800s in mountainous Norway, only to accidentally drown her mother in a giant vat of boiling lye on the family's estate.  This all happens in the first few moments of this film- it is explosive and mesmerizing, visually spectacular, highly disturbing and set against a soundtrack of enchanting music.The tale follows the story of Dina, the tragedy that befalls her as a child and the life of disappointment and abandonment she subsequently is doomed to follow, a life spent yearning for the love of her father and discarding all other men as playtoys.  We see Dina as a young girl, and then as a young woman.  She scorns her femininity in much the same way she has been scorned for causing her mother's death and her life is one of betrayal, revenge, abandonment, and adultery.  This is a film not of possibility but of mind numbing reality, the confused reality of a woman damaged to the core and her need to find a permanent love that will honor and obey, and validate her.It is beautifully filmed and cleverly edited to create a visual journey as poignant and lingering as the sad and disturbing plight of Dina.
