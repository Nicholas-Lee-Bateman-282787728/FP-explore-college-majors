Four of the Wiggles' friends, Dorothy, Henry, Wags and Captain Feathersword are in this one, too...even Fernando and his son, Little Fernando.I loved all of the new songs from the DVD movie including a favorite sene when the Wiggles rode donkies on their Wiggly Trail and how they help Fernando win the Country Cook-Off with Foodman's help.  The two Fernandos first appeared in (Hoop Dee Do It's A Wiggly Party).",5,IT'S SURE FUN RIDING THE WIGGLY TRAIL!!!,1082073600,"04 16, 2004",2004,497,"['time', 'Wiggles', 'are', 'cowboys', 'new', 'movie', 'Cold', 'Spagetti', 'Western', 'Four', 'Wiggles', 'friends', 'Dorothy', 'Henry', 'Wags', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'are', 'one', 'too', 'even', 'Fernando', 'son', 'Little', 'Fernando.I', 'loved', 'new', 'songs', 'DVD', 'movie', 'including', 'favorite', 'sene', 'when', 'Wiggles', 'rode', 'donkies', 'Wiggly', 'Trail', 'how', 'help', 'Fernando', 'win', 'Country', 'Cook-Off', 'Foodman', 'help', 'two', 'Fernandos', 'first', 'appeared', 'Hoop', 'Dee', 'Do', 'A', 'Wiggly', 'Party']",N/A

Now, on this one, I definitely suggest getting the DVD because they have awesome footage of the Wiggles touring Japan and China.  When your kids get older and seemingly outgrow the Wiggles, this footage will definitely be helpful and educational still.  I truly appreciated seeing the Great Wall of China and knowing that they did concerts for our servicemen there for $1 a ticket.  That's pretty awesome!Regarding the Cold Spaghetti movie itself, I think it's better for older kids because they'll be able to follow the storyline a bit better than young toddlers.  It's not a typical Wiggles video but it's a movie and is designed as such.  It has some great songs a few stinkers (""Chasing the Birdie""), but all-in-all, it's worth the money.  ""Masta Pasta Maker"" and ""We're the Cowboys"" are great songs and you'll find yourself singing them all day long.  My little guy decided to boot scoot the rest of the day!  He really liked the western theme.  It drags a little so you'll have trouble keeping the little ones interested which is why I suggested this one for the older ones.To me, it seems that the Wiggles are trying new things to keep it fresh which I find to be very refreshing and pertinent for kids.  I think folks need to be a little more understanding on why the Wiggly dancers are there - Greg is the youngest at 31, Jeff is 50, Murray is 42 and Anthony is 40, almost 41.  There's only so much they can do for long periods of time because of the age situation so keep that in mind.  I don't care for the Wiggly dancers myself either - the outfits are very distracting and hokey so I wish they'd do something about that part.  But, they'll have to do something - Jeff won't be able to rollerskate like he did on Wiggly Safari forever!  It's just too hard to do as many shows as they do on tour and to keep up with all those dances.  If you've ever seen them live, you know how hard they work on that stage so somewhere, something will have to slow down eventually, unfortunately!  If you've ever been in the music biz like I have, you'd understand what goes on to get these videos to market.  Also, check out their touring schedule on their internet site to see just how horrifically busy they are.  Worst schedule I've ever seen and how they do it, I have no idea.  How they manage to write new songs, do these videos, tour incessantly and still see their families is just a miracle to me. So, cut them some slack - they're one of the few groups out there that really do care about what kids are watching and learning and willing to give what they've got to help your kids get the start that they need.  I don't have to screen their videos before we watch them which is very refreshing to me.  I can't say that for other children's videos.Buy the DVD - you'll enjoy it!",4,Not as bad as others have suggested...,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,2872,"['Okay', 'are', 'true', 'Wigglers', 'house', 'own', 'just', 'videos', 'DVDs', 'Now', 'one', 'definitely', 'suggest', 'getting', 'DVD', 'have', 'awesome', 'footage', 'Wiggles', 'touring', 'Japan', 'China', 'When', 'kids', 'get', 'older', 'seemingly', 'outgrow', 'Wiggles', 'footage', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'helpful', 'educational', 'still', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'Great', 'Wall', 'China', 'knowing', 'did', 'concerts', 'servicemen', '1', 'ticket', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'Regarding', 'Cold', 'Spaghetti', 'movie', 'think', 'better', 'older', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'storyline', 'bit', 'better', 'young', 'toddlers', 'not', 'typical', 'Wiggles', 'video', 'movie', 'designed', 'such', 'great', 'songs', 'few', 'stinkers', 'Chasing', 'Birdie', 'all-in-all', 'money', 'Masta', 'Pasta', 'Maker', ""'re"", 'Cowboys', 'are', 'great', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'find', 'singing', 'day', 'long', 'little', 'guy', 'decided', 'boot', 'rest', 'day', 'really', 'liked', 'western', 'theme', 'little', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'little', 'ones', 'interested', 'why', 'suggested', 'one', 'older', 'Wiggles', 'are', 'trying', 'new', 'things', 'keep', 'fresh', 'find', 'be', 'very', 'refreshing', 'pertinent', 'kids', 'think', 'folks', 'need', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'understanding', 'why', 'Wiggly', 'dancers', 'are', 'there', 'Greg', 'youngest', '31', 'Jeff', '50', 'Murray', '42', 'Anthony', '40', 'almost', '41', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'age', 'situation', 'so', 'keep', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Wiggly', 'outfits', 'are', 'very', 'distracting', 'hokey', 'so', 'wish', ""'d"", 'do', 'something', 'part', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'something', 'Jeff', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'rollerskate', 'did', 'Wiggly', 'Safari', 'forever', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'do', 'many', 'shows', 'do', 'tour', 'keep', 'up', 'dances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'live', 'know', 'how', 'hard', 'work', 'stage', 'so', 'somewhere', 'something', 'will', 'have', 'slow', 'down', 'eventually', 'unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'music', 'biz', 'have', ""'d"", 'understand', 'what', 'get', 'videos', 'market', 'Also', 'check', 'out', 'touring', 'schedule', 'internet', 'site', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'horrifically', 'busy', 'are', 'Worst', 'schedule', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'how', 'do', 'have', 'idea', 'How', 'manage', 'write', 'new', 'songs', 'do', 'videos', 'tour', 'incessantly', 'still', 'see', 'families', 'just', 'miracle', 'So', 'cut', 'slack', ""'re"", 'one', 'few', 'groups', 'there', 'really', 'do', 'care', 'what', 'kids', 'are', 'watching', 'learning', 'willing', 'give', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'help', 'kids', 'get', 'start', 'need', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'screen', 'videos', 'watch', 'very', 'refreshing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'other', 'children', 'videos.Buy', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'enjoy']",N/A

778196,A3QQO9GVE0GOFE,B0000DD54C,Louis Rios,"[6, 8]","The early Wiggles videos were simple: basic production values, and no storyline -- just a collection of songs performed one after another, sometimes accompanied by some cute child dancers. It seemed to be a great fit for toddlers and preschoolers, and the songs were catchy, silly and clever enough to earn their parents' approval too.Since then the Wiggles have gradually moved away from that formula. Their songs, while not quite as simple and not quite as silly, are still pretty good -- catchy, clever and well-performed. The cute dancing kids were replaced by not-so-cute dancing adults, disappointing some fans. And in this video especially, they've added a storyline.  But the storyline is unusual, to put it mildly. They seem to be going for zany comedy a la The Monkees, but they just don't connect. Neither preschoolers nor adults will laugh at this stuff. And with their typical low-budget production (a Western without horses?), most adults will end up feeling a little cheated. I'll still give them a few stars for decent songs -- I'd listen to this over Barney any day -- but I wish it was better.",3,Wiggles aim a little higher but don't quite hit the mark,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,1111,"['early', 'Wiggles', 'videos', 'were', 'simple', 'basic', 'production', 'values', 'storyline', 'just', 'collection', 'songs', 'performed', 'one', 'sometimes', 'accompanied', 'cute', 'child', 'dancers', 'seemed', 'be', 'great', 'fit', 'toddlers', 'preschoolers', 'songs', 'were', 'catchy', 'silly', 'clever', 'enough', 'earn', 'parents', 'approval', 'too.Since', 'then', 'Wiggles', 'have', 'gradually', 'moved', 'away', 'formula', 'songs', 'not', 'quite', 'simple', 'not', 'quite', 'silly', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'catchy', 'clever', 'well-performed', 'cute', 'dancing', 'kids', 'were', 'replaced', 'not-so-cute', 'dancing', 'adults', 'disappointing', 'fans', 'video', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'added', 'storyline', 'storyline', 'unusual', 'put', 'mildly', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'zany', 'comedy', 'la', 'Monkees', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'preschoolers', 'adults', 'will', 'laugh', 'stuff', 'typical', 'low-budget', 'production', 'Western', 'horses', 'most', 'adults', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'little', 'cheated', ""'ll"", 'still', 'give', 'few', 'stars', 'decent', 'songs', ""'d"", 'listen', 'Barney', 'day', 'wish', 'was', 'better']",N/A
