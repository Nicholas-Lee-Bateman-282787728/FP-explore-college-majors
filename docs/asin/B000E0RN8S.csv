It was the story of a band, however there was also a mystery regarding Eddie disappearance. It was a small film that ran in theaters and vanished without a trace. It was an art house film that was done well, but when it was released in the movie theaters got NO audienceThe reason this film got a sequel was due to pay cable. This movie built up a cult following when in was on cable movie TV (HBO,SHOWTIME,etc). Most wanted the answers the first film left unresolved questions. You must understand, this is before cable had shows like Dexter, Six feet Under, The Tutors and others (including a MOB show which is NOT my favorite)The sequel which was not as good as the first (there are never many where the sequel is better than the original). However it did rap up the storylines left unfinished by the first filmThese two films are a cult classic. The talented Micheal Pare stars in both films as Eddie Wilson. He showcases the mind of a man who loves the music...its sounds, its feeling. He is brash in the film film. By the sequel, he is wiser, smarter and older. The second he is haunted by the demons of the pastIf you are seeking great filmmaking, dont get this. BUT if you seek a story which will interest you, this double feature is a sure bet for an evening entertainment. and that in my book is worth five starsBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",5,EDDIE!!!!!,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,1423,"['Film', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', 'was', 'throw', 'back', 'bands', 'fifties', 'was', 'story', 'band', 'however', 'was', 'also', 'mystery', 'regarding', 'Eddie', 'disappearance', 'was', 'small', 'film', 'ran', 'theaters', 'vanished', 'trace', 'was', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'movie', 'theaters', 'got', 'NO', 'audienceThe', 'reason', 'film', 'got', 'sequel', 'was', 'due', 'pay', 'cable', 'movie', 'built', 'up', 'cult', 'following', 'when', 'was', 'cable', 'movie', 'TV', 'HBO', 'SHOWTIME', 'etc', 'Most', 'wanted', 'answers', 'first', 'film', 'left', 'unresolved', 'questions', 'must', 'understand', 'cable', 'had', 'shows', 'Dexter', 'Six', 'feet', 'Tutors', 'others', 'including', 'MOB', 'show', 'NOT', 'favorite', 'sequel', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'are', 'never', 'many', 'where', 'sequel', 'better', 'original', 'However', 'did', 'rap', 'up', 'storylines', 'left', 'unfinished', 'first', 'filmThese', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'cult', 'classic', 'talented', 'Micheal', 'Pare', 'films', 'Eddie', 'Wilson', 'mind', 'man', 'who', 'music', 'sounds', 'feeling', 'brash', 'film', 'film', 'sequel', 'wiser', 'smarter', 'older', 'second', 'haunted', 'demons', 'pastIf', 'are', 'seeking', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'dont', 'get', 'BUT', 'seek', 'story', 'will', 'interest', 'double', 'feature', 'sure', 'bet', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'book', 'worth', 'five', 'starsBennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",Eddie and the Cruisers - Eddie and the Cruisers 2 - Eddie Lives!

In her search for Eddie she interviews the other members of his band. Each member in turn visualizes what it was like when Eddie was alive. We go along for the ride in a series of flashbacks.Not part of the original music but fun to hear again is ""Runaway"" by Del Shannon.The story is fun to watch as it unfolds. It will only work for you if you like the particular music as that is just as much a character of the movie as the people.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!I am going to assume that you watched the first movie ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" (1983).  However the sequel movie stands on its own.Being a sequel this is not as simple as just a new movie.  People will come to it for different reasons.  Some like the music of Beaver Brown.  Some like the actors.  Whatever your reason you will not be disappointed.In the early 60s Eddie Wilson (Michael Par&eacute;) had one the most popular bands.  At the height of his dream of making perfect music Eddie Wilson's car is found in the river; however his body was never found.Flash-forward 20 years. The record company promotes the thought that Eddie might still be alive and plays a lot of his old recordings.  This in a new girlfriend encourages him to try one more time at perfecting his music.  We go long to follow his trials and tribulations.  Will he succeed?

Movies shot on location always fare better with the ""feeling"" of place. To some people this movie's storyline may feel cliched but the acting emotes a certain quality that connects with your soul. The songs are very strong. I was a DJ in a bar when this movie was first out and ""On the Dark Side"" and ""Tender Years"" were always favorites. They also capture the vulnerability of youth that the movie is depicting. Besides the outstanding songs, the thing that makes this movie for me is how Michael Pare completely captures the heart & soul of the songs by John Cafferty while lip-syncing them. Incredible.Eddie Lives! does a great job to once again show the drive of Eddie Wilson to make the band the best they can be. Michael Pare is outstanding in this movie. He really captures the essence of his character as being desperate, sad, and vulnerable all at the same time. Once the movie is over I really wished that Eddie Wilson was real.

(1988)(Totally Awesome 80s Double Feature).  I was a bit disappointed that I got two movies on one disc, but that's okay since I wanted both movies. Tom Berringer can act, and he carried this film with help from the other actors.  I think they had a good script to work from, and actors that can carry and play off one another.The first movie was music driven and full of angst.  You began to travel through the memories with the piano player and find things he wasn't aware of, or was just too naive to accept as true.  It's a surprise ending that you suspect, but can't really believe.The second movie, also music driven, is hokey.  The acting by some of the characters is stilted, and fake by others.  Michael Pare, although he is nice to look at (I mean it girls this is sex on two legs), can't seem to pull off the angst ridden character like he did the first time. He also has no help with the acting as the other characters are self absorbed and and talk like they don't believe in the character they are playing. The music sequences are fun and the end of the movie almost reaches what the movie strives for. I would have bought this movie separately because it's a sequel to the first, but in this case I'm glad I don't have to.But for all that I just can't help myself.

local video rental store(remember those?) to get the worst movies we could find.Now I'm not saying that the Eddie And The Cruisers films are the worst movies in the world but they would certainly be schlock festival-worthy.These movies are so cheesy they could be stocked in the deli counter at your local grocery store.Eddie I just flat takes itself too seriously.Isn't rock & roll supposed to be fun?You'd think that Eddie was struggling to compose something like Mozart's Requiem instead of bouncy two and a half minute pop tunes.And Ellen Barkin's acting is similar to a mannequin with animated lips.How many times does she say ""Frank"" before each sentence?I lost count.Even with all this stinkiness going on,I still enjoyed the movie.Know why?I know this sounds corny but here goes:words and music.John Cafferty's soundtrack turns what could have been a truly wretched little movie into something kind of good.I think Eddie II is actually a better film than the first one because for two minutes it actually looks like Eddie is having fun.The delectable Marina Orsini could be the reason for Eddie's newfound happiness.And who couldn't love names like ""Quinn Quinley"",""Rick Diesel"" and ""Hilton Overstreet""?Geez,those names sound like they could be members of a fake band.....wait a minute.They are!Once again,John Cafferty carries the load with another batch of jaunty pop & roll songs.I also like the fact that the guy who plays the president of Satin Records looks like a chunky Leon Redbone.Both Eddie films are presented in non-anamorphic widescreen(1.85:1) with a soundtrack recorded in Dolby 2.0.Considering the large amount of music in these films,you'd think that the studio would have gone for at least Dolby 5.1(yummy DTS is probably out of the question)but I guess we wouldn't be getting two movies for ten bucks if that was the case.The Dolby 2.0 is surprisingly good in Eddie I with clear sound and a good amount of bass.Unfortunately,Eddie II goes the other way by not having much bass at all.I guess Sal Amato was deemed more worthy than Quinn Quinley by the bass gods.Eddie I's picture quality is decent for the most part but tends to get grainy in spots and its blacks aren't well-defined.Eddie II fares much better by having a clearer picture with few defects and more vibrant colors than Eddie I.For some reason,Eddie I's colors looked a bit washed out on my newer Samsung player but were much brighter on my older Philips machine.I'm not sure why.These movies are definitely worth the ten dollar asking price.Bring 'em to your next schlock festival.",3,Eddie

Back to Mr Pare'...he starred in a short-run TV series on the Houston PD, with another actor who looked like a Gibbs brother, back in the '80's, also; during another time of economic recession...so maybe the lack of ad money had something to do with why they didn't last.  I think Pare' is a mix of the Brando/Dean and Elvis type mystiques and he's got an appeal that captures a diverse audience, of both sexes and all ages.  Many thought these movies were a take-off on the demise of rocker, Eddie Cocheran.  I think they are great entertainment, to be watched over a big bowl of popcorn, any time and many times.  Great idea for the gals when the guys are in the middle of football season, for instance.  Amazon's always got what I'm looking for.  Been a faithful customer since day one, for reason's, just like this.

964628,AU8FA3O1B1E99,B000E0RN8S,"Susan M. Schmitt ""Sue Schmitt""","[0, 0]","I fell in love with this movie back when I first saw it on HBO in the 80's.  As a prior reviewer noted, this movie's theatrical release was not met with great success.  I don't ever remember seeing it come to the theaters in my area.  I would have gone to see it because I like the kind of music that was featured in it.  It was an intriguing plot.  Who hasn't gotten fed up with their life at some point and wished they could just disappear seemingly without any consequences?  With the first film, you see a talented up and coming musician.  He is sensitive, brillant and typically moody full of all the angst that his character could possibly relay.  Michael Pare did an outstanding job of portraying the tourchered Eddie Wilson.  We watch him as he tries to grow intellectually but he's not really sure what he is trying to grasp onto.  We see him see something in the character of Frank.  The two of them met on an intellectual level that no other member of the group was able to with the possible exception of the character of Joann, Eddie's longtime girlfriend.  Some how, despite all the trials and tribulations, this band was beginning to be successful.  They had a sound that the public responded to.  There was something in the intensity of Eddie Wilson's words that appealed to them.  Not only did Eddie Wilson touch the characters in the movies with his intensity, he touched those of us that were watching his story unfold.  The whole cast was an excellent roster of actors.  Once I saw this movie, I knew I had to add it to my audio/visual library.  I taped the movie the next time it ran on HBO.  I played it so much because I loved the music that the sound and picture finally wore out.  By that time though, the movie had been released on VHS.  As soon as I heard it had been released, I bought it.  I forget where I bought movies in those days.  We didn't have Amazon back then that made it easy to pick whichever merchant we wanted for the best prices on a movie. As soon as the cassette was released of the soundtrack, I went to the nearest music store and bought that as well.  Imagine my disappointment when the CD was finally released of it and there were a few songs that were missing from that release.  It was back to the movie again to get my fix of the marvelous sounds of John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band.  Bruce Springsteen eat your heart out.  This band has you beat to shame.  That is not to say that Bruce isn't worthy of a listen he is.  I have quite a few of his albums.  There was something about this movie and this music that touched my soul.  Apparently it touched a lot of other peoples soul as well because a sequel was released.  By that time, these two movies had reached cult status and rightly so.  Do I recommend these two movies and the subsequent soundtracks?  You bet I do.  Be careful which release of the soundtrack that you get though, there are different versions.

It was just a ""cool"" premise and people fell in love with the lost Eddie. The music on this is fantastic, at least to lots of us. Michael Pare` embodies the songs he sings. Even knowing that it was John Cafferty singing, the voice was strangely similar to Pare`s natural speaking voice. At any other time, Cafferty doesn't sound like this. So the movie was special in several ways and people loved it. Enough so that in 1989, Eddie and the Cruisers 2 was released with more of Cafferty's music. I feel this was even better than number one. You also see a lot more of Pare` who I think absolutely ""made"" the role. The movie has a lot of fire in it and great music along with subtle humor.
