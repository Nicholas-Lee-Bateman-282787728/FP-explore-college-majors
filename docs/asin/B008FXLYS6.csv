I offer you the following since the other reviews here are completely worthless.Disc 1 is ""A Bucket of Blood."" The second episode on that disc is the never-before-seen episode titled, ""The Killer Shrews."" Meanwhile, Disc 2 contains Elvira's take on ""Manos: The Hands of Fate,"" and they finish fans off with this warning: ""Don't Look in the Basement.""Taken from: [...]Like all of the previous releases in this series, some of which are in this collection, they are the full length episodes of ""Movie Macabre"" and well entertaining. Quality varies from movie to movie, not one is outstanding but quality is fine across the board. Check out the other collections including the recent Mega Movie Marathon for first time buyers who want more bang for the buck.Or should I have said, ""This is a great dvd. You play it on dvd players. Elvira is very talented and funny.
