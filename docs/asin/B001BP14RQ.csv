1172819,A339D7WDJTQUN8,B001BP14RQ,"Carol Nichols ""Otaku moe!""","[0, 1]","Like the last one I'm making a review for this series too. I first heard about this series during a trailer at the Bleach movie in theatres. I was so curious I worked overtime to squeeze extra money in. The beginning of Buso Renkin is like a combo of Bleach and FMA. While some might find this dull, offensive, or unoriginal, the cornerstone of the series lies within the turning point. Which this box set is known for(according to me, anyway.)Like before the characters are always intriguing, save Kazuki at times. Some might say that the first 10 episodes of Buso Renkin was an intro to their world merged with good-timing. Some might say: not bad, I say:tone down the explanations a bit. This half has little to no explanations and has great action scenes, supported with even better character development.Tokiko a battle hardened anti-hero who eventually turns to butter without the sight of Kazuki, this reminds us all of Koaru Kamiya from Rurouni Kenshin and how she feels towards Kenshin.Papillon a self-serving villian who wants to live, turns to a vengeful, yet ""respectable"" anti-hero, to a superhuman who can't live without his rival and best friend Kazuki.Finally, there's Kazuki who goes through many changes, that make you wonder how an ordinary boy can become one of the strongest Shonen Jump heroes. We think of Kazuki as an eternal optimist, who learns certain truths that shape into his own unique character.These aren't all the great developments, but just a piece of a pie that will eat you up.Some flaws include a backstory of the primary antagonist, or an epilogue. But the later 13 episodes make you forget the bad.The music is very good too, I might add, certain battles, feel right with this attribute.The only HORRIBLE thing about this series in general, is.... how short it is.Go out and buy the remaining Buso Renkin now! Or if you have neither, buy both at the same time.",5,Before: Unsure...

1172820,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B001BP14RQ,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[1, 1]","Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~While a very high tech original anime, Buso Renkin is really a bizarre one (in my experience). While things are always ending up in twists and new revelations. Buso Renkin's story begins with a good overall beginning. Kazuki Moto wondering an abandoned building where a homonculus attacks and he dies. Soon after he wakes up from this with what he supposes is the truth, the chilling reality is by far more complex than that. He died but was saved at the last moment by a strange device (named a Kakugane medallion) that kept his heart beating thanks to Tokiko Tsumura. She is a type of alchemist who had been on a mission until she stumbled on ,Kazuki, being almost killed, so interfered in hopes of saving him. Later,  Kazuki wakes up like any other day trying to make sense if his death happened (or him almost dying. He did die but planted the Kakugane medallion in his heart giving him life again). Having brief flashbacks to what really happened he decides to go back to the moment he supposedly died. You'd think he'd learn to stay away but he doesn't and the same homonculus is still there. But really can't forget the girl who saved him and feels an intense feeling of gratitude. This time when around when he returns he isn't so defenseless and finds that he is rather strong against this humonculus. Tokiko when seeing him can't believe how well can he handle and wield the kakugane or that it's activating at all to his wield to fight. To her its a seemingly really unconventional and doesn't know whether if its from the medallionitself or from his own latent power. Whatever the reason, is going to find soon enough that something is really wrong with him because of his new heart implant.  In this way Kazuki and Tokiko are thrust into a world of the homomculus and Buso renkin (arms alchemy) together.Buso Renkin doesn't stay boring for long if it ever was. Changes a lot throughout the anime with varying entertaining cast of both friends and enemies. Papillon who dresses in a black and purple butterfly unitard. He is one of the first major villains that comes to mind.While sensitive sometimes he also has a quick changing mood. Although he can be a really hilarious guy at times too and a wise thinker. Though he's a villain at first it becomes interesting to see he later is one of  Kazuki and Tokiko's closest allies. While another early ally is Captain Bravo.The guy has really amazing (as in a-- beautiful to look at) character design along with other characters and the world in general in Buso Renkin. Kazuki is often mentioned to adore Tokiko, so much he's willing to fight to protect her at very extreme lenghts seen in the anime. When he does Buso Renkin shows its action empowered with moments of action suspense that's exquisite to watch. For in its own right the fights are fierce at times. In Buso Renkin there that are individuals that are capable to harness abilities with the use of kagukanes that all, are unique to their users. They are then ranked by how strong their abilities are. The world of Buso Renkin is sort of mecha (machine created) but it doesn't do it justice. It's entirely unique with a terrific plot as well as character development. As far as the animation itself it really has a great array of well-designed characters. The animation is clean in nice lighting and bright. Found highly attractive and new from most anime serieses.Buso Renkin is much more recommended to fans of Inuyasha (a comparison that's a bit close) and anime watchers that love a plot that's really action filled but with an injection of romance. Buso Renkin find brings really tough animation and the thrill of high action together with some romance which is not all badly combined.Genre: Action/Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Romance, AlchemyContains: Dark side, Developing PowersAnime Soundtrack Side-note: The opening for the anime of Buso Renkin was pretty nice. Felt went well with the overall anime. The Opening theme song was ""Makka Na Chikai"" by Yoshiki Fukuyama.The Closing theme songs found alright. The closing theme for the first half of the series was ""Hoshiakari"" by Jyukai. For the second half of the series it was ""Itoshiki Sekai"" by Aya Kagami.",5,Buso Renkin find brings really tough animation and the thrill of high action together,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,4264,"['Full', 'non-spoiler', 'review', 'courtesy', '~', 'Book', 'Movie', 'Dimension', 'Blog', 'very', 'high', 'tech', 'original', 'anime', 'Buso', 'Renkin', 'really', 'bizarre', 'one', 'experience', 'things', 'are', 'always', 'ending', 'up', 'twists', 'new', 'revelations', 'Buso', 'Renkin', 'story', 'good', 'overall', 'beginning', 'Kazuki', 'Moto', 'wondering', 'abandoned', 'building', 'where', 'homonculus', 'attacks', 'Soon', 'up', 'what', 'truth', 'chilling', 'reality', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'died', 'was', 'saved', 'last', 'moment', 'strange', 'device', 'named', 'Kakugane', 'medallion', 'kept', 'heart', 'beating', 'thanks', 'Tokiko', 'Tsumura', 'type', 'alchemist', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'mission', 'stumbled', 'Kazuki', 'being', 'almost', 'killed', 'so', 'interfered', 'hopes', 'saving', 'Later', 'Kazuki', 'up', 'other', 'day', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'death', 'happened', 'almost', 'dying', 'did', 'die', 'planted', 'Kakugane', 'medallion', 'heart', 'giving', 'life', 'again', 'Having', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'go', 'back', 'moment', 'supposedly', 'died', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'learn', 'stay', 'away', ""n't"", 'same', 'homonculus', 'still', 'there', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'girl', 'who', 'saved', 'feels', 'intense', 'feeling', 'gratitude', 'time', 'when', 'around', 'when', ""n't"", 'so', 'defenseless', 'rather', 'strong', 'humonculus', 'Tokiko', 'when', 'seeing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'handle', 'wield', 'kakugane', 'activating', 'wield', 'fight', 'seemingly', 'really', 'unconventional', ""n't"", 'know', 'medallionitself', 'own', 'latent', 'power', 'reason', 'going', 'find', 'soon', 'enough', 'something', 'really', 'wrong', 'new', 'heart', 'implant', 'way', 'Kazuki', 'Tokiko', 'are', 'thrust', 'world', 'homomculus', 'Buso', 'renkin', 'arms', 'alchemy', 'together.Buso', 'Renkin', ""n't"", 'stay', 'boring', 'long', 'ever', 'was', 'lot', 'anime', 'varying', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'friends', 'enemies', 'Papillon', 'who', 'black', 'purple', 'butterfly', 'unitard', 'one', 'first', 'major', 'villains', 'mind.While', 'sensitive', 'sometimes', 'also', 'quick', 'changing', 'mood', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'hilarious', 'guy', 'times', 'too', 'wise', 'thinker', 'villain', 'first', 'interesting', 'see', 'later', 'one', 'Kazuki', 'Tokiko', 'closest', 'allies', 'early', 'ally', 'Captain', 'Bravo.The', 'guy', 'really', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'look', 'character', 'design', 'other', 'characters', 'world', 'general', 'Buso', 'Renkin', 'Kazuki', 'often', 'mentioned', 'adore', 'Tokiko', 'so', 'much', 'willing', 'fight', 'protect', 'very', 'extreme', 'lenghts', 'seen', 'anime', 'When', 'Buso', 'Renkin', 'action', 'empowered', 'moments', 'action', 'suspense', 'exquisite', 'watch', 'own', 'right', 'fights', 'are', 'fierce', 'times', 'Buso', 'Renkin', 'are', 'individuals', 'are', 'capable', 'harness', 'abilities', 'use', 'kagukanes', 'are', 'unique', 'users', 'are', 'then', 'ranked', 'how', 'strong', 'abilities', 'are', 'world', 'Buso', 'Renkin', 'sort', 'mecha', 'machine', 'created', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'entirely', 'unique', 'terrific', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'development', 'As', 'far', 'animation', 'really', 'great', 'array', 'well-designed', 'characters', 'animation', 'clean', 'nice', 'lighting', 'bright', 'Found', 'highly', 'attractive', 'new', 'most', 'anime', 'serieses.Buso', 'Renkin', 'much', 'more', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Inuyasha', 'comparison', 'bit', 'close', 'anime', 'watchers', 'love', 'plot', 'really', 'action', 'filled', 'injection', 'romance', 'Buso', 'Renkin', 'find', 'brings', 'really', 'tough', 'animation', 'thrill', 'high', 'action', 'together', 'romance', 'not', 'badly', 'combined.Genre', 'Action/Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Dark', 'side', 'Developing', 'PowersAnime', 'Soundtrack', 'Side-note', 'opening', 'anime', 'Buso', 'Renkin', 'was', 'pretty', 'nice', 'Felt', 'went', 'well', 'overall', 'anime', 'Opening', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'Makka', 'Na', 'Chikai', 'Yoshiki', 'Fukuyama.The', 'Closing', 'theme', 'songs', 'found', 'alright', 'closing', 'theme', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'was', 'Hoshiakari', 'Jyukai', 'second', 'half', 'series', 'was', 'Itoshiki', 'Sekai', 'Aya', 'Kagami']",Buso Renkin Set 2

1172825,AMZF6CTXFSJRW,B001BP14RQ,Michiru,"[2, 3]","I watched ""Buso Renkin"" back in Japan when it originally aired, and it quickly became a favorite.  I was very excited to find out it was being released here in America.The basic story, as introduced in the first box set (and/or the original manga volumes), is this: high school student Kazuki Mutou finds his small town is overrun by evil creatures called homunculus.  A brave group of soldiers, called the LXE, fights them with alchemic weapons called ""buso renkin"".  To save Kazuki's life one night, a female soldier named Tokiko Tsumura gives him a buso renkin, which inadvertently draws him into the battle.  Kazuki thus is forced to try and balance his school life with his new role as a protector of regular people; he's helped by LXE soldiers (especially Tokiko, with whom he has an ongoing almost-romance) and his supportive school friends.Everything gets more complicated in the second half of the series.  The LXE, who were Kazuki's friends up until recently, suddenly turn against him; this forces Tokiko into a difficult position.  Will she choose love for Kazuki or duty to her superior officers?  Meanwhile, a mischievous homunculus named Papillion, up until now a villain, might be Kazuki's greatest ally--if he doesn't kill him first.  What does he really think of Kazuki?  The question, ambiguous in the first part of the series, becomes crucial here.Episodes 14-26 are thus spent following Kazuki as he tries to keep himself alive, find out more about the LXE and homunculus, and finally is forced to make a terrible choice to save his loved ones.All the characters from the first box set make welcome reappearances here to shake the story up, and a handful of new LXE members help add some dimension to the side characters like Tokiko and the LXE Captain Bravo.  A good sense of humor and numerous actions scenes break up the drama and romance, which makes the series move rapidly.  And, thankfully, the anime does a good job of changing bits and pieces of the original manga story.  While the endings of the two versions are similar, the changes kept me guessing without being disrespectful to the manga and turned me into a fan of the anime in its own right.This series is not perfect.  Some bits are rushed, some action scenes aren't very good, and a few humor scenes seem pointless.  But wonderful characters, great acting, an engaging story and a strong sense of fun made this series one of my favorites.  Watching it for the second time subtitled, I found I hadn't lost interest in the least.  Heartily recommended if you're looking for a fun action story.",4,Finally!,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,2581,"['watched', 'Buso', 'Renkin', 'back', 'Japan', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'quickly', 'became', 'favorite', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'here', 'America.The', 'basic', 'story', 'introduced', 'first', 'box', 'set', 'original', 'manga', 'volumes', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Kazuki', 'Mutou', 'small', 'town', 'overrun', 'evil', 'creatures', 'called', 'homunculus', 'brave', 'group', 'soldiers', 'called', 'LXE', 'alchemic', 'weapons', 'called', 'buso', 'renkin', 'save', 'Kazuki', 'life', 'one', 'night', 'female', 'soldier', 'named', 'Tokiko', 'Tsumura', 'buso', 'renkin', 'inadvertently', 'battle', 'Kazuki', 'thus', 'forced', 'try', 'balance', 'school', 'life', 'new', 'role', 'protector', 'regular', 'people', 'helped', 'LXE', 'soldiers', 'especially', 'Tokiko', 'whom', 'ongoing', 'almost-romance', 'supportive', 'school', 'friends.Everything', 'more', 'complicated', 'second', 'half', 'series', 'LXE', 'who', 'were', 'Kazuki', 'friends', 'up', 'recently', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'Tokiko', 'difficult', 'position', 'Will', 'choose', 'love', 'Kazuki', 'duty', 'superior', 'officers', 'Meanwhile', 'mischievous', 'homunculus', 'named', 'Papillion', 'up', 'now', 'villain', 'might', 'be', 'Kazuki', 'greatest', 'ally', ""n't"", 'kill', 'first', 'What', 'really', 'think', 'Kazuki', 'question', 'ambiguous', 'first', 'part', 'series', 'crucial', 'here.Episodes', '14-26', 'are', 'thus', 'spent', 'following', 'Kazuki', 'keep', 'alive', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'LXE', 'homunculus', 'finally', 'forced', 'make', 'terrible', 'choice', 'save', 'loved', 'characters', 'first', 'box', 'set', 'make', 'welcome', 'reappearances', 'here', 'shake', 'story', 'up', 'handful', 'new', 'LXE', 'members', 'help', 'add', 'dimension', 'side', 'characters', 'Tokiko', 'LXE', 'Captain', 'Bravo', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'numerous', 'actions', 'scenes', 'break', 'up', 'drama', 'romance', 'series', 'move', 'rapidly', 'thankfully', 'anime', 'good', 'job', 'changing', 'bits', 'pieces', 'original', 'manga', 'story', 'endings', 'two', 'versions', 'are', 'similar', 'changes', 'kept', 'guessing', 'being', 'disrespectful', 'manga', 'turned', 'fan', 'anime', 'own', 'right.This', 'series', 'not', 'perfect', 'bits', 'are', 'rushed', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'few', 'humor', 'scenes', 'seem', 'pointless', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'great', 'acting', 'engaging', 'story', 'strong', 'sense', 'fun', 'made', 'series', 'one', 'favorites', 'Watching', 'second', 'time', 'subtitled', 'found', 'had', ""n't"", 'lost', 'interest', 'least', 'Heartily', 'recommended', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fun', 'action', 'story']",Buso Renkin Set 2
