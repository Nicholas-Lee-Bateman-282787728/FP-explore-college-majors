I want to tell you WHY:In my travels, I have re-routed my ""trail"" to pass through countries/states that I had NO business in for the SAKE of being able to say""I was there"" (Easter Sunday, I was at The Vatican).====> To actually get TO Alaska --- or Florida --- you'll HAVE TO make, lengthy, unnecessary, ""additional"", side-trips out-of-the way.====> I don't like snakes; swamps; mosquitoes; nor alligators.====> I HATE cold --- yeah, I know, I live in Central Europe [snow] --- but, at least I don't have to worry about POLAR BEARS, and theextinct {Wachtkueppel}volcano in our backyard doesn't accumulate enough snow to worry about escaping an avalanche...and, I've only been to Switzerland two or three times, which is more than enough for ME!That said, here's my review:NOT been THERE; HAVEN'T done THAT.Watching THIS movie in a WARM denwill be SAFE, and the movie isn't tooexpensive.

That said, this one reached an all time low. First, Thomas Ian Griffith isn't a really awful actor, but here is absolutely no chemistry between him and Caroleen Feeney. And Feeney is a wooden actress. I thought maybe C. Thomas Howell would rescue this film, but he has about 7 minutes of screen time... so really just a cameo. As others have mentioned, the ""special"" effects are the worst! I've seen better YouTube vids made by graphic designers goofing around. As far as plot, it sort of has something going on, but the meandering drama behind the disaster is dull, dull, dull. I feel as though 90 minutes of my life has been sucked out of me. If I hadn't been doing laundry and somewhat distracted as I paused and came back to this film twice, I would have been depressed.",1,"Bad, bad, bad. And C.

The reasons behind the treachary adds mystery to the story and the lose of friendship between Dr. Lia Freeman and her husband's pilot friend adds depth to it.The oil people hopes Dr. Freeman is nothing but an alarmist and too emotionally involved.I was expecting an explosion of the plane.Of course Grifith's bed interest was a bit trite [or silly] but what can you expect from the male intellect.An how else is anyone going to see what looks like an actual avalanche?

692839,A27BY97QQS36V3,B0000633RY,"Tanya L. Schaub ""TSchlaack""","[9, 13]","Let me start by saying I rented this from the local video store with high hopes based on the back of the DVD.  The story line is very interesting and pulled me in.  The scenery was really nice (which gives it the 1.5 stars)But, and I do mean BUT it was painful to watch!  The special effects were so bad that I have seen local kids produce better things.  The snow scenes where the avalanche goes through the town were obviously scales as they looked like models.The premise is that there is a new pipeline being built over the tundra and into Juneau, which is in a valley and the main character thinks that there is just to much chance for something to go wrong and a giant avalanche to bury the town.  You see she has a past experience with avalanches as she has lived through one from years ago.  So now she is with the EPA and out to stop the project, almost reluctantly with the help of a former friend.  There is even a scene with a wild wolf cub... (Cute but not real believable)...On top of that the acting was just ok.  I didn't believe the characters though I have seen some of these same actors in other movies, do well.  There were just way to many unbelievable scenes to enjoy the movie.Don't spend your money on this one if you must then rent it.",1,1.5 for the story idea...,1035849600,"10 29, 2002",2002,1260,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'rented', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'high', 'hopes', 'based', 'back', 'DVD', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'interesting', 'pulled', 'scenery', 'was', 'really', 'nice', '1.5', 'stars', 'do', 'mean', 'BUT', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'have', 'seen', 'local', 'kids', 'produce', 'better', 'things', 'snow', 'where', 'avalanche', 'town', 'were', 'obviously', 'scales', 'looked', 'models.The', 'premise', 'new', 'pipeline', 'being', 'built', 'tundra', 'Juneau', 'valley', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'much', 'chance', 'something', 'go', 'wrong', 'giant', 'avalanche', 'bury', 'town', 'see', 'past', 'experience', 'avalanches', 'lived', 'one', 'years', 'ago', 'So', 'now', 'EPA', 'stop', 'project', 'almost', 'reluctantly', 'help', 'former', 'friend', 'even', 'scene', 'wild', 'wolf', 'cub', 'Cute', 'not', 'real', 'believable', 'top', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'ok', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'same', 'actors', 'other', 'movies', 'do', 'well', 'were', 'just', 'way', 'many', 'unbelievable', 'scenes', 'enjoy', 'movie.Do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'money', 'one', 'must', 'then', 'rent']",Escape From Alaska
