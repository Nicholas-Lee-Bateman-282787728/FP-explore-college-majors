481977,A2ORZYOH2IRT9W,6305885141,Jason Dodge,"[17, 17]","Want proof that this isn't a true sequel: Even Iron Monkey himself never dresses like he did in the first film.  Before he always had half his face covered, but now he does most his fighting in leisure suits with everyone seeing his face. Even the original music is absent, instead we get a musical score from the movie ""True Lies"" (I know, I own the soundtrack) during the action scenes, repeating the same string in one of the music tracks over and over (almost in every fight--at least at 5 different times!). In fact, besides dubbing in the use of the name ""Iron Monkey"" every once and a while, this is basically an older Donnie Yen movie re-released with the ""Iron Monkey 2"" label. Somebody tried way to hard to market in on the ""Iron Monkey"" name, and it shows quite badly.The only thing that made me keep watching was the frequent appearance of astonishing hyper-kinetic fight scenes choreographed by Yuen Ho-Ping, not the endlessly inventive Yuen Woo-Ping (as Amazon.com states), who came to fame as the fight choreographer of ""The Matrix."" Many people think that Woo-Ping did the fight choreography in this one... but he didn't. Those that have seen many of his other movies will notice the fight scenes lack a certain charisma that only Woo-Ping can deliver. Still, the curious thing is that, after a while, this choppy movie starts to lurch into a good-old kung fu spectacle. Iron Monkey 2 grows strangely compelling. It's as if, through directorial incompetence, the movie has been distilled to the basic elements of cinematic storytelling.This is not Yuen Woo-Ping's work, but I believe you may find it worth it because of Donnie Yen, who many believe is up there in on screen-fighting-fireworks with the likes of Jet Li and Jackie Chan. The other highlight in this movie was the actor who portrayed the son looking for his father --he had incredible martial arts skills in his own right. His fight with Donnie Yen was arguably one of the better ones in the film. The one bad thing was that we get more fighting from this looking-for-father guy than Donnie Yen himself. He's not a bad fighter, but I bought the movie looking for most of the fights with the Iron Monkey himself involved.By itself, you have some good fighting with some really bad dubbing and a reused music track from the movie ""True Lies."" But when you slap the name of the sequel to one of Yuen Woo-Ping's best work to it, too many comparisons will be made.",1,"Not a Sequel to ""Iron Monkey,"" It's a old Donnie Yen film!",1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,2438,"['Want', 'proof', ""n't"", 'true', 'sequel', 'Even', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'never', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'always', 'had', 'half', 'face', 'covered', 'now', 'most', 'fighting', 'leisure', 'suits', 'everyone', 'seeing', 'face', 'Even', 'original', 'music', 'absent', 'instead', 'get', 'musical', 'score', 'movie', 'True', 'Lies', 'know', 'own', 'soundtrack', 'action', 'scenes', 'repeating', 'same', 'string', 'one', 'music', 'almost', 'fight', 'least', '5', 'different', 'times', 'fact', 'dubbing', 'use', 'name', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'once', 'while', 'basically', 'older', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'movie', 're-released', 'Iron', 'Monkey', '2', 'label', 'Somebody', 'tried', 'way', 'hard', 'market', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'name', 'quite', 'badly.The', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'keep', 'watching', 'was', 'frequent', 'appearance', 'astonishing', 'hyper-kinetic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'choreographed', 'Yuen', 'Ho-Ping', 'not', 'endlessly', 'inventive', 'Yuen', 'Woo-Ping', 'Amazon.com', 'states', 'who', 'came', 'fame', 'fight', 'choreographer', 'Matrix', 'Many', 'people', 'think', 'Woo-Ping', 'did', 'fight', 'choreography', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'will', 'notice', 'fight', 'scenes', 'lack', 'certain', 'charisma', 'only', 'Woo-Ping', 'can', 'deliver', 'Still', 'curious', 'thing', 'while', 'choppy', 'movie', 'lurch', 'good-old', 'kung', 'fu', 'spectacle', 'Iron', 'Monkey', '2', 'grows', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'directorial', 'incompetence', 'movie', 'been', 'distilled', 'basic', 'elements', 'cinematic', 'storytelling.This', 'not', 'Yuen', 'Woo-Ping', 'work', 'believe', 'may', 'find', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'who', 'many', 'believe', 'up', 'there', 'screen-fighting-fireworks', 'likes', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'other', 'highlight', 'movie', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'son', 'looking', 'father', 'had', 'incredible', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'own', 'right', 'fight', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'was', 'arguably', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'film', 'one', 'bad', 'thing', 'was', 'get', 'more', 'fighting', 'looking-for-father', 'guy', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'not', 'bad', 'fighter', 'bought', 'movie', 'looking', 'most', 'fights', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'have', 'good', 'fighting', 'really', 'bad', 'dubbing', 'reused', 'music', 'track', 'movie', 'True', 'Lies', 'when', 'slap', 'name', 'sequel', 'one', 'Yuen', 'Woo-Ping', 'best', 'work', 'too', 'many', 'comparisons', 'will', 'be', 'made']",Iron Monkey 2

481981,A35M5MBA88SI08,6305885141,Patrick Murphy,"[9, 9]","The first Iron Monkey is a classic, sometimes cited as the best fightchoreography ever done by Yuen Wo Ping.  I'd recommend skipping arental and just buying it.  Iron Monkey 2, however, barely merits arental -- and even then only if you have a high tolerance for stupidvillains, a paper-thin plot, and execrable dubbing.I give it twostars only because I still like Donnie Yen, some of the characters arepotentially interesting (in an unfulfilled sort of way), and the fightchoreography is decent enough to grab your attention (though perhapnot to sustain it through the less action-filled -- and moreactionable -- stretches).To say that this film has only a tenuousconnection to the original Iron Monkey is rather generous.  (The backof the video box charts new linguistic territory by describing it as a&quot;semi-sequel.&quot;) It takes place about a hundred years afterthe first movie, apparently during the Japanese occupation of China(but with what appear to be modern handguns); Donnie Yen is in bothmovies, though playing different characters, and a hero called IronMonkey obviously has a central role in both.  Also like the firstmovie, the Good Guys seem to be fighting against corrupt officials,but character motivation is not this film's specialty; characterorigins and motivations are murky at best, absent at worst.I won'teven attempt to enumerate the script problems.  Some of them mayactually be due to the poor dubbing, but that can't excuse the entireplot; still, if plot's important to you then you won't be watchingthis in the first place.  Suffice to say that things don't work out asyou expect, and even the finale has nosignificance outside of the choreography.But as for thechoreography . . . well, the wire work is decent.  Some of the scenesare even engaging, especially the first fight between the two heroes.There's nothing groundbreaking, like the fight on the townspeople'sshoulders in Fong Sai Yuk or the fight on the poles in the first IronMonkey, but the fight scenes are reasonably diverting.  Aside from thelack of anything new here, my largest complaint would be that neitherthe heroes nor the villains had anything interesting or unusual intheir gong fu repertoires.If you're interested in the breadth of HKcinema and/or in Yuen Wo Ping's filmography, Iron Monkey 2 isn't a*total* waste of time; it's just a *relative* waste of time,considering the finitude of a human life.",2,"From number 1 to number 2, it's a long way down.",991440000,"06 2, 2001",2001,2410,"['first', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'classic', 'sometimes', 'cited', 'best', 'fightchoreography', 'ever', 'done', 'Yuen', 'Wo', 'Ping', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'skipping', 'arental', 'just', 'buying', 'Iron', 'Monkey', '2', 'however', 'barely', 'arental', 'even', 'then', 'only', 'have', 'high', 'tolerance', 'stupidvillains', 'paper-thin', 'plot', 'execrable', 'dubbing.I', 'give', 'only', 'still', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'characters', 'arepotentially', 'interesting', 'unfulfilled', 'sort', 'way', 'fightchoreography', 'decent', 'enough', 'grab', 'attention', 'perhapnot', 'sustain', 'less', 'action-filled', 'moreactionable', 'stretches', '.To', 'say', 'film', 'only', 'tenuousconnection', 'original', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'rather', 'generous', 'backof', 'video', 'box', 'new', 'linguistic', 'territory', 'describing', 'quot', 'semi-sequel.', 'quot', 'place', 'hundred', 'years', 'afterthe', 'first', 'movie', 'apparently', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'China', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'modern', 'handguns', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'bothmovies', 'playing', 'different', 'characters', 'hero', 'called', 'IronMonkey', 'obviously', 'central', 'role', 'Also', 'firstmovie', 'Good', 'Guys', 'seem', 'be', 'fighting', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'character', 'motivation', 'not', 'film', 'specialty', 'characterorigins', 'motivations', 'are', 'murky', 'best', 'absent', 'worst.I', ""won'teven"", 'attempt', 'enumerate', 'script', 'problems', 'mayactually', 'be', 'due', 'poor', 'dubbing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'entireplot', 'still', 'plot', 'important', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watchingthis', 'first', 'place', 'Suffice', 'say', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'asyou', 'expect', 'even', 'finale', 'nosignificance', 'choreography.But', 'thechoreography', 'well', 'wire', 'work', 'decent', 'scenesare', 'even', 'engaging', 'especially', 'first', 'fight', 'two', 'nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'fight', ""townspeople'sshoulders"", 'Fong', 'Sai', 'Yuk', 'fight', 'poles', 'first', 'IronMonkey', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'reasonably', 'diverting', 'Aside', 'thelack', 'anything', 'new', 'here', 'largest', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'neitherthe', 'heroes', 'villains', 'had', 'anything', 'interesting', 'unusual', 'intheir', 'gong', 'fu', 'repertoires.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'breadth', 'HKcinema', 'and/or', 'Yuen', 'Wo', 'Ping', 'filmography', 'Iron', 'Monkey', '2', ""n't"", 'a*total*', 'waste', 'time', 'just', '*relative*', 'waste', 'time', 'considering', 'finitude', 'human', 'life']",Iron Monkey 2
