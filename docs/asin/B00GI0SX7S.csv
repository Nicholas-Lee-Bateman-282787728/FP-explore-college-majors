However as I watched it, I appreciated that it could develop a serious action-based story amidst all the humor.  I trusted Glen Murakami (who had developed his art style from Batman TAS & Superman TAS), and was not disappointed in the end. This show however - ""Teen Titans Go!"" is a Travesty! You remove the best elements of the Teen Titans series, and what is left is a sugar-rush comedy fest only children with ADD could enjoy, sadly matching every other garbage comedy series on CN at present. I understand it is ""supposed"" to be a comedy, but even in that it fails. Nobody from Teen Titans (aside from the voice actors) is involved with this production, that speaks volumes to me. The death of excellent action cartoons has not gone unnoticed by the fan community. All the DC comic and character references in the world cannot make this show decent. Please do not purchase this DVD if you are a fan of action/superhero animated series. But if you are of the group that thinks what CN has now should be considered entertainment, then I guess this show is for you.",1,Garbage,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,1180,"['When', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'aired', 'back', '2003', 'admittedly', 'took', 'while', 'adjust', 'look', 'feel', 'show', 'However', 'watched', 'appreciated', 'could', 'develop', 'serious', 'action-based', 'story', 'humor', 'trusted', 'Glen', 'Murakami', 'who', 'had', 'developed', 'art', 'style', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'Superman', 'TAS', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'end', 'show', 'however', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'Go', 'Travesty', 'remove', 'best', 'elements', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'series', 'what', 'left', 'sugar-rush', 'comedy', 'fest', 'only', 'children', 'ADD', 'could', 'enjoy', 'sadly', 'matching', 'other', 'garbage', 'comedy', 'series', 'CN', 'present', 'understand', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'even', 'Nobody', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'aside', 'voice', 'actors', 'involved', 'production', 'volumes', 'death', 'excellent', 'action', 'cartoons', 'not', 'gone', 'unnoticed', 'fan', 'community', 'DC', 'comic', 'character', 'references', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'show', 'decent', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'are', 'fan', 'action/superhero', 'animated', 'series', 'are', 'group', 'what', 'CN', 'now', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'entertainment', 'then', 'guess', 'show']","Teen Titans Go!: Mission To Misbehave, Season 1, Part 1"

Simone,"[34, 42]","I too was a bit thrown astray when I found out that the Teen Titans were getting an entire new series based off of anime chibi-styled comedic versions of themselves. However, upon viewing a few episodes, it's not half bad. It's funny, pokes some jokes at the old series, and just tries to give the viewers a fun and entertaining 11 minutes, which it does a pretty good job of doing.For all the haters out there, look, I get where you're coming from. You hate to see the awesome, butt-kicking characters you know and love turned into purely comedic characters. I get it. But here's why you shouldn't be mad simply because of that:-This series has nothing to do with the old series. Other than the fact that it's the same team and they have the same voice actors, this is not a continuation of the story in the old series. This has nothing to do with the old series at all.If you don't like it because you just don't think it's that funny, that's fine. But don't hate it simply because it's a comedic version of something you liked. Imagine if they made a similar cartoon but with Batman, and he was still voiced by Kevin Conroy. Would you still be mad? Would it be tarnishing the awesomeness that is Batman The Animated Series? Of course not. Heck, if there was ever a series like that, I personally would see it the second it premiered. Why? It has nothing to do with the old series, and is just a comedic version.Again, I understand for those that still refuse to like it simply because of this, but don't blame Cartoon Network for &#34;turning the Teen Titans into these childish toon characters!&#34; The old series is still there, this is not a continuation and has no link to the old series at all. They didn't turn them into anything as this isn't a continuation to that story.

1678501,AQ81L25HHHB18,B00GI0SX7S,S.W.,"[0, 0]","...and that's why I like this show! I know that it ticks a lot of people off that these are not the ""serious,"" kick-butt Teen Titans that they know and love from the other series, but I like them this way. Not being much into superheroes anyway, I personally don't mind at all that this isn't yet another show about superheroes stomping super-villain butt and saving the day (and the world, and the universe, and other worlds and universes, etc.). It's purely for comedy, which I greatly appreciate!There's a lot of good stuff on this show (and on these DVDs) for those who are willing to check out the show and aren't so vehemently opposed to the idea of the TT being ""re-done"" as a bunch of TRULY comical characters as to  literally refuse to like the show or even give it a chance. As Starfire says in one of these episodes, ""Haters gonna hate."" But for those who don't insist on or persist in hating the show because it doesn't try to be like the original series (or ANY more ""usual"" superhero show), there's much entertainment and enjoyment (and many laughs) to be found here!There's plenty here to tickle the funny bone, from the Titans seeking the ingredients for the ultimate sandwich; to overly-vigilant Robin trying to learn to relax; to the team trying to decide who's going to do the laundry; to Silkie escaping from the Tower and (obliviously) having a wild adventure; to Cyborg and Beast Boy trying desperately to get a pizza for free; to Robin getting actual superpowers; to BB teaching honest Starfire how to tell lies; to Raven cracking a tooth; to Robin seeking a magical replacement for his broken staff; to Cy and BB battling it out with each other over whether burgers or burritos are better; to Raven being split into five different versions of herself with different personalities... and more! While those examples, or most of them, may make it sound like the episodes are about things so mundane that they couldn't possibly be funny, hilarity and wacky twists and turns abound in them and in the others!(By the way, keep an eye [and an ear] out for the many ""Bat-jokes"" in the episodes!)Below is a listing of the episodes on the DVDs. Rather than having two (or even more) episodes (or ""shorts"") to a track, as many cartoon DVDs do, the discs have each episode on its own track (which I'm grateful for):Disc 1: 1.
