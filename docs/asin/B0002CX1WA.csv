830856,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0002CX1WA,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 3]","'The Apprentice' should hardly be evaluated as the underdog of reality television.  Slickly, but sharply presented, it provided a petri dish of capitalism with the drama that can't fail to enthrall a NYSE broker or an unfamiliar novice.  The elements are assembled expertly by 'Survivor' creator, Mark Burnett, and Donald Trump.  Editing certainly was one of the main ingredients of success, but the candidates are captivating enough to make season one an absorbing serial drama.  Alumni Bill Rancic in his autobiographical business memoir, called 'The Apprentice,' a game show.  Deference should be showed for his evaluation, but they could have fooled us. It seems more like a simulation.Season one comes together serendipitously for three reasons:  the task, taskmaster, and the takers.  Mystery pervades every episode with a colorful group of contestants, an assignment with a different business aspect provided, and an elimination round that is suspenseful and skillfully prepared.  (What will they have to do?  How will they get their act together?  Who will get fired?)  Then, in the middle of the episode, The Donald has a cameo appearance where he expounds on the business lesson or principle, usually highlighting a contestant's later actions.  It could have come across as a schmaltzy business lesson, but his folksy, no-nonsense lecture becomes an illuminating intermission.Season one works well for the cast of characters.  (And, as contestants, there are plenty here!)  The first season was not just successful because of viewer curiosity, it worked because the first group had less talent, but more heart and colorful personalities overall.  There was a savvy, charismatic businesswoman from Texas (Amy), a colorful cowboy from Boise, ID (Troy), a brash, but spunky New Yorker (Heidi), a smooth and learned broker (Kwame), and a calm and hard-working entrepreneur from Chicago (Bill) just to name a few.  The drama seems genuine and not forced.  (The premise contained risks that could have been a disaster.)  The plot thickened with alliances that were made and broken, but more interesting was the love interest of Amy and Nick.  Both the couple and the producers captured the relationship in a way to keep it from overtaking the main story, but the presentation kept us guessing whether it was genuine love or a ploy at office politics.  Furthermore, a villain was added to the mix.  Omarossa Manigault-Stallworth--forgive me for the misspelling!--formerly worked for the Clinton administration and had the political skills to throw a wrench into everything.  She wasn't rationalizing when she said she was way too creative to take a job with Donald Trump.  An aspiring actress, she's been successful for Halle Berry's 'Catwoman' and a UPN soap opera.  Maybe she was grooming to be the next Erica Caine/Susan Lucci all along.  To her credit, The Donald called her the ""most articulate"" of all the candidates.  Not to spoil discoveries with too many details, but Nick's honesty and chauvenism, Amy's perfectionism, and Heidi's family drama are just a few developments added to keep our interest. Seldom have people on a reality show been more interesting than with this ensemble.Upon the debut, we all became armchair quarterbacks, calling them out for dumb plays and wrongly calling out Donald Trump for some executive decisions.  However, results are everything.  He didn't get to be a billionaire for bad judgment!And, that's where the success falls apart.  Sam correctly distinguished the difference between good candidacy and good television with his 'Apprentice' website commentary.  To paraphrase, a good strategy and engaging television can often come at cross-purposes.  True to himself, after season one Donald Trump showcased bigger clients with bigger prizes and candidates with far better resumes.  The result was a feeding frenzy that fostered business accumen like never before and aspiring starlets mugging for the camera.  The professionals devoured the latter.  Stacy J., for instance, was unfairly eliminated early and accused of lunacy for her vibrant, cheerleading sensibilities.  If the catclaws were apparent season one, they at least managed to put them away in time to win against the men!  Season two was bloody.  The later simulations often failed to surprise.  Later, it was harder to like the candidates.  Trump's admirable genuineness created, but later faded--at least to date--the show.  ('L.A. Apprentice' proves that, like his comeback from a few financial setbacks, that Donald Trump, himself, is a survivor who refuses to give up even a portion of his portfolio.)",5,'Survivor' Goes to the

Sixteen candidates are given different business tasks each week, with the person most accountable for failure subsequently fired.

Yes, for all the Apprentice-wannabes, open the flap of the boxed set's slipcase at the store - and you get hear Mr. Trump actually fire you. It's an amusing little gimmick.The episodes are presented in the same format as they were shown on broadcast television, with four episodes per disc, and a fifth disc full of special features - deleted scenes, contestant profiles, extended auditions of each contestant, making-of documentaries, Trump-isms, a condensed version of the entire season, a preview of ""The Apprentice 2"" featuring the 18 new contestants, even advice for the newbies from the old contestants. Virtually everything you could want as far as DVD special features are concerned, except for audio commentaries. Those might have been nice for maybe the pilot and the finale, but then again - I almost never listen to them, anyway.It's an entertaining show, and it's a well thought out, full-featured DVD.

830858,AI37X1O7K72FZ,B0002CX1WA,Anti-Hipster,"[1, 1]","It's amazing what Donald Trump let Kwame Jackson, the Apprentice season 1 runner-up, get away with. As project manager, he lost two times. After one loss, he told Trump that the artwork his team had to sell was weird. I thought that Trump would fire him on the spot for saying that, since it violated one of Trump's bedrock principles, which is not to sell a product you don't believe in (Kwame could have chosen to sell another artist's work). Instead, Trump played Monday morning quarterback on Kwame's behalf, telling him ""I think you've learned your lesson."" If Kwame had made a miscalculation like that on the job, it would have cost Trump money. Normally, Trump would scold a candidate for this, but not here: Trump just let him go. In his other loss, Kwame pretended to be a basketball player while Bill Rancic basically ran the show from inside a Planet Hollywood restaurant. It was an act of desperation on Kwame's part, and borderline fraudulent to boot. Again, Trump let Kwame get away with it.Trump either had a naive faith in Kwame's potential, or Kwame was an Affirmative Action candidate whose blackness gave him a free ride to the finals. There's no other explanation for Kwame's success. The CEOs who interviewed the final four candidates saw nothing special in Kwame, describing him as low key and unexceptional. Their impressions of Kwame, however, didn't seem to rub off on Trump because he selected Kwame to compete in the final task against Bill. Kwame blew the final task before it was even underway by choosing Omarosa to be on his team. Omarosa proved to be an incompetent and combative player, as Kwame could vouch for, having witnessed her mishaps first-hand as a teammate. Kwame's poor judgment call paid off when Omarosa sabotaged him by lying about a phone call she had received at a restaurant. Omarosa was given information about the entertainer slated to appear at Trump's casino, but she ignored it, which caused some confusion. When Trump landed at his casino to observe Kwame's progress, Kwame was nowhere to be seen. He clearly blew the task. Still, I wasn't so sure Bill had it in the bag, despite owning every task he had overseen, including the final task. A moment before Trump chose his apprentice, he consulted with his two boardroom confidants, George Ross and Carolyn Kepcher. Ross, to my astonishment, said he'd pick Kwame to be Trump's apprentice. Did Ross confuse Kwame for Bill, or did he just pick Kwame to preserve some suspense (since Bill, by any objective measure, was the front-runner)? Kepcher, when asked who she'd pick, chose Bill. I believe this was orchestrated by the show's producers to generate suspense. How could Ross ignore Kwame's constant screw-ups and Bill's flawless performance?If Trump hadn't made his decision to hire Bill at least two episodes in advance of the final task, then he was a fool. Who else besides Amy could Trump have entrusted to oversee one of his construction projects? Choosing Kwame would have sent a bad message to viewers: you can be a mediocre screw-up and still get a job with Trump's company. So why then did Trump keep Kwame around for so long? The only thing I can think of is that Trump wanted to avoid accusations of racism. If Trump had fired Kwame early on, liberal commentators would have complained that the show's cast was ""too white"" and used it as circumstantial evidence of Trump's racism. That the show's only two black candidates were manifestly unqualified means nothing to these commentators; all that matters to them is the racial balance of the show.",4,Trump cut Kwame too much slack,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,3566,"['amazing', 'what', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'let', 'Kwame', 'Jackson', 'Apprentice', 'season', '1', 'runner-up', 'get', 'away', 'project', 'manager', 'lost', 'two', 'times', 'one', 'loss', 'told', 'Trump', 'artwork', 'team', 'had', 'sell', 'was', 'weird', 'thought', 'Trump', 'would', 'fire', 'spot', 'saying', 'violated', 'one', 'Trump', 'bedrock', 'principles', 'not', 'sell', 'product', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Kwame', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'sell', 'artist', 'work', 'Instead', 'Trump', 'played', 'Monday', 'morning', 'quarterback', 'Kwame', 'behalf', 'telling', 'think', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'lesson', 'Kwame', 'had', 'made', 'miscalculation', 'job', 'would', 'have', 'cost', 'Trump', 'money', 'Normally', 'Trump', 'would', 'scold', 'candidate', 'not', 'here', 'Trump', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'other', 'loss', 'Kwame', 'pretended', 'be', 'basketball', 'player', 'Bill', 'Rancic', 'basically', 'ran', 'show', 'Planet', 'Hollywood', 'restaurant', 'was', 'act', 'desperation', 'Kwame', 'part', 'borderline', 'fraudulent', 'boot', 'Again', 'Trump', 'let', 'Kwame', 'get', 'away', 'it.Trump', 'had', 'naive', 'faith', 'Kwame', 'potential', 'Kwame', 'was', 'Affirmative', 'Action', 'candidate', 'blackness', 'gave', 'free', 'ride', 'finals', 'other', 'explanation', 'Kwame', 'success', 'CEOs', 'who', 'interviewed', 'final', 'four', 'candidates', 'saw', 'nothing', 'special', 'Kwame', 'describing', 'low', 'key', 'unexceptional', 'impressions', 'Kwame', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'rub', 'off', 'Trump', 'selected', 'Kwame', 'compete', 'final', 'task', 'Bill', 'Kwame', 'blew', 'final', 'task', 'was', 'even', 'underway', 'choosing', 'Omarosa', 'be', 'team', 'Omarosa', 'proved', 'be', 'incompetent', 'combative', 'player', 'Kwame', 'could', 'vouch', 'having', 'witnessed', 'mishaps', 'first-hand', 'teammate', 'Kwame', 'poor', 'judgment', 'call', 'paid', 'off', 'when', 'Omarosa', 'sabotaged', 'lying', 'phone', 'call', 'had', 'received', 'restaurant', 'Omarosa', 'was', 'given', 'information', 'entertainer', 'slated', 'appear', 'Trump', 'casino', 'ignored', 'caused', 'confusion', 'When', 'Trump', 'landed', 'casino', 'observe', 'Kwame', 'progress', 'Kwame', 'was', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'clearly', 'blew', 'task', 'Still', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure', 'Bill', 'had', 'bag', 'owning', 'task', 'had', 'overseen', 'including', 'final', 'task', 'moment', 'Trump', 'chose', 'apprentice', 'consulted', 'two', 'boardroom', 'confidants', 'George', 'Ross', 'Carolyn', 'Kepcher', 'Ross', 'astonishment', 'said', ""'d"", 'pick', 'Kwame', 'be', 'Trump', 'apprentice', 'Did', 'Ross', 'confuse', 'Kwame', 'Bill', 'did', 'just', 'pick', 'Kwame', 'preserve', 'suspense', 'Bill', 'objective', 'measure', 'was', 'front-runner', 'Kepcher', 'when', 'asked', 'who', ""'d"", 'pick', 'chose', 'Bill', 'believe', 'was', 'orchestrated', 'show', 'producers', 'generate', 'suspense', 'How', 'could', 'Ross', 'ignore', 'Kwame', 'constant', 'screw-ups', 'Bill', 'flawless', 'performance', 'Trump', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'decision', 'hire', 'Bill', 'least', 'two', 'episodes', 'advance', 'final', 'task', 'then', 'was', 'fool', 'Who', 'else', 'Amy', 'could', 'Trump', 'have', 'entrusted', 'oversee', 'one', 'construction', 'projects', 'Choosing', 'Kwame', 'would', 'have', 'sent', 'bad', 'message', 'viewers', 'can', 'be', 'mediocre', 'screw-up', 'still', 'get', 'job', 'Trump', 'company', 'So', 'why', 'then', 'did', 'Trump', 'keep', 'Kwame', 'so', 'long', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'Trump', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'accusations', 'racism', 'Trump', 'had', 'fired', 'Kwame', 'early', 'liberal', 'commentators', 'would', 'have', 'complained', 'show', 'cast', 'was', 'too', 'white', 'used', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'Trump', 'racism', 'show', 'only', 'two', 'black', 'candidates', 'were', 'manifestly', 'unqualified', 'nothing', 'commentators', 'matters', 'racial', 'balance', 'show']",N/A

And I was overwhelmed. You could show portions of the series in a non-Harvard MBA classroom.The show's premise has been described so often I won't summarize here. As Bill Rancic observes in his book, there's not much reality here.  Tasks bear only faint resemblance to real-world business challenges faced by senior executives.  Extra pressures arise from the group's living arrangement: a loft on Tiffany Corner, 5th Avenue and 57th Street, where participants sleep in cubicles, ""on top of each other."" Well, says Trump,  a tiny apartment at that location might rent for $12,000 a month. He should know!Besides the survivor-type drama, we get a rare glimpse into Trump's world, as he shows off his apartment, fleet of aircraft, estates and companies.  He comes across as likeable, even ""funny,"" as one fired contestant says, showing annoyance only once in the entire series, during a mix-up in the very last episode.So can we learn business lessons from the show?  In many ways, yes. Above all, what's important is conducting yourself professionally and never losing your cool.  Participants must cooperate to win as a team, yet ultimately their teammates are also their competitors.  In corporate America, you get ahead by supporting your boss. Here, a savvy team can undermine a leader who's a potential strong competitor or a despised colleague, getting that leader fired.Trump also encourages players to think outside the box.  He is quick to fire those who won't stand up for themselves or who are squeamish about critiquing their colleagues.  One woman got fired because she held back instead of ""fighting for her life.""  Feisty is good. But these values are hardly universal.  Trump has created not only a company, but also a culture.  Other companies may expect executives to stay in the box and be quiet.Are these really the best and the brightest? Watching contestants fumbling around, it's easy to question the selection process. But we have to remember these folks are fish out of water. They're jammed into tight spaces, sharing quarters boot camp style.  They've presumably signed releases, allowing photographers to film them sleeping, brushing their teeth or answering a phone in their underwear.Some contestants no doubt have trouble relaxing and sleeping in those conditions. And the pace is relentless.  As Rancic says in the bonus material, some people just got tired.  Stamina, motivation and perseverance lagged. Romance was hard to manage, although one couple came close. (I think Omerosa and Kwame had some chemistry, especially evident in a deleted scene shown on DVD and suggested by his decision to select her for a critical task.  But nobody comments so maybe I shouldn't either!)Candidates were young and many were at a crossroads: newly divorced, restless, and/or facing career challenges.  They were a special group in many ways - some special to the point of quirkiness, but that's another story.Having read Bill Rancic's book first, I watched for signs of greatness. Bill did not stand out in the first few rounds - when some obvious misfits were culled quickly - but found some effective out-of-the-box strategies that dazzled Trump. Additionally, Bill was poised, professional, articulate and good-looking. A no-brainer.The real winners were those who followed the strategy Kwame describes in the bonus material. He saw the show as a platform for a new company and a new career.  Based on media reports, all have received great job offers or seen their businesses expand. One candidate managed to use the platform to display her worst qualities - but you can decide for yourself.As an expatriate New Yorker myself, I was drawn to the last scene of each episode, when the fired participants find a cab idling right at the curb, presumably equipped with a video cam to record their last thoughts.  Just having a cab at your beck and call can be a luxury, but I wondered more.  Where do they go? Does Trump buy them last-minute airplane tickets?  Fly them home in his private jet? Stash them in the Trump Plaza hotel? Well, maybe we'll find out someday.",5,Entertaining Supplement to Business School,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,4200,"['Several', 'people', 'warned', 'career', 'consultant', 'need', 'watch', 'show', 'So', 'when', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'could', 'show', 'portions', 'series', 'non-Harvard', 'MBA', 'classroom.The', 'show', 'premise', 'been', 'described', 'so', 'often', 'wo', ""n't"", 'summarize', 'here', 'Bill', 'Rancic', 'book', 'not', 'much', 'reality', 'here', 'Tasks', 'only', 'faint', 'resemblance', 'real-world', 'business', 'challenges', 'faced', 'senior', 'executives', 'Extra', 'pressures', 'arise', 'group', 'living', 'arrangement', 'loft', 'Tiffany', 'Corner', '5th', 'Avenue', '57th', 'Street', 'where', 'participants', 'sleep', 'cubicles', 'top', 'other', 'Well', 'Trump', 'tiny', 'apartment', 'location', 'might', 'rent', '12,000', 'month', 'should', 'know', 'survivor-type', 'drama', 'get', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'Trump', 'world', 'apartment', 'fleet', 'aircraft', 'estates', 'companies', 'likeable', 'even', 'funny', 'one', 'fired', 'contestant', 'showing', 'annoyance', 'only', 'once', 'entire', 'series', 'mix-up', 'very', 'last', 'episode.So', 'can', 'learn', 'business', 'lessons', 'show', 'many', 'ways', 'yes', 'what', 'important', 'conducting', 'professionally', 'never', 'losing', 'cool', 'Participants', 'must', 'cooperate', 'win', 'team', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'teammates', 'are', 'also', 'competitors', 'corporate', 'America', 'get', 'ahead', 'supporting', 'boss', 'Here', 'savvy', 'team', 'can', 'undermine', 'leader', 'who', 'potential', 'strong', 'competitor', 'despised', 'colleague', 'getting', 'leader', 'fired.Trump', 'also', 'players', 'think', 'box', 'quick', 'fire', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'who', 'are', 'squeamish', 'critiquing', 'colleagues', 'One', 'woman', 'got', 'fired', 'held', 'back', 'instead', 'fighting', 'life', 'Feisty', 'good', 'values', 'are', 'hardly', 'universal', 'Trump', 'created', 'not', 'only', 'company', 'also', 'culture', 'Other', 'companies', 'may', 'expect', 'executives', 'stay', 'box', 'be', 'quiet.Are', 'really', 'best', 'brightest', 'Watching', 'contestants', 'fumbling', 'around', 'easy', 'question', 'selection', 'process', 'have', 'remember', 'folks', 'are', 'fish', 'water', ""'re"", 'jammed', 'tight', 'spaces', 'sharing', 'quarters', 'boot', 'camp', 'style', ""'ve"", 'presumably', 'signed', 'releases', 'allowing', 'photographers', 'film', 'sleeping', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'answering', 'phone', 'underwear.Some', 'contestants', 'doubt', 'have', 'trouble', 'relaxing', 'sleeping', 'conditions', 'pace', 'relentless', 'Rancic', 'bonus', 'material', 'people', 'just', 'got', 'tired', 'Stamina', 'motivation', 'perseverance', 'lagged', 'Romance', 'was', 'hard', 'manage', 'one', 'couple', 'came', 'close', 'think', 'Omerosa', 'Kwame', 'had', 'chemistry', 'especially', 'evident', 'deleted', 'scene', 'shown', 'DVD', 'suggested', 'decision', 'select', 'critical', 'task', 'nobody', 'comments', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'either', 'Candidates', 'were', 'young', 'many', 'were', 'crossroads', 'newly', 'divorced', 'restless', 'and/or', 'facing', 'career', 'challenges', 'were', 'special', 'group', 'many', 'ways', 'special', 'point', 'quirkiness', 'story.Having', 'read', 'Bill', 'Rancic', 'book', 'first', 'watched', 'signs', 'greatness', 'Bill', 'did', 'not', 'stand', 'out', 'first', 'few', 'rounds', 'when', 'obvious', 'misfits', 'were', 'culled', 'quickly', 'found', 'effective', 'out-of-the-box', 'strategies', 'dazzled', 'Trump', 'Additionally', 'Bill', 'was', 'poised', 'professional', 'articulate', 'good-looking', 'no-brainer.The', 'real', 'winners', 'were', 'who', 'followed', 'strategy', 'Kwame', 'bonus', 'material', 'saw', 'show', 'platform', 'new', 'company', 'new', 'career', 'Based', 'media', 'reports', 'have', 'received', 'great', 'job', 'offers', 'seen', 'businesses', 'expand', 'One', 'candidate', 'managed', 'use', 'platform', 'display', 'worst', 'qualities', 'can', 'decide', 'yourself.As', 'expatriate', 'New', 'Yorker', 'was', 'drawn', 'last', 'scene', 'episode', 'when', 'fired', 'participants', 'find', 'cab', 'idling', 'right', 'curb', 'presumably', 'equipped', 'video', 'cam', 'record', 'last', 'thoughts', 'Just', 'having', 'cab', 'beck', 'call', 'can', 'be', 'luxury', 'wondered', 'more', 'Where', 'do', 'go', 'Does', 'Trump', 'buy', 'last-minute', 'airplane', 'tickets', 'Fly', 'home', 'private', 'jet', 'Stash', 'Trump', 'Plaza', 'hotel', 'Well', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'someday']",N/A

I have not seen any episode from season 1 but I can tell you just by watching season 2 this show is awesome. I started watching when they did an episode on the new realease of star wars episode 3 dvd. In the show they have to create a project usally promoting something in some way. The first episode that i saw was when they had to create a poster for the new realease on the star wars episode 3 dvd. After that I was hooked into the ecitement of who would survive to be the apprenntice. I even on thanksgiving got to see what I missed because they had an episode were they showed what had happened all through the season. So what I would suggest is watching the apprentice thursdays on cahnnel 21 for cable and if you just have basic cable you can still check it out on the 21 news channel at 9:00.

So when i seen the complete season on dvd i took a chance and bought it. That was a very good decision. This show is very addictive. I watched the complete series in two days. You will most likely do the same. The idea for the show is genius. Put together 16 very different personalities. Make them live together, work together, and compete against each other all at the same time. They would have to use strategy, there knowledge, education, experience, and street smarts to impress one of the richest guys in the world, Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a very likable character, but the candidates are what make the show. You will enjoy watching Sam, a very weird, psycho, crazy guy. Omarosa and Tammy, both characters that you will love to hate. The very feisty and funny Heidi. Troy, Kwame, and Bill are really great guys that you will love to watch. Even see a possible romance between Amy and Nick. (Or is that just there strategy?) The cast will work together in 2 teams and handle different business related projects to see who is most effective in making money. The losing team will have to go to the board room and put up a fight for there life to survive Donald Trump, and hope the words, ""You're fired"", is not directed to them. The last man or woman standing will get the dream job of a lifetime, working for Donald, and making some serious cash. Not only is this show entertaining, but you pick up alot of helpful information about business. Sounds kinda corny but i feel i would be a better manager and sales person just from watching this show. Each mission will show you what approach is effective, and also what NOT to do to close a sale or be a good leader.

830875,AAXIW3SRA0S4R,B0002CX1WA,"Laura De Giorgio ""hypnotherapist""","[0, 0]","The objective of this series is to select a person - out of 16 candidates -  who would be most suitable to become the apprentice and work for a year as a CEO for one of Donald Trump's companies.  Half of the candidates are male, half female, some have one or two university degrees, others only a high school diploma, some are already running successful businesses, while others have barely left the school.The candidates are divided in two teams who are given a new project to work on each week.  The winning team - team that generates greater profit wins and from the losing team one person gets fired.  Each episode ends with an important point that contributes to one's success in a business world.  Many of those points successful people would consider to be common sense, but in spite of education and previous successes of the candidates picked for this series, many seem not to be aware of what would be truly basics.  For example, in sales or in advertising it is a common sense to focus on the benefits for the client, so I was surprised when I heard people who are professional salesmen trying to sell stuff in this series by practically begging for sales saying things like ""please buy this because I need money"".Initially the groups were divided in men against women, and women were winning, partly on playfulness and creativity and perhaps even more so by pushing their sexual appeal.  It's true that sex sells and sex appeal works up to a certain point.  People who look beautiful, appealing, sexy, charismatic may have it easier up to some point and in certain circumstances, but it is not enough for running big business, so as the male group got decimated in half and the groups were reshuffled, with each group having 2 men and six women, women slowly began to fall off.  In general their main weakness seemed to be that they were getting too emotional, over-dramatic and at times hysterical - instead of focusing on business issues, they'd get wrapped in personal issues. When it comes to managing and leading other people, it helps if the leader is able first to manage his own inner states.  If an aspiring leader is emotionally falling apart, and is unable to manage him or herself, how is he/she going to lead anyone?Based on the candidates picked for this series, it seems to me that many are picked to demonstrate what will never work.  There are countless self-help programs that tell people ""you can be all you want to be if you just set your mind on it"", but here it was obvious that people have different traits and personalities and some are naturally more suitable to be leaders and others will not make it as leaders no matter what they do.  One can get education and one can get experience, but the person that comes across as a fruit cake is not going to get far.It was also obvious that there is a perfect place under the sun for each one of us - some are better suited to run their own business, some are better suited to work for someone else in some capacity and yet others are suitable to work for large organizations and govern business and people they are in charge of.  I think that this series helps viewers to assess their own strengths and weaknesses, their own talents and abilities and to work on with what they've got.There were very few people in this series who seemed to have decent communication, negotiation and inter-personal skills and it seems most people could work on improving them.  Many people in this series were deluding themselves, believing that they have the skills and traits which they do not have and thinking that if they scream louder they will convince others that indeed they have them, whereas their behavior spoke quite differently.And in spite of their weaknesses and being truly unsuitable for the CEO position, many of the candidates in this series had their own talents and abilities that could be used effectively in other positions and in other kinds of work.  Some of them do seem better suited being self-employed and running their own businesses.All in all I have gain many new insights from watching these series and do highly recommend it to anyone interesting in running any kind of business.",5,A good overview of some essential business skills,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,4180,"['objective', 'series', 'select', 'person', '16', 'candidates', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'suitable', 'become', 'apprentice', 'work', 'year', 'CEO', 'one', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'companies', 'Half', 'candidates', 'are', 'male', 'half', 'female', 'have', 'one', 'two', 'university', 'degrees', 'others', 'only', 'high', 'school', 'diploma', 'are', 'already', 'running', 'successful', 'businesses', 'others', 'have', 'barely', 'left', 'school.The', 'candidates', 'are', 'divided', 'two', 'teams', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'new', 'project', 'work', 'week', 'winning', 'team', 'team', 'greater', 'profit', 'wins', 'losing', 'team', 'one', 'person', 'fired', 'episode', 'important', 'point', 'one', 'success', 'business', 'world', 'Many', 'points', 'successful', 'people', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'common', 'sense', 'spite', 'education', 'previous', 'successes', 'candidates', 'picked', 'series', 'many', 'seem', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'truly', 'basics', 'example', 'sales', 'advertising', 'common', 'sense', 'focus', 'benefits', 'client', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'heard', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'professional', 'salesmen', 'trying', 'sell', 'stuff', 'series', 'practically', 'begging', 'sales', 'saying', 'things', 'please', 'buy', 'need', 'money', '.Initially', 'groups', 'were', 'divided', 'men', 'women', 'women', 'were', 'winning', 'partly', 'playfulness', 'creativity', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'pushing', 'sexual', 'appeal', 'true', 'sex', 'sex', 'appeal', 'up', 'certain', 'point', 'People', 'who', 'look', 'beautiful', 'appealing', 'sexy', 'charismatic', 'may', 'have', 'easier', 'up', 'point', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'not', 'enough', 'running', 'big', 'business', 'so', 'male', 'group', 'got', 'decimated', 'half', 'groups', 'were', 'reshuffled', 'group', 'having', '2', 'men', 'six', 'women', 'women', 'slowly', 'began', 'fall', 'off', 'general', 'main', 'weakness', 'seemed', 'be', 'were', 'getting', 'too', 'emotional', 'over-dramatic', 'times', 'hysterical', 'instead', 'focusing', 'business', 'issues', ""'d"", 'get', 'wrapped', 'personal', 'issues', 'When', 'managing', 'leading', 'other', 'people', 'leader', 'able', 'first', 'manage', 'own', 'inner', 'states', 'aspiring', 'leader', 'emotionally', 'falling', 'apart', 'unable', 'manage', 'how', 'he/she', 'going', 'lead', 'anyone', 'Based', 'candidates', 'picked', 'series', 'many', 'are', 'picked', 'demonstrate', 'what', 'will', 'never', 'work', 'are', 'countless', 'self-help', 'programs', 'tell', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'want', 'be', 'just', 'set', 'mind', 'here', 'was', 'obvious', 'people', 'have', 'different', 'traits', 'personalities', 'are', 'naturally', 'more', 'suitable', 'be', 'leaders', 'others', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'leaders', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'One', 'can', 'get', 'education', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'experience', 'person', 'across', 'fruit', 'cake', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'far.It', 'was', 'also', 'obvious', 'perfect', 'place', 'sun', 'one', 'are', 'better', 'suited', 'run', 'own', 'business', 'are', 'better', 'suited', 'work', 'someone', 'else', 'capacity', 'yet', 'others', 'are', 'suitable', 'work', 'large', 'organizations', 'govern', 'business', 'people', 'are', 'charge', 'think', 'series', 'viewers', 'assess', 'own', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'own', 'talents', 'abilities', 'work', 'what', ""'ve"", 'were', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'series', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'decent', 'communication', 'negotiation', 'inter-personal', 'skills', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'work', 'improving', 'Many', 'people', 'series', 'were', 'deluding', 'believing', 'have', 'skills', 'traits', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'thinking', 'scream', 'louder', 'will', 'convince', 'others', 'indeed', 'have', 'whereas', 'behavior', 'spoke', 'quite', 'differently.And', 'spite', 'weaknesses', 'being', 'truly', 'unsuitable', 'CEO', 'position', 'many', 'candidates', 'series', 'had', 'own', 'talents', 'abilities', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'effectively', 'other', 'positions', 'other', 'kinds', 'work', 'do', 'seem', 'better', 'suited', 'being', 'self-employed', 'running', 'own', 'businesses.All', 'have', 'gain', 'many', 'new', 'insights', 'watching', 'series', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interesting', 'running', 'kind', 'business']",N/A

You know what it is about: participants from all over the US come to New York to try and become Mr Trump's apprentice. In order to succeed they must perform every week a new task. Some of these tasks are unfortunately somewhat ridiculous and some are challenging. Every week somebody is eliminated. What is the most surprising is that Mr Trump does not try to come across as sympathetic or especially nice (which is a sign that he is indeed bright). The programme is actually really interesting aven if not that well done. Some of the participants tend to be somewhat over the top. However the really great stuff is the interaction between the participants and how they actually interact during and after the tasks. The assessments by the judges are sometimes simplistic and the participants' reactions to being fired somewhat too obvious but it is a really great show.

And it doesn't help that Donald Trump in numerous interviews keep on saying things that are unbelievably arrogant and not to mention information that are inaccurate (according to him his salary should be the salary of all the Friends cast combined). The series may be addictive and entertaining but it is still in the guilty pleasure realm. In my opinion only The Amazing Race (so far) deserves a separate category in the wealth of reality programs we have right now.********Possible Spoiler**********The concept on paper might be really good, but putting it to life wasn't as successful as it was probably intended at least in terms of quality. Part of the weakness of the concept of the show is the fact that the winner in the show is determined ultimately by Mr. Trump, so even if you win all those tasks, your win is not guaranteed (Aheem  Amy! Ahemm). In an interview Donald Trump said he knew all along that he would pick Bill as the winner. If that was the case then a stretched out whole season series would've been pointless. Another rant is some of the tasks they do on the show, they have nothing to do with the position the candidates are applying for. Are the producers over stretching the concept that selling lemonade is the same as selling insurance policies?Some of the controversial players were the overly enthusiastic Sam, the evil of evils Omarosa, and the classless Heidi (according to Omarosa). Highlights of each episode are the boardroom scenes (Ereka and Nick's one on one was memorable as well as all of Omarosa's dramatics in the boardroom). It's an entertaining series that has its appeal. But do not subscribe to Trump's delusion that this is a smart show that should be watched by those want to be successful in the workplace.
