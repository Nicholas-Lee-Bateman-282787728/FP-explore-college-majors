It was tossed into the children's section by some ignorant person who assumed all animation is ""Kidie stuff"". Well, what I saw was DEFINITELY not for little kids. Don't get me wrong, Cyber City is definitely a well done and action-packed anime. The plot is interesting, the characters are pretty cool (Sengoku and Ben-ten being my faves and Gogul is a nice touch, looking like a big dumb thug but really being the brainy guy...never saw that one comming!), but there is a lot of corse language used throughout the series and plenty of blood and dismemberment to go around. I would definitely not recomend it for anyone who is easily offended by such things or who is under the age of 15 or 16. But, if you like a heaping helping of butt kicking action and sci-fi, cyber punk series, then I suggest you rent it if you can find it. It's a real gem of R-rated anime goodness!",5,Definitely not for the kidies...,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,943,"['saw', 'anime', 'first', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'library', 'one', 'weekend', 'was', 'tossed', 'children', 'section', 'ignorant', 'person', 'who', 'assumed', 'animation', 'Kidie', 'stuff', 'Well', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'DEFINITELY', 'not', 'little', 'kids', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Cyber', 'City', 'definitely', 'well', 'done', 'action-packed', 'anime', 'plot', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Sengoku', 'Ben-ten', 'being', 'faves', 'Gogul', 'nice', 'touch', 'looking', 'big', 'dumb', 'thug', 'really', 'being', 'brainy', 'guy', 'never', 'saw', 'one', 'comming', 'lot', 'corse', 'language', 'used', 'series', 'plenty', 'blood', 'dismemberment', 'go', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recomend', 'anyone', 'who', 'easily', 'offended', 'such', 'things', 'who', 'age', '15', '16', 'like', 'heaping', 'helping', 'butt', 'kicking', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'cyber', 'punk', 'series', 'then', 'suggest', 'rent', 'can', 'find', 'real', 'gem', 'R-rated', 'anime', 'goodness']",N/A

The storyline is weak and boring. The writers must have known that because to cover up how boring it is they threw in hundreds of profanities. These people swear in every sentence they speak. If you're a kid, make sure you turn the volume down so mom doesn't hear it. If you're a parent, don't buy this for your kid. There are so many fantastic anime movies out there. Please don't waste your time with this one.

501998,A3AC06983NMGET,B00000I1SF,Peter murphy,"[7, 7]",The cyber city collection is one of the finest anime's ever produced. It combines exellent voice talents with high action stories that are related by the three main convicts in the manga. The story centres around the city  of oedo 808 having to hire notorious criminals to serve as cyber police  men. However if they fail a mission they are executed by means of a collar  around their neck. Naturally the three are less concerned with public order  than they are with trying to subvert the justice system. This anime  contains a great deal of swearing and violence and a soundtrack that  perfectly suits the Matrix style plots. Overall it makes an exellent  purchase especially as the DVD format makes the visuals and sound that much  better.,5,the best short sci-fi anime ever?,944524800,"12 7, 1999",1999,742,"['cyber', 'city', 'collection', 'one', 'finest', 'anime', 'ever', 'produced', 'exellent', 'voice', 'talents', 'high', 'action', 'stories', 'are', 'related', 'three', 'main', 'convicts', 'manga', 'story', 'city', '808', 'having', 'hire', 'notorious', 'criminals', 'serve', 'cyber', 'police', 'men', 'However', 'fail', 'mission', 'are', 'executed', 'means', 'collar', 'neck', 'Naturally', 'three', 'are', 'less', 'concerned', 'public', 'order', 'are', 'trying', 'subvert', 'justice', 'system', 'anime', 'great', 'deal', 'swearing', 'violence', 'soundtrack', 'perfectly', 'suits', 'Matrix', 'style', 'plots', 'Overall', 'exellent', 'purchase', 'especially', 'DVD', 'format', 'visuals', 'sound', 'much', 'better']",N/A
