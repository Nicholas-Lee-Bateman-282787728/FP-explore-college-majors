Simms ""Bevpianolady""","[8, 8]","I was an avid step aerobic addict for many years, but a series of bad repetitive-motion injuries forced me to stop just about all types of exercise except walking.  I prefer to walk outside, but in Indiana this is often a problem in the winter.  After trying Leslie Samsone's AND Prevention's walking videos, all of which had too much marching in them, I had high hopes for this one.  Although I like the scenery a lot, and do prefer Debbie Rocker's personality, this video is disappointing in two significant ways.  First, there is TOO MUCH MARCHING IN PLACE!!  I do not understand why these instructors use marching as a warm-up or a place for supposed rest or cool-down, when actually marching in place is very difficult for anyone with repetitive-motion injuries!!!  The movements that are actually less stressful to the joints are the step-tap types that are used elsewhere in the video.  During the marching segments, I substitute step-tap type movements, or just walk in time around the room.  Second, Debbie has made some very basic errors in her cueing.  She refers to ""left"" and ""right"" without realizing that for the viewer these sides are reversed.  Another annoying habit she has is to tell the viewer that we are about to change to a new step or pattern, but then take FOREVER to actually make the change.  Furthermore, there is no predictable rhythmic set-up for the change each time.  Sometime she'll give 4 beats preparation, sometimes much more.  The moves are, of course very easy, but for a seasoned instructor like Debbie, why are her instructions so sloppy?I'll probably use this video on poor-weather days until I find (hopefully) one that is better suited to my needs.",3,"Beautiful Scenery, but Pretty Dull",1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,1692,"['was', 'avid', 'step', 'aerobic', 'addict', 'many', 'years', 'series', 'bad', 'repetitive-motion', 'injuries', 'forced', 'stop', 'just', 'types', 'exercise', 'walking', 'prefer', 'walk', 'outside', 'Indiana', 'often', 'problem', 'winter', 'trying', 'Leslie', 'Samsone', 'AND', 'Prevention', 'walking', 'videos', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'marching', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'one', 'like', 'scenery', 'lot', 'do', 'prefer', 'Debbie', 'Rocker', 'personality', 'video', 'disappointing', 'two', 'significant', 'ways', 'First', 'TOO', 'MUCH', 'MARCHING', 'IN', 'PLACE', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'instructors', 'use', 'marching', 'warm-up', 'place', 'supposed', 'rest', 'cool-down', 'when', 'actually', 'marching', 'place', 'very', 'difficult', 'anyone', 'repetitive-motion', 'injuries', 'movements', 'are', 'actually', 'less', 'stressful', 'joints', 'are', 'step-tap', 'types', 'are', 'used', 'elsewhere', 'video', 'marching', 'segments', 'substitute', 'step-tap', 'type', 'movements', 'just', 'walk', 'time', 'room', 'Second', 'Debbie', 'made', 'very', 'basic', 'errors', 'cueing', 'left', 'right', 'realizing', 'viewer', 'sides', 'are', 'reversed', 'annoying', 'habit', 'tell', 'viewer', 'are', 'change', 'new', 'step', 'pattern', 'then', 'take', 'FOREVER', 'actually', 'make', 'change', 'Furthermore', 'predictable', 'rhythmic', 'set-up', 'change', 'time', 'Sometime', ""'ll"", 'give', '4', 'beats', 'preparation', 'sometimes', 'much', 'more', 'moves', 'are', 'course', 'very', 'easy', 'seasoned', 'instructor', 'Debbie', 'why', 'are', 'instructions', 'sloppy', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'use', 'video', 'poor-weather', 'days', 'find', 'hopefully', 'one', 'better', 'suited', 'needs']",A.M. and P.M.

I really enjoy Leslie Sansone's walking workouts - I also enjoy the occasional George Foreman walk, and I do like Kathy Smith's new power walk.  This one, though, was just a little ...... boring.  The AM walk is supposed to be slow, to wake you up and get you going in the morning.  Well, I need something a little less repetitive, a little less lethargic, and a lot more energetic, to get me going!  The roughly five-minute warmup was simply marching in place with absolutely no variation whatsoever while Debbie talked about how she would be your coach, etc.  I finally had to do my own thing - side steps, mambo steps, etc., just because I couldn't wait for her to do something new.  The PM walk was slightly better, but only slightly.  The scenery, however, was absolutely gorgeous - much better than the movie screen outdoor setting employed by Kathy Smith, and a nice change of pace from the indoor studio-setting walks used by both Leslie and George.",3,Cashing in on the walking craze,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,1109,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'trying', 'new', 'walking', 'workouts', 'AM', 'PM', 'Walking', 'workout', 'really', 'left', 'disappointed', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'walking', 'also', 'enjoy', 'occasional', 'George', 'Foreman', 'walk', 'do', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'new', 'power', 'walk', 'one', 'though', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'boring', 'AM', 'walk', 'supposed', 'be', 'slow', 'wake', 'up', 'get', 'going', 'morning', 'Well', 'need', 'something', 'little', 'less', 'repetitive', 'little', 'less', 'lethargic', 'lot', 'more', 'energetic', 'get', 'going', 'roughly', 'five-minute', 'warmup', 'was', 'simply', 'marching', 'place', 'absolutely', 'variation', 'whatsoever', 'Debbie', 'talked', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'coach', 'etc', 'finally', 'had', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'side', 'steps', 'mambo', 'steps', 'etc.', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'do', 'something', 'new', 'PM', 'walk', 'was', 'slightly', 'better', 'only', 'slightly', 'scenery', 'however', 'was', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'screen', 'outdoor', 'setting', 'employed', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'indoor', 'studio-setting', 'walks', 'used', 'Leslie', 'George']",A.M. and P.M.
