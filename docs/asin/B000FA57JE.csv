986681,A3C5SZ4DMF0FDP,B000FA57JE,"Ruth Ann Nordin ""Historical Romance Author""","[2, 2]","I enjoy Tyler Perry but this was my favorite play!  Perry is a writer after my own heart.  He manages to show how good sexuality is in marriage, which is hard to find in the Christian movies or books I'm used to reading.  His work is refreshing and entertaining.  In this particular play, he does an excellent job in combining humor into serious subject matter.  It's focus is on an unfaithful spouse who ends up leaving his wife for a thin and ""prettier"" woman (who happens to be a friend of the wife's).  The husband's treatment of his wife is a powerful description of verbal abuse, and I felt horrible for the wife, which was the point.The second half of the play covered the next year at the cabin, and I had hoped the now ex-wife would be happier and the way Perry dragged that part out had me on the edge of my seat because I feared that she didn't end up with the man I hoped she would.  I don't want to ruin it but it is the best scene in the play and I found myself cheering when I discovered who her new love was.  By the audience's cheers, I wasn't alone in my joy.

986682,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000FA57JE,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[11, 17]","Summary:  This movie is about three women: one woman who will look at anything with a bank card who refers to himself as a roughneck, a second woman who stands by her man and is willing to do almost anything to keep him regardless of how much he belittles her, and a third woman who (apparently) doesn't take any stuff and went through trials and tribulations with her husband but got through it on a positive light.  The third woman is more or less the (unasked for) advisee to the other two: one as an enemy and one as a friend.  One terrible husband, one patient, wiser husband, and one guy who's just trying to find love all mix in to make the play more interesting.  The single guy is EXTREMELY cute, I might add!Pros: Every Tyler Perry movie does not need Madea or the dirty old man he plays to be funny, and I love the way the people he chooses to work with can bring some good comedy, good singing voices, and great acting in place of it.  I like how Tyler takes controversial topics as darts and throws them right at the board, so everyone can understand what he's aiming to prove.  Topics such as weight gain in marriage, infidelity, betrayal, golddiggers, fatherhood, religion, and love all help this play relate to anyone. Even for those who aren't married, there's something to be said about being single (and vice versa).  I found the weight gain issue to be one of the most honest and relevant topics in this book, not only because women do tend to gain weight over the years, but because many men do not understand the issues that women go through to get it off.  I've heard MANY smart remarks from guys (strangers, family, friends) throughout the years about heavyset women, and even had a couple thrown my way when I gained weight a couple years back. I'm a carb lover and a vegetarian so my weight goes up and down all the time, but it's immediately noticeable who's a jerk about it and who sympathizes when it goes up.  One thing I hope all in the audience and all those at home who watch it get from this is TEASING is NOT HELPING.  No one (man or woman) can lose weight with you picking on them; they will do it in their own time for their own benefit and someone nagging them to death about it is not going to work.  I found it interesting that one couple got through infidelity and made the relationship work. Although I don't necessarily agree with that, I come from a different generation that runs when the going gets tough, even though it's nice to see those that don't.  I was very impressed when the older man who played the father started singing. Man, he's got a voice!  He hit that high note and I looked around to see was it really him.  Wow!  I enjoyed the ending and all received there just dues.Cons:  I was a little confused why the feisty main female character was cast in the role she was in.  There was constant dialogue comparing her and the more vulnerable character in regards to weight, but both were heavyset.  The guys had a conversation and one said ""Look at your wife, and look at mine"" so I was wondering was the feistier character an understudy and the original actress didn't show up...or what?  I thought the plot would've been stronger if the husband would've said that he embraced his wife's weight INSTEAD of making it sound like she was a size 6.  It just seemed rather odd to me.  Not being disrespectful, but it was something that was obvious when watching the movie and I didn't get why the dialogue was put there in regards to that character.  I was genuinely shocked to find out that Pepsi, the more sensitive woman, was wearing a bodysuit. I thought that was her real weight.I loved the older guy, but him kicking his leg back for the fourth or fifth time got old.  He was wearing that joke into the ground.  I don't know who passes out wigs, but man, every Tyler Perry play has some woman with a bad wig on.
