1653822,AGYIRZJQZHED9,B00D6I7DHG,Elizabeth S,"[1, 2]","Christian movies are usually known for their wonderful message but low budget movies.Well, I am hear to tell you that Pure Flix has done a great job of changing that stereotype about Christian movies.Revelation Road 2, like the first one of this series shares the gospel in a very compelling way.  And it does it in a story that draws you in, involves you in the character's plights in a way that will leave you on the edge of your seat.  And has a surreal quality that will entice you throughout the whole movieDavid A.R. White as the character Josh, does an excellent job of portraying a character that is beat down by his choices in life and even though he does not know it, is looking for answers.  He takes a truly unfeeling character and gives it life.  this is one of David A.R. White's best performances,and that is saying something, because he does a really great job in The Moment After II.And you will just love the character Elizabeth!  Noell Coet is so good in this part, that you cannot imagine anyone else playing Elizabeth.  Her portrayal is spot on brilliant.Ray Wise is perfect as the character that shares the gospel with Josh.  And as always, Eric Roberts does such a wonderful job in these Pure Flix Christian movies.  he adds the perfect touch to any cast lineup.  Andrea Logan White and Brian Bosworth (yes, the football player) play a very realistic dysfunctional family.  Their enmity is so well done, and their conflict takes twists and turns that have to be watched from the 1st Revelation Road movie.And you can't leave out the portrayal of Jesus (The Stranger), done by the incomparable Bruce Marchiano.  Bruce Marchiano plays many cameos/parts in Pure Flix movies as Jesus.  He does the best job of portraying how the Bible shows us Jesus as loving, caring, compassionate and honest,  I have never seen another actor who does a better job of getting the whole character of Jesus across in a film.I have to say, that overall, Revelation Road 2 is now one of my top favorite movies and it has to been seen with it's 1st part, to truly appreciate the message of the film.If you love Christian movies, especially Christian End Times movies, then you will not find a better film in this genre.  And if you are curious about Christian end times movies, but never really have seen any, the action is really great too, plus some really spectacular special effects.",5,Revelation Road 2,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,2386,"['Christian', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'known', 'wonderful', 'message', 'low', 'budget', 'movies.Well', 'am', 'hear', 'tell', 'Pure', 'Flix', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'changing', 'stereotype', 'Christian', 'movies.Revelation', 'Road', '2', 'first', 'one', 'series', 'shares', 'gospel', 'very', 'compelling', 'way', 'story', 'character', 'plights', 'way', 'will', 'leave', 'edge', 'seat', 'surreal', 'quality', 'will', 'entice', 'whole', 'movieDavid', 'A.R', 'White', 'character', 'Josh', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'beat', 'down', 'choices', 'life', 'even', 'not', 'know', 'looking', 'answers', 'truly', 'unfeeling', 'character', 'life', 'one', 'David', 'A.R', 'White', 'best', 'performances', 'saying', 'something', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'Moment', 'II.And', 'will', 'just', 'love', 'character', 'Elizabeth', 'Noell', 'Coet', 'so', 'good', 'part', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'Elizabeth', 'portrayal', 'spot', 'brilliant.Ray', 'Wise', 'perfect', 'character', 'shares', 'gospel', 'Josh', 'always', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Pure', 'Flix', 'Christian', 'movies', 'perfect', 'touch', 'cast', 'lineup', 'Andrea', 'Logan', 'White', 'Brian', 'Bosworth', 'yes', 'football', 'player', 'play', 'very', 'realistic', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'enmity', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'conflict', 'twists', 'turns', 'have', 'be', 'watched', '1st', 'Revelation', 'Road', 'movie.And', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'Stranger', 'done', 'incomparable', 'Bruce', 'Marchiano', 'Bruce', 'Marchiano', 'many', 'cameos/parts', 'Pure', 'Flix', 'movies', 'Jesus', 'best', 'job', 'portraying', 'how', 'Bible', 'shows', 'Jesus', 'loving', 'caring', 'compassionate', 'honest', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'actor', 'who', 'better', 'job', 'getting', 'whole', 'character', 'Jesus', 'film.I', 'have', 'say', 'overall', 'Revelation', 'Road', '2', 'now', 'one', 'top', 'favorite', 'movies', 'been', 'seen', '1st', 'part', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'message', 'film.If', 'love', 'Christian', 'movies', 'especially', 'Christian', 'End', 'Times', 'movies', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'better', 'film', 'genre', 'are', 'curious', 'Christian', 'end', 'times', 'movies', 'never', 'really', 'have', 'seen', 'action', 'really', 'great', 'too', 'really', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects']",N/A

1653832,A3VA7MACQJZPBT,B00D6I7DHG,"Kelly Blackwell - Here's My Take On It ""Kelly""","[0, 0]","I watched the first in this series, &#34;Revelation Road: The Beginning of the End&#34; a while back and absolutely loved it.  Pure Flix Entertainment is really bringing some great faith-based films to the table.  After seeing the first, I could not wait for the next...but I had to.  I waited until I could purchase the film because I didn't want to just stream it as I had the first.&#34;Revelation Road 2: Sea of Glass & Fire&#34; picks up where the first left off, and fulfills two purposes one is to give the viewer some more background on Josh with answering the question of why is he the way he is and is he aware of it?  We also get a little recap on exactly went down in the first movie and get more of an understanding on the relationship issues between the biker gang's leader Hawg and on Cat who seems so tortured through both films.  The viewer also sees how God has had a hand on their lives in a unique way for a unique purpose and even the negative parts can be used in a positive light.Generally I'd say Revelation Road 2 has a smooth running plot that gives us some steps forward with some long glances back.  As with other films like this, there are people who are reeling after an obvious rapture scenario with most not understanding what went on and still others who do get it and know full well that somehow they truly weren't the believers they thought themselves to be.  This always gives me food for thought.  The actors and actresses did a great job.  You will often find people who are a bit more canned, but not in this film.  The cast definitely took the time to really grow into character which for myself was greatly appreciated especially because I am one who is often disappointed when I see a Christian film come out with a wonderful message but the message is relayed by actors who are wooden, and everyone I try to share it with just shakes their head.  This is a film of quality with many wonderful moments.

The whole idea is tinged with violence and death. And you get lots of both here.  This is like a low budget sci fi film ,  where people burn up in light and a pile of ashes are left. Only in this case it's the rapture,  still those people are DEAD. And you have to give the filmmakers real credit for that.  After all , most rapture believers don't think they will DIE in the rapture!.  But clearly they do , in a painless way. BUt dead , is dead.  Also jesus  strangely a white man, (he was  a brown skinned man), comes and asks a girl  to DIE.  The undercurrent of the rapture movement is dependent on violence.  Jesus can't come without mass slaughter and death, even of his followers.  IN this film a assassin battles a motorcycle gang as things fall apart.  It's a good sci fi action tale, in that way.  I liked this movie and it is far from boring!.  Eric Roberts is in this one in  a small role too.  The rapture can obsess people, so that even if jesus comes back , without the rapture , these people might self destruct or worse.  If it is real, then fine.

Which to be honest -normally just the opposite is true on 99% of movies.  But to really &#34;GET&#34; and understand this one FULLY -it would be best to see the first one.This movie has drama, action, and even a SPOT of comedy (only in one spot that is).  There is some fighting but not near as much as in the first movie.  In this one alot of the PAST of the character's are explained which makes it really good.-------------This movie does have a STRONG FAITH MESSAGE.  To me it is great to see a christian movie actually have &#34;Jesus&#34; in it.  Everybody knows when someone is trying to &#34;go around the bush&#34; so to speak and not actually use the name of Jesus or be kind of a &#34;hidden message of christinity&#34;.

We get to flashback the first film and relive the Rapture again. The whole world is plunged into darkness, except where the sun is still shining, or those who have generators. Joshua (David A.R. White) our main character is traveling west with Beth (Noell Coet) and attempting to avoid the evil biker gang that carries the Hammer of Thor. We find out this was a Christian biker group at one time and that Joshua is really Jason Bourne, but no Matt Damon.Add a reading from the Gospel of Matthew, four bikers symbolizing the Four Horsemen, and a few bad bikers trying to be redeemed and you pretty much have it part 2.The acting and script is still bad, but appears to be an improvement over the first one.
