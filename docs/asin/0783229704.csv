Deanna's character is a young woman who finds herself travelling back to her country of birth after about eighteen years in China.  But there's a complication when she tries to return - make that eight complications.  She's travelling with a small group of orphans, to whom she is the only familiar anything.The movie makes the point that children are helpless victims of war, without going into graphic goriness.

62436,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0783229704,Bobby Underwood,"[17, 17]","This warm and tender drama is one of the most fondly remembered films in the career of Deanna Durbin. She never gave a lovelier performance than in this film about children orphaned in war-torn southern China and the Christian Missionary teacher who tries to save as many as she can by bringing them to America. How she does so in spite of all the obstacles in their way gives birth to a story filled with drama and humor, and even allows for some beautiful songs by Durbin within the framework of the story.One of the most moving moments in the film comes almost immediately when Ruth Kirke (Durbin) explains to the captain of the steamship they have boarded what she knows about each of the eight children and how they came to be with her. There is a warmth and sincerity in her words which are quite natural and heartfelt. We never doubt for a moment how much she cares for the children who have become her own, or how determined she will be to find them a home once in San Francisco.Barry Fitzgerald is endearing as the crusty first mate who helps her when the steamship is sunk by the Japanese, and she loses the Captain who had promised to sponsor them. He takes her to the wealthy shipping family to plead for money, which somehow ends up in Durbin having wed the much older Captain before he went down with the ship. While this may provide a home for the children in a mansion, it creates some humorous and sweet moments that make this one of Durbin's best films.Matters become even more complicated when the captain's grandson returns from sea and starts to fall for both the children and, well, his grandmother! A very young Edmond O'brien is excellent as the grandson, suspicious of Ruth's motives at first, but falling slowly under the spell of a girl who may not be able to walk in high heels, but who looks wonderful in an evening gown. There are a few more surprises awaiting viewers I don't want to spoil.Though co-director Jean Renoir and Deanna Durbin had originally intended the film to be a more focused and artistic film about the orphans of war, there are enough sweet and heartrending moments left in this Hollywood version to make the point. Universal may have fashioned what was meant to be a more substantive film from Renoir and Durbin for box office appeal, highlighting Deanna's talents, but nearly 60 years later it is hard for Durbin fans to argue with this wonderful film, one of her last big hits. The music was nominated for an Academy Award and Deanna's performance could easily have been as well.One of the last parting gifts from the Last Rose of Summer before she walked away from Hollywood forever, this is a must own for Deanna's fans, and an excellent choice for classic film fans.

62438,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,0783229704,Byron Kolln,"[5, 5]","In arguably the most unusual film in Deanna Durbin's career, THE AMAZING MRS HOLLIDAY showcases the songbird as a courageous missionary worker in Southern China who rescues a ragtag group of orphans and takes them to America.Playing Ruth Kirke, a selfless missionary teacher, Deanna Durbin found one of her most challenging and rewarding screen roles.  Ruth masquerades as the widow of Captain Holliday, who died when their cargo vessel was bombed by Japanese forces.  Home in America, Ruth is able to provide a safe and secure home for her extended family of orphans within the Holliday mansion, but when she starts having romantic overtures from her ""grandson"" (Edmond O'Brien), just how will she continue playing her alter-ego of Mrs Holliday?Originally slated to be directed by the renowned Jean Renoir, THE AMAZING MRS HOLLIDAY promised audiences an entirely different type of Deanna Durbin movie.  When it was finally released in 1943, several of Durbin's trademark musical numbers had been inserted, and producer Bruce Manning was credited as the director--Jean Renoir wasn't even mentioned.  In later years Renoir conceded that he could never have delivered the kind of movie that Deanna Durbin fans craved (""I met Deanna Durbin and liked her very much. I had all the Durbin pictures run through for me and those made by [Henry] Koster were certainly the best. However, I had no gift for that style, and THE AMAZING MRS HOLLIDAY was rightly finished by people who know the job better."").THE AMAZING MRS HOLLIDAY features Deanna Durbin's performances of ""Mighty Like a Rose"", plus a tour-de-force ""Vissi D'Arte"" from TOSCA.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","I think the world of Deanna Durbin, and I'm rating this film 4 out of 5 stars because I cannot give any of her motion pictures less than that. I am simply, unapologetically biased. But THE AMAZING MRS. HOLLIDAY, although I liked it fine, isn't one of my favorites in Durbin's cinematic collection. I dunno. Maybe it was the static extended flashbacks. Maybe it was the male lead, Edmond O'Brien, who I'm used to seeing in roles other than as a romantic lead. Or maybe her best stuff - 100 MEN AND A GIRL, MAD ABOUT MUSIC, FIRST LOVE, SPRING PARADE, IT STARTED WITH EVE, etc. - are just that exceptional.Deanna's dramatic roles were few and far between, and this is sort of one of them. I say ""sort of"" because while the narrative's prevailing tone leans towards the somber, there's room enough for the occasional screwball antic. Deanna plays Ruth Kirke, the determined 21-year-old missionary's daughter who sneaks onboard an American steamship bound for San Francisco, with eight war orphans from China in tow.When the steamship capsizes in the high seas - thanks a bunch, evil Japanese submarine! - and Ruth and her young charges arrive in San Francisco, officials from U.S. Immigration threaten to take the kids away. In desperation, Ruth poses as the dead sea captain's widow - or, more precisely, the dead Commodore's widow - and moves herself and the eight orphans into the Commodore's spacious manor on Nob Hill, and never mind those dagger glares from the Commodore's stuffy relatives. Cue then the comedic fallout to Ruth's little white lie. And cue the old Commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III (Edmond O'Brien), who saunters thru the door and becomes smitten with his 21-year-old ""grandmother."" Back in the day, this is what passes for risqu&eacute; for America's darling, never mind that Deanna is actually Canadian.THE AMAZING MRS. HOLLIDAY is a sweet, tender movie, and awfully sentimental, and, okay, it drags in places. As mentioned, one nitpick is the series of extended flashback segments. To me, they come off as filler scenes, and I pretty much fidgeted until the narrative caught up again with the present. The eight orphaned kids are across-the-board cute, especially the waddling Chinese baby (that's how the film tabs him in the end credits: ""the Chinese baby""). Never mind that the film doesn't really try to distinguish the kids from each other. The story does benefit greatly from wonderful character actors Barry Fitzgerald (as an impish old salt) and Arthur Treacher (as, what else, a gentleman's gentleman).Deanna is predictably likable and charming and full of gumption, even though THE AMAZING MRS. HOLLIDAY veers away from the giddier sensibilities of Deanna's standard films. There's an off-kilter feel to this one, and one can't help but wonder if that was brought about by its having had two directors at the helm, each championing a differing set of aesthetics. It's a tribute to Deanna that she still comes off as grounded and sensible in spite of her wild charade. But her rapport with the children seems genuine and affectionate. And she's in fine form as she sings five musical numbers: ""Mighty Lak' a Rose"" (my favorite of the bunch), ""Lullaby,"" ""Chinese Lullaby,"" ""The Old Refrain,"" and Puccini's ""Vissi d'Arte."" But, okay, I never felt that Deanna had real chemistry with Edmond O'Brien. So, yeah, that's what I'll do. I'll blame the film's shortcomings on Edmond O'Brien. Or maybe it was the flashbacks. Or maybe it was Jean Renoir, who directed bits of the film until he got canned for being too slow and Bruce Manning then took over.Note: The copy I have is a Region 2 DVD which isn't playable on a Region 1 DVD player (Region 1 DVDs are the standard for the U.S., U.S. Territories, Canada, and Bermuda).

I was thrilled to find out that another Deanna Durbin vehicle was released on DVD and without hesitation I purchased it. I was beyond AMAZED! The movie is wonderful. Its a story that will leave you feeling, that not only was Deanna Durbin talented and beautiful, she was a true diamond to Universal. Its not your typical Deanna Durbin storyline but the same elements are there. She truly was an amazing actress and I wish she didn't retire when she had because I would have loved to have seen her in hundreds of films. This film, in my opinion, is worth purchasing. Its a great story of love and triumph and leaves you feeling that the films in those times had more to them then what we have today. Thank You Deanna Durbin for giving us the gift of your face, presence, voice and your true acting talent!!!",5,Another Masterpiece for Deanna Durbin Fans,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,933,"['will', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'critic', 'am', 'however', 'huge', 'movie', 'lover', 'collect', 'movies', 'DVD', 'genres', 'was', 'thrilled', 'find', 'out', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'vehicle', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'hesitation', 'purchased', 'was', 'AMAZED', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'story', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'was', 'true', 'diamond', 'Universal', 'not', 'typical', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'storyline', 'same', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'truly', 'was', 'amazing', 'actress', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'retire', 'when', 'had', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'hundreds', 'films', 'film', 'opinion', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'great', 'story', 'love', 'triumph', 'feeling', 'films', 'times', 'had', 'more', 'then', 'what', 'have', 'today', 'Thank', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'giving', 'gift', 'face', 'presence', 'voice', 'true', 'acting', 'talent']",N/A
62446,A37S3ACL57LN62,0783229704,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[3, 3]","The Amazing Mrs. Holliday is the story of an American girl (Deanna Durbin) who brings children out of China during World War II. On the ship to America, a wealthy man tells her he will adopt all nine children because he lives in a large house with plenty of room. However, the ship is torpedoed and the man does not survive. In desperation, the girl tells his family that she is his widow and she begins living in the house with the children. In the meantime, she takes a liking to her grandson-in-law (Edmond O'Brien).Durbin carries her part with her usual charm and with the maturity of her later years in Hollywood. O'Brien is adequate in his part but is outshined by his female co-star.One of the best scenes in the film is a silent one at a dinner table. It utilizes all the greatness of the Hollywood gone by.The end of the film seems to fizzle, but it is brought back to life by an unexpected twist.",4,Starring Deanna Durbin,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,906,"['Amazing', 'Mrs.', 'Holliday', 'story', 'American', 'girl', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'who', 'children', 'China', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'ship', 'America', 'wealthy', 'man', 'will', 'adopt', 'nine', 'children', 'large', 'house', 'plenty', 'room', 'However', 'ship', 'torpedoed', 'man', 'not', 'survive', 'desperation', 'girl', 'family', 'widow', 'living', 'house', 'children', 'meantime', 'liking', 'grandson-in-law', 'Edmond', ""O'Brien"", '.Durbin', 'part', 'usual', 'charm', 'maturity', 'later', 'years', 'Hollywood', ""O'Brien"", 'adequate', 'part', 'outshined', 'female', 'co-star.One', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'silent', 'one', 'dinner', 'table', 'greatness', 'Hollywood', 'gone', 'by.The', 'end', 'film', 'fizzle', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'unexpected', 'twist']",N/A
