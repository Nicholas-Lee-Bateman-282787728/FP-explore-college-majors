1246647,AKUIYX3PU2PJL,B0021L8UMQ,Carmen Ferreiro-Esteban,"[1, 1]","Little Ashes is a fictionalized portrait of the relationship between three of the most charismatic and talented Spanish artists of the twentieth century: Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca, Salvador Dal&iacute; and Lu&iacute;s Bu&ntilde;uel. Its title comes from the name of one of Dal&iacute;'s early paintings that Lorca and Dal&iacute; discuss during an idyllic holiday they spend together in the Catalan coast.Little Ashes starts in 1922 when a 24 years old Lorca first meets Dal&iacute;, then 18. Lorca is shaken by his strong attraction to this shy and narcissistic youth who thinks himself a genius.That Lorca was homosexual there is no doubt today. But to be homosexual in Spain in the 1920s was not something to flaunt about because it was a crime punishable with 14 years of forced labor. Besides, Spain was a strictly Catholic country, and Lorca raised in this belief would have perceived his sexual inclination to be a sin and a shame for his whole family.What all this means is that Lorca and Dal&iacute;'s relationship would not have been an easy one in the best of circumstances. If you add to this Dal&iacute;'s pathological fear of being touched, Bu&ntilde;uel's jealousy over loosing Lorca's friendship, a smitten girl's determination to make Lorca love her back, and a country already split in two political factions that eventually will fight each other to death during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), you will have some of the ingredients that make this movie such a powerful and heart wrenching story.The actors, both the Spanish and the British, are excellent, including an almost unrecognizable Robert Pattison (of Twilight fame) as Dal&iacute;, and the movie is a fascinating portrait of an era.",5,Powerful and heartbreaking,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,1717,"['Little', 'Ashes', 'fictionalized', 'portrait', 'relationship', 'three', 'most', 'charismatic', 'talented', 'Spanish', 'artists', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Federico', 'Garc', 'iacute', 'Lorca', 'Salvador', 'Dal', 'iacute', 'Lu', 'iacute', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'title', 'name', 'one', 'Dal', 'iacute', 'early', 'paintings', 'Lorca', 'Dal', 'iacute', 'discuss', 'idyllic', 'holiday', 'spend', 'together', 'Catalan', 'coast.Little', 'Ashes', '1922', 'when', '24', 'years', 'old', 'Lorca', 'first', 'meets', 'Dal', 'iacute', 'then', '18', 'Lorca', 'shaken', 'strong', 'attraction', 'shy', 'narcissistic', 'youth', 'who', 'genius.That', 'Lorca', 'was', 'homosexual', 'doubt', 'today', 'be', 'homosexual', 'Spain', '1920s', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'flaunt', 'about', 'was', 'crime', 'punishable', '14', 'years', 'forced', 'labor', 'Besides', 'Spain', 'was', 'strictly', 'Catholic', 'country', 'Lorca', 'raised', 'belief', 'would', 'have', 'perceived', 'sexual', 'inclination', 'be', 'sin', 'shame', 'whole', 'family.What', 'Lorca', 'Dal', 'iacute', 'relationship', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'one', 'best', 'circumstances', 'add', 'Dal', 'iacute', 'pathological', 'fear', 'being', 'touched', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'jealousy', 'loosing', 'Lorca', 'friendship', 'smitten', 'girl', 'determination', 'make', 'Lorca', 'love', 'back', 'country', 'already', 'split', 'two', 'political', 'factions', 'eventually', 'will', 'fight', 'other', 'death', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', '1936-1939', 'will', 'have', 'ingredients', 'make', 'movie', 'powerful', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'story.The', 'actors', 'Spanish', 'British', 'are', 'excellent', 'including', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Robert', 'Pattison', 'Twilight', 'fame', 'Dal', 'iacute', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'era']",Little Ashes

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[23, 25]","For most of his life, Salvador Dali denied that he had ever been lovers with the tragic poet Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca -- until the end of his life.So, writer Philippa Goslett and director Paul Morrison explore what may have been in ""Little Ashes,"" in which two young men become close friends, more-than-friends, only to have their relationship splinter apart. It's a powerful little story with astonishing acting by Robert Pattinson and Javier Beltran, but it tends to meander and shake way too much.In the Madrid of 1922, a shy and awkward art student named Salvador Dali (Pattinson) is drawn into a circle of vibrant, iconoclastic young artists, including filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (Matthew McNulty) and poet Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca (Javier Beltran). Lorca in particular is intrigued by Dali, who is just discovering his unique melty surrealist style -- and it's not a platonic crush. And though initially he fights against the attraction, a trip to the seaside reveals Lorca's feelings to Dali.But as their attraction grows, Bu&ntilde;uel feels shut out and tries to pull Dali out of Lorca's orbit -- and after an unsuccessful attempt to consummate their affair, Dali vanishes to Paris without a word. A possibly insulting movie and many years widen the split between them, until Lorca meets Dali, now world famous and in love with the ""witch"" Gala (Arly Jover). Dali has changed, and so has Spain -- with terrible results.I know relatively little of either Dali or Lorca's lives, but it seems that ""Little Ashes"" is less about what happened than about what MIGHT have happened. Unfortunately it also falls prey to a common flaw in biographical movies, even if they're semi-fictionalized accounts -- it meanders randomly much of the time, and has awkward jumps between the different phases in the two men's lives. And what is up with Beltran suddenly reciting poetry in Spanish?But if it meanders, it's a picturesque meander -- sunny streets of Madrid, shadowy apartments, rocky beaches, weird surrealist visions of Paris, and fun nightclubs where bright young artists congregate. Paul Morrison has a straightforward directorial style with few ups or downs, but there are some beautiful moments sprinkled throughout it -- such as a balletic swim in a moonlit blue sea, or the bittersweet final scenes for Lorca (interspersed with Dali frantically smearing black paint all over).But this movie would be utterly forgettable if it weren't for the leads. Both are painfully magnificent, both in their chemistry and in their attempts to embody their characters. Beltran is a tragic figure who brims over with passion, sorrow and integrity, and somehow you know that things never end happily for this poor man. Marina Gatell has a small but well-acted role as a young woman passionately in love with Lorca, but obviously she can be nothing more than his friend (and once, a sexual proxy for Dali).And Pattinson exudes almost Johnny-Depplike skill in almost becoming Dali. This is no glamorous ""Twilight"" role -- at first Pattinson plays him as a twitchy, painfully awkward and shy young man, but as Dali grows in confidence he also becomes more insistently eccentric and flamboyant, to the point where Lorca no longer recognizes him as a person. Mad laughter, insane grief, and all the time we're never quite sure what he's truly thinking about anything -- except, at the end, about Lorca himself.""Little Ashes"" is a flawed portrait covered in jewel-like paint -- the actors are truly astonishing in their skill, but the direction is a straightforward and spotty affair. And it's all the more tragic because at least some of it is true.",3,"Meandering story, powerful cast",1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,3645,"['most', 'life', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'denied', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'lovers', 'tragic', 'poet', 'Federico', 'Garc', 'iacute', 'Lorca', 'end', 'life.So', 'writer', 'Philippa', 'Goslett', 'director', 'Paul', 'Morrison', 'explore', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Little', 'Ashes', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'more-than-friends', 'only', 'have', 'relationship', 'splinter', 'apart', 'powerful', 'little', 'story', 'astonishing', 'acting', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Javier', 'Beltran', 'meander', 'shake', 'way', 'too', 'Madrid', '1922', 'shy', 'awkward', 'art', 'student', 'named', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'Pattinson', 'drawn', 'circle', 'vibrant', 'iconoclastic', 'young', 'artists', 'including', 'filmmaker', 'Luis', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'Matthew', 'McNulty', 'poet', 'Federico', 'Garc', 'iacute', 'Lorca', 'Javier', 'Beltran', 'Lorca', 'particular', 'intrigued', 'Dali', 'who', 'just', 'discovering', 'unique', 'melty', 'surrealist', 'style', 'not', 'platonic', 'crush', 'initially', 'attraction', 'trip', 'seaside', 'Lorca', 'feelings', 'Dali.But', 'attraction', 'grows', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'feels', 'shut', 'out', 'tries', 'pull', 'Dali', 'Lorca', 'orbit', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'consummate', 'affair', 'Dali', 'Paris', 'word', 'possibly', 'insulting', 'movie', 'many', 'years', 'widen', 'split', 'Lorca', 'meets', 'Dali', 'now', 'world', 'famous', 'love', 'witch', 'Gala', 'Arly', 'Jover', 'Dali', 'changed', 'so', 'Spain', 'terrible', 'results.I', 'know', 'relatively', 'little', 'Dali', 'Lorca', 'lives', 'Little', 'Ashes', 'less', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'MIGHT', 'have', 'happened', 'also', 'prey', 'common', 'flaw', 'biographical', 'movies', 'even', ""'re"", 'semi-fictionalized', 'accounts', 'randomly', 'much', 'time', 'awkward', 'jumps', 'different', 'phases', 'two', 'men', 'lives', 'what', 'up', 'Beltran', 'suddenly', 'reciting', 'poetry', 'Spanish', 'picturesque', 'meander', 'sunny', 'streets', 'Madrid', 'shadowy', 'apartments', 'rocky', 'beaches', 'weird', 'surrealist', 'visions', 'Paris', 'fun', 'nightclubs', 'where', 'bright', 'young', 'artists', 'congregate', 'Paul', 'Morrison', 'straightforward', 'directorial', 'style', 'few', 'ups', 'downs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'sprinkled', 'such', 'balletic', 'swim', 'moonlit', 'blue', 'sea', 'bittersweet', 'final', 'scenes', 'Lorca', 'interspersed', 'Dali', 'frantically', 'smearing', 'black', 'paint', '.But', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'were', ""n't"", 'leads', 'are', 'painfully', 'magnificent', 'chemistry', 'attempts', 'embody', 'characters', 'Beltran', 'tragic', 'figure', 'who', 'passion', 'sorrow', 'integrity', 'somehow', 'know', 'things', 'never', 'end', 'happily', 'poor', 'man', 'Marina', 'Gatell', 'small', 'well-acted', 'role', 'young', 'woman', 'passionately', 'love', 'Lorca', 'obviously', 'can', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'friend', 'once', 'sexual', 'proxy', 'Dali', '.And', 'Pattinson', 'almost', 'Johnny-Depplike', 'skill', 'almost', 'becoming', 'Dali', 'glamorous', 'Twilight', 'role', 'first', 'Pattinson', 'twitchy', 'painfully', 'awkward', 'shy', 'young', 'man', 'Dali', 'confidence', 'also', 'more', 'insistently', 'eccentric', 'flamboyant', 'point', 'where', 'Lorca', 'no', 'longer', 'person', 'Mad', 'laughter', 'insane', 'grief', 'time', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'truly', 'thinking', 'anything', 'end', 'Lorca', 'Little', 'Ashes', 'flawed', 'portrait', 'covered', 'jewel-like', 'paint', 'actors', 'are', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'skill', 'direction', 'straightforward', 'spotty', 'affair', 'more', 'tragic', 'least', 'true']",Little Ashes

1246656,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0021L8UMQ,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","There are many reasons to see this film, not the least of which is the continuing fascination with the subject of the story.  Three of Spain's brightest artists of the first part of the 20th century each had live that have fascinated readers and historians for decades.  While this 'quasi-accurate' biographical script by Philippa Goslett is not the definitive documentary many have been waiting for, at least it is a wild quilt of bits and pieces of each of the artists' creative lives - and some of their private lives as well.1922, Spain, and the art school in Madrid is ripe with talent: poet/playwright Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca (Javier Beltr&aacute;n) has already published some of his poems, Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (Matthew McNulty) is more involved with the political festering of fascism and what will become Franco's Spain than he is with concentrating on the brilliant films he will eventually make, and the newly arrived Salvador Dal&iacute; (Robert Pattinson) is making visually shocking entrances in wild clothing while rebelling against the current fads in art.  The three bond, encouraged by the writer Magdalena (Marina Gatell) who merely wants to become not only a famous feminist writer but also a part of the obvious changes in art these three men represent.The sexuality of Garc&iacute;a Lorca is clear: he finds himself drawn to the creative but peculiar Dal&iacute;.  Dal&iacute;'s preferences seem to include both men and women and as their beautiful friendship evolves it is Dal&iacute; who ultimately runs to Paris out of self-doubt and homophobia.  Madrid may be avant-garde, but there is a strong anti-gay contingent (including oddly enough Bu&ntilde;uel) and the discord politically and artistically forces many to flee to Paris, the mecca of art.  The bruised and rejected Garc&iacute;a Lorca finds solace in his creation of a traveling theater for his own plays while Dal&iacute; marries Gala in Paris and completes the famous film 'The Andalusian Dog' with Bu&ntilde;uel.  When the three men (and Magdalena) eventually meet again some years later the world has changed, even if old feelings haven't.If the story sounds disconnected, it is.  There are some very beautiful scenes from director Paul Morrison: a scene with Garc&iacute;a Lorca and Dal&iacute; in an almost underwater ballet is sensuous and beautifully photographed.  Javier Beltr&aacute;n is a sensitive actor and does well with the little he has to work with as Garc&iacute;a Lorca.  Robert Pattinson can't quite find the level of the bizarre personality of Dal&iacute; - it would take a really fine actor to accomplish this.  But the general casting is good.  The editing of this movie is some of the worse on record (Rachel Tunnard) and that factors in a problem with the flow of the film.  But for a diversion and another look at the arts in the early 20th century, LITTLE ASHES is entertaining. It could have been so much better.

In the end, the viewer never gains any insight into Dali, Garcia Lorca, or the time period in which the film was set.

It looked interesting and thought I would like it. By the time the movie was over and the closing credits were rolling all I could say was WOW! To me it was an amazing movie that has restored my faith that the art of film making does still exist. Far too many movies made nowadays rely way too much on senseless violence, explosions, car chases and way over the top special effects. There is none of that in Little Ashes. Instead they rely on the power of the spoken word and human emotion to create a story that compels you to watch and be drawn into the plot. I will say it helps in watching this movie if you know a little bit about Salvador Dali and his art. The movie does a great job in showing how Dali became the eccentric artist he was. Still even without knowing who he was you will find yourself fasinated by the artistic genious some would call a madman. Robert Pattinson (from Twilight fame) gives an outstanding performance as Dali. I feel though that Javier Beltran steals the show as Federico Garcia Lorca, an up and coming poet who would inspire many to resist against facists trying to gain control of Spain and who finds himself sexually attracted to Dali. There is no doubt in my mind that Little Ashes was one of the best films of 2009.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[3, 3]","This artistic little endeavor seems to emulate the writing style of Federico Garcia Lorca, the Spanish martyr/poet/playwright, with lingering artistic shots of waving foliage, drops of rain, flowering plants, etc., etc... The story itself explores the young adult lives of Se&ntilde;or Lorca (June, 1898 - August, 1936), eccentric Surrealist artist/playwright Salvador Dali (May, 1904 - January, 1989) and Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (February, 1900 - July, 1983), the Spanish-born father of cinematic Surrealism. The three of them attended a Madrid college together in 1922. This movie is based on interviews with Dali near the end of his life.We watch the three of them become friends; Lorca, appealingly played by Javier Beltran (""El paso"") and Bu&ntilde;uel, capably portrayed by Matthew McNulty (""The Mark of Cain"" and LOTS of TV) are already chums when Dali, played by Robert Pattinson (""Twilight""), arrives, insecure but ambitious. All three of them assiduously date women, because homosexuality is illegal in Spain, as it is throughout the Western world at that time, but only Bu&ntilde;uel is actually heterosexual. Of the other two, Dali seems to be bisexual, while Lorca plays (pretty much) for the other team.We are subjected to numerous scenes of collegiate carousing which seem to be universal, whether in Cambridge or Madrid, and the Seattle audience applauded Dali's outspoken nonconformity. One of the actresses did a splendid job as the woman who was in (unrequited) love with Lorca, and I witnessed more of the history of the Spanish revolution than I really sought; but tragically, this movie didn't ""grab"" me. Many in the audience found it moving and informative, so I suspect I was in the minority.It's clear to me that Pattinson is striving to avoid typecasting which could threaten his career due to his more recent starring role in the ""tween"" vampire franchise (he also appears in the ""Harry Potter"" series). He plays the eccentric artiste Dali very well, but unfortunately, his early variations of the characteristic Dali'esque moustache look glued on. I know, I know, that's pretty picky...This screenplay is in English, although Lorca's poems are spoken in Spanish with an English voiceover layered into the soundtrack.

1246662,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B0021L8UMQ,Jeffery Mingo,"[14, 19]","This was a good art house movie, but let me explain my two frustrations.  First and most importantly, THERE IS NO MALE NUDITY HERE!!!  There is much of the female kind.  Pattinson teases the viewers, but doesn't show the goods.  I guess this movie didn't want to be ""ghettoized,"" but in terms of naughty bits, this was the straightest rainbow flag movie I've ever seen.  Second, as beautiful as this period piece was, at one point, two actors are on a balcony and it is so obvious that their view of Madrid was computer-produced.  It reminded me of James Bond in cars where clearly a screen is just showing action behind him.Many reviewers have said, ""How will Pattinson's female tween fans feel seeing this?!""  First off, it's too arthouse for them and I think they'd get bored and turn it off.  Plus, many in Mall America won't have access to this arthouse film.  I am glad the work was for more direct than ""Interview with a Vampire,"" but hopefully the tame kissing won't shock that many.This is a fascinating tale about bizarre triangles.  It is an interesting twist on homophobes who have bonds with rainbow flag men.  The work tries to bring in a female audience with the role of Margarita and her ""Object of My Affection"" vibe.  It may be hard for some to differentiate characters when the three main men are thin, white, black-haired, and the same age.Boy, have the times changed!  It's hard to think of men that we'd say ""dress preppy"" as being radical.  There seemed to be some sex-segregation in the schooling.  In many schools, Dali would face persecution now the way he first appears on screen.If you love artsy circles, then you'll love this work.  Those who are interested in the Bloomsbury Group, the Beats, etc. will love this artistic exploration.  If you loved ""Frida"" or ""Head in the Clouds,"" then you should love this.  And to be honest, Pattinson does an amazing job as Dali.This work was rewarding and disappointing.

Overall, I'm torn over it.  The cinematography is exceptional, creating a very beautiful film.  The setting, the time period, the costuming - all well done.  The dialog is somewhat sparse - there are long instances where there is little or no talking - but woven throughout are excerpts from Lorca's poetry that really add to the mood and tone.  The acting is superb, especially the leads, Robert Pattinson and Javier Beltran.  I was surprised at how they disappeared into their roles, even more so for Pattinson.  I feel he had the more challenging role in bringing the eccentric, brilliant and somewhat unhinged Dali to life.The story is alternately angst-ridden, languid and intense. However, the movie is incredibly slow.  Almost tortuously slow at times.  I think the filmmakers intended to show the gradual growth of feeling between the two men, but sometime I felt like I was looking at a lovely painting instead of a living story.  There are some very intense scenes, in particular when Dali and Lorca attempt to have sex without really taking the reality of it into account.  This scene was gut-wrenching and emotional, but there were too few scenes of such intensity.  Overall, fans of historical and/or biographical films who have a lot of patience may find this rewarding.

Martin,"[3, 8]","Based on the performances, this might have been a better movie if it had been all-Spanish rather than Spanish/English, both in language and production. In the four principal roles, the two Spanish actors (Javier Beltran as Garc&iacute;a Lorca and Marina Gatell as Magdalena) are good, but the two English actors (Robert Pattinson as Dal&iacute; and Matthew McNulty as Bu&ntilde;uel) are awful. Even I as a non-Spanish speaker could tell their accents were as phony as mine would be. Pattinson sounds like an American in the Twilight movies, but in this he just sounds English with a bad Spanish accent, and McNulty is no better.Bad accents are forgivable if there's acting talent to make up for it, but there isn't in these cases. I never for one second believed in anything Pattinson said or did, particularly when he had to pretend to be attracted to Beltran; it was painfully incompetent acting. He should stick to imitating Marlon Brando with orange contacts and leave Spanish roles to the Spanish.Since the Spanish actors were having to speak English dialog, their accents were pretty heavy too, so I needed subtitles, and if I'm going to be reading subtitles anyway I'd rather hear the right language in the soundtrack. This is one movie that should NOT have been an international production. That's a shame, because it's a fascinating story that could have been beautiful rather than tedious.I expect I'll get plenty of negative votes from livid Pattinson fans, but there's nothing surprising about that.",2,a great Spanish story ruined by the English,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,1511,"['Based', 'performances', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'all-Spanish', 'rather', 'Spanish/English', 'language', 'production', 'four', 'principal', 'roles', 'two', 'Spanish', 'actors', 'Javier', 'Beltran', 'Garc', 'iacute', 'Lorca', 'Marina', 'Gatell', 'Magdalena', 'are', 'good', 'two', 'English', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Dal', 'iacute', 'Matthew', 'McNulty', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'are', 'awful', 'Even', 'non-Spanish', 'speaker', 'could', 'tell', 'accents', 'were', 'as', 'phony', 'mine', 'would', 'be', 'Pattinson', 'American', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'just', 'English', 'bad', 'Spanish', 'accent', 'McNulty', 'better.Bad', 'accents', 'are', 'forgivable', 'acting', 'talent', 'make', 'up', ""n't"", 'cases', 'never', 'one', 'second', 'believed', 'anything', 'Pattinson', 'said', 'did', 'particularly', 'when', 'had', 'pretend', 'be', 'attracted', 'Beltran', 'was', 'painfully', 'incompetent', 'acting', 'should', 'stick', 'imitating', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'orange', 'contacts', 'leave', 'Spanish', 'roles', 'Spanish.Since', 'Spanish', 'actors', 'were', 'having', 'speak', 'English', 'dialog', 'accents', 'were', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'too', 'needed', 'subtitles', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'anyway', ""'d"", 'rather', 'hear', 'right', 'language', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'movie', 'should', 'NOT', 'have', 'been', 'international', 'production', 'shame', 'fascinating', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'beautiful', 'rather', 'tedious.I', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'get', 'plenty', 'negative', 'votes', 'livid', 'Pattinson', 'fans', 'nothing', 'surprising']",Little Ashes
1246666,A1JZUI3JE5CKVT,B0021L8UMQ,Johan Peter,"[12, 13]","IMHO this film is simply universally great. Thus not made for a target-group. If you need to belong to one, you will find much to dislike. If not, it has a richness beyond your imagination.The title refers to a remark Lorca makes about the first of what would become the Dali-style paintings. Lorca is incorporated in the picture, and the inspiration for it, so Dali askes him to name his 'breakthrough'. Lorca's anwer,""Little Ashes"", is his melancholic reference to what in the end will remain of their relationship. ""The painting will still be there"" Dali objects. Lorca is not convinced but they find each other when Dali proclaims [that the only matter of importance is that]:""I can see you now, Frederico"". Which obviously is meant in the broadest/deepest meaning of the word 'see', and they embrace. At that moment their relationship remains still platonic but becomes a significant step more intimate, maybe uniquely intimate for Dali. The scene is important for many reasons, one of them is the fact that according to most historians Dali was incapable of being touched [man & woman alike]: it may be one of Dali's many made-up stories, but he once stated that he and his lifelong wife Gala were ""virgins to each other"" [Gala was famously very not a virgin, so to speak].The atmosphere of the earlier scene is also in stark contrast with the scene eight years later [1936] when they meet each other again after a long period and Lorca is burdened with the threatening developements in Spain [and sadly not his own safety: Lorca was murdered by the fascists in '36] while Dali has become a money-loving poseur who almost advertises the concept of a world-war ""that will eliminate the weaker elements everywhere, a great cleansing"". They are worlds apart now.Both scenes and the ones in between are brilliantly acted by Javier Beltran, who as Lorca radiates inner beauty and unworldly amounts of charm that make brickbuilded straight truckdrivers cry when he dies, while Robert Pattinson is amazing in his portrayal of the totally transforming Dali: Pattinson leaves you, as a spectator, completely in the dark where it all comes from, it seems like he managed to convince Dali's ghost to make a great come-back via him.Matthew McNulty as a very macho homophobic Luis Bunuel is entirely convincing too, especially when he, as a result of reading Lorca's diary, is appalled because of it's content but at the same time doubts his independent mind, being not able to understand his friend.

I'll have to agree with the ones who felt it was pretty good.I'll agree with those who thought there could have been more to the story but despite that, the film overall worked. It is beautifully shot!Now for the acting, you have to remember that Bunuel, Lorca and Dali were 3 very exceptional artists in their own right and those are pretty big shoes to fill in. Especially for the Dali role. Take away the Twilight films and you could say Robert Pattinson has his heart in the right place as an actor.
