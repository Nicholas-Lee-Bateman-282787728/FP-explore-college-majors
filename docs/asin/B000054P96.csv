The story was dismal from start to finish. The characters were unlikeable for the most part. This is one I would file in my BIG MISTAKE folder, as it was a big mistake to have ordered it. Some might call it ""Avant Garde"", but I call it trash and a complte waste of the actor's & director's time to make it.",1,UGH!!

An event takes place that sets off a chain of responses; one, stunningly surprising. To mention the event would give the entire plot away. The plot becomes divergent. Weird things start happening. I continued watching, wondering what the point might be. It's certainly complicated. Club-land returns. More unfathomable stuff follows and then... It's a curious film on which the point was certainly missed by me.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'.",2,A curious film,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,553,"['club-land', 'flashing', 'lights', 'writhing', 'bodies', 'protagonists', 'work', 'hospital', 'morgue', 'event', 'place', 'off', 'chain', 'responses', 'one', 'stunningly', 'surprising', 'mention', 'event', 'would', 'give', 'entire', 'plot', 'away', 'plot', 'divergent', 'Weird', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'continued', 'watching', 'wondering', 'what', 'point', 'might', 'be', 'certainly', 'complicated', 'Club-land', 'returns', 'More', 'unfathomable', 'stuff', 'then', 'curious', 'film', 'point', 'was', 'certainly', 'missed', 'me.Ian', 'Hunter.Author', 'e-Love']",Don't Let Me Die On a Sunday
566905,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000054P96,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Dark and explicit, 1998's ""Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday"" is French exploration of deviation and pushing sexual boundaries as a means of relieving life's tedium.  It is a disturbing psychological journey of mismatched souls looking for connection, depth, or any kind of intimacy in a post-HIV landscape.  While I was certainly inclined to appreciate the controversial nature of the film, it left me somewhat cold.  In order for the experience to be truly successful, I felt a greater need to connect with the psyche of its lead characters.  Lacking a true understanding of their twistedness and dissatisfaction, the film works primarily as a voyeuristic excursion into an unpleasant realm.  Still worth seeing by adventurous adult audiences, the movie should have and could have been a harrowing and wrenching roller-coaster ride into darkness.
