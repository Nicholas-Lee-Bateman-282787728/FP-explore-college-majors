I first saw this movie in 1956 or 57 when it first came out and haven't seen it since until this new DVD that I bought from Amazon.  Picture clarity good as is the color.The memories it brought back include my remembering my earliest trips to Las Vegas when the flashing neon signs featured in the movie were the real thing and not distant memories.  The Sands, Desert Inn, Sahara, Silver Slipper, Dunes, Thunderbird were very much the reality of a much more relaxed, westernized Vegas than is there today, to say nothing in the change of population.As to the movie,  Watching Cyd Charisse dance is mesmerizing..the Frankie and Johnnie dance near the end with the background singing done by Sammy Davis Jr.  is absolutely spectacular.  The early ballet rehearsal is equally entrancing.Also, the spots done by Lena Horne and Frankie Laine were terrific and both done when they were respectively at the top of their game.I urge those who weren't privileged to visit Vegas during the years shown in the movie to see this.  It is a snapshot into a time when we old folks understood the true meaning of entertainment.  A dinner theater setting is much more enjoyable than what is most common today and that is theater seating which is about as personal as riding coach in an airline.The other actors weren't ""no names"" as one reviewer stated, but were among the top box office stars of their time.  Apart from this disagreement, let me say that Dan Dailey played his role very well, Cyd was terrific, Agnes Moorhead did her usual fine job as did Jim Backus and Paul Henreid.Short cameos by Frank Sinatra, Peter Lorre, Debby Reynolds, Vic Damone and even Cyd's husband Tony Martin (who actually had a line of dialogue) added to my enjoyment.All said a most enjoyable time and highly recommend this movie to everyone.",5,Old time Vegas..anytime enjoyment,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,1947,"['are', 'few', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'kept', 'smiling', 'when', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'one', 'few', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', '1956', '57', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'new', 'DVD', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'Picture', 'clarity', 'good', 'color.The', 'memories', 'brought', 'back', 'include', 'remembering', 'earliest', 'trips', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'when', 'flashing', 'neon', 'signs', 'featured', 'movie', 'were', 'real', 'thing', 'not', 'distant', 'memories', 'Sands', 'Desert', 'Inn', 'Sahara', 'Silver', 'Slipper', 'Dunes', 'Thunderbird', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'reality', 'much', 'more', 'relaxed', 'westernized', 'Vegas', 'today', 'say', 'nothing', 'change', 'population.As', 'movie', 'Watching', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'dance', 'mesmerizing..the', 'Frankie', 'Johnnie', 'dance', 'end', 'background', 'singing', 'done', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Jr.', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'early', 'ballet', 'rehearsal', 'equally', 'entrancing.Also', 'spots', 'done', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'Frankie', 'Laine', 'were', 'terrific', 'done', 'when', 'were', 'respectively', 'top', 'game.I', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'privileged', 'visit', 'Vegas', 'years', 'shown', 'movie', 'see', 'snapshot', 'time', 'when', 'old', 'folks', 'understood', 'true', 'meaning', 'entertainment', 'dinner', 'theater', 'setting', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'what', 'most', 'common', 'today', 'theater', 'seating', 'as', 'personal', 'riding', 'coach', 'airline.The', 'other', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'names', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'were', 'top', 'box', 'office', 'stars', 'time', 'Apart', 'disagreement', 'let', 'say', 'Dan', 'Dailey', 'played', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'Cyd', 'was', 'terrific', 'Agnes', 'Moorhead', 'did', 'usual', 'fine', 'job', 'did', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Paul', 'Henreid.Short', 'cameos', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'Debby', 'Reynolds', 'Vic', 'Damone', 'even', 'Cyd', 'husband', 'Tony', 'Martin', 'who', 'actually', 'had', 'line', 'dialogue', 'added', 'enjoyment.All', 'said', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone']",N/A
