How awful it is to be wrong about such a thing.  If it is possible to make a movie that is more conceptually appealing to me, I would be surprised.  How is it that so lovely a premise could turn out so bad?  Read on...The director and DP should be barred from making movies ever again.  If the movie ran at real speed it would only be a few minutes long.  Luckily there is gratuitous use of slow-motion throughout to make the film as long as other movies.  The film constantly starts out in B&W; and then color bleeds in.  This serves no logical purpose and I would guess that it is a poor attempt to add art to a piece of poorly done agitprop.  The black and white shots look like a camcorder was used.  Often times the colors are mistinted when brought into effect.  When one character is crying out for help, he is edited from finishing his sentence.  These are very basic technical flaws.The story is contrived and simplistic.  It does not reflect well the positions of the violent nor nonviolent defenders of civil rights.  And, for some unknown reason, the filmmakers felt it necessary to paint the KKK as even more evil that they already were.  Why?  Are there confused moviegoers (outside of the obvious extremists) who would be confused about who to root for?  Every single type in this film is a caricature of a stereotype.  The nonviolent activists are portrayed as ignorant fools out of touch with reality.  The armed activists are portrayed as savage brutes incapable of reason.  A great hero of the civil rights movement, Ossie Davis, portrays an Uncle Tom who becomes a savage brute.  Any surviving Deacons should be horrified at the way they are portrayed.  It's the same type of disrespect given to the Black Panthers.  The political awakening of Forest Whitaker's character is just plain disgusting.  His more than any other character is told as fanatical and unreasoning.The people involved in the events mocked in this travesty had strong cases for their points (except for the segregationists).  This film does nothing to bring light to those ideas even when they are applicable today.  The acting is bad.  The script is bad.  The directing is bad.  The editing is bad.

I first heard about the Deacons of Defense decades ago from the book &quot;Negroes with Guns.&quot; The story was later promulgated by the Jews for the Preservation of Gun Ownership (whatever happened to those guys?)I can't believe there are those who are calling the movie full of unbelievable caricatures-- this is how things were! The Klan was not always the pathetic buffoons you see on Jerry Springer. A million Klansmen once marched in the 20 Century on DC as if it were just an Easter Parade. Politicians once proudly announced their Klan affiliation. Their numbers were large, their deeds hideous, their tendrils all throughout the government and so-called protectors. This is NOT ancient history; I remember white's only signs myself. They didn't all just disappear overnight.These brave men armed themselves for their own protection as well as their children and the white men who worked with them to bring about the civil rights they deserved. Yes, that's right black men and children were flailed, hung, and beaten as well as denied civil rights. White men and women who helped them often faced similar consequences. Forrest Whittaker brings another good performance as his character breaks through the learned helplessness that comes from oppression.The deeper story is the same as in such stories as the Warsaw Uprising and Escape from Sobibor. When a group is dehumanized on racial, class, or economic grounds, the &quot;good&quot; people in the majority will grind them as much as possible. That is, until the underclass finds the wherewithal for real strength by some means. Armed self-defense is one way.They could have gone overboard; the movie showed that they had access to military weapons but they held themselves to a defense standard. This is the true American dream: that everyman should have the right and ability to defend themselves.  If the idea that these black men were armed to defend themselves and their family offends you-then I say you better check your own heart. If my brother feels safe, then I am all the more safe.
