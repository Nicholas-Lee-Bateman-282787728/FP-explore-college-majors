856175,A1TV5FU0WXFSBI,B00062DKOK,Amazon Customer,"[10, 10]","I've done many types of yoga and taught a mixture of them all. What I like about Gurmukh's instruction is that it uses the only one prop you need for yoga - your body. She doesn't place a great deal of emphasis on alignment and form, and you should take that in either a negative or positive way. I took it positively because frankly over-emphasis on form sometimes ends up injuring me in some wierd way. As a student, I have many times been corrected in an asana becuase i was not in the correct form, and my muscles were simply not ready or warmed enough for the adjustment the yoga teacher made on my body to ""correct"" me and I got hurt. Gurmukh just has you move in a way that is organic to your individual body. She does not encourage ""perfection"" in form. She also uses many exercises which are so basic and elementary, but WORK. My arms and calves were never this toned when using weights. She provides exercises which are common sense. All you need is your body to do basic exercises repeatedly, and they eventually get stronger. You stamina increases. You get leaner. You get an aerobic workout. I do feel fatigued the next day. Because it is a difficult workout. It seems easy for the first few seconds of each exercise...then she continues to do it -over and over again nonstop- for two long minutes until you get tired. Just do what you can, and however much is appropriate for your body. if you need to stop. Do so. You are the best judge of what is too much for you.",4,Great Yoga,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,1480,"[""'ve"", 'done', 'many', 'types', 'yoga', 'taught', 'mixture', 'What', 'like', 'Gurmukh', 'instruction', 'only', 'one', 'prop', 'need', 'yoga', 'body', ""n't"", 'place', 'great', 'deal', 'emphasis', 'alignment', 'form', 'should', 'take', 'negative', 'positive', 'way', 'took', 'positively', 'frankly', 'over-emphasis', 'form', 'sometimes', 'up', 'injuring', 'wierd', 'way', 'student', 'have', 'many', 'times', 'been', 'corrected', 'asana', 'becuase', 'i', 'was', 'not', 'correct', 'form', 'muscles', 'were', 'simply', 'not', 'ready', 'warmed', 'enough', 'adjustment', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'made', 'body', 'correct', 'got', 'hurt', 'Gurmukh', 'just', 'move', 'way', 'organic', 'individual', 'body', 'not', 'encourage', 'perfection', 'form', 'also', 'many', 'exercises', 'are', 'so', 'basic', 'elementary', 'WORK', 'arms', 'calves', 'were', 'never', 'toned', 'when', 'using', 'weights', 'exercises', 'are', 'common', 'sense', 'need', 'body', 'do', 'basic', 'exercises', 'repeatedly', 'eventually', 'get', 'stronger', 'stamina', 'increases', 'get', 'leaner', 'get', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'do', 'feel', 'fatigued', 'next', 'day', 'difficult', 'workout', 'easy', 'first', 'few', 'seconds', 'exercise', 'then', 'do', '-over', 'over', 'again', 'nonstop-', 'two', 'long', 'minutes', 'get', 'tired', 'Just', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'however', 'much', 'appropriate', 'body', 'need', 'stop', 'Do', 'so', 'are', 'best', 'judge', 'what', 'too', 'much']",N/A

A comment from another Amazon customer and Kundalini yogi helped me tremendously: drink water before and after, practice on an empty stomach, and first of all: do it slowly until you get used to it!  So I tried it again, and I did it at my own pace.  At times I even stopped when Gurmukh said to do it faster.  I felt no more nausea and with practice I improved and was able to do it all, and to do it faster.It is a very good yoga practice but I removed one star for several  reasons:The advice I finally found in an Amazon customer review should be part of the introduction in the DVD;Gurmukh is a great teacher but the people we see on the DVD are too serious and the music is too new-age for me.

856177,AWGD0ACATDBKT,B00062DKOK,"Cobra Chick ""Miss Tea""","[4, 4]","This was my first Kundalini video, although I'm familiar enough with yoga and in pretty good shape overall. I thoroughly enjoy the workout, although I think some of the poses need modifications explained for those that can't do them. I know my limitations, and make modifications as necessary, but if I didn't, I would have a hard time following or completing some of the exercises without potential injury (especially the one that involves knee bends, and the ones that have you jumping back and forth like a boxer). Other people may have difficulty rocking on their spine putting their legs over their head, and a modification for that move should be explained, in my opinion.What I don't like about this video is that there is no way of forwarding through the introduction. Once you've seen it once, you don't want to watch the GAIAM promotion again, or learn about Gurmukh's history, although she seems to be a lovely person with an extensive history in Kundalini Yoga. I get up at 5AM to workout before I go to work, and quite frankly, this is a big waste of my time. When a DVD won't let me fast forward through this nonsense, it makes me not want to use it.As I mentioned, the workout is enjoyable, and I do feel both relaxed and energized when I am finished, but I've since purchased Kundalini video's from Maya Feinnes and Raviana (Ana Brett & Ravi Singh), and I find them equally as enjoyable without the annoyance factor.

Every time I have done it, I cannot deny how much this workout made me sweat and made my heart pump like crazy.  However, having studied kundalini rather extensively, I think Gurmukh's approach is free form to a point of almost being physically dangerous.  I have danced for years and believe that before odd hopping sequences are introduced, there are many more important kundalini movements which a newcomer should witness first.  On one hand, there is a beautiful totality to her entire pattern, but if one wants to prevent achilles' tendon injuries, I would suggest replacing her hopping and punching with running and punching or even marching and punching.  Also, Gurmukh could have added another dimension to this set by including some held poses with breath of fire, like wheel, for example.  A good workout ought to be a compromise between such extreme action and geometric or methodical asana.  Kundalini yoga possesses all these components and Gurmukh had a responsibility to create a more well rounded sequence with better explanation than she did.

856181,A15TIAG5RDIGGY,B00062DKOK,Elizabeth M,"[17, 17]","I am a veteran of vinyasa flow, power yoga, jivamukti etc. You name it, I've probably tried it (but mostly vinyasa). I shied away from kundalini for a long time because it's so different from other forms of yoga, and the one video I tried a long time ago left me feeling lightheaded and exhausted in a bad way. I don't think I was really ready to give it a fair chance. Recently I was having some problems with anxiety and stress, and my typical yoga routine wasn't making a dent in it (so I know I was in a state!) Restorative yoga helped, but I was looking for something more cleansing and invigorating. I got this DVD from Netflix first to try it out, and I really love it.I have been with friends who have seen the DVD and have been wary of Gurmukh simply based on her appearance. They're afraid of dabbling in something overly ""mystical"" or ""new agey"". Well, aside from Gurmukh being of the Sikh faith (hence the turban), she's not much different from most yoga instructors. Actually, she's a lot better. She has an incredibly calming voice, and manages to motivate without coming across like an aerobics instructor (I seem to encounter a lot of aerobics-like yoga instructors in my studio travels. You know: ""Go on, feel the BURN! VINYASA!""Anyway, my advice on this DVD is to listen to your body. Gurmukh advises you to keep pushing past your point of resistance while doing the routine . My experience was that I need to keep working at this DVD to really keep up some of the movements the entire time. An important concept in yoga is to listen to your body. Shiva Rea calls it ""going to your intelligent edge"". In other words, you don't give up merely because you experience mental resistance, but pain isn't productive either. I had to back off some of the extended arm motions in here, as I pulled a muscle in my neck doing them the first time. Motivated by Gurmukh's urging and a bit of ego, I pushed myself a too far. So, listen to yourself :)For veterans of Kundalini, most of these are familiar exercises. I love how invigorated I feel doing this style of yoga. I also get an intense workout and feel that delicious soreness the next day, so I think I'll be sticking with it.I almost forgot- Gurmukh leads you in a great shavasana with a gong at the very end, and it's uniquely peaceful.",5,I'm just getting into Kundalini Yoga,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,2301,"['am', 'veteran', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'power', 'yoga', 'jivamukti', 'etc', 'name', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'tried', 'mostly', 'vinyasa', 'shied', 'away', 'kundalini', 'long', 'time', 'so', 'different', 'other', 'forms', 'yoga', 'one', 'video', 'tried', 'long', 'time', 'left', 'feeling', 'lightheaded', 'exhausted', 'bad', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'really', 'ready', 'give', 'fair', 'chance', 'Recently', 'was', 'having', 'problems', 'anxiety', 'stress', 'typical', 'yoga', 'routine', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'dent', 'know', 'was', 'state', 'Restorative', 'yoga', 'helped', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'cleansing', 'invigorating', 'got', 'DVD', 'Netflix', 'first', 'try', 'out', 'really', 'love', 'it.I', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'wary', 'Gurmukh', 'simply', 'based', 'appearance', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'dabbling', 'something', 'overly', 'mystical', 'new', 'agey', 'Well', 'aside', 'Gurmukh', 'being', 'Sikh', 'faith', 'hence', 'turban', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'most', 'yoga', 'instructors', 'Actually', 'lot', 'better', 'incredibly', 'calming', 'voice', 'motivate', 'coming', 'aerobics', 'instructor', 'seem', 'encounter', 'lot', 'aerobics-like', 'yoga', 'instructors', 'studio', 'travels', 'know', 'Go', 'feel', 'BURN', 'VINYASA', 'Anyway', 'advice', 'DVD', 'listen', 'body', 'Gurmukh', 'keep', 'pushing', 'point', 'resistance', 'doing', 'routine', 'experience', 'was', 'need', 'keep', 'working', 'DVD', 'really', 'keep', 'up', 'movements', 'entire', 'time', 'important', 'concept', 'yoga', 'listen', 'body', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'going', 'intelligent', 'edge', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'merely', 'experience', 'mental', 'resistance', 'pain', ""n't"", 'productive', 'either', 'had', 'back', 'off', 'extended', 'arm', 'motions', 'here', 'pulled', 'muscle', 'neck', 'doing', 'first', 'time', 'Motivated', 'Gurmukh', 'urging', 'bit', 'ego', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'So', 'listen', 'yourself', 'veterans', 'Kundalini', 'most', 'are', 'familiar', 'exercises', 'love', 'how', 'invigorated', 'feel', 'doing', 'style', 'yoga', 'also', 'get', 'intense', 'workout', 'feel', 'delicious', 'soreness', 'next', 'day', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sticking', 'it.I', 'almost', 'forgot-', 'Gurmukh', 'great', 'shavasana', 'gong', 'very', 'end', 'uniquely', 'peaceful']",N/A

There is a meditation and then a relaxation period in savasana (lying down 'corpse' pose).

I had seen her before, and always thought she looked FANTASTIC, but at the time, was too far out for me.  Well, times change, and now she doesn't seem ""out there"" at all.  (Maybe she is just a trailblazer!)  Anyway, I am a dancer of several years, and specifically a bellydancer of 3.5 years.  The profound transformation I have experienced with bellydance, I believe has a great deal to do with the awakening, aligning, clearing, and energizing of the chakras.  This DVD does the same thing.  I enjoyed it very much, and can see the similarities between bellydance and kundalini yoga.  I did keep some of my postures in what I felt were ""safer"" positions, because I want to dance for as many years as possible, and not blow out my lower back or knees, etc.  But, since I am not an expert at kundalini yoga, I won't make that assumption for everyone.  While I love bellydance so much more because as a woman, it also gave me love and appreciation for my own body. The awakening that comes from kundalini yoga also changes ones life, relationships, and self empowerment, but not in a female specific program.  I feel they are a compliment to each other, and I can see myself doing both, but if you are a woman, consider bellydance as another key to unlock your being and to experience a deeper connection to the world and the Divine.

This DVD is very to-the-point.  I like Gurmukh's manner.  She is very calm and reassuring and one can tell she has practiced this yoga for a very long time (not from her appearance, which is very youthful, but from her poise.)  After having used the Ravi and Ana DVD's I thought this one would be similar.  It is different in many ways.  For one thing, she used more aerobic moves which do make a person sweat.  Some of the poses are quite demanding, as she holds them longer.  I find it to be very different in a good way than Ravi and Ana's. It is not as ""instructional"" in that she does not demonstrate the two types of breathing, but she does explain many of the moves.  She is so obviously a sage, one must respect her and experience a ""class"" taught by her.  I wish I could attend a live class-- it would be an honor!!

She does the workout with you as well at least a few times especially even ones I had difficulty doing & I'm in my late 20s.It's very hard to do with a lot of aerobic feel.
