19750,A2RQS7X7FI3C6E,0767831322,AAI,"[5, 5]","Honestly I never heard of this movie until a few months ago.  I am a pretty big fan of Keifer Sutherland and some of his movies and of course his tv show 24.  So about a month ago I blindly bought this movie just for the hell of it.  The Flatliners stars Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, one of the Baldwins, and of course Keifer.The Flatliners itself is a pretty cool movie with a different concept than those in its genre. It deals with young medical students experimenting to find out if there is an afterlife.  Once they come back from the afterlife they are haunted by the other side.This is one of the ultimate &quot;Do not do this at home&quot; movies.  Although after I saw it I couldn't help from asking my friends &quot;How much money would you do it for&quot;, lol.  I bet one you see this you will be asking your friends.One area where it is lacking though is the DVD itself is lacking any kind of special features, interactive menus, and a decently layed out chapter selection.  In all honestly the movie is pretty good but the DVD is terrible compared to other newer DVDs. To me things like that make a difference.  The fact that it is cheap makes up for it though.I think if you enjoyed movies such as Stir of Echoes, The Sixth Sense, Vanilla Sky, or even the Mothman Prophies (underrated movie) you probably will enjoy this movie.  At times it is dark and sorta twisted but it always stays on track and never bores you.  Definetly check this movie out if you are a fan of Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon or Julia Roberts because they all shine in this movie.Movie grade - B+DVD Grade - D-",4,A different but good movie.,1075939200,"02 5, 2004",2004,1598,"['Honestly', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'am', 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'movies', 'course', 'tv', 'show', '24', 'So', 'month', 'blindly', 'bought', 'movie', 'just', 'hell', 'Flatliners', 'stars', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'one', 'Baldwins', 'course', 'Keifer.The', 'Flatliners', 'pretty', 'cool', 'movie', 'different', 'concept', 'genre', 'young', 'medical', 'students', 'experimenting', 'find', 'out', 'afterlife', 'come', 'back', 'afterlife', 'are', 'haunted', 'other', 'side.This', 'one', 'ultimate', 'quot', 'Do', 'not', 'do', 'home', 'quot', 'movies', 'saw', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'asking', 'friends', 'quot', 'How', 'much', 'money', 'would', 'do', 'quot', 'lol', 'bet', 'one', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'asking', 'friends.One', 'area', 'where', 'lacking', 'DVD', 'lacking', 'kind', 'special', 'features', 'interactive', 'menus', 'decently', 'layed', 'out', 'chapter', 'selection', 'honestly', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'DVD', 'terrible', 'compared', 'other', 'newer', 'DVDs', 'things', 'make', 'difference', 'fact', 'cheap', 'up', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'such', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'even', 'Mothman', 'Prophies', 'underrated', 'movie', 'probably', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'times', 'dark', 'sorta', 'twisted', 'always', 'track', 'never', 'bores', 'Definetly', 'check', 'movie', 'are', 'fan', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'shine', 'movie.Movie', 'grade', 'B+DVD', 'Grade', 'D-']",N/A
19751,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,0767831322,A Customer,"[2, 4]","Summary:Five medical students want to see what happens when you die: Nelson Wright (Kiefer Sutherland), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Joseph 'Joe' Hurley (William Baldwin), and Randal Steckle (Oliver Platt).  What they find is that there are things in their past of which they are not proud.My Comments:The premise is truly brilliant - it is a great question.  But why do they have to deal with their 'sins'?  It never really makes sense.  However, the impression I get is that someone is trying to push a 'Christian' theme on the viewers of the movie - what people need is something to atone for their sins.  However, even if this was the intent of the writers, I decided to take it a bit further and see the atonement taking place inside the people's minds - more of an atheistic approach.Anyway, that is really just my interpretation of the movie and not really much of a critique of the production.  I thought the acting was satisfactory, not Oscar worthy, but bearable.  The setting was fun, an old-school type medical school - something of a gothic feel to it.  I thought the movie was well done overall, though it was not always convincing.  Some of the scenes with Billy Mahoney (Joshua Rudoy) chasing Nelson weren't very convincing, even with the leeway of a dreamworld.  The movie tried too hard at times to be dark; sure, the experiment was dark, but it was also light in other ways, something they chose not to emphasize.Overall, if you enjoy movies that offer a topic to think about and are a bit on the dark side, you would probably enjoy this.

19754,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767831322,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","The idea behind `Flatliners' is one that is pretty provocative and intriguing to say the least.  Couple that with a cast that includes 90's queen Julia Roberts, the `other' Baldwin, Hollywood's prince Kiefer Sutherland and that guy everyone has either worked with or has worked with someone who has worked with him (not to mention a younger, slightly less pudgy Oliver Platt) and you have a film that everyone needs to see, or at least needs to want to see.Sadly, this was directed by Joel Schumacher.That isn't to say that Schumacher does a terrible job, it's just that he makes one of `his' movies and not the movie I wanted this to be.  The premise is SOOOO primed and ready for something strong and interesting and engaging and yet Schumacher chucks aside any real enlightenment or profound statements for cheap thrills that start off clever and then dive into silly and pretentious.  Thankfully Schumacher maintains a level of intensity thanks to sharp edits, stunning visual effects and cinematography milked in fear.  Those set pieces are remarkable and keep your eyes open throughout the traumatic experiences unfolding on screen.But, the most traumatic part of this film is that it feels like a lazy and cheap answer to the `horror' call.The film centers on a group of medical students pulled into a dangerous game by an ambitious and somewhat deranged student named Nelson.  Nelson wants to experience death, the afterlife.  He wants answers that religion and medicine have failed to give him, and so he conducts an experiment with his friends.  He stops his heart and crosses over, only to have his friends `bring him back' before he goes `all the way'.  With a little taste on his tongue he gets hungry for more, and the rest of his friends soon want to try themselves; the only problem being is that they bring something back with them from the other side.  Instead of finding any answers to `what's on the other side' they find haunted memories and face hallucinations that link to their past, causing them to seek out atonement for past sins.  Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with the premise, really.  I can understand, to a degree, the hallucinations facing Nelson and Rachel, but David and Joe's hallucinations seems unnecessary and make little sense at all (watch it and notice the BIG difference between them).  This, to me, is where this film went wrong.  It starts off with such a strong statement and promises something so much more than it delivers.  If it had ditched the desire to be a horror film and tried harder to bring its initial premise to full completion this could have been a real stunning piece of work.All actors involved are great.  Roberts and Sutherland shine the brightest, but Bacon and Baldwin both have their moments (this may be Bacon's best performance to date actually), but it is Sutherland who really ignites on screen with a ferocity that reminds me why I adore him so much.See it, but don't expect it to be as good as it could have been.",3,"It gets off to a stellar start, and then flatlines...",1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,2999,"['idea', 'Flatliners', 'one', 'pretty', 'provocative', 'intriguing', 'say', 'least', 'Couple', 'cast', '90', 'queen', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'other', 'Baldwin', 'Hollywood', 'prince', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'guy', 'everyone', 'worked', 'worked', 'someone', 'who', 'worked', 'not', 'mention', 'younger', 'slightly', 'less', 'pudgy', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'have', 'film', 'everyone', 'see', 'least', 'needs', 'want', 'see.Sadly', 'was', 'directed', 'Joel', 'Schumacher.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'Schumacher', 'terrible', 'job', 'just', 'one', 'movies', 'not', 'movie', 'wanted', 'be', 'premise', 'SOOOO', 'primed', 'ready', 'something', 'strong', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'yet', 'Schumacher', 'chucks', 'aside', 'real', 'enlightenment', 'profound', 'statements', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'start', 'clever', 'then', 'dive', 'silly', 'pretentious', 'Thankfully', 'Schumacher', 'level', 'intensity', 'thanks', 'sharp', 'edits', 'stunning', 'visual', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'milked', 'fear', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'remarkable', 'keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'traumatic', 'experiences', 'unfolding', 'screen.But', 'most', 'traumatic', 'part', 'film', 'lazy', 'cheap', 'answer', 'horror', 'call.The', 'film', 'centers', 'group', 'medical', 'students', 'pulled', 'dangerous', 'game', 'ambitious', 'somewhat', 'deranged', 'student', 'named', 'Nelson', 'Nelson', 'experience', 'death', 'afterlife', 'answers', 'religion', 'medicine', 'have', 'failed', 'give', 'so', 'experiment', 'friends', 'heart', 'crosses', 'only', 'have', 'friends', 'bring', 'back', 'way', 'little', 'taste', 'tongue', 'hungry', 'more', 'rest', 'friends', 'soon', 'want', 'try', 'only', 'problem', 'being', 'bring', 'something', 'back', 'other', 'side', 'Instead', 'finding', 'answers', 'what', 'other', 'side', 'find', 'haunted', 'memories', 'face', 'hallucinations', 'link', 'past', 'causing', 'seek', 'out', 'atonement', 'past', 'sins', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'do', 'premise', 'really', 'can', 'understand', 'degree', 'hallucinations', 'facing', 'Nelson', 'Rachel', 'David', 'Joe', 'hallucinations', 'unnecessary', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'watch', 'notice', 'BIG', 'difference', 'where', 'film', 'went', 'wrong', 'strong', 'statement', 'promises', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'had', 'ditched', 'desire', 'be', 'horror', 'film', 'tried', 'harder', 'bring', 'initial', 'premise', 'full', 'completion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'stunning', 'piece', 'work.All', 'actors', 'involved', 'are', 'great', 'Roberts', 'Sutherland', 'shine', 'brightest', 'Bacon', 'Baldwin', 'have', 'moments', 'may', 'be', 'Bacon', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'actually', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'really', 'screen', 'ferocity', 'why', 'adore', 'so', 'much.See', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Like Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, this film cannot be considered an all-time  classic due to a highly opinionated viewpoint that may deeply offend some  viewers. However, as far as direction, acting and suspense are concerned,  few films rival Flatliners in its all-around splendor. Underneath a  deceptively linear and seemingly simplistic script, there is much symbolism  and underlying subtlety to be found in Schumacher's brilliant vision.  Unlike the roller-coaster scenes of The Lost Boys that never materialize to  be anything more than a misplaced piece of high-style imagery, the eerie,  sometimes sacrilegious images that are thrown into the plot of Flatliners  in a seemingly random fashion (the statues observed by the main character  in the beginning, the merciless display of surgical operations) serve their  purpose in implying the motivations and internal conflicts of the  characters.

19760,AE42JLYPXUI45,0767831322,"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)""","[0, 0]","When I saw this movie for the first time, I was scared sh*tless. This movie was just outstanding in every way. I had never heard of it and I decided to watch the whole thing. I was up from 2:00 am to 4:00 am (in Philly), watching this movie, since that was the time it came on when I saw it first. I was dead tired, but nothing was gonna stop me from watching this movie all the way through and I'll tell you why.Five med students: Nelson Wright (played by Kiefer Sutherland), Rachel Manus (played by Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (played by William Baldwin), David Labraccio (played by Kevin Bacon), and Randy Steckle (played by Oliver Platt) are five best friends, who want to experience what it feels like to be temporarily dead. One by one, each of the five friends are put under the gas until their brain and heart functions are shut down, where they'll be exploring the afterlife. Nelson is the first to go through with the experimental experience. As he is temporarily in the afterlife, he sees something he has kept hidden secret for the past seventeen years: he and three other guys accidentally killed an innocent kid named Billy Mahoney, an innocent little kid that Nelson used to pick on. Nelson is successfully brought back to life. Joe is the next one to go under. As he experiences the afterlife, he begins to see all of the women he has slept with and then dumped. The worse part of that is: with each girl he dated, he videotaped while he had sex with them, where he is then brought back to life successfully. David is an atheist, who is more than just a little skeptical about this experience. Wanting to prove Joe and Nelson wrong, David ends up being the next one to go through the experience, where he sees a little girl named Winnie Hicks, an innocent little girl that he and some friends used to harass. They successfully bring David back to life. Rachel is aching to try the experiment. She proves that she can be under for five minutes, longer than Joe, Nelson, and David. So, she goes under. What she sees is the horrible suicide of her father, and she is successfully brought back to life. Randy decides not to go through with the experiment.As the days go on, the other four begin seeing horrifying things. Everywhere Joe walks, he sees the women he had videotaped, whilst they had sex. Everywhere Dave goes, he sees the image of Winnie Hicks. Everywhere Rachel goes, she sees the image of her father's corpse. Everywhere Nelson goes, he begins seeing poor little Billy. But when he sees Billy, Billy bashes him in the face with something, scarring Nelson's face all over. These images are not just images, but their past sins, the people, whom they have severely wronged. The only way to stop these sins from appearing is to reconcile. David decides to track down Winnie Hicks and apologize with all his heart. He does so and Winnie more than warmly accepts. Joe settles his homemade porno escapade after his fianc&eacute; leaves him; not because he cheated on her, but because he slept with the other women and dropped them off like they were pieces of (...). Rachel has reconciled by letting go of the guilt she felt over her father. Nelson cannot reconcile with his sin, for he feels more than responsible for the death of Billy Mahoney. Nelson feels that he deserves to die and never return. He runs back to the lab and puts himself under, where he has another vision of him and friends picking on Billy, but this time, the vision is reversed, showing Billy and Nelson's friends picking on Nelson. As Billy throws the last rock, in which it knocks Billy out of a tree, as Nelson did Billy, Nelson finds himself looking as he does now, at the age of 26. He lands on the ground and seems to be dead. Is it possible that Nelson might night return to the living or will he remain in the afterlife?I was completely horrified by this movie. It made me not want to ever pick on innocent little children. It made me not want to have sex with women while secretly videotaping them. It made not want to ever try this experience...ever. But this is a movie that everybody should have enjoyed.

19766,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767831322,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 10]","The premise of this horror lite venture in movie making is that if one is dead for only a few minutes and then brought back to life before the brain damage sets in, one might very well experience what it's like being dead, and that experience might be glorious and one might learn something nobody else knows, or at least something to tell them about on Sixty Minutes.  Anyway, this is what med student Nelson Wright, played with energy and intensity by Kiefer Sutherland, thinks.  Somehow he convinces four other med students, Joe Hurley (William Baldwin), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), and Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) to help him out.Problem number one is that I don't think director Joel Schumacher sold this shaky premise sufficiently.  We really need to believe that this group of med students could be flaky enough to risk their careers and their lives for an iffy few minutes of a supposed after life experience.  For me it just wasn't happening, and I think that is why this movie starts slow and remains relatively unfocused for the first twenty minutes or so.Problem number two is the casting of Julia Roberts as Rachel Mannus.  This was the same year she did Pretty Woman (1990) with Richard Gere and became a box office sensation.  She looks gorgeous in the dark red and blue tinted lights, but it's not enough to put some specs on her and make us believe she's a daredevil pre med student.  And let me ask you this, mightn't all that serious hair get in the way when she slices into those cadavers?  She is one of my favorites with that face like no other, but her work here was limited, inconsistent and a bit preoccupied.  Still Julia is always worth watching.Problem number three is the lighting.  All that dim lighting just doesn't mesh well with med school chic.  Med students like to see what they're doing when they're digging into all that viscera.  And if your job is to bring a friend back from the dead, you want a clean, well-lighted room, please.Okay, putting all that aside, and accepting the premise, just how bad was this movie?  Well, not all that bad really.  The cast does a good job, particularly Sutherland who was apparently psyched for the part, and Bacon.  The idea that we are responsible for our actions and must pay the consequences for evils done to others is a compelling notion well illustrated.  I particularly liked the haunting of Joe Hurley by all the girls he hustled and told lies to and videotaped without their knowledge.  Those babes are looking a little ugly now, dude.  Call it karma.  The little boy who stalks Nelson Wright is chilling and Rachel Mannus's depressing father is very sad.  After a bit the movie even gets a little scary.  But I had a thought en route: What if we substitute the post death experience of the participants in this little star chamber club with some bad acid trips?  How much would their experience differ, really?Bottom line: I don't think TV's &quot;Fear Factor&quot; is going to be featuring this one anytime soon.  But wouldn't they love to do it?  Think of the ratings.

19768,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,0767831322,drkhimxz,"[0, 1]","I see that this is a 1990 movie, so, presumably,  everyone but me, has had a chance to see and form an opinion about it. From what  people tell me Kiefer Sutherland and Julia Roberts have gone on to great success and I have heard the name Kevin Bacon. This has to be taken, therefore, as a bright opening up of careers for a number of actors. As a film, it  held me in its grip through its pseudo-scientific scientists (medical students) and the effectiveness of some of their post-death experiences. Can't ask for much more than that in a DVD. That the ""sins"" which were brought to life by death were trivial is beside the point; no good Freudian would question the impact of such memories on the normal adult. Somehow, however,  in a film propounding the profound significance of what these experimenters did, the kind of memories brought forward  hardly made the grade, save in one case. Nevertheless, as I said, the film intrigued and should entertain those who may not have seen it.Why do I (as the four experimenters do) place this in the long line of films propounding a sectarian religious thesis? Simple! It reaffirms the afterlife experience so central to the religious thought of many. That is, even while showing clearly negative responses to these experiences, it is reinforcing the notion that there are afterthoughts even though brain dead. No matter. One can deal with that element anyway one chooses and still be caught up in the film.Writing some years after the previous sentences. Having just seen the disc again, I was ready to write my review (having, of course, forgotten that I had done so following the original viewing). For whatever interest it has: I found myself framing the same opening thought and, during the film, having had the same reaction vis-a-vis religion.

19772,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0767831322,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","A film that reveals the unease of modern men and women in life when confronted to death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. Yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can push it away for quite a long time. What's more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. That was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. Today things are changing, especially when the president of the United States himself, Barack Obama, in a public speech to journalists speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end, objective or achievement. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that was starting to evolve into a truth obsession, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly reachable. Post modernism had not reached Hollywood yet, though today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back. Technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. It reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious. One has to do with a drug addicted father of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death tripper included, another still with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in grade school out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness. It is so nave that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice. The film though is interesting but in something quite different. The setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of any detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, quite in the style of ""Death in Venice"" or Greenaway, or some other works of art that deal with making friends with the basic enemy that  death is. Of course that does not save the film but at least that makes it worth watching.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",4,The childish frontier of fear and guilt,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,2394,"['film', 'unease', 'modern', 'men', 'women', 'life', 'when', 'confronted', 'death', 'are', 'simple', 'religious', 'belief', 'afterlife', 'what', 'more', 'kind', 'hell', 'heaven', 'Religion', 'declared', 'dead', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'more', 'obsessed', 'ever', 'death', 'especially', 'can', 'push', 'away', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'What', 'more', 'scientific', 'technological', 'development', 'societies', 'believe', 'can', 'explain', 'everything', 'know', 'everything', 'do', 'everything', 'was', 'quite', 'typical', 'end', '20th', 'century', 'Today', 'things', 'are', 'changing', 'especially', 'when', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'public', 'speech', 'journalists', 'speaks', 'search', 'truth', 'qualifies', 'truth', 'being', 'course', 'relative', 'more', 'quest', 'final', 'end', 'objective', 'achievement', 'film', 'end', 'good', 'old', 'metaphysical', 'thinking', 'was', 'starting', 'evolve', 'truth', 'obsession', 'obsessive', 'conception', 'truth', 'was', 'unique', 'irreversibly', 'reachable', 'Post', 'modernism', 'had', 'not', 'reached', 'Hollywood', 'yet', 'today', 'have', 'reached', 'White', 'House', 'young', 'doctors', 'medical', 'students', 'decide', 'go', 'death', 'come', 'back', 'Technically', 'possible', 'result', 'not', 'surprising', 'old', 'guilty', 'feelings', 'frustrations', 'had', 'been', 'buried', 'unconscious', 'One', 'do', 'drug', 'addicted', 'father', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'who', 'suicide', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'stoned', 'death', 'others', 'death', 'tripper', 'included', 'still', 'young', 'black', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'victimized', 'bullied', 'grade', 'school', 'racism', 'sexism', 'hatred', 'not', 'fear', 'front', 'shyness', 'so', 'nave', 'could', 'cry', 'shame', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'highly', 'qualified', 'behave', 'babies', 'who', 'are', 'crying', 'bottles', 'edulcorated', 'fruit', 'juice', 'film', 'interesting', 'something', 'quite', 'different', 'setting', 'shooting', 'single', 'detail', 'treatment', 'detail', 'baroque', 'morbid', 'decadent', 'quite', 'style', 'Death', 'Venice', 'Greenaway', 'other', 'works', 'art', 'deal', 'making', 'friends', 'basic', 'enemy', 'death', 'course', 'not', 'save', 'film', 'least', 'worth', 'watching.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",N/A

The set pieces are gorgeous (especially at the college campus) and I can't help but wonder if Schumacher was influenced by Mario Bava, Dario Argento, Sergio Martino and other Italian directors of suspense and mystery.Five future super stars lead the stellar cast.  They include Kiefer Sutherland (""The Lost Boys""), Julia Roberts (""Mary Reilley"") and Kevin Bacon (""Friday the 13th"").  Sutherland convinces his fellow friends and medical students to explore the realm of life after death by experiencing a controlled cardiac arrest and flatlining.  Naturally, the results are disastrous.  Each one brings something back with them:  the physical manifestation of their sins.  The star, Sutherland, has the worst experience.  A demonic little boy in a red jacket (resembling the killer in the yellow slicker of ""Don't Look Now"" and ""Alice, Sweet Alice"") darts in and out of Sutherland's life, beating him mercilessly with fists and weapons.  These scenes, and many others, are extremely creepy, disturbing, and frightful.Despite its gloomy, gothic atmosphere of fog and mist and deterioration of warehouses and cemeteries, ""Flatliners"" leaves the viewer with hope.  Forgiveness is the key.  Asking those we have hurt for forgiveness will break us free from the nightmares of our past deeds that continue to haunt us.""Flatliners"" is highly recommended for lovers of modern gothic horror.  It is for anyone who has ever pondered what lies beyond death's door.

In a land where the best ideas they can come up with is remakes, sequels, and comic book characters... there's this film. I truely think this movie possesses what most don't these days...originality! Plus, it's so ahead of it's time in storyline which is a good thing. I have to say that I was extremely impressed with Keifer Sutherland, William Baldwin, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts, and Oliver Platt. Even in their younger days they all make a terrific cast, and they all manage to pull this complex script off effortlessly. This movie is about a group of friends and medical students who are curious whether or not there is a such thing as ""life after death"" and if so ""what's out there""? I think what makes this movie so interesting is that they actually go so far as to literally cause themselves to ""flatline"" deliberately to get these answers. Basically, it's suicide on their part they just have their friends around to keep track of what time they actually die, revive them before they are permanently brain damaged, or they actually stay dead altogether. I can't imagine killing myself on purpose, and then relying on my friends to ""bring me back"". Even the thought is just a little twisted, but in this case, twisted good..not bad!. However, what their good friend Nelson (who goes first might I add) doesn't let them in on is that he's brought back a nightmare from his past with him. I think the underlying message of this movie is about not only your past coming back to haunt you, but the closure and redemption you must seek in your past sins before your soul can truely be at ease. In my opinion, this is some of Kevin Bacon's best work with the exceptions of the sadistic reform school guard he played in Sleepers and the eccentric he played in Stir of Echoes.

Careful not to signpost too many of the inherent religious overtones, Peter Filardi's script provides roles for some of Hollywood's Brightest Young Things (Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, amongst others) as unlikely med students whose experiments with the near-death experience (NDE) leads inevitably to a confrontation with the sins of their past.Ignoring the wider implications of the NDE, Filardi and Schumacher focus instead on the individual traumas of their glamorous cast, thereby trivialising the subject. Nonetheless, the film certainly LOOKS spectacular, employing an outr&eacute; lighting scheme and a fabulous neo-Gothic set design as a means of illustrating the narrative's thematic concerns, though a handful of critics appear to have wilfully misread this aspect of the production.

It is a creative and interesting premise along the lines of so many classics, including, of course, Frankenstein, The Fly (the re-make, especially), and The Man With the X-Ray Eyes.  Of course, there will be hell to pay for ""going where Man ought not go.""  Oh yes, there'll be hell!But where the movie fails is in its rather silly, preachy lecture on the consequences of these actions.  I won't give it away here, but the film turns into a cheap spin on a familiar ghost story, something done to much better effect in The Sixth Sense.  The acting is just average, with Julia Roberts looking better than average, and constraining her hideous laugh, but the rest just mailing it in--with one exception.  Kevin Bacon.

This is definitely living life on the edge. Led by the manic Nelson played  appropriately by Kiefer Sutherland and Rachel, a very tense but competent  Julia Roberts this disparate group decide to go further where no man or  woman has gone before, and returned to tell the tale.

The movie has Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, Alec Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland as university students that can bring a person to the point of death and then bring them back to life so that they can describe their near-death experience.  This is without doubt an intriguing premise and the movie does well to focus on the horrific hallucinations that the group experience rather than on the religious connotations.  Whether it's Kevin Bacon seeing a small child singing to him on the subway or whether it's another kid with a baseball bat, the theme of the past coming back to haunt you is well evoked and genuinely creepy at times.  The near death experiences themselves are also visually arresting.However, this could have been done better, and there are several holes in its plot such as the innocence of children and whether they really deserve to be haunted by what they did when they were younger.

19796,A2A1XYSB692L6J,0767831322,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[2, 2]","""FLATLINERS"", a movie starring Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, and Kevin Bacon, is suspenseful, and eminently sit-throughable.  Even someone like me -- who often cannot watch movies through from beginning to end, (due, I believe, from having my attention-span blasted to smithereens by decades of watching TV....with commercials interrupting the action every fifteen minutes or so), watched THIS movie from beginning to end -- with only one unavoidable break, when a neighbour came to the door to tell me I had a large package downstairs....After getting the package, (from Amazon, I might add), inside my door, I rushed back to see the rest of this movie!  It has an intriguing premise -- and it is well produced, directed, and acted -- with wonderful camera work, and scene-setting, melodic and atmospheric music....Basically, the story revolves around Keifer Sutherland's character -- a medical student who is interested in seeing what happens, (and if anything does happen), after a person dies.  But he also wants to come back again.  So, he enlists the help of four of his friends, (also medical students), to help him.  Later, all but one of his friends also undergoes a ""flat-lined"" few minutes.  After these experiences....well, to tell more would be to ruin the plot for those who have not as yet seen the movie, (and/or read the book).  But the story does continue on. er....plot-lines....generated out from the beginning of the original ground-work (ground-work????!)....set in the beginning of the movie.  The beginning of the movie sets up a fascinating premise, (what, if anything, DOES happen after death?) But what comes afterwards seems a bit forced to me -- but then, where else could the plot have gone?  I read in one of the other reviews that the BOOK from which this movie is taken is somewhat different than the film....but as to how different, I don't know...I chose this particular version of the DVD, because it is the ""Sci-Fi Essentials"" version, put out by the Scifi, (or, as it is now called, the ""SyFy"") channel.  I expected some extras in this edition, because of this.....Well, the only ""extra"" here that I can find is that this disk, (which plays on both sides), has a ""Wide-Screen"" version on one side, and an ""Full-Screen"" version on the other side.  I have only seen this type of DVD production, (playable on both sides), with one other DVD -- or rather, on a DVD set...""Alien Nation - The Series"".  In one of rhe reviews of this 3-disc set, it is stated that producing DVDs that are playable on both sides can shorten the playable life of any disc.  Thus, if one wants to watch both the full-screen and wide-screen version of ""Flatliners"", one needs to be extra-careful with this disc.  (It really is a pity that both versions were not included here on two discs, or that a buyer is not given the choice of either buying the full-screen or wide-screen version.  At least, not in the ""Sci-Fi Essentials"" verson, put out by the SyFy Channel....)However, upon opening the DVD case, I was delighted to find a paper insert,to the left of the disc.  This insert says, (in BIG lettering):********PREPARE TO BE SCARED.... To unlock the all-new spooky special features you won't find anywhere else, long on to [...] and enter the code at the bottom of the page.*********Oh, boy, I thought -- Easter Eggs!  For those who don't know, ""Easter Eggs"" are extra little, (or not so little) features that makers of software sometimes put in, out of either boredom, or wanting to make themselves known...............or, more often, just to make themselves feel good, by the secret knowledge that putting these little ""presents"" into their software will make the buyers of thsi software happy!  So, ""Easter Eggs"" are secret little ""exras"", which can be found only by entering the correct keys or key-codes.  Usually, they are on software -- this is the first time that I, at least, have found them put onto a DVD!Excitedly, I put the web-address and ""secret code"", given on the paper, into my browser.  And --------- wouldn't you know it, a page stating that ""this promotion can no longer be found or is outdated"", or words to that effect, came up. Talk about leaving viewers of this particular version of the ""Flatliners"" DVD, flat!Even though they originally may have been only promos for other movies, (for all I know), I was GREATLY disappointed not to find any ""Easter Eggs"", as promised -- and there was NOT even any experation date on the notice, to warn me that this might happen.Amd so, the biggest mystery of all, (for me and other ""late buyers"" of this DVD), remains to be -- WHAT did I miss in the special promo?Other than two screen-sizes for this movie, there are NO extras.  No intrerviews, no commentary, no ""making of"" featurette.  There is ONE still from the movie on the back of the DVD.  Although -- like most of the movie -- it is artistically and atmospherically shot, in it, Kiefer Sutherland's long coat hangs about him SO loosely, that it seems at first glance that he is wearing an outfit of clown's overalls: which, upon closer examination can be seen NOT to be the case.Although this movie IS suspenseful, I would not agree with the quote on the back, which was made by TV-critic Joel Siegel of WABC-TV, who said: ""Susspense to die from!  So exciting your heart might stop.""  No -- I don't think so....but to be on the safe side, I'd see this movie first, before letting any very sensitive friendsor relatives see it -- especially, any friends or relatives, (sensitive or not), who wear pace-makers.Is this movie different from the book?  Well, I've ordered the book, and will see.I may not be able to report on the entire book....but I will try to read the last chapter or two, to see if there is any difference...,",4,"D O E

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[4, 6]","Flatliners is a horrific exploration of after-death experiences, directed with taut suspense by Joel Schumacher (The Client, Batman Forever, The Lost Boys). It's about five medical students led by Kiefer Sutherland (The Lost Boys) carelessly experimenting with death.Each wants a turn as one at a time they bring each other to the brink with their medical know-how, reviving the volunteer within seconds - at first, then daring each other to go for longer periods of minutes.  After Sutherland's experience he finds a child from his past haunting him, but hides his hallucinations from the others.  William Baldwin (Backdraft) goes next, and after his experience he sees reflections of his sins - selfish promiscuity, primarily - everywhere around him.  Kevin Bacon (The River Wild, White Water Summer, A Stir Of Echoes) is next, before the results of the first two are revealed, then Julia Roberts (Pretty Woman, Conspiracy Theory), who insists on her turn in spite of the growing fears of the others.  The fifth member of their group is Oliver Platt (Simon Birch, A Time To Kill).The original idea, at the time the film was created, is fascinating as well as scary, and a precursor to such later efforts as White Noise.  Unfortunately there's a great deal of foul language, considerable violence, and unnecessary sex with partial nudity (particularly in illustration of Baldwin's case). I say ""unfortunately"" because otherwise I'd like to show the film to everyone, the idea is so good, and effectively delivers a good message - ""everything we do matters.""  But as it is, it's not suitable for children, and certainly offensive to many older viewers.

It was awesome.(I keep checking the screenplay websites to see if the original draft by Peter Filardi gets out but I haven't seen it yet).A year later, I went to see the movie.  Do the initials ""WTF"" mean anything to you?About halfway through, I wondered what was going wrong.  ""I don't remember reading THAT.""  By the end, I couldn't believe what I was seeing: an incredible screenplay had been completely destroyed.I went to the folks who'd slipped me the script and asked what in the world happened to FLATLINERS.  They were as bummed out as I was.Apparently, Joel Shumacher didn't like the spiritual aspects of the script.  So he threw them out.  Let me repeat that: he made a movie about the afterlife--and threw out the spiritual aspects of it.  That's like making a musical and deciding that nobody would want to hear all that singing.Then one of the stars became a Big Star going into production.  Her people said, ""She's a Big Star now and she can't do anything wrong.""I could just imagine someone with a brain asking, ""But the premise of the film is that everyone has done something wrong and it comes back to haunt them.""""No.  You don't understand.  She's a Big Star and nobody wants to see her do anything wrong...and she won't.""So they butchered the script to satisfy the Big Star.The heroin-addicted Vietnam Vet Daddy sequence replaced an exciting subplot of a professor wrongly accused of sexual harassment who killed himself and comes back to haunt the female lead.  The ending was great, tying up every strand and leaving on a high note for the survivors.  GONE.I actually read an article in Fangoria (or maybe it was Starlog) where Joel Shumacher brags--BRAGS--about their ghastly butchering of the original script by himself and the Big Star Who Can't Do Anything Wrong.For those of you who wonder why movies are so bad: THIS is how that happens.Peter, I feel for you buddy.

19813,ABLBRUT8DALNN,0767831322,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","By this point, Flatliners is know as a cult classic and one of the first major roles for Julia Roberts. There was little doubt that the performances in this film would be off the charts good, as for the film itself, not so much. Five Med. students, at the top of their class, decide to experiment with near death experiences to see if there really is an after live, and what they find, was not at all what they expected. The premise of this story is terrific and you couldn't have a better cast or Director, but for me, the film never really clicked. As with sports teams, just because you have the most talent, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have any chemistry, that was part of the problem here. While all the cast members were terrific in their individual roles, they were so different, that when they got together it didn't really work out so well. As for the movie itself, it has a very unique plot, but the story doesn't do it justice. As a viewer, I was expecting a lot more to happen especially when they keep dialing up the drama. Elements of the story build and build, but ultimately fall flat. The premise was a good one and the performances were terrific, but the story of the flatliners falls well short of expectations. For all you die hard cult followers, don't worry you'll soon have something to complain about too, as a remake for the 25th anniversary of the films release is already in the works.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,1433,"['point', 'Flatliners', 'know', 'cult', 'classic', 'one', 'first', 'major', 'roles', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'was', 'little', 'doubt', 'performances', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'off', 'charts', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Five', 'Med', 'students', 'top', 'class', 'decide', 'experiment', 'near', 'death', 'experiences', 'see', 'really', 'live', 'what', 'find', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'premise', 'story', 'terrific', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'better', 'cast', 'Director', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'clicked', 'sports', 'teams', 'just', 'have', 'most', 'talent', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'chemistry', 'was', 'part', 'problem', 'here', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'terrific', 'individual', 'roles', 'were', 'so', 'different', 'when', 'got', 'together', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'movie', 'very', 'unique', 'plot', 'story', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'viewer', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'happen', 'especially', 'when', 'keep', 'dialing', 'up', 'drama', 'Elements', 'story', 'build', 'build', 'ultimately', 'fall', 'flat', 'premise', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'performances', 'were', 'terrific', 'story', 'flatliners', 'falls', 'well', 'short', 'expectations', 'die', 'hard', 'cult', 'followers', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'have', 'something', 'complain', 'too', 'remake', '25th', 'anniversary', 'films', 'release', 'already', 'works']",N/A

Philosiphy and Religion has failed to tell us what exactly happens after death. So for five young medical students, its now up to Advance Science. Nelson(Keifer Sutherland)comes up with an ingenious plan to kill himself so he can explore, and have his friends(Bacon, Roberts, Platt, and Baldwin) bring him back to life. But when their experiment turns into a bidding war, bad things start to happen. The experiment becomes more and more dangerous and when its to late, they find out that they did not come back alone. They are being haunted. Flatliners is the most haunting, metaphorical movie you ever want to see. The ending is brilliant and jaw dropping.

I generally can't stand any of the Baldwins. So, needless to say I approached this movie expecting extreme sexualism without the storyline benifiting and otherwise a gaudy film.But watching this movie was a surprise -- it is actually very good -- even the sex scenes in the movie turns out to be elemental to the furthering of the story even if not in a central way.I am also a limited view of horror and thrillers -- this is neither nor is it a blend of both.What is probably the most refreshng about this movie was the non-theophobic nature of the film without it being a relgious rip-off by hollywood type film.By the title or the actors, I would NEVER have thought to add this movie to my collection but now I most definately will.All the actors play their characters well, the humor is just the right amount to soften the deepness of the story making it all much more palletable. This is a movie that I think would become a lost treasure if they ever tried to do a remake -- and I doubt I would even consider watching one if it came -- remakes would only take away expecially in today's theophobic propaganda loading big brother touting hollywood.Would I recommend this movie -- YesWould I go to the theater to watch it re-released in the media - YesWould you be a fool for not watching it -- YesWill you like it when you watch it -- Yes, especially if you are into movies that carry a compelling drama that is not loaded with base sexuality without being a component to the story itself.",5,Fantastic beyond all accounting,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,1650,"['am', 'not', 'fan', 'Sutherland', 'Bacon', 'mildly', 'appreciative', 'Roberts', 'overall', 'acting', 'perhaps', 'association', 'bad', 'boy', 'pack', 'day', 'generally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Baldwins', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'approached', 'movie', 'expecting', 'extreme', 'sexualism', 'storyline', 'benifiting', 'otherwise', 'gaudy', 'film.But', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'surprise', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'elemental', 'furthering', 'story', 'even', 'not', 'central', 'way.I', 'am', 'also', 'limited', 'view', 'horror', 'thrillers', 'blend', 'both.What', 'probably', 'most', 'refreshng', 'movie', 'was', 'non-theophobic', 'nature', 'film', 'being', 'relgious', 'rip-off', 'hollywood', 'type', 'title', 'actors', 'would', 'NEVER', 'have', 'thought', 'add', 'movie', 'collection', 'now', 'most', 'definately', 'will.All', 'actors', 'play', 'characters', 'well', 'humor', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'soften', 'deepness', 'story', 'making', 'all', 'much', 'more', 'palletable', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'become', 'lost', 'treasure', 'ever', 'tried', 'do', 'remake', 'doubt', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'watching', 'one', 'came', 'remakes', 'would', 'only', 'take', 'away', 'expecially', 'today', 'theophobic', 'propaganda', 'loading', 'big', 'brother', 'touting', 'hollywood.Would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'go', 'theater', 'watch', 're-released', 'media', 'YesWould', 'be', 'fool', 'not', 'watching', 'YesWill', 'when', 'watch', 'Yes', 'especially', 'are', 'movies', 'carry', 'compelling', 'drama', 'not', 'loaded', 'base', 'sexuality', 'being', 'component', 'story']",N/A
