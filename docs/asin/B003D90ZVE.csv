1337119,A2SJ58PICEF67,B003D90ZVE,Robert K. Fries,"[5, 5]","This video has much going for it. It was a major production. The quality and detail are very good. A lot of research went into the accuracy of producing it. There are both 2 hour and 3 hour dvd productions. I recommend the product that contains BOTH dvds. Henry Ian Cusick (from the tv series LOST) did a good job presenting what Jesus may have ""acted"" like as He continued to live out His prophetic message to a world never ready for it. I loved the bold, face to face attempts He made to enlighten the leadership of the Jerusalem Temple. Cusick portrays the love that Jesus displayed towards those who hated Him for what He was doing to their concept of the ancient Jewish faith. Of the few film accounts of John's Gospel I believe this to be the best theatrical production and the MOST complete and accurate as such.  If you believe the Bible to be a true record, and are a visual person, you will greatly value the insight that a highly detailed, visual persentaion offers.",5,"Robust quality!
