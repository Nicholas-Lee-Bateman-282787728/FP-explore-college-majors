882937,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0007MANZ8,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Philosophers and social thinkers from Plato to Marx had commented in their various treatises on the hol d that gold has held for a significant portion of humankind. Whether to wear it, carry it, or to miserly hoard it that quest for the yellow fever stuff had animated more than one human saga. And it does so here in a saga of the Old West, the old American West, Lust for Gold, a title that says it all, and that saw more than one feverish dream go up in smoke or vanish under an off-hand bullet. The road west was paved with the litter of the whitened bones of many such dreams.This little black and white B-film is done in a flash- back as a grandson of the  man who the story centers on, Jacob Walz, is knee-deep in his exploration of the quest for the yellow stuff, stuff that his grandfather  allegedly found in the hills of  the West, the Arizona west.  The idea behind the film was to show that, once again, men, and women, can get their thinking skewed by the desire get rich quick with a little strike, a little yellow stuff.Now this Jacob Walz (played by Glenn Ford) is not your typical Western cowboy of film lore, some waspy John Wayne, but a tinhorn, although a tinhorn quick on the trigger and quick with the back of his hand German, from back East who came west, like a million others, to find his place in the sun. His place in the sun was to strike it rich in the gold fields, not by digging and sweating himself but by finding a version of El Dorado, finding the lost mine gold fields which some earlier Spanish adventurers  had mined, and lost, after being massacred by the Comanches who took exception the desecration of their burial ground where the gold was found . And he does find the end of the rainbow after getting rid of  (killing off) his partner and a couple of wreak-less sons of the Spanish conquistidores who got the madness which started way back when looking for oro that drove their forebears across that dangerous Atlantic in search of treasure.Of course those finds were only the start of Jacob Walz's problems, his everyday problems as everybody in the greater Arizona area began to take dead aim at him to find out where his stake was and take their own shots at it. And of course this being a film, a romance of the Old West film, a dame (played by Ida Lupino), a married dame, enters into the plot to bring Brother Walz down. Ida was tired, tired unto death of her nickel and dime existence out in the arid West and tired unto death of her ne'er-do-well husband so she used her vast feminine wiles to snag Glenn in order to get that gold dream of hers into shape . In the end though Ida's perfidy, extreme perfidy, Glenn's mania, and the natural elements combined to close out our saga on a down note. The found lost goldmine was lost once again for that itchy grandson (and others) to pick up the trail. Yeah, the stuff of dreams, yet again.",3,The Stuff Of Dreams#27,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,2886,"['Philosophers', 'social', 'thinkers', 'Plato', 'Marx', 'had', 'commented', 'various', 'treatises', 'hol', 'd', 'gold', 'held', 'significant', 'portion', 'humankind', 'Whether', 'wear', 'miserly', 'hoard', 'quest', 'yellow', 'fever', 'stuff', 'had', 'animated', 'more', 'one', 'human', 'saga', 'so', 'here', 'saga', 'Old', 'West', 'old', 'American', 'West', 'Lust', 'Gold', 'title', 'saw', 'more', 'one', 'feverish', 'dream', 'go', 'up', 'smoke', 'vanish', 'off-hand', 'bullet', 'road', 'west', 'was', 'paved', 'litter', 'whitened', 'bones', 'many', 'such', 'dreams.This', 'little', 'black', 'white', 'B-film', 'done', 'flash-', 'back', 'grandson', 'man', 'who', 'story', 'centers', 'Jacob', 'Walz', 'knee-deep', 'exploration', 'quest', 'yellow', 'stuff', 'stuff', 'grandfather', 'allegedly', 'found', 'hills', 'West', 'Arizona', 'west', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'show', 'once', 'again', 'men', 'women', 'can', 'get', 'thinking', 'skewed', 'desire', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'little', 'strike', 'little', 'yellow', 'stuff.Now', 'Jacob', 'Walz', 'played', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'not', 'typical', 'Western', 'cowboy', 'film', 'lore', 'waspy', 'John', 'Wayne', 'tinhorn', 'tinhorn', 'quick', 'trigger', 'quick', 'back', 'hand', 'German', 'back', 'East', 'who', 'came', 'west', 'million', 'others', 'find', 'place', 'sun', 'place', 'sun', 'was', 'strike', 'rich', 'gold', 'fields', 'not', 'digging', 'sweating', 'finding', 'version', 'El', 'Dorado', 'finding', 'lost', 'mine', 'gold', 'fields', 'earlier', 'Spanish', 'adventurers', 'had', 'mined', 'lost', 'being', 'massacred', 'Comanches', 'who', 'took', 'exception', 'desecration', 'burial', 'ground', 'where', 'gold', 'was', 'found', 'find', 'end', 'rainbow', 'getting', 'rid', 'killing', 'off', 'partner', 'couple', 'wreak-less', 'sons', 'Spanish', 'conquistidores', 'who', 'got', 'madness', 'started', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'looking', 'oro', 'drove', 'forebears', 'dangerous', 'Atlantic', 'search', 'treasure.Of', 'course', 'finds', 'were', 'only', 'start', 'Jacob', 'Walz', 'problems', 'everyday', 'problems', 'everybody', 'greater', 'Arizona', 'area', 'began', 'take', 'dead', 'aim', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'stake', 'was', 'take', 'own', 'shots', 'course', 'being', 'film', 'romance', 'Old', 'West', 'film', 'dame', 'played', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'married', 'dame', 'enters', 'plot', 'bring', 'Brother', 'Walz', 'down', 'Ida', 'was', 'tired', 'tired', 'unto', 'death', 'nickel', 'dime', 'existence', 'arid', 'West', 'tired', 'unto', 'death', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'husband', 'used', 'vast', 'feminine', 'wiles', 'snag', 'Glenn', 'order', 'get', 'gold', 'dream', 'hers', 'shape', 'end', 'Ida', 'perfidy', 'extreme', 'perfidy', 'Glenn', 'mania', 'natural', 'elements', 'combined', 'close', 'out', 'saga', 'down', 'note', 'found', 'lost', 'goldmine', 'was', 'lost', 'once', 'again', 'itchy', 'grandson', 'others', 'pick', 'up', 'trail', 'Yeah', 'stuff', 'dreams', 'yet', 'again']",N/A

882940,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0007MANZ8,C. O. DeRiemer,"[21, 21]","This forgotten gem is an A movie trying to break out of a B movie's conventions. Even as a B movie, if it had been directed by Edgar Ulmer many people would be raving over it. But it was directed by a man named S. Sylvan Simon who died of a heart attack in his forties. This was his last movie, and it has been forgotten just about as thoroughly as he has.It's the story of the Lost Dutchman Mine, a rich gold mine lost, then discovered again, and then apparently lost forever. It's the story of Jacob ""Dutch"" Walz (Glenn Ford), a German immigrant in 1880 who, with a partner, tracks two men to the mine in Arizona's Superstition Mountains. When the men find it, Walz and his partner shoot them down. Then Walz cooly turns his rifle on his partner. It's also the present day story of Walz' grandson, Barry Storm (William Prince), who is searching for the mine again. A generation and a half ago his grandfather disappeared, taking the secret of the mine with him. Storm is determined to find the place, but a killer has been murdering prospectors who have gotten too close to where the mine might be.The movie is oddly constructed but still works well. Three quarters of the time is a flashback to Jacob Walz, his search for the mine and his entanglement with Julia Thomas (Ida Lupino), a woman as ruthless as he, and her husband, Pete (Gig Young), a jealous and weak man. Bracketing this story is Barry Storm. At first, Storm is following a man who is confident he knows where the Lost Dutchman is located. A rifle shot ends that search and Storm is left with a dead body to explain to the sheriff (Paul Ford) and the sheriff's deputy (Will Geer). At the end of Walz' story we move back to Storm. Now, the killer is tracking him. In a nice twist, the killer is probably not who you'll immediately suspect.Glenn Ford does a nice job as the grim, mean Jacob Walz. When he thinks Julia may actually love him, he's shy and a little tongue-tied. When he realizes she was using him...well, let's say he gets his own back with her and her husband after he's tricked them into the Superstition Mountains. This is an unusual role to take on for a young and increasingly popular lead actor. After he was established as a major star, Ford didn't often play ruthless bad guys. With this role, he proved he could whenever he wanted to.Ida Lupino does a great job as the in-it-for-me Julia Thomas. She looks just fine when she's luring Jacob into her web. Later, she's not afraid to look dirty and bedraggled after she's been without water for a couple of days, had to scramble over rocks, been shot at and tossed in the dirt.The black and white DVD picture is in very good condition.

882947,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B0007MANZ8,Noirdame,"[13, 13]","A rather grim but extremely satisfying Western directed by S. Sylvan Simon, features Glenn Ford as Jacob ""Dutch"" Walz, a German who discovers ""the richest goldmine in the world"" in 19th century Arizona. Although not as well-known as other Columbia Westerns, it holds up very well, and is much more appreciated now than it was when it was released in 1949. Juliet Thomas (Ida Lupino) is the cold-hearted woman who pretends to admire Walz as a man, when in fact she just wants to know where his mine is located. She goes so far as to put him up in her home after he collapses in a drunken stupor on the porch of her bakery, and later lets him court her. She pretends to be German (even briefly speaking to him in his native tongue), and feigns ignorance and disinterest in his newfound status as a wealthy citizen. Her pursuit of Jacob only infuriates her estranged husband, Pete Thomas (Gig Young), who wants to be back on her good side (as well as her bed), and so they quietly conspire together to learn the location of his mine and rob Jacob of his fortune. But he is soon onto them and it ends on an interesting showdown on Superstition Mountain.Despite its serious tone, the film has some light-hearted moments, never more wonderfully presented as Juliet shows Jacob her family album and he comes across a photograph of her as an ""au natural"" baby, or the moment after Jacob hands off the cookies he bought from Juliet's shop to a young boy, who collapses under the weight of two massive baskets full! And Lupino shows her independent mind and capabilities in this unsympathetic role, while Gig Young's scoundrel manages to gain a little sympathy as the ignored husband. But Ford, who rarely played villainous roles, really brings uncompromising realism as a greedy, self-serving, ill-tempered man (the scene involving the little girl and him allowing her to ""play"" with his shotgun is a classic example of this). His attempt at a German accent falters in some sequences, but this does not deter from his performance.This aspect of the movie is actually shown in flashback, the opening being of Jacob's grandson Barry Storm (William Prince) trying to find the mine and solve the mystery of the many puzzling, tragic deaths of those who have attempted to discover it.
