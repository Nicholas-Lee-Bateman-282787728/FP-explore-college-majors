We pretty much see everything coming from a mile away. I did enjoy the scenes of mid-90s Miami, but I would have enjoyed even more. They are mostly just pretty backgrounds, and not closeups so it's hard to identify where they were shot. Since I lived there, that would have been of interest to me. Jennifer Lopez has a role of nearly 20 years ago that she went on to repeat in a number of films: the Latino maid/nanny. In all, this is a pulpy soap opera.

Amazon did mention it, but looks like the info is no longer there. But on other websites they provide specifics about the DVD. The question is will it be ""enhanced for widescreen"" or just letterbox. I hope it will be enhanced. It also appears to be in Dolby Digital stereo surround, instead of 5.1 surround sound. However, I hear the special features are going to be impressive with director's commentary, deleted scenes and some stuff on Nicholson and Caine...sounds pretty good to me.

159703,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,0793941717,Cubist,"[7, 7]","Director Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson had a number of memorable collaborations in the 1970s (Five Easy Pieces and The King of Marvin Gardens) and worked once together during the 1980s (The Postman Always Rings Twice) and again during the 1990s (Man Trouble). Towards the end of `90s, they made a nasty little neo noir called Blood and Wine. Like Robert Towne, Rafelson is a survivor from the `70s still using his reputation from that decade to make modestly budgeted, character-driven movies - the kind that established his career in the first place.This is Jack Nicholson in one of his less showier roles, as if hooking back up with his old friend brought the character actor back out in him. It's a meaty role that eschews the charismatic movie star roles that he does in films like As Good As It Gets (1997), for much darker material. Alex is driven by greed and it gradually consumes him and Nicholson does a good job of conveying the effect it has over his character.Michael Caine is also excellent as a really nasty piece of work - an ex-convict lacking the social skills that Alex's calculating, smooth operator has. Victor is a chain-smoker even though he's one coughing fit away from keeling over on the spot. He is driven by his lack of time. He knows that he's dying and Caine does a great job of conveying his increasing desperation. He manages to all but steal the film away from Nicholson.Caine and Nicholson make a fun team to watch as the former sleazes his way through Blood and Wine with his greasy black hair and dry sense of humour that plays well off of the latter's increasingly desperate schemer. The fun of watching this movie is to anticipate all of the plot twists and turns that revolve around a diamond necklace. Rafelson does not forget that ultimately this movie is driven by its characters and lets us get to know them and their motivations so that we are personally involved in their respective fates.For a marginalized movie, the DVD for Blood and Wine is packed with a surprising number extras and with most of the major players (Rafelson, Nicholson, Caine and Dorff) contributing to featurettes and commentary tracks.There is an audio commentary by director Bob Rafelson. He talks about working on a relatively low-budget movie (i.e. working fast on a short schedule) and how this forced him to come up with creative solutions to problems that arose. This is a relaxed track as the filmmaker takes us through his filmmaking process but with quite a few lulls although not too long in duration.Also included are 11 scene specific commentaries by Nicholson, Caine, Dorff, producer Jeremy Thomas and film critic Stephen Farber. Everyone offers some pretty decent observations making one wish that Nicholson and Caine went the distance with a feature length commentary.There are seven making of featurettes that focus mainly on characters and the craft of acting. Rafelson talks about how he and Caine put Victor together through wardrobe (an aspect of the filmmaking process that the director seems obsessed with). Nicholson and Rafelson talk about their long professional relationship and how, at times, it is volatile but only because they've been good friends for years.There are eight deleted scenes introduced by Rafelson. These scenes mostly flesh out the relationships between the characters in more detail. For example, there is a nice scene between Jason and his mother where they talk about his real father.Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",4,A nasty bit of Neo Noir,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,3491,"['Director', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'had', 'number', 'memorable', 'collaborations', '1970s', 'Five', 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'King', 'Marvin', 'Gardens', 'worked', 'once', 'together', '1980s', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'again', '1990s', 'Man', 'Trouble', 'end', '90s', 'made', 'nasty', 'little', 'neo', 'noir', 'called', 'Blood', 'Wine', 'Robert', 'Towne', 'Rafelson', 'survivor', '70s', 'still', 'using', 'reputation', 'decade', 'make', 'modestly', 'budgeted', 'character-driven', 'movies', 'kind', 'established', 'career', 'first', 'place.This', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'less', 'showier', 'roles', 'hooking', 'back', 'up', 'old', 'friend', 'brought', 'character', 'actor', 'back', 'out', 'meaty', 'role', 'charismatic', 'movie', 'star', 'roles', 'films', 'As', 'Good', '1997', 'much', 'darker', 'material', 'Alex', 'driven', 'greed', 'gradually', 'Nicholson', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'effect', 'over', 'character.Michael', 'Caine', 'also', 'excellent', 'really', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'ex-convict', 'lacking', 'social', 'skills', 'Alex', 'calculating', 'smooth', 'operator', 'Victor', 'chain-smoker', 'even', 'one', 'coughing', 'fit', 'away', 'keeling', 'over', 'spot', 'driven', 'lack', 'time', 'dying', 'Caine', 'great', 'job', 'conveying', 'increasing', 'desperation', 'steal', 'film', 'away', 'Nicholson.Caine', 'Nicholson', 'make', 'fun', 'team', 'watch', 'former', 'way', 'Blood', 'Wine', 'greasy', 'black', 'hair', 'dry', 'sense', 'humour', 'well', 'latter', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'schemer', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'anticipate', 'plot', 'twists', 'revolve', 'diamond', 'necklace', 'Rafelson', 'not', 'forget', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'driven', 'characters', 'get', 'know', 'motivations', 'are', 'personally', 'involved', 'respective', 'marginalized', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Blood', 'Wine', 'packed', 'surprising', 'number', 'extras', 'most', 'major', 'players', 'Rafelson', 'Nicholson', 'Caine', 'Dorff', 'contributing', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', 'working', 'relatively', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'i.e', 'working', 'fast', 'short', 'schedule', 'how', 'forced', 'come', 'up', 'creative', 'solutions', 'problems', 'arose', 'relaxed', 'track', 'filmmaker', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'quite', 'few', 'lulls', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'duration.Also', 'included', 'are', '11', 'scene', 'specific', 'commentaries', 'Nicholson', 'Caine', 'Dorff', 'producer', 'Jeremy', 'Thomas', 'film', 'critic', 'Stephen', 'Farber', 'Everyone', 'pretty', 'decent', 'observations', 'making', 'one', 'wish', 'Nicholson', 'Caine', 'went', 'distance', 'feature', 'length', 'are', 'seven', 'making', 'featurettes', 'focus', 'mainly', 'characters', 'craft', 'acting', 'Rafelson', 'talks', 'how', 'Caine', 'put', 'Victor', 'together', 'wardrobe', 'aspect', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'director', 'obsessed', 'Nicholson', 'Rafelson', 'talk', 'long', 'professional', 'relationship', 'how', 'times', 'volatile', 'only', ""'ve"", 'been', 'good', 'friends', 'are', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'introduced', 'Rafelson', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'flesh', 'out', 'relationships', 'characters', 'more', 'detail', 'example', 'nice', 'scene', 'Jason', 'mother', 'where', 'talk', 'real', 'father.Finally', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

When I revisited it today, I marveled at how truly great it is.  Countless formulaic Hollywood films labor mightily to craft a grand string of plot twists to engross and amaze viewers.  Usually this results in a contrived mess that simply seems to defy logic to the degree that only a breathlessly fast pace can begin to hide the unbelievability of it all.  In this movie, the characters are well drawn and the action unfolds smoothly out of their natural reaction to each development in the story.  With this in mind, it is a wonder that such a rich sequence of startling plot surprises could be the thoroughly believable end result.  Some reviewers were appalled at the nastiness of some of these characters.  Well, such people exist, and, like it or not, they are, in part, the subject of this movie.  In the end, it is a morality play, powerfully pursuing a very worthwhile theme about what is truly valuable in this life.  Of course, some viewers will be unhappy with their hundred minutes of time spent with these dark doings.  As with my first time around, my second look at ""Blood and Wine"" was a fabulous journey through its serpentine plot to a terrifically satisfying conclusion.  You can blame no one for whom the movie is not to their taste, but if you enjoy dark, hard hitting tales about people that definitely seem very real indeed, you should really get a kick out of this one.

The script does call for the great grinner to be a snake in the grass wine dealer who's looking to score some major jewels. Fine. But  there's no zing, no pop, no nothing.Alex Gates (Nicholson) can't make  anybody happy anymore. He's cash-poor and his wine business hasn't aged all  that well. His had-it-up-to-here wife Suzanne (Judy Davis) ends up doing  more whining then her hubby. He's never home, and when he is, he usually  goes at it with Suzanne's son Jason (Stephen Dorff).The point of all  this is theft. Alex calls on old friend Victor Spansky (Michael Caine in  the best role he's had in years) to help him pull it off. The two aren't  exactly Bonnie and Clyde but they do good work before Suzanne gets wise to  Alex and his mistress (the hot, hot, hot Jennifer Lopez).I find it  admirable that Nicholson's been taking pay cuts to star in low budget films  like this one and Sean Penn's underrated The Crossing Guard, but what  happened to the man's taste in scripts.The silver lining is when Jack  goes toe-to-toe with Davis, who matches him scowl for scowl and wields a  golf club like a psycho Tiger Woods. Also, Caine's hacking sleazoid is  beautiful, but the two old dragons never get enough room to breathe the  fire that's in them.The problem here has to be director Bob Rafelson  who, for whatever reason, can't build the suspense. Under the tutelage of  Captain Bob, the stakes are never high enough. What we're left with is a  second rate thriller with glimmers of brilliance. It's not enough.

159708,A3RA9ZE9ARIUWD,0793941717,Julius,"[1, 1]","I read about this movie in The TV Guide one day and thought wow this looks intriguing. So I caught it one night on Cinemax and I was not disappointed one bit. Jack Nicholson puts in his best performance as Alex Gates, a wine dealer who is struggling financially. His struggles lead to desperation as he plans to steal a diamond necklace and sell it to get money to save his business with the help of his criminal friend Victor Spansky (Michael Caine). It appears Alex's misguided intentions are to provide for his wife Suzanne (Judy Davis) financially, but he has eyes for his beautiful mistress Gabriela (Jennifer Lopez). Caught in the middle of everything is Alex's stepson Jason (Stephen Dorff). Jason resents Alex, but he has to accept the fact that Alex is married to his mother. This movie has twists and turns until the very end when the diamond necklace changes hands between Alex and Jason, with Victor so ruthlessly wanting his cut of the money. Nicholson as Alex is a desperate and somewhat well meaning man who is not a good husband to his wife Suzanne, tries to be a good stepfather to Jason, tries to be loyal to Victor, and is so in love with Gabriela. Nicholson's performance is perfect. Dorff, who usually gets casted as bad guys or anti-heroes in movies such as City Of Industry, Blade, Deuces Wild, and Public Enemies, shows incredible range as Jason, a hard working, well meaning, and responsible young man who is determined to make it on his own. Caine shows off his splendid versatility as Victor, the sleazy and psychotic safe cracking specialist. Davis is excellent displaying the emotions of Suzanne, Alex's wife and in one scene stands up for herself against Alex's violence towards her. That scene had wow written all over it. Lopez as Gabriela captures the desirability, brings out the emotions perfectly, and nails The Cuban accent to perfection. Too bad Jennifer Lopez couldn't make more movies like this. Instead we've been stuck with crap like Gigli, The Wedding Planner, and Monster-In-Law. Nicholson and Lopez have good chemistry, but there's great chemistry between Dorff and Lopez. The musical score is well done, the song ""Quimbara"" by Celia Cruz adds vibrance to the movie as seen in the part where Alex dances with Gabriela, and the shots of the sunrises and sunsets are beautiful.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 2]","This 1997 thriller from director Bob Rafelson is a first-rate piece of film noir, populated with a fascinating cast of multi-dimensional characters and filled with enough dramatic plot twists to keep viewers off-balance right up until the finish.Though he lives in a nice house, drives an expensive car and has a beautiful wife (Judy Davis), Florida wine merchant Jack Nicholson is virtually broke.  That's why he's enlisted the aid of career criminal Michael Caine to help him steal a diamond necklace worth over a million dollars.The burglary goes well, but when Davis discovers that Jack is about to run off with his mistress (Jennifer Lopez), she gets violent, knocks him unconscious, then flees with her grown son, Stephen Dorff, who has taken a liking to Lopez, not aware that she's involved with step-father Nicholson.  Unknowingly, mother and son have also fled the scene with the diamond necklace, which means that Jack and the very vicious Caine have no choice but to go after them.The DVD has some excellent extras, including audio commentary by Rafelson, Nicholson, Caine and others, deleted scenes and several retrospective documentary featurettes.

It's a by-the-numbers heist/chase movie, with the occasional stab at some sort of emotional resonance, all of which fall flat thanks to a very weak script. From the opening scene, the combination of violence and ridiculousness is established: a pair of pretty young men uses a pick-up truck to drag a bull shark to the shore of a Florida beach then kills it with a shark stick to the head. From then it's father-stepson rivalry over an absurdly overdressed Cuban nanny/golddigger (J-Lo, about as dramatically effective as the dead shark), a diamond necklace as the McGuffin, and far more blood than wine. The wine, one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie, is perfunctory background color in three scenes.
