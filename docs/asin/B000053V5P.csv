565077,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000053V5P,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","'No Se Lo Digas A Nadie' ('Don't Tell Anyone') is probably a good PR line for this little film trying to be something grand.  In excess of two hours director Francisco J. Lombardi makes an attempt to bring to life the autobiography of gay Peruvian talk show host Jaime Bayly and to explore the angst of teenagers and college students finding their way into the adult world.  What results is a soap opera treatment that wades around in a lot of self-pity and wrong choices.Joaquin Camino (Santiago Magill) struggles as a child with his terrible secret of attraction to boys in a home atmosphere of a macho homophobic father and a religious zealot mother.  He tries girls, even a graduation gift prostitute compliments of his father, but he is unable to 'be a man' and after high school runs away from home.  In college he mixes with the marijuana and cocaine crowd, unsuccessfully attempts physical affection for his girlfriend  Alejandra (Luc&iacute;a Jim&eacute;nez) but eventually falls in love with a closet case to end all closet cases Gonzalo (Christian Meier) who runs when Joaquin makes it clear he is available for a relationship.  This is the manner of the tale which eventually resolves in demonstrating how many young people hide their true identities behind alcohol and drugs and the fast life: the story as expected has no real ending because of the lack of ultimate character definition.The cast is fairly strong, especially Santiago Magill, and they try to make the best of a thin script.  Production values fit the mood of the film and there are some fine little moments that justify watching it.  In the long run the movie seems to be afraid to offend anyone and that fear keeps it from being bold enough to make a clear statement about human sexuality. Perhaps this is because the film it is from a Latin American culture (Peru), but basically it is a lost opportunity.

The society as a whole is conservative, with strong family values and Catholic morals.  Joaquin has two relationships with men, Gonzalo (played by Christian Meier) and Alfonso Cordoba (played by Giovanni Ciccia), who are both comfortably bisexual. They will each marry and have supplemental same-sex dalliances.  Joaquin wants his relationships uncluttered with wives and girlfriends, outs himself to his parents, and tells Gonzalo's fiancee about the same-sex relationship.When a crisis emerges, Joaquin flees to Miami and lives there a year.  We don't see Joaquin trying to meet a kindred spirit.  It's just backrooms, tricks, and his cute bisexual roommate, who wants a wife.  Joaquin's English is all right, and he is handsome.  I just wonder why he didn't try harder to be in a relationship with a fully gay man.Joaquin's girl-friend Alejandra (played by Lucia Jimenez) gets him to return to Lima, where he graduates from a university.  She has some idea of what is happening, but thinks she can help or cure him.At graduation, both Alfonso Cordoba amd Gonzalo advocate traditional marriage, with boyfriends on the side.  It is a possibility that Joaquin might go along with this plan since the only alternative seems to be bachelorhood.A different way of looking at this movie is to note how unconflicted the bisexuals seem to be.  Societies that are very rigid and universal in marriage practices or that frequently use arranged marriages tend to wink at adultery, knowing that the marriages themselves are semi-coerced.  This opens a window for bisexuality in Peru that is not acceptable in differently-Puritanical America, where people are expected to marry for love, not convenience.Politics in the USA have carved out room for straights and for gays.  (Joaquin should have done well here.)  There are no institutions, programs, or real tolerance for bisexuality, even though more people are bi than gay.  Bisexuals are to pick one sex and stick with it, at least serially.  The movie shows a Latin American approach.  Does the USA really have anything better?",4,Square Peg for only Round Holes,1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,2302,"['endorse', 'Timothy', 'Halkin', 'comments', 'currently', 'Spotlight', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'Anyone', 'Joaquin', 'Camino', 'well', 'played', 'Santiago', 'Magill', 'young', 'gay', 'Peruvian', 'good', 'family', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'established', 'adult', 'society', 'whole', 'conservative', 'strong', 'family', 'values', 'Catholic', 'morals', 'Joaquin', 'two', 'relationships', 'men', 'Gonzalo', 'played', 'Christian', 'Meier', 'Alfonso', 'Cordoba', 'played', 'Giovanni', 'Ciccia', 'who', 'are', 'comfortably', 'bisexual', 'will', 'marry', 'have', 'supplemental', 'same-sex', 'dalliances', 'Joaquin', 'relationships', 'uncluttered', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'parents', 'Gonzalo', 'fiancee', 'same-sex', 'relationship.When', 'crisis', 'Joaquin', 'Miami', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Joaquin', 'trying', 'meet', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'just', 'backrooms', 'tricks', 'cute', 'bisexual', 'roommate', 'who', 'wife', 'Joaquin', 'English', 'right', 'handsome', 'just', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'harder', 'be', 'relationship', 'fully', 'gay', 'man.Joaquin', 'girl-friend', 'Alejandra', 'played', 'Lucia', 'Jimenez', 'return', 'Lima', 'where', 'university', 'idea', 'what', 'happening', 'can', 'help', 'cure', 'him.At', 'graduation', 'Alfonso', 'Cordoba', 'Gonzalo', 'advocate', 'traditional', 'marriage', 'boyfriends', 'side', 'possibility', 'Joaquin', 'might', 'go', 'along', 'plan', 'only', 'alternative', 'be', 'bachelorhood.A', 'different', 'way', 'looking', 'movie', 'note', 'how', 'unconflicted', 'bisexuals', 'seem', 'be', 'Societies', 'are', 'very', 'rigid', 'universal', 'marriage', 'practices', 'frequently', 'use', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'tend', 'wink', 'adultery', 'knowing', 'marriages', 'are', 'semi-coerced', 'window', 'bisexuality', 'Peru', 'not', 'acceptable', 'differently-Puritanical', 'America', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'expected', 'marry', 'love', 'not', 'convenience.Politics', 'USA', 'have', 'carved', 'out', 'room', 'straights', 'gays', 'Joaquin', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'here', 'are', 'institutions', 'programs', 'real', 'tolerance', 'bisexuality', 'even', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'bi', 'gay', 'Bisexuals', 'are', 'pick', 'one', 'sex', 'stick', 'least', 'serially', 'movie', 'Latin', 'American', 'approach', 'USA', 'really', 'have', 'anything', 'better']",Don't Tell Anyone
565079,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B000053V5P,Libretio,"[11, 11]","DON'T TELL ANYONE[No se lo Digas a Nadie](Peru/Spain - 1998)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalAn unhappy young Peruvian man (Santiago Magill) clashes with his affluent, god-fearing parents as he struggles to come to terms with his attraction to other men in a country steeped in hypocrisy and prejudice.An understanding of the macho culture which underpins Peruvian society is a prerequisite for viewers of Francisco J. Lombardi's DON'T TELL ANYONE, an apparently sanitized version of the bestselling book by chat show host Jaime Bayly. Hot young TV star Santiago Magill (The Most Beautiful Man In The World - official!) plays the central character as a deeply confused individual who wants to conform but is unable to deny his true sexuality, despite the attentions of a sympathetic girlfriend (Lucia Jimenez) who believes she can make him 'normal' again. Inevitably, Magill goes off the rails and forfeits his education before descending into coke-fuelled abandon and fleeing to Miami. Unable to escape his past, he's forced to compromise the very essence of his humanity...Lombardi's cheerless film shakes an angry fist at the influence of religious doctrine in Peru (revealed here as a sham) and the racism suffered by the country's native Indian population, an anger shared by the movie's principal character, who rails against the very same bigotry and oppression which stifles his freedom at every turn. His slide into rebellion makes for uncomfortable viewing (Magill gives a powerhouse performance as the delicate, pretty-boy waif who gravitates toward anarchy and emerges a strong - though embittered - survivor), but it's also faintly predictable, given the terrible circumstances under which he is forced to exist.Magill is pleasingly nude in a number of scenes, though gay viewers may be alarmed by the emphasis placed on his relationship with Jimenez, who thinks he's merely suffering a 'trauma' and can be cured by having sex with a woman (it's no surprise to learn that director Lombardi is straight), while his relationships with men are depicted as fragile and fleeting, primarily because his male partners are under the same societal pressures as himself. Unable to indulge his true sexuality, Magill's character seems doomed to a life of unhappiness and deceit, an approach which distinguishes the film from its feel-good American counterparts. Technical credits are polished, and the cast is exemplary, but it's hard to enjoy this bleak little movie, and even harder to dismiss it.",3,Cheerless film rails against bigotry and oppression,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,2524,"['DO', ""N'T"", 'TELL', 'ANYONE', '[', 'No', 'se', 'lo', 'Digas', 'Nadie', ']', 'Peru/Spain', '1998', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'Dolby', 'DigitalAn', 'unhappy', 'young', 'Peruvian', 'man', 'Santiago', 'Magill', 'affluent', 'god-fearing', 'parents', 'come', 'terms', 'attraction', 'other', 'men', 'country', 'steeped', 'hypocrisy', 'prejudice.An', 'understanding', 'macho', 'culture', 'Peruvian', 'society', 'prerequisite', 'viewers', 'Francisco', 'J.', 'Lombardi', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'TELL', 'ANYONE', 'apparently', 'sanitized', 'version', 'bestselling', 'book', 'chat', 'show', 'host', 'Jaime', 'Bayly', 'Hot', 'young', 'TV', 'star', 'Santiago', 'Magill', 'Most', 'Beautiful', 'Man', 'World', 'official', 'central', 'character', 'deeply', 'confused', 'individual', 'who', 'conform', 'unable', 'deny', 'true', 'sexuality', 'attentions', 'sympathetic', 'girlfriend', 'Lucia', 'Jimenez', 'who', 'can', 'make', ""'normal"", 'again', 'Inevitably', 'Magill', 'rails', 'education', 'descending', 'coke-fuelled', 'abandon', 'fleeing', 'Miami', 'Unable', 'escape', 'past', 'forced', 'compromise', 'very', 'essence', 'humanity', 'Lombardi', 'cheerless', 'film', 'angry', 'fist', 'influence', 'religious', 'doctrine', 'Peru', 'revealed', 'here', 'sham', 'racism', 'suffered', 'country', 'native', 'Indian', 'population', 'anger', 'shared', 'movie', 'principal', 'character', 'who', 'very', 'same', 'bigotry', 'oppression', 'freedom', 'turn', 'slide', 'rebellion', 'uncomfortable', 'viewing', 'Magill', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'delicate', 'pretty-boy', 'waif', 'who', 'anarchy', 'strong', 'embittered', 'survivor', 'also', 'faintly', 'predictable', 'given', 'terrible', 'circumstances', 'forced', 'exist.Magill', 'pleasingly', 'nude', 'number', 'scenes', 'gay', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'alarmed', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'relationship', 'Jimenez', 'who', 'merely', 'suffering', ""'trauma"", 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'having', 'sex', 'woman', 'surprise', 'learn', 'director', 'Lombardi', 'straight', 'relationships', 'men', 'are', 'depicted', 'fragile', 'fleeting', 'primarily', 'male', 'partners', 'are', 'same', 'societal', 'pressures', 'Unable', 'indulge', 'true', 'sexuality', 'Magill', 'character', 'doomed', 'life', 'unhappiness', 'deceit', 'approach', 'film', 'feel-good', 'American', 'counterparts', 'Technical', 'credits', 'are', 'polished', 'cast', 'exemplary', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'bleak', 'little', 'movie', 'even', 'harder', 'dismiss']",Don't Tell Anyone
565080,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B000053V5P,Michael J. Mazza,"[8, 10]","""Don't Tell Anyone,"" directed by Francisco J. Lombardi, tells the story of Joaquin (played by Santiago Magill), a young Peruvian man who is struggling with feelings of attraction towards other males.  He is torn between the macho ethics of his racist, womanizing father and the bleeding-heart religiosity of his mother.  But a series of relationships and experiences he has while attending college profoundly impact his life.""Don't Tell"" is an absolutely gripping and fascinating film. The film is mainly in Spanish with English subtitles.  Woven into Joaquin's story are many issues: ethnic difference, class stratification, homophobia, parent-child relationships, etc.  Particularly interesting is the film's treatment of recreational drug use--there are many shocking scenes of drug use (or abuse) throughout the film, and ultimately if there is a ""message"" about drug use that message is quite ambiguous.Magill is excellent in the lead role.  His character really dominates the film, and Magill is by turns playful, passionate, tortured, explosive, and serene.  The supporting cast is also quite impressive; Lucia Jiminez is particularly appealing as a female classmate who takes a liking to Joaquin.In the end, the filmmakers have perhaps bitten off more social issues than they can fully address, but overall the film has an effective symmetry and moves to an open-ended but satisfying conclusion.

The impetus for doing so is a love affair with another man who is in a likewise predicament of girlfriend followed by marriage to be followed by doing what you really want, but on the side.

565084,ADK5CSMBXHIL8,B000053V5P,"T. Halkin ""Tim""","[37, 41]","People like myself, who have spent their lives in fairly open and liberal environments, might have trouble with the ultimate statement of this film.  It seems to be saying: if you can't beat them, join them.We observe in this film a young Peruvian's, Joaquin, struggle through his youth and adolescence with the knowledge that he is gay in a society that is both too macho and Catholic to tolerate alternative lifestyles - not to mention his family, which represents this society in microcosm. (Possibly his father's Hitler moustache is a tick over-the-top!)As a college freshman, he makes a desperate attempt with a nice, but highly nave, girl to be ""normal"".  He explains his problem to her, and she believes in her naivet&eacute; that she can cure him.  Joaquin falls, however, madly in love and has an affair with Gonzalo, the fianc&eacute; of his girlfriend's best friend.  Gonzalo is shock when Joaquin breaks off with his girlfriend out of love for him.  Gonzalo explains that leading an openly gay life in Peru is not a viable option for him; he suggests that Joaquin come to his senses - meaning he should get back with his girlfriend, marry her even (as he intends to do with his), so they can go back to having their affair on the side without problems.Botching it up with Gonzalo by telling his fianc&eacute; of their affair, he quits school and goes on a drug and alcohol binge with his queer-bashing schoolmate, Alfonzo. Well, wonders never cease - Alfonzo has the hots for him and they sleep together.  When asked why he beats up on gays in the park, he explains because they're queers, not like them - respectable people, who will marry, have kids and screw with men on the side.Alfonzo seems to have OD'ed on their wild drug binge, and Joaquin, terrified, runs off to America, hoping to leave this whole mess behind him and finally be able to find some happiness in life. He ends up dog-sitting in an attempt to make enough money to stay off the street as a hustler.  In the end, he hates his life in Miami and returns to both his country and his girlfriend (who's still nave enough to believe she can change him).He meets up first with Alfonzo (no, he didn't die), who is now married with a kid on the way (we can sense, however, what he's doing on the side) and with Gonzalo, who - despite the fact that he did not marry - claims to have not changed his opinion.  In the end, it's clear that Joaquin will also marry, but have his ""desert"" on the side.At first, I was somewhat shocked by this, but then again, I've never had to live under such oppression.  I'm assuming that many in North America and most European countries will have trouble identifying with this film, even find its characters somewhat despicable.  It almost seems to be a glory hymn to bi-sexuality.
