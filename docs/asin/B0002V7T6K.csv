I still must admit I prefer the acting in the Disney version and wish it too was available on a Region 1 DVD instead of requiring US customers to buy a multi-region player and Region 2 disc in order to view it. This rendition has a good cast and does a great job of showing how hard the times were in Scotland during this era of British rule. It does a fine job of showing how people mostly ran to get from one place to another. There were few horses and carts there then. It has a more realness to it but Disney's slightly lighter look at it is good too. I highly recommend this be rented before buying to make sure you enjoy this darker version of the story.

845952,AD44WZGK0FVHS,B0002V7T6K,Nightflyer,"[10, 11]","""Kidnapped"" by Robert Louis Stevenson is my favorite book of all time.  I began reading it when I was a young lad and have probably read it hundreds of times since.  I know most of the dialog by heart.Needless to say, I have been consistently disappointed by the film versions, which deviate needlessly from the story.  The only version that respects its source material is the Disney version, which I highly recommend.The Armand Assante version was made for cable TV and shown over two nights.  I missed it and was excited when it came out on VHS.  But when I first viewed it, I was terribly disappointed; although it looked great, this version had the same fault as the others--namely, inserting all sorts of extraneous subplots that add nothing to Stevenson's story and actually weaken it.Recently, however, I re-watched it, and I have to temper my original dislike.  This version does have some excellent points in its favor.  It's beautifully photographed, and the attention to detail in dress and setting is remarkable.  The portions that do respect Stevenson's novel have never been done better, perhaps not even by the Disney version.  However, its faults remain.  Assante and McCardie are miscast physically as Alan Breck and David Balfour (although Assante does swashbuckle through the film with a vengeance, he looks nothing like Stevenson's description of him, which was based upon historical fact); the film was shot in Ireland, which does not look like Scotland (watch ""Rob Roy"" if you want to see what the Scottish Highlands really look like); the writers manufacture a love story for David Balfour, and this character does not fall in love until the Stevenson's sequel ""Catriona,"" and then to a completely different girl; Alan visits Flora MacDonald, who lived on the Isle of Skye, not on the mainland; and worst of all, the writers introduce a completely unnecessary subplot centered around a British officer named Reid, who instigates the Appin murder in order to place blame on James Stewart.  I could go on and on--there's plenty more--but you get the idea.So yes, there's plenty in this version to enjoy, but please be aware--it is *not* Stevenson.  For that you need to go to the Disney version.  Still, compared to the utter abomination that appeared recently on PBS, this version is a masterpiece.",3,"Not bad, but not Stevenson",1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,2321,"['Kidnapped', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'favorite', 'book', 'time', 'began', 'reading', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'lad', 'have', 'probably', 'read', 'hundreds', 'times', 'know', 'most', 'dialog', 'heart.Needless', 'say', 'have', 'been', 'consistently', 'disappointed', 'film', 'versions', 'deviate', 'needlessly', 'story', 'only', 'version', 'source', 'material', 'Disney', 'version', 'highly', 'recommend.The', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'version', 'was', 'made', 'cable', 'TV', 'shown', 'two', 'nights', 'missed', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', 'when', 'first', 'viewed', 'was', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'looked', 'great', 'version', 'had', 'same', 'fault', 'others', 'namely', 'inserting', 'sorts', 'extraneous', 'subplots', 'add', 'nothing', 'Stevenson', 'story', 'actually', 'weaken', 'it.Recently', 'however', 're-watched', 'have', 'temper', 'original', 'dislike', 'version', 'have', 'excellent', 'points', 'favor', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'attention', 'detail', 'dress', 'setting', 'remarkable', 'portions', 'do', 'respect', 'Stevenson', 'novel', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'perhaps', 'not', 'even', 'Disney', 'version', 'However', 'faults', 'remain', 'Assante', 'McCardie', 'are', 'miscast', 'physically', 'Alan', 'Breck', 'David', 'Balfour', 'Assante', 'swashbuckle', 'film', 'vengeance', 'nothing', 'Stevenson', 'description', 'was', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Ireland', 'not', 'look', 'Scotland', 'watch', 'Rob', 'Roy', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'Scottish', 'Highlands', 'really', 'look', 'writers', 'manufacture', 'love', 'story', 'David', 'Balfour', 'character', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'Stevenson', 'sequel', 'Catriona', 'then', 'completely', 'different', 'girl', 'Alan', 'Flora', 'MacDonald', 'who', 'lived', 'Isle', 'Skye', 'not', 'mainland', 'worst', 'writers', 'introduce', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'subplot', 'centered', 'British', 'officer', 'named', 'Reid', 'who', 'Appin', 'murder', 'order', 'place', 'blame', 'James', 'Stewart', 'could', 'go', 'plenty', 'more', 'get', 'idea.So', 'yes', 'plenty', 'version', 'enjoy', 'please', 'be', 'aware', '*not*', 'Stevenson', 'need', 'go', 'Disney', 'version', 'Still', 'compared', 'utter', 'abomination', 'appeared', 'recently', 'PBS', 'version', 'masterpiece']",N/A

845954,A379FTDQT1NKSN,B0002V7T6K,Robert Pratte,"[66, 67]","I purchased this DVD in order to watch it with my kids (youngest is 10).  They were initially unsure whether they would like it, but after mentioning that it was based on the Robert Louis Stevenson book, and that Mr. Stevenson had written Treasure Island and Jekyll and Hyde, the kids' interests were piqued.  As the DVD is also rather long (in terms of current films), I was concerned whether their interest would hold.  However,the movie kept their interest captive without any problem.First of all, let me say that the scenes and scenery are great.  One really gets a feel for the time and place of the story.  Costumes, villages, landscapes, etc. are generally high quality.  Moreover, the acting (including accents) were fine all around.  I found the film engrossing, while my kids were very excited to find themselves so involved in the story.  Of course they have seen a plethora of films that ""transport"" the viewer elsewhere, but many of these films have some feeling of artificiality - that is, they are too far out of our own experience to truly feel ""real"".  I found, and I think that my kids found, the scenes in this DVD believable and approachable.  Having experience in historical reenactment, I know that portraying a sense of another time and place in such a way as to encourage ""viewers"" to participate is a sort of magic and I felt that there was some of this magic in the movie.As far as the story goes, there are issues that may be a bit complicated for younger viewers to understand.  Additionally, there is some violence (particularly the ship scenes), but nothing too brutal.  The worst scenes are the death of a few minor characters (gunshot and hanging), as well as a view of a pool of blood after a battle.  This movie isn't for very young viewers, but I would guess that most kids over the age of 10 wouldn't have a problem with the film.  The level of violence is really fairly minor in comparison to much of today's fare.I have been describing the movie in terms of a family film, but I also think that it is a good companion to the book.  Teachers, students, lovers of literature, etc. will likely find this a welcome addition to their collection.",4,"Decent interpretation, good family film",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2179,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'order', 'watch', 'kids', 'youngest', '10', 'were', 'initially', 'unsure', 'would', 'like', 'mentioning', 'was', 'based', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'book', 'Mr.', 'Stevenson', 'had', 'written', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'kids', 'interests', 'were', 'piqued', 'DVD', 'also', 'rather', 'long', 'terms', 'current', 'films', 'was', 'concerned', 'interest', 'would', 'hold', 'However', 'movie', 'kept', 'interest', 'captive', 'problem.First', 'let', 'say', 'scenes', 'scenery', 'are', 'great', 'One', 'really', 'feel', 'time', 'place', 'story', 'Costumes', 'villages', 'landscapes', 'etc', 'are', 'generally', 'high', 'quality', 'Moreover', 'acting', 'including', 'accents', 'were', 'fine', 'found', 'film', 'engrossing', 'kids', 'were', 'very', 'excited', 'find', 'so', 'involved', 'story', 'course', 'have', 'seen', 'plethora', 'films', 'transport', 'viewer', 'elsewhere', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'feeling', 'artificiality', 'are', 'too', 'far', 'own', 'experience', 'truly', 'feel', 'real', 'found', 'think', 'kids', 'found', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'believable', 'approachable', 'Having', 'experience', 'historical', 'reenactment', 'know', 'portraying', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'such', 'way', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'participate', 'sort', 'magic', 'felt', 'was', 'magic', 'movie.As', 'far', 'story', 'are', 'issues', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'complicated', 'younger', 'viewers', 'understand', 'Additionally', 'violence', 'particularly', 'ship', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'too', 'brutal', 'worst', 'scenes', 'are', 'death', 'few', 'minor', 'characters', 'gunshot', 'hanging', 'as', 'well', 'view', 'pool', 'blood', 'battle', 'movie', ""n't"", 'very', 'young', 'viewers', 'would', 'guess', 'most', 'kids', 'age', '10', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'film', 'level', 'violence', 'really', 'fairly', 'minor', 'comparison', 'much', 'today', 'fare.I', 'have', 'been', 'describing', 'movie', 'terms', 'family', 'film', 'also', 'think', 'good', 'companion', 'book', 'Teachers', 'students', 'lovers', 'literature', 'etc', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'welcome', 'addition', 'collection']",N/A
