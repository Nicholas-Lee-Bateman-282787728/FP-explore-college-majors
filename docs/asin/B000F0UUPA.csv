While watching the last two seasons, I noticed the show got boring. I didnt laugh as much in season four and I was very disappointed by it. Im happy to see that other reviewers fell the same way about it. Still a few laughs, but not as good as earlier seasons.",3,Season four slumber,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,387,"['love', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'had', 'seasons', '1-3', 'long', 'time', 'wanted', 'complete', 'series', 'bought', 'last', 'two', 'season', 'watching', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'noticed', 'show', 'got', 'boring', 'didnt', 'laugh', 'as', 'much', 'season', 'four', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Im', 'happy', 'see', 'other', 'reviewers', 'fell', 'same', 'way', 'Still', 'few', 'laughs', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'earlier', 'seasons']",N/A

While the troupe have rounded out their performances by this season, the material itself drops off. Still there are high points and I think the idea was that they were hoping to be more daring as shown but their lack of reliance on the old standby characters. Many of the recurring sketches are new, such as the socially edgy ""Steps"" featuring a group of gay men hanging out on the steps shooting the breeze.The format is well-established by now: 4 discs; 3 of epsiodes; 1 of ""Best Of"", commentary, rare performances and everything else to which we've grown accustomed.Personally I think it's worth owning.

The remaining skits...eh...well...how does one say this...but it seemed like they were running out of steam in this season.
