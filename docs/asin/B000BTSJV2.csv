However, I thought many of the workouts she put out after that were on the gimmicky side (I blame Gaiam more than Caban).  I've shied away from her offerings in recent years, but I decided to give this a try after it became available.  Excellent workout.This 30 minute workout goes at a brisk pace that allows for adequate instruction.  It includes many of the movements you'd find on her Intermediate workout, with some additions, such as Crab(!), Snake, Neck Pull, Teaser 5, Side Kicks, Mermaid and preps for Leg Pull Up and Leg Pull Down.  She also includes One-Leg variations on the Pushups and adds in Ronde de Jambe to the Side Kicks series (but she doesn't do a lot of the other side kicks, so be warned).I felt very nicely worked out after this one- my muscles felt like they'd done something, but I didn't feel like I wasn't going to be able to move.  My whole body- my powerhouse, my legs, my arms- all feel evenly worked.  This shouldn't be such a big deal for a Pilates workout, but so many of the workouts out there today are of the ""parts"" variety or just so badly designed that, unfortunately, it isn't a given.I liked the ending movements with the bent knees, kicks and jumping jacks, but I wouldn't get excited about their cardio value- I believe they are intended more to test power and endurance after the initial workout.  Still, though, they add a nice amount of authentic variety.Recommended even if you don't have weight to lose.",5,Solid high intermediate workout,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,1578,"['found', 'Caban', 'first', 'two', 'workouts', 'Pilates', 'Beginning', 'Mat', 'WorkoutandPilates', 'Intermediate', 'Mat', 'Workout', 'useful', 'effective', 'However', 'thought', 'many', 'workouts', 'put', 'out', 'were', 'gimmicky', 'side', 'blame', 'Gaiam', 'more', 'Caban', ""'ve"", 'shied', 'away', 'offerings', 'recent', 'years', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'became', 'available', 'Excellent', 'workout.This', '30', 'minute', 'workout', 'brisk', 'pace', 'adequate', 'instruction', 'many', 'movements', ""'d"", 'find', 'Intermediate', 'workout', 'additions', 'such', 'Crab', 'Snake', 'Neck', 'Pull', 'Teaser', '5', 'Side', 'Kicks', 'Mermaid', 'preps', 'Leg', 'Pull', 'Up', 'Leg', 'Pull', 'Down', 'also', 'One-Leg', 'variations', 'Pushups', 'Ronde', 'de', 'Jambe', 'Side', 'Kicks', 'series', ""n't"", 'do', 'lot', 'other', 'side', 'kicks', 'so', 'be', 'warned', '.I', 'felt', 'very', 'nicely', 'worked', 'out', 'one-', 'muscles', 'felt', ""'d"", 'done', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'whole', 'body-', 'powerhouse', 'legs', 'arms-', 'feel', 'evenly', 'worked', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'Pilates', 'workout', 'so', 'many', 'workouts', 'out', 'there', 'today', 'are', 'parts', 'variety', 'just', 'so', 'badly', 'designed', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'given.I', 'liked', 'ending', 'movements', 'bent', 'knees', 'kicks', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'excited', 'cardio', 'value-', 'believe', 'are', 'intended', 'more', 'test', 'power', 'endurance', 'initial', 'workout', 'Still', 'add', 'nice', 'amount', 'authentic', 'variety.Recommended', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'weight', 'lose']",Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss

950092,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,B000BTSJV2,Feles31,"[3, 7]","I put myself at an intermediate level of fitness.This workout was just too easy for me.  I got halfway thru then quit and switched to another dvd.  Granted, I could work on my form more for some challenging moves but since they barely do a few reps of each, you don't really get to work at it (or get a workout so I don't know how you will really achieve weight loss with this.)I tend to like pilates more than yoga since I feel like I am actively getting the burn like keeping your leg up and and making circles in the air rather than just holding a tough pose.  I'm not sure if there were more intense moves later in the workout but 15-20 minutes of waiting to get a workout isn't a workout I want to do again and again.I tend to not like voice-overs (although, theoretically, I get that it is easier and higher quality audio than having the instructor gasping for air) and this is no exception.  What is especially off-putting, tho, is the sing-song intonation that goes with uuuuuupp or steeeetch as you do the move (as though I were saying it to you clearly over the phone) with no music. It's just plain weird . . . and annoying . . . and boring overall without some kind of music with a strong beat.If you're just looking for a beginners relaxation/stretching/flexibility/ workout then this might work for you.",2,relaxation workout,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,1317,"['put', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness.This', 'workout', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'easy', 'got', 'halfway', 'thru', 'then', 'quit', 'switched', 'dvd', 'Granted', 'could', 'work', 'form', 'more', 'challenging', 'moves', 'barely', 'do', 'few', 'reps', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'work', 'get', 'workout', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'will', 'really', 'achieve', 'weight', 'loss', 'tend', 'like', 'pilates', 'more', 'yoga', 'feel', 'am', 'actively', 'getting', 'burn', 'keeping', 'leg', 'up', 'making', 'circles', 'air', 'rather', 'just', 'holding', 'tough', 'pose', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'were', 'more', 'intense', 'moves', 'later', 'workout', '15-20', 'minutes', 'waiting', 'get', 'workout', ""n't"", 'workout', 'want', 'do', 'again', 'again.I', 'tend', 'not', 'voice-overs', 'theoretically', 'get', 'easier', 'higher', 'quality', 'audio', 'having', 'instructor', 'gasping', 'air', 'exception', 'What', 'especially', 'off-putting', 'tho', 'sing-song', 'intonation', 'uuuuuupp', 'steeeetch', 'do', 'move', 'were', 'saying', 'clearly', 'phone', 'music', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'annoying', 'boring', 'overall', 'kind', 'music', 'strong', 'beat.If', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'beginners', 'relaxation/stretching/flexibility/', 'then', 'might', 'work']",Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss

Some new moves I never seen before have been included in this workout, such as the crab (it'll take a while for me to master this move). Anyway,everything is included in this workout,leg work, arm work, including cardio (jumping jacks). In addition, Ana has also included a 15-minute bonus workout. This one has a fun move, like the rolling like a ball around the clock. I can't wait to practice this move.

Ana Caban leads you through a series of challenging Pilates exercises designed to boost your metabolism. While you are burning calories you are also developing lean muscles and testing your endurance.The exercises move at a rapid pace so there is no time for a beginner to learn the exercises. This was created for anyone familiar with Pilates and especially anyone who has been through the ""Quick Start Pilates for Weight Loss"" workout. Ana Caban provides enough variety to make this routine interesting for intermediate to advanced students of Pilates.There are many traditional exercises like the hundred, single leg circles, rolling like a ball, swan, teaser, spine stretch forward, roll-up, corkscrew, plank, open-leg rocker, scissors, seal, Ronde de Jambe and neck pull.
