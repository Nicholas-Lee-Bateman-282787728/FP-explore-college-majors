I've read people saying that, &quot;if you liked Swingers, you'll love Made.&quot;  Well I'm here to say that if you liked Bottle Rocket, you'll like Made.Both Bottle Rocket and Made deal with two friends who are trying to be criminals.  One of them is a little too charged up by watching gangster movies.  And both made me laugh intensely.I've also read about how people didn't like watching Vince Vaughn's character.  I can see where they're coming from, to a certain extent.  But let me just say that the second time I saw it, the annoyance was almost all gone.  I don't want to give anything away.

673622,ADJKMC7AO7YN3,B00005Q4CT,Amazon Customer,"[8, 10]","By the same creative team that brought the 1996 cult 'Swingers', both Jon Favreau and buddy Vince Vaughn lay down another classic and artful black comedy on a limited budget.Writer/Director/Star Jon Favreau brings us the tale of two average guys trying to make ends meet in Los Angeles.  Bobby (Favreau) is construction by day, boxer by night, and driver to his stripper girlfriend after that just to make enough to pay the rent.  His buddy Ricky (Vaughn), sans any steady girlfriend, is in the same boat.  Wanting to better their lives, if only just slightly, they agree to do a 'mobster' type job for off-and-on again shady boss Max (Peter Falk).This brings our amateur mobsters to New York.  Armed only with a pager, a cell phone, $3,000 between them, and no directions they are on a whirlwind adventure through the Big Apple trying to figure out what they are supposed to do.  It seems that the underworld of drugs and money are always one step ahead of our bumbling duo, who are trying to keep their wits and piece the puzzle together.  But that's not easy when Ricky, who never had this kind of money before (or responsibility for that matter) wants to treat their assignment as a vacation.  Money for drinks, parties, clubs, food.  His hi-jinks almost cost them their lives on more than occasion.  A modern day Abbott and Costello.The cast of characters they meet up with are pretty funny on their own.  There's their driver Jimmy (... from the Soprano's), black drug lord who likes Italian food (Puff Daddy) and his overweight body guard Horace (who needs an inhaler).  Famke Jannsen plays Bobby's girlfriend.  The scene back in Ricky's hotel room after a night of partying is classic (don't miss the extended version in the extra's section where Vince Vaughn ad-libs for 10 minutes).There are many ingredients that make this a great movie: Strong characterization, a fresh story (not your typical mob movie), many cameo's (you'll recognize a few people from the Sopranos and more), great music, and most importantly Vince Vaughn's improvisation and ad-libs of many of his key scenes.I really don't want to give the entire story or ending away here in this review, but it is very refreshing, satisfying, and not exactly what one would expect.Now the DVD:While the movie is only 94 minutes long, there are tons of extra's which really surprises me for a film that wasn't considered a block buster.  All second-tier DVD's should have this many extra's at this price.  It is a GREAT value!Extras:- Alternate scenes and endings (quite a few here).- Outtakes (25+min.  This is worth the DVD alone.  See Vince Vaughn do multiple version of many of his key scenes in total improv.  No two takes are the same, and you'll die laughing (as apparent by onscreen buddy Jon who can't keep a straight face) and wonder where does Vince come up with this stuff!!!)- Deleted scenes (at least 20 minutes worth and they are funny).- Commentary with Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau.- Actors filmographies and bios.- 3 documentaries (about 45 minutes total), The making of 'Made', the music of 'Made', the creative process.- Both used and unused music cue's.  (Very novel idea, the first I've seen on DVD and now wonder why other don't have this?)- Scene selection.- Interactive editing game/demonstration.

Ryan ""Merribelle""","[1, 7]","Vince Vaughn (Ricky) and Jon Favreau (Bobby) are two ex-boxers that are recruited by their mob boss to go to New York for a quick delivery.  ""Odd couple"" Ricky and Bobby get into all sorts of trouble, and manage to mess up a simple job mainly due to Ricky's notions of how a macho mobster is supposed to behave.Since everything else about Made was pretty straightforward, I think the comedy aspect was supposed to come in here in the form of Vince's character, Ricky; but what started out as a low chuckle at his ceaseless, stupid banter turned to groans and ultimately bored silence.  The guy was so thoroughly clueless and relentless in displaying it that I felt a physical urge to slap him about halfway through the film.  Yes, I know, shocking.  But trust me - if you ever hear his little monologues (I strongly discourage that), you will find yourself wishing the same or worse.One way of looking at Ricky is that he is the unique creation of Vince Vaughn's genius, a showcase of the power of creating a memorable character that can evoke strong feelings.  I'll hand it to Vince, my feelings of disgust were strong all right.  The only question that remains is, why sit through an entire film punctuated by such an irritating character?

I went to it without knowing exactly what it was or what it was about but I came out of the theatre totally satisfied and laughing along with all the other audience members.&quot;Made&quot; is an unusual comedy about two loosers who have been given their first big assignment with the mafia.  Jon Favreau plays the more responsible of the two, and it is his performance that perfectly frames the beyond-belief antics of Vince Vaughn.  Vaughn's character is a total con-artist, and you get the impression that he totally slides through life on his charisma.  Vaughn manages to make a mess out of virtually every situation he is in, it is the type of thing that would normally be unbearable to watch if it wasn't so representative of so many of the people you have to deal with on a daily basis.  Actually, a good part of Vaughn's performance is that he never becomes annoying, but remains a satirical exaguration of real-life people so that you are able to laugh with him rather than at him.  The movie becomes a series of situations that make you feel like you are in a conversation with two extreemly witty people who keep driving the discussion by saying, &quot;don't you hate it when people do this?&quot; and then explain it further with a piece of situational drama that is so perfect you are immediately thrown into hysterics.Almost as a bonus, there is a story that underlies this series of jokes that is actually quite compelling.  But make no mistake, the reason to watch this movie is all Vince Vaughn.  He is given total free reign in a role that allows for anything and he makes the most of his opportunity.  I cannot think of any other actor that could have pulled this off so convincingly.  It is too bad that &quot;Made&quot; turned out to be a movie of such minor impact because Vaughn's performance is the perfect combination of performer and role.  In an era where Hollywood typically casts somebody who is the flavor of the moment, rather than truly right for the part, it is refreshing to see the right actor in the right part at the right time for a change.

Probably because auteur Jon Farveau is behind and responsible for it.Jon-Jon's swinging back into theaters with his long anticipated follow-up to Swingers, which he also wrote and starred in. Egomaniac? No just a mega-talented beau.Swingers also launched that tall glass of man, Vince Vaughn, into the mainstream. Scrumptious, and talented. Two words: Evil sexy!Made almost rejoins the Swingers characters Jon and Vince immortalized, as Mike and Trent. The Ying-n-Yang of friends. They're similar in that Vaughn is that same kind of lounge-lizard-esque con man without a con, dimwitted with an air of ill-placed superiority and Favreau is his signature calm steady, studying fellow just trying to make it in the big bad voodoo world. The wanna be tough guy/schmuckazoid with the heart of gold. Both are as relaxed and realistic as with their last teaming.The dialog too is, once again, entertaining fast paced and remarkably believable. If you love voyeuristic films where the film maker almost gives an eerie spying-on-their-lives-as-they-live-them sensation, Made's been made for you.But, please don't get me wrong. This is no remake, or hack-fest-rip-off extravaganza where a one-shot hotshot writer rewrites a couple of scenes from his first script, then repackages it with a hip title and slips it under the publics' noses. No. Made is fresh and original with two buddies who happen to be similar to his past work....Favreau, who wrote and directed this, has once again successfully mixed action, comedy and drama in equal parts. Subtle pieces, like the boys' continual arguing which leaves them progressively cut and bruised in the film, or the rapid cliche' ridden banter by Vaughn, just ad to the hilarity of Made.He and Vaughn shine so brightly together, they snagged Made's whole 1000 watt spotlight and left a 15 watt bulb for the rest of the equally bright cast.Actress, Famke Janssen, is her usual impeccable self. Once again she brings to the screen another femme fatale played to perfection. She was gorgeous as Jesse the stripper/single mom Bobby's willing to end up sleeping with the fishes for.Sean Combs was okay. Nothing spectacular or Oscar worthy...I'll wait till his next outing to judge da man. Evidently he's been Commander McBragging all around the press circuit about his spectacular performance. Maybe they edited it?Vince Vaughn had me all hot and bothered to be sure. Thank goodness he was so obnoxious in this&#65533; because at his last, sadly, hardly seen movie, The Cell, I had to be reprimanded by pimply multiplex staffettes a few times for cat calling at the screen.

The director, Favreau, misses opportunities to present another side to Vaughn, and we really miss that other layer.  Technically, the film is rough and at times unprofessional.  This gives it a raw quality, but somehow not in a good way as it did with Swingers.  Still, there's a lot of good stuff here.

I think it is a very, very funny and entertaining look at a man getting over his break-up.  The fact that it was Jon Favreau's first screenplay impressed me very much, and I waited patiently for what was next.I was pleasantly surprised watching Made.  I heard it was a mob comedy, and thought that there was no way that it would come anywhere near the humor, and undercurrent of sweetness, that Swingers had.  I was dead wrong.Favreau and Vaughn are even better together in this film.  The chemistry is amazing, and the story itself is pretty darn good.The film is basically about two lifelong friends who have to go from Cali to New York as a favor for mob boss, Peter Faulk.  Favreau's character is hesitant, but is basically forced into it because he recently screwed up his other job for the boss, bouncing for his stripper girlfriend.  Vaughn plays the friend who is arrogant, ignorrant, and loud-mouthed.  It isn't exactally Trent part 2, but it's close.  It is more like Trent, without the winning charm.  Vaughn's character has a way of angering everyone around him, and consistently screwing things up.  The two play off each other very well.  There are also some great moments between Favreau and his girlfriend's daughter.  The rest of the cast also turn in good performances - including P.Diddy, who did an impressive job in his first role.Without giving anything away, the twist in the story is never fully explained, although it isn't too complicated where you have to think about it for too long.  That is about the only complaint that I had with the film, which was a very good directoral debut.The extras on the DVD make it definately worth owning.  There is a TON of bonus material here, including quite a bit of outtakes and deleted scenes.  Unlike most DVDs, Made does distinguish between the deleted scenes, and the extended takes - putting them in different sections, which for me was a bonus.  I was expecting a better commentary track than what is offered here.  It is pretty entertaining, but after the chemistry that the duo showed in thier two movies, I was somehow expecting more.  They do spout off plenty of info regarding the locations shot, casting, and don't stray too far off what's happening on screen.  The telestrator feature gets a little overused by Vaughn, but you can always turn it off.Overall, a very good movie that should be a must buy for fans of Swingers, or just DVD collectors looking for some good extras.",5,Money baby!,1010448000,"01 8, 2002",2002,2526,"['have', 'been', 'watching', 'Swingers', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'think', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'look', 'man', 'getting', 'break-up', 'fact', 'was', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'first', 'screenplay', 'impressed', 'very', 'much', 'waited', 'patiently', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'watching', 'Made', 'heard', 'was', 'mob', 'comedy', 'thought', 'was', 'way', 'would', 'come', 'anywhere', 'humor', 'undercurrent', 'sweetness', 'Swingers', 'had', 'was', 'dead', 'wrong.Favreau', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'together', 'film', 'chemistry', 'amazing', 'story', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good.The', 'film', 'basically', 'about', 'two', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'go', 'Cali', 'New', 'York', 'favor', 'mob', 'boss', 'Peter', 'Faulk', 'Favreau', 'character', 'hesitant', 'basically', 'forced', 'recently', 'screwed', 'up', 'other', 'job', 'boss', 'bouncing', 'stripper', 'girlfriend', 'Vaughn', 'friend', 'who', 'arrogant', 'ignorrant', 'loud-mouthed', ""n't"", 'exactally', 'Trent', 'part', '2', 'close', 'more', 'like', 'Trent', 'winning', 'charm', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'way', 'angering', 'everyone', 'consistently', 'screwing', 'things', 'up', 'two', 'play', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'moments', 'Favreau', 'girlfriend', 'daughter', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'including', 'P.Diddy', 'who', 'did', 'impressive', 'job', 'first', 'role.Without', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'twist', 'story', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', ""n't"", 'too', 'complicated', 'where', 'have', 'think', 'too', 'long', 'only', 'complaint', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'directoral', 'debut.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'make', 'definately', 'worth', 'owning', 'TON', 'bonus', 'material', 'here', 'including', 'quite', 'bit', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'most', 'DVDs', 'Made', 'distinguish', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extended', 'putting', 'different', 'sections', 'was', 'bonus', 'was', 'expecting', 'better', 'commentary', 'track', 'what', 'offered', 'here', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'chemistry', 'duo', 'showed', 'thier', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'somehow', 'expecting', 'more', 'do', 'spout', 'off', 'plenty', 'info', 'regarding', 'locations', 'shot', 'casting', 'do', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'off', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'telestrator', 'feature', 'little', 'overused', 'Vaughn', 'can', 'always', 'turn', 'off.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'buy', 'fans', 'Swingers', 'just', 'DVD', 'collectors', 'looking', 'good', 'extras']",N/A

673637,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00005Q4CT,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[2, 4]","Those expecting a work as appealing as Swingers may be in for a disappointment here. While this film does boast a few interesting and humorous sequences, the pull of the premise is done in by way too many scenes of the two main characters--Bobby (Jon Favreau) and Ricky (Vince Vaughn)--arguing with each other. Their arguments are far too frequent and petty to counterbalance whatever great moments the film does have.  The &quot;Banter Brothers&quot; (my term) are seen at the beginning of the film sparring with each other in a boxing ring, and that definitely sets the stage for the remainder of the movie.In fact, these two characters dominate the film, and while that in and of itself is not a reason for a movie to sink under the weight of its own material, in this case, the constant combativeness between these two results in just that happening.  There's just too much emphasis on these two and nowhere near enough attention paid to other characters.  In a cameo role, Bud Cort is great, but used far too little.  Sean (Puff Daddy) Combs is effective as a mob captain, but is also not a developed character.  As Bobby's girlfriend, Famke Janssen similarly is an underdeveloped character; she's a lap dancer with a daughter who ultimately decides her career is most important, but we never see much of why she's made that decision.  Peter Falk, as the representative of mob psychology at work (he's the &quot;boss&quot;, Max) is fine, but he has, again, dialogue to work with that emphasizes how little is going on here.The soundtrack is a much too self-conscious mix of most musical genres in the book--jazz, spaghetti western music, hip-hop, pop, and folk.  The intent here appears to be to throw in whatever &quot;enhances&quot; the mood of the moment, but since those moments are typically superficial, the music actually serves to underline the superficiality rather than strengthen the film.The point of this film seems to be that two guys can't get involved in illegal activity together without butting heads.  The reason Swingers worked so well is because the banter of the dialogue--although often argumentative--was also simultaneously so full of fresh and witty humor that the combativeness does not weigh down the proceedings.  In fact, the combativeness in the Swingers dialogue adds to the humor.

673639,A1VCPMT1RRS7K0,B00005Q4CT,Matt,"[5, 5]","Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn are together again in ""Made"". We first saw them together in Swingers. This time around, there is a much different plot, although the dynamic between them doesn't change all that much. Favreau is still the voice of reason, while Vaughn is the life of the party.The characters they play this time are far worse off. Bobby and Ricky have it rough and so they decide to take a job for a mob boss (played wonderfully by Peter Falk). It's amusing to see characters like Bobby and Ricky in this situation - as they don't quite fit the mold of mob ""muscle"". Ricky is constantly putting his foot in his mouth and he comes close to blowing everything a few times, but Bobby is always there to reel him back in and handle the situation. Ricky does come up big for everyone in the end, though.This is a funny movie. I love the interplay between Favreau and Vaughn. That is probably the sole reason why the movie works so well. If Favreau had written the script for any other actors, it is possible that we may never have heard of it. But, as it is, this is a very entertaining movie and I recommend it to those who enjoyed Swingers.

673640,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005Q4CT,Matthew Horner,"[7, 9]","In 1996 writer / director / actor John Favreau made a quirky comedy that spoofed the LA lifestyle. It was called Swingers, and it became a cult classic. In Made, his new movie, he again takes comedic aim, this time at petty criminals and gangsters. The results are quite funny, not because of the rather slim story, but because of the incredible rapport between Favreau and costar Vince Vaughn, whom he also acted with in Swingers. They make quite a pair, and one would hope that their appearing together in movies becomes a tradition over the years.Bobby [Favreau] has a messed up life. He's a professional boxer, but he isn't a very good one. To support himself, he's a driver for his live-in girlfriend, Jessica Famke Jenssen]. She's an exotic dancer, and he's the jealous type. That's not a good combination. After Bobby slugs a customer he thinks got too close to Jessica, he finds himself in trouble with his and Jessica's boss, Max [Peter Falk], a sort of minor league mob boss in LA. At home Bobby, who at heart is a good guy, must deal with Jessica's sensitive little girl. He's much more of a father to her than Jessica is a mother. Sensibly, Max relieves Bobby of his job of protecting Jessica by offering him something else. He wants him to see that a mysterious package is safely delivered to a British mobster in New York. Bobby agrees, but only if he can take his best friend, Ricky [Vaughn], along. It's an understatement to say that the trip does not go smoothly.The story may not sound like much. It certainly isn't original. Favreau wrote the screenplay, and this is a good example of success not in what you say, but how you say it. He also throws in this idea: Bobby and Ricky have been best friends since childhood. They have shared nearly everything. Now comes a great opportunity Bobby naturally wants to share with his friend. The problem is that Ricky is an idiot. He always messes up whatever he touches. He doesn't know how to shut up, he doesn't know when to keep the truth to himself, he thinks he's always right, and he can make life's simplest choices extremely complicated.I can relate to this comic setup. I think a lot of us can. Don't many of us have a friend or close relative who's not working with a full deck? I don't say this to be unkind. It's just a fact. And out of loyalty, compassion, habit and/or even out of love, don't we sometimes include that person in our affairs, even though common sense tells us not to? Such people may be a mess, but they can also inadvertantly make our lives somehow richer.Favreau's character is the central one, but, as a director, he choses to highlight Vaughn's Ricky. This works because Vaughn is such a remarkable actor. To be sure, he has a lot of idiosyncrasies which have played against him when he has tried to be a leading man in other projects. There is a wildness about him and just a touch of menace, but it's more of a menacing humorousness than an evil aura. Give him an oddball character like Ricky, and he's in his element. His genius lies in his ability to take such a goof ball and make him real and endearing. A lesser actor would have made Ricky so obnoxious we never could have related to him. That, in turn, would have ruined the movie.",4,Funny spoof of mobster movies,1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,3234,"['1996', 'writer', '/', 'director', '/', 'actor', 'John', 'Favreau', 'made', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'spoofed', 'LA', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'called', 'Swingers', 'became', 'cult', 'classic', 'Made', 'new', 'movie', 'again', 'comedic', 'aim', 'time', 'petty', 'criminals', 'gangsters', 'results', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'not', 'rather', 'slim', 'story', 'incredible', 'rapport', 'Favreau', 'costar', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'whom', 'also', 'acted', 'Swingers', 'make', 'pair', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'appearing', 'together', 'movies', 'tradition', 'years.Bobby', '[', 'Favreau', ']', 'messed', 'up', 'life', 'professional', 'boxer', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'one', 'support', 'driver', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'Jessica', 'Famke', 'Jenssen', ']', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'jealous', 'type', 'not', 'good', 'combination', 'Bobby', 'slugs', 'customer', 'got', 'too', 'close', 'Jessica', 'trouble', 'Jessica', 'boss', 'Max', '[', 'Peter', 'Falk', ']', 'sort', 'minor', 'league', 'mob', 'boss', 'LA', 'home', 'Bobby', 'who', 'heart', 'good', 'guy', 'must', 'deal', 'Jessica', 'sensitive', 'little', 'girl', 'much', 'more', 'father', 'Jessica', 'mother', 'Sensibly', 'Max', 'Bobby', 'job', 'protecting', 'Jessica', 'offering', 'something', 'else', 'see', 'mysterious', 'package', 'safely', 'delivered', 'British', 'mobster', 'New', 'York', 'Bobby', 'only', 'can', 'take', 'best', 'friend', 'Ricky', '[', 'Vaughn', ']', 'understatement', 'say', 'trip', 'not', 'go', 'smoothly.The', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'much', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'original', 'Favreau', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'good', 'example', 'success', 'not', 'what', 'say', 'how', 'say', 'also', 'idea', 'Bobby', 'Ricky', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'childhood', 'have', 'shared', 'nearly', 'everything', 'Now', 'great', 'opportunity', 'Bobby', 'naturally', 'share', 'friend', 'problem', 'Ricky', 'idiot', 'always', 'up', 'whatever', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'shut', 'up', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'keep', 'truth', 'always', 'right', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'simplest', 'choices', 'extremely', 'complicated.I', 'can', 'relate', 'comic', 'setup', 'think', 'lot', 'can', 'Do', ""n't"", 'many', 'have', 'friend', 'close', 'relative', 'who', 'not', 'working', 'full', 'deck', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'be', 'unkind', 'just', 'fact', 'loyalty', 'compassion', 'habit', 'and/or', 'even', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'sometimes', 'include', 'person', 'affairs', 'even', 'common', 'sense', 'tells', 'not', 'Such', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'mess', 'can', 'also', 'inadvertantly', 'make', 'lives', 'somehow', 'richer.Favreau', 'character', 'central', 'one', 'director', 'highlight', 'Vaughn', 'Ricky', 'Vaughn', 'such', 'remarkable', 'actor', 'be', 'sure', 'lot', 'idiosyncrasies', 'have', 'played', 'when', 'tried', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'other', 'projects', 'wildness', 'just', 'touch', 'menace', 'more', 'menacing', 'humorousness', 'evil', 'aura', 'Give', 'oddball', 'character', 'Ricky', 'element', 'genius', 'ability', 'take', 'goof', 'ball', 'make', 'real', 'endearing', 'lesser', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Ricky', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'related', 'turn', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'movie']",N/A

673642,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005Q4CT,Michael Crane,"[12, 14]","""Made"" is the story of two misfit boxers who are best buddies (even though they're always arguing and fighting).  Bobby is dating a dancer and doesn't like what her job entails, so he's hoping that he can find something that will solve their money problems so she won't have to dance anymore.  Ricky is a fast-talking and always outspoken character who thinks he's all that when in reality he doesn't have a clue.  The two friends are offered a gig by a mob boss that offers a big payoff.  It's their chance to live the life of the gangsters that they grew up watching in movies.  However, they're about to learn how different real life is from the movies... and how horrible they are at being gangsters.This isn't the type of comedy that offers the obvious laughs or a ""wacky"" finale.  There are no ""zany"" gimmicks or an over-the-top plot.  The movie relies on the tone, which is very subtle and has great timing.  The characters are real because they are written that way.  While it may be hard to believe that any mob boss would give these two guys a job, we're able to buy it because it's written and structured in a very realistic manner.  This is probably why the film isn't overly popular with many folks, but that's fine by me.  I really enjoyed myself when I watched this, and even had a better time watching it the second time.  Jon Favreau is great in his role, as he knows that he's not the showstopper and has to make sure that he's subtle and mostly quiet--that is, unless he's arguing with his buddy.  Vince Vaughn is the definite showstopper, and you can tell that he has a lot of fun with the role.  He plays it perfectly, and I'm convinced that nobody else could pull off such a stunt.  We also must not forget the very funny Peter Falk, and it must be said that Sean Combs (""Puffy"") does a very good job with his part as well.I must warn you that the movie has TONS of profanities in it.  It even outdoes ""The Big Lebowski"" in the F-Bomb department, believe it or not.  If you're not a fan of non-stop vulgar language, then you better stay clear from this.  I think the language works because the movie is trying to play like a ""Goodfellas"" gone completely wrong.  The DVD has some really great special features.  The picture looks really good, and the sound isn't bad either.  Some of the extras include commentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, a scene edit workshop, documentaries and much, much more.  Plenty of goodies to play around with.""Made"" is a movie that really worked for me.  I think it's an extremely clever comedy that is character-driven all the way.  It's entertainingly written and very well directed.  Keep in mind that you will be taking a chance on this one if you decide to check it out.  People have mixed feelings about it.  With that in mind, I would suggest that you rent it first before you decide to purchase, just to be on the safe side.  It's a short movie so it won't take up much of your life should you end up not liking it.  If you're looking for a funny comedy that doesn't rely on the usual gags, then this is something that is worth checking out. -Michael Crane",4,They ain't no Goodfellas...,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,3114,"['Made', 'story', 'two', 'misfit', 'boxers', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'buddies', 'even', ""'re"", 'always', 'arguing', 'fighting', 'Bobby', 'dating', 'dancer', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'job', 'entails', 'hoping', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'will', 'solve', 'money', 'problems', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'dance', 'anymore', 'Ricky', 'fast-talking', 'always', 'outspoken', 'character', 'who', 'when', 'reality', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'two', 'friends', 'are', 'offered', 'gig', 'mob', 'boss', 'big', 'payoff', 'chance', 'live', 'life', 'gangsters', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'movies', 'However', ""'re"", 'learn', 'how', 'different', 'real', 'life', 'movies', 'how', 'horrible', 'are', 'being', 'gangsters.This', ""n't"", 'type', 'comedy', 'obvious', 'laughs', 'wacky', 'finale', 'are', 'zany', 'gimmicks', 'over-the-top', 'plot', 'movie', 'tone', 'very', 'subtle', 'great', 'timing', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'are', 'written', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'believe', 'mob', 'boss', 'would', 'give', 'two', 'guys', 'job', ""'re"", 'able', 'buy', 'written', 'structured', 'very', 'realistic', 'manner', 'probably', 'why', 'film', ""n't"", 'overly', 'popular', 'many', 'folks', 'fine', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'watched', 'even', 'had', 'better', 'time', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'great', 'role', 'not', 'showstopper', 'make', 'sure', 'subtle', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'arguing', 'buddy', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'definite', 'showstopper', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'fun', 'role', 'perfectly', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'nobody', 'else', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'stunt', 'also', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'very', 'funny', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'Puffy', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'well.I', 'must', 'warn', 'movie', 'TONS', 'profanities', 'even', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'F-Bomb', 'department', 'believe', 'not', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'non-stop', 'vulgar', 'language', 'then', 'better', 'stay', 'clear', 'think', 'language', 'movie', 'trying', 'play', 'Goodfellas', 'gone', 'completely', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'really', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'picture', 'really', 'good', 'sound', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'scene', 'edit', 'workshop', 'documentaries', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'Plenty', 'goodies', 'play', 'around', 'Made', 'movie', 'really', 'worked', 'think', 'extremely', 'clever', 'comedy', 'character-driven', 'way', 'entertainingly', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'Keep', 'mind', 'will', 'be', 'taking', 'chance', 'one', 'decide', 'check', 'out', 'People', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'mind', 'would', 'suggest', 'rent', 'first', 'decide', 'purchase', 'just', 'be', 'safe', 'side', 'short', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'much', 'life', 'should', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'liking', ""'re"", 'looking', 'funny', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'rely', 'usual', 'gags', 'then', 'something', 'checking', 'out', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

Also, his schtickdoesn't seem entirely convincing, as he seems entirely toointellectual, too literate and too comfortable in his Columbomannerisms that he's inculcated in his other role. There is anidentical flaw in selecting P Diddy playing a mobster, consideringmost people won't separate the real life persona from the actorplaying his role in this picture, perhaps due to lack of time inacting school, although Diddy does manage a valuable presence, asdoes Falk.The story, to me, fails in terms of coherence, and above all,entertainment value, as it seems written by someone with a badhangover, such that a minimalist, direct sequence of events isshown, which takes away from the credibility of the movie, (as it'stoo often demonstrated in low-budget TV pictures.)The strong point, is the realism of the scenario, a money launderingcash drop, among several gangsters. There's an important issueraised, also, which are the low moral standards and confusedbehavior seen in certain social circles, which shocks newcomers,(such as Favreau's character)  when they come into contact with it,such that he returns the money from the job, by prefering to box,not to be a gangster.Not a film most would want to see a 2nd or 3rd, time, losing pointsfor its chaotic and confused approach that even Vaughn couldn't undothe mess.",1,"Casting missteps, chaotic and confused script, not serious",1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,2123,"['MADE', 'released', '2001', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'interest', 'viewers', 'weighingVince', 'Vaughn', 'cult', 'status', 'curiosity', 'surrounding', 'thescript.Unfortunately', 'entertainment', 'promises', 'made', 'turn', 'out', 'short', 'inmore', 'ways', 'one.First', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'great', 'acting', 'jobas', 'straight', 'man', 'reminiscent', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Vaughnputs', 'solid', 'effort', 'comedian', '2', 'gangstertrainees', 'latter', ""n't"", 'manage', 'put', 'magic', 'difference', 'matters', 'overall', 'story', 'justhis', 'usual', 'artful', 'skill', 'verbal', 'exchanges', 'otherprotagonists.The', 'errors', 'were', 'perhaps', 'casting', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'lead', 'mobster', 'inthis', 'film', 'considering', 'number', 'years', 'actor', 'beentype-cast', 'television', 'actor', 'playing', 'Columbo', 'Also', 'schtickdoes', ""n't"", 'seem', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'entirely', 'toointellectual', 'too', 'literate', 'too', 'comfortable', 'Columbomannerisms', 'inculcated', 'other', 'role', 'anidentical', 'flaw', 'selecting', 'P', 'Diddy', 'playing', 'mobster', 'consideringmost', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'separate', 'real', 'life', 'persona', 'actorplaying', 'role', 'picture', 'perhaps', 'due', 'lack', 'time', 'inacting', 'school', 'Diddy', 'manage', 'valuable', 'presence', 'Falk.The', 'story', 'terms', 'coherence', 'entertainment', 'value', 'written', 'someone', 'badhangover', 'such', 'minimalist', 'direct', 'sequence', 'events', 'isshown', 'away', 'credibility', 'movie', ""it'stoo"", 'often', 'demonstrated', 'low-budget', 'TV', 'pictures', 'strong', 'point', 'realism', 'scenario', 'money', 'launderingcash', 'drop', 'several', 'gangsters', 'important', 'issueraised', 'also', 'are', 'low', 'moral', 'standards', 'confusedbehavior', 'seen', 'certain', 'social', 'circles', 'newcomers', 'such', 'Favreau', 'character', 'when', 'come', 'contact', 'such', 'money', 'job', 'prefering', 'box', 'not', 'be', 'gangster.Not', 'film', 'most', 'would', 'want', 'see', '2nd', '3rd', 'time', 'losing', 'pointsfor', 'chaotic', 'confused', 'approach', 'even', 'Vaughn', 'could', ""n't"", 'undothe', 'mess']",N/A

McNally ""Author, 'CLASS DISMISSED: 75 Outr...","[3, 4]","In 1996, Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn made an unforgettable duo as swinging bachelors Mike and Trent in the indie comedy smash ""Swingers."" Five years later, they reteamed for ""Made,"" another film written by Favreau and starring the dynamite duo. This time, Favreau is also behind the camera, directing his first feature film. Do Favreau and Vaughn rise to the occasion again?The answer, happily, is a resounding yes. ""Made"" is a sharply written, nicely acted comedy with plenty of laughs. While the film is different than ""Swingers"" in many ways, it does share one important trait with the earlier film: Favreau again plays the more soft-spoken, grounded of the two, while Vaughn is the cockier, more outgoing one. This time, though, Vaughn's character isn't ""money"" at all -- he has a remarkable knack for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time and creating problems out of the most innocent situations.Favreau stars as Bobby, a noble-hearted boxer who earns extra money by escorting his stripper girlfriend Jess (Famke Janssen) to her appointments. Bobby's not cut out for the job, though, and when a customer gets too touchy-feely with Jess, Bobby delivers a beat-down. Problem is, the guy he kicked the c--- out of is a wealthy gent, and this causes some problems for Bobby's boss Max (a highly effective Peter Falk). As a result, Max ""fires"" him from his bodyguard role and gives him a different assignment: Fly to New York and take care of some business for him there.Bobby insists on taking along his childhood friend Ricky (Vaughn), who for all his idiocy is as loyal a friend as they come. Once in New York, they're picked up by a tough-looking limo driver (Vincent Pastore) and given some cryptic instructions that eventually lead them to crime boss Ruiz (rapper Sean Combs, a.k.a. P. Diddy, making a solid acting debut).Much of the film's tension and laughs are generated by seeing whether Ricky's foolish antics will land him and Bobby in trouble, ruin their assignment, or even get them killed. Favreau and Vaughn again demonstrate a spectacular rapport that is a treat to watch. Vaughn is particularly impressive in a tricky role that could have been disastrous if handled incorrectly. Instead, Vaughn gives an off-kilter performance that establishes the perfect tone.Speaking of tone, director Favreau does an admirable job of navigating back and forth between comedy and drama. Perhaps part of his confidence comes from knowing that he wrote the excellent script, which again shows his superb ear for dialogue.""Made"" boasts a darker feel than Swingers, and credit Favreau and Vaughn for not tossing out another rehash of that earlier film. While it may not be ""Swingers,"" ""Made"" is a gem in its own right and one of the best comedies of the decade.",5,"Against the odds, Favreau and Vaughn are money once again",1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,2766,"['1996', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'made', 'unforgettable', 'duo', 'swinging', 'bachelors', 'Mike', 'Trent', 'indie', 'comedy', 'smash', 'Swingers', 'Five', 'years', 'later', 'reteamed', 'Made', 'film', 'written', 'Favreau', 'starring', 'dynamite', 'duo', 'time', 'Favreau', 'also', 'camera', 'directing', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Do', 'Favreau', 'Vaughn', 'rise', 'occasion', 'again', 'answer', 'happily', 'resounding', 'yes', 'Made', 'sharply', 'written', 'nicely', 'acted', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'film', 'different', 'Swingers', 'many', 'ways', 'share', 'one', 'important', 'trait', 'earlier', 'film', 'Favreau', 'again', 'more', 'soft-spoken', 'grounded', 'two', 'Vaughn', 'cockier', 'more', 'outgoing', 'one', 'time', 'though', 'Vaughn', 'character', ""n't"", 'money', 'remarkable', 'knack', 'saying', 'wrong', 'thing', 'wrong', 'time', 'creating', 'problems', 'most', 'innocent', 'situations.Favreau', 'stars', 'Bobby', 'noble-hearted', 'boxer', 'who', 'extra', 'money', 'escorting', 'stripper', 'girlfriend', 'Jess', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'appointments', 'Bobby', 'not', 'cut', 'out', 'job', 'though', 'when', 'customer', 'too', 'touchy-feely', 'Jess', 'Bobby', 'beat-down', 'Problem', 'guy', 'kicked', 'c', 'wealthy', 'gent', 'problems', 'Bobby', 'boss', 'Max', 'highly', 'effective', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'result', 'Max', 'fires', 'bodyguard', 'role', 'different', 'assignment', 'Fly', 'New', 'York', 'take', 'care', 'business', 'there.Bobby', 'insists', 'taking', 'along', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Ricky', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'idiocy', 'loyal', 'friend', 'come', 'Once', 'New', 'York', ""'re"", 'picked', 'up', 'tough-looking', 'limo', 'driver', 'Vincent', 'Pastore', 'given', 'cryptic', 'instructions', 'eventually', 'lead', 'crime', 'boss', 'Ruiz', 'rapper', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'a.k.a', 'P.', 'Diddy', 'making', 'solid', 'acting', 'debut', '.Much', 'film', 'tension', 'laughs', 'are', 'generated', 'seeing', 'Ricky', 'foolish', 'antics', 'will', 'land', 'Bobby', 'trouble', 'ruin', 'assignment', 'even', 'get', 'killed', 'Favreau', 'Vaughn', 'again', 'demonstrate', 'spectacular', 'rapport', 'treat', 'watch', 'Vaughn', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'tricky', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'disastrous', 'handled', 'incorrectly', 'Instead', 'Vaughn', 'off-kilter', 'performance', 'perfect', 'tone.Speaking', 'tone', 'director', 'Favreau', 'admirable', 'job', 'navigating', 'back', 'forth', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Perhaps', 'part', 'confidence', 'knowing', 'wrote', 'excellent', 'script', 'again', 'superb', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'Made', 'darker', 'feel', 'Swingers', 'credit', 'Favreau', 'Vaughn', 'not', 'tossing', 'out', 'rehash', 'earlier', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Swingers', 'Made', 'gem', 'own', 'right', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'decade']",N/A

And don't believe the reviews you read telling you that if you like one you'll like the other.""Made"" is John Farvreau's attempt at a crime film, not exactly a spoof on one. The only spoof aspect of it is Ricky, played by Vince Vaughn. Otherwise it seems like a pretty straightforward, somewhat realistic crime movie.Bobby (Favreau) and Ricky are amateur boxers, pretty bad ones at that, who end up doing a job for their boss (played by Peter Falk) which takes them from their native LA to New York. There they meet Ruiz who is, believe it or not, played by P. Diddy. They bumble their way through the operation, finally returning to LA where Bobby wraps things up with his girlfriend and her child.The main problem to me was Vince Vaughn. His character (Ricky) has absolutely no redeeming qualities. He is one of the most irritating, idiotic, annoying characters I've ever seen portrayed on film. The character he played in ""Swingers"" was similar - a loud-mouth know-it-all - but he had some redeeming qualities. He obviously cared about his friends, he did know when to draw the line, he wasn't all talk - women did like him, etc. In ""Made"" none of these qualities exist. He's just the self-centered loud-mouth who doesn't know when to quit and seems intent on getting himself and everyone around him killed.While this is funny at times, it ends up just getting old and almost uncomfortable to watch. It's not entirely fair to compare this movie to ""Swingers,"" but that seems unavoidable and its only saving grace. I don't think this movie would have had any success at all were it not for its predecessor, because it's just not that fun watching Vince Vaughn be an idiot in this one because there's nothing to redeem him. I'd say rent it before buying to make sure you like it - don't assume you'll like it because you liked ""Swingers.""

673657,A2ASJ0IHIAOUW8,B00005Q4CT,T. Laxson,"[3, 3]","This film, which was greatly improvised on the set, is a genuinely comical and entertaining film.  While far from a life-altering, enigmatic, well-crafted, and spiritual masterpiece, the film retains its own merits by admittedly and conspicuously straying from weighty subject matter and excessive attention to detail.  For example, there are quite a few obvious continuity errors and a boom mic seen in a mirror.  However, these &quot;mistakes&quot; have no negative impact on the film.  On the commentary track, Favreau and Vaughn point out every one of these &quot;flaws,&quot; while claiming that for this type of film such miniscule shortcomings are inconsequential.  This film--unlike most--is completely about the characters, as opposed to the filmmaking style, the plot, or any significant theme.  It is merely a portrayal of two average guys estranged in a world of violence and crime.The profusion of profanities throughout the film may be a hindrance to the appreciation of some viewers; however, to others it simply adds yet another element of humor.  In one particular scene on the &quot;action commentary&quot; with Favreau and Vaughn, they point out the ridiculous realms of obscenity that the characters travel to, by tallying up the number of uses of the &quot;F-word&quot; in a one minute argument.  They are not expressing an adoration for such language; rather, they are mocking their own inabilities as actors, writers, and as human beings.  When viewed from this perspective the film is infinitely more enjoyable.What sets this film above so many others--enough to be given five stars--is the complacency with which the filmmakers dared to produce and release such a simplistic, far-fetched, and somewhat dull film.  That is not to say that the film lacks energy or progression, but just that it does not display those attributes with the methods that American film audiences are accustomed to, causing it to seem to drag or become self-indulgent at times.I've done a poor job of justifying my 5 star rating, but that's because of the inherent mysterious appeal of the film.  It is just original in so many respects, while also being quite familiar in others.
