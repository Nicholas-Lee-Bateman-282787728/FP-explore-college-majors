791196,A3RODEQMP1IY51,B000127ZC8,"Allison Fox ""Film Fanatic & Philosopher""","[34, 41]","I thought this Canadian movie was pretty well made.  I love heist movies or films where they use really cool, high-tech ways of breaking into safes and other things... so this one was right up my alley.  I can't say I was disappointed.  The movie starts out with a group of three people who, for fun only, plan how to break into places and safes ... making their plans ""foolproof"" so that they are able to go off without a hitch (it's just a game to them).  They never carry out their plans though ... until a set of their plans is stolen.  Then a mob-like guy contacts them and makes them break into a safe for him.  I don't want to give too much away because it has good twists and turns in it.  But if you are looking for an entertaining, exciting, funny, interesting movie, definitely give this one a try.  Ryan Renolds is a great actor - he made the movie better just by being it.  The supporting cast was pretty good as well.  It wasn't an award winning movie or anything, but for a night at home watching a decent movie... it's perfect.  Also, check out the extras on the DVD.  As stated in the Trivia section on IMDB, an interesting tidbit: The movie was not only the widest release of a Canadian movie in history (as of October 2003), but had a record-breaking marketing budget of $2 million.",4,Foolproof isn't quite foolproof ... but close.,1092528000,"08 15, 2004",2004,1301,"['thought', 'Canadian', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'love', 'heist', 'movies', 'films', 'where', 'use', 'really', 'cool', 'high-tech', 'ways', 'breaking', 'safes', 'other', 'things', 'so', 'one', 'was', 'right', 'alley', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'out', 'group', 'three', 'people', 'who', 'fun', 'only', 'plan', 'how', 'break', 'places', 'safes', 'making', 'plans', 'foolproof', 'are', 'able', 'go', 'off', 'hitch', 'just', 'game', 'never', 'carry', 'out', 'plans', 'set', 'plans', 'stolen', 'Then', 'mob-like', 'guy', 'contacts', 'break', 'safe', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'good', 'twists', 'are', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'funny', 'interesting', 'movie', 'definitely', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'Ryan', 'Renolds', 'great', 'actor', 'made', 'movie', 'better', 'just', 'being', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'award', 'winning', 'movie', 'anything', 'night', 'home', 'watching', 'decent', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Also', 'check', 'out', 'extras', 'DVD', 'stated', 'Trivia', 'section', 'IMDB', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'widest', 'release', 'Canadian', 'movie', 'history', 'October', '2003', 'had', 'record-breaking', 'marketing', 'budget', '2', 'million']",N/A

I had never heard of it, but I always had a certain weakness for crime caper movies and so I decided to give it a try.I am pleased that I did.The plot involves three friends who are planning a heist on a diamond-trading house. They have laid out intricate plans for the job worked out through months of surveillance and training.Then, the said plans are stolen by a mob-like figure, played by a wonderfully villainous David Suchet (of TV's POIROT fame) pulls off the job using their plans as a blueprint. With the plans in-hand (complete with some nice clean prints of the three friends) Suchet's character then blackmails the three to come up with a plan and execute the theft of $30 million in bonds from a highly secure bank vault.The manner in which the heist is pulled and the clever little twist at the end (which I personally never saw coming) means what we have here is a nice lower budget but in some ways more intelligent take on the Clooney vehicle mentioned above. The cast all turn in admirable performances with Kristen Booth a real find both in beauty and talent and the always watchable Ryan Reynolds and Suchet bringing the movie into a higher class.Recommended",4,Canadians can do it too -- and better,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,1555,"['entertaining', 'Canadian', 'caper', 'movie', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', '2001', 'OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', '2003', 'remake', 'THE', 'ITALIAN', 'JOB', 'yet', 'A-list', 'star', 'power', 'propelled', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'blockbuster', 'lists.I', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'when', 'programmed', 'TiVo', 'record', 'one', 'Encore', 'channels', 'weekend', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'always', 'had', 'certain', 'weakness', 'crime', 'caper', 'movies', 'so', 'decided', 'give', 'try.I', 'am', 'pleased', 'did.The', 'plot', 'involves', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'heist', 'diamond-trading', 'house', 'have', 'laid', 'out', 'intricate', 'plans', 'job', 'worked', 'out', 'months', 'surveillance', 'training.Then', 'said', 'plans', 'are', 'stolen', 'mob-like', 'figure', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'villainous', 'David', 'Suchet', 'TV', 'POIROT', 'fame', 'job', 'using', 'plans', 'blueprint', 'plans', 'in-hand', 'complete', 'nice', 'clean', 'prints', 'three', 'friends', 'Suchet', 'character', 'then', 'three', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'execute', 'theft', '30', 'million', 'bonds', 'highly', 'secure', 'bank', 'vault.The', 'manner', 'heist', 'pulled', 'clever', 'little', 'twist', 'end', 'personally', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'nice', 'lower', 'budget', 'ways', 'more', 'intelligent', 'take', 'Clooney', 'vehicle', 'mentioned', 'cast', 'turn', 'admirable', 'performances', 'Kristen', 'Booth', 'real', 'find', 'beauty', 'talent', 'always', 'watchable', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Suchet', 'bringing', 'movie', 'higher', 'class.Recommended']",N/A

Ryan Reynolds is engaging enough as Kevin, the slick and guileful young mastermind. Together with the sexy and athletic Sam (Kristin Booth) and designated techie Rob (Joris Jarsky), they stage complicated heist scenarios. But they do these merely as challenging exercises. They don't actually go thru with them. That is, until they meet Leo ""the Touch"" Gillette (David Suchet), a  gentlemanly thug who blackmails the gang into breaking in and robbing a high-tech security building's vault of its 20 million dollars in unregistered bonds.Predictably, various tensions and conflicts arise within the group, and then a change of allegiance throws a spanner in the works. Also complicating matters is a persistent police detective (always cheesily trenchcoated) who's keeping a suspicious eye on Kevin. Will Kevin pull off a foolproof scheme that'll keep himself and his friends out of prison and also turn the tables on Gillette?The twists and turns here are, of course, preresquisite in a heist movie. However, it was still fun watching the backstabbings and switcheroos, double switcheroos, and false jeopardies. Near the end of the film, my head was spinning a bit and I didn't know whose side some of these characters were actually on. Also fun to watch was the intricate execution of the caper, from step one all the way to its culmination, as the crew utilizes a combination of high and low tech methods and tools in carrying out their plan. Foolproof also contains a dose of low key humor, which is well integrated into the storyline.Ryan Reynolds, compared to his other more wacky roles, is more subdued here as Kevin, and his charm and screen presence elevate this unpretentious caper flick. David Suchet, who is more well-known for portraying Hercule Poirot and for his lead villain role on Executive Decision, is pretty good as the baddie Leo ""the Touch,"" snaky suave and utterly ruthless. I gotta admit I started crushing a bit on Kristin Booth's character, who is willful, brash, steeped into martial arts, and sexy as all get out. Even though she was a tad cross-eyed.Running at a fast 94 minutes, this surprisingly entertaining movie is an overlooked Canadian gem. It's almost bare bones in its scenes, with no room for excess fluff.

However, someone figures out what they are doing, steals one of their plans and commits the robbery.

But everything they do is doable. Meaning that every aspect - from physical agility to technical expertise - represents a genuine effort to take down real money scores.It's all fun and games - until someone else notices the three friends playing around pretending to be 'robbers'.That person likes what he sees. His appreciation for the trio's talent is immense and he wants them to turn their games into real jobs. For which they will be handsomely rewarded.But it's not a offer - it's an order.And if they don't comply - pain and punishment will follow. He coldly intimates refusal means the very best they can hope for is to see the inside of a prison, and at the very worst - hints at three anonymous graves in the woods.The man who has a literal and figurative pulse on all criminal activities in the city is one Leo Gillette - like the razor. A cold-blooded crime lord played to perfection by eminent British thespian David Suchet. Though mostly known as his legendary counterpart, detective Hercule Poiroit, I know him as an artist well adapted to play the bad guy. My introduction to the actor came from a wonderfully twisted film that almost no-one remembers - 'The Last Innocent Man' from 1988 - where he portrayed a viciously clever psychopath.They don't' have a choice but to comply.What are they going to do to get out from under this murderer's thumb?Overall, a enjoyable rental worth seeing.The one ding to this generally fun movie was Kristin Booth as Sam.

Beard?  Goatee?  Why, then he's probably a ruff-n-buff take-no-guff rumbler, perhaps a cop or mercenary do-gooder.  Clean shaven with a smarmy grin?  Why, then he's probably a fast-talkin' slick-n-sassy womanizer who is struggling with personal demons in spite of his uber-confident exterior.""Foolproof"" is unique, not just because it was the most expensive and most widely released Canadian film for its time, but also because it showcases Reynolds as an enjoyable mix of both of his time-tested cinema personas.  He isn't wholly one or the other.  In this case, he is Kevin, an insurance claims investigator who, along with his friends Sam (Kristin Booth) and Rob (Joris Jarsky), spend their spare time figuring out ""foolproof"" plans for daring robberies and bold heists.They don't ever actually plan to DO any of said robberies/heists; these are just brain exercises, you see, ways to expand the mind and flex one's mental muscles.  (And here my idea of stretching the brain is doing crossword puzzles on the john.)  Unfortunately, the paperwork on their latest project -- a flawless and meticulously crafted diamond caper -- is stolen and used, with all clues pointing back to them.  The culprit, a mobster named Leo, recognizes their skill and coerces them into planning and pulling off one last ""foolproof"" stunt for him.It's a caper movie on several levels, since Leo is not only taking advantage of but is also manipulating Kevin and his crew, splintering long-honored trusts, watering doubt where it was sown long ago.  Kevin, Sam, and Rob do a good job of getting us to believe they have the brainpower to come up with plans where every base is covered, but Leo introduces a human element that makes ""foolproof"" seem like a contradiction in terms.  People aren't as easy to figure out as locks and security alarm systems.Reynolds pulls off the balance between his frat boy mugging and tough guy frustration quite well, and he's working alongside some other players that, while maybe not mainstream faces, are just as up for the task.  The script and the story don't need much help though; this is a story that sort of tells itself, although the twists at the end -- while plausible and delightful -- might come across as a little ludicrous.  Still, when you've got three twenty-somethings with desk jobs whose idea of a fun day off is planning high-profile crimes in elaborate detail, well, words like ""ludicrous"" don't really play into the equation.  It's a fun little film, snarky and slick, fast-paced without snags, and equal measures of smart and silly.

These folks (just slightly older than those in the other two films) have been playing at being robbers; planning and rehearsing elaborate burglary schemes but stopping short of actually putting their plans into action. But a local hood discovers one of their plans and executes it, then threatens to frame them for the crime unless they assist him in pulling off a $20 Million heist.This is an $8 Million Canadian production, pretty big money for their film industry and almost all of it makes it onto the screen. It actually has a better look than the $80 Million ""Enemy of the State"" although they cheat a bit and under light almost every scene. The caper itself is pretty ordinary and obviously overused but the misdirection is very convincing, ironically it works best on those most familiar with the conventions of the genre who trap themselves by focusing in on what they think are plot holes.The group includes Ryan Reynolds, Kristin Booth, and Joris Jarsky; all Canadian and all unknown to me. Booth looked familiar, like either Tyler Layton or Lindy Booth-who played the airhead student secretary on ""Relic Hunter"". The latter was somewhat correct-Kristin is Lindy's older sister. In the case of ""Foolproof"" she was the reason for most of my enjoyment. Reynolds and Jarsky are competent and do all that is required of them but Booth's performance cements everything together. There is no interesting scene or sequence in which she does not have a central part. The DVD is probably the way to go as the deleted scenes actually contain funnier jokes than those that make it into the final cut.

His perforance is inept. Kristen Booth demonstrates even further lack of acting ability. Her part wasn't very demanding, and admittedly she didn't have great dialogue to work with, but it was apparent, especially in the early scenes, that she just didn't have the sassy alpha-femaleness in her to say her lines like she meant them. I rarely notice acting, but both those parts were handled undeniably badly. Ryan Reynolds and the other guy were both decent, Reynolds' professionalism seeming above the amateurish standards set by most aspects of the film. How he wound up doing this b-movie after 4 years in a successful sitcom and Van Wilder is bizarre.The script has a few good ideas and the framework for a decent movie, but there's so much empty space that needed to be filled in. The dramatic conflicts weren't earnt. The parts where characters yelled at each other seemed forced because the characters hadn't spoken to each other enough yet for it to have any impact.Ultimately it just makes no sense that this movie was even made at all when any given episode of most tv action/adventure series' (Fastlane for example) is superior to it in every conceivable way. This isn't a movie that can justify it's existence in the indie/low-budget arena by providing some unique creative edgy voice that the big studios wouldn't dirty their hands with. This is just a b-grade version of a big studio film. It's pretty sad to think of all the wasted energy that went into producing this redundant movie.

""Foolproof"" features three former hacker buddies - two male and one female, of course - who have taken up a most unusual hobby:  they meticulously devise, plan out and rehearse elaborate burglary schemes that they have no intention of ever carrying out.  Even before we have had a chance to buy into that ridiculous premise, the movie goes a step further into narrative idiocy.  For what our intrepid little band of reformed lawbreakers doesn't count on is that one day a diabolical criminal will steal one of their plans, then blackmail the three of them into executing the heist for real.  Thus, what starts off as an intellectually challenging game for bored computer geeks turns into deadly serious business.""Foolproof"" might have been a halfway interesting film had anybody involved with the project put even the slightest conviction or effort into it.  As it is, the script is juvenile, the direction shoddy, the acting stiff and without emotion.

791410,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000127ZC8,trebe,"[2, 3]","Foolproof (2003) is more of a crime fantasy, as three friends who plan and engineer robberies for fun, are forced to engage in criminal acts, to avoid being arrested by the police.  Although the reality factor is low, the quirky offbeat story grabs and holds your interest for the most part, even when matters veer off and take some overdramatic turns.  Set in Canada, the pacing is brisk, and isn't slowed down by any romantic entanglements, as greed and survival are the primary motivation.Kevin (Ryan Reynolds), Samantha (Kristin Booth), and Rob (Joris Jarsky) have taken their college pastime of hacking and solving puzzles to a new level, as for kicks, they research, plan, and then simulate the execution of crimes.  It's a game they call ""foolproof"", and their current project is the theoretical robbery of a jewelry wholesale company.  They have just gotten all the details worked out, when their plans are stolen, and the jewelry business there have been casing, is actually robbed.The partners are contacted by Leo Gillette (David Suchett), who besides running a restaurant on the side, engages in the commission of grand theft.  In possession of the evidence of their involvement in the planning of the crime, Gillette forces the friends to apply their talents to engineer the theft of millions in bearer bonds from a safe located in an office on the upper floor of an office building.Initially the group seems to become tighter, but with Gillette playing him special attention, Rob seems tempted by the dark side.  Kevin appears focused on the task, but Sam challenges Gillette several times, and gets slapped down for her trouble.  The group does come up with an ingenious and elaborate plan, the gradual reveal of which, is the highlight of the film.  Not much that happens seems realistic or particularly credible, but the high tech approach and slick execution, makes for a pretty entertaining watch.  The caper features deception and a number of twists, to try and keep you off balance, as the movie finishes on a dramatic and upbeat note, with the successful completion of the ultimate foolproof plan.The dialog is fairly intelligent, and in general, the cast does a good job with the roles they are given.  The absence of a serious romance between the players, keeps the focus on the mission, and serves to keep the tension elevated.  Kristin Booth is put in a number of positions that feature her physical skills, as her character Sam exhibits the spunk and aggression that her male partners seem to lack.  As Kevin, Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern) tries not to create waves, though he always seems to be scheming.  David Suchett, known for his portrayal of Hercule Poirot, is very familiar with overplaying a role, bringing pretentiousness, conceit, and a sense of menace, to Gillette.With a number of close calls and plot twists to keep the mix bubbling, Foolproof is a slick caper film that attempts to dazzle using technology, and gloss over its short comings with some sleight of hand.  The formula works pretty well, if you don't take things too seriously, as viewers are expected to accept a lot, including some trickery and major fiddling with reality at the film's conclusion.  The movie gets some points for style, and earns an overall rating of 3.5 stars.",4,"slick stylish crime thriller, where fantasy becomes reality...",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,3284,"['Foolproof', '2003', 'more', 'crime', 'fantasy', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'plan', 'engineer', 'robberies', 'fun', 'are', 'forced', 'engage', 'criminal', 'acts', 'avoid', 'being', 'arrested', 'police', 'reality', 'factor', 'low', 'quirky', 'offbeat', 'story', 'grabs', 'interest', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'when', 'matters', 'veer', 'take', 'overdramatic', 'turns', 'Set', 'Canada', 'pacing', 'brisk', ""n't"", 'slowed', 'down', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'greed', 'survival', 'are', 'primary', 'motivation.Kevin', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Samantha', 'Kristin', 'Booth', 'Rob', 'Joris', 'Jarsky', 'have', 'taken', 'college', 'pastime', 'hacking', 'solving', 'puzzles', 'new', 'level', 'kicks', 'research', 'plan', 'then', 'simulate', 'execution', 'crimes', 'game', 'call', 'foolproof', 'current', 'project', 'theoretical', 'robbery', 'jewelry', 'wholesale', 'company', 'have', 'just', 'gotten', 'details', 'worked', 'out', 'when', 'plans', 'are', 'stolen', 'jewelry', 'business', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'casing', 'actually', 'robbed.The', 'partners', 'are', 'contacted', 'Leo', 'Gillette', 'David', 'Suchett', 'who', 'running', 'restaurant', 'side', 'commission', 'grand', 'theft', 'possession', 'evidence', 'involvement', 'planning', 'crime', 'Gillette', 'friends', 'apply', 'talents', 'engineer', 'theft', 'millions', 'bearer', 'bonds', 'safe', 'located', 'office', 'upper', 'floor', 'office', 'building.Initially', 'group', 'become', 'tighter', 'Gillette', 'playing', 'special', 'attention', 'Rob', 'tempted', 'dark', 'side', 'Kevin', 'focused', 'task', 'Sam', 'Gillette', 'several', 'times', 'slapped', 'down', 'trouble', 'group', 'come', 'up', 'ingenious', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'gradual', 'reveal', 'highlight', 'film', 'Not', 'much', 'realistic', 'particularly', 'credible', 'high', 'tech', 'approach', 'slick', 'execution', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'caper', 'deception', 'number', 'twists', 'try', 'keep', 'off', 'balance', 'movie', 'finishes', 'dramatic', 'upbeat', 'note', 'successful', 'completion', 'ultimate', 'foolproof', 'plan.The', 'dialog', 'fairly', 'intelligent', 'general', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'roles', 'are', 'given', 'absence', 'serious', 'romance', 'players', 'focus', 'mission', 'keep', 'tension', 'elevated', 'Kristin', 'Booth', 'put', 'number', 'positions', 'feature', 'physical', 'skills', 'character', 'Sam', 'spunk', 'aggression', 'male', 'partners', 'seem', 'lack', 'Kevin', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'not', 'create', 'waves', 'always', 'be', 'scheming', 'David', 'Suchett', 'known', 'portrayal', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'very', 'familiar', 'overplaying', 'role', 'bringing', 'pretentiousness', 'conceit', 'sense', 'menace', 'Gillette.With', 'number', 'close', 'calls', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'mix', 'bubbling', 'Foolproof', 'slick', 'caper', 'film', 'dazzle', 'using', 'technology', 'gloss', 'short', 'comings', 'sleight', 'hand', 'formula', 'pretty', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'things', 'too', 'seriously', 'viewers', 'are', 'expected', 'accept', 'lot', 'including', 'trickery', 'major', 'fiddling', 'reality', 'film', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'points', 'style', 'overall', 'rating', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

791413,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000127ZC8,Tsuyoshi,"[14, 18]","Kevin (Ryan Reynolds), Sam (Kristin Booth), and Rob (Joris Jarsky) are good friends, but what is special about them is that they are planning a perfect heist - only on paper. They make and improve their plans, even do researches, but have no intention of doing it for real. Their secret joy turns into a bad dream when a real master criminal named Gillette (David Suchet) steals and puts into practice their elaborate plans. Moreover, Gillette demands that the next heist must be done by Kevin and his friends.`Foolproof' unashamedly takes up familiar elements that you have seen in the past films about heist, but it still does the tricks fairly well. Though there is nothing new about the way it entertains us, it is entertaining, and there is a neat conclusion after a good twist and two. Whatever you might find in it, at least you will admit it is slick.Still, for all these merits, the film is disappointing for the following two reasons. As I said before, the film uses the conventions of the genre, and I am not against that use, but if you show a villain or a criminal in this kind of film, of which main purpose is to entertain us, you just need a better baddie than this one. David Suchet's Gillette is a boring presence, not coldly threatening nor devilishly charming enough. These `bad' guys must keep cool and collected even with a gun pointed at his head for he is a master criminal, but Gillette is visibly scared when it happens. If the three friends are smart enough (and they are), it is truly easy to outwit the insipid flatly-written baddie. Unfortunately, however, the three young reluctant thieves are not interesting either, for all its star Ryan Reynolds' competent acting.The other disappointment is that the heist itself is a mediocre one. No real race against the clock, no real sense of impending danger, and no detailed geographical knowledge about the target of the thieves. In other words, we are not allowed to realize how difficult to get into the building and steal the thing from there. They use apparently high-tech equipment, but what they do looks like guess work with luck. They should be mapping out the plans minutely before beginning the heist, but in `Foolproof' they simply forgot to do it, or if they had done, they did it somewhere off-screen.`Foolproof' is a Canadian film (co-produced by Canadian director Atom Egoyan) with very modest budget. But the real problem about the film is neither the low-budget, nor its fast pace. It is that the film goes fast without giving much to us, giving something other than usual props like guns, elevator shaft, bonds, telescopes, etc. Even the annoying robot alarming 'Error, Error' looks familiar.",3,(2.5 STARS) Entertaining But Breaks No New Ground: Canadian Heist Film Starring Ryan Reynolds,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,2686,"['Kevin', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Sam', 'Kristin', 'Booth', 'Rob', 'Joris', 'Jarsky', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'what', 'special', 'are', 'planning', 'perfect', 'heist', 'only', 'paper', 'make', 'improve', 'plans', 'even', 'do', 'researches', 'have', 'intention', 'doing', 'real', 'secret', 'joy', 'bad', 'dream', 'when', 'real', 'master', 'criminal', 'named', 'Gillette', 'David', 'Suchet', 'steals', 'practice', 'elaborate', 'plans', 'Moreover', 'Gillette', 'next', 'heist', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Kevin', 'friends.', 'Foolproof', 'unashamedly', 'up', 'familiar', 'elements', 'have', 'seen', 'past', 'films', 'heist', 'still', 'tricks', 'fairly', 'well', 'nothing', 'new', 'way', 'entertaining', 'neat', 'conclusion', 'good', 'twist', 'two', 'might', 'find', 'least', 'will', 'admit', 'slick.Still', 'merits', 'film', 'disappointing', 'following', 'two', 'reasons', 'said', 'film', 'conventions', 'genre', 'am', 'not', 'use', 'show', 'villain', 'criminal', 'kind', 'film', 'main', 'purpose', 'entertain', 'just', 'need', 'better', 'baddie', 'one', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Gillette', 'boring', 'presence', 'not', 'coldly', 'threatening', 'devilishly', 'charming', 'enough', 'bad', 'guys', 'must', 'keep', 'cool', 'collected', 'even', 'gun', 'pointed', 'head', 'master', 'criminal', 'Gillette', 'visibly', 'scared', 'when', 'three', 'friends', 'are', 'smart', 'enough', 'are', 'truly', 'easy', 'outwit', 'insipid', 'flatly-written', 'baddie', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'three', 'young', 'reluctant', 'thieves', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'star', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'competent', 'other', 'disappointment', 'heist', 'mediocre', 'one', 'real', 'race', 'clock', 'real', 'sense', 'impending', 'danger', 'detailed', 'geographical', 'knowledge', 'target', 'thieves', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'realize', 'how', 'difficult', 'get', 'building', 'steal', 'thing', 'there', 'use', 'apparently', 'high-tech', 'equipment', 'what', 'do', 'looks', 'like', 'guess', 'work', 'luck', 'should', 'be', 'mapping', 'plans', 'minutely', 'beginning', 'heist', 'Foolproof', 'simply', 'forgot', 'do', 'had', 'done', 'did', 'somewhere', 'off-screen.', 'Foolproof', 'Canadian', 'film', 'co-produced', 'Canadian', 'director', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'very', 'modest', 'budget', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'low-budget', 'fast', 'pace', 'film', 'fast', 'giving', 'much', 'giving', 'something', 'other', 'usual', 'props', 'guns', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'bonds', 'telescopes', 'etc', 'Even', 'annoying', 'robot', 'alarming', ""'Error"", 'Error', 'looks', 'familiar']",N/A
