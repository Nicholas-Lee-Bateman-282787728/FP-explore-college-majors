1084399,A1N16EU00XJWRD,B000RZEBXU,Anibal Madeira,"[0, 0]","With the participation of the great and almost omnipresent egyptologist Zahi Hawass, this documentary tries to find out what happened to the lost dynasty of Amarna and if one of the mummies on KV - 35 is really the legendary queen Nefertiti, wife of Akhenaton, like several experts believe.Well paced, sometimes quite dramatic, this investigation lead to important conclusions that shed some light on this mysterious dinasty.Convincingly, this investigation shows that those mummies shouldn't be Nefertiti; probably they're Kia (Akhenaton consort) who was possibly murdered or had a terrible accident (extremely visible on the cadaver), and the elderly woman was probably Ti&eacute; (Akenaton's mother). Naturally you will have to watch the documentary to follow the clues and conclusions.Of great importance is the identification of KV - 55 mummy as Akhenaton. Several similar characteristics with Pharaoh Tut identifies Akhenaton as probably his father (with the mother being Kia).Also of interest is the disapearance of Nefertiti when Ti&eacute; goes to Amarna. There are many mysteries, plots and intrigues associated with this dynasty of Amarna; we need more investigations like the one documented in this DVD to find at last this lost piece of Egyptian History...to find the lost dynasty.",4,Looking for answers,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,1294,"['participation', 'great', 'almost', 'omnipresent', 'egyptologist', 'Zahi', 'Hawass', 'documentary', 'tries', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'lost', 'dynasty', 'Amarna', 'one', 'mummies', 'KV', '35', 'really', 'legendary', 'queen', 'Nefertiti', 'wife', 'Akhenaton', 'several', 'experts', 'believe.Well', 'paced', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'investigation', 'lead', 'important', 'conclusions', 'shed', 'light', 'mysterious', 'dinasty.Convincingly', 'investigation', 'mummies', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'Nefertiti', 'probably', ""'re"", 'Kia', 'Akhenaton', 'consort', 'who', 'was', 'possibly', 'murdered', 'had', 'terrible', 'accident', 'extremely', 'visible', 'cadaver', 'elderly', 'woman', 'was', 'probably', 'Ti', 'eacute', 'Akenaton', 'mother', 'Naturally', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'documentary', 'follow', 'clues', 'conclusions.Of', 'great', 'importance', 'identification', 'KV', '55', 'mummy', 'Akhenaton', 'Several', 'similar', 'characteristics', 'Pharaoh', 'Tut', 'Akhenaton', 'probably', 'father', 'mother', 'being', 'Kia', '.Also', 'interest', 'disapearance', 'Nefertiti', 'when', 'Ti', 'eacute', 'Amarna', 'are', 'many', 'mysteries', 'plots', 'intrigues', 'associated', 'dynasty', 'Amarna', 'need', 'more', 'investigations', 'one', 'documented', 'DVD', 'find', 'last', 'lost', 'piece', 'Egyptian', 'History', 'find', 'lost', 'dynasty']",N/A

1084401,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000RZEBXU,Jeffery Mingo,"[2, 12]","Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" was too whimsical and sugary.  This documentary is about a queen, but it's really about corpses.  Though they have reenactments of the Amarna royalty, there's not talk about life in an Egyptian court.  It's all about two skeletons and whether it can be determined who they are.  This is less about a beautiful, African queen and more about forensic science.Alfre Woodard narrates.  Good for her!  Maybe she can be the female Morgan Freeman, another actor who has won acclaim as a narrator.  Almost every documentary on Ancient Egypt has Dr. Zahawi, an Egyptian Egyptologist with a marked chin dimple, in it.  Here, he is very dramatic.  I wonder if he thought he had to act since the country where Hollywood is located was producing the work.  His appearances are almost comical.The conclusion is a bit anti-climactic.  Many modern women, and female impersonators, love wearing jewelry and clothes with Nefertiti's image on it.  I don't think they'd get much out of this documentary as it doesn't really explore her day to day life.
