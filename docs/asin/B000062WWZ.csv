Steve Martin plays a dentist who ends up embroiled in sex, drugs and bloody murder when he makes the mistake of prescribing a lethal dose of stolen narcotics to one of his patients; he quickly becomes a murder suspect. Martin's fans may have difficulty accepting NOVOCAINE. It is a far cry from the likes of THE JERK and PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES. What is difficult for ANY viewer to accept is the possibility of Martin and Elias Koteas being brothers! On the plus side, there is good support from Laura Dern and Helena Bonham-Carter as the victim's sister, but good acting rarely makes a slovenly script worth your time. Viewers will wish they were actually under the influence of novocaine to be able to sit through this movie. The most memorable scene has Martin perfoming oral surgery on himself and a corpse. Eeew!!

691647,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000062WWZ,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 1]","Novocaine is the story of Steve Martin playing a dentist who digs himself into a hole of drugs, deceit, and murder, precipitated by a pretty drug dealer (Helena Bonham Carter) who visits his office and talk him into writing her a prescription for demerol. Told from the dentist's point of view, we know he didn't steal the drugs or commit the murder, but suspicion shifts back and forth amongst the other 4 main characters: the druggie, her brother (Caan), the dentist's hygenist/fiance (Dern), and his brother (Koteas).  What's great about the movie is that there is no cheating - the eventual outcome is logical, and clues are placed along the way that are consistent with the eventual solution to the mystery.  On hindsight, the characters moved towards their fates with a Greek inevitability, but you can't predict the results beforehand.  Even though the ultimate solution involves a course of action that dedicated movie/TV viewers have seen before, it's the journey to that inevitable point that interests us.The performances are good.  The screenplay doesn't cheat.  The direction is sure, at least in the second half.  Unfortunately, it took me a long time to get into the film - perhaps it's because it's not quite what you expect of a Steve Martin movie.  The first half is violent and eerie, the second half loosens up and the natural charisma of Carter and Martin starts to show through.  It is at that point that you start to care about the characters, which is vital in being drawn into a suspense thriller.  Similarly, Martin's natural comedic niche - the smart man who is bewildered by his inability to deal with a situation - is not obvious in the first half of the film, making the direction seem heavy-handed and the suspense seem too thick.This DVD edition has some short features and a few cut scenes.  The video and sound are fine, but no better than a VHS tape.  The director's commentary and cut scenes are the highlights, as is usually the case for DVD extras.

691651,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B000062WWZ,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[3, 4]","There is a shot way too early in the movie that reveals who the chief villian in this movie is.  My nine-year old daughter caught it, and asked me afterwards why they gave this away so early in the movie.  Thus is my major problem with a movie I was rooting (no pun intended, see below) for from the beginning, but ended as a disappointment.This was a noble attempt to create an intelligent thriller about a dentist (thus the ""root"" pun) whose life is turned upside down because of a pretty face.  This has happened many times before, both in the movies, and in real life, and, as a male, I will grudgingly admit it does have credibility.The man in this movie is a dentist played by Steve Martin, who seems to have it all together.  He has a successful practice, and Laura Dern is his fiance.  Of course when a movie hits you over the head with information like this, you know things are going to change fast.This change occurs when the pretty face (Helena Bonham Carter) appears in his office, and nothing is ever again the same.  She first cons Martin and a pharmacist out of some narcotics, then appears again and seduces him in his own dentist chair.  The fact that she does this so easily shows that maybe he wasn't as happy as he first declares in the movie.  Or maybe it has something to do with the movie's funniest line.  When Martin asks her if she does this all the time with doctors and dentists, she replies just dentists because they're dumber, no offense.So far, so good, and the situation gets even stickier when Martin discovers the next day that his whole stash of narcotics is missing, and one vial was found at the scene of a tragic accident.  This leads to an encounter with the brother of Carter's played violently by Scott Caan, a definite chip off his old man's block.  While the movie has several ""bad guys"" of varying degrees, it is here that we get the shot of who the real ""whodunnit"" person is.  That's it.  Strike three.  Movie over.So now we have to sit and wait for Martin to catch up with us, and the movie continues while pretending it didn't reveal this to us.  While watching, I'm reminded of the far superior ""Something Wild"", where Jeff Daniels goes on a far more exciting roller coaster with Melanie Griffith.  This movie should have gotten some tips from that one.While there are some humorous parts, the timing is sometimes bad.  While being interviewed at his home, the plot decides to introduce Kevin Bacon as an actor researching a cop role.  I imagine this was supposed to be funny, but it just didn't work at this time.  We find out later that the character was introduced here to be a plot device later, but that scene is also clumsy and improbable.And that's the problem.  The movie wants to give us some laughs as well as the tension.  It does the tension fairly well, but the comedy doesn't work enough.  Steve Martin doesn't need to revert back to a ""Wild and Crazy Guy"", but if he's going to go for laughs, he should play less staid characters than he's played lately or learn to become a better straight man while others get the laughs.So pick up ""Something Wild"" to see this subject treated better, and the orginal ""Lethal Weapon"" to see crime and comedy work well.One more note.  While Steve Martin isn't THAT old, and Dern and Carter aren't THAT young anymore, and Martin does keep fit, and we're not going into Woody Allen territory here, we still have the ""older male actor gets younger women"" syndrome yet again.

However, everything derailed early on and became one head-scratcher after another.  The biggest failure is that the character motivations don't make any sense, and Martin's character, supposedly a sharp dentist, makes asisine judgements one after the other. The writing is poor, and Martin's narrations sound scripted and hackneyed.  The plot moves along fast, but in a mechanical and unbelievable way, with several placed concidences and bewildering logic.  Spoiler warning: It becomes obvious far too early that his fiancee is in on it, as her reactions to his problems are laughable.  The ending coup d'etat is not only sickening, but also moronic, as in the fairy tale ending between two mismatched people. This movie has more holes than swiss cheese, and lacks common sense and feeling as it races blindly ahead.  Dern and Carter had little chance for a fine performance as the psychology underlying their characters was ill-defined and basically nonsensical.  Steve was handcuffed by the script as well, but even so gave afar less nuanced and steady performance as his fine dramaticwork in the excellent Spanish Prisoner.

I give it four stars because it earns its weight in laughs and entertaining scenes.  The Amazon review misleads.  It's true, it doesn't completely 'find its footing', and by all means it's not a ""perfect"" film or comedy - but for sheer easy going fun, with a black humour edge, you could do a whole lot worse than this film.  I didn't regret watching it.  It certainly ends with a bit of a stretch that's a little too convenient (but of course the whole movie is highly implausable!).  Still, I found that in this 95 minute film, the interest level is pretty high for at least 75 of those minutes.

Steve Martin plays Dr. Frank Sangster, a successful dentist content with his practice and the love of his oral hygienist, Jean (Laura Dern). Well, maybe he's just a little bored. One day, Frank gains a new patient, the bewitching Susan (Helena Bonham Carter). During an after hours appointment, her smoldering question, ""Have you done it in The Chair"", causes Doc to use a drill of another sort. Unfortunately, as many men can ruefully corroborate, the failure to keep it zipped under stress has consequences. In Frank's case, they include suspicion of drug dealing and arrest for murder. And what were his teeth marks doing all over the corpse?NOVOCAINE is somewhat reminiscent of the 1985 film noir AFTER HOURS. In both, the hero finds his life going down the toilet due to bizarre circumstances beyond his control.  However, in the former, the plot is darker and the humor has a harder edge. Indeed, NOVOCAINE is often more drama than comedy. Having made his reputation as a comedian, Steve Martin is remarkably deadpan serious in his role as the foil for the, um, more interesting characters that have forced their way into Sangster's life. Scott Caan, regrettably on screen all too briefly, is chillingly menacing as Susan's psycho brother, Duane. Kevin Bacon is excellent as the actor spending time with the police department to absorb local color for an upcoming gig. Carter has the meatiest role as the strung-out and abused, but basically good-hearted, Susan. And Laura Dern, always a Babe worth an ogle, is effective as Frank's understanding girlfriend. Maybe too understanding, come to think of it.Sangster's solution to his growing list of problems is this quirky film's weirdest touch.

First of all the story/plot itself is only mildly interesting: a dentist, Frank Sangster (Steve Martin)is visited by a new patient, Susan Ivey (Helena Bonham Carter)who's obviously more interested in a Demerol perscription than in any dental work...and she'll do/does anything to get it.  This encounter opens the gates to a series of scenes involving: murder, suicide, drugs, physical abuse, robbery and incest to name a few.  The problem is that the tone of this film is so erratic and diffuse that it cannot support this barrage of situations.  It's like trying to build a house on a poor foundation...it's bound to topple.  And of course the poor foundation here is the screenplay written by the director, David Atkins.  Plot complications come out of nowhere and and this means that continuity is lost after only 30 minutes into this film.To compound the situation, there is no sexual chemistry at all between Steve Martin and Helena Bonham Carter, who seems to have left her buck teeth in place from &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and brought along her hair-don't and wardrobe from the &quot;Fight Club.&quot; Bonham Carter has been absolutely luminous in such movies as &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; and especially &quot;Wings of the Dove.&quot;  Ditto for Steve Martin especially in &quot;LA Story.&quot; But even their combined charisma cannot save this sinking ship.On the positive side, Laura Dern does a terrific job as Jean Noble, a dental hygenist and all around loony.

Carter is somewhat miscast, but Laura Dern as the dental assistant/fiancee to Martin's character all too perfect and perky does a role here.The opening montage showing the skeletal works of a person chewing are unique and when the narrator mentions decay and how it destroys from the inside out building up insidiously, it will leave you running for dental floss and a toothbrush.  The director's narrative that goes along with this DVD reveals some unique facts.  Take for instance, the fact that the director's father and brother were both dentists.  Teeth run in the family.  It lends some realism to the storyline centering on a dentists supposedly gone bad.Just when you think you are on to this story, it takes twists and turns that, try as you might, take you blind-sided and pleasantly surprised.  There are a few moments the movie misses when sticky-sweet romance enters the equation, but for the most part the movie is right on the mark.

691670,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000062WWZ,Reviewer,"[3, 6]","Rarely does the title of a film say as much about it as this one does; because by the time you get to the end, there's a good chance you're going to feel quite numb, as if you've been given a body-size shot of novocaine.  And it's not because there's so much wrong with this film-- it's just that there's not too much right about it; it's seemingly beyond the help of even it's high profile cast, and that's even if they were, indeed, trying to help in the first place.  Unfortunately, the evidence-- with regards to one of the stars of the project, at any rate-- inexplicably points to the contrary, and it leaves ""Novocaine,"" written and directed by David Atkins, somewhere out on a limb; a precarious place to be, considering that the tree itself was not strong enough to take root in the first place.  Simply put, this one's on such shaky ground that you'll be convinced that there has to be a fault line running along beneath it somewhere, and while you're trying to figure out where, you just might miss the point of the whole thing, which is something along the lines of ""If You Play With Fire You'll Get Burned.""  Or better yet, pick your own platitude and fill in the blank.  Either way, there's not going to be any getting around the numb thing.  Just accept it, and try to move on.Frank Sangster (Steve Martin) is a dentist with a successful practice, a beautiful finance, Jean (Laura Dern), and a future that promises more of the same.  Until one day out of the blue, Susan (Helena Bonham Carter), a new patient, shows up at his office with a toothache.  And before it's over, he gives her a root canal, and she gives him the ""works,"" which includes wheedling a prescription of Demerol out of him.  Can it be she has a drug problem?  Can Frank smell scam?  Apparently not, because the next day the entire drug supply in his office is missing, and so is Susan.  She does leave one of her more personal items behind in the office, however, and when Jean gets wind of it, Frank-- to paraphrase a famous line-- has some `splaining to do.  And in veritably a nanosecond, the life of one Frank Sangster is turned upside down, and that old gravity, reality, begins it's pull on him; and there's only one way it can possibly take him:  Suffice to say, it isn't up.Bringing a feature film to the screen is no easy task, and it must be especially challenging to make the attempt while wearing two hats (writer and director).  And from all appearances, this is where Atkins gets into trouble, as the problems with this film (and there are many) begin with the screenplay.  Writer Atkins simply doesn't give director Atkins much to work with, and it just may be that he was too close to his own material, which prevented him from seeing it objectively.  And that objective viewpoint is something this film needed.  Badly.  With the exception of a pivotal element of the climax, there is nothing original about the story at all, and that single element is too ludicrous to be effective, or believable.  And therein lies the basic problem with the film:  Even if you manage to suspend disbelief while watching it, you would still need an imagination with a Gumby-like flexibility before any of it would seem convincing or the least bit probable.  Given a best case scenario, the story just isn't plausible at all.  The dialogue is poorly scripted (For instance, as it unfolds, no less than three characters ask Frank, ""Can I ask you a personal question?"" which is about two times too many to be credible), the execution of the material lacks the fine-tuning it needs and, inexplicably, the actors fail to bring any definition at all to their characters (they needed help, ""direction,"" and obviously Atkins-- for whatever reason-- was unable to supply it).  Filmmaking is inherently a collaborative enterprise, and when a project lacks that cohesive unity, it invariably has a negative impact on the final product.  And it certainly does here.Steve Martin turns in what is arguably the most convincing performance of the film, but it is far from his best work.  His portrayal of Frank lacks the nuance he usually brings to the characters he creates, and the result is a fairly nondescript protagonist.  And, though Frank comes across as ""real"" overall, Martin fails to really get into his skin or to explore the motivations that drive Frank on to doing what he does; and because of all that precedes it, as well as the way in which it is presented, what would have been merely a ridiculous ending becomes absolutely ludicrous.  Martin has a good go at it, but in the end he barely manages to keep his Frank afloat, and under closer scrutiny, the credibility slowly begins to unravel.Helena Bonham Carter, meanwhile, gives a performance that doesn't hold up to a casual glance, let alone close scrutiny, and it's one of the biggest surprises of the film.  The usually reliable Carter-- who is a terrific, versatile actor-- winds up with possibly the most unrealistic character she's ever created.  For this film to work, the audience must believe that Susan is an addict; But there is nothing in Carter's portrayal to confirm, or even indicate, that this is the case.  And here, more than anywhere else, is where the credibility of the entire film dissolves, negating any of the more positive aspects in the balance.  It's a one-dimensional, one note character, and it takes it's toll on the whole picture.Laura Dern has also done better work-- though, as Jean, she looks good, and certainly brings a lot of energy to the film.  A decent effort, but it's not enough to save ""Novocaine,""  and-- like the audience-- she gets little return on the investment of her time here.",2,Will the REAL Helena Bonham Carter Please Stand

If, like me, you feel you have to pop a few Valiums before you can even consider an exam, pause. The opening credits depict an x-rayed skull that is laughing, chewing, and swallowing and other everyday functions. It should be interesting, somewhat funny and it least clever.  I broke out in a sweat.Steve Martin is a kindly, but obsessed with his profession type who declares and demonstrates his ""perfect"" world: a flawless dental practice that runs like a well-oiled machine.  Much of this perfection is due to his head assistant/fianc&eacute;e expertly played by Laura Dern.  They look to be the perfect match.  Everything about her is perfectly organized, and she is undoubtedly the perfect fianc&eacute;e.  The worm in the apple in the form of Helen Bonham-Carter comes in with a raging toothache and a taste for drugs.  Steve is instantly smitten as only he can be.  Quickly lies, deceit, suspicion and murder follow.The cast is excellent.  Bonham-Carter carries off her waif as a grunge role with charm.  Playing her psychotic hoodlum brother, Scott Caan has a menacing, jaunty swaggering charm worthy of his dad, James. The pace is good, even brisk.  However, as a comedy noir, there were a few too many episodes that were painful rather than funny (usually connected with teeth.)  Only Laura Dern was able to carry the audience in whatever direction she took.  Steve Martin seemed more of a pitiable object; you laugh but you feel guilty.Good, but not memorable.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer",3,How Do You Feel About Dentistry?,1042416000,"01 13, 2003",2003,1583,"['important', 'question', 'ask', 'settling', 'down', 'movie', 'feel', 'have', 'pop', 'few', 'Valiums', 'can', 'even', 'consider', 'exam', 'pause', 'opening', 'credits', 'depict', 'x-rayed', 'skull', 'laughing', 'chewing', 'swallowing', 'other', 'everyday', 'functions', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'least', 'clever', 'broke', 'out', 'sweat.Steve', 'Martin', 'kindly', 'obsessed', 'profession', 'type', 'who', 'perfect', 'world', 'flawless', 'dental', 'practice', 'well-oiled', 'machine', 'Much', 'perfection', 'due', 'head', 'assistant/fianc', 'eacute', 'expertly', 'played', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'look', 'be', 'perfect', 'match', 'Everything', 'perfectly', 'organized', 'undoubtedly', 'perfect', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'worm', 'apple', 'form', 'Helen', 'Bonham-Carter', 'raging', 'toothache', 'taste', 'drugs', 'Steve', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'only', 'can', 'be', 'Quickly', 'deceit', 'suspicion', 'murder', 'follow.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Bonham-Carter', 'waif', 'grunge', 'role', 'charm', 'Playing', 'psychotic', 'hoodlum', 'brother', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'menacing', 'jaunty', 'swaggering', 'charm', 'worthy', 'dad', 'James', 'pace', 'good', 'even', 'brisk', 'However', 'comedy', 'noir', 'were', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'were', 'painful', 'rather', 'funny', 'usually', 'connected', 'teeth', 'Only', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'was', 'able', 'carry', 'audience', 'direction', 'took', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'seemed', 'more', 'pitiable', 'object', 'laugh', 'feel', 'guilty.Good', 'not', 'memorable.-sweetmolly-Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A
691676,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B000062WWZ,Timothy Michael Resh,"[2, 4]","This film is one of those cross-genre movies that must drive marketing people nuts.  Part murder mystery, part erotic suspense thriller, part black comedy, the marketing people took one look at this, saw Steve Martin, and called it comedic.  Really, it's more ironic than comedic.  The situations in which people find themselves, from Laura Dern's OCD fiancee to Steve Martin's repressed dentist caught up in a spiraling web of deceit are definitely not funny in the traditional sense, and I am sure that is what put many people off about the film.Despite the unsavory elements of the story and only average acting from otherwise good actors, the story holds the audience's interest, subtlely foreshadowing the climax, which unfortunately &quot;pays off&quot; all too quickly after the amount of work that goes into setting it up.This, plus the aforementioned average acting and dark storyline are the primary reasons that this movie is usually found in the bargain bin.  Still, Helena Bonham Carter is definitely worth watching as a drug addict, abused by her incestuous brother.  Some of the character's dress and actions are vaguely reminiscent of her portrayal of Marla Singer in Fight Club, and she remains sufficiently tortured throughout the film to add a slightly deeper layer to the film.Not for the squeamish (or dentist averse), the film has an ironic but &quot;happy&quot; ending that leaves the viewer a bit unsettled, mainly because it ends a little too cleanly.

691678,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000062WWZ,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","Frank is a successful dentist, with a beautiful fiance Jean.  But when Frank is played by Steve Martin, Frank is going to have some trouble, just as he did in ""Little Shop of Horrors.""  But from the beginning you know that ""Novocaine"" is not a usual film, if you are looking at the craziest opening credits, where X-rayed skulls are talking to each other, and eating and drinking.And this unlucky Frank meets a sexy patient Helena Bonahm Carter -- who asks him, ""will you do it in chair?"" -- and later, you would realize she is not an usual patient when she shows up at the dentist's office very late at night.  Frank is inevitably drawn to her, cheating his fiance Laura Dean, but who can blame him?  And quite naturally, and miserably, he has to pay the price with the uninvited drug-related investigation, and then perhaps, something more.Director David Atkins once wrote the script of Johnny Depp's ""Arizona Dream,"" of which off-beat, original atmosphere I still don't know what to do with.  And in ""Novocaine"" too, his first-time director attempt, the style is the same.  Part thriller, part comedy, and part romance, the film goes with a steady speed, but the point looks often unsure even though the twists and turns of the story is intriguing.  In short, the film doesn't bite, or don't know where to bite.But one thing is there which I can recommend for sure, and that's Helena Bonahm Carter.  She succeeds in surprising us with the sexiest performance she ever did, and as a ""woman of fate"" she cuts an extraordinarily convincing figure, spilling over the charm she had never shown in ""Planet of the Apes.""  If you're her fan, this film is not to be missed.So, film company Artizan made another interesting film, or noir comedy so to speak, of Steve Martin, whose career we find very hard to evaluate since the 1990s.  But whether or not you like ""Bowfinger,"" I think he can surprise us with unexpectedly good acting (such as that of ""Spanish Prisoner"" for instance), and in fact, Steve Martin in ""Novocaine"" is good as before.  But truely amusing is Ms. Carter's coquetish character, who just can't help herself, and ""Hard Way""-like cameo appearance of Kevin Becon who unwittingly torments guilt-ridden Martin.",3,"Martin's Dentist Noir!?
