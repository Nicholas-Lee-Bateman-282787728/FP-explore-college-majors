1026768,A3GYVMUS7SSDFW,B000JJ5F8E,Kyle Tolle,"[49, 50]","In Los Angeles, California on November 4th, 1970, a young girl at 13 years old is rescued from her home by social workers.  What they found was that she was isolated for a decade in a locked room and tied to a potty chair.  She had virtually no human contact and no tactile interaction of any benefit and this helped to deprive her of any semblance of a normal life.  In effect, she was underdeveloped, unable to communicate, she could barely walk and she exhibited many unusual behaviors.  Due in part to a dysfunctional set of parents, it was difficult to get a proper history of all the horrible neglect that occurred here.Eventually named `Genie' by the doctors and experts that worked with her at a children's hospital, so began a time of medical examination and analysis that lasted from about 1970 to 1975.  During this time, Genie was, for lack of a better word, juggled between many people and environments in an effort to rehabilitate and heal her.  At the end of this time period when these efforts were discontinued, Genie was shuffled between various foster homes which proved to be very detrimental in part because she was subjected to more abuse, punishment, and harassment in these different locations.Because of additional difficulties caused by foster care, Genie was again returned to the children's hospital for further treatment.  To compound an already fragile situation, Genie's mother filed a lawsuit against the many experts and the hospital that worked with her citing `excessive and outrageous testing'.  This coming from an irresponsible and unconscionable parent that was, in part, responsible for this entire ordeal from the beginning.  The suit was eventually settled out of court and Genie is currently a resident in a care home in California to this day.`Secret of the Wild Child', although not very long, seems to do a credible job in detailing the known facts and events that played a significant impact in Genie's life after her rescue.  There is a decent mix of interviews from various experts and a good portion of video footage showing Genie's therapy and rehabilitation and it makes for a worthwhile production in my opinion.",4,A simply amazing story and one that tugs at the heart strings,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,2165,"['Los', 'Angeles', 'California', 'November', '4th', '1970', 'young', 'girl', '13', 'years', 'old', 'rescued', 'home', 'social', 'workers', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'was', 'isolated', 'decade', 'locked', 'room', 'tied', 'potty', 'chair', 'had', 'virtually', 'human', 'contact', 'tactile', 'interaction', 'benefit', 'helped', 'deprive', 'semblance', 'normal', 'life', 'effect', 'was', 'underdeveloped', 'unable', 'communicate', 'could', 'barely', 'walk', 'exhibited', 'many', 'unusual', 'behaviors', 'Due', 'part', 'dysfunctional', 'set', 'parents', 'was', 'difficult', 'get', 'proper', 'history', 'horrible', 'neglect', 'occurred', 'here.Eventually', 'named', 'Genie', 'doctors', 'experts', 'worked', 'children', 'hospital', 'so', 'began', 'time', 'medical', 'examination', 'analysis', 'lasted', '1970', '1975', 'time', 'Genie', 'was', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'juggled', 'many', 'people', 'environments', 'effort', 'rehabilitate', 'heal', 'end', 'time', 'period', 'when', 'efforts', 'were', 'discontinued', 'Genie', 'was', 'shuffled', 'various', 'foster', 'homes', 'proved', 'be', 'very', 'detrimental', 'part', 'was', 'subjected', 'more', 'abuse', 'punishment', 'harassment', 'different', 'locations.Because', 'additional', 'difficulties', 'caused', 'foster', 'care', 'Genie', 'was', 'again', 'returned', 'children', 'hospital', 'further', 'treatment', 'compound', 'already', 'fragile', 'situation', 'Genie', 'mother', 'filed', 'lawsuit', 'many', 'experts', 'hospital', 'worked', 'citing', 'excessive', 'outrageous', 'testing', 'coming', 'irresponsible', 'unconscionable', 'parent', 'was', 'part', 'responsible', 'entire', 'ordeal', 'beginning', 'suit', 'was', 'eventually', 'settled', 'court', 'Genie', 'currently', 'resident', 'care', 'home', 'California', 'day.', 'Secret', 'Wild', 'Child', 'not', 'very', 'long', 'do', 'credible', 'job', 'detailing', 'known', 'facts', 'events', 'played', 'significant', 'impact', 'Genie', 'life', 'rescue', 'decent', 'mix', 'interviews', 'various', 'experts', 'good', 'portion', 'video', 'footage', 'showing', 'Genie', 'therapy', 'rehabilitation', 'worthwhile', 'production', 'opinion']",NOVA: Secret of the Wild Child
1026769,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000JJ5F8E,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","This episode of Nova fascinated me and I think it will captivate most viewers. The story is of a real case; a young girl is rescued by social workers when she is 13; she has been brutally kept in solitary confinement by her father since she was 2 years old when he found out she may have been slightly developmentally disabled. The story tugged at my heartstrings and moved me deeply. Although the film is scarcely one hour long, Nova packs quite a bit into it and thus the story never gets boring nor is there anything to be edited out of this film. I also like how they mix archival footage of ""Genie,"" with more recent interviews and the narration.The film begins with the discovery of a girl who is called ""Genie"" to protect her identity. Unfortunately, not much more about this poor girl gets protected. She had been imprisoned for over a decade by her viciously abusive father in a small back room of her parents' home in California, chained to a potty chair with no real human interaction. Apparently when her father would give her what little she had to eat he would actually bark or growl at her instead of using words! Worse yet, she was beaten for vocalizing or trying to say anything; she learned early on not to open her mouth for fear of being beaten. In addition, ""Genie"" had an odd way of walking that they described as a ""bunny hop"" type of walk most likely because of her inability to learn to walk normally when she was much younger. We'll never know the full extent of what the poor girl endured because her father killed himself just days after she was discovered and her mother was nearly blind and quite emotionally unstable.And all of that got the ball rolling. ""Genie"" was taken to Children's Hospital where all of the staff wanted to help her; yet I think they were so unprepared for her case that they didn't truly think through the best way to handle her. For example, some scientists also functioned as therapeutic surrogate parents and bonded with her; this was not a good idea. Researchers and scientists, sensing an opportunity to make their mark in scientific history, wanted to experiment on ""Genie"" to determine a number of things including whether she could learn language when she was already 13 or 14 and even the best of them cruelly abandoned her when federal funding to study and heal her dried up.I could tell you so much more but I don't want to ruin it for you with spoilers. Suffice it to say that you'll be amazed by the true story of ""Genie.""Overall, ""The Secret of the Wild Child"" should be mandatory viewing for anyone in the helping professions and/or child development; this case raises ethical issues that deserve critical thought.

It has all the qualities you want from a documentary: The movie depicts Genie, a 13 year old who was systematically isolated by her father and probably also her mother for most of her life. Discovered by a social worker, she was suddenly in the limelight of hospital staff and researchers. There were many mistakes made in her care, and the film illuminates the ethical issues of attempting to be both caregiver and researcher. Infighting was apparently the norm in this case. Also depicted is how utterly powerless CPS was to ensure Genie's safety when she returned to her mother, and then to a series of abusive foster homes after her mother could not care for her. Language acquisition and attempted remediation of early deprivation are illustrated. Also could be good for discussing attachment issues.
