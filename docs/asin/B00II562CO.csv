New developments in the relatonships between certain members of the group come to the surface, new plans on how to make friends are put to the test, and a discovery of one cross dressing maid comes to light (though why it took 17 episodes for this to come out is all part of the charm).  But why is Sena and Kozara looking uncomfortable right now, and can the most perverted member bring peace to all involved?This season takes all from the first and amps it up, you really connect with each one of the members and cheer them on in their never endig pursuit for friendship.  The character development is great and the introduction of new secondary characters do not pull any attention from the story (especially Maria's older sister).  Overall both series was good, and the ending leaves a huge opening for season three (though this goes through volume 8 of the manga- there is more than enough out there for at least 2 more seasons).

Kodaka, Sena, Yozora and the rest of the Neighbor's Club are back and once again their misguided efforts to learn how to make friends are hampered by their quirkiness. This time around tensions will reach their boiling point due to internal club conflicts and external school influences. When all is said and done will the club survive?While the characters continue to be both aggravating and endearing thankfully they also continue to be hilarious and entertaining. The addition of profanity felt a little out of place to me and seemed like it was added simply to make the show more edgy.The animation is top notch, the characters are compelling, the story is both hilarious and intriguing with an excellent English dub making this series a must own for any anime fan and one of my favorite animes!Be warned this anime contains profanity and fan service so it may not be suitable for children!

1694219,A36INLW8OL3A73,B00II562CO,"D. Aiken ""social observer""","[4, 28]","Finding it better to have at least watched a version of this release before commenting on it instead of wishful thinking, this review is of the long-available censored version from that &#34;other&#34; market, and the series was found, sadly, wanting...very wanting. As an early reviewer that raved about the first season only to find the complete and uncensored version not up to anticipated standards regarding child  and underage nudity. This series, Season 2, continues the decline into &#34;the Agenda' abbess. There is much, however, to recommend this well-drawn and fast-paced series. It will be difficult but not impossible to keep spoilers out.Yozora and Sena remain at each other's throats, often to the point of obsession worthy of intervention.Kodaka and Sena have a relationship set by their fathers that neither of the teenagers were aware of; if you thought Yozora and Sena were at odds before that revelation, you seen nothing yet.Maria has an older sister, also a &#34;sister&#34;,15 years old, dresses in a &#34;mini-habit&#34; and is a belching potty-mouth, just as Maria. Their relationship is an intense &#34;typical &#34; sister against sister relationship.Kobato finds she has a following in her school after her performance at their cultural festival; someone on the series production staff, however, still has an unexplainable obsession with baring her crotch, just as they did in season one.Yukimura, the wanna'be male that Yozora has been having fun with by making &#34;him&#34; dress in female clothes...hummm...well,while the whole club goes to an amusement park for the day, after a &#34;mishap&#34; requiring a bath in the public bath, Maria decides she must bath with the males, strips down and, once in the bath, points to Kodaka's &#34;junk&#34; and ask, &#34;What's  that used for?&#34;...what else does one expect from a ten-year-old female bathing with a teen-aged male not her relation in a public bath...then she comments about Yukimura's &#34;construction while &#34;he&#34;...maybe...is washing Kodaka's back.Rika wants to upgrade her looks. She is also a certifiable sexual deviant and continues her obsession with male homo-erotica by both introducing a dating sym game where the only one-on-one action in this series is between two males and the reading of a erotica books that uses language I will not repeat; Rica could have been written out of the series and the series would not have suffered.The truth about Maria's true status as a nun is reveled and the ending of the series indicated another season is needed to complete the story.While I will eventually buy this series, it isn't a priority only because of the descent into further sexual degradation of both Maria,a 10 year old, and 14 year old Kobato. There simply is no need for it and, as such, 3 stars is generous.",3,Haganai Next,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,2822,"['Finding', 'better', 'have', 'least', 'watched', 'version', 'release', 'commenting', 'instead', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'review', 'long-available', 'censored', 'version', '34', 'other', '34', 'market', 'series', 'was', 'found', 'sadly', 'wanting', 'very', 'wanting', 'early', 'reviewer', 'raved', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'find', 'complete', 'uncensored', 'version', 'not', 'anticipated', 'standards', 'regarding', 'child', 'underage', 'nudity', 'series', 'Season', '2', 'decline', '34', 'Agenda', 'abbess', 'much', 'however', 'recommend', 'well-drawn', 'fast-paced', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'keep', 'spoilers', 'out.Yozora', 'Sena', 'remain', 'other', 'throats', 'often', 'point', 'obsession', 'worthy', 'intervention.Kodaka', 'Sena', 'have', 'relationship', 'set', 'fathers', 'teenagers', 'were', 'aware', 'thought', 'Yozora', 'Sena', 'were', 'odds', 'revelation', 'seen', 'nothing', 'yet.Maria', 'older', 'sister', 'also', '34', 'sister', '34', ',15', 'years', 'old', '34', 'mini-habit', '34', 'belching', 'potty-mouth', 'just', 'Maria', 'relationship', 'intense', '34', 'typical', '34', 'sister', 'sister', 'relationship.Kobato', 'following', 'school', 'performance', 'cultural', 'festival', 'someone', 'series', 'production', 'staff', 'however', 'still', 'unexplainable', 'obsession', 'baring', 'crotch', 'just', 'did', 'season', 'one.Yukimura', ""wanna'be"", 'male', 'Yozora', 'been', 'having', 'fun', 'making', '34', '34', 'dress', 'female', 'clothes', 'hummm', 'well', 'whole', 'club', 'amusement', 'park', 'day', '34', 'mishap', '34', 'requiring', 'bath', 'public', 'bath', 'Maria', 'must', 'bath', 'males', 'strips', 'down', 'once', 'bath', 'points', 'Kodaka', '34', 'junk', '34', 'ask', '34', 'What', 'used', '34', 'what', 'else', 'one', 'expect', 'ten-year-old', 'female', 'bathing', 'teen-aged', 'male', 'not', 'relation', 'public', 'bath', 'then', 'comments', 'Yukimura', '34', 'construction', '34', '34', 'maybe', 'washing', 'Kodaka', 'back.Rika', 'upgrade', 'looks', 'also', 'certifiable', 'sexual', 'deviant', 'obsession', 'male', 'homo-erotica', 'introducing', 'dating', 'sym', 'game', 'where', 'only', 'one-on-one', 'action', 'series', 'two', 'males', 'reading', 'erotica', 'books', 'language', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'Rica', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'series', 'series', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'suffered.The', 'truth', 'Maria', 'true', 'status', 'nun', 'reveled', 'ending', 'series', 'indicated', 'season', 'needed', 'complete', 'story.While', 'will', 'eventually', 'buy', 'series', ""n't"", 'priority', 'only', 'descent', 'further', 'sexual', 'degradation', 'Maria', '10', 'year', 'old', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Kobato', 'simply', 'need', 'such', '3', 'stars', 'generous']",N/A

The series humor is pretty slapstick with a good touch of teen angst and drama of some unrequited love and the rivalry it causes.  The characters are as endearing here as they were in the beginning which really make the series  good one as you care what happens to all of them throughout the series.
