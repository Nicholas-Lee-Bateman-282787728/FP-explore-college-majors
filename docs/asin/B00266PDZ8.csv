I was five years old when the show first aired in 1973 and I think it was shown in the 10pm slot due to some of the violence, so I only remember small bits and pieces of the show. At the time (in the 1970's) I was too young to stay up and watch most of it (much less appreciate it), but being able to watch it now and follow the storyline is unbelievable. This is hands down one of the greatest cop shows of all time.As an example, tonight they showed the episode ""Line Of Fire"" where Jan-Michael Vincent was training and promoted to the S.W.A.T. team (his name was Hauser). Hauser was singled out and picked on, as the head of S.W.A.T. (Cameron Mitchell) continuously put Hauser in training situations where Hauser was sure to make mistakes. The episode followed Hauser home to his relationship with his very supportive wife, which I thought was a very nice touch. In the end, Hauser gets his chance to shoot a crook down. After doing so, Hauser has mixed feelings afterwards about his job to kill when required....and that is how the episode ended (as a side note, Mitchell reprises his role as a S.W.A.T. member in one episode of S.W.A.T. season one, though the characters are different [1976]).What I have just described to you is just a small snippet of one of the many outstanding storylines of the magnificent action/drama series Police Story - a five star classic cop show with a huge variety of five star actors.",5,One-of-a-kind show,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,1493,"['show', 'now', 'being', 'shown', 'Retro-TV', 'can', 'say', '..WOW', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'aired', '1973', 'think', 'was', 'shown', '10pm', 'slot', 'due', 'violence', 'only', 'remember', 'small', 'bits', 'pieces', 'show', 'time', '1970', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'stay', 'up', 'watch', 'most', 'much', 'less', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'now', 'follow', 'storyline', 'unbelievable', 'down', 'one', 'greatest', 'cop', 'shows', 'time.As', 'example', 'tonight', 'showed', 'episode', 'Line', 'Fire', 'where', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'was', 'training', 'promoted', 'S.W.A.T', 'team', 'name', 'was', 'Hauser', 'Hauser', 'was', 'singled', 'out', 'picked', 'head', 'S.W.A.T', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'continuously', 'put', 'Hauser', 'training', 'situations', 'where', 'Hauser', 'was', 'sure', 'make', 'mistakes', 'episode', 'followed', 'Hauser', 'home', 'relationship', 'very', 'supportive', 'wife', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'end', 'Hauser', 'chance', 'shoot', 'crook', 'down', 'doing', 'so', 'Hauser', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'afterwards', 'job', 'kill', 'when', 'required', '.and', 'how', 'episode', 'ended', 'side', 'note', 'Mitchell', 'role', 'S.W.A.T', 'member', 'one', 'episode', 'S.W.A.T', 'season', 'one', 'characters', 'are', 'different', '[', '1976', ']', '.What', 'have', 'just', 'described', 'just', 'small', 'snippet', 'one', 'many', 'outstanding', 'storylines', 'magnificent', 'action/drama', 'series', 'Police', 'Story', 'five', 'star', 'classic', 'cop', 'show', 'huge', 'variety', 'five', 'star', 'actors']",Police Story

You quickly learn that the twisted sense of humor that police officers maintain is a defense mechanism. To the best of my knowledge, the episode titled ""The Wyat Earp Syndrome"" was the first time that slow motion was used in depicting what happens to a police officer in a deadly force situation.  You experience the loss of some senses and the enhancement of others as the situation unfolds. You don't know from episode to episode who is going to be appearing. One week it's SWAT action. The next, Robbery team detectives, Vice cops, Accident Investigation Division and, of course, Patrol Division. The cops are real people with their flaws, prejudices and guts. I was a rookie cop when Season 2 started. We considered this mandatory viewing for cops back in the early 1970's. I've been retired from the job for over two years now. In that time, I had not missed being a cop one time, until I watched the first episode of Season 1, ""Slow Boy."" Vic Morrow made his first appearance as Sgt. Joe La Frieda and it's a gem. I can't recommend this enough. My youngest daughter made a bunch of points with sending this to me. I had no idea that it had been released to DVD. I'll be snapping up the remaining seasons as they become available. This would be a subperb series for someone to assemble as a BOXED SET with commentaries and other special features added. Someone please take the hint. There's an awful lot of cops, active and retired, in this country who would snap this up.
