I teach elementary school and I have no children so I'm not up on what's going on with highschoolers but if this is it, it is truly scary.  This is what they consider normal?  My parents were all the way up in my business, as well as my brother's.  As a result, we got no where near this sort of stuff. Anyway, as I watched the movie, I couldn't focus because I was too distracted by the alarming thought that people who are teenagers today are going to be running things in a few years.  If this is how they're starting off, I might have to start getting ready like one of those doomsday preppers.  The acting was so-so and I think the movie was trying to make a point about maturing.

1679813,A28VE4C1TXPLOC,B00GNZLYU6,L. Delaney,"[5, 7]","*SPOILERS. So many SPOILERS*I'm not even sure where to start. This movie...oh man, this movie. I thought it was going to be a cute and somewhat clever indie teen dramedy. It was not. It wasn't any of those things and a pox on the house of the movie gods who allowed this movie to released out into the wild.Andy and Ferret are the two school super stoners. They are in the last two months of their senior year of high school in Southern California. They are casually drinking some beer and smoking a joint before going to their first class, discussing ridiculousness, unaware that their world is about to be turned upside down by a new addition to the school; Mandy. Mandy's hot and smart. Andy's smitten. I mean, yeah, he's a stoner but as Ferret points out those smart girls love to try and change Andy. Oh, Andy's got a chance.Let's stop here for a minute and discuss the music. I thought the music was going to be great. The song used in the trailer is good. The movie itself? No. NO no no. It starts off with a really heinous song about sniffing blow off some dude's junk. Argh. It doesn't get any better from there. I had to tune out the music because it was just making me punchy.So there's a party where Mandy meets everyone after she's befriended by the school's mean girls. Andy's kind of digging her but he ends up sleepiing with some freshman at the party. Meanwhile, Mandy's being hit on by the school's dumb jock. Really dumb. I couldn't figure out if he had a mental disability and the movie was making fun of it or he was just supposed to be an extreme stereotype. Either way it was so exaggerated and wrong.Oh, a lot of coke gets done in this movie too. A lot. Actually, it seems like all these kids do is get high, drink, and sleep with each other. How are any of them graduating? Ugh.A love letter gets written after the party. By who? By Andy to Mandy and I just realized that their names rhyme. Oh, for heaven's sake...By this time things are just getting super random and I have no idea what this movie is trying to be or what it's trying to say. It's rambling like the drunk, high kids that are its focal point. Anyway, somehow Mandy realizes that Andy wrote her the love letter and they end up going to the beach together after school. They're giggling, being pseudo deep about the beach and whatnot and then Mandy says something along the lines of Andy not being anything like the rumors she's heard. Now, keep in mind, Andy is EXACTLY like the rumors. What rumors? He'll stick his junk in anything but only freshmen are naive enough to let him go there. But Andy is being so sweet at the beach. The rumors can't be true!! Despite this Mandy is sucked in and ends up sucking something of Andy's. No condom. Mandy's not quite as smart as we thought. Well, actually, I never thought she was smart but whatever.This is where I sort of started to tune out. The drama reached critical propotions and I wanted to smack everyone but Ferret in the face. Ferret was actually the only character that made any kind of sense.At the end of this movie I was wondering if it seemed stupid because I was an East Coast kid and just didn't understand what it was like to go to school in Southern California. Even when I was 16 I would have told all of those idiots to get a grip. But no, this movie seemed stupid because it was a low-budget hot mess. So many minutes of my life that I can never get back.",1,This was HORRIBLE,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,3411,"['*SPOILERS', 'So', 'many', 'SPOILERS*I', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'where', 'start', 'movie', 'oh', 'man', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'cute', 'somewhat', 'clever', 'indie', 'teen', 'dramedy', 'was', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'things', 'pox', 'house', 'movie', 'gods', 'who', 'allowed', 'movie', 'released', 'out', 'wild.Andy', 'Ferret', 'are', 'two', 'school', 'super', 'stoners', 'are', 'last', 'two', 'months', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'Southern', 'California', 'are', 'casually', 'drinking', 'beer', 'smoking', 'joint', 'before', 'going', 'first', 'class', 'discussing', 'ridiculousness', 'unaware', 'world', 'be', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'new', 'addition', 'school', 'Mandy', 'Mandy', 'hot', 'smart', 'Andy', 'smitten', 'mean', 'yeah', 'stoner', 'Ferret', 'out', 'smart', 'girls', 'love', 'try', 'change', 'Andy', 'Oh', 'Andy', 'got', 'chance.Let', 'stop', 'here', 'minute', 'discuss', 'music', 'thought', 'music', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'song', 'used', 'trailer', 'good', 'movie', 'No', 'NO', 'really', 'heinous', 'song', 'sniffing', 'blow', 'off', 'dude', 'junk', 'Argh', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'there', 'had', 'tune', 'out', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'making', 'party', 'where', 'Mandy', 'everyone', 'befriended', 'school', 'mean', 'girls', 'Andy', 'kind', 'digging', 'up', 'sleepiing', 'freshman', 'party', 'Meanwhile', 'Mandy', 'being', 'hit', 'school', 'dumb', 'jock', 'Really', 'dumb', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'had', 'mental', 'disability', 'movie', 'was', 'making', 'fun', 'was', 'just', 'supposed', 'be', 'extreme', 'stereotype', 'way', 'was', 'so', 'exaggerated', 'wrong.Oh', 'lot', 'coke', 'done', 'movie', 'too', 'lot', 'Actually', 'kids', 'do', 'get', 'high', 'drink', 'sleep', 'other', 'How', 'are', 'graduating', 'Ugh.A', 'love', 'letter', 'written', 'party', 'who', 'Andy', 'Mandy', 'just', 'realized', 'names', 'rhyme', 'Oh', 'heaven', 'sake', 'time', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'super', 'random', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'what', 'trying', 'say', 'rambling', 'drunk', 'high', 'kids', 'are', 'focal', 'point', 'Anyway', 'somehow', 'Mandy', 'Andy', 'wrote', 'love', 'letter', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'beach', 'together', 'school', ""'re"", 'giggling', 'being', 'pseudo', 'deep', 'beach', 'whatnot', 'then', 'Mandy', 'something', 'lines', 'Andy', 'not', 'being', 'anything', 'rumors', 'heard', 'Now', 'keep', 'mind', 'Andy', 'EXACTLY', 'rumors', 'What', 'rumors', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'junk', 'anything', 'only', 'freshmen', 'are', 'naive', 'enough', 'let', 'go', 'there', 'Andy', 'being', 'so', 'sweet', 'beach', 'rumors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'true', 'Mandy', 'sucked', 'up', 'sucking', 'something', 'Andy', 'condom', 'Mandy', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'smart', 'thought', 'Well', 'actually', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'smart', 'whatever.This', 'where', 'sort', 'started', 'tune', 'out', 'drama', 'reached', 'critical', 'propotions', 'wanted', 'smack', 'everyone', 'Ferret', 'face', 'Ferret', 'was', 'actually', 'only', 'character', 'made', 'kind', 'sense.At', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'wondering', 'seemed', 'stupid', 'was', 'East', 'Coast', 'kid', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'go', 'school', 'Southern', 'California', 'Even', 'when', 'was', '16', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'idiots', 'get', 'grip', 'movie', 'seemed', 'stupid', 'was', 'low-budget', 'hot', 'mess', 'So', 'many', 'minutes', 'life', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'back']",Getting That Girl
