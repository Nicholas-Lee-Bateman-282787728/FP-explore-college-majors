1209872,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B001KVZ6HK,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 6]","What amazes me about the latest epic 'Marvel' Comics movie is how many things go right.  With the ensemble of so many superheroes placed on one screen:  [Captain America, (Evans); Black Widow, (Johansson); Iron Man, (Downey, Jr.); The Incredible Hulk, (Ruffalo); Thor, (Hemsworth); and Hawkeye (Renner)]; the results easily could have been a cluttered mess.  Instead, nearly all the necessary elements are properly placed.  First of all, the menace of Thor's brother, Loki (Hiddleston), and his army of gothic extraterrestrials provides enough peril to keep all the mighty guardians on the ropes for substantial stretches of the film.  The second element is keeping the mood intact.  'The Avengers' gets campy in plenty of places, yet stays serious enough to sustain its suspense.  How a movie juggles these two mood swings can easily make or break it.  ('Star Wars' is the supreme example of stellar success; while 'Armageddon' remains a prime contender as one of the worst juggling acts.) Between the nimble work of Screenwriter/Director, Joss Whedon, (with screenwriter, Zak Penn) and editors (Ford and Lassek), the film seldom loses a step or its nerve.  Added to that Samuel L. Jackson, as helmsman Nick Fury, the story stabilizes and prevents the exposition from becoming cloudy or long-winded.One of the ingenious elements found in the fray is the chemistry of characters and the interplay of their indomitable egos.  Front in center for both the banter and suspense is top ego, 'Iron Man' (Oddly, one of the few icons who relies on human invention rather than on superhuman strength.) played by Downey, who by his talent and the usual snappy script, propels the entertainment to its best heights.  However, ""The Incredible Hulk"" (played by an unusually fragile Ruffalo) goes closest to the precipice of danger, providing an unstable danger to the core team.  In an unusual twist, these superheroes are at such odds with each other, the threat of their enemies remains elusive until they can get their act together.The plot is perhaps the lesser player next to the clashing arcade.  Loki who is the incorrigible demi god (and brother Thor's alter ego) has an insatiable desire to subjugate everyone on planet earth.  Using the forbidden, frozen substance used in the film 'Thor,' Loki and his henchmen seek to change and control mankind with this power and convert mankind by servile fear.While 'The Avengers' is nearly pitch perfect entertainment, not all of the conflicts and dialogue succeeds.  While I loved and admired all the wonderful, escapist elements the movie offers, it lacked some of the overall quality found in recent 'Marvel' offerings.  It doesn't match the perfection of the first 'Iron Man,' the poignancy of 'Thor,' nor the cohesiveness of 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. A comparison with comic book classics such as 'The Dark Knight,' 'Spiderman 2,' or the splendor of the first two 'Superman' movies, and this film surely falls short. (Although I certainly admired how they wove all the recent 'Marvel' movies so seamlessly together--another tell-tale sign that this movie could have easily been a disaster!)But where `The Avengers' succeeds, it does so in spades.  As perfect popcorn entertainment, 'The Avengers' gets it right--good enough to spend your extra dollars for 3D or I-Max, and enough for people with home entertainment centers to be extra grateful during Thanksgiving or another part of the holiday season when this film will undoubtedly come out on DVD.",4,"Spectacularly Good, Not Great",1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,3504,"['What', 'latest', 'epic', ""'Marvel"", 'Comics', 'movie', 'how', 'many', 'things', 'go', 'right', 'ensemble', 'so', 'many', 'superheroes', 'placed', 'one', 'screen', '[', 'Captain', 'America', 'Evans', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Johansson', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Ruffalo', 'Thor', 'Hemsworth', 'Hawkeye', 'Renner', ']', 'results', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cluttered', 'mess', 'Instead', 'nearly', 'necessary', 'elements', 'are', 'properly', 'placed', 'First', 'all', 'menace', 'Thor', 'brother', 'Loki', 'Hiddleston', 'army', 'gothic', 'extraterrestrials', 'enough', 'peril', 'keep', 'mighty', 'guardians', 'ropes', 'substantial', 'stretches', 'film', 'second', 'element', 'keeping', 'mood', 'intact', 'Avengers', 'campy', 'plenty', 'places', 'yet', 'serious', 'enough', 'sustain', 'suspense', 'How', 'movie', 'two', 'mood', 'swings', 'can', 'easily', 'make', 'break', ""'Star"", 'Wars', 'supreme', 'example', 'stellar', 'success', ""'Armageddon"", 'prime', 'contender', 'one', 'worst', 'juggling', 'acts', 'nimble', 'work', 'Screenwriter/Director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'screenwriter', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'editors', 'Ford', 'Lassek', 'film', 'seldom', 'step', 'nerve', 'Added', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'helmsman', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'story', 'stabilizes', 'exposition', 'becoming', 'cloudy', 'long-winded.One', 'ingenious', 'elements', 'found', 'fray', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'interplay', 'indomitable', 'egos', 'Front', 'center', 'banter', 'suspense', 'top', 'ego', ""'Iron"", 'Man', 'Oddly', 'one', 'few', 'icons', 'who', 'relies', 'human', 'invention', 'rather', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'played', 'Downey', 'who', 'talent', 'usual', 'snappy', 'script', 'entertainment', 'best', 'heights', 'However', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'played', 'unusually', 'fragile', 'Ruffalo', 'closest', 'precipice', 'danger', 'providing', 'unstable', 'danger', 'core', 'team', 'unusual', 'twist', 'superheroes', 'are', 'such', 'odds', 'other', 'threat', 'enemies', 'elusive', 'can', 'get', 'act', 'together.The', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'lesser', 'player', 'clashing', 'arcade', 'Loki', 'who', 'incorrigible', 'demi', 'god', 'Thor', 'alter', 'ego', 'insatiable', 'desire', 'subjugate', 'everyone', 'planet', 'earth', 'Using', 'forbidden', 'frozen', 'substance', 'used', 'film', ""'Thor"", 'Loki', 'henchmen', 'seek', 'change', 'control', 'mankind', 'power', 'convert', 'mankind', 'servile', 'fear.While', 'Avengers', 'nearly', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'entertainment', 'not', 'conflicts', 'dialogue', 'loved', 'admired', 'wonderful', 'escapist', 'elements', 'movie', 'lacked', 'overall', 'quality', 'found', 'recent', ""'Marvel"", 'offerings', ""n't"", 'match', 'perfection', 'first', ""'Iron"", 'Man', 'poignancy', ""'Thor"", 'cohesiveness', ""'Captain"", 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'comparison', 'comic', 'book', 'classics', 'such', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', '2', 'splendor', 'first', 'two', ""'Superman"", 'movies', 'film', 'surely', 'short', 'certainly', 'admired', 'how', 'wove', 'recent', ""'Marvel"", 'movies', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'together', 'tell-tale', 'sign', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'disaster', 'where', 'Avengers', 'so', 'spades', 'perfect', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'Avengers', 'right', 'good', 'enough', 'spend', 'extra', 'dollars', '3D', 'I-Max', 'enough', 'people', 'home', 'entertainment', 'centers', 'be', 'extra', 'grateful', 'Thanksgiving', 'part', 'holiday', 'season', 'when', 'film', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'come', 'out', 'DVD']",Marvel's: The Avengers

You've definitely seen the finale, and even the McGuffin, because they took it straight from the first Transformers movie.  The Avengers is great fun, but it's fading from memory faster than who won last season's American Idol.While fans of Joss Whedon will likely be pleased, I think his victory with the Avengers is a double edged sword.  He carefully corrals the thicket of big names here, but in the process we're stuck with a laundry list of cliche scenes, a very weak villain, dialog that exists purely to waste time and characters who rely far too much on their costume to get them through the movie.One can't shake the feeling, no matter whose names appear as writers, the Avengers smacks of committee construction.  Excluding Sam Jackson, most of what is here is by the numbers.  There are precious few moments of humanity in a story that should be overflowing with it.  In this respect,  think this movie is a polar opposite of Ang Lee's HULK.  A film that was painfully boring, but also full of human touches - it had a style that could have been robbed like a gold mine to add more character in the place of the dreadful and endless expository dialog exchanges before we're shuttled to the MIchael Bay Transformers action scenes we've seen a thousand times by this point.But is it bad?  Heck no.  The Avengers is ultimately a good time if you can settle for less.

""jorius whitman""","[1, 1]","I'd rank this movie up there with The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 as the most &#34;true to comics feeling&#34; that you'll ever see on the big screen. As a kid growing up I loved the Avengers, and the way this movie played out is exactly as I envisioned them fighting it out as I read the comics as a kid. It was like watching your childhood fantasies realized, in comic book form.This movie could have been a mess. Meshing 6-7+ different characters together is a huge challenge but Joss Whedon pulls it off. Using Nick Fury and SHIELD as the glue, they gather up all the heroes to stop a crisis without ever crossing that campy or uncomfortable line. The actors and writers did their part by adding some strong back-and-forth repartee between them that will cause some laughs as well as some &#34;I can't believe he said that&#34; moments. The action scenes are top notch, most of them true to the comics and the final flurry of an action scene that ends the movie will leave you in awe, wishing for more.The negatives about this film are few but there are some. The film slows down significantly in the middle, with a lot of dialogue and not a whole lot else going on...maybe they were just building up to the last scene but at times it felt like the movie kind of dragged on a bit before it got good again. Also the main villain seems to be Loki but he actually takes a rather large back seat to the invading aliens, which kind of take over the movie at the end. It was disappointing to not see Loki really put up a fight, especially towards the end....I know he is the trickster god and manipulation is his game (and there are elements of that), but it would have been nice to see him do a bit more here than just take a break for large parts of the movie.Still, despite those things, this was a movie that once I saw it at the theaters, I knew I had to own it on DVD. I can only hope the second one is better, as the build-up has already begun (Iron Man 3 is out at the time of this posting), and the proposed villain revealed at the end of this movie left a lot of us drooling for more.",5,One of the best superhero movies ever made,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,2093,"[""'d"", 'rank', 'movie', 'there', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'most', '34', 'true', 'comics', 'feeling', '34', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'loved', 'Avengers', 'way', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'exactly', 'envisioned', 'fighting', 'read', 'comics', 'kid', 'was', 'watching', 'childhood', 'fantasies', 'realized', 'comic', 'book', 'form.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mess', 'Meshing', '6-7+', 'different', 'characters', 'together', 'huge', 'challenge', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'off', 'Using', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'SHIELD', 'glue', 'gather', 'up', 'heroes', 'stop', 'crisis', 'ever', 'crossing', 'campy', 'uncomfortable', 'line', 'actors', 'writers', 'did', 'part', 'adding', 'strong', 'back-and-forth', 'repartee', 'will', 'cause', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'said', '34', 'moments', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'most', 'true', 'comics', 'final', 'flurry', 'action', 'scene', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'awe', 'wishing', 'more.The', 'negatives', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'film', 'down', 'significantly', 'middle', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'else', 'going', 'maybe', 'were', 'just', 'building', 'up', 'last', 'scene', 'times', 'felt', 'movie', 'kind', 'dragged', 'bit', 'got', 'good', 'again', 'Also', 'main', 'villain', 'be', 'Loki', 'actually', 'rather', 'large', 'back', 'seat', 'invading', 'aliens', 'kind', 'take', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'disappointing', 'not', 'see', 'Loki', 'really', 'put', 'up', 'fight', 'especially', 'end', '.I', 'know', 'trickster', 'god', 'manipulation', 'game', 'are', 'elements', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'do', 'bit', 'more', 'here', 'just', 'take', 'break', 'large', 'parts', 'movie.Still', 'things', 'was', 'movie', 'once', 'saw', 'theaters', 'knew', 'had', 'own', 'DVD', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'second', 'one', 'better', 'build-up', 'already', 'begun', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'out', 'time', 'posting', 'proposed', 'villain', 'revealed', 'end', 'movie', 'left', 'lot', 'drooling', 'more']",Marvel's: The Avengers

And then watch out because no way is some half-mad Loki (and some kin to Thor, of all people) going to take his massive, seemingly never-ending and well-equipped army against the good folks of New Jack City (hey, haven't those citizens had enough lately why not pick on say, Charleston , South Carolina or some place like that) without a fight to the finish, And there you have it. Oh, except this thought, if the American government hired this little heroic band then that seven hundred billion defense budget could be reduced to the price of airfare and a new change of clothes.

Ruffalo was excellent as Banner/the Hulk (best Hulk so far), Evans really IS Captain America (I wasn't so sure with the first movie), I have accepted Hemsworth as Thor (and he did a fine job here), Downey Jr. (what can you say besides the fact that he was born to play Stark/Iron Man, don't think anyone else could pull it off and still have the movie magic seen here), I even think Jeremy Renner turned out to be a good casting choice for Hawkeye (get a costume on him, maybe not in the comic's purple, but with the horned mask). I was not thrilled with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow (she looked bored or like she wished she was somewhere else), and though I usually like her, it didn't work in this situation. Cobie Smulders was a nice surprise and loved her as Agent Hill. The rest of the cast were fine (Sam Jackson is going to be Sam Jackson, and it's too late to bitch, he is cemented in the Nick Fury role), it was great to see Harry Dean Stanton discover Banner in a pile of Hulk induced rubble, and while some people have been negative, Tom Hiddleston is perfectly smarmy as Loki. Unfortunately, Gwyneth was looking a little rough this time around (sorry, but it's true) as compared to her Pepper Potts from the first Iron Man. Oh my Lord, she was absolutely stunning/radiant/perfect in that one!The biggest congratulations go to Joss Whedon, though. I've been a fan of all of his work since the first episode of Buffy my girlfriend made me watch back in 1998. Joss really gets his characters to interact well with each other emotionally, and his timing and snappy dialogue are always spot-on. There are still scenes from Buffy that I need Kleenex to get through, just one  example is Spike comforting Buffy after her mother dies (although he was coming to kill her, he sees her crying and sits down and asks her what's wrong, then pats her on the shoulder). I am glad Joss is signed on for the second Avengers movie, because he really pulled off a difficult task in this one. Unlike the X-Men or Fantastic Four (sorry for even mentioning Reid Richards & Co.), who all lived in the same place and/or had commonalities as either mutants or people bombarded by galactic radiation, the Avengers is a motley group of completely different superheroes from different times, dimensions, backgrounds, etc. I wasn't sure how Whedon would do with the massive action scenes because he always had to do things on such a small scale and budget before this, but my worries were unfounded as the action was very well done. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable film.Some superhero movies have really become quite good since Sam Raimi raised the bar with the first two Spider-Man outings. They, along with X-Men: First Class, DC Comics' Dark Knight trilogy, and this, The Avengers, have all been wonderful. Love feeling like a kid again when I watch a movie!

1209943,AYYXP75GUA6RP,B001KVZ6HK,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Of course I wanted to like this, and going in, I was confident that it would be a five star blast. But from the first scene on, I had the alarming sense that something was badly wrong. Yes, it is the best reproduction of an action comic on screen, but aside from the verbal sparring, I don't see anything here that tops something like X2 (beyond the superfighting). I can understand how lovers of the source material would adore this movie, but please don't expect any more than that. Don't be confused by Nolan's films or Whedon's pedigree (or the fanboy love) into anticipating genuine drama, story intrigue (or coherence) from a movie constructed around a string of powers fights.I had wanted to say that this was the best movie that could have been delivered under the intense fan-service constraints imposed on its creators. But (after seeing it four times and falling asleep twice) I can't. This isn't The Dark Night. There's a huge amount of enjoyable detail here that improves over the earlier movies in this franchise, but there are many elements that still seem ham handed. Some examples:* The first post-credits scene has Black Widow escaping from bondage; an awesome scene in the trailer. This is undercut in the movie by revealing that her captors already know her identity and that they have essentially surrendered. Fighting her way out of a chair is cool in itself, and the movie seems to be satisfied with that & unconcerned that the setup lowers the dramatic stakes. Before the fight begins, she is presented as neither vulnerable nor in peril.* The entire plot of the movie (before its interminable climax) turns out to be an elaborate scheme to unleash a monster from among the good guys. We never find out exactly why this is Loki's scheme (except in the deleted scenes: it's a prophylactic) but, in any case, it doesn't lead anywhere & isn't really motivated by anything. Angel (series 4) had exactly the same problem with unmotivated antagonism but it is MUCH more apparent here. There's little effort to conceal a structure that has the heroes running in a circle to the climactic fight.Is it just me? I hope I'm not being obsessively picky about a summer blockbuster. But I don't think it *is* just me, because the director's commentary obsesses over logistical detail. Whedon explains that the Iron Man / Thor battle was a contractual requirement, and that having them fight over possession of the captive Loki was an improvement over Marvel's ""brainwash"" concept. It just didn't play that way to me. Thor has no credible motive for fighting after learning that keeping Loki on earth could save humanity. In each watch-through this comes across as a flimsy excuse for a battle, especially after Thor drops the matter (without a word) after a dust-up.I could go on with the disappointing scenes (e.g. a *trickster god* being fooled by a ruse *that every audience member saw through* into blabbing his unnecessarily complex scheme) but maybe a blockbusters shouldn't be judged on those terms. And if you like this type of movie then you'll already have seen it and will have thrilled to its many cool details. I was hoping for more, so I can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't already know they like it. Ruffalo's Hulk is a major advance in the maturation of the screen superhero, but if you aren't interested in comic book worlds for their own sake then that won't matter to you & you should wait for the next movie in the hopes that it becomes what this one promised to be.",3,Finest collection of super fights & super banter ever.,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,3503,"['course', 'wanted', 'like', 'going', 'was', 'confident', 'would', 'be', 'five', 'star', 'blast', 'first', 'scene', 'had', 'alarming', 'sense', 'something', 'was', 'badly', 'wrong', 'Yes', 'best', 'reproduction', 'action', 'comic', 'screen', 'aside', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'here', 'something', 'X2', 'superfighting', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'lovers', 'source', 'material', 'would', 'adore', 'movie', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'more', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'confused', 'Nolan', 'films', 'Whedon', 'pedigree', 'fanboy', 'love', 'anticipating', 'genuine', 'drama', 'story', 'intrigue', 'coherence', 'movie', 'constructed', 'string', 'powers', 'fights.I', 'had', 'wanted', 'say', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'delivered', 'intense', 'fan-service', 'constraints', 'imposed', 'creators', 'seeing', 'four', 'times', 'falling', 'asleep', 'twice', 'ca', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'Dark', 'Night', 'huge', 'amount', 'enjoyable', 'detail', 'here', 'earlier', 'movies', 'franchise', 'are', 'many', 'elements', 'still', 'seem', 'ham', 'handed', 'examples', '*', 'first', 'post-credits', 'scene', 'Black', 'Widow', 'escaping', 'bondage', 'awesome', 'scene', 'trailer', 'undercut', 'movie', 'revealing', 'captors', 'already', 'know', 'identity', 'have', 'essentially', 'surrendered', 'Fighting', 'way', 'chair', 'cool', 'movie', 'be', 'satisfied', 'unconcerned', 'setup', 'dramatic', 'stakes', 'fight', 'presented', 'vulnerable', 'peril', '*', 'entire', 'plot', 'movie', 'interminable', 'climax', 'out', 'be', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'unleash', 'monster', 'good', 'guys', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'why', 'Loki', 'scheme', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'prophylactic', 'case', ""n't"", 'lead', 'anywhere', ""n't"", 'really', 'motivated', 'anything', 'Angel', 'series', '4', 'had', 'exactly', 'same', 'problem', 'unmotivated', 'antagonism', 'MUCH', 'more', 'apparent', 'here', 'little', 'effort', 'conceal', 'structure', 'heroes', 'running', 'circle', 'climactic', 'fight.Is', 'just', 'hope', ""'m"", 'not', 'being', 'obsessively', 'picky', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', '*is*', 'just', 'director', 'commentary', 'obsesses', 'logistical', 'detail', 'Whedon', 'Iron', 'Man', '/', 'Thor', 'battle', 'was', 'contractual', 'requirement', 'having', 'fight', 'possession', 'captive', 'Loki', 'was', 'improvement', 'Marvel', 'brainwash', 'concept', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'way', 'Thor', 'credible', 'motive', 'fighting', 'learning', 'keeping', 'Loki', 'earth', 'could', 'save', 'humanity', 'watch-through', 'across', 'flimsy', 'excuse', 'battle', 'especially', 'Thor', 'matter', 'word', 'dust-up.I', 'could', 'go', 'disappointing', 'scenes', 'e.g', '*trickster', 'god*', 'being', 'fooled', 'ruse', 'audience', 'member', 'saw', 'through*', 'blabbing', 'unnecessarily', 'complex', 'scheme', 'maybe', 'blockbusters', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'judged', 'terms', 'like', 'type', 'movie', 'then', ""'ll"", 'already', 'have', 'seen', 'will', 'have', 'thrilled', 'many', 'cool', 'details', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'Ruffalo', 'Hulk', 'major', 'advance', 'maturation', 'screen', 'superhero', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'comic', 'book', 'worlds', 'own', 'sake', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'should', 'wait', 'next', 'movie', 'hopes', 'what', 'one', 'promised', 'be']",Marvel's: The Avengers

I highly recommend watching those movies first though; while it's not necessary to enjoy The Avengers, viewers will understand more of the events in the background. My sister had not seen the other movies first and so she didn't understand everything the first time she saw The Avengers. After we watched them though, and then watched this again, she had a deeper appreciation for the various plots.As for this blu-ray version, it is excellent.

1209967,ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B001KVZ6HK,"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster""","[2, 6]","The Avengers is the culmination of five previous movies and they could've easily screwed it up in so many different ways. Putting five disparate heroic characters from such different genres should've been a recipe for disaster. But somehow they manage to pull it off. And a large credit for that goes to Joss Whedon - an uber-comic fan who knew exactly what we wanted to see in the very first Superhero team-up film. All the predictable tropes of the comic books are here, but this is the first time we've ever seen them portrayed on film. The hero-on-hero fight, the team finally assembling and kicking superheroic butt all over New York. Great stuff.What makes The Avengers so different from recent blockbusters like Transfomers is that the emphasis is just as much on fleshing out the characters as on the entertaining action sequences. I can't recall any of Michael Bay's efforts having as much quotable dialogue as this film does (""Dost mother know, thoust wearest her drapes?"", ""Puny God""). Joss Whedon knows how to entertain an audience without insulting their intelligence, which is a tough act to pull off in most modern blockbuster films.I only have two minor criticisms - the 3D conversion and the lackluster soundtrack from Alan Silvestri. I believe the 3D was more the fault of the cinema - it looked muddy and flat, and I had a headache a few hours after watching it. The music sounded to me like sonic wallpaper for most of the film, but finally lifted at the end with a pretty rousing theme tune. It didn't doesn't sound like music from the same composer that did Captain America.I wish that I could recall one favourite moment, but the truth is that this entire film is one giant favourite moment. This is the ultimate superhero film I've been waiting to see since I was 12 years old and cracked open my first comic book.

Especially after I heard that Joss Whedon was co-writing and directing the film. This is the man that has created some of the best television ever (Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-7) (2010) 39 Disc,Angel: Complete Series,Firefly - The Complete Series,Dollhouse: The Complete Seasons 1 & 2) as well as some great cinema (Serenity (Collector's Edition), ""Cabin in the Woods""). This comic book film adaptation is about as perfect as it comes; it's Marvel's equivalent to DC'sThe Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition). However, it still has Marvel's trademark wham-bam sci-fi dazzle, unlike DC's more gritty realism (part of the reason I like DC more). Luckily, though, Whedon is able to pull it all off. His perfect talent of blending action, drama and humor pays off big-time! And, it doesn't hurt that he has a ridiculous knowledge and understanding of the Avengers and their mythology. Next to the Fantastic Four, the Avengers are the perfect dysfunctional family (that's one thing they *do* have over my favorite, the Justice League). I was especially happy to see that they finally got the Hulk's story right (third time's a charm). I'd still like to see a female Avenger other than Black Widow; but hope she might make an appearance in the new Daredevil reboot. All of the performances were solid, making the movie as enjoyable as can be. Favorite moment has to involve main baddie, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Every character has equal screen-time and their stories given some good light ... but not too much, leaving room for more revelation for sequels. One thing DC should do is take a cue from this film and if they EVER plan on making a Justice League film, they should try (and hope) to get the actors they've cast in other films -- i.e., Christian Bale as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern. However, unfortunately, seeing how Bale no longer wants to do Batman after this summer's film, and DC doesn't wish to connect their films, I doubt this will happen. However, there has been recent news that DC is in the process of making a Justice League film. Anyways, Whedon and company get it right! This very well might be the action flick to see this summer!

1210014,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B001KVZ6HK,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[2, 3]","When Thor's mischievous brother, Loki, makes a deal with the alien race Chitauri to help them secure the Tesseract Cube so they can conquer the galaxy, the Earth suddenly falls into great peril. With even the powerful top secret agency S.H.I.E.L.D. having difficulty containing Loki, there is only one call S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury can make: Avengers Assemble!The team is gathered--Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye--set out to do battle with Loki and his alien cohorts. If they don't overcome their differences and learn to work together as a team, the Earth will fall and Loki will rule the planet.The Avengers brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to combat a force of evil so great they either stand together or fall together, with the fate of the planet--even the galaxy--hanging in the balance.The Avengers is a difficult movie to review, more so, give a proper rating to because this movie is very much black and white between its story and its presentation, so that said, I'm going to quickly go over both and you'll see where I'm coming from at the end.The story: This is a single-plot movie, very much an A-to-B narrative and incredibly simple--too simple. Aliens are coming, we need to stop them so we'll get the Avengers to do it. That's it. From a storytelling perspective, it's too simple and too predictable. Big bad guy, big good guy(s), let's fight, good guys win. The end.However, if you view The Avengers as an end cap/final act to all the movies leading up to it: Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man II, Thor, Captain America--then you have something that definitely serves its purpose and more or less let's each character shine for the same amount of time. In this case, a simple story works despite, um, the many continuity flaws from the previous movies (i.e. Thor somehow now able to come to Earth, which renders the ending of Thor's movie moot, Tony Stark called upon to be Iron Man in the Avengers despite being banned from doing so in Iron Man II, the characters communicating to each other without earpieces or any communication devices. Maybe they're telepathic?).The presentation: This movie is a nerd's dream come true from start to finish. Assemble your favorite superheroes--of which each were spotlighted in their own movies, almost--put them together and have them go toe-to-toe with a larger-than-life threat that will squash the planet if they don't come through.From an eye candy perspective, this movie nailed it. Huge battles, lots of explosions, combat action, hammer throwing, Hulk smashing, shield boomeranging, repulsors firing, arrows shooting, girl fists punching--yeah, it has it all.It's also very important to point out that the casting of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk was an amazing choice. I honestly wasn't too thrilled with the news when I first heard it, with Ruffalo being more a chick-flick romance guy, but he got the role done so well that if there's a spin-off, I hope he gets the job. He's definitely earned it.Chris Evans as Captain America--a Superman performance, which is good and brought a traditional superhero element to the team. As the running joke was throughout the movie, a little ""old-fashioned"" was what was needed.Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man--do I really need to talk about this? He's the same Tony Stark from the first two movies, the only difference being he's mellowed out a bit because, despite his arrogance, he understands life isn't all about him and there's other people out there, too. This bit really comes through in this movie.Chris Helmsworth as Thor--bold, poetic, commanding, everything his character is supposed to be so kudos to him for carrying on with a great performance from the stand-alone movie.Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye--I don't know much about the comic character other than he's like Green Arrow, but perhaps with a more military-mind-set, so I can't comment. Renner did sell me on Hawkeye though, but why couldn't they give him that awesome mask? Maybe in the sequel.Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow--she really comes into her own in this flick because in Iron Man II, it was more a back-up appearance so we didn't know much about her. I'm glad she got the screen time she deserved and, come on, her fight scenes were fantastic.Tom Hiddleston as Loki--he's the bad guy you love to hate, the one that, even just looking at him, you want to punch in the face. I appreciated how Loki, to a degree, was a villain to sympathize with because of his exile, but you also get mad at him for being such a jerk about it.Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury--an excellent portrayal of Samuel L. Jackson being Samuel L. Jasckon--but under a fictitious alias. Yeah.The Avengers is a solid good-times-turn-your-brain-off-action-fest that is great for escape and is recommended for that reason. As a spoiler warning, if you want just the action parts, start the movie around 30 minutes in.Honest assessment is 3.5 out of 5, but because it's the first movie of its kind and because of all the building up to it that has been going on since 2008, I'll give it a 4.",4,After Four Years--AVENGERS FINALLY ASSEMBLE!,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,5086,"['When', 'Thor', 'mischievous', 'brother',

It took a LONG time for the story to get going, but even when it did I still found it hard to keep watching. There was a lot of bickering, but not much fun or humor, though towards the end there were some fun lines.I didn't like how I couldn't hear what anybody was saying unless I turned up the volume almost all the way, but then any shouting or music or noise was SO LOUD. The story line was dull. I didn't care about any of the fighting. I usually like actions scenes like that, but this time I just kept thinking PLEASE END and get onto something else. Maybe they just went on too long. The fight scene in the forest seemed pointless and ended with them just suddenly back on the ship with the bad guy. How did that happen? Did my video skip over something? Or maybe I missed something because I couldn't hear it. They also talk to each other by speaking into the air. I never saw a microphone or anything. There was too much computer generated stuff so it seemed very cartoony at times. And too much Hollywood physics. (I don't mind either of those things, but this was too much of both.) I really wish the hulk could have been played by a real person though. I never liked computer hulk.

He does so, takes the Cube and bends a number of people to his will in order to play with the Cube so that a portal car be opened to allow the aliens to come in.For some reason, he then goes to Stuttgart to rip out an eye from an individual (apparently it has to be a German eye) to give to an archer that he has converted. An archer, you see, is crucial in the forthcoming battle employing spaceships, jet planes, tanks, and ray guns. At that point, for some reason, he lets himself get captured by Thor and Iron Man. He is taken to an enormous aircraft carrier the size of a small city that nobody in the world knows about or has somehow overlooked. At that point, for some reason, it is decided that the aircraft carrier must go up in the air, at which point, gigantic fans (yes, fans! Why didn't they use gigantic wings) lift it up. Then, while going aimlessly in the air, the now collected Avengers, brought together by a black Nick Fury (who was actually supposed to be white, but we might as well be Politically Correct), for some reason, now become hostile to one another. At this point, mega-archer appears, supposedly with his third eye implanted somewhere (maybe his rear end), and with his bow and ONE ARROW brings down the supercarrier whereupon Loki, who wanted to be captured for some reason, now for some reason, escapes.Shortly thereafter, Loki, having seen the Transformer films, goes on top of a building and has his machine turn on, at which point, the invasion begins. The invasion even has huge transformers leveling buildings (the aliens saw the same movies). The Avengers, for some reason having forgotten their previous hostility, band together and predictably fight off the invasion, helped tremendously by a 98-lb girl with a pop gun in each hand firing at mechanical leviathans.The special effects are standard, in that they are excellent, and that always brings in the crowds. A lot of the bantering between the characters, particularly coming from Iron Man, is great and that makes up a little bit for some of the drawbacks.

1210036,A3OLP2A09TCFU9,B001KVZ6HK,Autumn Witch,"[4, 11]","When I was a pre-teen I picked up my first comic book and I remember thinking to myself, won't it be a great day when these great, escapist stories can be made into films. For the most part until the 90's I was pretty disappointed in the effort. However, going to see the Avengers was like a cathartic moment. It was if all the previous work on comic books films were all a preamble to this film. Don't get me wrong there are some great comic films out there now, like Sin City, Watchmen and many others. But for the most part these films felt like I was watching a film about a comic book instead of a film sprung forth from a comic book. Films and comic books are different media and I think until this film, although it has been close, there has never really been a film like this. This is no longer a comic book film BUT a really good film that just happens to use concepts first created for comic books.And in the same train of thought although this film is not a copy of a comic book, it has almost perfectly held true to the comic book ethos and should not, for the most part, disappoint the hardcore comic book fan. However, one of my few criticisms of the film deals with a difference between how one particular character is portrayed.I am not going to go into the plot of the story as you should go see/buy it for yourself! Just stay watching after ALL the credits. There are TWO bits after the credits.Now below I am just listing a few criticisms of the film, but over all I give it a sold A. It would have been an A+ expect for the following.In the comic books, Thor is clearly a Norse god and is unquestionably Marvel's ""Superman"". Between his own film and this film there seems to be a effort to take him down a few notches. I don't really know why but I have a feeling that somewhere there is an old, childhood prejudice against this character. I am sure somewhere along the line, some power that is, didn't like that Thor was the best of the best and is using his/her influence to knock him down a few pegs. I find it silly and very disappointing because if he was portrayed honestly, it would severely add to not only the escapism but bring a real since of order and justice to counter the Hulk's raw terror.I also was a bit disappointed in the Captain America's line that proclaimed that Thor was not a real god and only the Christian god was. For that reason alone, I can't give this film five stars. There are people out there that still worship the Norse pantheon and making that swipe is no more different than saying the same thing about Allah or Buddha. The only reason this part hasn't received any bad press is that few pagans that still worship Thor (et all)have a really good sense of humour and are very few in numbers. If they picket the film who cares right?Another criticism I had about this film was a wee bit of dialogue by Loki when he was in Berlin. It was just too ""hokey"" and could have been written much better.And my last very, very, very, tiny criticism is that this film was in New York. There should have been at least a mention or shout out to the Fantastic Four. NYC is their stomping ground and by all rights someone at SHIELD should have at least mentioned them. And come on, let's all admit it, wouldn't it have been awesome to see the Hulk turn around and come face to face with The Thing?",4,Great Old Fashioned Summer Blockbuster,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,3338,"['When', 'was', 'pre-teen', 'picked', 'up', 'first', 'comic', 'book', 'remember', 'thinking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'day', 'when', 'great', 'escapist', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'films', 'most', 'part', '90', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'effort', 'However', 'going', 'see', 'Avengers', 'was', 'cathartic', 'moment', 'was', 'previous', 'work', 'comic', 'books', 'films', 'were', 'preamble', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'great', 'comic', 'films', 'there', 'now', 'Sin', 'City', 'Watchmen', 'many', 'others', 'most', 'part', 'films', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'instead', 'film', 'sprung', 'forth', 'comic', 'book', 'Films', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'different', 'media', 'think', 'film', 'been', 'close', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'film', 'no', 'longer', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'BUT', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'just', 'use', 'concepts', 'first', 'created', 'comic', 'books.And', 'same', 'train', 'thought', 'film', 'not', 'copy', 'comic', 'book', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'held', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'ethos', 'should', 'not', 'most', 'part', 'disappoint', 'hardcore', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'However', 'one', 'few', 'criticisms', 'film', 'deals', 'difference', 'how', 'one', 'particular', 'character', 'portrayed.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'plot', 'story', 'should', 'go', 'see/buy', 'Just', 'stay', 'watching', 'credits', 'are', 'TWO', 'bits', 'credits.Now', 'am', 'just', 'listing', 'few', 'criticisms', 'film', 'give', 'sold', 'A', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'A+', 'expect', 'following.In', 'comic', 'books', 'Thor', 'clearly', 'Norse', 'god', 'unquestionably', 'Marvel', 'Superman', 'Between', 'own', 'film', 'film', 'there', 'be', 'effort', 'take', 'down', 'few', 'notches', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'have', 'feeling', 'somewhere', 'old', 'childhood', 'prejudice', 'character', 'am', 'sure', 'somewhere', 'line', 'power', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Thor', 'was', 'best', 'best', 'using', 'influence', 'knock', 'down', 'few', 'pegs', 'find', 'silly', 'very', 'disappointing', 'was', 'portrayed', 'honestly', 'would', 'severely', 'add', 'not', 'only', 'escapism', 'bring', 'real', 'order', 'justice', 'counter', 'Hulk', 'raw', 'terror.I', 'also', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Captain', 'America', 'line', 'proclaimed', 'Thor', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'god', 'only', 'Christian', 'god', 'was', 'reason', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'are', 'people', 'there', 'still', 'worship', 'Norse', 'pantheon', 'making', 'swipe', 'more', 'different', 'saying', 'same', 'thing', 'Allah', 'Buddha', 'only', 'reason', 'part', ""n't"", 'received', 'bad', 'press', 'few', 'pagans', 'still', 'Thor', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'sense', 'humour', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'numbers', 'picket', 'film', 'who', 'right', 'criticism', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'wee', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'Loki', 'when', 'was', 'Berlin', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'hokey', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'much', 'better.And', 'last', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'tiny', 'criticism', 'film', 'was', 'New', 'York', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'mention', 'shout', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'NYC', 'stomping', 'ground', 'rights', 'someone', 'SHIELD', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'mentioned', 'come', 'let', 'admit', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'see', 'Hulk', 'turn', 'around', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'Thing']",Marvel's: The Avengers

1210059,A2CS1VKCLH69CY,B001KVZ6HK,B-DIDDLES,"[0, 0]","I feel as if I got a great deal on this product and shipping was very quick (2 days).  I could not wait to watch this on my plasma TV with my kids.  The video played through with no errors, the quality on my TV was amazing.  The sound, I feel could be better, but this I would blame on my TV (I am looking to add a surround sound system to upgrade the entertainment experience for when we get a chance to experience a movie to wind down).I do not want to play spoiler for this movie if you have not seen it, but I will say that there are a few super-heroes: Black Widow, Hawkeye, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Nick Fury and The Hulk.  Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) was great, I like that she had the look and nailed the moves.  Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner) was pretty good, there were a few really cool parts in this movie that Hawkeye had.  Captain America (played by Chris Evans) Captain is the first Avenger and even if the Captain is overmatched he will not back down and does what he must.  I really liked the humanistic approach of Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America as being more believable in the story because they cannot fly, do not have hulkish strength or able to command thunder.  They brought a sense of reality to the story.Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) was downright AWESOME!  I think Downey is meant to be Iron Man.  He captivated this role; his personality and character are very convincing for this role.  Iron Man is criticized as not being a team player but then.... happens (again do not want to play spoiler).  Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) was pretty cool; I personally think The Avengers could have had more Thor due to who the villain was.  Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) was very cool, as Jackson is cool in what seems to be every other movie in existence do to the amount of movies he is in!  Fury does what has to be done to assemble the Avengers to defend earth.  Lastly, my favorite character was the Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo).  I feel as if Marvel finally got what the audience wants out of the &#34;real Hulk&#34;.  Not to blame Edward Norton, I personally think that he played an aspect of who the Hulk really should be (during last hulk movie) when not angry better.  But unfortunately, it took Marvel up to this point with the Computer Graphics Imaging to get what we really care about down.  In my opinion, the Hulk had the coolest and most awesome moments in the movie!  I cannot wait for another Hulk movie!I do have some points to criticize about this movie- The fact that there are seven Marvel characters (hero&#8217;s) used and only one is female is a little underrepresented by females.  Also, Fury is a Marvel character but does little real fighting or real action, I feel as if the African American hero population is also underrepresented.  In the next film it would be nice to have another female hero and an African American hero.  The end result is entertainment and appeal.  I feel that a super hero should not just appeal to little boys, but little girls too.  I have two little girls and I personally think there is nothing wrong with them wanting to be like a hero that they have seen (goals, great virtues, etc...).Picture quality-5/5Sound quality-3.5/5 *(see above)Story-line- 4.5/5Cast-5/5Super heroes on team-5/5 *(although from my readings the Hulk is not a typical Avenger)Value-5/5 $25 free shipping for Blue-Ray 3D, Blue-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy and Digital Music copy for a newly released movie.Anxiety for Avengers 2-5/5!  lolHope I helped; this movie is now among my top five favorites of all-time now!

The acting, the character design, the plot, the action scenes, and the soundtrack are some of the best I've ever seen for a summer blockbuster. All of the actors sold their characters and made us not only believe that they were who they were portraying, but also showed us why these characters were part of the Avengers in the first place. Loki is a great villain. Mark Ruffalo's take on Bruce Banner turned out to be one of the best decisions Marvel Studios has made with these movies so far. The fights are action-packed, funny, and full of tension and thrills.

What Marvel fans have been waiting for for years, and it all began with the success of Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" and Singer's ""X-Men"", Marvel Studios green lit the Avengers project that started off in 2008 with Iron Man, along with Captain American, Thor, Incredible Hulk and a second Iron Man. This all takes us to this film, which I cannot describe other than a perfect adaptation and feeling of a superGROUP movie. Which is harder to do than a solo film. There is no filler in this, every moment is eyes wide open and moves along at a perfect pace.  It's a perfect translation from comics to film, wonderfully casted and no Avenger is lackluster, everyone shines and all have great screen time, even Sgt.Fury kick arse. Hulk is epic, effects and sound are great. I'll probably see this again.Director Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", ""Firefly"");as well as writing comic books, was the perfect director for this project. His vision was epic.Here's my one word for this movie: AWESTRUCK, or SMASH!!!Can't wait for the blu-ray transfer and watch it several more times.  GO SEE THIS!!!!

Despite the fact the movie received rave reviews and made billions at the box office, I didn't think Joss Whedon could pull off a convincing Avengers movie, regardless of what people thought. There was too many variables there with which, to tie together, to make a good movie without someone getting the short end of the stick on screentime. I figured this movie would be like The Transformers, Battleship or something of the like and have tons of explosions and pointless action sequences, making it not amount to much. Although it did have both, it was never pointless. Whedon actually pulled off a cohesive & convincing Avengers movie. It was, definitely, no Dark Knight movie but it wasn't intended to be. I was quite impressed with it because it turned out to be nothing like I expected The Avengers movie to be. I was given something completely different and I really liked that.I only have two gripes with the movie and they're small gripes. First, the movie started off a bit slow. When I expected it to pick up its' pace a little bit, it just lulled there yet, by the second hour, it started its' gallop into an all-out running up to the end. If I had of blinked, I would've missed some great parts in the movie. Second, I was somewhat disapointed at how they changed everyones' outfits. Especially, Captain America and Thor's outfits.  Change is constant, I know, but why mess with something that-previously- was nearly perfect for them. I really liked the Kevlar look of Cap's previous outfit. Oh well- you can't have everything you want, I guess.Marvel's The Avengers is, without a doubt, a great piece of cinematic history. It makes me wonder, now, just how Warner Brothers plans on pulling off its' Justice League movie. I enjoyed The Avengers movie and really really look forward to next chapter in their ongoing saga.

1210100,A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M,B001KVZ6HK,"Book & Music thief, from HI","[2, 2]","OK - I am finally writing a review of a Marvel film!  After reading a lot of Avengers, Fantastic Four, Iron Man, X-Men, when I was young - I felt this Film version hit all the right notes (pitch perfect) - and made each character memorable, distinctive, and extremely charismatic!Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor already had tremendously successful eponymous films of their own.But the truly inspired full 'Break-out' character introduction in this Avengers movie was of course the 'Black Widow'!!!  She was also featured in Iron Man II, but really came into her own, as a 'vital' and most intriguing & Essential character in this film!  This was an inspired choice, because the Black Widow (former Top Soviet Spy named Natasha Romanoff, later International 'Jet setter' and eventual 'SHIELD' agent) = was actually, in her early comic days, sort of a second-tier character (though popular enough to have a short-lived series in the early Marvel 1970's 'Amazing Adventures' then as 'Daredevil's' beloved side-kick, for about 30+ issues (before Elektra, came on the scene).But it is really Scarlett Johansson's mesmerizing portrayal in this film ==> who completely epitomizes the famous definition of the true/ real Black Widow spider (i.e. the enchanting creature for which the male spider will gladly/ and most willingly sacrifice its own Life, in order to couple with ==> having absolutely no regrets whatsoever, about his fateful decision!) - darn, now I completely Lost my train of thought!Anyway, yes now I remember = the second inspired burst of creativity, was to 're-invent' the characterization of the Hulk ==> Mark Ruffalo finally brings, what has been sadly lacking in the earlier Hulk films:  the 'pathos' in the character of Bruce Banner, of the brilliant, but 'lost'/ bewildered mild-mannered scientist, who knows that he really can't control that raging beast within him (but does his best to 'stay calm' nonetheless) - Ruffalo imbues the character with the perfect mix of uneasiness, even vulnerability against that just-under the surface Explosiveness!  Keeping the audience, constantly on edge, anticipating the next 'transformation' - ingenious!And Tom Hiddleston, makes the character of 'Loki' the epitomy and definition of 'Mischievous' = even in the midst of endless death & destruction, Loki has the  wry, wide-eyed smile/ constant grin of the proverbial 'kid in the Candy store'!Much kudos must also go to writer/Director Joss Whedon, who has a brilliant track record with fantasy/adventure & SciFi entertainment (and even wrote a brilliant 're-imagined' X-Men comics series, to boot!)Even the great (Marvel father) Stan Lee, must have been pleased (beyond his wildest Dreams) - with this truly Epic Film!Speaking as a nearly Life-Long Marvel Comics fan (although I have not kept up with all the modern mythology) - Excelsior!!!PS:  a special THANKS!! to Black Widow, and the rest of Avengers for keeping the Sochi, Russia = Winter Olympic Games Safe, and free from 'incident' (except for that 'slushy' Snow - I guess they forgot to include 'Iceman' from that other Marvel super-team, the Uncanny X-men!)Amazing closing ceremony, by the way - especially Chagall, Chekov, and Mischa the now (apparently) friendly Bear?!  Das-vidanya! and especially:  PEACE be with You, Mr. Bear!!  Or else, we might need to call-in the Silver Surfer, to bring forth some positively 'cosmic' good vibes!!!note especially for comic-book fans: another highlight from the Late 1970's = Black Widow actually became the 'Leader' of her own short-lived Super-team (from Marvel, of course), called the 'Champions' which also featured Hercules, Ghost-Rider, the Angel, and our much needed in 'slushy' Sochi => the 'Iceman'!  It was an  interesting concept (and this team was rather 'offbeat'/diverse), but unfortunately only lasted a mere 17 issues (from 1975-1977) - and featured some great/ early John Byrne artwork!",5,Make mine Marvel Movies = Excelsior x 1000!!!

I would say that it was quite acceptable. We watched it on a 55"" LG with passive 3D. The image was crisp and the 3D added, in my opinion, to the viewing experience over watching a standard Blu ray ... and I think that standard Blu rays normally look pretty good.I doubt I have to fill anyone in about the subject of this movie. It takes several Marvel super-heroes who have all had their own films leading up to this and puts them in one epic package. True to the Marvel taste, for most of the film they do not get along well with each other, but come together when it counts to fight an exhausting and dangerous battle against seemingly impossible odds. But what else are super-heroes supposed to do? LOLThe acting is convincing, and there are quite a few moments of humor to give you a break from the more serious tone of the movie (a defect in the otherwise brilliant movies in the new Batman series).The sound in this presentation is simply outstanding. I don't remember another film which has driven my subwoofer more powerfully or effectively. The rest of the sound comes through powerfully and crisply too.

The Hulk is a great addition to the modern Marvel movie line up.  Captain America makes much more sense as a character now that he is surrounded by much stronger heroes; it is now clear that being brave despite a lack of special powers that makes him the leader. I really disliked his solo movie, so this was a nice surprise.From a technical standpoint, the 3d is great and the sound is amazing.

Great concept, a lot of superheroes, and I wondered how the creators were going to pull this off. They more than pulled it off. I was so impressed, and the movie was excellent!I love to watch movies that takes me away from normal. This movie had the flying worms, the alien armies, all kinds of fight scenes, and mind tricks, and the great part for me is that MOST of it made sense. It wasn't crazy by your pants, lets do anything under the sun.It flowed well and I followed the story easily. The one issue I had was when the hulk first appeared, and he was trying to kill Black Widow after the explosion on the ship. Why try to kill her? I watched the hulk as a kid, and he was always kind towards kids and women. So, for him to go after Black Widow was confusing. Other than that, I had a full understanding of the movie.All of the superheroes were fun to watch. The Hulk was scary sometimes, funny, and amazing [loved how he took down that worm]. I really liked Black Widow. I like a woman who doesn't need a man to save her. Damsel in distress does not exist for this lady. Iron Man was awesome, like always. Hawkeye was sexy! I was cheering for him when he came back to the good side. Captain America seemed a little more dark, more serious, but I enjoyed the character still. And Thor was cool. I dug the lingo that he spoke, and it was a great change to Stark's quick speech and wit. I was even impressed with Fury. He held his own, and he wasn't a slouch. Solid, great characters.So, overall the movie was very good to me. I can see why people loved it so much.

1210116,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B001KVZ6HK,Brian Driver,"[6, 11]","At this writing I have the ""honor"" of being the 100th person to place a review for ""The Avengers,"" an as yet unreleased DVD.  I shall attempt to write with all due aplomb.""The Avengers"" is exactly what escapist movie fiction is supposed to be.  When real life contains as many terrors as Hollywood can dream up we need to laugh and cry and jump and shout at the screen to relieve those tensions.  To refer to this as ""war porn,"" as I saw one reviewer did, is to underestimate the powerful purgative and emotional effect that purely enjoyable movies like this do.This is a clever movie--it begins by introducing the villain, Loki, then two of the least well-known superheroes in the ""Avenger"" stable: Hawkeye and the Black Widow.  Only quick clues about them are given, but they're enough for the movie to progress.  (To tell you the truth I've seen the movie twice and I still don't have any real idea what the Black Widow does.)Regardless, one by one the superheroes and their supporters are brought to light--the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America.  Eventually, all make it to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s home base (and occasionally flying aircraft carrier) the Helicarrier.  It isn't long before they all begin to fight among themselves, and, as we all know from lots of film viewing we're going to need a reason to bind together.  That reason comes in the form of the death of someone very close to the circle of heroes, and unite they do.All of this isn't terribly important...I'm very sure some similar components would have occurred regardless of who wrote the film.  It isn't hard to figure that you have a bunch of superheroes and they all have egos the size of their talents, so you know it would be difficult for them to bind together.Apparently some similar plot was being put together for its original date of release in the summer of 2011.  But various factors required that the movie be pushed back a year, and along came Joss Whedon, who took the script in hand, rewrote it, and became its director.  And thus was birthed this version.For those who don't know, Joss Whedon has put together hit TV shows, yet has had little respect among the powers that be, nor a really successful show in a decade.  Once a writer on Roseanne's TV show, he wrote the original movie ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" then convinced the studio to allow him to re-create it as a television show.  He went on to win an Emmy for writing, and the show lasted five years on two networks.In 2002 Whedon went on to create the cult classic and oft called space western ""Firefly"" which, despite its strong core fan base (nicknamed the Brownshirts), was cancelled after 11 episodes even though they had shot 14.  Later this strong fan base encouraged Universal Studios to wrap up the series in a two-hour movie called ""Serenity,"" which again underwhelmed...despite the Browncoats.The same went for ""Dollhouse,"" a show that only ran two years...a victim, again, of low ratings.  Other than a couple of fan favorites like ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,"" a short starring Neil Patrick Harris shot during the writers' strike, Joss Whedon had done little else that wowed anyone.  How he was able to land the directing post of ""The Avengers"" I simply don't know, but thank God he did.For instance, talk to anyone who enjoyed this film and ask them their favorite scene, and you'll be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't tell you right off the bat it's one that involves humor...and, not coincidentally, the Hulk, whom I'll get to later.  And that, in a nutshell, is what Joss Whedon brought to this movie.Whedon's humor is ever present in his work, whether it is billed as a drama or not, and it is this humor that is at the heart of ""The Avengers.""  It is through Whedon's jaundiced eye that we see these six superheroes interact, and it is through him that the story gains its humanity.  Think of it: the very fact that such oversized and super-powerful beings exist, even with the blessing of Hollywood, is funny.  And that they must CO-exist for any of this to work...well, that's hilarious.And it is this that lies at the heart of this extremely entertaining movie: what characterization that exists does so not to make our heroes SUPER, but HUMAN.  It is Whedon's genius to set his eye upon the all-too-normal traits that lie at the heart of all of us: vanity, pride, fear of failure, competitiveness, and even the desire to erase that part of us that we wish others not to see.  It is not that the characters can fly that wows us; it is that even he (or she) fears falling.I have heard some minor complaints about the drag at the middle of the film, when our heroes are weakest, when they fight among themselves. But I think it is this scene that makes the movie believable...that speaks to a deeper dread.  The crisis in this movie began when we sought to make bigger weapons, and making bigger weapons drew the eyes of bigger enemies.  If one thinks of it, the worst criminals never show up until there is a superhero worthy of them: there was no madman named Joker until there was Batman, no evil Lex Luthor until Superman.On a more well, human, scale, perhaps the greatest beneficiary of Whedon's careful eye is the Incredible Hulk, who has been regarded far too seriously in each of his two big movie outings thus far.  As portrayed by both Ed Norton and Eric Bana--and, hey, even going back to Bill Bixby's TV Hulk--the Big Guy has just been too serious.  It is only under Whedon's watch that he has blossomed, and in such a way as to provide many of the movie's best moments.  We even get to hear ""Hulk, SMASH!"" and it is so good to hear the audience laughing ALONG with the character rather than AT him.But as long as we're on the subject, some credit must go to Mark Ruffalo, who has humanized the Hulk as well with his gentle but knowing performance as the Hulk's better half, Dr. Bruce Banner.  His dark, rumpled face is perfect for the man whose monster lies within, a man who knows all too well what it is to walk around with a terrible secret.Who cares if the movie goes a little awry in the end, having politicians decry our heroes for the damage caused to the city?  (And who else is getting tired of EVERY movie that depicts NYC as the perennial victim?)  Not when we've had such a wonderful joyride getting there.This movie is a pleasure from start to finish, Speaking of which, stick around for the credits, and a little beyond.  There are two little fun snippets of film left as Easter Eggs for the fans who care enough to stick around.",5,What can I say?

The Dark Knight, the first Iron Man, the 1978 Superman and perhaps even the 1989 Batman are all arguably superior films. . .but with that said, this is still a highly entertaining film.Predictably, Robert Downey Jr. steals virtually every scene he is in.  The guy has blossomed into an amazing actor and, while the cast as a whole is very capable, he tends to dwarf their performances. . .with one exception. . .Mark Ruffalo.  I am a fan of Edward Norton's work and was disappointed when his contract to play Marvel's green behemoth (probably my favorite superhero when I was growing up), fell apart.  However, it worked out for the best, I think, in terms of fans of this genre.  Ruffalo is simply a superb Bruce Banner - in one film arguably becoming as definitive as Bill Bixby was for the hokey 1970s TV series.  This film is worth seeing for his perfomrance alone. . .throw in the rest of the cast and you have quite an engaging mix!The film is loaded with CGI, but we've reached the technological point in filmmaking where that really doesn't matter anymore.  It all looks very good, even during the very challenging and difficult to execute scenes during the climax.  I'm not, I'm afraid, much of a fan of the Thor storyline nor its cast of characters, so when I realized Loki was going to be the principle villain, I was disappointed, but again - it is incorporated well. . .and that's not really the focus of the film anyway.

So, it is surely a good thing if I give a movie such as this a four-star rating.The first half hour seems to move at a snail's pace, and I was thinking, ""This is really going to be a disappointment.""  I believe that Samuel L. Jackson is heavily featured in that timeframe, and I am still not much of a fan of his for ripping A. O. Scott.  Personally, I think that Mr. Jackson was off-base at best and unwise at worst.  ""Hey, Mr. Scott didn't like your film.  Who cares?"" would be my rebuttal.  So yes, I am a little biased against Mr. Jackson because of this.  (I've always thought that Mr. Jackson is somewhat overrated as well.  Decent actor but surely not in the ""great"" category.  But it could be argued that Mr. Scott may be the best film critic out there.)But then, Robert Downey Jr. enters the picture.  Ah, you know the film will be fun then, and it is.  He is not only a very good actor - perhaps excellent at times (watch ""Chaplin"" if you disagree with me, one of the best performances ever), but he's also very funny.  And then Mark Ruffalo adds to the fun.  I really liked his work in ""Zodiac"" and he does, in my opinion, the best Hulk ever.  And it's not even close.This film seems to be about sticking together as a team, and having a leader who's willing to lead and followers who are willing to follow.  Sometimes, if you have the right team, you can do some pretty amazing things.  Should be a film for Fortune 500 companies to watch, and try to remember what it was like when people - and companies - actually cared about doing great work.  Well, good luck with that now in the US.  Even Captain America may not be able to save you.Pretty big recommendation by me.  If you're not a fan of the genre, just wait until the second act and you might become a fan.",4,Robert Downey Jr. Saves the Day - and the film,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1974,"['really', 'Iron', 'Man', 'franchise', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'genre', 'se', 'tried', 'watch', 'Thor', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressed', 'Hulk', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'times', 'more', 'dismal', 'So', 'surely', 'good', 'thing', 'give', 'movie', 'such', 'four-star', 'rating.The', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'move', 'snail', 'pace', 'was', 'thinking', 'really', 'going', 'be', 'disappointment', 'believe', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'heavily', 'featured', 'timeframe', 'am', 'still', 'not', 'much', 'fan', 'ripping', 'A.', 'O.', 'Scott', 'Personally', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Jackson', 'was', 'off-base', 'best', 'unwise', 'worst', 'Hey', 'Mr.', 'Scott', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'Who', 'would', 'be', 'rebuttal', 'So', 'yes', 'am', 'little', 'biased', 'Mr.', 'Jackson', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Mr.', 'Jackson', 'somewhat', 'overrated', 'as', 'well', 'Decent', 'actor', 'surely', 'not', 'great', 'category', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'Mr.', 'Scott', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'critic', 'there', 'then', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'picture', 'Ah', 'know', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'fun', 'then', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'perhaps', 'excellent', 'times', 'watch', 'Chaplin', 'disagree', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'then', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'fun', 'really', 'liked', 'work', 'Zodiac', 'opinion', 'best', 'Hulk', 'ever', 'not', 'even', 'close.This', 'film', 'be', 'sticking', 'together', 'team', 'having', 'leader', 'who', 'willing', 'lead', 'followers', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'follow', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'right', 'team', 'can', 'do', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'things', 'Should', 'be', 'film', 'Fortune', '500', 'companies', 'watch', 'try', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'people', 'companies', 'actually', 'cared', 'doing', 'great', 'work', 'Well', 'good', 'luck', 'now', 'US', 'Even', 'Captain', 'America', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'you.Pretty', 'big', 'recommendation', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'genre', 'just', 'wait', 'second', 'act', 'might', 'become', 'fan']",Marvel's: The Avengers

For some reason I wanted to see something about this the other day, and found that I could watch it for free now as a Prime bennie. So I did last night, and I was blown away. I didn't know Joss Whedon wrote and directed this, or I would have paid better attention the first time. That was a brilliant move, he's the best there is. Of course the acting was excellent, and I really appreciated the characters' interactions with each other. The tension was palpable, and believeable. It set up the climax perfectly. One thing that was incongruous was the flying aircraft carrier. Still don't get why Fury would want something like that, no benefit and (obviously) many risks.The key to this film's greatness is that it relies the most on the interactions of the characters rather than the battles. And the key to the interactions is the brilliant casting, which of course was taken care of far in advance by Marvel when they assigned these folks to their separate movies before this payoff blockbuster. But again, with anyone but Whedon at the helm, it may not have been this great.Now I see there is a sequel in the works, might even be done filming by this time.

Now all I can say is that I wish I could go back and see it for the first time all over again. This film sprung me into a new world of comic books and all that Marvel has to offer, and I love it.But more about the actual movie: Joss Whedon's direction was magnificent in every way. He really captured that Marvel film quality that all the previous movies had with that enticing combination of witty one-liners and bold action that you just won't see anywhere else. All of the characters really meshed together in a funny, shaky start that lead up to a fantastic blend of amazing heroes in the end. All of the actors did a phenomenal job in grasping their characters and taking them deeper than just what you saw. And might I say, Mark Ruffalo did a great job as Bruce Banner. He played the part of the closed off and awkward scientist well.If you didn't see this in theaters, you missed out. Not only was the film amazing on the big screen, but the audience  full of die-hards made it a real experience. I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh, action, and and just plain fun. There also wasn't much language, which I thought was great for the younger audiences who will undoubtedly see this game changer if they haven't already.",5,Most Fun I've Ever had at the Movies!,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,1547,"['be', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'having', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'movie', 'eight', 'times', 'theaters', ""'m"", 'literally', 'counting', 'down', 'hours', 'can', 'snag', 'DVD', 'Having', 'seen', 'previous', 'films', 'leading', 'up', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'expectations', 'wer', 'extremely', 'high', 'Now', 'can', 'say', 'wish', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'over', 'again', 'film', 'sprung', 'new', 'world', 'comic', 'books', 'Marvel', 'offer', 'love', 'it.But', 'more', 'actual', 'movie', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'direction', 'was', 'magnificent', 'way', 'really', 'captured', 'Marvel', 'film', 'quality', 'previous', 'movies', 'had', 'enticing', 'combination', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'bold', 'action', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anywhere', 'else', 'characters', 'really', 'meshed', 'together', 'funny', 'shaky', 'start', 'lead', 'up', 'fantastic', 'blend', 'amazing', 'heroes', 'end', 'actors', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'grasping', 'characters', 'taking', 'deeper', 'just', 'what', 'saw', 'might', 'say', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'played', 'part', 'closed', 'off', 'awkward', 'scientist', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'theaters', 'missed', 'out', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'film', 'amazing', 'big', 'screen', 'audience', 'full', 'die-hards', 'made', 'real', 'experience', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'laugh', 'action', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'language', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'younger', 'audiences', 'who', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'see', 'game', 'changer', 'have', ""n't"", 'already']",Marvel's: The Avengers

I could follow along since I'd seen most of the individual hero movies, but if you have not yet seen Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, etc...you will be scratching your head. This is a movie for comic fans only.Anyway, these random B-list superheroes come together to battle an alien invasion. A basic enough premise, but there was a lot of forced elements. The heroes all disliked each other for no particular reason. When they become a ""team"", it falls flat, because there isn't really any conflict between any of them. The selection of ""Avengers"" seems random. The Hulk, who inexplicably halfway through the movie can suddenly control his beast mode. Iron Man and Captain America, who seem reasonably paired. Thor (um, who?) who at least has a connection to the bad guy. And some guy and girl who can shoot arrows well and do a good round kick. Those two should have reasonably died within the first 5 minutes of the battle. If the hammer wielding God, an invincible giant monster, and a super robot suit that flies and shoots lasers is having a hard time with the alien invaders, I doubt a guy with 20 grenade tipped arrows and a girl with a 9mm is going to put up much of a fight.One of the ""agents"" is killed by the antagonist, and they all seem to be very upset about it, although the movie never establishes why this person is important to any of them.

1210219,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B001KVZ6HK,Chris Kennison,"[3, 7]","""The Avengers"" has been a movie in the works for a long time, merging four superhero movies into one. First of all, you have Robert Downey Jr. who brought Iron Man to life with two films, the second had some major scripting problems in my opinion. Then you have Chris Evans reprising his role as Captain America, a movie that had its moments, but was plagued with too many montages in the middle of the movie and a villain that was never fleshed out. Mark Ruffalo stepped in to play the Hulk and Chris Hemsworth (Cabin in the Woods, Snow White and the Huntsmen) returns as Thor, after his movie was much better than many expected.I love the big blockbuster movie just like anybody else, but over the past few years, I've been extremely disappointed with many of the offerings. Most of that was because too many directors (Bay, Wiseman & Anderson) and studios treat their audiences as if they only want explosions and gunfire to be satisfied with their purchase of a movie ticket. Many of the sequels, like ""Iron Man 2"" seemed to misplace all the money they made from the first ""Iron Man"" movie and gave us little to no action, more specifically a scene in the beginning and a grand finale. Finally, many of the superhero movies included too many characters instead of fleshing out just one and writing a good script. Three of the four original ""Batman"" series are included in this along with ""Spiderman 3"", which was just awful.Keeping that in mind, ""The Avengers"" on the surface, looks like it could quite possibly meet all of the above criteria for a bad superhero movie, but that just isn't the case. The trailer is a collage of special effects and explosive action. The movie is full of characters like the ones I listed above as well as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury and two other superheroes who didn't get their own movie, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Yet, much credit needs to be given to writer/director Joss Whedon (Cabin in the Woods, Buffy the Vampire Slayer) who managed to keep a lot of things in check and despite never being handed anything this big, delivered a spectacular superhero movie and the best movie so far this year.The movie certainly isn't perfect. I've wished for a long time that superhero movies could deliver an emotion connection like Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" did in 2008, but that movie continues to be the exception. Although what you did get is time at the movie theatre well worth your money. The script is well written and the action isn't sparse. The movie is frequently funny and surprising. There are times in the middle of the film that are very slow but it all comes together with well-timed events and an ending that is exactly what you expect from a band of superheroes that includes the Hulk, defending the earth from destruction.",4,"Not without flaws, but the best SUPERHERO film (other than Dark Knight)",1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,2819,"['Avengers', 'been', 'movie', 'works', 'long', 'time', 'merging', 'four', 'superhero', 'movies', 'one', 'First', 'all', 'have', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'brought', 'Iron', 'Man', 'life', 'two', 'films', 'second', 'had', 'major', 'scripting', 'problems', 'opinion', 'Then', 'have', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'reprising', 'role', 'Captain', 'America', 'movie', 'had', 'moments', 'was', 'plagued', 'too', 'many', 'montages', 'middle', 'movie', 'villain', 'was', 'never', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'stepped', 'play', 'Hulk', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsmen', 'Thor', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'many', 'expected.I', 'love', 'big', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'just', 'anybody', 'else', 'past', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'many', 'offerings', 'Most', 'was', 'because', 'too', 'many', 'directors', 'Bay', 'Wiseman', 'Anderson', 'studios', 'treat', 'audiences', 'only', 'want', 'explosions', 'gunfire', 'be', 'satisfied', 'purchase', 'movie', 'ticket', 'Many', 'sequels', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'seemed', 'misplace', 'money', 'made', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'gave', 'little', 'action', 'more', 'specifically', 'scene', 'beginning', 'grand', 'finale', 'Finally', 'many', 'superhero', 'movies', 'included', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'instead', 'fleshing', 'out', 'just', 'one', 'writing', 'good', 'script', 'Three', 'four', 'original', 'Batman', 'series', 'are', 'included', 'Spiderman', '3', 'was', 'just', 'awful.Keeping', 'mind', 'Avengers', 'surface', 'could', 'quite', 'possibly', 'meet', 'above', 'criteria', 'bad', 'superhero', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'case', 'trailer', 'collage', 'special', 'effects', 'explosive', 'action', 'movie', 'full', 'characters', 'ones', 'listed', 'above', 'as', 'well', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'two', 'other', 'superheroes', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'own', 'movie', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Hawkeye', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'much', 'credit', 'needs', 'be', 'given', 'writer/director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'who', 'managed', 'keep', 'lot', 'things', 'check', 'never', 'being', 'handed', 'anything', 'big', 'delivered', 'spectacular', 'superhero', 'movie', 'best', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'year.The', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'perfect', ""'ve"", 'wished', 'long', 'time', 'superhero', 'movies', 'could', 'deliver', 'emotion', 'connection', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'did', '2008', 'movie', 'be', 'exception', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'time', 'movie', 'theatre', 'well', 'money', 'script', 'well', 'written', 'action', ""n't"", 'sparse', 'movie', 'frequently', 'funny', 'surprising', 'are', 'times', 'middle', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'slow', 'together', 'well-timed', 'events', 'ending', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'band', 'superheroes', 'Hulk', 'defending', 'earth', 'destruction']",Marvel's: The Avengers

With Joss Whedon directing the whole story line went up a notch and if and when there is another Thor, Iron Man and Captain America it will be great! Similar to Batman the Dark Night with Christian Bale, all it takes is the right stars and directing and the Dark Knight sequel has improved the whole Batman series a thousand times.

1210278,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B001KVZ6HK,C. Sawin,"[3, 6]","What a ridiculous year for movies 2012 has already been and we still have eight months of it left to look forward to. Just look at some of this year's big releases: a new Pixar film with a female lead, Christopher Nolan's final trip to Gotham City, Ridley Scott's return to the sci-fi genre, Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth, and reboots of our friendly neighborhood web slinger and one of the better Philip K. Dick adaptations. And that's just scratching the surface.Marvel has had something up their sleeve for quite some time though. A gargantuan superhero project they've been teasing since 2008 in five different movies that fan boys and comic book geeks have been foaming at the mouth for featuring one of the most star-studded casts the likes of any movie has ever seen before. That's right, boys and girls; The Avengers is finally upon us.I was riding high on everything Joss Whedon since I'm still feeling the after-effects of the jaw-dropping greatness that is The Cabin in the Woods. However, I refused to get excited for The Avengers. I had doubts that mostly resided in every character getting the appropriate amount of screen time. That and every ounce of anticipation in my body is currently invested in both Prometheus and The Dark Knight Rises. The Avengers wasted little time taking full advantage of that.The movie is explosive right from the very first scene and throughout its entirety. The special effects are incredible. With its rather massive budget ($220 million, a number they nearly made back in international ticket sales alone before it even had the chance to hit the states), it's fantastic to see that they've spared no expense making The Avengers look and sound absolutely phenomenal. The technology used in the film is insane, as well. The tesseract and everything otherworldly will probably be the first thing that comes to mind, but SHIELD has some really amazing devices as does Tony Stark. All of it is just dripping with style.You couldn't ask for better performances from the cast. The Avengers thrives on these clashing personalities and you can't help but get sucked into it. Much of the action is these well-known superheroes fighting amongst themselves and beating the snot out of each other in the process. These are some of the best scenes in the movie, especially when Thor (Chris Hemsworth) first shows up. It's only topped by when Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) first turns into The Hulk.I'm not the biggest Hulk fan, although I did enjoy The Incredible Hulk from 2008. I can say with confidence that he has never been this glorious. He is arguably the highlight of The Avengers. He does some pretty innovative things with the destruction he leaves behind and one scene in particular that he shares with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) will leave you with the urge to stand up and cheer.Everybody is going to be drawn to somebody different in the action packed extravaganza. Aside from The Hulk, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is freaking great. He steals nearly every scene he's a part of by basically just being himself and everything that comes out of his mouth is hilarious. Joss Whedon is able to squeeze in these little bits of humor when you're least expecting it that helps makes things endlessly entertaining at all times. Like the guy playing Galaga, Captain America trying to convince two cops to give him a perimeter, or Thor mentioning Loki was adopted. Tom Hiddleston continues to be impressive, as well. I thought he did a fine job in Thor, but upped his game in The Deep Blue Sea. His return to the Loki character is almost majestic in this evil super villain sense. Loki is downright ferocious at times. His scene with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is magnificently menacing.It is downright ridiculous that a superhero movie is not only this good, but is pretty much already in the books. The summer movie season has officially started and it feels like nothing will ever be able to measure up to this. That means that this year is going to be downright marvelous for movies or studios are going to pull the trigger a little too early. The truth is that you can't scream enough praise for this movie. Its two hours and twenty minute runtime goes by in the blink of an eye, its cast is astounding, its special effects are beautiful, and there are a few really dynamic camera angles thrown in for good measure. The Avengers is easily the best and most action packed movie in Marvel's arsenal.Be sure you stay through the credits; ALL the way through the credits. There are a few surprises to enjoy hidden in there. Earth's mightiest heroes have been given the exceptional treatment they truly deserve that will demand repeat viewings. All that's really left to be said is that The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man certainly have their work cut out for them.",5,Marvelous,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,4828,"['What',

1210284,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B001KVZ6HK,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[4, 8]","In the 1960s, Marvel Comics pioneered mature storylines for its super heroes, of whom many have been successfully adapted into blockbuster films (Spiderman).  The Avengers were a group with individual icons like Iron Man who had already established identities contrary to The Fantastic Four and X Men.  Marvel began to feature stand alone films that methodically built this core of characters, and several years later, it has culminated in The Avengers, a thoroughly entertaining adventure that never fails to engage and `marvel' its intended audience.  As orchestrated by versatile writer/director and comic book fan Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), the results set a high standard in filmic super heroics; it's nirvana, a comic lover's dream come true.The Tesseract is a cube with unknown powers and coveted by the fiendish Loki, Thor's half brother.  Kept for study by SHIELD, the elite security agency, (and once possessed by The Red Skull in Captain America: The First Avenger), the cube can open a doorway to another dimension.  When Loki steals the cube to unleash a demon army and conquer the earth, the SHIELD agents are no match for his supernatural powers.  What to do?  Who ya gonna call?Well, there's nothing like `puttin' the band together' for the first time.  Assembled by SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and aided by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), the Avengers Initiative sought to collect special operatives in the event of an insurmountable threat that was beyond human response.  These Avengers comprise of six extraordinary individuals: an otherworldly warrior, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a genetically enhanced superhuman from the past, Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans), a meek scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and his anger induced, gamma radiated monster, The Hulk; inventor Tony Stark, in super armor as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and two SHIELD agents, master archer Hawkeye, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and top assassin Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson).When Loki's legion of soldiers descend on Manhattan, it's `Avengers Assemble' time.  Drawn by remarkable circumstances and led by Captain America, it's teamwork at its finest as The Avengers battle these nasty hordes to save the earth.After initially bickering and fighting each other, it is fascinating to witness such disparate personalities coalesce into a fighting unit as they flow from self to selflessness.  This film can stand on its own for newbies not familiar with the previous films, but it certainly does not hurt to have seen Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk.  Whedon and company neatly tie the threads of those films together with sufficient focus given to each hero's personal life.We learn some interesting background on Romanoff and Barton, who you think would be outmatched by their superhuman colleagues, but they more than hold their own and figure prominently in the explosive climax.  Rogers, the honorable, idyllic soldier, has to adjust to a world like a modern day Rip Van Winkle.  Dr. Banner keeps his anger at bay, but what will that mean for the Avengers if it can't be controlled?  Whedon also cleverly includes familiar supporting characters e.g. Stark's assistant, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow), from other the films.All the stars perform ably including Tom Hiddleston who is appropriately devious as Loki.  Downey, who clearly improvised much of his dialogue, has a rousing, good time. Jackson embodies Fury as the manipulative leader who does whatever it takes to safeguard humanity.This is the third movie version of The Hulk, and while Ruffalo does a very good job as the sensitive and haunted Banner, his alter ego beast actually behaves so unpredictably that some of his actions become comedic and the results are a riot.  To say more would spoil some hilarious moments.  The filmmakers got this Hulk right.A couple things don't quite add up like how does The Hulk decide to be a do-gooder at a critical moment?  Who is the mysterious Council (resembling the Syndicate from The X Files) that SHIELD answers to, and what are their intentions?  There are, however, nice touches like the Stark building in the finale and what is left of its logo as an obvious tribute to the Avengers.  When the grand showdown is imminent, there is a marvelous circular shot of the Avengers that is iconic.When the evil army attacks, one is reminded of Ghostbusters and the apocalyptic scenes of Superman II and any Transformers film.  Whedon, though, never forgets to include intimate moments and details.  Although each Avenger gets a heroic moment to shine, the film never loses sight of personal loss amid the spectacle.  The film is also about self sacrifice, and people do perish in this film including a major character.Despite a 143 minute running time, the film is full of subplots and well-paced action, and every bit of the enormous, effects laden budget is on the big screen. The Avengers is perhaps not the best super hero film ever made, The Dark Knight being the apex, but it is the most complete, entertaining, multi-hero film to date.  The question now is what do you do for an encore, and how can anyone hope to top let alone match this achievement?  It would require the abilities of a James Cameron or Peter Jackson, or maybe studio executives can plead for Whedon's return.  Let's hope so. (Do stay for the end credits for a double dose treat.)",4,Whedon Assembles a Mighty AVENGERS,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,5461,"['1960s', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'pioneered', 'mature', 'storylines',

Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives at one of his agency's facilities during an evacuation. The Tesseract, an energy source of unknown potential, has activated. It opens a portal through space and the exiled Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steps through. Loki takes the Tesseract and also takes control of the minds of several SHIELD personnel, including Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgrd) and Agent Clint ""Hawkeye"" Barton (Jeremy Renner), to aid him in his getaway. As SHIELD personnel pull out of their base, some pursuing Loki and others merely fleeing, the ground beneath the base collapses and it's destroyed. In response to the attack, Fury re-activates the Avengers Initiative. First he pulls Agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), a.k.a. the Black Widow, out of an interrogation (tied to a chair, she seems to be the victim rather than the interrogator, but appearances are deceiving). Fury sends her to India to find and recruit Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), a.k.a. the Hulk. At the same time Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) approaches ""Iron Man"" Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and requests that he review Dr. Selvig's research. Fury himself approaches Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a.k.a. Captain America, with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract from Loki. During his exile, Loki encountered the Chitauri, an alien race seeking to conquer the galaxy. In exchange for the Tesseract, the Chitauri agree to help Loki subjugate Earth. Suiting up, Captain America and Iron Man travel to Germany to apprehend Loki, who is recovering iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power, and demanding that the civilians kneel before him. Loki quickly surrenders when the two heroes arrive, and he is escorted to a SHIELD helicarrier, a high-tech, flying aircraft carrier. However, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Loki's half-brother and the Norse God of thunder, arrives and attempts to free Loki so he can reason with him on his own, but he gets into a fight with Iron Man and Captain America. The fight ends in a stalemate. Eventually, Loki is taken to the helicarrier and placed in a glass cell designed to hold the Hulk. Fury explains that if Loki attempts to escape, even by merely cracking the glass, a shaft will open below him and he'll plummet to Earth and possibly be killed. The Avengers, now brought together, argue and deliberate over how to approach Loki and the revelation that SHIELD plans to harness the Tesseract's power to develop weapons, a discovery made by Rogers. Fury admits that the events in New Mexico a year before (recounted in ""Thor"") made SHIELD aware of other races on other worlds, some of whom may see Earth as an easy target. The decision was made to produce weapons with the Tesseract as a means of deterrence. As the group argues, Clint Barton and Loki's possessed agents attack the helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight. While Stark and Rogers attempt to restart the damaged engine, Romanoff tries to prevent Dr. Banner from turning into the Hulk and destroying the ship from inside. Her attempt fails and she's chased through the ship until Thor takes up the battle to pacify the beast and manages to fell him briefly with a hit from his hammer, Mjolnir. While fighting Barton, Romanoff slams him into a guard rail, and the blow to the head breaks Loki's mind control. After the Hulk falls from the ship, Thor is tricked into Loki's holding cell by Loki himself, who has recovered his scepter and releases the cell and allows Thor to plummet. Loki is held at bay briefly by Agent Coulson who is also tricked by one of Loki's holographic projections - Coulson is stabbed in the back by the real Loki. Coulson later shoots Loki with a blast from an unidentified weapon, one that harnesses the power of the Destroyer. Coulson dies while Fury tries to save his life. Thor escapes from the cell a split second before it hits the ground. Banner wakes up in his human form after crashing into an abandoned factory. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers to work as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that simply defeating them will not be enough for Loki. He needs to overpower them in a very public way so as to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Using a device built by Dr. Selvig, Loki opens a portal to the Chitauri home world over Manhattan, summoning a Chitauri invasion. The Avengers rally in defense of New York, but quickly come to the conclusion that they will be overwhelmed as wave after wave of Chitauri descend upon Earth. With help from the reformed Barton, Captain America and Thor evacuate civilians while Dr. Banner transforms into the Hulk and goes after Loki, beating him into submission in Tony Stark's penthouse. Romanoff makes her way, with a little help from the Chitauri, to the device that holds the portal open (conveniently located on the roof of the Stark Building) and hits Dr. Selvig over the head, freeing him of Loki's control. Dr. Selvig reveals that Loki's staff can be used to close the portal. Meanwhile, the council overrides Fury and scrambles a jet that fires a nuclear missile at Manhattan to end the invasion. Iron Man intercepts the missile and directs it at the portal and the Chitauri base before running out of oxygen and plummeting back to Earth, but the Hulk catches him as he falls. A dazed Stark, awakened by the Hulk's roar, offers to take the team out for shawarma, but they decide to apprehend Loki first. Thor escorts Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard, while Fury notes that the Avengers will go their separate ways until a new world-threatening menace emerges. In a mid-credits scene, the Chitauri leader the Other tells his master that it is futile to attack Earth, as fighting the Avengers is like courting death. His master turns, revealing himself to be Thanos. After further credits, the Avengers are shown eating together in a shawarma joint; the team looks worn out and no one speaks.",5,Awesome,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,6523,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really',

1210294,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B001KVZ6HK,DanD,"[2, 3]","It's been called the greatest superhero movie of all time.  Whether you believe the hype or not, you have to admit: there is something undeniably charming about THE AVENGERS.  In the hands of writer/director Joss Whedon, this film is a rollicking good time--not serious in the sense of Chris Nolan's Batman films, yet not campy like the Joel Schumacher Batman films.  Fans of Whedon's work will immediately know what to expect: nonstop action blended with a strong (and quick) sense of humor, under-laced with nuanced character development.The film pits some of our earlier favorites--Downey Jr.s' Ironman, Helmsworth's Thor, Evans's Captain America--against Loki.  This isn't the Lokia from THOR, however; here, Tom Hiddleston's villain is transformed into, simply, a bad***.  He kicks butt and doesn't bother with names.  Oh yeah, and he's bringing an invading interdimensional army of nasties.  Can our crew, rallied by Samuel L. Jackson's stalwart Nick Fury, stand up to the onslaught?Of course they can.  There's no doubt about that, ever.  This is an utterly optimistic film--and therein lies its charm.  Don't get me wrong--I'm a Nolan fan, I love his Batman films, their flaws and all.  But there's a lot to be said about a film that revels in the utter majesty of the superhero, with a childlike wonder: these guys can do no wrong.  And they don't.  This is a fun, quick, fanciful film in the grand tradition, anchored by a superb script (Whedon's known for that, in case you weren't aware) and stellar acting.  Rejoining us are Scarlett Johannson (with a lot more to do than in IRON MAN 2, where she was basically eye candy); Clark Gregg (wholly ingrained in this universe as Agent Coulson); Gwyneth Paltrow, Stellan Skarsgaard, and others.  THE AVENGERS welcomes Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Cobie Smulders as Agent Hiller, and particularly Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk.  Some of the film's most memorable scenes revolve around the latter character, and his innate desire for destruction vs. his inner conflict (Ruffalo is partially responsible for the former and entirely responsible for the latter, and perhaps deserves an Oscar nom, though he won't get one).Here is the true strength of THE AVENGERS, aside from its pure joy factor: not one single character/actor carries the show.  You may think that, with a superstar like Robert Downey Jr. onboard, that he film will follow Ironman and the others will be supporting roles.  Not so.  This is an ensemble film, plain and simple.  Ironman, Loki, and the Hulk may have some of the more memorable scenes, but this film belongs to the entire cast and crew.  It is, indeed, a film in which everyone contributes--and the end product shows the effort.  Whether or not you believe THE AVENGERS is the best superhero movie yet made (personally, I don't, but that's one man's opinion), you cannot deny that it is certainly among the top tier.  It is delightful, hilarious, thrilling, and plainly fun.  You can ask for more, yes, but you probably won't get it.  THE AVENGERS delivers.  Plain and simple.",5,Good old fashioned fun.,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,3063,"['been', 'called', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'movie', 'time', 'believe', 'hype', 'not', 'have', 'admit', 'something', 'undeniably', 'charming', 'THE', 'AVENGERS', 'hands', 'writer/director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'film', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'not', 'serious', 'sense', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'films', 'yet', 'not', 'campy', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Batman', 'films', 'Fans', 'Whedon', 'work', 'will', 'immediately', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'nonstop', 'action', 'blended', 'strong', 'quick', 'sense', 'humor', 'under-laced', 'nuanced', 'character', 'development.The', 'film', 'earlier', 'favorites', 'Downey', 'Jr.s', 'Ironman', 'Helmsworth', 'Thor', 'Evans', 'Captain', 'America', 'Loki', ""n't"", 'Lokia', 'THOR', 'however', 'here', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'villain', 'transformed', 'simply', 'bad***', 'butt', ""n't"", 'bother', 'names', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'bringing', 'invading', 'interdimensional', 'army', 'nasties', 'Can', 'crew', 'rallied', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'stalwart', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'stand', 'up', 'onslaught', 'course', 'can', 'doubt', 'ever', 'utterly', 'optimistic', 'film', 'therein', 'charm', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'Nolan', 'fan', 'love', 'Batman', 'films', 'flaws', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'utter', 'majesty', 'superhero', 'childlike', 'wonder', 'guys', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'fun', 'quick', 'fanciful', 'film', 'grand', 'tradition', 'anchored', 'superb', 'script', 'Whedon', 'known', 'case', 'were', ""n't"", 'aware', 'stellar', 'acting', 'Rejoining', 'are', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'lot', 'more', 'do', 'IRON', 'MAN', '2', 'where', 'was', 'basically', 'eye', 'candy', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'wholly', 'ingrained', 'universe', 'Agent', 'Coulson', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgaard', 'others', 'AVENGERS', 'welcomes', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Hawkeye', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'Agent', 'Hiller', 'particularly', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Bruce', 'Banner/The', 'Hulk', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'revolve', 'latter', 'character', 'innate', 'desire', 'destruction', 'vs.', 'inner', 'conflict', 'Ruffalo', 'partially', 'responsible', 'former', 'entirely', 'responsible', 'latter', 'perhaps', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'true', 'strength', 'THE', 'AVENGERS', 'aside', 'pure', 'joy', 'factor', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'character/actor', 'show', 'may', 'think', 'superstar', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'onboard', 'film', 'will', 'follow', 'Ironman', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Not', 'so', 'ensemble', 'film', 'plain', 'simple', 'Ironman', 'Loki', 'Hulk', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'indeed', 'film', 'everyone', 'end', 'product', 'effort', 'Whether', 'not', 'believe', 'AVENGERS', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'yet', 'made', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'one', 'man', 'opinion', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'certainly', 'top', 'tier', 'delightful', 'hilarious', 'thrilling', 'plainly', 'fun', 'can', 'ask', 'more', 'yes', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'AVENGERS', 'delivers', 'Plain', 'simple']",Marvel's: The Avengers

1210306,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B001KVZ6HK,Danny G.,"[33, 1170]","Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades - and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something - for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next, Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers! (WANT TO SEE WHAT GOOD FILM MAKING LOOKS LIKE? I'VE PRAISED EVERY ONE OF THESE FILMS WITH A 5-STAR REVIEW:The Informant!andNever Back Down (Single-Disc Edition)andX-Men: First Class (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray] andFarewellandThe Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)and(Father) Damien (de Veuster of Hawaii) [VHS] andBattle For TerraandThe Secret of My SuccessandCommon Ground [VHS])I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, co-worker's wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation!But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes ""wrecked Manhattan."" That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to ""blame"" for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter ""D"" for Democrat next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a ""R"" for Republicans after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic debris that was released into the air!The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time!The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall,  Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-men and the Fanatic Four, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine. No wonder why Stan Lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film! It's just too bad he and the rest of Hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck!For those of you who have never taken a film class in college before: A GOOD FILM HAS AN INTERESTING STORY AND ACTORS THAT INTERACT WELL WITH EACH OTHER! It really is not too hard to imagine! You could even write it on the back of a matchbook cover!See:Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politicsand The State of the American Mind: Stupor and Pathetic Docility: Volume One and City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance, and 9/11 (FT Press Science)and The Toxic Clouds Of 9/11: A Looming Health Disaster and A Teachable Moment: A Facilitator's Guide to Activities for Processing, Debriefing, Reviewing and Reflection and Grow Up!: How Taking Responsibility Can Make You a Happy AdultFootnote 1: By the way, Frosty, The Snowman is a much more entertaining story than The Avengers. It has stood the test of time! Unlike The Avengers, which will be quickly forgotten! But I certainly wouldn't want to watch Frosty for the 10th time!Footnote 2: Why do so many people commenting on my review hate the Fantastic Four? It has zero war porn, has a sense of humor and is totally enjoyable without exploiting anyone!

1210311,A2JLSQGDZZUNG,B001KVZ6HK,Dante1138,"[36, 74]","I enjoyed The Avengers, mostly. It was nice to see all of the Marvel characters get their due onscreen, and only Hawkeye felt short-shrifted by the plot (he's the only one we really know nothing about heading into the film, and we don't actually get ""him"" as a character until the third act). A lot could (and probably should) have gone wrong putting all these larger than life superheroes into one movie, but it is to the credit of writer/director Joss Whedon that, for the most part, the film holds together quite well.That being said, taken on its own, this is a good film, not a great one. With so many characters to re-introduce and have share in the spotlight, there is no true protagonist who's arc we follow. As a result, with the exception of some really good set pieces, the first two thirds of the film can tend to drag. And the final battle, while well-choreographed and filled with really smart, funny moments (Hulk truly shines in this third act) goes on for too long, and has no rise in tension from the start to the finish. The villains in the movie are complete pushovers, and the endless armada that attacks Manhattan is comprised of the same disposable foot soldiers ad nauseum, with none of them posing any kind of threat to any of our heroes. Loki himself was defeated in Thor by the God of Thunder solo, so now with Cap, Hulk, Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. also arrayed against him, it's no surprise that we never worry about the outcome.The whole film in essence feels like a re-introduction to all the characters we've already established in the previous movies, which, obviously, was necessary, and because there's so much set-up involved it's understandable that the plot would be extremely bare-bones and generic so that focus is given to these characters. Joss Whedon is an expert storyteller, and he leaps the hurdles that this project came entrenched with deftly. Honestly, no one could do a better job with the material than the man who turned $39 million and demand from a small rabid fanbase into the best sci-fi film since Aliens (Serenity, go watch it now if you haven't already). The stage is set for an explosively fun Avengers 2.So I expect to get a fair amount of slams for not gushing more over the movie. I did enjoy it (on second viewing I enjoyed it slightly more than the first time) but this is not a film that I, as a big super-hero/fantasy/sci-fi fan, am ever going to go ga-ga over. I think it did what it needed to do, which was effectively set up the franchise that is to follow, and do so with humor and heart. As the prologue to what is to follow, I think it's top notch. As a standalone film, I think it comes in several ticks below the Nolan Batman flicks (that have their own issues) and the Donner Superman films. However, this is sooo much better than any of the recent X-Men or Fantastic Four movies that it shouldn't even be mentioned along side those lame-duck series.I look forward to the next Avengers movie, and hope that Joss Whedon is still at the helm when it comes.",3,The Avengers is a Success!

I was not disappointed.  ""The Avengers"" is the big, action-packed film it needed to be, but it also features sparkling dialogue and the efficient characterization required in such an ensemble piece.  This strength is demonstrated in a scene in which the heroes' differences emerge in a heated debate about tactics and motivations; everyone becomes alarmed over how agitated Bruce Banner is becoming, since they know what may result.  This dialogue-driven sequence stands out even among the various face-offs between heroes and the huge battle at the end.I have loved all the movies out of Marvel Studios because, whatever the individual merits of each film, they have stayed true to the characters.

It's thrilling, it's funny, the special effects look great, and the action feels real (no stiff, overly-armored Batman here!) and it reflects the appeal of comicbooks and comicbook culture better than any other adaptation I've seen.All praise is due to director Joss Whedon, who also co-wrote the script and (miraculously!) kept this from being one of those blechhy, top-heavy, written-by-Hollywood-committee monoliths that we've seen so far. The exposition is kept to a minimum, the lulls are lightened by classic Whedon humor, and the actors are treated like actors, not sort sort of squishy furniture you drape special effects around. Whedon, a guy that actors love, coaxes superior performances from Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlet Johansson, while Chris Evans' and Chris Hemsworth's presences are greatly enhanced from their solo debuts in ""Captain America"" and ""Thor""; ditto for Thom Hiddleston as their nemesis, Loki, who was sort of okay in ""Thor,"" but great here. Samuel Jackson, intoning and pretentious in his role as Machiavellian uber-spy Nick Fury, drains the life out of every scene he's in, but that's sort of to be expected, and I'm willing to overlook it since the rest of the film is so awesome.I'm 1000% serious when I say Joss Whedon should be appointed the head of a studio: his time has come. He has almost single-handedly taken a genre that has been limping and misshapen for years, grievously misunderstood and poorly realized by the Hollywood machers, and made it into something magical and thrilling.He. Gets. It.Of course, if Whedon were put in charge, that might impede his ability to write and direct, but good god it would be great to have someone who can make something this good be in charge for a while. Warner should just appoint him the head of their superhero movie division for the next five-to-ten years and let him whip the genre into shape. All they need to do is make movies that are fun, and not so packed with dense exposition, and make 'em look good with strong, intelligent scripts. Whedon has done it here: this is the template.

But I digressThis movie is a train wreck. First, not only is a flying aircraft carrier stupid and implausible, but it was lifted directly from a 2009 episode of Dr. Who (Google &#34;Dr. Who the Valiant&#34;).During the attack, where was the US Air Force? The leviathans were big, slow, and obviously vulnerable, and there were just a few of them. A couple F18's could have mopped them up in no time.Where was the US Military period? After about 20 minutes a couple of tanks that I think were actually National Guard showed up. What, were the entire US Armed Forces on break?And when one jet finally does show up, it is to nuke the city. What for? The cube is invulnerable, the portal is on free flow bad dude mode, so all the nuke would do is wipe out the townsfolk. But I guess that is exactly why SHIELD was against it.Hawkeye and Black Window. These guys have no super powers. None. Zip. They don't even wear armor. Yet Hawkeye spends nearly the entire battle totally exposed on a rooftop and never gets shot. Or even shot at. And where do all his arrows come from? Must have got the Bottomless Quiver from Olive Garden. Black Widow at least hides behind things occasionally, but seriously, she's a chick with a couple small pistols. Not exactly save the world material. Why are they even there?Loki. Ah Loki. A god, but like Thor not impervious to injury. Yet he survives everything the Avengers throw at him UNTIL the Hulk just delivers a good old fashioned ass whupin'. If that's all it really took, Thor, or for that matter Iron Man could have subdued him long ago.The old &#34;shoot the mothership and they all die&#34; plot twist.

It excels at playing up the larger-than-life aspects of the story, from the testy initial relationship between heroes and the looming magnitude of the threat they're called together to face. Such moments are dispersed liberally, perhaps once every five minutes, and they're an effective method of keeping the audience on the hook for the duration. What's missing, at least from where I sit, is a measure of substance or depth behind those fireworks. Robert Downey Jr. is again excellent in his nuanced interpretation of the paradoxical Tony Stark, and Mark Ruffalo might just be the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, but by comparison the rest of the cast feels quite thin, shallow and (for lack of a better word) cartoonish. Captain America, for example, wears a completely different personality than he did in his solo picture, and never feels quite right as the commanding field general he's presented to be. The most intriguing aspect of his character, an emotional detachment from modern culture, is barely even mentioned. He, and the rest of the team, feels like a suit of armor with a few good one-liners, not a living, breathing human being. It's a trap that was mostly evaded in the stars' preceding solo shots, so it's a shame to see it tripped here, especially given the amount of time and effort that was expended to define each individual's motivations. Those nitpicks certainly aren't enough to stop me from enjoying the closest thing we'll ever get to an all-splash-page crossover mega-event on the big screen, but they're also irritating enough to keep tickling the back of my mind while the next set of fuses are lit.

The day all Marvel freaks have been waiting for...a decade has passed since we heard rumors that this titan team movie was in the works. The Avengers is without a doubt a complete success and for once lives up to the overwhelming hype.Not ignoring character development, The Avengers manages a pretty tough feat! The story is long, but never boring and even though it takes time to develop, it's like a simmering pot that we all know is going to explode at some point!..and when the pot does explode, it explodes like no other superhero movie has ever done!First off having Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye, The Black Widow and Nick Fury in one movie seemed impossible to give each character their due, but The Avengers does just that,(Fury could have been better utilized and I can't get used to Jackson playing the part.) I grew up with the scruffy cigar chomping BADA$$ white guy version from the 60's), but this film pulls off the impossible! I never once looked at my watch in it's two hour and twenty five minute length. Besides having a very ambitious story the action sequences are the best I've ever seen in a film of this nature.The film has many comic moments which had the entire audience roaring with laughter with the Hulk (who is properly sized for once) delivering in spades this time around ( I guess they owed the character that much after two sub-par feature films). He and Robert Downey Jr. steal the show and give us those classic moments a popcorn film of this magnitude needs to keep everyone focused in on the fact that this is a film about comic book characters. Each character is given time to shine and having origin films for the main quadrant helps a great deal. I can't imagine how they're going to top this one?!The Avengers rivals the very best of all comic book films including Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins and the 3D (which I usually find distracting) is the best I've ever seen. Trailers for the new Spider Man reboot and Batman films were also presented in 3D. Even if you're not really into superhero films, this is the summer's must see movie. Get a tub of popcorn and prepare for an incredible movie experience!.... and you WILL want to stay ALL the way to the end of the film as there is a false ending showing one of Marvel's Heavy Weight Villains before a funny ending scene a few minutes later. I hope Marvel reboots the Fantastic Four with a CGI Thing that could at least give the Hulk a fair battle.The four disc Blu Ray edition is very nice, but one small gripe, they stacked two of the disk top of each other, which I find really cheap for a set that cost this much.

It offers good acting, good dialogue, good direction and great production values.  Hats off to Joss Wheldon for getting all his superheroes enough screen time for character development, while honoring the Marvel universe created by recent movies.  Props to Scarlett Johansson for developing the back story of Black Widow and for holding her own with the guys in the action department.  Props also to Mark Ruffalo for his nuanced interpretation of hapless scientist Bruce Banner and his raging alter-ego the Hulk.The plot is straight-forward.  Banished Asgard demi-god Loki finds a way back to Earth courtesy of the Tesseract power source and an alien civilization looking to invade.  The first casualty is Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) SHIELD headquarters, leveled in a savage attack.  Fury summons the Avengers (Ironman, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Hawkeye, and the Black Widow), who will be forced to build some teamwork on the fly as Fury's floating aircraft carrier (wow!) also comes under attack.  The climatic sequence will be the defense of New York City by the Avengers against a seemingly unstoppable horde of aliens pouring through a wormhole in space.The movie leaves plenty of room for a nice sequel if the current cast can be kept intact (watch through the credits for a hint of what might be next).

This is the ""Lord of the Rings"" of comic book movies -- colorful, epic and emotionally powerful.This is one of those rare movies that just gets it RIGHT in every way, weaving together half a dozen superhero movies into one shining whole. You need to have seen some of them to understand what's going on (""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man"" and ""Iron Man 2"") but it's well worth the effort.Loki (Tom Hiddleston) suddenly teleports into SHIELD headquarters, and immediately steals the Tesseract before the entire compound collapses. He also brainwashes a bunch of people -- including master archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) -- into being his minions.So Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) decides to call in a group of people with very special skills to stop Loki and get back the Tesseract. --  Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Thor (Chris Hemsworth) also LITERALLY drops in on them, and reveals that Loki is commanding a monstrous army that the Tesseract will allow into our world.But even after they barely manage to capture Loki, they soon discover that the trickster god is always a few steps ahead of them -- and he's even manipulating them against each other. This fragmented group of volatile heroes must learn to fight together, or face a world where Loki and his Chitauri army reign supreme.""The Avengers"" is the movie that Michael Bay would make if he weren't a racist misogynist hack. It has massive explosions, a flying battleship and a city-smashing finale that involves giant armored eels.... but it also slows down sometimes to allow us quiet moments where the characters can grow, like Barton and Romanoff's talk. It's understated, but powerful (""I have red in my ledger. I'd like to wipe it out"").But since Joss Whedon wrote AND directed this, it's also a witty, tight script with lots of deliciously funny lines (""Doth Mother know you weareth her drapes?"") and moments (the Hulk's assault on Loki).  He knows how to intertwine action and character development, and his explosive, kinetic battle sequences always end with a sense of bittersweetness. There are losses, and there is pain.Jackson, Downey, Johansson, Hemsworth and Evans all slip smoothly into their familiar roles; the white-hot Renner gets fleshed out nicely as the quiet, stoic Barton, and Ruffalo is surprisingly good as the nerdy, fragile man with a ""rage monster"" seething under the surface. And Hiddleston is devastatingly good as Loki, who is now desperate to make himself a god-king, but still shows occasional flickers of regret and uncertainty.There are a few changes to the familiar characters, and they work -- particularly Captain America, who is a bit angsty about the loss of his old life. And it's a nice touch that the Avengers don't really get along at first, since all their personalities are so different. It takes a massive shock for them to realize, ""We NEED to work together, or everything is lost.""If I had to criticize something, it would be that the first ten minutes are rather rushed, and Captain America's costume looks more cartoonish (unlike his grittier WWII uniform, which combined patriotism AND practicality).""The Avengers"" joins together a bunch of separate stories into one wild, explosive epic -- a brilliant story that sets a new benchmark for superhero movies.

1210439,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001KVZ6HK,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","Unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant-garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms, then chances are pretty good that you'll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic. I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that madeIron Man(1 & 2),The Incredible Hulk(the 2008 version),Thor, andCaptain America: The First Avengerpurely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable.  A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in ""Thor"") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in ""Iron Man 2"", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.)  For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory.",5,Avengers Assemble Most Adroitly,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,3771,"['are', 'sort', 'cinematic', 'snob', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'appreciate', 'avant-garde', 'short', 'subjects', 'tiny', 'projection', 'rooms', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', ""'ll"", 'have', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'watching', '2012', 'megawatt', 'adventure', 'epic', 'certainly', 'did', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'die-hard', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'derring-do', 'ironic', 'humor', 'infused', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'preceding', 'one', 'director/screenwriter', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'really', 'together', 'formula', 'madeIron', 'Man', '1', '2', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', '2008', 'version', 'Thor', 'andCaptain', 'America', 'First', 'Avengerpurely', 'entertaining', 'something', 'miraculously', 'larger-than-life', 'dimensions', 'superheroes', 'more', 'instantly', 'relatable', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'certainly', 'armada', 'technicians', 'who', 'pull', 'effects', '3-D', 'eye-popping', 'glory', 'course', 'much', 'credit', 'really', 'go', 'Whedon', 'making', 'film', 'much', 'fun', 'comic', 'book.Running', 'surprisingly', 'fleet', '143', 'minutes', 'potentially', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'character', 'heretofore', 'limited', 'tantalizing', 'post-credits', 'scenes', 'previous', 'movies', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'surly', 'one-eyed', 'leader', 'S.H.I.E.L.D.', 'peacekeeping', 'agency', 'who', 'must', 'quickly', 'recruit', 'team', 'superheroes', 'do', 'battle', 'Loki', 'deceitful', 'half-brother', 'Thor', 'Norse', 'deity', 'thunder', 'Loki', 'brainwashed', 'archer', 'supreme', 'Hawkeye', 'brilliant', 'physicist', 'Dr.', 'Erik', 'Selvig', 'already', 'seen', 'Thor', 'stealing', 'cosmic', 'cube', 'called', 'Tesseract', 'powerful', 'energy', 'source', 'seemingly', 'limitless', 'potential', 'remote', 'research', 'facility', 'Fury', 'Black', 'Widow', 'former', 'Russian', 'spy', 'last', 'seen', 'action', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'gather', 'troops', 'including', 'highly', 'reticent', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'a.k.a', 'Hulk', 'Meanwhile', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Captain', 'America', 'Thor', 'have', 'learn', 'get', 'before', 'facing', 'enemy.Loki', 'out', 'be', 'least', 'problems', 'Tesseract', 'powerful', 'alien', 'race', 'known', 'Chitauri', 'inevitable', 'battle', 'royale', 'devastated', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'state-of-the-art', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'everything', 'want', 'be', 'really', 'film', 'unexpected', 'sense', 'humor', 'consistently', 'story', 'Realizing', 'escalating', 'level', 'implausibility', 'Whedon', 'smartly', 'clever', 'lines', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'instance', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'solemnly', 'Asgardian', 'brother', 'Black', 'Widow', 'out', 'killed', 'eighty', 'people', 'two', 'days', 'Thor', 'out', 'Loki', 'was', 'adopted', 'Later', 'most', 'crowd-pleasing', 'scene', 'Hulk', 'grabs', 'character', 'leg', 'whip-slams', 'floor', 'beating', 'dust', 'rag', 'defiance', 'logic', 'physics', 'par', 'course', 'here', 'Whedon', 'kid-like', 'attitude', 'deft', 'hand', 'make', 'more', 'exhilarating.The', 'physically', 'fit', 'cast', 'work', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'together', 'ensemble', 'Downey', 'scene-stealing', 'Iron', 'Man', 'given', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Captain', 'America', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'digitally', 'altered', 'Hulk', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Hawkeye', 'get', 'moments', 'shine', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'effectively', 'conveys', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'villain', 'slithery', 'cunning', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'expanded', 'roles', 'Fury', 'Agent', 'Coulson', 'respectively', 'mistake', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'showing', 'Armageddon', 'situation', 'applying', 'too', 'much', 'soul-baring', 'gravitas', 'proceedings', 'definitely', 'not', 'Whedon', 'take', 'never', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'comic', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'gratifying', 'watch', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'actually', 'up', 'hype', 'commercial', 'glory']",Marvel's: The Avengers

1210444,A2PLMMVM7J0128,B001KVZ6HK,Ehkzu,"[6, 10]","Here I'll try to help those who aren't dedicated followers of the Marvel Comics franchise decide whether to see this movie while it's still in theaters, along with whether to buy it. These aren't questions for the fanboys. They're going to see and/or buy the DVD of this regardless, as its huge ticket sales attest already.But what about the rest of us? You wouldn't even be reading this unless you felt some desire to occasionally see a big action movie with fabulous 3D special effects and charismatic stars.But you don't see most of them, because they're just so painfully stoopid, with 2D characterizations and a plot that just exists to get you from one fabulous F/X sequence to the next, and the director is a great special effects supervisor who thinks he's also a screenwriter.Likewise you probably like science fiction...except when it's all fiction no science, which is usually the case.The last big budget scifi action movie I saw was Avatar. I enjoyed it enough to see it twice (partly to test two different 3D systems), but it hasn't left much of a residue in my mind/heart. Nothing wrong with film, but it lacked something. Perhaps it shows the difference between fine craftsmanship and true art. For me it lacked heart.On the other hand, I loved Serenity, whose director/screenwriter/auteur Joss Whedon knows how to direct an ensemble cast and make you care about their characters, tell a story that's actually a story, make the special effects work for the story and the characters instead of vice versa, and who understands that even the most serious drama needs a sprinkling of wit and a certain anarchic impulse to keep it from being too full of itself.So--was this true of Avengers, with the same director/screenwriter? Both movies have a lot of things in common, besides Joss Whedon. Each continues a franchise, with the challenge of lassoing in both franchise fans and new viewers. Each has a fairly large ensemble cast. Each pits flawed heroes against villains who aren't entirely cartoonish. Each has women who are actually interesting characters and not just eye candy (not that they aren't that too).My bottom line is that both films are worth non-fanboys seeing them. For me Serenity is more successful, but that doesn't mean Avengers isn't good too.Good enough so that my spouse, who generally prefers ""art films"" (as do I), now wants to see at least some of the preceding franchise movies--especially the Iron Mans. That's high praise. She'd liked Serenity, but agreed with me about Avatar, and found Hell Boy pretty much a waste of time.Some of the things we most liked about Avengers will be exactly the things some fanboys don't like, mind you. Character development means less action while that development is going on. Frequent, sly injections of humor mean the heroic, humorless posturing of so many action flicks is being diluted--good from my point of view, but the reason, I think, for some of the less favorable reviews here.For me the most memorable character was a secondary one: Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow. Unlike the four main characters and the main villain, her human strength isn't augmented, so though she's as martial artsy as the rest, her real ""superpower"" is a wily brilliance coupled with and coolly exploiting the kind of looks that hampers heterosexual men's ability to think coherently in her presence.I would love to see a prequel about her that develops her backstory, because, more than any other character, she's the one who's had a change of heart about whether to serve good or, well, not evil, but amoral self-interest. I'm not revealing anything here because this change takes place before Avengers' story begins.In this sense she's like Angel in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer franchise, or, earlier, Xena Warrior Princess. Like them, Johansson's character has to keep consciously choosing to do the right thing--it's not an automatic reflex like it is for Captain America, for example. And because of that, her goodness is...gooder...because it is a choice.Plus she is a spy, an assassin, a professional deceiver, using the exact tools she'd used before. So her goodness is the goodness of a battle-hardened warrior, not a saintly flower-strewing do-gooder.In one scene she has to do battle with someone she cares about, or at least cared about. That makes for a much more interesting battle than one between a White Hat and a Black Hat, where all you care about is the Good Guy winning.And actually, fine action sequences notwithstanding, my personal favorite scene in the movie is a conversation she has with a Bad Guy, in which there's no fighting at all. They just talk. But now, several days later, I'm still thinking about what she did in that scene--both Johansson and her character.The unique thing Johansson brings to an industry chock full o' beautiful women is her gravitas. She doesn't ask you to take her seriously. You have to. You can't not take her seriously, even though your hormones are yelling ""Battle stations!""I don't think this is an act. She had this in Manny & Lo, when she was 12. She had this in The Horse Whisperer, when she was 14. She had this in Lost in Translation, when she was 17 yet playing a woman in her mid-twenties--convincingly. (Side note: Ryan Reynolds has got to be the biggest estupido in show biz. I bet their real problem was them both eventually realizing that she was considerably smarter than him, and his ego couldn't take it.)That said, the other major characters all have inner conflicts that get explored. This is the way in which the film is really three-dimensional. Though its use of 3D seems pretty good to me as well.Avengers isn't a profound art film like, say, Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha--a truly great war movie we saw 30 years ago and that still sticks in our minds. But it's way better than most Hollywood blockbusters (such as Avatar) IF you want character and story and actual acting in your blockbusters and not just a White Hats Black Hats story that's mostly a parade of special effects sequences.I do think it's worth seeing in the theater, and in 3D. We have a 46"" 1080p 120hz flatscreen TV and a Blu-Ray home theater (not 3D), but I'm still glad I saw this in the theater. It has the visual bigness that justifies the investment (even if you do buy the disk later), and though I haven't researched it thoroughly, I get the impression that home 3D isn't ready for prime time yet. So both the visual scale of the film and its 3D exploitation make it a good candidate for a theater visit, even if you see most films on your home system, as we do.The music score wasn't memorable either way--neither thrilling nor annoying. For me (and I'm a music buff) it was just there.Footnote: Gwynneth Paltrow only appears in a few scenes, which I regret because she's a luminous actor. She plays Robert Downey Jr.'s partner/lover, and as I recall she's always barefoot. It's kind of cool that she is--this one detail showing her character's insouciance despite her high-pressure job. But my spouse wondered if it was also because Paltrow is taller than Downey. Just sayin'...Lastly, for those whose love of science fiction is alloyed by some knowledge of science--you'll be best off if you regard this as a fantasy movie and not as a science fiction one, despite the abundant hardware. After all, two of the characters are deities from the ancient Norse religion. Another transforms periodically in a way that flagrantly violates the law of conservation of matter/energy.But even the hardware is, scientifically, nonsense. IronMan would need a fuel tank the size of a shuttle booster to do all that scooting around in the air, and since his very heavy exoshell has no flight surfaces, he'd always have to fly in stall mode at around a 45 degree angle at slower speeds in order to keep from plummeting out of the sky. The flying carrier is aerodynamically impossible. The G forces on IronMan would turn him into a red good inside his suit in short order.These aren't exactly criticisms of the film. Whedon once said, decades ago, that he strove to be emotionally true, but that he didn't sweat the technical details. And here he's filming a movie with at least half a dozen films and hundreds of comic books and graphic novels preceding it, locking him into much of the pseudotechnology you see here. So I'm just trying to manage your expectations. Serenity is a real science fiction movie, but it's not based on comic book superheroes and demigods. So don't leave the theater complaining about such stuff. You've been warned.Bottom line:1. If you're a Marvel franchise fanboy, see in theater, then buy disk. But do expect that it being directed by Joss Whedon makes it different from every other film in the franchise, especially in the injection of sly humor frequently. So be prepared for its Whedonization.Also, since it assembles everyone for the first time, it has to be a different kind of film from all the single-main-character predecessors. The fact that it's starting a new series of films featuring all these characters together means there has to be more than the usual amount of exposition in order to assemble the team.2. If you're an art house film lover (as in you instantly recognized my reference to Kurosawa and Kagemusha and perhaps wondered why I didn't reference Seven SamuraiHOLD THE PRESSES! That's it. This is Seven Samurai redux. Assembling a team of mismatched misfits to fight a passel of baddies in defense of people all of whom did not appreciate their sacrifices. Seven Samurai is one of the greatest films of all time, but conceptualizing Avengers as a blockbuster homage to it (and I'm sure Whedon has seen it) is a good mindset to bring to this party.  )So to restart the point, if your an art house type, and you're with friends who want to see a spectacular big-budget action movie, this will suck way less for you than most of the alternatives. It's also a good family reunion PG-13 movie. I know much younger kids I'd take to it, and others the same age that I wouldn't. Depends more on the kid than the age. And if you're the ""teachable moment"" type of parent, this is a great film to take the kids to and then talk about the characters and actions afterwards. They might not even realize they're being, well, taught something.3. If you're a spouse who normally wants to watch things like Downton Abbey (which I'm watching now and loving BTW), married to someone who wants to see things blow up and gorgeous actresses doing the blowing-upping--for you the long-suffering spouse, Avengers has enough character/story stuff to serve your interests while hubby is enjoying the film's more kinetic aspects.It has lots of violence, but you're emotionally insulated from it, by the ""live-action cartoon"" quality of the film. This is nothing like Saving Private Ryan or Kill Bill I&II.; It could be shown on primetime broadcast TV without editing, I believe. No sex, no revealing clothing even (Scarlett Johansson's catsuit is no more or less hoochie than what the Emma Peel character wore in the eponymous 1960s British TV series), almost no cussing, and no ""hard cussing.""I don't want to mislead people into seeing films I like, or into not seeing films I don't like. I want to provide objective help for you, whatever your tastes are. So if you see Avengers and feel I misled you in any way, please add a comment to this review and I'll edit what I said in here to take account of your input.EDIT ADD--June 12, 2013My spouse & I just saw Star Trek Into Darkness. I wrote a full no-spoilers review of it under its own listing on Amazon. I just wanted to add here that seeing it reminded me strongly of how good a director Joss Whedon is--including big budget action movies. Whedon proved that a summer action film can still have original ideas, interesting characters, and something/someone to care about. J.J. Abrams' direction of Star Trek Into Darkness just proved how rare the Joss Whedons of the world are...in Hollywood at least. Avengers is twice the film STID is--and I'm saying that as someone who hadn't seen any of the Avengers prequel movies, while I had see pretty much everything in the Star Trek franchise both on TV and in the theater. Too bad we can't clone Whedon and just have him direct all such films...Particularly the action movie I'd most like to see: the one giving us Black Widow's backstory. Just to repeat that plea.",4,No-spoilers review for film lovers who don't normally go to comics-based movies,1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,12403,"['Here', ""'ll"", 'try', 'help', 'who', 'are',

This film has it all, it's got a great plot, it's got a fantastic villain in Loki played by the awesome actor Tom Hiddleston, you cannot really help but pull for him just a bit (especially if you've seen Thor first) because Hiddleston manages to give the character more depth than most other actors would be able to pull off. That young man is going to go FAR in acting! All the actors and all their characters are well rounded and Joss Whedon brings the fun with plenty of laughs (some of the humour is very BTVS if you're at all familiar with that show)and he's proven yet again that he is worthy of the worship!

Okay, so the Iron Man turbine scene was a little silly and went on for too long, but if that's the ONLY thing wrong with it, that's still an accomplishment. The best part? Thor should've been the character no one really cared about, so the plot revolved around him. Captain America should've come in second, so they made his character arc the most compelling and fraught. So, when it's Iron Man, Downey can just be Downey and the Hulk can be used just enough. I never liked Black Widow until this movie. Even Hawkeye, a throwaway, unnecessary addition on paper, works well here. And the real, REAL best part? Tom Hiddleston as Loki. A weaker villain and it would've fallen apart.

We've already seen Loki and the villains that inhabit his world in the movie ""Thor"", and they were not menacing at all (the IRS is more evil than Loki). Second, this movie lacked any type of character development (there was actual character development in the Iron Man movies, The Hulk movies, Batman Begins, X-Men: First Class, and Man of Steel). Third, this movie lacked the depth and mercurial intelligence exhibited in the Iron Man movies. Fourth, the plot of this movie was predictable (as evidenced in the opening scenes and in Loki's flashback), so we already knew what was going to happen but we were forced to sit through an hour or so of nonsense and filler before Loki's ""army"" attacked.The only good elements and the reasons why ""The Avengers"" 2 stars out of 5 is a condign rating is because the fight scenes between Thor and The Hulk and Iron Man was something we hadn't seen before in superhero movies (it turned out to be a stalemate and seeing The Hulk trying to pick up Thor's hammer was interesting and funny at the same time, and seeing Thor's hammer increase the power of Iron Man's suit was interesting and funny as well), and Iron Man's usual sarcastic, intellectual charm was entertaining to watch and the reason why the Iron Man movies were so successful.Bottom line: don't waste your money and time watching ""The Avengers"".",2,"Another lame, pathetic, awful hyped-up-for-nothing movie",1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,1778,"['Avengers', 'latest', 'string', 'awfully', 'pathetic', 'movies', 'recently', 'released', 'other', 'awfully', 'pathetic', 'movies', 'are', 'Skyfall', 'Dark', 'knight', 'Avengers', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'couple', 'movie', 'studios', 'garner', 'much', 'publicity', 'revenue', 'possible', 'simultaneously', 'ironically', 'succeeded', 'creating', 'one', 'worst', 'superhero', 'movies', 'ever', 'Why', 'ask', 'Here', 'why', 'Avengers', 'lacked', 'good', 'story', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Loki', 'villains', 'inhabit', 'world', 'movie', 'Thor', 'were', 'not', 'menacing', 'IRS', 'more', 'evil', 'Loki', 'Second', 'movie', 'lacked', 'type', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'actual', 'character', 'development', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'Hulk', 'movies', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Third', 'movie', 'lacked', 'depth', 'mercurial', 'intelligence', 'exhibited', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'Fourth', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'predictable', 'evidenced', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Loki', 'flashback', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'were', 'forced', 'sit', 'hour', 'so', 'nonsense', 'filler', 'Loki', 'army', 'only', 'good', 'elements', 'reasons', 'why', 'Avengers', '2', 'stars', '5', 'condign', 'rating', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'something', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'superhero', 'movies', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'stalemate', 'seeing', 'Hulk', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'Thor', 'hammer', 'was', 'interesting', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'seeing', 'Thor', 'hammer', 'increase', 'power', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'was', 'interesting', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'Iron', 'Man', 'usual', 'sarcastic', 'intellectual', 'charm', 'was', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'reason', 'why', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'were', 'so', 'successful.Bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'time', 'watching', 'Avengers']",Marvel's: The Avengers

This wasn't even the best comic book movie, and it wasn't the best superhero movie.  The movie Thor had an excellent storyline, but here, Thor was kind of bland, even having a few plot holes that I found rather annoying.Surprisingly, I found Black Widow to be one of my favorite characters, but alas, just like characters such as Nick Fury and Hawkeye, there was barely any depth or character development for her.I found Hawkeye to be really cool in his one minute in Thor and was looking forward to learning more about him.  What did I learn?  He's a SHIELD agent with a cool bow and set of arrows and...actually, I think that's it.This movie had absolutely no tension whatsoever, and yet, the writers still tried to push for tension that didn't work in the least.  Thanks for telling us there'll be an Iron Man 3 long before this film hit the theaters!I loved Loki in Thor.  He was deceitful, and he always had a back-up plan.  Here, he's not even his own boss.  He's helping an alien race that we don't get ANY details on, and there are no surprises from him at all.  Actually, he made a complete fool of himself at times.I agree that a lot of people are so captivated by the show-offy special effects in action films these days that they never think about the plot or character development.  Personally, I was not blown away for the most part.  If you want to see REAL fight scenes but there is still an excellent story surrounding that, watch Red vs Blue.Which then brings me to the character development.  There's a little bit for Tony Stark (Iron Man) here, but nobody else gets any character development.  Disappointing as well.  Again, I've seen better in action-packed stuff.I've been pretty negative, so I'll say that I WAS entertained, even if the first half of the movie was boring.

The way in which the heroes were brought together was done in an entirely believable way, as Loki, Thor's brother, and the villain of the flick, seeks to open a wormhole by which a lot of bad guys can flow through. It seems the earth is the sacrificial lamb for his power-grab.The concept of having a flying aircraft carrier seems like it would be a disaster, and indeed, I mumbled that to myself when it first took off.

The ACDC music is perfection, and when Stark is told he needs a plan of attack, his reply is perfection, ""I have a plan: ATTACK."" What a great ensemble cast, fromThoralum Stellan Skarsgrd and Jeremy Renner (superb in award-winning filmThe Hurt Locker), to Harry Dean Stanton, who greets The Hulk with, ""Are you an alien?"" ""No"" answers Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk. ""Well son, you've got a condition."" Great scene when The Hulk whacks the pretentious Loki around. He has anger issues. Whedan takes us on an explosive journey, pushing the boundaries of the cinematic experience. He clearly is influenced by the classic British ""Doctor Who,"" with UNIT and the TARDIS, etc, but takes everything to the next level.

Captain America. Thor. Black Widow (who NEEDS her own movie).  They built upon each other, adding more layers gently to bring me into that universe with care and concern for the people within it.  There were a few heroes, then a few more.  And it came together with The Avengers brilliantly.Fast, furious and fun, The Avengers requires those previous movies to get the plot, but not the fun.  The systematic removal of Tony Stark's armor gives way to real humor in a confrontation with Loki; powers shed to face a foe.  Mark Ruffalo makes Bruce Banner his own, easily meeting Edward Norton's solid turn in a previous (mediocre) film.

1210526,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B001KVZ6HK,G. Denick,"[1, 1]","This 2.5 hour long movie achieves the rarest of feats- it manages to not feel like it's 2.5 hours long. The pacing and storytelling of ""The Avengers"" is incredible, and I was entertained throughout. It surely goes without saying at this point, but the special effects are top notch, and the transfer to Blu-ray gives your hi-def TV the workout it was built to handle. Best of all, this movie is laugh-out-loud funny, giving viewers (especially Marvel fans) a real treat.Most surprising of all is the great chemistry that exists between the huge cast of characters, none of whom are wholeheartedly interested in the idea of a team of superheroes. Robert Downey is his usual, witty self, and has so much charisma that his arrogance is endearing, rather than off-putting. Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans each do a serviceable job in their roles, although Hemsworth never quite gets the same momentum that he achieved in ""Thor"" (probably because we don't get to see his earlier, fun loving side). My favorite performance was that of Mark Ruffalo as Hulk/Banner. The Hulk is my favorite comic character, and I thought that Norton and Bana each did a great job portraying Bruce Banner in the previous movies. But Ruffalo was a great choice, and his mannerisms and delivery of lines seem just right for the precarious life of Banner.With such a loaded cast of heroes on screen, Marvel and Disney do not disappoint. They seem to have been fully aware that fans would want all-out brawls, not just a united battle against some vague enemy. As such, we get to see wonderful battles between the lot of them, with the prize going to a showdown between powerhouses Thor and Hulk aboard a flying aircraft carrier. Anybody who had even a passing interest in comic books when they grew up will take great pleasure in watching this destructive rumble between titans.There are a couple of hiccups in the cast, unfortunately. Loki still looks like an extra from the Slitherin House of a Harry Potter movie, and I have no idea why, in a movie of this colossal budget, they would wardrobe him in a cheap costume that looks like it was purchased on a budget at iParty. He never comes through as a convincing villain, and his acting is best described as ""angry, melodramatic teenager"". But I thoroughly enjoyed his ""battle"" with the Hulk... that was great.The Black Widow and Hawkeye do a decent job holding their own, although it's kind of silly to see two regular humans trying to keep up with Thor and the Hulk... characters who are essentially demi-gods, and all but invincible. You would think they would at least invest in a helmet, or something. Hopefully they will have a smaller role in the inevitable sequel, leaving more screen time for the heavy hitters.Despite these small hiccups, ""The Avengers"" is a fantastic action movie, with strong influences pulled from ""The Ultimates"" (an alternate universe Marvel take from about ten years ago). It's hardly deep, and it doesn't answer enough questions (leaving room for the sequel), but it does what it's supposed to do: it entertains, and on an epic scale.",5,"""Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?""

Dialog was witty, clever and fun. Lot's of humor, not just humor thrown in. The humor completely fit the characters and the situation. Marvel took it's time and carefully crafted a terrific movie.

I think 2013 also marked the stylistic dead-end of the roller coaster ride special effects movies that were initiated in the late 1970s by the first Star Wars movie (especially its final starfighter battle scene). That movie was the first to be admitted to the realm of seriously fun cinematic product because its action was carried by a story and a some sort of pop-philosophy. Now, with this ""Avengers"", which is full of jerky digital camera movements, extreme close-ups, superfast cuts, larger-than-life plot holes--a movie incomprehensible in plot and action done with a smoke-and-mirrors conception and production that I should be refunded my 6 dollars paid for on demand viewing--we have hopefully reached the end of this historic low in holywood action film-making. Notwithstanding the virtual *aping of a beloved Jack Kirby-Stan Lee pop-art creation of the late 60s, the Avengers movie is a monument to everything that has gone wrong in tinseltown in the early 21st century.

Casteel""","[0, 1]","Due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to see this movie when it was in theaters; so I had to wait until it was released on DVD/Blu-ray to watch it.  The wait was agonizing, because everyone kept raving about how great it was.  Many people were even saying that it was the greatest superhero movie ever made.  Well, I've been a fan of Joss Whedon's work ever since ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""; so I knew he had it in him.  But the level of fanboy gushing over this movie was so over-the-top that even I was getting a bit skeptical of all the hype.  That is until I was able to watch the movie for myself, and see how spectacular it truly was.  It's a fun ride from start to finish; but it wasn't until the film's final act -- which I watched with a giddy delight that I don't think I've experienced since childhood -- that I finally became convinced that this might actually be the greatest superhero movie ever made.  That climactic battle has to be the most epic thing ever put on film.  Joss Whedon really knocked it out of the park with this one.In addition to Whedon's brilliant screenwriting and directing, this movie has an amazing cast, great production values, and the best special effects I've ever seen.  I'm still in awe of the Hulk (who totally steals the show, by the way), and am completely dumbfounded by how real they made him look.  But all the action and special effects wouldn't be worth all that much if this movie didn't make us care about these characters.  And that all comes down to the writing and the acting.  As a screenwriter, Joss Whedon is rightly known for his witty dialogue; but he is also a master of characterization.  He knows what he needs to do in order to ""sell"" a character to the audience so that they have a stake in what happens to that character. By the time we get to the epic battle that takes up most of the last act of this movie, we are rooting for the heroes in a way that we never would have had Whedon not spent the previous hour and three quarters building an emotional bond between the audience and these characters.  But Whedon can't take all of the credit for this.  Much of it must go to the wonderful actors who play these characters.  They really sell it.  These actors were born to play these parts.  I can't even imagine better casting for these roles.  Marvel really lucked out by getting the right people to bring these iconic comic book characters to life on the big screen.  They ought to be very pleased with the final result.In addition to the movie itself, this DVD/Blu-ray set has a number of special features.  I really enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes.  The movie works perfectly well without them; but they do add a bit more context to some of the things that happen in the film.  There's also an audio commentary by Joss Whedon, a gag reel, a featurette about the making of the movie, another one about the cast, and a music video by Soundgarden.  But perhaps the most unusual special feature included on the Blu-ray disc is a short dramatic film that loosely ties in to the plot of the movie.  Of course, it's the movie itself, and not the special features, that really matters.  And this movie is definitely worth having on DVD/Blu-ray.

Out of the park, twirling around the room wearing your mother's curlers, singing along to Abba and turning the camp all the way to 11 camp, camp, camp. Don't get me wrong I expected a few funnies but here we have a superhero movie played almost entirely for laughs. I loved the retro cheesiness of Thor and I'm pleased to report that not only do the hilarious brothers 'from Asgard' feature prominently here but now we also have hundreds of He-Man Masters of the Universe baddies flying out of portals and being evil in the least scary most ridiculous manner you could ever imagine. They even drive those space-chariot type of ships straight out of the He-Man cartoons firing lasers that turn everything to lollypops or the like - they certainly don't appear to do much damage to any of the Avengers they manage to hit but hey. The heavy enemy artillery arrives in the form of whopping CGI battle caterpillars and they look just fantastic I have to admit. The effects budget was spent well here.If Thor managed to achieve the previously thought of as impossible in turning Natalie Portman into a deeply undesirable plain Jane then Marvels Assemble flip reverses and manages to turn Scarlett Johansson into a sexy catsuit wearing, naughty Russian accented hot mamma. I'm not exactly sure what her super powers are but I think I saw her leaping onto a baddies shoulders and snapping their neck with her thighs - though that might have been me filling in the gaps...anyway, she adds to the on-screen eye candy immensely. The other Avengers range in camp level from the top scoring Thor, all bulging biceps and flowing blonde locks, through the All American tight topped Captain and Downey Junior's 'just so' goatee, all the way to the other end of the scale where the Hulk still looks like the angriest thing that ever flew out of your nose. There is also someone who resembles a supply teacher, wears a black vest and does a bit of archery at the weekends, I'm still not entirely sure who he is but if you're still school-aged then don't look too surprised if he ends up filling in for double maths next Monday afternoon.No review of this film could fail to mention the main villain of the piece, the sexually ambiguous mischief maker who wants all humanity 'on their knees' and seems to go all aquiver when Hulk is in the room. He is one of those old fashioned types of evil overlords, one who can be pleasingly sinister but also ends up as the butt of a lot of jokes - he never gets too scary bless him. A bit of a runt, a bit of a goth, a bit pasty, a very silly hat - not a great combo for being taken seriously as we all know. Get down the gym and have a trim Loki - I'm thinking the full makeover, a spinoff show on Living, a swimwear calendar...Pure fun as Marvel Avengers Assemble undoubtedly is anyone claiming this is the best comic book inspired movie is surely forgetting The Dark Knight? Perhaps this is the film that stays the truest to the spirit of the comic book and that is something to be applauded - it's just that my palette is a little bit too savoury to fall head over heels for this one and I'm still expecting the next film in the Batman franchise to be more my bag. Don't get me wrong, this is still in a different league to the grimy and turgid Watchmen debacle, and it goes without saying that this renders the Fantastic Four as totally obsolete - it's just that I wouldn't be surprised if in the inevitable sequel everyone starts breaking into song and continuously referring to Dorothy.",4,Austin Powers?

1210597,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001KVZ6HK,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[738, 905]","I am more giddy than my giddy aunt. I saw the midnight showing of the AVENGERS last night and, at the end, my face hurt and warped from grinning so big. I am so wired I can't form a coherent thought. Here's a salvo of stream-of-consciousness impressions, in whatever order.Mark Ruffalo is simply terrific as the Hulk's alter (and calmer) ego. I actually prefer his interpretation of Dr. Banner over Bana's and Norton's. Ruffalo steers away from the deadening angst that made me fidget in earlier Hulk pictures. He finds a balance. This Banner exhibits a dry sense of humor but exudes this quirky, low simmer edginess. And I love Ruffalo's interactions with Downey, Jr., two swaggerful eggheads matching their test tubes against each other and applying big, sciency words. I like that there's respect between their two characters. There's an intriguing twist involving Banner's relationship with the Hulk, of which I won't say more. The Hulk - and this seems to be a unanimous impression - hijacks the movie.Comic book geeks like me have recently been dogging Marvel's latest company crossover event, AVENGERS VS. X-MEN. And, yet, this film demonstrates that, sometimes, there's nothing more exhilarating than eyeballing an epic hero vs. hero scrap. Mjolnir, meet the Hulk's face. And have you ever wondered what happens should Thor's enchanted hammer go up against Captain America's indestructible shield?The plot revolves around the far-ranging machinations of Loki, Asgardian god of mischief. Those who've read the Avengers' comic book origin should note a smidgen of familiarity, but only a smidgen. The Tesseract - someone mistakenly thought ""Tesseract"" sounds cooler than ""cosmic cube"" - plays a part. The bad guys whom Loki recruits as an invasion force aren't Skrulls. Not exactly. But they do pose an extinction level threat, alarming enough that some assembly becomes required.Captain America is well utilized here, although I'm hating his awkward modern-day costume. I vastly prefered his more practical WWII outfit. But maybe I just like pouches.Joss Whedon, Joss Whedon. His storytelling has big scope; it has grandeur. Whedon orchestrates a sprawling, high-profiled cast and just about gets away with not slighting anyone. He does rely some on your familiarity with the character development sunk into the prior films. He manages to tie in various plot threads from previous Marvel pictures. Although Stark, Cap, and Banner get the lion's share of the spotlight, Whedon devotes time and space to side characters like the slinky but lethal spy, the Black Widow, and the likable, unobstrusive Agent Coulson. If you assume the Black Widow's defining action moment surfaces in that early interrogation scene, you'd be all kinds of not right. Scarlett Johansson ticks off Whedon's Buffy box, not only in things asskickery but also in terms of strong character beats (the Widow's dialogue with Loki happens to be an acting showcase). She's so much more here than when she was featured in IRON MAN 2. But if I were to pick out two people who may have been underused, they'd have to be Maria Hill and Hawkeye. I do feel that Cobie Smulders was wasted.I love that, like in the comics, Thor never gives up on his half-brother.The first half hour is essentially a slow burn set-up that may or may not keep you engaged. And at times Whedon does sacrifice narrative for those wild action sequences, and that's okay, because Whedon treats us to a series of marvelous cape-on-cape violence. In true Marvel fashion, these heroes harbor instant grudges against each other. But all those violent ""misunderstandings"" merely whet your appetite. Joss unleashes the white knuckle action in the third act. The extended climactic combat sequence - as the Avengers hold the line against a horde of grotesque Not Skrulls - is off the charts and so damn gratifying. There's this now famous tracking shot in which I'm reminded of the 1990s X-Men cartoon in which the camera would often track the X-Men in frenzied action, as they hurtle in and out of the picture, occasionally mingling with each other only to break off again into individual skirmishes. I was mesmerized by Whedon's sweeping, organic approach to the battle scenes.No surprise, there are heaps of whip-smart one-liners, plenty of them generated by a smirky Robert Downey, Jr. - and yet even Hemsworth's regal thunder god elicits chuckles. No contest, though, the brutalizing Hulk - who, by the way, is rendered to savage life in impeccable CG - captures two of the film's biggest laughs.For pure escapism and sheer fanfare and fan service beyond expectation, THE AVENGERS is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. I have to see it again. But you, you make sure to stick around for the embedded scene during the post-credits and then for the post-credit scene. You may wet your pants. Or you may, afterwards, go ""What the flippin' flip was that?""Hours and hours later, I'm still big grinning. Joss Whedon actually pulled it off.What I have is the Blu-Ray 2-disc edition. I must say I'm digging the crystal clear, hi-res video quality of the blu-ray disc. We've probably all gotten spoiled by the extras on the Lord of the Rings packages, so the following bonus stuff probably won't overwhelm anyone:- Audio Commentary by director Joss Whedon- ""Marvel

by the World Security Council (you could see why Whedon scrapped this)*  Extended Scene - ""Loki & Barton Strategize""*  ""Steve Rogers - Man Out of Time"" - This is the best deleted scene of the lot as it explores Steve Rogers' ties to his past in clearer detail; it also features another cameo by Stan Lee and that waitress*  ""Nick Fury & World Security Council""*  ""Extended Viaduct Fight"" - Raw footage of Black Widow and Hawkeye battling Chitauri aliens*  ""Fury & Hill Discuss the World Security Council""*  Extended Scene - ""Banner and Security Guard"" - Banner gets a pep talk and a motorcycle*  Alternate Ending - Maria Hill still being interrogated by the World Security Council- 2 Featurettes:*  ""A Visual Journey"" (00:06:26 minutes)*  ""Assembling the Ultimate Team"" - Whedon

1210602,A28MM46KI4EQB2,B001KVZ6HK,HeavyMetalSushi,"[16, 20]","Being a fan of comics and the Marvel Universe, and after seeing all the other movies leading up to it, I obviously had pretty high hopes going into Avengers, and after finding out a while before that Joss Whedon was going to be directing it, I had a gut feeling it would be well done, because Joss Whedon is an awesome director.  I went within the first week with my wife and a few of our friends...made a whole day out of it.  I enjoyed just about every minute of that movie, from start to finish!All of the characters were really well done, (it helped that each of the directors from Ironman, Hulk, Thor, and Chaptain America came on board to help advise & whatnot), and each actor played their parts very well.  At first, my only one real concern was that Edward Norton was not going to be returning as Bruce Banner, but after watching the Avengers, I found that Mark Ruffalo was a bit better for the role in the end...he played the nerd card a bit better than Norton I thought.The special effects were fantastic!  I found myself totally pumped and on the edge of my seat during the action bits in the movie, and the effects done during those scenes were very well done in my opinion.  In my head, my hopes for the quantity of action was about right on, maybe just a tad higher, but really not by much.  The action sequences incorporated into this movie were just simply awesome!The comedy added into this movie screamed Joss Whedon (looking back on Buffy the Vampire Slayer & Firefly and whatnot), and there was just the right amount in it.  It was added in at just some of the right times, and they were great!  I laughed pretty good in those scenes.The story was well done, and is close enough to the comics as far as my recollection (it has been some time since I have read some Avengers comics).  Obviously, not every little detail would be added in, because that's almost impossible to do when you're converting stuff from a story that spans quite a ways.  I imagine it differs when transferring from comics as opposed to books too...there is so much detail in books, but at the same time, it's probably very difficult to transfer every detail within animation and whatnot as well.  All in all, bravo on the story though.  Of course, that's what you get too when you chose a director like Whedon who grew up reading comics and knows the material and has a real passion for that kind of stuff...you're going to get a good movie.All in all, this is a well rounded superhero movie, and may well be the best one I've seen thus far, right up their with the Dark Knight, which is probably my favorite DC movie up to this point.  If you have not seen this movie, please Please PLEASE do yourselves a favor and go watch it, comic fan or not...it's freakin great!  Even the action fan who isn't a big comic book lover would enjoy this movie.

Such films have included ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""Star Wars,"" and ""Titanic,"" and now the superhero genre joins their ranks with ""The Avengers,"" what just may be the biggest, most amazing superhero film to ever grace the silver screen.""The Avengers"" tells the story of Marvel's biggest heroes, Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, the Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Nick Fury, must join forces to combat a threat so great, that if they fail, the earth itself will fall.To put it simply, ""The Avengers"" is the most epic superhero film ever made.  A rather big statement to make, but the fact that it even exists is nothing short of astonishing: a massive cross-over film where multiple superheroes from multiple films comes together with the same actors from all of them (well, save the Hulk) to act as the climax to a series-wide storyline that's been in the works for over five years now.  It's a miracle that it even came together, and that it works.What is so great about ""The Avengers"" is that it's so much damn fun.  We've been following Captain America and Iron Man and all the other heroes as they had their origin stories, and now that all the exposition is out of the way, the film gives us exactly what we want:  Superheroes saving the world, beating the crud out of lots and lots of bad guys, and bantering with each other.  From the halfway mark to the very end, ""The Avengers"" is a non-stop barrage of action and incredible sequences that took my breath away, often from the action, and also from laughing at the near-endless stream of hilarious moments (in a wonderful surprise, this is the funniest superhero film I've ever seen, but I won't spoil any of the jokes).  Yet, balancing out all the action were many little character moments that make each hero come alive with their own refreshing touches, such as Black Widow's desire to overcome her bloody past, or Captain America wanting to keep everyone together when they're all in danger of drifting apart.  Even among all the explosions, punches and hammers, ""The Avengers"" has a strong emotional core, and makes us care about our heroes as they plunge into battle.Are there any flaws with ""The Avengers?""  Well, the story can be pretty weak at times (Loki's motivations, his plan for the Avengers, etc.), and there's an awful lot of talking early on.  Do any of them matter?  I was having so much fun that I didn't care in the slightest, cheering with my fellow audience members, laughing with them, and gaping in amazement at the spectacle before us.  For two glorious hours, all of us were kids again, caught in the excitement and sheer wonder of larger-then-life heroes working together to save the earth.""The Avengers"" is not just a superhero movie.

Captain America finds Iron Man to be arrogant and unprincipled, Hulk hates everyone, Thor wants to be left alone to reason with his brother, and so on. They banter back and forth, but the lines are never funny.Repeatedly you will hear Iron Man say a string of science-y words, then someone will say, ""In English please!"", and clearly the audience is expected to laugh every time. And Hulk says something science-y at one point, so Iron Man says, ""Finally someone who speaks English"", and I guess I'm supposed to laugh hysterically. Har-dee-har-har.This is one of the most mindless movies I have ever seen.

1210624,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B001KVZ6HK,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[0, 0]","Most of the negative reviews of the movie are based on its plot. As a writer, I can say that the plot is actually not bad. There are scenes early on in the movie and you forget about them till the end. Every scene had its purpose.As a writer, I know that some stories are propelled by plot and others by characters. I actually consider this to be based more on the characters. Each of the characters bring something to the plate. The acting was very good, in my opinion. Yes, Robert Downey dominates the screen when he's on, but to me it's like Michael Jordan on the court -- the others did a great job complimenting him. Mark Ruffalo's Banner was not what I expected, but I liked it, and the Hulk was great in the small doses he showed up in. And I loved Tom Middleton's interpretation of Loki both here and in Thor.Related -- I think Josh did a great job with the intro scene of each character. Nobody beats Spielberg, but Wheldon holds his own here. (Though I wonder how much Gweneth Paltrow got paid for her three scenes.)Two movies that can be compared are this and Watchmen. Both are superhero movies with half a dozen heroes that last two and a half hours (the cast size may . To me, Watchmen seemed like it was that long. I didn't look at the time at all on The Avengers. Watchmen was a drama/character study with action; this was an action movie with drama/character study.I watched Iron Man and Thor and bits and pieces of the second Hulk movie. I do want to see Iron Man 2, and seeing Chris Evans portrayal of Captain America makes me interested in that movie (though my gut feeling was Thor and Captain America were done to set up for this one.)Now, let me add my Christian worldview. Could this movie be more wholesome? Yes, but not by a lot. The action is what earned this a PG-13, but I'm not worried about teenagers on this one. (I always give the caveat that I believe parents should watch any movie with their kids). Loki gave an excellent picture of Satan and his strategies in this movie (especially his conversation with the Black Widow). And I loved the boldness to have Captain America say there's only one god. (And a comment on Stephen Hawking in addition to that.)I didn't take the time to see it in the theater, but it was worth the wait.",5,"Great Special Effects, but even greater Character Studies.",1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,2265,"['Most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'are', 'based', 'plot', 'writer', 'can', 'say', 'plot', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'scenes', 'early', 'movie', 'forget', 'till', 'end', 'Every', 'scene', 'had', 'purpose.As', 'writer', 'know', 'stories', 'are', 'propelled', 'plot', 'others', 'characters', 'actually', 'consider', 'be', 'based', 'more', 'characters', 'characters', 'bring', 'something', 'plate', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'opinion', 'Yes', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'screen', 'when', 'Michael', 'Jordan', 'court', 'others', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'complimenting', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Banner', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'liked', 'Hulk', 'was', 'great', 'small', 'doses', 'showed', 'up', 'loved', 'Tom', 'Middleton', 'interpretation', 'Loki', 'here', 'Thor.Related', 'think', 'Josh', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'intro', 'scene', 'character', 'Nobody', 'Spielberg', 'Wheldon', 'own', 'here', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'Gweneth', 'Paltrow', 'got', 'paid', 'three', 'scenes', 'Two', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'are', 'Watchmen', 'are', 'superhero', 'movies', 'dozen', 'heroes', 'last', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'cast', 'size', 'may', 'Watchmen', 'seemed', 'was', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'time', 'Avengers', 'Watchmen', 'was', 'drama/character', 'study', 'action', 'was', 'action', 'movie', 'drama/character', 'study.I', 'watched', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Thor', 'bits', 'pieces', 'second', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'seeing', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'portrayal', 'Captain', 'America', 'interested', 'movie', 'gut', 'feeling', 'was', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'were', 'done', 'set', 'up', 'one', 'Now', 'let', 'add', 'Christian', 'worldview', 'Could', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'wholesome', 'Yes', 'not', 'lot', 'action', 'what', 'earned', 'PG-13', ""'m"", 'not', 'worried', 'teenagers', 'one', 'always', 'give', 'caveat', 'believe', 'parents', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'kids', 'Loki', 'gave', 'excellent', 'picture', 'Satan', 'strategies', 'movie', 'especially', 'conversation', 'Black', 'Widow', 'loved', 'boldness', 'have', 'Captain', 'America', 'say', 'only', 'one', 'god', 'comment', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'addition', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'see', 'theater', 'was', 'worth', 'wait']",Marvel's: The Avengers

If you're looking for a fun, fast paced, action adventure, comic book superhero movie, then The Avengers is the movie most definitely to see. Recommendations are to see it in IMAX 3D or just regular 2D. Some people told me the regular screen 3D wasn't good. I don't know, I'm just relaying. I can say the IMAX 3D was absolutely amazing. Crystal clear, in your face, you felt like the whole theatre was moving 3D. By now most of you have heard the big plus of this movie is they finally got the Hulk right. I can most certainly attest to that. The 2003 Hulk was too regular guy looking (In the face that is) and the 2008 hulk had the better physique, but looked like a pretty boy. This Hulk looks as he should. Another thing I was impressed with was the massively improved CGI effects and what appeared to be the use of stunt actors in as many scenes as possibly instead of over using the CGI to the point where the characters look like video games like in previous Marvel movies. SPOILER WARNING: Now I'm not going to write spoilers for what's in this movie. I'm going to write spoilers for what's lacking in this movie. So If you haven't seen The Avengers yet STOP READING NOW! Or continue at your own risk. The one thing this movie failed to do was give me a sense of nail biting, on the edge of my seat, nervous suspense, rapid heart thumping ""This villain is so evil, where are the heroes to save us excitement"" Like they did in Superman II (Still The greatest comic book superhero movie champion) with General Zod and his two hench persons. Fans of that movie know exactly what I'm talking about. You see, even though a threat is mentioned early in the movie, the audience never gets a chance to experience any sense of impending doom before the Avengers start to assemble. Because of this the excitement of The Avengers was based on the action you were seeing moment by moment on the screen, but never really had that intense build up of anticipation.",4,5 STARS FOR WHAT IT HAS. 3 STARS FOR WHAT IT HASN'T.,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,1981,"['5+3=8', 'divided', '2', '=', '4', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fun', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'adventure', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'movie', 'then', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'most', 'definitely', 'see', 'Recommendations', 'are', 'see', 'IMAX', '3D', 'just', 'regular', '2D', 'people', 'told', 'regular', 'screen', '3D', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'just', 'relaying', 'can', 'say', 'IMAX', '3D', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'Crystal', 'clear', 'face', 'felt', 'whole', 'theatre', 'was', 'moving', '3D', 'now', 'most', 'have', 'heard', 'big', 'plus', 'movie', 'finally', 'got', 'Hulk', 'right', 'can', 'most', 'certainly', 'attest', '2003', 'Hulk', 'was', 'too', 'regular', 'guy', 'looking', 'face', '2008', 'hulk', 'had', 'better', 'physique', 'looked', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Hulk', 'should', 'thing', 'was', 'impressed', 'was', 'massively', 'improved', 'CGI', 'effects', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'use', 'stunt', 'actors', 'as', 'many', 'scenes', 'possibly', 'instead', 'using', 'CGI', 'point', 'where', 'characters', 'look', 'video', 'games', 'previous', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'write', 'spoilers', 'what', 'movie', ""'m"", 'going', 'write', 'spoilers', 'what', 'lacking', 'movie', 'So', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Avengers', 'yet', 'STOP', 'READING', 'NOW', 'continue', 'own', 'risk', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'failed', 'do', 'was', 'give', 'sense', 'nail', 'biting', 'edge', 'seat', 'nervous', 'suspense', 'rapid', 'heart', 'thumping', 'villain', 'so', 'evil', 'where', 'are', 'heroes', 'save', 'excitement', 'did', 'Superman', 'II', 'Still', 'greatest', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'movie', 'champion', 'General', 'Zod', 'two', 'hench', 'persons', 'Fans', 'movie', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'see', 'even', 'threat', 'mentioned', 'early', 'movie', 'audience', 'never', 'chance', 'experience', 'sense', 'impending', 'doom', 'Avengers', 'start', 'assemble', 'excitement', 'Avengers', 'was', 'based', 'action', 'were', 'seeing', 'moment', 'moment', 'screen', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'intense', 'build', 'anticipation']",Marvel's: The Avengers

Acosta ""Johnny""","[3, 4]","I have to say that I'm very happy to find out that this movie is one of the very few Motion Pictures that support the ""appropriate"" aspect ratio that most people (if not all) would like to enjoy in their movies.WHY SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS ASPECT RATIO?:For those of us who already hate the so called ""black bars"" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, the Aspect Ratio of 2.40:1 on 3D Home viewing brings back those horrible ""Black Bars"" and with that TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage.Usually I don't mind those ""black bars"" on 2D viewing, maybe because we are all used to it by now, plus it doesn't take anything away...BUT ON 3D viewing this is the complete opposite.SO WHAT'S THE ""APPROPRIATE"" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like WRATH OF THE TITANS, and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.77:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of the FULL SCREEN of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.With that said, This movie fortunately does support that type of Aspect Ratio which makes it completely worth the extra few dollars on the 3D Bluray version.Even with an enormous TV set you wouldn't want to watch a 3D movie with the black bars because...the bigger the TV, the bigger the ""black bars"".ABOUT THE MOVIE IN GENERAL:I did LOVE this movie when I went to see it in IMAX 3D, I think it had a good use of the technology.STORY:This is certainly the BEST comic to film translation, and yes, I did like Batman the Dark Knight Rises, but not as much as this one.SPECIAL EFFECTS:The special effects although not groundbreaking they were certainly eye-candy, and what really makes it stand out from the pack is how well the director and his team were able to put everything together and make it look Amazing all around...AND EVEN BETTER IN BLURAY 3D AND ITS AMAZING 1.78:1 ASPECT RATIO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE ENTIRE SCREEN.ABOUT THE 3D EFFECT:Although the movie was not originally shot in 3D, IT DISPLAYED GREAT IN THEATERS AND IT DOES AS WELL FOR 3D HOME VIEWING!If you have a 3D TV and a 3D BluRay player, this movie will certainly make you proud of that investment...I know it did for me.",5,Excellent Movie...and Excellent 3D Aspect

1210656,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B001KVZ6HK,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 6]","Seeing THE AVENGERS at the midnight screening on Friday was not just the culmination of the excellent work that Marvel Studios has been working towards since its inception as a major filmmaking entity (and not just branding that appears before all of the other Marvel character films owned by other studios), it was the ultimate childhood fantasy come true for many comics fans: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and The Hulk coming together in one big-budget Hollywood film. Sadly, for the fringe critics who have made up their minds long before seating themselves in a darkened theater and allowing this 140-plus minute moviegasm to invade their senses and assault their hipper-than-thou minds, it's also an astonishing piece of filmmaking.In the reviews for this film, which has at present a 94% rating on RottenTomatoes.com (hint: that means ONLY 6% of reviewers that saw it didn't like it), the negative ones say that (paraphrasing) ""it lacks substance"" or ""it's a $250 million toy commercial"" or ""it's all flash"". This is America and everyone is entitled to an opinion. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why people think this. I've been a student of film all of my life in one way or another and this film is the very definition of excellent ensemble and technical filmmaking.Joss Whedon is simply the best writer to have captured the essence of all of the characters involved and also has a very acute sense of talent, as has been proven by all of his television work from BUFFY to ANGEL to FIREFLY to DOLLHOUSE. But would Whedon be the best director for a mega-budget Hollywood Superhero Extravaganza? His only feature directorial effort prior to this was SERENITY, and that is more cult hit than big box office. Despite the lack of commercial success, what Whedon revealed with that film, as well as his small-screen directorial efforts, is that he can juggle multiple characters of an ensemble cast with giving them all equal measure in the sense of their character's essence to the story and action. Every character has their moments that are effective and definitive in Whedon's work (especially if it's the character's final moment...). Whedon here displays a technical acumen that is on par with that a lot of the ""big"" names (I'm looking at you, Michael Bay) who specialize in big-budget action. His use of the camera is smart and entirely confident. Of course, what Whedon does best though is directing his actors. With an ensemble of this magnitude and with just the films themselves being something psuedo-competitive, it's a logistical nightmare to try and keep ego out of the way and allow the film to breathe on its own without one actor having to do all the heavy lifting and pushing the others to the background. With Robert Downey Jr. reprising Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans reprising Steve Rogers/Captain America, Chris Hemsworth reprising Thor, Scarlett Johannsen reprising Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Tom Hiddleston reprising Loki, Jeremy Renner reprising Clint Barton/Hawkeye, Clark Gregg reprising Agent Phil Coulson, Stellan Skarsgaard reprising Dr. Erik Solvig, Samuel L. Jackson reprising Nick Fury as well as the big name newcomer Mark Ruffalo as the 3rd cinematic Bruce Banner/Hulk and Cobie Smulders as Fury's Gal Friday, Maria Hill, this is a TON of starpower to juggle around and keep everybody happy. However, with Whedon being Whedon, he's smart enough to make sure that all of the actors have something to do within their character's own mythology as well as giving every character at least one moment to shine brightly in the film. And shine they do.Long story short, this is a direct sequel to both THOR and CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER, with SHIELD, with the assistance of Dr. Solvig, looking into The Tessaract (the Asgardian relic shown in THOR , but was abused by The Red Skull in CAPTAIN AMERICA) as a source of unlimited power. Loki, having somehow survived his plummet into the stars, arrives, takes the Tessaract (and some key SHIELD personnel) by force, and the call to arms is sounded. Under the guise of assembling to track The Tessaract, Stark, Rogers, and Romanoff gather to hunt down Loki with Banner back on SHIELD's Helicarrier (an AMAZING set piece) who is acting in only a scientific capacity since The Tessaract does give off trace amounts of Gamma radiation. Along the way, Thor intervenes and absconds with Loki to have Loki answer for his crimes back on Asgard. Iron Man doesn't interpret that as being a good thing, and thus begins the melee between Iron Man and Thor. Cap steps in to break it up and does so with astonishing fashion. Thor goes back with them to ensure that Loki will meet Asgardian justice as the captured Loki then sits in a holding cell on the Helicarrier and slowly begins to chip away at the already-fragmented group. An assault begins on the Helicarrier and soon the danger becomes all too real and all too immediate as Banner hulks out and begins an epic fight with Thor. The skies above New York begin filling with Loki's army of aliens, and these heroes assemble to defend, or at the very least avenge Earth.The film is almost flawlessly constructed from beginning to end. The first act of the heroes and villains reluctantly gathering starts everything at a good and even pace. The second act allows things to slow down a bit and allows the tension to build. The third act is well-controlled but also orgiastic in its ever-escalating superheroic combat.Now, the performances. Hemsworth is a relative newcomer, but he plays Thor with strength and purity and you can tell that Thor has grown emotionally from his previous outing. Downey Jr. continues the freshness of his antics but as the film opens, still has yet to overcome his own ego in order to become the hero he's meant to be. Evans is a man out of time who happily exclaims as someone around him makes a pop-culture reference he actually understands, and is also a man who longs to be the first one through the door but knows how to command. Ruffalo is the first actor who seems to really get Bruce Banner; he's afraid, but he's committed and it's become less about finding a cure and more about living with ""the other guy"". Johanssen hits all the right notes as the dangerous woman with a deadly past, as well as being a master manipulator. Renner has a good amount of screentime, but has the least to do with his character other than shoot arrows while looking extremely cool. Jackson is the man with all the plans; he's a virtuoso at duplicity (sometimes tri-plicity, if that's even a word). Gregg continues to be perfect as the almost zen-like Coulson (with the exception of being around Cap). The real star here though is Hiddleston. His performance as Loki oozes menace as well as mischief and fear. Basically, everyone plays exactly who they are and plays them to perfection. It's doubtful we're going to see any Oscars come out of this films' performance, but that's not the point. The film is a character piece, but the pieces are fragmented, which is exactly how it should be. And then there's Smulders, whose Maria Hill barely exists in this film other than a nod to the comic univers. Points for that, but she could have used a little more to work with (something tells me she had a bigger part that might come into play in the release of the DVD...).Now, the moments: Natasha's first interrogation scene. Banner's initial meeting with Natasha. The liftoff of the Helicarrier. Stark and Banner geeking out with each other. Coulson's Captain America cards. ""They're near-mint."" Loki's flamboyance in suit and scepter. ""There will always be men like you."" Thor's appearance on the Quinjet wing. ""There's only one God, and he doesn't dress like that."" Iron Man vs. Thor. Thor vs. Cap. ""He's adopted."" Stark and Banner discussing The Hulk. Natasha's reverse interrogation of Loki. Hulk. Hulk. Hulk. Thor. Hulk. Cap. Widow. Iron Man getting a suit. Hawkeye. Hulk. Hulk. The cheapest shot in all of comic-book moviedom. ""Puny god."" Trying to call Pepper. Hulk. Hulk. Shawarma. Stark Tower, afterwards. ""To battle these humans is to court Death.""Effects-wise, it's fantastic. There were no moments that looked uncomfortable or didn't seem absolutely seamless. Iron Man and The Hulk are obviously the biggest logistical problems, and they looked perfect. Whedon, ever the purist, decided that he wanted to give Iron Man back the circular chest piece as opposed to the triangular one as another nod to the old-school Avengers. The Hulk actually looks like Ruffalo (if Ruffalo was to turn giant and green), which is not just spectacular attention to detail, but also most likely a technological advancement. The invading force of aliens looks terrific, particularly the REALLY big ones.There are really only two things that I have issues with: 1. There seems to be a plot-hole in the 2nd act of the film regarding Loki's plan, but quite honestly, that might have actually been resolved. There were some moments that went by so fast, I might not have caught it. 2. Alan Silvestri's score is good, but it lacks any strong and iconic musical cue, like what Danny Elfman or Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard did with Batman, or John Williams with Superman. Although, that has been an issue with all of the Marvel Studios films.I'm sure that the success of this film will continue to build a more expansive universe and more characters will have their due. While this was not an issue with the film itself, I would have loved to have seen a few more easter eggs peppered throughout the film; maybe a Luke Cage or Danny Rand cameo, or Carol Danvers or any number of current or past-roster Avengers. The two most obvious picks would be The Wasp and Giant-Man/Ant-Man. With the great Edgar Wright currently trying to put out an Ant-Man film, the time to push that forward would be now. Also, sadly, the long-rumored and long-debunked cameo of Nathan Fillion as Hank Pym doesn't exist, but it might in the future. Whedon makes it a habit to work with the same people over and over again, and while Alexis Denisof (Wesley Wyndham-Price from BUFFY and ANGEL and DOLLHOUSE) and Enver Glokaj (DOLLHOUSE) make very small appearances in this film, I think he would have liked to fit in even more. But someone will get a Marvel No-Prize from me if you can tell me which other cast member has worked with Whedon prior to this film!The one thing about this film is that while it firmly stands on its own, in order to understand the true magnitude of everything going on here, it is something of a requirement to see the previous films, with the exception of THE INCREDIBLE HULK. You honestly don't really need to see that since Ruffalo does an excellent job of fleshing out the character of Bruce Banner. Of course, every character does give a brief rundown of everything that's transpired before, and Whedon is smart enough to put those moments in and in a creative way. However, there isn't a single one of those films I wouldn't recommend seeing. They're all good in their own way and some are better than others but THE AVENGERS takes the cake.There has never been a big-screen superhero adventure like this before and the chances of lightning striking twice is slim, but if Marvel is smart, they'll get Whedon to do another AVENGERS film as well in three years, and in the interim, fill that time with new IRON MAN, CAPTAIN AMERICA and THOR films. I wouldn't mind at all seeing a Black Widow/Hawkeye film. And so long as they do it right, I absolutely wouldn't mind seeing Ruffalo in another HULK film. It really just has to be someone who knows how to make The Hulk work.Marvel absolutely has momentum on their side right now, and they have to make it work for them considering DC's GREEN LANTERN was something of a flop and Chris Nolan's Batman films are coming to an end this summer, and with Zack Snyder's Superman reboot coming in 2013, it's time to start getting other characters in on the action.It's also worth noting that, while technically Batman is a superhero, I don't consider Nolan's Batman films to be superhero films; they're more dark noir-ish psychological crime thrillers than the colorful heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe and I consider THE DARK KNIGHT to still be the best COMIC BOOK film of all time, but THE AVENGERS is the best SUPERHERO film ever made.",5,GREATEST.

He is military through and through, a take-charge guy when the chips are down.* Mark Ruffalo (""The Kids are All Right"") is Bruce Banner/The Hulk, the scientist in hiding from anything that might agitate him into transforming again.* Chris Hemsworth (""Star Trek"") is Thor, come to Earth to retrieve his evil half-brother Loki, and save our planet.* Jeremy Renner (""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"") is Clint Barton/Hawkeye, the archer who may or may not have a history with the Black Widow (in Bulgaria).* Clark Gregg (""(500) Days of Summer"") is Agent Coulson, the glue that has held this group together through many of these Marvel movies.* Stellan Skarsgrd (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") is Selvig, the scientist who understands the Tesseract and the power it represents.* Tom Hiddleston (""War Horse"") is Loki, the villain we love to hate.

Nonetheless, for any Marvel fan, action movie-goer, or for those who have yet to see it, you will not be dissappointed.  I can be a tough critic at times, and granted this movie had if any one flaw.  And that is only that I wish Hulk could have been played by Ed Norton rather than Mark Ruffalo.  His perfomance was good, but I've read that it was superb and was better than every hulk EVER.  Those of you are entitled to that opinion.  Other than that, the film blended perfectly action and humor, which at the outset - the weeks leading up to its release - I was worried about.  All of the individual films were so close together that I feared this film may have been rushed and would fall sub-par.  But I was incredibly shocked.  The performances were delightful.  Yet there were the serious moments that kept you pressed against your chair, wondering if this team of loose cannons could pull of the big job: protecting our planet.

1210685,A20IPZQ38M96RB,B001KVZ6HK,J. Bakker,"[26, 36]","Review from MetalArcade.net""The best Hulk movie yet."" That's what a lot of people are saying about The Avengers, and while that is absolutely true, it's much more than that. It's an incredibly fun film, overflowing with action and yet still making time for real character development, and even some truly great comedy. I tip my metaphorical hat to Joss Whedon, who has pulled off one of the most exciting and engaging superhero movies I've ever seen.Whedon is a certifiable geek genius, and his passion shines through in every frame of this film. Having helmed Buffy and Firefly, he's become very adept at bringing a team together and giving them some heart. There's no better example than in the fact that The Hulk was one of my favorite characters in this movie, when I've previously only seen him as boring and one-dimensional. I have to give credit to Mark Ruffalo as well, for making this character very watchable rather than groan-inducing.If you've seen any Marvel film in the past few years, you know full well that Sam Jackson's Nick Fury has been trying to wrangle together a super group of superheroes together for his Avengers Initiative. The film has a very basic premise- Thor's Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has attacked the Earth with an alien army, and the only way to stop him is to get the band onstage - that would be The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).That's a lot of characters to balance, and I went into The Avengers fully expecting the film to be cluttered, confusing and disjointed. It's a small miracle that the film is not only easy to follow, but incredibly fun to watch. The dialogue between the team (especially when they first meet) is excellent and often hilarious, and never feels forced. Nobody feels shoehorned in, and there are so many epic action sequences that I almost felt worn out by the end of the film's runtime. The theater I saw it in was packed to the brim (much like the film itself), and although I had to crane my neck the entire time, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It almost feels like a lucid dream, speaking as a comic fan, because even though the film has been hyped for years, it's difficult to comprehend the awesomeness of seeing all these great characters (and actors) on the same screen. It's a bit cliche, but it is the closest thing I've yet seen to a comic book come to life, and it's every bit as awesome as I hoped. It's just an exceedingly fun movie, which is very rare these days.Every character is at their best in this film. Captain America is as patriotic and no-nonsense as ever, and Iron Man's vicious wit is always hilarious and never overbearing. Ruffalo manages to imbue Bruce Banner with a few new layers of heart, and lends him a distinct personality that was sorely lacking from Hulk's previous film entries. We also learn what makes Black Widow tick, and she is genuinely interesting this time around, rather than just a ridiculously hot female in tight leather. Which I still would have been ok with, but at least women won't have any reason to complain about her- and she kicks a lot of ass in this movie.It's not spoiling anything (it's in every commercial) to tell you that there are a few battles among the heroes in this movie. I won't give away who fights who, but rest assured that these battles are even cooler than they were in the comics, and executed very well. They're also not just done for the sake of awesome fight scenes, as it realistically shows off the wildly differing personalities of the team, which definitely don't quite gel together at first.It's not necessary to watch all of the heroes' previous Marvel films to understand The Avengers, but it definitely gives the characters and their interactions more depth. I would say that Thor is the only must-see film before The Avengers, as the films' villains are the same person, and his motivations, and the brother's personalities  become much clearer upon viewing that film. The members of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, notably Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), Nick Fury (Sam Jackson), and Agent Coulson (Clarke Gregg) all get much less screen time than the main cast, which is to be expected, but they all are handled well, with Coulson and Fury feeling much more fleshed out after viewing this film.Overall, The Avengers can be seen as nothing short of a huge accomplishment. Everyone in the cast gives their best performances thus far, and bounce off of each other perfectly. Joss Whedon infuses every scene with heart and excitement, and you'll be on the edge of your seat for the entire film. I can only hope that The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man match my expectations as well as The Avengers has.",5,The Best Hulk Movie Yet,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,4800,"['Review',

Carvajal ""jay105""","[0, 0]","One of the things that in cinematography is more difficult to achieve is to keep the audience connected with the movie for two hours and something which is the typical duration of a film. This is actually even more difficult in action movies where fast paced scene usually don't last too long or have the risk of getting the audience tired , exhausted of never ending violence or getting used to endless shooting scenes for example and then people lost interest.This movie I guarantee you will keep you glue on your seat.  This is the perfect movie to watch at home in blue ray or 3D and use that extra volume in your surround sound system.No wonder why this movie was such a success blockbuster and was #1 in sales for such a long time. There is also a couple of good lines and dry humor for adults. The bonus scenes are fantastic. Everybody in the cast do his job almost to perfection. There is a line with Hulk and the bad guy that my 5 year old finds so amusing he keeps playing it over and over again and cracking up. That scene and the line ""Puny God"" will pass like one of those never forgotten parallel with that Indiana Jones scene  and the guy with super high skills with the sword that Indiana Jones just shot and goes away.Very entertaining, super high quality special effects, funny lines, an incredible collection of talent. This is a Block buster film that you should not miss.  It has all the ingredients of a good film a band or misfits that needs something to glue them together, a boss of the gang that does not cope well with the guys in the ""desks"", all those coming together to produce of course a happy ending.

And the challenges, here, were huge! The actors obviously had great fun playing their roles.  Tom Hidleston, as the villain Loki, is a marvelous actor to look at. His arrogance, his self-importance, his flamboyance, his smugness, his smile of convenience...  I could never get enough of him. The Hulk was, to my great surprise, the funniest of all the characters. He made me laugh at least three times (when he suddenly punches Thor, when he plays yo-yo with a pompous Loki and when, impatient, he roars at Iron Man and snaps him out of his unconsciousness). Agent Coulson (actor Clark Gregg) was a surprisingly deep and touching character and the always excellent Jeremy Reiner, as Hawkeye, was truly fun to follow. His determination and courage made him as important as the other heroes in the story.  The music by Alan Silvestri is perfectly fitting. I would have loved, though, to hear snippets of each of the character's main theme from their previous movies but darn it! The main theme Silvestri composed for the Avengers still is really exciting. If they could have found a way to include Natalie Portman's character (Jane Foster from ""Thor"") at some point,  as well as William Hurt's character (General Thunderbolt Ross from ""The Incredible Hulk""), it would have been the icing on the cake. Why not include the love interest of Bruce Banner too, Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler) and Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins)? I'm positive that they had their place in this story without it being too long. Cameos here and there, ending or starting a scene. No? But hey! That's not really a critic at all. This movie was pure entertainment.  All the iconic images I wanted to see were there, especially the 360 degree camera rotation around the entire Avenger team in the middle of the street.  Or the way they all aim at Loki as he wakes up.  A movie like that is pure candy. Yes, it's exaggerated and yes, the metaphors are quite obvious and big. The story does have its little ""cheesy"" morals and values but the smartest thing that Marvel did was to assemble a cast of such great actors and actresses known for their credibility. If they believe it, we, as spectator, do too.  For two hours at least. We gladly play the game.

Someone seemed to forget to develop the characters through the film (unless we were expected to remember each from their previous exploits).I know this was a big budget big grossing movie but I still was very disappointed .The production of this movie certainly wasnt meant for me.

Late 50's. Thor was a huge man, muscles,big neck etc. Hulk never,or maybe not never, acted as though he was an Ape. He was an intelligent scientist  and to see the belittling of his figure lowered to that of a non thinking human was sad. Captain America was not 5'3. He was a hero in all the sense of the word. The bogus actions that I viewed in and around the car scene was at best disappointing. As for Ironman will nuff said. Hawkeye was well depicted. The CG added to the movie was ok but took away from most of the scenes. Overuse of this alternative reality has turned off the switch in my limited brain capacity. Having said that I believe that the HTLM5 is the only way to go in these adventures. The green screen that the movie companies are  now using does not allow for the actors to assume the identity of there characters.It is a shame, but I suppose  thats the way its going to go, and unfortunately I will have to long for the days of movie making without all the computer effects that dominate some of the new movies.

Don't go to this movie expecting 'Citizen Kane', but if you have any sense of fun, I don't know how you couldn't enjoy it.  Keep in mind this is really a sequel, following Hulk (which I have not watched), Captain America (3 & 1/4 stars) and Thor (3 & 3/4 stars), so it helps to at least be familiar with what happens in those movies before you watch Avengers.  I really wasn't expecting that much when I walked into the Theater the first time I saw it, but was delighted to be mistaken.  Yes, you could complain that Captain America is a bit wooden (decent actor, limited part, gaps in development in his solo movie, so this character suffers slightly as a result), and the plot is a bit thin from the start (but very consistent with comic plots, so be aware this is to some degree, art imitating art - which might be disconcerting if you aren't  familiar with the characters ahead of time) but there are a lot of inside jokes and details for Marvel fans on top of the snappy patter, and some slick deceptions that I think most viewers missed, so there is some modest intellectual appeal.

1210739,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B001KVZ6HK,J. Hill,"[2, 3]","The Avengers is rightfully getting credit as one of the best superhero movies the genre has to offer.  Long, but well-paced, the mix of intense action and clever dialogue keeps the interest level high throughout, and all of the actors give fully entertaining performances.  On the action, special effects take center stage, but I never felt like any shot moved too fast to follow what was happening, or that anything looked overly CGI.  As for the dialogue, it includes a healthy dose of humor, but it's typically more witty than corny, and a couple of scenes are downright hilarious.  And the acting showed great chemistry among all of these characters.  I've seen most of their solo movies, and they stick closely to the personalities already established in those films.  The only one I haven't seen is Edward Norton's Incredible Hulk, but Mark Ruffalo's take on the character is one of the highlights of The Avengers.  Not only is he very authentic and convincing as Bruce Banner, but I enjoyed the Hulk's scenes more than just about anything in the movie.  In fact, he's in what I think are the two funniest scenes.  I don't want to spoil them, but they involve punching Thor and slamming Loki around like a rag doll; both completely cracked me up!  On a last note, Loki provides a perfectly sinister villain to drive the plot and keep the stakes high, and almost makes the movie seem like a half-sequel to Thor.  Even though the expectations for The Avengers were ridiculously high, I think director Joss Whedon and the cast have met them and given fans a real treat.If you see this in the theater, make sure you stick around for the two Easter eggs in the credits.  One gives a big hint about the sequel, and the other is a wry, but very funny, punch-line to a joke from near the movie's end.  They're both worth sticking around for, even if you have to go to the rest-room as badly as I did.  Great movie by Marvel and Whedon!

1210762,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B001KVZ6HK,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[0, 3]","I finally decided to review The Avengers and I chose it for my 100th review. I only saw The Avengers in the theater two times. The first time I loved it and would have given it 5 stars, the second time I saw it I began to see the flaws in the film and gave it 4.5 stars. I haven't seen the film since, but on a whim I decided to check it out of my local Redbox and see it again and it's sad to say The Avengers seems to get slightly worse every time I see it and that is what separates it from truly great films that hold up in after multiple viewings. I think I need to back up a little bit before I go into my review. First I am a Marvel fan. It was the comic company I grew up reading. I grew up on X-Men comics (X-MEN, X-FACTOR, UNCANNY X-MEN and X-Force) Spiderman comics (All of them) G.I. JOE and Transformers. Those were my first tier comics that were followed by The Avengers, Punisher, Iron Man, Daredevil and others. Marvel is my favorite comic company and though I don't buy comics anymore I still go back and read my old ones, so when the first X-Men came out in 2000 I was ecstatic. I loved seeing some of my favorite characters come to live and the great Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen play an older Xavior and Magneto perfectly. I know Blade films had come before, but this was the true beginning of the rise of Marvel comic inspired films that were followed by Spiderman, Fantastic Four and Daredevil films. I like everyone else was happy when Marvel took more control over their properties and making plan to make an Avengers film. It was an ambitious move by the company it needed the tie in films to be successful and they were. All of the films made money and I personally thought all the films were above average to great except Thor. Leading up to the release of The Avengers I was excited especially after seeing the trailers and it having Hawkeye my favorite Avenger in it. Going into last summer is was my most anticipated film outside of The Dark Knight Rises, and on the outside it did live up to the hype, but with three viewings I see that it didn't and The Avengers is an overrated film.I know the vast majority of people know the plot of the film, so I won't waste my time or your time giving an outline of the plot of the film I will just point out its major flaws. First is the excitement and anticipation factor. Everyone wanted to see The Avenger film and all these characters and actors together and were overly excited about that as was I. That joy blinded me as I absolutely sure it did others to the flaws. I was too excited seeing all the characters together and the load noises to notices the lack of story and characters. I've done this before, but I've compared The Avengers to The Expendable films. Now don't cuss me out I'm not saying The Avengers is anywhere near as bad as The Expendables, but it takes kind of the same premise bringing together all these great action stars from the past and present into one film, and you automatically got your audience who cares if the film doesn't have a decent plot, character development or even great action people will still pay to see the likes of Jet Li, Jason Statham, Steve Austin, Bruce Willis, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris and the rest. I paid to see the first film and rented the second and once you get past the glow of seeing all these iconic actions stars on the screen together you see the major flaws the films had. That is the same with The Avengers.All the flaws extend from the writing by the fanboys Joss Whedon who they think can do no wrong, and that was the overabundance of S.H.E.I.L.D. I understand they are necessary and I enjoyed looking at the beautiful Cobie Smulders (Maria Hill), but outside of Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) they should have been hidden in the back ground. Then there are the plot wholes like Thor appearing out of nowhere without real explanation even though at the end of the Thor film he is trapped in Asgard not able to return to Earth. I know Joss tries to attribute all the plot wholes to the captor and I find it to convenient like he couldn't come up with a real and good explanation. Moving onto the characters like Captain America played by Chris Evans. Though I am not a big fan of Chris I thought he did a pretty good job in the decent first Captain America film, but here he seems almost emotionless like he's some sort of robot and seemed to be sleep walking through the film adding nothing to it. Robert Downey Jr. of course gave a witty performance as Tony Stark. Mark Ruffalo is without a doubt the best Bruce Banner. He gave the best performance out of the cast showing the depth and emotion the character has stuck in the situation he is in. The two characters and actors who seemed to have gotten the shaft are the ones who deserved the most plot development and screen time. The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) did get a little more screen time then Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), but her role and character development was overshadowed by the big three. She is a great character and deserved more screen time, and who doesn't want to see more of Scarlett playing Natasha. Finally there is Jeremy Renner who was basically shafted as Hawkeye. I biased because he's my favorite Avenger character, but Clint Barton is a great character being orphaned as a child, growing up in a carnival by Swordsman and Trickshot. There others including the character I love in the Ultimate Marvel universe. Hawkeye deserved better and Renner agreed saying the character in the film wasn't the one he signed on to be. It's a pity because Renner is a better actor then Evens, Jackson, Smulders and Hemsworth. The character and actor deserved more screen time especially with his chemistry with Johansson.All right let's move on to the director and writer Joss Whedon. I really don't understand the overblown praise the man gets like his the second coming of the Messiah and can do no wrong. Don't get me wrong I like the man I think he's a really good writer. Though he had one really bad early misstep with his screenplay for Alien Resurrection he's done a really great job. He's done a really good job as a writer and creator with Buffy, Dollhouse, Angel and Firefly. I am still pissed off at Fox for canceling Dark Angel and Firefly. Though if Dark Angel hadn't been canceled I doubt Firefly would have made it on air on FOX, but maybe another channel would have taken a chance and the show would have been more successful. Any screw FOX let's get back to Whedon who is a really good writer and creator, but isn't perfect, and as a director he's even further from perfect. He showed great potential with Serenity which I think of as by far his best directorial performance. With The Avengers he just seemed out of his element with the story and actors/characters that weren't his own creations and I hope he hasn't gotten in over his head with Marvel giving him the power they have. As writer I still have faith in him, but as a director I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope he is up to the task with sequel. I know it probably won't happen but I hope he doesn't include Iron Man, Thor or Captain America. I'd rather he writes his own back stories for other characters like The Wasp, Ant Man, Hercules, Black Knight and give more time to Hawkeye and The Black Widow.I know this review sounds like I disliked or hated the film, but I didn't I really did enjoy. The action/effects were simply great as was Hulk who was finally brought to life nearly perfectly. As I said Downey Jr. was again good and brought humor to the film as did Clark Gregg who I was disappointed to see die. Scarlett with gave a good performance and with Renner did a good job with his limited and short changed role as Hawkeye. I also must mention Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He was one of the best think in Thor and was great in The Avengers. Overall is The Avengers a one of the best films of the year or a truly great film no. It's overrated, but a good action/comic book film with a flawed plot with a lack of character development/chemistry and some average acting.",4,"A really good, but overrated comic

Mcguirk,"[0, 0]","To get one great super hero movie is lucky, to get three good ones is amazing, and to do it with multiple heros working together in one movie is a heroic feat in itself. Joss Whedon, a god to fan boys, delivers a fun great action packed thrill ride. Thor and Captain America were good movies, the Iron Men were great, getting all the stories to link up and not having the movie studio screw it up must have taken an effort worthy of fighting the Hulk to accomplish and Whedon does it. The movie satisfies all fan boys wishes and still delivers a good story to the uninitiated, in which we get a super hero team up that does not collapse under it own mythos. The personal stories of each hero get enough screen time without losing the pacing of a good action movie. Downey excels as his quick witted and obnoxious but you seem love him Stark, and Chris Evans as the old-fashion but shining symbol of America can do, does a solid job as providing a ying to Downey's yang. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk lends a sorrowful tone missing in the others and we see that less Hulk is good just like in the old TV series. He is only there to smash. Loki really just serves as an excuse to get all these heros together, but there are a few good lines for him.

Jackson).  The movie has a faster pace than the previous movies that defined the main characters.  If one word could define the movie it's crisis management.  Bringing the heroes together is Nick Fury, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D - a counter-terrorist agency trying to stop the alien invasion.  On the other side is Loki (Thor's brother) and the mysterious alien race that he has made a deal with to invade Earth and make himself its ruler.This movie is a non-stop chase and attack scene where the Avengers must first come together and put aside their differences to work together against a common villain.  When S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Iron Man and Captain America capture Loki, they must fight Thor who is on a mission to bring him back to Asgard to face his father Odin.

""The Avengers"" written and directed by Joss Whedon arrives in US theaters today and it's one of the few movies that's absolutely worth the wait.What's Good:  Joss Whedon's script!  Nobody does it better when it comes to blending both characterization, action and storytelling in sci-fi.  His repertoire is on full display in this flick; not a single character gets shorted despite the size of the cast, and the movie flows nicely- forget dragging, there's barely time to catch your breath around here.  From Bruce Banner's nervous mannerisms to Maria Hill's cool competence everyone gets some attention to detail that makes them human and not merely characters.  You're gonna love Agent Coulson's reaction to meeting to Captain America for the first time!  And without a doubt the best scene in the movie is Hulk vs Loki!Being a superhero movie you gotta have references both to the source material and beyond.  Whedon shows his love and reverence of the genre by loading the movie with homages.  I think I even caught a Great Darkness Saga reference in there.  (If I have to explain what that is, forget it...)And what's a Whedon script without the humor?  From the amusement of a couple of running jokes and a couple of comedic bits (""...that man is playing Galaga!  He thought we didn't see him, but we did..."") to some straight up laugh out loud moments this is one of those movies that brings everything together so well it makes you wonder how so many others can keep screwing things up... *cough* Green Lantern *cough*What's Bad: Honestly, very little.  I thought the beginning was rushed, so we really didn't get to see what the Chitauri were all about, how Loki found them and why he was allied with them.  They were just there and they were coming to Earth; given that it's a two-hour plus movie Whedon could've spent a little more time on them.  And Captain America's costume just... didn't look quite right.The Rest of It:  Visuals are excellent.  I don't go to 3D movies but there were a couple of shots that made me wonder what they'd look like full-on.  The SHIELD Helicarrier was like the Death Star designed by earthlings, and the Hulk's rendering was spot on.  Even the alien monstrosity skimming the skies of Manhattan looked like a part of the scenery it was destroying.Forget ""The Hunger Games"", ""The Avengers"" is the first true blockbuster of the year and deservedly so because it exceeds all your expectations.  This is a very satisfying, highly entertaining movie and of course, you gotta stick around until the end of the credits.

1210791,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B001KVZ6HK,John Kwok,"[5, 7]","With ""The Avengers"" Joss Whedon has made the best superhero action adventure film I have seen in years,  thanks to his superb direction, a very good script co-written by him, and great acting from his cast, of which the most noteworthy performance may be Mark Ruffalo's as Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk.  (Ruffalo's performance as Banner is esepcially memorable, portraying him as someone barely in control of his emotions lest he transform himself into the Hulk.) Is it artistically the best superhero film of our time? Such honors should be conferred instead on Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" films, especially his first one, ""The Dark Knight"", and perhaps, Jon Favreau's first ""Iron Man"" film. However, I don't think I have had as much fun in watching a film since Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy that I've been eager to see ""The Avengers"" twice, simply to catch any of the great special effects I had missed the first time, and, more importantly, superb acting from Ruffalo (especially a priceless scene with veteran character actor Harry Dean Stanton), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), and the rest of the cast, though Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene he is in either as wealthy industrialist Tony Stark or as Iron Man.  While audiences will be impressed with the superb special effects, I believe they will also appreciate the fine acting exhibited by the actors portraying the Avengers, the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston) as well as others, including Clark Gregg (S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson), Cobie Smulders (S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Maria Hill) and Stellan Skarsgrd (Selvig). Whedon and his co-writers have written a very entertaining script showing how Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles his ""Avengers Initiative"" of superheroes, acting in response to Loki's theft of the Tesseract - a mysterious energy source - and Loki's plans for world domination.

1210798,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B001KVZ6HK,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[3, 9]","***This review may contain spoilers.***Personally, I prefer superhero soloists to superhero teams, perhaps because it is easier to delve into and devote more time to a single superhero's characteristics, psychological motivations, and objectives.  Also, I think, by their very nature, superheroes tend to be defiant, isolated loners - they are different from, and surpass the abilities of, common people.  Therefore, I was particularly pleased by director Joss Whedon's triple accomplishment in ""The Avengers"".  He faced the challenge of plausibly uniting, and coalescing several different actors with different acting qualities - especially when only one of them, Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, has any national recognizability (no knock against the rest of the ensemble group, of course). Whedon faced the challenge of combining and meshing several wildly disparate superheroes resolutely used to being ""lone wolves"" and functioning solo.  Finally, Whedon faced the challenge of giving each hero equal substantial time to strut their stuff in the spotlight, even the deceptively ordinary, non-superpowered Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).  I think Whedon admirably succeeds on all three counts.I also admire Whedon's deliberate, deft restraint in plotting ""The Avengers"".  Much as it might chafe adrenaline addicts impatiently waiting for the cataclysmic New York smackdown, the movie takes its time to establish the god of mischief and evil Loki's (Tom Hiddleston') nefarious partnership with the Predator-like aliens the Chitari and their unholy contract (Chitauri, in exchange for the Tesseract's (or Cosmic Cube's) improbably infinite power, send an endless horde of warriors through a space portal to help Loki conquer Earth).  There's a lot of necessary exposition in this first half of the movie. ""The Avengers"" not only has to gradually reveal Loki's ultimate motives and introduce (and reintroduce) each superhero's personality and conflicts. The movie must also surmount various obstacles (including slam-bang infighting and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s latent exploitation of the Tesseract to develop extraterrestial pre-emptive strike weaponry) to the Avengers becoming a cohesive fighting unit. With the commanding, no-nonsense guidance of unflappable S.H.I.E.L.D. commander Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson), the Avengers grudgingly but steadily get their act together.  They realize that saving the Earth takes priority over petty squabbles, disagreements, and even betrayals (including the one Black Widow uses to bring and unleash Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) into the fold).  Yes, that's a lot of exposition to keep straight, but Whedon handles this mammoth task well.Eventually, we get to the global battle, and what a colossal battle royale it is!  Again, Whedon displays his juggling skills as all the Avengers make their unique contributions towards fighting the Chitauri threat.  The director modulates the rousing fight scenes well enough so you don't eventually feel overwhelmed and worn out.  The only three critical observations I have about the conflict are these: 1) the Chitauri, gliding in on their aerial cycles, seemed to serve the same purpose as the battle droids in the ""Star Wars"" prequels: gun fodder.  In other words, they seemed to go down much too easily.  Their only advantage was sheer weight of numbers, 2) it's a major miracle no citizens get killed, and 3) who's going to pay for the clean-up afterwards?  Wait, there may be a fourth, shouldn't it occurred to the Avengers earlier that closing the portal was the solution? Ahh, whatever!  It's a stupendous spectacle!Beside's the spectacle, there's much to savor in ""The Avengers"".  Whedon, especially through the smartaleck banter of the self-absorbed Iron Man/Tony Stark, provides several hilarious one-liners and dialogue that keep this enterprise from sinking into ponderous self-importance.  However, ironically, the wrathful Hulk provides the movie's three funniest scenes, especially when he confronts the vainglorious Loki at Stark's phallic tower and dismisses him as a ""Puny god!""  Downey and Ruffalo engage in inspired techno-speak when attempting to locate the Tesseract.  Even the ""non-superheroes"", especially Fury's self-sacrificing man Friday Phil Coulson, demonstrate their heroism.  Of course, the CGI special effects, including the way the Hulk resembles a pumped-up Mark Ruffalo and the undulating Chitauri spaceships resembling ancient whale skeletons, are mind-boggling but convincing.I could ramble on and not begin to cover all the facets of this successful production.  If you like Marvel, the Avengers, balanced ensemble work, and/or full-throated action thrillers, I think you'll love this movie.  If you prefer cerebral, contemplative movies, I think you may find something to like about ""The Avengers"".  The Dark Knight and any future adaptation of The Justice League of America should tremble at the high standard they have to reach. So be it!P.S.:  If you have the patience to wade through the end credits, you will see a post-scene midway which sets up the sequel, where the Avengers will encounter the embodiment of death itself.  At the very end, you will see our beloved superheroes enjoying shawarma in a deli.

1210815,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,B001KVZ6HK,Jon Thompson,"[0, 1]","I was so hoping to be able to give this outing of the Marvel universe five stars, but I'm afraid I just can't. Not that there is anything wrong with the actual film. Far from it. But by its very nature, it has insurmountable obstacles which would automatically deminish its potential, despite anything anyone might do with it.For one thing, if you ever were a fan of the Marvel comic books, you know that this time out you are seeing is a once-a-year annual edition, rather than a regular story. In any regular issue the story would focus on one particular plot or threat or through-line and the struggle to overcome that single problem allowed the characters to explore various aspects of their lives and personalities. In the Annual issue, the entire idea was to cram it as full of ""neat stuff"" as possible, rather than tell a linear story. It was in the annual's that such fan questions as ""if Hulk met Thor, who would win?"" got addressed, not as some necessary part of the main plotline, but just for fun. And that's what goes on here... the fun.Basically it's an almost three hour long fireworks show. It's amazing, thrilling, even mind-blowing. But after a while, fireworks, no matter how individually impressive, are still just fireworks. A couple hours into the show, you're going to experience shell shock and your ability to react emotionally is going to shut down. That's what happens in Avengers. You just never get all that emotionally involved, simply because there's so much going on, so much action, so many complex relationships, that it's overkill. All you really do is buckle in for the numerous action sequences, and those are absolute gold.I found two other flaws with the film, however.From time to time, it didn't seem to be able to decide if it wanted to be taken seriously, to make the crises genuinely moving, or it just wanted to be a wacky cartoon. Joss (as writer/director) makes a couple of poor choices with moments that could have helped pull the audience in emotionally, totally sabotaguing them. One example is late in the film where Hulk and Thor are banging away at each other, then join together to take on a massive alien flying worm creature, succeeding in killing it. But at the moment where it crashes to the ground and dies, leaving the two heroes atop its body in triumph, Joss chose to throw in a sight gag (Hulk punching Thor sideways) that is clearly out of a Warner Brothers cartoon. So a moment where we might have seen a bit of some kind of bonding between these battling characters is totally shattered in favor of a cheap, quick laugh. There are a number of those moments throughout the film that slap against any possibility of trying to take things emotionally seriously.The other weakness is the early sniping the heroes do at each other. Although it is intended to show that they are loners, egocentric and unable to bond into a cohesive unit, the dialogue is actually so witty, clever and engaging, that it all comes off like a group of friends playing ""the Dozens"" (that game where you hurl insults at one another.) There is no sense that these guys can't get along, or that there is any dangerous tension between them. It reads a lot more like Bing Crosby/Bob Hope banter in one of their Road pictures. Not that it's bad in any way. It's brilliant dialogue, heaps of fun to watch. But supposedly one of the main dramatic themes is the very ""loner"" nature of these characters and their inability to work together. At no time do you get a sense that, if one of them pushes a single inch further all hell is going to break loose, and that is what is needed to drive home the point... the Avengers were rejected by the Powers That Be because they can't work together effectively. Even a very few moments where those confrontations really looked like things were going to break into violence due to egos or annoyance would have adequetly reinforced that necessary sense that the Avengers are not going to work as a team, but no such moments exist because Joss's writing is just too darn good and engaging.Other than those few weaknesses, more a product of the very basic nature and sheer size of the piece, the Avengers is a high concept romp through a theme park of thrills. Since I first saw it three days ago, I've watched it four times, always finding tiny little additional nuggets to enjoy each time. This is one to buy and keep in the DVD jukebox rotation.One final comment. If Joss set out to make every guy in the audience fall hopelessly in love with Gweneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, he succeeded. The by-play between her and Stark when Agent Coulson comes by is absolute bliss. I want one for Christmas.",4,The Annual Issue! More pages!

So I was really excited about seeing this one.  The movie was really good.  Full of action and humor.  It was 2 hours and something but when I and the person I was with were leaving, I commented on how it seemed like it was an hour long.  While it had a lot of action, for the first 45 minutes or so it seemed to go slow.  I was falling asleep.  Then it started to pick up.  I think this is one of those movies that will be even better when I am sitting at home watching it.  Something that I didn't really like was the pacing.  Once they realized what was going on, they just started fighting.  Seems they could have worked it up a bit and made it more dramatic.  I never felt bad for or worried about any of the people getting hurt or dying.  None of them really mattered to me.  I think because everything just started so fast.

I don't know what Disney was thinking when they decided the only way you can have all the special features was if you buy it from a certain store. That is just wrong on their part to do such a thing.Secondly, I hate how you can't access certain features unless you download the Marvel Second Experience App. Even after downloading the app, it still wouldn't work.This is a great example where design took priority over functionality and practicality and its the consumer that suffers in the end. I am extremely disappointed.As an added insult to injury, when I downloaded the movie from iTunes with my digital download code, it wouldn't include any of the iTunes Extras.I also don't like the packaging of the movie either. The cover makes me dizzy and while you can tear it off there is nothing behind it so it becomes an ugly yellow box. I also don't like how the discs are placed on top of each other rather than receive their own slot.I also am upset that the 30 minutes of deleted Captain America scenes from The Avengers was not included either.The only thing that is keeping me from giving this review anything less than 3 stars is that the 3D is good and for $20 instead of $30, it was totally worth it.

1210906,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B001KVZ6HK,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 7]","Rating:+4 The dust still hasn't settled on the excitement of the release of The Avengers.  Joss Whedon was handed over the combined stories of four of Marvel's most iconic characters (and a few others tossed in for good measure) and asked to create a film (co-written with Zak Penn) that brought all of them together on a scale that has, at least up until this point, never been achieved.  For the most part, Whedon and company do a pretty darned good job of things.I've seen the film three times so far and I might actually go check it out one more time before it leaves theaters.  I saw it in 2D the first and last time and in 3D the second time.  While the 3D looks decent enough, it's only necessary for a couple of ""epic"" looking moments in the film.  Otherwise, the 3D adds nothing to the story.....not that it needs to add anything.The story itself moves at a pretty fast pace and is an excellent collection of action and plot.  While Whedon could have easily taken a ride on the Michael Bay train of excessive 'splosions and computer-generated ""awesome,"" he instead scattered the action throughout a very solid plot that builds on the unique personalities of the four main players (Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, and Hulk) and how they eventually come together to take on Thor's lil' adopted brother, Loki, in a war to save the planet.The story begins with Loki coming to Earth to acquire the Tesseract (which you are familiar with if you've seen some of the other films leading up to this, specifically Thor and Captain America).  Once it is in his control, he plans to use an army (I'll remain a bit vague here for the two people who haven't seen this film) to take over Earth and then any other world he sees fit to conquer after that.  In his way, however, is Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.  Fury sets out to gather three of Earth's mightiest heroes.  He sends Agent Coulson to find Tony Stark (Iron Man), Agent Romanoff/Black Widow to fetch Dr. Banner (Hulk), and he calls upon Captain America himself.  A fourth hero, Thor, is considered a wild card and there is no way to know if he'll even show up to help battle his little brother.When Loki shows up, he ""compromises"" Agent Barton/Hawkeye and Dr. Selvig, making them his servants.  He takes the Tesseract and sets out on his plan of world domination.Can Fury convince Cap, Iron Man, and Hulk to join forces against Loki?  Will Thor show up?  Can Scarlett Johansson look any hotter in this film?  You'll have to see The Avengers to find out.The cast is brilliant from top to bottom.  I was always fond of Tom Hiddleston's performance as Loki in Thor, and he amps it up just a bit for this film.  He's a bit more psychotic and a lot more egotistical in this go round.  Chris Evans IS Captain America.  I believed every single word that came out of his mouth as he not only took the point during the fight, but let his true blue all American ways come through.  He was a man lost in time who injected just the right amount of old fashioned American patriotism to save the day.  Robert Downey Jr. could have played the role of Iron Man in his sleep in this third outing as Tony Stark, but instead he played the funny man to Evans' straight man in this film.  All of the characters had their funny moments, but Downey seemed to be written into the film primarily for humor.  Don't get me wrong, Iron Man has plenty of epic moments in this film, but most of the laughs come from him, except for the big green guy......Hulk.  Mark Ruffalo stepped into the much maligned role of Bruce Banner, and made it his own.  He's meek, desperate to remain calm, and always warning others not to cross him.  He and Stark have a few funny moments together, but let's be honest here, we all came to see the Hulk do what he does best, which is SMASH, and he does just that to perfection once he's unleashed in the film.  Not only does Hulk have some of the most brutal moments in this film, he has two of the funniest ones as well.  I won't spoil them for you here, but don't be surprised when you laugh out loud during a tense confrontation between the Hulk and another character.  Chris Hemsworth, much like Evans, was made for the role of Thor.  He has some of the top action moments in this film, but also handles the emotional struggle of fighting against or saving his brother quite well.Samuel Jackson does a solid job as Nick Fury, although his character is delegated more to a background role as he does most of his fighting against S.H.I.E.L.D. itself.  Cobie Smulders, while nice on the eyes, was pretty much vanilla as Agent Maria Hill.  Scarlett Johansson was very good as Black Widow and handled her action sequences quite well.  Jeremy Renner did a good job in the role of Clint Barton/Hawkeye.  His role was a bit limited, but he owns every minute he's on the screen.The real gem in this film was Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson.  His giddy fanboy reaction to Captain America was classic, and despite being a relatively small player in all of the other films, he takes center stage this time around.The action was very good.  It was also very loud and very fast.  Whedon loved to zoom in a lot, which led up to a number of blurry fight sequences, especially involving Hulk, Thor, and Iron Man.  He made sure that there were plenty of iconic scenes during the film, one of the best involving Captain America and Thor.  He also did a fair job of pacing with the film.The only knock that I really have with this movie is that some of the editing was choppy.  One particularly epic sequence involving three heroes ended with a thud, and took me out of the film for just a split second.  There were also a few scenes involving Loki's army that reminded me of the old television series V from the 1980's, and amped up the cheese a tad bit.Still, the fanboy in me wants to give this film five stars for the simple fact that it was pulled off.  It was fun, epic, and brilliant.  However, the amateur critic within begs me to take off one star for the fact that the editing did really bother me a couple of times.So is it worth multiple viewings?  Considering the fact that it's the only film I've ever paid full price to see more than once at the theater, yes, it's definitely worth multiple viewings.  I plan to own it on DVD when it comes out (September 25 is the announced date).  It's popcorn fodder with a plot, and that's a rare treat, especially during the ""blockbuster"" summer season for Hollywood.Go see this film.  Go see this film.  Go see this film!",4,"""Hulk....Our Movie Is A SMASH!""",1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,6509,"['Rating', '+4', 'dust', 'still', ""n't"", 'settled', 'excitement', 'release', 'Avengers', 'Joss',

Despite pulling together the ultimate dream team, Nick Fury and longtime confidant Agent Coulson must find a way to convince the Super Heroes to work with, not against each other, when the powerful and dangerous Loki gains access to the Cosmic Cube and its unlimited power.The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Chris Evans (as Steve Rogers / Captain America), Mark Ruffalo (as Bruce Banner / The Hulk), Chris Hemsworth (as Thor), Scarlett Johansson (as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (as Clint Barton / Hawkeye), Tom Hiddleston (as Loki), Clark Gregg (as Agent Phil Coulson), Cobie Smulders (as Agent Maria Hill), Stellan Skarsgard (as Selvig) & Samuel L. Jackson (as Nick Fury) is excellent. The directing by Joss Whedon (who also wrote the screenplay & co-wrote the story) is brilliant. The story by Zak Penn & Whedon & the screenplay by Whedon is brilliant.The music by Alan Silvestri is brilliant. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is brilliant. The film editing by Jeffrey Ford & Lisa Lassek is brilliant. The casting by Sarah Finn & Randi Hiller is brilliant. The production design by James Chinlund is brilliant. The art direction by Benjamin Edelberg, Jann K. Engel, Gregory S. Hooper, Billy Hunter, Richard L. Johnson (supervising art director) & Randy Moore is brilliant. The set decoration by Victor J.

You want even more vindication that Joss Whedon's (Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog) film, The Avengers, is worthy of your hard-earned dollars.I give it five out of five stars.If you keep up with my reviews, you know this is not a rating that I hand out lightly.  So I will give you some reasoning.  First, and most impressively, every single actor is given an equal amount of screen time in this film.  Did you love Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in his brief cameos from the other films?  You'll see plenty of him.  Did you think Robert Downey, Jr. was the perfect fit for Iron Man (as I do)?  You'll get your fix.  Were you impressed by Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye or Chris Evans as Captain America in previous appearances?  You won't be disappointed.  Each character is also provided an ample introduction for you to become quickly acquainted with them, or to jog your memory of their powers and origin.  And if you are already familiar with both, then these scenes compose a pleasant ""calm before the storm"".Mark Ruffalo has been cited as the best Hulk yet, better even than Bill Bixby, according to radio personality and ""Hollywood Babble-On"" co-host Ralph Garman.  While I first found this to be sacrilegious, I knew I had to see this film on opening weekend to see if I would agree (in addition to my adoration for Tony Stark).  I would have never chosen Ruffalo for Bruce Banner, and yet he was impeccable.  I was just as wrong about him as I was about Heath Ledger being the Joker in The Dark Knight.  Ruffalo masters a nervous tic so well that you find yourself feeling bad for him.  You hope he doesn't become the Hulk (even though you still hope he does) just so he doesn't have to experience the anger and pain that come with the transformation.  Ruffalo truly is the best Hulk.Loki, the villain of the film, is played by Tom Hiddleston and is sexy probably, in part, because he is so evil.  He is a great counterpart to Thor as his brother.  Thor is someone I was never personally interested in and to this day, I have yet to see the film.  However, I must eat crow and say that Hemsworth possesses a much finer acting ability than I initially believed he would.  I took him for an airhead; he is not even close.  I am now interested in seeing Thor based on Hemsworth's performance in this film.There are almost as many scenes of comic relief in The Avengers as there are action-packed scenes.  Believe it or not, the Hulk provides some of this much appreciated wit.  Some have said that the last third of the film is one long-running action scene.  I found the entire film to be.  Very few scenes were slowed down.  This was a film where you either kept up or got left in the dust.  It is two hours and twenty minutes of non-stop action.  The dialogue is witty and the acting is so well honed that I found myself scoffing at the Academy as I watched the scene between Loki and Thor at Stark Tower.  How can they continue to dismiss comic-book movies for a chance at the Oscar when great ones such as this are continuously churned out?Even if you haven't seen Captain America, Thor, or either of the Iron Man films, even if you know nothing at all about comics but love action films, I strongly suggest you see this film.  And if you are a fan of all of the above, then there is no reason why you shouldn't see this film.  It's even great for kids, as there isn't much profanity and there are few scenes of graphic violence.  RottenTomatoes.com gave this film a 93% rating and they know their stuff.  I give it five out of five and I like to think I know mine.",5,The answer is yes; you want to see The Avengers.,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,3716,"['Let', 'cut', 'chase', 'already', 'know', 'why', ""'re"", 'here', 'want', 'even', 'more', 'vindication', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Dr.', 'Horrible', 'Sing-Along', 'Blog', 'film', 'Avengers', 'worthy', 'hard-earned', 'dollars.I', 'give', 'five', 'five', 'stars.If', 'keep', 'up', 'reviews', 'know', 'not', 'rating', 'hand', 'out', 'lightly', 'will', 'give', 'reasoning', 'First', 'most', 'impressively', 'single', 'actor', 'given', 'equal', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'film', 'Did', 'love', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'brief', 'cameos', 'other', 'films', ""'ll"", 'see', 'plenty', 'Did', 'think', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Iron', 'Man', 'do', ""'ll"", 'get', 'fix', 'Were', 'impressed', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Hawkeye', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Captain', 'America', 'previous', 'appearances', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'character', 'also', 'provided', 'ample', 'introduction', 'become', 'quickly', 'acquainted', 'jog', 'memory', 'powers', 'origin', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'then', 'scenes', 'compose', 'pleasant', 'calm', 'storm', '.Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'been', 'cited', 'best', 'Hulk', 'yet', 'better', 'even', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'according', 'radio', 'personality', 'Hollywood', 'Babble-On', 'co-host', 'Ralph', 'Garman', 'first', 'found', 'be', 'sacrilegious', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'film', 'opening', 'weekend', 'see', 'would', 'agree', 'addition', 'adoration', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'chosen', 'Ruffalo', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'yet', 'was', 'impeccable', 'was', 'just', 'wrong', 'about', 'was', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'being', 'Joker', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Ruffalo', 'nervous', 'tic', 'so', 'well', 'find', 'feeling', 'bad', 'hope', ""n't"", 'become', 'Hulk', 'even', 'still', 'hope', 'just', 'so', ""n't"", 'have', 'experience', 'anger', 'pain', 'come', 'transformation', 'Ruffalo', 'truly', 'best', 'Hulk.Loki', 'villain', 'film', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'sexy', 'probably', 'part', 'so', 'evil', 'great', 'counterpart', 'Thor', 'brother', 'Thor', 'someone', 'was', 'never', 'personally', 'interested', 'day', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'film', 'However', 'must', 'eat', 'crow', 'say', 'Hemsworth', 'much', 'finer', 'acting', 'ability', 'initially', 'believed', 'would', 'took', 'airhead', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'am', 'now', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Thor', 'based', 'Hemsworth', 'performance', 'are', 'almost', 'many', 'scenes', 'comic', 'relief', 'Avengers', 'are', 'action-packed', 'scenes', 'Believe', 'not', 'Hulk', 'much', 'appreciated', 'wit', 'have', 'said', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'one', 'long-running', 'action', 'scene', 'found', 'entire', 'film', 'be', 'Very', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'slowed', 'down', 'was', 'film', 'where', 'kept', 'up', 'got', 'left', 'dust', 'two', 'hours', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'non-stop', 'action', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'acting', 'so', 'well', 'honed', 'found', 'scoffing', 'Academy', 'watched', 'scene', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'Stark', 'Tower', 'How', 'can', 'continue', 'dismiss', 'comic-book', 'movies', 'chance', 'Oscar', 'when', 'great', 'ones', 'such', 'are', 'continuously', 'churned', 'out', 'Even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Captain', 'America', 'Thor', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', 'even', 'know', 'nothing', 'comics', 'love', 'action', 'films', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'fan', 'above', 'then', 'reason', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'even', 'great', 'kids', ""n't"", 'much', 'profanity', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'graphic', 'violence', 'RottenTomatoes.com', 'gave', 'film', '93', '%', 'rating', 'know', 'stuff', 'give', 'five', 'five', 'like', 'think', 'know', 'mine']",Marvel's: The Avengers

Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Toy Story) did what every screenwriter and director should do in all movies - make the audience care about the characters and as a result - we'll follow them anywhere and believe everything!.This movie has action, adventure, drama, mystery, intrigue, gadgets, technology and two extremely important aspects....heart and humor! Starting from droplets of all the other films before it (Iron Man. The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) this film tells the story of the brother of Thor (and a mystery off-world villain) Loki -  played deliciously creative by Tom Hiddleston (Warhorse, Midnight In Paris, Thor)  plotting an evil destruction of the Planet Earth.Thanks to the incredibly funny and sharp performance of Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, The Incredibles) as the S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Furry leader along with another character (like Jacksons') sprinkled though all the previous films, Agent Coulson played succinctly by Clark Greg (The Shield, Mr. Poppers Penguins, Thor) - who both got the Avengers Team together to battle this deadly enemy who obviously an egomaniacal madman!What great about this film is the believability of all the super heroes and their alter egos. Top of the performances were Robert Downey, Jr.(Chaplin, Sherlock Holmes, Due date) as Ironman and the hysterical ego drive alter ego Tony Stark and Chris Evens (Fantastic Four, The Losers, Push) as Captain America/Steve Rogers. Their chemistry and their electrifying  performances made for exciting drama and comedy every time they were on screen.And - Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek 2009, Thor, Cabin In the Woods) reprising his intensely innocent yet strong performance of the Demi-God - Thor. He wields his hammer like never before. In fact one of the more memorable scenes involves a fight of basically egos with Ironman and Thor only to be broken up by Captain America with some humorous results!The More subtle performance of Mark Ruffalo (Shutter Island, 13 Going On 30, Zodiac) as The Hulk was a great contrast and motivation to the Avengers Team! And who know The Hulk could be so so so funny! Real...but still funny. Another starlit moment can be given to the added intrigue of The Black Widow/Natassia and her dark past to the team as cleverly played by Scarlett Johansson (The Prestige, The Island, Iron man 2).For me there was one `throw-away' character The Hawkeye/Clint played by Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Town, MI4:Ghost Protocol). Not really vital to the story or the team...but he was honestly performed and he did have a few cool gadgets. Other characters returned like Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Pots and Paul Betteny as JARVIS both the assistants of Billionaire Tony Stark (although one is a computer).The movie was edited extremely well...you can follow all the action and the Alan Silvestri (Back To the Future, Forest Gump, Night At The Museum) score gets you pumped up and going. Again this is a greta fun and funny film for the whole family. Technically up to speed that you'll be amazed at the gadgets and you'll never be taking your eyes of the screen!

The action is very creative and, as expected, Robert Downey Jr steals the show. Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job in a rather subdued role. The Harry Dean Stanton cameo was very well done and shows that he still has it as a character actor.The bits with Scarlett Johansson were creative and fun. They turned the usual ""weak hero getting lectured by the villian"" bit on its head. That sort of thing is the best method for putting a heroic character over in a film. The villian gets his bluster lines, but then is shown to have been outsmarted and ends up looking foolish. Few films (for decades) have managed to get that simple thing right. The actors playing Thor and Captain America also did a good job. The bit with Loki in Europe established the Captain America character in a good way in a short amount of film time and avoided what could have been the annoying aspects of a lecturing patriotic character. Thor was all about the action as it should have been. They managed to figure out a way to make the Hawkeye character (an archer) actually work. The bits with the bow as a close-up weapon were a great idea.The things that don't work so well:Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury however doesn't work. There is too much of him and I dont know that using him to bring the group together in the story was necessary. It would have been better for him to be more incidental than constantly at the core of things. The whole the-government-can't-be-trusted subplot was a predictable waste of time.They spent too much time with followup characters from previous films. It didn't add much of anything really.The alien invasion characters were all rather bland and cookie cutter looking. Making everything grey chrome and mostly identical was a rather odd choice. It got to a point where it seemed like there were two CGI models that they just kept using over and over again. It might have been better to give some of the aliens more of a personality rather than having them be bugs squashed one after the other.Five stars within its genre.

1211085,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001KVZ6HK,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Nearly everyone at one time or another has read a comic book. More often than not we associate those drawn color images with our childhood and leave it at that. The fact is that comics are no longer a source of entertainment for children for the most part, instead covering topics like drug addiction, alcoholism, homosexuality and more. Yes, there are comics made for children but not the majority. But at the core of these comics, beneath the surface issues of the day, is the basic fact that the core of them all involves heroes. And through the trials and tribulations various writers put their characters through that is always what we come back to.Marvel Comics nearly went under until the early sixties when they began telling stories that involved more the more realistic aspects of life. Because of that a new form of hero was born, one that had problems and lived in the real world when not wearing a cape. Fans loved these stories so when it came time to turn them into movies of course Hollywood messed it up, turning its back on what fans loved; until recently when fans flocked to see Robert Downey starring as Iron Man.But that was only the beginning of a long term plan at Marvel. Those that learned remained in their seats as the credits finished to catch a teaser for something coming down the line. It happened again and again after each Marvel character movie from the Hulk to Captain America. It was all leading to the first team up movie involving comic book characters. It was leading to THE AVENGERS.If you haven't seen this film by all means run out and buy a copy today. This is not just a rental movie, this is a film that can be enjoyed over and over again, allowing you to catch new things each time you watch as well as enjoy the things you loved the first time around. For me it is the best comic book movie ever made and the only bad part is having to wait until the next Avengers outing.The story revolves around the Tessaract, an energy source discovered at the end of the Captain America film. The top secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate) has been trying to figure out how to harness the power of this object. That all changes when it suddenly opens a portal to another world allowing Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the Asgardian God of mischief and sworn enemy of his half brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth), to enter. Loki uses a staff to control the minds of scientist Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and top agent Clint ""Hawkeye"" Barton (Jeremy Renner). They escape with the Tessaract and force the hand of S.H.I.E.L.D. head Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) to engage the Avengers Project.The project is an assemblage of various super heroes, people with abilities above the norm, to unite as a team to take on any problem considered too large for normal channels to handle. The first group that Fury assembles includes agent Natasha ""Black Widow"" Romanov (Scarlett Johannson) who recruits scientist Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) who turns into the Hulk. Captain America (Chris Evans) has been kept with Fury in preparation for this moment. Lastly they ask Tony Stark (Robert Downey) aka Iron Man.Facing off against Loki he is captured but on the way back the team's airship is attacked by none other than Thor. A knock down drag out fight follows between Thor and Iron Man until Captain America breaks it up. With Thor on the team now, they take Loki back to the hellicarrier (an item that needs seen to be believed) for safe keeping. Unfortunately this doesn't end up being a good idea.Selvig in the meantime has found a way to harness the Tessaract and open the portal to a far off galaxy that allows their army to enter our world. This was Loki's plan all along. Trust me this is no spoiler as scenes of the final battle were in nearly every trailer for the film before it opened. With Hawkeye rescued and now a part of the team will these seven heroes be enough to prevent an all out invasion of the planet? And will each member of the team be able to face their own personal demons and become the hero that he/she is destined to be?This movie rocks like no other. The witty retorts, the campy lines when needed, the suspense of what will happen next fluctuate from scene to scene and keep you waiting to see what will happen next. Director Joss Whedon of BUFFY fame has put together a movie that brings a depth to the characters and story that mingle together to form a story movie that is filled with amazing special effects but effects that don't overshadow what is taking place.The acting by all involved is amazing and each actor takes their turn at making their character believable. You watch and never question if Evans is really Captain America or if Hawkeye can really shoot arrows this way. You just believe. If any one stands out in particular it's Downey. He just commands attention every time he comes into view. His quips are some of the best and suit his character. Having been the first of this group to star as his character it's only natural.The entertainment value of this movie is astronomical. From start to finish you'll sit at the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. Even side characters are given special moments here. There is never a dull moment in this film.One last note: as with all Marvel movies, even this movie has a secret ending to it. As a matter of fact it has two. The first comes early during the credits, the second after all the credits have finished. Stick around and watch both. Rumor has it that one of them will bleed over into the next Thor film. Iron Man 3 is nearly done filming. And the Avengers will return soon. One can only wait with anticipation until it arrives. .",5,THE AVENGERS: THE STUFF HEROES ARE MADE OF,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,5718,"['Nearly', 'everyone', 'one', 'time', 'read', 'comic', 'book',

Only Whedon could bring his patented 9 characters in one room conversational expertise to a scene and make it not only clear and informative but funny and poignant all at once. Lots of things blow up and super heroes fly and some of the action stuff annoyed me by being too typical (huge things fly out of the sky by the hundreds to destroy Manhattan and our heroes just stand there staring. Civilians are dumb cattle who hide inside, then go stare out huge glass windows like targets. Etc.)  but overall it's great because it's about the characters as flawed, real people who happen to have special skills that make them exceptional.

WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN!?!?!?!?!?!Seriously... those movies are a MUST for you to understand the entire story of The Avengers.Now anyone who knows me knows I am a huge Marvel junkie... was from way back in the day when I collected comics. I am VERY PICKY about the way the Marvel superhero movies are done.I was extremely please with all the Iron Man movies, Thor, and even the 2nd Hulk movie... not a huge lover of the first Hulk movie or Captain America but at least Captain America was tolerable compared to that first Hulk movie (Eric Bana is bad Hulk!)I love Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Every movie he plays this role in seems to me he's getting better at being Tony Stark. I love Chris Hemsworth as Thor. I can tolerate Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. I like Chris Evans... that's why I saw Captain America even though I am not a huge Captain America fan. I am extremely delighted in Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye cause he really looks the part and his acting is always spot on. Tom Hiddleston as Loki... flawless as always (I just wanna hug Loki for some reason).Where my major concern was ... was of course, where most fans concern was, THE HULK aka BRUCE BANNER. Mark Ruffalo plays this part... and he NAILS it. I mean, he reminded me of Bill Bixby in the original TV version of The Hulk. I was SO pleased that the Hulk finally got someone RIGHT to play his part. And then ... HULK SMASH... and The Hulk says some stuff... I was SO pleased that someone finally got The Hulk right on screen.Even if that someone was someone I am essentially mad at... by the name of JOSS WHEDON. Ah, Joss Whedon, he who killed BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER for me by season 4 of the series with all the story line BS of ""the key"" and Buffy going all psycho... yes... THAT Joss Whedon. So, he is behind one of the BEST Superhero movies I have ever seen. Gah. And I have to ADMIT THAT? Ok, Joss, you win this round. Still mad about some things from Buffy... but when it comes to Superhero movies... you did the Avengers some TRUE justice... so thank you.This movie is everything that a MARVEL/AVENGERS fan would want. And with the ending... a promise perhaps of a sequel?!?!? *crosses fingers*I saw The Avengers in 3D (it's my first EVER 3D movie since I was 3 and saw King Kong). I recommend seeing it this way because it was totally awesome from start to finish... a little hard to keep up with SOME of the action in some parts but it was WELL worth it for the effect of it all.Overall, I think this is the Superhero movie of the year... if not DECADE. We superhero fans have been waiting for this... and it's everything promised and then some (great awesome HULK funny moments too). I won't ruin the movie AT ALL for you... SEE IT...

It was saved from being the most deadly dull action movie I've ever seen by Mark Ruffalo - an actor I've found, in the past, to be pleasant enough, but nothing spectacular.  His character has a few throw away lines that are done in the pithy, snarky manner I think the others were trying for throughout the film, but failed to achieve.

This movie adapts the avengers in a decent enough manner with fantastic huuge budget effects and top notch actors. The 3d is great and very few scenes have ghosting, like lets say 'dial m for murder does'.  It's a good comic book movie like most of the marvel comic movies. I would state though that the comics are actually better! If your kids aren't reading them that's a shame.  And alot of libraries have them in book form for you to read. The package comes with a unneeded digital copy and a dvd?, we don't need dvds with blu rays as it drives up the price. The blu ray has the extra features on it so you need that copy.

1211154,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B001KVZ6HK,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[5, 9]","It's pretty clear that Marvel's entire film-making machine was leading up to this effort, a movie that nobody thought could be made because it involved Hollywood putting aside egos, directors joining forces, and intellectual property being leveraged in such a way that everyone plays nicely together behind the scenes, even if the characters don't play nicely together on screen.  Somehow, God bless them, Marvel actually pulled it off.Picking up where ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" and ""Iron Man"" left off, the Strategic Homeland, Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (SHIELD) led by Nicky Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), commands a ragtag band of agents that just happen to work on a flying aircraft carrier: Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders, unfortunately miscast), Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner, not quite as sarcastic as he should be) as Hawkeye, and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johnannson) as Black Widow. Their mission is to retrieve the Tesseract (AKA the Cosmic Cube) from Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his Predator-like race of alien soldiers known as the Chitauri.There are so many ways this film could have gone wrong, and part of ""The Avengers""' success is that Marvel took its time building up to this moment with its previous releases. Asgardian god-hero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) could easily become a walking caricature, but he's such a tower presence that he demands to be taken seriously. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) as Captain America is slightly diminished here, but he settles comfortably into his role as a brilliant tactician out of time but not out of his depth. All these serious characters are just banter-fodder for Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) as Iron Man, who shamelessly stirs things up when things goes down.  The one worrisome character was Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) as the Hulk. With two tepid films under the character's belt, the Hulk was potentially ""The Avengers"" weakest link.No need to worry.  The Hulk is one of the best parts of the film.  Ruffalo plays Banner as a scruffy Doctor Without Borders, a brilliant man who gives off a zen vibe because you wouldn't like him when he's angry. Joss Whedon, master director of all things geeky, knows how to build up anticipation.  Whether it's the massive firepower that's never brought to bear against Banner or the trembling lip of the deadly Black Widow, we're always reminded that at any moment ""The Big Guy"" might show up. When the Hulk finally does arrive, he does not disappoint; the Hulk's rage is exhilarating and terrifying to behold, a green King Kong. Also, the Hulk's got a great sense of humor, embodied by his rivalry with the only guy who can stand up to him, Thor.Whedon does an excellent job of balancing the weaker characters, notably Black Widow and Hawkeye, against the superbeings who stride amongst them. Black Widow has two scenes that demonstrate how deadly she really is even against god-like beings, and Hawkeye's archery is unparalleled. There are not one but two tracking shots in which every character struts their stuff.  If you go to ""The Avengers"" film to see them duke it out, against each other and alien monsters, you've come to the right place. This is going to be hard to top.And oh yeah...shawarma is a real food.

I've watched it, and the characters' own movies leading up to and since this film a great many times and still always enjoy them fully.  Marvel's The Avengers unites Captain America, Hawkeye, Iron Man, Thor, the Black Widow, and the Incredible Hulk (through the manipulations of Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.) in this rambunctious adventure that pits the heroes against Thor's half-brother Loki (&#34;he's adopted&#34;, as Thor notes at one point), and his force of alien invaders, the Chitauri.  Of course, the characters' egos get in the way at the start of the movie, and it is only after a few dust-ups and unforeseen develops that they finally are able to see past their own powers and unite to fight the enemy - including neutralizing some unexpected antagonists.  The plot has multiple layers and subplots that also allows the revelation of each character's background story as it develops.  Just like the old Marvel comics I read as a boy events occurring in previous movies contribute to this story, and this story ends with hints of things to come, including an ominous revelation of one of Marvel's greatest bad guys involvement in possible a great deal more in the Avengers' and other characters' own storylines.  There is quite a bit of humor mixed in with Cosmic Drama - including no small amount of insider jokes, and some pokes at the heroes themselves. There are, of course, some differences in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as opposed to the reality as presented in the comics themselves, and even greater differences compared to the books from my youth, including some of the costuming and character origins, but there is no really significant loss.

1211178,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B001KVZ6HK,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Chances are, if you are looking at this page you have probably already seen the movie.  For any who have not, here goes.  First, you have to be a fan of superhero movies.  If they do nothing for you in general, this one probably will not do anything for you either.  That part of it is totally subjective, and nothing I say will sway you either way.If you are a fan of them, especially Iron Man, you will love this.  This can almost be considered Iron Man 2.5, given that off all the characters Robert Downey Jr. is probably in the movie the most, either as Iron Man or Tony Stark.  Even so, I think a good job was done giving the other characters enough screen time that no single character was the focus of the movie.  It is like the cast an ensemble.  The movie also presumes that you know the back stories as told in Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor, Captain America, and to a lesser extent The Incredible Hulk.  Not that you have to see any of those movies to grasp the concept, but it will help in knowing who the bad guy is, and how all the characters came to be.I liked the addition of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.  Even though I thought Edward Norton did a good job with the character, and would not have minded seeing him come back, given what he was rumored to be like on his Hulk movie I am not surprised that he was replaced.  One thing I did like about Ruffalo, is you can buy him as a normal guy.  He is not physically imposing like Chris Evans (to some extent) and Chris Hemsworth are, yet you bought by the way he played the character that he was dangerous.  I admit that I was, as a fan of the Hulk TV series, skeptical of a CGI Hulk.  It was not done all that well in the first Hulk movie (the forgettable one with Eric Bana) but has got better over time. And since Hulk is supposed to be 9ft tall, the only way to pull that off is CGI.  Plus they can make him move like no real person can.The script was very well done, which as any Joss Whedon fans can tell you was no surprise.  He brought the same blend of action, drama and humor (mostly involving the Hulk in the last 1/3 of the movie) that he did on his TV shows. I think it was written assuming the audience is smart and wanted a good story and good acting, and did not just rely on action, explosions and eye candy.  As I said, if you like the genre, you are most likely going to love this movie.  It looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, and is definitely worth a spot in your collection.",5,Love the movie,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,2455,"['Chances', 'are', 'are', 'looking', 'page', 'have', 'probably', 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'here', 'First', 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'superhero', 'movies', 'do', 'nothing', 'general', 'one', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'part', 'totally', 'subjective', 'nothing', 'say', 'will', 'sway', 'way.If', 'are', 'fan', 'especially', 'Iron', 'Man', 'will', 'love', 'can', 'almost', 'be', 'considered', 'Iron', 'Man', '2.5', 'given', 'characters', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'probably', 'movie', 'most', 'either', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Even', 'so', 'think', 'good', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'giving', 'other', 'characters', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'single', 'character', 'was', 'focus', 'movie', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'movie', 'also', 'know', 'back', 'stories', 'told', 'Iron', 'Man', '1', '2', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Not', 'have', 'see', 'movies', 'grasp', 'concept', 'will', 'help', 'knowing', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'how', 'characters', 'came', 'be.I', 'liked', 'addition', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Even', 'thought', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'character', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'minded', 'seeing', 'come', 'back', 'given', 'what', 'was', 'rumored', 'be', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'was', 'replaced', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'like', 'Ruffalo', 'can', 'buy', 'normal', 'guy', 'not', 'physically', 'imposing', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'extent', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'are', 'yet', 'bought', 'way', 'played', 'character', 'was', 'dangerous', 'admit', 'was', 'fan', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'series', 'skeptical', 'CGI', 'Hulk', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'well', 'first', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'forgettable', 'one', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'got', 'better', 'time', 'Hulk', 'supposed', 'be', '9ft', 'tall', 'only', 'way', 'pull', 'off', 'CGI', 'can', 'make', 'move', 'real', 'person', 'can.The', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'fans', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'surprise', 'brought', 'same', 'blend', 'action', 'drama', 'humor', 'mostly', 'involving', 'Hulk', 'last', '1/3', 'movie', 'did', 'TV', 'shows', 'think', 'was', 'written', 'assuming', 'audience', 'smart', 'wanted', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'rely', 'action', 'explosions', 'eye', 'candy', 'said', 'like', 'genre', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'love', 'movie', 'great', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'definitely', 'worth', 'spot', 'collection']",Marvel's: The Avengers

1211186,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001KVZ6HK,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","Marvel Comics' ""The Avengers"" brings together 7 superheroes, 4 of whom have had their own films, to combat a global threat. Scientists with the S.H.I.E.L.D. organization are trying to find an unlimited source of energy locked within an alien Tesseract. But it is emitting unusual energy surges, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), errant brother of the Asgardian Thor, comes through the Tesseract from ""the other end of space"". Using his scepter, Loki forcibly converts Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgrd) and Agent Clint ""Hawkeye"" Barton (Jeremy Renner) to his cause and absconds with the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) assembles the extraordinary individuals to form the Avengers, at Director Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) request. Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Dr. David ""Hulk"" Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must prevent Loki from bringing an alien army to conquer Earth.It seems that, with so many superheroes in play, there must be a comparably grandiose enemy. Loki personifies foolish ambition, but he is being used by the otherworldly leader of the alien armies, who happens to look like the Grim Reaper. The fight is over Earth, in its entirety. ""The Avengers"" runs too long at 2 hours 23 minutes, but that is almost inevitable given the need to introduce so many characters to an audience who may not be familiar with them. I've only seen 4 of these characters in a movie before, but I could gather enough about the others over the course of ""The Avengers"" that I was not lost. It's a challenge for director Joss Whedon to get enough backstory, character development, and action into theatrical movie with 8 larger-than-life characters. And this was only his second feature film. Whedon is, or was, a television writer and director who became involved in the project through a long-standing friendship with producer Kevin Feige.The Avengers spend too much time fighting technical difficulties and fighting each other -for reasons which are, at best, weak- rather than fighting the enemy. When that giant aircraft carrier that S.H.I.E.L.D. uses as a base ascends into the sky, well, one could guess that it might have trouble staying there. Is this really something our superheroes should spend their energies on? Some of those action sequences were not integrated well enough into the story: action for the sake of action. ""The Avengers"" is not perfect. But Mark Ruffalo is the best Dr. David Banner yet. He is a man who has mastered the art of calm, reluctantly, because he holds passionate views. He copes well with the constant threat of Hulk but is always in conflict with himself. Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson is a strong character but also brings an indispensable ""everyman"" perspective to the superhero show. Robert Downey, Jr. is always entertaining as Tony Stark. ""The Avengers"" has a lot of territory to cover with these characters, and it generally succeeds and entertains, with good humor.The DVD (Paramount 2012 single disc edition): There are 2 bonus features on the single disc edition. ""Assembling the Ultimate Team"" (8 min) interviews director Joss Whedon and the actors about characters and casting. There is an audio commentary by Joss Whedon which is constant and informative. He talks about locations, story structure, challenges of shooting, conveying the Marvel universe on film, what he put in versus what he left out, writing while shooting, his decisions, and scene-by scene commentary.

It delivers the goods that you expect to see from an action film. It's really the first of its kind in that after watching all the other superhero movies and having their subtle scenes to link each other together, that these (certain) Marvel movie heroes are brought together in one film. It's like getting all the superheroes under one roof for the same price.The reason I say its (so far) the best superhero movie, is simply because out of all the awesome superhero movies made... this one *feels* like a comic book come to life. Don't get me wrong, The Dark Knight trilogy is spectacular in its own right (and Batman is my favorite character), but we get something else with Avengers. Its action packed and filled with thrills, and each film connecting together pays off.Visuals are some of the best on blu-ray. The transfer is incredible and top notch with bright pops, nice color, and deep black (the beginning of the film however is a bit crushing in black detail). I normally like my movies to be presented with their original aspect ratio. In the theaters Avengers was shown as 1.85:1 and instead we get 1.78:1, but that just means the content fits a 16:9 hdtv without tiny black bars. Have a surround sound system?

1211189,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B001KVZ6HK,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 0]","I actually read Mark Millar's ""The Ultimates Omnibus"" which had a very similar tale to the movie but changed some things which I felt made it more interesting than the film. That said, the film is still awesome enough per my grade below.Many of the Marvel superheroes who had their individual movies are now brought together when Nick Fury (played by Samuel Jackson) using the ""Avenger's Initiative"" to call them up during a crisis related to the Tesseract (an all powerful energy source among other things) which eventually leads to showing the Avengers going from disjointed to united and especially so in the last part as Earth has to deal with an invasion from aliens. Who else but the Avengers is going to save us?It's an all star ensemble playing various Marvel heroes and mortals (who all get their little personal scenes before they join the big story): Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Hulk, Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow, Jeremy Ranner as Hawkeye, Chris Hemsworth as Thor. Clarke Gregg as Phil Caulson, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Paul Bettany as Jarvis and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper. Yes, that's the voice of the old Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, and look for the usual Stan Lee cameo.One of the greatest strengths is surprisingly in the characters and how they show their different views on getting the job done. Compare Iron Man (a la Tony Stark character) to Captain America (a la Steve Rogers character) when they begin their big argument. I'd say the best presentations were a tie between the ""new"" guy, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr., the ""old"" guy of the Marvel films. Also, as far as supporting cast go I was quite impressed with how they developed and presented the character of Phil Caulson (played by Clarke Gregg). Note that I am basing this on an action superhero movie, not character driven tales, so it's a bit of a curve you could argue.Action was over the top and flirted at the borderline of losing the audience to special effects but I felt they pulled it off well enough.Hardcore purists might argue that Hulk should be the only unstoppable force followed by Thor but I'm just getting into the Marvel comics so I can't fully comment. All of the heroes got to be awesome and that's what one would expect from the all star cast. They aren't going to agree to play a lame or non memorable character, right? Another viable criticism by said group is that the Avengers were not formed in the movie way but most people probably don't mind.The budget for this picture was $220M and it made over $1.5B at the Box Office. A sequel is naturally expected. Stay after the credits for the two teasers. That's pretty much something you need to do after every Marvel fan these days, I suppose.Trivia and spoilers below.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B plus; ACTION SCENES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of October 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.TRIVIA (IMDB sources): Edward Norton was originally set to reprise his role from The Incredible Hulk but negotiations between him and Marvel Studios broke down. Norton was replaced with Mark Ruffalo.According to Joss Whedon, the film is strongly influenced by the early 1960s Avengers comics, which he was a fan of while growing up: ""In those comics these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team - and that is the definition of family.""This film holds an unusually high number of Academy Award nominees in the cast/crew for a comic book movie, or most movies for that matter: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, director Joss Whedon, and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, possibly many others. This tops Iron Man 2, and Iron Man which each had four nominees a piece.According to director Joss Whedon, the original cut of the movie was over 3 hours long. About 30 minutes of the excised footage are included on the Blu-ray, most of which revolves around Steve Rogers (Captain America). Whedon revealed that one of these scenes involved Rogers struggling to adjust to the modern world in his Brooklyn apartment and another revealed Steve Rogers' reunion with Peggy Carter, his love interest from Captain America: The First Avenger. Chris Evans has since announced that the deleted scenes with Captain America will be used for Captain America: The Winter Soldier.To prepare for the role of Agent Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Jeremy Renner was trained by Olympic archers.After Thor takes Loki off the Quinjet down on the mountain side, two large ravens fly by them as they are talking. In Norse mythology, their father, Odin, had two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who would bring Odin information from Midgard (Earth).The twelfth film to surpass the $1 billion mark worldwide, and the tenth to surpass the $400 million mark in the USA. It tied with Avatar and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 for surpassing the $1 billion mark worldwide in the fastest time (19 days) and set the record of surpassing the $400 million mark in the USA (14 days).Amanda Peet was considered for the role of Agent Maria Hill.Loki's staff which has a glowing blue gem in the spear head that allows him to control the minds of others is a reference to the Mind Gem. One of the seven Infinity Gems used by Thanos, who is the character shown in the post-credits scene to be the leader of the Chitauri.SPOILERS: I thought Thor broke the portal between Earth and his homeland so how did he return? I know how Loki returned but it seemed as if Thor was already hanging out on Earth before that incident. BTW, what happened to the Natalie Portman character?Hulk had the funniest action scenes, especially when he picked Loki up and beat him to a pulp. Loved it!Thor is a God, not a demigod per the picture. Was that said to satisfy the religious types who don't want ""pagan"" Gods being called, well, God?Most fans wanted to see Thor go at it with Ironman and Captain America and then at a later point with Thor. You got it. I would recommend you also check out the graphic novel I mentioned above.I liked the Thanos teaser and I'm curious to see what they will do with him in Avengers 2.",5,MY GRADE: B plus to A

In reality, 99% of the franchise flops at the end, to name a few, Rocky, Back to the Future in the past, even new series like Twilight, LOTR, in a way, they left you a taste decline on every new one that you see.But not this movie, The Avengers, it work as an pentalogy but you can't call it a Pentalogy because the first 4 weren't prequel but they holds the prequel effect, in reality you can't appreciate this movie unless you've seen the other 4 or at least a couple of them. That's how it work. So this movie actually is built on a new way to produce franchise movies. There were the setups, and there is the feast.I was surprise how they contain each element so good, from beginning to the end, every 5 minutes were break down to be a winner, I can't seem to even find a scene that I would feel sorry for the film makers, the lines are hilourious at times, with good taste.

1211201,A3G4MPMSA9T3HK,B001KVZ6HK,M. Mierendorf,"[2, 2]","Sitting in the theater during The Avengers (2012) was unlike many previous theater experiences I've had. I sat with a grin squeezing my wife's hand in joy. Pardon the clich&eacute;, but I felt like a kid in a candy store. If you read Cultural Transmogrifier`s Staff Discussion, you know the expectations I and the staff had. They were quite high to say the least. I was more than pleased with the results and my expectations were more than met.Joss Whedon felt like an inspired choice for director when it was announced a few years ago, and I stand by that. Whedon and Zak Penn's story, and Whedon's screenplay, translates to an Avengers comic come to life. Simply put, The Avengers  is one of the best comic book adaptations ever made.Building off the success of the previous character films, Whedon was able to jump right into things with this story. I will only briefly and vaguely touch base on the specifics because I don't want to spoil anything. If you haven't seen the previous character films you won't be totally lost, but there are a few things that will just gloss right over you. The basic story revolves around the tesseract--an extraterrestrial source of unlimited power. It's under the control of S.H.I.E.L.D. and they're running tests on it under the guidance of Selvig (Stellan Skarsgrd). Learning that the tesseract is a portal device, we witness the reentrance of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to Earth.Loki is working with an extraterrestrial race hellbent on bringing Earth to its knees. It's hinted that Loki is not merely the powerful messenger, but the leader of this new army. The only ones who stand in his way are the Avengers, who are brought together through various circumstances and thrust together in the final act by one significant character . . . moment. (Anyone familiar with Whedon will understand this.)Every question I had about what our characters were doing between their own films and this one were answered in one way or another. The cast continues to be excellent. Most will give the nod to Robert Downey Jr., but I think a special spotlight should shine on Chris Evans. His portrayal of Captain America is ideal. He is still the super solider of the early 1940s, and despite being out of time and out of place, the leader within is clearly there.The struggle to establish the team mentality of The Avengers is a joy to watch. Each character is perfectly written, self-aware, and aware of each other's flaws--which they are quick to point out. FINALLY, I think the Hulk/ Bruce Banner have been written correctly and expertly. Watching Hulk smash is just so awesome! The Avengers is filled with just the right amount of exposition, action, story, and best yet, humor. Just when you need a breather, Whedon offers it up and tosses in a wonderfully written joke delivered by almost every single character in the film.Without detailing anything else, just know that when this movie ends, it doesn't really end. Most people know that Marvel likes to add a ""stinger"" at the end of the credits, an extra scene to tease about a future film. This is no different. In fact, The Avengers offers two such scenes. (The first one--I called it! See our Staff Discussion for proof). Make sure you stay in your seats until the theater lights go fully up and the screen turns off. Any sooner and you'll miss out. 30% of the audience left before the first tease, 95% were gone before the final one. Don't be that person! Trust me, after a somewhat exhausting 2 hours and 22 minutes, that final scene is just what the Captain ordered.",4,`The Avengers' Knocks It Out Of The Park,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,3551,"['Sitting', 'theater', 'Avengers', '2012', 'was', 'many', 'previous', 'theater', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'sat', 'grin', 'squeezing', 'wife', 'hand', 'joy', 'Pardon', 'clich', 'eacute', 'felt', 'kid', 'candy', 'store', 'read', 'Cultural', 'Transmogrifier', 's', 'Staff', 'Discussion', 'know', 'expectations', 'staff', 'had', 'were', 'quite', 'high', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'more', 'pleased', 'results', 'expectations', 'were', 'more', 'met.Joss', 'Whedon', 'felt', 'inspired', 'choice', 'director', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'stand', 'Whedon', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'story', 'Whedon', 'screenplay', 'Avengers', 'comic', 'come', 'life', 'Simply', 'put', 'Avengers', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'ever', 'made.Building', 'off', 'success', 'previous', 'character', 'films', 'Whedon', 'was', 'able', 'jump', 'right', 'things', 'story', 'will', 'only', 'briefly', 'vaguely', 'touch', 'base', 'specifics', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'previous', 'character', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'totally', 'lost', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'will', 'just', 'gloss', 'right', 'basic', 'story', 'revolves', 'tesseract', 'extraterrestrial', 'source', 'unlimited', 'power', 'control', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', ""'re"", 'running', 'tests', 'guidance', 'Selvig', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'Learning', 'tesseract', 'portal', 'device', 'witness', 'reentrance', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Earth.Loki', 'working', 'extraterrestrial', 'race', 'hellbent', 'bringing', 'Earth', 'knees', 'hinted', 'Loki', 'not', 'merely', 'powerful', 'messenger', 'leader', 'new', 'army', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'stand', 'way', 'are', 'Avengers', 'who', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'various', 'circumstances', 'thrust', 'together', 'final', 'act', 'one', 'significant', 'character', 'moment', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'Whedon', 'will', 'understand', 'question', 'had', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'doing', 'own', 'films', 'one', 'were', 'answered', 'one', 'way', 'cast', 'be', 'excellent', 'Most', 'will', 'give', 'nod', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'think', 'special', 'spotlight', 'should', 'shine', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'portrayal', 'Captain', 'America', 'ideal', 'still', 'super', 'solider', 'early', '1940s', 'being', 'time', 'place', 'leader', 'clearly', 'there.The', 'struggle', 'establish', 'team', 'mentality', 'Avengers', 'joy', 'watch', 'character', 'perfectly', 'written', 'self-aware', 'aware', 'other', 'flaws', 'are', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'FINALLY', 'think', 'Hulk/', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'correctly', 'expertly', 'Watching', 'Hulk', 'smash', 'just', 'so', 'awesome', 'Avengers', 'filled', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'exposition', 'action', 'story', 'best', 'yet', 'humor', 'Just', 'when', 'need', 'breather', 'Whedon', 'up', 'tosses', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'joke', 'delivered', 'almost', 'single', 'character', 'film.Without', 'detailing', 'anything', 'else', 'just', 'know', 'when', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'end', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'Marvel', 'add', 'stinger', 'end', 'credits', 'extra', 'scene', 'tease', 'future', 'film', 'different', 'fact', 'Avengers', 'offers', 'two', 'such', 'scenes', 'first', 'one', 'called', 'See', 'Staff', 'Discussion', 'proof', 'Make', 'sure', 'stay', 'seats', 'theater', 'lights', 'go', 'fully', 'up', 'screen', 'off', 'sooner', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'out', '30', '%', 'audience', 'left', 'first', 'tease', '95', '%', 'were', 'gone', 'final', 'one', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'person', 'Trust', 'somewhat', 'exhausting', '2', 'hours', '22', 'minutes', 'final', 'scene', 'just', 'what', 'Captain', 'ordered']",Marvel's: The Avengers

Whoever gets his hands on such source of endless power would enslave the world.The greatest strength in the movie was the visual effects and animation that depicts dark energy as a contained medium is a cube of the size of a hand that emits powerful beams of radiation, which dissipate the atmosphere of the earth, opening a hole to the outerspace.  Through that hole, supernatural creatures send their army of monsters and soldiers to wreak havoc on New York City.The plot was shady. The moviemaker stretched the plot between America, Germany, Russia, and India for no good reason other than to fill empty time slots. Apparently, the movie's plot was intended for fast profit with little emphasis on leaving behind a legacy on how dark energy could benefit mankind beside being abused by deities bent on enslaving mankind.Few of the characters loved and believed in their roles such as Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), and agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). Those characters eased the sloppiness in the movie plot and made most of the scenarios believably entertaining. Those talented actors/ actresses indulging into their characters leave unforgettable memories attached to the narration of the story.Among the artificially fake performances were: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), which spewed the same nonsense by displaying imagery projections in the air, then grabbed those images as material objects, in addition to Downey mechanical attempts to display genius. A single actor who rises above the movie script in order to brag about his arrogance, in repeated movies, took away the innovation from the Avengers. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) was also a misfit with his hunched upper back and unattractive facial expressions. Every time the focus shifted towards Dr. Hulk, annoying softness is felt in his role and the way he executes it.Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) slipped far below his impressive role in the movie Charlestown. In the Avengers, Renner's performance was impulsive and stereotypical.Even in a science fiction movie, stepping out of reality requires diligence in transforming the mindset of the viewers of rational observation into fictitious realms. The sudden change of Bruce Banner/Hulk into a monster was inconvenient as it represent a desperate attempt to maintain the flow of events in a sloppy plot. In contrast, the impressive performances by Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) rendered their roles engaging.The most exciting part in the movie was the battle of Manhattan where monstrous creatures slammed into skyscrapers and busy streets of the most famous city in the world.Without the odd characters of the bodybuilder Hulk and the fake and imposing Iron Man, the battle of Manhattan would have been more memorable.Mohamed F.

1211210,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B001KVZ6HK,M. Oleson,"[3, 6]","Like most guys, I grew up with comic books, albeit before Marvel came along.  I loved most of the DC comics led by Superman and Batman but also a more obscure crew known as the ""Blackhawks.""  They were a group of mortals from various countries who came together to fight evil.  DC would often have collaborations as well, bringing Flash, The Green Lantern into the mix, eventually becoming the Justice League of America.  Marvel Comics came along in about 1967 to challenge DC with a new cast of characters, many of which are gathered in this movie.Guided by one of the great up-and-coming director/writers of the day, Joss Whedon (""Cabin in the Woods"", ""Serenity"") is the perfect director for this sure to be blockbuster.  Admittedly I liked the previous Marvel films leading up to this big group hug, especially ""Ironman.""  Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn manage to inject plenty of humor to offset what could be the possible destruction of mankind.  Loki (Tom Hiddleston, ""War Horse"") returns as Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) adopted brother and drops in on Earth from their alternate world to capture a glowing energy source known as the Tesseract.  Naturally he and his ugly henchmen know as the Chitauri have evil intent but need the Tesseract and/or a fuel source known as iridium to fully open the portal to get them there.Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) leads a group known as S.H.I.E.L.D which has been established to defend Earth from alien visitors including those like Loki's crew.  Over time (and several previous movies) Fury and his top agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) have co-opted Thor, Ironman (always good Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers, AKA Capt. America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and now Bruce Banner, AKA The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) into the fold.  Whedon manages to keep us on the edge of our seat with explosive confrontations between the super heroes as we wait patiently for The Hulk to get pissed off enough to show his destructive self.One of the big surprises was the appearance of Cobie Smulders who smolders as Agent Hill, Fury's top military aide.  Ms. Smulders, perhaps best known for TV's ""How I Met Your Mother,"" looks great with a bloody face, packed into black leatherette and kicking bad guy ass.  I expect we'll be seeing more of her in the movies.  Even at 2 hours, 22 minutes the film moves along briskly for the most part.  The ultimate concluding battle is pretty much what we can expect.  The invading Chitaurians have quick moving space-sleds as well as huge metallic worm-like creatures/machines that far outnumber our heroes.  Still, we have The Hulk.

They combined elements from the different Marvel movies and made a complete story out of it. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the Hulk all get their moments to shine. You get your Iron Man vs. Thor and Hulk vs. Thor fights. That's just a taste of what is to come during the last thirty minutes of pure destruction. The CGI is top of the line and the action scenes are really great, but the movie never forgets that a good story and solid laughs are just as important as all the pretty explosions. The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (full of snappy dialogue) is as good as it gets. The Hulk is finally done right. Not too big and just the right amount of scary. Funny that he gets the two biggest laughs in the movie. I even thought that the character Loki was a much better and more menacing villain here than in Thor.

1211218,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B001KVZ6HK,Moon Donkey,"[4, 16]","Just when I'd thought I couldn't watch anything dumber, I found this gem.The positive reviews for this film have shaken my faith in humanity.  At the time of this review, there are only a bit over 100 1 star reviews, and it appears most of those are negative due to technical issues... many are not based on the actual filmWell... let's start with utterly worthless superheroes: The Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America.The Black Widow - what good is she?  She does what?  We see an alien army coming out of a space portal and the best she can do is stand there with a couple pistols?  She is worthless.Hawkeye - just one step above The Black Widow.  The guy's superpower is what?  He is a good shot with a bow?  And he attempts to stop an alien invasion by shooting arrows at them?  He is worthless.Captain America - I guess he is a really good guy with a shield or something?  Heaven forbid the guy ever pick up a gun... can't have that I guess.  In order to make him seem useful, the Captain sort of takes a leadership role and gives out orders to the other Avengers.  Just one step less worthless than Hawkeye.Ok... on to the others...The Hulk - Uhhhh... someone explain to me why he can't control himself when he attacks The Black Widow but he is in perfect control during the alien invasion?  How does that work?  Also, wasn't there some suggestion that Loki wanted to get at the Hulk for some reason?  Was that ever explained?Thor - I guess being a demi-god qualifies as having some powers.  Of course, it also makes you wonder why The Black Widow and Hawkeye are so special.  Anyway - so why can't Thor break out of the prison container Loki traps him in?  Because it might fall?  That's the big trick?  Don't try to break out or it will fall?Iron Man - probably the only sensible superhero in the group.  You can explain his character and his powers.Question - the secret flying aircraft carrier engages a cloaking device when it takes off out of the water.  What happens to it?  Do they turn it off again right away?  The next time we see the ship it isn't working.  What's the deal?  Oh... and what exactly is the ship needed for in the first place?  The S.H.I.E.L.D. agency needed to recruit the superheroes to work for them, right?  So doesn't that imply that they really don't have any power themselves?  If they did, they wouldn't need to recruit superheroes.  Soooooo... what the heck do they need a giant, flying aircraft carrier for?Question - When Loki's henchmen come to rescue him off of the carrier, why do they blow up an engine first?  Wouldn't they try to sneak in quietly and get him out?  Was it supposed to be a distraction?  If so, why didn't anyone on the carrier send some extra guards to Loki's room?  Dumb.Question - where did Hawkeye get that usb plug arrow he uses to shoot into the computer and turn all of the carrier engines off?  For that matter, why turn all of the engines off in the first place... they are trying to get Loki, not kill themselves.Question - since Hawkeye's arrow accessed the computer and shut the engines down, how is it that Iron Man is able to get them started again?  He is working on the single engine that Hawkeye shot out with the explosive arrow.  So - why is it possible to get that engine started.... and all the other engines started, when the computer apparently shut them down?  Makes no sense.Question - Loki is so impressive why?  The dude is the most pathetic evil villain I've ever seen.Question - if the shield around the energy beam creating the space portal can't be penetrated, why not just knock out the floor around it... or a floor or two off of the building?  The energy generator is on the roof of the building... so knock out the floors beneath it.  It isn't hovering there.  Just knock it off.  What's the big deal?Question - what exactly is the relationship between Loki and the alien invaders?  What does each hope to gain and why?  What... are they just invading for the heck of it?  Does Loki want to rule Earth because he got kicked out of his home world?  How is that going to fly?  Does he think no one else will notice and that Thor and the others won't come after him regardless?  Does he think that the aliens will back him up?  They don't seem all that great if half of them can be beaten by a woman with two pistols, a guy with a bow, and another guy with a shield.Finally, can anyone think of a dumber plot?  Just imagine the production meeting where everyone is sitting around trying to come up with ideas for an Avengers movie.  I can see it now... someone at the end of the table says, ""Wait a minute!  I've got it!  How about The Avengers have to save the world from an evil norse god who is trying to conquer the Earth with an army of aliens!""Again... as I say in almost every movie review I write... didn't a single person stand up and say, ""Hmmmm... you know what?

1211227,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B001KVZ6HK,Moviedude,"[6, 7]","With Avengers Marvel had a tough row to hoe. Starting with Iron man, they cranked out a series of surprisingly watchable movies (including a remake of Ang Lee's disastrous Hulk) related by nothing more than a shared universe. Of course anybody who stayed through the credits of Iron Man knew an Avengers film was coming, but how would it blend the disparate themes and directorial styles of all the entries in the Marvel cinematic universe? Well, with Avengers, that uncertainty is over, and the results are fantastic.Avengers succeeds on three levels. Firstly, it allows every hero to behave as we expect them to. Iron Man is still a snarky always-knows-best alpha, Thor literally seems to have walked right out of his job in Asgard from his own film (and in the plot, he has) and Captain America is still reeling from his jaunt through time- but not enough to be scared of thousand-foot drops or flapped by Loki's supernatural mischief.Secondly, Avengers dumps all the characters we have come to know together in a big stew and Director Joss Whedon uses his flair for writing arguments (and comic books) to deliver every bit of the conflict and comradery you would expect. Heroes fight, team up, fight some more, then fight other stuff and every bit of it is punchy and fresh. Even Black Widow and Hawkeye, tragically underdeveloped characters who only visited in past films have good, well-rounded personae here.And finally, Avengers is fun. The plot (Loki, the Norse god of mischief, dupes a race of alien cyborgs into invading Earth because he is MAD AT EARTH) is pure comic book cheese, with a suitably over-the-top climax (where the Hulk really shines). the dialog is clever and humorous and dark when it needs to be. The effects are outstanding, and a surprising amount of what you will see here is in fact sets and actors, just as in Captain America.There are some problems. The post-production 3D, for instance, is horrible- not because it is badly implemented, but because this film makes use of a lot of creative camera perspectives that just look wrong with 3D applied to them- in the opening chase sequence, the helicopter following the convoy looks like an undersized toy due to the combination of a compressed perspective and a normal 3D field of depth. The film is also a bit inaccessible to viewers who haven't seen the preceding movies. After all, it wouldn't do to got through every hero's origin story whenever they show up. But these are minor quibbles, and shouldn't get in the way of enjoying what is one of the best, most satisfying comic book movies ever made, and a good omen of what's to come from this franchise.PROS:-Punchy writing-Great effects, great action, and tons of both-Good acting by principles and supporting cast alike-Tons of little nods to comic book fans throughout-Is almost three hours long, goes by like the world's best Saturday morning cartoonCONS:-What the 3D editors did doesn't always match what the camera crew did-CONSTANT Acura product placement that makes GM's endorsement of the Transformers films seem subtle-So dependent on seeing the past films and blink-and-you'll-miss-it plot turns that it almost totally defies casual viewing",5,"Earth's mightiest heroes, this year's nicest surprise",1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,3189,"['Avengers', 'Marvel', 'had', 'tough', 'row', 'hoe', 'Starting', 'Iron', 'man', 'cranked', 'out', 'series', 'surprisingly', 'watchable', 'movies', 'including', 'remake', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'disastrous', 'Hulk', 'related', 'nothing', 'more', 'shared', 'universe', 'course', 'anybody', 'who', 'stayed', 'credits', 'Iron', 'Man', 'knew', 'Avengers', 'film', 'was', 'coming', 'how', 'would', 'blend', 'disparate', 'themes', 'directorial', 'styles', 'entries', 'Marvel', 'cinematic', 'universe', 'Well', 'Avengers', 'uncertainty', 'results', 'are', 'fantastic.Avengers', 'three', 'levels', 'Firstly', 'hero', 'behave', 'expect', 'Iron', 'Man', 'still', 'snarky', 'always-knows-best', 'alpha', 'Thor', 'literally', 'have', 'walked', 'right', 'job', 'Asgard', 'own', 'film', 'plot', 'Captain', 'America', 'still', 'reeling', 'jaunt', 'time-', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'scared', 'thousand-foot', 'drops', 'flapped', 'Loki', 'supernatural', 'mischief.Secondly', 'Avengers', 'dumps', 'characters', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'together', 'big', 'stew', 'Director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'flair', 'writing', 'arguments', 'comic', 'books', 'deliver', 'bit', 'conflict', 'comradery', 'would', 'expect', 'Heroes', 'fight', 'team', 'up', 'fight', 'more', 'then', 'fight', 'other', 'stuff', 'bit', 'punchy', 'fresh', 'Even', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Hawkeye', 'tragically', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'who', 'only', 'visited', 'past', 'films', 'have', 'good', 'well-rounded', 'personae', 'here.And', 'finally', 'Avengers', 'fun', 'plot', 'Loki', 'Norse', 'god', 'mischief', 'race', 'alien', 'cyborgs', 'invading', 'Earth', 'MAD', 'AT', 'EARTH', 'pure', 'comic', 'book', 'cheese', 'suitably', 'over-the-top', 'climax', 'where', 'Hulk', 'really', 'dialog', 'clever', 'humorous', 'dark', 'when', 'be', 'effects', 'are', 'outstanding', 'surprising', 'amount', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'here', 'fact', 'sets', 'actors', 'just', 'Captain', 'America.There', 'are', 'problems', 'post-production', '3D', 'instance', 'horrible-', 'not', 'badly', 'implemented', 'film', 'use', 'lot', 'creative', 'camera', 'just', 'look', 'wrong', '3D', 'applied', 'them-', 'opening', 'chase', 'sequence', 'helicopter', 'following', 'convoy', 'looks', 'undersized', 'toy', 'due', 'combination', 'compressed', 'perspective', 'normal', '3D', 'field', 'depth', 'film', 'also', 'bit', 'inaccessible', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'preceding', 'movies', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'got', 'hero', 'origin', 'story', 'whenever', 'show', 'up', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'enjoying', 'what', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'satisfying', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'good', 'omen', 'what', 'come', 'franchise.PROS', '-Punchy', 'writing-Great', 'effects', 'great', 'action', 'tons', 'both-Good', 'acting', 'principles', 'supporting', 'cast', 'alike-Tons', 'little', 'nods', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'throughout-Is', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'world', 'best', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoonCONS', '-What', '3D', 'editors', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'match', 'what', 'camera', 'crew', 'did-CONSTANT', 'Acura', 'product', 'placement', 'GM', 'endorsement', 'Transformers', 'films', 'seem', 'subtle-So', 'dependent', 'seeing', 'past', 'films', ""blink-and-you'll-miss-it"", 'plot', 'almost', 'totally', 'defies', 'casual', 'viewing']",Marvel's: The Avengers

1211230,A2AK7ZFKW08HID,B001KVZ6HK,movielover,"[1, 2]","If you are reading this review I am sure you know by now what this movie is about, so I won't go into detail about the plot. First thing I want to talk about is the Aspect ratio. Alot of people seem to be upset that it does not have the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. Me personally I would rather have the screen filled, I don't see the point of spending a thousand dollars on a big screen TV only to have the picture shrunk. Having it fill up the entire screen also makes the 3D more enjoyable, the black bars seem to be very distracting when you are trying to watch a 3D film, so for me this is a positive.Secondly, the 3D was awesome, especially toward the end of the movie when the battle takes place. The 3D gives this movie so much dimension. It is hard to believe this movie was a conversion, they did a fantastic job.Third is the action in this movie. There's never a dull moment. From the opening scene to the end this movie is filled with none stop action. My favorite scene is the fight between Iron Man and Thor. They did a wonderful job filming that scene.Fourth is the comedy. This movie had alot more funny moments than I expected. Hulk was my favorite. I think he even out did Tony Stark in this. The scene with him and Loki was great, ""Puny God""! Also when he punches during the battle at the end, priceless!Fifth is the CGI. The VFX department took very good care of this film. They did a spectacular job on the hulk. This is three best looking hulk out of all the films. I think this us why Hulk seemed to become a fan favorite, because he looks great, and also had alot of funny parts in the movie. The Hulk really makes this movie worth watching.Last is the bonus features. Alot of people have complained about this also, but I was happy with everything. There are deleted scenes, features, commentary, digital copy, soundtrack, second screen. I though they did a good job with the bonus features, and I am satisfied.Overall, this is a must have, must see movie. Action/Superhero movies don't get no bigger our no better than this. Kudos to Joss Whedon, Disney, Marvel, and everyone else who worked hard to put this movie together. Can't wait for Phase 2!

Absolutely amazing. The 3D conversion is worthy of much praise and looks noticeably better than the two times I saw it in the theater. The final fight scene in the middle of new york city is simply stunning. The film has a few great pop out scenes but the real highlights of the films 3D release is Iron Man flying high through the city and The Hulk lunging towards the screen before destroying a fighter jet. If you have the chance to experience this movie in the comforts of your own home in the 3D than I would say this film is a must have just to showcase how well a movie can look in home 3D.So you might be asking next,is their any cons to Avengers 3D?Very minimal. The biggest thing I noticed is that if I'm skipping between scenes than it will take the disc a second before readjusting to 3D. The only other 3D film I'v noticed to do this was Ghost of the Abyss 3D.The only of other point of contention I noticed was when Loki is looked in the small prison created for the Hulk. While talking to the Black Widow the spit from his mouth is very noticeable in 3D. Drooling down the the side of the screen.

The day all Marvel freaks have been waiting for...a decade has passed since we heard rumors that this titan team movie was in the works. The Avengers is without a doubt a complete success and for once lives up to the overwhelming hype.Not ignoring character development, The Avengers manages a pretty tough feat! The story is long, but never boring and even though it takes time to develop, it's like a simmering pot that we all know is going to explode at some point!..and when the pot does explode, it explodes like no other superhero movie has ever done!First off having Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye, The Black Widow and Nick Fury in one movie seemed impossible to give each character their due, but The Avengers does just that,(Fury could have been better utilized and I can't get used to Jackson playing the part.) I grew up with the scruffy cigar chomping BADA$$ white guy version from the 60's), but this film pulls off the impossible! I never once looked at my watch in it's two hour and twenty five minute length. Besides having a very ambitious story the action sequences are the best I've ever seen in a film of this nature.The film has many comic moments which had the entire audience roaring with laughter with the Hulk (who is properly sized for once) delivering in spades this time around ( I guess they owed the character that much after two sub-par feature films). He and Robert Downey Jr. steal the show and give us those classic moments a popcorn film of this magnitude needs to keep everyone focused in on the fact that this is a film about comic book characters. Each character is given time to shine and having origin films for the main quadrant helps a great deal. I can't imagine how they're going to top this one?!The Avengers rivals the very best of all comic book films including Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins and the 3D (which I usually find distracting) is the best I've ever seen. Trailers for the new Spider Man reboot and Batman films were also presented in 3D. Even if you're not really into superhero films, this is the summer's must see movie. Get a tub of popcorn and prepare for an incredible movie experience!.... and you WILL want to stay ALL the way to the end of the film as there is a false ending showing one of Marvel's Heavy Weight Villains before a funny ending scene a few minutes later.

Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner is wonderful. I also think Tom Hiddleson is outstanding as Loki. Samuel L. Jackson chews up the scenery, as usual. Thor is boring.

While Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man II, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger all the set the stage and were great superhero films in their own respective rights, none of them could really convey the sheer amount of pure awesome that The Avengers contains.  Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned to Earth wreck havoc in his quest for the Tesseract (i.e., the Cosmic Cube), forcing Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to set forward his Avengers Initiative.  Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) unite to take down the baddies, resulting in some brilliant action set pieces and massive amounts of destruction that you've got to see to believe.  Director Joss Whedon, best known for creating Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly, as well as launching Marvel's brilliant Astonishing X-Men comic series, manages to handle the proceedings shockingly well and equally balance (for the most part, sadly Hawkeye seems to get the short end of the stick) each character, with all of them getting their own respective moments in the limelight.  That, and Mark Ruffalo is an absolute smash (no pun intended) as Banner, and the Hulk moments are some of the best and most insanely enjoyable segments you'll see in any mainstream superhero film ever.  While it isn't without it's flaws, The Avengers is a smashing blockbuster that will be extremely hard to top in terms of spectacle or action set-pieces...and of course, like any of Marvel's recent films, the post-credits sequences set the stage for even bigger (and more cataclysmic) events to unfold in future installments.",5,"The best Marvel movie ever, and one of the best superhero movies ever made",1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,1797,"['been', 'leading', 'up', 'folks', 'grand', 'spectacle', 'known', 'Avengers', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Iron', 'Man', 'II', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'set', 'stage', 'were', 'great', 'superhero', 'films', 'own', 'respective', 'rights', 'none', 'could', 'really', 'convey', 'sheer', 'amount', 'pure', 'awesome', 'Avengers', 'contains', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'returned', 'Earth', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'quest', 'Tesseract', 'i.e.', 'Cosmic', 'Cube', 'forcing', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'set', 'forward', 'Avengers', 'Initiative', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Captain', 'America', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Bruce', 'Banner/Hulk', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Hawkeye', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'unite', 'take', 'down', 'baddies', 'resulting', 'brilliant', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'massive', 'amounts', 'destruction', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'believe', 'Director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'best', 'known', 'creating', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Firefly', 'as', 'well', 'launching', 'Marvel', 'brilliant', 'Astonishing', 'X-Men', 'comic', 'series', 'handle', 'proceedings', 'shockingly', 'well', 'equally', 'balance', 'most', 'part', 'sadly', 'Hawkeye', 'get', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'character', 'getting', 'own', 'respective', 'moments', 'limelight', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'absolute', 'smash', 'pun', 'intended', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'moments', 'are', 'best', 'most', 'insanely', 'enjoyable', 'segments', ""'ll"", 'see', 'mainstream', 'superhero', 'film', 'ever', ""n't"", 'flaws', 'Avengers', 'smashing', 'blockbuster', 'will', 'be', 'extremely', 'hard', 'top', 'terms', 'spectacle', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'course', 'Marvel', 'recent', 'films', 'post-credits', 'sequences', 'set', 'stage', 'even', 'bigger', 'more', 'cataclysmic', 'events', 'unfold', 'future', 'installments']",Marvel's: The Avengers

Like how they move the camera and for a moment it's a little out of focus, or the worst - when they are just way too close to the action. I really don't care for the in-your-face action, pull it back enough to let us see all the action! But fortunately, they didn't do it often enough to ruin the film for me.*** There is a little bit more movie midway through the end credits, so don't be too quick to exit the theater or turn off the DVD. ***The acting is good (though I would have much preferred Edward Norton as the Hulk). The sets and some of the effects are pretty awesome - they didn't ""cheap"" on this movie and I appreciate that.  [I did wonder why Tony Stark's gal (& business partner???) Pepper Potts (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is always in shorts and barefoot in his classy office, and yet seemed more business dressed elsewhere though...]We were not familiar with some of the characters, so here's a little more about them for you.*  Samuel L. Jackson plays ""Nick Fury"" the Director of the S.H.I.E.L.D. peacekeeping agency (sorry, I have no idea as to what the letters stand for)*  2nd in command at SHIELD is Maria Hill (serious Brunette who seems over botoxed or something as only her lips and eyes move on her face - Spock was more animated than this woman!)*  ""Phil Coulson"" (the guy in the suit) is a veteran agent (I actually thought he was in charge until I looked up some information after I saw the movie)*  Clint Barton (aka ""Hawkeye"" or ""the Hawk"") - is one of SHIELDs most elite agents, and the greatest living marksman on Earth. His weapon of choice is the recurve bow with custom augmented arrows.*  Scarlett Johansson plays Natasha Romanoff (aka the Black Widow) - she is a top SHIELD agent, one of the world's greatest spies and skilled assassin. She's supposed to be armed with an extensive arsenal of specialized weapons like widow stings and cluster bombs and a vast repertoire of martial arts skills...I don't remember her with specialized weapons, just guns and the martial arts skills.You should probably already be familiar with the other characters:  THOR (demi-god), his evil brother LOKI (who is trying to take over and rule Earth in this movie), IRON MAN Tony Stark (inventor, playboy, billionaire, philanthropist), THE HULK/Bruce Banner (scientist), CAPTAIN AMERICA (thawed out and back in action) . . .In this movie you see (twice) that Thor is actually stronger than the Hulk, and can take a real beating without getting scratched up (here's that over-thinker kicking in). And while I think this was an oversight, Captain America was able to stretch out his hand and call his shield to him in the way Thor can call his hammer to him. Also, while he's been given incredible strength, Captain America was evidently physically strong enough to rival Superman in that he deflected something that his shield could withstand but the pressure on the shield should have crunched him supporting the shield.  Also, while in reality people ARE actually stupid enough to not immediately clear the street and get inside when vehicles and buildings are raining down on the street - and to be staring out the windows at the action instead of getting to safety - I would think the police and firemen would've been smart enough to be shooing them out of the streets and underground where possible without having to be told by Captain America. But, it gives an additional chuckle to the movie (as you'll see) so I won't be too hard on them for that.  :-)But hey - that's the worst I can come up with on this, and as you can see it's small potatoes.  If you enjoy these types of movies, this one will not let you down!

Blu-Ray shows the details, but this film was shot for massive scale and thunderous sound. In normal viewing, the weaknesses of the film wear badly. The format consists of a 5 minute lecture by one of the characters about some ridiculous/complicated aspect of the story, followed by 10 minutes of massive action, then another lecture, then more action, etc. Everyone knows the characters (and the actors) from previous films, and they are introduced poorly and hardly developed at all, each given the spotlight for a minute here and there. Dialogue is terrible; the characters just mouth one ridiculous, convoluted explanation after another. Other than Thor, the characters are dull and flat, just doing the same old schtick. The film goes on forever. And ever. Even the astoundingly kinetic action scenes get boring. I'm a lifelong follower of the Avengers, liked many of the previous Marvel movies, and was predisposed to like this one. I didn't. I found ""The Avengers"" to be shallow and tedious, lacking any of the qualities needed to make it work in a home setting.

Nit-picks: the alien invaders are too easy to kill (Black Widow and Hawkeye can dispatch them easily with guns and arrows.)  During the final battle, surely some humans must be killed, but do you see any?  So, that's not very realistic.  The 3D isn't quite realistic: there appear to be three different and distinct layers of objects.  Inside his Iron Man suit, Tony Stark's face appears flat while the 3D computer graphics are floating in space.

Whether it's the wisecracking playboy genius Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, who's grown up believing his father didn't love him...the arrogant prince of Asgard, Thor, whose father Odin sent him into exile to teach him a lesson and led him to love the people of Earth enough to become their protector...the troubled Bruce Banner, whose inner demons appear in the form of the angry green giant Hulk...Captain America, Steve Rogers, who emerged from a 70-year coma to find adjusting to his new life in the twenty-first century difficult enough without the added pressures of war...or the two elite assassins, Black Widow (Natasha Romanov) and Hawkeye (Clint Barton) who want to atone for the blood on their hands, each character has impressive depth.In The Avengers, the S.H.I.E.L.D. team has been working on harnessing the power of the Cosmic Cube (now known as the Tesseract). They inadvertently open a portal that allows Thor's adopted brother Loki, until now presumed dead, to enter the SHIELD complex and take possession of Dr. Eric Selvig and Hawkeye, physically and mentally...and launch an attack on the Earth. Loki is a king without a kingdom, and he plans to make the people of Earth bow to his will. He's quickly captured, but as he's being transported to his prison, a storm erupts. His reaction surprises Captain America, who asks if he's afraid of a little thunder. ""I'm not fond of what comes after,"" he grumbles.What comes after is his brother, the God of Thunder, who has come from Asgard to take him home to face justice there. This results in a heated battle--literally--between Thor and Iron Man. Loki escapes, and the Avengers--a team of superheroes who don't even like each other (except for Black Widow and Hawkeye, who I suspect have more than a working relationship)--must learn to work together to save the Earth. Will they ever become friends? The obligatory after-end-credits scene might offer a clue.I'm fighting the urge to go into detail here. There are so many great scenes, including the death of a long-standing character, but I don't want to be accused of being a spoiler! Screenwriter/director Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly and Serenity) gives The Avengers the perfect balance of heart, humor and nonstop action. The special effects are amazing but don't detract from what's most important in this film. The actors--Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Hiddleston, Cobie Smulders, Clark Gregg and Samuel L. Jackson--are all perfect for their roles. As Mark Ruffalo (Dr. Bruce Banner) said in an interview, there are a hundred reasons why this movie shouldn't have worked--but it does. Does it ever!There's something in The Avengers for everyone, and I can't recommend it strongly enough!",5,"Actually, I'd Give It 25 Stars If I Could!",1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,3085,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'preferred', 'Marvel', 'superheroes', 'DC', 'crew', 'one', 'important', 'reason', 'character', 'development', 'Marvel', 'heroes', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'one-dimensional', 'superheroes', ""'re"", 'fully-developed', 'characters', 'people', 'personalities', 'histories', 'lives', 'hero', 'personas', 'wisecracking', 'playboy', 'genius', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'aka', 'Iron', 'Man', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'believing', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'arrogant', 'prince', 'Asgard', 'Thor', 'father', 'Odin', 'sent', 'exile', 'teach', 'lesson', 'led', 'love', 'people', 'Earth', 'enough', 'become', 'protector', 'troubled', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'inner', 'demons', 'appear', 'form', 'angry', 'green', 'giant', 'Hulk', 'Captain', 'America', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'who', 'emerged', '70-year', 'coma', 'find', 'adjusting', 'new', 'life', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'difficult', 'enough', 'added', 'pressures', 'war', 'two', 'elite', 'assassins', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Natasha', 'Romanov', 'Hawkeye', 'Clint', 'Barton', 'who', 'want', 'atone', 'blood', 'hands', 'character', 'impressive', 'Avengers', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'team', 'been', 'working', 'harnessing', 'power', 'Cosmic', 'Cube', 'now', 'known', 'Tesseract', 'inadvertently', 'open', 'portal', 'Thor', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Loki', 'now', 'presumed', 'dead', 'enter', 'SHIELD', 'complex', 'take', 'possession', 'Dr.', 'Eric', 'Selvig', 'Hawkeye', 'physically', 'mentally', 'launch', 'attack', 'Earth', 'Loki', 'king', 'kingdom', 'make', 'people', 'Earth', 'bow', 'will', 'quickly', 'captured', 'being', 'transported', 'prison', 'storm', 'erupts', 'reaction', 'surprises', 'Captain', 'America', 'who', 'afraid', 'little', 'thunder', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'what', 'brother', 'God', 'Thunder', 'who', 'come', 'Asgard', 'take', 'home', 'face', 'justice', 'there', 'results', 'heated', 'battle', 'literally', 'Thor', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Loki', 'Avengers', 'team', 'superheroes', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'other', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Hawkeye', 'who', 'suspect', 'have', 'more', 'working', 'relationship', 'must', 'learn', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'Earth', 'Will', 'ever', 'become', 'friends', 'obligatory', 'after-end-credits', 'scene', 'might', 'offer', 'clue.I', ""'m"", 'fighting', 'urge', 'go', 'detail', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'including', 'death', 'long-standing', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'spoiler', 'Screenwriter/director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'Avengers', 'perfect', 'balance', 'heart', 'humor', 'nonstop', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'film', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Dr.', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'said', 'interview', 'are', 'hundred', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'Does', 'ever', 'something', 'Avengers', 'everyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'strongly', 'enough']",Marvel's: The Avengers

That said, I am extremely disappointed at the one-liner in the movie when Thor, in reply to Black Widow when she admonishes Loki for killing ""80 people in two days"" says, ""he's adopted"".  I remember being in the movie theater when this got a big laugh.  The laugh didn't come from me.  Since I have adopted family members I didn't find it funny or okay.  Shame on the filmmakers for allowing this.  Not cool.As for the rest of the movie, I love it.  Really liked Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk and though the Iron Man character is more Robert Downey than Tony Stark, I like enjoy how it works in this film.All characters were continued from the previous movies, maybe with the exception of the Hulk.  Thor is still comedic and naive and not arrogant.  I never liked Thor's arrogance so that works well for me too.  Works well as a movie character.  The Black Widow character is very strong.  There are two exceptional fight sequences with Black Widow.  One is in this movie, the other in Ironman II.  Loki is not very strong, but acted well.  Great grin!  How does Black Widow deceive Loki so easily?Shield and Nick Fury are appropriately ""government"" and the story makes that clear.  Agent Colson is a big star in these movies.  He has a collection of superhero items.  More great humor there!Marvel studios really pulled this one together well from the other individual movies.Once in a while the narrations are a little too obvious.  Hulk tells the story of how he tried to end his life as one example.  Everybody looks surprised, but this is just meant for us to know Hulk's character in this movie.  That happens a little more often than necessary, but it's only a minor distraction.Really enjoy this movie and now that it's out on Blu-ray I'm already enjoying it over again.It's a shame that Marvel couldn't have done something to about the inexcusable insensitivity.

I won't go into it here for spoilers, but his behavior changed 180 degrees at the end of the movie when it was convenient. That change was completely unexplained and didn't sit well with me.

All of the movies you mentioned are cash cows and pretty good entertainment.The Avengers surpassed my expectations like no other movie ever has.

I'm a penny pincher and will never go see a movie at the theater unless I think it's worthy.  I happened to go to this movie twice in the theater and loved it even more the 2nd time around.

Remember, Capp defeated the HULK and is worthy enough to lift Thor's Hammer, so I would have preferred to not have him bounced about like a rag doll.

1211405,A1W45HIJSPH62I,B001KVZ6HK,Philip J. Herman,"[1, 2]","The only way this movie could be better is if it was an adult film with gritty cinematography. Created as it is in the Marvel Style ( bright, clear, witty, sarcastic, comic-book-y ) this movie is fabulously entertaining. Now for the critique: the story makes little if no sense. It is just an excuse to have a big fight in Manhattan. I actually pity the poor screenwriters; they have to take the Marvel Universe, excerpt parts of it, and weave together a story with certain characters. This seems like an impossible task. It is surprising that the film holds together at all. There is also the problem of showing real damaged bodies. There must have been horrible dismemberment and wounding of people, but none of it is shown. There is also the problem of the heroes; we have a group made up of a God, a man in an armored super-suit, a super-enhanced soldier man, an indestructible hulk, a regular woman who can fight well, and a regular man who can shoot nifty arrows. If there was any reality in this movie, the God, the iron man, and the hulk MIGHT be able to fight. The Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Cap would have been killed almost instantly; but it's a comic-book movie... anything can happen. I admit that the digitally-designed SHIELD facilities and heli-carrier look fabulous and almost believable... not too enormously complex. Some of the sequences in this film work very well; probably the best is when the Hulk thrashes Loki around like a rag doll... very satisfying. The movie does have a bit of a problem with continuity. There are lulls that go on too long, and a sort of a part 1 and part 2 to the action... but it does all come together nicely. we adults who watch it realize that in any remotely realistic universe the only ones who would have survived would be the Hulk and Thor, and why in tarnation didn't anyone think of shooting some nukes up into that portal in the first place. And I always like the little afterthought-endings that Marvel tacks on, to entice us towards the next development. This time we get the inference that the bad guys have to answer to another more powerful alien ruler, who we only see briefly as he turns his head. I got the impression somehow even before he turned his head that it was the Super Skrull. Thanks to obsessive people avidly reading reviews, I now know that the character is someone named Thanos, whom I very vaguely recall from reading Marvel comics 30 years or so ago. I have no idea what he does or where he fits in, but obviously, it's easy to find out nowadays. One last thought, I just watched a few bits and pieces again of the movie, a day later. It is even better than I thought.

The first tip off is that the normal warning screens (anti-piracy, etc) are phrased differently from what is normally sold in the States, referring to 'territories', etc. This is not a problem, but on this DVD of The Avengers, I noticed a couple annoying things:- the DVD is apparently programmed to turn subtitles on automatically, and those subtitles are in French. I had to turn them off to watch normally.- even with the subtitles turned off, every time a character spoke in another language (during the scenes in India and with the Russian criminals), French subtitles appeared on the screen. I don't recall of, in the theatrical presentation, of there were any subtitles in these scenes, but I was unable to get English subtitles to appear in these instances, and could not get rid of the French ones (which do me no good). I tried this DVD in a couple different players and got the same results.I don't know if the DVDs being sold in stores in the States are a different version from the ones being sold by Amazon, but I intend to find out.

If you are a 3D fan, this one is worth a purchase for the 3D.3D Highlights:All of the Avengers combined their powers to take down the enemy by the final act, with each 3D shot looking great in 3D featuring:Iron Man jetting past buildings,Thor slamming his 3D hammer into the back of a soaring beast,Captain America tossing his shield into the screen towards the enemy foot soldiers,The Hulk smashing rock into rubble as it flies out at the screen,and plenty more 3D worthy moments including Loki, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johannsen in 3D kicking butt.Does the 3D enhance the movie? If you want an extra dimension, with characters like Thor or Iron Man, standing out apart from the background, as though you were almost seeing them in real life, then this is the closest you'll get for now. Would it have been better if it was filmed in 3D instead of post converted from a 2D source? If done right, yes, but what is here is done really well.3D overall: 4/5. (not an average) Better than average, but there is room to increase the 3D power in the sequel.3D Parallax Layers: 4/5. Good. But Great by the lenghty end battle.3D Depth: 4/5. You can see deep into the screen generally.3D Volume: 3/5. Characters look generally lifelike with depth to their features.3D pop out: 3/5. The pop out moments by the end are nice.3D Consistency: 3/5. The end really stood out strongly, the rest was good.3D Highlights: The end battle throughout, the outer space stairs.3D strength similar to: Captain America 3D, Thor 3D, not as strong as Avatar 3D, which was mostly filmed in 3D, the others converted from 2D.3D Worth a Buy? Yes. Recommended in 3D. If you have a 3D TV, don't miss it.Quick Movie Review: With plenty of great action moments throughout, Avengers is one of the best action movies I've seen in years, thanks to one of the most epic, action packed, and incredible ending battle scenes gracefully combining all of the current Avengers working together to take down the overwhelming enemy, under Loki's command. The best thing about Avengers, despite a slow build up, is the well done balancing of showcasing each lead hero, offering them plenty of time in the spot light to feel like they each contributed a very important role to the movie. This is how to do it. Rating: 9/10 for the movie.

1211436,A2K3ZJWLF0V4K,B001KVZ6HK,"Rachel Holland ""miribeau""","[0, 6]","If I was 12, I think I would have enjoyed this film. It was beautifully filmed fluff, through and through, all style and no substance, like the G.I.Joe cartoon's I watched on Saturday mornings as a little girl. The dialogue was unrealistic, endless, and annoying. The script had to be three hundred pages long and I never thought I could find Robert Downey Jr. enough of an unfortunate presence in a film that I'd be fantasizing they'd kill his character off but, in spite of my abiding love for Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, I wanted Ironman squashed. None of the characters were interesting, endearing, intelligent, crafty, or even useful in the most general of terms. They were, however, witty. Yes, witty. Witty when the villain was attacking. Witty when they were about to die. Witty when they were sitting on the toilet. Witty when they were talking in their sleep. I haven't heard this much punning since I was in high school watching immature high school themed movies to try and &#34;fit in&#34; with the less intelligent girls who though X-files was too complicated and political science was so confusing. If you are young and easily impressed by flash, you'll like it. If you also love the comics, you'll probably love it. If you are thirty or older, a lover of cinema, a person who appreciated Singer's X-Men as well as shows like Battlestar Galactica, then this film will bore you half to death. I fell asleep each time I tried to watch it until, finally, I doped up on coffee and forced myself to suffer through it. It took a rewatching of The Returned Season One and Season One of Battlestar for me to cleanse myself of the dialogue laden nightmare of standing around and misogyny that was The Avengers. First Buffy's lady parts stole Angel's soul and now the only female lead is a psychopathic serial killer who is &#34;dripping red&#34;. What will Whedon think of next. Perhaps a snuff film about Eastern European tween girls or pushing old ladies off cliffs. In any case, I wrote this for one reason: if you have a daughter at an impressionable age, this could do real damage to watch. Get her something French or British to watch and leave this for the future rapists of the world to enjoy. Even I felt devalued after watching this and I'm basically in love with myself.

1211439,A3UT7I4QCP1FQR,B001KVZ6HK,"Rajesh Motie ""Xanatos Planned This Signature""","[20, 59]","Oh, goodness me.Why couldn't I have just enjoyed this movie? That would've been so nice. I really have no desire to lambast a movie I anticipated for months. After watching five films and only liking two of them (Iron Man and Captain America), I was so ready for the pay-off. I would like nothing more than to gush about how great it was.That would be nice.Sadly, The Avengers just didn't do it for me.The whole point of this movie is its characters, the team the movie gets its title from. It's the characters most of all we want to see done right, because they can liven a mediocre plot. Character, unfortunately, is a major problem in The Avengers.I get that Cap's development is being saved for Cap 2, but guess what? That's STUPID. We should've seen him reacting to cell phones, reacting to the internet, reacting to the god damn fact that everyone he used to know is dead. Something. Joss Whedon said he had a scene where Steve meets an aged Peggy Carter, but he cut it. Damn. Steve Rogers isn't even REMOTELY explored here. What does it mean to be looked up to? What does it mean to be that one person that everyone counts on to do the right thing? And where's the *world's* reaction to *him*? Cap is a renowned hero that kids in the Marvel universe read about in school. Thousands of people admire him. Him being alive in the present day is a big deal for the whole world. It isn't touched on at all. Also during the final battle, just how the flying frak is Steve able to bark orders in a world he's SEVENTY YEARS displaced from?!Stark and Thor aren't explored much either. They are static, relying on past characterization, and their individual personalities aren't done justice. Stark is his old witty self but I feel like they've almost exhausted everything they could do with him in Iron Man 1 and 2, making him feel kind of hokey here. He seems to develop respect for Steve later on, but there is no defining moment in which he admits it. That and discussing his dad would have been easy opportunities to develop him and remind us what kind of person he is. After all, we want to know just what sort of people are protecting Earth.Thor is just *there*, not shown to be struggling with the notion that if he fails, his love interest is doomed. Does he find comfort in knowing that Asgard will be spared? This is the person willing to sacrifice himself to the Destroyer (sort of...). He doesn't even apologize for his (half) brother's actions, does he? It would have been nice if we saw him in Asgard, to ease us into things, to give a sense of character, to remind us who he is and to show just how the HELL he got back to Earth.Only Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner get any semblance of a character arc. I actually thought Black Widow was one of the highlights of the movie. She isn't forced into a formulaic romance with Hawkeye or any of the other leads and she generally gets to do a lot of things important to the plot (tricking Loki, closing the portal, etc.).I thought The Incredible Hulk was pretty bad. Edward Norton's strong performance aside (and I was *very* dismayed he wouldn't be returning), I wouldn't care if that film was written out of continuity. That's because Ruffalo is just as good in the role and gives Banner a very different but appropriate feel. It's like they started over with the character again, in ways such as Banner calling the Hulk ""the other guy"". He seems to learn that the Hulk can be a force for good, but there's no big moment where he decides to be a hero (there's definitely a trend of things being glossed over). In any case, he's now a willing member of the Avengers. See, he actually came out of this movie different than when he began. I hated that he only becomes the Hulk twice though, and the first time he's completely crazed. It did result in a cool Thor/Hulk fight, but what's the point?As for Hawkeye, why oh why oh WHY was he brainwashed until the last act of the movie? What waste of the character *and* Jeremy Renner!I realize with alarm that the problem is not that anyone steals the show, it's that no one does. I wasn't connected to anyone. Relationships between the characters are not developed. While the characters' initial distrust of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a very good way of bringing out their contrasting personalities, a lot of what you get is bickering. No one seems willing to form a team and everyone is quick to argue. Why would I want to sit there and watch them argue? I wanted to see them become a team. They did, eventually, but that was out of pure necessity, not because they learned to work with and respect each other.Coulson's death really pissed me off. Clark Gregg was fantastic in that role and his fanboyism towards Steve Rogers was delightful. My heart soared with glee when I saw him confront Loki with that oversized blaster. We needed a supporting character like that. It was at that moment he practically became my favorite character. But who cared about him other than Fury and Maria Hill? Even Stark barely knew him. I felt something, but no one else did.Special mention must go to Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. His useless appearance in Iron Man 2 was goofy, but I really liked him here. He gets his fare share of action and you can take him seriously. His final conversation with Coulson is great; he looked how I felt. Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill was also good, and I think she did a lot, contrary to what others say. She could have been used more though, I mean if Black Widow and Hawkeye can get in on the climactic action, why not her?Now my thoughts on villains. Tom Hiddleston is brilliant as Loki, and it's clear from interviews that he's very enthusiastic about the role. Yet the character seems very different from when he was in Thor. There he was on the tip of being a tragic villain, while still held back by the fact that every time it seemed like he was going to turn out to be a complex character, it just didn't happen. Still his magical and manipulative nature brims with potential. In The Avengers, something about him feels oddly...jumbled. It seems to be implied that something is wrong with him. Maybe he's been floating through the cosmos, which drove him mad. Maybe he has been abused by the Chitauri and Thanos, making him exasperated, desperate, and crazy, or he's actually being controlled by them. At the very end of the film it looks like he's snapped out of it, mellowed somehow. The extent of his magic power is also not clear; did he really make Banner pick up the scepter? I don't know what to make of it.I wish he weren't so constrained by his new masters, that he was doing something a bit more personal than taking over the world. Showing what exactly happened to Loki after the events of Thor would have helped. In any case I don't see why so much time needed to be spent on Loki and the Chitauri, considering that their actions aren't very interesting. Why not get to Thanos already? Disappointingly, Loki appears to be genuinely afraid of Thor now, is easily fooled by Black Widow, is somehow downed by one of Hawkeye's arrows, and generally gets smacked around more than he gets to be menacing. As funny as it was to see him get ragdolled by the Hulk, Loki really doesn't get his due. I mean, why not see him actually fight the Hulk? Better yet it would've been good to see him *really* let loose and fight all the Avengers at once.This myriad of character-based problems is disturbing considering director/writer Joss Whedon's usual management of ensembles. He's been known to center an entire episode around one supporting character, from their perspective, multiple times in shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Where was the love here?The Avengers doesn't have a good plot to fall back on. I don't know if I'm too demanding a viewer, but I need to be eased into things. So I find that there's something very wrong with the first Loki battle. Captain America just shows up, and we have absolutely no idea how this guy is reacting to fighting an Asgardian. Bam, here's the Cap/Loki fight, enjoy! Then Iron Man arrives, but no relationship was developed between him and Rogers beforehand. Because of that, when I saw them fight together, I just felt empty. Maybe if Loki had some minions, or a second in command, and Stark and Rogers had formed some camaraderie through fighting them, I would've been satisfied. Amora the Enchantress or Absorbing Man could easily have filled that role. Why the rush to fight Loki?How about if all the Avengers (including Banner) had met at the Helicarrier first and gotten to know each other? Then they might have heard about Loki's minions and gone to fight them, to see how they all work together in the field. When they find out Loki is in Germany, that's when Cap, Iron Man, and Black Widow deal with him. That might have been cool.Throughout most of The Avengers, I was intensely bored. The Iron Man/Thor fight is so forced and stupid it's practically offensive. Then comes the assault on the Helicarrier, which goes on for an *insanely* long time. This leads to the extremely long final battle. Maybe I wouldn't have minded that the final act was long, but having such a pointlessly massive action sequence before that burned me out. So much time is spent on this action, so much time that could have been used for other things. It's no wonder the original cut was three hours.I find it funny that I went out of my way to make I sure I didn't know what exactly Loki's army was, only for it to be revealed within the first few minutes of the film. But why even mention that they're the Chitauri? Who cares? They don't have a word of dialogue. They don't have any indication of personality. We don't know their goals. We don't know where they come from. They can be killed rather easily. Hell it isn't even explained that they're supposed to be aliens. As if that weren't insulting enough, they're a hive mind that can conveniently be defeated by destroying their...monthership? Fleet? Homeworld? Space station? Colony? And you know what made me laugh? From the front, those big leviathan things look just like Terry Pratchett's Discworld, but without the four elephants. Talk about anti-climactic. Can you imagine if Earth was invaded by lots of Great A'Tuins? They're just not making very good use of the Marvel source material.Like I did with Captain America, I will compare this movie to the TV show The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. The villain Dr. Franklin Hall, Graviton, escapes from imprisonment and decides to use his mastery over gravity to destroy an entire city as revenge against S.H.I.E.L.D. (he also happened to get his powers while trying to revive Abraham Erskine's work for them). This is how the Avengers are formed; they spend a whole twenty-minute episode fighting Graviton. It's ridiculously awesome. Everyone gets there due, Graviton's powers are *terrifying* to behold, and the characters realize they work well together. Franklin Hall is a very interesting character to boot. Having that one human threat makes everything focused. This movie would have benefited from something like that. Instead we got faceless, highly destructible aliens and Loki getting pummeled a lot.People say the film is supposed to be nothing but fun. Then I must ask you why it tries to be dramatic. If it's nothing but fun, why kill Phil Coulson? Why the nuclear dilemma during the final battle? Why the distractingly tear-jerking shift to Iron Man's peril when destroying the Chitauri fleet? And this amidst such things as Thor's rather silly ""He's adopted"" line. If The Avengers was originally intended to be pure fun, in practice it has an identity crisis.The Avengers wore me out, it's made me wary of the ""Marvel formula"" that permeates these films. I feel reluctant to continue further into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But being the fan I am, I undoubtedly will be there whether I like it or not...",2,Spoilers.,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,11935,"['Oh', 'goodness', 'me.Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'just',

1211444,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B001KVZ6HK,Ranny Levy,"[1, 2]","KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Talia Rashba reviews this film below:This movie is absolutely fantastic!  It is packed with a ton of action and humor and will transport you into an amazing supernatural world where it is all about the good guys fighting the bad.The story is about a group of famous superheroes that come together to defeat the evil Loki, who has stolen a powerful energy cube that he intends to use to take over the world.The superheroes include Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Each one has a unique and special supernatural power that they use to help them do their job. At first, the superheroes fight about being a team but eventually they work together to complete the mission. The Avengers could have ended up being a typical superhero movie but it isn't.  Because there are so many heroes, it is much more creative and entertaining.The Avengers is packed with fabulous actors. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man.  Just like he was in the Iron Man movie, he thinks he is better than everyone else, but luckily, he is really quite funny so you end up liking him a lot. Captain America (Chris Evans) is strong and serious, and he is always ready to get the job done. Actor Mark Ruffalo plays the ferocious green form known as the Incredible Hulk. He really stands out and takes over the scenes he is in. Superhero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has some of the most incredible battle scenes and Black Widow, portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansen, is the one who convinces the others to put aside their differences and work with each other.An interesting fact is that actor Lou Ferrigno, who has played the Hulk in almost every film since 1978, is actually the Hulk's voice in the movie. Avengers is written and directed by Joss Whedon who does an amazing job.  He makes sure that there is a lot of humor in the movie and that the action scenes really grab your attention.  The special effects were incredible. The super heroes change from their every day selves into their super natural selves in an interesting and fun way. The fight scenes and explosions are unbelievable.  Also, there is a really neat headquarters for the agency that you just have to see for yourself!Even though it is rated PG-13 I think kids ages 11, as well as all adults will love this movie, especially if action is their thing. I am giving this film a 5 out of 5 stars and recommending that you see it right away!",5,Absolutely Fantastic!

The Avengers must come together to save the world with their unique skills. The challenge with bringing so much talent together, is figuring out how to tame their massive egos.I cannot say enough about how well the action is sequenced together.

1211450,A1JWJPTMS50UK7,B001KVZ6HK,Ravenhawk,"[2, 6]","Summer Movie season's here! Finally some movies worth going to the cinema for. My 1st anticipated movie and...it's a HIT! Hats off to Whedon on handling this ensemble. No main character was given too much/too little time. It was well rounded. I loved the banter between them and the acting was good as well. Loki had charisma as the villain. Superb action scenes. It was a living comicbook. My only complaint is it didn't have that suspense. Why? Because Marvel already made it known that sequels are in the works. So you knew they all were going to make it. I look for the heroes to make it anyway but give me the illusion they might not. Also, the Chitauri punked Loki but Loki gave The Avengers more trouble than they did. How's that? Hmm. And there were some impossible feats by Hawkeye & Black Widow; regular humans. Anyway, not a disappointment at all. Fun! And it should be. Batman it isn't. I don't expect the darkness or as much complexity. TDKR will give me that in spades.

This movie proves that superhero team up are possible and when you got the right crew, are incredible. This movie is the movie DC comics wish it could make with superman(although the dark knight series comes close) if they make a justice league movie they need to get the entire phase one line up including this movie and make every director, actor, and crew men watch them all to know how a incredible movie should be made. first of we get the hulk all of the marvel fans especially fans o the incredible hulk have been wanting or soooooooooo long. Mark ruffalo does and excellent job of portraying the hulk as he should be a doctor trying to help people as payment for what the other guy does. He truly shines in this movie.The rest of the avengers also are incredible and take the characters that they portrayed in the other phase one movies and with joss whedon's help make them more incredible. however there is one minor gripe. And that comes from hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner. I believe he should have been also given a little more background in the movie and if allowed too would have also shines as well. But this is a minor gripe. This movie is one of those once in a generation movies that will be remembered and i can not wait for the next round of movies.

I also remember watching the Hulk cartoons and begging my parents to get me the latest issue of of the next Captain America comic books. So as you can tell, I'm a comic books have played a huge role in my childhood, and that being said, it was with great excitement that I awaited The Avengers. Having seen all the Avengers movies until then and owning them all on blu-ray, I remember even watching them all up until Thursday May 3rd, which was when the midnight premiere took place. My buddy and I even wore Iron Man masks to the screening.I'm most happy to report, to say The Avengers did not disappoint is an unforgivable understatement. It may just be the best comic book movie I've ever seen. It shines dozens of lamps on The Dark Knight and it makes the previous Avengers movies (even Thor, which I loved despite not having been familiar with the Thor mythos before seeing it) look like the Fantastic Four movies.Everything about this movie was pitch perfect. Starting with the script. Joss Whedon had penned the script and it's obvious he has done his homework on not just the mythos and everything else in the world of The Avengers, but also what the audience loves about the heroes and expects from a movie about The Avengers. Everyone was given a sense of humour and played their cards right- Tony Stark was his usual lovable jerk self, and had his typical attitude problems that were hard not to love. He was given a great amount of action as well and the scene near the end where he pushes the nuclear bomb into the portal was purely beautiful intensity. Captain America was his usual kickass self, and every one of his action scenes were hard to not love. Thor was hilarious as well and his scenes with Loki were just amazing. Particularly the scene near the end on Stark tower where he forces Loki to watch the mayhem going on in the city and asks ""Is this what you want?"". Aso, FINALLY the Hulk has had justice done. He's given a sense of humour, which the other movies absolutely failed on. I'm happy to report the movie did not fail there. And who can forget the dialogue? Classic Avengers dialogs, down to the last inch. ""We need a plan of attack!"" ""I have a plan. Attack."" and ""WhTs the matter, not fond of thunder and lightning?"" ""I don't like what comes after.""The characterization is really what counts here too. Obviously if you're going to a movie called The Avengers for a character study you're going to the wrong movie (and you need to lay off the artsy movies too, as they're clearly doing serious stuff to your brain), but for the type of movie it is, it's done supremely well. Each character is unique in their own right- I've already mentioned the eponymous superheroes, but Black Widow is one sexy and fun character that's hard not to love. Her action scenes are just incredible and her backstory, while thankfully kept to a minimum is interesting as hell. Hawkeye is stone cold and scary in the first half when  possessed by Loki, then is cool and badass near the end when he resides to kick some Loki butt.The movie is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen thanks to lots of clever, Whedonian humour and appropriately placed Comic book style exaggeration. The scene where Hulk smashes Loki around like a rag doll made me laugh harder than anything in 21 Jump Street and any other comedy this year. And the scene where Hulk sucker punches Thor!The performances are amazing as well. Pure commitment from all involved, with Downey Jr., Evans and Hemsworth, as well as Johannson, Smulders, Jackson, Hiddleston and Renner giving amazing performances all, but Ruffalo is the real surprise here. He brought something new to the table here as Hulk- every line he spoke sounded like he was trying hard to hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling. His monologue about how he tried committing suicide was delivered very chillingly beautifully. He was the biggest surprise and got everything about the Hulk perfect. Props to Ruffalo for FINALLY getting The Hulk exactly right!!!I'm going to conclude my review with one more little piece of praise. Whedon is my favourite TV writer And he's managed to make me proud to be a comic book nerd. Justice was done to the best superheroes ever and I can tell superhero movies are going to not be the same ever again. A big thanks to Ll involved for the commitment and true dedication to making ths movie possible, and the great success it was. I've seen this movie twice already and I can't wait to see it again and again.

They took time to develop the characters (in case you hadn't seen the earlier solo movies.) My only complaint is that they didn't have Hawkeye included as much as I would have liked. :-/ But other than that, they had great visuals, so awesome action scenes, and lots of humor (can you say ""Tony Stark""?) :-D It was surprisingly clean...I was very impressed. Out of all the Marvel movies, this is the best! Now I just hope they come out with a solo movie for Hawkeye and Black Widow. I'll be looking forward to seeing Captain America 2, Thor 2, Iron Man 3, and Avengers 2. (ALL of which they ARE coming out with, if you didn't already know that!!)Here's some statistics: (from [...]) They made $200.3 million in JUST THREE days to become the biggest opening weekend of all time. Before it had been in theaters even a week, globally it had produced over $700 million!Here are the dates for the future Marvel movies!! =) Can't wait!Captain America 2: April 4, 2014!Thor 2: November 15, 2013Iron Man 3: May 3, 2013Avengers 2: Already in development. Expect to see in a theater near you sometime in the no-so-far-off future!Black Widow and Hawkeye solo movies also EXPECTED to come soon! :-)BE SURE TO WATCH IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CREDITS!!! Very important! (Unfortunately, I did not. YouTube saved me.)To sum: There is some brief mild language. Violent content. Action-packed. Very exciting. Impossible to feel sleepy or bored when watching the Avengers. A must-see! :-) So what are you waiting for?

Needless to say, we we're looking forward to getting this on Blu-ray. I just ordered & recieved this Blu-ray(2 disc version)off of amazon. I'm not going to go into details about the film...Cause I would say a vast majority of people reading this has seen this. What I will bring up is things about the Blu-ray. The product comes with a slip cover to put over the case. The slip is well designed, with sharp imagery,vibrant color,and has a texture to it so you can feel the outline of the characters,ect.. on the slip. This set comes with both a Blu-ray & DVD disc. You also get instructions on how to sync the movie to your ipad,ipod,ect...to play on it, while it's playing in your Blu-ray player. You'll need to get an app to do that (go figure). This feature in my opinion isn't really necessary. But some people may like that....The quality of the DVD is good (especially on LCD's,Plasma,& LED). The sound is good and will be awesome if you have a surround sound set up! It's really sharp picture and crisp sound if you play the DVD in a Blu-ray player with HDMI hook-up 7 surround sound. The Blu-ray disc is of course better quality. But in all honesty, if you have a newer TV w/ Blu-ray player.HDMI, and surround sound, it's great either way (and damn near identical). I had seen this film in 3D upon it's theatrical opening day. And so I was looking forward to watching it in 2D too! I was great!!!! I've been a big fan of super heroes, their comics,toys,cartoons,ect...since I was a kid. So because of that reason I won't say this flick is for everyone. However, I know many people which haven't been into any type of comic book/super heroes. And they have really enjoyed some of the Marvel films that have been released (especially this)!!!

Wright ""Didymus20X6""","[0, 0]","When I first heard that they were working on an Avengers movie, a crossover of several Marvel movie characters, I was skeptical.  I really didn't know what to think, but after having seen some of the Marvel movies, my expectations were low.Boy was I wrong.This movie was awesome.  The actors fit their respective parts very well; the visuals are stunning, but are not a lame excuse to gloss over the story being told.What I liked about it was that the heroes all have their own agendas, their own reasons for being involved, and as a result, there is conflict in the group from the very beginning.  You believe that their battles and arguments with each other have real genuine weight as each of them is trying to follow their own path.  As Bruce Banner notes, in the beginning, they are not a team, but rather a volatile chemical mixture, a time bomb.And yet, when the earth really needs them, they don't merely set aside their differences for the sake of the greater good; they actually become a real team.I especially like that, when the Hulk first shows up, he is downright dangerous, a complete monster, not a good guy at all.I am amazed at how many scenes I saw in this movie that could have been very melodramatic, but were somewhat downplayed.  I liked this, because it made them all the more believable as characters, rather than comic book cliches.Were there some weaknesses to the movie?  Yes.  For one thing, I felt that there really needed to be more development for Captain America, at least in the beginning.  This is a man almost 3/4 of a century beyond his time, and yet we see very little of him trying to adjust to his new life.  There's some in the deleted scenes, and I realize some had to be cut for time, but still, I would have liked to have seen Cap having to deal with more future shock.Second, the story really isn't all that original.  It's the old cliche ""bad guy trying to take over the world"" (""OF COURSE!"" - M. Bison), mixed with an alien invasion.  But, even so, it still works.  It's not The Lord of the Rings or The Odyssey, but it doesn't need to be.Third, I really felt Natasha needed a Russian accent.  Given that she was born in Russia, was a Russian spy for most of her early career, and still does a lot of her work in Russia, it would have helped to sell her past a bit better.Overall, this is one fun movie to watch.

The Avengers delivers some spectacular visual effects and great action scenes that culminates to a thrilling battle sequence on and above the streets of New York City.

Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Powers Boothe, Jenny Agutter, and Harry Dean Stanton as the pure humans in the cast.Good fun.",4,Top-notch action movie extravaganza,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,1221,"['Joss', 'Whedon', '8216', '8220', 'Avengers', '8221', 'three', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Captain', 'America', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Hulk', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'are', 'recruited', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'do', 'battle', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'brother', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'who', 'come', 'Earth', 'alien', 'army', 'claim', 'world', 'own', 'can', 'three', 'such', 'distinctly', 'talented', 'yet', 'strong-willed', 'individuals', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'egos', 'long', 'enough', 'function', 'team', 'Avengers', 'save', 'planet', '8217', 'question', 'gathering', 'three', 'classic', 'superheroes', 'single', 'film', 'was', 'stroke', 'marketing', 'genius', 'as', 'well', 'considerable', 'treat', 'fans', 'movie', 'lively', 'loud', 'epic', 'scale', 'just', 'enough', 'character', 'delineation', 'keep', 'engaged', 'human', 'level', 'spectacular', 'jamboree', 'destruction', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'veritable', 'Valhalla', 'CGI', 'aficionados.All', 'above-mentioned', 'actors', 'enter', 'spirit', 'enterprise', 'do', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'pure', 'humans', 'cast.Good', 'fun']",Marvel's: The Avengers
1211542,AOFC8T8U7WUGV,B001KVZ6HK,Roland,"[305, 385]","....And what fun it is.*Spoilers Ahead*Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is an expertly-crafted movie that makes 2 1/2 hours fly by like....well....I don't really know...SOMETHING FAST. My thoughts on seeing this movie--the first time (yes, you WILL go to see this more than once)--were: ""This was just as good as 'The Dark Knight'....how is THAT even possible?"" Well...consider first that Marvel has always had the best storylines, and the know-how to mix all of their characters' comic books together into one, all-encompassing storyline. Then, consider they decided to apply said formula to their movies. Third, they went out and expertly casted the parts.How could this NOT be good?Who else but Robert Downey, Jr could be a multi-billionaire, techno-wizard, armor-wearing snark-artist? Acts like he doesn't care, but is willing to sacrifice his life to save New York.Chris Evans is Captain America. A 1940s guy living in the present day....brings ""a little old-fashioned"" to the role and shows old-fashionedness isn't cheesy, it just depends on how it is presented. It is presented very well, with Evans being the heart and soul (not to mention team leader) of The Avengers--by the way: love the shot, at the movie's end, of him on his motorcycle riding off into the sunset.Mark Ruffalo, (great casting here; now I feel the Hulk movie franchise finally has hope) channels Bill Bixby in his performance (good idea!) but adds a ""Hulk-sized"" portion of world-weariness to his character...his over-the-shoulder ""I'm always angry"" is one of my favorite moments in an entire movie of favorite moments. And....The Hulk gets two more ""Hulk-sized"" moments that totally bring the house down.Oh, nice touch having Lou Ferrigno voice the Hulk.Chris Hemsworth as Thor is the only character in the movie whom I feel was under-utilized. No fault of the actor's; he does a great job with what he is given....and DOES have his moments (""He's adopted"")....I just felt they didn't give him as much as they did the other three leads.Rounding out The Avengers are Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner as the assassin/couple: Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) and Hawkeye. Ms. Johansson is a master interrogator (albeit by making use of quite unorthodox means). Hawkeye is the steely-cool expert marksman--I had my doubts as to how an archer could work in such a high-energy movie. It works.The Avengers are put together by SHIELD: Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury (need I say more?); Clark Gregg (Agent Phil Coulson, and very funny in the role); Colbie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill--doesn't get nearly enough screen time) and Stellan Starsgard.Loki is portrayed by Tom Hiddleston; whom, for a character thinking of himself as a god, brings some amusing vunerability to the character: His embarrassment at being unable to kill/brainwash Tony Stark: ""This usually works.""; or, ""If it's all the same to you, I'll have that drink now.""I was initially skeptical about this movie. I didn't think Loki was the best choice for a screen villain. Er, was I wrong....this tale of an immortal/meglomaniac/demigod/god-wannabe who enlists an alien race to help him conquer Earth (Question: if Loki *really* was a god, why would he need alien help?) made for some great popcorn, big-tent, summer viewing.....My other initial fear was that this wasn't going to be ""The Avengers"" as much as it would be ""Iron Man and Friends"".Thankfully, I was wrong again.To sum up: The Avengers is cinematic excellence. Many have complained about it being too long--and, the first 20 minutes or so setting up the story *do* take a moment....but once ""Marvel's The Avengers"" splashes across the screen: The movie takes off and never looks back. It is packed with great moments and memorable lines/one-liners. The action sequences are the best I've ever seen and it all looks real. Seems I read somewhere online the battle in New York would have done (in reality) 39 billion dollars' worth of damage. You WILL believe it.Oh, one last thing: sit through ALL of the credits.Thank you, Joss Whedon and co.Please go all-out on the blu-ray release. Please.QuotesNatasha: ""I'd sit this one out, Cap.""Captain America: ""I don't see how I can.""Natasha: ""These guys (Thor and Loki) come from legend. They're basically gods.""Cap: ""There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he isn't dressed like that.""Cap: ""Dr. Banner, now might be a good time for you to get angry.""Dr. Banner: ""That's my secret, Captain."" (looks back over his shoulder at Cap) ""I'm always angry.""Loki: (embarrassed) ""This usually works.""Tony Stark: ""Well, you know, performance issues...""""The Avengers""PG-13 for language (non-harsh) and violence; no gore or sex to be found, parents.Marvel Studios in association with Paramount PicturesDirected by Joss Whedon**********UPDATE: Oct. 2, 2012**********Ok, the Blu-Ray/DVD has finally arrived, here is what you get:DISC 1*Blu-Ray Feature Film in 3D  (3D viewing requires Blu-Ray 3D player, 3D capable display and 3D glassesDISC 2*Blu-Ray Feature Film*An original SHORT: ""Item 47"".

I've always liked Josh Whedon's television programming from Buffy to Angel to Firefly to Dollhouse.  The snappy writing and silly banter was real, not forced.  The characters were real, too!Captain America, a man out of time.  I saw the first film and clearly Avengers was a sequel to Cap.  What happened after the big freeze?  What's his relationship with Nick Fury and SHIELD?Thor - his film ended with a Jane Foster crush and a beat-down by a very large villain, as well as an apparent loss into space by Loki.  Again, a sequel of sorts - Thor as I have imagined him, he is torn between a brother who kills indiscriminately (Thor:  ""Loki's my brother.""  Widow:  ""He's killed 80 people.""  Thor:  ""He's adopted!"") and has the sly deceptive character that the actor brings out so well.Philosophy:  Yeah, always some of that.  Loki prefers to think of Freedom as an aberration, that mankind was made to be ruled by strong rulers and gods.  Great scene of an old man, no doubt a Holocaust survivor, at the Stuttgart, Germany orchestra scene, where the man stands up against Loki - and Cap makes an appearance, makes a speech alluding to the Nazis, before beating up on Loki.Heroes and Villains:  As with other Marvel characters, you have to have some heroes with something to hide, some inner agenda.  SHIELD has secrets - no spoilers - and Cap and the rest smell something bad.Hulk/Bruce Banner - We enter his life in a similar way to the second Hulk movie - hiding out in a foreign country, getting waylaid to help and ends up Hulking out!  A lot of the second half is a Hulk/Thor fest that is really fun to watch.Scripts:  The writing is very much Marvel, you really get the feeling that Stan Lee wrote it!  The Avengers are planning out their next move as the alien invasion is in progress - Captain America is calling the shots - he turns to Hulk and says ""Hulk?  Smash!""  -- Hulk:  Big grin, Rarrh!  Great scene.Bottom Line:  I could go on and on about the great effects, great development and characterization, fast paced action.  The film had a proper balance of effects, fan-style gimmees, and enough humor to entice a wider audience - much better than Thor, Ironman 1, 2, 3 or Hulk (2008) and Captain America: First Avenger for sure == and I loved those films.Tip:  There are TWO after-credit scenes - learn the true meaning of ""Shawarma.""Cast:Robert Downey Jr. Tony Stark / Iron ManChris Evans  Steve Rogers / Captain AmericaMark Ruffalo  Bruce Banner / The HulkChris Hemsworth  ThorScarlett Johansson  Natasha Romanoff / Black WidowJeremy Renner  Clint Barton / HawkeyeTom Hiddleston  Loki",5,Avengers -- Sequel to Four Films!

1211612,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B001KVZ6HK,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[0, 0]","OK, let's get the criticisms out of the way.Not enough of Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton/Hawkeye.If you're a guy, not enough of Cobie Smulders' Maria Hill (My goodness, that catsuit...it actually has made me pay more attention to ""How I Met Your Mother""...).Got it??!?  Because those are about the ONLY complaints there are here.Simply put--the climax of Marvel Studios' Phase I Series got it right.  But honestly, the whole series--the two Iron Man movies, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger--set a great path to this movie.  It stayed true to the essence of the Marvel Universe, which has always dealt with their heroes and their character quirks--humanized their super-humans.  This movie threw together the crew and their quirks--Tony Stark and his general lack of humility, Thor and his imperiousness, Steve Rogers dealing with being out of his time, Bruce Banner and his issues of anger management,and Nick Fury, simultaneously manipulating and cajoling the different individuals to work together.Yet, because Joss Whedon was the writer/director, I wasn't very surprised to see that Joss drew liberally from his ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" years, especially when it came to the expansion of Scarlett Johannsen's Natasha Romanoff from where she was in ""Iron Man II"".  The Black Widow ends up being much more complicated, world weary and vulnerable--giving much depth to her thoughts about having ""red on her ledger"", and the point that she is truly fearful of Dr. Banner's Other Self.  But ScarJo also ends up with those brilliant throwaway lines during the battle for New York that were also so typically Whedon.Performance-wise, no one slacks off.  Robert Downey Jr. still embodies all of Tony Stark's brio and ego.  Chris Evans gives that sense of traditional heroism and loneliness to Steve Rogers.  Chris Hemsworth tones down Thor a little from the movie, but the ""he's adopted"" line--which caused a bit of a minor stir after the release--is timed out perfectly.  Samuel L. Jackson finally sees expanded time in this series as Nick Fury.  Much has been made of Mark Ruffalo's turn as Banner, and it's pitch-perfect.  Mark plays Banner with a little bit of a smile, but certainly knowing what lies beneath himself.  Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson cannot be forgotten--as we've seen in the ""Marvel One-Shot"" episodes that have accompanied the Blu-Ray/DVD releases, Coulson has been a straight man for many of the hijinks of both SHIELD and the heroes.  Seeing him suddenly turn into the gushing fanboy of Captain America ends up being rather charming.The show-stealer in all this--and again, given the director this shouldn't be much of a surprise--is Tom Hiddleston's Loki.  Again, this goes back to the ""Buffyverse"" with Whedon.  Frequently, the ""Big Bad"" during the seven seasons that series ran was an over-the-top destroyer with a smirk.  Hiddleston played Loki in ""Thor"" more as an Agent Provocateur in Kenneth Branagh's eyes.  Whedon takes Loki to the level of Angelus or the Mayor of Sunnydale...but also mixes in some Wile E. Coyote, especially in the ""Destruction of Manhattan""--Loki catching Hawkeye's arrow as if it wasn't a big deal, only to have the arrow expode, knocking Loki off the Skycycle only to be caught by the Hulk, leading to Loki's verbal assault, leading to...well--the best scene of all the summer pictures...Overall--Marvel Studios and Paramount did right with Phase 1, and the culmination is on the short list of The Most Entertaining Movies of 2012.  Certainly, ""The Avengers"" is also in the room as being The Most Fun Superhero Movie Ever.So, let Phase II begin....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,Marvel's The Avengers--Phase 1 Completed.

1211629,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B001KVZ6HK,Sean Pasek,"[0, 0]","When Joss Whedon came on board to helm ""The Avengers,"" I knew that this film was not only in good hands, but that something wondrous would come of it.  Having been the creator, writer, director, and producer of some of the best TV shows in recent years (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly), I was familiar enough with his work to know that the story, dialogue, and characterization would all be well done.  Whedon is a master at balancing all of these things, and not allowing special effects to overshadow the story.Marvel did a very smart thing leading up to The Avengers.  Rather than spending time trying to explain the origins and backgrounds of these six characters, this was already taken care of in their subsequent films leading up to this film.  At nearly two and a half hours, the story wouldn't have to suffer distractions of an hour-long origin introduction.  In other words, they could just jump right in!  And, boy, does The Avengers jump right in!This is easily, in my view, the best superhero team film done yet.  The only thing that matches it is the animated TV series, ""The Justice League.""A crisis is threatening the planet.  It is a threat that no one superhero can deal with on his/her own.  And so, Nick Fury the Director of SHIELD (and wonderfully played by Samuel L. Jackson) has arranged to assemble a group of superheroes to deal with the crisis.  However, the question becomes, can these heroes put aside their egos and differences in order to work together?  This is the question that the film spends half of the time dealing with.Loki is the principal villain in this film, and Tom Hiddleston plays him superbly with a type of cunning and pleasure that Loki is renowned for.  He has made a bargain with beings from another dimension, to help him conquer Earth.  He holds the Cosmic Cube (Tesseract Cube), a source of nearly unlimited power.  Loki agrees to give these beings the cube in exchange for help in his conquest.The members of the Avengers do not come together easily.  We are treated to the first great battle of the film.  Iron Man vs. Thor.  The other thing that makes this film so much fun is that in addition to watching the Avengers fight the villains, we also get to see them fight each other!  Anyone who is a fan of superheros, comic books, or both, hold the eternal debate: who is stronger?  Who can beat whom?  Message boards are littered with people arguing about these things.  And while the film doesn't necessarily answer these questions outright (and the comics rarely do either), it is still fun to watch!  Later on, the ante is ""upped"" when we get to see the two juggernauts of the team go head-to-head: Thor vs. Hulk.When all differences are put aside, and the members of the Avengers realize that they must work together, then we see what happens through the power of unity.All of the actors fit their roles beautifully.  What can be said of Robert Downey Jr. that hasn't already been said?  Whedon's script gives him a chance to shine even brighter than he has in previous films.  Stark must answer the ultimate question for himself: is he willing to give everything of himself to save humanity?Chris Evans is a good Captain America.  In the comics, Cap is the natural leader of the team, and he's always giving strategical orders to the members.  He commands a presence, that regardless of his lack of real power, is highly respected.  I hope to see more of this quality in the next film.Another standout for me is Scarlett Johannson as the Black Widow.  As the only female member of the team, she has a covert intelligence that is sorely needed on the team.  Johannson plays Natasha with a quiet cunning.The final battle scene, which takes up nearly a full hour of the movie, is a battle of epic proportions.  We see the Avengers fighting an endless sea of Loki's minions in the heart of New York.  The battle is superbly done, and it never detracts or overshadows the story.  The build-up to this point gives the film epic climax.The Avengers is just a ton of fun.  But it is a far more complex and deep film than people may realize.  Whedon never loses sight of the human element, which again, is so characteristic of his other heroes like Buffy and Angel; that it isn't so much what you do, but who you are while you're doing it; that there is a lot more to being a hero than simply fighting the bad guys.This epic film will be a fan favorite for a long time to come, and we can only hope that the second entry will be as good as this one was.  And if you want a sneak-peek at the villain for the next installment, then don't turn the film off during the credits!  Nearly everyone in the theater gasped and cheered when they saw who it was!",5,The Pinnacle Superhero Team Film To Date!,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,4716,"['When', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'came', 'board', 'helm', 'Avengers', 'knew', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'hands', 'something', 'wondrous', 'would', 'come', 'Having', 'been', 'creator', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'recent', 'years', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'Firefly', 'was', 'familiar', 'enough', 'work', 'know', 'story', 'dialogue', 'characterization', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'well', 'done', 'Whedon', 'master', 'balancing', 'things', 'not', 'allowing', 'special', 'effects', 'overshadow', 'story.Marvel', 'did', 'very', 'smart', 'thing', 'leading', 'up', 'Avengers', 'Rather', 'spending', 'time', 'trying', 'explain', 'origins', 'backgrounds', 'six', 'characters', 'was', 'already', 'taken', 'care', 'subsequent', 'films', 'leading', 'up', 'film', 'nearly', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'suffer', 'distractions', 'hour-long', 'origin', 'introduction', 'other', 'words', 'could', 'just', 'jump', 'right', 'boy', 'Avengers', 'jump', 'right', 'easily', 'view', 'best', 'superhero', 'team', 'film', 'done', 'yet', 'only', 'thing', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'Justice', 'League', 'crisis', 'threatening', 'planet', 'threat', 'one', 'superhero', 'can', 'deal', 'his/her', 'own', 'so', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Director', 'SHIELD', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'arranged', 'assemble', 'group', 'superheroes', 'deal', 'crisis', 'However', 'question', 'can', 'heroes', 'put', 'aside', 'egos', 'differences', 'order', 'work', 'together', 'question', 'film', 'half', 'time', 'dealing', 'with.Loki', 'principal', 'villain', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'superbly', 'type', 'cunning', 'pleasure', 'Loki', 'renowned', 'made', 'bargain', 'beings', 'dimension', 'help', 'conquer', 'Earth', 'Cosmic', 'Cube', 'Tesseract', 'Cube', 'source', 'nearly', 'unlimited', 'power', 'Loki', 'give', 'beings', 'cube', 'exchange', 'help', 'conquest.The', 'members', 'Avengers', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'together', 'easily', 'are', 'treated', 'first', 'great', 'battle', 'film', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Thor', 'other', 'thing', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'addition', 'watching', 'Avengers', 'fight', 'villains', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'fight', 'other', 'Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'superheros', 'comic', 'books', 'hold', 'eternal', 'debate', 'who', 'stronger', 'Who', 'can', 'beat', 'whom', 'Message', 'boards', 'are', 'littered', 'people', 'arguing', 'things', 'film', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'answer', 'questions', 'outright', 'comics', 'rarely', 'do', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'Later', 'ante', 'upped', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'two', 'juggernauts', 'team', 'go', 'head-to-head', 'Thor', 'vs.', 'Hulk.When', 'differences', 'are', 'put', 'aside', 'members', 'Avengers', 'realize', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'then', 'see', 'what', 'power', 'unity.All', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles', 'beautifully', 'What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'Whedon', 'script', 'chance', 'shine', 'even', 'brighter', 'previous', 'films', 'Stark', 'must', 'answer', 'ultimate', 'question', 'willing', 'give', 'everything', 'save', 'humanity', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'good', 'Captain', 'America', 'comics', 'Cap', 'natural', 'leader', 'team', 'always', 'giving', 'strategical', 'orders', 'members', 'presence', 'regardless', 'lack', 'real', 'power', 'highly', 'respected', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'quality', 'next', 'film.Another', 'standout', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'Black', 'Widow', 'only', 'female', 'member', 'team', 'covert', 'intelligence', 'sorely', 'needed', 'team', 'Johannson', 'Natasha', 'quiet', 'cunning.The', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'up', 'nearly', 'full', 'hour', 'movie', 'battle', 'epic', 'proportions', 'see', 'Avengers', 'fighting', 'endless', 'sea', 'Loki', 'minions', 'heart', 'New', 'York', 'battle', 'superbly', 'done', 'never', 'story', 'build-up', 'point', 'film', 'climax.The', 'Avengers', 'just', 'ton', 'fun', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'deep', 'film', 'people', 'may', 'realize', 'Whedon', 'never', 'sight', 'human', 'element', 'again', 'so', 'characteristic', 'other', 'heroes', 'Buffy', 'Angel', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'what', 'do', 'who', 'are', ""'re"", 'doing', 'lot', 'more', 'being', 'hero', 'simply', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guys.This', 'epic', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'fan', 'favorite', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'second', 'entry', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'was', 'want', 'sneak-peek', 'villain', 'next', 'installment', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'film', 'credits', 'Nearly', 'everyone', 'theater', 'gasped', 'cheered', 'when', 'saw', 'who', 'was']",Marvel's: The Avengers

The beginning of the movie was painfully boring and I (who usually avoids food concession stands) grabbed a pink lemonade to stay awake. Because I'm not usually into superheroes I thought, ""Maybe it's just me,"" but when I glanced over at my mother (who LOVES this kind of stuff) falling asleep I knew something was wrong. This movie did not pick up until Richard Downey Jr. came on the scene as Iron Man (and I own both ""Iron Man"" movies solely because he was SO good at blending sarcasm, humor, action, a great story line and the usual superhero come-to-our-rescue plot together). That's when I sat up and paid attention. Then Iron Man started messing with The Hulk, another character I used to get into as a kid. That's when I stopped daydreaming.I shrugged through Captain America's heroism because it seemed forced like a Ken doll. Black Widow didn't do it for me, and the film spent entirely too much time showing the back of her costume or her glaring at someone. Again, too forced. I saw the movie ""Thor"" and neither Thor or Loki were interesting to me, although I did find Idris Elba's character Heimdall pretty cool. Unfortunately Heimdall wasn't in this film, which was a disappointment.But right when I was all set to go to the bowling alley next door and let my mother watch the movie alone, the movie picked up speed. The more Downey's Iron Man and Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner (The Hulk) were on the screen, the less I slumped in my seat. And when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk, I FINALLY got into the film. Watching superhero characters save the day just doesn't do it for me. It's the actors and the dialogue that'll make me cheer for those superheroes, and The Hulk and Iron Man were as funny in their costumes as they were outside of them. There were moments when I (and the huge audience surrounding me) laughed out loud at The Hulk's antics. Those saved this film.Would I buy it? No. But I'm definitely looking forward to seeing ""Iron Man 3"" as soon as it releases and would be interested in ""The Hulk"" movie (if there ever is one).",3,Started off dreadfully slow but then picked up,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,2219,"[""n't"", 'type', 'movie', ""'d"", 'want', 'go', 'see', 'theater', 'was', 'Mother', 'Day', 'mother', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'two', 'weeks', 'got', 'wish', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'painfully', 'boring', 'who', 'usually', 'avoids', 'food', 'concession', 'grabbed', 'pink', 'lemonade', 'stay', 'awake', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'superheroes', 'thought', 'Maybe', 'just', 'when', 'glanced', 'over', 'mother', 'who', 'LOVES', 'kind', 'stuff', 'falling', 'asleep', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'Richard', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'came', 'scene', 'Iron', 'Man', 'own', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'solely', 'was', 'SO', 'good', 'blending', 'sarcasm', 'humor', 'action', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'usual', 'superhero', 'come-to-our-rescue', 'plot', 'together', 'when', 'sat', 'up', 'paid', 'attention', 'Then', 'Iron', 'Man', 'started', 'messing', 'Hulk', 'character', 'used', 'get', 'kid', 'when', 'stopped', 'daydreaming.I', 'shrugged', 'Captain', 'America', 'heroism', 'seemed', 'forced', 'Ken', 'doll', 'Black', 'Widow', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'spent', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'showing', 'back', 'costume', 'glaring', 'someone', 'Again', 'too', 'forced', 'saw', 'movie', 'Thor', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'were', 'interesting', 'did', 'find', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'character', 'Heimdall', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Unfortunately', 'Heimdall', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'was', 'disappointment.But', 'right', 'when', 'was', 'set', 'go', 'bowling', 'alley', 'next', 'door', 'let', 'mother', 'watch', 'movie', 'alone', 'movie', 'picked', 'up', 'speed', 'more', 'Downey', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'were', 'screen', 'less', 'slumped', 'seat', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'turned', 'Hulk', 'FINALLY', 'got', 'film', 'Watching', 'superhero', 'characters', 'save', 'day', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'actors', 'dialogue', ""'ll"", 'make', 'cheer', 'superheroes', 'Hulk', 'Iron', 'Man', 'were', 'funny', 'costumes', 'were', 'outside', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'huge', 'audience', 'surrounding', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'Hulk', 'antics', 'saved', 'film.Would', 'buy', 'No', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'as', 'soon', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'ever', 'one']",Marvel's: The Avengers

1211655,A1ZAL70XAQ3JRO,B001KVZ6HK,S. Horn,"[0, 0]","Not much more can be said about this movie than has already been said about it.  The movie is a comic book come to life, perhaps the first of its kind.  Marvel has spent the past 4 years developling their Cinematic Universe, resulting in this masterpiece that recently even came under fire from Christopher Nolan's cinematographer (not understanding all that, but it was disregarded).  What started as mentions of SHIELD and Captain America's shield in Iron Man in 2008, culminated in a cameo appearance by Nick Fury who actually name-drops The Avengers.  Now, in 2012, we get a team up picture featuring the solo characters from their own franchises:  Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and Captain America.One liberty taken for this movie was character development, but remember, Marvel developed these characters over the course of 4 years, giving the main characters their own movies to develop character and give the origin stories required to explain who everyone was.  That said, it is strongly recommended that you watch Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger before you sit down to enjoy this movie.  It will help with your understanding of why the characters are where they are and why they are doing what they are doing.  What results is a witty, action packed movie that fully entertains the entire time.  There are moments that can be nitpicked, such as Thor's appearance, which negates the finale to his own film, and no mention whatsoever of the other hero, War Machine, who was introduced and used by the US government in Iron Man 2 during an alien attack of New York, but those are moments that do not ruin the movie completely.  Memorable scenes you will walk away with are the Hulk's handling of Loki, the team coming together culminating in Captain America's marching orders to each person, and a couple more, now tradmark, post-credits scenes.Of course we were bound to get a mega combo pack, something that came in the form of a Blu-Ray 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital/Soundtrack (and also a regular combo pack and single DVD and Blu-Ray releases), maybe the first of its kind to have so much together at once.  The special features are actually not as great as you would think or hope, although there is a commentary by writer/director, Joss Whedon.  There is no 'Making Of' feature, outside of a couple short moments discussing the actors and the formation of the team through the course of the 4 year period developing the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  A Marvel One-Shot short film, Item 47, is present, featuring characters from the movie, and set within the MCU, and it does not disappoint.  Also featured are some deleted scenes that, for example, shed light on Captain America's acclamation into present day society.  However, it was briefly mentioned before the release that there may be a Director's Cut of the film, with as much as 30-40 minutes of deleted scenes added in to the movie, but sadly, this is no where to be seen on this giant release.  Does this mean Marvel will double-dip with a further release in the future?  The answer is probably a resounding yes, which is unfortunate for people who bought this thinking it would be the ultimate release.  But, this movie has made loads of money, both from its release in theaters and from the home release, so it goes to stand that it would make even more with a further release of all-new material at some point in the future.  Other highlights include a digital copy (which is curiously not present on either the other Blu-Ray packs or solo Blu-Ray or DVD releases) and the soundtrack download, a cool code that allows you to get the entire soundtrack from online, for free.  This combo is packed to the gill with stuff, just not everything that could have been, or that was even discussed before the final release.That all said, definitely get a combo pack to enjoy the film in either all its Blu-Ray glory, as this movie is fantastic seen on 1080p and with a full audio surround sound transfer.  Despite the shortcomings of the home release, get this movie and share with friends and family, whether they've seen it already or not (and chances are they have seen it), this will only get better with age.  And we'll all be in line again waiting for Marvel to show else they have their sleeve, from a further release of The Avengers on Blu-Ray, all the way to Phase 2 beginning with Iron Man 3 in 2013.",5,A Modern Achievement in Film & Entertainment,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,4416,"['Not', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'perhaps', 'first', 'kind', 'Marvel', 'spent', 'past', '4', 'years', 'developling', 'Cinematic', 'Universe', 'resulting', 'masterpiece', 'recently', 'even', 'came', 'fire', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'cinematographer', 'not', 'understanding', 'was', 'disregarded', 'What', 'started', 'mentions', 'SHIELD', 'Captain', 'America', 'shield', 'Iron', 'Man', '2008', 'culminated', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'who', 'actually', 'name-drops', 'Avengers', 'Now', '2012', 'get', 'team', 'up', 'picture', 'featuring', 'solo', 'characters', 'own', 'franchises', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America.One', 'liberty', 'taken', 'movie', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'remember', 'Marvel', 'developed', 'characters', 'course', '4', 'years', 'giving', 'main', 'characters', 'own', 'movies', 'develop', 'character', 'give', 'origin', 'stories', 'required', 'explain', 'who', 'everyone', 'was', 'said', 'strongly', 'recommended', 'watch', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'help', 'understanding', 'why', 'characters', 'are', 'where', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'What', 'results', 'witty', 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'fully', 'entire', 'time', 'are', 'moments', 'can', 'be', 'nitpicked', 'such', 'Thor', 'appearance', 'finale', 'own', 'film', 'mention', 'whatsoever', 'other', 'hero', 'War', 'Machine', 'who', 'was', 'introduced', 'used', 'US', 'government', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'alien', 'attack', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'moments', 'do', 'not', 'ruin', 'movie', 'completely', 'Memorable', 'scenes', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'are', 'Hulk', 'handling', 'Loki', 'team', 'coming', 'together', 'culminating', 'Captain', 'America', 'marching', 'orders', 'person', 'couple', 'more', 'now', 'tradmark', 'post-credits', 'scenes.Of', 'course', 'were', 'bound', 'get', 'mega', 'combo', 'pack', 'something', 'came', 'form', 'Blu-Ray', '3D/Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital/Soundtrack', 'also', 'regular', 'combo', 'pack', 'single', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'releases', 'maybe', 'first', 'kind', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'together', 'once', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'actually', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'would', 'think', 'hope', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', ""'Making"", 'feature', 'couple', 'short', 'moments', 'discussing', 'actors', 'formation', 'team', 'course', '4', 'year', 'period', 'developing', 'Marvel', 'Cinematic', 'Universe', 'Marvel', 'One-Shot', 'short', 'film', 'Item', '47', 'present', 'featuring', 'characters', 'movie', 'set', 'MCU', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Also', 'featured', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'example', 'shed', 'light', 'Captain', 'America', 'acclamation', 'present', 'day', 'society', 'However', 'was', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'release', 'may', 'be', 'Director', 'Cut', 'film', 'as', 'much', '30-40', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'added', 'movie', 'sadly', 'where', 'be', 'seen', 'giant', 'release', 'mean', 'Marvel', 'will', 'double-dip', 'further', 'release', 'future', 'answer', 'probably', 'resounding', 'yes', 'unfortunate', 'people', 'who', 'bought', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'ultimate', 'release', 'movie', 'made', 'loads', 'money', 'release', 'theaters', 'home', 'release', 'stand', 'would', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'further', 'release', 'all-new', 'material', 'point', 'future', 'Other', 'highlights', 'include', 'digital', 'copy', 'curiously', 'not', 'present', 'other', 'Blu-Ray', 'packs', 'solo', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'releases', 'soundtrack', 'download', 'cool', 'code', 'get', 'entire', 'soundtrack', 'online', 'free', 'combo', 'packed', 'gill', 'stuff', 'just', 'not', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'even', 'discussed', 'final', 'release.That', 'said', 'definitely', 'get', 'combo', 'pack', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Blu-Ray', 'glory', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'seen', '1080p', 'full', 'audio', 'surround', 'sound', 'transfer', 'shortcomings', 'home', 'release', 'get', 'movie', 'share', 'friends', 'family', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'not', 'chances', 'are', 'have', 'seen', 'will', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'age', ""'ll"", 'be', 'line', 'again', 'waiting', 'Marvel', 'show', 'else', 'have', 'sleeve', 'further', 'release', 'Avengers', 'Blu-Ray', 'way', 'Phase', '2', 'beginning', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', '2013']",Marvel's: The Avengers

It really doesn't get much better than this for fans that have been waiting for a film adaptation to FINALLY bring The Avengers together.Everything about The Avengers movie was excellent...from the cool, unique story that Writer Zak Penn and Director Joss Whedon came up with to the devoted way the cast portrayed the characters. Just brilliant.The Avengers kind of picks up where the Thor movie ended. Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye to stop Loki (Thor's brother) from opening a portal that would allow beings from an alternate universe in to destroy Earth.What ensues is an awesome looking, action-packed movie that's pretty long but goes by very quickly. Even the dialogue--especially scenes with Tony Stark--is as witty and entertaining as anything that I've heard in any movie that I've seen in recent history. The modern dynamic of the character personalities and how they interact with one another take this film to a new level for a superhero movie. Dramatic, emotional and sometimes spot on hilarious. Man, I am still cracking up over one of the scenes that featured The Hulk and Loki ""having a discussion"".We may take for granted that we live in a time when the CGI has practically been perfected in order to really make a spectacular movie. The CGI in The Avengers is masterful. It will be many, many years from now before we might ever giggle at the CGI in this movie the way we do at some of the older and even more current CGI efforts.In closing I will say that every fan of the individual movies made with the Avengers superheroes knows that there was always an after-credits scene that hinted at events to come, and The Avengers does not break that tradition. But wow...if the ambitious implication of the after-credits scene in The Avengers ever has a hope of coming to true fruition it may take an unprecedented unification of movie studios. Avengers comic book readers know that The Avengers team is not limited to the superheroes included in the movie.

In my opinion, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, and Chris Evans all gave strong and convincing performances in their roles as Ironman, Captain America, and Thor.  It was also entertaining watching Scarlet Johansson's Natasha Romanoff character holding her own when confronting Mark Ruffalo's Dr. Bruce character.  My husband's favorite character was that of Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. I can understand this because Hiddleston plays a powerful and complex being who proves to be a strong challenge for Thor.  For me, it is a tie between Downey's Ironman character and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury persona.  Downey plays the role of being the braintrust in deciding how to defeat Loki.

1211703,AJ1XZYGXJGKU4,B001KVZ6HK,Stephen C. Coyle,"[1, 1]","Many of you younger people out there (and those of you who didn't collect comics in your youth) don't remember when Stan Lee got up on his soap box (I believe this was back in 1977) and he promised us that he was going to be creating some movies for the people that were fans of Marvel comics.He promised us an X-Men movie.  He promised us a Silver Surfer movie.  He promised us a Sub-Mariner movie.  He promised us a Spider-Man movie.  He promised us an Iron Man movie.  He promised us an incredible Hulk movie.  He promised us a Fantastic Four movie.  He promised us a Conan the Barbarian movie.  He promised us a Captain America movie.And he promised us an Avengers movie.Being a small child at the time (I was about ten years old when he made this announcement) I didn't realize how complicated and expensive it could be to make a movie.  I assumed that all of these movies would be up on the big screen within a year or two.I certainly didn't realize that it could take over three decades for a movie to come out!And yet, despite the long wait, I think that this movie was worth waiting for.Back in the 1970s we wouldn't have had awesome special effects, costumes, props, sets and other eye-candy that we have in this 2012 movie.Back in the 1970s we wouldn't have had this absolutely breathtaking rendition of the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier.Back in the 1970s they wouldn't have been able to create the astounding set of combat armor that Iron Man wears in the movie.Back in the 1970s we wouldn't have had this visually impressive CGI Hulk, either.Back in the 1970s an alien invasion fleet trashing New York City wouldn't have looked anywhere near this cool or visually impressive.And let's be honest; who would they have gotten to play Nick Fury, Iron Man and the Black Widow back in the 1970s?  Certainly not Samuel Jackson, Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson.And perhaps the biggest tragedy of all would have been the fact that Joss Whedon wouldn't have been able to direct.I'm a big fan of Joss's work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly and I was thrilled to hear he'd be directing this movie.  He's a great director with great ideas and his direction and influence took a movie that *could* have been awkward and conflicted and blended in the different characters, plot points, heroes and dramatic moments seamlessly.  And the comedy added into this movie was classic Joss.Many of Tony Stark's line were hilarious, so was the way Black Widow interrogated the Russian arms dealers at the beginning of the movie, as was Stan Lee's line at the end of the movie.I highly recommend this movie to any comic book fan.  I highly recommend it to any Joss Whedon fan.  I highly recommend it to any Robert Downey Jr fan, any Scarlett Johansson fan, any Samuel Jackson fan, or pretty much anybody with a pulse.",5,Over 30 years in the making....but well worth the wait.,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2815,"['Many', 'younger', 'people', 'there', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'collect', 'comics', 'youth', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'when', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'got', 'up', 'soap', 'box', 'believe', 'was', 'back', '1977', 'promised', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'creating', 'movies', 'people', 'were', 'fans', 'Marvel', 'comics.He', 'promised', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'promised', 'Silver', 'Surfer', 'movie', 'promised', 'Sub-Mariner', 'movie', 'promised', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'promised', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'promised', 'incredible', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'promised', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'movie', 'promised', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'movie', 'promised', 'Captain', 'America', 'movie.And', 'promised', 'Avengers', 'movie.Being', 'small', 'child', 'time', 'was', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'made', 'announcement', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'complicated', 'expensive', 'could', 'be', 'make', 'movie', 'assumed', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'year', 'two.I', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'could', 'take', 'over', 'three', 'decades', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'yet', 'long', 'wait', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'waiting', 'for.Back', '1970s', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'costumes', 'props', 'sets', 'other', 'eye-candy', 'have', '2012', 'movie.Back', '1970s', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'rendition', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'Helicarrier.Back', '1970s', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'create', 'astounding', 'set', 'combat', 'armor', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie.Back', '1970s', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'visually', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'Hulk', 'either.Back', '1970s', 'alien', 'invasion', 'fleet', 'trashing', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'looked', 'anywhere', 'cool', 'visually', 'impressive.And', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'play', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Black', 'Widow', 'back', '1970s', 'Certainly', 'not', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson.And', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'tragedy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fact', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'direct.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Joss', 'work', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Firefly', 'was', 'thrilled', 'hear', ""'d"", 'be', 'directing', 'movie', 'great', 'director', 'great', 'ideas', 'direction', 'influence', 'took', 'movie', '*could*', 'have', 'been', 'awkward', 'conflicted', 'blended', 'different', 'characters', 'plot', 'points', 'heroes', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'seamlessly', 'comedy', 'added', 'movie', 'was', 'classic', 'Joss.Many', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'line', 'were', 'hilarious', 'so', 'was', 'way', 'Black', 'Widow', 'interrogated', 'Russian', 'arms', 'dealers', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'line', 'end', 'movie.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'fan', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'fan', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'fan', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'fan', 'pretty', 'much', 'anybody', 'pulse']",Marvel's: The Avengers

Since then, we have been introduced to all the major players in four well-crafted films (""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Iron Man 2,"" ""Thor,"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") that each stand on their own as a well-crafted superhero films, but also serve to establish the larger Marvel universe that would come together in ""The Avengers."" With writer-director Joss Whedon (""Serenity,"" ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") at the helm, there was no doubt that this would be a remarkable film. But I was not prepared for what I experienced: the greatest superhero film yet made!What really drives this film are the characters. I was pleasantly surprised by how the four main leads (Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and Mark Ruffalo, replacing Ed Norton as Bruce Banner), having come off of lead roles in their own films, meshed very well together. We see the tension amongst them, as the differing egos come together for the first time, even as they try to stem the tide of a major threat. This really is an ensemble cast, and each actor does very well in their roles.The movie has incredible action sequences, and some exceptional visual effects work. But all of this would be for naught if the story failed to deliver. And the script, penned by Whedon and Zack Penn, delivers a story that is exciting, dramatic, humorous, and everything film-goers expect from an awesome film. And when put in the hands of a top-notch cast, you have the recipe for a superhero film unlike any other!If the film has any drawbacks, there is but one, and it has nothing to do with the film itself. If you are unfamiliar with the comic books from which the movie is based, or have not seen the five films leading up to it, then you might be a bit lost with everything. But for those who are diehard aficionados of the Marvel universe and films, this is the payoff we all wanted, and more.

It had everything that would make a superhero movie right: action, adventure, story, comedy, etc... I am aware that there are many Nolan nut-huggers out there that purposely try retaliate by coming onto avengers forums and discussion boards just to start some kind of rivalry that fairly pointless and inane. Don't get me wrong, as much as I like Nolan's work, this review is NOT for people who are clearly set on trying to prove that the batman series is better.As far as summer blockbusters go, there is PLENTY of stiff competition to be had. Competing with the the well respected Batman series directed by Nolan as well as the newly revamped Spiderman is no easy task. Assembling a cast like this with big name stars has been done MANY times. A lot of them fail. This one surely does NOT. You would think that each star would want his/her share of the limelight, but this movie interweaves the story so intricately, that the character interactions are seamless. There were scenes where I was so absorbed in the story, that I didn't blink. The story may not be most original, but who cares?!?!? It was highly enjoyable and the story was coherent. The dialogue between characters were very believable because not everyone gets along with everybody. People clash in personalities and it is reflected in the assembling of the Avengers. It is working toward a common goal that brings them to work together as a single unit and process they go through is nothing short of magical.I highly recommend this movie and would hope people can put aside their preconceived notions to give this a try.

1211736,AHNT97DWEAQUY,B001KVZ6HK,"Sumbudy ""buriedatlantis""","[0, 0]","I think there was some question as to whether Joss Whedon could pull this off.  Had he ever directed anything with such scale?  Could he handle something bigger than a TV budget?  In hindsight, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise.  His whole career has led to this moment.  He's dealt with epic storylines full of set ups and big payoffs for years, just on TV.  Juggling several characters at once has become his bread and butter.  All that was left was could he handle the scale.Yes, yes he can.  This movie leads up to pure spectacle.  We get to see all the heroes we've spent several individual movies coming to know team up to stop the epicdestruction of New York.  It's all well handled with great individual moments amongst the team and some great moments of team work sprinkled in as well.  All thecharacters and their specific powers come into play in all sorts of glorious and camera loving ways as the heroes rain justice on the invading Chitari.  The Hulk in particular has plenty of crowd pleasing moments.That is the payoff.  The set up is what makes the movie work.  The assembling of the Avengers as we catch up to all the various characters from where we left themin their individual movies and then try to gel them together is where I think the real fun of the movie is.  All these guys are different in so many ways; the playboy, the scientist, the spy, the soldier and the demi-god.  The genius of the flick is that it took these characters from movies ranging from the realism of Iron Man, the war-movie of Captain America and the fantasy of Thor and made them gel together in a very believable way.  Sure, it works in the comic books all the time, but film is a different medium.  The fact that Marvel pulled it off is almost miraculous. And the first hour or so of the movie that Whedon and team build the characters and show them learn to interact and play well together really pays off when The Avengers have to save the world.The blu-ray looks and sounds great.  I don't think anyone will be surprised by that.  This is one of the biggest movies of all time, so of course Disney and Marvel are gonna make it look good with some nice spit and polish.  Not that it probably needed a whole lot of spit and polish, it was already pretty spectacular looking.  Not gonna lie, though, I was hoping for some more extras.  We get a few deleted/extended scenes and a cute little 10 minute short movie about a young couple robbing banks with the one remaining alien weapon left over from the main event.  There a couple of short docs chronicling various aspects of the movie, but I was just hoping for a little more meat on those bones.  A landmark movie like this calls for big time full length documentaries and interviews and just really digging into the making, marketing and aftermath of the film.  Alas, that's not to be.  Here anyways.It's a nice Blu-Ray, don't get me wrong.  Very worthy of adding to your collection for just the epic scope of superhero storytelling on display in the main movie.  I was hoping for a bit more in the special features arena, but it's not enough of a gripe to mark it down.  I'm sure down the road we'll get an edition full of even more scenes, big time documentaries, a commentary from Samuel L. Jackson in character as Jules from Pulp Fiction and other wild and off the wall geek pandering stuff.

I like comic book films, I really enjoyed much of what X-men put out, and I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's Batman. First of all, this movie pretty much requires you to watch at least some of the previous movies with each individual character. I watched and was mildly entertained by Iron Man, liked Norton in The Hulk, and had the absolute displeasure of sitting through the garbage that was Captain America. Now, I never got around to Thor, so maybe that detracted from me liking this movie since from what I understand, the main villan was introduced in the Thor movie.The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining in that it brings all the characters together. Where the lose me is the same way that Transformers and a lot of these other films are. The last half or quarter of the movie is some long drawn out CGI fight-fest. It's straight out of a video game sequence. Some may like that, I just don't, it loses my attention in the chaos.It's too bad because there are some good performances here. Downey Jr steals the show with his wit and sarcasm,Chris Hemsworth and Ruffalo also play there characters well. Evans continues his stiff depiction of Captain America, Samuel L Jackson does his Samuel L. Jackson thing, and I'm still trying to figure out what the heck Scarlett Johansson was doing there. Oh, and Jeremey Renner is in every movie now.I'm not saying it's a bad movie, and from the box office numbers people love it. But the substance just wasn't there. Maybe they expect you too spend 10+ hours meeting the characters in the previous films and then turn on this bad boy to see some action.

1211783,A2GBS30BHAC6QF,B001KVZ6HK,That Guy,"[1, 2]","The Avengers is just great, the fact that Marvel decided to do something no other production could or would do. They made movies with their characters individually and linked them all together in one continuity, before all superhero characters in movies were in their own self contained universe. Warner who owns DC comics did this as well, even though they own the rights. You would think having all these characters together in one movie and give them all enough screen time would be hard, but Whedon who is a comic book fan pulls it off..The movie has great action, humor and looks great, I would recommend seeing all the other movies first if you haven't yet. Iron Man,The Incredible Hulk,Thor and Captain America in order. Even if your not a comic book fan I think your going to enjoy this film.I only had two complaints with Avengers.1.Them replacing Ed Norton with Mark Ruffalo, granted Ruffalo did a great job in the role, I just always had a pet peeve when Hollywood replaces main actors with someone different in sequels etc. For me it just messes with the flow,especially if they look nothing alike, again it is a minor complaint when you see how great the movie is it works.2. There is a deleted scene with Captain America/Steve Rogers, I wish they would have left in the movie, it worked well with the character trying to adjust to modern times, and it explained a question I had about a minor talking part character toward the end of the movie. In the theatre I thought she appeared quite a bit in some scenes at the end and didn't know why. The deleted scene answered the question for me.The movie on Blu ray looks great, and was an excellent transfer. I loved the extras and was worth the purchase.In closing if you haven't seen this movie yet, I would highly recommend seeing it, even if your not in to superheroes, and again as I said before seeing the previous movies would help a lot, granted you don't have to watch them to enjoy The Avengers, but it would help greatly in understanding the characters and how the team was brought together.",5,It is one of the best superhero movies ever made.,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2061,"['Avengers', 'just', 'great', 'fact', 'Marvel', 'decided', 'do', 'something', 'other', 'production', 'could', 'would', 'do', 'made', 'movies', 'characters', 'individually', 'linked', 'together', 'one', 'continuity', 'superhero', 'characters', 'movies', 'were', 'own', 'self', 'contained', 'universe', 'Warner', 'who', 'DC', 'comics', 'did', 'well', 'even', 'own', 'rights', 'would', 'think', 'having', 'characters', 'together', 'one', 'movie', 'give', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'Whedon', 'who', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'off..The', 'movie', 'great', 'action', 'humor', 'great', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'other', 'movies', 'first', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'order', 'Even', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'think', 'going', 'enjoy', 'film.I', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'complaints', 'Avengers.1.Them', 'replacing', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'granted', 'Ruffalo', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'just', 'always', 'had', 'pet', 'peeve', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'replaces', 'main', 'actors', 'someone', 'different', 'sequels', 'etc', 'just', 'flow', 'especially', 'look', 'nothing', 'alike', 'again', 'minor', 'complaint', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'works.2', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Captain', 'America/Steve', 'Rogers', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'movie', 'worked', 'well', 'character', 'trying', 'adjust', 'modern', 'times', 'explained', 'question', 'had', 'minor', 'talking', 'part', 'character', 'end', 'movie', 'theatre', 'thought', 'appeared', 'quite', 'bit', 'scenes', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'deleted', 'scene', 'answered', 'question', 'me.The', 'movie', 'Blu', 'ray', 'great', 'was', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'loved', 'extras', 'was', 'purchase.In', 'closing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'even', 'not', 'superheroes', 'again', 'said', 'seeing', 'previous', 'movies', 'would', 'help', 'lot', 'granted', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'Avengers', 'would', 'help', 'greatly', 'understanding', 'characters', 'how', 'team', 'was', 'brought', 'together']",Marvel's: The Avengers

The frequent cameo appearances by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in all the films hinted at the coming of this film. They goofed, and didn't introduce Fury in the first Iron Man (unless you watched post credits) and forced us to sit through a cliche filled second one so they could fit in Jackson and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson).Loki, with ""ancient knowledge and a new purpose"" has returned (""the door opens from both sides"") and absconds with the Tesseract, a device of unlimited power. Loki is bent upon world destruction/domination. Nick Fury and the Black Widow travel the world to assemble a crack team of superheroes to save the planet. It is during this time we get a brief re-introduction of the characters: The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner introduced in ""Thor"") and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Thor comes in later. He sees the Loki issue as a family problem and doesn't want the Avengers butting in. This creates a brief three sided fight.The film also boasts some good dialouge and many decent one liners especially for those who relish a good chiamus:Captain America: ""Wait. We have to plan our attack.""Iron Man: ""I have a plan. Attack.""The production recreates the quirky characterizations. Iron Man is an egomaniac. Hulk is the reluctant hero. Black Widow is ever confident. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is sexy and intelligent. Captain America is the naive patriot. Lou Ferrigno (who else could it be?) is the voice of a larger Hulk than in the past. As expected, having a villain with the strength of the gods is not enough. There has to be some minor infighting due to personality differences.The film includes a good blend of action, comedy, great special effects, and has a fairly decent plot at that. It does help to have seen the other films, especially ""Thor"", but it is not a requirement if you have some inkling of the superheroes mentioned.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

1211805,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B001KVZ6HK,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[4, 8]","The core of the Avengers for the longest time was Captain America (the leader; the heart of the team), Iron Man (the technologist and financier; the brains of the team), and Thor (the raw power; the muscle of the team).  All other roster invites or additions (including the Hulk, who only played prominent in the original comics for a very short time) added something additional to the onion (including flavor) but the main three were indispensable.  So as Marvel's ""The Avengers"" bows to kick off a franchise, how does it do and does it live up to its characters?  We'll see.  (ALERT: some SPOILERS below)The great: simply put this movie overall is a fantastically fun time at the theaters (and is worth the 3-D change).  Whedon and company have done a very good job with balancing the screen time, presence, shortcomings and hero statures of all the characters (save for Nick Fury).  All of our heroes are ultimately portrayed in satisfying ways.  And the movie is flat-out funny at times.  I mean genuine laugh-out-loud funny moments.  Whedon knows what this is (a superhero movie with larger than life comic book characters) and he plays to types, not against, and does not try to dramatize the proceedings.  He knows the core of the characters (save for, perhaps, Nick Fury) and lets them have their day.  Steve Rogers, despite having only recently been thawed out and coming from a World at war with itself, still calls out people for what they are, most notably Tony Stark.  Stark, too, responds to ""the old man's"" ideals and is elevated by this by the end of the movie while ever maintaining his sharp tongue and acerbic wit.  Mark Ruffalo does a great job as Bruce Banner and imbues him with tragedy and dignity.The good: Tom Hiddleston as Loki has some nice moments of treachery and makes for a very good villain.  He gets close and personal to all of the characters and is able to sow seeds of dissension that bear fruit.  Watching our heros break down and fight against each other, especially Thor and Iron Man smacking each other around, get the fanboy juices going.  Scenes with the Hulk are fairly brief but all are also fairly inspired and an end scene with the Hulk facing off against Loki's rantings about how superior he is only to be cut short by the Hulk thrashing him back and forth into the floor whilst holding him by the foot are hilarious (well placed humor).  Scarlett Johansson does a bang-up job as the Black Widow and teaches Loki a thing or two about trickery.  Yo really cheer for this scarred character in this movie.  Hawkeye being taken over by and fighting for Loki was an unexpected treat (Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye, is one of my personal favorite characters from the original Avengers and I loved it when they set him up as team leader of the off-shoot West Coast Avengers; for those in the know in the movie his character is modeled after the Hawkeye from the Ultimates' universe).  Also, the 3-D and other technical effects of the film are all very good, very polished.The okay: speaking of the effects, though they are well-done, they will not blow you away.  Very little about this movie will make you go ""wow, I've never seen that before"".  That's okay because (A) every movie simply can't do this or live up to this standard and (B) that's not what this movie is about.  I only discuss this as so many people are always looking for ""the next big thing"" or expecting something new that will straighten their socks.  This is especially true of the bland aliens and the invasion plot; they are a MacGuffin, a simple contrivance with the purpose of fulfilling the real purpose of the film: bringing a band of disparate heroes together and uniting them.  Also, while the movie shows us that Captain America has become the leader of the team, it doesn't show this in nearly as strong or clear a way as it could.  Some people might like the subtlety of the approach they took; I wish they would have been more heavy-handed in showing his compatriots showing their deference and respect toward him (yes, even the snarky Stark).  But I will freely admit that this is a personal criticism.  And while having the team convene to finally put an end to Loki's threats, all standing around practically over him, showing a united front and fulfilling Tony Stark's earlier prophecy, for me it would have been more satisfying to have Captain A or even Black Widow or Hawkeye put him down for the count using some form of trickery paired with force.  But, again, that's just my thoughts and preference.  I am a fanboy myself after all...The bad: they miss the mark with Fury.  Samuel L. Jackson can chew scenery like no other and Nick Fury in the pages can do this too.  They have him by somewhat of a sop in this movie, always behind the scenes playing the chess game and making the necessary moves, always slick but also neutered to a certain extent too.  I understand that he is modeled also after the Ultimates' Fury but that guy was bada** as well as slick.  You loved to hate him.  Here, he doesn't inspire.  And he doesn't threaten.  Missed opportunity.  Suprisingly, the movie starts off slow and takes some time to hit a stride.The ugly: paying more than it will cost to pick up a Blu-ray of this movie for two people to see it in the theater.  But I am gonna see it again!My final thoughts are that Iron Man and Thor were better movies than The Avengers but that The Avengers succeeds at doing what it set out to do: bringing together the greatest superhero team that the world has ever known (this side of the DC universe), all the while keeping a smile on your face.  4.5 stars.",4,"Are the parts better than the whole?

No one on Earth has the power to fight these extraterrestrials, so Nick Fury in desperation, calls in Bruce Banner (the Hulk), Tony Stark (Ironman), Thor, and Steve Rogers (Captain America) to band together and stop Loki. However, they are a volatile, unruly group that simply don't get along and don't trust SHIELD's motives. Can they put aside their petty differences and distrust of SHIELD long enough to save the world?I was very excited to see The Avengers because I enjoyed all of the films leading up to it and their characters, but especially because Joss Whedon was directing. I think this is one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen and I believe it is thanks to Whedon. He brought a lot of humor throughout the film, even during the most heartbreaking moments. I don't remember ever laughing so hard in any superhero movie. There were even moments when dialogue was unintelligible because the whole audience was roaring with laughter.He also fleshed out the minor characters wonderfully. In the previous movies, I couldn't care less about Hawkeye and Black Widow. Hawkeye had a super small part in Thor and did practically nothing. Black Widow in Iron Man 2 was super flat and only really there for eye candy and cool fight scenes. In The Avengers, Hawkeye is instrumental to the story and he updates the bow from a practically obsolete relic (compared to guns and other firearms) to something useful and dangerous. His sense of loyalty and justice really made him a cool character, as well as his relationship with Black Widow. Black Widow is also very important to the plot. She gets to show off how she is actually a good spy by playing the victim and getting those who would think themselves above her to reveal their plans. She is much more than just a pretty face and we get to see how is she is underneath her strong exterior. I liked that these two characters aren't marginalized because they are weaker than the other super heroes. They prove to be important in their own right and are allowed to actually develop as dynamic characters.One of the things I was afraid of was one superhero or another dominating the movie. This film masterfully balances each hero. Each make mistakes and look silly at one point and they also all have great, shining moments of heroism. They all bring something that the others don't have and make this disparate, hodge podge group into a real team. Captain America is a great tactician who sees each person's strength and how best to utilize that strength on the battlefield. Iron Man thinks outside the box and has incredible intelligence beyond that huge ego of his. Bruce Banner is also extremely smart, but also turns into a huge, strong rage monster when he transforms. Thor is practically immortal with a powerful hammer, the ability to fly, and power over thunder and lightning. These larger than life characters are lot to stuff into one movie, but they end up being a well balanced, powerful team.The last act of the film is the giant splodey extraterrestrial battle for New York. The comparisons to the Transformers are cringeworthy, but not complete unfounded. There are a few key differences, one being that The Avengers is actually a good, coherent movie that doesn't entirely rely on special effects. Another is that while the Transformers movies have cool shots of buildings exploding and falling down and CGI fight scenes, but the human element is lost. In The Avengers, the people running and screaming from the attack are a focus in the middle of this battle. We even follow a particular waitress as she runs from location to location and is finally saved by Captain America. This makes the audience care about the civilians and actually worry when buildings collapse and debris is falling everywhere.The Avengers is a spectacular superhero film that takes the characters we know and gives them portrays them in a much deeper way and keeps that human element in a huge, epic fight. I also really liked the banter between the characters, the humor throughout, and especially the deviously manipulative, sinister Loki. I have seen it 3 times so far and wouldn't mind seeing it again.

1211826,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B001KVZ6HK,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","In the decade it's taken to bring everything together, we've continually been promised that the Avengers would be the superhero movie to change all superhero movies and it's a damn good thing, because I really hate superhero movies. Three things made this film standout and shine over the many, many superhero films that have been released. The most obvious thing is the huge, superstar, cast. Not only is it incredibly difficult to bring a cast like this together, but to get them to work together, without getting in each others way must have been nearly impossible. Second, even though the film involves superheroes and outer space, it seems somewhat realistic to us. These heroes have families, personalities, feelings, people get hurt, and some people even die, letting us see the human side of these characters. Finally, the Direction of Joss Whedon brings it all together. Whedon has always had this unique ability to put his own style on spin on things, at first it seems strange, but ultimately we come to love it. He is such an underrated Director, who brings so much to everything he's a part of, and it's great to see him get to do a huge project like this. The Avengers was special, not only because it took a decade to make, but because if you saw all the individual movies first, like I did, you feel a connection to these guys, it's almost like you know them personally and you expect them to act in certain ways when they all come together. The individual films really built up the excitement and helped the Avengers to become a billion dollar earner at the box office. From the performances to the special effects this was once exciting, terrific movie, and may be as close to perfect as a superhero movie will ever get.",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,1738,"['decade', 'taken', 'bring', 'everything', 'together', ""'ve"", 'continually', 'been', 'promised', 'Avengers', 'would', 'be', 'superhero', 'movie', 'change', 'superhero', 'movies', 'damn', 'good', 'thing', 'really', 'hate', 'superhero', 'movies', 'Three', 'things', 'made', 'film', 'standout', 'shine', 'many', 'many', 'superhero', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'most', 'obvious', 'thing', 'huge', 'superstar', 'cast', 'Not', 'only', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'bring', 'cast', 'together', 'get', 'work', 'together', 'getting', 'others', 'way', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'Second', 'even', 'film', 'superheroes', 'outer', 'space', 'somewhat', 'realistic', 'heroes', 'have', 'families', 'personalities', 'feelings', 'people', 'get', 'hurt', 'people', 'even', 'die', 'letting', 'see', 'human', 'side', 'characters', 'Finally', 'Direction', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'together', 'Whedon', 'always', 'had', 'unique', 'ability', 'put', 'own', 'style', 'spin', 'things', 'first', 'strange', 'ultimately', 'come', 'love', 'such', 'underrated', 'Director', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'everything', 'part', 'great', 'see', 'get', 'do', 'huge', 'project', 'Avengers', 'was', 'special', 'not', 'only', 'took', 'decade', 'make', 'saw', 'individual', 'movies', 'first', 'did', 'feel', 'connection', 'guys', 'almost', 'know', 'personally', 'expect', 'act', 'certain', 'ways', 'when', 'come', 'together', 'individual', 'films', 'really', 'built', 'up', 'excitement', 'helped', 'Avengers', 'become', 'billion', 'dollar', 'earner', 'box', 'office', 'performances', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'once', 'exciting', 'terrific', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'close', 'perfect', 'superhero', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'get']",Marvel's: The Avengers
1211827,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B001KVZ6HK,Tom Birkenstock,"[7, 12]","Well, it's finally here.  Many of us have been waiting for this moment for years, some for even decades.  But despite the bumps along the ways, and fears that we may never see its realization, us fans finally have what we have wanted for so long.  I'm talking, of course, about Joss Whedon's first time helming an existing property in a major motion picture.  As much as Whedon fans have enjoyed his original work over the years, many of us have wondered what he could do not only with preexisting characters but also with the backing of a major budget and the epic panoramic screen of the multiplex.  Oh, and of course the film itself happens to be The Avengers, the most anticipated movie of the last ten years or so.  And I'm happy to report that no one other than Whedon would have been able to pull off a film with this scope and this huge cast of characters.As you might guess, this review will be Whedon centric.  Plenty of people have dissected The Avengers from the point of view of comic book fans or critics of summer blockbusters.  But I would like to approach it from the perspective of one entry within Whedon's larger oeuvre.  I have a long history with Whedon's work, starting in high school when I first started watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer on a lark.  The concept of transforming a poorly received film into an ongoing series appeared to be such an idiotic idea that I decided to tune in order to witness some schadenfreude.  But eventually I found myself sucked into the story of a group of teenagers struggling simultaneously with adolescents and the supernatural, both elements of the show serving as metaphor for the other.  Not only did Buffy provide a surprisingly accurate view of growing up, but it also dipped into narrative experimentation.  Like many TV shows from the 90s, Buffy was acutely aware of genre conventions and subverted them whenever it could.  From then on I was a devoted fan of Whedon's work, from his spin off series Angel to the cult classic Firefly to his work in comic books.And of all the elements Whedon is most known for, the one that makes him most suited for an Avengers film is his ability to handle a large cast of characters without letting anyone slide into the background.  Whedon once said that he had to add more characters to Angel because he had such a difficult time writing for just the three principle actors.  It's also not uncommon for ancillary characters to become series regulars in his shows.  So if anyone is capable of balancing out four superheroes who had previously anchored their own films along with a good helping of backup characters, it is Joss Whedon.  The Avengers combines elements from many of the previous films.  The Iron Man movies initially introduced the idea of ""The Avengers Initiative,"" first in a post-credit scene from the first film and later in the sequel SHIELD and the Avengers served as an entire subplot that nearly derailed the movie.  The MacGuffin, here known as the tesseract, was first introduced in Captain America and has a connection to the Norse Gods that filled out the mythology of Thor.  And the main villain, Loki, is of course the adopted brother of Thor himself.  Of all the previous Marvel movies, The Incredible Hulk is the least essential.  But with a new casting (Mark Ruffalo replaces Edward Norton) audiences have an opportunity to become reacquainted with the green guy.The basic plot of the film is relatively straight forward with only a few curves thrown in for good measure.  Loki wants to steal the tesseract so that he can lead an invading alien force that will take over the Earth.  Without too much plot to get in the way, Whedon is capable of focusing his energy on the story's core pith: the friction between the heroes.  A lot of the film's drama comes from the fact that these characters don't belong together.  Their personalities and ideologies just don't fit.  In most comic books this means that the heroes have to fight before they team up, and in true comic book form when Thor tries to extract Loki from SHIELD custody and take him back to Asgardian jurisdiction Captain America and Iron Man team up to stop him.  Likewise, Captain America, who is a man out of time, continually brushes up against Tony Stark.  This makes sense, since Steve Rogers is a veteran of World War II when it was necessary for the individuals to sacrifice himself for the greater good, but, as Iron Man, Tony Stark doesn't do anything without first considering his own ego.  And in the midst of all this tension lies Bruce Banner who is liable to Hulk out at any provocation.Whedon is able to steer the film towards the interpersonal thanks to a few tricks he learned back in his Buffy days.  In the episode, ""The Yoko Factor,"" the gang captures the punk rock vampire Spike only for him to psychologically manipulate each of Buffy's friends in order to get them to turn on one another.  The point of the episode is that these tensions have existed for some time, and it only took a little spark for all of the resentment between friends to ignite into hatred.  Similarly, in The Avengers, Shield manages to capture Loki who then proceeds to sew seeds of distrust among the newly formed super group.  By making the tensions between the Avengers a weakness the villain can exploit, Whedon is able to clearly illustrate these characters for the audience while keeping the plot moving along.  The story doesn't need to stop in order for us to get to know these characters.If Whedon is known for one authorial tick, then it is probably his use of witticisms and word play.  The team dynamic allows him plenty of space to incorporate some of his well known dialogue.  The film trades in lots of quips between heroes and has a sprinkling of snark without going overboard.  Critics of Whedon's writing find his dialogue to be treacly rather than charming, and while I mostly disagree with these critics, it's certainly true that not all of Whedon's verbal jabs land properly.  This is especially true when Whedon isn't present to carefully direct his dialogue's delivery (see Halle Berry in The X-Men).  But like an athlete who does his best work in front of millions, here, when the world is watching, Whedon's humor absolutely shines.  And he has found a great ally in Robert Downey Jr. who is known to insist on making his own improvements on his scripts (the ""Shwarma"" joke was apparently all his idea).  In fact, Whedon is confident enough in his humor to momentarily take a break from the action to show us a Shield agent playing Galaga on a multimillion dollar computer when his boss isn't watching.  A joke that wouldn't work if he didn't trust that his audience shared his own bizarre sense of humor.In addition to his use of repartee, Whedon's also well known as a pop culture feminist, which in practice means he likes to watch an attractive lady beat up guys much bigger than herself.  Here Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) serves this particular purpose.  Several times throughout the film, Black Widow uses others' perception of her as an emotionally fragile creature in order to, jujitsu-like, convince her enemies to spill important information.  What might be first seen as a weakness becomes a weapon.  Whedon is clearly within the ideological confines of third-wave feminism, which seems to maintain that women can both serve as sexual objects while simultaneously kicking ass.  And there's some legitimate criticism to this approach to feminism, but Whedon generally gets away with it because he's able to write strong, interesting female characters.  We learn that Black Widow has a history with another SHIELD agent, Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner and, unfortunately, not given much of a role).  And when he is taken by Loki, Black Widow, in a role reversal, is allowed to become his savior.  Third wave feminism suits Johansson, an actress who most directors seem unable to do anything interesting with.  Arguably, this is her best role since Lost in Translation.But if there is a single major theme of The Avengers, then it is the question of the place of the individual within a larger community.  While making a pit stop in Germany, Loki takes the time to make a crowd of people bow before him while he pontificates on the useless notion of freedom.  And if the parallels between Loki's philosophy and fascism aren't clear enough, an older gentleman in the crowd decides to stand up and all but call Loki Hitler (obviously this fellow has never heard of Godwin's Law).  But the Avengers have their own problems formulating a cohesive group.  Each character is in some manner or other cut off from the larger society, whether it is Bruce Banner's rage or Tony Stark's ego.  These are individuals who are marked as outsiders, a favorite theme of Whedon's work.  But their very survival, and the survival of the world, is dependant on the ability of these individual parts to interlock.  Whedon represents the eventual coming together of these heroes in the final battle with a single shot that moves around the city in order to let the audience see how these characters work together as a cohesive unit.  For Whedon the answer to forced unity is not pure individuality, but rather a volatile mixture of the singular within the communal.But Whedon hasn't lost his healthy distrust of governing bodies.  Without giving too much away, in addition to dealing with an alien invasions, the film's heroes must also contend with the unclear motives of SHIELD, the quasi-military/quasi-intelligence agency that first assembled the Avengers.  Not only do members of the Avengers accuse SHIELD of attempting to create weapons of mass destruction, but the organization also purposefully attacks a civilian target for the ""greater good.""  In fact, Whedon's portrayal of SHIELD may have been too subversive for the U.S. military who cited its portrayals as a reason why they refused to cooperate with the movie by lending military equipment, an offer they regularly extend to films that represent the armed forces in a much more ""patriotic"" light.For the most part the movies produced by Marvel have been, by necessity, studio films in the classic Hollywood tradition.  Superhero movies have become so popular that most studios have banished any ultra stylistic auteurs who, early on in the superhero craze, put out some of the more distinctive films in the genre.  The likes of Ang Lee and Sam Raimi were deemed too idiosyncratic to helm multi-million dollar films.  That doesn't mean that there haven't been some interesting superhero films in the last few years, but it does mean that singular visions have been replaced by the work of handy craftsmen.  When you watch Tim Burton's Batman, you immediately recognize that this can be nothing but the work of Tim Burton The same could be said about Nolan's Batman series, thanks to the fact that they were first made when superhero auteurs were still in vogue.  (It's unlikely in today's environment that the studio would give Nolan as much free reign as he wielded).  Joss Whedon's The Avengers (a title that would make more sense than Marvel's The Avengers) attempts to derail this trend.  While Whedon is still constrained by the visual and narrative template established previously in earlier Marvel movies, he still manages to create a film that speaks with his own artistic voice.  This is especially impressive when you consider the fact that he was entrusted with an astronomical budget.  Maybe from within the deafening confines of the studio system, a singular voice can make itself heard after all.",4,A Review from a Whedon Fan,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,11598,"['Well', 'finally',

After the God Loki finds his way to Earth, steals the powerful Tesseract and is close to fulfilling his goal of destroying the planet there is only one group that can stop him. After years of recruiting Nick Fury's (Jackson) team is ready. This is a movie that people will pretty much just watch without any prompting or reading reviews because of the hype and build up but I'll do one anyway. I have to start by saying that I never was a huge comic book movie person. When they first started being made it was pretty much just how much stuff can we explode and how cool can we make it look. Over the years they have been getting better and better and I think the success of the ""Batman"" movies by Christopher Nolan has raised the bar. He has shown that a real story, plot and great acting can make a typical ""popcorn"" movie into a legitimate movie. All the years of honing the genre have led to this. Not only is this a fun movie to watch but it is also a great acted movie and everyone is perfectly cast. Downey is the leader but is in no way overpowering and this has the feel of a real ensemble cast movie in the way that ""Crash"" did. After years of movies like the ""Fantastic 4"" and ""Spiderman"" they finally realized the key to not just making a good comic book movie, but a great movie period. Good acting and writing are needed. Both are on display here. I have said for years that I am not a comic book movie fan...this movie may have changed my mind. Overall, not just a good and fun comic book movie but a good a fun movie...period. I give it an A-.",4,Superhero movies keep getting better & better. They realized good acting & writing are needed.

1211839,AMF52GSX309V0,B001KVZ6HK,Tony S.,"[0, 0]","It's been years in the making.  Something so big, so ambitious, fanboys across the world couldn't help but geek out at the mere thought of it.  Five individual films (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America), all with intersecting story lines, lead to this mega event.  Six superheros in one movie.  This is, The Avengers.  Let's go.What I liked about the film:Our HeroesOne of the problems with superhero films that flop is, there are too many characters, and not all of those characters get a their fair share of material.  That is not the case in The Avengers.  Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury, a mysterious man with his own agenda and ways of doing things.  Jackson gets to shine by keeping the audience guessing.Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark/Iron Man.  And of course, he is given the best dialogue in the film.  Downey exudes wit and charm in the character we have all come to know and love.  Chris Evans delicately plays Steve Rodgers/Captain America.  He is the &#34;fish out of water&#34;, who's returned to America after being frozen for 70 years.  Evans stays true to his character's beginnings in the military and plays the hero with a sense of honor and respect.  The rest of the team is made up of Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye.  There are also great supporting characters played by Clark Gregg and Stellan Skarsgard.  The cast is wonderful and demand our attention on the screen.You thought I left out one of the heroes didn't you?  No way.  It took a few tries, but the Hulk is finally &#34;done right&#34; in this movie!  Mark Ruffalo plays a wonderful Bruce Banner.  He must have been the most difficult character for the film makers, in more ways than one, but it superbly done.  Ensemble films like this usually wait until the third act to give every character something to do, that is not the case here.  Every character is an important piece of the puzzle.The ConflictOur heroes are by no means perfect.  By bringing all these characters together, there was bound to be conflict.  Everything from egos to ideals, the movie portrays conflict among the gang perfectly.  Check out the forest scene, where three of our heroes go at it, awesome!The Special EffectsBar none, the best special effects of any superhero film ever made.  Marvel spared no expense.  The movie is a spectacle to be enjoyed by all.  What I find amazing is the animators had to recreate characters that other companies have already used in previous films; all while making us believe the continuity.  The third act is non-stop, amazing action.  The best part is, it is all to serve the story; it never gets repetitive or boring.Joss WhedonThe script by Writer/Director Joss Whedon is phenomenal. His talent shines through every minute of the film.  He was literally the best man for the job.  Whedon has created, and directed, amazing sci fi movies and television shows.  He's written comic book stories as well.  His script gave every character a fair chance to shine.  His choice in almost every aspect of the movie is perfect.  The tone of the film is great, reminiscent of the Iron Man films.  The editing and pacing are spot on, never leaving a dull moment for the audience.  The character arcs are treated with care, to ensure we can relate to these super humans, and not just view them as Gods, with no humanity.  I can only hope he is hired back to direct the sequels.What I didn't like about the film:The VillainLet me be clear.  I loved Tom Hiddleston in this movie, but I didn't fear the threat of world domination by his character.  Loki is of course the God of mischief, but come one.  These are the Avengers.  Loki was already taken down by his brother Thor once before; now you're talking about six superheroes.The ScoreA memorable movie needs a memorable score.  I remember sitting in the theater waiting for the explosion of music to come, and it never did.  Alan Silvestri is a two-time Oscar nominee, but he missed the target on this one in my opinion.The Verdict:Simply AmazingThat's the word, amazing.  Marvel President Kevin Feige had a vision that began in 2007, during the filming of the first Iron Man.  What if there was a scene at the end of the film credits, teasing an Avengers film?  After all the characters in the team returned in-house from other studios, it would become a reality.  I mentioned it in the title, and it is no over exaggeration...  The Avengers is the most ambitious film of all time.  To bring six characters, from five previous films together; and do it with the care and style that Whedon has done, is unbelievable.The latest news this morning is that the film has the biggest box office opening of all time.  $200 millions dollars.  That tops 2011's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 at approx. $169 million dollars, and 2008's The Dark Knight with approx. $158 million dollars.  After watching the film, it does not surprise me at all.  The film will appeal to young and old, male and female.  And THAT, is the sign of a great movie.  Congratulations to all the players in this amazing journey.v",5,The Avengers review; the most ambitious film of all time,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,5144,"['been', 'years', 'making', 'Something',

The team-up consisting of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and the Incredible Hulk under the watchful eyes of S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury that squares off against the evil schemes of Thor's villainous brother Loki is the best team-up film of all time. This film follows up to the story that is told in all the individual films before starting with 2008's Iron Man has finally come to this, where we see a bunch of old faces and a few newcomers to the Avengers franchise. When I heard that Marvel was making The Avengers, I thought that Edward Norton would return as the Hulk, but that little thing left me to feel disappointed. On a lighter note, Mark Ruffalo stepped in as the Hulk and has done it so brilliantly, I want him to return to the role in The Avengers 2 and the next Hulk movie. And everyone is relatable in this film with a few key things about their individual lives (though Captain America was frozen in the 1940's after he became a superhero). And I was asking myself when this film was in development, 'Who is the villain going to be?' And my answer was Loki, who was played by Tom Hiddleston, who returned in a darker matter than in Thor.

That type of person describes me to a tee, but even if that wasn't the case, seeing the likes of Captain America(Chris Evans), Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) and Thor(Chris Hemsworth) all together in one film is enough to make anybody start quoting Joe Biden: ""This is a big effing deal!!!!"". The Avengers puts any fanboy fears to rest, and gets the geek juices goin' in a way no other superhero film has ever done. So why even bother trying to be subtle about this? The Avengers is flat out incredible! It is the jaw-dropping, powerhouse comic book movie we all hoped it would be and more!Marvel deserve a ton of credit for the amount of time and precise care they've put into building to this point, properly stoking the fires of the fanbase when necessary, but also playing coy as they dropped hints about where the film might go. They've been building to this moment since we were introduced to the billionaire genius, Tony Stark, back in 2008's Iron Man, where everybody surely remembers that heart stopping moment when cool as ice Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) turned up talking about the 'Avengers Initiative'. As perfect of a job as they did introducing us to the many heroes who make up The Avengers, the smartest move Marvel made, by a very large margin, was in hiring Joss Whedon as director and co-writer. It's largely in part due to him and his technical brilliance, goofy humor, and obvious love for these characters that makes The Avengers the peerless film it turned out to be. Anybody could have come on board and churned out a great looking film with awesome, wide-scale special effects, but few have that intimate knowledge of these characters and how they relate that Whedon clearly has. He was like a kid in a candy store, and all the lollipops were shaped like the superhero favorites from his childhood.A complaint that has been lodged against the film by some is the simplicity of the plot, but those people fail to understand just how necessary that is to accommodate for so many characters who many folks don't know all that well. Most people have no clue who Maria Hill(Cobie Smulders) is, or why she's important in the larger scheme of things. They don't know why Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has such a mad on for his brother, Thor. These things must be addressed in a way that everyone can understand, and to make room for the inevitable, and desperately wanted sequels. Can we get a fast track on those, please? The irony that such a simple but perfect plot could have been written by Zak Penn, the guy who gave us the convoluted mess that was X-men 3, isn't totally lost on me.The film starts out with an image of the Tesseract, and if you don't know what that is don't bother stressing out. It's also known as the Cosmic Cube, and was the MacGuffin of Captain America: The First Avenger, basically a mystical object with unlimited power. It's one of those items that is so insanely ludicrous in what it could do, that in movies like this it never actually does anything. People just fight over it. Nick Fury and the spy guys at S.H.I.E.L.D. have it, and Loki wants it back to become the all-powerful ruler he thinks himself to be. Setting his sights on their HQ, Loki cuts a destructive path through Fury's forces, stealing the Tesseract and possessing the minds of agent Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye(Clint Barton), and Dr. Erik Selvig(Stellen Skarsgard). With the country now at war from a super-powered threat, Fury is forced to try and pull together all the heroes he knows to combat the threat. Good luck with that. But wait...how can Loki possibly stand against the combined might of The Avengers all by himself? Easy. By employing the alien Chitauri to be his back-up. There's a perfectly calibrated, comical yet intense verbal throwdown between Loki and Tony Stark that sums up their characters on the nose. To sum it up: both are pompous asses.One of the trademarks of The Avengers is the combination of volatile personalities, and it quickly becomes apparent that they are their own worst enemy. A team made up of loners with their own personal agendas, conflict is unavoidable, and Whedon mines it for all that it's worth. Iron Man's flashy, indulgent personality rubs the modest, conservative Captain America the wrong way. Actually, Iron Man doesn't seem to get along with anybody, brawling with Thor and trying to provoke Bruce Banner into revealing his meaner, greener side. Whedon does a fantastic job of giving everyone their moment to shine, especially the characters who could have easily been lost in the shuffle: Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye.  In fact, Black Widow is the catalyst for much of what happens in the film's opening hour, tracking down Banner and revealing her deep, personal feelings towards Hawkeye. Having him taken over by Loki was a smart move, as it gives his character a reason to stand out from the pack....besides looking really cool with a bow and arrow.The biggest stand out amongst the cast is a new addition, and that's Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. Marvel has been trying to get the Hulk perfect for years, starting with Erica Bana in Ang Lee's underrated 2003 film, then with Edward Norton in 2008's The Incredible Hulk. Both were successful in their own way, but Ruffalo hits the nail right on the head in every respect. What Norton and Bana missed was that they tried to play Banner as too depressed, too passive. That has never been the character. He's a guy who understands his rages, and the nervous ticks he shows, such as his inability to ever be completely still, aren't so much for his own sake as they are out of concern for everybody else. Some of the film's best moments come as Banner and Stark, two technological and scientific marvels, banter back and forth in a language way too smart for anybody to totally understand. Plus, this version of the Hulk is just a heck of a lot more fun, as Whedon builds up the anticipation to his inevitable transformation in much the same way he toyed with us in The Cabin in the Woods. When the crap finally hits the fan and the Jade Giant emerges, he's the destructive force of nature Banner had done such a marvelous job warning everybody about.Whedon adds all the little touches that you know he's been dying to show on the silver screen for ages. One that fanboys will appreciate is the fate of the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, always the first casualty of any major event. And you know, as we see the entire team locked in an enclosed office, bickering like schoolchildren, that Whedon has been dreaming up exactly how that little family squabble would go for years. There are so many ingenious moments that to list them all would take longer than the film's 2 1/2 hour runtime. Nobody balances humor with genuine stakes better than Whedon does.As gifted as Whedon and Penn prove to be with the dialogue, the special effects also prove to be something extraordinary. Cities get destroyed, powers fly, and Hulks smash with reckless abandon. In IMAX 3D it's especially impressive. Whedon has been a director capable of making the most with sometimes limited resources, and given the ample backing of Marvel and Paramount, he's free to cut loose, and it's an opportunity he simply doesn't waste.Ok, so this is basically a gush fest, but that's exactly what The Avengers inspires. There will be other superhero movies coming out this year, and they all will scratch a very specific kind of itch. The Avengers is the summer movie to end all summer movies, and probably the only one we'll see this year that not only meets our lofty expectations, but far and away surpasses them!",4,Incredible!

In actuality, it has opened a portal allowing the malevolent being known as Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) to emerge. It's almost immediately clear that S.H.I.E.L.D. is outmatched and what's worse, the supervisor of the tesseract project Dr. Erik Selvig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and experienced covert agent nicknamed Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner) became mindless drones under Loki's (Hiddleston's) command.

The Avengers Initiative was abandoned some time before the events depicted in this film, but is reactivated for the sake of mankind and for lack of a better alternative. Romanoff (Johansson) is next seen in India resorting to subterfuge to gain audience with Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo). Banner (Ruffalo) has gone into hiding to escape opportunists in the American government, to remain calm, to spare the world and those around him any damage he might inflict as The Hulk. Next to be approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. is Iron Man, Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr. in the character's third major film). The last member left to recruit is Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans), more commonly known as Captain America. When they're finally brought together, Banner and Stark are tasked with tracing the energy source and, in so doing, locating the enemy. When that's accomplished, they meet yet another traveler from worlds beyond, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth), Loki's brother.Now, I was not really a fan of Captain America: The First Avenger, nor was I altogether pleased after seeing Thor. As for Bruce Banner's larger half, perhaps it's impossible to make a film about the incredible hulk that I wouldn't like. First there was the Ang Lee/ Eric Bana film, then the Edward Norton film, both of which I enjoyed. Still, I did like Ruffalo. Also, Thor, Captain America, and the Black Widow made individual contributions to enrich the story. Hiddleston may not be as physically imposing as Chris Hemsworth, but as an egomaniacal extraterrestrial, he is truly terrifying. I can't comment on whether the 3-D effects added anything, as I saw it in 2-D, but regardless, The Avengers was incredible. The one thing I might say was lacking was Iron Man's best friend James Rhodes wearing an armored flight suit of his own and going by the name War Machine. We caught a glimpse of that suit in action in Iron Man 2 but it was nowhere to be seen here and I thought the film was worse off for it. Still, very exciting, highly entertaining, and one great ride.

1211869,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001KVZ6HK,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Marvel Comics superheroes are in one movie. Not all the Marvel Comics characters are in ""The Avengers"" actually (Spider-Man seems busy doing ""The Amazing Spider-Man""), but the list is impressive enough to call it an all-star cast - Captain America, The Hulk, Iron Man and Thor (each of whom has his own live-action movie), as well as Black Widow (who was in ""Iron Man 2"") and Hawkeye (briefly seen in ""Thor""). Led by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D., an international peace keeping force, they form a team The Avengers to save humans from total destruction.The storyline of the 143 minute movie is simple, and it should be so. The film's opening is rather slow, taking time to explain the Tesseract (or the Cosmic Cube) and its unlimited power, and Thor's adoptive brother Loki, who steals it from S.H.I.E.L.D. Be patient and wait for the story to get interesting as principal characters enter one after another.But what makes ""The Avengers"" special is not the story itself or its state-of-the-art computer graphics; it is the characters and the amusing interactions between them that takes the film several notches up. The combat sequence in Manhattan is certainly thrilling (if a bit too long), but the greatest strength of ""The Avengers"" is that the film captures the personalities of superheroes. It is not just the way how Iron Man fights, but how cynical and narcissistic Tony Stark talks (and irritates Steve Rogers), that attracts us most. And the way Robert Downey Jr. delivers his lines is always fun to watch.If I may choose my favorite character, it is Bruce Banner played by Mark Ruffalo, but some viewers would find other characters more interesting.

1211873,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001KVZ6HK,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 8]","In 2008 the movie IRON MAN was released. The film was a major gamble. It was the first of a series of movies Marvel planned to release that would lead up to an eventual release of a multi-hero live-action adaptation of The Avengers.  Had it bombed, some of the planned films in the build-up might never have happened (not to mention the resurrected career of Robert Downey, Jr.) and THE AVENGERS would never have been made. Thankfully, the film was successful and four years later, THE AVENGERS movie is a reality.The Tesseract (Cosmic Cube) from CAPTAIN AMERICA and seen in THOR, is being studied by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a way to provide free and endless energy to the world. It is also believed that the device can be used as a portal to other worlds. The Tesseract starts reacting strangely and then, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) appears. He begins killing off agents one after the other with a powerful scepter. He also uses the scepter to turn people into his mental slaves. Loki is chased by Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) through S.H.I.E.L.D.'s underground complex, but is able to escape.Even though he's been ordered to disassemble the group, Fury begins gathering together the band of super heroes of the Avengers Initiative. Steve Rogers (Capt. America-played by Chris Evans), Tony Stark (Iron Man), Bruce Banner (Hulk-played by Mark Ruffalo and voiced by Lou Ferrigno), and Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow-played by Scarlett Johansson) are all on board and are joined by Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who has been sent from Asgard by Odin to collect his brother Loki. Well, things don't exactly go as planned (well, duh) and Loki escapes again and an invasion of Earth by an extraterrestrial army begins in the middle of New York.For a movie that has been planned for years and has a cast list that is truly star-studded, THE AVENGERS is an impressive bit of filmmaking. SUPERMAN ushered in the modern superhero movie and X-MEN illustrated that a super-team movie could actually be pulled off.  THE AVENGERS has now illustrated that you can actually make a series of very distinct, yet connected superhero films, then bring them all together in one massive movie and still make a highly-entertaining and enjoyable film that appeals to filmmakers across the board.There's something for everyone in the movie: a little romance for the ladies, plus several attractive men. There's all kinds of references to the comics for the comic book geeks. There's lots and lots and lots of action, but none of it is gory. There are several different layers of humor: physical comedy that appeals to kids and witty one-liners referencing classical works that will appeal to someone with a more intellectual humor.Captain America emerges as the leader of The Avengers, Iron Man/Tony Stark get most of the best lines, Thor hasn't given up on seeing Loki redeemed, and Hulk finally gets his cinematic due (someone finally got the Big Green Guy right) and emerges as the real hero of the film.The script does a wonderful job of explaining the techno-babble of what the audience needs to know without getting bogged down in unnecessary details. Also, since the previous movies in the Avengers line-up focused on introductions, the film doesn't have any exposition and gets right into the action.Speaking of action, there's a lot of it. There's the opening sequence that ends up destroying one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s land bases, there's some infighting with the heroes (what's mightier Thor's hammer or Captain America's shield?), and there's the climactic battle between The Avengers and the invading alien army from another universe.Visually, the film is gorgeous. It has a perfect blend between fantasy and the real-world.I only have two criticisms about the film. The first is that we really don't get an understanding of how Loki got to meet the aliens that supported and financed his attempted takeover of Earth. The second is kind of a minor spoiler.***Spoiler!***A major character apparently meets an untimely demise. ? I realize that for the plot of the film, a death seemed necessary. But, was it really? Wouldn't the escape of Loki and the destruction that ensued as well as the deaths of countless other agents been enough to unite the heroes together as a team? Or how about one of the lesser known Avengers (Hawkeye or Black Widow); their death could have been just as poignant.

Not just as a treat for fans, but as a pioneering film uniting various individual film stars in a union that has never been done in film. IT WORKED!'The Avengers' is such an incredible and fun film. Each character is given just enough time to shine and everything from the battle sequences to the jokes had perfection written all over it. Mark Ruffalo taking Edward Nortons' spot as Bruce Banner, was the biggest thing for me to see because it was a pretty big role to fill. It was as if Norton had never been there in the first place. Mark Ruffalo was one of the best additions to this film saga and don't get me started on how Hulk was in the movie. The part that I loved most about this film was the ending, because you are left knowing that this story is far from finished and it is going to be bigger and better.'The Avengers' is of course going to be compared to 'The Dark Knight Rises' as to which was the better film. There is no comparison they are two different movies, but as great as Dark Knight was, The Avengers was just so much more from a pure entertainment perspective.

They really did need two and a half hours.""It's rare when a movie is that long and you can't pick out a wasted minute, but this is one of those movies.Joss Whedon did an amazing job, not only of juggling the characters, and making sure everyone got their fair share of the action, but the stories within the story were great, so I didn't come away feeling ripped off by a CGI-Fest with no backbone.The relationship and conversations between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner were fantastic, and Mark Ruffalo did more than justice to the tortured scientist trying to hold in a destructive beast.The relationship developed between Captain America and Iron Man was fantastic too. I was glad they kept the tension, with the underlying, begrudging, respect, (a la Batman/Superman) in the formula.I'm glad they wrote the movie as a group of egos who don't get along at first. It made more sense.The humor of the movie was outstanding, making the ride that much more fun, especially Ruffalo's few one-liners delivered with an understated deadpan voice, implying how much he has to keep himself under control.Tom Hiddleston was fantastic, reprising his character Loki from Thor as the villain.And Samuel L. Jackson is . . .C'mon, he's SAMUEL L. JACKSON!The action sequences were as good comic book movie action sequences should be: Over-the-top, highly charged, and fused with adrenaline.Is it a kid's flick? That depends on you. There's a lot of violence, but it's comic book violence.If you're looking for a good Saturday night DVD to watch, this is it and then some.As for the 3D?It came through great on this one. I bought Captain America 3D and Thor 3D, and maybe it's just me, but it wasn't there.All-in-all, after seeing all of them, including The Dark Knight Rises, I have to say Marvel's Avengers is the best superhero movie out there to-date.",5,Two And A Half Hours Of Non-Stop Awesome.,1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,1946,"['saw', 'Avengers', 'movies', 'leery', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'walked', 'theater', 'saying', 'Wow', 'really', 'did', 'need', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'rare', 'when', 'movie', 'long', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pick', 'out', 'wasted', 'minute', 'one', 'movies.Joss', 'Whedon', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'not', 'only', 'juggling', 'characters', 'making', 'sure', 'everyone', 'got', 'fair', 'share', 'action', 'stories', 'story', 'were', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'ripped', 'off', 'CGI-Fest', 'backbone.The', 'relationship', 'conversations', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'were', 'fantastic', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'did', 'more', 'justice', 'tortured', 'scientist', 'trying', 'hold', 'destructive', 'beast.The', 'relationship', 'developed', 'Captain', 'America', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'fantastic', 'too', 'was', 'glad', 'kept', 'tension', 'underlying', 'begrudging', 'respect', 'la', 'Batman/Superman', 'formula.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'wrote', 'movie', 'group', 'egos', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'first', 'made', 'more', 'sense.The', 'humor', 'movie', 'was', 'outstanding', 'making', 'ride', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'especially', 'Ruffalo', 'few', 'one-liners', 'delivered', 'understated', 'deadpan', 'voice', 'implying', 'how', 'much', 'keep', 'control.Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'was', 'fantastic', 'reprising', 'character', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'villain.And', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', "".C'mon"", 'SAMUEL', 'L.', 'JACKSON', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences', 'should', 'be', 'Over-the-top', 'highly', 'charged', 'fused', 'adrenaline.Is', 'kid', 'flick', 'lot', 'violence', 'comic', 'book', 'violence.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'Saturday', 'night', 'DVD', 'watch', 'then', 'some.As', '3D', 'came', 'through', 'great', 'one', 'bought', 'Captain', 'America', '3D', 'Thor', '3D', 'maybe', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'there.All-in-all', 'seeing', 'including', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'have', 'say', 'Marvel', 'Avengers', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'there', 'to-date']",Marvel's: The Avengers

1211910,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B001KVZ6HK,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 7]","""The Avengers"" delivers on the promise of the other Marvel films with a rip-roaring adventure filled with snappy dialogue, good performances, great action sequences and terrific visual effects that supports a well written, directed story from Joss Whedon.Should you see it in 3D? The film was shot with 3D in mind so a number of scenes benefit from it but, quite honestly, it would work just as well as a regular theatrical presentation. Since I don't have the Blu-ray 3D I can't review that aspect but I can review the two disc Blu-ray/DVD combo.Image & Sound: A top notch Blu-ray transfer with deep, rich blacks, nice detail, depth and bold colors, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" looks and sound brilliant. The Lossless soundtrack is audio demo quality with excellent use of the surround speakers, detail and, again, imaging/depth. Dialogue is always to the forefront where it's needed to be.Subtitles are provided in English as well as providing descriptive services for the blind.The special features are good but a bit disappointing in that there aren't more of them covering the details I was interested in. I would have loved to see a special feature on the comic book, it's evolution and a discussion with Joss Whedon as to why he chose this line up (which isn't quite the original as in the original 1960's comic book). It also would have been nice to provide some of the vintage comic books in a digital format as an example of the story elements that Whedon borrowed for the film (including the reboot of Nick Fury since originally he looked nothing like Samuel L. Jackson and was revised to look like the actor--a bit of irony considering that he wasn't offered the role until a decade later).We do get two fine featurettes that provide us with behind-the-scenes footage, talking heads discussing what attracted them to the film/roles. Whedon is as always effusive and entertaining particularly during the commentary track where he discusses the decision to shoot the film without a 3D rig and do a post conversion (he shares his experience with shooting the tag at the end of ""Thor"" in 3D which was added to that film to set up this film). He also discusses his approach to the characters and the mission that Marvel gave him in making the film.Deleted/extended scenes are an interesting addition. We get an alternate opening and closing for the film both of which involve Cobie Smulders' character giving her a larger role in the film. This footage was wisely excised in my opinion. We also get footage of Captain America brooding over Peggy and although interesting it would have been far more interesting to see him actually go and try and meet her (although they would have to figure out a way to tie it into the larger narrative). (SPOILER) There are also extended scenes including a scene between Loki and Hawkeye where the latter gives Loki the information that sends him on his mission to disrupt The Avengers. That little scene explains how he knew what he was doing would break the team apart but it also would have spoiled us discovering what his true purpose was in allowing himself to be captured. (END OF SPOILER).Finally we get a gag reel and trailers for other films. I'm sure there are probably Easter eggs but I haven't discovered them yet on the Blu-ray.The DVD comes with one featurette and the commentary track.Oh, and make sure to stick around post-credits for an amusing scene involving the heroes doing something Tony Stark suggests earlier at the conclusion of the film. Notice that Captain America's face is blocked by his hand. That's because the scene was shot after completion of shooting and Chris Evans was growing a beard for his next role.SPOILERS:When an intergalactic threat spearheaded by Loki (Tom Hiddleston)to obtain the mysterious and powerful Cosmic Cube (a major plot point in ""Captain America"" and seen, briefly, in ""Thor"") arises, Agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)is forced to call together a dysfunction team of superheroes--Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and, later, Thor (Chris Hemsworth)to battle Loki and get the Cosmic Cube back before Loki can obtain his objective--to open a portal for an invading alien army.Eventually the team gets past their dislike of each other/rivalry to work as a team.  They may not like each other but they each have a role to play and embrace it. Stick around past the initial credits for a surprise cameo from a well known Marvel villian named Thanos (if you don't know who he is--look him up. He appears in a number of Marvel comics at various times and his character IS tied to the Cosmic Cube so Whedon does a good job of combining elements of the first issue of ""The Avengers"" with later comics).END OF SPOILERS:Joss Whedon has done a terrific job of assembling the Avengers (pun intended) for their first big screen adventure. The film is filled with strong action sequences that are both well designed and executed. The continuity between ""The Avengers"" and the previous Marvel films (""Captain America"", ""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Iron Man 2"" and ""Thor"")is well established and continued here (it helps that Whedon did an uncredited rewrite on ""Captain America"" and even worked on Ang Lee's much disliked ""Hulk"" plus Whedon is a passionate fan of the Marvel comic books).Are there flaws? Well, sure just about every movie has one flaw or another. There are some plot coincidences, holes that will bother those who are picky about that stuff but what matters here (at least to me...your mileage may vary)is the flow and how well put together the story is. You can pick apart just about ANY movie.Recommended.",5,"Blu-ray review update-Captain America: ""We need a plan of attack"" Iron Man:  ""I have a plan.

Some thoughts rustling around in my otherwise pop culture addicted brain to spew out.  Sure, I liked the movie.  Who doesn't and who wouldn't?  I guess only the most jaded cynical fool that silently weeps that Hollywood still hasn't made a faithful adaptation of Dragon Riders of Pern and keeps turning out this dreck.  Sure, I want to see a Pern Franchise on the big screen but til then I'll settle for this dreck.Seriously, it wasn't that good of a movie.  Most of it involved a lot of angst by the heroes up on that flying battleship while Loki was pacing malevolently in the glass prison.  And as much as the world loves Loki he still isn't Benedict Cumberbunch by a long shot.And then the movie was 40min of some big destruction on New York City.  The Avengers fight each other until the fight together.  Big yip.  It's what was expected out of this first movie and it's what we got.  Pretty much we loved Avengers for it cause Marvel Studios got the ball rolling while DC/Warner brothers were stuck in neutral spinning their tires on an icy road.  Let's not be fools here.  Nothing in the screenplay came off the pen of any modern Shakespeare.  If Justice League came out in 2012 with Avengers a hint of a promise 3 years from now it'd be 95% identical to the plot of this one.  Different characters, same cliches.Still though it was done magnificently.  And Josh Wheedon really nailed it.  Big Papi smashing all them HRs in the 2013 World Series was no shock.  He's Big Papi.  But if the guy in the 7th slot platooning with a right hander did the same thing it'd shock the world.  Well, that's what Josh did here.  He's good enough to be at the bottom of the order in a Major League line up but til Avengers nobody thought he belonged clean up.  He's this decades Peter Jackson.  And at least he was smart enough to put his vanity movie in small theaters unlike Pete who put that Lovely bones out there for all the world to see.  These guys are great at what they do-as long as they stick to the narrow confines of what they are good at.And kudos that the tone didn't get all grim, grimy, dirty and dark on this movie.  Each comic book series needs to be true to itself.  The Avengers is big big BIGGER than life.  They can stow the angst for the individual stories.  But the movie has super duper bright and shiny colors.  But the whole aliens being organic based is over played.  Big whoop that the alien space ships are crazy alien whales swimming with buggy like aliens riding them down Central Ave.  And big whoop that Ultron the robot is coming next.  I want the Inhumans.  Cause they may not be humans but they isn't aliens, zombies, vampires, clones or robots either.  Originality is the hallmark of Marvel (except for Thor but still and all&#8230;)As for the next Avengers I really wanted Ant Man Hank Pym in it as much as the next true fan.  And his wife too.  What a hottie with brains to match!  But if they are putting that dweeby British guy to play him than maybe it's best they keep him out of Avengers II.  Haven't we suffered enough retaliation for when Kevin Costner played Robin Hood those many years ago.  Too many great roles keep going to the british.",4,The Last Word on The Avengers before the next guy puts in another meaningless review that will go unread.,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,3232,"['What', 'there', 'left', 'be', 'said', 'got', 'few', 'ideas', 'thoughts', 'rustling', 'around', 'otherwise', 'pop', 'culture', 'addicted', 'brain', 'spew', 'out', 'Sure', 'liked', 'movie', 'Who', ""n't"", 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'guess', 'only', 'most', 'jaded', 'cynical', 'fool', 'silently', 'Hollywood', 'still', ""n't"", 'made', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Dragon', 'Riders', 'Pern', 'keeps', 'turning', 'out', 'dreck', 'Sure', 'want', 'see', 'Pern', 'Franchise', 'big', 'screen', 'til', 'then', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'dreck.Seriously', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'movie', 'Most', 'involved', 'lot', 'angst', 'heroes', 'up', 'flying', 'battleship', 'Loki', 'was', 'pacing', 'malevolently', 'glass', 'prison', 'as', 'much', 'world', 'Loki', 'still', ""n't"", 'Benedict', 'Cumberbunch', 'long', 'shot.And', 'then', 'movie', 'was', '40min', 'big', 'destruction', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Avengers', 'fight', 'other', 'fight', 'together', 'Big', 'yip', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'first', 'movie', 'what', 'got', 'Pretty', 'much', 'loved', 'Avengers', 'cause', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'got', 'ball', 'rolling', 'DC/Warner', 'brothers', 'were', 'stuck', 'neutral', 'spinning', 'tires', 'icy', 'road', 'Let', 'not', 'be', 'fools', 'here', 'Nothing', 'screenplay', 'came', 'pen', 'modern', 'Shakespeare', 'Justice', 'League', 'came', 'out', '2012', 'Avengers', 'hint', 'promise', '3', 'years', 'now', ""'d"", 'be', '95', '%', 'identical', 'plot', 'one', 'Different', 'characters', 'same', 'cliches.Still', 'was', 'done', 'magnificently', 'Josh', 'Wheedon', 'really', 'nailed', 'Big', 'Papi', 'smashing', 'HRs', '2013', 'World', 'Series', 'was', 'shock', 'Big', 'Papi', 'guy', '7th', 'slot', 'platooning', 'right', 'hander', 'did', 'same', 'thing', ""'d"", 'shock', 'world', 'Well', 'what', 'Josh', 'did', 'here', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'bottom', 'order', 'Major', 'League', 'line', 'up', 'til', 'Avengers', 'nobody', 'thought', 'belonged', 'clean', 'up', 'decades', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'least', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'put', 'vanity', 'movie', 'small', 'theaters', 'Pete', 'who', 'put', 'Lovely', 'out', 'there', 'world', 'see', 'guys', 'are', 'great', 'what', 'do-as', 'long', 'stick', 'narrow', 'confines', 'what', 'are', 'good', 'at.And', 'kudos', 'tone', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'grim', 'grimy', 'dirty', 'dark', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'be', 'true', 'Avengers', 'big', 'big', 'BIGGER', 'life', 'can', 'stow', 'angst', 'individual', 'stories', 'movie', 'super', 'duper', 'bright', 'shiny', 'colors', 'whole', 'aliens', 'being', 'organic', 'based', 'played', 'Big', 'whoop', 'alien', 'space', 'ships', 'are', 'crazy', 'alien', 'whales', 'swimming', 'buggy', 'aliens', 'riding', 'down', 'Central', 'Ave.', 'big', 'whoop', 'robot', 'coming', 'next', 'want', 'Inhumans', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'humans', ""n't"", 'aliens', 'zombies', 'vampires', 'clones', 'robots', 'Originality', 'hallmark', 'Marvel', 'Thor', 'still', '8230', 'next', 'Avengers', 'really', 'wanted', 'Ant', 'Man', 'Hank', 'Pym', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'true', 'fan', 'wife', 'too', 'What', 'hottie', 'brains', 'match', 'are', 'putting', 'dweeby', 'British', 'guy', 'play', 'maybe', 'best', 'keep', 'Avengers', 'II', 'Have', ""n't"", 'suffered', 'enough', 'retaliation', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'played', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Too', 'many', 'great', 'roles', 'keep', 'going', 'british']",Marvel's: The Avengers

1211935,A3BOH0F7V12H7O,B001KVZ6HK,William Kendall,"[6, 9]","For the last few years, there have been a number of Marvel comics characters adapted to the big screen. Some of them have had their film rights taken up by other studios, so despite the fondest wishes of some comics fanboys, there will never be massive crossovers. Since 2008, however, there has been a concerted effort to create a shared cinematic universe among several characters. Two Iron Man films, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger have shared common links, characters, and references, which have all led to this summer's blockbuster event The Avengers. It's been awhile, but Marvel Studios chose the right directors for the earlier projects, and carefully brought all of these together under just the right director to bring the team to life for the first time on the big screen. And it's paid off beautifully.The film starts with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of SHIELD, an intelligence and special ops agency with a near unlimited budget, coming to a secure facility where trouble is brewing. Fury and his right hand agents, Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg, returning again to the films) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders, making her debut in the franchise) learn that the Tesseract, a cubed energy source last seen in The First Avenger, is behaving erratically. The scientist in charge, Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard, reprising his role from Thor) barely has time to brief Fury when the Tesseract opens a wormhole, and out comes the treacherous Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who was last seen falling into the void in Thor).Loki uses mind control on Selvig and SHIELD agent Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner, who did a cameo as the character in last year's Thor), escaping from the facility with the Tesseract. Fury, whose plans to start a team of superhumans have stalled, must assemble the group. Captain America (Chris Evans) is only just starting to get used to life in the current day after being in stasis for decades. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is opening up a new Stark Tower in New York City and spending time with his assistant turned partner turned girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow, making a cameo this time out). The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is called in from an interrogation overseas to bring in another potential team member. She tracks down Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, taking over the role from Edward Norton and thus becoming the third Banner in three films- the Ang Lee film doesn't count as canon in this franchise by the way- and the most suitable for the role) in India. Banner, aside from being a genius who's the definitive expert in gamma radiation, also happens to turn into a rampaging green sledgehammer of sheer power called the Hulk when he gets mad.Loki's brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives from Asgard, clashing briefly with Iron Man and Captain America before joining in with the group. He also brings the news that Loki seeks to bring an alien army to Earth for a full invasion, to subjugate humanity once and for all. As Loki works to make that happen, the team must bridge the differences between them, get past their dysfunction, and work together to save the world.The movie succeeds on the basis of several elements. First, the dynamics between the characters is just right, fitting both the comic and cinematic versions of each team member. Their personalities and histories are conveyed well through the screenplay and the performances, both in the way they butt heads and work together. I liked the way Tony and Bruce- two intellectual geniuses- sparred with each other in the lab and bickered, for example, and Steve Rogers, as a man completely out of his own time, feels once again true to form. Each of these characters are strong, alpha personalities who have to find a way to work cohesively. At first, they're at odds (in fact, through the film, pretty much every member of the team gets into a fight with at least someone else on the team). After a pivotal moment, they become united in a common cause.The casting is essential as well. With the exception of Ruffalo, all of the leads have appeared in the earlier films, and have fit their characters very well. Evans, the soldier out of time, becomes the natural leader again, decisive and courageous despite the odds. Downey, playing Stark for the third time now, once again gets some of the great lines (not all of them!) with his funny, acerbic take on the character, pretty much irritating everyone else in the cast to some degree. Johansson, as the Widow, gives us a character whose backstory is fleshed out, who can use truth and subterfuge in the very same moment, and who-despite being a mere human- is credible as the most dangerous woman alive. Renner spends the first part of the movie as a bit of a ghost until he gets freed from Loki's control, but afterwards becomes the solid marksman, absolutely cool under pressure, with history with the Widow. I liked their interaction.Hemsworth's return as Thor is more than welcome; he was perfectly cast as the character in last year's film, and he seems as if he never stepped out of the role. I liked that there are moments in the film where he's the voice of reason, both with the Hulk and with his brother Loki. Hiddleston, as Loki, once again is a compelling villain, and making him the reason the Avengers come together is a good nod to the comics history as well. A broken and utterly desolate soul since his exile, it's not that much of a leap for such a man to end up becoming capable of terrible acts. Hiddleston conveys that quality very well indeed.Ruffalo, as the newcomer to the franchise, fits the role of Banner perfectly. The character has been played before by Eric Bana (too whiny in the Ang Lee film, but the blame for that debacle can be laid at the director's feet) and Edward Norton, who just seemed off in the role. Ruffalo gives us a brilliant, troubled man who's all too aware of the danger his other side presents- his revelation that he's tried to commit suicide is perfectly suited to who he is- and yet he's a very sympathetic character, both as himself and as the big green walking temper tantrum.The production values of the film help things along. Alan Silvestri, who scored The First Avenger, returns to compose the music for this film, and he gives us powerful, commanding music that perfectly suits the themes of the film. The CGI, makeup, set design, and costuming involved is very well done, and it really shows. The Avengers quinjet and the SHIELD helicarrier are rendered well, just as I'd imagine them to be. The invading army (largely cannon fodder, and never before used in the comics version) mostly use gliders as their invasion kicks off the final act of the film, and look decidedly ugly. Their flight scenes have a frantic, chaotic feel that looks real, and their leviathans- giant armoured flying creatures- look gigantic and terrifying, and very much in the scene, as opposed to completely fake. The battle between the Avengers and these invaders feels very much immediate and real, and that's a credit to the live action and how seamlessly it blends with the CGI elements.The CGI is probably best expressed in the look of the Hulk. In the Ang Lee film, the CGI for the character was inconsistent at best, and the Hulk often seemed over or undersized, not in the picture with other characters, and just generally muddled. That improved greatly in The Incredible Hulk, and is certainly well done here. The Hulk has consistency whenever he appears on the screen, and feels very much like he's sharing space with the rest of the cast. Much attention to detail has been paid to getting him right, and it paid off.It's director Joss Whedon who brings it all together, and he was the ideal choice for helming the project. Whedon knows the source material very well indeed, and his background suits the demands of the film. This is the creative force behind Firefly, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Angel, after all (one of his cast members from the latter two series in fact has a cameo in the film, though Alexis Denisof is completely unrecognizable from his days as an erstwhile British Watcher). Whedon gets group dynamics, how to mold together the complex relationships and personalities into a unified whole. He also has a good sense of humor, and that plays itself out well throughout the film. He gets the best out of his cast and crew, and in the end, the film is a grand slam out of the ballpark. As the proverbial coach of the team, Whedon can take a well deserved bow.In closing, the film succeeds wildly in bringing these characters together. The Marvel universe has always had much more interesting characters then their DC counterparts, after all (sorry, Superman, but you'll always be a boring Boy Scout). The film tells a story of coming together in a common cause, to fight back against impossible odds, to stand as one. There are some extraordinary jaw dropping moments throughout the film, but I think the best moments of the film are the ways that the characters interact with each other. Sometimes that's through dialogue. Other times it's just a look. Or the way a god of mischief winds up getting six heroes really, really mad at him.",5,Assembling A Blockbuster,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,9211,"['last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'number',

I absolutely loved the Avengers and thought it to be one of the most fun, entertaining superhero movies out of all superhero movies.Where as Dark Knight gave you dark, gritty, realistic Batman.Avengers gives you light, extraordinary superheroes.Now, plot... eh, the plot is a little weak and the introduction will turn off any casual viewer. I don't think it was the smartest idea to start with comic book talk of the Tesseract. As a fan of comics myself, I could see this scene setting a bad tone for anyone who doesn't read comics. Also, it's a little bit campy and feels out of place in the movie. Quite honestly, they could have started the film right at the base and gotten rid of these scene altogether.Also, there are some things that still don't work for me. Though I tried to pay attention, I still don't see why Loki and Hawkeye were in Germany. Loki's plan seemed unnecessarily convoluted to work properly. Now, yes, I know, arch villains are supposed to have supremely convoluted plans. The problem is that when you see it in movie form, it starts to feel like the only reason A happened was so that B could happen. It starts to feel very contrived and forced just so that we could introduce Thor or have an excuse for Hulk to rampage in the Helicarrier.HOWEVER!

Loki (Tom Hiddleston), introduced in 2011's ""Thor,"" comes to earth intent on an otherworldly invasion and total conquest. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of the Federal agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gathers together ""earth's mightiest heroes"" to prevent the invasion - Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Black Widow, Hawkeye and, believe it or not, the Hulk.While this is a solid superhero flick, my expectations were a little too high due to the film's hype and record-breaking success. The movie starts good but the set-up goes on & on and isn't overly absorbing, plus way too much time is spent on the SHIELD heli-carrier, which creates a somewhat one-dimensional vibe; lastly, although Loki is an excellent villain, the otherworldly army known as the Chitauri are stereotypically ee-vil, faceless villains who are way too-easily slaughtered, excepting the colossal snake-creatures.Despite those few negatives, there are numerous highlights: Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow; straight-laced Captain America at odds with the overly-hip Tony Stark/Iron Man (Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. respectively); Chris Hemsworth as the noble Thor; Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury; a touching subplot concerning the Black Widow & Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner); and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.Speaking of Bruce Banner, the Hulk easily steals the show here. The best scenes and literal punch lines have to do with the Hulk. As much as I like both the '03 and '08 film versions of the green goliath, this is the definitive rendition.FINAL WORD: ""The Avengers"" is definitely an entertaining superhero team flick, but it has its shortcomings.

Every major character gets their chance to flex their range. The effects are dynamite, so was the 3D even though they didn't use it to full effect (objects aimed at the camera need to move a fraction slower for full eye candy effect).Despite what you've heard there IS a story to compliment the endless action. I'm a little sad the invading aliens are sort of generic and the ""cosmic cube"" had to be re-named (the Tesser-whatsit? doesn't sound very Norse...) but the scope was well put together and I'm pleased they didn't try to explain EVERYTHING, like how the ""council"" works. The shwarma scene at the end was priceless! My fave moments in comics are when the superheroes are doing ordinary things: Spidey sharing a coffee break with the Thing prior to invading Thanos' ship, the X-Men playing baseball circa #110 or so.. come to think of it, these moments are few and far between!Kudos to Whedon for doing it right, he puts Lindelhof to shame. I've been a fan of Cap since I was three in 1971. I've waited along time to see this come to the big screen and I'm thrilled to say it has met and exceeded my expectations. Even the absence of Wasp and Ant-Man couldn't dampen my enthusiasm, but I hope a future film will include Vision and Scarlet Witch.

The Hulk is magnificent.  The actors are all at the peak of their talents.  The effects are excellent, but the enemy soldiers are all CG and look a bit too fake.  Also, Hawkeye is not utilized.

The heroes are shining reflections of their comic book selves.  Well done.The enemies are a bit lame, unremarkable, and forgettable.  Loki is barely a villain.  A smarter plot would have pit the Avengers against a group of super villains.  Or at least professional fighters dressed as aliens, so the choreography does not look so fake at times.  It really draws you out of the suspension of disbelief when the aliens look like Sunday morning cartoon characters.
