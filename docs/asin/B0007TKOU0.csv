890643,A3J02CKWW3EHR4,B0007TKOU0,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]",I bought this product for my dad for christmas. He enjoys blues music and is beginning to play the guitar. The description CLEARLY states that it comes with a 29 page booklet. All I got was the DVD. I want to send it back but I do not have the time since christmas is right around the corner and this is one of two gifts I have for him. I have not played the DVD so who knows it if even works....What a piss poor company to advertise something and not include it. They must not want any customers ever again. DO NOT BUY!!!,2,Don't waste your money,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,522,"['bought', 'product', 'dad', 'christmas', 'blues', 'music', 'beginning', 'play', 'guitar', 'description', 'CLEARLY', '29', 'page', 'booklet', 'got', 'was', 'DVD', 'want', 'send', 'back', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'christmas', 'right', 'corner', 'one', 'two', 'gifts', 'have', 'have', 'not', 'played', 'DVD', 'who', 'even', '.What', 'piss', 'poor', 'company', 'advertise', 'something', 'not', 'include', 'must', 'not', 'want', 'customers', 'ever', 'again', 'DO', 'NOT', 'BUY']","House of Blues Beginner, Acoustic Guitar"
890644,ALXJMC8VGB2WR,B0007TKOU0,"Classic gamer! ""Retro gamer mostly""","[56, 56]","The greatest thing about this dvd is that the teacher, teaches you how to play modern styles.  I haven't checked out many beginner acoustic dvds, but i have looked threw many beginner guitar books.  I think these modern ideas are much better than playing ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" and ""Old Mc Donald"".  With added booklet and online refrences you can advance more.  Although you may want to get a few others books a dvd is important too I think.

890645,A2PFMCIVR6Q5ZG,B0007TKOU0,"DAVID Bruce ""severian66""","[19, 20]","I bought the ""Learn to Play Acoustic Beginner"" by House of Blues along with the Guitar World Acoustic Rock DVD; do yourself and your wallet a favor and just get the former. In fact, it may be the best one I have. There is a small book showing you the tabs, strumming patterns, and how to follow along. It also includes links to download a tuner, metronome, and background tracks to practice along to. If you have an acoustic and are teaching yourself, this is the one to get for chords.The instructor is easy to follow, unlike others where you end up trying to play catch-up.  A note for beginners, when you are shown the chords, sit down and practice for 10-15 minutes before trying to play along.  That's the way this is intended to work.  And if you have a steel string acoustic guitar, you will need to practice a couple of weeks (two to four) before your fingers can handle the pain of learning acoustic.",5,Best of Acoustic Chord Instrucational DVDs,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,909,"['bought', 'Learn', 'Play', 'Acoustic', 'Beginner', 'House', 'Blues', 'Guitar', 'World', 'Acoustic', 'Rock', 'DVD', 'do', 'wallet', 'favor', 'just', 'get', 'former', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'have', 'small', 'book', 'showing', 'tabs', 'strumming', 'patterns', 'how', 'follow', 'along', 'also', 'links', 'download', 'tuner', 'metronome', 'background', 'tracks', 'practice', 'along', 'have', 'acoustic', 'are', 'teaching', 'one', 'get', 'chords.The', 'instructor', 'easy', 'follow', 'others', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'trying', 'play', 'catch-up', 'note', 'beginners', 'when', 'are', 'shown', 'chords', 'sit', 'down', 'practice', '10-15', 'minutes', 'trying', 'play', 'along', 'way', 'intended', 'work', 'have', 'steel', 'string', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'will', 'need', 'practice', 'couple', 'weeks', 'two', 'four', 'fingers', 'can', 'handle', 'pain', 'learning', 'acoustic']","House of Blues Beginner, Acoustic Guitar"
