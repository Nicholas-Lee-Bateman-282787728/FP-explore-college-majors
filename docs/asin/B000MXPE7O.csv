1051901,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B000MXPE7O,,"[3, 3]","De Niro makes a surprising move here into spy territory - not modern Bourne type stuff (despite the presence of Matt Damon) but more like an American John Le Carre type story, in its understated events and emphasis on character.  It's a noble endeavor, at times wonderfully shot - however, it is ultimately too flawed to succeed as entertainment.The story revolves around the creation of the CIA, seen through the eyes of Edward Wilson (a composite of several real life characters).  It plays as a character driven story showing what can make a man choose a life of permanent paranoia and secrecy, and the impact that has on his life.  In this way the atmosphere around the time of the new Agency's genesis is portrayed rather than a strict blow by blow account of how it came to be.  A superb and committed cast have been gathered, (including a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Joe Pesci), and there is a clear feeling of the proceedings oozing talent, from art direction and photography, through to actors and music.However, there is something about the pacing that is not quite right - at 160 minutes, we should have some significant moments of drama to drive our interest on, but somehow we are left with a spy story of non-people and non-events... a spy movie without suspense.  There's an interesting enough story arc for our main character, and the audience is asked to be intelligent enough to fill in some gaps - but the padding has turned what could have been an atmospheric and informative movie into something bloated and dull.  This is no epic or definitive account.Regular readers of mine will know I am no huge fan of rapid fire MTV style editing a la `Armageddon' and its ilk - but a movie still has to have some drive and entertainment value.  That's missing here, despite the core having some very interesting things to say about the disease of loneliness and what it does to a man.  Sad to say, no endorsement from me on this one, even though it has moments that really make me want to like it.",2,I spy with my little eye - something beginning with `d' - for dull.,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,2016,"['De', 'Niro', 'surprising', 'move', 'here', 'spy', 'territory', 'not', 'modern', 'Bourne', 'type', 'stuff', 'presence', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'more', 'American', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'type', 'story', 'understated', 'events', 'emphasis', 'character', 'noble', 'endeavor', 'times', 'wonderfully', 'shot', 'however', 'ultimately', 'too', 'flawed', 'succeed', 'entertainment.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'creation', 'CIA', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'composite', 'several', 'real', 'life', 'characters', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'showing', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'man', 'choose', 'life', 'permanent', 'paranoia', 'secrecy', 'impact', 'life', 'way', 'atmosphere', 'time', 'new', 'Agency', 'genesis', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'strict', 'blow', 'blow', 'account', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'superb', 'committed', 'cast', 'have', 'been', 'gathered', 'including', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'clear', 'feeling', 'proceedings', 'oozing', 'talent', 'art', 'direction', 'photography', 'actors', 'music.However', 'something', 'pacing', 'not', 'quite', 'right', '160', 'minutes', 'should', 'have', 'significant', 'moments', 'drama', 'drive', 'interest', 'somehow', 'are', 'left', 'spy', 'story', 'non-people', 'non-events', 'spy', 'movie', 'suspense', 'interesting', 'enough', 'story', 'arc', 'main', 'character', 'audience', 'asked', 'be', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'fill', 'gaps', 'padding', 'turned', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'atmospheric', 'informative', 'movie', 'something', 'bloated', 'dull', 'epic', 'definitive', 'account.Regular', 'readers', 'mine', 'will', 'know', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'rapid', 'fire', 'MTV', 'style', 'editing', 'la', 'Armageddon', 'ilk', 'movie', 'still', 'have', 'drive', 'entertainment', 'value', 'missing', 'here', 'core', 'having', 'very', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'disease', 'loneliness', 'what', 'man', 'Sad', 'say', 'endorsement', 'one', 'even', 'moments', 'really', 'make', 'want', 'like']",N/A

It's entirely possible to do a movie about an unlikable and even bland character that makes him interesting and sympathetic. In this character study the creation of an even mildly compelling character whose life we take any real interest in was simply not accomplished. This isn't to say Matt Damon did not act well because he seems to have turned in a decent, understated performace that was befitting of the role. The fact that this is a story about a strange man whose life is his work that is also the story of the birth of the CIA lumps it together with a whole slew of movies that affect for the worse my reaction to this espionage, cold war spy drama.

Eisenhower set a plan in motion to take Cuba back from Castro, but JFK balked at the last moment, failing to send enough troops or air support,  even though his military advisors implored him to do so. He lacked the will because he was afraid if we invaded Cuba more 'robustly' Khrushchev would respond by making a move for the western half of Berlin, and from there we'd be obligated to respond; Perhaps with an ICBM.  In truth Khrushchev was baffled that JFK failed to take back Cuba which he referred to as ""the little sausage shaped island.""  Because of JFKs indecisiveness with the Bay of Pigs Khrushchev found the huberis, 6 months later, to put Nukes on the island, which caused the missle crisis...But the crisis was overstated as the Soviets only had 11 ICBMs to our 300 plus, so they weren't about to do an 'exchange'.

""I want to direct.""  When the actor is Robert Di Niro, (certain to be surrounded by adoring Yes-Men), the results can be as frightening as an exploding cigar or poisoned martini.The Good Shepherd is a true ""cameo-fest,"" no lesser a light than Joe Pesci gets about 5 lines (although they are memorable.)  Alec Baldwin was probably done his scenes in half a day.  (Di Niro himself provides a listless shuffle-on.)  While Jolie, Turturro, Gambon, Hutton, and Hurt are around a bit longer, none are around long enough to help.Di Niro also shows us his Hollywood juice through funding; the film is beautifully produced, time and place are evoked exceptionally well, clothes, cars, interior design, all done with great care.  Why then is The Good Shepherd longer than a Sunday afternoon double-header between two last place teams?  For starters, the run-time is a shockingly self-indulgent 167 minutes, pushing the 3-hour envelope.  For another, absolutely nothing happens.  It would be tempting to blame this on Matt Damon, (still unconvincing when playing an adult, much less an adult in a position of authority), or on Eric Roth, who wrote the screenplay.  But Damon, as the ""anti-Bourne,"" is clearly doing what's he's told, and Roth's screenplay might have been good had it been significantly tightened.As readers of John Le Carre know, the actual work of spies, the tradecraft, is extremely boring.  The fascinating aspect of their world lies in the personalities of these people, their emptiness, their loneliness, their complete inability to trust, their facility with lies until they arrive at the point where they're barely able to believe themselves, and the devastating emotional toll all of this takes.  Carre's work walks you through this inner landscape in a way film never can, because film is a visual medium, and watching a stone faced Matt Damon for the better part of 3 hours tells us nothing - which is rather the point - his ability to reveal nothing serves him well as a spy.Di Niro gets an ""A"" for hubris, he strong-armed a lot of ""names"" onto the set.  And he gets an ""A"" for ambition, it's a complex story of inner turmoil, difficult moral choices, layers of deception, and the clash between idealism and pragmatism.  But he gets an ""F"" for implementation and direction, averaging out to a ""C.""

Robert De Niro is not among the most fluid of filmmakers, but his movie is consistently informative and interesting. The movie is surprisingly balanced, neither blindly apologetic of the CIA nor wildly condemnatory. De Niro even plays a small role, as a General based on Bill Donovan, the founder of the OSS (the characters in this movie are thinly veiled portraits of real people, but with different names). The protagonist in the movie is Edward Wilson, played by Matt Damon and clearly inspired by James Jesus Angleton (the counterintelligence chief at the CIA for many years). Though the fact that Angleton was half Mexican is omitted here, most of his professional life appears here: his early life as a student of poetry in Yale, his role in World War II as an intelligence officer, his relationship with Kim Philby (who goes here by the name of Arch Cummings, and is played, against type, by Billy Crudup), his role in the Golitsyn-Nosenko affair. He also appears as having a role in two operations he wasn't directly involved: the 1953 coup against Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz and the 1961 failed invasion of Bay of Pigs. One of the few flaws of the movie is its try at amateur psychology by having Wilson's motivations based on the suicide of his father (something which did not happen in Angleton case).

The timeframe of the film spans from 1939, where Wilson becomes a member of the Skull and Bones, all the way to 1961, where the Bay of Pigs plays a pivotal role in Wilson's overall development.  Taking his time to flesh out certain aspects of Wilson's life, Director Robert DeNiro (yes, THAT Robert DeNiro) allows us to come to know who this man was, even if the guarded nature of his persona makes him appear a mystery most times.  I loved the progressive nature of the film and the way that the film was so sharply edited to find a sense of tension amidst a rather cold and slow moving premise (yes, this film is void of any real action).  Still, one feels the overwhelming intensity that accompanies such a complicated lifestyle.To all that I admired, I would be amiss if I didn't criticize the film in parts.  For starters, Angelina Jolie is completely miscast here and truly squanders her talent.  I mean, she brings NOTHING to the table and seems completely awkward in every scene she's in.  I also found the big reveal surrounding Wilson's father to be anticlimactic and underwhelming.  I loved the angle revolving around The Bay of Pigs and Wilson's connection, and I felt that the film's finale was expertly played (if not a tad soap operatic in tone), but the emotional connection one was supposed to make between Wilson's actions and those of his father aren't as impactful as I would have wanted.There is a balance necessary in order to make a film's cold nature feel relatable, and little touches are needed to bring us there.  `The Good Shepherd' is far more engaging than some will suggest, but it lacks those touches to make it feel poignant to the audience.Still, I highly recommend seeing this; even though I understand why most won't like it.",4,A cold night...,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,2515,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'whole', 'lot', 'film', 'mainly', 'received', 'such', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'critics', 'awards', 'bodies', 'alike', 'fact', 'high', 'pedigree', 'subject', 'matter', 'baity', 'Still', 'wanted', 'see', 'so', 'indulged', 'curiosity', 'other', 'night', 'rather', 'surprising', 'effect.I', 'expected', 'be', 'bored', 'stiff', 'unengaged', 'what', 'found', 'was', 'much', 'tighter', 'much', 'more', 'involved', 'film', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'flaws', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'merit', 'either.', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'story', 'one', 'CIA', 'founding', 'fathers', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'Wilson', 'sharp', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'corralled', 'very', 'different', 'guarded', 'lifestyle', 'being', 'inducted', 'CIA', 'timeframe', 'film', 'spans', '1939', 'where', 'Wilson', 'member', 'Skull', 'Bones', 'way', '1961', 'where', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Wilson', 'overall', 'development', 'Taking', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Wilson', 'life', 'Director', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'yes', 'THAT', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'come', 'know', 'who', 'man', 'was', 'even', 'guarded', 'nature', 'persona', 'appear', 'mystery', 'most', 'times', 'loved', 'progressive', 'nature', 'film', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'sharply', 'edited', 'find', 'sense', 'tension', 'rather', 'cold', 'slow', 'moving', 'premise', 'yes', 'film', 'void', 'real', 'action', 'Still', 'one', 'overwhelming', 'intensity', 'complicated', 'lifestyle.To', 'admired', 'would', 'be', 'amiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'criticize', 'film', 'parts', 'starters', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'completely', 'miscast', 'here', 'truly', 'squanders', 'talent', 'mean', 'NOTHING', 'table', 'completely', 'awkward', 'scene', 'also', 'found', 'big', 'reveal', 'surrounding', 'Wilson', 'father', 'be', 'anticlimactic', 'underwhelming', 'loved', 'angle', 'revolving', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'Wilson', 'connection', 'felt', 'film', 'finale', 'was', 'expertly', 'played', 'not', 'tad', 'soap', 'operatic', 'tone', 'emotional', 'connection', 'one', 'was', 'supposed', 'make', 'Wilson', 'actions', 'father', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'impactful', 'would', 'have', 'balance', 'necessary', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'cold', 'nature', 'feel', 'relatable', 'little', 'touches', 'are', 'needed', 'bring', 'there', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'far', 'more', 'engaging', 'will', 'suggest', 'touches', 'make', 'feel', 'poignant', 'audience.Still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'even', 'understand', 'why', 'most', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like']",N/A
1051914,A2MC5UUX81BJ38,B000MXPE7O,"Aramis68 ""Aramis68""","[10, 19]","THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!I hated this movie.  From the start, the movie (while portraying itself and a historically based drama) plays with history to make a politically motivated piece, designed to mislead those without a working knowledge of history.Within the first 20 minutes, I was worried what the film was going to portray.  Damon's character is contacted by a General William Sullivan, who has been tasked by the President (FDR) to create a secret service, knowing that the US will eventually be pulled into WWII.  He tells Damon that the soon to be OSS wants Ivy League Blue Bloods like him, not 'jews, negroes or Catholics.""  Sullivan smiles and essentially states that he can say the latter because he's a Catholic.The man who created the OSS was William Donovan.  The writer plays with the Irish names but the character is Donovan. However, the portrayal of Donovan is purposefully wrong:  Donovan wasn't anti-Jewish, anti-black or Catholic.  He is famous for allowing anyone, from right wing to Communist into the OSS as he was dedicated to destroying Nazism.  This is something I have gleaned from reading at least 3 OSS books, one of them written by a man who was an admitted 60's activist who idolized Donovan because while he never limited himself by ideology (he was a a Republican who FDR trusted), he just wanted to defeat Nazism.  Thus, from the outset, the movie is falsely portraying the creator of the OSS, the precursor of the CIA, as racist, anti-semetic and intolerant.Damon's Character:Is cold and unemotional throughout most of the movie, except when he falls for the deaf girl.  This is done to let the viewer know that the future CIA betrayer has a soul.  Their most significant date is at an almost all black jazz club in 1940.  Thus, Damon's character (who eventually betrays the Bay of Pigs operation) isn't a traitor: he's a tolerant man who loves disabled women and is caught up in circumstances beyond his control, where he finally sees the truth.Damon's character is cold, unable to relate to his own son.  As a a father he is purposefully distant, seeing fighting Communism as more critical than raising his son.  This means CIA are all cold and distant, Therfore, their mission (defeating Communism) is improper.Angelina Jolie:Her character plays an odd dual role:  she is Damon's unloved wife: mother of a child of a night of passion but never truly loved by Damon who's true love is a deaf woman.Her role is not appropriate to her stature in Hollywood (a stature I disagree with).  In this movie, it is manipulation for the director, DeNiro, who plays with her fame:  how can Matt Damon ignore such a hot woman (Jolie) for a less attractive deaf one?  Jolie got Brad Pitt but she is incapable of winning Damon's character's heart.  He must be cold.  To make matters worse, he cheats on Jolie with a matronly German at a time when he purely hates Communists.  HE MUST he nuts if he wants an ugly German over a hot Jolie.Viva Cuba:Damon eventually betrays the Bay of Pigs invasion which would have overthrown Castro but Hollywood has romanticized Castro and Che, so the decision (of Damon) to betray the US in ordder to assist Castro is forgiveable and endlessly romantic.Pure Propoganda:As 'Sullivan' becomes more anti-Communust, he admits to suffering more and more to diabetes, which requires them to chop off his legs: thus, America is rotting from its fixation on Anti-Communism.To add to this 'subtle' rotting analogy, there comes a the Soviet defector.  After being injected with LSD, he launches into a soliloquy where the defector admits the USSR is a paper tiger with no spare parts and no ability to fight; it's a creation of the 'military industrial complex' (yes, the Soviet uses the Eisenhower phrase) to maintain the  power of said complex... therefore, the Cold War is a hoax:  they were never a threat, just a pawn in the game of the Capitalist Industrialists!This, of course, ignores the 70's where Communism spread worldwide.  A country with no spare parts somehow sustains a 10 year war in Afghanistan, requiring Reagan to authorize the dispatch of Stinger missiles to win the war. It ignores the 1956 invasion of Hungary, the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, the relentless efforts to turn Vietnam, Cambodia, Nicaragua, Ethiopia and many other nations into Communist pawns or the endless violations of SALT I, II and the ABM treaty.  Millions suffered under the yoke of communism, yet the Communists are innocent?  Preposterous.  Why is it I know of no Conservative who fails to conclude Nazism was an evil yet I can find Liberals who will defend Communism?This movie exploits our short memories. DeNiro's position is that the Cold War was never a hot one, so the Communists were never a real threat.  This sickens me and anyone who knows how Eastern Europe suffered, but their names are hard to spell, so who cares.  At least, that is De Niro's view.

McVarish,"[0, 1]","THE GOOD SHEPHERD is an extraordinarily powerful film about the people and events of ""brief"" but critical importance in the history of the United States and the World. The film is deadly serious,thoroughly unglamorous depiction of the founding of THE INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT and of dedicated men(human-all-too humanly flawed and wounded by levels of intrigue,violence,betrayal and sacrifice required to establish the ascendency of the United States as leader and protector of the West). Viewers ignorant of history...the importance of a CIA often reluctant yet ruthlessly required to defend decadent democracies and effete,indolent elites against world-wide assault by Totalitarianism and its DARKNESS AT NOON mentalities...are stunned and bewildered by TGS's studied lack of Bondian-Cowboy action. Indeed,IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH,as Orwell declared in 1984, but only now does our dismayed and dismaying citizenry begin to recognize the tocsin in the depth of a story requiring intelligence and sympathy with(if not admiration)of true patriotism.Our decadent,corrupt and manifestly ignorant elites are what the CIA valiantly opposed in the West's enemies (It comprised what Churchill called ""the rough men who go willing into Darkness to hunt down evil men who would do us harm"" and destroy our way of life.)Again,we have met the enemy~BUT NOW HE IS US. It is notthe SS;the East German Stasi,or numerous formations of the KGB that threatenour republic but a governmental construct so totally alien to our Founding principles and so hewn in cowardice,deceit and a singular embrace of the glamor of evil,that our response has been to turn-up the(mindless)music and DANCE (or play golf or cash-out The SNAP dole)...THE GOOD SHEPHERD is a serious story about the lives and deaths of heroes(rather than playboy actors and celebrities). Reviews I read in the MSM when this film premiered were astoundingly ignorant.They said little about importance of plot,its themes, or stunningly effective renditions of courage and despair conveyed by the ensemble cast.The movie told of a secret fight-for-life for the greatest tradition of individuality and opportunity the world has(or ever will)""almost""witnessed;as much of it remains hidden under cloak and dagger.

1051917,A3CKPNSGA7JOLK,B000MXPE7O,"Bachelier ""&#34;1004&#34;""","[6, 10]","A beautifully filmed piece of worthless sheet of Anti-American propaganda: Leni Riefenstahl would be proud.Back in the old days (pre-1940), Ivy League schools weren't meritocracies but sylvan glades where the sons of wealthy East Coast patricians gambolled and frolicked before taking their rightful place running government and corporations like the good oligarchs they were. And this film purports to get to the psychological and sociological roots of how very very evil all that was....and still is.Which is why it is a beautifully gilded crock of smelly horse pucky, with clouds of green bottle flies dining on its moist putrid reek. It was so bad I could not stop watching, and eventually started laughing.For those of you who want to cut-to-the chase for the thesis here is the stunning, original, insightful, startling, brave, rebellious, and groundbreaking insight this monumental film contributes to history (the ""Oscar"" statuette for the first time-ever! bends at the waist and bows his head).................shhhhhhh....sshhhhhhhhhh.....De Niro is about to pronounce... (a kind of hush falls over humanity as we anticipate this genius .....as he proclaims the dawn of a new age with his word)....""WASPs are evil.""There it is. The WASP sense of entitlement, noblesse oblige, privilege, power ...it is all a mask for murderous racist misogynistic eugenic horror. These guys don't need triple-K hoods because they have old school ties instead.Okay, the good things: this is a beautifully filmed movie, with absolutely lovely sets, the art direction and the cinematography and yes, even the direction is excellent.Tammy Blanchard is stunning as Laura, an old girlfriend of the hero whose presence and then absence from his life provides leitmotifs of loss throughout. Her performance alone is worth watching this film, and she was so good I'm going to seek out her other work just based on what she did here.William Hurt is particularly well-cast as a leading patrician spook and delivers his usual good performance.Angelina Jolie is okay, but you can't ever get into her character because De Niro's direction, and her wardrobe, and her makeup all were carefully constructed to say only one thing and one thing loudly ""HEY LOOK! WE GOT ANGELINA JOLIE IN THIS PICTURE! PRETTY SWEET, EH?!"" it is impossible to forget that it is *her* and not *her*character*.The minor characters outshine the stars throughout. Joe Pesci is dead on in a small artful cameo (and I usually hate him) where he creates a *character* that is different from himself. You actually have to blink to make sure it is him.Which brings us to Matt Damon, who mysteriously does not appear in this film. Why De Niro cast the Damon puppet from Trey Parker and Matt Stone's ""Team America: World Police"" for the lead role will perhaps forever remain a mystery in annuls of Movianna (perhaps budget constraints is the explanation).The Damon puppet gives a credible but wooden performance in its limited, expressionless, range. And perhaps this was De Niro's goal. But the difficulty is the blank grain of the barely painted static wood block simply doesn't point to any interior conflict that is the entire subtext and purpose of the film. Other critics have projected their own emotional reactions to the *script* and *plot* onto the puppet's performance, but even with clever lighting and muted shadows (all stolen from Riefenstahl and German expressionism) the puppet remains, well, a puppet. Its ceaseless repetition of the one line ""Matt Damon"" got pretty tiresome, as were the 50's style half-horn rim glasses superglued to its ears. De Niro simply went overboard in trying to cast for a wooden performance, but we can suppose he did not want to take the risk of having a flesh and blood actor who might comprehend what was going on.Which leads to the other bad things in the film (a list of endless clich&eacute;'s begins here): WASPs are emotionless, secret societies are evil, wealth is abused, cripples and blacks are not worthy of the love of gods, government is there for the privileged, WASPS are actually cyrpto-Nat-zees, women aren't worthy of respect and are nothing but breed cows and catchers mitts for our genetic sputum, etc.But the biggest, unresolved, and forever bizarre bug-a-boo of Hollywood is a thesis that is paradoxical and has mutually exclusive axioms:  The CIA is so powerful it can do anything and it is simultaneously an organization of incompetent buffoons motivated to do foolish counterproductive and damaging things. The Good Shepherd manages to make the case for both ideas and as far as I can tell, is serious.I really could not stop laughing. This is the biggest pot of poo I have ever seen, and if there is a single creative or original idea in the whole mess of twaddle, I'll be flummoxed if I could find it. Like the boy happily and energetically digging through a pile of manure expecting to find a pony at the bottom of it, I kept watching. But nope, as the credits rolled it became flabbergastingly evident that De Niro was serious and this was his real expression and intent.Your time would be better spent making shadow puppets with your hands and naming lefty ""clich&eacute;"" and righty ""Jolie"" unless you, like myself and ""Sprockets"" Dieter say:""Did you mean for me to scream?""",1,Leonard Pinth-Garnell gives it a Bad Cinema

This is a complex, intricate film that will reward those who follow along, although the almost three hour length will be a bit much for most. In describing the ideal candidate for an intelligence officer, one character states that attention to detail and the ability to sort truth from misdirection is paramount. The same attributes could describe the ideal viewer, let alone the ability to deduce the outcome. In ways it's reminiscent of The Conversation, with failure, guilt. trust and choice as major themes that are sometimes played out in ironic twists of fate.Matt Damon's performance might seem wooden, but it's the few moments when humanity does creep through his stoic front that are the tell-tale heart of this movie...what at first appears to be a shield becomes reality over time. It's a difficult character to play but he handles it well (aging makeup aside - or was DeNiro saying that ""nothing ever changes""?).Many comments here rake Angelina Jolie over the coals, but I don't know why. Her nuanced performance was excellent, from the flirtatious child of privilege toying with her beau (her insipid question at the beach tryst shows he desperation for an emotion she has never been surrounded by and doesn't understand) to the confused and later frustrated wife who realizes she ultimately is surrounded by deception.The cast is filled with superlative actors, although some don't get beyond a few small cameos. Billy Crudup, John Turturro, Alec Baldwin and William Hurt are very good in support, as is Oleg Shtefanko as Damon's KGB counterpart. However, Michael Gambon is exceptional - an Oscar nomination would not have been out of line.The pace is methodical, and DeNiro's decision to jump timelines might exhaust the patience of those seeking to follow the plot.

Damon isn't known for his exciting acting abilities (with the exception ofGood Will Huntingwhich I consider his quasi-breakout role). He's established himself as Jason Bourne in theThe Bourne Identityfranchise, but that doesn't take much acting ability and is almost purely a physical job. His character in theOcean's Elevenjust seems to go through the motions. He's had limited success in films likeSaving Private RyanandThe Departed. I say ""limited"" because it was the other characters and screenplay that brought him recognition more than his own abilities (try imagining Saving Private Ryan without Tom Hanks or The Departed without Leonardo DiCaprio and you'll see what I mean.) So I wasn't drawn to this flick simply because I knew Damon was our main man. But I was wonderfully surprised.Damon was the perfect choice for this role, and that isn't necessarily a compliment. His portrayal of Edward Wilson is flat, ineffectual, and unremarkable, just like the character was supposed to be. Just like many of Damon's previous portrayals. It is this absurd, unemotional character that drives the entire film, and thanks to director/actor Robert DeNiro's relentless pursuit of this movie (it was his pet project for over ten years) we have a gem.Beginning with Robert Kennedy's disastrous Bay of Pigs debacle, the film shows Ed Wilson (Damon) trying to overcome an American/Cuban historical event that many find shameful. The CIA had a leak somewhere that blew the entire assault, and Wilson has to find out who and how. It will take him back to the very beginnings of the CIA, pre-WWII, and then slowly catch up to the1960's.Battling the Cold War with a very worthy Russian opponent, Ed must come to grips with the death of his father (who was an OSS spy in WWI), the loveless relationship with his wife (played by Angelina Jolie), and what he's prepared to do for his son (Eddi Redmayne) when he learns of ignorant betrayal from within.The film really looks at the development of the CIA, how it came to be, what spying is REALLY like (not James Bond-ish), and one man's unwavering support for his country. Dark corners are everywhere, including Ed Wilson's own home. Life and business blur. Separating the man from the mission becomes impossible. A panoply of scenes greets each moment of Ed's life, from the shadowy corners of Post-WWII Berlin to the recesses of his home sanctuary. It's an incredible display with truly gripping photography and a frightening descent into the world of phantom spies.A powerhouse cast graces the screen, with fine performances from such greats as John Turturro (Thirteen Conversations About One Thing), Joe Pesci and William Hurt (Syriana).Surprisingly THE GOOD SHEPHERD has made it up to one of my all-time favorite spy films. But a warning call must be sound here. This isn't your typical spy flick. It won't be for everyone. But if you like to think about where the CIA came from and how espionage jobs really work, this one will be high on your list, too.",5,A Fantastic Espionage/Spy Flick -- Just Don't Look For James Bond,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,3107,"['amazing', 'film', 'so', 'highly', 'regarded', 'especially', 'have', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'lead', 'character', 'Damon', ""n't"", 'known', 'exciting', 'acting', 'abilities', 'exception', 'ofGood', 'Will', 'Huntingwhich', 'consider', 'quasi-breakout', 'role', 'established', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'theThe', 'Bourne', 'Identityfranchise', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'acting', 'ability', 'almost', 'purely', 'physical', 'job', 'character', 'theOcean', 'Elevenjust', 'go', 'motions', 'had', 'limited', 'success', 'films', 'likeSaving', 'Private', 'RyanandThe', 'Departed', 'say', 'limited', 'was', 'other', 'characters', 'screenplay', 'brought', 'recognition', 'more', 'own', 'abilities', 'try', 'imagining', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Departed', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'drawn', 'flick', 'simply', 'knew', 'Damon', 'was', 'main', 'man', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'surprised.Damon', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'role', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'compliment', 'portrayal', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'flat', 'ineffectual', 'unremarkable', 'just', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Just', 'many', 'Damon', 'previous', 'portrayals', 'absurd', 'unemotional', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'thanks', 'director/actor', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'movie', 'was', 'pet', 'project', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'gem.Beginning', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'disastrous', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'debacle', 'film', 'Ed', 'Wilson', 'Damon', 'trying', 'overcome', 'American/Cuban', 'historical', 'event', 'many', 'find', 'shameful', 'CIA', 'had', 'leak', 'somewhere', 'blew', 'entire', 'assault', 'Wilson', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'how', 'will', 'take', 'back', 'very', 'beginnings', 'CIA', 'pre-WWII', 'then', 'slowly', 'catch', 'up', ""the1960's.Battling"", 'Cold', 'War', 'very', 'worthy', 'Russian', 'opponent', 'Ed', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'death', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'OSS', 'spy', 'WWI', 'loveless', 'relationship', 'wife', 'played', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'what', 'prepared', 'do', 'son', 'Eddi', 'Redmayne', 'when', 'ignorant', 'betrayal', 'within.The', 'film', 'really', 'development', 'CIA', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'what', 'spying', 'REALLY', 'not', 'James', 'Bond-ish', 'one', 'man', 'unwavering', 'support', 'country', 'Dark', 'corners', 'are', 'everywhere', 'including', 'Ed', 'Wilson', 'own', 'home', 'Life', 'business', 'blur', 'Separating', 'man', 'mission', 'impossible', 'panoply', 'scenes', 'greets', 'moment', 'Ed', 'life', 'shadowy', 'corners', 'Post-WWII', 'Berlin', 'recesses', 'home', 'sanctuary', 'incredible', 'display', 'truly', 'gripping', 'photography', 'frightening', 'descent', 'world', 'phantom', 'spies.A', 'cast', 'graces', 'screen', 'fine', 'performances', 'such', 'greats', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Thirteen', 'Conversations', 'One', 'Thing', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Syriana', '.Surprisingly', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'SHEPHERD', 'made', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'spy', 'films', 'warning', 'call', 'must', 'be', 'sound', 'here', ""n't"", 'typical', 'spy', 'flick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'like', 'think', 'where', 'CIA', 'came', 'how', 'espionage', 'jobs', 'really', 'work', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'high', 'list', 'too']",N/A

Also Angelina Jolie seems, in my opinion, miscast for the role of a neglected wife. She dosen't look the part to me, and then there's also the same problem as with Matt Damons character: it is too plain. The acting is good enough, the parts are jsut boring.The interesting personas are all confined to minor parts for example the English professor played by Michael Gambon and John Turturros secretary/operative Brocco.The movie is also a wee bit long.

Actors who are very well known and recognized as some of the best in the business are seen in it.  So why does this movie stink so badly?  Well what they are really trying to capitalize on is simply everyone's fascination with skull and bones.  Everyone thinks oh yeah it is a secret club with influence so it is bad, well you know most people don't know anything about it in the first place, they just see some film depict a secret meeting and turn into hordes of walking zombies, ranting and raving ""Bush and Kerry were in it!"" I just laugh.  The way they spied and used recon and photographs to figure stuff out is kind of neat you know, because that is how they did it back then.  The lady getting thrown out of the airplane on her way to being married was by far the most sickening and sad scene in the film.  Other than that it just plods along like a legless zombie, crawling...reaching...for something it cannot capture.  Do your research because I did and most of the supposed ""facts"" of this film in regards to the beginning of the CIA are not even true, which just further shows how Hollywood will bastardize anything of the truth in order to sway the masses and make some money.  They easily accomplish the former, but the latter category they may have fallen short.  Then yeah spice it up with more skull bones meetings which are really so boring and full of false pomp that it is a wonder anyone has figured out these are less deadly than the gangs of thugs that are currently residing in places like Detroit and Orange County.  DeNiro is a great actor but he really cannot save this film.  Damon is superior in this role but Brangelina is clearly distracted by something and is not very focused.

1051939,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000MXPE7O,C. B Collins Jr.,"[10, 12]","I gave this film 5 stars for its courage and willingness to trust the intelligence of the audience to unravel a complex plot and complicated relationships. This is not an easy film for those who don't wish to solve the multiple puzzles we are presented. The film reflects a philosophy that both character analysis and espionage are complex, multi-layered, and often are not what they seem on the surface.The film uses a crisis situation at the CIA to unfold the history of the CIA as well as the history of the agency's top administrators that parallels the development of the agency and its mission. The Bay of Pigs invasion is a failure and it appears that Fidel Castro and his Soviet handlers were well aware of where the invading force would land on the coast of Cuba. This crisis is revisited repeatedly as we see the development of the CIA and the development of Edmund Wilson, an OSS Officer who becomes a CIA founder.Matt Damon plays a resolved, cold character, Edmund Wilson, who is dedicated to the protection of his country even though there are multiple consequences for him, his wife, and his son. He receives two odd, manipulated video and audio tapes that begin to reveal who might have tipped off the soviets and Fidel that the Americans were coming. These tapes are all part of a complex effort to neutralize Wilson by the KGB.The film traces the development of the agency from its OSS roots in World War II. Wilson becomes a spy and is located in London during the war where he is involved with some of the spy and counter-spy activities with the Nazis. His old English Professor at Yale turns out to be a spy who mentors him during the war on intelligence gathering and analysis. However after the war in post-war Berlin he gets to fully experience and develop his craft in a cat and mouse game with the Soviets as they try to find Nazi scientists that both wish to capture and recruit for the emerging cold war.Yet all these espionage experiences also teach him that he can not trust anyone as he experiences duplicity from trusted friends and associates. Gradually Wilson becomes more aware of his KGB rival and they play a deadly and complex game to undermine each other's attempts at intelligence gathering. For example, Wilson attempts to get Nazi scientists out of Germany before the Soviets can obtain them. His translator is eventually revealed to be a spy who is helping the Soviets obtain the scientists or at least trade Jewish scientists for Nazi scientists.The Soviet spy known as Ulysses sends decoy officials to give disinformation to the CIA, he follows Wilson and tries to disrupt his marriage when Wilson has a one-night-stand with an old girlfriend. Eventually the pain and intrigue gets closer and closer to Wilson, trying to find a way to compromise his integrity and put him in a position to give information to the Soviets.I found the film very interesting and complex, requiring me to pay attention to subtle relationships, images, lines of dialogue, and understated movements. This gives the film a feeling of authenticity. In addition, the KGB and the CIA both played very dirty and this seems very realistic. We see spies killed once they are no longer needed and have too much information to allow to live.The cast was superb with Matt Damon playing a cool, hardened man who has sacrificed much for his country yet his sacrifice is silent and only he really knows the extent of what he has lost and how little he has personally gained. In fact, the man had not really gained personally at all except that he has been given intellectually devious competition against which he feels he must prevail. He sacrificed his first love to marry the pregnant sister of his Yale friend and co-member of the Skull and Bones club.Angelina Jolie plays the flirty passionate Senator's daughter who becomes married to a cold man possessed with a mission to protect the USA. She is neglected and resentful. Years of absence from the home distances husband and wife until Edmund can only feel compassion for his wife for all she has endured to support his career and dedication.William Hurt plays the handsome, smart, first director of the CIA who overplays his hand by becoming a board member of a coffee company that benefits from the CIA assassinating the President of a Latin American nation that was nationalizing the businesses within their borders on a path toward Communism. Edmund Wilson gentle lets him know that the game is up and thus allows him to resign and move on without scandal.Robert De Nero plays the role of a General who heads OSS and then lays the groundwork for the CIA at the end of WWII. Alec Balwin plays a cool detached FBI agent who is an ally for Wilson and allows him to identify problem personnel within the CIA. Billy Crudup plays his British counterpart and mentor who eventually is revealed to be something other than what he presents. Joe Pesci plays a Mafia don who assists in the Bay of Pigs invasion when Castro takes over 4 of his casinos in Havana.Eventually the Bay of Pigs crisis is resolved from the intelligence aspect and the culprit who has said too much is revealed. Heavy prices are paid.Those that serve their country with their minds are often overlooked and under appreciated since they make personal sacrifice that only they know have been made. The sacrifices are not made just by the individual who is in government service, but also by those that love him/her and those that he/she loves. This intelligent film honors all those individuals. It is brave motion picture making.",5,"Intelligent film, complex characters, complicated plot",1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,5560,"['gave', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'courage', 'willingness', 'trust',

If you want gung-ho, bullet dodging heroes then Tom Clancy and Harrison Ford are the guys for you. If you want to know where the men who are now running the USA (and hence the world) originated, and how they took a stranglehold on power, then watch this film.  It is an intelligent account of the early days of the CIA: an extension of a rich old boy's network that may have begun with honourable intentions, but soon became a cabal, protecting vested interests, and now views its purpose solely to nurture the interests of one percent of one country's citizens, at the expense of just about everyone else on the planet.  If that takes grey, violent men, obsessively secretive to the point of destroying their own families, then that's a price they willingly pay.The film succeeds admirably. De Niro maintains intelligence (pun intended) throughout, without pandering to target audiences or oversimplifying in case `they' won't understand it. Two or three viewings may be necessary to absorb everything here. Like Emilio Estevez's Bobby, I think this is a `where it all started to go wrong' film, inviting comparisons with today. As a Russian defector, at the end of his tether under torture says:`Soviet power is a myth. A great show. But there are no spare parts. Nothing is working. It's nothing but painted rust. But you.

First of all, the only thing it had in common with the Godfather is that three people got wacked, DeNiro was in it and it was really long at 2 hours and 47 minutes. Oh, and it has Joe Pesci in it too, who has been known to cohoot with the mobster types.Thriller? There was absolutely nothing thrilling about it. In fact, it was very slow and tedious. It starts off interesting, showing how Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) was recruited and indoctrinated into the world of spying and the elite secret group ""the Skull & Bones"". It also has an interesting Love story between Wilson, Clover (Angelina Jolie) & a shy deaf girl named Laura (Tammy Blanchard).The problem with the film is that it didn't need to be nearly 3 hours long. It really didn't. The movie had no elements of intrigue or hook. It was just a series of events that showed how the life of a spy slowly and systematically destroyed a good man.The film is well filmed and well acted, I'm not knocking these elements of the film. It was just boring.To make a long story short, which DeNiro (who directed the film) should have done, the movie could have been shortened dramatically. After about an hour and forty minutes of the film, I found myself hitting the fast forward button and fully understanding everything that was speeding past my eyes.There's nothing wrong with long movies, but you better have something that keeps your interest.

Slipman,"[0, 1]","The Robert DeNiro directed ""The Good Shepherd"" was an overly ambitious, 167 minute film that chronicled the formulation of the CIA through the eyes of the humorless Edward Wilson played by Matt Damon.  Damon playing the eventual CIA head of counter intelligence was one of a star studded cast that couldn't save this plodding film which could have been cropped by at least 30 minutes.  Not only was the film editing questionable but the musical score often times drowned out the dialogue.  The characters were not particularly well developed diminishing their ability to evoke empathy for them.  Venerable veteran actors like Joe Pesci, Timothy Hutton and DeNiro himself were given toothless cameos that didn't showcase their abilities.DeNiro who also starred in the film as General Bill Sullivan, a prominent architect of the CIA, used a flashback format to weave his tale.  Damon seen in the film's present, 1961, takes partial responsibility for the Cuban Bay of Pigs fiasco.  We are then time warped back to the late 1930's to Damon's induction into Yale University's prestigious Skull and Bones fraternal order.  His privileged background allows him to travel in the upper echelons of society.  He is soon recruited by FBI agent Sam Murach played by Alec Baldwin to spy on his thesis professor Fredericks played by Michael Gambon who is sympathetic to Nazism.Soon after being cajoled into marriage as a result of a sexual fling resulting in pregnancy with loose society girl Clover Russell played by a miscast Angelina Jolie, Damon enlists with the intelligence arm of the military. He spends 6 years in Europe separated from his wife and son running the O.S.S. in London ably assisted by John Turturro playing Ray Brocco. On and on the story goes.  The O.S.S. becomes the CIA and Damon rises in the ranks of the intelligence hierarchy.The central theme to the story is Damon's dedication to the service and his country while eschewing his family.  What goes around comes around as Damon's son, Edward Jr. now grown up and played by Eddie Redmayne also joins the CIA putting Damon in the crosshairs of his Soviet counterpart Ulysses played by Oleg Shtefanko.",3,The genesis of the CIA,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,2163,"['Robert', 'DeNiro', 'directed', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'was', 'overly', 'ambitious', '167', 'minute', 'film', 'chronicled', 'formulation', 'CIA', 'eyes', 'humorless', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Damon', 'playing', 'eventual', 'CIA', 'head', 'counter', 'intelligence', 'was', 'one', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'plodding', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cropped', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'film', 'editing', 'questionable', 'musical', 'score', 'often', 'times', 'drowned', 'out', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'well', 'developed', 'diminishing', 'ability', 'evoke', 'empathy', 'Venerable', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'DeNiro', 'were', 'given', 'toothless', 'cameos', 'did', ""n't"", 'showcase', 'abilities.DeNiro', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'film', 'General', 'Bill', 'Sullivan', 'prominent', 'architect', 'CIA', 'used', 'flashback', 'format', 'weave', 'tale', 'Damon', 'seen', 'film', 'present', '1961', 'partial', 'responsibility', 'Cuban', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'fiasco', 'are', 'then', 'time', 'warped', 'back', 'late', '1930', 'Damon', 'induction', 'Yale', 'University', 'prestigious', 'Skull', 'Bones', 'fraternal', 'order', 'privileged', 'background', 'travel', 'upper', 'echelons', 'society', 'soon', 'recruited', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Sam', 'Murach', 'played', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'spy', 'thesis', 'professor', 'Fredericks', 'played', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'who', 'sympathetic', 'Nazism.Soon', 'being', 'cajoled', 'marriage', 'result', 'sexual', 'fling', 'resulting', 'pregnancy', 'loose', 'society', 'girl', 'Clover', 'Russell', 'played', 'miscast', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Damon', 'intelligence', 'arm', 'military', '6', 'years', 'Europe', 'separated', 'wife', 'son', 'running', 'O.S.S', 'London', 'ably', 'assisted', 'John', 'Turturro', 'playing', 'Ray', 'Brocco', 'story', 'O.S.S', 'CIA', 'Damon', 'ranks', 'intelligence', 'hierarchy.The', 'central', 'theme', 'story', 'Damon', 'dedication', 'service', 'country', 'eschewing', 'family', 'What', 'around', 'around', 'Damon', 'son', 'Edward', 'Jr.', 'now', 'up', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'also', 'CIA', 'putting', 'Damon', 'crosshairs', 'Soviet', 'counterpart', 'played', 'Oleg', 'Shtefanko']",N/A

1051947,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000MXPE7O,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Ambitious, star-studded, and lengthy, The Good Shepherd purports to give us a sense of how the CIA operated during the Cold War and how it affected those who devoted themselves to the cause.  So it is that, via a series of flashbacks, we meet an intelligent young Yale student named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), watch as he is recruited into the service of American intelligence, joins the O.S.S. during WWII, helps found the nascent CIA in the 1950s, and goes about doing the thankless, extremely difficult job of keeping America safe through foreign crises, particularly those involving Castro's Cuba in the 1960s.  It's not an expose on the CIA - which it actually deals with quite even-handedly, especially in today's day and age - as it principally focuses on the personal story of this one individual and what might be called his dehumanization at the hands of his sometimes sinister career.Unfortunately, there is a major (but not fatal) flaw at the very heart of the film.  Obviously, a man in Edward Wilson's position must be a cold and calculating man, but his characterization ventures far beyond stoic into the realms of the robotic.  Even the personal glimpses intended to get us past the emotional wall that defines him lack insight and feeling.  We see through his eyes, but we never really get a sense of his inward self.  I also had a problem seeing Wilson as the experienced, upper level CIA man he became because no effort seemed to go in to making Matt Damon appear any older as his character aged; he looks the same in the 1960s as he did in 1939.  Come on, put a few grey hairs in there or something; it takes more than a fedora to make me believe he's a quarter of a century older.  Damon just never looks the part of an older Edward Wilson, and that really impacted - and not in a good way - my perspective of the entire movie.  Additionally, even though this is not a factual account of CIA history, the film's attempt to deflect any blame from John F. Kennedy for refusing to grant air support to the otherwise sitting ducks storming the beaches at the Bay of Pigs really rubbed me the wrong way.I think it helps to have some knowledge of the historical and political background of events touched upon in this movie, especially the dark stain that is the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  That is really the lynchpin of the film's story, as one of the reasons for the failure slowly causes Wilson's personal and private lives to collide and truly test his mettle - with more than a little help from the helping hands of a formidable KGB intelligence officer.  What should be an excruciatingly painful decision dredges up virtually no emotion in the man, however - although the same can't be said of Wilson's sometimes boisterous wife (Angelina Jolie).

Matt Damon stars as Edward Wilson, whose career as an agency spook begins with his enlistment into the OSS during WW 2 and continues through that organization's metamorphosis into the CIA.The film opens in 1961, at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion. When we are first introduced to Wilson, it is quickly established that he is an officious and inscrutable, yet loyally dedicated Company man. As the story begins to jump back and forth in time (a la ""Godfather II"") we begin to get glimpses of what lies beneath Wilson's seemingly impenetrable veneer.We witness a (relatively) looser and more outgoing Wilson during his college days at Yale in 1939, as he is inducted into the infamous Skull and Bones society. As part of the initiation ritual, he is directed to regale his fellow Bonesmen with the deepest, darkest secret from his past. The club members get more than they bargain for as Wilson relates a harrowing childhood memory of bearing witness to his father's suicide. Moments before taking his own life, his father hands down a credo about ""trust"", which becomes the key to unlocking Wilson's inner workings for the remainder of the film.Therein lies the problem with ""The Good Shepherd"". There is an awful lot of internalizing going on (for 2 hours and 47 minutes). De Niro's plus as a director (not surprisingly) is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters. His minus as a director is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters, if you catch my drift. There are some pacing issues with the film. Not that I was expecting car chases and stuff blowing up real good. After all, the reality of espionage does not necessarily lend itself to flash cuts and pop music montage. It's generally a somewhat somber, mundane and unpleasant business.Eric Roth's script has its moments, but gets murky when it comes to the intrigue. It is tough to keep track of who is doing what to whom, and why (and at times, for whose ""side""?). Granted, perhaps that is part of the point; torture is torture and murder is murder, no matter how one attempts to rationalize (a point that Steven Spielberg more than sufficiently bludgeoned us over the head with in ""Munich"") but I GET it,already.Perhaps the most fatal flaw in the film is Matt Damon's unconvincing ""aging"". There is not much discernable physical transformation between Wilson's collegiate years and middle age. (Maybe some better prosthetic work could have helped?). At any rate, I just wasn't buying it, and found it to be a major distraction. Damon is a fine actor, but I think he may have been slightly miscast here.

I'm going to spare you the details of the story and get down to why I can't recommend this movie.Like many people, I was excited about a spy movie that featured great actors, and had Robert De Niro directing.  The problem with the movie is that it is a complete bore.  The main mystery/plot of the film is similar to the one in the Kevin Costner movie ""No Way Out"".  Unlike ""No Way Out"", this one doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat.  Like ""The Godfather"", we bounce back and forth from past to present.  The problem is that we are intruduced to too many story lines and too many characters.  It was difficult to tell what the goal of the story was.  Matt Damon's character might as well have been played by a robot.  He shows absolutely no emotion.  It's hard to root for characters like this.  The movie has a few decent moments.  But at almost three hours long, the movie feels over done.  A good 45 minutes of this movie could have easily been cut out.I think there might have been a decent story somewhere in there, but either the writing or directing or both stepped in its way.

1051961,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B000MXPE7O,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","Wow.  THE GOOD SHERPHERD is such an intriguing movie--and such a departure for Matt Damon; if only director Robert De Niro (and I so look forward to watching his future directorial offerings) had left about half an hour of film on the cutting room floor this film would have been as exceptional as it would have been extraordinary.  With a running time of close to three hours, the story inevitably bogs down and gets in its own way; but that's about as much badmouthing I'm going to give a movie I enjoyed as much as this one.Depicting a promising young Yale grad picked by Army intelligence to work behind the lines during World War II, then tapped on the shoulder to help found what became the CIA, Matt Damon is absolutely riveting.  His character, Edward Wilson, sacrifices everything--his personal life, his family--for espionage, intelligence, and counter-intelligence, as America enters the Cold War.  Damon is stoic, devoid of emotion, soft spoken, unflappable--cold and heartless.  Nothing seems to move him--even when his own son hangs in the balance.  The events surrounding him--the Second World War, the Cold War, the Bay of Pigs, his son's ill-advised contacts with CIA targets--are spellbinding.And you can't go wrong with Damon's supporting cast, including De Niro himself, William Hurt, and Alec Baldwin, just to name a few.  John Turturro plays an effective, sometimes brutal, assistant to Damon's Wilson, yet unfortunately, Angelina Jolie is utterly wasted (pardon the pun) in a reduced role as the neglected, drunken wife.

1051962,A1LKQ81O0BP49Q,B000MXPE7O,Dr. Miguel Faria,"[1, 3]","The Good Shepherd (2006)Former late night, talk show host Larry King wrote in the blurb on the DVD cover, &#34;The Best Spy movie ever.&#34; He is completely wrong on this one! This film is, perhaps, one of the worst ever, but certainly not the best &#8212; not by a long shot!  And this is so despite excellent performances by a great cast of actors, including Robert De Niro (Co-producer and Director) and William Hurt, two of my very favorite screen heroes.This movie demonstrates how liberal politics in Hollywood and the entertainment industry is alive and well &#8212; Clint Eastwood and Ted Nuggent, notwithstanding.This movie is pure fictional propaganda directed at embarrassing and discrediting the CIA, a perpetual punching bag of the liberal establishment of America. Research for this movie was nil; apparently the goal of the film was first to indoctrinate and obfuscate, while smearing a safe target, the CIA, which it probably did with gullible audiences; and second, to entertain, but at the latter it fails miserably. The movie basically has no substantial or believable plot, is boring, drags, and is way too long for its scant action and implausible intelligence intrigue. The characters are not engaging and do not evoke sympathy from their audience. All through the nearly 3 hour film an all embracing aloofness and vacuousness remain in the air, from beginning to its open ended conclusion. If a character stands out in this movie, it is the enemy, a suave KGB officer, &#34;Ulysses,&#34;  who tries and almost succeeds in blackmailing the main character into becoming a Soviet asset.As far as historical reality, there is none. None of the characters resemble even vaguely the historic figures of the period and all the happenings are contrived. For example, there is not even a simulacrum of the persona of CIA Director Allen Dulles or his capable Deputy Richard Bissell, who was in charge of the Bay of Pigs plans in 1961. The main protagonist in the movie, played by Matt Damon, is a mealy mouthed, fictional character named Edward Wilson, which is a curious name to use, as there was a CIA officer who later became a CIA renegade working for Muammar Gaddafi and Libyan intelligence in the 1970s named Edwin Wilson.The movie wrecks havoc with names and events. Confusion and distortions, involving Soviet KGB agents, defectors, and possible double agents, abound. But the fictionalized characters of the movie do not approximate any real historic figures or describe any real events. For example, a Russian in CIA custody is called Yuri Modin. When, in fact, Yuri Modin was a Soviet KGB spy master in London who was the controller of &#34;The Cambridge Five,&#34; British traitors from 1944 to 1955. Modin arranged the defection of Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean in 1951 to Russia.The movie then is very cavalier about throwing names around and making up fictionalized events that never happened but that an unsuspecting audience may assume them to be true. This is possible because some subplots have been crafted to vaguely resemble cloak and dagger happenings of the cold war. Take for instance the Bay of Pig fiasco, the movie makes an issue that the location of the landing may have been revealed to the Cubans by a double agent, which was in reality a moot issue. Here is another: A Soviet KGB defector is savagely beaten during interrogation and given LSD, which causes him to unceremoniously jump out of a high story window. This never happened. The CIA crushes a revolution in Latin America using biological warfare &#8212;i.e.,  the infestation of verdant crops with locusts sprayed from airplanes (Is it Guatemala in 1954? We don't know!). That never happened. And when the movie ends, it ends not with a bang but a whimper! Not recommended.Dr. Miguel A.

1051965,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000MXPE7O,D. S. Thurlow,"[4, 5]","Robert DeNiro's 2006 ""The Good Sheperd"" is a thinly fictionalized account of the founding of the Central Intelligence Agency.  It features an array of talented actors, promising plot material, and some incredibly atmospheric cinematography.  It is also a long, dark, unhappy journey into a world so complex as to almost defy translation into a feature length film.The story centers around Edward Wilson, a counterintelligence officer who at the opening of the movie is investigating a security breach affecting the failed CIA-sponsored 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.  In a series of extended flashbacks, we learn that Edward was a young, idealist Yale graduate recruited into the Office of Strategic Services at the start of the Second World War.  He learns his trade from his British counterparts, already locked into a cutthroat duel with Nazi Germany.  Edward moves on to Berlin at the close of the war to recruit former Nazis and to size up the Soviets, who will be America's postwar competition.  In particular, he meets his Soviet counterpart, a spymaster codenamed Ulysses, who will haunt his career for the next two decades.Edward returns to America in 1946, to a new organization that will become the CIA and to a loveless marriage with a woman he got pregnant right before the war.  His duties will involve him in CIA adventures in Guatemala and Cuba and in handling Soviet defectors.  As the movie circles back to the present, Edward traces a series of clues to the shocking source of the leak on the Bay of Pigs.  The answer will threaten his career and what remains of his family life.Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson as a quiet, dedicated but guarded man; he learns the hard way that no one can be trusted.  The hazards and hard moral choices of his career turn a likeable poetry-loving student into a man all but emotionally inaccessible by movie's end.  Angela Jolie puts in a anguished performance as Wilson's wife, who lives a sterile life with a man often gone and withdrawn when home.  Alec Baldwin has a nice turn as an FBI agent who works with Wilson on a number of cases.  John Turturro is superb as Wilson's long-time assistant.  Billy Crudup and William Hurt play fellow OSS and CIA colleagues.This movie gets a lot of things right about the espionage business.  The founders of the OSS and CIA relied on ties among Ivy League alumni as a substitute for a vetting process.  The spy and counterspy business between the US and Soviet Union did become a wilderness of mirrors.  The Edward Wilson character seems loosely based on James Angleton, the CIA counterintelligence chief who spent years looking for Soviet moles in the CIA.The story is extremely complex, even for those familiar with the history of the CIA.  The average viewer may be challenged to keep track of the characters and their motives.  The focus of the movie is really the effects of the spy business on its practioners; action is infrequent apart from the deaths of several agents.  This movie is likely to appeal primarily to serious fans of the spy business and the spy movie genre.",3,When the Abyss stares back into you....,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,3071,"['Robert', 'DeNiro', '2006', 'Good', 'Sheperd', 'thinly', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'founding', 'Central', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'array', 'talented', 'actors', 'promising', 'plot', 'material', 'incredibly', 'atmospheric', 'cinematography', 'also', 'long', 'dark', 'unhappy', 'journey', 'world', 'so', 'complex', 'almost', 'defy', 'translation', 'feature', 'length', 'film.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'counterintelligence', 'officer', 'who', 'opening', 'movie', 'investigating', 'security', 'breach', 'affecting', 'failed', 'CIA-sponsored', '1961', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'invasion', 'series', 'extended', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'Edward', 'was', 'young', 'idealist', 'Yale', 'graduate', 'recruited', 'Office', 'Strategic', 'Services', 'start', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'trade', 'British', 'counterparts', 'already', 'locked', 'cutthroat', 'duel', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Edward', 'Berlin', 'close', 'war', 'recruit', 'former', 'Nazis', 'size', 'up', 'Soviets', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'America', 'postwar', 'competition', 'particular', 'Soviet', 'counterpart', 'spymaster', 'codenamed', 'Ulysses', 'who', 'will', 'haunt', 'career', 'next', 'two', 'decades.Edward', 'returns', 'America', '1946', 'new', 'organization', 'will', 'become', 'CIA', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'woman', 'got', 'pregnant', 'right', 'war', 'duties', 'will', 'involve', 'CIA', 'adventures', 'Guatemala', 'Cuba', 'handling', 'Soviet', 'defectors', 'movie', 'back', 'present', 'Edward', 'series', 'clues', 'shocking', 'source', 'leak', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'answer', 'will', 'threaten', 'career', 'what', 'family', 'Damon', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'quiet', 'dedicated', 'guarded', 'man', 'hard', 'way', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'hazards', 'hard', 'moral', 'choices', 'career', 'turn', 'likeable', 'poetry-loving', 'student', 'man', 'emotionally', 'inaccessible', 'movie', 'end', 'Angela', 'Jolie', 'anguished', 'performance', 'Wilson', 'wife', 'who', 'sterile', 'life', 'man', 'often', 'gone', 'withdrawn', 'when', 'home', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'nice', 'turn', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'Wilson', 'number', 'cases', 'John', 'Turturro', 'superb', 'Wilson', 'long-time', 'assistant', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'William', 'Hurt', 'play', 'fellow', 'OSS', 'CIA', 'colleagues.This', 'movie', 'lot', 'things', 'right', 'espionage', 'business', 'founders', 'OSS', 'CIA', 'relied', 'ties', 'Ivy', 'League', 'alumni', 'substitute', 'vetting', 'process', 'spy', 'counterspy', 'business', 'US', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'did', 'become', 'wilderness', 'mirrors', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'character', 'loosely', 'based', 'James', 'Angleton', 'CIA', 'counterintelligence', 'chief', 'who', 'spent', 'years', 'looking', 'Soviet', 'moles', 'CIA.The', 'story', 'extremely', 'complex', 'even', 'familiar', 'history', 'CIA', 'average', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'challenged', 'keep', 'track', 'characters', 'motives', 'focus', 'movie', 'really', 'effects', 'spy', 'business', 'practioners', 'action', 'infrequent', 'apart', 'deaths', 'several', 'agents', 'movie', 'likely', 'appeal', 'primarily', 'serious', 'fans', 'spy', 'business', 'spy', 'movie', 'genre']",N/A

1051967,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000MXPE7O,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","As a filmmaker, Robert DeNiro shows the influence of his generation of great directors like Scorsese and Coppola with this epic-length 2006 film. In fact, there is a certain structural similarity toThe Godfatherin DeNiro's careful unfolding of the time-spanning story penned by screenwriter Eric Roth. The plot focuses on a fictionalized account of the first twenty years of the CIA as seen through the experiences of one agent named Edward Wilson, an intentionally cryptic study in excessive self-control which makes him ideal for his career. Ironically, the main problem with the film is the stoic coldness of the central character for which DeNiro and Roth cannot seem to find a voice that would make the story resonate. There is little sense of a personal journey for Wilson, even though there are hints of it beginning with his father's suicide, which is used as a leitmotif throughout the story.Another frustration of the film is the constant time-jumping between the fallout over the failed Bay of Pigs mission in 1961 and key episodes in Wilson's earlier years. The technique doesn't make the drama any more interesting than it really is. Unfortunately there is no getting around the fact that despite the handsome production detail, the movie is a slog at 248 minutes and quite often, an amazing bore. DeNiro has assembled a can't-miss cast, including himself as a pre-CIA operative, but for the most part, they are stranded by a script consisting of coded exchanges and predictable dialogue, the latter most prevalent in the domestic scenes. Matt Damon does all he can as the poker-faced Wilson, but he is given little latitude to elicit empathy for his character.While she starts out with her fiery persona intact, Angelina Jolie has a progressively smaller role as Wilson's increasingly embittered wife Clover merely defined by how shut off she is from Wilson's clandestine profession. DeNiro inexplicably does not age either Damon or Jolie with any conviction over the course of the story, and there is an oddly unsettling dynamic when they are shown as the parents of a fully grown son. Better among the huge cast are William Hurt as a lifelong mentor; Tammy Blanchard as Wilson's true love, a hearing-impaired coed with whom he is reunited years later; Billy Crudup as a rather fey British counterspy; Alec Baldwin as a covert FBI agent; and John Turturro as Wilson's no-nonsense colleague. The 2007 DVD is short on extras, as it just contains seven deleted scenes of little additional interest. Unsurprisingly, the taciturn DeNiro does not offer a director's commentary here.",3,The Spy Who Left the Rest of Us in the Cold,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,2591,"['filmmaker', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'influence', 'generation', 'great', 'directors', 'Scorsese', 'Coppola', 'epic-length', '2006', 'film', 'fact', 'certain', 'structural', 'similarity', 'toThe', 'Godfatherin', 'DeNiro', 'careful', 'unfolding', 'time-spanning', 'story', 'penned', 'screenwriter', 'Eric', 'Roth', 'plot', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'first', 'twenty', 'years', 'CIA', 'seen', 'experiences', 'one', 'agent', 'named', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'intentionally', 'cryptic', 'study', 'excessive', 'self-control', 'ideal', 'career', 'Ironically', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'stoic', 'coldness', 'central', 'character', 'DeNiro', 'Roth', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'find', 'voice', 'would', 'make', 'story', 'resonate', 'little', 'sense', 'personal', 'journey', 'Wilson', 'even', 'are', 'hints', 'beginning', 'father', 'suicide', 'used', 'leitmotif', 'story.Another', 'frustration', 'film', 'constant', 'time-jumping', 'fallout', 'failed', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'mission', '1961', 'key', 'episodes', 'Wilson', 'earlier', 'years', 'technique', ""n't"", 'make', 'drama', 'more', 'interesting', 'really', 'Unfortunately', 'getting', 'fact', 'handsome', 'production', 'detail', 'movie', 'slog', '248', 'minutes', 'quite', 'often', 'amazing', 'bore', 'DeNiro', 'assembled', ""can't-miss"", 'cast', 'including', 'pre-CIA', 'operative', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'stranded', 'script', 'consisting', 'coded', 'exchanges', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'latter', 'most', 'prevalent', 'domestic', 'scenes', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'can', 'poker-faced', 'Wilson', 'given', 'little', 'latitude', 'elicit', 'empathy', 'character.While', 'out', 'fiery', 'persona', 'intact', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'progressively', 'smaller', 'role', 'Wilson', 'increasingly', 'embittered', 'wife', 'Clover', 'merely', 'defined', 'how', 'shut', 'off', 'Wilson', 'clandestine', 'profession', 'DeNiro', 'inexplicably', 'not', 'age', 'Damon', 'Jolie', 'conviction', 'course', 'story', 'oddly', 'unsettling', 'dynamic', 'when', 'are', 'shown', 'parents', 'fully', 'grown', 'son', 'Better', 'huge', 'cast', 'are', 'William', 'Hurt', 'lifelong', 'mentor', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'Wilson', 'true', 'love', 'hearing-impaired', 'coed', 'whom', 'reunited', 'years', 'later', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'rather', 'fey', 'British', 'counterspy', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'covert', 'FBI', 'agent', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Wilson', 'no-nonsense', 'colleague', '2007', 'DVD', 'short', 'extras', 'just', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'little', 'additional', 'interest', 'Unsurprisingly', 'taciturn', 'DeNiro', 'not', 'offer', 'director', 'commentary', 'here']",N/A

Young, idealistic college boys join the preWWII espionage agencies in Britain and the US because they want to live lives of importance and make a difference.  Three generations of Yale Skull n Bones, cronyism, the planting of moles in Soviet and American spy establishments, torture, careerism, the competition between the US and the USSR for Nazi physicists, the Cold War, the space race, and finally, the Bay of Pigs fiasco -- these are the big themes of this film, which spans 25 years in the life of Edward Wilson, the young spy who joins the OSS to atone for his father's traitorous mistake.  Add to that the sexual mores of the times (c. 1940) and Edward marries for honor, not for love.  The film casts a critical eye on espionage and the people who undertake it.I liked Matt Damon in this film so much better than in the endless Bourne car chases, although his character is very hard to like.  Unlike some others who have written here, I did not think Angelina Jolie was in any way wasted in this role.  She poignantly plays an emotionally unstable woman who uses her sexuality to catch herself a husband, but ends up finding herself caught in a loveless marriage, so unsuited to be a CIA spouse.  I liked her much better here than in A Mighty Heart.  I agree with other reviewers who said that Robert DeNiro did a much better job directing this film than acting in it.  William Hurt does well as Edward's boss. Alec Baldwin plays a crusty FBI man.  Billy Crudup's British spy is so likeable that you know he will be a problem in the end. John Torturro as aide to Wilson is excellent, as are Oleg Shtefanko as Wilson's KGB counterpart and nemesis and Eddie Redmayne as Wilson's son.The atmosphere, technology, and fashions of the times are also well represented here, which also makes gives the film its claustrophobia. This is a film which improves with multiple viewings, because every bit of dialogue adds a crucial detail to the plot.  It's a very sober enterprise up to and including the last scene, where we see Matt Damon as Wilson plodding diligently down the long hall of the new CIA wing where, as reward for all he has endured over the course of the film, he will be in charge of counterespionage efforts.

1051977,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B000MXPE7O,F. S. L'hoir,"[13, 17]","I found this film to be totally absorbing, and yet, I can see how it would not appeal to those who are looking for fast-paced action. The tone is intense, moody, and thought-provoking. The main character, played convincingly by Matt Damon, is very loosely based upon James Jesus Angleton, a Yale poet, who studied counter-espionage with Kim Philby in the British SIS during World War II, and who presided over counter-espionage in the CIA during its infancy. A theme that the film explores is the toll taken by espionage on the life of the effective agent who must compartmentalize himself, since the conflicting demands of his secret work and his family are incompatible. Utter detachment is the key to survival, and Matt Damon plays the spy's abdication from all emotion to perfection.The cinematography and costumes are stunning, the music is riveting, and the actors are excellent. It is not always easy, however, to follow the story; it took several viewings for me to piece the complex events of the narrative together. In fact, the half-dozen deleted scenes, provided on the DVD, help immensely. In my opinion, the sequences with Damon's brother-in-law, who has spent time in a Soviet labor camp and may or may not be a brain-washed penetration agent, should never have been cut, since they explain a lot about the main character's family dynamic.Since the scenes shift back and forth (although the subtitles explain the location and time-frame adequately), some important plot points have been lost. For instance, in one scene the son asks to become a CIA agent, but we are never told that he actually does join. Is it after his initiation into the Agency that he falls into the Soviet honey-trap? How does he get to the Congo in the first place? Does Damon's character actually suspect  the true identity of the victim in the blackmail film? And is he responsible for the outcome or is his Soviet counterpart? These are only a few of the questions that are left to be pondered.Since the story is highly fictionalized, I am not certain why the directors introduced the young Cambridge SIS liason officer, who speaks articulately in London of the Blitz, but who develops a pronounced stammer in 1950-something Washington shortly before he defects to Moscow. Is he supposed to be a composite of Burgess, Maclean, and Philby (who stammered but did not defect until 1963)? That sub-plot is never developed. And why give the duplicitous Soviet defector-mole in Washington the name of an historical KGB officer, Yuri Modin (who was neither in Washington nor ever defected). Even though he was in London posing as a Soviet Embassy cypher clerk and  actually running Burgess and Blunt, he never pretended to be anyone other than Yuri Modin. I found this use of a real name to be jarring, since all the other characters have been given fictional names. Why not merely call the character Ivan Ivanovich?  Seems a bit rough on Modin!These are mere quibbles, though, in a story that I found, on the whole, fascinating despite the length of the film.P.S. After watching this film for a fourth time and paying close attention to the chronology, I was able to discover at least some of the answers to some the questions that I posed above. I also believe that I have figured out the relationship of the title, ""The Good Shepherd,"" to the Yale ""Whiffenpoof Song"" that the Bonesmen sing several times in the film: 'We're poor little lambs who have lost our way . . .; We're little black sheep who have gone astray. . ."" The lyrics to this song also give us a clue to an additional theme of the movie (as well as an allusion to another famous film): ""Gentlemen . . . off on a spree, doomed from here to Eternity!

If you are seeking a traditional action-adventure film, look elsewhere; this film is cerebral and not brain candy.

The story revolves around Edward Wilson (played perfectly by Matt Damon) as a privileged Yale graduate that is drawn into the counter-espionage ""business"".  I must take exception to the comment by the Amazon.com reviewer when he states: ""Viewers have to wonder why anyone, much less someone like Wilson who has everything going for him, would devote his life to a thankless job that brings so little happiness to himself and his family.""  Such a comment reflects on the reviewers failure to perceive Wilson for what he is, a committed individual with a strong sense of duty.  Wilson sees himself ""called to duty"" much, it appears, as did his father.  He places the interests of his country above his own needs and that of his family.  While you can argue the merits and dangers of nationalism, there certainly are such men and Wilson is clearly one.  I think this is a superb film, not perfect, but still superb.

And although the script confuses the viewer by its propensity to meander over many time frames and many places, the result is a tense attention holding look at the machinations of big government and frightening big Intelligence organizations.We first meet Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon, who carries the film well)  as a son who witnesses his father's suicide, a fact he will hide for years. He follows in the family footsteps of attending Yale, participating in the infamous Skull and Bones secret club, and progressed to join the government as an agent for Intelligence, eventually helping to form CIA and participate in the Cold War tension with Russia and the Bay of Pigs incident.  Wilson is a nebbish on the surface, but underneath lies a man devoted to his country and a man capable of maintaining heavy secrets, even from his wife-of-necessity Clover (Angelina Jolie) whom he marries solely because he got her pregnant.  He is distant, covert, and seemingly cold, a trait that he will pass on to his son whose life following CIA  results in tragedy.Along the way from this personal side of the story the plot is filled with politicians, spies, Russian, moles, double agents - all the expected and needed characters for a story of this sort.  The cast includes such important actors as Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, Alec Baldwin, a superb Tammy Blanchard, Robert De Niro himself, Keir Dullea, Michael Gambon, William Hurt, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton and Gabriel Macht, each performing excellent cameos.  The production values are equally strong with Robert Richardson as director of photography mixing historical footage with atmospheric cinematography, a fine musical score by Bruce Fowler and Marcelo Zarvos, and a tight editing by Tariq Anwar.  The film could easily have been cut by an hour without damaging the effect, but there is something to be said for the level of tension achieved by De Niro's choices that gives us a feeling of being a part of the Intelligence schemes. It takes patience, but the film is worth viewing.

He soon finds he can trust no one but himself, but before we are accustomed to Matt Damon's bookish characterization of a serious minded government agent, (he's described as a tight-""behind"" with no sense of humor), we can't help but wonder why he was so aggresively sought out by the CIA as a junior member. He's first seen, in drag, make-up, wig and falsetto voice, on a college theatrical stage singing in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. He is, (gulp) a poetry student, and his father committed suicide with the distinction of being a traitor to the U.S. government. These should not be high marks on a CIA score card. But without further explanation he's sought after as if he's the ideal candidate. The rest of the film is a series of knee-deep espionage, and double agent revelations that apparently astounded the filmmakers, (musical score soars), but which could be found as passive page-turners in a mediocre paperback spy novel, (watch out for the brunette with the 'hearing aid' and eastern European accent who asks you over for dinner; wink, wink, nudge, nudge). The film goes on for three hours and is missing a narrative drive despite some dramatic pitstops along the way; Angelina Jolie is quite effective as Damon's socialite wife, and the Bay of Pigs segment seems an accurate portrait of the blundering by the U.S. government, but THE GOOD SHEPHERD mostly shepherds along as if searching a landmark statement it never reveals.",3,A SHEEP IN WOLF'S CLOTHING,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,2046,"['premise', 'history', 'Central', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'CIA', 'college', 'frat-like', 'tough', 'boy', 'club', 'where', 'pig-pen', 'mud', 'wrestling', 'macho', 'truth', 'dare', 'sessions', 'Tell', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'told', 'anyone', 'were', 'order', 'day', 'troubled', 'scrutinized', 'CIA', 'early', '1960', 'Cuban', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'missile', 'crisis', 'backdrop', 'much', 'more', 'intriguing', 'story', 'GOOD', 'SHEPHERD', 'main', 'focus', 'upstart', 'recruit', 'success', 'conflict', 'founding', 'years', 'organization', 'live', 'belief', 'know', 'who', 'can', 'trust', 'soon', 'can', 'trust', 'one', 'are', 'accustomed', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'bookish', 'characterization', 'serious', 'minded', 'government', 'agent', 'described', 'tight-', 'sense', 'humor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'aggresively', 'sought', 'out', 'CIA', 'junior', 'member', 'first', 'seen', 'drag', 'make-up', 'wig', 'falsetto', 'voice', 'college', 'theatrical', 'stage', 'singing', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'opera', 'gulp', 'poetry', 'student', 'father', 'committed', 'suicide', 'distinction', 'being', 'traitor', 'U.S.', 'government', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'high', 'marks', 'CIA', 'score', 'card', 'further', 'explanation', 'sought', 'ideal', 'candidate', 'rest', 'film', 'series', 'knee-deep', 'espionage', 'double', 'agent', 'revelations', 'apparently', 'astounded', 'filmmakers', 'musical', 'score', 'soars', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'passive', 'page-turners', 'mediocre', 'paperback', 'spy', 'novel', 'watch', 'out', 'brunette', ""'hearing"", 'aid', 'eastern', 'European', 'accent', 'who', 'dinner', 'wink', 'wink', 'nudge', 'nudge', 'film', 'three', 'hours', 'missing', 'narrative', 'drive', 'dramatic', 'pitstops', 'way', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'quite', 'effective', 'Damon', 'socialite', 'wife', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'segment', 'accurate', 'portrait', 'blundering', 'U.S.', 'government', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'SHEPHERD', 'mostly', 'along', 'searching', 'landmark', 'statement', 'never']",N/A

I agree it's hard to empathise with him, but I saw that as the limitations of Matt Damon's acting abilities.  Taciturn and not particularly expressive, Matt Damon also hardly ages much across the decades that this film spans - he's too constant and thus never progresses as a character.Nonetheless, the movie is engaging - even though it could have benefitted from more tension.  As it is, the DVD's deleted scenes reveal entire sequences that would've made the movie even longer.  Given the film's multiple subplots, leaving these scenes out didn't hurt.  To sum up, The Good Shepherd plays/ reads like a book, and for those confused about the plot...watch it with subtitles.

I went into the film expecting a slow paced historical restrospective of the movie.  Althought that is what I received, for the most part, the difficult aspect of the movie was the feeling that the fine actors were aloof.  I had trouble connecting with some of the characters, especially the main leads.  Matt Damon did an excellent job, and I imagine he was directed in such a way as to seem a bit ambiguous.  Jolie's character could have been much richer; however, I think the complicated plot took such a long time to tell, that character development took a backseat.  To put this movie in terms of a novel, this would be a LeCarre vs. a Ludlum.  Do not go into this movie expecting a thrill a minute ala a Ludlum novel, rather expect a meandering complicated story ala LeCarre's Absolute friends.I have noted some very well-written reviews regarding this movie.  I agree with several of the reviewers.  However, I would argue with anyone who lables this a bad or terrible movie.  It is certainly not in my opinion.

Schneider,"[6, 10]","An intelligent spy story, somewhere along the tradition of John le Carre and Graham Greene, but set in the US intelligence environment, i.e. of course CIA and predecessors. Time is between early 40s and early 60s, so we get the world war, the cold war, some Central American adventures, and the Bay of Pigs disaster as main historical material. Throw in some African scenery.Unfortunately the build-up of the plot is very very slow. It takes very long until one can put the jig saw pieces in a framework that seems to make some sense. Also unfortunately, the considerable acting skills of Matt Damon are somewhat wasted on a character that is so low key that he hardly ever develops real contours, despite overlength. Maybe the only remarkable aspect of his character seems to be a fetish for women with hearing problems. His main love Laura is deaf, and his only other affair needs a hearing aid (his German secretary, played by Martina Gedeck). Also unfortunately, Angelina is largely underutilized as un-loved wife of the ever absent spy. (I do not think she handles her predicament badly though.) Possibly she hears too well for Mr.Wilson's taste.De Niro directs, and adds himself as a physically handicapped intelligence general who looks remarkably like Kissinger (but calls himself a Catholic). There is also Joe Pesci as a strange Italian character whose only function seems to be to provide Damon with his best line in the movie. I can not quote what Pesci said to Damon, since it is racist and Amazon's censors don't let me quote that.

De Niro signs here a severe and ruthless denunciation of the methods of the US government in the world since they started the CIA at the end of the 30s. A young man, the son of a dead-by-suicide officer of some sort, is recruited by the FBI to find out the identities of the members of a fascist group that is in fact in the hand of an American agent unknown of the FBI. He will then become an essential agent in London during the war and in Berlin after the world, covered as a commercial agent, and it is trade and nothing else, to exchange some fascist scientists who are not too important for the Jewish scientists the Soviets are getting rid of. This will lead the main character who is the head of the office in Berlin to recruit a KGB agent into his service. What is very strange is that the CIA does not find out this agent is being recruited under the name of another KGB agent (the CIA was un-informed on the subject which means they did not cover the whole world and had weak points, just like the Soviet should not have used the name of another KGB agent) and it is done with the complicity of an English agent. This man will become the mole in the CIA when Cuba becomes communist and when the US tries to organize the re-conquest in the Bay of Pigs. The failure is so enormous that they decide that there must have been a mole. And they start looking for it. The Soviet then start playing cat and mouse with the main character and manage to compromise his son in the business by making him fall in love with a woman in Africa, or at least have a sudden desire for the woman that turns into love but this woman is one of their agents. That titillates the man and he really digs out what he can dig out and finds out the real mole by some simple action: to check a book that was offered to that mole by some English agent when he was finally recruited by the CIA. That book should have been checked and was not. Negligence and non-professionalism. And this ex-KGB agent is never the object of the slightest doubt even when another KGB agent arrives and pretends he is the man carrying the name the ex-KGB agent has been recruited under. It is the son who will pay, and pay dearly, for the amateurish caper, indirectly for sure since the woman will be eliminated. So much for love among spies. But what is left after this action is finished, a tremendous action with numerous intertwined though clearly identified flashbacks over the whole period from the 1920s to the mid 1960s? First that this CIA was born in super-patriotic and super-nationalist secret groups in the US, groups that ignore democracy and in a way human dignity, since the new members have to go through a fight in the nude, in mud and with the older members eventually pissing on them. These circles and groups are dangerous. What's more they are so closed up onto themselves that they lose somewhere the necessary objectivity and a negligence becomes possible and a double agent can infiltrate the whole system. The second lesson is that this CIA is supposed to reshape the world in conformity with what the US wants. This is also very dangerous, and there the film is totally idealistic: the CIA can do what they want they can only slow down change in the world, not reverse it, Latin America being the best case ever. It has never been so nearly unanimously on the left, dark and deep pink if not completely red, and only as a reaction to the US's use of the CIA to manipulate people. These agents are also extremely inhuman. They have to forget all links with family, friends, relatives, or any acquaintances. They must be ready to betray all these in the name of their mission and purity and kill every time it is necessary. They are kept under constant surveillance either by the other side or by people on the US side that no one knows. The film finally gives you one example of the El Ghraib torturing methods and that really makes you shudder and shiver. And the tragic end will be all the more pathetic when we know the victim was right and telling the truth.

Francis Ford Copolla is one of the producers and this comes closed of being The Godfather as CIA boss.  Matt Damon who's in every scene, underplays everything which adds both to a slower pace and others to act out more.In spite of billing, John Turturro is Damon's true co-star here, having a standout scene in an interrogative sequence with Russian spy. Angelina  Jolie is quite bewitching at the beginning and acts old well as narrative takes place in twenty years, from the outbreak of World War Two to the Bay of Pigs.

Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a priviledged Yale graduate and former Skull and Bones member who is recruited to help the United States stave off the growing threat of communism both to our East and later our South. The movie centers around the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and how and why our mission in Cuba failed. Much of the film is told through flashbacks as Wilson trys to determine how and why this mission has failed. The pacing of the film is slow, but the plot is layered, intricate and engrossing. Damon does an admirable job as Edward Wilson, he is as cold and calculating a character as I can ever remember on the screen. A man of very few words even when it comes to his wife and child. Obviously this affects his marriage but the film thankfully does not overbear on this point. For anyone whose read about CIA interrogation tactics, this movie will not shock or surprise you. Overall, a look inside of one of the most secretive organizations in American history should be reason enough for you to see this film, but if it's not then the superb acting and direction of De Niro will nonetheless draw you to see The Good Shepherd.Best Line EVER:Joseph Palmi (as played by Joe Pesci): The Italians we have our families and our kids, the Irish have their homeland, the Jews have their traditions, even the N----rs have their music...what do you people have?Edward Wilson (as played by Matt Damon): We have the United States of America, the rest of you are all visiting.",5,Which Flock Takes Precedence?,1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,1576,"['Good', 'Shepherd', 'fascinating', 'look', 'how', 'counterintelligence', 'unit', 'CIA', 'began', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'priviledged', 'Yale', 'graduate', 'former', 'Skull', 'Bones', 'member', 'who', 'recruited', 'help', 'United', 'States', 'stave', 'off', 'growing', 'threat', 'communism', 'East', 'later', 'South', 'movie', 'centers', 'botched', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'invasion', 'how', 'why', 'mission', 'Cuba', 'failed', 'Much', 'film', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'Wilson', 'trys', 'determine', 'how', 'why', 'mission', 'failed', 'pacing', 'film', 'slow', 'plot', 'layered', 'intricate', 'engrossing', 'Damon', 'admirable', 'job', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'cold', 'calculating', 'character', 'can', 'ever', 'remember', 'screen', 'man', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'even', 'when', 'wife', 'child', 'Obviously', 'marriage', 'film', 'thankfully', 'not', 'overbear', 'point', 'anyone', 'read', 'CIA', 'interrogation', 'tactics', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'shock', 'surprise', 'Overall', 'look', 'one', 'most', 'secretive', 'organizations', 'American', 'history', 'should', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'then', 'superb', 'acting', 'direction', 'De', 'Niro', 'will', 'nonetheless', 'draw', 'see', 'Good', 'Shepherd.Best', 'Line', 'EVER', 'Joseph', 'Palmi', 'played', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Italians', 'have', 'families', 'kids', 'Irish', 'have', 'homeland', 'Jews', 'have', 'traditions', 'even', 'N', 'rs', 'have', 'music', 'what', 'do', 'people', 'have', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'have', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'rest', 'are', 'visiting']",N/A

Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, ""The Good Shepherd"" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot.This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer).

Here we have the Chips, the Chazzes, the Chets, and the Skippers of the Polo-shirt set, along with their clench-jawed, desperate-eyed females whose primary purpose early in life seems to be to engineer mating themselves (love doesn't even enter into the equation) to one of these obnoxious monied frat boys.  Really, with their assortment of silly Masonic-style Olde-Boy's Club rituals--most of which have a distinctly homosexual underpinning--these oh-so-white Americans look exactly like what they are: transplanted 17th-century Englishmen with all the class snobbery, racism, superiority, and pooftery symptomatic of the upper-eschelon Brit.  While this is essentially a soap-opera melodrama with very little action or story-driven impetus, there is nary a well-developed character to be found.  It's a bunch of miserable privileged white people taking three hours to demonstrate their misery...oh, and by the way they hold the Fate of all of us in their clammy whitebread hands.  Yikes.  There are two things that stuck out in this trudge of a movie for me.  One is the way Matt Damon's horn-rimmed-glasses/short haircut character physically put me in mind of Robert MacNamara--which is probably no accident.  The other is what I think is the most resonant line in the movie: when asked by Joe Pesci's aging Italian gangster--currently under threat of deportation by the US back to Italy--what it is that bloodless, cold, anonymous, WASPy types like Matt Damon's character have as a cultural group, Damon's Edward Wilson answers, with chilling lack of emotion, ""We have America.  The rest of you (meaning Jews, Blacks, Italians, etc) are just visiting.""

There's a code of right and wrong here, and Wilson makes choices about what he sees as ""right"".  He marries Angelina Jolie because she is pregnant, but her life is lonely and unfulfilled because he never loves her.  His relationship with his son as well as everyone else has a wide variety of strings attached.  And, in the, end, Robert Wilson learns the price of a life filled with righteous deception.Matt Damon's acting ability is flawless in this film.  He embodies his character completely.  The storyline however, is extremely confusing and I suspect it was by design.  The audience often does not know what is happening or why.  This soon grows tedious to watch however, especially as the film is more than three hours long and it is impossible to be sure of who the bad guys and the good guys are.  As a result, I was bored a lot and even though this is clearly a worthwhile film, there are lots of problems with the fuzzy plot.For many, the appeal of excellent acting and a critique of the CIA's role in America since the 1960s will result in a satisfying film experience.

Not much for Angelina Jolie to do here, except pout her already too-pouty lips - her role was horribly underwritten or, perhaps, better suited for a lesser voluptuous luminary. I got what the writer was trying to say. It just took too long to say it!

I was born and raised in DC back in the old days before the Metro subway system, riding buses all over town, so that bus route kinda bafflee me. Even if the CIA was housed someplace else back then, the 12th & Penn bus has NEVER passed the Jefferson Memorial!

Matt Damon plays a CIA agent, with flashbacks of his life.  Most of the action is set in the 1960's, however, the film hops back and forth in time.  The first flashback is his father's suicide and him hiding the suicide note, taking the blame for accidently killing his father.  He did not want his mother to know his father took his own life.  The movie meanders through his life and loves, with little emotional punch or interest.  After watching about thirty minutes, you realize it is not a thriller, or even very interesting.  The whole movie runs about three hours and is just boring, complicated and amazing that a man can go through life with his mouth shut, yet realizing you cannot ""erase"" mistakes, and mistakes can be big.  Top-rate actors like Damon, DeNiro, Jolie, and many others promise a epic film, but somehow there is no interesing hook.

1052041,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000MXPE7O,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[2, 2]","THE GOOD SHEPHERD depicts the decades long growth of the CIA from its inception as seen through the eyes of a youthful rookie agent Edward Wilson, played by Matt Damon, whose screen character requires him to keep bottled up within him all emotion.  It is his inability to articulate his feelings that form an unexpected subtext.  From the time that we first meet a preteen Edward, who has witnessed the suicide of his father to the close of the film, we see the growth of an agent whose needed silences mark him as a superior operative but ironically require him to pay a personal price that alienates him from his wife and son.  Angelina Jolie is his wife Margaret, who is attracted to Edward from the start and she makes it clear that she wants him as a husband.  Her tragedy is that despite her character's smarts she does not foresee that the wife of an operative must be willing to share him with his job.  She can overlook a fling with a woman but demands what Edward cannot provide, which is meaningful daily contact with a man who is aware of her private needs. What becomes evident soon enough is that even had Edward chosen another profession, his self-imposed silences probably would have led to conflict.THE GOOD SHEPHERD is a film that smacks of a quasi-documentary that depicts a pre-war America that has no effective intelligence department and must develop one to keep pace first with Nazism, then with Soviet communism.  Damon's low-key performance is effective more because of than despite his interpretation of a man who is constantly told to trust no one.  There is a gripping subplot that suggests that someone in his section is a Soviet mole, a premise that reinforces this theme that a lack of trust is the inevitable result of a life that suggests that secrets must be locked up either in one's heart or in one's lockbox safe.  The ending is deliberately lacking in an upbeat closure. The power of THE GOOD SHEPHERD lies in its ability to recreate an era that demanded that those who chose to play the game of intelligence often found that they were not the only ones who had to pay that price.",3,Trust No One,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,2118,"['GOOD', 'SHEPHERD', 'decades', 'long', 'growth', 'CIA', 'inception', 'seen', 'eyes', 'youthful', 'rookie', 'agent', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'screen', 'character', 'keep', 'bottled', 'up', 'emotion', 'inability', 'articulate', 'feelings', 'form', 'unexpected', 'subtext', 'time', 'first', 'meet', 'preteen', 'Edward', 'who', 'witnessed', 'suicide', 'father', 'close', 'film', 'see', 'growth', 'agent', 'needed', 'silences', 'mark', 'superior', 'operative', 'ironically', 'require', 'pay', 'personal', 'price', 'wife', 'son', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'wife', 'Margaret', 'who', 'attracted', 'Edward', 'start', 'clear', 'husband', 'tragedy', 'character', 'smarts', 'not', 'foresee', 'wife', 'operative', 'must', 'be', 'willing', 'share', 'job', 'can', 'overlook', 'fling', 'woman', 'what', 'Edward', 'can', 'not', 'provide', 'meaningful', 'daily', 'contact', 'man', 'who', 'aware', 'private', 'needs', 'What', 'evident', 'soon', 'enough', 'even', 'had', 'Edward', 'chosen', 'profession', 'self-imposed', 'silences', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'conflict.THE', 'GOOD', 'SHEPHERD', 'film', 'smacks', 'quasi-documentary', 'pre-war', 'America', 'effective', 'intelligence', 'department', 'must', 'develop', 'one', 'keep', 'pace', 'first', 'Nazism', 'then', 'Soviet', 'communism', 'Damon', 'low-key', 'performance', 'effective', 'more', 'interpretation', 'man', 'who', 'constantly', 'told', 'trust', 'one', 'gripping', 'subplot', 'someone', 'section', 'Soviet', 'mole', 'premise', 'theme', 'lack', 'trust', 'inevitable', 'result', 'life', 'secrets', 'must', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'either', 'one', 'heart', 'one', 'lockbox', 'safe', 'ending', 'deliberately', 'lacking', 'upbeat', 'closure', 'power', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'SHEPHERD', 'ability', 'recreate', 'era', 'demanded', 'who', 'chose', 'play', 'game', 'intelligence', 'often', 'found', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'had', 'pay', 'price']",N/A

But I'm just not willing to invest 9 hours on this. I'm sorry I wasted the 3. I watched it with my girlfriend and we kept asking each other ""Do you understand what's going on""?, ""Who's this person""?, ""what year are we in""?I have other issues with this movie other than the convoluted story. The whole movie is filmed very, VERY, dark! It's like you're watching it with sunglasses on. There's one part in the movie when they get a russian spy to cross to their side, and they pretty much just take him at his word and consider him one of them. Later on in the movie another russian claims to be the same guy and wants to cross and says that the other Russian is a mole. Instead of taking this guy at his word, they torture him for several hours and when he sticks to his story they give him LSD as a truth serum and not only does he STILL stick to his story but he jumps out the window killing himself. All this gives the agents NO reason to believe that the guy they're trusting MIGHT actually be the mole!!! They don't torture him, they don't even question him. They just go on believing him. And guess what. He turns out to be the mole. Matt Damon finds this out by noticing a feather coming out of a book that one of his spy friends gave the mole. He then peels back the inside cover of the book reveiling a passport and other incriminating evidence. I mean this is truly stupid and really made the whole movie stupid. If you're going to make a movie this confusing it better at least be good and make sense and this movie does not. And why is Joe Pessci in this movie???

The movie is set against a variety of important events in U.S. history, which makes the whole government/political aspect of the film very detailed and accurate. However, there's no spark on the emotional side of things. Damon delivers a strong performance as much as the script allows, but his character is a hollow shell of a man who lacks any emotion or feeling, and therefore makes it virtually impossible for the audience to sympathize for him in any way. This movie is almost three hours long, which seems like a lifetime when you haven't developed any sort of attachment to the main character. The supporting cast of the film is very impressive and includes the likes of Angelina Jolie, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (who also directed the film).

Every morning he leaves his middle class home in the suburbs and along with his neighbors boards a bus for downtown D.C. But unlike his neighbors, who presumably work as office functionaries, Wilson is a top, experienced, ""higher-up"" for the C.I.A. and though, on the surface dressed exactly like his neighbors in felt fedora and Sears trench coats, Wilson is headed for the monolith that is the C.I.A. headquarters.As written by Eric Roth and directed by Robert De Niro (De Niro's only other directing job was ""A Bronx Tale""), ""The Good Shepherd"" traces the genesis of the C.I.A. as it evolves from the World War II O.S.S. and central to this terrific, fascinating, intelligently written and passionately directed movie is the story of Wilson himself and the ultimate tragedy of his life: a life that begins to unravel the moment he agrees to become a spy right out of college.Wilson, as portrayed by Matt Damon is the perfect spy if there is such a thing: he is without humor, looks like a thousand other men, dresses like a small town banker and is passionate about only two things: his son and his miniature ship in a bottle hobby. And anytime he strays from these two things, as in women or sex, he fails miserably.The world of Espionage is a dirty business, one that defies and twists the basic notions of truth, loyalty and pride. For Wilson there is almost no room for anything else: upon marrying he leaves his pregnant girlfriend, Clover(Angelina Jolie) for six years to serve in Europe without thinking about it twice.  His life is his work and his work ultimately ruins his life by chipping away at the basic goodness and humanity that infuses his core self.

The movie purports to be a fictionalized account of the early days of the CIA and its World War II predecessor, the OSS.

Does it step up to the level of The Godfather as a classic movie?  Robert DeNiro directs and stars, Matt Damon, Angelin Jolie, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt and the list of supportng castmates goes on.  At two hours and forty-eight minutes it's definitely got epic written all over it.  Well...I look at good long movies like this: if I start to squirm in my seat, it's too long for it's own good.  If I don't even notice the extended length, it's a damn good.I squirmed.Sorry.The Good Shepherd is the story of Edward Wilson, a Yale graduate and all around good guy who happens to belong the the Skull & Bones Society. Neat little upper class cult that it is,  like Frat Boys meets The Illuminati.  Creepy.  Edward witnessed his father's suicide at the age of six and actualy stole the suicide note before anyone got there.  He confesses this while lying naked in a sarcophigi surrounded by his hooded, black-cloaked Skull & Bones brethren. Okay...  Hitler is rising in Europe and even though America is still firmly out of the conflict, the OSS decides it's time to start doing things to keep the U.S. in the game without being directly involved.  The CIA is born.  Counterintelligence.  Spies.  Networks.  The whole nine yards and Edward Wilson is right there from the beginning, traveling to Europe for six years, leaving behid a wife (Jolie) he barely knows and a son yet-to-be-born.The human side of The Good Shepherd is interesting.  Edward fel in love with a deaf girl named Laura and had planned to be with her always, but during a little Skull & Bones reunion, he is taken into the woods by a Senator' daughter and seduced.  She gets pregnant.  He marries her.  So long Laura.  Damn.  We see the rise and fall of Edward Wilson not only as a spy, a counterintelligence agent for the newly spawned CIA, but as a human being.  His morales are tested. His allegiance, too.  His trust in others is absolutely extinguished.  He winds up having hs son's pegnant fiance thrown from an airplane on her way to their wedding because she was working for the KGB.  Nice.Overall, The Good Shepherd is a good movie sharing time between the year leading up to WWII and the faled CIA-sponsored rebellion against Cuba's Castro at the beginning of The Cold War.  De Niro directs masterfully and the cast is well-rounded.  But...I still squirmed and that means that something was lacking.  When you bring up a movie like The Godfather and then compare it, no matter how casually, there is bound to be problems. The Good Shepherd had too many slow spots where a good editing by De Niro might have made it better.  Still a good movie.  I would definitely watch it again, but not too soon.  It may take a while to digest it, perhaps nurtue a fondness for it. Could you spend your money more wisely?  Maybe.  But there aren't too many flick coimng out of this caliber, however, so make your choice.

Robert De Niro's ""pet project"" and first directorial effort since A Bronx Tale, the Good Shepherd follows the life of the brilliant Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) and the beginnings and origins of the CIA.  Throughout the film, we witness the career triumps of Wilson as well as his personal failures that haunt him throughout the years.  The multi-layered, fact based script justifies the nearly three hour running time, but the overall effect of the Good Shepherd just doesn't perform nearly as well as it should.  Damon is wooden to say the least, while Angelina Jolie's talent is wasted as Wilson's long suffering wife.  There are notable supporting actors as well, including De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, John Turturro, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Billy Crudup, Michael Gambon, 2001's Keir Dullea, and the great Joe Pesci (making his first screen appearance in almost a decade), but none of them are around long enough to make much impact.  Not to mention that the deliberately slow pacing of the film can really be difficult to sit through, and while the Good Shepherd isn't a bad film one bit, it is a disappointment nonetheless.

1052055,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B000MXPE7O,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[11, 14]","_The Good Shepherd_ is a paranoid's delight, detailing the rise of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as it initially developed following World War II.  Directed by Robert DeNiro (who also has a role in the film as a general who played a key part in creating the CIA), this film shows us a rare glimpse into the world of spies and counter-spies, paranoia, and secrecy that surrounds the cult of intelligence.  Much of the film is indeed an accurate portrayal of the history of said agency and its role in America's foreign policy decision making throughout much of the Twentieth Century.  The film follows the career of Edward Wilson (played by Matt Damon) from his early years as a poetry student at Yale University, periodically spying on his professors who allegedly were linked to Nazi-sympathetic organizations, to his role in the development of the Allied intelligence community during World War II, to the creation of the CIA and the birth of the Cold War and beyond.  The film is one of epic proportions (some have compared it to other classics such as _The Godfather_) and is essential viewing for all thinking people.  In the world of undercover operations, no one is to be trusted.  Whether or not a certain individual is in fact working for Allied intelligence, the Nazis, or later the Soviets simply cannot be determined, and we witness this world develop as the sense of trust breaks down and paranoia ensues.  The movie travels back and forth between the events that gave rise to the Bay of Pigs fiasco (also hinting at the later Kennedy assassination - believed by some conspiracy theorists to have been the work of the CIA) and the earlier career of Wilson.  At Yale University, Wilson joins up with the class of upper crust WASPs (the ""Old Americans"") and takes part in their adolescent rituals as part of the ultra-secretive Skull and Bones fraternity.  (Many of our political leaders have arisen from this fraternity and some have conjectured that they are responsible for wielding the true power in the world.  The movie even hints at the idea that they may have been responsible for ""Soviet power"" as well, as the true puppet masters behind world events.)  Wilson falls in love with a deaf girl (he has a certain ""weakness"" for deaf girls as we are to see later in the movie); however, a brief affair of his with an upper class girl leads to an unplanned pregnancy and thus forces him to marry.  (However, it should be pointed out that one gets the impression that the ""elites"" are manipulating the whole thing from behind the scenes anyway, because throughout the movie never once is definitive proof provided that the child is even his.  Furthermore, he is to go away for a long time to aid the Allied war effort and thus is not even there to see his newborn son.)  From his early days of spying on university professors (or are they really?), Wilson becomes more and more involved in the intelligence community.  This leads him to serve on the side of the Allies during World War II.  Following World War II, the Allied leaders make a trade of Nazi scientists for Jewish scientists, and thus begins the Cold War as the Soviet power and America and Britain contend for control of the world.  Eventually a series of events will force Wilson to make the ultimate sacrifice - one of many in his desire to further the aims of American imperialism and consolidate the power of the CIA.  The movie also shows and hints at such historical realities as the presence of homosexuals in the intelligence community (and the fact of their homosexuality being used to blackmail them - the rites of the Skull and Bones fraternity could also be described as vaguely homoerotic for that matter!) and the CIA's experiments with drugs (in particular LSD).  There are some rather chilling lines and uncanny prophecies in this movie which haunted me for days following my viewing of it.  At one point Robert DeNiro's character remarks that it was the ""clerks and civil servants"" who gave Hitler his power, and thus it will be necessary to somehow limit the CIA's power because otherwise it runs the risk of creating a totalitarian surveillance state.  Secondly, at one point in the movie Matt Damon's character (Wilson) is asked by Joe Pesci (playing an Italian mobster) what ""his people"" (presumably the upper crust WASPs) have, mentioning that the Italians have the church, Jews have their tradition, and blacks have their music.  To this, Damon replies that they have the United States of America and that the rest are just visitors here.  At another point, it is said that the people from the CIA never put a ""the"" in front of CIA.  When asked why, they reply that putting a ""the"" in front of CIA would be like putting a ""the"" in front of God.  (Angelina Jolie's character remarks on several occassions that during the dinners of the Skull and Bones fraternity they first account for all members of the Bonesmen and then invoke God.  As she puts it, ""Agency first, God second."")  These are some of the chilling lines from the movie.  Ultimately the movie raises some very disturbing questions about the nature of government.  As America heads further and further towards a surveillance state (brought further in that direction with each impending war), it becomes necessary to examine where we have come from.  As is asked in the movie, do the elite controllers who make and break world events try to keep war to a minimum, or do they merely use war to further their own agendas and consolidate their power?  Certainly a scary question to ponder.  I feel that this movie offers much to think about (and ultimately is very frightening!), but so long as the tough questions remain unasked and people remain asleep at the wheel, it will be that much easier for those in power to slide us off into totalitarianism.  Finally, I should say that I find it odd that this movie (which not only offers much food for thought but is genuinely very well put together) has gathered such low reviews.  Perhaps it is just a further indication of the fact that the public does not like to think and ask questions and this is scary in and of itself.",5,"You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set

1052056,A1129LM24YWSZV,B000MXPE7O,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[1, 1]","I loved this movie. Parts of it were difficult to watch, but it is a highly interesting, engaging film.The movie tells the story of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), an idealistic young poetry student at Yale. The son of a high-ranking federal judge, Wilson is tapped to become a member of the elite Skull and Bones society. After accepting, he is drawn further into a world where the expectations of others will govern his decisions. After a passionate roll in the hay with Clover (Angelina Jolie) at a Skull and Bones retreat, Edward learns she is pregnant. Though he is in love with another woman (the hearing-impaired Laura, played beautifully by Tammy Blanchard), Edward weds Clover.The film is set at the end of World War II, when the OSS/CIA were operating/forming. Due to the strong connections of previous members (many of whom went on to work in the military and in government), several young men in the Skull and Bones society are chosen to work in intelligence and counterintelligence. Edward begins work, and the audience watches as he sacrifices one thing after another for his career. Protecting the United States is a noble calling, true, but Edward pays a high price for his devotion. He doesn't even see his son until the boy is more than five years old because of his overseas work. His relationship with his wife, what little there was of it to begin with, deteriorates due to neglect. He can't trust anyone, and so he doesn't.What's fascinating about this film for me is that it isn't all flash and dazzle, like other spy films you may have seen. This film shows the slow, quiet work of the CIA. It shows the strategy behind the organization and what kind of power it wields. It also shows the birth of intelligence gathering in the United States, and it is pretty darn intriguing to go poking into some of those corners of U.S. history. More than anything, though, it illustrates what working in the intelligence industry does to the individuals who commit to it. (And it ain't pretty.)I think Damon plays a role different from his ""type"" in this film. Edward has such a character arc. He starts the film with a wonderful, tender relationship with Laura. Though he never seems to be jolly, he is an earnest boy who is not without humor. But by the end of the film, Edward is so careful. He is so silent. He is damaged. Damon expertly paints Edward in all the tones of the things he does not say. This performance is a precise study in minimalism.Angelina Jolie has some aching moments as Clover, as well. Being married to a ghost takes an enormous toll on Clover, and I have rarely seen Jolie play a character with such frailty. It was quite touching.The films also boasts fine performances by Robert DeNiro (who also directed), William Hurt, Billy Crudup, and Alec Bladwin. I found this movie riveting, with both character and plot to spare. Acting is fabulous, and the subject matter couldn't get much jucier.

Also, Damon seemed (in my humble opinion) to be miscast for the role of Edward Wilson.  He simply looked too young to be believable as a middle-aged man with a twenty-something son, and the birth-control glasses and fedora weren't able to compensate adequately.As to the story itself, I saw it as tracing not only the birth of the CIA, but the dehumanization of Edward Wilson, which culminated in the closing scene with the revelation of his father's secret.  As a spy drama, it is predictably full of intrigue, deception and betrayal.  Wilson is told over and over by other spies that he can trust no one, yet ultimately it is a lesson he must learn through hard experience.  All the while, the viewer watches with a vague sympathy as Wilson's life slips further and further away, as he is dragged ever deeper into the dark web of Cold War espionage.  Yet he is a willing captive.Damon's role was at once central yet maddeningly flat, with relatively little dialogue and a lot of silent, intense staring.  The storyline bounced back and forth between the main tale of exposing a mole who leaked the plans for the Bay of Pigs operation, and tracing Wilson's biography as a college student turned OSS operative in WW2, and later CIA counterintelligence officer.  One must read the subtitles at the beginning of each scene to keep track of the chronology, but even with that aid it can be very difficult to track this subtle and often highly nuanced narrative.  An example is the meeting between Wilson and Modin regarding Edward Jr.'s fiance.  One must read carefully between the lines of their dialogue to appreciate the subsequent scenes involving the young lady's ""mishap.""In short, this movie is worth seeing once -- maybe twice if you really want to be able to understand better some of the more subtle plot twists.  However, I found it to be too long, a bit dry, and not especially entertaining.

Although realizing that it was a subdued and cerebral film, most who have watched it did not 'get' what the film was all about.  Let's take another look at what is a slightly flawed but essentially brilliant movie that might just be worth your money and time after all!What this film is not:  This film is not an espionage thriller.  This film is not a history of the CIA--that's the backdrop.What this film is:  The personality study and life history of one of the CIA's earliest employees, Edward Wilson (a fictitious character, played by Matt Damon, who shows surprising acting depth in the understated but intense character).  The film serially develops Wilson's web of loyalties and relationships, with the Yale professor he admires, with his wife (Angelina Jolie, miscast rather badly in one of the films few flaws), with Skull and Bones, and with his son.  He also has complex loyalties with a KGB rival and a defector.  Plus, there are CIA Founder Wild Bill Donovan (well-done by actor-director deNiro), Damon's supervisor (William Hurt) and his FBI liaison (Alec Baldwin).Each and every one of these institutions or characters comes forth at some point to test Damon's loyalties.  Will he compromise his country for an engaging KGB man who wants to do him ""a very great favor?""  Will he put his love of family above his love of country?  Which comes first, Loyalty to Skull and Bonesmen or the Agency?  His boss or his integrity?Joe Pesce, in a cameo as a retired mob boss, tells Damon ""We Italians, we have our food, our families, our church; what do YOU have?""Damon's reply tells the viewer why the film is titled as it is:  ""I have the United States of America.""Watch carefully for the nuances of the gift shop scene with the KGB and you will unravel the last mysrey of a long, subtle, film that gets more engaging as it goes along.If the above sounds good, maybe this IS the film for you to buy and watch a few times to pull out the enjoyable nuances and delightfully light directorial touches.",4,The Critics Didn't 'Get It' on this one,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,2108,"['product', 'review', 'shows', 'crtiics', 'indeed', 'most', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', ""'get"", 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'realizing', 'was', 'subdued', 'cerebral', 'film', 'most', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'did', 'not', ""'get"", 'what', 'film', 'was', 'Let', 'take', 'look', 'what', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'essentially', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'worth', 'money', 'time', 'What', 'film', 'not', 'film', 'not', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'film', 'not', 'history', 'CIA', 'backdrop.What', 'film', 'personality', 'study', 'life', 'history', 'one', 'CIA', 'earliest', 'employees', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'fictitious', 'character', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'surprising', 'acting', 'depth', 'understated', 'intense', 'character', 'film', 'serially', 'Wilson', 'web', 'loyalties', 'relationships', 'Yale', 'professor', 'wife', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'miscast', 'rather', 'badly', 'one', 'films', 'few', 'flaws', 'Skull', 'Bones', 'son', 'also', 'complex', 'loyalties', 'KGB', 'rival', 'defector', 'are', 'CIA', 'Founder', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Donovan', 'well-done', 'actor-director', 'deNiro', 'Damon', 'supervisor', 'William', 'Hurt', 'FBI', 'liaison', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', '.Each', 'one', 'institutions', 'characters', 'forth', 'point', 'test', 'Damon', 'loyalties', 'Will', 'compromise', 'country', 'engaging', 'KGB', 'man', 'who', 'do', 'very', 'great', 'favor', 'Will', 'put', 'love', 'family', 'love', 'country', 'Which', 'first', 'Loyalty', 'Skull', 'Bonesmen', 'Agency', 'boss', 'integrity', 'Joe', 'Pesce', 'cameo', 'retired', 'mob', 'boss', 'Damon', 'Italians', 'have', 'food', 'families', 'church', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'Damon', 'reply', 'viewer', 'why', 'film', 'titled', 'have', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'Watch', 'carefully', 'nuances', 'gift', 'shop', 'scene', 'KGB', 'will', 'unravel', 'last', 'mysrey', 'long', 'subtle', 'film', 'more', 'engaging', 'above', 'sounds', 'good', 'maybe', 'film', 'buy', 'watch', 'few', 'times', 'pull', 'out', 'enjoyable', 'nuances', 'delightfully', 'light', 'directorial', 'touches']",N/A

A little more objectivity and a much better film might have emerged.The spy game and its corroding effects on the human psyche are much better told by LeCarre.  Still it's a good theme and worth exploring.  There's just too much crammed in here and as much as I cared to follow the intricacies of the plot after while I lost interest.  I think DeNiro had to chose which of the two plots to focus on - the spy plot or the human drama; he tried for too much and as a result people just get tired of watching and lose interest.The cast is stellar and they all do heroic jobs.  I usually love Matt Damon and I don't fault him for the less-than-fascinating performance.  He was undoubtably told to play ""cold"" and ""emotionally detached"" and he gave us that for two hours and forty some minutes.  I think that the development, or devolution of his character would have been much more interesting if we had seen more of the younger, livelier man, who gradually hardened into stone.  The most interesting parts of the film were his brief love scenes with the two hearing impaired women.Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job but I think she was miscast.

1052066,A2UIXU97JYCPZG,B000MXPE7O,R. Albin,"[1, 1]","This film is a not very successful attempt at combining a Cold War spy thriller with psychological realism.  A loosely fictionalized account of events in the history of the CIA and based probably on the life of James Angleton, the long time and controversial head of CIA counter-intelligence.  The Bay of Pigs fiasco, the CIA sponsored coup against the Arbenz regime in Guatemala, and the Kim Philby disaster are among the events used in the plot.  The movie shows the genesis of the CIA in the WWII OSS and its staffing from the heart of the American establishment with the role of the Yale secret society Skull and Bones featured prominently.  These episodes are fairly well done but not sufficiently well to give this film a truly historic quality.As a thriller, this film is a failure.  It is not particularly suspenseful, partly because the outcome of events is clearly known.  The characters, however, are not engaging enough to elicit sympathy.  Matt Damon's performance might be described as wooden, though the script doesn't give him much to work with.  The film's attempts at giving the Damon character some psychological depth through events of his childhood is a bit too pat to be convincing.A key plot device is a piece of audiotape that gives clues to the betrayal of the Bay of Pigs invasion.  This unclear tape reveals information that is unexpected by and provokes a crisis for the Damon character.  Movie-goers with good memories will recognize this as the key plot device of Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, a very good film made about 30 years ago.

And Yes, it is quite slowly paced.The plot is really a re-do of John LeCarre's ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"". It deals with the transformation of the OSS to the CIA. Like George Smiley in ""Tinker, Tailor"", there is a Commie mole, and the deep-thinking but stoic, silent, Wilson goes back and forth in history trying to determine who, what happened and how.Director DeNiro does NOT tell the viewer what is going on in Wilson's (Matt Damon) head. You need to figure that out, so viewers looking for a James Bond spy story with action and car chases will be disappointed. While fiction, some characters are based in fact, the Matt Damon character is a lot like James Jesus Angleton and the DeNiro, himself, plays the military guy who sets him up, Wild Bill Donovan, real people.Secretive and clever Edmund Wilson goes from the upper class to Yale to the OSS in WWII, to the Director of Ops, the CIA master of disinformation, trying to confuse the communists for US strategic advantages. In the end he becomes emotionally frozen, can trust no one and he come to realize he has been betrayed over and over again, by everyone he trusts.DeNiro talked a great deal with his mentor Martin Scorcese while making this movie.Go see or buy this very subtle movie which is open to much potential interpretation. Both spycraft and the paranoia inherent in working for the CIA are portrayed very accurately here, for a change. I could swear parts of this are actually shot at Langley, even inside. Highly recommended. This movie should have been a nominee for Best Picture of the Year & Best Actor.The real Wild Bill Donovan once said, ""Espionage is not a nice thing, nor are the methods employed exemplary. Neither are demolition bombs nor poison gas... ...We face an enemy who believes one of his chief weapons is that none but he will employ terror. But we will turn terror against him...""***Plot spoiler hint****don't read this til after you see the movie.

I have not seen a character like this since John Le Carre's agent Smiley.  Edward is a quiet man, who keeps his emotions and feelings to himself. He is also damaged, since as a child, he witnessed his father's suicide.  The emotional void of having a father figure in his life, pushes him towards seemingly caring man such as his mentor at the university and eventually towards career in CIA.  Edward is pushed into a marriage to a woman (played by Angelina Jolie) he barely knows and the marriage is doomed from the start.  Their son, the bond that keeps the marriage together is also a reminder to both of them of their poor match.  As we trace Edward's career thru some of the important events of the cold war, we learn about him as a father, husband, lover and the unscrupulous secret agent.  It is difficult to imagine that sensitive young man, interested in poetry and above all loyal to the people close to him would resort to the dread of a life of a spymaster full of secrets and lies.  But then, as the film reaches its conclusion we almost get to think of him as a an on the suicide mission of his own.

This is not to say the film isn't worthy; it IS...on many levels. Matt Damon really is one of our current best actors, and he commands attention. The confusing time-shifts weren't helpful; don't know if that was a problem of director de Niro or the editor or writer. There's a terrifc cast, though Jolie was sorely miscast. Alec Baldwin & Damon had some good banter, as they did in ""The Departed"". I could watch a film with only those two, and be more entertained than all of ""The Good Shepherd"". The historical accuracy of this telling of the founding of the CIA is questionable, and putting it in the same league as Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"", or Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"" cannot allow me to put this on my list of favorites.

I saw an exaggerated tale of what many men close to power, whether in the business or political worlds, go through to achieve their business ends.

These men enter a cerebral world where they have to live by something not taught at Yale -- their wits -- to survive.These men (and some women) are all around us.  There are decisions made thousands of times a day to put business or political objectives before family and friends, though not always with the dramatic alienation that this movie depicts.

In fact, as a former spy who spent three touirs overseas including one chasing terrorists, this movie, while artsy and compelling in its mash-up of 50 years of mis-adventure, is very disappointing.  They would have been better off sticking to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which I enjoyed very much as a parody.Until the 1980's, the chief characteristics of the Directorate of Operations of which I was a part, were alcoholism, adultery, divorce, and suicide.  I count 18 suicides in my professional career, beginning with the instructor at the Farm that blew his brains out with a shot-gun, and more recently the Staff Director of the House Permanent Select Committee of Intelligence, and a much admired SES (flag) officer who tried to drum the ""Langley Strangler"" out of the agency.  Now that's a movie I would be glad to help make.  Today we simply have too many puppies and dilitantes.There is one good aspect: the whole concept of not trusting anyone.  There is another good aspect: enemy opposites can be friends.  Indeed, I have found over the years that I like and trust my KGB and GRU counterparts more than I trust the drones in our own FBI (Agents IC Smith and Crowley excepted).A sideline highlight was the depiction of the Yale fraternity Skull and Bones, to which both George Bush Junior and John Kerry belong.  The overtones of homosexuality, men mud-wrestling naked, men in drag, is consistent with the public information undertones about some of its members.The bad aspect is that this movie tries to represent 50 years of history including all the apects of James Angleton, Kim Philby, and so on, but it is a fantasy, a poor parody.  You would be much better off reading my lists of intelligence and counterintelligence books.  Recruiting people to be traitors, stealing diplomatic pouches, installing audio devices, managing covert action operations are all more interesting.The entire theme of trying to interpret a video to identify the fan, the sounds, the voices, etc is over-hyped garbage, even with the revelation that the witness knows the video is of himself not so long ago.  CIA throws money in the air, and whoever reaches for it is recruited as an agent.  Let me be very specific: CIA is a global laughingstock, and does nothing for the Nation that is worth its cost.  It consists of too many young white males, and no amount of diversity hiring is going to change the basic fact that working out of official installations, and unilaterally (or worse, relying on foreign liaison headquarters for second-hand lies) is going to turn CIA into a mature clandestine and analytic service.The coldness of the business, and the distance between father and son, between husband and wife, is dated.  That is how it was up to the 1970's.  After that, wives were a part of the team and not only fully briefed, but used operationally on occasikon.  Children generally are briefed when they reach their low teens.Bottom line: this is a melange that melanges a bit too much.  Great stars, interesting script, for a real look at the old CIA, see Allen Dulles, ""The Craft of Intelligence"", and Miles Copeland, ""Without Cloak or Dagger"".  For the lies and politicization, see George Allen, ""None So Blind"" or Hiam's ""Who the Hell are we Fighting.""  For CIA at the top of its game, see ""JAWBREAKER"" and ""First In.""This is one instance where books are much better than any DVD.

1052075,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000MXPE7O,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 3]","This is one of those films about which people feel very strongly, positive or negative:  it does not fit into an easy category (e.g. Bond-like action), has extraordinary nuance that speaks to very specific interests (bureaucratic power, the private life of spies, civilian control over dirty tricks, elite secret societies), and has wonderfully understated acting that hides what is going on underneath more than acts it out.  If it isn't for everyone, I found it utterly fascinating and engaging all the way through.The plot revolves around a group initiated into Yale's Skull & Bones club, the elite of the elite who gain connections that will benefit them for the rest of their lives after they are ""chosen"" and submit to bizarre rituals.  In the mid-1930s, they were white, from privileged WASP families from the NE, and naively patriotic (e.g. George HW Bush).  While fitting in, Damon's character has subtle problems:  son of a suicide who was apparently corrupt and perhaps even a traitor, deeply troubled in his relationships, and deeply secretive to protect his innermost feelings.  Taken into the OSS and married after an almost accidental sexual encounter, he grows into a master spy at the moment that his Skull & Bones ""brothers"" are founding the CIA.  He becomes one of their early top officials.The viewer enters into the spy's world view, not as dashing swashbucklers, but as the ultimate manipulators of events and opinions from bureaucratic perches in depressingly plain offices.  Their mission is to protect American security, but their activities define their purview in a far wider way than merely military.  Even the architect behind it (de Niro) has misgivings, which the younger ""brothers"" apparently do not.  In many ways, they begin to be corrupted by their power, which they love yet are not overt about it.  It is a wonderful study of how a professional bureaucracy evolves into ever new areas.  The violence, which underpins everything they are managing, makes only a few brief appearances, which are frighteningly realistic, subdued yet sudden.  Trusting no one, through Damon you see how it impacts their private lives.The Damon character, who had great potential to grow in a very different direction, becomes completely consumed by his duty and subtle lust for power as he masses evidence on his own colleagues as well.  His wife, a great beauty from a Skull & Bones family (Jolie in an unusually subtle role that matches her talents), suffers terribly from his mission-driven egotism, as does his son; they live with constant fear and dread.  In a way, he self-destructs, but at the same time he is an extraordinary achiever and, in my view, a completely believable psychological profile:  he was working to please an absent parent, was driven by his sense of class and purpose, and had extreme talent.  But all of this is revealed in ways that must be interpreted, a layer below his gloomy, dutiful surface, which is great fun if you like to let characters like this enter your imagination.The plot is also wonderfully complex, if somewhat confusing with all the skips in time.  It is based around the failure of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  A seeming friend, his Soviet counterpart is seeking ways to undermine and co-opt him:  his efforts are yet another way that complicates the Damon character's life, with terrible consequences that once again are not completely spelled out.  Did he follow the route of his father?  Somewhat less?  Can you become partially corrupt?  Or did he betray the last things he held dear for the sake of his career and integrity?  There are no clear answers to these questions, but if the film has spoken to you, you formulate your own answers.  This is filmmaking, in my view, at its absolute best.Recommended as a masterpiece.  All the details are as delicious as they are deliberate.

Similar to last year's ""Syriana"", ""The Good Shepard"" explores the nature and history of the C.I.A. by weaving together multiple storylines, characters, and continents across several decades, to confounding effect.Taking place between World War II and the Bay of Pigs invasion, the movie follows Edward Wilson (Damon) a bright Yale graduate who becomes involved with in the web of secrecy that ultimately becomes the C.I.A. A member of ""Skull and Bones"", the university's secret society, early in the movie Edward is approached by the F.B.I. to spy on his Nazi-sympathizing teacher. Taking up the offer, Edward begins doing missions for the O.S.S., eventually leading to working in London for the K.G.B. Eventually Edward rises amongst the ranks and is selected to participate in the C.I.A., a newly established U.S. government organization. During this time, Edward gets married to a woman he impregnated, and has a son and wife who he never sees.As he travels through the US, Europe, and eventually Africa, Edward works with people he at one time were told were his enemies, he turns on his friends and co-workers when he feels their allegiances slip, and true to the warning he was given by many, he learns can never trust anyone. This is all an excellent idea; seeing the life-consuming power of lies, deception, and espionage through the eyes of one man. In realty, however, the movie moves around too much, trying to cover all the bases, all the while wearing out the viewer into simply not caring anymore.When we first meet Edward, it is the 1960's, and he is reviewing a ""top secret"" case file while a crack team interprets a black and white photo and audio recording to discover where they came from. Just as our interest is peaked with these events, we flash back to the late 30's, and Edward is mud wrestling while he is peed on as initiation into his school's secret society. Lying nude, he is accepted into their club by a masked black-cloaked figure. Again, just as the audience shifts gears and becomes wrapped up in a much different, but equally as intriguing story, we travel back further, to the mid 20's, when Edward is a boy witnessing his father's suicide. From here we go back to Yale, and his poetry teacher, who seems to be a mentor to Edward, is enticing him to stay in his study for more than just schoolwork. While all of these stories are very interesting on their own, as a collection of 7 to 12 minute accounts, strung together solely because they happened to the same man, they make for a very tedious nearly 3-hour-long movie.Early on, Edward falls in love with a deaf woman, but must marry another who he had a foolish encounter with. Years later, towards the end of the movie he sleeps with his secretary; a deaf woman. While it may seem that Edward saw this woman as an outlet for his desires of his lost love of youth, this idea is never developed. When his son, who Edward seems to have only spent a few months of his life with, joins the same elite secret club as Edward had done, the 15 or 20 minutes of time spent here are not enough to develop anything remarkable. Ultimately, the back-and-forth time frame and lack of clear focus made for a very all-over-the-place experience.Many characters Edward encountered throughout his life repeated a warning: you would never be able to trust anyone. Friends he made at Yale became enemies later in life, mentors and father figures betrayed him or Edward betrayed them. It would seem the disorientation and not knowing what happened when or with whom may have been a part of DeNiro's vision. However, instead of getting the feeling I was a C.I.A. operative getting fed bits of intelligence, I began to care less and less about the tiny tidbits, and just wanted my operation to be all over with and done.The performances, though great all around, and the locales and shots, though pitch-perfect in mood, made for some excellently-crafted 5 to 20 minute short movies, but as a whole, did not add up to much at all.",3,The Good Shepard,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,4173,"['Lack', 'focus', 'leads', 'lack', 'concern', 'story', 'charactersDecember', '19', '2006', 'Good', 'Shepard', 'may', 'be', 'lot', 'different', 'things', 'none', 'hold', 'together', 'whole', 'Similar', 'last', 'year', 'Syriana', 'Good', 'Shepard', 'nature', 'history', 'C.I.A', 'weaving', 'together', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'characters', 'continents', 'several', 'decades', 'confounding', 'effect.Taking', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'invasion', 'movie', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'Damon', 'bright', 'Yale', 'graduate', 'who', 'involved', 'web', 'secrecy', 'ultimately', 'C.I.A', 'member', 'Skull', 'Bones', 'university', 'secret', 'society', 'early', 'movie', 'Edward', 'approached', 'F.B.I', 'spy', 'Nazi-sympathizing', 'teacher', 'Taking', 'up', 'offer', 'Edward', 'doing', 'missions', 'O.S.S.', 'eventually', 'leading', 'working', 'London', 'K.G.B', 'Eventually', 'Edward', 'amongst', 'ranks', 'selected', 'participate', 'C.I.A.', 'newly', 'established', 'U.S.', 'government', 'organization', 'time', 'Edward', 'married', 'woman', 'impregnated', 'son', 'wife', 'who', 'never', 'sees.As', 'US', 'Europe', 'eventually', 'Africa', 'Edward', 'people', 'one', 'time', 'were', 'told', 'were', 'enemies', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'when', 'allegiances', 'slip', 'true', 'warning', 'was', 'given', 'many', 'can', 'never', 'trust', 'anyone', 'excellent', 'idea', 'seeing', 'life-consuming', 'power', 'lies', 'deception', 'espionage', 'eyes', 'one', 'man', 'realty', 'however', 'movie', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'trying', 'cover', 'bases', 'while', 'wearing', 'out', 'viewer', 'simply', 'not', 'caring', 'first', 'meet', 'Edward', '1960', 'reviewing', 'top', 'secret', 'case', 'file', 'crack', 'team', 'black', 'white', 'photo', 'audio', 'recording', 'discover', 'where', 'came', 'Just', 'interest', 'peaked', 'events', 'flash', 'back', 'late', '30', 'Edward', 'mud', 'wrestling', 'peed', 'initiation', 'school', 'secret', 'society', 'Lying', 'nude', 'accepted', 'club', 'masked', 'black-cloaked', 'figure', 'Again', 'just', 'audience', 'shifts', 'gears', 'becomes', 'wrapped', 'up', 'much', 'different', 'equally', 'intriguing', 'story', 'travel', 'back', 'further', 'mid', '20', 'when', 'Edward', 'boy', 'witnessing', 'father', 'suicide', 'here', 'go', 'back', 'Yale', 'poetry', 'teacher', 'who', 'be', 'mentor', 'Edward', 'enticing', 'stay', 'study', 'more', 'just', 'schoolwork', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'own', 'collection', '7', '12', 'minute', 'accounts', 'strung', 'together', 'solely', 'happened', 'same', 'man', 'make', 'very', 'tedious', 'nearly', '3-hour-long', 'movie.Early', 'Edward', 'love', 'deaf', 'woman', 'must', 'marry', 'who', 'had', 'foolish', 'encounter', 'Years', 'later', 'end', 'movie', 'secretary', 'deaf', 'woman', 'may', 'seem', 'Edward', 'saw', 'woman', 'outlet', 'desires', 'lost', 'love', 'youth', 'idea', 'never', 'developed', 'When', 'son', 'who', 'Edward', 'have', 'only', 'spent', 'few', 'months', 'life', 'same', 'elite', 'secret', 'club', 'Edward', 'had', 'done', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'time', 'spent', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'develop', 'anything', 'remarkable', 'Ultimately', 'back-and-forth', 'time', 'frame', 'lack', 'clear', 'focus', 'made', 'very', 'all-over-the-place', 'experience.Many', 'characters', 'Edward', 'encountered', 'life', 'repeated', 'warning', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'trust', 'anyone', 'Friends', 'made', 'Yale', 'became', 'enemies', 'later', 'life', 'mentors', 'father', 'figures', 'betrayed', 'Edward', 'betrayed', 'would', 'seem', 'disorientation', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'whom', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'DeNiro', 'vision', 'However', 'instead', 'getting', 'feeling', 'was', 'C.I.A', 'operative', 'getting', 'fed', 'bits', 'intelligence', 'began', 'care', 'less', 'less', 'tiny', 'tidbits', 'just', 'wanted', 'operation', 'be', 'done.The', 'performances', 'great', 'around', 'locales', 'shots', 'pitch-perfect', 'mood', 'made', 'excellently-crafted', '5', '20', 'minute', 'short', 'movies', 'whole', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'much']",N/A

It raises so many serious and ultimately disturbing questions about America's past--and by extension---current foreign policy objectives.This story focuses on the partially-fictionalized Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a founder of what ultimately is now known as the Central Intelligence Agency. Wilson's initial innocence and idealism is tried over the course of those pivotal years.Recruited to join the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, Wilson earns performance kudos at the expense of ultimately loosing what made himself 'him'; humanity. The constant state of paranoia which he is required to operate under finally eats away at both him and his family life.Wilson's real life counterparts James Jesus Angelton (a long-serving CIA director) and Richard Bissell (a covert operations specialist) provided inspiration for this film. Angelton also ultimately became engulfed by the very 'national security' system which he had long-term involvement with.The scripting and directing of this film easily maintained a 'suspense' environment without resorting to flashy special effects.

1052080,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B000MXPE7O,Roger J. Buffington,"[1, 3]","This movie is a fictionalized oral history of the genesis of the CIA, from its early days as the ""Office of Strategic Services"" through the Bay of Pigs debacle.  Its real story is the sacrifice that its protagonist ""Edward Wilson"" (Matt Damon) makes in order to serve the agency.  The Wilson character is a loose fictionalization of real-life former CIA Deputy Director for Counterintelligence James Jesus Angleton.I enjoyed this movie, and it is full of atmosphere, good dialog, and interesting historical background. There are lots of minor appearances by big stars such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, William Hurt, and others. What this film sorely lacks is a solid plot.  There simply isn't one, which is surprising.  Essentially the film takes the Wilson character at about the Bay of Pigs time frame, into a series of flashbacks, as we see how his entire life has centered around his devotion to the CIA to the exclusion of all else.  The ""plot"" if there is one, is simply this theme: that Wilson sacrifices all, family, fatherhood, his marriage, to serve the CIA.  During World War II and its aftermath, he simply disappears to his new wife for six years, and when he abruptly returns, he is not surprisingly a stranger to her.  This indifference to family in favor of career and devotion to duty is the real theme of this film.I enjoyed this film for its atmosphere and subject matter, but the lack of a plot is impossible not to miss and regret, because this could have been a great movie.  Cold War espionage offers limitless possibilities for telling a solid story (i.e. one with a plot and solid storyline) and the story of James Jesus Angleton is a fascinating one that would make for a superb film, properly done. This piece, however, does not succeed in being that film. That is truly unfortunate.Angleton fought for years to prevent KGB infiltration of the CIA, and this caused an awesome amount of turmoil within the Agency.  After Angleton left as head of Counter-intelligence, a series of catastrophes ensued within the CIA.  We were treated to the Walker spy scandals, Aldrich Aimes, the Hansen betrayal, and other counterintelligence debacles of the type that Angleton prevented during his watch.  He truly was ""The Good Shephard.""

1052081,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000MXPE7O,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","Robert De Niro's second directorial effort ""The Good Shepherd"" purports to tell the story of the birth of the CIA during the heyday of the Cold War.  Based very loosely on the lives of two intelligence officers, James Jesus Angleton and Richard M. Bissell Jr., the movie is a strong but patience-demanding work that will have some members of the audience sitting up in rapt attention while others squirm restlessly in their seats.  At 168 minutes and with little real action to speak of, ""The Good Shepherd"" is admittedly not the easiest sell for a mass audience, relying as it does on atmosphere and dialogue - and the patient goodwill of its viewers - to get its message across.  I can easily imagine a person watching this film with one eye planted firmly on his wristwatch and the other on the theater exit.  I'm happy to report that I was not one of those people, for despite a few longueurs that occur towards the end of the movie, I found this film to be both compelling and eminently watchable for most of its duration.Matt Damon, who ages remarkably little throughout the 23-year time span covered by the story, plays Edward Bell Wilson, an agent specializing in the fine art of counterintelligence.  With a screenplay by Eric Roth, the movie uses as its framing device the Bay of Pigs fiasco in the spring of 1961 and the suspicion that a mole in the agency must have tipped the Cubans off as to the American government's plan of invasion.  From there we flash back to 1939 where we meet Wilson as a student at Yale recruited by the FBI to perform surveillance on a poetry professor with possible ties to the then-burgeoning Nazi Party.  From then on, the film traces the arc of Wilson's life as he gets rooked into a largely loveless marriage (if one can call having to marry Angelina Jolie being ""rooked""), trains as an agent with British Intelligence and then the O.S.S., then helps to lay the groundwork for the American ""peace time"" organization known as the C.I.A.  The movie cuts back and forth between the two different time periods with only a few moments of confusion evident along the way.Wilson is probably the most button-downed, completely internalized character to hit the screen since Heath Ledger's Ennis del Mar in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (though the character here is not nearly as fully realized as that one was).  Wilson is a man almost totally devoid of humor and emotions - in many ways, the ideal person for the life of commitment and loneliness that spy work, by its very nature, demands.  Wilson barely cracks a smile throughout the course of the story, and he is so thoroughly absorbed in his work that he doesn't see his wife and young son for literally years at a stretch.  Wilson is surely one of the least audience-friendly of recent movie protagonists - or at least he would be if Damon did not convey the sort of puppy-dog vulnerability that actually makes us care about the character.  Despite the fact that we know he has dedicated his life to a cause that he considers worthwhile and noble, we have a hard time approving of the way he treats his wife and family.  Yet, Damon is able so show us that Wilson is not all that crazy about himself either and that he would lead a different life if only he were able to crawl out of his own skin and start all over.  But this he cannot do, so he remains locked in his fate, true to what he knows how to do and hoping for a little redemption at the end if the gods should deem him worthy of that blessing.  Damon plays his cards so close to the vest that he makes us continually re-evaluate the character without ever revealing more than we need to know about him.  Wilson may at times be taking stock of his life, but the filmmakers don't feel the need to blatantly spell all the details out for us.  It's in what's going on BEHIND those bespectacled eyes that the true drama lies.The movie does not shy away from the ugly realities of life as a CIA agent, showing us the cold-blooded ruthlessness and mounting paranoia that come with any life built, as this one is, on deception and distrust.Rather than aiming his film at the action crowd, De Niro has decided to focus on the characters and dialogue and simply hope that his audience will follow along with him.  As a director, he brings a quiet, subdued tone to the story, the better to match the persona of his main character.  In order to create a mood of contrasting emotions, cinematographer Robert Richardson uses a dull palette for the scenes set in the present, and a glowing, sepia-toned look for those set in the past.De Niro has assembled a veritable who's who of Hollywood's biggest and brightest to flesh out the minor roles - William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro, Joe Pesci, even De Niro himself - but, frankly, their parts are so limited that none truly stands out, thus clearing the way for Damon to take center stage.  Jolie has rarely looked so dreamily beautiful before, but even her screen time is too minimal for her to make more than a glancing impact on the film as a whole (it`s hard to believe any man would be as callously indifferent to the Jolie charm as Damon is here, but then, hey, that`s Hollywood).This is clearly Damon's film and he proves once again that acting does not need to be ""theatrical"" and ""showy"" to be effective.

I won't rehash th plot because other reviewers have already done a much better job than I could do. But first the flaws and these are truly minor.  The costuming and set design were very well done, but Matt Damon's makeup was poor.  We watched him over a period of 30+ years and he never gained weight, turned gray, lost hair, or showed any sign of age, unlike Joilie who looked more mature at the end than she did at the beginning. The sound could have been better because some lines were muffled and in this film every line is important.  The organization of the film -- which is done in flashbacks -- could be better because it was hard to track the sequence of events but the footnotes in the corner helped, but if you miss one you are at sea as to what is going on.Nevertheless, this is an excellent film and Matt Damon does a good job and the story is very similar to the George Smiley Tinker Tailor Spy.  Alec Guniness is more convincing as a spymaster but the destruction of Edward Wilson is more easily observed than with George Smiley but both characters end as The Walking Dead -- hollow men, wrapped in honor but devoid of family, friends, intimacy, trust, or anything worth living for other than God and Country.I thought this film really brought forth the reality that our government is dominated by the Ivy League Patricians.  This has been true throughout the 20th Century and it is this ""old boy"" network that has created compromised politicians, led to corruption in government, and has placed the country at risk on more than one occasion.The movie presents a variety of moral and ethical decisions which makes this film a good one to watch and discuss with your teenage children.  Edward Wilson's march to personal destruction is determined by individual decisions -- some small -- like the sexual encounter with Clover, which had disastrous results -- and some large -- like the decision to join the OSS.  The decision to spy on his professor was an ethical one but one that characterized Edward Wilson as a man who placed country above himself.  This dedication ultimately leads him to the heart rending decision regarding his son, which leaves him compromised.  This is a film with very complex characters whose motives are deep rooted and not easily discerned during the movie itself, but become clearer on reflection.  It vividly demonstrates the corrosiveness of secrets - especially on families.Some of the reviewers didn't like the film because it was too slow and too long.  It has a slow pace -- but these are spies not Tom Cruise on a ""Mission Impossible"" more aptly titled a ""Mission Improbable"".  It has no car chases, bombs, babes, or any of the usual fare that appeals to the adolescent mind. This is a thinking man's movie and an exceptional one at that.

1052087,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000MXPE7O,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 9]","""The Good Shepherd"" is a stunning bore, a three-hour dud chronicling the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. Like its main character, the movie insists on marching through the story with a blank-faced, downward-cast look toward the ground. Maybe it succeeds as history. But it fails, utterly, as entertainment.In a committed and thus dull performance, Matt Damon is Edward Wilson, a wonkish Yale grad who's recruited into the CIA by a paralytic general (Robert DeNiro) and a smarmy power broker (William Hurt) to run counterintelligence; that is, infiltrate the communists. The CIA and Russian KGB spent a lot of lives moving them around their global chessboards; Wilson, a secretive, opaque soul, is a perfect fit.Eric Roth's screenplay starts with the Bay of Pigs debacle, as Wilson tries to find the leak that doomed the 1961 mission, and works in flashback to 1939, when Wilson is forced to ditch his deaf sweetheart (Tammy Blanchard) to marry the pregnant Clover (Angelina Jolie), the sister of a classmate. Jolie is ludicrous, all sex, tears, aggression and jeers - the long-suffering wife trapped in a Bette Davis melodrama.DeNiro also directs, pushing the gas on that musical score and dividing the action into inert two-minute chunks. His camera won't linger or deepen our experience, chained, as it is, to Roth's dense, I-did-my-homework screenplay. DeNiro assembled gifted players - Hurt, John Turturro, Michael Gambon, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, Joe Pesci - and gave them very little motivation. It shows.Roth and DeNiro seem bent on demystifying the CIA and debunking James Bond, Tom Clancy, John Le Carre, ""Casablanca"" and just about every other artistic foray into the field. Fine.

All the elements were there for a great film - fantastic material (the birth of the CIA and the Cold War), great cast, and more-than-ample budget.  Unfortunately, the total is far less than the sum of its parts - and far more tedious.Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, privileged Yale undergraduate who gets inducted into America's least-secret secret society, Skull and Bones.  Given this access to privilege, Wilson receives a unique opportunity - to get in on the ground floor of America's new secret service, the OSS (the forerunner of the CIA).  Over the next few decades, Wilson will play a key part in the evolution of the Cold War.This should be exciting stuff.  Terrific authors have had loads of fun with the very same material - John Le Carre, Robert Littell, James Ellroy - and their novels are riveting page-turners.

Damon is in top form and a stoic spook, his character is hard to like much less love, I really could not for the life of me figure out why Jolie stays with him for so long; he is a bad husband and an even worse father, it is heart wrenching to watch his young son beg for his father's attention and Damon all but ignore him.  Damon puts country above all else and its amazing how startlingly obtuse he is about his families needs.  The film is beautifully shot and though quite lengthy its does not lag.

DeNiro, who directed the movie, shows, for the most part, restraint in his CIA epic.  There are some preachy moments where DeNiro seems to be making some comment on current events, and even a few Oliver Stone like whoppers, cloaked in the movie's muted tone.  Whatever.  But at one point there is the inevitable Be-Careful-You-Don't-Lose-Your-Soul line.  The problem is that the movie, by the time that line is delivered, has established in the viewer's mind that what is being watched is pretty much soulless exercise in filmmaking.  As much as it wants to be, the film never seems to develop into an Epic.  The Length is there, the meticulous craftsmanship in the framing of scenes (why I'm giving this 3 stars), but when it comes to getting a real historical sweep, things get hazy.  Oh, there's the Bay of Pigs, and old Nazi clips, but historical hooks are surprisingly few.  The lead casting is also very questionable.  Damon as the robotic and detached ""company"" man, Edward Wilson, and the exotic Jolie as the wife and mother, Clover - Margaret, is bizarre.  Actually, both actors do very well, it's just that physically they seem to be wrong fits for the roles.  Further, neither actor seems to ever age in a movie that spans decades.  The model here, was obviously the ""Godfather II.""  Unfortunately, the Good Shepherd lack both the scale and the story of what is one of the greatest American films.  And that should have been expected.The movie does have several ""good"" moments however.  The Skull & Crossbones stuff, seemed pretty authentic, even if you've read about it a dozen times in fiction and nonfiction.

That may be true if you like a movie that is as long and wide as its aspect ratio with very little action.And the lack of action was deliberate on DiNiro's part (DiNiro directs and also co-stars).

In The Good Shepard you wait and wait for something to happen seeing the same actors over and over again with very little action and then the movie just ends with no real sense that there was a story that led up to ""that climactic moment"".So do you want to hurry up and wait to see how the CIA was born?

So,with ""The Good Shepherd"" taking place the eras of World War II and the Bay of Pigs,with a great cast of actors (Matt Damon,Angelina Jolie,Robert De Niro,Alec Baldwin,William Hurt,and,despite the fact that you only get a cameo appearance out of him,Joe Pesci),the film is great,right?Unfortunately,the answer to that question is wrong.First of all,""The Great Shepherd"" has one of the strongest plots ever to be used for a movie. It is about a young man named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon),who has had a tough life. During the middle of his childhood,he lost his father to suicide. And,even though his attendance at Yale University gave Edward Wilson a strong chance for success in his adult life,Edward made two mistakes during his college years. Those mistakes? Accepting an invitation into the Office of Strategic Services (the CIA's predecessor)by a general named Bill Sullivan(Robert De Niro)during World War II,and getting a young woman named Margaret Ann Russell(Angelina Jolie)pregnant. Now,years have passed by,and as Edward realizes he made mistakes,he must deal with two hard tasks at the same time:1)saving his marriage,and 2)investigating the Office of Strategic Services (this is during the Bay of Pigs era)with Sam Murach (Alec Baldwin)and Philip Allen (William Hurt),while he keeps his work in the OSS during World War II a secret. Can Edward Wilson succeed at all of this,or has his past mistakes done too much damage to his current life?So,what sends ""The Good Shepherd"" downhill? First of all,this film's script is completely messy and unarranged. The events that are documented in this film are not documented in chronological order,and are presented back and forth. This makes the film hard to follow and understand,and does not give its viewers the information they would want to know concerning Edward Wilson's service in the Office of Strategic Services and his investigation of the OSS.

Matt Damon, plays the lead role of Edward Wilson, a shy young man with little to say for himself who becomes a member of the secret society known as Skull & Bones whilst a student at Yale.Wilson loves poetry and developes a special relationship with his tutor (Michael Gambon) whom he eventually betrays when he is made aware that the tutor is a Nazi Spy.This betrayal sets the pattern of what is to become Edward Wilson's life,a man who totally subjagates his own emotions in order to put his country first.He marries a woman (Angelina Jolie,in a minor role) he does not love as she is expecting his child, and unbeknownst to her, he requests to be sent on an OSS overseas mission,which he leaves to go to the day after his marriage.He lives in a world without any real human contact, unable to trust any of his colleagues, and his wife and son at home are strangers to him.Joe Pesci plays Joseph Palmi, an underworld figure very reminiscent of Carlos Marcello in a book I've just finished reading (Mafia King Fish), when Cuban gambling casinos are shut down by Fidel Castro costing the Mafia millions in lost revenue.This of course later leads to mob involvement in the Bay of Pigs and the attempted assassination of Castro.The cast is full of top names and great performances, especially from Damon,DeNiro, Joe Pesci,Tammy Blanchard,Michael Gambon and William Hurt.The film is very long (168 minutes) and is slow moving, unlike most movies made today, and it requires concentration, patience, and an appreciation of actors absorbed in their roles.

1052113,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000MXPE7O,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 2]","Ingeniously written, with superlative acting and a masterful score, this sinister drama delves into the mysterious and ruinous influences the CIA has on the lives of their dedicated operatives. A slightly disconcerting timeline doesn't deter from enjoying the crafty elements of betrayal, suspicion and sacrifice that permeate this Cold War espionage epic.Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a well-rounded Yale graduate who is quickly recruited into the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency due to his desired qualities of discretion and commitment. Suspicion and paranoia gradually overrun his once steadfast belief in American values, as he rapidly becomes a chief operative and an integral part of the system. Engulfed in distrust and intent on combating his KGB rival, Wilson consequently sacrifices his ideals and his family in the pursuit of his career.The Good Shepherd achieves what films of this length usually attempt and rarely succeed at, and that is to delve into the inner-workings of its characters and explore character development to its most complex and absolute fullest. Meaningful events and poignant dialogue work beautifully to immerse the viewer into the traumatic lives of those involved in the secretive CIA and its shaky roots. Most prominently is the character study of the fictitious Edward Wilson, whose dynamic rise and fall parallels films such as The Godfather. Although they both fail in preventing what seems to be inevitable destiny, Wilson manages to wash away guilt, feeling and perhaps even acknowledgement of his situation and the sacrifices made to preserve the job that keeps him in an ominous stranglehold. Inhumanly he acts according to its will, half conscious of the consequences to his family and himself, and yet he relishes in the accomplishments that lead to absolute solitude. So many of his ill deeds are attempts at righting other wrongs, and he is perpetually fixed in compromises, sacrifices and decisions that aid the agency. His choices are those of ill-fate and necessity; he is capable of love, but unable to display it fruitfully, and like his father, negatively impacts the lives of his wife and son. A truly tragic character, the viewer is made aware of his hopeless cycle throughout the film, but only at the conclusion do we see the shell of the man chewed up and spit out and left in reflection; he fails to accept the realizations of how his choices affect those closest to him, even though such repercussions are unintentional. The intense themes of paranoia, suspicion, and betrayal are wonderfully conjured up through masterfully dramatic performances by rising star Matt Damon, and equally stunning supporting actors Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, and Robert De Niro. John Turturro plays operative Ray Brocco, another outstanding supporting performance, who menacingly and efficiently carries out his duty; he retains a sense of humor at his inception into the agency, but gradually develops into an efficiently torturous henchman. Robert De Niro, who also directs, makes a short appearance, as does Joe Pesci, who has been curiously out of the spotlight for a very long time, garnering a high billing even though his character appears for only one scene...Read the full review at [...]",4,The Good Shepherd Movie Review,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,3253,"['Ingeniously', 'written', 'superlative', 'acting', 'masterful', 'score', 'sinister', 'drama', 'mysterious', 'ruinous', 'influences', 'CIA', 'lives', 'dedicated', 'operatives', 'slightly', 'disconcerting', 'timeline', ""n't"", 'deter', 'enjoying', 'crafty', 'elements', 'betrayal', 'suspicion', 'sacrifice', 'permeate', 'Cold', 'War', 'espionage', 'epic.Edward', 'Wilson', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'well-rounded', 'Yale', 'graduate', 'who', 'quickly', 'recruited', 'newly', 'formed', 'Central', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'due', 'desired', 'qualities', 'discretion', 'commitment', 'Suspicion', 'paranoia', 'gradually', 'once', 'steadfast', 'belief', 'American', 'values', 'rapidly', 'chief', 'operative', 'integral', 'part', 'system', 'Engulfed', 'distrust', 'intent', 'combating', 'KGB', 'rival', 'Wilson', 'consequently', 'ideals', 'family', 'pursuit', 'career.The', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'what', 'films', 'length', 'usually', 'attempt', 'rarely', 'succeed', 'delve', 'inner-workings', 'characters', 'explore', 'character', 'development', 'most', 'complex', 'absolute', 'fullest', 'Meaningful', 'events', 'poignant', 'dialogue', 'work', 'beautifully', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'traumatic', 'lives', 'involved', 'secretive', 'CIA', 'shaky', 'roots', 'Most', 'prominently', 'character', 'study', 'fictitious', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'dynamic', 'rise', 'fall', 'parallels', 'films', 'such', 'Godfather', 'fail', 'preventing', 'what', 'be', 'inevitable', 'destiny', 'Wilson', 'wash', 'away', 'guilt', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'even', 'acknowledgement', 'situation', 'sacrifices', 'made', 'preserve', 'job', 'ominous', 'stranglehold', 'Inhumanly', 'according', 'will', 'half', 'conscious', 'consequences', 'family', 'yet', 'accomplishments', 'lead', 'absolute', 'solitude', 'So', 'many', 'ill', 'deeds', 'are', 'attempts', 'righting', 'other', 'wrongs', 'perpetually', 'fixed', 'compromises', 'sacrifices', 'decisions', 'aid', 'agency', 'choices', 'are', 'ill-fate', 'necessity', 'capable', 'love', 'unable', 'display', 'fruitfully', 'father', 'negatively', 'lives', 'wife', 'son', 'truly', 'tragic', 'character', 'viewer', 'made', 'aware', 'hopeless', 'cycle', 'film', 'only', 'conclusion', 'do', 'see', 'shell', 'man', 'chewed', 'up', 'spit', 'out', 'left', 'reflection', 'accept', 'realizations', 'how', 'choices', 'affect', 'closest', 'even', 'such', 'repercussions', 'are', 'unintentional', 'intense', 'themes', 'paranoia', 'suspicion', 'betrayal', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'conjured', 'up', 'masterfully', 'dramatic', 'performances', 'rising', 'star', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'equally', 'stunning', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'John', 'Turturro', 'operative', 'Ray', 'Brocco', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'performance', 'who', 'menacingly', 'efficiently', 'out', 'duty', 'sense', 'humor', 'inception', 'agency', 'gradually', 'efficiently', 'torturous', 'henchman', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'also', 'short', 'appearance', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'who', 'been', 'curiously', 'spotlight', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'garnering', 'high', 'billing', 'even', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'Read', 'full', 'review', '[', ']']",N/A

1052115,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B000MXPE7O,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[16, 23]","Director:  Robert De NiroCast:  Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, Tammy Blanchard, Billy Crudup, Robert De Niro, Keir Dullea, Michael Gamdon, William Hurt, Timothy Dutton.Running Time:  167 minutesRated R violence, some sexuality, and language.A gray winter day was a fitting time to see one of the first public screenings of a film called ""The Good Shepherd,"" whose chilly hero Edward Wilson (Matt Damon, in a role modeled in part on CIA founder, James Jesus Angleton) is not so much all things to all men as nobody to anybody. A composite figure in a portrait of the birth, rise, and moral shriveling of the American CIA, Matt Damon's disturbingly shut-down Wilson would be one of recent film's most tragic figures if he were not such a hollow, unappealing man. Directing a long-contemplated project using a screenplay by Eric Roth (who penned ""Munich""), Robert De Niro has forged a ""Godfather"" of Yankee spy-craft, a heavy, solemn epic about betrayal and loyalty in the world of espionage and counter-espionage dominated not by Italians as in the original ""Godfather,"" though Coppola produced, De Niro directed, and Joe Pesci has one of the liveliest on screen moments, but by uptight, stony, patrician WASPs.  Indeed as seen here the world of American intelligence is a privileged and exclusive and deeply conflicted one where Irish, blacks, and Italians need not apply; fathers are absent; privilege grows out of Skull and Bones at Yale, wives are betrayed; sons labor desperately to measure up, and the leading practitioners are ridden with guilt and suspicion. There is no one to trust and nothing to believe in - not family or tradition, or even music - only America, which Edward Wilson says belongs to his class. All others are just visiting.Into this demoralizing story, damning in its picture of the world of white privilege and of intelligence itself but nonetheless intricately involving and at times genuinely disturbing, are woven some of the major incidents and personalities of the period from from before the Second World War - after which OSS morphed into CIA-- till after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion under JFK, from hot war to cold war. You have Philbys and fake Russian turncoats, CIA execs siphoning off money to Switzerland in guise of chocolate boxes, and through it all you have a Cuba mole investigation that smashes Wilson's own family.  Wilson's true penchant was for a deaf girl named Laura (an excellent Tammy Blanchard); and with her is the only time Damon seems to develop human warmth. He is forced to marry the more elevated Margaret Russell (an uncomfortable Angelina Jolie) sister of one of his Skull and Bones colleagues who remains Wilson's Old Boy link to privilege ever after. Traumatic embarrassment, revelation of closest held secrets, and doubt of loyalty are seen as inborn elements of the espionage world. The very qualities that make a good spy, as seen here, also make a man untrustworthy.Do spies ever have fun? Not much, as seen from the angle of Damon's character. Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon), a randy gay pseudo-intellectual who turns and turns again, is naughty, but he pays for it. Another Brit, Arch Cummings, played gamely by Billy Crudup, similarly wears a smile that turns to dust. A good professional of the lower ranks like Staff Sergeant Brocco (John Turturro), Wilson's OSS assistant in England, is a stern sadist whose use of LSD for an interrogation backfires fatally. Nasty sabotages are devised to spoil the left's Latin American agricultural schemes. Big foul-ups like the Bay of Pigs invasion lead to vicious internal purges. And through it all Wilson's son cringes and his wife pines; the marriage had dried up after his six-year absence during WWII; and his imploded selfhood is symbolized by his only hobby, building ships inside bottles. As the film bluntly puts it, the spy-master must choose either family or country; he can't have both. And is it all worth it? The Russian on LSD declares his country's armed might a myth perpetuated by America to justify its ongoing pursuit of world dominance. Is intelligence a needed quantity, or are its organizations self-perpetuating shams? The movie never gives a positive answer. This may be the cruelest picture of the spy game ever put on film.  Many fine actors play small unappealing roles as spy-masters or cold operatives. These include De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, and William Hurt, all creditable, but unlikely to get Oscar nods for their tightly held back performances. Damon can be accused of the same limitation, though if his Wilson bothers you, he's done his job better than you may think. And young Eddie Redmayne, as Wilson's grown son, has one of the most gut-wrenching roles in a story notable for its devastating picture of the effects of career on family life.  Despite its epic scale and length (it's 160 minutes long), ""The Good Shepherd"" is more troubling than flashy, more thought-provoking than moving. Ultimately it may be somewhat an artistic failure. The criticism that it is either too long or too short, that it needed to be pared down or expanded to a mini-series, has some merit. But nonetheless as a work that considers big issues and asks big questions, it's one of the more serious and intellectually stimulating mainstream American films of the year.",4,The Good Shepherd

1052117,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000MXPE7O,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 8]","Robert DeNiro is considered by many to be one of the finest actors working in film. Naturally, after playing the number of diverse, challenging roles he has brought to the big screen, he is looking for new challenges. As someone working in film, one of those challenges is directing. Rather than play it safe, DeNiro takes on the complex tale of the birth of the CIA in ""The Good Shepherd"".April, 1961. The Bay of Pigs is a disaster and Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) returns to Washington, DC as President Kennedy prepares to do some damage control and avert World War III. As he contemplates how the leak may have occurred, he begins to think back to his college days at Yale. Recruited into the secret Skull & Bones society, Edward soon becomes a full fledged member, trying to remain loyal to his fraternity brothers. At one of the society's retreats, he meets Clover (Angelina Jolie), the sister of his friend, John Russell (Gabriel Macht), the son of a Senator (Keir Dullea), who are also members of the society. Clover throws herself at Edward and a couple of weeks later, she announces she is pregnant and she and Edward are soon married. As World War II looms, Edward is approached by General Sullivan (Robert DeNiro), who wants a select group of men to travel to Europe to perform counter intelligence. After they return, Edward meets his son and the counter intelligence operations continue, becoming the basis of the Central Intelligence Agency, under the direction of Phillip Allen (William Hurt). Throughout his life, Edward faces challenges to his family life, patriotism and loyalty.""The Good Shepherd"" is a difficult thing to discuss. At over 2 hours and 45 minutes, the film covers a lot of territory and presents a lot of detail and both director DeNiro and writer Eric Roth (""Munich"", ""Ali"", ""The Insider"", ""Forrest Gump"") have done a great job of keeping all of this information accessible and easy to follow. You never feel as though you are drowning in story, details or characters, and there are many I didn't even mention.Matt Damon's performance as Edward is interesting. Extremely modulated, he almost never changes the tone of his voice. This does two things; on the one hand, it perfectly conveys his constant unease with his role in society and what he does but on the other hand, it makes his performance slightly boring. You want Damon to speak up, yell, cry, and do something other than stare impassively at someone else. I get that he is playing a spy, and is supposed to remain very aloof, but he is also playing a human. The few times he does yell or shout light up the screen and show us the potential of this character. I understand why it didn't happen more, but if it had, the character would have gone from just good to near great.Anjelina Jolie plays Clover, or Margaret, the precocious daughter of a US Senator (Keir Dullea). From the moment we first meet her, she throws herself at Edward in a determined effort to snare him. As the story evolves, they are soon married and Edward is off to War, leaving her to give birth to their son alone. Later in the film, she complains about being left alone, about how he never loved her, etc. Her role resembles the old fashioned `vamp' type of role. I recently saw some `Pre Code' films made by Hollywood in the early 30s. In these films, Barbara Stanwyck, Jean Harlow and the like, play `upwardly mobile' women determined to sleep their way to the top. In ""The Good Shepherd"", Jolie's Margaret seems determined to mate with Edward. If this is, in fact, the case, we never really learn why.The film is filled with a veritable who's who of memorable character actors. Michael Gambon plays one of Edward's Yale professors, who may have a thing for young men. Alec Baldwin plays Sam Murach, a member of the FBI who initially approaches Edward with an assignment. Billy Crudup plays Arch Cummings, a British spy who helps train Edward. William Hurt plays Phillip Allen, the man who helps found the CIA and guide the organization in its first few years. Timothy Hutton, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and John Turtorro also pop up as various pieces of the puzzle. Some of these supporting characters are more involving and more interesting than others; Gambon stands out as an integral part of the story. As a poetry professor, guiding Edward in his thesis, he makes a pass at Edward who rejects. But this professor plays an important part in the overall story and finding out how he fits in is part of the fun. Alec Baldwin pops up repeatedly as sort of a guardian angel for Edward, guiding him towards the truth. John Turturro plays Edward's assistant, working with him through the decades as they work through one crisis after another. Other characters pop up briefly and then disappear. Joe Pesci plays a gangster ousted from Cuba when Castro takes over. Edward turns to him for help and guidance before the Bay of Pigs operation. The role is interesting, but way too brief and more of a distraction than anything. Oh, look. It's Joe Pesci.""The Good Shepherd"" works best when it concentrates on the mechanics of the story, showing us how this agency was created, some of the activities it participated in, the like. From the moment Edward enters Yale, he seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps and become a member of the super secretive ""Skull and Bones"" society. We watch as Edward participates in the initiation and then his first interaction with Murach (Baldwin), in 1939. Murach wants him to give him a list of people who may be Nazi sympathizers. Edward's patriotism is never at question, so he does what he needs to do. Then, General Sullivan (DeNiro), also a member of ""Skull and Bones"", asks him to do counter intelligence work in London during World War II. There, he works with Cummings (Crudup) and others to learn about their methods and provide any help he can. Here, he begins a long and trusting relationship with his assistant (Turturro). Upon his return home, Sullivan asks him to continue the work with the new CIA, which will be headed by another member of ""Skull and Bones"", Philip Allen (Hurt). The film goes to great lengths to successfully show us the wheeling - dealing that went on behind the scenes during the formation of this agency.Then the story shifts and we start to watch some of the operations they were involved in. These are presented as vignettes, of a sort, and they all lead to Castro and the Bay of Pigs. DeNiro and Roth use these events to illustrate the long term problems the CIA and other agencies of its type create for themselves and us. As the CIA becomes more involved in foreign governments, they sometimes make the wrong decisions, which proves troublesome to our country at later points.The last act of the film, which details the Bay of Pigs operation and the resulting fiasco it creates, also involves Edward and Margaret's son, Edward Junior (Eddie Redmayne Jr.), now a young man who is also a part of the CIA. Throughout the film, as Edward steps back into the lives of his wife and son, we watch the boy grow up, insecure, always looking for his father's approval. As a member of the CIA, he is no different. This part of the story was the least successful simply because I found the performance by Redmayne to be fairly one note as well. In one scene, his expression is blank. In the next, he is mad at his dad. In another, another argument. In yet another, the blank expression returns. It is also difficult to believe Damon and Jolie's characters would father a grown son as they look pretty much the same throughout. The one concession to age seems to be a little bit of powder on Jolie's face and she appears to be tired. But they don't really age so it is startling to watch this character grow up as they stay relatively the same age.DeNiro is clearly a talented director, and he is working with a story he has a great deal of interest in. It is also nice to see a film depict such a secretive organization `warts and all'. What the film shows doesn't appear to be sugar coated; we see the good and the bad. And that's a good thing. But as an actor, it seems like he would be able to realize the majority of the performances in the film are lifeless and cold. The most emotional characters are either the least mature, or the most harassed, as two Russian spies turn on the emotions as they plea for their life.""The Good Shepherd"" is worth your time, and it will take a lot of it, but it will be stingy in the rewards. You will learn a lot about the operations, but little about the people behind the early days of the Central Intelligence Agency.",4,DeNiro Challenges Himself,1167696000,"01 2,

1052118,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B000MXPE7O,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[2, 3]","First, a comment of commendation: Matt Damon played the lead role in this film. He was so low key, he almost reminded me of Billy Bob Thornton in ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" i.e., so different from a role I would expect of him was to border on the uncanny.Now, commenting on my ""title."" I usually don't do all that well with films that start at one historic point, then bring you thirty years before, then sixty years after...and on and on. You get the picture? This film did that quite a bit. It went from Edward Wilson's (Damon's) role as a student at Yale, and his induction into Skull and Bones, then to during WWII, then back gto Wilson's childhood when Edward witnessed his father's suicide, then... (The only ""adhesive"" in the film was the suicide note that his father had left. It came up during a discussion in the film in which Edward stated that he hadn't read it, then later in the film, when Edward, much later in his life, actually did.)I saw the point of that format in the film but it can be a little disconcerting, a little hard to follow.Now, one trait of the film that appealed to me was that when I was in Ireland in early 2007, the film had just arrived there and was showing a lot of popularity in Ireland. Remember that the CIA isn't a terribly popular organization, both because of its indiscretions and myths associated with it, not to mention, I suspect, crimes for which it has been blamed while other US organizations, perhaps the Defense Dept., the Homeland Security people, or others may be more responsible for it. But it has always intrigued me how popular anti-CIA (or anti-secret in general) stories can be around the world.It was never clear to me whether the film was supposed to be a docudrama, a work of complete fiction, or a pseudo-docudrama. I got the impression  that it's supposed to be the third of those, i.e., a predominantly fictional demonstration of how the agency came about, from well-connected elites with little feel for how the rest of us feel. If that's the case, the film succeeded. Again, many of the agency bigwigs at least in the film were Yalies, had connection in the UK with graduates of Cambridge, all of them arrogant, cynical, and unable to trust even each other.And Damon was so low key that even his wife, portrayed as the sister of another Bonesman whom Damon got pregnant early in the film, complained to him that she didn't even know what he did.Part of the film's confusion too came about because of an affair Damon had early in the film, and that which another character was ""having,"" and Damon was investigating. (I won't give away any details of that investigation lest I give away more than you should know before you see the film!) While I've seen the film twice so far, I got those two affairs a little mixed up.There was the interaction between Soviet agents and those of the US, theCIA's alleged use of lysergic acid to lose one of their potential assests--much of this stuff documented as among the agency's ill-advised tactics.The film overall has an interesting story, keeps you on the edge of your seat quite effectively. The characters and themes can be confusing, but they do, alas, drive you to want to watch it again. And its accuracy or not could be enough to keep discussion groups occupied for a long time.It's pretty long, though. If you have anyone with a short attention span, recommend something else. There is tension, enough to keep you watching. The acting was I thought excellent. (DeNiro does show up a few times, but he doesn't use it as a medium to show off his face.) Alec Baldwin is an FBI agent who also serves as a bit of an adhesive through the script. And I won't tell you the content of the suidice note--not released until near the film's end--of you'll have someone put out a contract on me, and I won't blame you.Enjoy it, though, and let it encourage your reading more about the ""intelligence apparatus"" and its indiscretions, as well as its alleged successes and failures.",4,"A little difficult to follow, but accurate?",1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,3985,"['First', 'comment', 'commendation', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'played', 'lead', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'almost', 'reminded', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'i.e.', 'so', 'different', 'role', 'would', 'expect', 'was', 'border', 'uncanny.Now', 'commenting', 'title', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'films', 'start', 'one', 'historic', 'point', 'then', 'bring', 'thirty', 'years', 'then', 'sixty', 'years', 'get', 'picture', 'film', 'did', 'quite', 'bit', 'went', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'Damon', 'role', 'student', 'Yale', 'induction', 'Skull', 'Bones', 'then', 'WWII', 'then', 'back', 'gto', 'Wilson', 'childhood', 'when', 'Edward', 'witnessed', 'father', 'suicide', 'then', 'only', 'adhesive', 'film', 'was', 'suicide', 'note', 'father', 'had', 'left', 'came', 'up', 'discussion', 'film', 'Edward', 'stated', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'then', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'Edward', 'much', 'later', 'life', 'actually', 'did', 'saw', 'point', 'format', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'little', 'hard', 'follow.Now', 'one', 'trait', 'film', 'appealed', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'Ireland', 'early', '2007', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'arrived', 'there', 'was', 'showing', 'lot', 'popularity', 'Ireland', 'Remember', 'CIA', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'popular', 'organization', 'indiscretions', 'myths', 'associated', 'not', 'mention', 'suspect', 'crimes', 'been', 'blamed', 'other', 'US', 'organizations', 'perhaps', 'Defense', 'Dept.', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'people', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'responsible', 'always', 'intrigued', 'how', 'popular', 'anti-CIA', 'anti-secret', 'general', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'world.It', 'was', 'never', 'clear', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'docudrama', 'work', 'complete', 'fiction', 'pseudo-docudrama', 'got', 'impression', 'supposed', 'be', 'third', 'i.e.', 'predominantly', 'fictional', 'demonstration', 'how', 'agency', 'came', 'about', 'well-connected', 'elites', 'little', 'feel', 'how', 'rest', 'feel', 'case', 'film', 'succeeded', 'Again', 'many', 'agency', 'bigwigs', 'least', 'film', 'were', 'Yalies', 'had', 'connection', 'UK', 'graduates', 'Cambridge', 'arrogant', 'cynical', 'unable', 'trust', 'even', 'other.And', 'Damon', 'was', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'even', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'sister', 'Bonesman', 'whom', 'Damon', 'got', 'pregnant', 'early', 'film', 'complained', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'confusion', 'too', 'came', 'affair', 'Damon', 'had', 'early', 'film', 'character', 'was', 'having', 'Damon', 'was', 'investigating', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'investigation', 'lest', 'give', 'away', 'more', 'should', 'know', 'see', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'twice', 'so', 'far', 'got', 'two', 'affairs', 'little', 'mixed', 'up.There', 'was', 'interaction', 'Soviet', 'agents', 'US', 'theCIA', 'alleged', 'use', 'lysergic', 'acid', 'lose', 'one', 'potential', 'assests', 'much', 'stuff', 'documented', 'agency', 'ill-advised', 'tactics.The', 'film', 'overall', 'interesting', 'story', 'edge', 'seat', 'quite', 'effectively', 'characters', 'themes', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'do', 'alas', 'drive', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'accuracy', 'not', 'could', 'be', 'enough', 'keep', 'discussion', 'groups', 'occupied', 'long', 'time.It', 'pretty', 'long', 'though', 'have', 'anyone', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'recommend', 'something', 'else', 'tension', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'acting', 'was', 'thought', 'excellent', 'DeNiro', 'show', 'up', 'few', 'times', ""n't"", 'use', 'medium', 'show', 'off', 'face', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'also', 'bit', 'adhesive', 'script', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'content', 'suidice', 'note', 'not', 'released', 'film', 'end', ""'ll"", 'have', 'someone', 'put', 'out', 'contract', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blame', 'you.Enjoy', 'though', 'let', 'encourage', 'reading', 'more', 'intelligence', 'apparatus', 'indiscretions', 'as', 'well', 'alleged', 'successes', 'failures']",N/A

I mean Really Excited and then after you watch, it is a Major Dissapointment! Sadly that was my experience with the Good Shepherd! I am Shocked at just how bad this film was! This Film had so many things going for it: MATT DAMON, ANGELINA JOLIE, WILLIAM HURT, ALEC BALDWIN and ROBERT DENIRO(acting and Directing), a Story Line that really hasnt been explored much in films, that is the beginning of The CIA. This Movie Should have Been Great, So what Happened? Well, to start off, this movie is LONG and SLOW, clocks in at 160 Minutes(felt like 160 hours). There really isnt any excitement, no major cloak and dagger incidents. The Cold War with Russia should have been explored way more but in this film, it just gets a glossy over. The film kept going back and forth from the late 1930's-early 1940's to the late 1950's-early 1960's but what Deniro forgot to do was age Matt Damon when they did go back and forth, Matt plays a 20 year in  1939 and in 1959 , he still looks like a little boy, this was very distracting in the film and I had a hard time figuring out what period the film was in. I guess after the producers paid Matt, Angelina and Deniro, their huge salaries, they couldnt afford a decent makeup artist. The Film is also very depressing, not many happy people in this film, matt damon's character is miserable throughout, keeps everyone at a distance.  On The Plus Side, Matt Damon was Excellent in the role, he really does get into the character and the film does offer some interesting history about the CIA.

I had previously read in historical biographies about the men who formed the CIA after WWII, and this film seemed to follow the information that I have learned.  I was quite surprised, however, by the films direction.  I always find it odd that spies for western nations could end up being spies for the Soviets.  Never ceases to amaze me.  Anyway, this film left me only slightly disappointed and mostly happy with what I saw.  Angelina Jolie could have stayed home, as while her role was important, it could have been played by anybody.  Her performance was rather flat.  Matt Damon was his typical Matt Damon self, that is right on target.  He is a blossoming and amazing actor, and I'm sure that we will continue to see stellar stuff from Matt.  Robert De Niro, who directs this film, made a couple of cameo appearances; it's always good to see De Niro.  Joe Pesci graced the screen for a few minutes, and I found it chilling how he was so much like himself.  I have to say that Joe Pesci is one of the most consistent character actors around, he is always Joe Pesci.  He'd make a great serial killer in the next Hannibal movie.  I was quite surprised by Billy Crudup's role; hard to imagine him with shortish hair.Good film, great writing.  It has a Godfather like touch to it.

The success of A Bronx Tale would emerge from out of the matrix of De Niro's immensely successful association with Martin Scorsese and from actor/writer Chaz Palmieri's wonderful screenplay.  Throughout A Bronx Tale, De Niro displayed what seemed to be an innate and thorough grasp of  New York's organized crime scene.In disappointing contrast, The Good Shepherd stands as a pretentious and  insipid film. Dark and complex aspects of CIA operations worldwide are either treated superficially or are totally obfuscated. On the surface, the premise of The Good Shepherd suggests a work poised to deliver a timely and provocative look at America's foreign policy in the post World War II era, one spanning several decades that focuses upon the conduct of CIA operations worldwide. Matt Damon is Edward Wilson, a dull Yale Skull and Crossbones alumnus recruited by CIA founder William Donovan and played by De Niro. Angelina Jolie plays Clover, Wilson's beautiful and frustrated wife. Alec Baldwin and William Hurt deliver fine performances as does Joe Peschi - whom we encounter very briefly and memorably (as in A Bronx Tale) playing mobster Joseph Palmi.DeNiro uses flashbacks throughout the film in a manner that irritates and confuses. As the film's screenwriter, Eric Roth,(whose earlier works include Forest Gump and Munich), delivers a sanitized and vapid script that fails to shed light on critical events and issues underlying US policy worldwide. For example, in mentioning the CIA coup in Guatemala, Roth completely ignores the role played by corporate interests such as United Fruit, (now Chiquita Brands International). As men with strong links to United Fruit, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and CIA Director Allen Dulles supported plans for a coup that overthrew the democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz who sought to nationalize lands held by United Fruit. In the process, America devastated Guatemala's hope of securing a future based on justice and progress. Roth's screenplay adopts the fiction claimed by the Eisenhower administration in 1954 that Arbenz served as an agent of Soviet-styled communism and therefore his removal was essential to the national security of the United States.  In no part of this film do we see evidence of the integration of vital literature pertaining to CIA global actions such as Miles Copeland's The Game of Nations, William Crane Eveland's Ropes of Sand, Phillip Agee's Inside the Company or John Stockwell's In Search of Enemies. Roth does refer to certain aspects of  America's Bay of Pigs fiasco, but affords us so little  historical information about the subject that we are unable to analyze it in an informed and critical way.In assessing The Good Shepherd, one should bear in mind  Samuel Johnson's wise adage that ""patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel."" In The Good Shepherd - Edward Wilson -  emerges in the Roth script as an unfortunate and bland global automaton who clings to career and class while placing considerations of state interest far above that of family.  Like a character in a Sinclair Lewis novel, he remains oblivious to the moral conundrums inherent in the implementation of CIA policies.Sadly, we are afforded so little information pertaining to critical issues, events, countries, people, and corporations  that a true philosophical quandary involving the main character and the goals he pursues never emerges. And the script contains none of the depth or insight of a Sinclair Lewis novel. Alas, in the final analysis, we care very little about Wilson and all we are left with is a disjointed glimpse into the life of a global functionary who is devoid of soul, and we are none the better for having made such a pointless journey.",2,A disjointed glimpse into the life of a global functionary who is devoid of soul...,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,4131,"['Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'extraordinary', 'talents', 'actor', 'need', 'elaboration', 'here', 'regard', 'De', 'Niro', 'abilities', 'director', 'useful', 'compare', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'last', 'effort', '1993', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'second', 'film', 'former', 'displays', 'evidence', 'masterly', 'imaginative', 'directorial', 'gifts', 'brought', 'life', 'story', 'replete', 'power', 'violence', 'poignancy', 'insight', 'humor', 'success', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'would', 'emerge', 'matrix', 'De', 'Niro', 'immensely', 'successful', 'association', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'actor/writer', 'Chaz', 'Palmieri', 'wonderful', 'screenplay', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'De', 'Niro', 'displayed', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'innate', 'thorough', 'grasp', 'New', 'York', 'organized', 'crime', 'scene.In', 'disappointing', 'contrast', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'pretentious', 'insipid', 'film', 'Dark', 'complex', 'aspects', 'CIA', 'operations', 'are', 'either', 'treated', 'superficially', 'are', 'totally', 'obfuscated', 'surface', 'premise', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'work', 'poised', 'deliver', 'timely', 'provocative', 'look', 'America', 'foreign', 'policy', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'era', 'one', 'spanning', 'several', 'decades', 'conduct', 'CIA', 'operations', 'worldwide', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'dull', 'Yale', 'Skull', 'Crossbones', 'alumnus', 'recruited', 'CIA', 'founder', 'William', 'Donovan', 'played', 'De', 'Niro', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Clover', 'Wilson', 'beautiful', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'William', 'Hurt', 'deliver', 'fine', 'performances', 'Joe', 'Peschi', 'whom', 'encounter', 'very', 'briefly', 'memorably', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'playing', 'mobster', 'Joseph', 'Palmi.DeNiro', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'manner', 'confuses', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'Eric', 'Roth', 'earlier', 'include', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'Munich', 'sanitized', 'vapid', 'script', 'shed', 'light', 'critical', 'events', 'issues', 'underlying', 'policy', 'worldwide', 'example', 'mentioning', 'CIA', 'coup', 'Guatemala', 'Roth', 'completely', 'role', 'played', 'corporate', 'interests', 'such', 'United', 'Fruit', 'now', 'Chiquita', 'Brands', 'International', 'men', 'strong', 'links', 'United', 'Fruit', 'Secretary', 'State', 'John', 'Foster', 'Dulles', 'CIA', 'Director', 'Allen', 'Dulles', 'supported', 'plans', 'coup', 'overthrew', 'democratically', 'elected', 'President', 'Jacobo', 'Arbenz', 'who', 'sought', 'nationalize', 'lands', 'held', 'United', 'Fruit', 'process', 'America', 'devastated', 'Guatemala', 'hope', 'securing', 'future', 'based', 'justice', 'progress', 'Roth', 'screenplay', 'fiction', 'claimed', 'Eisenhower', 'administration', '1954', 'Arbenz', 'served', 'agent', 'Soviet-styled', 'communism', 'therefore', 'removal', 'was', 'essential', 'national', 'security', 'United', 'States', 'part', 'film', 'do', 'see', 'evidence', 'integration', 'vital', 'literature', 'pertaining', 'CIA', 'global', 'actions', 'such', 'Miles', 'Copeland', 'Game', 'Nations', 'William', 'Crane', 'Eveland', 'Ropes', 'Sand', 'Phillip', 'Agee', 'Company', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'Search', 'Enemies', 'Roth', 'refer', 'certain', 'aspects', 'America', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'fiasco', 'affords', 'so', 'little', 'historical', 'information', 'subject', 'are', 'unable', 'analyze', 'informed', 'critical', 'way.In', 'assessing', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'one', 'should', 'bear', 'mind', 'Samuel', 'Johnson', 'wise', 'adage', 'patriotism', 'last', 'refuge', 'scoundrel', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'Edward', 'Wilson', 'emerges', 'Roth', 'script', 'unfortunate', 'bland', 'global', 'automaton', 'who', 'career', 'class', 'placing', 'considerations', 'state', 'interest', 'far', 'family', 'character', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'novel', 'oblivious', 'moral', 'conundrums', 'inherent', 'implementation', 'CIA', 'policies.Sadly', 'are', 'afforded', 'so', 'little', 'information', 'pertaining', 'critical', 'issues', 'events', 'countries', 'people', 'corporations', 'true', 'philosophical', 'quandary', 'involving', 'main', 'character', 'goals', 'never', 'emerges', 'script', 'none', 'depth', 'insight', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'novel', 'Alas', 'final', 'analysis', 'care', 'very', 'little', 'Wilson', 'are', 'left', 'disjointed', 'glimpse', 'life', 'global', 'functionary', 'who', 'devoid', 'soul', 'are', 'none', 'better', 'having', 'made', 'pointless', 'journey']",N/A

It tries to be that but these attributes should not be confused with a thin plot supported by a sound track that seems to be in every scene making noises for no reason, disjoined scenes, dark sets and minimal dialogue. It could have been good if the plot and characters were fleshed out. I've watched it three times and the film becomes thinner and the backing track even more pervasive and annoying. A chance was missed with this one.This film is often compared with the Constant Gardener (that did have a plot which needed following). But leaving people confused is not deep film making.

It is an iteresting piece about the beginning of the CIA and the conflicts early on in the cold war. The movie is a reflection of an agents life from his beginning in the military intelligence in WWII to him signing on with the CIA.  Its done in a number of flashback, and the main film is taking place after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba back in mid april 1961.  A lot of stories to try and pick up on, lots of double crossing plots etc, but in the end I was left dissappointed. I thought the plot gave itself up earlier than expected, and then the movie just kinda ended, just fizzling out. It was a long film 2 H 49 min, and I think at the end of the film some big things happened, but just got drug out as the rest of the film did.  Just to long, lost its pizazz, and really wattered down what could have been great.  Could have been condensed to about 2 hours and still been good.
