I started watching. It is what my generation used to call ""an experience."" In other words, I can give you some arbitrary description of events and so forth which might give you some sense of storylines, characters, etc. and it won't come close to what it actually is about - in particular what it is about for you.I've seen it now about 4 times. My boyfriend who has a hard time watching an hour of television in one sitting couldn't stop watching. After I got the series from Amazon we ended up watching nothing else. It was like a book he couldn't put down (and he's not a reader either). We watched the entire 5 years in marathon chunks until the end! Now he keeps saying that he misses the Fishers. Again, like a really good book that you hate to turn the last page on . . .Buying from Amazon: I actually received the whole series two Christmas's ago from [...]. There was something wrong with some of the DVD's so I returned it. They assured me that they had several in stock so I got a gift certificate for another set and thought I'd be walking out with it. Nope, they have some sort of inventory quirk and then I found out they won't turn a gift certificate into cash-even if you have the original product receipt. (Their representative told me, ""You might just use the money to go and buy drugs!"" Huh?!) I got groceries for Christmas that year . . .I KNEW by buying it from Amazon that I would be able to return it, exchange it, etc. no problem! It is because I know that I have their guarantees that I have bought so many gift DVD's here. And THIS is the BEST PRICE I've seen it at - and I have been looking! (This is the only place that I found that you can get it home for under $[...])So, it is an incredible (historic) series worth the bragging power of having not only seen it but having it as part of your collection.

971401,A3MIV4J4NA6YAK,B000EBGF4U,"C.D. Fasano ""Clarice""","[2, 2]","Six Feet Under is a series which takes place in a family owned funeral home. It is brilliant in every aspect of its production. I liked it so much, that when I had to leave the full series in storage to live with family, I bought another full series, if that is any indication of my opinion of the series. None of my family, nor their friends would watch this - they would be mortified.I liked it because it did not back away from any ""taboo"" subject. One subject focused on heavily is sexuality. They showed open homosexuality, which should be shown more often as the majority of Americans would get used to the fact that it is natural.  The next area was promiscuity. One man dies from auto-erotic asphyxia. Moreover, there are incestuous feelings between Nate's girlfriend Brenda initiated by her brother. Also, heavy drug use pervades the series.There are graphic physical scenes as well. For example, a work accident of being chopped up in a mixer.  So one must have a strong stomach to watch the series.Then there is the Fischer family.  One of the primary characters, Mr. Fischer, the father of the clan, is killed in the first episode and re-appears frequently as seen through the eyes of their teen-aged daughter Claire and his grown sons Nate and David. However, his wife cannot see him after death.  They have an assistant, Rico, in the embalming laboratory.The series weaves in and out of their struggles, that are somewhat unusual; after all, it is a funeral home.  But if you keep an open mind you may be very entertained; if you already have an open mind, then buy at least series one, and if you don't even want to hear any profane words, believe that sex outside of marriage is a sin, that homosexuality is an abomination, then don't go any further than this review.",5,Brilliance is a brilliance does,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,1783,"['Six', 'Feet', 'series', 'place', 'family', 'owned', 'funeral', 'home', 'brilliant', 'aspect', 'production', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'had', 'leave', 'full', 'series', 'storage', 'live', 'family', 'bought', 'full', 'series', 'indication', 'opinion', 'series', 'None', 'family', 'friends', 'would', 'watch', 'would', 'be', 'mortified.I', 'liked', 'did', 'not', 'back', 'away', 'taboo', 'subject', 'One', 'subject', 'focused', 'heavily', 'sexuality', 'showed', 'open', 'homosexuality', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'more', 'often', 'majority', 'Americans', 'would', 'get', 'used', 'fact', 'natural', 'next', 'area', 'was', 'promiscuity', 'One', 'man', 'auto-erotic', 'asphyxia', 'Moreover', 'are', 'incestuous', 'feelings', 'Nate', 'girlfriend', 'Brenda', 'initiated', 'brother', 'Also', 'heavy', 'drug', 'use', 'series.There', 'are', 'graphic', 'physical', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'example', 'work', 'accident', 'being', 'chopped', 'up', 'mixer', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'strong', 'stomach', 'watch', 'series.Then', 'Fischer', 'family', 'One', 'primary', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Fischer', 'father', 'clan', 'killed', 'first', 'episode', 're-appears', 'frequently', 'seen', 'eyes', 'teen-aged', 'daughter', 'Claire', 'grown', 'sons', 'Nate', 'David', 'However', 'wife', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'death', 'have', 'assistant', 'Rico', 'embalming', 'laboratory.The', 'series', 'weaves', 'struggles', 'are', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'funeral', 'home', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'entertained', 'already', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'then', 'buy', 'least', 'series', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'hear', 'profane', 'words', 'believe', 'sex', 'marriage', 'sin', 'homosexuality', 'abomination', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'review']",N/A

And she's right! Several of the HBO series, including Deadwood, Carnivale, The Wire, Entourage, and the ever popular Sex in the City, become an addiction long before you realize it's happened, especially when you watch the whole season quickly. And if you're a power watcher like me, nothing validates the experience like the special features reel. Obviously, each one of the shows offers something different, and in many cases, something special, but none of them slow roasts as much emotion from the viewer as Six Feet Under. Even Sex in the City lets you off the hook emotionally by providing closure with each episode. More than most shows, SFU embraces flaws by familiarizing the audience with the single human element common to us all; limited time. And that's where SFU, which introduces each episode with the end of someone's life, is so compelling. With every episode, SFU reminds us that life is a finite gift, and in the end, the fragrance of our passions and the bold decisions born therein are etched in the memories of the people in our lives forever. It reminds us; regardless of background, we all open the doors of tomorrow hoping for the best and even though life doesn't always go as planned; that's life!

971410,A34WIP8C3L0SN2,B000EBGF4U,Guy Haynes,"[1, 1]","I finally finished Six Feet Under in one last five hour marathon that started at midnight and..well you do the maths. It's that sort of show. I was intending to take this boxset at leisure, to let the 63 episodes stretch over a month, but here I am all finished in just under three weeks - if Six Feet Under clearly teaches one thing it is that there isn't any time to hang around, life stops for no one, get a move on you lazy bag of bones......and in that same spirit here is the review, after all there is no time like the present, while everything is fresh in the (sleep deprived) mind. I had some vague memories of watching Six Feet Under when it originally aired way back in the early noughties, nothing as concrete as remembering which exact series or combination of episodes I had watched back then - for the record I think the opening three episodes of the first season, then the second half of the third and the start of the fourth, though I could very easily be wrong! Despite this random approach to my viewing in those days (gimme a break I was about 22 and at the start of a formative and tempestuous relationship!) the show made a lasting impression. There was a complexity to the characters I'd not encountered in any other television program before, many of them were approaching middle age but they were still messy, conflicted, lost and reckless - there was an unflinching honesty there, so despite my teenage girlfriend showing off, predicting plot arcs in advance and poo pooing story lines as unrealistic I couldn't help but be smitten!Six Feet Under primarily focuses on five characters (the Fishers plus Brenda Chenowith) and the five season span, equalling five years in their lives, allows for an unbelievable level of detail, showing their struggles and successes during a period of particular turbulence. Although some would correctly assert that the fundamental focus of the series is on death and coping with grief it would be a real injustice to summarise the show in this way - Six Feet Under touches on most every facet of life. The program is further fleshed out by another ten or so major characters and the casting remains as perfect here as with the five leads, in particular the Chenowith family are extremely well chosen, the likeness between the actors physically and in terms of mannerisms is spookily spot on. The chemistry between siblings Billy and Brenda is so electric you can hardly take your eyes off them when they are on screen together.Some of my favourite scenes are the understated moments of everyday family life, the Fishers sitting around the kitchen table where a raised eyebrow, smirk or exhale of breath can transmit so much. In particular I think it should be emphasised that some viewers consider Six Feet Under to be a dark comedy and while I think that is maybe going a bit far it is certainly true to say there are laughs to be had here. The writers clearly had fun working with the family dynamics between the old fashioned and repressed Ruth, rebelliously teenaged Claire, uptight pursed lipped David and Nate's everyman outsider viewpoint/gently teasing attitude. The way they weaved the tender, the tragic, the intimate and the comical in these scenes is hugely impressive.Despite all these qualities Six Feet Under won't be for everyone, the subject matter frequently cuts close to the bone (drugs, sex, mental illness, etc), the characters will frustrate you if you like to see conventionally mapped journeys of self discovery and self improvement, the conspiracy theorists out there will no doubt cry foul that there are possible liberal/gay/anti religious agendas at work (I don't buy it) and, well, some just can't stomach the depressive and morbid side of things - for many though this show has proven revelatory and I'd go as far as to state that as television series go this might just be the greatest of them all.Saying all this, as much as I love the show there is still one thing that bothers me - I really hope the last thing I picture before shuffling off this mortal coil isn't my own personal Six Feet Under style gravestone message with my name and birth/death dates slowly appearing and fading on a white background...

Alan Ball definitely has his place secured in visual entertainment history.  I especially like the way all the main characters interact in their own fantasies with the mentally-summoned deceased patriarch, Nathaniel Fisher.  The scene early in the series where Nate discovers his father's secret ""getaway"" room that was given by a client in leiu of payment for services, and Nate envisions all the crazed and insane things the old man might have done there, is truly memorable.  The main actors also have fantasy interactions with others deceased, both loved ones and funeral home clients, and I'll bet it's no coincidence that this same concept is used with similar effect in Michael Hall's current series, Dexter.The last 10-15 minutes of the final episode, where the future is projected for all the main characters while Claire is driving off to seek her dreams, is one of the most emotionally stunning segments I have ever seen on TV or film.  If you can watch it without getting an enourmous lump in your throat or tears flowing, you have more control than I.  It is exquisite almost beyond description.

971415,AF0G67MITCN65,B000EBGF4U,"I. Sidhu ""Cylon God.""","[0, 0]","When ""Six Feet Under"" first aired in 2001, people were adamant about the idea of a Family-Run Funeral home, of which is supposed to make good television drama and with its satirical dark humour and very real characters. It seemed like a lot to gauge for a show that would constantly display death. Then again, death is a touchy subject to everyone, where do we go, what of the soul and more importantly, how we deal with it, and do we ever deal with it.Funnily enough the idea for this show is original, who ever had the idea first wins in that respect; they get to clarify an unlooked upbringing of a Family Business and way of life for those who `cater' the dearly departed.Result; This great show has introduced us to the Fisher Family. A lovable, quirky, witty retort type of what can be called ""dysfunctional"" clique, which would evidently be used as a comparison for future generations of TV clans.You may think it would be depressing, when in fact the show is surrounded in clairvoyance. The episodic structure follows that of some random loved (or unloved) person dying at the beginning of the episode through to the eventuality that the Fishers are the one who take care of the recently passed.The Cast; An excellently played bunch of mishaps that are such a winning clich&eacute; with each other that they come together to depict an idea of family. Peter Krause plays older extroverted son Nate Fisher Jr., named after his dearly departed father who starts off the first series (season). Nate is not built for the job but finds that being drafted as funeral director may have its merits. Nate also introduces us to his on and off love of his life Brenda Chenowith (Rachel Griffiths) whom is an Australian actor with a killing worked state-side accent. She's a pious talking sexually inhibited deviant and we love her, and she develops into a wonderfully woven character.Middle child now fully licensed Funeral Director David Fisher (Michael C. Hall) a character pushed into a business role vacated by a late father, but doesn't gloat and makes it worth something to him. He plays the in-closet Homosexual whom is seeing his supportive and well played character and partner to be Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick). The grieving mother and wife, quirky and lovable Ruth Fisher, played by Frances Conroy who's variety of theatre acting pays off every little bit. And finally the youngest Claire Fisher, played by the gorgeous Lauren Ambrose, who just about reflects teenage life without giving off the false sense of adolescence played by stereotypical teens in say The OC. The inevitable wild-child, whose dalliances with an array of class A substances give us a comedy and just all round fun experiences.Families on TV, especially American TV could learn much from this, and have. It's easy to spot the similarities in shows like ""Dirty Sexy Money"", ""Dexter"" and ""Brothers & Sisters"". TV drama found a mark that explored more boundaries than Scott Bakula did in Quantum Leap, more frontiers than Star Trek.It's hard to go back to the atypical TV-centred families of so called modern life. A dark satirical backdrop of a Family-Run Funeral home opens up a more accurate approximation of current life and all its density.Verdict:Short but sweet, stays with you like the memory of a loved one. 10/10.

From the opening theme (one of the best ever composed) through the largely sudden deaths that begin each episode to the rapport of the highly dysfunctional Fisher family, ""Six Feet Under"" deserves every award it ever received and then some.Each character in the show brings an important contribution to the family entity. Over time it's likely that the viewer will come to appreciate one character more than another but my favorite is Claire. She matures wonderfully throughout the five-year run and it is fitting that the series ends with her.While the dialogue occasionally lapses into melodrama, that's probably because the Fisher family is emotive with which to begin. Who wouldn't be, with a funeral home at its core? The final few episodes are so delicately handled that it was almost a shame to see the series end.""Six Feet Under"" is as innovative as they come, displaying great emotional character depth and latitude.

Someone dies at the beginning of each segment, and the Fishers handle the funeral.  This is a perfect drama for death-denying Americans.  No punches are pulled, with very little off-limits as the Fishers struggle with one another and with their partners and friends as they explore life in Los Angeles, which includes sex, drugs, and the latest in awakening workshops.

It has a quality that makes you feel like you are one of the family as you watch it, and I miss this show a lot. The most amazing thing about this show is that it deals with death, and when the show ended I was so sad almost like a whole bunch of people I really knew just died. Even today I still mourn the show. Very effective. The last episode was amazing, as it tied everything up neatly. The only complaint I had is that the makeup looked really bad in that last episode, but I am willing to forgive that because the story and the characters are so way above and beyond anything that a little bad makeup job can do nothing to spoil Six Feet Under. You really get into this show and it sort of becomes part of your life. To say the show is addicting is only pointing out the obvious.

But in my case its true (yes I know, I've got to get a life!). I've just finished watching the last episode of the box set ""Six Feet Under-The Complete Series Gift Set"". It took me a little over a year and a half to watch all 25 discs, which held 5 seasons, made up of 63 episodes (plus oodles of extras). In the last 10 minutes of watching the series, I bawled my eyes out like a little baby! Maybe I just watch to much darn televsion, but I love this show!Why would a TV show about the dysfunctional lives of the Fishers, a family, that runs a Los Angeles funeral home cause such an emotional response in me? Isn't it just a TV show? Well yeah...but it is so much more! This show really represents to me, the pinnacle of how good television entertainment and storytelling in general can be. It really feels like you get inside the lives of the Fisher family and share a rollercoaster-like, emotional journey with them as they confront life, death and all the messy stuff that comes in-between.This show is dramatic, funny, literate and really the best, that will come out of the TV medium. This is mainly due to the creative vision of Creator/Executive Producer, Alan Ball, who had the guts and the talent to pull something like this off. He hired an amazing cast of actors, who presented us with characters, who were multi-faceted and believable. They breathed life into scripts, that were both literate and entertaining, filled with depth and meaning. Even the more technical aspects such as cinematography, editing, special effects and use of musical scores/songs are consistantly first rate.I think HBO has shown a great deal of care in releasing this series to DVD. The picture and sound quality are great. The DVD menus are quite creative and even beautiful. Each season has lots of extras, spread out between the twenty five discs, including a number of short documentaries and select commentaries from the show's directors, writers and actors. The commentaries vary in quality, the best coming from Series Creator, Alan Ball. This should be like ""mannah from heaven"" for any true fan of the show.The individual DVD releases have now been packaged together in ""Six Feet Under-The Complete Series Gift Set"". This is the most economical way to own all 5 seasons. The packaging is a cube, that is made to look like a manicured grave/funeral plot. Its' pretty neat looking (and heavy!) but is also quite fragile and the design makes it a little difficult to extract the individual seasons. The gift set also includes a small memoriam book with character obituaries/photos as well as two previously released sountrack CDS (both fastastic!). If you don't already own the individual seasons, then this box set is highly recommended.I was sort of sad, that I finished seeing all 63 episodes. Even though the last few minutes of the series are mind blowing, the show is addictive leaving you wanting more. But all good things must end. (I guess thats why they named the last season ""Everything Ends"".) Well, the great thing about DVD is that you can start it all over. Time to put Season 1 back into the ol' DVD player...",5,"""Hey, When You Mix Up the Letters For 'Funeral' You Get 'Real Fun'!

Kind of like the experience of life itself. The characters that wind their way into your heart can both endear themselves to you with their capacity to struggle with some measure of dignity through life's profound challenges and then annoy you to the point where you wonder if you can put up with anymore with their misdirected anger; self-absorption and narcissism. Nate, for eg., could be positively inspiring with his insight and empathy for some grieving and injured soul. Or he could infuriate you with his blistering, self-righteous tirades against others who crossed him or that he did not understand, including the ones that he both loves . . . and betrays. Sometimes, it's all one big mess with no easy answers and a lot of not fully satisfied questions. Sometimes, we are easy with our fellow travelers and then, within a flash, very uneasy. Yet, we are are bound together in the mystery of life and, uncompromisingly, tied to its end. And there is something wonderful, despite the pain; the loss and multiple missteps.

971436,A1HHY7EFRT2KGQ,B000EBGF4U,"klavierspiel ""klavierspiel""","[16, 18]","It seemed sad but fitting when HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" came to an end in 2005 after five seasons, because it was, after all, a series that forced the viewer to confront the reality that everything ends. Thus it is ironic that, this being the early twenty-first century, television series, good and bad, never die but enter an eternal afterlife of reruns in syndication and on video. If they are especially fortunate they are rewarded with the treatment ""Six Feet Under"" gets here.Viewers who are aghast at the bowdlerized, commercial-infested version running at present on the Bravo network can take luxurious refuge in this deluxe reissue of the entire five seasons, sixty-three complete and uncut episodes, in one, surprisingly heavy (like a body, one imagines) package. They can settle down and enjoy the sharply drawn characters, the infallibly tuned dialogue and mordant humor of life at the Fisher family's funeral home. Looking at the series again one appreciates anew the uniformly brilliant acting, the attention to detail and the carefully composed visuals that make watching this series unlike any previous television experience. I do not think it is overstating the case to say that Alan Ball in this series created a world of Shakespearean scope, where the dead walk, speak, interact with, quarrel with and ultimately enlighten and comfort the still living.The willingness to find laughter in subjects that are normally treated, if acknowledged at all, with a kind of reverent dread may offend some, notably those of the same mentality that have prohibited photographing coffins of soldiers killed in Iraq; all others will see Ball's vision for what is, an affirmation of life and joy in the face of all possible heartache and discouragement.Seeing the episodes themselves is so satisfying that the extra features, dare one say it, seem barely necessary. Still it is good to hear Ball, the cast, and the writers speak about the show in interviews and voice-over commentary. For all fans of top notch television and drama in general, this box set is an essential item.",5,Brilliant show in a deluxe package,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,2079,"['seemed', 'sad', 'fitting', 'when', 'HBO', 'Six', 'Feet', 'came', 'end', '2005', 'five', 'seasons', 'was', 'series', 'forced', 'viewer', 'confront', 'reality', 'everything', 'ends', 'Thus', 'ironic', 'being', 'early', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'television', 'series', 'good', 'bad', 'never', 'die', 'enter', 'eternal', 'afterlife', 'reruns', 'syndication', 'video', 'are', 'especially', 'fortunate', 'are', 'rewarded', 'treatment', 'Six', 'Feet', 'here.Viewers', 'who', 'are', 'aghast', 'bowdlerized', 'commercial-infested', 'version', 'running', 'present', 'Bravo', 'network', 'can', 'take', 'luxurious', 'refuge', 'deluxe', 'reissue', 'entire', 'five', 'seasons', 'sixty-three', 'complete', 'uncut', 'episodes', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'heavy', 'body', 'one', 'imagines', 'package', 'can', 'settle', 'down', 'enjoy', 'sharply', 'drawn', 'characters', 'infallibly', 'tuned', 'dialogue', 'mordant', 'humor', 'life', 'Fisher', 'family', 'funeral', 'home', 'Looking', 'series', 'again', 'one', 'uniformly', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'attention', 'detail', 'carefully', 'composed', 'visuals', 'make', 'watching', 'series', 'previous', 'television', 'experience', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'overstating', 'case', 'say', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'series', 'created', 'world', 'Shakespearean', 'scope', 'where', 'dead', 'walk', 'speak', 'interact', 'quarrel', 'ultimately', 'enlighten', 'comfort', 'still', 'willingness', 'find', 'laughter', 'subjects', 'are', 'normally', 'treated', 'acknowledged', 'kind', 'reverent', 'dread', 'may', 'offend', 'notably', 'same', 'mentality', 'have', 'prohibited', 'photographing', 'coffins', 'soldiers', 'killed', 'Iraq', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'Ball', 'vision', 'what', 'affirmation', 'life', 'joy', 'face', 'possible', 'heartache', 'discouragement.Seeing', 'episodes', 'so', 'satisfying', 'extra', 'features', 'dare', 'one', 'say', 'seem', 'barely', 'necessary', 'Still', 'good', 'hear', 'Ball', 'cast', 'writers', 'speak', 'show', 'interviews', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'fans', 'top', 'notch', 'television', 'drama', 'general', 'box', 'set', 'essential', 'item']",N/A

The show is also a lesson about life and living. Although the focus is on death and funeral industry, the real message is about what we do with our lives when we are alive.

971444,AK9UPC78LIPIR,B000EBGF4U,maelje,"[2, 2]","I remember watching the pilot of ""Six Feet Under"" way back in June 2001 (God, how long ago that seems) and marveling at how good it was. There were only a couple of things about it that gave me pause -- it wasn't that I didn't LIKE the fake commercials for mortuary products, but I did think they harmed the tone a little bit. And I wasn't sure about the characters; some of them, including younger Fisher brother David, seemed rather selfish and self-absorbed. Overall, though, every element was good -- acting, script, direction, characters.Yet I really don't think I believed at that point that ""Six Feet Under"" would become one of the best TV shows of all time, or that it would emerge as my personal favorite over all others. That's right -- I believe ""Six Feet Under"" was THE greatest drama in the history of television. The show ""found"" itself very, very quickly; after just three or four episodes, I knew it wasn't something I ever wanted to miss. And it just got stronger, season after season, for four years.This set presents all five seasons, and if it doesn't qualify as ""keeper"" home theater, I don't know what would. Well, the blu-ray version, I guess. Anyone know when we might be getting that?For all my enthusiasm about the show, I can't say I ever ""fell in love"" with the Fisher family. They were too dysfunctional. Ruth, the mother, could be very uptight. Nate, the older son, came off as one of those folks who project confidence but are tormented inside. David seemed to be playing the role of the dutiful son who stuck with the family funeral business that Nate fled, but as I've observed, he also could be quite selfish -- without even realizing it. And Claire, the daughter ... poor Claire. Confused, angry, experimenting with drugs -- a true teen-aged misfit. (Then again, aren't they all? Isn't ""teen-aged misfit"" redundant?)But that was the great thing about the series: It presented a family that was real. Their flaws helped define them, just as our own mistakes and missteps and shortcomings help define us as human beings.The characters outside the family circle were just as good. Keith, David's partner, struggling to get David OK with the idea of coming out even though David still felt a need to stay in the closet. Brenda, who begins as nothing more than a fling and ends up in a serious relationship with him. And the ghost or image or ... whatever he is ... of the recently deceased Nathaniel Fisher Sr., the family patriarch who is killed in the pilot when his brand-new hearse is hit by a bus.I could say all kinds of good things about this show, but what its considerable appeal really came down to was the characters. Eleven years after saying goodbye to them, I still miss them. I still think about them; it's as if they are among the people I've lost to death in the last decade or so.Purchase this set and watch this show. I doubt very seriously you'll be disappointed. And when you get to the series finale, savor it -- it's probably the greatest series finale in TV ... oh, you know the rest. But don't skip ahead to it. Watch every single episode that precedes it, in chronological order. That's the only way to get the maximum impact out of this show. Trust me.

I heard from many friends that this was one great show I had to check out. I never had any interest of watching this show when it was on HBO. I wish I would have given it a chance when it was still on the air. I just completed watching all five seasons and it took me a little over a month to do it. The first few episodes made me wonder if this show was even worth getting, but after the first 2 episodes I was hooked. The show is about the Fisher family who own a funeral home. Every episode starts out with a death and sets the tone for that show. I have seen many TV shows, but no other show has dealt with life and how we deal with it like this show does. The characters on Six Feet Under are not all just white folks. The show has a great balance of ethnicity and diversity. You get characters who are gay, latino, black, and many others(some with major issues). This show has some of the best acting I have ever seen. If you're like me you're probably thinking a show about a family that owns a funeral home? This show is so much more than that. I like the fact that this show takes you on a journey with the characters, and as each season passes the show just gives you more twists and turns. The very last episode of this series is one of the best hours and most emotional hours of TV I have ever watched. After you see the last episode you will know that life is a gift and appreciate it more than ever.

971467,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B000EBGF4U,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[11, 14]","I watched all the dvd's, not including bonus features or commentaries, in 6 days. I was simply entranced by the sophisticated writing, the relevance of the plot and the complexity of the characters. I found myself going to the discussion group over at HBO to see what other people thought about those things i had questions about. During my headlong rush to see what was next i missed one episode and as i thought about it i knew something was unanswered and searched through the episode descriptions to find and eventually watch it. Which really shows a pretty good continuity and internal coherence to the series.The first question i have is why invest 70+ hours in 6 days to watch a TV show? The short answer is that afaik this is unique.It's more than the importance of the major issues: what is death? visions of our own mortality. what is life in the face of certain death? what does it mean to be family? what does committment mean? how do we go about fixing ourselves, making ourselves better as we age? what does it mean to a kid to grow up in a funeral home, with bodies in the basement, what does it do to them?Much of it has to do with the complexity of the issues, the relevance of death and dying to me personally, the ability of the writers to really say something in so many hours of movie making work.But mostly it's about me connecting to the characters, feeling as if the ideas presented are significant to me, that the questions posed are my questions that i need to answer for myself. Simply put, it spoke directly to me.I am certainly a child of the TV era, but i am primarily a word and print person, my imagination is more captivating than any show can possibly be. I'm all about words, not so much spoken as written and reverberating in my head. So why did i connect so strongly with this series? Partly because i've reached the age where friends and relatives around me are dying, most of my parent's generation are gone, all of my friends from their generation have died. I've come to grips with most of the issues surrounding my folks death and my own impending mortality, so why is this such an continuing issue?It's because the show is not only about dying, death, dealing with grief but it is about life and growing up in the shadow of death, living with the realization that death is in the basement. It is as if the authors had the Book of Ecclesiastes open in front of them the whole time they were discussing and writing the script. What is man that Thou art mindful of him?(Psalm 8:4) All is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun? One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.(Ecc 1:2-4) For the main theme is living in the face of death, finding meaning to go on alone in the face of grief, and how to bear the trials of this life, knowing you will die and your sacrifices and tears fade away as will your memory in those that remain (temporarily) behind. For funerals are for the living, but about the dead and rebuilding lives without them in it.For me, primarily a religious person, these issues strike to the core of my faith, those things i have tossed about in my head for so many sleepless, agonizing dark nights wrestling with these things. But the series itself is not particularly religious, despite the questions asked being ""typically a religious type"" of inquiry. The major character-Brenda is thoroughly secular and often voices the viewpoint of a materialist faith that we poof appear, live and suffering, then die and are gone. She is sure that whatever the meaning of this existence, she will have to find it or invent it for herself, there is no god to impart saving knowledge, things just are. It's not that there aren't religious voices in the series, but they are peripheal, Buddhist monks chanting, Quakers sitting in silence, Black gospel singing and clapping at a funeral joyously, vigorously. But these are irrelevant to the main characters, something they see but don't participate in or think about. (Nate does think about Quakers, but the attraction is that silence is so different than the constant voices in his head, not that this faith answers his longings) So there really is no voice in the series asking and answering these great questions in the way that my faith community would do. So why connect with it?So what does it mean to grow up with death in the basement? how do we come to grips with our own mortality and still be able to function in this world until then?What does it mean to live in the shadow of death? How can there be meaning and significance to my life, when i will leave the world and everything i've worked so hard for, behind?The series offers a few ways that the main characters answered these existential questions.Claire has the escape from the pain and consciousness with drugs, with excitement and that adrenalin rush, but mostly the hope and satisfaction that comes from creativity, the wonder of expressing the artist and bringing your insides outside for all the world to stare at. Ruth has service and self sacrifice, the role of the suffering servant forever taking care of someone else, but she sees the problems inherent in not answering your own questions(this is the way my mom lived as well). David tries to lose himself in a self sacrifical love confused with sexuality and conquest, and devotes a significant part of his life simply to hard and careful work, his calling of a funeral director and later sacrificing for his family(this was my dad's answer). These are common alternatives and the writers do us a great service by laying out those pathways and their strengths and shortcomings. Allowing us to see and feel the path that each of them took, making these ways of living life in the shadow of death more visual and more viseral.But it is Brenda's and Nate's lives that are the most complex, the most demanding, similar to the ones i struggle with. Brenda is intellectual, verbal, deeply feeling, rebellious, often just plain pissed off at everything and everyone in general. Nate is more emotional, more driven by passion and the escape of seduction, conquest and physical release, much less introspective, only dimly aware of what drives him, or what he really wants. But aware that things really aren't right but unable to connect with how to fix them. But neither one of them really achieves that intimacy that they crave, although for different reasons. Neither one can really sustain a relationship, to love without losing oneself, to sacrifice without regret, to give without hesitation or expectation that it will be returned. Neither one is really very happy, or content, rather both are fighting and frightened, angry and sad, confused but certain they are right and that the other is just plain wrong.Everyone in the series is crazy and unstable but Keith. Life has wounded them all, damaged and twisted them into less than optimal ways to greet each morning. All will be buried with both friends and enemies surrounding them, those they've given to and others they've just taken from. They are sympathetically drawn for us, but their kids will like just like them, both hating and loveing their folks, wondering why they are so screwed up, and in their turn-ask these same questions that these characters did with their lives displayed for us on screen.One generation follows another, we bury our parents and hope our children will in their turn, bury us, the world turns, the funeral home opens for business everyday but Christmas (and for enough $$ it will open even then) and there is nothing new under the sun. All things are in flux, the only constant is change, the best we can do is hobble through life leaning on those who love us, and in turn, supporting them as best we can.It is an existentialist answer-lots of Brenda's with a bit of Nate's, a sprinkling of Claires and a heaping helping of Ruth's, with David's holding it all together.I'm better off having seen the series, having cried deeply at places, to have remembered my own dead, but their answer(s) will not satisfy my deepest humanity's longings nor will it anyone else's, but they are the dominant answers given to us in our culture today. so how do i live in the shadow of death?",5,"how do you grow up with dead people in your basement and funerals in your home?,",1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,8272,"['watched', 'dvd', 'not',

971472,A2QAUMR0V33GC9,B000EBGF4U,"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic""","[0, 0]","This is one hefty piece of television history, and specially priced so's you won't feel cheated either.  We all know the common complaint about HBO boxed sets; they're too overpriced for what you get.  I agree, especially when you compare them to other hot boxed sets from other networks.  Here, you get them all - every single season of a great TV show - plus a couple of nifty added extras all wrapped up in a package that'll be fun explaining to others who never quite saw the show when it was running.What can be said about ""Six Feet Under"" that hasn't been said already?  Not too much, except that it's truly one-of-a-kind.  The production values were extremely high, the cast first rate, the stories (usually) well-written and intersting, and a plot conceit that wouldn't have been touched by the broadcast networks (and even quite a few of the basic cable ones) with a two-yard stick.  Yet, at it's heart, we have the story of an American family struggling through its many real-life struggles.People will always remember the show as ""the funeral home"" series.  Those who haven't really watched it anyway.  They're missing quite a lot.  The free spirited ""prodigal son,"" the repressed closeted gay brother, the eccentric sister, and the controlled/repressed mom are set against each other in a family business that demands repressed respect for their clients.  Cool.  With any other setting, you'd already have a potential hit.  However, it's the touchstone OF the funeral industry that makes it just a bit more than fascinating.  Particularly in the unblinking way they show the business.  Most people don't know, care, or WANT to know what happens in a funeral parlor.  Alan Ball and his merry crew show us in as unblinking detail as he shows us the foibles of the main characters just HOW we end our lives here on Earth.  Religion and spirituality aside, it's quite a ride.  Sometimes hard to look at, sometimes poignant, sometimes blackly funny, but ALWAYS with reverence and respect, the viewer gets to witness the end of life in a way that is unbearibly direct.  The strange thing is that it's also with a hint of bizarre beauty.The extras are also eye-opening (well, except for the ""in-depth"" analysis of season 3) and show how much work went into making this phenomena of television.  It always looks easy when we watch it, but the actors (my favorites being Peter Krouse and Freddy Rodriguez), writers, directors, and producers bust their collective butts off making the show as engrossing as it is.  The soundtracks are a welcome addition, and the ""memorial book"" wraps up everything we want to know about our favorite Fischers in a way they'd want to be remembered.'Tis worth the purchase, even if you already own one of the season sets already.

The very last show of the series is most likely one of the best series finales in television history.

I pretty much knew where it was going to go, in terms of big climax, cos it was just so well written and so unconventional in its ace writing style that it couldn't NOT go there. I won't spoil it, but as it's a show about death you have to know from the beginning that sooner or later you are going to experience a major character death. And yet it's so much more than that. Some of the details for how the characters and plot arrived were superfluous, silly or just flat out of character at times. But for the most part the writing was tight, the characters dreams to develop, the plot dead-on (no pun). I have never seen anything on television deal with death as frankly as this show.

971477,A3UNGGV9D2UVQY,B000EBGF4U,Stephane Lauzon,"[9, 10]","I chose to review the whole series instead of one season in particular because for me owning or watching one or two season is like watching half of a movie. The reason is simple, it may be true that the two first seasons are the most entertaining and funny but for a character development series like this, the third season is the year that Alan Ball starts focusing more on each character instead of giving us a bigger picture like the two firsts seasons. Now we know about the technic aspects of the mortuary profession and in my opinion what's to come is more cerebral and complex because we know the surface of the characters and now we start entering their minds and we become more attached to them. What is wonderful about this series is that the character development lasts about 60 hours (5 seasons) so if well made, it's way better than a movie that gives us 2 hours of that and it is, in deed, well made. I love every season of this wonderful series and I think the payoff at the end of the 5th season is nothing less than a masterpiece of tv making. The last 3 episodes of season 5 are simply sublime and I've never felt so much emotions for a fictionnal work in my life. Some movies or books move me but when you live with these people for 5 years, they become almost like family. Another thing I like is that the series felt more cinematic than anything I've seen before, the visual is quite special for television and it made me think about silent movies a lot which I am a fan of. So I recommand 6FU to everybody because another great thing of the series is that character from every generation is developped from teenage to old age. I would say though that young teenagers may find it too complex and older people too offensive but if you're from 30 to 50 years old and you like character development and the visual aspect of movie making to make a point, you will love six feet under. This series will become a classic because it broke so many barriers and people will talk about it in 200 years. It's expensive but if you can afford it, it's a great document to have. Now 3 little complaints, there's not enough extras, the first 2 seasons are not widescreen and no english subtitles in season 1 , only spanish????

I definitely wanted that.  If you want it all to come in one set, I suggest getting the gift set.2.  Paper sleeves have a tendency to scratch DVDs.This is a personal preference thing.  I just want to protect my stuff, and I don't think these protect as well as the plastic cases.  Yes, WAY more space efficient, but I'd rather have the protection than the space efficiency.3.  The commentaries are the best from Allen Ball.The creator of the show, who also wrote ""American Beauty"" (which I highly recommend), made the most interesting commentaries.  The other writers are... not as interesting.  At least not to me.  There's a fun one with both Michael Hall and Lauren Ambrose in season 5.  And they were just like little kids or teenagers making commentaries and having their own awkward moments during their time on the episode, which is wildly funny to me.4.

I had to get this!!I can't think of anything more horrible than having to watch someone die and bury them. Be it a child, parent, sibling, or friend, the experience of death touches people in different ways. I think SFU explored about every aspect of death, how people relate to it, deal with it (or don't in some cases), and embrace it as part of life.I connected with the Fisher's, as many people have. I knew their pain, felt their joy, experienced their rage, and still have a lot to learn about myself. The Fisher's have shown me that I'm not alone in my thinking, that there are other people out there who go through the same thoughts I do (even if they're just characters in a TV show), and whom I can learn from. Sure they work in a funeral home & meet people at their most vulnerable & weak. But the Fisher's, through their lives dealing with the dead, rip through the core of matters that people don't like to talk about. We see that even fictional life isn't perfect, and there are consequences for everything. We learn about what's most important in our lives, our dreams & desires, our family, ourselves. And it's what makes us human. We all will die.I'm blown away by the acting in this series. Every single member of the cast (even those with only seconds of screen time) gives it their all & it shows. The writing is the best of anything I've ever seen. The music moves us to cry, to clothes our eyes and remember a time when that song played before, what life was like.If you'd prefer a fantasyworld where everyone makes it out of the fire, no one ever dies, the hero always shows up just in time, and the villan gets what he deserves, then go somewhere else for entertainment. This show is as real as it gets, as ugly as it gets, as sad as it gets, and as beautiful as it gets.

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[185, 214]","It is essentially impossible to write an appropriate review for this engaging, amazing, wicked, dark, and realistic series that graced the television landscape for the first half of the new millinimum.  Considered by many critics and fans alike as ""the best television series to grace the small screen,"" SIX FEET UNDER was the prenimulate HBO series: it featureted everything that the HBO names expects (sex, drugs, violence, and rock'n'roll) but adds a fresh almost family-friendly twist to the proceedings.The series focuses on the lives of the Fisher family after everything they've ever known is turned upside down with the patriarch of the family dies suddenly in a car crash on Christmas Eve; with the majority of the first season summarizing the families attempt to ""move-on with their lives, and learn that life goes on, forever, until it ends.""  With their fathers death in the pilot, the two oldest children Nate (the rebel, who always ran away from his responsibility) and David (the closeted `good son') take over the family business as their much-younger sister finished her high school years and their mother learns how to continue her life without her husband of 35 years.Throughout five seasons the series focused on this ecletic mix of quirky characters, and the people that come in-and-out of their lives.  And this is where the heart of the series can be found - it is always realistic and while the stories seem far-fetched they are quit the opposite: everything presented in this series is a normal part of the human exsistance, and for the first time SIX FEET UNDER (as a television series) captures the monotomy of human esistance into a seemingly perfect television show.HBO has included all 63 episodes of the series (including the emotion series finale (which I personally consider the single best of hour television I have ever watched) in this one elaborate collection (also including a large booklet that gives the history of the series and a character map, as well as the two previously-released soundtrack CDs).",5,RIP - The Fishers,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,2042,"['essentially', 'impossible', 'write', 'appropriate', 'review', 'engaging', 'amazing', 'wicked', 'dark', 'realistic', 'series', 'graced', 'television', 'landscape', 'first', 'half', 'new', 'millinimum', 'Considered', 'many', 'critics', 'fans', 'alike', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'grace', 'small', 'screen', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'was', 'prenimulate', 'HBO', 'series', 'featureted', 'everything', 'HBO', 'names', 'sex', 'drugs', 'violence', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'fresh', 'almost', 'family-friendly', 'twist', 'proceedings.The', 'series', 'lives', 'Fisher', 'family', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'patriarch', 'family', 'suddenly', 'car', 'crash', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'majority', 'first', 'season', 'summarizing', 'families', 'attempt', 'move-on', 'lives', 'learn', 'life', 'forever', 'fathers', 'death', 'pilot', 'two', 'oldest', 'children', 'Nate', 'rebel', 'who', 'always', 'ran', 'away', 'responsibility', 'David', 'closeted', 'good', 'son', 'take', 'family', 'business', 'much-younger', 'sister', 'finished', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'mother', 'how', 'continue', 'life', 'husband', '35', 'years.Throughout', 'five', 'seasons', 'series', 'focused', 'ecletic', 'mix', 'quirky', 'characters', 'people', 'come', 'in-and-out', 'lives', 'where', 'heart', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'always', 'realistic', 'stories', 'seem', 'far-fetched', 'are', 'quit', 'opposite', 'everything', 'presented', 'series', 'normal', 'part', 'human', 'exsistance', 'first', 'time', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'television', 'series', 'monotomy', 'human', 'esistance', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'television', 'show.HBO', 'included', '63', 'episodes', 'series', 'including', 'emotion', 'series', 'finale', 'personally', 'consider', 'single', 'best', 'hour', 'television', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'one', 'elaborate', 'collection', 'also', 'including', 'large', 'booklet', 'history', 'series', 'character', 'map', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'previously-released', 'soundtrack', 'CDs']",N/A
