1552001,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008FXLZ6W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[19, 22]","After a significant break, Katt Williams returned to the stage in this gala event on New Year's Eve 2011 at the packed Nokia Theater in Los Angeles. ""Kattpacalypse"" is the one hour special that captures this set. It begins with Williams' triumphant entrance that sends the 7000 plus members of the audience into a frenzy and it ends with the ringing in of 2012. Williams starts out like a powerhouse, full of energy and swagger. But as the hour progresses, he seems to get increasingly introspective, angry, and intimate. Williams has certainly seen his share of hard times, and I'd love to hear his story, his views and his perspective on what he's been through. But perhaps this big celebration was not the place. I think that he wanted to be personal and thankful, but the apparent bitterness and the lack of humor at the end of this set made me a little uncomfortable. This may not be your reaction, but I found ""Kattpacalypse"" to be unexpectedly awkward.I won't say that most of the concert wasn't edgy and aggressively funny, it was. Williams attacks the racial divide throughout, highlighting some funny stereotypes with almost every punchline. He tackles broad subjects including religion, the apocalypse, and politics with the extended opening bit being about Obama's presidency. And, for the most part, his jokes land. He works the stage like a maniac, throwing himself around, sliding, and executing some great physical comedy. The immense crowd absolutely loves him and it's hard not to be enthusiastic about seeing him perform again. But after about three really solid bits, the show starts to slow down significantly. Near the last quarter, he seems to have run out of designated material and begins to address the audience in a more personal way. At first, I didn't begrudge this bit of intimacy but it becomes increasingly out-of-place. Just as people want to celebrate midnight, Williams has brought down the energy and enthusiasm with this segment of angry contemplation. Overall, this is mostly a solid concert set. Good on Williams and welcome back! I just wished things would have stayed triumphant and jubilant and funny!

His insightful material, priceless expressions and impeccable delivery make him one of a kind . He is obviously an extremely intelligent man who has an amazing gift and if you look past his comedy and listen to him during interviews you can see he has a heart as big as the audience who loves him. He was a bit more wired up at this performance but was the Katt that I love. The man has been through some very undeserved troubles lately but with his indomnible spirit I know he will continue to make us laugh. His physical comedy and his unique use of the stool as a prob is amazing he really needs to be in many more movies as well as he is a natural comic that has more than earned his right to be at the top of the list. He can make anything funny. The one downside is I was not crazy about the hair, I find Katt to be a very sexy man, his manner his confidence his spirit and his style of dressing are very appealing love how he rocks a tie and suit very classy....but the extreme flip though adding to the mood of the moment....took away from his awesome suit and his handsome face. If you like the truth delivered to you fast, furious and funny, Katt is your man. I have always been a fan of comedy and Katt has carved his own unique spot in its world.
