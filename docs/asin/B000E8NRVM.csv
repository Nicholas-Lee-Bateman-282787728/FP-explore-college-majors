970617,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B000E8NRVM,Andre Dursin,"[0, 0]","Completed in 2001 and released overseas without any ""Tales From the Crypt"" designation, this third feature spin-off from the cable series - produced in association with Miramax - is a surprisingly watchable remake of the RKO Val Lewton classic ""I Walked With a Zombie."" Writer Rob Cohen and director Avi Nesher have fashioned a leisurely paced zombie thriller set in Jamaica, intended initially to re-ignite Jennifer Grey's screen career; the latter didn't happen as ""Ritual"" sat on the shelves for five years domestically before finally landing direct to DVD in 2006. The movie, though, offers a few jolts, Grey looking good (plastic surgery notwithstanding), a campy performance from co-star Tim Curry, and a decent score by Shirley Walker - improbably making it the best of the three ""Crypt"" features. Echo Bridge's Blu-Ray includes a respectable 1080p transfer and 2.0 DTS MA soundtrack; fans should note that the lousy Cryptkeeper segments shown here are completely independent of the film and contain their own separate credits, which is unsurprising since overseas prints of the movie didn't contain those bookending sequences at all (fortunately, the chaptering gives viewers the ability to skip them altogether).",3,"Fascinating Remake of ""I Walked With a Zombie"" with ""Tales From the Crypt"" Branding Slapped On",1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1221,"['Completed', '2001', 'released', 'overseas', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'designation', 'third', 'feature', 'spin-off', 'cable', 'series', 'produced', 'association', 'Miramax', 'surprisingly', 'watchable', 'remake', 'RKO', 'Val', 'Lewton', 'Walked', 'Zombie', 'Writer', 'Rob', 'Cohen', 'director', 'Avi', 'Nesher', 'have', 'fashioned', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'zombie', 'thriller', 'set', 'Jamaica', 'intended', 'initially', 're-ignite', 'Jennifer', 'Grey', 'screen', 'career', 'latter', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Ritual', 'sat', 'shelves', 'five', 'years', 'domestically', 'finally', 'landing', 'direct', 'DVD', '2006', 'movie', 'though', 'few', 'jolts', 'Grey', 'looking', 'good', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'notwithstanding', 'campy', 'performance', 'co-star', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'decent', 'score', 'Shirley', 'Walker', 'improbably', 'making', 'best', 'three', 'Crypt', 'features', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'Blu-Ray', 'respectable', '1080p', 'transfer', '2.0', 'DTS', 'MA', 'soundtrack', 'fans', 'should', 'note', 'lousy', 'Cryptkeeper', 'segments', 'shown', 'here', 'are', 'completely', 'independent', 'film', 'contain', 'own', 'separate', 'credits', 'unsurprising', 'overseas', 'prints', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'contain', 'bookending', 'sequences', 'fortunately', 'chaptering', 'viewers', 'ability', 'skip', 'altogether']",Tales from the Crypt Presents Ritual

First off, it's a bit too long. At an hour and forty five (plus) minutes, the story meanders and ultimately collapses under its own girth. With a decent opening -including a bubbling, melting man (!!)- this could have been a twisted masterwork. Alas, once Jennifer Grey arrives in Jamaica, things bog down in a Nancy Drew-type mystery, minus any real intrigue or thrills. Not even Ms. Grey's tight T-shirts can save this one from mediocrity.

Although his brother claims that he is suffering from a rare blood disease, Wesley is certain that he has become the victim of a dark ritual that would transform him in to a zombie. When his tests return with some questionable results, Dr. Dodgson investigates the alternate causes for his ailments, which will lead her in to a world of superstition and voodoo! Tales from the Crypt returns with another feature-length film, this time taking its base not from the classic EC Comics, but from the 1943 film I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE. RITUAL is everything that Jacques Tourneur's film wasn't, and we mean that in the worst possible way. Director Avi Nesher takes every opportunity to exploit the film using unnecessary shocks, gratuitous gore, and the lure of sex. Given the typical nature of the Tales from the Crypt series, these things would pretty much be expected, but the handling of the material is what drags it down significantly. RITUAL is poorly edited for minimal effect, and filled with weak performances from the entire cast. Despite looking amazing for her age, Jennifer Grey has not improved as an actress in her years since DIRTY DANCING. Cameos by Tim Curry and Erick Avari are wasted, as well. Those who are unfortunate enough to have missed I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE may be surprised in the end, but classicists will immediately dismiss the film as the rubbish that it truly is.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",2,Ritual,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1549,"['former', 'medical', 'doctor', 'position', 'personal', 'aid', 'sickly', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'family', 'estate', 'Jamaica', 'brother', 'claims', 'suffering', 'rare', 'blood', 'disease', 'Wesley', 'certain', 'become', 'victim', 'dark', 'ritual', 'would', 'transform', 'zombie', 'When', 'tests', 'return', 'questionable', 'results', 'Dr.', 'Dodgson', 'alternate', 'ailments', 'will', 'lead', 'world', 'superstition', 'voodoo', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'returns', 'feature-length', 'film', 'time', 'taking', 'base', 'not', 'classic', 'EC', 'Comics', '1943', 'film', 'WALKED', 'ZOMBIE', 'RITUAL', 'everything', 'Jacques', 'Tourneur', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'mean', 'worst', 'possible', 'way', 'Director', 'Avi', 'Nesher', 'opportunity', 'exploit', 'film', 'using', 'unnecessary', 'shocks', 'gratuitous', 'gore', 'lure', 'sex', 'Given', 'typical', 'nature', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'series', 'things', 'would', 'pretty', 'much', 'be', 'expected', 'handling', 'material', 'what', 'down', 'significantly', 'RITUAL', 'poorly', 'edited', 'minimal', 'effect', 'filled', 'weak', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'looking', 'amazing', 'age', 'Jennifer', 'Grey', 'not', 'improved', 'actress', 'years', 'DIRTY', 'DANCING', 'Cameos', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Erick', 'Avari', 'are', 'wasted', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'missed', 'WALKED', 'A', 'ZOMBIE', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'end', 'classicists', 'will', 'immediately', 'dismiss', 'film', 'rubbish', 'truly', 'is.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Tales from the Crypt Presents Ritual
970620,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B000E8NRVM,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[3, 4]","I've always loved Tales from the Crypt as well as cheesy horror films. When I discovered that they'd released a ""new"" TFTC film, I went out to get it almost immediately. I wish I'd waited until it came on cable. The film is mediocre at best.The film surrounds a lovely young doctor (Jennifer Grey minus her trademark nose) who has lost her job after losing a patient. She manages to get a job at an exotic resort caring after a patient who believes that he's a zombie. Initially believing that he's merely insane, she soon discovers that not everything is what it seems.I really wanted to like this film more than I did. Truly, I did. It just was pretty boring. Like another review said, it would have made a great 30 minute episode or a hour long film, but when it's stretched out over nearly 2 hours it becomes somewhat unbearable at times. There's a few good ""shocker"" scenes, but after the umpteenth time we see the old ""scary scene & then she wakes up"" schtick it begins to lose it's punch. It's not even as if there was a lack of talent- everyone in the film acts their little hearts out & there are some memorable characters. It's just that the film was too long & there wasn't enough storyline there to justify that. If not for that flaw, the film could have been much better.As it is, I was still entertained enough to finish watching it & I did enjoy some parts of the film. Not enough to tell everyone to rush out & get it, but enough to give a lukewarm recommendation if a friend really wants to watch it & there's nothing better in the video store.",3,Yawn.,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,1561,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'as', 'well', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'films', 'When', 'discovered', ""'d"", 'released', 'new', 'TFTC', 'film', 'went', 'out', 'get', 'almost', 'immediately', 'wish', ""'d"", 'waited', 'came', 'cable', 'film', 'mediocre', 'best.The', 'film', 'lovely', 'young', 'doctor', 'Jennifer', 'Grey', 'minus', 'trademark', 'nose', 'who', 'lost', 'job', 'losing', 'patient', 'get', 'job', 'exotic', 'resort', 'caring', 'patient', 'who', 'zombie', 'Initially', 'believing', 'merely', 'insane', 'soon', 'discovers', 'not', 'everything', 'what', 'seems.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'more', 'did', 'Truly', 'did', 'just', 'was', 'pretty', 'boring', 'review', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', '30', 'minute', 'episode', 'hour', 'long', 'film', 'when', 'stretched', 'out', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'somewhat', 'unbearable', 'times', 'few', 'good', 'shocker', 'scenes', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'see', 'old', 'scary', 'scene', 'then', 'up', 'schtick', 'lose', 'punch', 'not', 'even', 'was', 'lack', 'talent-', 'everyone', 'film', 'little', 'hearts', 'out', 'are', 'memorable', 'characters', 'just', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'storyline', 'there', 'justify', 'not', 'flaw', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.As', 'was', 'still', 'entertained', 'enough', 'finish', 'watching', 'did', 'enjoy', 'parts', 'film', 'Not', 'enough', 'tell', 'everyone', 'rush', 'out', 'get', 'enough', 'give', 'lukewarm', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'really', 'watch', 'nothing', 'better', 'video', 'store']",Tales from the Crypt Presents Ritual

970625,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000E8NRVM,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","TALES FROM THE CRYPTPRESENTSRITUALDo you remember a little show called ""Tales from the Crypt"" that was running back in the day; yeah those were some good days. Days got better when the show brought forth a movie called ""Demon Knight"", one of my all time favorite movies ever. Then a second movie called ""Bordello of Blood"" which while not as good as the first was still very fun. The years passed and nothing came from the show other than the series being released on DVD, until this movie came out. This of course unlike the other two was a straight to DVD movie and had some good names behind it. I was excited when this came out and was all over it, it turned out ok but is the least in the three films.The story is about a doctor who is fired by the hospital after making a last minute call costing someone their life. But that does not stop her from being hired by a wealthy guy in Jamaica to care for his little brother. Once there she learns of his illness and believes it to be what the last doctor said it was, but that doctor died on the job. Still that does not keep him from believing he has been cursed and is becoming a zombie. As the story moves on people around her become more and more mysterious and the tales of zombies begin to look more and more real. She starts to not only be followed but attacked as well; she begins to believe at that point.Writer/director Avi Nesher along with co writers Rob Cohen and Inez Wallace adapted this film into a new screenplay based on the film ""I Walked with a Zombie"". While I can certainly see where they were going with this but it fails in most parts. In fact the film is a bit of a disappointment because of its association with Tales from the Crypt. This film would have faired much better on its own but because of the Tales association people expected more. This being the third film in the series it also turned out to be third in the rankings; in fact the order in which they were released is the order in which I like them. ""Demon Knight"" is one of my all time favorite films ever and while ""Bordello of Blood"" was no where near as good it was fun and entertaining. This however feels like an episode from the show that got turned into a feature film.The film does manage to be good though and the Crypt keeper shows up at the beginning and end sporting a Jamaican accent. His time is short lived and not as great as past appearances but it was cool to see him again. Jennifer Grey is good enough in the lead role but the rest of the cast seems to outshine the star. Craig Sheffer, Daniel Lapaine, Kristen Wilson, and Gabriel Casseus are all good in their roles and are very believable. But it is Tim Curry that is my favorite here as he flawlessly makes this film more fun then it should be. The entire cast is good and well placed but the film is missing that one thing, what ever it may be, that would make it really good. The writing perhaps is lacking or perhaps the direction, maybe both but the acting is solid.This is far from a classic and is not even the best in the series but it is good enough to own if found at a pawn shop or something. If you are like me and have to have everything Tales from the Crypt related then this is a must by. For a film that was planned at one point for a big theatrical push but the second film's lack of success at the box office had it scrapped, it is good. Whether this film was originally intended as that film or not makes no defense, it is a part of the Tales family so I accept it.",3,THE THIRD FILM IN THE SERIES IS THE THIRD BEST OF THE THREE,1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,3498,"['TALES', 'THE', 'CRYPTPRESENTSRITUALDo', 'remember', 'little', 'show', 'called', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'was', 'running', 'back', 'day', 'were', 'good', 'days', 'Days', 'got', 'better', 'when', 'show', 'brought', 'forth', 'movie', 'called', 'Demon', 'Knight', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'Then', 'second', 'movie', 'called', 'Bordello', 'Blood', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'fun', 'years', 'passed', 'nothing', 'came', 'show', 'other', 'series', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'course', 'other', 'two', 'was', 'straight', 'DVD', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'names', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'turned', 'out', 'ok', 'least', 'three', 'films.The', 'story', 'doctor', 'who', 'fired', 'hospital', 'making', 'last', 'minute', 'call', 'costing', 'someone', 'life', 'not', 'stop', 'being', 'hired', 'wealthy', 'guy', 'Jamaica', 'care', 'little', 'brother', 'Once', 'illness', 'be', 'what', 'last', 'doctor', 'said', 'was', 'doctor', 'died', 'job', 'Still', 'not', 'keep', 'believing', 'been', 'cursed', 'becoming', 'zombie', 'story', 'people', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'mysterious', 'tales', 'zombies', 'begin', 'look', 'more', 'more', 'real', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'followed', 'attacked', 'well', 'believe', 'point.Writer/director', 'Avi', 'Nesher', 'co', 'writers', 'Rob', 'Cohen', 'Inez', 'Wallace', 'adapted', 'film', 'new', 'screenplay', 'based', 'film', 'Walked', 'Zombie', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'most', 'parts', 'fact', 'film', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'association', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'faired', 'much', 'better', 'own', 'Tales', 'association', 'people', 'expected', 'more', 'being', 'third', 'film', 'series', 'also', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'third', 'rankings', 'fact', 'order', 'were', 'released', 'order', 'like', 'Demon', 'Knight', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'films', 'ever', 'Bordello', 'Blood', 'was', 'where', 'near', 'good', 'was', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'however', 'episode', 'show', 'got', 'turned', 'feature', 'film.The', 'film', 'manage', 'be', 'good', 'Crypt', 'keeper', 'up', 'beginning', 'end', 'sporting', 'Jamaican', 'accent', 'time', 'short', 'lived', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'past', 'appearances', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'again', 'Jennifer', 'Grey', 'good', 'enough', 'lead', 'role', 'rest', 'cast', 'outshine', 'star', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'Daniel', 'Lapaine', 'Kristen', 'Wilson', 'Gabriel', 'Casseus', 'are', 'good', 'roles', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'favorite', 'here', 'flawlessly', 'film', 'more', 'fun', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'entire', 'cast', 'good', 'well', 'placed', 'film', 'missing', 'one', 'thing', 'what', 'ever', 'may', 'be', 'would', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'writing', 'perhaps', 'lacking', 'perhaps', 'direction', 'maybe', 'acting', 'solid.This', 'far', 'classic', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'series', 'good', 'enough', 'own', 'found', 'pawn', 'shop', 'something', 'are', 'have', 'have', 'everything', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'related', 'then', 'must', 'film', 'was', 'planned', 'one', 'point', 'big', 'theatrical', 'push', 'second', 'film', 'lack', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'had', 'scrapped', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'film', 'not', 'defense', 'part', 'Tales', 'family', 'so', 'accept']",Tales from the Crypt Presents Ritual

970632,A387BD735MI50R,B000E8NRVM,R. Schultz,"[0, 0]","I almost abandoned this movie in its first fifteen minutes. The pointless, unfunny introduction by the comic book Cryptkeeper gives a shlock start to the film. That Smart Alec bag of bones only serves to remind the viewer that this film is from the ""Tales from the Crypt"" franchise.Then the first minutes of the actual film make it look as if it's going to be soft porn exploitation all the way. But things soon take a turn for the better. I'm glad I stuck with the film, and I think you might want to also.Even after it gets under way, it has a number of flaws.  The DVD cover is misleading. There's no such huddled child involved in the action. What's more, ""Ritual"" isn't as good as ""I Walked With a Zombie,"" the 1940's film on which this is loosely based. This version, like many modern movies, throws too many ingredients into the kettle and so ends up with a stew of a plot. Its characters aren't pulled ineluctably towards their doom by any steady drum beat, as the characters in the original are. Instead, people and their passions meander all over the place here. Also, Jennifer Grey's doctor character hardly seems to justify all the trouble people took importing her into this Caribbean setting, at least through the first half of the film. Her ministrations seem to be limited to advising her patient to ""rest."" For his part, her patient's malady isn't at all consistent or convincing. However it's at least refreshing to see the woman as the doctor and the man as the patient. This is a gender-switching update on the original in which, naturally, the patient was a woman and the doctor was a man.There's still a basic lameness to the film though. However, in spite of the lameness, the film still turns out to be worth watching for a couple of reasons. First, it's often visually arresting. There's the ubiquity of people slashing away with their machetes. There's the ashen man encoiled in the tree as part of his ritual obeisance to the Obeah deities. This kind of background detail creates an eerie collage of impending peril.But the real reason to check out this film is Kristen Wilson. Her exotic beauty is mesmerizing from the first moment she appears on screen. She isn't the star of the film. She plays Jennifer Grey's friend, a free-spirited native woman who tries to instruct and warn Jennifer about the hazards she's facing in this Who-Do-Voodoo landscape. If this film had done better at the box office, it might have catapulted Kristen Wilson into first-place stardom. As it is, she remains the heart of this film, a discovery viewers can feel they're making on their own.",3,The Exotic Beauty of Kristen Wilson Makes this Worth Watching,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,2599,"['almost', 'abandoned', 'movie', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'pointless', 'unfunny', 'introduction', 'comic', 'book', 'Cryptkeeper', 'shlock', 'start', 'film', 'Smart', 'Alec', 'bag', 'bones', 'only', 'remind', 'viewer', 'film', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'franchise.Then', 'first', 'minutes', 'actual', 'film', 'make', 'look', 'going', 'be', 'soft', 'porn', 'exploitation', 'way', 'things', 'soon', 'take', 'turn', 'better', ""'m"", 'glad', 'stuck', 'film', 'think', 'might', 'want', 'also.Even', 'way', 'number', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'cover', 'misleading', 'such', 'huddled', 'child', 'involved', 'action', 'What', 'more', 'Ritual', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Walked', 'Zombie', '1940', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'version', 'many', 'modern', 'movies', 'too', 'many', 'ingredients', 'kettle', 'so', 'up', 'stew', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'pulled', 'ineluctably', 'towards', 'doom', 'steady', 'drum', 'beat', 'characters', 'original', 'are', 'Instead', 'people', 'passions', 'meander', 'place', 'here', 'Also', 'Jennifer', 'Grey', 'doctor', 'character', 'hardly', 'justify', 'trouble', 'people', 'took', 'importing', 'Caribbean', 'setting', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'ministrations', 'seem', 'be', 'limited', 'advising', 'patient', 'rest', 'part', 'patient', 'malady', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'convincing', 'However', 'least', 'refreshing', 'see', 'woman', 'doctor', 'man', 'patient', 'gender-switching', 'update', 'original', 'naturally', 'patient', 'was', 'woman', 'doctor', 'was', 'man.There', 'still', 'basic', 'lameness', 'film', 'However', 'spite', 'lameness', 'film', 'still', 'out', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'couple', 'reasons', 'First', 'often', 'visually', 'arresting', 'ubiquity', 'people', 'slashing', 'away', 'machetes', 'ashen', 'man', 'encoiled', 'tree', 'part', 'ritual', 'obeisance', 'Obeah', 'deities', 'kind', 'background', 'detail', 'eerie', 'collage', 'impending', 'real', 'reason', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'Kristen', 'Wilson', 'exotic', 'beauty', 'mesmerizing', 'first', 'moment', 'screen', ""n't"", 'star', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Grey', 'friend', 'free-spirited', 'native', 'woman', 'who', 'instruct', 'warn', 'Jennifer', 'hazards', 'facing', 'Who-Do-Voodoo', 'landscape', 'film', 'had', 'done', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'might', 'have', 'catapulted', 'Kristen', 'Wilson', 'first-place', 'stardom', 'heart', 'film', 'discovery', 'viewers', 'can', 'feel', ""'re"", 'making', 'own']",Tales from the Crypt Presents Ritual
970633,A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z,B000E8NRVM,"Santeria ""Son of Tazz""","[6, 10]","I suspect I bought this for two reasons, the Crypt Keeper label, and the story Summary. Also, Craig Sheffer has always been a great staple ever since he blazed through Barker's Film as Cabal( in the film NIGHT BREED). And it helps that Craig Curry is there, since he can be relied on for a great performance.The Audio is great 5.1 ( the drums Resonate at higher levels), and the DVI is very good. If this was kept on the  Shelf for 5 years , I would like to know why.There is some visible evidence of studio or editorial tampering. And What is this curious thing of post production work done in Israel ? The film was made in Jamaica, has references to Florida,some production in post in the US, and unstated snippets of post in Israel.Anyways, the story is basically a family fight over rich property. As to who is who, this is quite an unusually well written, and tightly so, piece. The display of the local ""flesh"" is just about over-done, although it was good to see a Strong Female lead, both Good and Bad ones, which varies from the structure of the 1995 DEMON KNIGHT, with a Demon that just reigns.Anyways, this film is basically it, no extras. So, even considering that I paid about ten dollars less than amazon at BEST BUY, and I got a few bonuses, the Amazon price is just WAY too high.I can recommend the film if you like a little intelligence in your horror, but its not spoon fed like the previous two, but it is still chilling, and the one gross out is very well done.",5,Good Fun: Great Thrills,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,1481,"['suspect', 'bought', 'two', 'reasons', 'Crypt', 'Keeper', 'label', 'story', 'Summary', 'Also', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'staple', 'ever', 'blazed', 'Barker', 'Film', 'Cabal', 'film', 'NIGHT', 'BREED', 'Craig', 'Curry', 'there', 'can', 'be', 'relied', 'great', 'performance.The', 'Audio', 'great', '5.1', 'drums', 'Resonate', 'higher', 'levels', 'DVI', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'kept', 'Shelf', '5', 'years', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'visible', 'evidence', 'studio', 'editorial', 'tampering', 'What', 'curious', 'thing', 'post', 'production', 'work', 'done', 'Israel', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Jamaica', 'references', 'Florida', 'production', 'post', 'US', 'unstated', 'snippets', 'post', 'Israel.Anyways', 'story', 'basically', 'family', 'fight', 'rich', 'property', 'who', 'who', 'quite', 'unusually', 'well', 'written', 'tightly', 'so', 'piece', 'display', 'local', 'flesh', 'just', 'over-done', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Strong', 'Female', 'lead', 'Good', 'Bad', 'ones', 'structure', '1995', 'DEMON', 'KNIGHT', 'Demon', 'just', 'film', 'basically', 'extras', 'So', 'even', 'considering', 'paid', 'about', 'ten', 'dollars', 'less', 'amazon', 'BEST', 'BUY', 'got', 'few', 'bonuses', 'Amazon', 'price', 'just', 'WAY', 'too', 'high.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'like', 'little', 'intelligence', 'horror', 'not', 'spoon', 'fed', 'previous', 'two', 'still', 'chilling', 'one', 'gross', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'done']",Tales from the Crypt Presents Ritual
970634,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B000E8NRVM,Sky,"[29, 39]","Look at any of my other reviews of the Tales From The Crypt series (I've reviewed them all)...they all get 5-stars (with the exception of Bordello of Blood).Demon Knight, the first Tales From The Crypt feature film, is also 5-stars. It was the exception to the rule...the rule being that the Tales From The Crypt episodes would be 1/2 hour shorts that mirrored their EC Comics versions of the stories. Demon Knight got full length feature film treatment and it was well deserved.Bordello of Blood, the second feature film, was a complete failure. It took a great formula (1/2 hour shorts) and added senseless length and detail to a story that could have made a great 1/2 hour episode.Ritual was scheduled as the follow-up to Bordello, but when Bordello failed in the theatres, the full length theatre release of Ritual was scratched. In fact, the Tales people abandoned their commitment to Ritual, but apparently the legal eagles found a way to keep the Tales From The Crypt ties to the franchise for DVD.It is clear by the introduction to the movie by a poorly puppeteered and lip-synced Cryptkeeper that the EC Comics guys and HBO were not involved in Ritual. The Cryptkeeper intro segment is recklessly spliced into a movie that really was never approved as a Tales From The Crypt story. And the Cryptkeeper doesn't even show up at the end of the movie as he without fail does in any other Tales feature. In fact, the movie isn't even based on an EC Comic as all the Tales From The Crypt moving picture stories are....Ritual is a remake of 1943's I Walked With A Zombie.So here is Ritual on DVD. A Tales From The Crypt episode that might have been fair if included at 30 minutes in length in the awesome series. But it just doesn't even qualify. It is not a Tales From the Crypt, Haunt of Fear or Vault of Horror comic book interpretation. Ritual is an RKO Pictures release that is simply a Tales From The Crypt rip off that is mediocre at best resembling nothing of the terrific Tales From The Crypt franchise that was such a big hit with HBO.Pass, pass, pass on this. Wait for it on cable. Wait for it on the Sci-Fi Channel.
