Simmons takes several ""celebrity-parents"" seniors through a very low impact workout.  You will ""move"" here to nice mellow music and workout in an attractive setting.  The highlight is his encouragement to tone and become flexible during a sit-down regime.Again, this is a low impact, but if one is conditioned, you can increase the activity.  Excellent workout for seniors whether you are beginning or advanced.  Take it at your own pace.  .....Rizzo",5,The Dead Need Not Apply,1041724800,"01 5, 2003",2003,533,"['think', 'exercise', 'seniors', 'be', 'half', 'dead', 'think', 'again', 'Simmons', 'several', 'celebrity-parents', 'seniors', 'very', 'low', 'impact', 'workout', 'will', 'move', 'here', 'nice', 'mellow', 'music', 'workout', 'attractive', 'setting', 'highlight', 'encouragement', 'tone', 'become', 'flexible', 'sit-down', 'regime.Again', 'low', 'impact', 'one', 'conditioned', 'can', 'increase', 'activity', 'Excellent', 'workout', 'seniors', 'are', 'beginning', 'advanced', 'Take', 'own', 'pace', '..Rizzo']",Richard Simmons and the Silver Foxes - Fitness for Silver Citizens VHS

Elliott,"[0, 0]","It's a fun way to get in both aerobic and cardio exercise without putting too much strain on your joints, but be warned... if you have had knee or hip replacement, it can cause much discomfort a few hours after doing the workouts unless you've faithfully done the exercises recommended by your physical therapist.  (Also, check with your orthopedist to get his/her okay first.)  Even though this is a low impact routine, you get a great cardio workout here, so prepare to sweat.You'll do a lot of swaying side-to-side with this video (part of what makes it fun), but your knees need to be strong so that particular movement doesn't cause the pain.Richard is calmer here and I prefer him this way than the more &#34;manic&#34; personality he shows on most of his other exercise workouts.I could find this only in the VCR format and the price I paid for a tape made me flinch a bit at first, but it was worth it.  Although the colors have faded some in the tape (filmed in '85 or '86, I believe) there is no jerking or skipping on the video I received, so I'm very pleased with my purchase.  It's actually in very good condition.I'm very pleased with the supplier.  It came much sooner than I'd expected and was carefully packaged to prevent any damage in shipping.  Good for them!Overall, I enjoy (and, therefore, use) this routine more than any of my others simply because it accomplishes what I'm trying to do in a fun, effective way.Do yourself a favor and splurge on the &#34;Silver Foxes&#34;.
