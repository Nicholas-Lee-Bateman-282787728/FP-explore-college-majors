Not an easy note to sing and Dave did it amazingly. Elton John, Leon Russell and Sheryl Crowe did a great rendition of Helpless. Was a little disappointed in Jackson Browne and I'm not a big Josh Groban fan. Apart from that, it was a sterling effort. Would definitely recommend this to any Crosby Stiils Nash and Young fans. It was also great to see Stephen Stills, David Crosby and Graham Nash on the show.",4,Terrific Tribute,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,512,"['Wonderful', 'music', 'concert', 'favourite', 'was', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'rendition', 'Needle', 'Damage', 'Done', 'Not', 'easy', 'note', 'sing', 'Dave', 'did', 'amazingly', 'Elton', 'John', 'Leon', 'Russell', 'Sheryl', 'Crowe', 'did', 'great', 'rendition', 'Helpless', 'Was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Jackson', 'Browne', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Josh', 'Groban', 'fan', 'Apart', 'was', 'sterling', 'effort', 'Would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Crosby', 'Stiils', 'Nash', 'Young', 'fans', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'Stephen', 'Stills', 'David', 'Crosby', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'show']",N/A

Also like Mr. Soul under the bonus performances.Rockin' In The Free World by Keith Urban & John Fogerty is also very good. That is about it for me .Many artists sound bored . It seems like they didn't put much effort in . Jackson Browne was alright , Lady Antebellem was good .James Taylor's read of Heart of Gold was boring . I was really looking forward to that and was very dissapointed . I expected so much more fromthis performance. Elton John and Leon Russell did ok with Helpless . Leon was sluggish early on in this song. John Mellencamp was ok with Down By the River.His lead guitarist is excellent and could have stolen the song , if allowed . T Bone Burnett sat in on this and I wasn't really sure if added anything bybeing there .I thought Elvis Costello was terrible . He sounded poor and performed with just an acoustic guitar . He really needed some help. Crosby , Stills & Nash were alsoawful . I didn't like their read on Human Highway at all. Graham Nash seems to be a caricature of himself on stage . It's painful to watch him sing with his gyrationsand facial movements . He still sounds ok . Hopefully someone can squeeze out another good song or two from these guys somewhere down the road .Jason Mraz does ok with Shaun Colvin on Lotta' Love and Norah Jones is ok too .I would like to know who the backing band was . They were excellent . I've watched the whole show twice and didn't see or hear any introductions of them . The woman that cameout to sing with Norah Jones was never introduced . I thought that was odd. Ben Harper introduced his singers and you barely get to hear their first names.Neil seemed genuinely touched to be honored. He was very humbled by the whole night .After the first couple of performances , I really thought this was going to be great . Keith Urban was terrific with John Fogerty and followed nicely by Lady Antebellum . After thatthe show just flattened out except for a few performances . Just could've , should've been better than this . I had my hopes up very high after looking at the artists and the songsthey were singing . It just seemed like a lot of good matches . It just didn't work out for me as I hoped. I would actually not buy the CD if one were to come out . I might cherry picka few songs off I-Tunes if the opportunity arises . I will look into music by Keith Urban . He also did well on the Stones' song Tumbling Dice on Jimmy Fallon and hopefully he has somelive covers available somewhere.If you still are interested in this , just buy it on sale .

So many of my favorite artist singing Neil Young songs...what could be better? The awesome and unusual pairing of Keith Urban and John Fogerty was amazing with a little help from Booker T. Jones. One of my very very favs, Dave Matthews doing ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" was perfect. Also, Lady Antebellum, Norah Jones, Josh Groban, (yes folks, Josh doing Neil Young),Ben Harper, Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, James Taylor, John Mellencamp, CSN, Elton & Leon...to say this is an all star line up is an understatement. The keyboard player in the background,who you can hardly see, but is playing on most of the songs, is Rami Jaffee from The Wallflowers(Jakob Dylans band)and Foo Fighters. He is great and highly underrated as a keyboard player.
