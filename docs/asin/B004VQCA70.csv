1430103,A1L1GM88JCXGLQ,B004VQCA70,Jackjeanh,"[2, 2]","This movie is about a young girl searching for her birth mother...and revenge. Along the way, she finds her biological mother and a brother she never knew she had set amongst the background of a mysterious island. The movie starts with Nikki sharing a fairy tale, which plays beautifully into the movie later on. (won't say too much, don't want to ruin it). The movie carries on through Nikki, the main character, and what kind of life she's had since being abandoned at birth. Containing various flashbacks of life as a kid in the foster care system, her past is bleak, painful and riddled with dark undercurrents. When she finds birth mother, she is very cold and uncaring of anyone or anything but her son Calum, Nikki's half brother played by Colin Morgan. Nikki's anger is palpable, but she manages to keep most of it hidden. You can't help but feel for Nikki despite her wish to want her mother dead. Colin Morgan does a FANTASTIC job (also with a new, really convincing accent as well) as her strangely eccentric, head in the clouds half brother who wonders the cliffs near the seas. He shares fairy tales/folk stories with Nikki and shows her about the island, all while collecting little trinkets, bottles, shoes, whatever &#34;treasures&#34; he finds. He plays this part with so much honesty and adorable, child-like naivete he can't help but become your favorite of the movie. Natalie Press plays Nikki with so much stifled anger, yet clever manipulation you are actually with and behind her most of the way. However, how far will Nikki go to get the truth?This is a truly great movie, but it has some disturbing elements to it. So be aware, this should probably be viewed by adults only. Still, as a whole, I loved this movie and have watched it more than once. My particularly favorite part is the end and I might have that part set on replay!

I gave it two stars for Colin Morgan (Merlin) he did a very good job with his part, his was the only character I could even care about.  The rest of this cast is about as exciting as watching grass grow, I did it and the grass growing is more exciting. Angry girl put up for adoption, many years later wants to kill her mother and she finds her and a brother. There you have it. Now let me say something about the horrible acting job that Natalie Press did. shrill and a shrew. I must confess I made it 64 minutes before I turned it off.
