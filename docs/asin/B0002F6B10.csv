832541,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B0002F6B10,,"[4, 4]","I just did this program a few minutes ago and wanted to review it while it was fresh in my mind.I've been working out regularly for well over 20 years using a variety of disciplines. I also have enjoyed using ""media"" (VHS/DVD's) at home for many of those years along w/ working out at gyms.I find it always interesting to see how various teachers put together exercise programs and the variations they use to challenge your body in different ways. Variety in exercise helps keep workouts fun and actually makes them more effective since you're body isn't always doing the same movements.This program starts w/ 20 minutes of standing work which incorporates a lot of plie' type work which really targets your lower body. While lower body work like this isn't really ""cardio"" (in terms of challenging your aerobic or anerobic system very intensely), you still burn calories since you are using larger muscle groups.The last 15 minutes of the program is mat based pilates. It's not the classical sequence (no ""hundreds"") but there are still several familiar mat exercises (""rolling like a ball"", ""single leg stretch"", a variation on ""teasers"" etc.).I found Tracey Thompson to be an upbeat, yet not overly perky, teacher who explained things clearly and demonstrated beautifully! Also, the ""dummies cues"" were well done in terms of providing options and tips without becoming overly distracting.This program had a great flow. It moved along better (IMO) than the ""Pilates for Dummies program"" w/ Michelle Dozois. This is not to knock that program or Ms. Dozois who is an excellent teacher. That other program did need more explanation due to the nature of the exercises, so it's understandable that it had less flow. Still, this workout w/ Tracey Thompson, has a flow that I believe would be more enjoyable to use more long term.I highly recommend this workout for any level because even though I'm an advanced exerciser, this workout isn't exactly like any other workouts I have. This stimulates your body's neuromuscular system in a different way. Also, for an advanced exerciser it can be used as more of an ""active recovery"" type workout, just enough challenge to stimulate your body without overdoing it.For a beginner, while they might find it somewhat challenging, you can always modify moves to accomodate your current level of fitness and build up to harder versions of the exercises as you feel more comfortable. NEVER try to do more than you can do if your form suffers, just find a way that is enjoyable and comfortable for you while giving yourself enough of a challenge so that your body will adapt and improve.Highly Recommended!",5,"Creative, Fun and Low Impact, Standing and Mat Pilates Workout!",1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,2640,"['just', 'did', 'program', 'few', 'minutes', 'ago', 'wanted', 'review', 'was', 'fresh', 'mind.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'out', 'regularly', 'well', '20', 'years', 'using', 'variety', 'disciplines', 'also', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'using', 'media', 'VHS/DVD', 'home', 'many', 'years', 'along', 'w/', 'working', 'out', 'gyms.I', 'find', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'various', 'teachers', 'put', 'together', 'exercise', 'programs', 'variations', 'use', 'challenge', 'body', 'different', 'ways', 'Variety', 'exercise', 'keep', 'workouts', 'fun', 'actually', 'more', 'effective', ""'re"", 'body', ""n't"", 'always', 'doing', 'same', 'movements.This', 'program', '20', 'minutes', 'standing', 'work', 'lot', 'plie', 'type', 'work', 'really', 'lower', 'body', 'lower', 'body', 'work', ""n't"", 'really', 'cardio', 'terms', 'challenging', 'aerobic', 'anerobic', 'system', 'very', 'intensely', 'still', 'burn', 'calories', 'are', 'using', 'larger', 'muscle', 'groups.The', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'program', 'mat', 'based', 'pilates', 'not', 'classical', 'sequence', 'hundreds', 'are', 'still', 'several', 'familiar', 'mat', 'exercises', 'rolling', 'ball', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'variation', 'teasers', 'etc', '.I', 'found', 'Tracey', 'Thompson', 'be', 'upbeat', 'yet', 'not', 'overly', 'perky', 'teacher', 'who', 'explained', 'things', 'clearly', 'demonstrated', 'beautifully', 'Also', 'dummies', 'cues', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'terms', 'providing', 'options', 'tips', 'becoming', 'overly', 'distracting.This', 'program', 'had', 'great', 'flow', 'moved', 'along', 'better', 'IMO', 'Pilates', 'Dummies', 'program', 'Michelle', 'Dozois', 'not', 'knock', 'program', 'Ms.', 'Dozois', 'who', 'excellent', 'teacher', 'other', 'program', 'did', 'need', 'more', 'explanation', 'due', 'nature', 'exercises', 'understandable', 'had', 'less', 'flow', 'Still', 'workout', 'w/', 'Tracey', 'Thompson', 'flow', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'use', 'more', 'long', 'term.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'workout', 'level', 'even', ""'m"", 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'workout', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'other', 'workouts', 'have', 'body', 'neuromuscular', 'system', 'different', 'way', 'Also', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'more', 'active', 'recovery', 'type', 'workout', 'just', 'enough', 'challenge', 'stimulate', 'body', 'overdoing', 'it.For', 'beginner', 'might', 'find', 'somewhat', 'challenging', 'can', 'always', 'modify', 'moves', 'accomodate', 'current', 'level', 'fitness', 'build', 'up', 'harder', 'versions', 'exercises', 'feel', 'more', 'comfortable', 'NEVER', 'try', 'do', 'more', 'can', 'do', 'form', 'suffers', 'just', 'find', 'way', 'enjoyable', 'comfortable', 'giving', 'enough', 'challenge', 'so', 'body', 'will', 'adapt', 'improve.Highly', 'Recommended']",Pilates Weight Loss Workout for Dummies

I have never tried pilates before, so I got this, used, thinking if I didn't like it and passed it along I wouldn't be out much money.  Turns out... I LOVE IT!  All the reviews are right on the money with this DVD.  I usually do the 30 Day Shred w/Jillian Michaels which is a great workout video but it's grueling and I just don't feel like subjecting myself to that beating every day!  This pilates DVD is 35 mins... when I got done I felt like I had only been doing it for 15 mins lol!  My heart rate was up, I could feel the burn and I was sweating (mostly ""after"" the workout) but I was relaxed and didn't feel like I hardly worked out.  When I say that, it's not because I couldn't feel it, but it was relaxing, the whole thing in general.  Tracy is fantastic and I plan on buying more of her DVD's.  I'm also buying this again today for my mom, think she'll love it as well.  Enjoy it!",5,LOVE IT!
