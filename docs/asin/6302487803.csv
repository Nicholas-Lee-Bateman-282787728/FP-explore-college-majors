However this one was a mini series on TV so there was not as much thought put in to it as if it were a made for theater movie. However the film was made in Tunisia.David Soul is caste as Alex Wolff, which matches the book description pretty well. Robert Culp is comfortable as General Rommel.You will have to look real hard at the credits to see that Season Hubley plays Elene Fontana.My favorite surprise was seeing Richard Gibson playing a British officer named Captain Newman and speaking with a British accent. As I remember him as Otto Flick (Flick the Gestapo) in ""'Allo 'Allo"" (1984) [TV-Series: 1984-1992]I can see the ""R"" rating, as there are plenty of risqu&eacute; shots of men and women, and women and men, and women and women.There are enough plot twists to keep your attention.",4,A made for TV movie that is close to the book,967680000,"08 31, 2000",2000,932,"['have', 'seen', 'Eye', 'Needle', '1981', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'adaptations', 'Ken', 'Follett', 'Novels', 'However', 'one', 'was', 'mini', 'series', 'TV', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'put', 'were', 'made', 'theater', 'movie', 'However', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Tunisia.David', 'Soul', 'caste', 'Alex', 'Wolff', 'book', 'description', 'pretty', 'well', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'comfortable', 'General', 'Rommel.You', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'real', 'hard', 'credits', 'see', 'Season', 'Hubley', 'Elene', 'Fontana.My', 'favorite', 'surprise', 'was', 'seeing', 'Richard', 'Gibson', 'playing', 'British', 'officer', 'named', 'Captain', 'Newman', 'speaking', 'British', 'accent', 'remember', 'Otto', 'Flick', 'Flick', 'Gestapo', ""'Allo"", ""'Allo"", '1984', '[', 'TV-Series', '1984-1992', ']', 'can', 'see', 'R', 'rating', 'are', 'plenty', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'shots', 'men', 'women', 'women', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'enough', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'attention']",N/A

I guess that his past in Starsky and Hutch played against him. He is here as good as was Brando in a similar role -The Young LionsHe plays the cruel deviant German, so strong that it is a bit at the expense of the other characters.

315807,A3413POX3K3CGT,6302487803,Mystic812,"[9, 9]","They did a great job with this movie, it's not easy moving a story from book to screen. David Soul did a wonderful acting job as Alex Wolff. His mix of bad guy and a romantic were very well done and realistic. Cliff Robertson was also great, as well as the locations for shooting. Some spy type movies tend to get boring for me, but the casting in this, as well as a great story made it anything but boring. It's a long film, 3 hours, but because the film is so good, time flies by very quickly. It's definetly a movie you will watch more than once. In fact, it's one of only a very few 3 hour films I watch repeatedly. In my opinion, David Soul was the movie's biggest asset.",5,Excellent take on the book.,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,676,"['did', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'not', 'easy', 'moving', 'story', 'book', 'screen', 'David', 'Soul', 'did', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'job', 'Alex', 'Wolff', 'mix', 'bad', 'guy', 'romantic', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'realistic', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'locations', 'shooting', 'spy', 'type', 'movies', 'tend', 'get', 'boring', 'casting', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'story', 'made', 'anything', 'boring', 'long', 'film', '3', 'hours', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'time', 'flies', 'very', 'quickly', 'definetly', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'fact', 'one', 'only', 'very', 'few', '3', 'hour', 'films', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'opinion', 'David', 'Soul', 'was', 'movie', 'biggest', 'asset']",N/A

This film is an excellent rendition of the Ken Follett novel.  Cliff Robertson, David Soul, Robert Culp, and the supporting cast all turn in bravo performances in a thrilling story set in World War II Egypt.  Egypt is besieged by Rommel's powerful armies, and a master German spy (David Soul) is betraying vital British military secrets to Rommel to enable the final push to Cairo.  Cliff Robertson is the brilliant British counter-intelligence agent determined to stop him.  This is a gripping and well-told film, just like the book, which is one of Follet's best novels.
