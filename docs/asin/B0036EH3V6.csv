1327715,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0036EH3V6,Compay,"[6, 7]","Creature of Darkness is one of the worst sci-fi movies that I've subjected myself to since Battlefield Earth.  It was so bad for different reasons that I have no idea how it made it to Redbox.Andrew and his friends decide to spend a night off-roading and camping, at the exact time and location that he's aware an alien hunter is on the prowl.  But since the producers couldn't afford an alien costume, our outer-space hunter walks around the woods in a hooded overcoat.Oh, it gets better.While the alien in Predator loves to hunt soldiers built like NFL running backs, our alien targets humans that seem ""collectible"" for his galaxy's museum.  Andrew, in his infinite knowledge of alien hunting patterns, expertly proclaims that one of their buddies was captured because of his red hair and freckles.I'm not making this up.Creature of Darkness is basically a rip-off of Predator, only with bad acting, bad directing, and horrible CGI effects.  While there's nudity in the film, one beauty flashes her boyfriend, yet the director pans the camera up so you can't see (why even include that).  When the group discover a bloody body near their campground, one actress has a huge accidental grin after hearing another's shriek.  Director Mark Stouffer apparently felt that shooting more than one take of a scene is for amateurs.  In fact, the only actor who offers a quality and funny performance is Dan White, as Andrew's buddy Mason.The only redeeming feature of this movie is that the entire cast of women is beautiful.  There are plenty of curvy bodies and flat tummies in this film, from TV personality Ingrid Schau to Hawaii surfer Sanoe Lake.  Mexican actress Fernanda Romero is unbelievably pretty and sexy as Mason's girlfriend, and the only nude scene in the movie is courtesy of the extremely hot Siena Goines.  These lovely ladies were probably the only thing that kept me watching an otherwise boring movie.Creature of Darkness fails on many levels.  I gave it an honest shot, and I was surprised at how bad it was.  Absolutely rent this one from Redbox before you consider buying the DVD.",2,Plenty of Hot Women in this Bad Predator Ripoff,1271462400,"04 17, 2010",2010,2098,"['Creature', 'Darkness', 'one', 'worst', 'sci-fi', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'subjected', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'different', 'reasons', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'made', 'Redbox.Andrew', 'friends', 'decide', 'spend', 'night', 'off-roading', 'camping', 'exact', 'time', 'location', 'aware', 'alien', 'hunter', 'prowl', 'producers', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'alien', 'costume', 'outer-space', 'hunter', 'walks', 'woods', 'hooded', 'overcoat.Oh', 'alien', 'Predator', 'hunt', 'soldiers', 'built', 'NFL', 'running', 'backs', 'alien', 'targets', 'humans', 'seem', 'collectible', 'galaxy', 'museum', 'Andrew', 'infinite', 'knowledge', 'alien', 'hunting', 'patterns', 'expertly', 'one', 'buddies', 'was', 'captured', 'red', 'hair', 'freckles.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'making', 'up.Creature', 'Darkness', 'basically', 'rip-off', 'Predator', 'only', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'directing', 'horrible', 'CGI', 'effects', 'nudity', 'film', 'one', 'beauty', 'boyfriend', 'director', 'camera', 'up', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'even', 'include', 'When', 'group', 'bloody', 'body', 'campground', 'one', 'actress', 'huge', 'accidental', 'grin', 'hearing', 'shriek', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Stouffer', 'apparently', 'felt', 'shooting', 'more', 'one', 'take', 'scene', 'amateurs', 'fact', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'quality', 'funny', 'performance', 'Dan', 'White', 'Andrew', 'buddy', 'Mason.The', 'only', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'movie', 'entire', 'cast', 'women', 'beautiful', 'are', 'plenty', 'curvy', 'bodies', 'flat', 'tummies', 'film', 'TV', 'personality', 'Ingrid', 'Schau', 'Hawaii', 'surfer', 'Sanoe', 'Lake', 'Mexican', 'actress', 'Fernanda', 'Romero', 'unbelievably', 'pretty', 'sexy', 'Mason', 'girlfriend', 'only', 'nude', 'scene', 'movie', 'courtesy', 'extremely', 'hot', 'Siena', 'Goines', 'lovely', 'ladies', 'were', 'probably', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'watching', 'otherwise', 'boring', 'movie.Creature', 'Darkness', 'fails', 'many', 'levels', 'gave', 'honest', 'shot', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'Absolutely', 'rent', 'one', 'Redbox', 'consider', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A
1327716,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B0036EH3V6,CriticNic,"[0, 0]","Mark Stouffer's Creature of Darkness is a science fiction monster movie much reminiscent of the Predator. It differs in that this time around, we don't have a group of rag tag commandos, but rather college-aged friends out for a good time in the woods. The story follows Andrew (Devon Sawa) who's suffered nightmares of a creepy and murderous alien. Andrew's friend Heather (Fernanda Romero) convinces him to overcome his fears and join a group on an off-road adventure. It's only a matter of time before Andrew's nightmares start to resemble reality.At this point the film turns more into a slasher as members of the group begin to be picked off. As things start to get shaken up, Andrew reveals the stories once told by his lunatic uncle, relating them to what's currently happening. Naturally the group can't believe what they're seeing or hearing, prompting tempers to flare. As they start to put the pieces together, Andrew believes the ghastly creature hunting them down is the Catcher, an alien sent to collect human specimens for scientific studies. From here out, the film turns into a classic survival tale as the remaining people in the group attempt to outsmart their hunter.The story of Creature of Darkness is an exciting one. It manages to blend great elements of science fiction and horror (more specifically, slashers). Perhaps what this film suffered most from was that it's visions exceeded it's budget. The Catcher's face looked realistic, creepy, and original. However when a scene called for the monster's full unclothed body to be seen, this was done in CGI. The transition between the sculpted face and the animated critter was blatant. There were additionally some scenes where the Catcher was able to manipulate objects which called for animation, which also did not look too convincing.Low-budget CGI aside, the film did have some good things going for it. Of course the standout was Devon Sawa. Where has he been? He's by far the most experienced talent in this film, which may have made the rest of the cast seem worse than they were by comparison. The cast was decent for this type of movie. Matthew Lawrence (Boy Meets World) also does a great job and shows promise. Aside from Sawa however there were no really outstanding performances, and I even found occurrences where I was cheering the Catcher on due to the annoyance of some characters.My biggest gripe with the film is not the use of CGI or inexperienced acting, but rather with the dialog. There are some truly cheesy lines that took away much of the film's credibility. These lines made the characters unlikable at times and pushed the film further into b-movie status. Whether or not that was the intent, I found it to be the major downfall of an otherwise decent and action-filled sci-fi story. I enjoyed much about this film, but the aforementioned flaws ended up making it just okay. The film will be fun for cheesy monster movie fans, but probably won't hold much with many others.Source: criticnic.com 24-March-2010Disclosure: Film sent by MTI Home Video",3,"OK creature feature, but dampened by poor dialog",1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,3051,"['Mark', 'Stouffer', 'Creature', 'Darkness', 'science', 'fiction', 'monster', 'movie', 'much', 'reminiscent', 'Predator', 'time', 'around', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'group', 'rag', 'tag', 'commandos', 'rather', 'college-aged', 'friends', 'out', 'good', 'time', 'woods', 'story', 'Andrew', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'who', 'suffered', 'nightmares', 'creepy', 'murderous', 'alien', 'Andrew', 'friend', 'Heather', 'Fernanda', 'Romero', 'overcome', 'fears', 'join', 'group', 'off-road', 'adventure', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Andrew', 'nightmares', 'start', 'resemble', 'reality.At', 'point', 'film', 'more', 'slasher', 'members', 'group', 'begin', 'be', 'picked', 'off', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'shaken', 'up', 'Andrew', 'stories', 'once', 'told', 'lunatic', 'uncle', 'relating', 'what', 'currently', 'happening', 'Naturally', 'group', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'hearing', 'prompting', 'tempers', 'flare', 'start', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'Andrew', 'ghastly', 'creature', 'hunting', 'down', 'Catcher', 'alien', 'sent', 'collect', 'human', 'specimens', 'scientific', 'studies', 'here', 'film', 'classic', 'survival', 'tale', 'remaining', 'people', 'group', 'attempt', 'outsmart', 'hunter.The', 'story', 'Creature', 'Darkness', 'exciting', 'one', 'blend', 'great', 'elements', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'more', 'specifically', 'slashers', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'film', 'suffered', 'most', 'was', 'visions', 'exceeded', 'budget', 'Catcher', 'face', 'looked', 'realistic', 'creepy', 'original', 'However', 'when', 'scene', 'called', 'monster', 'full', 'unclothed', 'body', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'done', 'CGI', 'transition', 'sculpted', 'face', 'animated', 'critter', 'was', 'blatant', 'were', 'additionally', 'scenes', 'where', 'Catcher', 'was', 'able', 'manipulate', 'objects', 'called', 'animation', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'too', 'convincing.Low-budget', 'CGI', 'aside', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'course', 'standout', 'was', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'Where', 'been', 'far', 'most', 'experienced', 'talent', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'rest', 'cast', 'seem', 'worse', 'were', 'comparison', 'cast', 'was', 'decent', 'type', 'movie', 'Matthew', 'Lawrence', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'promise', 'Aside', 'Sawa', 'however', 'were', 'really', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'even', 'found', 'occurrences', 'where', 'was', 'cheering', 'Catcher', 'due', 'annoyance', 'characters.My', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'film', 'not', 'use', 'CGI', 'inexperienced', 'acting', 'rather', 'dialog', 'are', 'truly', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'took', 'away', 'much', 'film', 'credibility', 'lines', 'made', 'characters', 'unlikable', 'times', 'pushed', 'film', 'further', 'b-movie', 'status', 'not', 'was', 'intent', 'found', 'be', 'major', 'downfall', 'otherwise', 'decent', 'action-filled', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'film', 'aforementioned', 'flaws', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'just', 'okay', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'fun', 'cheesy', 'monster', 'movie', 'fans', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'much', 'many', 'others.Source', 'criticnic.com', '24-March-2010Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', 'MTI', 'Home', 'Video']",N/A

Turns out that was a dollar to much.  This movie was SO stupid.  I mean, it didn't explain the story at all.  It also was trying to have a back story that it took about five minutes to try and explain.  The acting was really bad and it was just boring.  Was it really trying to scare me?
