1262328,A3AQ6590YBDSNV,B002C7ELOA,"David Seguin ""djzilla""","[0, 0]","I can't believe Laramie came to an end with the fourth season.  You see Laramie is an amazing family western with simply two of the best leads ever in John Smith and Robert Fuller.  It could have gone on for a few more years. Thankfully the series has managed to get released by TMG for years to come.  If you enjoy the big westerns like Gunsmoke, Rawhide, The Virginian and Bonanza you have to give this series a try.So how does the 4th season release stack up to previous releases.  Sadly there is barely any improvement to the 4th season set over the third.  The color is faded, the picture is grainy and not sharp at all, and the sound is incredibly muffled.  The picture does appear to be a slight bit better than the third season but it's still less than ideal.  You may think I am being harsh but compare season 4 of Laramie vs the picture quality of the first season of the Virginian.  Debuting the same year you'll see what I mean.  The Virginian's picture is sharp, clear and the sound is great.  Laramie not at all.  Again it has that worn video tape quality to it and it's a real tragedy.  Overall the black and white seasons of Laramie are of a better quality than the color.  I hope someday somehow this series is totally remastered if even possible.  I'm not sure if film exists to enable a full restoration but it deserves it.So now that I've blasted the quality of the release should you buy it.  YES!!!  These series are national treasures of a past in television when the whole family could watch a series together.  They are strong morality tales that deserve to be cherished for years to come.  And you should celebrate actors like John Smith and Robert Fuller for their contributions to television.  While I want to give it 5 stars because of this, I would be doing a disservice to Amazon community, so sadly the most I can give it is a 3.  Still,support Laramie and purchase and enjoy it even in the less then stellar quality.  Someday we may be able to get the release this deserves but until then enjoy what we have and be thankful for it.",3,Laramie's final season rolls on...,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,2064,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Laramie', 'came', 'end', 'fourth', 'season', 'see', 'Laramie', 'amazing', 'family', 'western', 'simply', 'two', 'best', 'leads', 'ever', 'John', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'Thankfully', 'series', 'managed', 'get', 'released', 'TMG', 'years', 'come', 'enjoy', 'big', 'westerns', 'Gunsmoke', 'Rawhide', 'Virginian', 'Bonanza', 'have', 'give', 'series', 'try.So', 'how', '4th', 'season', 'release', 'stack', 'previous', 'releases', 'Sadly', 'barely', 'improvement', '4th', 'season', 'set', 'third', 'color', 'faded', 'picture', 'grainy', 'not', 'sharp', 'sound', 'incredibly', 'muffled', 'picture', 'appear', 'be', 'slight', 'bit', 'better', 'third', 'season', 'still', 'less', 'ideal', 'may', 'think', 'am', 'being', 'harsh', 'compare', 'season', '4', 'Laramie', 'picture', 'quality', 'first', 'season', 'Virginian', 'Debuting', 'same', 'year', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'Virginian', 'picture', 'sharp', 'clear', 'sound', 'great', 'Laramie', 'not', 'Again', 'worn', 'video', 'tape', 'quality', 'real', 'tragedy', 'black', 'white', 'seasons', 'Laramie', 'are', 'better', 'quality', 'color', 'hope', 'someday', 'somehow', 'series', 'totally', 'remastered', 'even', 'possible', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'enable', 'full', 'restoration', 'it.So', 'now', ""'ve"", 'blasted', 'quality', 'release', 'should', 'buy', 'YES', 'series', 'are', 'national', 'treasures', 'past', 'television', 'when', 'whole', 'family', 'could', 'watch', 'series', 'together', 'are', 'strong', 'morality', 'tales', 'deserve', 'be', 'cherished', 'years', 'come', 'should', 'celebrate', 'actors', 'John', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'contributions', 'television', 'want', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'disservice', 'Amazon', 'community', 'so', 'sadly', 'most', 'can', 'give', '3', 'Still', 'support', 'Laramie', 'purchase', 'enjoy', 'even', 'less', 'then', 'stellar', 'quality', 'Someday', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'release', 'then', 'enjoy', 'what', 'have', 'be', 'thankful']",Laramie: The Final Season

Confusing!But, now that I do have this entire series and have viewed them in chronological order, I could care less in how they released them. For that matter, even the lousy quality of some of the episodes I've dismissed. Hell, I used to watch on a small screen with really bad reception as a kid. I am just grateful that I've had the opportunity to see this series, since I was too young to even remember it when it on the air. Nope, not the best acting, and some of the stories were pretty weak, but in the long run, this was a very enjoyable series that was deserving of it's four season run.

While I was not a fan of Gunsmoke, it was watched without fail in our household of one TV. Laramie was one of my favorites,  not because the plots were memorable, but because who could resist Robert Fuller as Jess Harper the somewhat rebel to a person who wanted to be, but by convention could not be nor had the guts to deviate from that which was expected. Watching the series again brought back memories and I have to admit that  were pleasant. It reminded me of a time when things were left to one's imagination.

It is now a show I have re-discovered!  Laramie came to TV during the age of telecast westerns.....easily one of the best ever made!  The stories were typical.....good guys, bad guys, robberies, pretty girls, fights, conflicts, stagecoach hold-ups.......the ingredients for any good western.  Westerns, of course, need heroes.  And, this show had two of them...in addition to great stories, good supporting casts, and great guest stars.  The two heroes were friends.....a relationship that tied together this series in a terrific way.  John Smith and Robert Fuller were perfectly cast, and their role relationship was the backbone that made this series work.  I truly believe no one could have played Jess Harper better than Robert Fuller.....or Slim Sherman played by John Smith.  They fit each other...and played off each other so well...that one could believe their characterizations were genuine....it was said they were good friends off the screen as well!  Great series always seem to have that one necessary ingredient.....The working relationship between the main characters working successfully in every respect.  When the two worked together in the story, the series was at its best.  The main mistake made later in the series was having stories with only one of the stars.....the other minimally used.  Gone was the camaraderie they shared.  That story sharing provided a strength.....the story separation provided a weakness!
