It is widely believed - by many including me - that this one was cancelled because the people making the decision would not have recognized genius if it walked up and punched them in the face. The casting and acting were fantastic. Warburton was made for this role. Arthur was perfect, and the few episodes were well written, and managed to attract great guest stars and character actors. I can't help but be disappointed that I never got a chance to see what would have happened with this caste if they had been given an opportunity to run with this show for a few seasons.",4,Seasons 2 & 3 would have been amazing,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,639,"['Many', 'shows', 'are', 'cancelled', 'first', 'season', 'stink', 'widely', 'believed', 'many', 'including', 'one', 'was', 'cancelled', 'people', 'making', 'decision', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'recognized', 'genius', 'walked', 'up', 'punched', 'face', 'casting', 'acting', 'were', 'fantastic', 'Warburton', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'Arthur', 'was', 'perfect', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'managed', 'attract', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'character', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'disappointed', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'caste', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'opportunity', 'run', 'show', 'few', 'seasons']",N/A

Take note Monty Python fans, listen up followers of Red Dwarf, etc. It is in no way meant to be taken seriously. Which is unfortunately what probably led to it's short life.  The network just couldn't take it seriously. And you have to understand, really. Any program that goes around airing lines like, ""Destiny dressed you this morning, Arthur, and now FEAR is trying to take off your pants!"" doesn't really cut it in the ""for your serious consideration"" category.Which is a cryin' shame, because we could ALL use a LOT more absurd humor in our lives! The comic character of the Tick was created by Ben Edlund. He established a theme of absurdity and ludicrous irreverence that makes you want to quote the comic, cartoon and tv show with a repetiveness that would annoy a three year old! The television show stayed true to the themes, even if some of the characters had to be changed.  I thought nothing could be funnier than the pretentiousness of Die Fledermaus, until I saw Batmanuel (played with absolute perfection by Nestor Carbonell).Basically, it comes down to: is this your kind of thing?  If it is, and you're holding out because you're afraid it won't compare to the comic book or cartoon, GET IT!  It's another incarnation of this hilarious group of characters and does NOT fail to deliver!  C'mon, the moist hand of Destiny is at your back, and she's pushing!",5,Java Devil!

768062,A3K1JFYC9KOVV5,B0000AUHQE,CB,"[1, 1]","I remember the Tick cartoon that ran on FOX all those years ago - I thought it was great (the Tick was also a comic book, by the by...); anyway, I had to check out the live-action series, and I wasn't disappointed.Who is The Tick? As played by Patrick Warburton (who played Putty of Seinfeld-fame), the Tick is a big, dumb goof of a superhero in a blue suit with expressive antennae on his head. Tick spouts hilarious, pompous non-sequitorisms and almost always leaves a path of (accidental) wanton destruction in his path. His sidekick, Arthur (David Burke) is the series' POV character - a new superhero who has just quit his job as an accountant to fight crime full-time, Arthur is ernest and tries to do the best he can in besting the baddies. Along for the ride are the irritable Capt. Liberty (Liz Vassey) and lascivious BatManuel (Nestor Carbonell), a former couple who try to keep their cluttered personal lives in order while battling crime.The Tick's basic premise is that superheroes would just be regular Joes if they existed in the real world - they have rotten apartments, eat in diners (the show's restaurant of choice is a run-down Chinese food establishment called the Lonely Panda) and try to get their names in the papers. As such, the show is a comedy not about fighting crime but about how wacky real life can be, even if you're ""super.""The series only lasted 9 half-hour episodes, but, in general, the show is gold - several episodes are absolutely hilarious from start to finish (the best overall is ""The Funeral"" in which our quartet of hapless heroes must deal with the death of the greatest hero of them all, The Immortal - with unexpectedly comic results). Strangely, though the show is structured around the Tick and Arthur as the main protagonists, it is Capt. Liberty and BatManuel who steal the show; indeed, Carbonell, as the ne'er-do-well-yet-worldly-wise BatManuel gets almost all of the series' best lines and is consistently the most interesting character in the show (though Warburton's Tick has a few genius bits of business as well; the way his antennae react to, and punctuate, what he says is a subtle work of comic wonderment). The only criticism I have is that the show can, at times, go down a few rather dark paths that don't seem to work with the otherwise light-hearted premise of the show. However, these bits are few and far between, as a rule. Additionally, though it looks kid-friendly, this show is generally written for an adult audience.If you're looking for some fun superhero shenanigans or just a great (if all-too-brief) comedy to relax with, I can't make a much better recommendation than The Tick!

When he's attacked by inept Communist agents, he's suddenly rescued by... the Tick (Patrick Warburton), a dimwitted innocent who lives in a world of his own.

In the meantime, Our Heroes have to deal with dogs, mixed dating (superhero/ordinary person), porn shoots, Captain Liberty accidently killing the poorly-named celebrity-superhero Immortal (in the sack, no less!), the snobby League of Heroes, and the Tick's search for his true identity.It doesn't get much goofier than &quot;Tick,&quot; which spoofs the sort of comic book heroes like Superman and Batman. The villains are over-the-top (check out Destroyo's tanklike exoskeleton), the heroes are more often insane than not, and sidekicks form little clubs to complain about how their heroes treat them. The writing is full of tortured metaphors and strange scenarios (the scene where Captain Liberty and Batmanuel try to explain the Facts of Life to the Tick is priceless -- &quot;blah blah blah&quot;).He's the tiny diamond in a sea of rhinestones, a peach in a barrel of bad apples; Patrick Warburton is outrageously funny as he rolls off the corniest and dumbest dialogue imaginable (&quot;A secret message... from my teeth!&quot;) without cracking the tiniest smile. Burke serves as the hapless brain Arthur; Carbonell is quite entertaining as the womanizing Batmanuel, who only fights crime once in the whole series.

In that regard, no matter how you slice it, THE TICK was probably one of the most abused television series in history, based on Fox network's treatment of it.  When it first appeared in November 2001, this show was hailed by critics for its comic take on the superhero genre.  Unfortunately, Fox under promoted the show and moved around the schedule to such a degree as to eliminate any chance for it build up any kind of audience.  Of the 9 episodes made, 8 were allowed to air before cancellation.  Fortunately, this rather wacky show gets a second life in this basic 2 disc DVD set that includes all 9 episodes.  Based on Ben Edlund's classic comic, the series follows the adventures of the Tick, a big blue-bug suited superhero who definitely lives in a world of his own.  With his moth-suited sidekick, Arthur, the Tick tries to make the City safe from all evil doers, while dealing with such issues as fighting such threats as the Apocalypse Cow or his need to acquire a license to operate as a hero.Patrick Warburton is perfectly cast as the title hero.  With his open expressions and goofy manner, he totally embodies this super-doofus.  David Burke is solid as the put-upon Arthur, while Liz Vassey is a treat as the beautiful, yet somewhat overbearing,Captain Liberty.  However, it is Nestor Carbonell who tends to get the biggest laughs as the self-important lothario Batmanuel.  Much of the humor is very wacky and surreal and the show could be described as a superhero version of TV's SEINFELD.  Fans of the comic and the animated TV series might be disappointed in the lack of superhero-type action, but otherwise it captures the original's sense of absurdity.THE TICK is a classic case of a fun TV show that deserved better than it got from its network.  As such, this is definitely worth recommending to comic book and TV fans alike.",4,"THE TICK is a great, underappreciated TV gem",1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,1991,"['too', 'often', 'TV', 'network', 'executives', 'demand', 'edgy', 'new', 'shows', 'only', 'disavow', 'when', 'show', 'TOO', 'edgy', 'conservative', 'tastes', 'regard', 'matter', 'how', 'slice', 'THE', 'TICK', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'abused', 'television', 'series', 'history', 'based', 'Fox', 'network', 'treatment', 'When', 'first', 'appeared', 'November', '2001', 'show', 'was', 'hailed', 'critics', 'comic', 'take', 'superhero', 'genre', 'Unfortunately', 'Fox', 'promoted', 'show', 'moved', 'schedule', 'degree', 'eliminate', 'chance', 'build', 'up', 'kind', 'audience', '9', 'episodes', 'made', '8', 'were', 'allowed', 'air', 'cancellation', 'Fortunately', 'rather', 'wacky', 'show', 'second', 'life', 'basic', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', '9', 'episodes', 'Based', 'Ben', 'Edlund', 'classic', 'comic', 'series', 'adventures', 'Tick', 'big', 'blue-bug', 'suited', 'superhero', 'who', 'definitely', 'world', 'own', 'moth-suited', 'sidekick', 'Arthur', 'Tick', 'make', 'City', 'safe', 'evil', 'doers', 'dealing', 'such', 'issues', 'fighting', 'such', 'threats', 'Apocalypse', 'Cow', 'need', 'acquire', 'license', 'operate', 'hero.Patrick', 'Warburton', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'title', 'hero', 'open', 'expressions', 'goofy', 'manner', 'totally', 'super-doofus', 'David', 'Burke', 'solid', 'put-upon', 'Arthur', 'Liz', 'Vassey', 'treat', 'beautiful', 'somewhat', 'overbearing', 'Captain', 'Liberty', 'However', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', 'who', 'get', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'self-important', 'lothario', 'Batmanuel', 'Much', 'humor', 'very', 'wacky', 'surreal', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'superhero', 'version', 'TV', 'SEINFELD', 'Fans', 'comic', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'superhero-type', 'action', 'otherwise', 'original', 'sense', 'absurdity.THE', 'TICK', 'classic', 'case', 'fun', 'TV', 'show', 'deserved', 'better', 'got', 'network', 'such', 'definitely', 'worth', 'recommending', 'comic', 'book', 'TV', 'fans', 'alike']",N/A
768070,A2YA0NA23SIEU6,B0000AUHQE,-|-,"[1, 1]","I've been a fan of The Tick since the original comic book series in the late 80's. Writer Ben Edlund was genius on this series, but alas the comic only lasted 13 issues with him as creator. The Tick continued in other series written and drawn by other writers and artists but they never lived up to what Edlund did and interest in the comic faltered. Then the cartoon came along and although it was quite good it basically reduced a smart teen/adult comic to a show for a 10 year old audience, although it did contain enough twisted humour to appeal to the eclectic grown up which is a good thing and came with Edlund's involvement in the show. The live action tv show with Edlund's involvement once again provided a series that was directed at a more mature audience and proved that The Tick character was easily capable of transending any audience. As with previous incarnations however, the show was shot down much too early. This DVD collection is well worth a purchase if you are a fan of the character. The episodes are clever and well written and the characters are great. The only disappointments I can sight are that just as you are getting used to the true genius of the show, it ends. Not even enough episodes were made to consider this a season and that's just too bad. Shame on the studio for cancelling a show that had so much potential, but that seems to be the thorn in The Tick's side no matter what medium he adorns. My only real complaint about this set is that there is an extra that is web linked, meaning that you put the disk in your pc drive and click on a link to a website where you can watch a badly streamed 20 minute interview with actor Patrick Warburton who plays the Tick. The interview is good with inside info about the making of the show and so on, so I have no idea why it wasn't included on the dvds themselves? Someday when it is taken offline you won't be able to access it and anyone who buys the set after that point won't ever get to see the extra. This is a terrible marketing tactic especially when the dvds could have been beefed up with more material such as this. Fans deserve every bit of material especially since the series was cut short. The set is rounded off with some commentary on some select episodes which are cool. Great overall but the stupid weblink to a internet only interview angers me enough to take 1 star off an otherwise entertaining package.",4,Pretty cool,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,2409,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Tick', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'late', '80', 'Writer', 'Ben', 'Edlund', 'was', 'genius', 'series', 'comic', 'only', 'lasted', '13', 'issues', 'creator', 'Tick', 'continued', 'other', 'series', 'written', 'drawn', 'other', 'writers', 'artists', 'never', 'lived', 'up', 'what', 'Edlund', 'did', 'interest', 'comic', 'faltered', 'Then', 'cartoon', 'came', 'along', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'basically', 'reduced', 'smart', 'teen/adult', 'comic', 'show', '10', 'year', 'old', 'audience', 'did', 'contain', 'enough', 'twisted', 'humour', 'appeal', 'eclectic', 'grown', 'up', 'good', 'thing', 'came', 'Edlund', 'involvement', 'show', 'live', 'action', 'tv', 'show', 'Edlund', 'involvement', 'once', 'again', 'provided', 'series', 'was', 'directed', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'proved', 'Tick', 'character', 'was', 'easily', 'capable', 'transending', 'audience', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'however', 'show', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'much', 'too', 'early', 'DVD', 'collection', 'well', 'purchase', 'are', 'fan', 'character', 'episodes', 'are', 'clever', 'well', 'written', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'only', 'disappointments', 'can', 'sight', 'are', 'just', 'are', 'getting', 'used', 'true', 'genius', 'show', 'Not', 'even', 'enough', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'consider', 'season', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'Shame', 'studio', 'cancelling', 'show', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'be', 'thorn', 'Tick', 'side', 'no', 'matter', 'what', 'medium', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'set', 'extra', 'web', 'linked', 'meaning', 'put', 'disk', 'pc', 'drive', 'click', 'link', 'website', 'where', 'can', 'watch', 'badly', 'streamed', '20', 'minute', 'interview', 'actor', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'who', 'Tick', 'interview', 'good', 'inside', 'info', 'making', 'show', 'so', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'dvds', 'Someday', 'when', 'taken', 'offline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'access', 'anyone', 'who', 'set', 'point', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'see', 'extra', 'terrible', 'marketing', 'tactic', 'especially', 'when', 'dvds', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'beefed', 'up', 'more', 'material', 'such', 'Fans', 'deserve', 'bit', 'material', 'especially', 'series', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'set', 'rounded', 'off', 'commentary', 'select', 'episodes', 'are', 'cool', 'Great', 'overall', 'stupid', 'weblink', 'internet', 'only', 'interview', 'angers', 'enough', 'take', '1', 'star', 'otherwise', 'entertaining', 'package']",N/A

Walczak ""Lomitus""","[0, 0]","If you are considering buying ""The Tick"" and you've read through the other reviews and find yourself confused...please allow me to illuminate a little.  This review is for folks who really aren't familiar with ""The Tick"" and are trying to decide whether it's worth buying or not.  Any short comings as far as the DVD set itself have already been well addressed and documented here...this is about the show itself.  If you don't know much about The Tick, please read on....From reading the reviews both here and elsewhere, the first thing you might notice is that people either really love or really HATE ""The Tick""...there's very little in between.  From the other reviews you should have already gathered that The Tick is a parody...a (not always so) tongue in cheek spoof on the whole super hero genre.  In a world full of super hero movies that sometimes take themselves WAY too seriously ala The Xmen, The Dark Knight, etc., or were meant to be serious and were just poorly done, ala Spiderman 3, The Hulk, etc., The Tick is an off the wall poke at all of this.  There's no mind bending special effects here (other than Tick's wonderfully active antennae), the fight scenes are modestly shot with the occasional kick, punch or ""smoosh"" and the characters are...well...utterly unbelievable but in a very wonderful sort of way.  ""Captain Liberty"" for example...imagine Wonder Woman as being a sexually frustrated lady of the new millennium.  Sure she can kick butt...it's also why she can't ever manage a second date!  This show isn't about portraying ""super heroes"" in a remotely ""realistic"" sort of way, it's the punchline to the joke that the whole super hero genre really is!Now please...I enjoy a good super hero action flick as much as the next person but it's also nice to be reminded of just how outrageous this genre really is...at least if you think about it too hard! LOL!!!  People in their 30's and 40's still watching Batman?  You'd think at least a few of us would have moved out of our parents basements by now! LOL!!!""The Tick"" is for folks who don't mind ultra heavy doses of ""silly"".  If you are looking for intense drama or thought provoking definitions of good and evil...you won't find it here.  This is for folks who watch movies like the famed ""Godzilla"" legacy or the ""Airplane"" movies and who -ENJOY- just how bad some of those movies really were! LOL!  That's the genius of this show...it doesn't really take ANYTHING seriously.  When you keep all of this in mind and take it all at face value, you begin to see how truly wonderful this show is (as well as the whole Tick series as a whole, including the comic books).  You find yourself sitting there waiting for the next ""remarkably dumb thing"" to come out of the Tick's mouth.  It's exceptionally ""cheesy"" to the N'th degree...and it's supposed to be.As has been mentioned elsewhere, The Tick was a very short-lived TV series.  And as other's have said, most television executives wouldn't know -GOOD- entertainment even if it were the size of a cement truck and parked on top of them.  How an industry that embraces ""The WWF"" yet over-looks a true diamond in the rough is mind boggling. The Tick clearly never reached it's full potential but even ""as is"" it's still a wonderfully clever series for folks who want something that's MORE than just a little bit different.So if you want ""serious"" super hero action, save your money for the next mega-bucks box office thriller (and hope that the industry has learned from it's previous mistakes and/or complete disasters).  If on the other hand you really enjoy totally mindless entertainment with a wonderful cast and totally absurd situations ""The Tick"", despite any short comings of the DVD set (which considering how short the series itself was aren't many), is a wonderful investment with lots and lots of good laughs. This is truly one of those unique situations where ""it's so bad that it's wonderful""!Gravity is indeed a harsh mistress...",4,The right kind of comedy for the right frame of mind,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,3974,"['are', 'considering', 'buying', 'Tick', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'find', 'confused', 'please', 'allow', 'illuminate', 'little', 'review', 'folks', 'who', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Tick', 'are', 'trying', 'decide', 'worth', 'buying', 'not', 'Any', 'short', 'comings', 'as', 'far', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'well', 'addressed', 'documented', 'here', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Tick', 'please', 'read', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'first', 'thing', 'might', 'notice', 'people', 'really', 'love', 'really', 'HATE', 'Tick', 'very', 'little', 'other', 'reviews', 'should', 'have', 'already', 'gathered', 'Tick', 'parody', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'spoof', 'whole', 'super', 'hero', 'genre', 'world', 'full', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'take', 'WAY', 'too', 'seriously', 'Xmen', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'etc.', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'serious', 'were', 'just', 'poorly', 'done', 'ala', 'Spiderman', '3', 'Hulk', 'etc.', 'Tick', 'wall', 'poke', 'mind', 'bending', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'other', 'Tick', 'wonderfully', 'active', 'antennae', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'modestly', 'shot', 'occasional', 'kick', 'punch', 'smoosh', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'utterly', 'unbelievable', 'very', 'wonderful', 'sort', 'way', 'Captain', 'Liberty', 'example', 'imagine', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'being', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'lady', 'new', 'millennium', 'Sure', 'can', 'kick', 'butt', 'also', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'manage', 'second', 'date', 'show', ""n't"", 'portraying', 'super', 'heroes', 'remotely', 'realistic', 'sort', 'way', 'punchline', 'joke', 'whole', 'super', 'hero', 'genre', 'really', 'Now', 'please', 'enjoy', 'good', 'super', 'hero', 'action', 'flick', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'also', 'nice', 'be', 'reminded', 'just', 'how', 'outrageous', 'genre', 'really', 'least', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'LOL', 'People', '30', '40', 'still', 'watching', 'Batman', ""'d"", 'think', 'least', 'few', 'would', 'have', 'moved', 'parents', 'basements', 'now', 'LOL', 'Tick', 'folks', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'ultra', 'heavy', 'doses', 'silly', 'are', 'looking', 'intense', 'drama', 'thought', 'provoking', 'definitions', 'good', 'evil', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'folks', 'who', 'watch', 'movies', 'famed', 'Godzilla', 'legacy', 'Airplane', 'movies', 'who', '-ENJOY-', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'movies', 'really', 'were', 'LOL', 'genius', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'ANYTHING', 'seriously', 'When', 'keep', 'mind', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'begin', 'see', 'how', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'Tick', 'series', 'whole', 'including', 'comic', 'books', 'find', 'sitting', 'there', 'waiting', 'next', 'remarkably', 'dumb', 'thing', 'come', 'Tick', 'mouth', 'exceptionally', 'cheesy', ""N'th"", 'degree', 'supposed', 'be.As', 'been', 'mentioned', 'elsewhere', 'Tick', 'was', 'very', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'other', 'have', 'said', 'most', 'television', 'executives', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', '-GOOD-', 'entertainment', 'even', 'were', 'size', 'cement', 'truck', 'parked', 'top', 'How', 'industry', 'WWF', 'yet', 'over-looks', 'true', 'diamond', 'rough', 'mind', 'boggling', 'Tick', 'clearly', 'never', 'reached', 'full', 'potential', 'even', 'still', 'wonderfully', 'clever', 'series', 'folks', 'who', 'want', 'something', 'MORE', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'different.So', 'want', 'serious', 'super', 'hero', 'action', 'save', 'money', 'next', 'mega-bucks', 'box', 'office', 'thriller', 'hope', 'industry', 'learned', 'previous', 'mistakes', 'and/or', 'complete', 'disasters', 'other', 'hand', 'really', 'enjoy', 'totally', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'totally', 'absurd', 'situations', 'Tick', 'short', 'comings', 'DVD', 'set', 'considering', 'how', 'short', 'series', 'was', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'wonderful', 'investment', 'lots', 'lots', 'good', 'laughs', 'truly', 'one', 'unique', 'situations', 'where', 'so', 'bad', 'wonderful', 'Gravity', 'indeed', 'harsh', 'mistress']",N/A

The Tick stands alone atop the putrid hill of evil delivering a double-barreled dose of justice into the fowl soil that reeks with bad-doing.Why this show was cancelled is beyond me, much like `The Greatest American Hero', The Tick lives on in the thoughts and hearts of many a down trodden citizen. Bringing an animated superhero to life is no easy task, but Patrick Warburton had The Tick down cold. The antennae were a perfect match right along with the cartoon. I would have preferred a full faced mask with a giant rubber chin, but the rest of the costume was cool. Arthur (Burke) was also a good match, the moth costume was great.My only question was the other characters. Why were Deflator  Mouse and American Maid changed to Bat Manuel and Lady Liberty? Maybe it was a copyright issue or something. Both played their parts well, but Deflator Mouse was a little more arrogant and bumbling in the cartoon (this character could have been played perfectly by Adam West). And American Maid was a tougher character that would kick your butt as easy as looking at you. And what happened to Sewer Urchin? I can only hope that maybe he was planned for the second season, but alas we'll never know.The episodes on this DVD are great. Not for your straight laced stick in the mud viewers, but for folks who love entertainment like The Three Stooges. See The Tick get his Superhero license (I.P.

I unfortunately never got around to seeing it when it originally aired in 2001/02, but thankfully it's now available on DVD.I almost bought it quite a few times at Best Buy. Indeed I made a few trips out to my local store in hopes of purchasing it only to find their website's in-store availability accuracy sorely lacking. Now that I've seen it though, I think I owe the site's glitch a thank you.Not that The Tick isn't a lot of fun, it certainly has its share of very funny moments. But in the end something is missing. The problem is I can't tell you what exactly it is.Seinfeld's ""Puddy"", Patrick Warburton, pulls off a nicely thick Tick (and the costume is actually quite good), but he can't seem to find the right balance between the boxer-who's-been-hit-in-the-head-too-much mentality and his Shatner-tinged superhero speak.The supporting cast is better with David Burke as a pitch perfect Arthur, Nestor Carbonell as the swarthy Batmanuel, and the absolutely lovely Liz Vassey as Captain Liberty. All put in better than supporting role performances with Vassey's Liberty being my favorite (although that may be due to her Statue of Liberty inspired costume's flaunting her huddled masses).My favorite episode is probably ""The Funeral"" in which Captain Liberty accidentally kills legendary superhero The Immortal during a tryst. There's some good slapstick as they try to place the body back in his hotel room to make it look like an accident, and some great eulogizing by the Tick. (The best line of the episode is a military general remarking of the Tick's tribute ""I like the cut of this man's gibberish."")I couldn't help wanting The Tick to have a stereo's equivalent of an equalizer. With a little tweaking of the right comedy frequencies the show might have been something extraordinary. Instead it's just a fairly funny record that skips occasionally.Although The Tick is definitely worth a rental, save your hard earned cash in case they ever release the animated version I loved in college.",3,"Better than average, not as good as I'd hoped",1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,2067,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Tick', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', '2001/02', 'thankfully', 'now', 'available', 'DVD.I', 'almost', 'bought', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'Best', 'Buy', 'Indeed', 'made', 'few', 'trips', 'local', 'store', 'hopes', 'purchasing', 'only', 'find', 'website', 'in-store', 'availability', 'accuracy', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'think', 'owe', 'site', 'glitch', 'thank', 'you.Not', 'Tick', ""n't"", 'lot', 'fun', 'certainly', 'share', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'end', 'something', 'missing', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'exactly', 'is.Seinfeld', 'Puddy', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'nicely', 'thick', 'Tick', 'costume', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'right', 'balance', ""boxer-who's-been-hit-in-the-head-too-much"", 'mentality', 'Shatner-tinged', 'superhero', 'speak.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'better', 'David', 'Burke', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Arthur', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', 'swarthy', 'Batmanuel', 'absolutely', 'lovely', 'Liz', 'Vassey', 'Captain', 'Liberty', 'All', 'put', 'better', 'supporting', 'role', 'performances', 'Vassey', 'Liberty', 'being', 'favorite', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'inspired', 'costume', 'flaunting', 'huddled', 'masses', '.My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'probably', 'Funeral', 'Captain', 'Liberty', 'accidentally', 'legendary', 'superhero', 'Immortal', 'tryst', 'good', 'slapstick', 'try', 'place', 'body', 'back', 'hotel', 'room', 'make', 'look', 'accident', 'great', 'eulogizing', 'Tick', 'best', 'line', 'episode', 'military', 'general', 'remarking', 'Tick', 'tribute', 'like', 'cut', 'man', 'gibberish', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wanting', 'Tick', 'have', 'stereo', 'equivalent', 'equalizer', 'little', 'tweaking', 'right', 'comedy', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'Instead', 'just', 'fairly', 'funny', 'record', 'Tick', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rental', 'save', 'hard', 'earned', 'cash', 'case', 'ever', 'release', 'animated', 'version', 'loved', 'college']",N/A

768082,A3MJMZF6NHCHXX,B0000AUHQE,"Missy Hoppe ""mitmee_pie""","[2, 2]","I am writing this review in an attempt to provide an as accurate and detailed as possible comparison between the animated version of The Tick and the live action series. Until recently, I had only ever heard of The Tick because the live action series was mentioned during the introduction to episode one of Family Guy Season 4. I never gave it another thought, until I learned of the existence of the animated version of this show as part of my on-going questto attempt to collect every series I can get my hands on that Rob Paulsen has done voice work for. After reading a number of reviews of both versions of this show, I realized that I simply had to add them to my collection. Because every DVD player in my home is region free, I elected to purchase my copy of the animated series from Amazon.uk, so that I'd be sure to get all 36 glorious episodes. I ggrew up watching You Can't Do That on Television and Dangermouse, and I've only recently discovered and added such gems as Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs, the 1980's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dangermouse's spinoff series Count Duckula to my DVD collection. Suffice it to say that I have always thrived on this type of silly yet surprisingly intelligent humor. According to nearly all of the reviews I've read, the live action version of The Tick seems to compare favorably with Seinfeld, another show which I've always liked quite a lot and am proud to own all nine seasons of on DVD, and now that I've watched through the live action version of the Tick several times, I would definitely have to agree that that comparison is quite an accurate one to make. Before I formally begin my review, however, I feel that it's only fair to warn you that I'm writing this review as a totally blind individual. So, I can't make any comments regardingwhich show has better visuals; all my observations strictly pertain to the audio aspects of the show. OK. On to the review. I'll start by comparing and contrasting the four main characters which were featured in both the animated and live action versions of the series. Since the live action version of the Tick seems to be compared to Seinfeld so often, I will also make an effort to relate my character descriptions to that show as much as I possibly can.The Tick is voiced by Townsend Coleman in the animated series and played by patrick warburton in the live action series. Both versions of the show's main character are simply phenomenal, but in slightly different ways. Both versions of The Tick make a lot of hilariously nonsensical speeches. Both are extremely silly and incredibly clueless regarding nearly all aspects of daily life, but it seems to me that the animated tick is slightly more worldly than his live action counterpart. Best example: in episode eight of Season 3 of the animated series, Tick is trying to encourage Arthur to kiss Carmelita. In the live action version of the series, Tick comes across as being utterly clueless about romance: trying to accompany Arthur on his date with Stacey and otherwise interfering with their relationship. Both versions of the Tick have a lot of truely absurd and unforgettable lines: ""Keen!"" ""spoon!"" and ""Arthur, honk if you love justice"" from the animated Tick and ""a secret message from my teeth,"" ""I am the wild blue yonder,"" and ""Wicked men, you face the Tick!"" from the live action Tick. One of my favorite scenes from the live action series is when Tick is talking to the toilet while he is attempting to clean/repair it. The only negative I can think of pertaining to either version of the Tick's character is in a scene near the beginning of the first episode of the live action series when Tick calls the coffee machine his b*tch, something which I don't think is at all necessary or appropriate, especially given the otherwise seemingly child-like, innocent nature of the live-action version of the character. Don't get me wrong. That particular line would have been even more shocking and inappropriate coming from the animated Tick, but it really stands out to me because of the way the live action tick is otherwise portrayed. If one wishes to relate the live action show's incarnation of The Tick to Seinfeld, in spite of his overwhelming stupidity, I suppose that Tick would probably be closest to Jerry's character if for no other reason than because he's the main character.In Season 1 of the animated series, Arthur is voiced by Micky Dolenz after which Rob Paulsen takes over for the remaining two seasons of the series. David Burke plays the part of Arthur in the live action series. In my opinion, both Micky Dolenz and Rob Paulsen do a superb job voicing this character, but in spite of the fact that a couple of Arthur's funniest, most memorable lines occur in season one, I still have to give the slight edge to Rob Paulsen as he just does a slightly better job of bringing Arthur to life for me. To be perfectly honest, though, they actually sound so unbelievably similar to one another that there's a chance I might not have even noticed any difference between season one and the remainder of the series if I hadn't been specifically listening for the change after reading about it beforehand. I have a feeling that this is more likely than not the primary reason why I have so much trouble liking the live action version of Arthur. David Burke just doesn't sound at all like either Micky Dolenz or Rob Paulsen to me. I just can't help thinking that they should have tried a little bit harder to find someone who sounded at least vaguely similar to Arthur from the animated series. After watching a few episodes of the live action series, however, although I still couldn't forget about it entirely, I managed to more or less accept the all-too noticeable change in Arthur's voice. Never-the-less, for some reason which I still haven't been able to completely figure out, live action Arthur is still one of my least favorite characters from either version of the series. My feelings about live action Arthur are a little difficult to articulate, but I think the best way to describe the contrast between the two versions of the character is to say that at least in my humble opinion, animated Arthur is a lot more likeable. While you can tell by his tone of voice that Arthur in the animated series is often frustrated with, if not thoroughly annoyed by the Tick's stupidity and/or overenthusiastic manner, you can also clearly tell that the two of them are always a team, and that Arthur serves as the brains of the operation and does his best to look after Tick while also attempting to keep him at least moderately grounded in reality. On the other hand, in the live action version of the show, no matter how often they talk about it being to the contrary, I honestly can't sense any genuine teamwork vibe between Tick and Arthur. Live action Arthur seems to be a lot more demanding and argumentative, and he even comes across as being disrespectful, if not outright mean to Tick from time to time. More importantly, however, while Arthur in the animated series seems perfectly content with and secure in his role as Tick's sidekick, live action Arthur seems to deeply resent being labeled as just a sidekick, and we as viewers almost immediately begin to suspect that he has aspirations of some day becoming a full-fledged superhero in his own right. Finally, when it comes to worldly matters, I can't help thinking that live action Arthur may have been better suited to be pared with the animated Tick. Best example: in the animated series, it turns out that poor Arthur is too shy and/or nervous to kiss Carmelita, his supposedly steady girlfriend, while live action Arthur appears to be a lot more interested in trying to date, and it would seem that he is even hoping to possibly have sex at some point. Personality wise, I'd say that live action Arthur can best be compared to George Kostanza on Seinfeld, which makes it even harder for me to determine my reasons for not liking him. George is most definitely my favorite Seinfeld character, but I think the problem is that all of the personality quirks that make George so loveable to me just don't work in the context of Arthur's character. Besides, the animated version of Arthur is probably my favorite character from either series, so to be perfectly honest, it would be pretty tough for live action Arthur to compare favorably.In the animated series, we have the character Die Fladermaus, who is voiced by Cam Clarke. This character is replaced in the live action series by a character named Batmanuel, a delightful pun which is reminiscent of those found in abundance throughout the animated series, who is played by Nestor Carbonell. It's not entirely fair to compare these two since they're technically completely different characters, but surprisingly, they're actually quite similar to one another. Both of them have huge egos, are total cowards and both seem to be a lot more interested in talking to women and making themselves look good than actually being superheroes. To continue the Seinfeld analogy, I suppose it would be accurate to say that Batmanuel is the Kramer of the group.Last, but certainly not least, we have our female lead character. In the animated series, her name is American Maid, a spectacularly bad pun which would have definitely been right at home on either Danger Mouse or Count Duckula, and she's voiced by Kay Lenz. The live action series gives us Captain Liberty who is played by Liz Vassey. In my opinion, American Maid and Captain Liberty sound remarkably similar to one another, which only serves to add to my frustration regarding Arthur. I really like American Maid a lot. She doesn't take crap from anybody, and she somehow manages to keep Tick moderately focused in situations where Arthur has been kidnapped or is otherwise in danger. She's also quite a decent superhero. Captain Liberty strikes me as being quite a lot like American Maid in nearly all respects. I think the Seinfeld analogy can best be used here, however, because so far as I can tell, Captain Liberty seems to possess all of the best/funniest attributes from both American Maid and Elaine from Seinfeld.Now that I've done my best to describe all of the main characters from both versions of this series, I'll try to compare the actual shows themselves. I simply can't think of any words to adequately describe the animated series in particular. The only way I can explain it is to say that it takes the hilarity of shows like Animaniacs, Count Duckula, Dangermouse, Pinky and the Brain and Monty Python's Flying Circus to a whole new level. It's so off-the-wall and uniquely original that there really isn't anything that I'm aware of that I can compare it to. It's pure silliness, and that is most definitely meant to be a complement. The humor is nonstop, but they always managed to keep it completely family friendly. Every single one of the numerous villains who Tick and Arthur encounter over the course of the 36 episodes of the animated series are just delitiously bizarre, and more often than not, they're spectacularly incompetant as well. In order of appearance, the most prominantly featured villains include: The Idea Men; Chairface Chippendale and his partner Chrome Dome; Dinosaur Neil; Mister Mental and his reluctant assistant Minda; The breadmaster; El Seed along with his helpers the bee twins and Rosebud; Evil Tongue Thrakorzog along with his creation the mucace tick; Charles the brainchild; the evil dictator Pokopo; Protoclown; The Human ton and his little friend Handy; The Swiss commandos; Omnipotus; Venus and her eager accomplice Milo; The Mother of Invention; The Ottoman empress; The Deadly Bulb and his assistants wat and socket; Betty Queen of the ants; The Fin and last, but certainly not least, the evil midnight bomber what bombs at midnight. Unfortunately, the only major villains mentioned in the live action series are the Red Scare, Apocalypse Cow and Destroyo. In all fairness, though, the live action series is intended to be more focused on the characters' down time when they aren't fighting villains. Both versions of the show do have episodes featuring The Terror, however, which I must admit is extremely awesome because he's definitely one of my favorite villains. One minor disappointment with the live action series, however,  is that they don't have counterparts to some of the animated show's other superheroes. I think that instead of introducing the superhero character Firey Blaze and his somewhat annoying sidekick Friendly Fire, it would have been far better if they could have shown us live action equivalents of The Sewer Urchin, the caped chameleon and/or the human bullet. Despite the many differences between the two versions of the show, there are also a number of aspects which both versions of the series have in common. The three most noteable examples of lines or situations that I can think of which both incarnations of the series share are when Tick sees Arthur's apartment for the first time, when Tick states that gravity is a harsh mistress, and to a far more limited extent, when Tick and Arthur meet up with Arthur's sister. I came across several other nods to the animated series scattered throughout the nine episodes of the live action series, but I think that half the fun of watching it is discovering these totally obscure references for yourself. Aside from its favorable comparison to Seinfeld, another positive thing I can say about the live action series is that its theme music is much better. As much as I love the animated series, its theme music is, to quote the animated Tick, ""just plain awful!"" Once it gets stuck in your head, it absolutely refuses to leave, and I think it would have been really cool to hear the animated Tick do an intro to the show similar to the one in the live action series.I must confess that at first, I really disliked the live action version of The Tick. Even as similar as it was to Seinfeld: four main characters with lots of relationship issues, that still wasn't enough to make it worth watching at first. My initial impression was that although the live action version of the Tick had a number of laugh out loud moments, so much of its humor was clearly intended to appeal to an adult audience that I just had a lot of trouble getting into it. The animated series never found it necessary to resort to using profanity to make a joke. I even went as far as to sell my first copy of the live action series to a friend who was extremely happy to get it, but for some reason, I just couldn't seem to get the show out of my head, so I ended up deciding to repurchase it when I was lucky enough to find it in like new condition for less than half of its retail price. I'm not sure if there was something magical in my second copy having the pretty blue case which the live action series was originally released in, but for some reason, I absolutely loved it the second time I watched it. Even live action Arthur was significantly more tolerable to me than he had been initially. I think it also may have helped that I took the time to listen to all four of the commentaries which were available when I watched the live action series for the second time. I think that more than anything else, the information I acquired from the commentaries enabled me to understand and fully appreciate the live action series.Bottom line: as far as I'm concerned, The Tick animated series will always be the definitive version, but if you're able to overlook the occasional swear word here and there, the live action series does have quite a lot to offer and is almost as enjoyable in nearly all respects. I would highly recommend both versions of The Tick, but if you can only afford to buy one, I would highly recommend that you start with the animated series first, and if at all possible, try to get your hands on the non-US version so that you don't miss a single second of the Tick's endlessly entertaining insanity. Then, if you're still craving more of the Tick's marvelously unique antics, proceed directly to purchasing the live action series. I can practically guarantee that you'll never regret either purchase.",5,The tic: Live Action Series Verses Animated Series,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,16199,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'attempt',

In the main I preferred the animated version better and it would seem it is easier to get character cartoon voices rather than cartoon character actors.It has already been said and may not be possible to overstate that Patrick Warburton was born to the role of The Tick. The living Author (David Burke) provided a surprisingly accurate sidekick performance while the other two series regulars Capt. Liberty (Liz Vassey) and Batmaniel (Nestor Carbonell) provided uneven but mostly funny backup.The living Tick proved every bit as adapt at mouthing extensive vapid mixed metaphors of justice which were mostly funny. The too often repeated gags involving him not able to recognize fellow superheroes when they were in civvies wore a bit thin; although there was an extremely last-minute comedic save.Production values and special effects were minimal emphasizing that:  this was a shoestring production but also that this was a character and dialogue driven program rather than a bunch of flash bangs and laser lights. Think very early Dr. Who; backed by nothing but very droll and dry insider joke writers.I did not choose to listen to all of the commentary but it was fun to learn that Patrick Warburton was a little jealous of the puppeteers who controlled his antenna. Sometimes they did get a bigger laugh than he did. Such of the other commentaries I did listen to were filled with interesting show related trivia and side stories but I generally do not buy DVDs for the commentary.The Tick, whether live action or animated is not going to appeal to everyone; but if you dig than I can recommend you get this set.",4,That kind of rarefied humor you'll either get it or you won't,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1673,"['short', 'answer', 'humor', 'Tick', 'works', 'main', 'preferred', 'animated', 'version', 'better', 'would', 'seem', 'easier', 'get', 'character', 'cartoon', 'voices', 'rather', 'cartoon', 'character', 'actors.It', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'overstate', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'was', 'born', 'role', 'Tick', 'living', 'Author', 'David', 'Burke', 'provided', 'surprisingly', 'accurate', 'sidekick', 'performance', 'other', 'two', 'series', 'regulars', 'Capt', 'Liberty', 'Liz', 'Vassey', 'Batmaniel', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', 'provided', 'uneven', 'mostly', 'funny', 'backup.The', 'living', 'Tick', 'proved', 'bit', 'adapt', 'mouthing', 'extensive', 'vapid', 'mixed', 'metaphors', 'justice', 'were', 'mostly', 'funny', 'too', 'often', 'repeated', 'gags', 'involving', 'not', 'able', 'recognize', 'fellow', 'superheroes', 'when', 'were', 'civvies', 'wore', 'bit', 'thin', 'was', 'extremely', 'last-minute', 'comedic', 'save.Production', 'values', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'minimal', 'emphasizing', 'was', 'shoestring', 'production', 'also', 'was', 'character', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'program', 'rather', 'bunch', 'flash', 'bangs', 'laser', 'lights', 'Think', 'very', 'early', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'backed', 'nothing', 'very', 'droll', 'dry', 'insider', 'joke', 'writers.I', 'did', 'not', 'choose', 'listen', 'commentary', 'was', 'fun', 'learn', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'was', 'little', 'jealous', 'puppeteers', 'who', 'controlled', 'antenna', 'Sometimes', 'did', 'get', 'bigger', 'laugh', 'did', 'Such', 'other', 'commentaries', 'did', 'listen', 'were', 'filled', 'interesting', 'show', 'related', 'trivia', 'side', 'stories', 'generally', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'commentary.The', 'Tick', 'live', 'action', 'animated', 'not', 'going', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'dig', 'can', 'recommend', 'get', 'set']",N/A

768089,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000AUHQE,Robert Moore,"[46, 47]","I have argued to friends that TV is a medium with vaster potential than cinema.  TV has an extraordinary advantage:  more time, time to develop characters, story lines, long story arcs (a 500 minute story will beat a 100 minute story if you have a good script writer involved), and anything else you care to produce.  But unfortunately TV as we have known it is largely a dismal affair:  television executives.  Show me a new show with creative brilliance, great writing, wonderful characters, and intelligence, and I will show you a series that is probably not going to be long in this world.  TV execs want series that you can grasp and completely understand while eating a sandwich and drinking a beer, chatting the whole time with friends on the phone.THE TICK is one of these unfortunate shows that made the mistake of trying to do something original and different, and to do this with tremendous wit and intelligence.  I have to be honest:  THE TICK never became a great show, but it is obvious that it had the potential for greatness.  Shows always take some time to find their feet.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER didn't become truly great until the second season, and most series follow this pattern.  They get better as they go along, and unfortunately THE TICK didn't get to fulfill its potential.The genius behind THE TICK is Ben Edlund, who followed the cancellation of THE TICK with some utterly brilliant scripts for FIREFLY and ANGEL.  Edlund breaks many standard conventions with THE TICK.  For one thing, we never really learn all that much about The Tick.  Most super hero shows deal at length with back story, but despite having appeared in comics, in an animated series, and a live action series, we know little more about The Tick at end than we did at the beginning.  We know that he is a bit of a well meaning dimwit, given to extravagantly complex and high flown sentences, good hearted, virtually indestructible, and apparently about as strong as Superman.  He might, in fact, be less vulnerable than Superman, since he apparently doesn't have his own version of Kryptonite.  Apart from vulnerability and super strength, however, it isn't clear that he has any other powers.  He lives in a city filled with super heroes, but amazingly few if any of them possess their own super abilities.  Most achieve their trademarks stunts through gimmicks, like The Tick's sidekick Arthur, who can only fly when opening his moth wings out of a backpack.  But The Tick truly is blessed with almost godlike abilities.Although we only had the show for nine episodes, it was clear that it was going to be a superbly written, well-conceived series.  The four performers making up the heart of the show were all great, especially Patrick Warburton in the title role.  David Burke was great as Arthur, a nebbish accountant who had Walter Mitty fantasies of becoming a crime fighting super hero, which he largely fulfills by becoming The Tick's sidekick.  Liz Vassey plays Janet aka Captain Liberty, who although a very effective hero (in fact, after The Tick, she seems to be the only one of the four who actually does any crime fighting), is beset by a host of personal problems, mostly having to do with men and her willingness to giver herself to them.  Nestor Carbonell often steals the show as the would be Romeo and super hero chick magnet Batmanuel.  Although apparently bereft of any crime fighting abilities, Batmanuel seems to have become a superhero for the same reason that some guys join bands:  the chicks.  The quality of the guest stars was consistently superb, with name performers like Ron Perlman (almost unrecognizable under the worst hair do one could ever hope to see on a super hero), Christopher Lloyd as Arthur's boss in the pilot, and Armin Shimerman (who is best known in make up as Quark from DEEP SPACE NINE and out of make up as Principal Snyder from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), who is truly unrecognizable as the elderly super villain Destroyo.The DVD set isn't great, I'll admit, but I think many reviewers exaggerate how bad they are.

Matching the goofy heights reached by the excellent cartoon in a measly nine half-hour episodes, there's no telling what Sonnenfeld and company could have done with this series. Unfortunately, it looks like there never will be any telling, as the show was unceremoniously canned before the last episode even aired. Still, there's mirth aplenty in this strangely sparse 2-DVD set; Christopher Lloyd guest stars in an episode, as do Ron Perlman (Hellboy) and John de Lancie (Star Trek: TNG's Q). Warburton's Tick seems right at home alongside David Burke's Arthur, as well as new Edlund creations Batmanuel and Captain Liberty (ably acted by the hilariously oversexed Nestor Carbonell and the ever-serious Liz Vassey, respectively). Commentary tracks with Barry Sonnenfeld (who produced the series and directed the first episode) and Ben Edlund (who wrote the comic book back when it was an underground sensation) are available for nearly every episode, and a few poorly-selected trailers are on the second disc.

768091,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B0000AUHQE,S.E. Poza,"[5, 5]","You probably don't have to be a fan of comics or comic books to enjoy ""The Tick"" but it probably wouldn't hurt. A great deal of the Tick's dialog is very cleverly written parody of standard superhero talk from the 1950s through the 1970s (when superheroes were more earnest and genuine rather than dark and ""cool"").The basic premise of the Tick is a parody of the Justice League and other groups of superheroes who seem to work together in the same location. After protecting a bus stop and concluding (with a little help from those who work at the bus stop) that his work there is done, the Tick heads for ""the City"" where a variety of other superheroes live and work. He soon meets Arthur, a former accountant destined to be his sidekick.Patrick Warburton plays the Tick perfectly as big, dumb and wholesomely dedicated to exterminating all evil. He's beyond clueless but is able to deliver stirring monologues on the pursuit of justice - well, they are stirring to him, confusing to his cohorts and funny for the viewer. It's the delivery and juxtaposition of these monologues that is often the root of the most effective humor in the show.David Burke takes on the task of playing the straight man (Arthur) who functions not only as a sidekick but also as a psuedo-guardian of the homeless, penniless, and almost amnesiac (at times) Tick. While he physically doesn't suit the role (they obviously padded him to make him resemble the pudgy comic book Arthur), he plays the part well.Very little actual crime fighting is done in the show but that's okay because the dynamic between the Tick and his crime fighting buddies is where the fun is, particularly when focussing on everyday requirements and functions (like tossing a salad or getting a license). I never read the Tick comics (thought I did watch all of the animated series - which I'd love to get on DVD as well) but I would guess that the basis of them must have been how superheroes live in their daily life.It's likely that The Tick didn't last because it defied easy pigeon-holing. While obviously a comedy, it was probably confusing as to whether it targeted kids or adults and the characters are so square in their delivery and outlook that you could miss that the show was a parody if you had a very short attention span and weren't really listening to the dialog. The show was definitely for adults.As for the DVD itself, the commentary is sporadic and hard to find but what is even more disgraceful is that the episode listing on the booklet inside is one side of a double-sided advertisement for other DVDs. Since this isn't an especially cheap package, this is inexcusably chintzy. On the other hand, the plastic case itself seemed to have been carefully chosen as it's a Tick-style deep blue with a more expensive double-sided disc design than most standard cases.It's truly a shame only 9 episodes of this show were made. It's also unfortunate that some other network didn't run with it after it was cancelled by Fox. The comedy is fresh and well-written and anyone who is keen for something unique and funny should buy the DVDs and savor what little there is.",4,"5-star show, 3-star DVD",1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,3133,"['probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'comics', 'comic', 'books', 'enjoy', 'Tick', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'great', 'deal', 'Tick', 'dialog', 'very', 'cleverly', 'written', 'parody', 'standard', 'superhero', 'talk', '1950s', '1970s', 'when', 'superheroes', 'were', 'more', 'earnest', 'genuine', 'rather', 'dark', 'cool', '.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'Tick', 'parody', 'Justice', 'League', 'other', 'groups', 'superheroes', 'who', 'seem', 'work', 'together', 'same', 'location', 'protecting', 'bus', 'stop', 'concluding', 'little', 'help', 'who', 'work', 'bus', 'stop', 'work', 'done', 'Tick', 'heads', 'City', 'where', 'variety', 'other', 'superheroes', 'live', 'work', 'soon', 'Arthur', 'former', 'accountant', 'destined', 'be', 'sidekick.Patrick', 'Warburton', 'Tick', 'perfectly', 'big', 'dumb', 'wholesomely', 'dedicated', 'exterminating', 'evil', 'clueless', 'able', 'deliver', 'stirring', 'monologues', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'well', 'are', 'stirring', 'confusing', 'cohorts', 'funny', 'viewer', 'delivery', 'juxtaposition', 'monologues', 'often', 'root', 'most', 'effective', 'humor', 'show.David', 'Burke', 'task', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'Arthur', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'sidekick', 'also', 'psuedo-guardian', 'homeless', 'penniless', 'almost', 'amnesiac', 'times', 'Tick', 'physically', ""n't"", 'suit', 'role', 'obviously', 'padded', 'make', 'resemble', 'pudgy', 'comic', 'book', 'Arthur', 'part', 'well.Very', 'little', 'actual', 'crime', 'fighting', 'done', 'show', 'okay', 'dynamic', 'Tick', 'crime', 'fighting', 'buddies', 'where', 'fun', 'particularly', 'when', 'focussing', 'everyday', 'requirements', 'functions', 'tossing', 'salad', 'getting', 'license', 'never', 'read', 'Tick', 'comics', 'thought', 'did', 'watch', 'animated', 'series', ""'d"", 'love', 'get', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'guess', 'basis', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'how', 'superheroes', 'live', 'daily', 'life.It', 'likely', 'Tick', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'defied', 'easy', 'pigeon-holing', 'obviously', 'comedy', 'was', 'probably', 'confusing', 'targeted', 'kids', 'adults', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'square', 'delivery', 'outlook', 'could', 'miss', 'show', 'was', 'parody', 'had', 'very', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'listening', 'dialog', 'show', 'was', 'definitely', 'adults.As', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'sporadic', 'hard', 'find', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'disgraceful', 'episode', 'listing', 'booklet', 'inside', 'one', 'side', 'double-sided', 'advertisement', 'other', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'especially', 'cheap', 'package', 'inexcusably', 'chintzy', 'other', 'hand', 'plastic', 'case', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'Tick-style', 'deep', 'blue', 'more', 'expensive', 'double-sided', 'disc', 'design', 'most', 'standard', 'cases.It', 'truly', 'shame', 'only', '9', 'episodes', 'show', 'were', 'made', 'also', 'unfortunate', 'other', 'network', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'was', 'cancelled', 'Fox', 'comedy', 'fresh', 'well-written', 'anyone', 'who', 'keen', 'something', 'unique', 'funny', 'should', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'savor', 'what', 'little']",N/A

Compliments to any and all responsible for bringing the entire series to dvd.""The Tick"" was so absurd and off the wall it's not hard to see why it made the suits nervous.  It's hard to market test something this unique, and safer to pull the plug on it before giving it a chance to find its audience.The Tick, of course, is the ""big blue jug of justice"" played PERFECTLY by Patrick Warburton (Elaine's boyfriend Putty on ""Seinfeld"").  Decked out in a loud blue outfit with interactive antennae Warburton  IS the Tick, a super hero dedicated to crime fighting.  His sidekick is Arthur (David Burke), a super-hero wannabe - he wears a white jumpsuit thing with pop-out wings and slick antenna thingies on the top of his head.  Most of the time he looks like a rabbit. Rounding out the erstwhile group is Captain Liberty (Liz Vassey) and Batmanuel (Nestor Carbonell).The cast is simply first rate and very funny, although poor sidekick Arthur has to play the straight man (which he does extremely well) most of the time.  The writing is strong throughout the short series, as well.  How can you not fall for a series when a four-hundred-pound blue Tick opens a program with these eulogizing words?  ""Let's look at the word `funeral'.  Starts with the word `fun,' doesn't it?""  Add Warburton's pitch-perfect line reading and the hook is set deep.What about this typical non-sequitur throwaway - ""Look at me.  Babbling like the brook that knew too much.""  Or this little exchange between Arthur and the Tick - ""Why is that man wearing a dress?""  ""Because he's a judge.""  ""Well, I judge the judge funny.""Four or five of the episodes come with commentary tracks.  All by Tick creator Ben Edlund save for the first, the pilot episode directed by Hollywood veteran Barry Sonnenfeld.  Besides giving us behind-the-scene info on the series, Sonnenfeld also discusses his frustrations with network executives and the chance that if they sell enough dvds they might, just might, create enough of an underswell to allow them to make a feature length movie with this cast.",5,I am the wild blue yonder,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,2139,"['Shame', 'Fox', 'canceling', 'Tick', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'only', 'nine', 'episodes', 'Compliments', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'entire', 'series', 'dvd', 'Tick', 'was', 'so', 'absurd', 'wall', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'made', 'suits', 'nervous', 'hard', 'market', 'test', 'something', 'unique', 'safer', 'pull', 'plug', 'giving', 'chance', 'find', 'audience.The', 'Tick', 'course', 'big', 'blue', 'jug', 'justice', 'played', 'PERFECTLY', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'Elaine', 'boyfriend', 'Putty', 'Seinfeld', 'Decked', 'out', 'loud', 'blue', 'outfit', 'interactive', 'antennae', 'Warburton', 'Tick', 'super', 'hero', 'dedicated', 'crime', 'fighting', 'sidekick', 'Arthur', 'David', 'Burke', 'super-hero', 'wannabe', 'white', 'jumpsuit', 'thing', 'pop-out', 'wings', 'slick', 'antenna', 'thingies', 'top', 'head', 'Most', 'time', 'rabbit', 'Rounding', 'out', 'erstwhile', 'group', 'Captain', 'Liberty', 'Liz', 'Vassey', 'Batmanuel', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', '.The', 'cast', 'simply', 'first', 'rate', 'very', 'funny', 'poor', 'sidekick', 'Arthur', 'play', 'straight', 'man', 'extremely', 'well', 'most', 'time', 'writing', 'strong', 'short', 'series', 'well', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'fall', 'series', 'when', 'four-hundred-pound', 'blue', 'Tick', 'program', 'eulogizing', 'words', 'Let', 'look', 'word', 'funeral', 'word', 'fun', ""n't"", 'Add', 'Warburton', 'pitch-perfect', 'line', 'reading', 'hook', 'set', 'deep.What', 'typical', 'non-sequitur', 'throwaway', 'Look', 'Babbling', 'brook', 'knew', 'too', 'much', 'little', 'exchange', 'Arthur', 'Tick', 'Why', 'man', 'wearing', 'dress', 'judge', 'Well', 'judge', 'judge', 'funny', 'Four', 'five', 'episodes', 'come', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Tick', 'creator', 'Ben', 'Edlund', 'save', 'first', 'pilot', 'episode', 'directed', 'Hollywood', 'veteran', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'giving', 'behind-the-scene', 'info', 'series', 'Sonnenfeld', 'also', 'frustrations', 'network', 'executives', 'chance', 'sell', 'enough', 'dvds', 'might', 'just', 'might', 'create', 'enough', 'underswell', 'allow', 'make', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'cast']",N/A

I guess it was just too funny and clever for mainstream viewers or stuffy advertisers.  I can't compare this to the Tick cartoon, as I never saw it, but this version with live actors is very smart and very funny.  Whoever was in charge of casting did a 100% right-on job with their choices.  Patrick Warburton (you may remember him as David Putty on Seinfeld) is PERFECT -- he delivers some of the wackiest, off-the-wall remarks in his deep, dead-pan voice.  It's worth the price of the DVD just to see him deliver the eulogy at another super hero's funeral, where he talks about how death happens to everybody, not just dead people; death even happens to horses and potatoes (episode &quot;The Funeral&quot; on disk two).  It's so sad that there are only 9 episodes, but I'm thankful they're available on DVD.  &quot;The Tick&quot; is one of a handful of smart, funny shows that got axed way too soon (Andy Richter Controls the Universe, and The Job are two other such shows) ... at least The Tick is out on DVD, unlike Andy and The Job.

No, not really. That's the sad part of this story. It's almost as if Fox, uncertain of what it had, aired the series as an after thought. This short lived (9 episodes only 8 of which were every aired)series managed to spoof comics, superheroes and just about everything else inbetween during its brief lifespan. AND YOU LUCKY VIEWER MAY SEE THE LUMINOUS POWER, THE HEROISM AND GREAT DEEDS OF THE TICK.On these two all too brief DVDs we get the entire run of the series (it was greenlit for only 8 additional episodes beyond the pilot. That demonstrates uncertainty)plus witty commentary by producer/director Barry Sonnenfeld. The extras are pretty meager but I'm actually happy to have the series available on DVD at all. Now if only Fox would get around to putting the witty cartoon series on DVD as well, I'd be a happy fan.For what it's worth the picture quality is pristine, the sound exceptional and the performances a combination of witty, clueless and over-the-top. Those are all good things. Patrick Warburton is the embodiment of The Tick; he reels off the corny, warmed over dialogue as if it was second nature to him. The suit and his hyperactive antennae help bring his performance to life but it's all in the performance. Warburton is perfection. The rest of the cast is magnificient as well. All perfectly capture Ben Edlund's creation. The primary color, surreal and minimalist sets all add to the comic book illusion.If you appreciate dry humor with a bit of stupidity and an edge, then you'll definitely enjoy The Tick.",4,Classic dry witted The Tick will get stuck on you,1064966400,"10 1, 2003",2003,1644,"['wit', 'as', 'dry', 'desert', 'Tick', 'premiered', '2001', 'audience', 'millions', 'became', 'huge', 'hit', 'No', 'not', 'really', 'sad', 'part', 'story', 'almost', 'Fox', 'uncertain', 'what', 'had', 'aired', 'series', 'thought', 'short', 'lived', '9', 'only', '8', 'were', 'aired', 'series', 'managed', 'spoof', 'comics', 'superheroes', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'inbetween', 'brief', 'lifespan', 'YOU', 'LUCKY', 'VIEWER', 'MAY', 'SEE', 'THE', 'LUMINOUS', 'POWER', 'THE', 'HEROISM', 'AND', 'GREAT', 'DEEDS', 'THE', 'TICK.On', 'two', 'too', 'brief', 'DVDs', 'get', 'entire', 'run', 'series', 'was', 'greenlit', 'only', '8', 'additional', 'episodes', 'pilot', 'uncertainty', 'witty', 'commentary', 'producer/director', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'meager', ""'m"", 'actually', 'happy', 'have', 'series', 'available', 'DVD', 'Now', 'only', 'Fox', 'would', 'get', 'putting', 'witty', 'cartoon', 'series', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'fan.For', 'what', 'picture', 'quality', 'pristine', 'sound', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'combination', 'witty', 'clueless', 'over-the-top', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'embodiment', 'Tick', 'corny', 'warmed', 'over', 'dialogue', 'was', 'second', 'nature', 'suit', 'hyperactive', 'antennae', 'help', 'bring', 'performance', 'life', 'performance', 'Warburton', 'perfection', 'rest', 'cast', 'magnificient', 'as', 'well', 'perfectly', 'capture', 'Ben', 'Edlund', 'creation', 'primary', 'color', 'surreal', 'minimalist', 'sets', 'add', 'comic', 'book', 'illusion.If', 'appreciate', 'dry', 'humor', 'bit', 'stupidity', 'edge', 'then', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'Tick']",N/A

768103,A2S2QOH5JERUV7,B0000AUHQE,William,"[5, 5]","Superheroes are becoming big movie stars these days like Spider-man and the X-men.  They are getting the big-time treatment and it's generally being done well.  But superhero movies have to gloss over the silly conventions of superheroes a bit.  They still have the weird costumes, death rays, and over-the-top villains, but they are tweaked just a bit or ""updated"" so contemporary audiences won't snicker too much.The Tick, on the other hand, fully embraces the silliness of the superhero life.  You're supposed to snicker, and I did.  In particular, it thumbs its nose at the stoic heroes of DC comics.  The DC heroes, which include Superman and Batman, are career superheroes.  That is, their lives are ABOUT being superheroes and their civilian identities are just convenient disguises.Well, in the world of the Tick, the heroes are so career minded they usually don't even HAVE secret identities.  The heroes wear their costumes, complete with antennae or ""bunny ears,"" even while sitting in a booth at a coffee shop or going out on a date.  And unlike the DC heroes, they just can't afford a cool headquarters or fortress of solitude.  This often puts them in compromising positions.  Like when Arthur (David Burke) visits his family in his moth costume and they commit him to a mental institution, or when Captain Liberty (Liz Vassey) tries to stop some naughty photos of herself from being published so she won't get court-martialed.  Or when Bat-Manuel (Nestor Carbonell) hires a publicist to boost his reputation and instead gets published as the ""laugh-of-the-day"" photo.The Tick himself is a dim-witted lug of a hero.  He lives to fight crime, but try explaining why his sidekick Arthur wants to go out on a date instead of fight crime and he just won't get it.  As played by Patrick Warburton (`Putty' from Seinfeld) The Tick is a likable muscle-head just doing what he loves, busting criminal's heads together.  It's really funny to see this clueless wonder try and help his friends adjust to the ups and downs of superhero life between super-battles.  In fact the show is primarily about those moments.  You never get to see the battle with Apocalypse-Cow (the mere mention of it is funny enough)so they can concentrate more on the silliness of these characters trying to adjust to their peculiar ""lifestyle.""Much of the show's charm comes from its observation that people inevitably make themselves look silly in the pursuit of their dreams.  Are they ultimately doing good in that pursuit?  For the most part.  They manage to save Jimmy Carter from a communist robot from the seventies but they scare him half out of his mind in the process.  More importantly, it's funny to watch.I must admit I have a weakness for old-fashioned superheroes, both serious and silly, and this fondness for the superhero genre does boost my appreciation of The Tick.  Society sometimes prefers the anti-heroes (Dirty Harry, The Terminator, etc.), with selfish motives who indiscriminately blow the bad guys away.  But I've always loved the idealism of the good guys like Spider-man and Superman whether it's played for laughs or drama.  The Tick affectionately ridicules these kinds of heroes and it does it very well.  I gladly snatched up this dvd set when I saw it.

The Tick has a super-dense head that renders him insufferable. But off-the-wall funny.We're living in the Platinum Age of television. There's so much air time to fill that the networks have no choice but to let genuinely talented people create programming. This doesn't mean their creations will find and hold an audience, however. So it was with the live-action version of ""The Tick,"" which had a miserable run of only eight episodes on Fox.As Barry Sonnenfeld explains in the commentary, Fox bought the program because it was offbeat and weird -- then complained they didn't like it because it was offbeat and weird. It's hands-down the best-ever TV superhero sendup (including ""Captain Nice"" and even ""The Greatest American Hero"") -- just a little too sophisticated, a little too off-center for most viewers. You know -- ""too good for television"".I didn't care much for the animated version of ""The Tick."" It was only sporadically funny, and couldn't decide whether it was aimed at an adult or juvenile audience.The live-action version is strictly adult, both in sensibility and humor. There are plenty of sexual and scatological jokes, most of them subtle. Some are not -- Batmanuel's logo is an oval containing the letters BM. (Remember the souvenir belt Harris bought for Barney Miller?)Ben Edlund showed remarkable insight and skill in adjusting the tone of ""The Tick"" to the TV medium. The stories more often revolve around the day-to-day lives and social (or not) interactions of the superheroes than their response to villainy. The result is the first superhero ""comedy of manners"" (ie, ""a satire of the manners and customs of a section of society""). And Edlund had the sense to make the quasi-normal Arthur the character we ""identify"" with and ""see"" the stories through.The writers don't hesitate to make in-joke references to other superheros -- ""The Greatest American Hero"" (in ""Arthur, Interrupted""), and their rip-off of the purse-robbery scene from ""Superman -- the Motion Picture"" (""The License""). (Did I miss any?)With an obviously limited budget, there are only minimal super-hero special effects. Some viewers miss them. I, on the other hand, appreciate _not_ seeing Apocalypse Cow. Like Jack Benny's basement vault, a colossal kine shooting flame from its udders is funnier imagined than seen.The guest-star casting is first-rate -- Armin Shimerman as The Terror and Ron Perlman as Fiery Blaze (a subtle reference to his role in ""Quest for Fire""?). But none tops The Tick's antennae, which steal every scene they're in (to Patrick Warburton's great displeasure).""The Tick"" is not only one of the all-time-great TV series, it is a great work of art. The quality of the writing, especially, is remarkable for any medium. ""The Tick"" is a classic worth _many_ repeat viewings.
