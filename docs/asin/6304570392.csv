428682,AVBYL0BIAZ8IB,6304570392,Aaron J. Palmer,"[6, 7]","NFL Films produces some good stuff, so I picked up this two disk set.  I was disappointed in nearly every aspect of this set.  First, the ""history"" is a typical NFL film with lots of game footage and the kind of music you would expect to hear on something like ""Inside the NFL.""  How could anyone possibly call this a ""complete history,"" when the main feature (covering a period of nearly 80 years) is just under 60 minutes!  Little to nothing is said on the years between Lambeau and Lombardi and between Lombardi and Holmgren.  Infante is not even mentioned.  Relatively little biographical information is presented on Lambeau, Lombardi, or anyone else, and there was surprisingly little shown of Lombardi other than him stalking the sidelines.  If you are a Green Bay Packer's fan, chances are you already know everything presented in the ""complete history,"" and have probably seen much of the footage in other contexts.The special features on disk 1 are laughably week and not worth mentioning.  Given how little there really is on disk 1 (60 minutes for the feature and perhaps 25 minutes of extras) one wonders why there are two disks at all.  Disk 2 is a different story.  It's main feature is an approximately 75 minute feature (and a few extras) on the Ice Bowl, which is excellent in both quality and detail.  In my opinion, it puts the first disk to shame.In the end, I cannot recommend buying this set.  The Green Bay Packers have a long, rich history that deserves far better than an incomplete and pitiful 60 minute NFL films treatment.  If you buy this set, but it for the Ice Bowl feature.",2,"Incomplete ""History"" of the Green Bay Packers",1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,1605,"['NFL', 'Films', 'good', 'stuff', 'picked', 'up', 'two', 'disk', 'set', 'was', 'disappointed', 'nearly', 'aspect', 'set', 'First', 'history', 'typical', 'NFL', 'film', 'lots', 'game', 'footage', 'kind', 'music', 'would', 'expect', 'hear', 'something', 'NFL', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'possibly', 'call', 'complete', 'history', 'when', 'main', 'feature', 'covering', 'period', 'nearly', '80', 'years', 'just', '60', 'minutes', 'Little', 'nothing', 'said', 'years', 'Lambeau', 'Lombardi', 'Lombardi', 'Holmgren', 'Infante', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'Relatively', 'little', 'biographical', 'information', 'presented', 'Lambeau', 'Lombardi', 'anyone', 'else', 'there', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'shown', 'Lombardi', 'other', 'stalking', 'sidelines', 'are', 'Green', 'Bay', 'Packer', 'fan', 'chances', 'are', 'already', 'know', 'everything', 'presented', 'complete', 'history', 'have', 'probably', 'seen', 'much', 'footage', 'other', 'contexts.The', 'special', 'features', 'disk', '1', 'are', 'laughably', 'week', 'not', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Given', 'how', 'little', 'really', 'disk', '1', '60', 'minutes', 'feature', 'perhaps', '25', 'minutes', 'extras', 'one', 'why', 'are', 'two', 'disks', 'Disk', '2', 'different', 'story', 'main', 'feature', 'approximately', '75', 'minute', 'feature', 'few', 'extras', 'Ice', 'Bowl', 'excellent', 'quality', 'detail', 'opinion', 'first', 'disk', 'shame.In', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'buying', 'set', 'Green', 'Bay', 'Packers', 'have', 'long', 'rich', 'history', 'far', 'better', 'incomplete', 'pitiful', '60', 'minute', 'NFL', 'films', 'treatment', 'buy', 'set', 'Ice', 'Bowl', 'feature']",The NFL's Greatest Games: The Ice Bowl VHS
428683,A1CHSP7NKY3YB2,6304570392,A. Hogan,"[44, 46]","The ice bowl is the first football game I have clear memory of. This tape,which is very well done, sets s up the game by showing what happened the year before in the championship game in Dallas,and how the Cowboys were ready to avenge that loss. Also, juxtaposed nicely, are the story of the 1967 packers, in the final year of their glory under Vince Lombardi. The tape brings the voice of Ray Scott,longtime voice of the packers and the NFL before the corporate suits took over the broadcast booth with ex jocks. The the game itself is shown virtually in its entirity, with clever voiceover by Scott sounding very much .like it did that day. With the temperature being -16 below zero, the players and fans literally were trying to survive as well as win. This is the best of the NFL tapes that I have seen,perhaps because of the seminal importance of the game,or simply for nostalgic reasons. Either way, this is an excellent tape and a good bargain,considering that you are likely to re-watch a sports tape. And, listening to the voice of the great Ray Scott is a distinct pleasure.",5,Perhaps the last game before football went corporate,985219200,"03 22, 2001",2001,1084,"['ice', 'bowl', 'first', 'football', 'game', 'have', 'clear', 'memory', 'tape', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'sets', 's', 'up', 'game', 'showing', 'what', 'happened', 'year', 'championship', 'game', 'Dallas', 'how', 'Cowboys', 'were', 'ready', 'avenge', 'loss', 'Also', 'juxtaposed', 'nicely', 'are', 'story', '1967', 'packers', 'final', 'year', 'glory', 'Vince', 'Lombardi', 'tape', 'voice', 'Ray', 'Scott', 'longtime', 'voice', 'packers', 'NFL', 'corporate', 'suits', 'took', 'over', 'broadcast', 'booth', 'ex', 'jocks', 'game', 'shown', 'virtually', 'entirity', 'clever', 'voiceover', 'Scott', 'sounding', 'very', 'much', 'did', 'day', 'temperature', 'being', '-16', 'zero', 'players', 'fans', 'literally', 'were', 'trying', 'survive', 'as', 'well', 'win', 'best', 'NFL', 'tapes', 'have', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'seminal', 'importance', 'game', 'simply', 'nostalgic', 'reasons', 'way', 'excellent', 'tape', 'good', 'bargain', 'considering', 'are', 'likely', 're-watch', 'sports', 'tape', 'listening', 'voice', 'great', 'Ray', 'Scott', 'distinct', 'pleasure']",The NFL's Greatest Games: The Ice Bowl VHS
428684,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6304570392,calvinnme,"[4, 4]","Being a native Texan, I am actually a Cowboy fan. However, I am married to a die-hard Packers fan and have thus come to appreciate the team's history and tradition over the years.The disc on the history of the team was interesting, especially the very early years from the team's founding in 1919 until the arrival of Vince Lombardi in the late 1950's. Given today's corporate mentality it is interesting to note that the Packers were founded and coached by the same man - Curly Lambeau, who also played the position of halfback for the Packers during the team's early years. The history did brush over the years from the late 1960's to the early 1990's, but then these were such disheartening years for the Packers that this is understandable. The history gets more in detail again with the arrival of Holmgren and Favre in Green Bay, and continues through to the Mike Sherman years and the building of the new stadium.Of course, the real reason to own this set is for the reconstructed version of the Ice Bowl. Fortunately, although I am old enough to barely remember the Ice Bowl, I am not old enough to be as bitter about it as my parents are, so I could watch the segment on the Ice Bowl and appreciate it for the history and for the titan struggle between two great teams that it was. Overall, there are about 40 or so minutes of the 60 minute game shown, and NFL Films has done a good job of piecing the game together so that it doesn't appear to be a patched and spliced up job. It has a real feeling of continuity about it and the video quality is quite good for such old footage. The film conveys the mood of the players and what it was like to play on a field in such conditions through interviews with the players, officials, and some of the broadcasters that were there. Apparently, each time a player fell it was like landing on jagged concrete. Whistles had to be abandoned by the officials due to the cold, and the planned halftime show was also impossible. Also, the film finally confirmed an ""urban legend"" that I had heard about for years. There really was someone on the sidelines that poured themselves a cup of coffee, turned around to do something else, and when they went back to their coffee it had frozen solid with the spoon in it, forming a coffee-sickle. There is also footage of the post-game show featuring interviews with various Green Bay players including Bart Starr, and also footage of the post-game interview with the legendary Lombardi.What really impressed me watching this film is how obvious it is that the level of remuneration in the league has escalated since the Ice Bowl was played forty years ago. This really shows in how the Packers choose to celebrate after the game. The segment on the Ice Bowl closes with Lombardi celebrating with family and friends in his wood-paneled rec room - it was nothing fancier than you would find in any middle class three-bedroom two-bath home. It was truly the end of an era ""when pride still mattered"". I'd highly recommend this set for any Packer fan.",5,History of one of the NFL's founding teams & their most interesting game,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,3035,"['Being', 'native', 'Texan', 'am', 'actually', 'Cowboy', 'fan', 'However', 'am', 'married', 'die-hard', 'Packers', 'fan', 'have', 'thus', 'come', 'appreciate', 'team', 'history', 'tradition', 'years.The', 'disc', 'history', 'team', 'was', 'interesting', 'especially', 'very', 'early', 'years', 'team', 'founding', '1919', 'arrival', 'Vince', 'Lombardi', 'late', '1950', 'Given', 'today', 'corporate', 'mentality', 'interesting', 'note', 'Packers', 'were', 'founded', 'coached', 'same', 'man', 'Curly', 'Lambeau', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'position', 'halfback', 'Packers', 'team', 'early', 'years', 'history', 'did', 'brush', 'years', 'late', '1960', 'early', '1990', 'then', 'were', 'such', 'disheartening', 'years', 'Packers', 'understandable', 'history', 'more', 'detail', 'again', 'arrival', 'Holmgren', 'Favre', 'Green', 'Bay', 'Mike', 'Sherman', 'years', 'building', 'new', 'stadium.Of', 'course', 'real', 'reason', 'own', 'set', 'reconstructed', 'version', 'Ice', 'Bowl', 'Fortunately', 'am', 'old', 'enough', 'barely', 'remember', 'Ice', 'Bowl', 'am', 'not', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'bitter', 'parents', 'are', 'could', 'watch', 'segment', 'Ice', 'Bowl', 'appreciate', 'history', 'titan', 'struggle', 'two', 'great', 'teams', 'was', 'Overall', 'are', '40', 'so', 'minutes', '60', 'minute', 'game', 'shown', 'NFL', 'Films', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'piecing', 'game', 'together', 'so', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'patched', 'spliced', 'up', 'job', 'real', 'feeling', 'continuity', 'video', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'such', 'old', 'footage', 'film', 'conveys', 'mood', 'players', 'what', 'was', 'play', 'field', 'such', 'conditions', 'interviews', 'players', 'officials', 'broadcasters', 'were', 'there', 'Apparently', 'time', 'player', 'fell', 'was', 'landing', 'jagged', 'concrete', 'Whistles', 'had', 'be', 'abandoned', 'officials', 'due', 'cold', 'planned', 'halftime', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'impossible', 'Also', 'film', 'finally', 'confirmed', 'urban', 'legend', 'had', 'heard', 'years', 'really', 'was', 'someone', 'sidelines', 'poured', 'cup', 'coffee', 'turned', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'when', 'went', 'back', 'coffee', 'had', 'frozen', 'solid', 'spoon', 'forming', 'coffee-sickle', 'also', 'footage', 'post-game', 'show', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'various', 'Green', 'Bay', 'players', 'including', 'Bart', 'Starr', 'also', 'footage', 'post-game', 'interview', 'legendary', 'Lombardi.What', 'really', 'impressed', 'watching', 'film', 'how', 'obvious', 'level', 'remuneration', 'league', 'escalated', 'Ice', 'Bowl', 'was', 'played', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'how', 'Packers', 'choose', 'celebrate', 'game', 'segment', 'Ice', 'Bowl', 'Lombardi', 'celebrating', 'family', 'friends', 'wood-paneled', 'rec', 'room', 'was', 'nothing', 'fancier', 'would', 'find', 'middle', 'class', 'three-bedroom', 'two-bath', 'home', 'was', 'truly', 'end', 'era', 'when', 'pride', 'still', 'mattered', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'Packer', 'fan']",The NFL's Greatest Games: The Ice Bowl VHS
