502105,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B00000I4PD,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[4, 9]","Like others, I was intrigued by ""Superstition"" given the high reviews and the time period from which it originated.  However, ""Superstition"" is not a good horror movie at all.  ""Superstition"" is based on a decent idea though.  Basically, this movie is about a supposedly haunted house that is being haunted by a witch executed back in 1692 a la Salem Witch trials, although she was not burned to death.  Perhaps they should have done it right the first time around.Anyway, in ""Superstition"", a group of people move into this house and on the land where the witch was supposedly executed.  The land is owned by the church, but when bizarre things start to happen and people start getting killed, people began to wonder about the curse of the witch.  Quite frankly, ""Superstition"" does not do much to capture the attention of the viewer, and the lack of theatrical structure which is so clearly evident causes the movie to struggle to hold itself together.  In effect, ""Superstition"" never really gets off the ground with what it wants to do.  What inevitably results is a bunch of seemingly random scenes thrown together that do not mesh very well at all.  Clearly, the productions values are bad, and the movie exhibits all of the negative traits of a very low budget.  While some low-budget movies are good, this one is not.  In defense of ""Superstition"", it does attempt to create some atmosphere with some decent theme and mood music and sound effects, but it does not take hold due to the movie's lack of style and substance.  The viewer will notice that some of the theme music is based on ""Dream of A Witch's Sabbath"" by Berlioz, but it's certainly not enough to make this into an effectively scary movie.The death scenes in ""Superstition"" are not that impressive, but are not so bad that it kills the movie.  The acting is not good, but it's not so terrible to the extent that the movie would be unwatchable.  However, what does kill ""Superstition"" are the script, direction, cinematography and plot execution which are all horrible.  The movie does not flow well at all, and this results in a bad movie-watching experience.  ""Superstition"" completely fails as there is little to any identifiable theatrical structure.I would say that ""Superstition"" is a clear example of a movie with a decent concept, but plagued by poor execution and little to zero plot development.  Clearly, the creators of the movie did not know what to do with this movie and it shows in the lack of plot development and deplorable script.  Consequently, ""Superstition"" ultimately comes off like a joke and total disaster.  0.5 STARS for the idea and some of the death scenes which could have been worse I guess...I know that's not much of a compliment, but that's all I can muster for this movie.",1,0.5 STARS: Dream of a Witch's Sabbath?

502106,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00000I4PD,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","Neither gem nor skipper, this is a typical 80s slasher movie.  The kills are pretty random, the story is comically uninspired, and the actual murderous acts and the killer are never seen.TAGLINE:  ""A witch put to death in 1692 swears vengeance on her persecutors and returns to the present day to punish their descendants."" [--IMDB]This flick wastes none of your time.  Before we're 20 minutes into the running time a couple of pranksters intruding in the wrong abandoned house meet horror-humorous fates: a decapitated head exploding in a microwave and a killer window cuts a guy in half.Reverend David Thompson is approached by the police about this property, which has a bloody history.  We learn from the weird caretaker lady that the killer is a ""she.""  But some crazy lady's words aren't sufficient evidence to keep the reverend from renting the house out to the family of a colleague of the cloth.The kills are pretty random, almost comically uninspired, and the actual murderous act and the killer are never seen (just a black clawed hand), making this flick feels like most 80s slasher movies.  Additional kills include a drowning, a rogue buzz saw blade to the chest, a hanging, crushing by giant vice, glass shrapnel to the face, hammering a stake through a forehead (my favorite in the movie!), and other random draggings by claw off camera.The weird old caretaker lady is standoffish and uninformative as to what's going on until Rev. David removes a crucifix from the pond out back.  Evidently, removing the crucifix from the pond somehow empowers the killer and now he must perform some ritual.  Why?  Well, evidently the killer was a witch that was ""drowned at the stake"" (not a joke) back in 1692.  It seems that she's exacting her revenge on the descendants of her executioners and she waited about 300 years to do it.  I guess it's a good thing for that evil witch spirit that they didn't just decide to move to Florida.  Otherwise, she might have been waiting in that pond forever!More people die, the story never really goes anywhere, and the last scene was the most painful of the entire movie.  Despite this being advertised as something of a witch movie, it would be best to ignore that altogether and simply consider this another bad slasher flick with a supernatural component.  There is really no reason this should be called ""Superstition"" either.This flick should neither be skipped nor treated as a hidden gem.

502113,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B00000I4PD,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","After a very lackluster yet enjoyable viewing of Shrieker, we felt compelled to further the daily B entry by adding one on later that night. With so many options available we came across an 80's wildcard known as Superstition. This is one we'd never heard of and seemed a bit different then the typical 80's slashers. Therefore we said ""alright, alright...be careful"" and gave it a whirl. The result was an actual really good horror movie that maintained a very creepy feel throughout. Despite it actually being good, there was an overwhelming B element with plenty of hilarious moments. This way you're getting the best of both worlds. It's essentially the perfect style of B that truly intrigues you yet makes you crack up at certain times. There's also something special knowing it was originally released on VHS. It brings you back to a time where perusing the video store shelves was the only way for one to obtain B. A time when Death Ring could have been requested by the store clerk for the honest sum of $90. It still would have been worth it for that price. Anyway, on to the feature film of the evening!Superstition starts off hot and heavy with a high school couple having a make-out session by a creepy old house. A couple of tricksters play some pranks and scare them off from the old abandoned house. Unfortunately for them an entity takes them both out. One gets his head lopped off and blown up in a microwave while the other gets chopped in half trying to escape out of a window. Yeah it was pretty intense. Now we flash forward to a family who has recently moved into the condemned property, not knowing the houses assorted past. Turns out the backyard pond was the site of a witch execution back in 1692. One where the witch vowed revenge on anybody and everybody in the nearby area. So it's safe to assume moving into her old house wasn't the best choice. This witch entity is no joke and gruesomely takes out anybody she can. Their only hope is their priest friend who takes on the force with his crucifix only to come up empty in the end. Despite the lack of success with the witch, the crucifix did manage to make a door explode which was incredibly awesome and hilarious. Maybe if it had been a crucifix pinky ring the priest would have been more successful. We know first hand the power that ring holds. It holds the force of 10 plates of galamad, with a side of madana finished with a demitasse. Now that's a force to be reckoned with.When it was all said and done, Superstition was an 80's gem that takes on a different approach to the typical slasher of the decade. It legitimately had some creepy moments that were unfortunately overshadowed by a music score that didn't fit the movie. The music was nowhere near scary and managed to make certain scenes more comical. It was a very odd choice. The time someone pranked the big guy by playing Yani through the phone would have been more effective. One caveat was that you never get to see the witch entity except for a big creepy shadow hand, or a figure in a large robe. We would have enjoyed a real creepy looking witch face in the mix, but it's not a deal breaker. This is one that would have been perfect for Monstervision back in the 90's on a Saturday Night.
