1077778,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000QUU7KC,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[116, 119]","The Ultimate Gift' is a fun and surprising inspirational gem.  Not knowing quite what to expect, the movie quickly develops an emotional and entertaining core.  Often funny, sad, mysterious, and uplifting in different measures, the film pulls out a unique bag of tricks.  Sort of like the `Willy Wonka' of spiritual cinema, `The Ultimate Gift' is more than a ""Hallmark"" Christian experience.It all begins after the death of oil tycoon, Red Stevens (James Garner) who has left videotapes for his family.  Gathered around the conference table in his lucrative company headquarters, all members wait on pins and needles to see what they will inherit from him.  Crassly, the greedy family can't help but commiserate over the lack of possessions he's bequeathed to them.  As his custom, Jason (Drew Fuller), his black sheep grandson, comes late to the proceedings, fully expecting nothing, but wanting to make sure nonetheless.  What he gets is a treasure hunt.  If he performs a series of feats for the edification of his board of trustees, he will win ""the ultimate gift"".  Heading that board is fellow associate Mr. Hamilton (Bill Cobbs), who anchors the whole deal as a living negotiator.  If Jason flubs on any one of the ""assignments,"" he loses the gift.A lot of the proceedings depend a great deal on Red predicting what Jason will do next during the videotape.  It works admirably and there's enough good humor to smooth out the edges of our disbelief.  Events are often unpredictable, and the acting ranges from genuine to genuinely good.  Particularly noteworthy is Abigail Breslan (Oscar nominated child prodigy from 'Little Miss Sunshine') who gives another fine performance as Emily, a sick girl with a sharp tongue, but a good heart.  Reflecting on God and heaven, she sagely says, ""He paints every color of a butterfly with His fingers.""The movie also brings the welcome return of Brian Dennehy as Gus, his relative from Texas.  Some of the funniest parts are taken from his Southern mansion.  One scene where he is rudely awakened by an electric cattle prod left me in stitches.  Sometimes the relatives become caricatures, but that's few and far between.  At one holiday dinner, an argument ensues and one woman tartly states ""Money's just as green from Manhattan.""  The pace is wonderfully edited with the last portion slightly too languorous in places--even if the film needs to stop and reflect awhile.  With these minor objections out of the way, the movie is wonderfully nourishing for the heart and soul.Some controversy remains for the spiritual nature of the film.  Glancing over some reviews, I found some critics becoming defensive for any favorable take on the movie.  Christianity is sprinkled throughout.  During work ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" plays from Dylan's Christian era, and a romantic dinner scene ""Lord of the Dance"" is cleverly piped in with acoustical guitars at a fancy restaurant.  At the hospital, Emily frequents the chapel where Jason tells her the Sacred Heart statue shows Jesus' open arms to embrace her.  Critics apologetically (or defensively) say that Jesus is only mentioned once in the whole movie.  I don't personally think anyone should have to defend a movie for being overtly Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or whatever.  ""Pain is your teacher,"" says Red to Jason on the videotape before going to the great beyond.  This could be said in an Asian movie.  'The Ultimate Gift' is overtly Christian, but inclusive.  Another objection may come with the points of wisdom provided at the end.  While I enjoyed the elaboration, some may find the lesson condescending--an unnecessary Sunday school highlighter pen review.With all my lowered expectations, 'The Ultimate Gift' is a surprise.  The comedic timing is great, the mystery is fun, and the emotional trek is worthwhile.

Lots of tissues.The Ultimate Gift is well scripted, well directed, and well cast. Its premise and resolution are quite predictable; nevertheless, it's quite enjoyable to watch the characters develop and overcome obstacles.Unlike Little Miss Sunshine&lt;, which was an ensemble film, all the strengths in this movie are solely due to Breslin's impressive performance. Little Miss Sunshine would've suffered terrible had Olive been played by anyone else, whereas The Ultimate Gift wouldn't even be a movie if Abigail Breslin did not play Emily. If you were amused by Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine, if you found her even remotely funny, you will find her absolutely lovely and endearing in The Ultimate Gift.If Abigail can maintain this level of intensity in her performances I see Oscars lined up at her feet. She is undoubtedly on her path to becoming the next Jodie Foster.Don't let the fact that this is advertised as ""a Christian film"" discourage you from seeing it. It hardly mentions Christianity. It is more about humanity and becoming the person we all wish to be than about religion.During the movie, laughs and sniffles could be overhead over the crunching of the popcorn. I even found myself clapping half way through the movie. In fact, the moviegoers were so captivated by the film that most remained in their seats all throughout the entire credit sequence at the end. How often does that happen? Usually people are too eager to storm out of the theater and go back to their lives. Not this time. People wanted to treasure every little bit of this movie.My mom bawled during the movie and she isn't opt to do that. I had to clean my glasses on more than one occasion too.

Our lives mean nothing and will count as very little until we learn to give ourselves in service and develop a mindset that places value and equality on every human being we encounter.If we could each learn the secret of this gift there'd be nothing to report on the evening news but what good we had all done for each other.

First off, let me assure you, it isn't a 'Christmas'-themed movie, so don't avoid it if you fear it will be laced with Holiday Carols and St. Nick...but it DOES have a spiritual message, reminiscent of Lloyd Douglas'Magnificent Obsessionand the recentPay It Forward, that if we can look past ourselves, and willingly risk everything for others, our lives, and those we touch, will be infinitely richer...and a powerhouse cast, headed by James Garner, Drew Fuller, and Abigail Breslin, 'deliver the goods' flawlessly!Garner, seen only in 'video', is a deceased multimillionaire whose greedy offspring gather like vultures to take everything. Grandson Fuller is little better than the rest, but he legitimately has a reason for the chip on his shoulder; when he was a child, his father died working at a Garner third-world humanitarian project, and Fuller lost all interest in life, living a wastral existence, fired with hatred at the grandfather.Garner leaves a mysterious video message for Fuller, that his inheritance will be given when he successfully completes a few tasks, supervised by family lawyer Hamilton (Bill Cobbs) and his secretary, Miss Hastings (Lee Meriweather). Grudgingly, Fuller agrees, and the actual adventure begins, as the young man learns life lessons on hard work and dedication (from Garner's lifelong friend, a rancher played by the terrific Brian Dennehy), and the value of true friends, from a dying girl (Breslin), and her courageous mother (Ali Hillis). Fuller learns, the hard way, that you can't 'fake' friendship, and about the love and hope both his father and grandfather offered the people in war-torn Equador, where his father died. Nearly losing his own life, he discovers the true values he'd so long ignored.While the finale, the final chapter of the film, may seem a bit too fantastic, it ties up the storyline beautifully (reminding me a bit of the early Garner film,Cash McCall), and is so fabulous, you may, like me, just say ""Wow!""An AMAZING film, one you simply shouldn't miss!",5,"One of the BEST films I've viewed, ever, and a MUST to own!",1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,2305,"['was', 'fortunate', 'discoverThe', 'Ultimate', 'Gifton', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'past', 'holiday', 'season', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'surprising', 'moving', 'entertaining', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'available', 'own', 'DVD', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'First', 'let', 'assure', ""n't"", ""'Christmas'-themed"", 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'fear', 'will', 'be', 'laced', 'Holiday', 'Carols', 'St.', 'Nick', 'DOES', 'have', 'spiritual', 'message', 'reminiscent', 'Lloyd', ""Douglas'Magnificent"", 'Obsessionand', 'recentPay', 'Forward', 'can', 'look', 'past', 'ourselves', 'willingly', 'risk', 'everything', 'others', 'lives', 'touch', 'will', 'be', 'infinitely', 'richer', 'powerhouse', 'cast', 'headed', 'James', 'Garner', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'goods', 'flawlessly', 'Garner', 'seen', 'only', ""'video"", 'deceased', 'multimillionaire', 'greedy', 'offspring', 'gather', 'vultures', 'take', 'everything', 'Grandson', 'Fuller', 'little', 'better', 'rest', 'legitimately', 'reason', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'father', 'died', 'working', 'Garner', 'third-world', 'humanitarian', 'project', 'Fuller', 'lost', 'interest', 'life', 'living', 'wastral', 'existence', 'fired', 'hatred', 'grandfather.Garner', 'mysterious', 'video', 'message', 'Fuller', 'inheritance', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'when', 'successfully', 'few', 'tasks', 'supervised', 'family', 'lawyer', 'Hamilton', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'secretary', 'Miss', 'Hastings', 'Lee', 'Meriweather', 'Grudgingly', 'Fuller', 'actual', 'adventure', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'lessons', 'hard', 'work', 'dedication', 'Garner', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'rancher', 'played', 'terrific', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'value', 'true', 'friends', 'dying', 'girl', 'Breslin', 'courageous', 'mother', 'Ali', 'Hillis', 'Fuller', 'hard', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", ""'fake"", 'friendship', 'love', 'hope', 'father', 'grandfather', 'offered', 'people', 'war-torn', 'Equador', 'where', 'father', 'died', 'Nearly', 'losing', 'own', 'life', 'true', 'values', ""'d"", 'so', 'long', 'finale', 'final', 'chapter', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'too', 'fantastic', 'up', 'storyline', 'beautifully', 'reminding', 'bit', 'early', 'Garner', 'film', 'Cash', 'McCall', 'so', 'fabulous', 'may', 'just', 'say', 'Wow', 'AMAZING', 'film', 'one', 'simply', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A

1077806,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000QUU7KC,Bill Garrison,"[0, 0]","The Ultimate Gift is a charming movie released by Fox Faith that utilizes a great cast to present sweet story. Red Stevens is ridiculously wealthy and has just died. It seems no one in his family cares for anything except how big their inheritence will be. Grandson Jason (Drew Fuller) certainly doesn't expect anything from the grandfather he blames for his father's desk. Red's lawyers, played wonderfully by Bill Cobbs and Lee Merriwether, call Jason in. Red (James Garner) has a video message for Jason. If Jason follows Red's instructions, he will receive several little gifts that will lead to the ""Ultimate Gift""Jason is a slacker and at first is against playing these silly games. He goes along reluctantly and soon learns the value of ""work"" and ""money"" through hard life lessions. Along the way, he meets Alexia, the single mom of Emily (played by Abigal Breslin).Since I wanted to enjoy this movie, I was able to overlook some of its flaws, like how a relationship between Alexia and Jason developed out of the blue. Or how, while homeless, Jason always seemed clean shaven. Or how the lessons that Jason should have learned from each gift seemed implied. In fact, the story does seem choppy at times, with the story coming in segments that don't quite flow together.In spite of its flaws, I enjoyed the movie. It is based on the book of the same name by Jim Stovall. This is a movie with a message, be prepared. However, the message isn't religious or ""Christian"", nor does it pound you over the head. This movie is like a Hallmark version of Brewster's Million, where Jason Stephens must change his behavior in order to inherit a large sum of money. This is a great family film, perhaps a bit slow for the kids. It got plenty of bad reviews from the secular media. Some criticized the filmmaking and acting, but just as many criticized the corniness of the message. And that shows why the intolerant mainstream media just doesn't get it. This was a good film.

At his grandfather Red's funeral he makes a showy (and late) entrance, perhaps punctuating his low opinion of the man. But from his grave Red (James Garner) has words for his money hungry relatives at the reading of his will. No one gets what they expect, including Jason.In a closed conference room with only his grandfather's trusted attorney (Bill Cobbs) and secretary (Lee Meriwether) in attendance, Jason is advised by Red via a video recording that he's being given a series of gifts. The catch? He isn't told what the gifts are, only that he's to arrive at the airport and await further instructions. Is this his grandfather's form of a joke, or is Red Stevens trying to reach out and teach him things he never learned from his materialistic family?Based on a novella by noted motivational speaker and author Jim Stovall, the filmmakers endeavored to preserve the heart of his story while still producing a relevant movie. Says screenwriter Cheryl McKay in an interview conducted by Rene Gutteridge who wrote the novelization of the screenplay, ""The biggest challenge was figuring out how to handle all the gifts and not come off with a movie that felt episodic. We had to blend a couple of them together and de-emphasize a couple of them because twelve is a lot to cover in a two-hour movie.""Winner of the Heartland Film Festival's Crystal Heart Award, The Ultimate Gift features an Oscar worthy cast. Drew Fuller (best known for his recurring role as Chris Halliwell in Charmed) pulls off Jason's cockiness and spoiled brat ways, but also believably portrays his transformed self. His facial expressions alone made me laugh out loud a few times. Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine, Signs) could easily have over played her character Emily, but she doesn't, and she wins our hearts in the process. Ali Hillis (Must Love Dogs) is another notable cast member as Jason's love interest and Emily's mother. No one hits it out of the ball park, but you can still win a game without home runs, and The Ultimate Gift is a winner.The Ultimate Gift is a predictable film you somehow want to be predictable. Its PG rating allows for a few mild swear words and tense thematic moments, but this is really a movie the whole family can enjoy.From the vast acres of a Texas ranch to the wilds of a South American jungle, Jason's assumptions about his grandfather, and himself, will never be the same. And even though you'll most likely guess the film's ending, it's the journey that matters. We're taken on an exciting one with Jason as he discovers not only the ultimate gift, but what type of a man he's truly capable of being.--Reviewed by C.J.

Long,"[0, 0]","I had no real pre-conceived notions before watching this and haven't read the book.This movie clearly has as a chief goal to cause people to think about what they are doing with their life.  And at that I would say it succeeds.The story itself was entertaining and interesting, but way under-developed.  It needed at least another 30 minutes to flesh out some of the relationships.  Out of the blue the main character Jason (who is initially a spoiled brat) becomes friends with this little girl and her mom and yet there is very little screen time to showing this emotional connection developing.  It seems like out of the blue, he is hugging and kissing the little girl and her mom - like they've known each other for a long time when really they just met.  It just seemed awkward to me - something I wasn't prepared for emotionally because the movie didn't prep me for it.  I kept feeling like this movie was playing with my emotions on a level at which I wasn't prepared for.  It felt like the movie was missing 30 minutes to an hour of film that was needed to fill in more of the back-story of the development of Jason and his transformation that was occurring.  A little more time with the guy on the ranch, a little more time fleshing out what happened in Ecuador, etc. would have been good - everything just seemed to jump way too quickly.  More time to really show the transformation and make a really cohesive story probably would have been appropriate.Then there's the little girl that's constantly portrayed like a super-mature adult and thinking only of others, etc.  Nice sentiment, but pretty unrealistic.  Her character was a bit too ""over the top"" in my opinion - she needed to be a little more like a little girl and a little less like a 70-year-old woman that has a mature outlook on life given all the wisdom attained in her life.Although some I guess are criticizing this film as an ""overtly Christian film"" - I think it is a VERY big stretch to call this film ""overtly Christian"" and probably even a stretch to reference it as ""Christian""!  Yeah, it mentions Jesus by name in a passing reference.  Yes, there are a few references to church.  Yes, there's a few songs playing that have Christian connotations.  And that's about it, folks.  There's very little preaching here.  The message of the movie pretty much boils down to ""live life to its fullness and care about others"", NOT ""accept Jesus Christ as your Savior"".  Personally as a Christian, I would have liked to have seen much greater emphasis on some of the spiritual dynamics.  This film doesn't really go there, so I don't understand criticisms along this line at all.All in all, this was a somewhat contrived, underdeveloped yet emotionally manipulative film, but it was very entertaining and succeeds in its core goal on getting a person to really think a bit about what they are doing with the gift of life they've been given.Chris LongLaugh & Lift ministries",4,Thought Provoking but Under Developed,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,2945,"['had', 'real', 'pre-conceived', 'notions', 'watching', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book.This', 'movie', 'clearly', 'chief', 'goal', 'cause', 'people', 'think', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'life', 'would', 'say', 'succeeds.The', 'story', 'was', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'way', 'under-developed', 'needed', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'flesh', 'out', 'relationships', 'blue', 'main', 'character', 'Jason', 'who', 'initially', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'little', 'girl', 'mom', 'yet', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'showing', 'emotional', 'connection', 'developing', 'blue', 'hugging', 'kissing', 'little', 'girl', 'mom', ""'ve"", 'known', 'other', 'long', 'time', 'when', 'really', 'just', 'met', 'just', 'seemed', 'awkward', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'emotionally', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'prep', 'kept', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'emotions', 'level', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'missing', '30', 'minutes', 'hour', 'film', 'was', 'needed', 'fill', 'more', 'back-story', 'development', 'Jason', 'transformation', 'was', 'occurring', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'guy', 'ranch', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'fleshing', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Ecuador', 'etc', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'everything', 'just', 'seemed', 'jump', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'More', 'time', 'really', 'show', 'transformation', 'make', 'really', 'cohesive', 'story', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'girl', 'constantly', 'portrayed', 'super-mature', 'adult', 'thinking', 'only', 'others', 'etc', 'Nice', 'sentiment', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'character', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'top', 'opinion', 'needed', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'little', 'girl', 'little', 'less', '70-year-old', 'woman', 'mature', 'outlook', 'life', 'given', 'wisdom', 'attained', 'life.Although', 'guess', 'are', 'criticizing', 'film', 'overtly', 'Christian', 'film', 'think', 'VERY', 'big', 'stretch', 'call', 'film', 'overtly', 'Christian', 'probably', 'even', 'stretch', 'reference', 'Christian', 'Yeah', 'Jesus', 'name', 'passing', 'reference', 'Yes', 'are', 'few', 'references', 'church', 'Yes', 'few', 'songs', 'playing', 'have', 'Christian', 'connotations', 'folks', 'very', 'little', 'preaching', 'here', 'message', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'boils', 'down', 'live', 'life', 'fullness', 'care', 'others', 'NOT', 'accept', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Savior', 'Personally', 'Christian', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'spiritual', 'dynamics', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'criticisms', 'line', 'all.All', 'was', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'underdeveloped', 'yet', 'emotionally', 'manipulative', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'core', 'goal', 'getting', 'person', 'really', 'think', 'bit', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'gift', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given.Chris', 'LongLaugh', 'Lift', 'ministries']",N/A

1077841,A2SO7CB2WP3BHD,B000QUU7KC,dazie,"[5, 6]","After searching through some of the best rated/seller DVD Movies, I stumbled across this one.  I decided to rent it first, since I had not heard of it before at all.  What a great movie.  I tell you it's just so nice to watch a film that you can even watch with the whole family. A movie where you can find things that you can personally draw from and think to yourself, ""Hey I can work on that with myself.. "", or ""Yes, I should be doing that.""This story involves a rich self absorbed young guy, who has pretty much never had to work and always had everything he wanted. His friends basically only liked him because of his money and he never really had any true friendships or goals or dreams.  After the death of his grandfather and the process of the execution of his will, the character, Jason, has different tasks he must complete before he can receive the ""gift"" at the end, which he doesn't know what it is until they they have not just been ""done"" in a real sense, but also done to the point where Jason has really turned his life around and realized the true sense of so many things.Abigails character and her mom come into his life and really help Jason to start thinking about others for the first time in his life.  I loved Abigails previous acting roles so to find her in this movie was a clincher that I had to see it.  The actors in the movie have been around for a while, but not enough to the point where they are typecast at all and the mixture was just like having a fresh new set of actors in a story.All blended together, this is a perfectly delightful film that you will absolutely treasure.  The title is The Ultimate Gift, and it really is a gift of a film.  You'll be nicely surprised you can watch this film with the whole family as there is,  from what I can remember virtually no profanity in the entire film, and its modest too, so you wont have to worry about any ""bedroom"" scenes either.  Just a nice, film, that you'll want to watch again the next day.Definitely Five stars on this one, you won't be disappointed.",5,"Wow !

The grandfather got rich ripping people off in the cattle and oil industries.Anamoly 2: The family members are evil because they want the money, rather than being benevolent. So money is bad unless it has to do with medical care!Anamoly 3: With his first 100 million the boy builds a cancer wing at the hospital. Everyone is programmed like sheep to accept the 'high cost of medical care'. No one stands up and says the medical industry is charging too much and ripping off the population! Hospital greed and graft and outrageous costs to the hundredth power, doctor exhorbitant salaries, outrageous rip-off costs of hardware; because the medical industry pays off lobbies to keep congress strangling the population as the medical industry stabs us to death!Anamaly 4: 90% of the wealth in the United States is hoarded by 10% of the population, who guard their wealth as misers,giving little away unless they can write it off. One is reminded of one software manufacturer who pushes his crappy software on schools (so no other software can get a foothold) and pushes anti-AIDs drugs (from his own pharmacies) on Africa, the exhorbitant costs of which is paid for by the US taxpayer and his write-offs.

1077877,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000QUU7KC,Grady Harp,"[7, 7]","Jim 'You Don't Have to be Blind to See' Stovall  is an inspirational writer who in 2001 published a little book by the name of THE ULTIMATE GIFT in which he transposed many of his motivational teachings into a novel form, a story of how a tape of a dying man can alter the life of a crassly money-centric young grandson leading him through trials and challenges to teach him the meaning of life.  Now THE ULTIMATE GIFT comes to the screen/DVD and before making the groaning judgment that here is yet another insipid little tale about learning life's lessons and gaining some spirituality in the process, try watching this two hour traversal of well acted and well scripted (Cheryl McKay) and well directed (Michael O. Sajbel) input.  There is a lot more to the film than the grinches might think!A wealthy man Red Stevens (James Garner) has amassed a fortune, turning his personal life into a shambles in the process and producing a family of greedy ruthless gluttons - with one exception: one son rebelled and lost his life to dreams despite the aspirations of the father. Red has just died and the will is read by Red's longtime partner and lawyer Ted (Bill Cobbs) and his devoted assistant Miss Hastings (Lee Meriwether): the family is outraged at the results of Red's division of his fortune and the one person who is left to learn of the will's content is Red's egocentric grandson Jason (Drew Fuller).  Through a taped interview just prior to his death Red outlines the twelve lessons Jason must learn if he is to inherit anything. And here begins the episodic journey during which Jason learns about poverty, compassion, friends, death, and spirituality that changes Jason into a full human being and creates a character who gives back more than he gets.Along the way Jason encounters work-ethic Gus (Brian Dennehy), a little girl Emily dying from leukemia (Abigail Breslin)  whose sharp wit and tongue manifest wisdom that leads to the bonding of Jason and Emily's mother  Alexia (Ali Hillis), and  host of other character actors in the various parts of the world where Jason's journey takes him. Yes, the plot is predictable, and yes, the tenor of the piece borders on soap opera at times, but the end result is an examination of life that is told with enough fine humor and realistic dialog that it works.  If viewers pass by this DVD because they fear it is just another sappy lecture, they will miss the pleasure of entering the realm of tender communication delivered with style and sincerity.  And we all need that, especially now...Grady Harp, August 07",4,Don't Pass This Little Film By,1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,2568,"['Jim', ""'You"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'Have', 'be', 'Blind', 'See', 'Stovall', 'inspirational', 'writer', 'who', '2001', 'published', 'little', 'book', 'name', 'THE', 'ULTIMATE', 'GIFT', 'transposed', 'many', 'motivational', 'teachings', 'novel', 'form', 'story', 'how', 'tape', 'dying', 'man', 'can', 'alter', 'life', 'crassly', 'money-centric', 'young', 'grandson', 'leading', 'trials', 'challenges', 'teach', 'meaning', 'life', 'Now', 'THE', 'ULTIMATE', 'GIFT', 'screen/DVD', 'making', 'groaning', 'judgment', 'here', 'yet', 'insipid', 'little', 'tale', 'learning', 'life', 'lessons', 'gaining', 'spirituality', 'process', 'try', 'watching', 'two', 'hour', 'traversal', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'scripted', 'Cheryl', 'McKay', 'well', 'directed', 'Michael', 'O.', 'Sajbel', 'input', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'grinches', 'might', 'think', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Red', 'Stevens', 'James', 'Garner', 'amassed', 'fortune', 'turning', 'personal', 'life', 'shambles', 'process', 'producing', 'family', 'greedy', 'ruthless', 'gluttons', 'one', 'exception', 'one', 'son', 'rebelled', 'lost', 'life', 'dreams', 'aspirations', 'father', 'Red', 'just', 'died', 'will', 'read', 'Red', 'longtime', 'partner', 'lawyer', 'Ted', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'devoted', 'assistant', 'Miss', 'Hastings', 'Lee', 'Meriwether', 'family', 'outraged', 'results', 'Red', 'division', 'fortune', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'left', 'learn', 'will', 'content', 'Red', 'egocentric', 'grandson', 'Jason', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'taped', 'interview', 'just', 'prior', 'death', 'Red', 'twelve', 'lessons', 'Jason', 'must', 'learn', 'inherit', 'anything', 'here', 'episodic', 'journey', 'Jason', 'poverty', 'compassion', 'friends', 'death', 'spirituality', 'Jason', 'full', 'human', 'being', 'character', 'who', 'back', 'more', 'gets.Along', 'way', 'Jason', 'work-ethic', 'Gus', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'little', 'girl', 'Emily', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'sharp', 'wit', 'tongue', 'manifest', 'wisdom', 'bonding', 'Jason', 'Emily', 'mother', 'Alexia', 'Ali', 'Hillis', 'host', 'other', 'character', 'actors', 'various', 'parts', 'world', 'where', 'Jason', 'journey', 'Yes', 'plot', 'predictable', 'yes', 'tenor', 'piece', 'borders', 'soap', 'opera', 'times', 'end', 'result', 'examination', 'life', 'told', 'enough', 'fine', 'humor', 'realistic', 'dialog', 'viewers', 'pass', 'DVD', 'fear', 'just', 'sappy', 'lecture', 'will', 'miss', 'pleasure', 'entering', 'realm', 'tender', 'communication', 'delivered', 'style', 'sincerity', 'need', 'especially', 'now', 'Grady', 'Harp', 'August', '07']",N/A

That part I couldn't figure out, couldn't he just call the police?  In the US even your creditors can't simply siphon every penny out of your bank account, but then again maybe the government can and this is the film's way of showing that Texas oilman Red Stevens (the Garner role) is actually a top government official.  Garner plays him as though he was playing George Bush Sr, and even the makeup people seem in on the act, carefully blotching Garner's skin and rearranging his hairline to give him a striking resemblance to the former President.The older man, Red, has never been forgiven by young Jason for reasons that remain shadowy through most of the story, emerging only when Jason goes to Ecuador and enjoys a multicultural romance with an attractive, if somewhat older, Ecuadorian librarian and human rights worker.  It seems that Jason's dad died under mysterious circumstances and all along Jason has been convinced that Red had something to do with it.  Why Red never told Jason the truth when he was alive I don't know.Another muted romance is between Mr. Henderson, the ancient lawyer living on due to having received Red's kidney, and Lee Meriweather, the former Miss America and Catwoman on Batman, who makes a triumphant return to the big screen as Miss Hastings, his assistant or secretary or whatever she is.  The two of them are obviously in love, but maybe the interracial aspect of their romance was causing the producers some concern, so they share only some glowing, eerily lit closeups, and their heads are always photographed togetherthisclose like two petals on a daisy.I wept buckets throughout the movie and anyone whose heart isn't made out of stone will do the same.  I dock the movie several notches because of its abysmal photography, like a cheesy featurette on a Balkan TV channel of the 60s; the limp Rob Lowe wannabe Drew Fuller playing the lead in a dreadful performance based totally on his hair; and also of course, the message about worship which is tacked on to what was otherwise a movie all about wealth, poverty, family and disease.",3,Grand Return to the Cinema for One of Hollywood's Most Often Overlooked Leading Ladies,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,2398,"['Christmas', 'gave', 'ultimate', 'gift', 'watched', 'film', 'everyone', 'been', 'talking', 'neighborhood', 'story', 'rich', 'boy', 'who', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'off', 'dime', 'henchmen', 'late', 'grandfather', 'James', 'Garner', 'even', 'car', 'towed', 'away', 'angry', 'ashamed', 'part', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'call', 'police', 'US', 'even', 'creditors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'siphon', 'penny', 'bank', 'account', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'government', 'can', 'film', 'way', 'showing', 'Texas', 'oilman', 'Red', 'Stevens', 'Garner', 'role', 'actually', 'top', 'government', 'official', 'Garner', 'was', 'playing', 'George', 'Bush', 'Sr', 'even', 'makeup', 'people', 'seem', 'act', 'carefully', 'blotching', 'Garner', 'skin', 'rearranging', 'hairline', 'give', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'former', 'President.The', 'older', 'man', 'Red', 'never', 'been', 'forgiven', 'young', 'Jason', 'reasons', 'remain', 'shadowy', 'most', 'story', 'emerging', 'only', 'when', 'Jason', 'Ecuador', 'multicultural', 'romance', 'attractive', 'somewhat', 'older', 'Ecuadorian', 'librarian', 'human', 'rights', 'worker', 'Jason', 'dad', 'died', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Jason', 'been', 'convinced', 'Red', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Why', 'Red', 'never', 'told', 'Jason', 'truth', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Another', 'muted', 'romance', 'Mr.', 'Henderson', 'ancient', 'lawyer', 'living', 'due', 'having', 'received', 'Red', 'kidney', 'Lee', 'Meriweather', 'former', 'Miss', 'America', 'Catwoman', 'Batman', 'who', 'triumphant', 'return', 'big', 'screen', 'Miss', 'Hastings', 'assistant', 'secretary', 'two', 'are', 'obviously', 'love', 'maybe', 'interracial', 'aspect', 'romance', 'was', 'causing', 'producers', 'concern', 'share', 'only', 'glowing', 'eerily', 'lit', 'closeups', 'heads', 'are', 'always', 'photographed', 'togetherthisclose', 'two', 'petals', 'daisy.I', 'wept', 'buckets', 'movie', 'anyone', 'heart', ""n't"", 'made', 'stone', 'will', 'do', 'same', 'dock', 'movie', 'several', 'notches', 'abysmal', 'photography', 'cheesy', 'featurette', 'Balkan', 'TV', 'channel', '60s', 'limp', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'wannabe', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'playing', 'lead', 'dreadful', 'performance', 'based', 'totally', 'hair', 'also', 'course', 'message', 'worship', 'tacked', 'what', 'was', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'wealth', 'poverty', 'family', 'disease']",N/A

His own family seems to attend his funeral as mainly a formality prior to the reading of his will; a will in which each receives nothing of much consequence; due to the fact that they would undoubtedly abuse the companies and riches that the dead man has spent his life building.The depictions of the man's family are probably meant to evoke some sort of pity, because of their clear narcissism, greed, and tendency to talk about money to the exclusion of all else.  In short, these people are straw-men; stereotypes of rich, spoiled individuals with little or no depth invested in any of their personalities.Since the family members are all background characters who don't get much screen time, I probably shouldn't be too upset by that, but this is also a film about one character who does eventually develop, so there's kind of a sense that they could have given these characters a bit of depth if they'd wanted to; they just didn't, because they were trying to make a point.As if that point wasn't obvious enough, it's hammered in rather loudly by Hamilton; the seeming attorney of the dead tycoon.  Hamilton derides the family members for their character flaws, even while they're sitting right in front of him, though not directly to their faces, exactly.  I found myself wondering if Hamilton's comments to his secretary couldn't have taken place in the hallway, but it's a minor gripe in a film that deserves a much better effort.The one person who does receive anything of any substance is a young man named Jason Stevens; a college grad-age boy, who is so unrealistically spoiled, that he goes to a graveyard and forgets there's a funeral within the first five minutes of the film.  I couldn't make that up if I tried.Rather than being given cash or fancy businesses, however, Jason is given a series of missions to perform; missions which involve doing things like manual labor, having all of his stuff stolen, and making friends, and here is the part where the film is truly at it's best.  Between the eight minute mark, clear through to the end of the first half hour of the film, Jason learns all sorts of things that are worth learning, such as the value of work, the value of doing a job well, and who his friends really are, or to be more precise, who they aren't.Without money or a place to live, Jason quickly learns that he has no real friends.  Even his family isn't allowed to help him by order of Hamilton, but he has to make a friend somehow, and here is the first major issue that the movie stumbles into, at the thirty-three minute mark, almost on the dot.  That's when Jason runs into his ""friend,"" a young girl who, we later find out, has a terrible illness, which I insist must be sunlight poisoning, because she is clearly some kind of vampire.The little girl's name is Emily, and not only does she dress constantly in black, wear black lipstick, and carry an umbrella when there's no rain, but from her speech, mannerisms and the way she thinks, it's obvious that she is at least sixty.  She's like Fred Savage, except less sympathetic.I absolutely refuse, however, to pin any of the blame for this character's enormously-grating personality on Abigail Breslan.  She did a good job depicting the character that she was given.  No, the fault lies with the character herself; with Emily.  Where there could have been the believable character of a sick, pitiable child, we instead get an aged philosopher, who flawlessly predicts people's actions for the benefit of her conniving schemes; schemes such as teaching Jason the true meaning of friendship, and hooking him up with her mother.  There is no time in this movie where she doesn't come across as a smaller, paler version of Guinan from Star Trek, and it's entirely the fault of whoever wrote her dialogue and role in the story.  Hands down, I would say that this is the worst thing about this movie; worth a whole star down by itself, because of its prominence in the movie from this point on.  The movie has other problems, but none that keep coming back again and again, like...  Well, like a terminal disease, if you'll forgive that.So anyway, Jason succeeds in making friends with the wise Miyagi nosferatu, or at least, he pretends to at first.  Later, he really does make friends with her, visiting her in the hospital, and helping her out as best he can, which isn't easy, since he has very little money, and she never seems to shoot him so much as a hopeful smile.  Vampires can't be good to others, you know.Upon receiving his most recent instructions, and returning to the hospital, Jason finds Master Yoda's room empty, except for a very, very cruel nurse, who tells him that she's ""with the lord now.""  In the next scene, he enters a chapel and there she is.  Oh!  Ha ha ha!  I get it.  I'll bet she pulls that trick every week with somebody; fools them into thinking their friends and relatives are dead, then it really turns out she was kidding.  Ha ha HA!  Seriously, though; this nurse should be fired.In the chapel (yes, vampires can walk on holy ground.  In fact, they need to sleep in it,) Jason and Obi-Wan discuss why she's so darn messed up in the head.  Apparently, having a terminal disease makes you age fifty years, although they do skip over the part about her being undead.  Presumably, some secrets are just too personal.In the very next scene, Jason meets with Master Splinter's mom, who seems not to have learned her daughter's wisdom, though she does make up for it by crying very unconvincingly on three separate occasions.  In one scene, she's even facing away from the camera, and it's still impossible to mistake her performance for real crying, because of the fact that she overplays it so darn much.Well, anyway, Jason and the mother get into a very shoehorned relationship, which didn't need to happen, and takes away from the movie at just about every stage.  Nothing about her presence in this part of the movie is necessary or pleasant, as she more or less sits uncomfortably at the dinner table of Jason's family on thanksgiving, doing and saying next to nothing of any substance.  Once again, Jason's family get to revel in their nature as stereotypes before Jason is sent on his next mission; go to a third world country for some charity work in a library.While Jason is in that third world country, he convinces a guide to help him find information about what happened to his father, though the guide is reluctant, because doing so involves going into ""drug lord territory.""  Sure enough, they haven't been there for five minutes, when they're assaulted by drug lords, who, just like real drug lords, are a small gang of guys in the middle of a jungle, with basic guns, who all dress like Indiana Jones, and don't seem to have any house, village, or anything to live in.  Sure.Anyway, the budget drug lords keep Jason and the guide prisoner, make fun of them on Christmas just to be jerks, then threaten to kill them the next day, because, presumably, a dead hostage is far more valuable than a living one.  Fortunately, though, they fail, and Jason and the guide escape, thanks to a conveniently-unlocked door.  They then decide that with miles and miles of jungle all around them, their best chance of escaping from people with guns is to run through an open fiend, with no cover more significant than two-foot-high grass.Of course, in order to justify his trip to a third world country, and as such, the whole dead father subplot, Jason must bring back something from his travels, and sure enough...  It's a doll for Master Genkai.  How sweet.  That's one neck she can afford to bite.Of course, because we definitely haven't had enough of the lame relationship subplot, Jason must take Rafiki and her mother to a ranch that he worked on earlier in the movie, for a romantic interlude having nothing whatsoever to do with the main redemption plot.  However, while he's there, he's challenged by the videos of his dead grandfather to find a dream to fulfill with his life.  Jason then receives a sum of one hundred million, and decides to use it as the first third of the money needed for building a home in honor of his friend; Shifu.  A home which will, he says, take care of ""a dozen or more families.""Now, I admit that I have never built a home to care for a dozen or more families, and the economy is very bad right now, and likely to get worse, but it seems to me that three hundred million is enough to take very good care of over fifty to a hundred families for the rest of their lives, even once you factor in the construction costs.  Blowing all that cash on a few dozen people made less sense, to me, than most of the things going on here.  I mean, couldn't he just found a new hospital or something?  Some of the big ones admit loads and loads of patients at a time.  I know things are bad for medicine now that the government's devouring the medical profession, but Jason's plan hardly seems cost effective to me.Anyway, cost effective or not, it seems to win over Hamilton, who gives Jason the rest of his grandfather's money; a large, large sum.  He becomes rich and powerful, and decides to do right by the people of the world, and is free to (presumably) marry the mother of his young friend.  The only problem is that Gandalf dies of her terminal illness, though I'm sure she'll come back at the turn of the tide, or the next time full moonlight hits her remains.I want to go on record right here, however, as saying that I found this movie only half bad, but in a way, that's why it hurt so much to watch it.  It's obvious that this film was built around the skeleton of a story that was very solid.  It's just that for whatever reason, that skeleton had rotten bits all over it, and was generally picked clean.I like the movie's message, the plot and the fact that Jason really does get a lot of money at the end (teaching us all that sometimes, what we need really is what we want, just not for the same reasons,) but there was just too much garbage piled onto this story by whoever assembled, wrote and/or directed it.  Too many unnecessary movie elements were inserted where they weren't needed.  The unnaturally-wise nature of Emily, the romance with the mother, and the whole dead father subplot spring to my mind as being things that could easily have been cut from the movie, and replaced with something more substantial, like some more scenes of Jason learning lessons or something.  I also have no problem with the religious and spiritual elements of the film, though like everything else, it could have used another spoonful of subtlety.In the end, this is a bad movie, but it feels like the kind of bad movie that was based on something good.  Apparently, it's actually based on a book, in fact.  I haven't read the book myself, but I know someone who has, and she really enjoyed it, so why not read that instead of watching this?  The Ultimate Gift is one awesome concept after another, stumbled over clumsily, as though in the desire to appeal to a demographic, rather than to be a quality film, and that kind of approach never, ever, ever ends well.",2,The Ultimate Stumble,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,11482,"['Beware', 'Ultimate', 'Spoilers', 'lie', 'ahead.Someone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie',

1077924,ABHBURBXUZFF8,B000QUU7KC,Kurt Miller,"[0, 0]","The Ultimate Gift is a 2006 film directed by Michael Sajbel and based on a novel of the same name by Jim Stovall. The plot involves a rich young man named Jason Stevens who undergoes an obstacle course set up by his dead grandfather, Ray Stevens. If he jumps through all the hoops properly, he will get his share of the inheritance. The Stevens are a spoiled, sophisticated family known for their extravagant and fashionable livestyles. Like Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind, they don't know how good they've got it. Most of them (particulary Jason's two uncles) are rude, pathetic, arrogant, annoying and discontent. Some of their familes have serious marital and moral problems but it's always difficult to feel sorry for sinners when they live in lavish mansions.Mr. Ray Stevens has just so arranged that all Jason's luxuries are taken away so he will learn the value of work. While Jason is on the streets, he meets a single mother named Alexia who is struggling to pay the doctor's bills for her sickly daughter Emily. For the first time, Jason feels sorry for someone besides himself and endeavours to help them.Drew Fuller (Jason) does an excellent job showing the gradual transformation from a rude, self-centered punk to a mature, thoughtful and well-mannered gentleman. Brian Dennehy is also eye-catching in a small supporting role as a cowboy. The rest of the cast, on the other hand, just seem to be doing their jobs. The only actor I can think of who stands out like a sore thumb is Abigail Breslin (Emily), who seems to say her lines in an awkward, machine-line tone. James Garner doesn't have much to do, since his role is a cameo. He is just such a big iconic name so Hollywood figured having him in this movie would draw the masses to the theaters.The dialogue is occasionally a bit clunky (Would Jason's uncle really threaten his lawyer on him simply for not telling him about his inheritance?) and some of the sequence of events could have been better explained (Why did the policeman take Jason away from the resturaunt when he was watching his former girlfriend warm up to another man?) but I give the movie five stars simply because I feel like it has a potentially great story to work with.For all of it's faults (mainly average, unexceptional performances and occasionally trite lines) The Ultimate Gift is one of the better of the ""Hallmark"" values films, due to it's great messages of self-sacrifice, courage and friendship.Five Stars.",5,"Very good, I thought.",1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,2466,"['Ultimate', 'Gift', '2006', 'film', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Sajbel', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Jim', 'Stovall', 'plot', 'rich', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Jason', 'Stevens', 'who', 'obstacle', 'course', 'set', 'up', 'dead', 'grandfather', 'Ray', 'Stevens', 'hoops', 'properly', 'will', 'get', 'share', 'inheritance', 'Stevens', 'are', 'spoiled', 'sophisticated', 'family', 'known', 'extravagant', 'fashionable', 'livestyles', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'Gone', 'Wind', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'good', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Most', 'particulary', 'Jason', 'two', 'uncles', 'are', 'rude', 'pathetic', 'arrogant', 'annoying', 'discontent', 'familes', 'have', 'serious', 'marital', 'moral', 'problems', 'always', 'difficult', 'feel', 'sorry', 'sinners', 'when', 'live', 'lavish', 'mansions.Mr', 'Ray', 'Stevens', 'just', 'so', 'arranged', 'Jason', 'luxuries', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'will', 'learn', 'value', 'work', 'Jason', 'streets', 'single', 'mother', 'named', 'Alexia', 'who', 'struggling', 'pay', 'doctor', 'bills', 'sickly', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'first', 'time', 'Jason', 'sorry', 'someone', 'endeavours', 'help', 'them.Drew', 'Fuller', 'Jason', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'gradual', 'transformation', 'rude', 'self-centered', 'punk', 'mature', 'thoughtful', 'well-mannered', 'gentleman', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'also', 'eye-catching', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', 'cowboy', 'rest', 'cast', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'jobs', 'only', 'actor', 'can', 'think', 'who', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Emily', 'who', 'say', 'lines', 'awkward', 'machine-line', 'tone', 'James', 'Garner', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'role', 'cameo', 'just', 'such', 'big', 'iconic', 'name', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'figured', 'having', 'movie', 'would', 'draw', 'masses', 'theaters.The', 'dialogue', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'clunky', 'Would', 'Jason', 'uncle', 'really', 'threaten', 'lawyer', 'simply', 'not', 'telling', 'inheritance', 'sequence', 'events', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'explained', 'Why', 'did', 'policeman', 'take', 'Jason', 'away', 'resturaunt', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'warm', 'up', 'man', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'simply', 'feel', 'potentially', 'great', 'story', 'work', 'with.For', 'faults', 'mainly', 'average', 'unexceptional', 'performances', 'occasionally', 'trite', 'lines', 'Ultimate', 'Gift', 'one', 'better', 'Hallmark', 'values', 'films', 'due', 'great', 'messages', 'self-sacrifice', 'courage', 'friendship.Five', 'Stars']",N/A

Drew Fuller as the lead played a very believable Jason, a young man who thought his inheritance was going to be the gift of much money. This excellent movie is based on the best-selling book ""The Ultimate Gift"" by Jim Stovall.  Jason goes through several challenges his rich grandfather, Red Stevens, sets up through a partner and loyal friend, Ted Hamilton, played by Bill Cobbs.  The perennial question of whether money buys happiness is thoughtfully posed in several relationships Jason has when people close to him think he is broke.  His gold-digging girlfriend, aloof mother, alpha male uncles, show what they value.  Jason then meets a young woman with a child when he needs to find a true friend as one of the challenges his grandfather requires.  The child is Abigail Beslin, who, as Emily, both tugs your heart strings and makes you laugh.Jason's Grandfather, Red, leaves several videotapes, depending on the challenge Jason solved.  Over the course of the challenges, Jason changes and sees life through new and deep meaning.  He becomes a better man.  Red left Jason two gifts, and the most important was not money.

In this movie we start with a trust fund baby Jason who has spent his whole life as one big party. And upon the death of his grandfather he is given the opportunity to receive a series of gifts if he is willing to follow his late grandfathers instructions. His first choice is to accept these series of gifts or to walk away and forfeit his inheritance.We watch Jason grow from a shallow man to the man of worth he could be. The cast of characters and how they were written is necessary to see the lessons and growth in such a short period that is afforded to us by a movie. This would be a great feature for the whole family. There is no question that this is a message film and a good one; a story of friendship, trust, values, respect, charity, loyalty and respect among others. Everyone who watches this movie will walk away learning something and I think it will be unique to the viewer.Life itself is a gift that we have all been graced with. And we should each learn what each of our gifts are and then proceed to share what we are able too with others.

Zwick,"[6, 26]","Based on the novel by Jim Stovall, ""The Ultimate Gift"" is a hunk of sentimental whimsy that's as apt to stimulate your gag reflex as your tear ducts or funny bone.  It's strictly for those with a fondness for manipulative tearjerkers that aim to instill inspirational life lessons into their beaten-down viewers.Jason Stevens (the un-charismatic Drew Fuller) is a spoiled, ne'er-do-well rich kid who learns the ""true meaning of life"" from his dead, zillionaire grandfather (the venerable James Garner) who has set up a series of values-instilling ""tests"" for the young man to pass before he can receive the hundred-million-dollar inheritance that has been earmarked for him in the old codger's will.  In the heavily contrived screenplay, childhood leukemia, Latin American rebels and a bevy of overly-caricatured elitist snobs all get thrown into the mix - and not only is it all supposed to somehow fit together, but it's clear we're intended to get something worthwhile and meaningful out of the whole shebang as well.  Actually, you'll probably find yourself wanting to throttle most of the characters in the movie, particularly the condescending, control-freak of a dead man (even from beyond the grave, he instructs Jason on how to live his life via videotapes he recorded before his death) and the two benignly smug partners he's instructed to carry on the business of soul-restoration in his absence.  Even Abigail Breslin, of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" fame, ultimately sets the teeth on edge with her too-cutesy-by-half impersonation of a dying child.And just in case you somehow managed to miss the message that they have been pounding into your skull for nigh unto two full hours at this point, the filmmakers thoughtfully provide a recap of each of Jason's ""gifts"" as part of the closing credits.""The Ultimate Gift"" is one of those movies that exists solely to reduce its audience to a quivering mass of throat lumps and tears while making them feel good about themselves and the world around them at the same time.  Unfortunately, it has all the grit and depth of one of those Hallmark Hall of Fame Christmas-miracle tales that crop up on TV with alarming regularity every holiday season.

He had concluded that most of them were too shallow to concern themselves with anything but money and things. He had a bit of hope for something more in his grandson, Jason Stevens (Drew Fuller). Rather than just giving him money or other assets, he decides to give him 'The Ultimate Gift'.There are numerous pearls of wisdom in this movie that many know but some have never learned.

This is not to say that all Christmas movies should be light and fluffy and feel good--one of the greatest of all time, Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is hardly a barrel of laughs for a good bit of the picture, but has stood the test of time. The two stars I've given it pertain mainly to members of the terrific cast--Abigail Breslin, Ali Hillis, Brian Dennehy, a still radiant Lee Meriwether, and of course, James Garner.  Their efforts should be applauded--but they struggled valiantly in the face of a one-note performance by Drew Fuller, who also seems to have only one facial expression.  Also, the story left me cold and seemed to wander all over the place; the love story between Fuller and Hillis was not convincing, nor was the ""friendship"" between Fuller and Breslin-- and as for the sudden shift to a drug war in South America, please!

1077986,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000QUU7KC,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[42, 45]","Although I often dislike ""message films"" I found this one to be inspirational, educational, practical, and even spiritual to some degree.Amazon and JP's Picks in the Spotlight Reviews have done a fine job at discussing the plot of this, so I'll dispense with that here in my review.  I found this to be a rather profound film that discusses the connection between wealth and happiness.  The film is faulty in that it is pretty much preaching to the choir as most of us know that money in of itself does not bring happiness.  Just ask Lindsey Lohan and Brittany Spears for the truth in that.  However, it is the journey of the main character to discover that truth that is touching if not improbable at times.  This film, in spite of its beautiful message, is not without its flaws.The coincidences and contrivances within the plot are rather annoying but fortunately forgivable.  For example, we get ludicrous scenes like the one in which the main character becomes a kidnap victim of a drug lord while doing ""community work"" in Peru as part of his numerous ""gifts.""  This was supposed to be a lesson in learning and giving, but ultimately (and conveniently) teaches him the value of human life.  However, the scene is rather silly and improbable and serves as a great distraction from the film's greater message.  It just doesn't fit the film and looks like a scene from another film and a needless stretch.  This is all rather forgivable though as the main character continues his journey in learning what is really important in life.The various ""gifts"" that he learns serve as a wonderful teaching tool if you watch this with your family.  I often would stop it and ask my kids what ""gift"" is he receiving at a given point in the film.  The ending replays the various gifts just in case you missed any, so don't shut it off at the credits.Some of the acting is spot on and some of it less so.  This film was a wonderful return for Brian Dennihey[sp] who has been absent from the screen for far too long.  James Garner is wonderfully insightful in his limited role.  He is as funny, sarcastic and tired of life's crap as he was in his seriesThe Rockford Files, and tender and emotional in a way we don't often see him on film. Drew Fuller as the main star is just okay.  He plays the role fairly well, but it seems to be no great stretch for him.  It's the kind of role Michael J. Fox would have played on a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV-movie in his early career.  Ali Hillis is both wonderfully beautiful in that girl-next-door kind of way and very talented as she gives a solid performance here as the mother of a cancer-stricken child played by Abigail Breslin (SignsandLittle Miss Sunshine) who actually does not give us one of her better performances.  I honestly felt she was over acting a number of times, but to be fair, her role was not that well written.  Bill Cobbs and Lee Meriweather lend fine support as the trustees of Garner's Will and lend much needed credibility to the film.This film is both profound and simple, touching and overly sentimental, nicely acted and too pedestrian at times, well-intentioned and manipulative, and, lastly, predictable and happy to be so.  In spite of it's flaws the film is very enjoyable and heart-warming.  I intentionally noted the flaws as when I recommend a film, I do like to be honest and not fool folks in thinking that a four or five star film is perfect and this one isn't by a long shot, but it is a still wonderful experience in spite of its flaws and well worth your viewing.",4,A film you need to see with your family.,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,3535,"['often', 'dislike', 'message', 'films', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'inspirational', 'educational', 'practical', 'even', 'spiritual', 'degree.Amazon', 'JP', 'Picks', 'Spotlight', 'Reviews', 'have', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'discussing', 'plot', 'so', ""'ll"", 'dispense', 'here', 'review', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'profound', 'film', 'connection', 'wealth', 'happiness', 'film', 'faulty', 'pretty', 'much', 'preaching', 'choir', 'most', 'know', 'money', 'not', 'bring', 'happiness', 'Just', 'ask', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'Brittany', 'Spears', 'truth', 'However', 'journey', 'main', 'character', 'discover', 'truth', 'touching', 'not', 'improbable', 'times', 'film', 'spite', 'beautiful', 'message', 'not', 'flaws.The', 'coincidences', 'contrivances', 'plot', 'are', 'rather', 'annoying', 'fortunately', 'forgivable', 'example', 'get', 'ludicrous', 'scenes', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'kidnap', 'victim', 'drug', 'lord', 'doing', 'community', 'work', 'Peru', 'part', 'numerous', 'gifts', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'lesson', 'learning', 'giving', 'ultimately', 'conveniently', 'value', 'human', 'life', 'However', 'scene', 'rather', 'silly', 'improbable', 'great', 'distraction', 'film', 'greater', 'message', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film', 'scene', 'film', 'needless', 'stretch', 'rather', 'forgivable', 'main', 'character', 'journey', 'learning', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'life.The', 'various', 'gifts', 'serve', 'wonderful', 'teaching', 'tool', 'watch', 'family', 'often', 'would', 'stop', 'ask', 'kids', 'what', 'gift', 'receiving', 'given', 'point', 'film', 'ending', 'various', 'gifts', 'just', 'case', 'missed', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'shut', 'off', 'credits.Some', 'acting', 'spot', 'less', 'so', 'film', 'was', 'wonderful', 'return', 'Brian', 'Dennihey', '[', 'sp', ']', 'who', 'been', 'absent', 'screen', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'James', 'Garner', 'wonderfully', 'insightful', 'limited', 'role', 'funny', 'sarcastic', 'tired', 'life', 'crap', 'was', 'seriesThe', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'tender', 'emotional', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'film', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'main', 'star', 'just', 'okay', 'role', 'fairly', 'well', 'be', 'great', 'stretch', 'kind', 'role', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'TV-movie', 'early', 'career', 'Ali', 'Hillis', 'wonderfully', 'beautiful', 'girl-next-door', 'kind', 'way', 'very', 'talented', 'solid', 'performance', 'here', 'mother', 'cancer-stricken', 'child', 'played', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'SignsandLittle', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'who', 'actually', 'not', 'give', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'honestly', 'felt', 'was', 'over', 'acting', 'number', 'times', 'be', 'fair', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'written', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Lee', 'Meriweather', 'lend', 'fine', 'support', 'trustees', 'Garner', 'Will', 'lend', 'much', 'needed', 'credibility', 'film.This', 'film', 'profound', 'simple', 'touching', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'nicely', 'acted', 'too', 'pedestrian', 'times', 'well-intentioned', 'manipulative', 'lastly', 'predictable', 'happy', 'be', 'so', 'spite', 'flaws', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'heart-warming', 'intentionally', 'noted', 'flaws', 'when', 'recommend', 'film', 'do', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'fool', 'folks', 'thinking', 'four', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'perfect', 'one', ""n't"", 'long', 'shot', 'still', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'spite', 'flaws', 'well', 'viewing']",N/A

This movie is hardly in that vein, there's a couple of scenes in a hospital chapel that are very well done and just affirm a belief in God by the characters - that's it, nothing even close to evangelical hysteria.Mostly it's an entertaining and heart warming movie that the whole family can enjoy.  Like so many PG and PG-13 movies, the producers and directors have to actually work on the plot and acting to make the movie good versus relying on gratuitous sex and violence in R rated movies.

It is hard to sympathize with a family and protagonist so phenomenally privileged (this is one of the reasons that people hated GW Bush).  It is questionable to glorify a grandfather whose fortune was made in oil and commercial farming.  I was uncomfortable with the suggestions of prosperity gospel and the depiction of such a stark about-face in the life of the main character.  I didn't like the fact that he never really had to choose between worldly riches and spiritual ones.  Taken literally, as other reviewers will tell you, the characters have questionable sincerity and a lack of depth.That said, the acting and filming is fairly well-done, with Abigail Breslin phenomenal as the daughter of the single mother and love interest.  I also loved the statement by the mother that her daughter was the best choice she had ever made.  Additionally, there is a touching relationship between the protagonist and these characters that seems authentic and valuable.  In contrast, the shallowness of a former love interest and of the protagonists' family is fairly well-shown.  I received this film from the public library, and it included a Bible study, which added depth to the film and was was valuable to me and my family.This film is recommended for families, including children, and for discussion of its pros and cons.

Are you looking for a movie that pulls you in and makes you stop and think yet entertains you with laughter and tears at the same time? If the answer is yes, then pick up this pleasant surprise of a movie.The premise of The Ultimate Gift (based on Jim Stovall's book by the same title) is a snotty rich kids expects to inherit millions from his Grandfather to continue with his limitless cashflow of a life he's lived thus far. Boy is he in for a surprise. The film begins with a billionaire's death. His more than superficous, obnoxious relatives all come in for the reading of the will. Of course, no one is pleased with the reading. The main character, grandson, Jason Stevens, is no exception. The billionaire,  aptly played by James Garner,  has left Jason a peculiar gift. A series of gifts actually, via video tape and delivered through his longtime lawyer and friend Ted Hamilton, played by Bill Cobbs. Jason Stevens must successfully complete all requirements of each ""test"" to get each gift, without knowing what he gets each time he is successful and always with the threat that if he blows it, everything is lost.Jason's world is literally turned upside down with each new gift as everything is literally taken away from him--his money, his friends, his car, his home, his dignity and even his freedom.Not since The Christmas Carol, has a story successfully engaged its viewers in such a journey. Screenwriting newcomer Cheryl McKay does a beautiful job adapting Jim Stovall's brilliant tale. An enhancement to the already great book was McKay's expansion of the ""one true friend"" little girl character Emily, played by Abigail Breslin. In the film version of Ultimate Gift, Emily is a major storyline which worked well for the big screen. Certainly director Michael Sajbel deserves credit and mention for the well done adaptation as well.I thoroughly enjoyed the casting as well, especially James Garner, Bill Cobbs and Lee Meriwether. If you've ever been spoiled, taken your life for granted, felt broke, been disenchanted about your life, been unappreciative, or just had one of those days, grab a tissue and watch The Ultimate Gift.

1078009,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000QUU7KC,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[5, 10]","I have a friend who recently watched Facing The Giants. I asked her what she thought - she said, ""It felt contrived."" That interested me because, the night before, I had watched The Ultimate Gift and felt the same way about it. Come to think of it, most modern-day Christian films seem contrived, from Time Changer to One Night With The King. (Amazing Grace and The Passion Of The Christ are obvious exceptions.) Why is that?What is it about modern-day Christians that causes many of us to be attracted to stories that are contrived? Why are films being made for us by companies like Fox Faith that are not real, the way we supposedly say our faith is? Christian novels, such as The Shack, are alarmingly artificial; so are Christian children's books. Are we so shallow, unimaginative and inexperienced at life and art that we cannot do better than to fulfill the meaning of the word contrived: ""obviously planned or forced; artificial; strained?""Does that say something about us and our faith?This latest film from Fox Faith, the Christian production arm of Fox, is a great example. They say they are producing ""movies you can believe in."" In the case of The Ultimate Gift, I don't think so. I really wanted to like it, too, because it was highly rated on many web sites, was full of good actors, and had a basic concept by blind writer Jim Stovall that wasn't half-bad. But the script is bad.When a writer - Cheryl McKay, in this case, working off Jim Stovall's book - is compelled to put adult language in the mouth of a child in order to make her seem cute - which happens in the case of Abigail Breslin, who plays Emily Rose - you know you're in trouble. I was sick of her adult-sounding cuteness by the end of the film. As a matter of fact, not only do the words not fit the character, but Breslin is way over-acting. She may have been good in Little Miss Sunshine and Nim's Island, but she is next to terrible here. Wearing dark lipstick and carrying an open, pink umbrella doesn't help either. I don't care if leukemia victims actually do those sorts of things, they did not make her character any more convincing or likable.So, Breslin all but ruined the film for me. The only things that saved it were the performances by some of the other actors: the understated performance by Drew Fuller as Jason Stevens, the young man that is trying to earn his dead grandfather's inheritance by fulfilling a battery of quests; the outstanding job by Bill Cobbs as Mr. Theophillis Hamilton, Jason's grandfather's lawyer, partner and friend; and the elegant portrayal by Lee Meriwether of Miss Hastings, Mr. Hamilton's secretary. Other than a handful of typically solid character actors, such as Brian Dennehy, most of the rest of the cast is rather amateurish, and some are quite annoying. All the portrayals of ""Southerners"" are so stereotypical they're sickening.The disappointing script and amateurish acting of the supporting cast, and especially the overacting of Abigail Breslin, speaks to the lack of experience of director Michael O. Sajbel. He only had five films under his belt when he took this one on, and his last was the embarrassingly unbiblical, adolescent film One Night With The King (2006). I will say one thing: The Ultimate Gift is an improvement over that piece of fluff. And something else: production company Dean River Productions has given the film some very strong production values. (They were also the ""hired guns"" on Billy Graham's The Climb and Bobby Jones: Stroke Of Genius.)But what we're really talking about here is a glorified Hallmark film. This is TV fare, not theatrical. We don't expect much from made-for-TV movies; we do from theatrical ones. There is just no realistic substance to The Ultimate Gift, just as there was none in One Night With The King. Had these been fantasies, that would have been fine. But these are both realistic stories, and neither holds up under the most liberal scrutiny. While the very idea of fulfilling a series of quests in order to receive an inheritance is contrived, the film need not have been, had the characters been real people, rather than stereotypes; and had the script and film not been filled with so many cliches.As with a person, substance is what makes a story good. Shallowness, lack of imagination, contrivance, stereotypes and cliches - these are the signs of a creative spirit that is anything but. It is folly for Christians to continue churning out books and movies of this sort. What they are doing is creating an image of Christians as superficial, artificial people because that is how our films and novels are. Someone with a godly, biblical standard and the vision to go with it needs to step up to the plate and start swinging. Is there anyone like that out there?I can't help repeating CS Lewis' oft quoted take on Christian books and films: ""We don't need more people writing 'Christian books' [but] what we need is more Christians writing good books. - CS LewisAmen to that. It almost deserves an altar call.Waitsel Smith",3,CONTRIVED FOR CHRISTIANS,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,5021,"['have', 'friend', 'who', 'recently', 'watched', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'asked', 'what',

The way it threw in god and Jesus made me think it was produced by an evangelical church.A mother's little girl dies, and the mother is simply inspired by her billionaire boyfriend building a hospital--with a chapel, he had to add (hint, hint, you need to go to church if you want to get cured). Where is the reality of an emotionally destroyed parent?I really liked the young girl character. She was fun to listen to, and one of my objections to the movie plot was killing her off. We don't care how much fear and tension is in a movie or novel, but we want the good guys to win. Even in page-turners where a lot of good guys get killed, we want a happy or at least satisfying ending. This movie attempted the satisfying ending with the flight of a butterfly (supposedly the girl's spirit.If they wanted a religious theme, then have the girl saved by a miracle. How about the boyfriend trying to decide whether to invest in some polluting industry or basic cancer research. He finally decides on basic research, and a discovery made and the girl is cured!Also, that hooky statue of Jesus was a bit much. In fact, that whole scene was a heavy handed nod to born-again Christians.The ancient Greek Thucydides in his ""History of the Peloponnesian Wars"" said of the plague in Athens: ""As for the gods, it seemed one and the same whether you worshiped them or not, when you saw the good and the bad dying indiscriminately.""

(A remake, of sorts, of an old Rock Hudson movie, Magnificent Obsession.) Saddly this writer/director combination isn't ready for prime time--it all looks like a rough first draft.[Plot points to be revealed in the following discussion.]The opening scene shows a mother & daughter at the rainy graveside of billionaire James Garner.  Why are they there?  Apparently because his name is on the wing of the hospital where the daughter is being treated for leukemia.  Oh yes?  Would any mother take her critically ill daughter to a funeral of a stranger?  And even if she wanted to, viewings may be open to the public but surely a billionaire's graveside ceremony is reserved for family members and invited guests.Do waiters gush ""Oh sir, most of our patrons find this wine too expensive!""  ?? Only in creaking scripts like this.In short, the writer had no idea how to illustrate & move along his story so it's full of lame scenes.  How is it that someone who has a trust fund can overnight become homeless?  By what mechanism was his bank account emptied out?  Are we really to believe that shallow jet-setters have no one who will put them oup for the night if they are abruptly ejected from their condo?The list of life-doesn't-work-that-way scenes clunk's along with slow moving, artless direction.  And why does the little girl wear ghoulish purple lipstick?Apparently those who praised this movie are willing to accept any tripe  as long as there's no sex or violence.
