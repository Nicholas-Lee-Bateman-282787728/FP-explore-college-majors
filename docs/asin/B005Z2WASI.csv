We instantly loved King Julien -- he's so funny!!  So we immediately rented ""King Julien Day"" and ""Operation: DVD Premier"" only to be disappointed by King Julien's mean-ness & rudeness.  I realize that the essence of the King Julien character is self-centeredness, which is really what makes him so funny ... but he just seemed more ruthlessly selfish (almost evil) on the other DVDs.  In fact, we returned those two DVDs after just one viewing; didn't feel like exposing our kids to that.  However on *this* DVD (Operation Blowhole) he wasn't mean or ruthless, just funny -- which makes it more ""family friendly"" for us.
