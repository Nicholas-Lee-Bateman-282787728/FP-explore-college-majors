However, the set I bought on Amazon only contains Episodes 1-16, which ends with the reign of Victoria.  There evidently is an episode 17 which covers the period from Queen Victoria's death and Edward's accession to the throne and goes through to the present reign of Elizabeth II.  I watched some of episode 17 on youtube.  However, it's not as nice as having the DVD to go with the rest of the episodes.  Amazon doesn't appear to be selling Episode 17 separately, so maybe it's not available in this country yet?

For what it is, an introduction to the political relationship between the British monarchs and their subjects, this is a fascinating series.  This set examines the British monarchy from the period just after the collapse of the Roman empire until the return of Charles II and the restoration of the Crown following the death of Cromwell, the Lord Protector.  It accomplishes all this in just 6 hour-long episodes, and so, necessarily, moves at a breakneck speed, over more than a thousand years of British history.  As a result, much gets glossed over, and even more gets left out.  Queen Boudicca of the Iceni, who led a brutal revolt against the Romans in the 1st century isn't even mentioned. Alfred the Great (the only British monarch so styled) whizzes past so quickly that if you're not prepared for it, you might get whiplash.  Richard II's remarkable role in quelling a peasant uprising while still a mere boy is unremarked upon, I could go on, and on.Instead, I'll focus on the series strengths, which is an in-depth look at how the relationship between the monarchy and its people shaped not just the British government, but also that of the United States. The people of the British Isles, this series notes, were less tolerant of absolute monarchy than those of the Continent, and therefore, demanded and received more constraints on the power of their kings and queens.  Dr. Starkey focuses on the delicate balancing act that most monarchs had to maintain in order to stay in power.  Another great strength of this series is its discussion of the Protestant Reformation and its effect on the monarchy and the British people.  The religious conflicts of that age are a reminder of the law of unintended consequences.  Henry VIII just wanted to divorce his wife, and marry a woman whom he thought might give him a male heir.  His desperate actions in furtherance of this goal led to more than a hundred years of religious fighting, and tremendous loss of life.  He got his boy, eventually, but the kid didn't last much past his father.As good as this series was, to me the most frustrating and inexplicable aspect of it is the knowledge that the series, as put out by the BBC in  the UK is actually much longer.  We're only getting a small slice of the delish pie.  I'd like to ask the Beeb, what gives?  Think your Merkin cousins don't have the stomach for the whole thing?  I'd suggest that they think again, and issue the whole series here in the US, the way they did  across the Pond. We've got enough appetite for the whole thing.Therefore, I'm deducting one star for the insulting abridgment of this fine series.

1008277,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000GYI3C2,C. O. DeRiemer,"[10, 10]","Think of a full-color CliffsNotes combined with one of those Monty Python spoofs of a BBC interviewer and you have a slightly unfair idea of Monarchy. In six episodes of less than an hour each Dr. David Starkey whips us along in a survey of England's...well, Britain's...no, make that the United Kingdom's...queens and kings. Sir David, as he is known in punctilious society, has given us an elegantly written and presented quick tour, sumptuously mounted. There are beautiful location shots of castles and palaces along with actors richly dressed to the purpose looking at us while Starkey tells us what they were plotting. The one great value of the series, to my mind, is the theme he gives his survey, and that is the continuing struggle between the sovereigns, on the one hand, to be supreme, and the barons, followed by the merchant class, on the other, to maintain a tight hold on the power of the purse. That struggle in one form or another gave us the Magna Carta, the grudging acceptance of shared rule along with kingly restraint, the concept of the rule of law, and the rise of the common man, even if, as in the House of Commons, the common man and woman wasn't represented all that well by the landed and mercantile classes who filled the Commons' seats. No matter how you look at it, England is a remarkable story for which the civilized world, which often includes the United States, should be grateful.But don't expect more from Monarchy than a barely scratched surface. In my view, Starkey did a reasonably fine though fast job of the tumultuous period leading up to Edward the Confessor and the Norman Conquest, the characters and issues of two of the Tudors, Henry VII and Henry VIII, and the issues that led to Cromwell. Everything else for me was a blur. British history is so rich and, because so much of the history of the United States directly draws from it, so accessible to most of us, that I have mixed feelings about Monarchy. For grandparents, it would make a great present for a precocious middle school grandchild. For those reasonably familiar with British history, it simply condenses too much. Starkey uses his theme to effectively frame what he gives us, but what he gives is so little and so without nuance that, for me, it quickly became something to watch while glancing through the newspapers. Starkey doesn't help things by his manner of presentation. He is deadly serious and absolutely without doubt, humor or skepticism. I'd love to see Eric Idle or Terry Jones interview him. With Starkey's reputation for rudeness, it would be quite a show.This Monarchy comes in two DVD discs. Starkey starts with the waves of Viking and Anglo-Saxon invasions and leaves us when Charles II restores the monarchy after the death of Cromwell. Future programs that take us to modern times are being shown in Britain and will eventually be available on DVDs over here. If anyone can sort out the differences between the British Region 2 DVDs and this American version, have a go. I can't believe that the American version is as severely edited, or even edited at all, compared to the Region two set. Yet trying to compare what is on the Region one and two discs with episode titles and elapsed times is just about impossible.The DVD picture and audio are immaculate. If you're interested in British history, especially a history that goes well beyond mere kings and queens, try Simon Schama'sA History of Britain - The Complete Collection. It is a fascinating documentary beautifully presented. Be prepared...it runs 15 hours. Now that's a documentary.",3,An elegant CliffsNotes version of Britain's kings and queens.

They managed to turn Henry II's argument with Thomas Becket into a good guy versus bad guy thing (talk about simplification!).  Perhaps the producers felt the general public was incapable of understanding anything more than that (an idea I very much disagree with).Additionally, if you hope to find any mention of the women who were so important to English history, don't go looking for it here.
