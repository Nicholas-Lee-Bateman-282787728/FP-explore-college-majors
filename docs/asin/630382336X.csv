All nuances and antics by the Fab Four, as The Beatles were sometimes called, are crystal clear. The Bonuses are great and explain a lot about the era, The Beatles, and others involved in the production of this film. It's sad that at least one project is missing from this DVD set, but in my opinion it does not detract from this set.The DVD stands as a marvelous compilation of good, clean fun, with the worst being the cigarette smoking on the film which is kept to a minimum. Even the bonus interviews are full of positive praises for everyone involved.Remember the party scene when The Beatles are then interviewed by the media? The hostesses would come by with a platter and just as each was about to reach for a sandwich, the hostess would walk away. It was their party and they just could not get a bite to eat! The film also includes some intelectual comedy understood only by mature audiences.Everything considered, I found it to be a great DVD set. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys getting a glimpse on how one of the revolutions of the 60s was fueled to explode, the humanity of being a 'star', musicals, abstract comedy, art, fun, and the Fab Four at their finest in their first film.

385665,A1TZEF2ZMXRJTY,630382336X,Allan Tong,"[1, 1]","I have to agree that A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the Citizen Kane of rock movies.  It's funny, charming, cleverly-directed, well-scripted and beautifully shot.  Most rock movies are exploitation pieces that showcase a band on the big screen with little regard to story or design.  A HARD DAY'S NIGHT stands as a Film in its own right.What I don't like is the DVD.  It's a lousy package.  Most unforgiveable is the horrible, muddy, bass-heavy mono mix that sounds like it was produced at the bottom of a swamp.  What the hell is this?My old MPI VHS tape sounds much better than this.  The songs were in bright, beautiful stereo.  This DVD is an abomination.  Does anyone at Miramax or Apple have ears?  Does anybody care, or are these corporations just interested in ripping off Beatles fans?  Is there no respect for a great film and great music?Aside from that rant, I have mixed feelings about the extras.  We have loads of recollections from supporting actors and bit players.  These are entertaining as a whole, but the special features depend on them too much.  Where's the director's commentary -- or anybody's?  Where's the 50-minute documentary (narrated by Phil Collins) that came out on DVD in the mid-90s, called THE MAKING OF A HARD DAY'S NIGHT?I would rate this package 5 stars if it offered its customers something intelligent, but sadly this DVD smells of greed.

385672,A62G4QX6XQVLP,630382336X,Anyechka,"[3, 4]","Having not watched this film in about ten years, getting reacquainted with it recently was almost like discovering it for the very first time all over again.  The cinematography is beautiful (the early Beatles just seem to exist in black and white; it's very hard for me to picture them in color at this point in their career), the songs are terrific, the film really brings to life just what Beatlemania was like, with those hoardes of screaming young girls chasing their idols, and in spite of not having that much of a plot, the story is carried through very well by its young stars.  In spite of not having been professional actors, The Beatles just have so much charm, wit, and vibrancy in this picture, back before they became weary of so much touring and all of those screaming fans, back when it was still all new, fun, and exciting to them.  They were all so young and good-looking in this film!  And being from this early stage of their fame, one gets a genuine sense of them being almost like four brothers who care about one another and enjoy one another's company, a far cry from the tension and acrimony present in LIB.  At times it doesn't even feel like they were using a script, but that they were just ad-libbing most of it and acting like they would have in real life, four crazy, fun, and ultimately caring good young men dealing with the pressures of fame as best they could.However, this DVD release leaves a whole lot to be desired.  Disc one has a documentary of sorts, which is nothing more than a collection of interviews from people involved in the making of the film, and disc two is entirely taken up with interviews from all sorts of people who were involved in the making of the film.  While there are some genuinely nice interviewees, such as George Martin, Klaus Voorman, David Jaxon (who played the young boy), and director Richard Lester, most of them aren't from such high-profile people; indeed, some of the interviews can be rather boring, and don't give us any real new information.  Who, for example, wants to see an interview with Betty Glasow, their hairdresser, over, I don't know, an interview with an actual Beatle?  Some of the interviewees mention deleted scenes, but we're not even shown any of them.  While they're interesting to watch once, they're not something that most fans are going to want to see over and over again.  Where are actually substantial bonus features like trailers, newsreels, the making-of documentary ""You Can't Do That,"" the aforementioned deleted scenes, photo galleries, galleries of PR material, or an audio commentary?  It's inexcusable that such a wonderful and famous film gets the short end of the stick in this rereleased format.  The lacking bonus features aren't the only downside, either; the film is shown in phony widescreen, with the wrong aspect ratio, and therefore portions of the picture are cropped out.  And while I normally find excessive complaints about audio quality to be sheer pedantry, complaining about relatively minor things that normal people don't really notice or care about to such a huge degree, even I noticed that there was something a bit off about the sound, particularly when it came to the songs.  Additionally, the front cover almost looks like the cover of a bootleg.  Whatever happened to the original cover design?This is still a fun charming film after all of these years, but it really deserved better packaging and treatment.  One would be better-served searching out the original DVD release, which had better bonus features, sound, and aspect ratio, or, if one can still find it, the older CD-ROM which I feel lucky to possess, which also gives the film the respect it deserves.  How is it that such a classic rock musical gets such shabby treatment while the music videos and movies put out by modern day no-talents are treated with more care and concern?",4,"Charming film, bad DVD",1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,3879,"['Having', 'not', 'watched', 'film', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'getting', 'reacquainted', 'recently', 'was', 'almost', 'discovering', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'over', 'again', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'early', 'Beatles', 'just', 'seem', 'exist', 'black', 'white', 'very', 'hard', 'picture', 'color', 'point', 'career', 'songs', 'are', 'terrific', 'film', 'really', 'life', 'just', 'what', 'Beatlemania', 'was', 'hoardes', 'screaming', 'young', 'girls', 'chasing', 'idols', 'spite', 'not', 'having', 'much', 'plot', 'story', 'carried', 'very', 'well', 'young', 'stars', 'spite', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'professional', 'actors', 'Beatles', 'just', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'charm', 'wit', 'vibrancy', 'picture', 'back', 'became', 'weary', 'so', 'much', 'touring', 'screaming', 'fans', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'new', 'fun', 'exciting', 'were', 'so', 'young', 'good-looking', 'film', 'being', 'early', 'stage', 'fame', 'one', 'genuine', 'sense', 'being', 'almost', 'four', 'brothers', 'who', 'care', 'one', 'enjoy', 'one', 'company', 'far', 'cry', 'tension', 'acrimony', 'present', 'LIB', 'times', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'were', 'using', 'script', 'were', 'just', 'ad-libbing', 'most', 'acting', 'would', 'have', 'real', 'life', 'four', 'crazy', 'fun', 'ultimately', 'caring', 'good', 'young', 'men', 'dealing', 'pressures', 'fame', 'best', 'could.However', 'DVD', 'release', 'whole', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Disc', 'one', 'documentary', 'sorts', 'nothing', 'more', 'collection', 'interviews', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'disc', 'two', 'entirely', 'taken', 'up', 'interviews', 'sorts', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'interviewees', 'such', 'George', 'Martin', 'Klaus', 'Voorman', 'David', 'Jaxon', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'boy', 'director', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'such', 'high-profile', 'people', 'indeed', 'interviews', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'boring', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'real', 'new', 'information', 'Who', 'example', 'see', 'interview', 'Betty', 'Glasow', 'hairdresser', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'interview', 'actual', 'Beatle', 'interviewees', 'mention', 'deleted', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'shown', ""'re"", 'interesting', 'watch', 'once', ""'re"", 'not', 'something', 'most', 'fans', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'Where', 'are', 'actually', 'substantial', 'bonus', 'features', 'trailers', 'newsreels', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Do', 'aforementioned', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'photo', 'galleries', 'galleries', 'PR', 'material', 'audio', 'commentary', 'inexcusable', 'wonderful', 'famous', 'film', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'rereleased', 'format', 'lacking', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'downside', 'either', 'film', 'shown', 'phony', 'widescreen', 'wrong', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'therefore', 'portions', 'picture', 'are', 'cropped', 'out', 'normally', 'find', 'excessive', 'complaints', 'audio', 'quality', 'be', 'sheer', 'pedantry', 'complaining', 'relatively', 'minor', 'things', 'normal', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'care', 'such', 'huge', 'degree', 'even', 'noticed', 'was', 'something', 'bit', 'sound', 'particularly', 'when', 'came', 'songs', 'Additionally', 'front', 'cover', 'almost', 'cover', 'bootleg', 'happened', 'original', 'cover', 'design', 'still', 'fun', 'charming', 'film', 'years', 'really', 'deserved', 'better', 'packaging', 'treatment', 'One', 'would', 'be', 'better-served', 'searching', 'out', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'had', 'better', 'bonus', 'features', 'sound', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'older', 'CD-ROM', 'feel', 'lucky', 'possess', 'also', 'film', 'respect', 'How', 'classic', 'rock', 'musical', 'such', 'shabby', 'treatment', 'music', 'videos', 'movies', 'put', 'out', 'modern', 'day', 'no-talents', 'are', 'treated', 'more', 'care', 'concern']",N/A
385673,ARY1HPHUFJKZF,630382336X,A Thorough Reviewer,"[5, 6]","The Movie: 5 Out of 5 StarsA Hard Day's Night is timeless. There are beautiful songs and the free spirit of the 1960s. Not only is it an interesting watch for Beatles Fans, but everyone as well. It shows how free-spirited someone can be. Along the way, the Beatles encounter disapproving adults and other authority figures, who prefer not to look and act to the free-spirited way of the time. The movie is truly a great, yet simple movie.The Releases: MPI DVD vs Miramax DVDMPI-4 StarsMiramax-2 StarsA Hard Day's Night was not the movie with the highest budget. The sound was monaural originally, not stereo.  It was also shot on Academy Ratio (close to full screen), not a Widescreen Ratio. It was meant to be a kind of artsy black and white movie. When, it was released, the soundtrack was very over-modulated. This was to make everything as loud as possible (maybe so people can hear over screaming fans in the movie theater).  In other word, it was very distorted when first released in 1964.In 1982, A Hard Day's Night was released once again in theaters. This time in Dolby Stereo. This was done by taking the stereo studio versions of the song and using them to replace the original ones in the mono soundtrack. It also used a prologue of pictures of the Beatles with ""I'll Cry Instead"" playing. MPI and Criterion had various releases of a Hard Day's Night on VHS, Laserdisc, and Betamax from 1984-1995. Most releases used a certain master, possibly a copy or slight variation from the Dolby Stereo Reissue Mix; however, the earliest ones used a bettered original mono mix. It was also restored in the 90s and shown in the AMC Film Festival with the original full screen ratio and a restored mono mix. The AMC version is considered by most to be the definitive version.In the late 1990s, A Hard Day's Night was once again restored very thoroughly. The picture was restored and most cracks or specks in the film were repaired. The person who restored A Hard Day's Night wanted a better soundtrack. He deemed the original soundtrack unacceptable since it was over-modulated. He decided to use the Reissue Soundtrack. He restored it very well. However, since this used the stereo version of the songs rather than the soundtrack, when George knocked over an amplifier during ""If I Fell,"" no thud was heard. It included the 1982 Reissue Prologue and had a full screen ratio. This restoration was released as the MPI DVD. The release included some trailers and the Running, Jumping, and Standing Still Film.A Hard Day's Night was once again restored in the new millennium. This restoration used a copy of the original over-modulated soundtracks, now the thud could be heard when George knocks over the amplifier since it is the original soundtrack. During the restoration, the already over-modulated soundtrack was turned into some fake hollow 5.1 surround sound. Notice that there is no outro instruments at the end of ""A Hard Day's Night"" when the train is moving away like in the MPI Release. You just hear the crowd's commotion rather than the rather nice outro fading out slowly over it in the MPI release. The picture was restored very thoroughly and is the best quality. Due to widescreen becoming popular, the picture was reframed into widescreen, cutting off a lot of the top and bottom plus exposing some unnecessary picture on the sides. This is probably not what Richard Lester, the director, intended. This was the master used for the Miramax DVD. The release contained some very pointless interviews with people who are NOT the Beatles.",3,A Hard Day's Audio: MPI vs Miramax,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,3551,"['Movie', '5', '5', 'StarsA', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'timeless', 'are', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'free', 'spirit', '1960s', 'Not', 'only', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Beatles', 'Fans', 'everyone', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'free-spirited', 'someone', 'can', 'be', 'way', 'Beatles', 'encounter', 'disapproving', 'adults', 'other', 'authority', 'figures', 'who', 'prefer', 'not', 'look', 'act', 'free-spirited', 'way', 'time', 'movie', 'truly', 'great', 'yet', 'simple', 'movie.The', 'Releases', 'MPI', 'DVD', 'vs', 'Miramax', 'DVDMPI-4', 'StarsMiramax-2', 'StarsA', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'highest', 'budget', 'sound', 'was', 'monaural', 'originally', 'not', 'stereo', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'Academy', 'Ratio', 'close', 'full', 'screen', 'not', 'Widescreen', 'Ratio', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'kind', 'artsy', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'very', 'over-modulated', 'was', 'make', 'everything', 'as', 'loud', 'possible', 'maybe', 'so', 'people', 'can', 'hear', 'screaming', 'fans', 'movie', 'theater', 'other', 'word', 'was', 'very', 'distorted', 'when', 'first', 'released', '1964.In', '1982', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'was', 'released', 'once', 'again', 'theaters', 'time', 'Dolby', 'Stereo', 'was', 'done', 'taking', 'stereo', 'studio', 'versions', 'song', 'using', 'replace', 'original', 'ones', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'used', 'prologue', 'pictures', 'Beatles', ""'ll"", 'Cry', 'Instead', 'playing', 'MPI', 'Criterion', 'had', 'various', 'releases', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'VHS', 'Laserdisc', 'Betamax', '1984-1995', 'Most', 'releases', 'used', 'certain', 'master', 'possibly', 'copy', 'slight', 'variation', 'Dolby', 'Stereo', 'Reissue', 'Mix', 'however', 'earliest', 'ones', 'used', 'bettered', 'original', 'mono', 'mix', 'was', 'also', 'restored', '90s', 'shown', 'AMC', 'Film', 'Festival', 'original', 'full', 'screen', 'ratio', 'restored', 'mono', 'mix', 'AMC', 'version', 'considered', 'most', 'be', 'definitive', 'version.In', 'late', '1990s', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'restored', 'very', 'thoroughly', 'picture', 'was', 'restored', 'most', 'cracks', 'specks', 'film', 'were', 'repaired', 'person', 'who', 'restored', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'wanted', 'better', 'soundtrack', 'deemed', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'unacceptable', 'was', 'over-modulated', 'decided', 'use', 'Reissue', 'Soundtrack', 'restored', 'very', 'well', 'However', 'used', 'stereo', 'version', 'songs', 'rather', 'soundtrack', 'when', 'George', 'knocked', 'amplifier', 'Fell', 'thud', 'was', 'heard', 'included', '1982', 'Reissue', 'Prologue', 'had', 'full', 'screen', 'ratio', 'restoration', 'was', 'released', 'MPI', 'DVD', 'release', 'included', 'trailers', 'Running', 'Jumping', 'Standing', 'Still', 'Film.A', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'restored', 'new', 'millennium', 'restoration', 'used', 'copy', 'original', 'over-modulated', 'soundtracks', 'now', 'thud', 'could', 'be', 'heard', 'when', 'George', 'amplifier', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'restoration', 'already', 'over-modulated', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'turned', 'fake', 'hollow', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'Notice', 'outro', 'instruments', 'end', 'A', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'when', 'train', 'moving', 'away', 'MPI', 'Release', 'just', 'hear', 'crowd', 'commotion', 'rather', 'rather', 'nice', 'outro', 'fading', 'out', 'slowly', 'MPI', 'release', 'picture', 'was', 'restored', 'very', 'thoroughly', 'best', 'quality', 'Due', 'widescreen', 'becoming', 'popular', 'picture', 'was', 'reframed', 'widescreen', 'cutting', 'off', 'lot', 'top', 'bottom', 'exposing', 'unnecessary', 'picture', 'sides', 'probably', 'not', 'what', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'director', 'intended', 'was', 'master', 'used', 'Miramax', 'DVD', 'release', 'contained', 'very', 'pointless', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'NOT', 'Beatles']",N/A

A Hard Day's Night has been a part of my consciousness since I was little, but considering the Beatles' fan base is so wide and varied by age, I guess there might be some young fans who have not seen it. Whether you've never seen it or you've seen it 20 times, this is essensial viewing for Beatle fans and also people who are studying the art of film. Many famous directors sight this film as the first one they ever studied and even say it made them want to be directors. I remember studying it in college film classes. It is noted for it's quick cut away camera work, and innovative lighting.But of course I am a hard core Beatle fan so I bought this dvd because I just love it. It's their first film, and most people,( I think them included,) think it was their best. But I also like Help because it's in color and it's a beautiful film.Made in 1964, it features the Beatles at the youngest that most American people remember them.(Paul and George were barely out of their teens at this point) It is still very funny but I think the Beatles were a lot funnier when they were just being themselves in a documentry (like The Maysles Brother's The First American Visit dvd), or in interviews. The diologue is sort of contrived and even though the  screen writer traveled with them for months in order to get their speech patterns, I don't really think he was paying that much attention. I don't think he really captured them all that well. Or maybe they were too nervous to be natural. John and Paul come across as nervous and unatural. But they are still wonderful, and the music is really wonderful. This dvd has been remastered and restored of course, so it looks and sounds great.I remember when A Hard Day's Night was still being shown on tv, so I'm a veteran but you will want to own this and watch it many times.

The movie won all types of industry awards and, for us kids at the time, firmly restated what we all knew: that the Beatles were sensational.For some reason, Miramax saw fit to change out the original song soundtracks, replacing them with the record/CD versions. Apparently, Miramax has infinite wisdom.

This wave of ""Beatlemania"" was witnessed by George ""Bud"" Ornstein who worked for United Artists film company in Britain.  He thought this hysteria would be great to catch on film.  So, he asked Walter Shenson, who had a reputation for making low-budget comedies, to produce the film and Alun Owen, a British dramatist, to write the screenplay.  Together with Richard Lester directing, A Hard Day's Night captured The Beatles' individual personalities and scouse humor along with the hysteria generated by their fans over a fictitious two-day period in their lives.""The Beatles' music obviously played a major part in the film and it was introduced in a refreshingly natural way unlike the forced musical breaks in so many previous rock'n'roll films"" (""The History of The Beatles on Film"" by Bill Harry).  The Beatles were not actors.  They were performers, singers and songwriters and the music was used to stress that point.  The music was an added attraction next to seeing The Beatles in their first film.  The music did nothing to move the plot, in fact in most cases, it had nothing to do with the plot (if there was one).  However, were it not for the musical interludes, it would have been a wasted movie.  The songs in the movie showed an outburst of humor (""Can't Buy Me Love"" played while The Beatles run rampant in a field), the fast pace of the film (""A Hard Day's Night"" - played while The Beatles are being chased through a train station by their adoring fans), and a rehearsal number for the show (""And I Love Her"").  The climax of the film is The Beatles' performance in front of a live audience for a television show.  A medley of their songs was featured that included ""If I Fell"" and ""Tell Me Why"" and one of their biggest hits, ""She Loves You"" ended the concert.  Each song was placed in the film in a way that it didn't have to be set up and was naturally eased into without any long breaks before the song starts or any waiting such as setting up the band.  There are also no leads playing before the song starts.  The audience is unaware of what song will be next or when one will appear.Released in England on August 2, 1964 and in America on August 12, 1964, A Hard Day's Night was praised by critics and fans alike.  Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice called the film ""... the Citizen Kane of Juke Box musicals"" and The Daily Mirror critic, not a Beatles fan, said that they were ""cheeky, irreverent, funny, irresistible"" as quoted in ""Billboard's Book of Number One Hits"" by Fred Bronson.  This film introduced the world to The Beatles (since their popularity and phenomenon was just beginning).  The film grossed  million in its first release, was nominated for two academy awards and was released in different countries and translated into different languages.I love this film (because, of course, I'm a huge Beatles fan).  I found this film to be amusing (it's amazing that none of the lines were ad-libbed) and enjoyable.  Most critics felt that Ringo's performance stood out from the rest and stole the show, but I feel that John's performance and lines were better (and I am more of a fan of Ringo than John).  Overall, the film kept me moving (with its fast pace) and anxiously awaiting for the next song to appear or what type of amusing remark each Beatle would say next.As Paul McCartney said in an interview in 1984 (as quoted in ""Billboard's Book of Number One Hits"" by Fred Bronson) ""I hate to say it, but when you see the girls in their mini-skirts and white floppy hats it does look dated.

This black and white, loosely structured film is a lot of fun. Shot and edited in an extremely short period of time, it seems to have benefited from being put in the can before anyone could fuss over it too much and leach it of its playfulness and originality. Unlike Dylan and Baez in DON'T LOOK BACK, the Beatles were playing characters, not trying to project their own PR images. And they seemed to enjoy doing so. While the Swingin' England costumes, hairstyles, and backdrop makes you wish someone had put up the pounds for color film, the b&w; camera work evokes the other great b&w; films of that era: Darling, Alfie, Georgie Girl, to name a few. What I found most amusing was how polite the Beatles were to the adults in the movie (George actually apologizes to a sports coach for running around on his ""private property."") There are no clues that I could detect of the role these four baby-faced musicians would have in the counter-culture movement of the next half decade.The music is great, of course...but the songs were either shorter than I remembered, or have been edited down somewhat. It would have been nice if the second DVD had some outtakes (maybe they used every frame they shot) or news footage from the time. Instead, it contains countless interviews with just about everyone connected to the film. Interesting reminiscences, but enough is enough.

385688,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,630382336X,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 8]","It was many years ago that I first saw the Beatles' 1964 debut black and white film, A Hard Day's Night, on PBS. It had to have been during the 1980s, possibly during a pledge drive. Given that I was not a Beatles fan growing up, I didn't think much of the film, however, perhaps this was my bias, the wan rift of memory, plus the fact that I have become a much more acute critic of all things, including cinema, clouding my memory. Then, a couple of years ago I watched the band's second film Help! It, too, was not a good film. In fact, it was quite a bad film. However, most critics state that the second film was not as good as the first, and this includes Roger Ebert and virtually every other online critic for, according to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 100% rating in terms of favorability.Yet, the truth is, if Help! is, as I describe it, a `bad' film, its 87 minute long predecessor is a flat out terrible film. That anyone would find this appallingly poorly executed, unfunny, hodgepodge of ill acted swill remotely entertaining is a testament to the depths human enjoyment can plunge. Yes, the songs from the bands' early era are good, but there isn't a single joke told in this film that garners even a mild teehee. That some critics suggest this film is equal to the great classic comedies of the Marx Brothers shows how addled some minds truly are. While it's true that, as Ebert suggests, this film had a profound influence on the music video industry that arose in the 1980s, it's had a negligible impact on film, itself. Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, and Ingmar Bergman, among others, were already far more visually sophisticated and daring than anything director Richard Lester tossed into this film, along with cinematographer Gilbert Taylor. In fact, despite Ebert's claims that the film is `strikingly original,' the very opposite is true- it is derivative to the core (think Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, the Marx Brothers, the Ritz Brothers, the Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, the Bowery Boys- need I continue?); so, unless one wants to claim that being almost wholly and shamelessly derivative is perversely a `strikingly original' thing to be, Ebert's statement is doomed to go down as one of the greatest examples of his tendency to cinematically brain fart. The screenplay, by Alun Owen, is simply abominable. The film consists solely of songs with a few poor comic tidbits in between. These tidbits consist of the boys running away from female fans, engaging in pseudo-blue banter with Paul McCartney's supposed `other' grandfather, a man who seemingly undermines and embarrasses the boys at every opportunity, and arguing over petty matters with their band manager. The film ends with the boys titillating a television studio full of screaming young females.Several things are apparent in this film: 1) it was designed merely as a moneymaking venture for, despite the brain dead criticism this film is utterly void of any real art, 2) the Beatles simply cannot act and their films, it seems, started their later slide into musical pretension, and 3) the Monkees'- television's Prefab 4 response to Beatlemania were almost infinitely better actors. In fact, their acting range was probably farther beyond the Beatles' than the Beatles' actual musical canon was above theirs, for the Monkees actually were good at improv; the Beatles weren't. And, the film is actually at its best during seeming improves. The clearly scripted moments, which seem less like even a first draft but a first premise, and which have the boys interacting with real actors is excruciatingly painful to watch and hear, as jokes that are decades old, even then, are told with a manic glee that somehow, if a teen heartthrob tells them they will magically regain their humor. One wonders why both of the band's first two films are so poorly made and the answer is rather obvious: producers rushed them through production for fear that the Beatles' popularity would fade and that the Rolling Stones, or some yet discovered group would make them pass&eacute; before the films were released.The real test of the film's cinematic worth, however, comes from a simple test: if the film had been on a fictive band, made up of actors, singing Beatles songs, would the critics have trumpeted it so?

385690,A2P49WD75WHAG5,630382336X,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[4, 5]","History was born with the opening chord of the Beatles' first movie.  As the title track is playing, hordes of screaming young girls chase the Beatles through the train station, cutting back and forth to a man's attempts to open a milk carton, Paul and his grandfather calmly waiting the storm out, and finally all the Beatles escaping aboard the train.The musical numbers demonstrate spontaneity of bursting into song ""I Should Have Known Better"" and ""I'm Happy Just To Dance With You.""  They are just plain enjoying themselves.  And ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" featuring their antics on the grass pitch, can be construed as the first ever music video.  The aerial camera angles, the guys clowning around, and the speeded up camera shots add to the fun.  ""And I Love Her"" is highlighted by the light effect around Paul's face at the end of the number.  First, half his face is shaded, the other in light.  The camera swings to a profile shot, first flooding his face so it can't be seen, then fading to a thin corona, making an eclipse effect.  Great cinematography work there.The press conference has Paul's repeated answers:  ""No, we're just good friends,"" plus John's witty remark to how they found America:  ""Turn left at Greenland.""Ringo's misadventures when he goes out parading is also of worthy mention.  and even establishes a brief but good rapport with Charlie, the boy who's playing hookie from school.  The scene in the cafe is good as well.George has a great moment in a scene demonstrating how mass marketing and teen trends are set.  I kind of wonder if this is how things still work today.Other great moments:  a Keystone cops-inspired chase scene, the carjacker, George showing Shake how to shave, John playing in the bath--believe me, there are so many scenes worth mentioning it'd be impossible to list them all--the movie's THAT good.Of the two schoolgirls in the train, the blonde is Patty Boyd, later to be George Harrison's first wife, later to marry Eric Clapton.  David Langton, the actor in the dressing room reacting to John's long beard, is best known as Lord Bellamy in Upstairs Downstairs.  Lionel Blair, the choreographer of the ""Tell Me Why"" dance routine, appeared in Absolute Beginners as Harry Charms.  Richard Vernon, the stuffy newspaper reading man aboard the train, had many roles in TV, including Yes Minister.  And the tall gangly man jumping up and down in the club with Ringo is Jeremy Lloyd, one of the co-creators of Are You Being Served? (!)Other supporting characters include Norm, as their bossy, height-challenged PR man who's fighting a war of nerves with John, and Shake, his towering but unassertive assistant on whom he takes out his frustrations.  Shake tells him, ""John hasn't got any [nerves]""  Norm:  ""That's just the trouble.""But let's not forget Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's ""clean"" grandfather, who's got a wily look in his eye.  He's an instigator, all right, stirring things up, ""a mixer,"" as Paul calls him.  The scene where he gets more chips after he goes broke at the gambling club shows how foxy he can be.  He successful stirs up Ringo, nearly sabotaging the live performance.The final music montage featuring ""Tell Me Why,"" ""If I Fell,"" ""I Should've Known Better,"" and ""She Loves You"" demonstrates the triumph of the Beatles.  And look at the hysterical to love-stricken faces of their feminine audience!  What an effect they had on their fans!The rock movie would not have been possible without this day in the life of the Beatles movie.  This also shows the band in their early days, when they were fresh, getting along with each other.

It was made by Richard Lester, who, along with fellow American Joseph Losey, was the best director of British movies in the 1960s, and who gives the film a thrilling jump-cut, black and white immediacy.2. It is truly Surreal, not just in gags like the fab four running alongside a moving train, or in John Lennon's backstage chat with a woman that sees his identity obliterated; but in the way the Beatles as an entity transform banal reality - hotels, canteens etc. - into something magical and new by their presence.3. Because it celebrates being in a gang - with all their games, jokes, one-liners, private language, four mumbling individuals achieve a sublime group eloquence: when they are seperated, their identities are endangered and undermined. The scene in which a deserting Ringo meets a young boy, another exile from a gang, is the key to the film's heart. The Beatles are like four boys, on the run from their 'parents' who keep wanting them to behave and do their homework (e.g. staying in to reply to fanmail).4. For capturing a moment in history, when fusty old Imperial England (in the shape of the Bowler Hat man) gave way to the Swinging Sixties. Sacred cows, such as the Queen and the war, are routinely mocked, usually in John's bath. An ex-IRA man becomes a peer, a car-thief chauffeurs the police.

Many of the reviewers have spoken of the terrible sound, and they are correct.  I guess this is what one must expect when people in love with technology approach a work of art.  The supposedly enhanced sound ruins the movie.  I have watched only a few minutes of this DVD, and I will never watch it again, even though A Hard Day's Night is one of my favorite movies.  I should probably study this fiasco a little more before writing this review to verify what I'm going to say, but I'm so disgusted that I can't wait.  Although I have read 30 or 40 of the reviews here, I haven't seen a couple of particular complaints mentioned.  My apologies if someone has already written about them.  In the performance of &quot;If I Fell,&quot; I believe the released recording has replaced the &quot;live&quot; version the Beatles recorded for the movie.  To synchronize the video with the sound, Miramax has slowed down the latter!  The music is about a half-step off.  Later, during the big TV performance toward the end of the movie, the producers have removed the ambient sound, so one gets no sense of the audience's wild excitement.  Because I couldn't watch any more than this, I'm probably missing many other transgressions.  I can't imagine what Miramax was thinking when they released this.

The Beatles, smarter than that, did not want to make an ""Elvis"" movie.  They were in it for the long run and were looking at their legacy.  They contracted a top British playwright, Allen Owun, and hired a gifted director of comedies, Richard Lester, to craft what is probably the greatest rock 'n' roll movie and arguably one of the great screen comedies.  In addition, contributions are made by a great cast of British comics (Wilfred Brambell, Norm Rossington, Victor Spinetti).  With all these parts in place the question was whether could the Beatles themselves translate their lovable persona to the big screen.  The answer is a resounding yes!!!  Ostensibly, the story concerns the Beatles preparing for a television appearance in London while trying to simultaneously reign in Paul's mischievious grandfather.  Really, the film is about the Beatles mocking their own persona and Beatlemania in particular.  And what would the film be without great music.  The Beatles crafted a great new set of classic songs specifically for this film.  This film is still great forty years on so the Beatles obtained their objective.

385713,A29QA79VLQGHY6,630382336X,Flipper Campbell,"[0, 2]","""A Hard Day's Night"" makes most critics' best-ever lists. It's widely considered an electrifying mix of great music and hip comedy, both a time capsule of the swinging '60s and a timeless entertainment. Roger Ebert calls it ""one of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies.""Respect hasn't led to respectful treatment. Legal wrangling followed ""A Hard Day's Night"" throughout its home video life, resulting in oddities like the ""tribute to John Lennon"" musical prologue tacked on for VHS. The first DVD version, from MPI in 1997, disappeared after a few months of distribution.Here, finally, is an up-to-date rendition worthy of the film.""A Hard Day's Night"" looks and sounds about as good as could be expected. The carefully lit black-and-white images should please most viewers -- even though they're on the flat side, with persistent minor speckling. The stereophonic songs swing as they must, smoking the tracks on Capitol's (shamefully outdated) soundtrack CD. (The MPI video had significantly worse sound but deeper contrasts.) Try this: Put on the Capitol version of ""Tell Me Why"" and then play the movie version. Perhaps Capitol can tell us why they continue to sell 15 year old Beatles CDs.The film, shot in 35mm, is presented in widescreen, letterboxed with a ratio of about 1.66:1, enhanced for 16x9 televisions. The spiffed-up audio comes via Dolby Digital, with the musical numbers in stereo.The first disc contains the movie as well as ""Things They Said Today,"" a new promo film that gives the big picture. The second disc is all interviews, arranged by category (cast, crew, etc.).Martin Lewis, a Beatles historian and pal to most of the filmmakers, conducted 30 video interviews for the package. They include key players -- Martin, director Richard Lester, United Artists exec David Picker, cinematographer Gilbert Taylor (""Star Wars"") and Beatles publicist Tony Barrow -- as well as those who were just lucky to find themselves working on a film project ""at the center of the universe.""The reminiscences get infusions of energy from upbeat clips, some amplifying the talkers' points and others making Beatle-esque visual jokes. The production was extensively filmed and photographed, with hours of that material first seen in this collection. The interviews are tightly edited, surprisingly focused and often a great deal of fun. It becomes clear that contributing to the film profoundly changed the lives of most of these people.",5,Fab -- A very clean old movie,1032825600,"09 24, 2002",2002,2454,"['Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'most', 'critics', 'best-ever', 'lists', 'widely', 'considered', 'electrifying', 'mix', 'great', 'music', 'hip', 'comedy', 'time', 'capsule', 'swinging', ""'60s"", 'timeless', 'entertainment', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'one', 'great', 'life-affirming', 'landmarks', 'movies', 'Respect', ""n't"", 'led', 'respectful', 'treatment', 'Legal', 'wrangling', 'followed', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'home', 'video', 'life', 'resulting', 'oddities', 'tribute', 'John', 'Lennon', 'musical', 'prologue', 'tacked', 'VHS', 'first', 'DVD', 'version', 'MPI', '1997', 'disappeared', 'few', 'months', 'distribution.Here', 'finally', 'up-to-date', 'rendition', 'worthy', 'film', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'carefully', 'lit', 'black-and-white', 'images', 'should', 'please', 'most', 'viewers', 'even', ""'re"", 'flat', 'side', 'persistent', 'minor', 'speckling', 'stereophonic', 'songs', 'swing', 'must', 'smoking', 'tracks', 'Capitol', 'shamefully', 'outdated', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'MPI', 'video', 'had', 'significantly', 'worse', 'sound', 'deeper', 'contrasts', 'Try', 'Put', 'Capitol', 'version', 'Tell', 'Me', 'Why', 'then', 'play', 'movie', 'version', 'Perhaps', 'Capitol', 'can', 'tell', 'why', 'continue', 'sell', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Beatles', 'CDs.The', 'film', 'shot', '35mm', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'letterboxed', 'ratio', 'about', '1.66:1', 'enhanced', '16x9', 'televisions', 'spiffed-up', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'musical', 'numbers', 'stereo.The', 'first', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Things', 'Said', 'Today', 'new', 'promo', 'film', 'big', 'picture', 'second', 'disc', 'interviews', 'arranged', 'category', 'cast', 'crew', 'etc', '.Martin', 'Lewis', 'Beatles', 'historian', 'pal', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'conducted', '30', 'video', 'interviews', 'package', 'include', 'key', 'players', 'Martin', 'director', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'United', 'Artists', 'exec', 'David', 'Picker', 'cinematographer', 'Gilbert', 'Taylor', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Beatles', 'publicist', 'Tony', 'Barrow', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'lucky', 'find', 'working', 'film', 'project', 'center', 'universe', 'reminiscences', 'get', 'infusions', 'energy', 'upbeat', 'clips', 'amplifying', 'talkers', 'points', 'others', 'making', 'Beatle-esque', 'visual', 'jokes', 'production', 'was', 'extensively', 'filmed', 'photographed', 'hours', 'material', 'first', 'seen', 'collection', 'interviews', 'are', 'tightly', 'edited', 'surprisingly', 'focused', 'often', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'clear', 'contributing', 'film', 'profoundly', 'changed', 'lives', 'most', 'people']",N/A

385718,AY12DBB0U420B,630382336X,Gary Peterson,"[3, 4]","It was around 1964 and I was a popular music fan and I was just as thrilled with the appearance of the Beatles on the music scene as anyone else. My friend Nate loved classical music and always carried around with him a little portable radio so he could listen to the local classical station. I'd chide Nate a bit and tell him he ought to listen to pop music more and he'd laugh about it. I always used the Beatles as an example of popular music, but he'd never heard them or heard of them (almost hard to believe at the time). One night we were in a tavern enjoying a pitcher of beer and I kept playing Beatles' music for him on the juke box. Much to my amazement, he liked it. Well, A Hard Day's Night had just started a first-run playing at the local theaters and I convinced Nate we ought to go see it. So there were Nate and I sitting in a theater packed with screaming teenagers (we were late 20s) and watching A Hard Day's Night.The movie was highly spoken of by a great majority of movie critics, but everything the Beatles did or said was highly praised in those days. Personally, I didn't enjoy the movie all that much, although it was fun to see the reactions of those days and to see the Beatles perform their songs. The reaction in  the theater we were in could only be described as ecstatic enthusiasm. Actually, the movie was hard to understand because of all the screaming.Well, it's been a long time but I've remembered it well and not too long ago I commemorated the event by buying the ""A Hard Day's Night"" CD. I watched it and the accompanying ""extra"" materials over the last two nights. My reaction to the movie was just about the same as with my original viewing. It was interesting to see the events of those long ago days as they were documented. Surely, the Beatles reaction was a form of mass hysteria. Just amazing! It was also good to see the Beatles performing in their youth, and I've always loved their music, without question. The movie itself was a hodge-podge of home movies, TV spots, photographs, acted scenes, and what not all. It seemed to have little organization. The sound on my stereo system was poor, at best. The video quality was generally poor. The acting would be bad for a B movie. The joking was stale and unfunny. The ""clean old man"" joke grew evermore wearysome. A lot of the Beatles performances looked as if they were lip synced. I fail to see how the critics rated it so highly, perhaps this to was also a form of mass hysteria. In any case, I enjoyed re-watching it, but it seemed long and drawn out and I was glad when it was finally over. Evidently, the entire movie was produced in a couple month's time and. quite frankly, that's what it looks like.A second disc was included and carried commentary from those who were associated with the movie in one way or another. I found some of the comments interesting, but after watching for over an hour, I just couldn't go on to the finish. It's hard to advise potential viewers on this matter. If you're really, really a Beatles fan, then, of course, you must have it. If you're buying it to watch a good movie, well, I think you're going to be disappointed. Perhaps not. Personally, I like Beatles' music and I have many discs. Would I buy this disc over again given the chance? I think not.Gary Peterson",4,Of Historical Significance.,1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,3308,"['was', '1964', 'was', 'popular', 'music', 'fan', 'was', 'just', 'thrilled', 'appearance', 'Beatles', 'music', 'scene', 'anyone', 'else', 'My', 'friend', 'Nate', 'loved', 'classical', 'music', 'always', 'carried', 'little', 'portable', 'radio', 'could', 'listen', 'local', 'classical', 'station', ""'d"", 'chide', 'Nate', 'bit', 'tell', 'ought', 'listen', 'pop', 'music', 'more', ""'d"", 'laugh', 'always', 'used', 'Beatles', 'example', 'popular', 'music', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'heard', 'almost', 'hard', 'believe', 'time', 'One', 'night', 'were', 'tavern', 'enjoying', 'pitcher', 'beer', 'kept', 'playing', 'Beatles', 'music', 'juke', 'box', 'Much', 'amazement', 'liked', 'Well', 'A', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'had', 'just', 'started', 'first-run', 'playing', 'local', 'theaters', 'convinced', 'Nate', 'ought', 'go', 'see', 'So', 'were', 'Nate', 'sitting', 'theater', 'packed', 'screaming', 'teenagers', 'were', 'late', '20s', 'watching', 'A', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night.The', 'movie', 'was', 'highly', 'spoken', 'great', 'majority', 'movie', 'critics', 'everything', 'Beatles', 'did', 'said', 'was', 'highly', 'praised', 'days', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'that', 'much', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'reactions', 'days', 'see', 'Beatles', 'perform', 'songs', 'reaction', 'theater', 'were', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'ecstatic', 'enthusiasm', 'Actually', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'understand', 'screaming.Well', 'been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'remembered', 'well', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'commemorated', 'event', 'buying', 'A', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'CD', 'watched', 'accompanying', 'extra', 'materials', 'last', 'two', 'nights', 'reaction', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'same', 'original', 'viewing', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'events', 'long', 'ago', 'days', 'were', 'documented', 'Surely', 'Beatles', 'reaction', 'was', 'form', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'Just', 'amazing', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'Beatles', 'performing', 'youth', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'music', 'question', 'movie', 'was', 'hodge-podge', 'home', 'movies', 'TV', 'spots', 'photographs', 'acted', 'scenes', 'what', 'not', 'seemed', 'have', 'little', 'organization', 'sound', 'stereo', 'system', 'was', 'poor', 'best', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'generally', 'poor', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'B', 'movie', 'joking', 'was', 'stale', 'unfunny', 'clean', 'old', 'man', 'joke', 'grew', 'evermore', 'wearysome', 'lot', 'Beatles', 'performances', 'looked', 'were', 'lip', 'synced', 'fail', 'see', 'how', 'critics', 'rated', 'so', 'highly', 'perhaps', 'was', 'also', 'form', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'case', 'enjoyed', 're-watching', 'seemed', 'long', 'drawn', 'was', 'glad', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'Evidently', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'couple', 'month', 'time', 'quite', 'frankly', 'what', 'like.A', 'second', 'disc', 'was', 'included', 'carried', 'commentary', 'who', 'were', 'associated', 'movie', 'one', 'way', 'found', 'comments', 'interesting', 'watching', 'hour', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'finish', 'hard', 'advise', 'potential', 'viewers', 'matter', ""'re"", 'really', 'really', 'Beatles', 'fan', 'then', 'course', 'must', 'have', ""'re"", 'buying', 'watch', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'Personally', 'like', 'Beatles', 'music', 'have', 'many', 'discs', 'Would', 'buy', 'disc', 'again', 'given', 'chance', 'think', 'not.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A
385719,A3MT0YM4LU0AT2,630382336X,G. HOLMES,"[2, 6]","In the 1950's, British working class kids were looking around for something new and original.  Was it ever thus?  The Blue Collar classes had the Music Halls and Variety, and were satisfied with that.  Probably because they were happy to have survived WW2, and already had had enough excitement to last a lifetime.  The younger generation though, not having much if any recollection of the war wanted to find something fresh and novel to bring meaning to their boring, hum-drum lives.  All the best stuff seemed to be coming from across the Atlantic.  The movies, the Jazz, the Blues, and the Swing Orchestra's - and also this new stuff called Rock and Roll.  And what about that alarming young man who sings and moves in such a provocative manner called,ermmm - Elvis something or other?  All over Britain the kids enthused over this stuff.  They tried to copy and recreate these performers and their music, for a domestic audience because the demand was insatiable.  Unbelievably, there were no proper venues anywhere in Britain to entertain a mass audience like a rock concert for example.  Elvis never came to Britain to perform through his whole career for this reason - according to the Colonel...  There was also a great deal of prejudice from the older generation who just did not like this crazy music scene at all; and boys with long, untrimmed hair were an absolute disgrace!  Britain produced its own Rock & Roll stars like Lonnie Donegan, Billy Fury, Marty Wilde, Frankie Vaughn, Tommy Steele, Cliff Richard to name a few who were really nothing more than Brits trying to be American on stage.  However authentically American they tried to be, they just sounded sort of - British!  Few of these artists made any impression in America that I can remember.  When the Beatles burst onto the scene in that extraordinary year of 1963 they were a marvel.  I was only about 15 and got completely carried away with the whole Beatle-mania circus.  I ache with nostalgia for those heady times when I look back now that I am well into my 60's and approaching retirement.When the Beatles made their first tour of America in February 1964 the feeling here was they probably wouldn't catch on in an America still mourning the tragic loss of JFK just a few months earlier.  Would they really like and appreciate a bunch of `Limey' kids bringing their music back home to them?  I thought that Americans would probably ignore them at worse or tolerated their presence at best.  It is difficult to explain to younger people today how poor international communications were in those far off days.  News took a day or two to circulate as satellite telecoms were in their infancy and needed a special effort to set up.  It took me nearly a week to find out how the Beatles had gone down in New York.  I can remember listening to a broadcast from New York on short wave radio about the Beatles driving down Broadway in separate limousines.  If it hadn't been for a BBC radio show called ""Saturday Club"", hosted by the great Brian Matthew, I really don't thing I would have heard anything at all. We Beatles fans feared that they had completely bombed and had become a national embarrassment.  Gradually, the news hit that far from being a dismal failure - they had created a sensation!  I noticed that many, many people I met over here at the time were simply gobsmacked and open-mouthed with wonder about the Beatles' amazing reception.This glorious film, ""A Hard Day's Night"", gives a modern viewer a taste of British Beatle mania.  To me it is a treasure trove of nostalgia from a rather worn out and rather shabby England that was gradually coming out of its post-war gloom.  An England that was beginning to stir and to re-awaken, and we the younger generation had to prove to ourselves that we really did have something to offer the world.  An ancient, anachronistic country, weighed down by its long history.  Exhausted by war and its aftermath, deeply in debt; no longer a first-rate power.  Great Britain was finished - and the future was to be American!  What was to happen next has become - well, a sort of a legend.  ""A Hard Day's Night ""captures a brief moment of time that became a fulcrum in my own life's experience, when things were never to be quite the same again.  It is a documentary as much as it is a film.  But whatever - it is smashing entertainment; but 'tis a pity that such an important film has been given such a poor rendition for a presentation on Blu-ray. Hence the measly four stars.

I have to turn my volume level twice as loud as on other DVDs to even get a listenable level.  But that's only the start.  It is in MONO, for God's sake!  And that's not all...there is NO dynamic range, no depth to the sound, no quality in the midrange or high end, and a low end that is boomy and without definition.  I could get a better sound by setting up an old Radio Shack microphone in a garage..sadly, that is not a joke.  But this DVD is.  I am going to write Miramax and demand to know what happened.

Then I watched it again. The picture is wonderful, but the musical sound, as others have noted, is particularly poor at times. It does not seem to blend in to the movie, it seems to stand out in some kind of sterile, sonic relief from the actual film. A very bad sounding echo is added to the TV show scenes, and the sound on She Loves You becomes abruptly, bafflingly muffled and muddy. Very disappointing. Why mess with perfection?  I also agree with another person who felt that the visual presentation of the package was poor. Right on--why not stay with some version of the original graphics, which were simple, brilliant, and familiar. This box is sterile-looking and has no resonance with any other visual iconcography associated with the film. Some stupid decisions were made here.... That being said, the movie is still brilliant, still fun, and still exciting to watch. The style is as original as the Beatles themselves. There is plenty of social commentary, and enough thematic &amp; visual motifs to keep the film students working hard. Maybe Miramax will wise up and reissue this in a more reverent fashion.

Whether being chased by screaming fans, running around a field, or trying to curb the antics of Paul's puckish &quot;grandfather&quot; this film is full of energy.  There's not much of a plot, so to speak, really just the Beatles preparing for a television appearance, but the skits strung together form a cohesive whole.  The camera loves them, and they exude great chemistry together.  There are some individual bits as well, such as John talking with the woman in the hallway, George in the marketing execs office and especially Ringo's camera adventure, that work very effectively.The song performances are slightly different from the released versions, with a live feel, although the track is sometimes not quite in sync with the actors.The opener features the title song, and the Beatles running all around London trying to escape legions of female funs, an echo to the Beatlemania of the day.  The &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; performance on the train features a young Patti Boyd, later George's wife.  My favorite is &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; with the Beatles escaping the studio for a romp in a huge open space.  The camera work in this sequence, from the aerial shots to the slow motion/speed up served as the basis for the music video art form that become popular in the 1980s.There's also a making of featurette after than with some interesting background.Great buy.

And the Beatles are such a myth. This film reveals the fabric the myth is made of. Pure cinematographic and even photographic silk. The four boys have to be running because at the time everything young and new was on the run since it was chased by the establishment in order to be pilloried and exposed. But it also had to show how these four young men had to be able to capture the attention of other people and bring them into the running, first of all young people, particularly girls, and second the best representatives of the establishment, coppers. The film also had to be in black and white to be out of time, eternal because looking old, even odd or oddly even. Then and but their music did not have to convince their audience. It was new, fresh, lively, light, slightly rocky and rather smoothly rolly, with some drums but not too much, and a lot of harmony and melody, but the main attraction was the use of simple catch phrases to express love, freedom, desire, alienation and yet liberation in a mellow and sweet wrapping, like the cute title of the film taken from one of the songs.  Finally the film had to satisfy the audience on the lifestyle of the Beatles and on their surrealistic reality. That is done with a plot based on their real life as musicians, etc, and at the same time with constant reference to impossible, at times absurd, breaches in this realism into some impossible meaningless or humoristic pranks.

Seen in the 21st century, the movie's a bit creaky; but it's still obvious that all a filmmaker had to do was point a camera at John, Paul, George and Ringo, and the magic took over.There's no point in iterating this lightweight plot, because the style of the film so far outweighs it, the viewer comes away with more images than story.  This was the seminal exploration of herky-jerky, artsy filmmaking based on a highly accessible subject (the Beatles), and it's fascinating as a work of filmic art.

Instead, it turned out to be the precursor to MTV and music videos, shows what made the Beatles so much fun and manages to play a few of their great tunes at the same time.  The plot is minimal, consisting of the Beatles entourage getting the Beatles to a live television show on which the Beatles are to perform.  Nearly from the beginning to the end, the Beatles are chased by pimple faced young teens, the police, their handlers, and everyone else.  And throughout the film, Paul's grandfather, played by William Brambell (a very clean old man), keeps stirring up problems.The nominal plot allows the Beatles natural likeability to shine.  This film established the personas of the individual Beatles (as portrayed to the media) -- Paul -- straightforward and good natured, John -- incessantly sarcastic, George -- subtle with a dry sense of humor,  and Ringo -- quiet, shy and introspective.  The movie is irreverent, inventive, funny, droll, deadpan, filled with non-stop movement, and some great, if dated, rock-n-roll!  It is a wonderful film showing the exuberance of youth, the innocence of an earlier time, and Beatlemania in all its glory!The DVD's extras include interviews with about everyone still living who participated in the film except the surviving Beatles.

A Hard Day's Night is purportedly a busy-day-in-the-life of the Fabs as they make their way to London to appear on a TV show, with hilarious consequences.  Screenwriter Alun Owen gives the boys a very good foundation, and the allegedly ""broad stokes"" he took to portray them (sarcastic John, charming Paul, sardonic George, put-upon Ringo) IMHO seem unforced and inoffensive.  It's characterization, that's all, and in the early days the Beatles did look very much alike, so the ""broad strokes"" aren't so much exaggeration as helpful to the odd viewer who doesn't know the Beatles that well.What really gives the movie its kick is the boys' genuine, broadly-smiling enjoyment at what they're doing (especially during the numbers ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" and the reprise of ""I Should Have Known Better"", where the usually sullen George for no apparent reason suddenly breaks into a silly little dance while playing his guitar).  Director Lester captures the boys at all the right moments in many exceptionally well-lit and well-set-up shots during the songs.  Basically he sets out to make the Beatles photograph as attractively as possible, and he succeeds.  The Beatles had a remarkably photogenic, bisexual sort of appeal, most notably in their early days, as captured so well here.The later Beatles movies, Help, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be all have moments of brilliance, but Hard Day's Night is by far the strongest, most accessible, most likable and polished of the lot.  Funny, beautifully shot, extremely well-edited, all these years later Hard Day's Night has lost none of its power to set your toes tapping, your body grooving, and just leaving you feeling immensely better in general.

Except for that minor gripe, this is a highly recommended ultimate version of a classic movie.  Although of course there is a storyline, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT plays more like an irreverent, art-exaggerates-life documentary, balancing timeless music with fast-paced, witty off-stage interplay that hasn't grown stale with the passage of decades.I noticed that the 5.1 mix is used only for the music; the dialogue portions are center-speaker only (the audio transitions are smooth, though).  I suppose some will quibble that because of this you are no longer watching the original theatrical release, but it adds dramatic effect to go from mono to 5.1 for the music, so I'd consider it an improvement.  There is an excellent documentary to fill out disc one; disc two is full of interviews--albeit not with any Beatles--that provide interesting anecdotes, but will probably not warrant many repeat viewings except by Beatle fans (but since you are getting two DVDs for the price of one, think of it as a free bonus disc).",5,Deluxe DVD version of a classic motion picture...,1033257600,"09 29, 2002",2002,1149,"['agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'least', 'why', 'not', 'more', 'durable', 'plastic', 'slipcase', 'minor', 'gripe', 'highly', 'recommended', 'ultimate', 'version', 'classic', 'movie', 'course', 'storyline', 'HARD', 'DAY', 'NIGHT', 'more', 'irreverent', 'art-exaggerates-life', 'documentary', 'balancing', 'timeless', 'music', 'fast-paced', 'witty', 'off-stage', 'interplay', ""n't"", 'grown', 'stale', 'passage', 'decades.I', 'noticed', '5.1', 'mix', 'used', 'only', 'music', 'dialogue', 'portions', 'are', 'center-speaker', 'only', 'audio', 'transitions', 'are', 'smooth', 'though', 'suppose', 'will', 'quibble', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'watching', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'go', 'mono', '5.1', 'music', ""'d"", 'consider', 'improvement', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'fill', 'out', 'disc', 'one', 'disc', 'two', 'full', 'interviews', 'not', 'Beatles', 'provide', 'interesting', 'anecdotes', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'warrant', 'many', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'Beatle', 'fans', 'are', 'getting', 'two', 'DVDs', 'price', 'one', 'think', 'free', 'bonus', 'disc']",N/A
385740,A3UQQ6WYJ4EDQ1,630382336X,Joey D,"[14, 16]","&quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; represents the very height of BEATLEMANIA, a wonderful heady time of possibilities yet to be explored and the jubilation of Rock n Roll in general. I saw this at my local movie theater in 1964, after braving a line that ran the length of a very long Brooklyn block (unheard of for this third run theater). And remember this was in the day of the double features. The decible level inside the theater during the show was unbelievable, and the sound from the screen was pretty loud too. Non stop screaming, shouting, and singing that made most of the dialogue incomprehnsible. It wasn't until the film played on television years later that I discovered what a funny film this was. In contrast, when HELP debuted a year later, the second run theater I saw it in was packed, but quiet and attentive. The hysteria of BEATLEMANIA was over, and while it was a relief to be able to hear the movie, the excitement of the pandemonium was sorely missed. But on this day in 1964 my local theater became a real Beatle concert-going experience. The fact that my older sister got hit in the head with some girl's tossed shoe, and that it provoked laughter instead of the expected anger really brought home the fact that this was indeed something special. But its what happened after the film was over that has stayed with me all these years over any other movie going experience. After all this pumped up energy  The Beatles had produced on came the second feature. I don't remember the name of it, but I do remember it was in color and the first shot was a close-up of a lily pad that silently floated on a lake for what seemed like five full minutes. Well that was it. This Brooklyn crowd went nuts &quot;We Want Te Beatles! We Want The BEATLES! WE WANT THE BEATLES! WE WANT THE BEATLES! Over and over. Being the most seasoned 9 year old movie goer in film history, this was one thing I knew was never going to happen. I remember thinking how smart the theater owner was to book this film, whatever it was. It was obvious to me that this film wasn't being shown to enhance the pleaure of the previous film, or compliment it. It was designed to empty the whole theater, so that nobody would hang around and see The Beatles again (there was another line stretching down the block waiting to get in). But the audience wouldn't stop. WE WANT THE BEATLES! WE WANT THE BEATLES!I just shook my head.  WE WANT THE BEATLES! WE WANT THE BEATLES!  Then  something  happened. The 2nd feature stopped leaving a blank screen up there, and down came the theater manager and held up his hands. He was fat and sweating profusely. He waved his hands for everybody to be quiet. There was a palpable feeling of anticipation in the place. As the noise subsided he informed us, reluctantly it seemed to me, that they WERE going to show &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; again (an eruption of CHEERS!) and that after it was over he wanted every single one of &quot;you kids&quot; out of this theater. And, in what seemed like an instant, BLANG, that opening chord was struck and back on the screen there it was! And the whole place went WILD all over again. You still couldn't hear halfthe dialogue, but it didn't matter. I remember the poor heavyset matron, who looked like she just ran a marathon, resting on the arm of an aisle seat, looking at us crazy kids singing and screaming, and breaking out in the most good natured I-give-up-smile I have ever witnessed. What a time! True to his word, after the show, the manager was in the boy's bathroom,even the girl's bathroom, throwing out anyone who thought they were going to stick around one more time. And as we piled out into the street, we were the envy of everbody standing on line. &quot;We saw it TWICE&quot; and held up two fingers, which in retrospect was really a sign of victory.

Let me see if I can get this right -- The movie was originally in mono. For the new DVD they've gone back to the stereo mixes of the songs to create a 5.1 surround mix. The movie's dialogue, however, is still mono, so it switches to stereo only during the featured songs. The trouble is that the DVD's 5.1 stereo mix sounds worse than the original 2 channel stereo versions of the songs. Rather than spacious, the music has evidently been compressed for this digital version.

The great Roger Ebert said it best, &quot;One of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies&quot;.  I still love the scene where Paul's grandfather pops up during &quot;She Loves You&quot;- a really pure and funny scene.That said the criticisms about the sound quality are unfortunately true.  I was expecting a lot more oomph when I heard the opening 12 string Rickenbacher chime for the title song.  Now I want to find the original dvd release that everyone is speaking of so fondly here.There are also some bad copies out there.  I bought mine right away and had to return and replace it because of some digital freeze frame gobbledegook.  The second copy worked fine.  But I know of one other person here in Boston who had the same problem.Also what the hell is up with the packaging?  This is A Hard Days Night for God's sake.

Remington ""John Remington""","[2, 5]","ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF:One of the biggest reasons film as a medium holds the effect over us the way it does is because it appeals to our emotions in ways some of the other arts cannot. This is because film incorporates sound, theatre, painting, dance and writing. That dry polemic aside,A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a fine example of what film can do. By incorporating sound, theatre, painting, dance, music and writing, this film presents one of the purest expressions of joy in cinema history.What made the Beatles successful performers and artists and immortal cultural icons, was their collective personification all of their audiences' hopes and dreams.All wished to be as expressive, free, uninhibited and has happy as they appeared to be. Of course much of this is pure cinematic fabrication, but one cannot fake the explosion of life we see on the screen and hear on their records. No one in history could possibly be talented enough to present such an image without at least a shred of honesty.Those four young men celebrated life and generously shared so much of it with us through their art. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a great testament as to what made them so great.Richard Lester, the director, got out of the way and let them be the Beatles. The hand held camera work and editing in this film arguably created the '60's visual Cultural Revolution. It is a perfect marriage of music to image. Without this film there never would have been an EASY RIDER or even an MTV (on second thought, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing).Of course John, Paul, George, and Ringo couldn't completely match their images in their private lives (who could?) and of course they matured and evolved as we all have. But this film inspired many to live, to love and to create. It is such a force of positive life affirming love that it has to be savored and enjoyed. I don't apologize for dripping over it the way I do. It is a great film, on the level with CITIZEN KANE, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, THE SEVEN SAMURAI and others.A HARD DAY'S NIGHT remains fresh after many repeated viewings.ABOUT THE DVD:The picture is a clear transfer that glows with detail and life. For a black and white film, it vibrates with color. While I am not a technical expert, I am most satisfied with the quality of the sound and picture. It certainly marks a great improvement over the original video tape version although I do miss the formers montage to ""I'll Cry Instead"".The special features are admittedly lame considering none of the Beatles themselves appear. What we get is a great deal of information that gives new meaning to the word ""trivial"".  I do admit to truly enjoying the anecdotes from screenwriter Alun Owen and director Richard Lester.A certain must own.",5,Great and classic entertainment.

Musically, their tastes range from Nirvana to Gaelic Storm to The Moody Blues to Glenn Miller to Bill Monroe to Jimmy Eat World and on and on. But just ask them who their favorite group of all time is and they'll let you know without hesitation that it's The Beatles. So it was with great anticipation that we all sat down in front of the telly and watched A Hard Day's Night tonight. I purposely have not watched this movie in years because I knew that one day it would be out on DVD, and that time is here and now. In glorious black and white John, George, Paul and Ringo burst onto the screen with all of their music and mayhem that was Beatlemania. No need to repeat what this flick is about - that's been done on countless other reviews - but I will say that the  picture quality is phenomenal, the sound is so-so (especially on Can't Buy Me Love - like it came off of a vinyl bootleg record), and the extra's are fair. I particularly love the Liverpudlian accents and humor - and there IS loads of humor. George, the ""quiet Beatle,"" especially, comes off hilarious in his dead pan comedic style. The story line is very basic, but holds the viewer throughout. To me, this movie is better and funnier now than when I first saw it on television back in the early '70's. (Imagine how even better this movie will be when my 2 year old is a teen!). The reason why I gave this movie a 4 is because of the sound and extra's. Could've been better. But the movie itself is absolutely GREAT!To the younger viewers (and listeners)of this movie and Beatles music in general: remember this about this band - for their time, absolutely no one could compare with them. When looking at music charts of the Beatle era, for instance, you will notice that the other top selling songs of the day were so far behind what the Beatles were doing. While Ricky Nelson was singing ""For You,"" the Beatles were belting ""It Won't Be Long."" While the Newbeats were singing ""Bread and Butter,"" the Beatles were cranking out ""Tell Me Why."" Now, don't get me wrong, I like the above mentioned non-Beatle tunes, but when you compare other songs of the period to what the Beatles were doing, well, there is just no comparing, especially in the late 1965 through the 1967 period. (""Rain"" was on the same chart as ""Lil Red Riding Hood"" by Sam the Sham. Talk about night versus day when it comes to musicianship and lyrics!).I think it can be safely said that virtually all pop and rock music (aside from techno or rap) that came out after 1964 had a Beatle influence to some extent, from Frank Sinatra to Classical to even Country. That's quite an accomplishment. Even 'A Hard Day's Night' had a major influence on rock and roll movies and TV shows - just ask the Monkees.Anyhow, check out this great flick and see the beginnings of a phenomena that still shines as brightly today as it did nearly 40 (!) years ago.",4,My 2 year old will also know the Beatles,1033257600,"09 29, 2002",2002,2949,"['sure', 'am', 'glad', 'raised', '14', '11', '6', 'year', 'old', 'children', 'right', 'Musically', 'tastes', 'range', 'Nirvana', 'Gaelic', 'Storm', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'Glenn', 'Miller', 'Bill', 'Monroe', 'Jimmy', 'Eat', 'World', 'just', 'ask', 'who', 'favorite', 'group', 'time', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'hesitation', 'Beatles', 'was', 'great', 'anticipation', 'sat', 'down', 'front', 'telly', 'watched', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'tonight', 'purposely', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'movie', 'years', 'knew', 'one', 'day', 'would', 'be', 'out', 'DVD', 'time', 'here', 'now', 'glorious', 'black', 'white', 'John', 'George', 'Paul', 'Ringo', 'burst', 'screen', 'music', 'mayhem', 'was', 'Beatlemania', 'No', 'need', 'repeat', 'what', 'flick', 'been', 'done', 'countless', 'other', 'will', 'say', 'picture', 'quality', 'phenomenal', 'sound', 'so-so', 'especially', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'came', 'off', 'vinyl', 'bootleg', 'record', 'extra', 'are', 'fair', 'particularly', 'love', 'Liverpudlian', 'accents', 'humor', 'IS', 'loads', 'humor', 'George', 'quiet', 'Beatle', 'especially', 'off', 'hilarious', 'dead', 'pan', 'comedic', 'style', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'basic', 'viewer', 'movie', 'better', 'funnier', 'now', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'television', 'back', 'early', ""'70"", 'Imagine', 'how', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'when', '2', 'year', 'old', 'teen', 'reason', 'why', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'sound', 'extra', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'GREAT', 'younger', 'viewers', 'listeners', 'movie', 'Beatles', 'music', 'general', 'remember', 'band', 'time', 'absolutely', 'one', 'could', 'compare', 'When', 'looking', 'music', 'charts', 'Beatle', 'era', 'instance', 'will', 'notice', 'other', 'top', 'selling', 'songs', 'day', 'were', 'so', 'far', 'what', 'Beatles', 'were', 'doing', 'Ricky', 'Nelson', 'was', 'singing', 'Beatles', 'were', 'belting', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Long', 'Newbeats', 'were', 'singing', 'Bread', 'Butter', 'Beatles', 'were', 'cranking', 'out', 'Tell', 'Me', 'Why', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'above', 'mentioned', 'non-Beatle', 'tunes', 'when', 'compare', 'other', 'songs', 'period', 'what', 'Beatles', 'were', 'doing', 'well', 'just', 'comparing', 'especially', 'late', '1965', '1967', 'period', 'Rain', 'was', 'same', 'chart', 'Lil', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Sam', 'Sham', 'Talk', 'night', 'versus', 'day', 'when', 'musicianship', 'lyrics', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'safely', 'said', 'virtually', 'pop', 'rock', 'music', 'aside', 'techno', 'rap', 'came', 'out', '1964', 'had', 'Beatle', 'influence', 'extent', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Classical', 'even', 'Country', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'Even', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'had', 'major', 'influence', 'rock', 'roll', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'just', 'ask', 'Monkees.Anyhow', 'check', 'out', 'great', 'flick', 'see', 'beginnings', 'phenomena', 'still', 'brightly', 'today', 'did', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'ago']",N/A
385749,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,630382336X,Kevin R. Austra,"[6, 7]","This film was long overdue in DVD.  The quality is superb and I am more confident with the longevity of the DVD over my older VHS copy. Yes, they did tinker with the screen ratio aspect of the original film to make it appear as if it is widescreen.  Remember that at one time the same thing was done with GONE WITH THE WIND to make it appear as if it was Cinemascope. I forgive the current A HARD DAY'S NIGHT release for this commercially targeted ploy based on the high quality of the rest of the movie.In my opinion this is the best of the Beatles films.  It is a fictionalized version of a day in the life (pun intended) of the Beatles in those early hectic days.  Inserted into the mix is actor Wilfred Brambell playing the part of Paul's mischief prone grandfather. The dialogue comes off so naturally that many assumed there was no script at all.  In fact, the film was carefully scripted by screenwriter Alan Owen after he spent several days with the Beatles.  The movie was directed by Richard Lester (The Three Musketeers).  Lester was an up and coming director with several short films to his credit already.  A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and HELP! provided him a golden ticket to later productions.The great thing about A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the boatload of trivia associated with it.  There are so many interesting tidbits that you could fill an entire book discussing them.  This is a film you have to watch several times to catch everything that is going on, for example:-The ""Clean old man"" reference to Paul's grandfather is a comical reference to Brambell's character in an unrelated British television show.-Look for a copy of John Lennon's IN HIS OWN WRITE in the dressing room.-Ringo was actually hungover from an evening of partying during the ""This Boy"" sequence.-There are coat hangers from the New York Plaza Hotel in the background of one scene.-A cameo appearance by Tony award winning actress Anna Quayle (probably most remembered as the Baroness in CHITTY, CHITTY, BANG, BANG) talking with John Lennon on the staircase.-Director Richard Lester accidentally walks into two performance scenes.My one negative criticism of the DVD release is that the original mono soundtrack (at one time found on the United Artist release of the soundtrack album) was replaced with stereo during the movie's lengthy restoration.In the mid 1980s Walter Shenson made the mistake of allowing A HARD DAY'S NIGHT to be restored for re-release in theaters.  He was also planning to do the same thing with HELP!  As with most classic theatrical re-releases, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT  appeared in only a handful of obscure cinemas across the country. As ususal, none of the selected theaters were anywhere within a few hundred miles of where I was living at the time.  Surprise:  The film's limited re-release was considered less than successful and A HARD DAY'S NIGHT went straight to video and laser disk.  A later restoration of HELP! skipped the wide screen completely and went straight to the home video market.I bought the original VHS video tape by mail order catalog as soon as it was available in the late 1980s.  By that time A HARD DAY'S NIGHT had largely disappeared from broadcast television.  For several years  during the late 1970s the local New York City ABC affiliate, WABC, aired A HARD DAY'S NIGHT every New Year's Eve.  It was at that time that I captured the entire film soundtrack on cassette tape.  In lieu of the film I subsequently played the cassette soundtrack over and over again.  As such, I just about memorized every line of dialogue, the music, and the accoustic peculiarities of the old mono recording.Yes, there is a point to this personal flashback.Upon receiving my copy of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT in its clamshell case I spent a Saturday afternoon -- with specific instructions to not be disturbed -- enjoying the film from beginning to end.  The quality of the VHS recording was superb.  The solitary aspect that irritated me was the fact that stereo versions of the Beatles music were substituted for the original mono tracks. In doing so the overlay of the stereo tracks upset the original quality of musical number scenes. The two most notable alterations are that the lip-synching is not as well timed as in the original film.  Secondly is that the new stereo tracks eliminated the original background sound. This is most notable during the final concert scene where the cheering of the fans is basically a repeated loop of the audience cheering before the performance and during the short break before the Beatles begin 'She Loves You.'The more recent DVD release is an improvement over my aging VHS copy.  The picture is crisp and clear.  As noted in other reviews the DVD copy allows us to hear more of the movie dialogue. Unfortunately the out of place stereo tracks remain just as they were in the 1980s video release.  I would have preferred that the film was restored back to its 1964 appearance rather than try and improve upon the original.  Unfortunately ""improving"" the original (ala George Lucas and the STAR WARS films) has been the trend for almost a decade.The DVD release is great.  Hopefully a future release, and there are always new special editions of every film released in time for the holidays, will become available with the original soundtrack intact.",5,The Best of them

The period leading up to that was, in my teenage mind, a necessary evil - the screaming teeny-boppers, the &#34;conventional&#34; songs all on the same subject - this was only so they could gain sufficient popularity and respect in order to record the &#34;real&#34; Beatles oeuvre. It was as if they had sold out at the start of their career instead of the end.I recently read a review of some new film covering the Beatles' adventures in their early years. I can't recall the name and I doubt if anyone else will in six months. What I do remember is the reviewer saying that we didn't need a recreation of the Beatles in their youth, since we have such an excellent record of the real thing in &#34;A Hard Day's Night.&#34; All the elements are there: the wackiness, the gentle disrespect of convention, and the desire to escape their fans that drove them into the studio shortly after this film came out. But the line dividing early and late Beatles is sharp and distinct. Surely Lennon's involvement with Yoko Ono, and the resulting exposure to the music and ideas of Stockhausen, Cage, Ligeti, and the rest of the classical avante-garde, clearly influenced the direction they took in subsequent albums.With the benefit of hindsight, it's hard not to see them in this film as what they became later, as in retrospect we see an adult as the inevitable outgrowth of the child they were. The darker aspects are there as well - I could not help but think that Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Squeaky Fromme could have been among the screaming teenage girls at the end of the movie.",5,Surprisingly good,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1692,"['had', 'always', 'disdained', '34', 'early', 'Beatles', '34', '34', '34', 'Beatles', 'started', 'Rubber', 'Soul', 'period', 'leading', 'up', 'was', 'teenage', 'mind', 'necessary', 'evil', 'screaming', 'teeny-boppers', '34', 'conventional', '34', 'songs', 'same', 'subject', 'was', 'only', 'so', 'could', 'gain', 'sufficient', 'popularity', 'respect', 'order', 'record', '34', 'real', '34', 'Beatles', 'oeuvre', 'was', 'had', 'sold', 'out', 'start', 'career', 'instead', 'end.I', 'recently', 'read', 'review', 'new', 'film', 'covering', 'Beatles', 'adventures', 'early', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'name', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'else', 'will', 'six', 'months', 'What', 'do', 'remember', 'reviewer', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'recreation', 'Beatles', 'youth', 'have', 'such', 'excellent', 'record', 'real', 'thing', '34', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night.', '34', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'wackiness', 'gentle', 'disrespect', 'convention', 'desire', 'escape', 'fans', 'drove', 'studio', 'shortly', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'line', 'dividing', 'early', 'late', 'Beatles', 'sharp', 'distinct', 'Surely', 'Lennon', 'involvement', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'resulting', 'exposure', 'music', 'ideas', 'Stockhausen', 'Cage', 'Ligeti', 'rest', 'classical', 'avante-garde', 'clearly', 'influenced', 'direction', 'took', 'subsequent', 'benefit', 'hindsight', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'what', 'became', 'later', 'retrospect', 'see', 'adult', 'inevitable', 'outgrowth', 'child', 'were', 'darker', 'aspects', 'are', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'Leslie', 'Van', 'Houten', 'Patricia', 'Krenwinkel', 'Squeaky', 'Fromme', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'screaming', 'teenage', 'girls', 'end', 'movie']",N/A

As a film, it's jumpy enough to give you a headache; director Richard Lester only calms down when the boys are playing, and some of the  numbers are textbook examples of how musical performances should be shot  and edited (with as little trickery and pizzazz as possible). As a  high-spirited, energetic lark, though, it's invaluable for fans, who won't  care if Paul, John, George, and Ringo can't really act (though John does  toss off a few good barbs).There is a small streak of meanness, though:  Lester treats the Beatles' fans the way the boys themselves probably saw  them -- as mindless, shrieking girls who chase them everywhere and force  them to use intricate strategies just to get from a car to a building. (You  get the feeling that if the mob of girls ever got their hands on the boys,  they'd simply rip the poor lads to shreds.) And the last shot is of pieces  of paper falling from the Beatles' helicopter -- fan mail, perhaps? None of  this bothered the millions who flocked to the movie, though.

The ""story"" is basically depicting the four guys in their typical environment, jumping, laughing, joking, playing GREAT music (every song is brilliant!) and overall, having fun, while taking good care of each other, almost like brothers.

I strongly disagree with the reviewer that argues that the interviews were uninteresting and unnecessary. To the contrary, they supplement the viewer with an abundance of information about the context that surrounded the movie, the music and round it up as a more solid documentary of the band's overall picture at the time.Worth seeing: absolutely.

385768,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,630382336X,Marty Gillis,"[52, 54]","I grew up with The Beatles and they remain my all time favorite group, the model for almost all that was to come for the next 15 years or so.  I was very excited to learn 'A Hard Days Night' was being released on Blu Ray and had high hopes for a major improvement in both picture and sound quality.I will assume the reader has SEEN this movie so instead of reviewing the film I will instead give my impressions of the Blu Ray release.'A Hard Days Night' is presented in glorious black and white with a 1.66 aspect ratio that is almost the original aspect ratio. In my experience every home released version of this movie has had a slightly different cropping job done to it, some better than others.  The framing for this Blu Ray release looks to me the same as the Miramax DVD version which I assume the master was sourced from.  On my display I choose not to use over-scan and thus it almost fills the entire 16:9 screen with a small amount of top and bottom pillaring.  Unfortunately since the original negatives were not sourced and rescanned/remastered we are only allowed a 1080i presentation which may cause some unwanted combing effects if your display and/or player can not properly de-interlaced the video.  Most people won't notice anything in that regard but I thought I would mention it for the picky out there, myself included.How does the picture stack up against the latest Miramax DVD or even the fabled MPI DVD?  Bottom line is, you DO get more detail.  While the contrast levels are just a bit washed out compared to the MPI DVD version, the overall picture quality is a fair step up from ANY previous home video release.  It is a sad thing to say, but it COULD have been much much better.  Even just using the same exact film elements and rescanning at 2 or 4k with 1080p output resolution and a few contrast/brightness tweaks would have REALLY made this film pop big time.  Mind you, it is no where near to ""poor quality"" in appearance.  From time to time you get an almost 3D pop, but just barely and then ti is gone and you have been teased, seeing what COULD have been with this release and wasn't. Obviously they have taken the easy cheap way out here by using the existing production master which was never progressive in nature to begin with.  Oh well, it is still much better than any existing home video product and I am glad to own it.What about the sound quality? Many are raving about it.  It is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio so what could go wrong...right? For the most part, not much. Dialogue is crisp and as clean as you will ever get from this movie, which was done quickly and 'on the cheap' back in 1964 when The Beatles were running their mop tops off and had very little time for extra takes or for much ADR dubbing after the fact.Most of the music sounds better than it EVER has and that is the main sell point for me.  Presented in the highest fidelity available for now, theses tunes rock. Too bad we are not given a soundtrack only option to play just the tunes without the screaming and applause that is dubbed on top of a lot of it.My only real complaint is that there is a very audible and annoying 'pumping' going on during ""Can't Buy Me Love"" which is obviously an error made at some point during the production of this Blu Ray release and caused by massive overuse of a stereo compressor.  None of my other copies of this film have this, and of course it doesn't exist on the studio recordings either. Yes the Beatles used compression in the studio, but this song is PUMPING so badly that it spoiled that part of the movie for me.  Again, unless you know what you are hearing it probably won't bother most people, but for those of us who do know, it will drive you up the wall.  All the other songs sound fine.  Some will notice they are slower and slightly lower in pitch, this being due to a production quirk that required an adjustment in filming speed so the Pal video monitors in the TV Studio sequences wouldn't show scan lines.  Basically unless somebody fixes the audio digitally for pitch and speed in a future re-release, we will always have to live with this little unfortunate artifact.As for extras, most all the extras from the Miramax release are ported over to this Blu ray release and I won't bother listing them all here. It's a nice slelection, but you most likely have them already if you are a fan of this film.'A Hard Days Night' is a low budget exploitation film created solely by United Artists to extract a soundtrack album.  It is also a true classic and a wonderful slice of the 1960's , attempting to portray a 'day in the life' of The Beatles.  It is amazing how well the film still holds up all these years later.  I am still hoping there will be an official 'Apple' release of this film that will give us a remastered 1080p picture and a proper soundtrack mix for the music, but for now this is the best there is and well worth owning.  Most viewers will find nothing wrong at all with this release with only the obsessive fans and videophiles/audiophiles among us complaining ever so slightly!I love this movie and get a big charge out of it each and every time I watch it.  When you see the crowds and audience going wild for The Beatles in this film, it ISN'T acting!

385769,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,630382336X,Mat,"[1, 3]","Critiquing this film as a piece of cinema, and not as a collection of Beatles tunes is a difficult task. Richard Lester creates some truly beautiful black and white images. Though sometimes the camera can't seem to find its focus. And the images obviously taken on a helicopter as they boys play in the grass outside the television studio shake wildly and distract from the fun being had. The boys, though essentially playing themselves still play it a little stiff as if they are not sure how, exactly, to be themselves. The jokes, for the most part, are still funny, and what little plot there is, still works to give a glimpse into what it was like to be a band on the verge of universal stardom.To take the movie without the songs is well beyond the point, though. The movie is essentially a market ploy to get the songs heard via a different media. One might not be so forgiving if the songs were not any good, but the music shines throughout. The title song that starts the movie off starts with a struuuum that is instantly recognizable and jumps out and smack you in the face. That is followed by what is arguably the Beatles best tunes. When you add in such songs as: I Should Have Known Better, Tell Me Why, I'm Happy Just to Dance with You, the simple, sweet ""If I Fell"" and the sing along favorite ""Can't Buy Me Love"" to the soundtrack then you have a musical that is just shy of remarkable.The movie was released just before the Beatles came to America and appeared on Ed Sullivan which brought on the madness known as Beatlemania. By this time they were extremely popular as can be seen in the crowds reaction while the boys sings on the television show. It is still shocking to see images of teenage girls screaming, crying and shaking in a manner previously only known to the Pentecostal religion. The soundtrack periodically allow the girls screaming to take over the music allowing us to glimpse what it must have been like to be there. No wonder the boys gave up playing live shortly thereafter.A Hard Days Night is an excellent glimpse of the Beatles on the cusp of World Stardom. This was before the summer of love, drugs, and the sitar where the Beatles were just trying to be the best band in the world and writing songs that made them so. It is a joy to see them cutting up and being their goofy, hilarious selves. I dare you not to sing and dance along as you watch it.",4,"Great Tunes, Good Comedy",1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,2394,"['Critiquing', 'film', 'piece', 'cinema', 'not', 'collection', 'Beatles', 'tunes', 'difficult', 'task', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'images', 'sometimes', 'camera', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'focus', 'images', 'obviously', 'taken', 'helicopter', 'boys', 'play', 'grass', 'television', 'studio', 'shake', 'wildly', 'distract', 'fun', 'being', 'had', 'boys', 'essentially', 'playing', 'still', 'play', 'little', 'stiff', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'exactly', 'be', 'jokes', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'still', 'funny', 'what', 'little', 'plot', 'still', 'give', 'glimpse', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'band', 'verge', 'universal', 'stardom.To', 'take', 'movie', 'songs', 'well', 'point', 'movie', 'essentially', 'market', 'ploy', 'get', 'songs', 'heard', 'different', 'media', 'One', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'forgiving', 'songs', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'music', 'title', 'song', 'movie', 'off', 'struuuum', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'out', 'smack', 'face', 'followed', 'what', 'arguably', 'Beatles', 'best', 'tunes', 'When', 'add', 'such', 'songs', 'Should', 'Have', 'Known', 'Better', 'Tell', 'Me', 'Why', ""'m"", 'Happy', 'Just', 'Dance', 'simple', 'sweet', 'Fell', 'sing', 'favorite', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'soundtrack', 'then', 'have', 'musical', 'just', 'shy', 'remarkable.The', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'just', 'Beatles', 'came', 'America', 'appeared', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'brought', 'madness', 'known', 'Beatlemania', 'time', 'were', 'extremely', 'popular', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'crowds', 'reaction', 'boys', 'sings', 'television', 'show', 'still', 'shocking', 'see', 'images', 'teenage', 'girls', 'screaming', 'crying', 'shaking', 'manner', 'previously', 'only', 'known', 'Pentecostal', 'religion', 'soundtrack', 'periodically', 'allow', 'girls', 'screaming', 'take', 'over', 'music', 'allowing', 'glimpse', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'be', 'there', 'No', 'wonder', 'boys', 'gave', 'up', 'playing', 'live', 'shortly', 'thereafter.A', 'Hard', 'Days', 'Night', 'excellent', 'glimpse', 'Beatles', 'cusp', 'World', 'Stardom', 'was', 'summer', 'love', 'drugs', 'sitar', 'where', 'Beatles', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'be', 'best', 'band', 'world', 'writing', 'songs', 'made', 'so', 'joy', 'see', 'cutting', 'up', 'being', 'goofy', 'hilarious', 'selves', 'dare', 'not', 'sing', 'dance', 'along', 'watch']",N/A

Richard Lester's sharp direction and the great musical performances seem as fresh today as they did then. The Beatles may not have been actors, but they were seasoned performers, and they come across natural and believable in this slightly fictionalized account of a brief snapshot in the life of a top touring band of the era.

At one point, the Beatles hold a press conference. Reporter: ""How did you find America?"" John: ""Turn left at Greenland."" Reporter: ""Are you a mod or a rocker?"" Ringo: ""I'm a mocker."" Reporter: ""What would you call that hairstyle you're wearing?"" George: ""Arthur."" Reporter: ""Do you often see your father?"" Paul: ""No, actually, we're just good friends.""

385773,A27PSZX2SE0B51,630382336X,Mike Stone,"[6, 6]","When compared with the relative merits of, say, The Marx Brothers' ""A Night at the Opera"", it's no more than their ""A Night in Casablanca"".  Not a bad place to be, but still with room for improvement.  On the other hand, when compared with the relative merits of ""Spice World"" (which essentially tried to be the same movie), it's more like ""Casablanca"" itself.  What we have here is a movie that is most definitely better than it has any right to be.Going in, I was expecting to notice many Marx Brothers comparisons.  That's the hype, anyway.  Now, John does a credible Groucho, trying to poke holes in all the hot air balloons he sees.  His reply to the notion that the place is surging with girls (""Please sir, sir, can I have one to surge me sir, please sir?"") is Grouchovian at its most bratty.  And Paul manages to pull of a neat Zeppo impression (not the best brother to emulate, mind you; but to be fair, Paul is much more integral to the plot and gets off more wicked lines than Zeppo ever did).  But George and Ringo don't follow the template at all.  George is deadpan all the way, letting the surreality of the situations he finds himself in slide neatly off his back.  When noticing Ringo's ire at a stagehand messing with his drums, George logically notes that ""he's very fussy about his drums, you know, they loom large in his legend.""  Ringo, for his part, is cast as the put-upon little brother of the band.  Many jokes are aimed directly at his whopping proboscis, and his lack of physical stature.  It's all given him an inferiority complex.  No wonder he plays the drums.  ""It's me active compensatory factor,"" he says.  The boys are at their best when they play the scenes straight.  There's nothing worse than a ham actor laughing at his own (scripted) joke.  Thankfully, that's kept to a minimum here.  They don't have the prodigious comedic talents of the Marx's (who does), but they certainly have enough to pull off the wonderful comedy in this script.The Fabs are ably supported by a fine group of comedic actors.  Wilfred Brambell is a suitably hammy as Paul's mischievous (and clean!) Grandfather.  He even gets some fine scenes all to himself, most notably in the Casino and the police station.  Norman Rossington and John Junkin are the doctors in the Beatlemania asylum (a.k.a. the road managers) and hold the fort well.  In a smaller role, Victor Spinetti is funny and quite creepy as the prima donna TV director.  All of these actors/characters serve the movie well, in that even though the situations are far-fetched, they are always grounded within the narrative enough to not seem completely ludicrous.Besides the comedy, the movie's strength is, of course, the music.  Luckily that, even during their early days, the Beatles wrote an abundance of perfect pop songs with which to pepper the soundtrack.  The title song opens the action wonderfully, as we follow the boys fleeing from a throng of fans.  The ""Can't Buy Me Love"" scene in the field is full of infectious energy, topped off with a great punchline (George's comment to a scolding busybody: ""Sorry we hurt your field mister."")

The Beatles shine through as funny, engaging entertainers.  You get to see a bit of their personalities as they are not playing ""characters"" but themselves.  It is done as a mock ""documentary"" in a typical day in their lives but it is light and fun to watch.  Their musical performances are great and you get a glimpse of George Harrison's future wife Pattie Boyd as one of the school girls on the train.

I love this movie.  You might have to watch it a few times to understand it, and to get some of the jokes.I like the DVD version, only because it is more clear than the VHS.  For example, it took me the longest time to figure out what George was eating on the train; it was a bagle.  I couldn't tell on the VHS.  I also have the soundtrack to this movie (which is great).  I can't figure out why the songs of the movie are different from the album.  For example; &quot;I'm Happy Just to Dance with You: , and &quot;And I Love Her&quot; sound slower than the album.  I don't know why.  Anyway, this is good, unfortunatlly, this movie has no plot at all.  It's mainly about the Beatles being themself.  But Paul has he's &quot;clean old man&quot; (grandfather) to look after.  He seems to make everybody but himself, be responsible for looking after his grandfather; while he's off doing other things.  I love John in the movie, he's such a smart-a**.  One thing I caught on the DVD that I couldn't see too well on VHS, was what John wrote as a hobby.  He wrote, &quot;t*ts&quot;; I thought that was funny; I'm sure he wasn't lying about that.  Paul, really doesn't have any funny lines in this movie nor the movie &quot;Help&quot;.  I do, however, like when the reporters asked; &quot;Do you offend see your father?&quot;; and Paul said; &quot;No, actually we're just good friends.&quot;  I also loved when Ringo place his coat down for the woman to walk over; and she fell down a pit.  George was funny also, did anyone catch him staring at one of the girls' chest?

385792,ALXZ64A9OAPJ8,630382336X,"Phrodoe ""Child Of The Kindly Midwest""","[7, 8]","Rock and roll movies are a mixed bag, to say the least. They range from the genius (Stop Making Sense), to the good (The Last Waltz), the dated but watchable (Monterey Pop), the contrived but watchable (The Girl Can't Help It), the noble failure (U2 Rattle and Hum), the ignoble failure (Tommy), and the truly execrable (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band).Only a select few are true classics; A Hard Day's Night is one of them. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is the classic rock movie. Not only did it cement the Beatles' worldwide fame, it redefined for an entire generation what rock and roll was--personified in four young men from Liverpool, who raised the bar for everyone that followed them.A big reason the film does this so well is that it presents the Beatles as stars, rather than relegating them to walk-on performances, as happened with so many other rock acts. Nor does it force the Beatles into roles they were unprepared or unable to play, as Elvis Presley's movies did. Instead, the film presents us with a slightly fictionalized, somewhat surreal version of a typical Beatles day. We see them running from train to hotel, press reception to performance, evading rabid fans, playing their songs, dealing with neurotic managers and TV producers, and trying desperately in the middle of it all to get some time to themselves. The essential theme is that of youth trying to get out from under the constraining thumb of authority--and if someone can come up with a better description of rock and roll, I'd like to hear it.Many elements contribute to making this a classic film. One of them is the director, Richard Lester. A film like this requires a sure hand behind the camera and Lester has it. He never neglects the quality of the music for the sake of comedy, or vice versa, and finding excellent visuals at every turn. He has great comic timing, and knows just how long to hold a reaction shot, just when to cut to a close-up, just where to position his camera to bring out the best in a scene.Another factor is the man who wrote those scenes, Welsh playwright Alun Owen, who does a masterful job all around. He observed the Beatles in action before and while writing the screenplay, and he really captures their personas in his dialogue. His scenes highlight the Beatles as a group, and more importantly as individuals. Perhaps the best example of how he does the latter is the ""shirts"" scene with George Harrison. Corralled into a meeting with an overbearing teen-TV producer, Harrison is unfailingly polite, even as his laconic remarks become more and more scathing.The film is loaded end to end with great scenes: there's the opening dialogue on the train (""Who's that little ol' man?""); and the hilarious confrontation with the stuffed shirt (""I fought in the war for your sort!"" ""I'll bet you're sorry you won!""); the delirious backstage confessional between Lennon and the dowager who thinks John is...him; the great ""he's very clean"" running gag; and the antic lunacy of the makeup room scene, which parodies Shakespeare, television, the Queen, the Beatles, and the movie itself, all in about five minutes. And those are just the scenes that feature the Beatles-there are several hysterical scenes focusing on the secondary characters.Which leads to another factor: the supporting cast. From Norman Rossington as the lads' hapless road manager, to John Junkin as well-meaning but dim roadie Shake, to the delightful Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's grandfather (probably the best performance in the film), to Victor Spinetti as the harried TV producer, there's not a bad performance in the film. For all that it focuses on the Beatles, this is at heart an ensemble film. The supporting roles are just as important as the leads, are written that way, and are played that way. Part of this was calculation on producer Walter Shenson's part; he shrewdly cast veterans in the rest of the film in case the Beatles proved to be bad actors.But Shenson needn't have worried. His stars were naturals, equal to the task. Of course, they get a break in that all they have to do is be themselves. Doing that, though, is not an easy job when handling scripted dialogue--especially if you're bandying psychological jargon about, as Ringo and George do in a great early scene. But the Beatles handle their lines well, John and Ringo especially, and they have undeniable charisma. Part of this is due to where the group was in its career at that time. The Beatles then were four young, energetic men, just coming to realize they had the world by the tail, and the movie overflows with that confident, cocksure attitude. Whether they're cracking wise or playing their songs, it's difficult to take your eyes off them even today.And that leads to the final and most vital component: the music. The songs here represent some of the Beatles' best early music: ""Can't Buy Me Love,""  ""And I Love Her,"" ""I Only Want to Dance With You,"" ""I Should Have Known Better,"" ""If I Fell,"" and the classic title song. They add a lot to the movie's already considerable bounce and energy, and the Beatles perform them with elan...and that's the last, best ingredient. This movie is like the Beatles themselves-energetic, joyous, infectious, and above all fun to watch. It leaves you smiling, and singing along, and wanting to see it again...and if that isn't a classic movie, I don't know what is.",5,THE Classic Rock And Roll Movie,1090627200,"07 24,

The fact that a musical act was releasing a movie to piggyback on their success on the record charts was not a new idea.  It had been done by Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard, Pat Boone and of course Frank Sinatra.  But was new was the approach.  Instead of creating characters for the group to act as in some contrived plot that allowed them to perform new songs written for the film, they acted as themselves in basically a day in the life of the Beatles.  The results were a surprise to most as the film is extremely funny, well written and well acted.  Of course, by playing themselves, the band doesn't have to assume new identities, but their quick wit and wry humor makes for some great scenes and a fun experience.  Although some of the humor is dated, the film has held quite well despite being almost forty years old.  Director Richard Lester does a superb job in capturing the madness the band was going through at the time.  The four Beatles, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr are extremely likable and funny in their own way, Mr. Lennon is sarcastic, Mr. McCartney cute and bubbly, Mr. Harrison is deadpan and wry and Mr. Starr a lovable goof.  The music is the focus of the film and the songs including ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""If I Fell"", ""Tell Me Why"" and the title track are rock classic.

385794,A319YRDK8Y39N,630382336X,"""qmlhcb""","[1, 4]","A Hard Day's Night is one of those films that are highly praised, but not quite the masterpiece it's heralded as.Perhaps it's overrated because of its groundbreaking nature in 1964. This film is the origin of music videos, and the reason we have MTV, VH1 and other music channels now.But when you look at it now, some thirty years later, many of the film's flaws are all too noticeable. Most note worthy, the acting by the Beatles isn't up to snuff. It improves in their later films, but several of their lines here are down-right cringe worthy. Also, much of the camera work is unintentionally shaky. One could argue they were doing it for the film's somewhat documentary approach, but it seems more likely they were rushed for time with the Beatle's busy schedule, as many scenes were steady, while others were shaky.But despite these flaws, the film is still very enjoyable. It's clear the Fab Four were having a blast making this film, ad libbing many of the lines. At times, their comments are surprisingly racy for the time, and it adds to their youthful vigor here. Despite no clear plot, the film still works, almost documentary-like, aided in part by the shaky camera work.I prefer the Beatles follow up film Help!, a much better produced story with louder laughs. That film shows the Beatles becoming more comfortable in their movie shoes. Yet, somehow in its more polished state, it loses some of the youthful innocence the Beatles had at the very beginning of their career, which A Hard Day's Night righteously explores.

385795,A1UOCGI6ZYOPRH,630382336X,Ralph Ferdingstadt,"[211, 230]","When I finally decided to consider replacing my old MPI VHS tape copy of A Hard Day's Night (MP 1064) with the currently available 2 DVD set, I read the reviews on this listing to see if it was really worth re-buying something I've only occasionally watched over the last twenty or so years.  It's not that I dislike the movie - far from it - It's just that this is one of those movies I can only watch once in a while with interest.  Which only means; it's dated, although in the best possible way.  But I love it, and having it as a VHS cassette rotting on my shelf made no sense, so I looked into the DVD.I knew this was one of the first DVDs released and I've heard some which sound pretty bad, generally due to excessive echo from a careless transfer.  And after reading the reviews here, I was expecting the music to be trash.  (I took the precaution of making a digital recording of the soundtrack of the tape.)  Also screen-cropping was an issue.  I prefer widescreen when I can get it, but if someone actually cut part of the image off, which is what at least one reviewer seemed to be saying, that's catastrophic.  Needless to say, I did approach this DVD with extreme caution.But I was pleasantly surprised at what I found.  As for the sound, my dread turned to relief when I heard that the Beatles' music on this DVD sounds as clean and pure as I could hope, with my only beef being that it is rendered in mono, rather than the ""hi-fi"" stereo of the VHS.  But strangely, I found that in this case, mono works better.  Instead of shifting from mono dialogue to stereo music, the DVD is completely mono, which makes for a more consistent viewing experience. For the performance section at the end, I believe a bit more echo was added to make it sound more ""live.""  But as it's all studio tracks anyway, the alteration is somewhat justified and actually does add to the illusion you're listening to the Beatles perform, rather than lip-sync.On the cropping;  This DVD is in widescreen, which admittedly does make the image smaller and harder to see on the small screen.  So why would anyone crop a movie to make it appear widescreen when it'd be better full?  Profit?  (So they could sell us another copy later on.)  Possibly, but for some reason in this instance, I doubted it.  What I did to check was pick an object in the movie close enough to the top of the full screen video that if it were cropped, would certainly not show up on the wide.  I picked the helicopter propeller blades near the end of the movie, when you can see their top, before it takes off.

We loved the film and would play my father's LPs continuously.With the DVD, I am happy to say that my children are now huge fans of the film, the band, and the music. I get at least two requests for the movie each week.The film shows a day in the life of the Beatles during the height of Beatlemania in England. It starts out with the band heading to a studio to perform before a live audience. Along the way the band have a couple of mis-adventures, most of which are caused by Paul's grandfather (played brilliantly by Wilfrid Brambell).Seeing the band during that stage in their carreers is a treat. It was a time before they started to push the boundaries of popular music and the music business.This movie is great for young and old. Even if you are not a die-hard fan of the Beatles, this film is worth watching.The DVD's extras are good. I was hoping for more from the surviving band members, and possibly more performances that didn't make the film. I remember a documentary that was aired a couple of years ago that contained some footage that was cut from the film, and was a little disappointed that it was not included.All in all, this film is one of my favorites, and it apprears to be a hit with the next generation.",5,A blast from the past!,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,1419,"['When', 'was', 'still', 'grade', 'school', 'remember', 'brother', 'watching', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'just', 'time', 'was', 'aired', ""'Saturday"", 'Afternoon', 'Matinee', 'local', 'UHF', 'channel', 'loved', 'film', 'would', 'play', 'father', 'LPs', 'DVD', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'children', 'are', 'now', 'huge', 'fans', 'film', 'band', 'music', 'get', 'least', 'two', 'requests', 'movie', 'week.The', 'film', 'day', 'life', 'Beatles', 'height', 'Beatlemania', 'England', 'out', 'band', 'heading', 'studio', 'perform', 'live', 'audience', 'way', 'band', 'have', 'couple', 'mis-adventures', 'most', 'are', 'caused', 'Paul', 'grandfather', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Wilfrid', 'Brambell', '.Seeing', 'band', 'stage', 'carreers', 'treat', 'was', 'time', 'started', 'push', 'boundaries', 'popular', 'music', 'music', 'business.This', 'movie', 'great', 'young', 'old', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'Beatles', 'film', 'watching.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'surviving', 'band', 'members', 'possibly', 'more', 'performances', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'remember', 'documentary', 'was', 'aired', 'couple', 'years', 'contained', 'footage', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'was', 'not', 'included.All', 'film', 'one', 'favorites', 'be', 'hit', 'next', 'generation']",N/A

Director Richard Lester shows the mayhem of 1964 that was Beatlemania - adolescent teens screaming at the top of their lungs for the four Liverpudlians, who in turn, are running for cover.  The film is a quick jaunt through the day in a life of the British rock band's daily schedule, which involved a set of rehearsals for a television variety show, somewhat annoying press interviews, but a stunning finale filled with ""yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.""But the boys go on brief excursions of their own in between takes to break the monotony.  From singing ""I Should Have known Better"" in the train's storage coach, a little dancing at the hotel casino to several Beatle tunes, ""I Wanna Be Your Man,"" ""Don't Bother Me,"" and ""All My Loving,"" romping around in an open field to the tune of ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" to Ringo venturing out on his own with ""Ringo's Theme"" (""This Boy"" instrumental) playing in the background, the film is filled with madcap humor reminiscent of the Marx Brothers but with a tinge of British comedy; one of the highlights of the film besides the music is the highly humorous screenplay by Allun Owen that the lads and the supporting cast, Paul's Grandfather played by Wilfred Brambell, the television director (Victor Spinetti), Norm, the manager (Norman Rossington), Shake, the assistant (John Junkin II), bring to life.A HARD DAY'S NIGHT remains to be a timeless classic.  The film was innovative during the time it was made and still influences those who watch it over and over again.  But most of all it captures the innocence of that period.

The MPI vhs edition had a special virtue that needs to be considered: the stereo music track is richer and more enjoyable than either the Miramax or MPI dvd editions.  Some of us old enough to remember the original vinyl versus cd controversy discovered along the way that music on tape tends to be warmer than either vinyl or digital, and that seems clearly true to me about the stereo music track for this film.  As for the Miramax/MPI controversy about restorations, I'll say that the Miramax sound track plays back the concert hall scenes as though they're being heard from the audience, which seems logical enough from the viewpoint of the film's story but disappoints the music lover.  The alternate versions of the songs used in the Miramax version may have disappointed some of the purists, but 2 of the songs on the MPI track were inferior versions (John's voice cracking) so take your pick.  The Miramax reconstruction is a not a terrible version, just another version.

DVD.The letterboxing is obviously annoying to some people and it is noticable that things have been cropped however it is not the main problem I have with this release.The biggest crime is what they have done with the MUSIC. How they were allowed to mangle these songs is this way I will never know. The mix presented here is just awful: flat/muddy/bassy/echo-ey and lacks any kind of punch or excitement. Also the way the songs are presented mean that there is a noticable volume increase when the music starts and then a decrease when the song finishes. This mean that the flow of the film is lost as it is painfully obvious that the soundtrack isn't ""real"", it just sounds so separate from the visuals. It also means that it's hard to hear any subsequent dialogue for a few minutes while your ears adjust to the volume drop.And worst of all is the fact that the songs run slower than the original versions. Did they think we wouldn't notice this!? These are songs than many of us have listened to for years and they have treated us with contempt thinking they could get away with doing this. Very poor.The extras are a bit boring as well, I can take them or leave them.I hope that one day this great film gets a proper treatment: decent sound mix (with a stereo track option) with better extras (some Beatles interviews would be good).",2,Movie Good / DVD Bad.,1215648000,"07 10, 2008",2008,1648,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'Miramax', 'DVD', 'collection', 'was', 'released', '2002', 'have', 'only', 'just', 'got', 'around', 'watching', 'decent', 'TV', '5.1', 'surround', 'system.Like', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'love', 'movie', 'am', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'DVD', '.particularly', 'compared', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'recent', 'Help', 'DVD.The', 'letterboxing', 'obviously', 'annoying', 'people', 'noticable', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'cropped', 'however', 'not', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'release.The', 'biggest', 'crime', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'MUSIC', 'How', 'were', 'allowed', 'mangle', 'songs', 'way', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'mix', 'presented', 'here', 'just', 'awful', 'flat/muddy/bassy/echo-ey', 'kind', 'punch', 'excitement', 'Also', 'way', 'songs', 'are', 'presented', 'mean', 'noticable', 'volume', 'increase', 'when', 'music', 'then', 'decrease', 'when', 'song', 'finishes', 'mean', 'flow', 'film', 'lost', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'real', 'just', 'so', 'separate', 'visuals', 'also', 'hard', 'hear', 'subsequent', 'dialogue', 'few', 'minutes', 'ears', 'adjust', 'volume', 'drop.And', 'worst', 'fact', 'songs', 'run', 'slower', 'original', 'versions', 'Did', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'are', 'songs', 'many', 'have', 'listened', 'years', 'have', 'treated', 'contempt', 'thinking', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'doing', 'Very', 'poor.The', 'extras', 'are', 'bit', 'boring', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'them.I', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'great', 'film', 'proper', 'treatment', 'decent', 'sound', 'mix', 'stereo', 'track', 'option', 'better', 'extras', 'Beatles', 'interviews', 'would', 'be', 'good']",N/A

However, this particular (Mirimax/Alliance Atlantis) version presents the picture in an incorrectly framed aspect ratio which chops off words on signs (such as the ""We"" in the sign that says ""We Buy Anything"" that Ringo sees during his ""This Boy"" sequence) and people's heads (check out the end of the ""This Boy"" sequence when ringo leaves the boy and a close up crops the frame to below his eyes!)There is no way on earth that this aspect ratio is what director Richard Lester intended. Why would he shoot the film with well framed shots (as seen in earlier editions) but want it to be released in the poorly cropped, claustrophobic style of this dvd? He wouldn't. I love widescreen but only when a movie is meant to be widescreen! The original intended aspect ratio is always the desired format.Using frame captures I took from both this DVD and the 1995 MPI Special Edition VHS release (I have several versions in laser disc and VHS but this is the version that crops the least from the original film negative), I discovered about 1/6th of the top and bottom of the frame has been cropped and a barely noticeable 1/14th restored to the sides. If you don't believe me and have the 1995 MPI video tape, compare them side by side. I wish a campaign to offer free replacements for these misframed discs had been started (such as the successful campaign for the misframed widescreen Back To The Future set). There is no shot in the full frame VHS that shows microphone booms or 'junk footage' so it is definitely far closer to the proper aspect ratio than this DVD.Also, the audio is just the original monophonic soundtrack processed to simulate (sort of) 5.1 stereo. The great MPI release had crisp, true stereo versions of all the songs (except for ""She Loves You"" of course, as the original stereo master was destroyed).Wish I hadn't wasted my money on this version - what a disappointment. I will never watch this dvd again. Whenever I want to enjoy A Hard Day's Night, I pop in the 1995 MPI VHS.P.S. The cardboard case the discs are in is cheaply made too...and my disc one has a crack starting to run through it from the middle, as well as a pocket of air inside the middle of the disc which most likely will eventually render the disc unplayable. This probably started because the discs are held too tightly by the plastic holders inside the case, thus you really have to yank on them to get them out.",1,"Wrong aspect ratio, 5.1 mono = bad release",1071187200,"12 12, 2003",2003,2526,"['movie', 'worth', '5', 'stars', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'movies', 'are', 'concerned', 'classic', 'rock', 'film', 'However', 'particular', 'Mirimax/Alliance', 'Atlantis', 'version', 'picture', 'incorrectly', 'framed', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'words', 'signs', 'such', 'sign', 'Buy', 'Anything', 'Ringo', 'Boy', 'sequence', 'people', 'heads', 'check', 'end', 'Boy', 'sequence', 'when', 'ringo', 'boy', 'close', 'up', 'frame', 'eyes', 'way', 'earth', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'what', 'director', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'intended', 'Why', 'would', 'shoot', 'film', 'well', 'framed', 'shots', 'seen', 'earlier', 'editions', 'want', 'be', 'released', 'poorly', 'cropped', 'claustrophobic', 'style', 'dvd', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'widescreen', 'only', 'when', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'widescreen', 'original', 'intended', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'always', 'desired', 'format.Using', 'frame', 'took', 'DVD', '1995', 'MPI', 'Special', 'Edition', 'VHS', 'release', 'have', 'several', 'versions', 'laser', 'disc', 'VHS', 'version', 'least', 'original', 'film', 'negative', 'discovered', '1/6th', 'top', 'bottom', 'frame', 'been', 'cropped', 'barely', 'noticeable', '1/14th', 'restored', 'sides', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', '1995', 'MPI', 'video', 'tape', 'compare', 'side', 'side', 'wish', 'campaign', 'offer', 'free', 'replacements', 'misframed', 'discs', 'had', 'been', 'started', 'such', 'successful', 'campaign', 'misframed', 'widescreen', 'Back', 'Future', 'set', 'shot', 'full', 'frame', 'VHS', 'microphone', 'booms', ""'junk"", 'footage', 'definitely', 'far', 'closer', 'proper', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'DVD.Also', 'audio', 'just', 'original', 'monophonic', 'soundtrack', 'processed', 'simulate', 'sort', '5.1', 'stereo', 'great', 'MPI', 'release', 'had', 'crisp', 'true', 'stereo', 'versions', 'songs', 'course', 'original', 'stereo', 'master', 'was', 'destroyed', '.Wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'money', 'version', 'what', 'disappointment', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'dvd', 'again', 'Whenever', 'want', 'enjoy', 'A', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'pop', '1995', 'MPI', 'VHS.P.S', 'cardboard', 'case', 'discs', 'are', 'cheaply', 'made', 'too', 'disc', 'one', 'crack', 'starting', 'run', 'middle', 'as', 'well', 'pocket', 'air', 'middle', 'disc', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'eventually', 'render', 'disc', 'unplayable', 'probably', 'started', 'discs', 'are', 'held', 'too', 'tightly', 'plastic', 'holders', 'case', 'thus', 'really', 'have', 'yank', 'get', 'out']",N/A

However, bonus content is kinda measly and the audio quality in the film is the worst part. The MPI release has far better audio as it used a higher quality stereo source. This Miramax/Lionsgate release uses the monaural mix resampled to 5.1, very poorly and sloppily might I add. The whole thing sounds monaural with tininess and warbled echoing coming from 5 speakers, with .1 coming from whenever a song has a drum beat or a stage room with drowned out footsteps.  To assemble the best print of the film, get ahold of the MPI and Miramax DVDs, but sync the audio from the former to the video of the latter with a video editing program, since both releases run the exact same duration.

I thought to myself that finally someone would give this monumental musical comedy film the respect that it deserves. Boy, was I wrong. Now, there are some good points about this version, but there are only a few. First, the widescreen transfer is excellent and very clear and not as dark as the first Dvd version on MPI. Second there are some good extra features such as the original script that can be viewed with the film (as long as you have a DVD rom with your computer). There are so many extras that come with the film that it does get a little monotonous. Interviews with some of the cast, documentaries etc. Now for the drawbacks. The first and most important is the terrible audio. The 5.1 audio is a joke. There is absolutely no discrete signal separation whatsoever. You dont even get the option of choosing the orignal mono soundtrack or the excellent stereo sound that was included with the first DVD release. I had purchased the Yellow Submarine DVD last year and couldnt believe the excellent 5.1 surround sound on that, so I was under the impression that I would be lifted to the highest high (especially with such a highly regarded company like Miramax) when I would hear the begining crash of the title track. Every song on the Dvd sounds like they were recorded in a box. Maybe I should have waited a little while, but these things happen I guess. Hopefully this audio problem will be corrected in the future and it will wind up being a satisfactory version. I also would have like to have a suvenier booklet included since this is supposed to be a collectors edition. No dice. Also one of the biggest  disapointments is NO Paul Mccartney or Ringo Starr interviews. They could have provided alot more stories that probubly havent been told before about the making of the film.

385813,AK4MCY9LT3ZAC,630382336X,"Robert Conroy ""Con' Conroy""","[3, 4]","A Hard Days Night, the Beatles first film, became a classic quite by accident. Filmed in black and white(because it was cheaper) and short on plot, United Artist was simply trying to cash in on the wave of success that the Beatles were riding in 1964. The film was meant to showcase the Beatles music more than anything else, because that's what the fans wanted. By not having a heavy plot, John, Paul, George and Ringo were able to act more naturally and that resulted in the film looking more like a documentary of the bands' daily life in the throes of ""Beatlemania"" rather than a pop band exploitation film.Director Richard Lester left it up to the Beatles, through their energy and sense of humor, to keep things moving and they delivered. Throughout, you get a slice of their individual personalities, Johns' sarcasm, Pauls' charm, Georges' elusiveness and Ringos' wittiness.The interaction between them and their"" manager and roadie"" in the film give a glimpse of what being on the road constantly must have been like. They gripe, they snipe at each other and they get into mischief just to releive the boredom of travel and being stuck in one place until it's time to go on stage again.There are no tv sets flying out of hotel rooms but there are hints of what would come years down the road when r&r; bands began trashing their quarters due to pent up energy and frustration at being ""stuck"" in one place for too long.The Beatles and their music are the stars of the movie. Songs written for the film are interspersed throughout, culminating in a concert at the end. Unfortuanetely they lip-sync the performance but that is probably because the audio technology available at that time would not have served the Beatles well if they actually had played ""live"".Even so, you get the idea what a live performance of the Beatles was like at that time with fans screaming and jumping throughout.These days Hard Days Night in seen by many film critics including Roger Ebert, as an art film.What was probably thought of as a teen throwaway film in it's time became a film for all times.Of all Beatle  films, this is the best but I would recommend pairing this one with their swan song film, ""Let It Be"", if you can find a copy somewhere. Currently that film is unavailable for some reason but it shows where the Beatles went as a band in just a few short years. In the studio they bicker, they look bored and they seem to be tired of each other and the whole idea of being Beatles anymore....quite a contrast to Hard Days Night, where they are fresh, exuberant and still hungry to be the greatest, which they were and still are....",5,A Great  Days' Work,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,2632,"['Hard', 'Days', 'Night', 'Beatles', 'first', 'film', 'became', 'classic', 'quite', 'accident', 'Filmed', 'black', 'white', 'was', 'cheaper', 'short', 'plot', 'United', 'Artist', 'was', 'simply', 'trying', 'cash', 'wave', 'success', 'Beatles', 'were', 'riding', '1964', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'showcase', 'Beatles', 'music', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'what', 'fans', 'wanted', 'not', 'having', 'heavy', 'plot', 'John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo', 'were', 'able', 'act', 'more', 'naturally', 'resulted', 'film', 'looking', 'more', 'documentary', 'bands', 'daily', 'life', 'throes', 'Beatlemania', 'rather', 'pop', 'band', 'exploitation', 'film.Director', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'left', 'up', 'Beatles', 'energy', 'sense', 'humor', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'delivered', 'Throughout', 'get', 'slice', 'individual', 'personalities', 'Johns', 'sarcasm', 'Pauls', 'charm', 'Georges', 'elusiveness', 'Ringos', 'wittiness.The', 'interaction', 'manager', 'roadie', 'film', 'give', 'glimpse', 'what', 'being', 'road', 'constantly', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'gripe', 'snipe', 'other', 'get', 'mischief', 'just', 'releive', 'boredom', 'travel', 'being', 'stuck', 'one', 'place', 'time', 'go', 'stage', 'are', 'tv', 'sets', 'flying', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'are', 'hints', 'what', 'would', 'come', 'years', 'road', 'when', 'r', 'r', 'began', 'trashing', 'quarters', 'due', 'pent', 'up', 'energy', 'frustration', 'being', 'stuck', 'one', 'place', 'too', 'long.The', 'Beatles', 'music', 'are', 'stars', 'movie', 'Songs', 'written', 'film', 'are', 'interspersed', 'culminating', 'concert', 'end', 'Unfortuanetely', 'lip-sync', 'performance', 'probably', 'audio', 'technology', 'available', 'time', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'served', 'Beatles', 'well', 'actually', 'had', 'played', 'live', '.Even', 'so', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'live', 'performance', 'Beatles', 'was', 'time', 'fans', 'screaming', 'jumping', 'throughout.These', 'days', 'Hard', 'Days', 'Night', 'seen', 'many', 'film', 'critics', 'including', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'art', 'film.What', 'was', 'probably', 'thought', 'teen', 'throwaway', 'film', 'time', 'became', 'film', 'times.Of', 'Beatle', 'films', 'best', 'would', 'recommend', 'pairing', 'one', 'swan', 'song', 'film', 'Let', 'Be', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'somewhere', 'Currently', 'film', 'unavailable', 'reason', 'where', 'Beatles', 'went', 'band', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'studio', 'bicker', 'look', 'bored', 'seem', 'be', 'tired', 'other', 'whole', 'idea', 'being', 'Beatles', 'anymore', '.quite', 'contrast', 'Hard', 'Days', 'Night', 'where', 'are', 'fresh', 'exuberant', 'still', 'hungry', 'be', 'greatest', 'were', 'still', 'are']",N/A

385817,A16QODENBJVUI1,630382336X,Robert Moore,"[26, 31]","A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was a pivotal moment in the history of the Beatle's. Until its release, they had a massive number of detractors, who were positive that they were merely the flavor of the month, four guys who would enjoy a few months of success, and then disappear. People over thirty were having an especially difficult time taking them seriously. This film made everyone, and not just their fans, take them seriously. New York Times critic Clive Barnes wrote a reluctant yet highly praise-worthy review, explaining that while he had previously not enjoyed the Beatles, the movie was, nonetheless, irresistible.By any conceivable standard, this movie is ground breaking. Visually, director Richard Lester broke new ground by employing a hand held camera for much of the film, giving the film a realistically documentary look. He was also able in this way to give the film a constant visual energy that never flags from the opening credits until the final fabulous shot of the Fab Four's helicopter freeze framed in the sky. The script contains not merely a bevy of first-rate jokes, but introduces several moments of surreality. An example of the latter is the Beatles being chased by fans through a train near the beginning of the film. They reach a baggage car with a cage in the center for valuables, into which they lock themselves. They begin playing cards while the girls all scream. They begin singing, cards in hand, ""I Should Have Known Better."" Gradually, however, the cards disappear, with Ringo suddenly having drumsticks in his hands, then another a guitar, until they eventually and inexplicably have all their instruments. As the song fades out, the instruments all disappear, and the cards reappear in their hands.The reason this films continues to delight and entertain is that Richard Lester wanted to make a great movie that happened to star the Beatles, that could stand on its own, and not just a film that would capitalize on their fame. As a result, the film is stuffed to the brim: with ideas, inventive camera shots, unusual and bizarre characters, and more jokes this side of AIRPLANE! There are so many jokes that many might escape the notice of the casual viewer. For instance, while the ""manager"" of the Beatles argues with one of the boys, Paul sits with a Pepsi bottle to his nose, apparently trying to snort the contents into his nose. Or the constant jokes revolving around Paul's grandfather being such a ""clean old man.""Special mention has to be made of Wilfred Brambell. He had achieved great success in one of the greatest TV shows of all time, STEPTOE AND SON, which was the series that the American TV series SANDFORD AND SON was based upon. Brambell is unforgettable playing Paul's grandfather. The boys are all so good you can't say Brambell steals scenes, but that says more about the unexpected charisma of the boys' performances than it does about Brambell, who manages to be equally as dominant in all his scenes. Astonishingly, he was only fifty-one years old at the time of filming, though he looks a great deal older than that.I have been amazed in talking to friends to find out how many have not seen this film. Anyone who is a fan of the Beatles (or even if a non-fan) should see this film as quickly as possible. It not only represents the moment when the world at large was forced to take the Beatles seriously but also remains one of their greatest moments as performers.",5,Still the most stunning rock movie ever made,1030233600,"08 25, 2002",2002,3428,"['HARD', 'DAY', 'NIGHT', 'was', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'history', 'Beatle', 'release', 'had', 'massive', 'number', 'detractors', 'who', 'were', 'positive', 'were', 'merely', 'flavor', 'month', 'four', 'guys', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'few', 'months', 'success', 'then', 'disappear', 'People', 'thirty', 'were', 'having', 'especially', 'difficult', 'time', 'taking', 'seriously', 'film', 'made', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'fans', 'take', 'seriously', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'critic', 'Clive', 'Barnes', 'wrote', 'reluctant', 'yet', 'highly', 'praise-worthy', 'review', 'explaining', 'had', 'previously', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'Beatles', 'movie', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'irresistible.By', 'conceivable', 'standard', 'movie', 'ground', 'breaking', 'Visually', 'director', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'employing', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'much', 'film', 'giving', 'film', 'realistically', 'documentary', 'look', 'was', 'also', 'able', 'way', 'give', 'film', 'constant', 'visual', 'energy', 'never', 'flags', 'opening', 'credits', 'final', 'fabulous', 'shot', 'Fab', 'Four', 'helicopter', 'freeze', 'framed', 'sky', 'script', 'not', 'merely', 'bevy', 'first-rate', 'jokes', 'several', 'moments', 'surreality', 'example', 'latter', 'Beatles', 'being', 'chased', 'fans', 'train', 'beginning', 'film', 'reach', 'baggage', 'car', 'cage', 'center', 'valuables', 'lock', 'begin', 'playing', 'cards', 'girls', 'scream', 'begin', 'singing', 'cards', 'hand', 'Should', 'Have', 'Known', 'Better', 'Gradually', 'however', 'cards', 'disappear', 'Ringo', 'suddenly', 'having', 'drumsticks', 'hands', 'then', 'guitar', 'eventually', 'inexplicably', 'have', 'instruments', 'song', 'out', 'instruments', 'disappear', 'cards', 'reappear', 'hands.The', 'reason', 'films', 'delight', 'entertain', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'wanted', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'happened', 'star', 'Beatles', 'could', 'stand', 'own', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'would', 'capitalize', 'fame', 'result', 'film', 'stuffed', 'brim', 'ideas', 'inventive', 'camera', 'shots', 'unusual', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'more', 'jokes', 'side', 'AIRPLANE', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'jokes', 'many', 'might', 'escape', 'notice', 'casual', 'viewer', 'instance', 'manager', 'Beatles', 'one', 'boys', 'Paul', 'Pepsi', 'bottle', 'nose', 'apparently', 'trying', 'snort', 'contents', 'nose', 'constant', 'jokes', 'revolving', 'Paul', 'grandfather', 'being', 'such', 'clean', 'old', 'man', 'Special', 'mention', 'be', 'made', 'Wilfred', 'Brambell', 'had', 'achieved', 'great', 'success', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'STEPTOE', 'AND', 'SON', 'was', 'series', 'American', 'TV', 'series', 'SANDFORD', 'AND', 'SON', 'was', 'based', 'Brambell', 'unforgettable', 'playing', 'Paul', 'grandfather', 'boys', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Brambell', 'steals', 'scenes', 'more', 'unexpected', 'charisma', 'boys', 'performances', 'Brambell', 'who', 'be', 'equally', 'dominant', 'scenes', 'Astonishingly', 'was', 'only', 'fifty-one', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'filming', 'great', 'deal', 'older', 'that.I', 'have', 'been', 'amazed', 'talking', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'many', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Beatles', 'even', 'non-fan', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'not', 'only', 'moment', 'when', 'world', 'large', 'was', 'forced', 'take', 'Beatles', 'seriously', 'also', 'one', 'greatest', 'moments', 'performers']",N/A

But in 1964, when ""A HARD DAY'S NIGHT"" was released in the US, it was immediately clear that something much more than just a pop culture phenomenon was in the process of unfolding on a global scale.  Maybe it had something to do with the first wave of healing that came after the assassination of JFK.Whatever it was, there was some kind of mystical connection to a widely shared emotion that lifted the Beatles and their music to iconic levels of the highest order.  And kept them there.  There simply had never been anything like them or their songs.As they grew artistically, their music morphed -- celebration, exploration and introspection all became elements of their remarkable catalog of songs. But more than anything else, what struck such a chord in ""A Hard Day's Night"" was the simple ebullience for life itself.  In the film, each Beatle was quickly defined: John Lennon as wry and sarcastic, Paul McCartney as witty and cute, George Harrison as thoughtful and quiet and Ringo Starr as idiosyncratic and outlandish.Not only that, their collective energy, irreverence and self-deprecating wit was perfectly mirrored in the fresh and unexpected film style that pretended to capture a typical day in the life of the fab four. With jump cuts and in camera effects, the faux documentary was not without a dash of farce and a pinch of anarchism.  And all in glorious black and white.  Clearly, this was not another cheeseball Elvis movie clone.  Could it be, well, art and entertainment?In early preproduction, Lennon and McCartney were instructed to write six songs for what was then an untitled film based on a screenplay by Alun Owen.  Lennon encouraged the filmmakers to base the title on one of Ringo's witticisms.  When that was locked in, he and McCartney came up with the title song overnight.Much credit must go to former Beatles' manager Brian Epstein who was no doubt deluged with film offers.  And to director Richard Lester and producer Walter Shenson who backed risky creative decisions that made this film a timeless entertainment that still works its magic on a new generation of Beatles fans.In honor of the 40th anniversary of the release of the band's first single, ""Love Me Do,"" in Great Britain, Miramax is distributing a superb two disc DVD set -- almost three years in the making -- that not only includes a flawless, digitally remastered film transfer, but also ""Give me Everything,"" a companion disc anthology that features hours of rare and new material -- so much in fact that this column does not have the space to detail it.

The film has next to no plot (other than getting the boys together at various times to play music) with odd characterizations for each Beatle, and a few auxiliary characters thrown in for good measure, including Paul's grandfather who spends all of his time trying to escape supervision so he can gamble and pick up women.The film-making is shoddy, with so many of the lines dubbed over mouths that clearly don't match, it is laughable. The aimlessness of the movie conjures up comparisons to French New Wave films, but the effect, if intentional, is less successful here.The music is illustrated through pantomime over a pre-recorded soundtrack, as were television appearances at that time. Most of the songs are straightforward scenes of the boys playing instruments and singing, but a few are backgrounds to action. The title song opens the film with the boys running away from screaming fans. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is the most like a traditional music video with the boys innocently dancing and playing in a park. ""I Should Have Known Better"" begins with the boys playing cards on a train but magically they begin playing instruments with a captive female audience.I can't help but compare this movie to Spice World, which obviously drew a lot of inspiration from this movie.

And what better way to celebrate the century mark than with The Beatles? Ever since Sid was just a baby elf, the Fab Four have been in heavy rotation in our musical selection. Also as a young elf, Sid loved this film so we decided to commemerate our 100th review with something special as well as awesome. In fact, A Hard Day's Night is so great that it isn't even B and it still got 5 stars from your pal, Sid the Elf.A Hard Day's Night was the boys' first film and it was successful in every way. It is a ""mock-documentry"" that dipicts a day in the life of John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they travel by train to a London TV studio for a gig. Of course, all kinds of shennanigans ensue on the trip and upon arrival, most involved Paul's grandfather who's a villain and a real mixer. All four Beatles showed their famous wit and charisma in the film along with surprisingly solid acting chops. This was especially true for Ringo, who got a little more of a showcase than the others. But, he still managed to be B once in the film. During one of the performance scenes, Richard Starkey is missing his skins by a good 6 inches on a close-up; hilarious every viewing.A Hard Day's Night is one of Sid's all-time favorites. It is an extremely entertaining and extremely funny movie. Throw in a soundtrack comprised of all Lennon-McCartney originals(well, except for the song George and Ringo are rocking out to on Ringo's little radio on the train), and we say this guy's got it. The film shows Beatlemania at its peak and the Boys in the eye of the hurricane. Obviously it's somewhat naive, but one of the things that makes the film so special is that it paints the Beatles exactly how these fans would like to picture them. So, needless to say, this one get a reco from Sid himself.

One thing that is very noticeable with this set is that the music has been digitally remastered and the sonic quality of the songs is markedly different from the dialogue in the rest of the movie.The extra disc provides a lot of insight into the making of the film and the whole Beatles scene.  Everyone from Richard Lester to the tailor and hairdresser on the film talk about their memories.  Klaus Voorman gives an interesting interview where he shows drawings that he made during the early years of Beatlemania.  There is also a documentary on the first disc that repeats clips from some of the interviews on disc 2 but most of the insights are unique to this special.Despite the fact that there is a lot of bonus content, even more would have been appreciated.  While there is an interview with the man who designed the film's movie poster, an actual gallery of posters and lobby cards would have been appreciated.  It would have also been appropriate to include theatrical trailers for the film.  This set does include DVD-ROM content but I did not have access to it so perhaps these things are located there.Other things that could've been added to disc 2 include deleted scenes shown in &quot;You Can't Do That! The Making of 'A Hard Day's Night'&quot; and the &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; intro that was added to the film when it was re-released in the 1980s.  Richard Lester's &quot;Running Jumping Standing Still&quot; film should have also been included since it's mentioned so much on the DVD.For fans of 1960s cinema or the Beatles, this set is a keeper.

Films starring pop groups, if made, are usually pretty awful. Unlike most things in their career though, the Beatles did things differently. Yes, they did have the low budget and their schedule was so hectic that six weeks probably seemed a lifetime and a couple of real 'actors' were brought in. The thing was, it was actually good. Dispensing with the love interest - apart from the Fabs trying to chat up a couple of girls on the train (one of whom George later married) and being chased by hoardes of girls, there was a notable lack of romantic interest. This was a comedy and it set the Fabs personalities in stone forever - John the cheeky one, Paul the romantic, George the laconic, quiet one and Ringo the lovable, grumpy one. Add a great script, full of funny one liners, the sympathetic Dick Lester, a good cast who didn't overshadow the Beatles and the fact that the group themselves were pretty good - plus fantastic songs - and you have something which has lasted and which even my children sat down and watched with me over Christmas (usually deriding black and white films as unwatchable). When I asked how they liked it, my seven year old daughter said, &#34;I forgot it was black and white - I was watching the Beatles....&#34; Well, yes, they did, and still do, have that affect - on screen, they are magnetic.The film, for those who haven't seen it has a pretty loose plot. Almost a semi-documentary, the Beatles are seen going by train to a show. It reflects their life at that time, &#34;so far I've seen a train and a car and a room and a car and a room and a room...&#34;, the general adult stuffiness around them, &#34;I fought the war for your sort!&#34; and the crazy press conferences and crowds, where fame made them prisoners and they famously break out to cavort in a field to the joyous accompanianment of &#34;Can't Buy Me Love.&#34; Ringo is the best actor, by far, but the others all manage to carry their lines well enough and Dick Lester was careful never to give them too much to say, so it sounded more natural. Ringo wanders off in the film and then manages to get arrested, necessitating being rescued by the others before the &#34;show can go on.&#34; This is a joyous and fun film, when success had finally arrived and all was well with the Beatles world.Although others reviewing here didn't much like the extras, I personally thought they were great (although I agree strongly that it would have been nice to have had, &#34;The Making of...&#34;). Still, there are loads of interviews included on the second disc, by just about everyone who worked on the film: George Martin, Dick Lester, Denis O'Dell, studio executives, members of the cast (John Junkin, Lionel Blair, Kenneth Haigh, David Jaxon, Anna Quayle, Jeremy Lloyd, Terry Hooper), members of the production crew, the post-production crew, actress Isla Blair on a scene she filmed which was cut, photographer Robert Freeman, Tony Barrow, friend Klaus Voormann, Sid Bernstein and many others. Personally, I really enjoyed the many memories and stories from those involved, almost as much as I enjoyed re-watching the film.

The movie is a timeless classic that hasn't lost anything in the nearly 40 years since its release.  I don't think I have much to add to what's already been said time and time again.But this was not what I expected when I heard there was to be a deluxe DVD special edition.  I have read that since Miramax was handling this release, not the Beatles' company Apple, they simply were not given access to all the material that could have been included.  I've also read that there exists no outtakes or deleted scenes (except for the &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; sequence).  Whatever the reasons, the second disc of interviews is frankly kind of boring.  I would have far preferred more extensive interviews with George Martin, Richard Lester, and the screenwriter (his name escapes me at the moment) rather than people who were hardly involved at all.  The primary creative personel interviews are great to have, but could have been more in-depth.  Maybe an &quot;highlights&quot; reel could have been edited together featuring brief comments from all the bit players, and less-involved tech crew.The half-hour featurette on Disc One is pretty well done, and compliments the film nicely.  But there was another Making Of DVD release, now out of print, that was far better and twice as long (worth tracking down).The MOST aggravating aspect:  the DVD-ROM features.

Writer Alan Owun followed the band around as part of his research incoporating actually comments and observations that the band made into his funny screenplay. Night represents a high water mark for the band; it's the first and only album  where all the material was written by John &amp; Paul. Lennon was very prolific during this period composing the bulk of the 13 tracks that ended up on the UK soundtrack and spread out over two albums in the US.Richard Lester's direction was sharp, witty and groundbreaking when Night came out. His approach shaped the film, music and television world for sometime. The Monkees television series was an attempt to recreate some of Lester's tricks used in this film and Help! the follow up. In many respects, Lester's musical sequences are among the first &quot;music videos&quot; in terms of style and content.The DVD comes stuffed with extras. The shorts and comments from those directly or indirectly involved in the film is still quite interesting. While I admire MGM/UA's version of Yellow Submarine (it looks stunning and the unfinished sequences and interviews with those who did the voiceovers are quite interesting), I wish that they had taken this approach to that film. The only think missing of note are comments from the most important folks involved--John, Paul, George and Ringo. Since they put forth most of their views in the Anthology perhaps it was felt that including them here would just duplicate that experience. Regardless, we could do with some fresh insight from Paul and Ringo and even audio commentary from Lennon's many interviews would have been welcome.The picture quality is sharp and crisp. A lot of care was obviously taken in the transfer to DVD. This is the second time around for the film and it is an improvement over the first although some fans would be hard pressed to tell the difference.The sound is nothing short of stunning and hopefully represents the type of upgrades we will see on the soundtrack album when it is re-released. One of the best early albums The Beatles made, A Hard Day's Night has held up remarkable well nearly 40 years later. Extras that might have been included (but aren't) could have included a DVD Audio or SACD version of the album, a replica of the press book and one sheet that came with the movie (suitable for framing of course). Still, the extras included here are nice and informative if not always as groundbreaking as the film itself.A great DVD that recaptures the glory of early Beatlemania, A Hard Day's Night stands as one of the best rock movies ever made.

Paul's reply: &quot;Everyone's entitled to 2!&quot;).  But Ringo steals the show, acting-wise.  Feeling neglected from the other 3, he goes off by himself and befriends a young boy who throws a spare tire at him.  I have to dock this 1 star because the documentary &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; is not included (which is now out of print.  I'd trade most of the extra's anyday for it!  Most of the interviews with the other actors and people behind the scenes are dull and unmemorable.

I think it's great they were able to interview the woman who had a scene with Paul which got deleted but how is it that they were able to track her down and not get the rights to that scene?  Does it even exist anymore?  She seems to have a good memory of the scene.
