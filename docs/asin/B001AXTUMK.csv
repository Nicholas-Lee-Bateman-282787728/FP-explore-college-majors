The questions and solutions were trite, simplistic, and wrong.  There was quite a bit of discussion on whether God exists, and the answers pro and con were so dumb that one wonders in the the producer, writer and director Tim Chey had ever actually read about this topic before he wrote the script.

We are so wrapped up in the day to day life of earning the dollar bill (the issue of capitalism) that we have forgotten what the purpose of life is.

However, I felt that there was too much going on and not enough focus. The cover said prove God exists, but that didn't really seem to be the theme of the movie at all.  It was more about why do bad things happen to good people? I think the movie could have been better.  It was almost as if they had a great idea but failed to edit the script before arriving at the final product.  At the end of the day, I'm not sorry I bought this movie.  I will continue to buy anything Stephen Baldwin participates in.  I was a huge fan of his before he became a Christian.  As I got out of college and began developing my faith, Stephen Baldwin also became a Christian and starting making Christian movies.  It kind of was cool to witness that and see the difference it not only made in his life but even the movies he makes.  I love Stephen Baldwin and feel he is making a difference in Hollywood .

1168698,A207IYGZTAF0DS,B001AXTUMK,NoWireHangers,"[6, 9]","I didn't know what to expect from ""The Genius Club"". It seemed to be something of a ""love it or hate it"" movie, judging from some reviews and its IMDb rating. Knowing it was made by Tim Chey, who made the amateurish rapture movie, ""Gone"", I feared it might be another badly made evangelistic movie. On the other hand, the premise, some of the world's (or at least the USA's) smartest people gather to find the solution to world problems in a day, sounded intriguing. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't do much with the premise. Not much happens in two hours except for the discussions of the ""genius club"". The riddles start out easy (why is toner ink so expensive?) and progress into questions of war, famine and the existence of God.  Movies based on dialogue can be great, if they're smart and well written, but ""The Genius Club"" is rather pedestrian, the answes to the riddles often obvious. None of the characters come off as geniuses, nor does the screenwriter. The discussions are more like those of a randomly selected group of reasonably intelligent people. Towards the end there are some character development and some of the actors do a good job (Baldwin is surprisingly good) while some don't. The question of God's existence gives a hint there's Christian money and ideas behind this film, but it's not too preachy. On the other hand, the arguments on both sides are the same old, same old, including the tired old Descartes and C.S Lewis arguments, not exactly the stuff of genius. It certainly doesn't ""prove God exists"" as the DVD cover would suggest.So, it it worth watching? It's hard to say. I think ""The Genius Club"" wants to be, tries to be and thinks it is, smarter than it really is and that if you're interested in philosophy the film offers nothing new. On the other hand, some people loved it, so you may want to give it a chance. I would have given it 2 stars if I could but since I can't, and three stars seem to much, it gets two stars from me.",2,Where are the geniuses?,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,1971,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Genius', 'Club', 'seemed', 'be', 'something', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'judging', 'reviews', 'IMDb', 'rating', 'Knowing', 'was', 'made', 'Tim', 'Chey', 'who', 'made', 'amateurish', 'rapture', 'movie', 'Gone', 'feared', 'might', 'be', 'badly', 'made', 'evangelistic', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'premise', 'world', 'least', 'USA', 'smartest', 'people', 'gather', 'find', 'solution', 'world', 'problems', 'day', 'sounded', 'intriguing', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'premise', 'Not', 'much', 'happens', 'two', 'hours', 'discussions', 'genius', 'club', 'riddles', 'start', 'easy', 'why', 'toner', 'ink', 'so', 'expensive', 'progress', 'questions', 'war', 'famine', 'existence', 'God', 'Movies', 'based', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'great', ""'re"", 'smart', 'well', 'written', 'Genius', 'Club', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'answes', 'riddles', 'often', 'obvious', 'None', 'characters', 'come', 'off', 'geniuses', 'screenwriter', 'discussions', 'are', 'more', 'randomly', 'selected', 'group', 'reasonably', 'intelligent', 'people', 'end', 'are', 'character', 'development', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Baldwin', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'God', 'existence', 'hint', 'Christian', 'money', 'ideas', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'preachy', 'other', 'hand', 'arguments', 'sides', 'are', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'including', 'tired', 'old', 'Descartes', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'arguments', 'not', 'exactly', 'stuff', 'genius', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'prove', 'God', 'DVD', 'cover', 'would', 'suggest.So', 'watching', 'hard', 'say', 'think', 'Genius', 'Club', 'be', 'tries', 'be', 'thinks', 'smarter', 'really', ""'re"", 'interested', 'philosophy', 'film', 'offers', 'nothing', 'new', 'other', 'hand', 'people', 'loved', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'chance', 'would', 'have', 'given', '2', 'stars', 'could', 'ca', ""n't"", 'three', 'stars', 'seem', 'much', 'two', 'stars']",N/A
1168699,A10U8DJAPJJI8I,B001AXTUMK,"William Van Hefner ""William Van Hefner""","[1, 1]","This movie had a great potential plotline, some great actors and what looked to be an adequate budget, but ultimately failed to live up to its potential. Anyone who is a Tom Sizemore or Stephen Baldwin fan won't be disappointed with their performances. Jack Scalia's character was written to be rather one-dimensional and he did the best he probably could with the script he had to work with. Although she doesn't get top billing, Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica) puts in a short but decent performance as well. Jacob Bonnema was one of the main characters in the movie, but hardly has any lines at all, despite the fact that he portrays the only identifiable Christian in the room (this was obviously made and marketed as a Christian themed movie). A Google and IMDB search for him shows nothing, although he does share the same last name as the producer of the movie (Arch Bonnema) who himself has a bit role in the film as the President's Chief of Staff. Just a coincidence, I'm sure.The lead role in The Genius Club is actually portrayed by Huntley Ritter. His character is some sort of Homeland Security Agent with an IQ that he hints is higher than everyone else in the room. Honestly, his performance fell rather flat in my view, and his occasional regression into a Southern accent was bad enough to trash what little believability that existed for his character. His performance was awkward and even difficult to watch at times, and that ended up being a big part of the reason this movie doesn't score higher in my opinion.As for the plot, Tom Sizemore plays an evil scientist turned game-show host, where the big prize is NOT getting blown up by a nuclear bomb. A group of Sizemore's hand-picked ""genuises"" are rounded-up by the government and whisked-away to a dingy wharehouse in Washington, D.C. at Sizemore's insistence (first rule of terrorism... Never bargain with terrorists. Oops!). The ""contestants"" are then asked a seemingly random list of questions, most of which are philosophical in nature. Few of the contestants seem to agree on anything most of the time, and the whole fiasco quickly breaks down into more of a battle of egos than a battle of minds.I won't give away the ending, because it represents one of the more redeeming qualities of this movie. The ending has a great concept behind it that I wish had been brought-up earlier in the film. For those of you expecting for some sort of evangelical sermon about Jesus Christ to break out, you will be sorely disappointed. Very little of the debate in the movie centers around God, let alone Christianity. It really is more philosophical in looking at man's inhumanity towards man and why things in the world are obviously unfair. It is definitely thought provoking, almost exciting at times and will stimulate your mind long afterward, whatever your particular religious beliefs are (or aren't).One correction to the ""official"" description given of the movie... There actually ARE some ""extras"" on the DVD, including a director commentary audio track and a behind the scenes short that runs about 20 minutes long. There are also some outtakes and other stuff from the cutting room floor that was left out due to time constraints. Also, there are the inevitable trailers for other movies the same studio has made. Probably worth watching, if you enjoyed the movie. I consider this film worth watching, although I was definitely hoping for more from it than it actually delivered though.",3,"Close, But No Cigar",1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,3470,"['movie', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'plotline', 'great', 'actors', 'what', 'looked', 'be', 'adequate', 'budget', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'performances', 'Jack', 'Scalia', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'be', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'did', 'best', 'probably', 'could', 'script', 'had', 'work', ""n't"", 'get', 'top', 'billing', 'Tricia', 'Helfer', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'short', 'decent', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Jacob', 'Bonnema', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'hardly', 'lines', 'fact', 'only', 'identifiable', 'Christian', 'room', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'marketed', 'Christian', 'themed', 'movie', 'Google', 'IMDB', 'search', 'nothing', 'share', 'same', 'last', 'name', 'producer', 'movie', 'Arch', 'Bonnema', 'who', 'bit', 'role', 'film', 'President', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Just', 'coincidence', ""'m"", 'sure.The', 'lead', 'role', 'Genius', 'Club', 'actually', 'portrayed', 'Huntley', 'Ritter', 'character', 'sort', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'Agent', 'IQ', 'higher', 'everyone', 'else', 'room', 'Honestly', 'performance', 'fell', 'rather', 'flat', 'view', 'occasional', 'regression', 'Southern', 'accent', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'trash', 'what', 'little', 'believability', 'existed', 'character', 'performance', 'was', 'awkward', 'even', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'big', 'part', 'reason', 'movie', ""n't"", 'score', 'higher', 'opinion.As', 'plot', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'evil', 'scientist', 'turned', 'game-show', 'host', 'where', 'big', 'prize', 'NOT', 'getting', 'blown', 'up', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'group', 'Sizemore', 'hand-picked', 'genuises', 'are', 'rounded-up', 'government', 'whisked-away', 'dingy', 'wharehouse', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Sizemore', 'insistence', 'first', 'rule', 'terrorism', 'Never', 'bargain', 'terrorists', 'Oops', 'contestants', 'are', 'then', 'asked', 'seemingly', 'random', 'list', 'questions', 'most', 'are', 'philosophical', 'nature', 'Few', 'contestants', 'seem', 'agree', 'anything', 'most', 'time', 'whole', 'fiasco', 'quickly', 'breaks', 'down', 'more', 'battle', 'egos', 'battle', 'minds.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'one', 'more', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'movie', 'ending', 'great', 'concept', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'brought-up', 'earlier', 'film', 'expecting', 'sort', 'evangelical', 'sermon', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'break', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Very', 'little', 'debate', 'movie', 'centers', 'God', 'let', 'alone', 'Christianity', 'really', 'more', 'philosophical', 'looking', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'towards', 'man', 'why', 'things', 'world', 'are', 'obviously', 'unfair', 'definitely', 'thought', 'provoking', 'almost', 'exciting', 'times', 'will', 'stimulate', 'mind', 'long', 'afterward', 'particular', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", '.One', 'correction', 'official', 'description', 'given', 'movie', 'actually', 'ARE', 'extras', 'DVD', 'including', 'director', 'commentary', 'audio', 'track', 'scenes', 'short', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'are', 'also', 'outtakes', 'other', 'stuff', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'Also', 'are', 'inevitable', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'studio', 'made', 'Probably', 'watching', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'consider', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'definitely', 'hoping', 'more', 'actually', 'delivered']",N/A
