She is the surrogate mother for all of Mchael's friends and fights the good fight. Female and male nudity abounds throughout the season. Gale Harold, Peter Paige, and Scott Lowell do full frontal nudity while all the other main characters, except for Sharon, do extensive nude and sex scenes.

Each one of them are superbly casted for the roles they take on. Two of my favorite actors on the show are actually both females. Michelle Clunie, who plays a lesbian lawyer (in a 8-year relationship with her partner, Lindsay) outstandlingly. And the second, Sharon Gless, the heterosexual mother who can be seen as wanting to be a gay man herself.

But the incredible turn-on is the show itself, which has been finely written, directed and acted since its inception (now spanning four seasons).  It's not a stretch to say QAF ranks with cable's best, including The Sopranos and Six Feet Under.  The glory of this show is that it refuses to take itself too seriously (Alan Ball take note) yet also manages to be genuinely heartfelt without veering into schlockiness.  What you have is thoroughly adult fare that is entertaining, intelligent and sometimes spellbinding.  The direction crackles and pops, the camera work's great, the editing sure-fire; the main characters continue to grow through challenges such as testicular cancer, drug addiction, living with a partner who has AIDS and being assaulted by gay bashers.

The first few episodes lead one to believe that the show will focus on the ""fast lane"" club-gays, but ultimately each of the characters gets side-tracked into other areas of gay life, so that by the end of the series there are at least glimpses of other aspects of the community.

I assume if you're browsing this item, you're probably already a fan, and I am about to rain all over your parade.  Because I DESPISE ""Queer As Folk"" with every fiber of my being - so much so that I have to write a review of it purely to vent my anger and disgust.By the way, I'm gay.  Or at least, I'm a guy who's in a relationship with a guy, but if this show represents what ""gay"" actually is 90% of the time (and, sigh, I might have to concede that it does), then it's time for me to disinherit my family.  Shallow, superficial, sex-obsessed, puerile, whiny, nasty, backstabbing, emotionally stunted men running around living Barbie stereotypes of gay lifestyles.  I hate every single character on this show.  I swear to god, I can't even decide what's more sickening - hearing Brian brag about his 30 different tricks a month (which, ""safe"" or not, is extravagantly neurotic behavior), or watching Emmett go christian and deny his homosexuality altogether.  None of these people are remotely capable of having a healthy sex drive or life, or of otherwise doing anything that's not utterly frivolous and idiotic.  And this is the image that so many gay fans are evidently thrilled to see portrayed on TV.  Brian's ridiculous and suicidal promiscuity finally gets him into professional trouble when one of his ""tricks,"" who also happens to be under his employ, slaps him with a sexual harrasment suit.  Meanwhile Emmett comes frighteningly close to breeding with a similarly self-deluded lesbian, until his friends conspire to win him back by renting out a gay porn star for a romantic evening with the foppish fencesitter.  Wouldn't ya know, he comes right around (so to speak).  Then we have obnoxious stock twink no. 532, Justin, who is ""just beginning to realize his sexual power"" - which means that it's dawning on him that his ""barely legal"" status is a potent aphrodisiac for sleazy business guys in their 30's.  He prances around and sucks blo-pops and we're all supposed to be charmed - whatever, I'm not elderly enough to find him appealing.  And finally, Hal Spark's character, what's-his-name.  All I have to say about Hal Sparks is that I always thought he was gay when he was on Talk Soup, and I found it annoying when he would talk about women (as if), and now he's still supposed to be straight apparently, but he is thoroughly convincing (though annoying as ever) as a gay ""average joe"" on QAF.  Anyway he's probably doing well with the ladies now, cuz we all know that females love gay guys.Now I understand that what I have basically done is complain about the way gay men are represented on this show, but (again) I can't really say that it's inaccurate as far as it goes - it just doesn't go very far.  What we have here is 100% pure superficial gay drama.  QAF is definitely ""portraying a lifestyle,"" to use the Eminem defense, and I'll defend to death the rights of the producers et al to do so; but it's equally my right to express my rage at this portrayal because I feel that it's emphasizing all the wrong things, as dead-on as it may be within its pathetic little gamut.  Of course, it's just my personal opinion, but I don't understand why ANY gay men feel that this is a positive thing.  I hate vapid idiots in real life and I hate them on Showtime.  I DO have to concede, however, that as far as ""bourgeois"" acceptance of homosexuality goes, any sort of representation is better than no sort at all; and shows like this, or ""Will and Grace,"" or ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"" really have helped to drag the ""gay issue"" out of the closet.  But the next step will be to have a gay character who's not an obnoxious, buck-toothed, flaming Peter Pan, or a catty, mincing, home-interiors-obsessed dandy, or a conceited sexaholic label-whore, or what have you.  I can't help but feel that this is sort of the ""minstrel show"" phase of our portrayal in pop culture.  At any rate, I can't watch any more ""QAF,"" nor can I listen to any more monotonous gay house remixes of crappy songs by ""divas"" off the soundtrack.  Not that I'd rather watch sports!P.S. I also understand that I have probably come off as somewhat of a ""basher"" of my own people, but I really don't mean that at all.  I'm quite happy being gay (lol) and even though I don't think it's necessarily a ""choice,"" I WOULD choose it if it were.  I'm fairly shocked when I come up against lingering bigotry, but the politics of the moment make it crystal clear that it's still a very real issue.  It just seems to me that shows like ""Queer As Folk"" give Jesse Helms a little bit too much to chew on.  At this point it's not even ""shocking"" to see sleazy, gratuitous, redundant gay sex choreography on Showtime - it's just pathetic, and it's doing nothing positive for our image.  Not that it's the responsibility of TV shows to arbitrate morals - god forbid!  And like I said, I fully support everybody's right to free expression.  I just feel like somebody needs to be saying ""But there's more!"" - even if there often isn't.",1,Not my Family.,1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,5129,"['going', 'be', 'one', 'unhelpful', 'reviews',

Based on a British TV series of the same name, Queer As Folk is in many ways similar to HBO's Sex And The City, and it's one of the first TV dramas to be completely centered around the lives of homosexual characters, or even have prominent homosexual characters - following on the heels of groundbreaking sitcoms such as Ellen (1994) and Will & Grace (1998). The brainchild of UK-born writer and creator Russell T. Davies, Queer As Folk follows the life and times of a group of gay friends as they live out their respective lives in modern-day America...Set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Queer As Folk follows the exploits of a group of gay and lesbian friends who live on or around Liberty Avenue. Most of the scenes take place either in the character's homes, a local diner, or the popular gay nightclub Babylon. Lindsay Peterson (Thea Gill) and Melanie Marcus (Michelle Clunie) comprise the lone lesbian couple to star in the series, while various gay friends and neighbors such as Brian Kinney (Gale Harold), Michael Novotny-Bruckner (Hal Sparks), Justin Taylor (Randy Harrison), Ted Schmidt (Scott Lowell), Emmett Honeycutt (Peter Paige), etc. deal with each other and their own varying relationships. Composed in a drama/soap opera format, Queer As Folk centers wholly on the careers and lives (including sex, drugs, love, friendships, tragedies, etc.) of its diverse characters, maintaining a specific focus on its attempted realistic portrayal and illustration of the American homosexual lifestyle...The Queer As Folk (Season 1) DVD features a number of interesting episodes including the series premiere in which, following a night of entertainment at Babylon with his friends, Brian goes home with a man named Justin, but has a difficult time conveying to Justin that he doesn't want to pursue a relationship. Meanwhile, friends Lindsay and Melanie are celebrating the birth of their new baby boy, Gus... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Episode 110"" in which Brian evicts Justin after he forgets to set the alarm and the place gets robbed, and ""Episode 118"" in which Justin learns that his parents are getting a divorce while Ted is reunited with Blake...The DVD Report",5,A groundbreaking drama...,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2388,"['Nominated', '9', 'Craft', 'Awards', 'bestowed', 'Director', 'Guild', 'Canada', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'groundbreaking', 'drama', 'series', 'built', 'large', 'cult', 'following', 'inception', '2000', 'Based', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'many', 'ways', 'similar', 'HBO', 'Sex', 'City', 'one', 'first', 'TV', 'dramas', 'be', 'completely', 'centered', 'lives', 'homosexual', 'characters', 'even', 'have', 'prominent', 'homosexual', 'characters', 'following', 'heels', 'groundbreaking', 'sitcoms', 'such', 'Ellen', '1994', 'Will', 'Grace', '1998', 'brainchild', 'UK-born', 'writer', 'creator', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'life', 'times', 'group', 'gay', 'friends', 'live', 'out', 'respective', 'lives', 'modern-day', 'America', 'Set', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pennsylvania', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'exploits', 'group', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'who', 'live', 'Liberty', 'Avenue', 'Most', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'either', 'character', 'homes', 'local', 'diner', 'popular', 'gay', 'nightclub', 'Babylon', 'Lindsay', 'Peterson', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Melanie', 'Marcus', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'comprise', 'lone', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'star', 'series', 'various', 'gay', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'such', 'Brian', 'Kinney', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'Michael', 'Novotny-Bruckner', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'Justin', 'Taylor', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'Ted', 'Schmidt', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'Emmett', 'Honeycutt', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'etc', 'deal', 'other', 'own', 'varying', 'relationships', 'Composed', 'drama/soap', 'opera', 'format', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'centers', 'wholly', 'careers', 'lives', 'including', 'sex', 'drugs', 'love', 'friendships', 'tragedies', 'etc', 'diverse', 'characters', 'maintaining', 'specific', 'focus', 'attempted', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'illustration', 'American', 'homosexual', 'lifestyle', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'including', 'series', 'premiere', 'following', 'night', 'entertainment', 'Babylon', 'friends', 'Brian', 'home', 'man', 'named', 'Justin', 'difficult', 'time', 'conveying', 'Justin', ""n't"", 'want', 'pursue', 'relationship', 'Meanwhile', 'friends', 'Lindsay', 'Melanie', 'are', 'celebrating', 'birth', 'new', 'baby', 'boy', 'Gus', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Episode', '110', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'set', 'alarm', 'place', 'robbed', 'Episode', '118', 'Justin', 'parents', 'are', 'getting', 'divorce', 'Ted', 'reunited', 'Blake', 'DVD', 'Report']",Queer as Folk: Season 1
679855,A3JRQ92REHJJ6X,B00005RIY5,"Callas fan ""douz""","[8, 9]","First of all, I am a big fan of Queer as Folk.  I watched the British series and the US version.  I prefer the American version because it is racier and the cast is better.I must say that this series is unique. Not only because of the gay life it portrays and its nudity.  Simply because of its treatment, its visual quality and its story line. This is quality TV production rarely equalled.  On my list, it comes ex aequo with my all-time favorite TV series: Shogun.  QAF is not only about sex, nudity and the gay club scene. It is also about real characters that we care for and who uncover multi-layered aspects of themselves throughout the series. It is quality TV for every adult viewer, gay or straight, and everyone can learn from QAF about relationships between friends, lovers, parents and children. It is also about acceptance, tolerance and respect of each other's lifestyle, from all points of view (parents, school mates, etc.).I had to buy the DVDs because it promised so many extras.  I watched all 6 discs and I must admit that it left me almost breathless.Every episode (22 in all) is so well directed. Visually, it is simple pleasure to watch the story unfold with all the characters. The cast works better in the US version than in the British one. They seem to be working better together as an ensemble cast.For every episode, you have chapter selections, the ""next on"" feature (a preview of the next episode), audio set-up, a synopsis of the episode itself. Very well made. And they kept the ending credits for each episode!There are 3 special edition episodes. These are episodes with commentaries but it is uniquely done. While you have the episode itself on the right half of the screen, you have a filmed commentary on the left half of the screen, so you actually see the commentator (director, actor, etc.). This is amazingly well done.The other extras are really good, from the outtakes to a sneak preview of Season 2.It even looks better on DVD than when it originally aired on TV.All DVD collections of TV series should be done that way. This is really what we may call a collector's edition.Can't wait for Season 2 on DVD.  I just hope they will do something of that quality for Oz when it comes out on DVD. It deserves the same treatment. ""Shogun"" as well!Queer as Folk Premiere Season on DVD is already sold out in my neck of the woods.

Only two of the six cassette box set are dubbed in the high-quality SP mode. The other 4 are in the low-quality SLP mode. So, technically, only 5 episodes out of 22 look really beautiful.

679858,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B00005RIY5,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[0, 0]","Showtime's boast of ""no limits"" certainly applies to its hugely successful ""Queer As Folk"" series. While certainly not the first series on American TV to portray gay life, no other has been as bold and daring in its sexual content and just what gay sex and gay life is all about. Set in Pittsburgh, the series evolves around four long-time gay companions, the Wonder bread-faced Michael (Hal Sparks) and the resident stud for whom Michael carries a flaming (no pun) torch, Brian (Gale Harold), and their two buddies, the out-and-proud-of-it Emmett (Peter Paige) and the self-unassured Ted (Scott Lowell). A fifth newcomer to the conclave is introduced in Episode 1 when Brian gets it on with 17-year-old Justin, a kid 12 years his junior. After a night of drugs and sex with Justin, Brian gets a call that he's become a father with lesbian friend Lindsay, who's in a relationship with lawyer lover Melanie. How Brian, a gay guy, comes to be a dad is explained pretty simply by Brian: he ""jerked off"" in a Dixie cup. From there, ""Queer As Folk"" takes us to the blossoming romance between Brian and Justin (though Brian will never admit it), Michael finding who he hopes will be the man of his dreams and Emmett and Ted still looking. Through it all, the voice of logic is Michael's mother, Debbie, played to the hilt by an amazing Sharon Gless. By season's end, we've got a pretty good handle on the development of each of the series' main characters, an abundance of gay and lesbian sex and, beyond that, a sense of gay life. Critics have questioned if the show is a realistic protrayal of gay life, but a couple of plot lines smacked of real life, like Brian coming to terms with the death of his estranged father. One bit of silliness, though, was Emmett's misguided shot at converting to heterosexualism through some self-help group. But the realism of the season finale is maybe all too real. As in real life all too often, Justin falls victim to a hate crime of violence, and its reality is nothing less than a jolt. All in all, not a bad first season, and we might even like to know some of the series' leads a little more.",4,A truly ground-breaking venture,1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,2129,"['Showtime', 'boast', 'limits', 'certainly', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'series', 'certainly', 'not', 'first', 'series', 'American', 'TV', 'portray', 'gay', 'life', 'other', 'been', 'bold', 'daring', 'sexual', 'content', 'just', 'what', 'gay', 'sex', 'gay', 'life', 'about', 'Set', 'Pittsburgh', 'series', 'four', 'long-time', 'gay', 'companions', 'Wonder', 'bread-faced', 'Michael', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'resident', 'stud', 'whom', 'Michael', 'flaming', 'pun', 'torch', 'Brian', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'two', 'buddies', 'out-and-proud-of-it', 'Emmett', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'self-unassured', 'Ted', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'fifth', 'newcomer', 'conclave', 'introduced', 'Episode', '1', 'when', 'Brian', '17-year-old', 'Justin', 'kid', '12', 'years', 'junior', 'night', 'drugs', 'sex', 'Justin', 'Brian', 'call', 'become', 'father', 'lesbian', 'friend', 'Lindsay', 'who', 'relationship', 'lawyer', 'lover', 'Melanie', 'How', 'Brian', 'gay', 'guy', 'be', 'dad', 'explained', 'pretty', 'simply', 'Brian', 'jerked', 'off', 'Dixie', 'cup', 'there', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'blossoming', 'romance', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'Brian', 'will', 'never', 'admit', 'Michael', 'finding', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'man', 'dreams', 'Emmett', 'Ted', 'still', 'looking', 'voice', 'logic', 'Michael', 'mother', 'Debbie', 'played', 'hilt', 'amazing', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'season', 'end', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'handle', 'development', 'series', 'main', 'characters', 'abundance', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'sense', 'gay', 'life', 'Critics', 'have', 'questioned', 'show', 'realistic', 'protrayal', 'gay', 'life', 'couple', 'plot', 'lines', 'smacked', 'real', 'life', 'Brian', 'coming', 'terms', 'death', 'estranged', 'father', 'One', 'bit', 'silliness', 'was', 'Emmett', 'misguided', 'shot', 'converting', 'heterosexualism', 'self-help', 'group', 'realism', 'season', 'finale', 'maybe', 'too', 'real', 'real', 'life', 'too', 'often', 'Justin', 'victim', 'hate', 'crime', 'violence', 'reality', 'nothing', 'less', 'jolt', 'not', 'bad', 'first', 'season', 'might', 'even', 'like', 'know', 'series', 'little', 'more']",Queer as Folk: Season 1

Hopkins, II","[10, 12]","I guess I have spent a good chunk of my life trying to find something that really represented the world I know and the feelings I feel.  I know.  I know.  There are the arguments of choice over birth in being gay, but I subscribe to the birth idea.  I simply knew I liked boys by the time I was 5... long before I even knew about sex.  With that said, I always felt that I was excluded by the entertainment industry.  We always had weekly TV series that featured boy-girl relationships and mom-dad families.  I was pretty hard pressed to use my imagination to find something I could see a little of myself or even my family in.  Nevertheless, I persevered and somehow managed to do so time and again.Zip to the year 2000!  Suddenly, along came last year's breakthrough hit, Showtime's &quot;Queer As Folk&quot;.  While the British version was quite a brilliant stroke of genius, the American version brought the story a little closer to home for me.  Due to the number of episodes made, the directors were able to develop characters and relationships a little more over the course of the first season.  We were able to witness the complexities of the Brian/Michael/David relationship as well as the difficulties of a young man named Justin as he &quot;came out of the closet&quot;.At times I winced as I thought, &quot;Jeez- people are going to see this and think all of this debauchery and superficiality is what gay men are all about!&quot;  True, it's not THE definitive view into gay life, but I can assure you that I am quite capable of matching these characters to the real life counterparts in my life.  My mom, while not THE most comfortable with my pre-determined preference for men, watches this show every week and really gets excited about talking about the plot lines.  It is, in short, entertainment.  Plain and simple.  Just be open to the story and you just might forget it's two men or two women jumping in the sack.After years of &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;we&quot; finally get something we can latch on to and enjoy.  It also gives the world the opportunity to see that we are really not unlike the heterosexual community.  Again, I can't say that I have walked a similar path to ALL the characters on this series, though I know quite a few who have.  It's bright.  It's fresh.  It's full of living... and THAT is life.I have yet to receive my DVD set, but knowing what the widescreen presentation of the show looks like- this is going to be on fantastic set!  Also included are outtake reels, deleted scenes and the &quot;Commentary Episodes&quot; that aired at the end of the first run of season one.Even if you don't purchase this DVD set, at least watch the show and take a look for yourself.

I offer kudos to Boy Corrupted, who hit the nail right on the head when he said that this show is superficial.The focus on sex, sex, and more sex, with no real look into the personalities and lives of the characters in this show really do a disservice to the gay community.  Our community is beautiful, full of the same love, respect, and talent that exists in the straght world, but it is not given enough light in this show.  American movies and television shows miss the point when it comes to showing real life and relationships.  It is so unnatural and rehearsed.  Just try watching a foreign series, and you will know what I am talking about.  I haven't seen the British version of Queer As Folk, but would be tremendously interested in doing so.  I am sure it is phenomenally done.It is true that gay culture reveres good looks, and the club life, but there is much more to it than parties and getting wasted.  Gay life is about love, and the desire to be loved an accepted ust like everyone else.  If QAF would touch on some political issues, like the importance of gay marriage, that would serve our community well.  If the show would educate its viewership instead of serving up old stereotype, that would also help.  I am longing for a series that would be sweet and candid, showing the gay community for what it is.  Shows like QAF, and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy for that matter, only paint the gay community in a negative light.  I hope this review catches the eye of a daring producer who will create the kind of masterpiece we need to show us for who we really are.I will follow up on this review when I have more time, I am at work at the moment!Love to All,--Daniel",1,A Superficial Series Based on Stereotypes,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,1770,"['Amazonians', 'First', 'must', 'introduce', 'gay', 'guy', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'offer', 'kudos', 'Boy', 'Corrupted', 'who', 'hit', 'nail', 'right', 'head', 'when', 'said', 'show', 'superficial.The', 'focus', 'sex', 'sex', 'more', 'sex', 'real', 'look', 'personalities', 'lives', 'characters', 'show', 'really', 'do', 'disservice', 'gay', 'community', 'community', 'beautiful', 'full', 'same', 'love', 'respect', 'talent', 'straght', 'world', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'light', 'show', 'American', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', 'miss', 'point', 'when', 'showing', 'real', 'life', 'relationships', 'so', 'unnatural', 'rehearsed', 'Just', 'try', 'watching', 'foreign', 'series', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'British', 'version', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'would', 'be', 'tremendously', 'interested', 'doing', 'so', 'am', 'sure', 'phenomenally', 'done.It', 'true', 'gay', 'culture', 'good', 'looks', 'club', 'life', 'much', 'more', 'parties', 'getting', 'wasted', 'Gay', 'life', 'love', 'desire', 'be', 'loved', 'accepted', 'ust', 'everyone', 'else', 'QAF', 'would', 'touch', 'political', 'issues', 'importance', 'gay', 'marriage', 'would', 'serve', 'community', 'well', 'show', 'would', 'educate', 'viewership', 'instead', 'serving', 'up', 'old', 'stereotype', 'would', 'also', 'help', 'am', 'longing', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'sweet', 'candid', 'showing', 'gay', 'community', 'what', 'Shows', 'QAF', 'Queer', 'Eye', 'Straight', 'Guy', 'matter', 'only', 'paint', 'gay', 'community', 'negative', 'light', 'hope', 'review', 'eye', 'daring', 'producer', 'who', 'will', 'create', 'kind', 'masterpiece', 'need', 'show', 'who', 'really', 'are.I', 'will', 'follow', 'up', 'review', 'when', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'am', 'work', 'moment', 'Love', 'Daniel']",Queer as Folk: Season 1
679863,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B00005RIY5,Daryl B,"[4, 5]","I watched this Showtime series with my roommates and we were not sure what to expect.  This American counterpart to the British smash hit is good and eventually hooks you in with each character. Though it can be sometimes a bit too soap opera-ish, it is a relevant show for the gay and straight community as well.  Debbie (Sharon Gless) is my favorite character as the PFlag mom with a heart of gold.  I wasn't sure if I would like Emmett, the flaming undaunted queen--afraid he would be too stereotypical---but he is kind and funny.  Michael, I think, can be too gulliable and I'd like to see him get over Brian and move on in his life.  Having Brian as a best friend and doting on him like a helpless puppy are too different things. The rest of the cast is good as well....even Brian, who as cold as he can be, will occassionally show glimpses of humanity that hides deep within that iceberg of a heart.  I hope in Season Two, we see more of Melanie and Lindsey and see more character development of them to boot.  The dvd features lots of special features, including deleted scenes and special episodes involving cast interviews.  If you liked the series, you'll want this box set.

679864,A398FD7XNE6ISZ,B00005RIY5,Dave Beards,"[16, 18]","I distinctly remember my elation when I first viewed the original UK version of Queer As Folk'. For one of the first times, our lives were the storylines and we were being shown in an honest way - just as human beings living our lives the best way we know how. Sometimes brutally honest though - some of the subject matter even made me cringe! But it was positive as the stereotypical views of the gay man and woman were being challenged.Then news started filtering out that the US were planning on making their own version of QAF. Alot of people, me included, were very sceptical about this. The US doesn't have a high success rate when taking a successful UK format and developing it for US audiences.So when the first season on Showtime's Queer As Folk began airing in Australia in June 2002, I didn't have the elation that I felt with the UK version. And when I actually began watching the first episode, I was appalled. I thought 'this is one bad show'. Obviously being a fan of the UK version, the characters, actors and settings were fresh in my mind and it was  natural to compare. And the US version came off a very poor second.But I continued watching, as I was advised by a friend that it gets better. After the first 3 episodes, my opinion hadn't changed. The storylines were almost identical to the UK version, even some of the dialogue was identical. But then something happened. The original UK storylines were diverged and new ones added and it started to become a whole new show. Where the UK version finished,the characters were developed  within such wonderful, honest sotrylines that I also became elated at this version of Queer As Folk. So persistance does pay.What can I say about the US s1 Queer As Folk that hasn't been said before? Not everyone likes the show. Obviously due to the content and graphic nature, it will offend people. Even some gay people are appalled by the show. But personally I love it. It depicts a group of gay men and women living their lives, making choices - not always the right choices, but dealing with the consequences. In other words, the characters are more human because they are flawed, just like every human being in this world. The content can be graphic, and sometimes offensive (even to gays),as  the lifestyle can be shown in it's most brutally honest way. I also appreciate how the principle  cast aren't the usual 'classic' gay looking men you see in magazine shoots - neither beefed up muscle men or nancy queens, but ordinary, everyday gays who in their own way are just as physically beautiful as what is depicted in the media.Now onto the DVD - it amazes me how the actual DVD and the special features hardly get a mention in reviews. Afterall, that's why alot of people buy DVD's!!!! Well, the QAF DVD doesn't disappoint. It is wonderfully packaged in a fold out  case with stunning  photography of the cast adorning the sleek design. The special features are wonderful - you can tell that considerable effort was made to offer something extra special to fans of the show.Firstly there are three 'special edition' episodes. Here 'special edition' means the episode with an audio commentary. But the presentation of the commentary is very unique. When one of the actors or producers comments an what's happening on screen, the screen splits in 2 with the scene on one side and the actor/producer  shown on the other. A wonderful idea, and one which works brilliantly. Often with commentaries that have many people speaking, it is sometimes hard to tell who is speaking. But here, there is no such problem and it is a joy to watch their expression as they describe their work .Many facinating facts are divulged here also.Next there is the'bonus features' section on disc 6. Contained here are deleted scenes - all introduced by Hal Sparks who gives indication as to why the scene wasn't used. Hal is a very funny guy who never seems to take himself seriously, and it is very entertaining to watch him 'be himself'. Then comes the 'outtakes' - mainly actors bursting into fits of laughter and fluffing their lines, but nonetheless it's hilarious!!!! Only several minutes long though - in my opinion outtakes are the best feature of any DVD so more is always better! Following on is the section dealing with 'meeting' the characters, actors and executive producers. Mainly written screens of text, but all very readable and entertaining. There is a link to a short video for each actor/producer and whilst these are interesting, they are far too short. Still this section is highly entertaining and gives some extra facts on the characters that you may not know.The rest of the bonus features comprise trailers and 'sneek peeks' for upcoming seasons. These can be interesting to overseas viewers to see how the show is promoted on air in the US. A moving picture gallery set to music rounds out the extras here (there is also a DVD rom link, but I was unable to access it).What a wonderful world it is when there is technology like DVD available where we can not only own our favourite TV show to watch whenever and as many times as we like, but also get to explore behind the scenes with (hopefully) a good set of bonus features. Queer As Folk may be too 'far out' to ever be nominated for mainstream awards, and it may be a low budget show on cable that is mainly of interest to gays', but everyone who works on this show should be extremely proud for making such a cutting edge, brutally honest view of the gay world.",5,"A honest, cutting edge show given the deluxe DVD treatment",1040342400,"12 20,

679865,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00005RIY5,David Anderson,"[4, 4]","""Queer As Folk"" is a great adaptation of the British version of the same name.  This revolutionary US version started in 2000 and caused a great frenzy in the GLBT community.  Before its debut on Showtime, only ""Will And Grace"" and ""Ellen"" explored GLBT lifestyles to this magnitude.  However, the producers riskingly pushed everything further.  This offers one of the most unique shows in television history.  Its success deservingly continues to amaze audiences today.  Though the majority of viewers are GLBT, the straight/ally community will also be entertained.This is one of the few shows that explores graphic realities of such lifestyles.  The highly daring scenes deserve the cast and crew tremendous respect for doing what no other television show has done, namely the nudity and the sex scenes.  Though not every GLBT individual lives those despicted lifestyles in real life, the issues are expressed wonderfully: coming out, child care, gay bashing, HIV/AIDS, and more.  Many can unfortunately relate to these.  Its hardcore impact offers an unforgettable experience.  Every suspenseful detail always leaves audiences anxiously awaiting for what will happen next.  The spectacular Babylon club scenes offer the added viewing pleasure.  Such show quality keeps every episode at its top.  Once anyone starts watching, they instantly become addicted.Gale Harold, Hal Sparks, Randy Harrison, Peter Paige, Scott Lowett, Thea Gill, Michelle Clunie, and Sharon Gless are only some of the ""Queer As Folk"" stars.  Though a few episodes has not-so-perfect acting in one or two scenes, their unique presence makes up for it.  The hardcore dramatic scenes are always as emotional as real life.  They prove that they researched the individual issue before performing it.  All the different personalities blend perfectly as great variety: hot and sexually active, boyishly cute and child in heart, flamboyant and self-identified queen, wallflower and shy, and more.  The individuals perform their personality wonderfully.  Their own sense of drama and humor also blend perfectly.The long cast list allows a broad range of issues to be expressed.  Those who just began watching this show will see Justin beginning to come out, Lindsay giving birth to Gus (Melanie is the second mother, Brian is the father), Michael still managing the market, and of course Brian being Brian.  The chain of events lead to a powerful cliffhanger in the season finale.

I watched the British version first and absolutely loved it but was sad that it ended so quickly.  Now I have the first season of the American series, which took the scripts of the British series and adapted them to fit a series that is a long time continuing drama.  (For those of you who love the American version and have not seen the British version I highly, highly recommend buying and watching it.)It was really interesting to see all the changes they made to the British scripts in the American version.  Like the Phil/Ted character who dies in the British version survives the drug overdose in the American version.  I really liked that change.  In fact I have to say that I liked almost all of the changes that the American version made.  Like the fact that the Stuart/Brian character has a more long-term relationship with the Nathan/Justin character.  In my opinion Brian's on going relationship with Justin makes him much more likable than his British counterpart Stuart.  I also like the fact that the Vince/Michael character's relationship with Cameron/David character lasts much much longer in the American version and also has Michael actually moving in with David.  When I really think about it I have to say I like the American version better mainly because it doesn't end.  Because of this it gave the writers of the American series time to fully develop the story lines that ended so abruptly in the British version.",5,"Groundbreaking Series, Part 2 (British Series being Part 1)",1013904000,"02 17, 2002",2002,1536,"['very', 'hard', 'decide', 'version', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'like', 'best', 'American', 'British', 'watched', 'British', 'version', 'first', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'was', 'sad', 'ended', 'so', 'quickly', 'Now', 'have', 'first', 'season', 'American', 'series', 'took', 'scripts', 'British', 'series', 'adapted', 'fit', 'series', 'long', 'time', 'continuing', 'drama', 'who', 'love', 'American', 'version', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'British', 'version', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'watching', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'see', 'changes', 'made', 'British', 'scripts', 'American', 'version', 'Phil/Ted', 'character', 'who', 'British', 'version', 'drug', 'overdose', 'American', 'version', 'really', 'liked', 'change', 'fact', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'almost', 'changes', 'American', 'version', 'made', 'fact', 'Stuart/Brian', 'character', 'more', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'Nathan/Justin', 'character', 'opinion', 'Brian', 'going', 'relationship', 'Justin', 'much', 'more', 'likable', 'British', 'counterpart', 'Stuart', 'also', 'fact', 'Vince/Michael', 'character', 'relationship', 'Cameron/David', 'character', 'much', 'much', 'longer', 'American', 'version', 'also', 'Michael', 'actually', 'moving', 'David', 'When', 'really', 'think', 'have', 'say', 'like', 'American', 'version', 'better', 'mainly', ""n't"", 'end', 'gave', 'writers', 'American', 'series', 'time', 'fully', 'develop', 'story', 'lines', 'ended', 'so', 'abruptly', 'British', 'version']",Queer as Folk: Season 1

679870,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B00005RIY5,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[1, 2]","First off, let me say that this show is not for everyone. All political Right Wing nutcases should not watch this show. Even some queers will, and do, find this show full of sterotypes. Which it does, but guess what, go to any gay bar in any major city in the US alone, and you'll find that this show really hits the bullseye on many things. The current gay scene is very narcisistic, like it or not. And if anyone ever goes to a Pride Parade, or to Halsted Market Days here in Chicago, you'll see that it's a time for the buffed boys to strip half naked and show off their bodies -plus what they do every Friday and Saturday night. So Queer As Folk focuses on this a bit too much, but their is not much drama in showing a bunch of queens sitting around watching E! Entertainments Oscar coverage. The acting ranges from the brilliant -Sharon Gless, Gale Harold, Peter Page -to the pedantic -it's good Randy Harrison is pretty, cause he can't act- but overall the show represents a fair slice of gay life. But like a true soap opera it is, some of some its story lines are not perfect, such as the much talked about ""gay conversion"" Emmet goes through. While I like David and Michael, the whole relationship was doomed from the beginning, mostly because the writers made it very obvious, thus no real drama. But the things that do work -only because it is true, is the way the characters obsession with working out. Do I think the show sends a negative message? Perhaps, but like Ted, I'm a bit cynical and see people as they really are, which is shallow. I may have low self-esteem, but there is a lot of truth about the gay community in Ted's rants. But I digress. QAF is next stage in TV drama. What the major networks have to do, is watch what cable is doing. Oz, Sex and the City, The Sapranos, Resurrection Blvd, StarGate SG 1 -drama and comedy that may stretch the envelope, but break up the image of the same cop shows the networks have been putting out since Dragnet and the same comedy we've seen since Lucy. The networks claim that they need to reach a large group of people, that these cable shows have an ambition that is too lofty for a broad-based audience. I disagree. These shows can work, if given the time to grow, and if networks won't back away from the Right. QAF represents a right step in the direction (though it's not perfect) for all gay men and to a lesser extent, lesbian women.",4,Queer as Folk: Season of the Queen,1018656000,"04 13, 2002",2002,2406,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'show', 'not', 'everyone', 'political', 'Right', 'Wing', 'nutcases', 'should', 'not', 'watch', 'show', 'Even', 'queers', 'will', 'do', 'find', 'show', 'full', 'sterotypes', 'guess', 'what', 'go', 'gay', 'bar', 'major', 'city', 'US', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'find', 'show', 'really', 'bullseye', 'many', 'things', 'current', 'gay', 'scene', 'very', 'narcisistic', 'not', 'anyone', 'ever', 'Pride', 'Parade', 'Halsted', 'Market', 'Days', 'here', 'Chicago', ""'ll"", 'see', 'time', 'buffed', 'strip', 'half', 'naked', 'show', 'off', 'bodies', '-plus', 'what', 'do', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'night', 'So', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'much', 'drama', 'showing', 'bunch', 'queens', 'sitting', 'watching', 'E', 'Entertainments', 'Oscar', 'coverage', 'acting', 'ranges', 'brilliant', '-Sharon', 'Gless', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'Peter', 'Page', '-to', 'pedantic', '-it', 'good', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'pretty', 'cause', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act-', 'overall', 'show', 'fair', 'slice', 'gay', 'life', 'true', 'soap', 'opera', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'such', 'much', 'talked', 'gay', 'conversion', 'Emmet', 'like', 'David', 'Michael', 'whole', 'relationship', 'was', 'doomed', 'beginning', 'mostly', 'writers', 'made', 'very', 'obvious', 'thus', 'real', 'drama', 'things', 'do', 'work', '-only', 'true', 'way', 'characters', 'obsession', 'working', 'out', 'Do', 'think', 'show', 'negative', 'message', 'Perhaps', 'Ted', ""'m"", 'bit', 'cynical', 'see', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'shallow', 'may', 'have', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'lot', 'truth', 'gay', 'community', 'Ted', 'rants', 'digress', 'QAF', 'next', 'stage', 'TV', 'drama', 'What', 'major', 'networks', 'have', 'do', 'watch', 'what', 'cable', 'doing', 'Oz', 'Sex', 'City', 'Sapranos', 'Resurrection', 'Blvd', 'StarGate', 'SG', '1', '-drama', 'comedy', 'may', 'stretch', 'envelope', 'break', 'up', 'image', 'same', 'cop', 'networks', 'have', 'been', 'putting', 'out', 'Dragnet', 'same', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Lucy', 'networks', 'claim', 'need', 'reach', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'cable', 'shows', 'have', 'ambition', 'too', 'lofty', 'broad-based', 'audience', 'disagree', 'shows', 'can', 'work', 'given', 'time', 'grow', 'networks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'back', 'away', 'Right', 'QAF', 'right', 'step', 'direction', 'not', 'perfect', 'gay', 'men', 'lesser', 'extent', 'lesbian', 'women']",Queer as Folk: Season 1

You do have some, like Brian Kinney, who go around dancing every night and having every guy he can get, but that is not true for most of the rest of the group. And people like Michael and David who are showing the world that two men can have a relationship. The show demonstrates that gay couples deal with many of the same issues as other couples and EVERYTHING is dealt with on this show. Some might say there is too much sex, but many gay men have sex, and hey we're men. But beyond the sex, you have wonderful story lines depicting so many issues.

679875,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00005RIY5,Get What We Give,"[10, 14]","QAF (as it is also known) is a fun little Showtime series based on a BBC television series of the same name.  This compilation of the first season of Showtime's version follows the BBC's plotline almost word for word, with a few exceptions.Queer as Folk follows the lives of a group of men and women who just happen to be gay and living in Philadelphia (although the series is filmed in Canada).  Without intending to pigeonhole any of the characters into two dimensional formats (because they are not portrayed as such), you have:  Brian (self centered beautiful man-boy, who is completely without emotion); Michael (Brian's childhood friend, who has pined after Brian for his whole life to no avail.  He is a comic book nerd who works in a discount department store); Emmett (out and proud, but not in your face gay man, who lives his life to suit himself, not answering to anyone); Ted (plain jane accountant who would love to be hot and sexy, but isn't); Justin (17 year old who sneaks out into the gay world to experience what he knows is his true self; he falls in love with Brian); Debbie (Michael's heterosexual mother - played brilliantly by Sharon Gless - who is proud and loving of her gay son); Lindsay (chilhood friend of Brian's and mother to his son.  She is a lesbian who is an art teacher); Melanie (Lindsay's lover of 6 years and a very forceful and smart attorney).While the first season of QAF was dictated by the script of the BBC's version the producers did take some liberties.

Shrode,"[25, 45]","While Queer As Folk is fascinating in that it has pushed the depiction of gay life light years beyond any other TV show or movie, especially in its portrayal of gay love; Queer As Folk manages to play it exceedingly safe in showing diversity.  There are no major ethnic characters on the show.  The majority of the QAF mainstays are young, very attractive and somewhat affluent.  They live in a fantasy gay world where only the beautiful young men come to dance in a disco with a backroom (and this in Pittsburgh of all places!) You will never find transgendered characters, bears, people with disabilities or the gay everyman on this show.  AIDS is acknowledged in Michael's Uncle who is mostly a sad, old queen who makes intimations about his mortality.  If anything, QAF preserves the gay stereotypes it professes it wants to tear down by portraying gay men as frivolous pretty boys lacking in depth or substance.  Each character borders on caricature; from jaded sex addict, naive boy toy, fashion queen, materialistic lipstick lesbians, frustrated button downed frumpy queer with a addiction to web porn, etc.QAF could do so much more but doesn't try.  It relies on sex,nudity and flash to titillate and capture your attention.  Sadly, it has very little to say, save its attention to gay youth and the coming out experience.  Even then, it is handled &quot;fabulously&quot; by making the gay teen in question a student at a private school from a noveau riche suburb, who just happens to fall in with a supportive group of adult friends.I am longing for a real life drama based on real queer people and their lives not this fab Hollywood glossy dream.",2,Queer as Queer,1007769600,"12 8, 2001",2001,1656,"['Queer', 'Folk', 'fascinating', 'pushed', 'depiction', 'gay', 'life', 'light', 'years', 'other', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'especially', 'portrayal', 'gay', 'love', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'play', 'exceedingly', 'safe', 'showing', 'diversity', 'are', 'major', 'ethnic', 'characters', 'show', 'majority', 'QAF', 'mainstays', 'are', 'young', 'very', 'attractive', 'somewhat', 'affluent', 'live', 'fantasy', 'gay', 'world', 'where', 'only', 'beautiful', 'young', 'men', 'come', 'dance', 'disco', 'backroom', 'Pittsburgh', 'places', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'transgendered', 'characters', 'bears', 'people', 'disabilities', 'gay', 'everyman', 'show', 'AIDS', 'acknowledged', 'Michael', 'Uncle', 'who', 'mostly', 'sad', 'old', 'queen', 'who', 'intimations', 'mortality', 'anything', 'QAF', 'gay', 'tear', 'down', 'portraying', 'gay', 'men', 'frivolous', 'pretty', 'lacking', 'depth', 'substance', 'character', 'borders', 'caricature', 'jaded', 'sex', 'addict', 'naive', 'boy', 'toy', 'fashion', 'queen', 'materialistic', 'lipstick', 'lesbians', 'frustrated', 'button', 'downed', 'frumpy', 'queer', 'addiction', 'web', 'porn', 'etc.QAF', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'more', ""n't"", 'try', 'sex', 'nudity', 'flash', 'titillate', 'capture', 'attention', 'Sadly', 'very', 'little', 'say', 'save', 'attention', 'gay', 'youth', 'coming', 'out', 'experience', 'Even', 'then', 'handled', 'quot', 'fabulously', 'quot', 'making', 'gay', 'teen', 'question', 'student', 'private', 'school', 'noveau', 'riche', 'suburb', 'who', 'just', 'fall', 'supportive', 'group', 'adult', 'friends.I', 'am', 'longing', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'based', 'real', 'queer', 'people', 'lives', 'not', 'fab', 'Hollywood', 'glossy', 'dream']",Queer as Folk: Season 1

Unlike its British counterpart, which at least balanced such characters out with other less stereotypical elements... the US version seems to focus almost solely on the sexual prowess of its characters, many of whom are ill defined and selfish.  Sure, they've tried to balance some of this out with the lesbian couple, but by and large, the first season is simply a way of introducing these illogical characters, none of whom seem very appealing on any level. I give it three stars because the acting is uniformly fine, and the music is terrific, but on the whole, ""Queer as Folk's"" US cousins fall flat week in and week out.

Let me tell you how, the American version takes a deeper look into the relationships between the chatacters and lets you decide for yourself why you should care about them.  And let me tell you something at times you do wonder why you care, but that's because each charater is made so wonderfully human.  You get the feeling that you've at one time or another met at least one of these people, or at times have done things similar to them.  What drew me in and hooked me wasn't the sex, but the center realtionsip of Michael and Brian.

If you come to this looking for a comemtary on all gay life you won't get it.

679889,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B00005RIY5,Libretio,"[154, 157]","QUEER AS FOLK: Season One(USA - 2000/2001)Aspect ratio: 1.78:1TV soundtrack: Stereo""The thing you need to know is, it's all about sex.""That's the first line of dialogue, spoken in voiceover at the beginning of ""Queer as Folk"", a sprawling, impressively realized drama about the lives of several working-class gay men living in Pittsburgh at the turn of the 21st century. And, indeed, this 22-episode series - based on the British original which ran for eight episodes in 1999 before spawning a brief sequel the following year - presents a visual celebration of gay sex in all its forms, launching headfirst into NC-17 territory with unapologetic abandon. Some parts are raunchy and liberating, while others are soulless and ugly, yet the script never preaches or condemns, merely observes without judgment.Using the narrative template established by writer Russell T. Davies in the UK version, many of QAF's initial episodes will be familiar to anyone who's already seen the original - same characters and situations, same dramatic arc - but it eventually finds its own feet, employing a defiantly American approach in terms of mood and execution, whilst remaining true to the spirit of Davies' initial concept. As might be expected, the show touches on a variety of pressing social issues including HIV and AIDS, homophobia and ex-gay ministries, whilst also confronting some ugly home truths, most notably the casual (and not-so-casual) drug use which enhances some people's lives whilst ruining others. This is ambitious, warts-and-all stuff, portrayed with integrity and passion.Much of the show's success is due principally to the casting of Gale Harold, making a staggeringly assured screen debut as ultra-sexy Brian Kinney, an elemental force of nature whose actions and reactions inform the lives of virtually every other character in the show. A sexual predator by nature, his cold-hearted vanity and selfish bravado may seem a little obnoxious at first, but this incredibly complex character - terrified of growing older and turning into his overbearing father - is eventually exposed as a decent, loving man whose withering cynicism (""There's only two kinds of straight people in this world - the ones that hate you to your face, and the ones that hate you behind your back"") masks a soul in crisis. How appropriate that the first season should end on a closeup of his beautiful face, the mask completely (albeit forcibly) removed.Other stand-outs in an exceptional cast include comedian Hal Sparks as Brian's lovable best friend Michael, the indomitable Sharon (""I love my gay son!"") Gless as Sparks' over-the-top mom Debbie, and Michelle Clunie as Melanie, a no-nonsense lawyer whose hostility towards Brian allows plenty of room for dramatic conflict (Clunie and Thea Gill play a loving couple whose lives are central to the proceedings, unlike the British original where the female characters seemed almost surplus to requirements). Scott Lowell (Ted) and Peter Paige (Emmett) complete the core group, which is bolstered by the arrival of 17 year old Justin (played by the astonishingly young-looking 23 year old, Randy Harrison), coming out of the closet with a vengeance while his worried mom (Sherry Miller) hovers on the sidelines, maintaining an anxious vigil. Along with Gale Harold, Harrison is involved in some of the show's most graphic sex scenes, and both actors display a level of bravery and commitment that goes way beyond the call of duty. Hats off to both of them.Look out for a wealth of memorable scenes and set-pieces, such as the hilarious whirlwind romance between Emmett and his 'soulmate' which crams a lifetime of gay cliches into a two-hour relationship (!); Brian coming out to his father (a powerful cameo by experienced character actor Lawrence Dane); Melanie's reaction to a bigoted nurse during a moment of crisis; Debbie's jaw-dropping description of Brie cheese (!); and Justin becoming, shall we say, REALLY acquainted with handsome young football jock Chris Hobbs (a small but hugely significant role, played by Alec McClure) in the school's athletic room... All gay life is here, as the old saying goes.To the accompaniment of a thumping musical soundtrack, the season culminates in a deeply moving season finale (directed by Alex Chapple), which contains the show's most outstanding scene of all, a glorious, life-affirming sequence in which most of Justin's hopes and dreams are realized at the school prom, set to the haunting, melancholy strains of Ben E. King's classic, 'Save the Last Dance for Me'. Which, of course, leaves us totally unprepared for the devastation that follows...Afterwards, during the show's closing moments, the audience is abruptly reminded of the fragile humanity which underpins these extraordinary characters, and how much they've captured our hearts. In the end, as raunchy as it is, the show isn't really about sex at all - it's about PEOPLE, and the way our lives are defined by our relationships with family and loved ones. This episode, more than any other, amounts to a near-perfect combination of music, character development and dramatic action, and is without question the most heartbreaking hour of television this reviewer has ever seen.Though prompted by its excellent British counterpart, the US version of QAF is arguably one of the most significant events in the history of gay film and television in America because, crucially, it's financed and exhibited from within the mainstream arena. It isn't low-budget and marginalized - it's empowering, intelligent and uproariously funny, and it's in-your-face like nothing you've ever seen on TV before. After this, the representation of gay people in American art can never be the same again, because QAF has set the standard against which all future offerings must surely be measured.

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[4, 9]","I am not sure how accurate Queer As Folk is in portraying gay life in America, but I am sure that all the emotional issues and drama the characters endure are what all people, gay or straight, go through.We have the cast of four characters: a male Samantha, Charlotte, Miranda, and Carrie.  Michael (Carrie), Brian (Samantha), Emmett (Miranda), and Ted (Charlotte) live, work, and party in Pittsburgh.  Their main hangout is the decadent nightclub Babylon (althought Sodom and Gomorrah comes to mind).  Other characters include a lesbian couple, Lindsay and Melanie, who are raising a baby boy.  The baby's biological father is Brian.  Like his alter ego Samantha, Brian is a live-for-the-moment, screw for fun, risk-taking, great-looking bad boy.  One of the sweetest things in the series - one of the main reasons I am sticking with the series even though I am uncomfortable with the graphic sex - is that Brian is so tender with his child and loves him so much.  Just as sweet, and more intriguing, is the deep feeling and connection he has with the baby's mom.  Never mind lesbian or gay, these two people love each other.  Even Melanie is jealous of Brian.  Melanie hates his guts.  Brian and Lindsay are total yin and yang.  They can deny each other nothing, not matter how they try.  I am dying to see how this true love triangle turns out.Another reason I am sticking with the series is the character of Justin.  A seventeen-year old who is in love with and in a hot, sexual relationship with Brian, Justin is bold.  He knows who he is and is going out into the world and getting it.  I also adore Justin's little friend, Daphne.  Justin's mom, Jennifer, is struggling with the fact that her son is homosexual.  She is also bold, overcoming her fear to enter his world, chasing him as Justin is chasing Brian.Emmett is really sweet.  Ted is a washed-up loser, sorry!  He meets someone perfect for him, but lets the guy go for no good reason.  Ted takes drugs from a stranger and goes into a coma.  The stranger abandons him.  Later he sees the stranger at the nightclub and wants to get together with him.  Loser!All the main, supporting, and guest actors and actresses in here are brave, charting a new world for American society and American television.  I do fast forward the sex scenes.  They are simply gay porn, which I am not into.

679894,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,B00005RIY5,Luis Hernandez,"[9, 11]","When it comes to their slogan, cable television's Showtime network definitely has &quot;no limits.&quot; &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (or &quot;QAF&quot; for short) was introduced into the network's lineup in January 2001. Following their first community-oriented series, &quot;Soul Food&quot; (aimed for African-Americans) and &quot;Resurrection Boulevard&quot; (Latinos), QAF was the first gay serial to debut on American television.Based on the popular, yet controversial British series of the same name, QAF is a pioneering achievement for network programming. Before the rise of the gay rights movement in the 1990s, a gay-themed series would been unheard of in the United States. Unlike their European and Australian/New Zealander counterparts, American audiences tended to remain very closed to depictions of gay subculture for decades. However, with the emergence of gay culture and its' promotion in the media (e.g., Madonna, Margaret Cho, etc.) QAF debuted at a time that tolerance was becoming part of mainstream culture.The show, which takes place in Pittsburgh (but actually filmed in Toronto, Canada) QAF revolves around four gay friends. Michael (Hal Sparks) is a manager at a local department store; Brian (played excellently by newcomer Gale Harold) is a heartless, nymphomaniac, yet very misunderstood advertisement executive; Ted (played by the adorable Scott Lowell) is a businessman who is the hopeless romantic; and finally Emmett (Peter Paige) a flamboyant retail worker with some of the funniest lines ever heard.After a series of events at the local gay club, Babylon, Justin (Randy Harrison) a 17 year old student who is starting to debut in Pittsburgh's gay scene, becomes the fifth member of the quartet, pouring his affection and devotion to an unwanting, selfish Brian. Ted, who secretly is in love with Michael faces a near death experience after an accidental overdose. Emmett provides both hysterical and inspirational output in balancing the events in his friend's lives, and Michael deals with homophobia at work and meeting a new love.Rounding out the cast are a handful of women who provide their support to their male counterparts. Sharon Gless, or television's &quot;Cagney and Lacey&quot; plays Debbie Novotny, Michael's mother with humor and grace. The show's lesbian couple (Melanie Clunie and Thea Gill) face trials and tribulations in raising a newborn son and the distance caused by Brian's (the baby's biological father) interference in raising their son. Others such as Makyla Smith (Daphne) and Jack Wetherall (Uncle Vic) add plenty of charm to a storyline that many might find hard to accept, especially when it deals with the show's soft-core depictions of gay sex.Regardless of your tolerance level, QAF is as enjoyable and enthralling as many of today's cable series. Similar to a gay version of &quot;Sex and the City,&quot; QAF has plenty of quality material not to only open eyes, but to stir mouths. For conservatives out there, I recommend them watching QAF as folk to have a comprehension of what gay culture and drug use are really like in today's America. For parents dealing with the coming out of their children, I recommend it due to storyline revolving around Justin's coming out to his parents (Sherry Miller does an excellent job of playing Justin's understanding mother) and their reaction to accepting it. Maybe by doing so, they will have a better view on the subject before casting judgment on those who are involved in it. Once again, this show is not recommended for those who cannot stomach graphic depictions of gay sex and full frontal nudity.",5,Realistic to the Third Power,1010966400,"01 14, 2002",2002,3615,"['When', 'slogan', 'cable', 'television', 'Showtime', 'network', 'definitely', 'quot', 'limits.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'quot', 'quot', 'QAF', 'quot', 'short', 'was', 'introduced', 'network', 'lineup', 'January', '2001', 'Following', 'first', 'community-oriented', 'series', 'quot', 'Soul', 'Food', 'quot', 'aimed', 'African-Americans', 'quot', 'Resurrection', 'Boulevard', 'quot', 'Latinos', 'QAF', 'was', 'first', 'gay', 'serial', 'debut', 'American', 'television.Based', 'popular', 'yet', 'controversial', 'British', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'QAF', 'pioneering', 'achievement', 'network', 'programming', 'rise', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', '1990s', 'gay-themed', 'series', 'would', 'been', 'unheard', 'United', 'States', 'European', 'Australian/New', 'Zealander', 'counterparts', 'American', 'audiences', 'tended', 'remain', 'very', 'closed', 'depictions', 'gay', 'subculture', 'decades', 'However', 'emergence', 'gay', 'culture', 'promotion', 'media', 'e.g.', 'Madonna', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'etc', 'QAF', 'debuted', 'time', 'tolerance', 'was', 'becoming', 'part', 'mainstream', 'culture.The', 'show', 'place', 'Pittsburgh', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Toronto', 'Canada', 'QAF', 'four', 'gay', 'friends', 'Michael', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'manager', 'local', 'department', 'store', 'Brian', 'played', 'excellently', 'newcomer', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'heartless', 'nymphomaniac', 'yet', 'very', 'misunderstood', 'advertisement', 'executive', 'Ted', 'played', 'adorable', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'businessman', 'who', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'finally', 'Emmett', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'flamboyant', 'retail', 'worker', 'funniest', 'lines', 'ever', 'heard.After', 'series', 'events', 'local', 'gay', 'club', 'Babylon', 'Justin', 'Randy', 'Harrison', '17', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'who', 'starting', 'debut', 'Pittsburgh', 'gay', 'scene', 'fifth', 'member', 'quartet', 'pouring', 'affection', 'devotion', 'unwanting', 'selfish', 'Brian', 'Ted', 'who', 'secretly', 'love', 'Michael', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'accidental', 'overdose', 'Emmett', 'hysterical', 'inspirational', 'output', 'balancing', 'events', 'friend', 'lives', 'Michael', 'deals', 'homophobia', 'work', 'meeting', 'new', 'love.Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'handful', 'women', 'who', 'provide', 'support', 'male', 'counterparts', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'television', 'quot', 'Cagney', 'Lacey', 'quot', 'Debbie', 'Novotny', 'Michael', 'mother', 'humor', 'grace', 'show', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'Melanie', 'Clunie', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'face', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'raising', 'newborn', 'son', 'distance', 'caused', 'Brian', 'baby', 'biological', 'father', 'interference', 'raising', 'son', 'Others', 'such', 'Makyla', 'Smith', 'Daphne', 'Jack', 'Wetherall', 'Uncle', 'Vic', 'add', 'plenty', 'charm', 'storyline', 'many', 'might', 'find', 'hard', 'accept', 'especially', 'when', 'show', 'soft-core', 'depictions', 'gay', 'sex.Regardless', 'tolerance', 'level', 'QAF', 'enjoyable', 'enthralling', 'many', 'today', 'cable', 'series', 'Similar', 'gay', 'version', 'quot', 'Sex', 'City', 'quot', 'QAF', 'plenty', 'quality', 'material', 'not', 'only', 'open', 'eyes', 'stir', 'mouths', 'conservatives', 'there', 'recommend', 'watching', 'QAF', 'folk', 'have', 'comprehension', 'what', 'gay', 'culture', 'drug', 'use', 'are', 'really', 'today', 'America', 'parents', 'dealing', 'coming', 'children', 'recommend', 'due', 'storyline', 'revolving', 'Justin', 'coming', 'out', 'parents', 'Sherry', 'Miller', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'Justin', 'understanding', 'mother', 'reaction', 'accepting', 'Maybe', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'view', 'subject', 'casting', 'judgment', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'Once', 'again', 'show', 'not', 'recommended', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stomach', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'gay', 'sex', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity']",Queer as Folk: Season 1

What a roller-coaster ride! You can tell these actors (and writers) are trying to define themselves through all the changes, crises, and relationships.The storyline involving Michael and Dr. David was so compelling, romantic and realistic.  You could tell the producers realized they had a winner with Chris Potter (David)- extending the stay of a seemingly two episode character into a whole season. He just &quot;electrified&quot; each scene he walked into. It broke my heart to watch his and Michael's relationship progress, knowing it couldn't possibly work out.

679896,A2R9J5LULVKF6T,B00005RIY5,Michael T. Rognlien,"[36, 37]","Let's face it - gays in television are stereotyped.  Jack, on Will & Grace, is what I'd imagine many people in straight America envision gay men to be - queeny, vapid, self-obsessed and sexually compulsive.. yet in a very G-rated way.I originally bought the British version of QAF (series 1) and while I enjoyed it, it lacked a certain believability for me, possibly because of the various cultural differences and overall attitude towards homosexuality in Europe.The American version, however, I held off on purchasing, mainly because I didn't want to be fed 22 hours of stereotypes of gay men and lesbians that had absolutely no reflection of my personal experience.Indeed, the first couple of episodes turned me off - cliche, sex-obsessed, and bitter overtones were almost too much to get past, but fortunately, I did.The remaining 19-20 episodes of season one, in many ways, hit very close to home.  Set in a real-ish city (P'burg), I felt immediately that the characters were in a ""real"" setting, unlike the world of Ross, Rachel and the gang in ""Friends"" - although the characters, at first blush, seemed to be slices of gay male stereotypes we've all seen before.  The beauty of this show is the extensive character development, and the patience required of the audience to let their individual characteristics sink in.Justin's childish infatuation with Brian grew from highly annoying to palpable and real; the various love triangles (Michael and Brian, Ted and Michael, Brian and nobody) became plausible.  The issues in the relationships were real without being patronizing (commitment-phobia, drugs, unfaithfulness, etc) and developed WELL beyond the fleeting banality of the 30-minute relationships we're given via the girls on Sex in the City.All in all, I was won over completely - and the finale of episode 22 even convinced me that Brian, the character I hated the most of all, was, deep down, likeable and even plausible.  The beauty of the range of characters here is that there's a part (or parts) of each of them that to some degree reflect the realities of what it's like to be a gay man in the new millenium.This is indeed groundbreaking television, though not because of the rather graphic sexuality it depicts, but because, for the first time (in my opinion), gay life is examined for ALL things - not just the drama and the materialism, but for the difficulty of balancing the unique social constructs of life in a straight world with the sometimes life-altering (and even life-saving) friendships and relationships that make for a truly diverse community.  Cheers to the Americans for finally getting one right (and to Showtime for having the guts to make it happen)!",5,I really did NOT want to like this show.,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2693,"['Let', 'face', 'gays', 'television', 'are', 'stereotyped', 'Jack', 'Will', 'Grace', 'what', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'many', 'people', 'straight', 'America', 'envision', 'gay', 'men', 'be', 'queeny', 'vapid', 'self-obsessed', 'sexually', 'compulsive..', 'yet', 'very', 'G-rated', 'way.I', 'originally', 'bought', 'British', 'version', 'QAF', 'series', '1', 'enjoyed', 'lacked', 'certain', 'believability', 'possibly', 'various', 'cultural', 'differences', 'overall', 'attitude', 'towards', 'homosexuality', 'Europe.The', 'American', 'version', 'however', 'held', 'off', 'purchasing', 'mainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'fed', '22', 'hours', 'stereotypes', 'gay', 'men', 'lesbians', 'had', 'absolutely', 'reflection', 'personal', 'experience.Indeed', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'turned', 'off', 'cliche', 'sex-obsessed', 'bitter', 'overtones', 'were', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'get', 'past', 'fortunately', 'did.The', 'remaining', '19-20', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'many', 'ways', 'hit', 'very', 'close', 'home', 'Set', 'real-ish', 'city', ""P'burg"", 'felt', 'immediately', 'characters', 'were', 'real', 'setting', 'world', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'gang', 'Friends', 'characters', 'first', 'blush', 'seemed', 'be', 'slices', 'gay', 'male', 'stereotypes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'beauty', 'show', 'extensive', 'character', 'development', 'patience', 'required', 'audience', 'let', 'individual', 'characteristics', 'sink', 'in.Justin', 'childish', 'infatuation', 'Brian', 'grew', 'highly', 'annoying', 'palpable', 'real', 'various', 'love', 'triangles', 'Michael', 'Brian', 'Ted', 'Michael', 'Brian', 'nobody', 'became', 'plausible', 'issues', 'relationships', 'were', 'real', 'being', 'patronizing', 'commitment-phobia', 'drugs', 'unfaithfulness', 'etc', 'developed', 'WELL', 'fleeting', 'banality', '30-minute', 'relationships', ""'re"", 'given', 'girls', 'Sex', 'City.All', 'was', 'won', 'over', 'completely', 'finale', 'episode', '22', 'even', 'convinced', 'Brian', 'character', 'hated', 'most', 'was', 'deep', 'down', 'likeable', 'even', 'plausible', 'beauty', 'range', 'characters', 'here', 'part', 'parts', 'degree', 'reflect', 'realities', 'what', 'be', 'gay', 'man', 'new', 'millenium.This', 'indeed', 'groundbreaking', 'television', 'not', 'rather', 'graphic', 'sexuality', 'because', 'first', 'time', 'opinion', 'gay', 'life', 'examined', 'ALL', 'things', 'not', 'just', 'drama', 'materialism', 'difficulty', 'balancing', 'unique', 'social', 'constructs', 'life', 'straight', 'world', 'sometimes', 'life-altering', 'even', 'life-saving', 'friendships', 'relationships', 'make', 'truly', 'diverse', 'community', 'Cheers', 'Americans', 'finally', 'getting', 'one', 'right', 'Showtime', 'having', 'guts', 'make', 'happen']",Queer as Folk: Season 1

Watching this for the first time you are amazed by the in your face style.  On second look you notice a lot of stereotypes that are not flattering.2. Once again all the cast are great looking.  Let's see some average guys and girls.  The only time you see an average looking or worse person is when they need to make a joke.3. This is a gay fantasy land.  Places like this do not exist in the real USA and especially for a city like Pittsburgh.4. If this show was on HBO instead of Showtime it would have reapped many Emmy nominations - especially Sharon Gless.What I am saying is this is not the holy grail of gay entertainment but the first season was excellent.DVD EXTRAS:Disc One - Special Edition Episode 1: This is not just a commentary track but when the commentary is being made the person appears on the side.  This is unusual but very interesting. (Michelle Clunie's commentaries are funny because she is still in character.)Disc Three - Special Edition Episode 11: Same as above with Sharon Gless as part of the mix.Disc Five - Special Edition Episode 18: Same as above.Disc Six -Extended Scenes Introduced by Hal Sparks: 17 minutes of deleted scenes and extended scenes.  As I always say, having introductions or commentary on these scenes is always desirable.Behind the Scenes Outtakes: Six Minutes of OuttakesMeet the Folk:Characters - sort of like if they were filling out a profile on a dating web site for the top eight characters with each actor giving a 30 second to one minute interview about the character.Actors - Standard actor biosProduction Team - Standard creator bios with video clips of the producers.Season 2 Sneak Preview - A five minute preview of the second season.

It is hot and daring and in your face. It was not afraid to push the envelope and that was great. Brian Kinney is the main man. He is honest about his life and doesnt make apoligies. Michael is different than i expected. In some ways i think that justin is about as mature as Michael if not more. It was the whole comic book thing. Justin is a mystery to me. I never got what it was about him that made Brian 'keep' him around. If you know then please tell me. Ted reminded me of Kevin Spacey when i first saw him. Am i the only one? I LOVE Emmett. He is so hilarious. You cant help but love him. QAF delt with serious issues and also managed to make you laugh. My favorite scene in the first season was at Justin's prom. When he and Brian danced.

I could invite you to watch sex scenes like you've never seen on TV, or I could go on and on praising ""Queer as Folk"" as a controversial TV show that makes the girls of ""Sex and the City"" look like school girls. ""Queer as Folk"" is all this, but much, much more. By the end of season one, and once the initial shock wears off, you will find yourself actually watching this show not because of the sex it's not afraid to show, but because of the plights and emotional conflicts of its characters.The three main characters are probably meant to represent a cross-section of gay culture - Hal Sparks plays the ""sensitive narrator"" role, Gale Harold is Brian, the predator, and Randy Harrison plays Justin, the virgin. Also, there are Emmett and Ted, and also Melanie and Lindsay, the lesbian couple... The list goes on and on, but the good thing is that the stereotypical concept fades out during the show - ""Queer as Folk"" treats its characters like actual, emotional humans, who evolve as the show progresses. It can make a powerful emotional punch as well as a sex scene, and that is what makes this show so good. The fact that it makes you care for the characters because of who they are, and not simply because they're gay is the biggest praise I can give this excellent show.

I mean, I was totally hooked after watching the first episode--if not, after watching the first minute!!!I found myself liking all of the characters instantly and I liked how most of the characters are all connected to each other in one way or the other, like how Emmett and Michael are roommates.  Ted is secretly in love with Michael.  And how even though Michael and Brian are best friends, Michael, in his own way has a thing for Brian and Brian, in my opinion, has a thing for Michael--even though Brian's never going to admit that.I also liked the overall tone of the show. And how it could somehow balance itself with having a scene go in one direction towards the outrageous (insert Brian here) and then how it could go in a very down to earth, very human and touching direction (also, insert Brian here.)I guess I just have a thing for the Brian character and though how on the surface, he might be plotting and making everything be all about him--you just have to wait for the moments when it's just him and Michael and you get a glimpse that there's a whole lot more cooking with him.To get an example of this, please see the episode wherein the fellas are heading out to New York to find Justin, who's run away.  There's a moment, when the car gets a flat and Emmett and Ted have to fix it and Brian and Michael sneak away to share a joint.As the scene unfolds, Brian tells Michael how much he means to him.  And then before you know it, the two of them are kissing.But that's not the part, that gets to you. It's how when Ted & Emmett start telling them that the car is ready, it's like Brian holds onto Michael maybe a little longer than he has to and while doing this, Brian at this point kisses Michael on the forehead.  That one little scene tells you just how human Brian really is.  (Incidentally, those were always my favorite scenes throughout the show--the little moments that were quiet and unassuming--you might have to really look for them, but man are they worth it!)  :)Anyway, I can't say enough about this show.  I hope everyone out there who hasn't watched this show, will give it a try.  I think you'll be very surprised in more ways than one.I know I was!(Also, a BIG shout out to the phenomenal Hal Sparks!!!)  What he gave to the character Michael was truly amazing!!!

You'll wish you actually be his friend. All of the other actors are great too. There are some things I don't like about this show though. One being the opening. It displays a disgusting show of beefy men in tiny shorts and they are dancing around to horrible music with terrible music playing. They're awful dancers too. All the flashing colors probably make many unsuspecting people go into seizures. I also don't like the drug use in this show. Even Michael uses.

I admire the producers of the first season for their guts and willpower to bring this project to completion.The DVD is nothing short of a collector's item if only because this series is already a classic. The series, of course, are phenomenal. The first few episodes are based on the UK script, but the story was extended (and changed), for which we should be grateful. The US actors are enormously talented (this can not be said for some actors in the UK series), which makes the series all the more enjoyable to watch.Essentially, the story is a soap opera. It just happens to focus on gay people and it just happens to contain a lot of sex. Neither of which are bad, in my opinion. TV needs much more diversity - it is entertainment after all, and should be a reflection of life and all its glories. What is surprising (for US TV) is not that the sex is gay sex, but quite how explicitly it's shown. But that isn't the most important aspect. The characters are. Because the characters are captivating and real, a viewer gets hooked on them and the story. And this is the real value of the series.The DVD provides additional entertainment - apart the obvious capability for frame by frame replay (forgive me, I couldn't resist), it also has some extras on it. Hal (David) talks us through some scenes that were cut, and you get little interview clips of the actors, biographies of the characters and more.It's one of those things you can watch over and over again, without getting bored.

679906,AYWIO6OYAGFGQ,B00005RIY5,"pm444 ""pm444""","[5, 5]","Though I'm older than most of the people who make up the ensemble cast of this series, it still resonates with me more than anything I've ever seen, on TV or film.  The most important thing that QAF does, for me anyway, is to present a segment of contemporary gay life in a context that is non-judgmental, non-apologetic, and that transcends simple stereotypes.  By the time you've watched the second or third episode, the sexual orientation of the characters is not the primary thing you're thinking about.  And unlike ""Will and Grace"" (a good enough show as far as network TV goes), the gayness of the characters is not what drives every single storyline.Yes, there's a lot of graphic sexual activity, but that is not the only thing that this series is all about.  Instead, it's about the intertwined lives of a group of people who happen to be gay, but whose basic wants and needs are the same as anyone else's.  It's true that they sometimes seek to meet these needs in ways that appear to be self-defeating (excessive use of drugs, sexual encounters with no emotional connection, etc.), but that happens with straight people, too. It's also true that they spend a lot of time talking about their relationships, which of course includes a lot of talk about sex, but again, is that a uniquely gay phenomenon?The over-riding theme that the viewer gets is that these people have created a unique (if somewhat dysfunctional) family for themselves.  This is a theme that is familiar to most gay men and women from their own lives, and one that has been written about and portrayed in movies going back to the 1970s classic ""Boys in the Band"". What's so powerfully different about QAF is that it does this without all of the self-hatred that characterized older portrayals of gay life.  Whatever problems these people may have, they are more at peace with their gayness than preceding generations.  You can see it even within the group itself.  Seventeen-year-old Justin outs himself to his parents in terms that are as explicit and honest as anything you've heard, far more so than his friends in their late 20's would have done.This is not to say that these people don't experience blatant homophobia as well as more subtle forms of discrimination, because the show tackles these issue head-on, and in most cases, the characters confront these problems with strength and pride.But QAF is not just a political statement about gay pride, it's great entertainment.  The acting is consistently solid, rising to heights not often seen on network TV.  With a series of subplots and relationships that develop and shift over time, the viewer comes to know the characters and in most cases, to honestly care about them.  At first glance, they may appear to be one-dimensional and often shallow.  But each of them is far more complex than they seem.There have been complaints that there's not enough air-time given to Melanie and Lindsay, the lesbian couple, but they are essential characters who are involved in all of the main plot lines.The show is characterized by excellent production with innovative camera work (the way the camera ""ramps"" in for some of the close-ups is used to great effect), though there are a fair number of scenes that would benefit from better lighting.The DVD set is nicely packaged with good labeling of each disc's contents.  The widescreen format looks great on my 27"" TV in letterbox format.  The extra material is good and navigation is fairly intuitive.  So far I've only encountered two minor flaws on disc 3; it played fine and did not lock up or skip, but there were two brief moments where the picture broke up.",5,"Finally, a dramatic series that is unapologetically gay",1013212800,"02 9, 2002",2002,3642,"[""'m"", 'older', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'series', 'still', 'more', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'film', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'QAF', 'anyway', 'present', 'segment', 'contemporary', 'gay', 'life', 'context', 'non-judgmental', 'non-apologetic', 'simple', 'stereotypes', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'second', 'third', 'episode', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'characters', 'not', 'primary', 'thing', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'Will', 'Grace', 'good', 'enough', 'show', 'as', 'far', 'network', 'TV', 'gayness', 'characters', 'not', 'what', 'single', 'storyline.Yes', 'lot', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'activity', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'series', 'about', 'Instead', 'intertwined', 'lives', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'gay', 'basic', 'needs', 'are', 'same', 'anyone', 'else', 'true', 'sometimes', 'seek', 'meet', 'needs', 'ways', 'appear', 'be', 'self-defeating', 'excessive', 'use', 'drugs', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'emotional', 'connection', 'etc', 'straight', 'people', 'too', 'also', 'true', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'talking', 'relationships', 'course', 'lot', 'talk', 'sex', 'again', 'uniquely', 'gay', 'phenomenon', 'over-riding', 'theme', 'viewer', 'people', 'have', 'created', 'unique', 'somewhat', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'theme', 'familiar', 'most', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'own', 'lives', 'one', 'been', 'written', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'going', 'back', '1970s', 'classic', 'Boys', 'Band', 'What', 'so', 'powerfully', 'different', 'QAF', 'self-hatred', 'characterized', 'older', 'portrayals', 'gay', 'life', 'problems', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'are', 'more', 'peace', 'gayness', 'preceding', 'generations', 'can', 'see', 'even', 'group', 'Seventeen-year-old', 'Justin', 'parents', 'terms', 'are', 'explicit', 'honest', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'far', 'more', 'so', 'friends', 'late', '20', 'would', 'have', 'done.This', 'not', 'say', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'experience', 'blatant', 'homophobia', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'subtle', 'forms', 'discrimination', 'show', 'issue', 'head-on', 'most', 'cases', 'characters', 'confront', 'problems', 'strength', 'pride.But', 'QAF', 'not', 'just', 'political', 'statement', 'gay', 'pride', 'great', 'entertainment', 'acting', 'consistently', 'solid', 'rising', 'heights', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'network', 'TV', 'series', 'subplots', 'relationships', 'develop', 'shift', 'time', 'viewer', 'know', 'characters', 'most', 'cases', 'honestly', 'care', 'first', 'glance', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'one-dimensional', 'often', 'shallow', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'seem.There', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'not', 'enough', 'air-time', 'given', 'Melanie', 'Lindsay', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'are', 'essential', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'main', 'plot', 'lines.The', 'show', 'characterized', 'excellent', 'production', 'innovative', 'camera', 'work', 'way', 'camera', 'ramps', 'close-ups', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'are', 'fair', 'number', 'scenes', 'would', 'benefit', 'better', 'lighting.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'good', 'labeling', 'disc', 'contents', 'widescreen', 'format', 'great', '27', 'TV', 'letterbox', 'format', 'extra', 'material', 'good', 'navigation', 'fairly', 'intuitive', 'far', ""'ve"", 'only', 'encountered', 'two', 'minor', 'flaws', 'disc', '3', 'played', 'fine', 'did', 'not', 'lock', 'up', 'skip', 'were', 'two', 'brief', 'moments', 'where', 'picture', 'broke', 'up']",Queer as Folk: Season 1
679907,AIRHRV3D8X4J1,B00005RIY5,"Porfie Medina ""Porfie Jr. Medina""","[16, 20]","Queer As Folk is one of the most amazing TV Shows ever and is a landmark as the show for the new millennium. The Queer As Folk DVD Box Set has all 22 episodes of the first season of the most controversial and bravest series in the history of television. The total running time of all 6 DVD's is approx: 1,205 minutes which includes Bonus features such as: behind the scenes outtakes, deleted scenes, special edition episodes, a Photo Gallery, DVD rom extras, A 6 minute Season 2 Sneek Peek, and much more. Queer As Folk shows the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. Now I had been hearing so much about this amazing Showtime series for sometime, yet I had never seen a single episode as I did not have Showtime, but then in July of 2001 I heard this show was coming to DVD in its entire first season and I knew I was in for a real treat. I waited up until the very day of Queer As Folks release date on January 8, 2002 and I purchased this DVD collection not knowing what to expect. I knew it was a gamble to buy an expensive DVD collection of something I had never seen before, but I went with my heart and I bought it. I can honestly say this was truly one of the BEST DVD investments I have ever made. When I got home I knew it was gonna be a while before i watched all 22 episodes and as i got through the first 2 pilot episodes I was hooked and so excited to see the next episode, just as I am when I watch The Young And The Restless. It took me 3 days to watch all of the episodes and I am amazed at how honest this show is on dealing with gay life. Queer As Folk makes no apologies and thats what is so great about this series. From the graphic fornification scenes to the drama of dealing with the prejudice that still haunts America, this show is so brave and I give Showtime a big thumbs up for having the gaul to take on such a big risk as Queer As Folk. This show is as close as it gets to real life. This is not a show just for gay people, but for ALL people. It deals with human emotion and thats something we can all relate to whether we be straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, brown or in between. I have since signed up for Showtime just for this show. I encourage anyone who has a open mind and a open heart to BUY this amazing DVD collection as it will inspire you and if nothing else open your mind to a lifestyle not as uncommon as you may think.

The depiction of gay people has seemed to go in one of two directions: outrageous or subtle. ""Queer as Folk"" is outrageous, and may have some stereotypical characters, but each one has a special distinction.  A colleague loaned me season One, and I watched it over a period of about 3 weeks. Not sure what to expect, I was almost immediately absorbed into the lives of these people. I enjoyed every episode completely. There's a lot of truth being conveyed, and it becomes a battle of which character you like the most. I liked Ted. Michael was endearing; Brian was reprehensible; Elliott was amusing (and wise); Justin is typically head-strong and adorable. The Lesbian sub-plot involves a wonderful scenario which is inter-weaved with all the other characters. I liked Ted the best; after years of disappointment, he is suspicious of affection, and has a deep alterior side that accepts life perhaps more objectively than the rest. The realist of the bunch, but as a human, he makes the most dumb choices.  Acting is uniformly excellent. The only ""big name"" in the cast is Sharon Gless, as Michael's pro-gay mother; also her brother is HIV positive and lives with her. I guess I don't need to say this stuff cuz if you're reading this, you already know. I was absorbed and intrigued by every episode; the sweetness as well as the seediness is explored. Hatred and homophobia are also well examined. Wonderful characters and writing make me look forward to watching Season 2. Let's give some time to the Queer community.

679909,ACIJVXJWC1SJO,B00005RIY5,R. Geatz,"[4, 5]","I really fell for the original British version of Queer as Folk when it was released on DVD.  When I heard that an American version was in the works, I was not optimistic.  Usually Americanized remakes of European movies are much inferior to the originals.  However, after watching the first couple dics of the first season of the American ""QaF,"" I was pleasantly suprised.  The casting is at least as good as the British series (although the brit cast was much more believeable as working class lads than the Yanks are as blue-collar Pittsburghers), and you quickly become attached to these characters--even with their many human flaws.  Much of the plot and dialogue is lifted directly from the original series--with minor Americanizing changes.  And for me, the weakness of the U.S. series shows most when they deviate from the original.  The ""new"" plot twists are often unbelievable and teter on the absurd--like one character uncharacteristically joining an ""aversion therapy"" group that is populated by poorly conceived stereotypes that cause the sequence to lose its impact. And writing for the new material just isn't as strong.  And then there is the ""artistic license""--can anyone REALLY believe that Pittsburgh has a gay ghetto that seems to rival West Hollywood, complete with hoards of drag queens marching down the streets and couples having anonymous sex around every corner?  At times, it feels like this series is from the pre-AIDS era and isn't really a reflection of contemporary gay life.  The fact that it is produced and written my middle-aged gays, like myself, probably explains the occasional anachronistic tone--but it's also probably why my partner and I relate to it.  Anyway... if you can overlook occasional lapses in believability, you should really enjoy this series.  I can't wait for season two to come out on DVD (even though I hear that it's weaker than season one).",4,Nearly as good as its British inspiration,1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,1902,"['really', 'fell', 'original', 'British', 'version', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'When', 'heard', 'American', 'version', 'was', 'works', 'was', 'not', 'optimistic', 'Usually', 'Americanized', 'remakes', 'European', 'movies', 'are', 'much', 'inferior', 'originals', 'However', 'watching', 'first', 'couple', 'dics', 'first', 'season', 'American', 'QaF', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'suprised', 'casting', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'British', 'series', 'brit', 'cast', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'believeable', 'working', 'class', 'lads', 'Yanks', 'are', 'blue-collar', 'Pittsburghers', 'quickly', 'become', 'attached', 'characters', 'even', 'many', 'human', 'flaws', 'Much', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'lifted', 'directly', 'original', 'series', 'minor', 'Americanizing', 'changes', 'weakness', 'U.S.', 'series', 'most', 'when', 'deviate', 'original', 'new', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'often', 'unbelievable', 'teter', 'absurd', 'one', 'character', 'uncharacteristically', 'joining', 'aversion', 'therapy', 'group', 'populated', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'stereotypes', 'cause', 'sequence', 'lose', 'impact', 'writing', 'new', 'material', 'just', ""n't"", 'strong', 'then', 'artistic', 'license', 'can', 'anyone', 'REALLY', 'believe', 'Pittsburgh', 'gay', 'ghetto', 'rival', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'complete', 'hoards', 'drag', 'queens', 'marching', 'down', 'streets', 'couples', 'having', 'anonymous', 'sex', 'corner', 'times', 'series', 'pre-AIDS', 'era', ""n't"", 'really', 'reflection', 'contemporary', 'gay', 'life', 'fact', 'produced', 'written', 'middle-aged', 'gays', 'probably', 'occasional', 'anachronistic', 'tone', 'also', 'probably', 'why', 'partner', 'relate', 'Anyway', 'can', 'overlook', 'occasional', 'lapses', 'believability', 'should', 'really', 'enjoy', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'two', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'even', 'hear', 'weaker', 'season', 'one']",Queer as Folk: Season 1

I was sincerely hoping that the makers would put this series out on video/DVD but I was a bit skeptical since it contained 22 episodes.  But now that they are going to I am so happy!Queer as Folk is based on the so called ""hit"" British TV show which I loathed and then some when I first saw it last year.  I found it pretentious, over the top and sensational.  None of the characters were likable and more to the point it did nothing but re-enforce the negative stereotype I had about gay men; mostly that they were irresponsible and mysoginistics.In fact the only positive thing that came out of that series was this one!  In fact I've learned more positive things about gays from this show than I have from all the gay activists and mainstream gay tv shows combined.  That is because in QAFUSA there is no name calling, and no preaching about how much gays need to be loved.  What we instead get is the portrayal of seven gay people who are shown with their flaws and virtues.  But unlike other soap operas at least these virtues and flaws are not superficial or over the top (ie. Drugs and alcohol).The show involves a series of five gay men and two lesbians women living in Pittsburgh (but filmed in Toronto).  And covers their everyday lives. And when I say everyday lives I mean everyday lives. QAF manages to achieve what previous nighttime soaps could only dream of.  Instead of simply focusing on bed hopping and greed for money.  The show actually looks in depth at the characters including personal hang-ups, and personal maturity.  This show is hailed as a gay soap opera, but it is different from other gay shows I have seen.  There is no self-hatred at least based on being gay.  For example the character Brian is cold and arrogant and deep down unhappy, most other directors would have attributed this to ""the big bad homophobic world"".  Not so with QAFUSA they have decided to be a bit more universal story.  The reason for Brian's attitude is due to the rejection he received growing up from his alcoholic father (who by the way did not know he was gay until later).  Which also explains his promiscuity.  I don't think that Brian is lubricious persay.  Its' obvious that he loves (or cares) for Justin, it's  just that he's terrified of being rejected. Sexual conquests are far easier than allowing himself to fall in love.Michael is out to his gay friends and family but is not out to the rest of the world and in fact seems to feel slightly uncomfortable being so. I think that this has less to do with being ashamed of his being gay.  Than it does of him not wanting to be seen as outside the norm. A feeling a think that many gays and lesbians feelI also like admire the show for it responsibility.  Another original tack was in the ex-gay arc, whereas most other creators would have used this as an occasion to attack Christians and Christian teachings, The creators responsibly shy away from naming any religion at all, and just stick to the story that God loves everyone.One of the reasons I love this show is that I can actually relate to the characters. The show covers relation issues, employment issues, extended family issues and basically the value we place on ourselves as people.  This is a show for people of all backgrounds. Both homosexual and heterosexual.  But most of all I think it primarily is aimed at us generation X-sers those of us who were born in the late 60's and early 70's who live over here in North America.  Since for a lot of North Americans 20 somethings there seems to a delayed adolescence. A lot of the show (without being preachy) tackles the symbolism of growing up (i.e. Entering your 30's) and the personal change that goes with it in that it is time to grow up and face responsibilities as an adult.The actors, while not the Royal Shakespear company, do a passable job and convey what they were hired to do. The male and female characters play very well to each other. I even found that I have a big crush on Brian (Gale Harold) even though he's arrogant and cold--not my usual choice!.  I would not be honest if I did not admit that I do partly like this show for sexist reasons.  Had it been a heterosexual soap opera where Brian was cold and brutal to women, or where Ted turned down women his age for being too ""old"". I may not have enjoyed it that much.  One minor quibble  I find the sex scenes overdrawn and a bit too gratutous. Buy it's nothing that can't be forwarded fasted through.As far as I'm concerned Queer as Folk- USA beats  ""The Sopranos"" and ""Sex in the City"" hands down and it certainly eclipses the British version by a mile.  Take it from one of the last people on earth who should be enjoying this kind of thing.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[2, 3]","Addicted after watching the pilot episode, it did not take me long to cruise through the first season ofQUEER AS FOLK on DVD. Kudos to Showtime for airing this daring and provocative show following the lives of five gay men in Pittsburgh. It certainly takes guts in the midst of the Conservative Christian Front moving across the United States. Behind the frank sexual scenes real issues affecting the gay community are portrayed: gay bashing, drug abuse, outing, and AIDS just to name a few.Brian Kinney is a man you love to hate. Being a sexual predator and avid drug user he is all out for himself and has virtual no regards for others, yet he constantly has a following of devoted friends surrounding him. Justin is the high school baby fag who loves to thrust is sexuality in everyone&#65533;s face while chasing after Brian. Micheal is Brian&#65533;s best friend since high school and a comic book collector. Ted is an accountant who is low on self-esteem. Emmett is the flaming fashion diva who has enough self-worth for both Ted and himself. All five meet regularly at the gym/diner/Babylon to discuss their daily problems while cruising the gorgeous men around them. They are the epitome of gay male culture: anonymous sex and obsession with the perfect male body while drinking and using drugs.Although QUEER AS FOLK is revolutionary it&#65533;s not perfect. Randy Harrison&#65533;s (Justin) acting ability can be improved and Hall Sparks (Michael) does have a tendency to whine and complain. More disturbing, the constant battering of lesbians is very worrying and taxing. Each character pokes fun of lesbians but doesn&#65533;t hesitate to rely on their help in dire times of need. No wonder many of my lesbian friends refuse to watch this show.

We both LOVED the show!  Over the course of a week, we watched all 22 episodes, often curled up on the couch.  Sometimes laughing hysterically, sometimes on the verge of tears, many times yelling with indignation at what was happening onscreen.  But through it all, just enjoying the show.It's definitely nothing like my life, or anyone I know for that matter.  So it was quite interesting to see the boys spend night after night at Babylon, cruising for the latest trick, or partaking of the latest drug of choice.  Despite that, what makes the show truly enjoyable is the fact that these guys and girls are a group of close friends who know all about each other.  Michael is constantly waiting around for Brian, literally and emotionally, much to everyone's disgust.  But every once in awhile their ""best friends"" love for each other does come out.  Emmett is definitely a flamer (and looks great in pink by the way), and is just a truly caring friend to everyone.  Debbie, Michael's PFLAG mom, is probably my favorite, as she loves her son and his friends unconditionally and completely . . . even if it embarasses them all.  All the others just create a real family, and following their many, many ups and downs is just awesome.I personally know many people who will be turned off by the blatant showing of sex, drugs, and flaunting of the ""gay lifestyle.""  But those make this ""real life"", as it was intended.  And there is so much more to the show, demonstrating true friendship through thick and thin.

679921,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B00005RIY5,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[2, 2]","It took me awhile to discover ""Queer as Folk"". I had heard rumblings that Showtime was going to do a one hour weekly series on gay life in America, but I thought it would be poorly written and cheaply produced. So, after the first season nearly came to a close I sat down and watched the season finale after being prodded by friends to watch it. What I saw was jaw-dropping and the best piece of television work I have ever seen. It was also the most honest portrayal of homosexuality ever depicted on the screen. I was totally blown away, so much so I watched ""Queer as Folk"" the entire summer of 2001 while the show was in reruns and discovered my new best friends. The show explored many timely topics in that first season from coming out to a young gay boys first sexual experience.Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman, who created and wrote ""Sisters' for NBC and wrote ""An Early Frost"", which dramatized AIDS way back in 1985, adapted ""Queer as Folk"" from Britain, where it ran for 2 season as a mini-series of sorts. I saw the British version and the American one outshines the former in all areas from the writing to the acting. Gale Harold, as Brian, the guy we all want to be, is unapologetic, and is a sexual predator, who discovers Justin on his first night on Liberty Avenue, the gay district of Pittsburg where the series takes place. It is through Justin, that we as viewers, are introduced to all the characters in the series. The rest of the cast and characters are superb from Peter Paige, who plays flamboyant Emmett to Hal Sparks, who plays Micheal, Brian's best friend. Sharon Gless is a knockout as Debbie, Michael's mom who supports her son and is the greatest defender of gays anywhere.The series is extremely well-written with the writers not being timid in their depiction of gay life. During the run of the first season we see scenes that show a lot of drug use and guys having sex with each other. This is an attempt to hook the audience, and before long you realize the show is depicting what gay life is. We also see Micheal getting involved with a doctor, Debbie dealing with her brother being HIV positive, and the wonderful portrayal of lesbians trying to raise a family and have a career. The just of the show is the relationship between Brian and Justin, and how Brian continues to pull away, and we also see Justin coming out to his parents, and ultimately we witness his father disowning him. The best episode is when Brian's father dies and we watch him finally erasing him out of his life once and for all, as we realize the reason Brian is the way he is.The first year features 22 amazing episodes, all produced in wide screen format with excellent audio.

679923,A3KBG7E1XSNTYC,B00005RIY5,T. Jackson,"[1, 1]","Queer As Folk is my favorite television show of all time. As a gay man, it's the only show that's ever been on the air that somewhat accurately reflects my life experience.  This was definitely my life when I was in my twenties up to about my mid-thirties, which is the age span of the characters.  I lived in the gay bars back than and I had friends like the flamboyant fashion victim Emmett, the sweetheart, Michael, the hot, edgy bad boy Brian, the true romantic, Justin and the nerdy Ted. I've known a few moms of gay friends who had a little of Debbie in them, though none were quite as extreme. Sure the characters are exaggerated, but that makes them all the more fun.In the first season, the characters can be a bit stereotyped but they all grow and evolve through the five seasons of this show.  This is a show with true heart and it celebrates life, love and friendship.  Don't we all wish we had a group of friends as tight knit as these?  Or a mom as supportive and understanding as Debbie?Many of the situations are very true to life, though some do venture off into fantasy land, especially some of Brian's sexual escapades.  Also, the producers are middle aged and I see their experiences in the storylines.  Some of the storylines were outdated for the time the show aired.  Most gay bars don't have back rooms any more and I don't see the crowds in gay bars being as unified and community-oriented as they seemed ""back in the day.""That said, this is a very warm, heartfelt show that will leave you wanting more.

679924,A2A1HDK1NXG1S2,B00005RIY5,"turtlex ""turtlex""","[166, 172]","Queer As Folk - The Complete First Season - Collector's Edition DVD Boxed Set.A Showtime Original Series.This is an excellent original series featured on an outstanding DVD collection.I'll give you my condensed version: I enjoyed it a great deal. The acting is good, the stories are engaging and the characters seem real. I'm recommending it without reservation.First, the packaging of this set is top of the line. The six-disc collection is a double-sided fold-in design.  Each disc is colored with one of the rainbow pride colors-a very nice, and unexpected, touch. Also featured with this box set-a nice little rainbow pride disc place marker-it's a six-colored rainbow ribbon.Before I get into my opinions, let me say that the discs themselves, quality wise, are outstanding. I watched every last minute of the six disc set, including the special episode editions and bonus material and had flawless picture and sound throughout.Yes, I did enjoy the series.I had never seen a single scene of Queer As Folk (QAF) before I got this DVD. That's not to say I hadn't heard about it, because I had. I've read a great deal about it: the sex, the drugs, the language, the lesbian bashing, etc.What I found, upon watching it myself, was that I liked the stories and I liked the characters.It's always difficult to forget what you've read when approaching a television series like this but I did my best to just approach it with my own personal life experiences as a guide.To address the mini-points mentioned above:There's sex and a whole lot of it. Much of it anonymous and much of it graphic. All of it gay/lesbian. Was I offended? No, not at all. As a matter of fact, the shear volume of sex actually makes it less shocking. The sex depicted in the series is not there to titillate (though it probably does); it's there simply as part of a story, part of the lives of these characters. Having watched the discs in long multi-hour blocks, it actually became a little numbing, though not to say uninteresting.There's drugs and a lot of them. They're taken frequently and unapologetically. Again, they're presented as part of the story. Was I offended? Not at all.  They're not preachy about what they're presenting and not every character takes illicit drugs.""the language""-Actually this is where I get a little prudish (surprised it's with the language and not the sex?) because the mouths on these folks are trashy. I thought all the foul language was a little over the top.""the lesbian-bashing""-A little explanation here. Quite a bit of press has been dedicated to the idea that the lesbian couple in the series is verbally derided and ""bashed"" by the gay male characters. I was a little worried about this, being a lesbian myself. I was a little weary of it because after one episode, I was really enjoying the series and didn't want to get offended as things went on. I found though, that I was more than 10 hours into the series when I realized that I hadn't been offended yet, not in the least. There's some name-calling, some use of words I'm not particularly thrilled with, but much of the name calling, was done in jest. I didn't find it offensive or at all ""mean spirited"" and I was looking for it. The one time a particularly graphic word is used in a negative and angry way, it is used by one of the lesbian characters.The writer's have done a wonderful job with giving these characters expansive and full lives. These episodes deal with issues and problems:age of consent (by ignoring it), drug use (by using them), safe sex (by having it), lesbian moms (by portraying it), conversion groups (by lampooning them), school outings (by portraying them realistically), hate (by living through it), family dedication and confusion (by showing the impact of being yourself), excessive drug use (by showing the consequences).I defy you to name another series which tackles these issues. It does not feel forced; these are issues that these characters deal with.One complaint I've heard is that the ""girls"" have so little screen time. I'll remind everyone that there is a five man to two woman ratio so it's reasonable that the guys will be on screen more often. I'm just thrilled to have a lesbian couple featured at all. The fact that we get so much from them, with so little screen time, is a great indication of the fine writing and acting that we see here. For those wondering-we do get one sex scene between Melanie and Lindsay-its in episode 9.Quick comment on the season finale- This is the most amazing episode. It is incredibly moving and romantic and terrifying. I don't want to give away too much, but it was well written and well acted. You will be moved.On the believability scale-I'd give this series an ""A.The discs-some information on the discs themselves and they way they are set up.Each disc contains 3 or 4 episodes. On each disc are six chapters you can use for scene access. Featured are each episodes ""next on"" promo-a feature which I liked a lot and which I was surprised to find. Each episode also contains a small summary of what the episode is about.On disc1, disc 3 and disc 5 are ""special edition episodes"" which repeat a specific episode with commentary by the cast and producers. These are fun to watch and it's always great to hear the actor talk about the character they are portraying. These cannot, though, be watched INSTEAD of the episodes. They are strictly extra viewing. Episode 1, episode 11 and episode 18 are given this special treatment.Disc 6 contains the last three episodes (20-22) and a great collection of bonus features listed in the Amazon page.",5,Outstanding

Not only is it outstanding, but it's really a groundbreaking event in which America is FINALLY being more open to the fact that the gay world and gay lifestyles doesn't have to be seen as a big deal. The show depicts real people with real lives. And the characters are actually very intriguing, i actually feel for the them, like Justin! Not only that but the sex scenes are extremely hot and very erotic, this is far more raw, real, and edgy than Sex and the City. It's very refreshing to have QAF, and the L Word (which i dont find to be as fun, interesting, realistic, or sexy as QAF, but it's growing) be on American television.

Sharon Gless is a joy to watch, and is one of the main reasons I stuck with this show from beginning to end!
