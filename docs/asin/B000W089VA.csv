1106154,A2QHYTS231GJB3,B000W089VA,Christie W.,"[14, 19]","This series started with such promise. I enjoyed the first two movies (granted they more closely followed the books).  Janette Oke wrote such wonderful stories, I really have a hard time understanding why they would make SO many changes.  The actress who plays Missie in this movie does not act emotion very well at all.  Moments that were supposed to be serious were laughably ridiculous because of her demeanor and the faces she would make.  She made the same stern, straight-lined mouth expression for everything, whether she was supposed to be angry, happy or sad.  And I cannot believe that they killed off Willie.  He was the one redeeming character that I was still watching for.  The actor who plays Clark is the only one that has remained the same for the whole series.  (He too makes me laugh because he sometimes morphs into talking like Elvis- as he starred in a TV movie playing Elvis...)I understand that this is still good family entertainment.  I appreciate the fact that Hallmark is making family and faithful entertainment (hence the two stars rather than one).  I just think that they could be doing a better job.  Ms. Oke wrote great stories- they didn't need to be changed.  Yes, edited for time constraints but that's all that was really necessary.  This story wasn't even a Love Comes Softly book- some of the characters were the same but there the similarities end.  I'm still sad that Katherine Heigl was unable to reprise her role as Marty but I don't blame her for not wanting to be associated with the mediocre movie.  The acting was pretty horrible- I only watched the whole thing to see how they wrapped things up.  The majority of the time, though, I couldn't help laughing about how the story, the facial expressions, the acting - was all supposed to be fairly serious but because the quality and caliber of talent was so low it was laughably ridiculous.  A big disappointment- I would watch this on TV before spending any money on it.  If the same actress is still playing Missy I don't plan on bothering with the rest of the series.  A series of movies that could have been so much better- that's the main reason for my disappointment.  With such a great premise, you wouldn't think it could go so wrong...",2,A big disappointment,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,2240,"['series', 'started', 'such', 'promise', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'granted', 'more', 'closely', 'followed', 'books', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'wrote', 'such', 'wonderful', 'stories', 'really', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'why', 'would', 'make', 'SO', 'many', 'changes', 'actress', 'who', 'Missie', 'movie', 'not', 'act', 'emotion', 'very', 'well', 'Moments', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'serious', 'were', 'laughably', 'ridiculous', 'demeanor', 'would', 'make', 'made', 'same', 'stern', 'straight-lined', 'mouth', 'expression', 'everything', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'angry', 'happy', 'sad', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'killed', 'off', 'Willie', 'was', 'one', 'redeeming', 'character', 'was', 'still', 'watching', 'actor', 'who', 'Clark', 'only', 'one', 'remained', 'same', 'whole', 'series', 'too', 'sometimes', 'morphs', 'talking', 'like', 'Elvis-', 'starred', 'TV', 'movie', 'playing', 'Elvis', 'understand', 'still', 'good', 'family', 'entertainment', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'Hallmark', 'making', 'family', 'faithful', 'entertainment', 'hence', 'two', 'stars', 'rather', 'one', 'just', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'doing', 'better', 'job', 'Ms.', 'Oke', 'wrote', 'great', 'stories-', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'changed', 'Yes', 'edited', 'time', 'constraints', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'book-', 'characters', 'were', 'same', 'similarities', 'end', ""'m"", 'still', 'sad', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'was', 'unable', 'reprise', 'role', 'Marty', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'associated', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'horrible-', 'only', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'see', 'how', 'wrapped', 'things', 'up', 'majority', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laughing', 'how', 'story', 'facial', 'expressions', 'acting', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'fairly', 'serious', 'quality', 'caliber', 'talent', 'was', 'so', 'low', 'was', 'laughably', 'ridiculous', 'big', 'disappointment-', 'would', 'watch', 'TV', 'spending', 'money', 'same', 'actress', 'still', 'playing', 'Missy', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'bothering', 'rest', 'series', 'A', 'series', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better-', 'main', 'reason', 'disappointment', 'such', 'great', 'premise', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'go', 'so', 'wrong']",Love's Unending Legacy

Love's Unending Legacy was really, really clean. A girl kicks a man; a boy has an accident and a little blood is seen on his arm; a horse which shatters its leg has to be shot but it is heard not seen; a girl fights with boy at school; a woman dreams about her husband's violent death but it's not graphic, you only hear a gut shot; there is also talk about a man being abusive to a child.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.  The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for ages 12 and older.I don't like the entire series, several are a little boring and it seems that Janette Oke has a thing with killing off the husbands and having the women remarry. So I only watch certain ones. Love Begins first (since is covers how the &#34;Love Comes Softly&#34; saga began), second is Love Comes Softly, third is Love's Enduring Promise, fourth is Love's Unending Legacy, and 5th is Love's Unfolding Dream. They are all amazing, really clean, high morals, family friendly, inspiring, and focuses on the more important things in life.Two years have passed since the tragic death of Missie LaHaye's husband Willie. Unable to work the land on her own, Missie and son Maddie leave there home to go back to her father's ranch.  She becomes a school teacher again and tries to start a new life, even though she still has nightmares about her husband's death.  An orphan train comes to town and even though she is determined not to take one in, something makes take in a fourteen year old girl who no ones else wants.  The transition is difficult, especially when the girl sees that another family is mistreating her brother, whom the family adopted. Missie attempts to prove the boy is being mistreated, and at the same time she attempts to fight her feelings for the town sheriff, Zach.Overall, I really love this move and will definitely watch it over and over again.",5,Love's Unending Legacy - would definately watch again,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,2156,"['Possibly', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Love', 'Unending', 'Legacy', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'clean', 'girl', 'man', 'boy', 'accident', 'little', 'blood', 'seen', 'arm', 'horse', 'leg', 'be', 'shot', 'heard', 'not', 'seen', 'girl', 'fights', 'boy', 'school', 'woman', 'husband', 'violent', 'death', 'not', 'graphic', 'only', 'hear', 'gut', 'shot', 'also', 'talk', 'man', 'being', 'abusive', 'child', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'gave', 'five', 'star', 'approved', '12', 'older.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'entire', 'series', 'several', 'are', 'little', 'boring', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'thing', 'killing', 'off', 'husbands', 'having', 'women', 'remarry', 'So', 'only', 'watch', 'certain', 'ones', 'Love', 'Begins', 'first', 'covers', 'how', '34', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', '34', 'saga', 'began', 'second', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'third', 'Love', 'Enduring', 'Promise', 'fourth', 'Love', 'Unending', 'Legacy', '5th', 'Love', 'Unfolding', 'Dream', 'are', 'amazing', 'really', 'clean', 'high', 'morals', 'family', 'friendly', 'inspiring', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'life.Two', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'tragic', 'death', 'Missie', 'LaHaye', 'husband', 'Willie', 'Unable', 'work', 'land', 'own', 'Missie', 'son', 'Maddie', 'leave', 'there', 'home', 'go', 'back', 'father', 'ranch', 'school', 'teacher', 'again', 'tries', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'even', 'still', 'nightmares', 'husband', 'death', 'orphan', 'train', 'town', 'even', 'determined', 'not', 'take', 'one', 'something', 'take', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'ones', 'else', 'transition', 'difficult', 'especially', 'when', 'girl', 'family', 'mistreating', 'brother', 'whom', 'family', 'adopted', 'Missie', 'prove', 'boy', 'being', 'mistreated', 'same', 'time', 'fight', 'feelings', 'town', 'sheriff', 'Zach.Overall', 'really', 'love', 'move', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'over', 'again']",Love's Unending Legacy
1106158,A1WCQ282UKVWJ9,B000W089VA,Fidget's Momma,"[1, 1]","If you are at all a fan of Janette Oke's book series, you are likely to be disappointed by these films. In the first two, there was at least an attempt to hold the main points of the story together. Not so in the third, and now fourth installments of the video series. There is still a strong presence of faith, and clear portrayal of prayer and Christian values. However, to say that this film was based on Janette Oke's book is really a little ridiculous.Because the plot is no longer based on the books, it is making less and less sense. The acting, while not horrible, is a little hit-or-miss. At first, I appreciated Erin Cottrell's strong portrayal of Missy, but at this point, I would almost welcome a new actress, as the role needs a refresher.Two big (HUGE) departures...if you can call them that, at this point...*spoiler* They killed off Willie. Yup, you read that right. And made room for Mr. Tall, Dark and Completely Random. New guy ""sheriff Zack"" is cute and all, but I'm just not clear on why we had to say goodbye to Willie in the first place - especially given that Mr. Random is a sheriff, too. Obviously, I'm still scratching my head and wondering about the total plot departures in the PREVIOUS two films.Also, the character of Belinda is no longer Marty's surprise youngest child, but is now an orphan who arrives in town with her brother on a orphan train, and is adopted by a widowed Missy. That's right - because apparently someone somewhere thought that the whole Willie-dies/Missy-returns-home-and-marries-somebody-else-AFTER-adopting-more-children plot is more believable than Marty having a baby in her late 30s/early 40s.I do think it is a good, family-friendly movie for those nights when you are looking for something to watch together. I appreciate that there is still a lot of reference to faith and God, and I think it is a much more wholesome alternative to most of the junk out there marketed for ""families"". I think it would be great to have more movies in this genre.However, if you are interested in Janette Oke's books, it is better to go straight o the source, since you will find very little resemblance to them in this film.",1,Love's Completely Unrecognizable Plot,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,2168,"['are', 'fan', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'book', 'series', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'films', 'first', 'two', 'was', 'least', 'attempt', 'hold', 'main', 'points', 'story', 'together', 'Not', 'so', 'third', 'now', 'fourth', 'installments', 'video', 'series', 'still', 'strong', 'presence', 'faith', 'clear', 'portrayal', 'prayer', 'Christian', 'values', 'However', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'book', 'really', 'little', 'ridiculous.Because', 'plot', 'longer', 'based', 'books', 'making', 'less', 'less', 'sense', 'acting', 'not', 'horrible', 'little', 'hit-or-miss', 'first', 'appreciated', 'Erin', 'Cottrell', 'strong', 'portrayal', 'Missy', 'point', 'would', 'almost', 'welcome', 'new', 'actress', 'role', 'refresher.Two', 'big', 'HUGE', 'departures', 'can', 'call', 'point', 'killed', 'off', 'Willie', 'Yup', 'read', 'right', 'made', 'room', 'Mr', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Completely', 'Random', 'New', 'guy', 'sheriff', 'Zack', 'cute', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'clear', 'why', 'had', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Willie', 'first', 'place', 'especially', 'given', 'Mr.', 'Random', 'sheriff', 'too', 'Obviously', ""'m"", 'still', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'total', 'plot', 'departures', 'PREVIOUS', 'two', 'films.Also', 'character', 'Belinda', 'no', 'longer', 'Marty', 'surprise', 'youngest', 'child', 'now', 'orphan', 'who', 'town', 'brother', 'orphan', 'train', 'adopted', 'widowed', 'Missy', 'right', 'because', 'apparently', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'thought', 'whole', 'Willie-dies/Missy-returns-home-and-marries-somebody-else-AFTER-adopting-more-children', 'plot', 'more', 'believable', 'Marty', 'having', 'baby', 'late', '30s/early', '40s.I', 'do', 'think', 'good', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'nights', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'watch', 'together', 'appreciate', 'still', 'lot', 'reference', 'faith', 'God', 'think', 'much', 'more', 'wholesome', 'alternative', 'most', 'junk', 'there', 'marketed', 'families', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'have', 'more', 'movies', 'genre.However', 'are', 'interested', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'books', 'better', 'go', 'straight', 'o', 'source', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'little', 'resemblance', 'film']",Love's Unending Legacy

This installment is a vast improvement over LAJ. A director who has kept the situations heartfelt and real. Material that may veer toward mauldlin, but knows just when to cut back in order to keep it real. While there seems to be questions with some liberties take from the book, on it's own the film works fairly well. One of my sticking points is the abrupt dismissal of Missie's first husband, in a poorly reenactment of his death. Once that is over, the film begins to gain it's track and right itself from his previous quality detour. Whereas the loss of a infant child is handled poorly in the previous film, this time around, it is dealt with with much humanity, poignancy and in a realistic manner. Kudos to the writer in the scene relating the loss of a child and tying it in beautifully with the new installment. Glad to see the series right itself and begin to get back on track with this installment. While far from the best (see LOVE COMES SOFTLY), it is a fine sequel (5th!) and makes you want to continue the sage.

Like all the previous movies, though, there seems to be a certain lack of romance between the protagonists.You could almost excuse the first movie, because that was the point of the title (that love comes softly), but all the movies have that strange situation where the protagonists suddenly realize they love each other in the last few minutes of the movie (well, mostly the women..the men are pretty clear about their romantic interests).Other than that continuing strange aspect of these movies, I still enjoyed this movie, independent of the books (having not read any of them).  A couple of sobbing scenes, but  I can really imagine how tough life was for orphans in that (and this) time period.I liked Dale Midkiff before discovering him in this series, and I have to say, he rocks as a dad in these movies.

1106171,AU1E6KDG1FMG6,B000W089VA,Rebekah A. Lane,"[1, 1]","Love's Abiding Joy had a cliffhanger ending, making any additional installment to the series something of a challenge. They decided to go with standard ""love series"" formula: Have someone die. (Someone died in every one of the Love Comes Softly movies -- it just didn't bother us too much because it was never a character we had gotten too attatched to -- until now). Willie has been dead for a few years at the beginning of the movie, and Missy leaves the home they made together in the West to return to her Ma and Pa. The lady who played for Marty exceeded my expectations, but I was put off by the primness of her greeting to Mattie. Other than that one scene I liked her. Dale Midkiff was good, as always. Jeff is out. Missy's beloved brothers make no appearence, and are not even mentioned. That was weird. Though Missy tells Marty in their first heart-to-heart that she can never love someone again, she has not been home for a week before she notices the town's dashing young sherrif. No foreshadowing needed -- we know where this is going . . . The plot takes an imaginative loop with Missy suddenly taking in a teenage girl named Belinda, along with her attitude. Most of the movie is taken up with the highs and lows of their relationship, with brief encounters between Missy and Zach -- the town sherrif. The busy sherrif of course has time to break up fights in the school yard, carry Mattie home after he hurt himself, or help the pretty teacher look for her locket, as he ""just happened"" to be riding by. Belinda at first hides the fact that Jacob, a little boy who was adopted by a hard-nosed farmer, is actually her brother, but eventually reveals the truth when Missy (and Zach) catch her sneeking him food in the night. Then a fight begins to get Jacob away from his abusive gaurdian. Thus, a reason for Missy to cling to Zach for support. Zach himself is a pretty flat character, so the developments between he and Missy are not romantic, though no doubt interesting. Climax comes when, desperate to help her brother, Belinda runs away with him. If not for a miricle in the dark of the rainy night, Zach would not have found them. Jacob tells the truth about what he has been suffering, so the sherrif finially is able to get him away. Missy has been confused by her feelings for Zach, but in the end declares her love for him and they get married. Over all, an acceptable, run of the mill Hallmark release. Not up to par with Love Comes Softly, with the flimsy plot, cheesy dialog, underdeveloped characters, etc; etc. If Love's Unfolding Dream turns out to be as good as the preview looks, I will definately be glad they decided to continue the series instead of ending it with Missy sadly waving goodbye to Clark at the end of Love's Abiding Joy.
