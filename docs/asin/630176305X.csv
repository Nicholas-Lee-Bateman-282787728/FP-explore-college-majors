It is a bit dated now, but it is an original story with a lot of good laughs.  A great movie to have fun and escape for a couple of hours.  Enjoy and have a laugh - it is good for your health.  :)",4,Dana Carvey's Best Movie,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,290,"['liked', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'years', 'bit', 'dated', 'now', 'original', 'story', 'lot', 'good', 'laughs', 'great', 'movie', 'have', 'fun', 'escape', 'couple', 'hours', 'Enjoy', 'have', 'laugh', 'good', 'health']",N/A

It is as if the role was written with Carvey in mind - his antics and comedic timing were perfectly funny and in every scene he is in(which is pretty much everyone of them), i laughed, wholeheartedly. ""Opportunity Knocks"" is the one of the best movies with an SNL alum.  If you are a fan of his characters from the show, you will probably like this movie about a con artist that uses the empty house of a wealthy bachelor to get into the lives of his family and fall in love in the process. Robert Loggia is very good as the father of both the homeowner and Annie, his sister.I remember watching this movie over and over and laughing every time back when it first came on video.  Between his karaoke stylings of ""Born to be wild"" and his imiation of George Bush(the first president in the family), you will be rolling with laughter. THis is a great comedy from a great comedian.  I highly recommend it for a great laugh",4,Dana Carvey makes this movie!!!,1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,1026,"['other', 'actor', 'role', 'Eddie', 'Farrell', 'aka', 'Jonathan', 'housesitter', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'Carvey', 'mind', 'antics', 'comedic', 'timing', 'were', 'perfectly', 'funny', 'scene', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'i', 'laughed', 'wholeheartedly', 'Opportunity', 'Knocks', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'SNL', 'alum', 'are', 'fan', 'characters', 'show', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'con', 'artist', 'empty', 'house', 'wealthy', 'bachelor', 'get', 'lives', 'family', 'fall', 'love', 'process', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'very', 'good', 'father', 'homeowner', 'Annie', 'sister.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'movie', 'laughing', 'time', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'video', 'Between', 'karaoke', 'stylings', 'Born', 'be', 'wild', 'imiation', 'George', 'Bush', 'first', 'president', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'rolling', 'laughter', 'THis', 'great', 'comedy', 'great', 'comedian', 'highly', 'recommend', 'great', 'laugh']",N/A

264557,AUV0EFKWA46TX,630176305X,shaxper,"[5, 5]","Watching Wedding Crashers in the theater made me hungry for this film again.  It must have been at least eight years since I caught it on TV, but my memory of the film hadn't dulled, and I was relieved to find that my appreciation for its humor and emotional content hadn't dulled either.  This film is just as funny and sweet as it was on the first viewing.  Carvey is a genious of an actor here, not just making you laugh out loud on every other beat, but really pulling on the heartstrings and creating a character you truly care for at the same time.  There's real heart in this film about a Con Artist that walks into the biggest con of his life and ends up falling in love.  It has all the humor, emotion, and plot that Wedding Crashers did, only it's done better: funnier, sweeter, and also far more clever.
