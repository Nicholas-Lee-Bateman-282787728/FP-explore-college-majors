Because while i was feeling and enjoyed the main characters in the movie.  The only person that i felt brought anything real to the film was his wife obviously once she confronted him on being gay.  He couldnt do anything but relent and she forced him into admitting this which i feel was necessary and kind of obvious.  Being the way he was acting while they were ""making love"".  But still she could've been seriously hateful to him and everything,  i didnt feel that she did for the most part..hurt and heartbroken yes.  But not hate or vengeful at all.  His family that was another matter writing him out of the will and leaving him nothing when his father died..they couldnt even be bothered to discuss what the deal was.  I hated that no support or anything from them.  It was good to me because i felt for the gay characters in the movie especially when one was catching a beat down but ""another"" hateful gay basher.  I wanted to kick the crap outta that guy.Just the struggles that they as a couple went through together (finding themselves, needing their space and an ending (beginning) that i liked but didnt at the same time.  if that makes any sense.  I will say if you are on the border about checking out Keillers Park at the very least.  You owe it to yourself to rent this one for a weekend and watch it through then make your decision.  It is an acquired taste for some..me i am glad that i bought it myself.  Solid movie, a couple decent supporting characters and plot also.  Check it out",4,Better..,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,1580,"['Than', 'i', 'expected', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'hit', 'everything', 'right', 'mark', 'i', 'was', 'feeling', 'enjoyed', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'only', 'person', 'i', 'felt', 'brought', 'anything', 'real', 'film', 'was', 'wife', 'obviously', 'confronted', 'being', 'gay', 'do', 'anything', 'relent', 'forced', 'admitting', 'i', 'feel', 'was', 'necessary', 'kind', 'obvious', 'Being', 'way', 'was', 'acting', 'were', 'making', 'love', 'still', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seriously', 'hateful', 'everything', 'i', 'didnt', 'feel', 'did', 'most', 'part..hurt', 'heartbroken', 'yes', 'not', 'hate', 'vengeful', 'family', 'was', 'matter', 'writing', 'will', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'when', 'father', 'died..they', 'couldnt', 'even', 'be', 'bothered', 'discuss', 'what', 'deal', 'was', 'hated', 'support', 'anything', 'was', 'good', 'i', 'felt', 'gay', 'characters', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'was', 'catching', 'beat', 'down', 'hateful', 'gay', 'basher', 'wanted', 'kick', 'crap', 'outta', 'struggles', 'couple', 'went', 'together', 'finding', 'needing', 'space', 'ending', 'beginning', 'i', 'liked', 'didnt', 'same', 'time', 'sense', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'border', 'checking', 'out', 'Keillers', 'Park', 'very', 'least', 'owe', 'rent', 'one', 'weekend', 'watch', 'then', 'make', 'decision', 'acquired', 'taste', 'some..me', 'i', 'am', 'glad', 'i', 'bought', 'Solid', 'movie', 'couple', 'decent', 'supporting', 'characters', 'plot', 'also', 'Check', 'out']",N/A
1070025,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000PE0EX4,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","KEILLERS PARK is a moody film noir from Sweden, a story by Pia Gradvall directed by Susanna Edwards that approaches the frequently told fears and joys of sexual coming out in a stylish and inventive way.  It is a film that embellishes a fine script with creative camera work, sensitive use of flashbacks to peel the onion of the story's meaning, and employs some very fine actors who keep the drama electrified.Peter (Mrten Klingberg) is a successful thirty-something son of a wealthy engineer who stands to inherit his family business and who is engaged to a beautiful artist Maria (Karen Bergquist).  At a gathering Peter notices a  handsome Algerian Nassim (Pjotr Giro) and senses feelings of sexual awareness he has not known.  Nassim is a happy, popular, comfortably gay man who pursues the looks exchanged. When Maria leaves town for a concert Peter and Nassim meet in Keiller Park and begin an erotic love affair: both men genuinely fall in love and the expression of their first physical encounter is one of the most subtle yet wholly erotic on film.Peter's involvement with Nassim affects his work, results in his father disowning him as he embraces the gay life, pushes Maria out of his life, and leaves him  unemployed and alone except for Nassim.  The story abruptly changes when the police breakdown Peter's door and arrest him for the murder of Nassim!  Peter sits with the interrogators at the police station and in his shock that Nassim is dead, unfolds the whole story of their relationship.  The secrets  of Peter's life and the question as to Nassim's motivations and possible continued existence mold the resolution of the story in a manner that has explored all the highs and lows of new love and the consequences of entering a life that is intolerable to the outside world.Both Pjotr Giro and Mrten Klingberg as the lovers offer highly nuanced performances and the supporting cast is very strong. Director Edwards has  a sophisticated style not only with her actors, but also with her eye for atmosphere and pacing, using techniques of black and white for special moments and glowing warm lighting for the erotic scenes.  She manages to allow us to see both sides of the 'coming out' consequences in a mature manner.  KEILLERS PARK is a fine art house movie. In Swedish with English subtitles.

FUSCO ""yawnmower""","[6, 10]","If you're looking for a nasty, gay-bashing story reminiscent of the 50's, this movie has it all:  intolerance, denial, deep closets, self-loathing.  There is little else to recommend it.  The story, apparently based on a true event, is difficult and frustrating.Peter, the son of a wealthy Swedish businessman, works for the family firm.  He looks forward to a successful life as manager of the company, with an attractive wife, children, etc.  Then something dreadful happens.  He meets Nassim who is handing out left-wing newspapers.  It's lust at first sight  and, after a few fits and starts, they begin a torrid affair.One thing stands in their way: Peter is terminally closeted and, while happy enough in private, will not acknowledge Nassim in public.  Nassim is presented as a 'free spirit' but he is just excruciatingly annoying.  Peter becomes obsessed and jealous, losing his job, family, and inheritance.  Nassim is so busy being free, he doesn't even notice Peter's family or job problems.  He is simply bored with his partner's lack of fun and, after calling Peter some unpleasant names in a self-serving fit of pique, takes off.Nassim continually puts himself in danger with his habit of making overtures to any and all he meets, sometimes with dire consequences.  He befriends one mean, drunken straight man who promptly beats him up, and then a group of nasty skinheads.  When Nassim turns up dead, police suspect Peter and a swat team anachronistically storms into his apartment as if he were a high-level drug dealer.  For a successful businessman with money and connections, Peter defends himself with startling incompetence - not to mention without a lawyer.One wonders, though it is not made clear, if the actual story took place in the 50's of which it reminds us.  One might expect such a violent, homophobic story to take place in small-town America today, but certainly not in progressive Sweden.The only character that comes off at all well is Peter's fiance.  She figures out his problem and is the only person in the film who doesn't wish him harm.  If he had been more open from the beginning, it seems likely that she wouldn't have much cared about his homosexuality, and he could have saved everyone a lot of bother.",3,throwback,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,2248,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'nasty', 'gay-bashing', 'story', 'reminiscent', '50', 'movie', 'intolerance', 'denial', 'deep', 'closets', 'self-loathing', 'little', 'else', 'recommend', 'story', 'apparently', 'based', 'true', 'event', 'difficult', 'frustrating.Peter', 'son', 'wealthy', 'Swedish', 'businessman', 'family', 'firm', 'forward', 'successful', 'life', 'manager', 'company', 'attractive', 'wife', 'children', 'etc', 'Then', 'something', 'dreadful', 'happens', 'Nassim', 'who', 'handing', 'out', 'left-wing', 'newspapers', 'lust', 'first', 'sight', 'few', 'fits', 'starts', 'begin', 'torrid', 'affair.One', 'thing', 'stands', 'way', 'Peter', 'terminally', 'closeted', 'happy', 'enough', 'private', 'will', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'Nassim', 'public', 'Nassim', 'presented', ""'free"", 'spirit', 'just', 'excruciatingly', 'annoying', 'Peter', 'obsessed', 'jealous', 'losing', 'job', 'family', 'inheritance', 'Nassim', 'so', 'busy', 'being', 'free', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'Peter', 'family', 'job', 'problems', 'simply', 'bored', 'partner', 'lack', 'fun', 'calling', 'Peter', 'unpleasant', 'names', 'self-serving', 'fit', 'pique', 'continually', 'danger', 'habit', 'making', 'overtures', 'sometimes', 'dire', 'consequences', 'one', 'mean', 'drunken', 'straight', 'man', 'who', 'promptly', 'up', 'then', 'group', 'nasty', 'skinheads', 'When', 'Nassim', 'up', 'dead', 'police', 'suspect', 'Peter', 'swat', 'team', 'anachronistically', 'apartment', 'were', 'high-level', 'drug', 'dealer', 'successful', 'businessman', 'money', 'connections', 'Peter', 'startling', 'incompetence', 'not', 'mention', 'lawyer.One', 'wonders', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'actual', 'story', 'took', 'place', '50', 'One', 'might', 'expect', 'violent', 'homophobic', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'small-town', 'America', 'today', 'certainly', 'not', 'progressive', 'Sweden.The', 'only', 'character', 'off', 'well', 'Peter', 'fiance', 'out', 'problem', 'only', 'person', 'film', 'who', ""n't"", 'wish', 'harm', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'open', 'beginning', 'likely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'cared', 'homosexuality', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'everyone', 'lot', 'bother']",N/A
