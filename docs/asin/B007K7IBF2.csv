1532633,A1A7MV1CQYCWQ5,B007K7IBF2,R. Morgan,"[5, 10]","A trip back in time during the Morse era starring Shaun Evans as a young Morse aka John Thaw.  We are treated once again to the artistic abilities of Colin Dexter and his opinions of Oxford, with meticulous direction of the cast, and outstanding photography.  However, we are asked to accept Mr. Evans as a young Morse with his anti-social behavior and love of ale, crosswords, Wagner and vintage cars.  This is difficult for a devoted John Thaw fan for there is little if any physical resemblance  to the Inspector Morse we knew and loved.  Other than that flaw, and it is more than a minor flaw, this Masterpiece Theater production of ""Endeavour"" is watchable, and worth purchasing.
