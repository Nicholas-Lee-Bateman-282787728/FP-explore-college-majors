I've since lost my VHS copy and had hoped to purchase it on DVD for my daughter who is now six.The plot was engaging and funny, while there were no swear words or gratuitous violence to contend with.

389365,A278209U4HAKKH,6303922511,Michael Ross,"[4, 4]","The Whipping Boy premiered 7/31/1994 on the Disney Channel with some references in Variety to a 120 minute run time. It was released theatrically in the U.S. 9/28/1995 with a 96 minute run time. When I saw that Amazon.com is creating DVD-R copies with a 113 minute run time, I purchased it thinking it was a director's cut with a run time of the premiere, but the DVD-R I received has the same 96:34 run time of the theatric release. I haven't found a way to advise Amazon.com that they are misrepresenting this product. I did compare the DVD-R to the 2009 DVD version distributed by Feature Films for Families and found that FFFF cut about 2 minutes from the 96:34 version in 20 edits. Curiously, Jemmy says ""gol"" three times in the 96:34 version and Annyrose says it once -- FFFF used a 1 second cut to remove one of Jemmy's gols and a 2-second cut to remove Annyrose's, but left the other two instances untouched.",4,mross,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,916,"['Whipping', 'Boy', 'premiered', '7/31/1994', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'references', 'Variety', '120', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'U.S.', '9/28/1995', '96', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'When', 'saw', 'Amazon.com', 'creating', 'DVD-R', 'copies', '113', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'purchased', 'thinking', 'was', 'director', 'cut', 'run', 'time', 'premiere', 'DVD-R', 'received', 'same', '96:34', 'run', 'time', 'theatric', 'release', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'way', 'advise', 'Amazon.com', 'are', 'misrepresenting', 'product', 'did', 'compare', 'DVD-R', '2009', 'DVD', 'version', 'distributed', 'Feature', 'Films', 'Families', 'found', 'FFFF', 'cut', 'about', '2', 'minutes', '96:34', 'version', '20', 'edits', 'Curiously', 'Jemmy', 'gol', 'three', 'times', '96:34', 'version', 'Annyrose', 'once', 'FFFF', 'used', '1', 'second', 'cut', 'remove', 'one', 'Jemmy', 'gols', '2-second', 'cut', 'remove', 'Annyrose', 'left', 'other', 'two', 'instances', 'untouched']",Prince Brat and the Whipping Boy VHS

But in all, it was very similar to the novel. My 9 year old students loved it about as much as they loved The Whipping Boy. Great novel and great movie. I would defiantly recommend both. The movie has some violence and scary moments, but very mild.

389368,AJGP5XYKKBGBG,6303922511,Reliable Reviews,"[4, 4]","Rated-G. Made for the Disney-Channel.Filmed on location in the countryside of France, in a castle, village, and forest. Lavish costumes, sets. Plenty of soldiers, courtiers, and a couple of bad-guys. Two boys coming to friendship through adventure.The royal family does not believe the prince and future king should be whipped with servants gossiping in the castle; so an orphan, boy is abducted and takes the punishment for the prince, and is paid for his pain. Not as far-fetched in England where misbehaving school-children were regularly whipped with a cane in the public schools; I know for sure through the 1930's, and maybe later. This is a very brief part of the plot.The king is too busy to spend anytime with his son the prince, and rejects his young son's requests for activities. The young prince tries to get attention, and let his father know he is sad, by retaliating for each rejection with mischievous pranks. An ambassador is visiting trying to avert war. The young prince pulls his pranks on the ambassador, and then his father, with both sides thinking the other responsible. Thus, the young-prince pushes the two, kingdoms to the brink of war.The young-prince and the orphan-boy run away on quite an adventure. A good moral in the end. The film moves at a good pace with plenty of action, interest, and humor. The orphan-boy's little sister has her own troubles elsewhere.",5,"Two, boys on adventure in France in the 1700's.",1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,1393,"['Rated-G.', 'Made', 'Disney-Channel.Filmed', 'location', 'countryside', 'France', 'castle', 'village', 'forest', 'Lavish', 'costumes', 'sets', 'Plenty', 'soldiers', 'courtiers', 'couple', 'bad-guys', 'Two', 'boys', 'coming', 'friendship', 'adventure.The', 'royal', 'family', 'not', 'believe', 'prince', 'future', 'king', 'should', 'be', 'whipped', 'servants', 'gossiping', 'castle', 'orphan', 'boy', 'abducted', 'punishment', 'prince', 'paid', 'pain', 'Not', 'far-fetched', 'England', 'where', 'misbehaving', 'school-children', 'were', 'regularly', 'whipped', 'cane', 'public', 'schools', 'know', 'sure', '1930', 'maybe', 'later', 'very', 'brief', 'part', 'plot.The', 'king', 'too', 'busy', 'spend', 'anytime', 'son', 'prince', 'young', 'son', 'requests', 'activities', 'young', 'prince', 'tries', 'get', 'attention', 'let', 'father', 'know', 'sad', 'retaliating', 'rejection', 'mischievous', 'pranks', 'ambassador', 'visiting', 'trying', 'avert', 'war', 'young', 'prince', 'pranks', 'ambassador', 'then', 'father', 'sides', 'thinking', 'other', 'responsible', 'Thus', 'young-prince', 'two', 'kingdoms', 'brink', 'war.The', 'young-prince', 'orphan-boy', 'run', 'away', 'adventure', 'good', 'moral', 'end', 'film', 'moves', 'good', 'pace', 'plenty', 'action', 'interest', 'humor', 'orphan-boy', 'little', 'sister', 'own', 'troubles', 'elsewhere']",Prince Brat and the Whipping Boy VHS
