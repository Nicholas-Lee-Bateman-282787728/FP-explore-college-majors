1232931,A1W98Q4MZK80VA,B001REMSHG,Joseph P. Tevington,"[5, 6]","I found this DVD to be a concise & thorough account of the tragic abuse of Terri Schiavo.  Even if Terri were in a PVS, Pope John Paul II reminded us that:* ""The sick person in a vegetative state, awaiting recovery or a natural end, still has the right to basic health care (nutrition, hydration, cleanliness, warmth, etc.), and to the prevention of complications related to his confinement to bed. He also has the right to appropriate rehabilitative care and to be monitored for clinical signs of eventual recovery.* ""I should like particularly to underline how the administration of water and food, even when provided by artificial means, always represents a natural means of preserving life, not a medical act. Its use, furthermore, should be considered, in principle, ordinary and proportionate, and as such morally obligatory, insofar as and until it is seen to have attained its proper finality, which in the present case consists in providing nourishment to the patient and alleviation of his suffering....* ""The evaluation of probabilities, founded on waning hopes for recovery when the vegetative state is prolonged beyond a year, cannot ethically justify the cessation or interruption of minimal care for the patient, including nutrition and hydration. Death by starvation or dehydration is, in fact, the only possible outcome as a result of their withdrawal. In this sense it ends up becoming, if done knowingly and willingly, true and proper euthanasia by omission""(from Pope John Paull II's 3/20/2004 address to the International Congress, ""Life-Sustaining Treatments and Vegetative State: Scientific Advances and Ethical Dilemmas"").",5,A Concise & Thorough Account of the Tragic Abuse of Terri Schiavo,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,1646,"['found', 'DVD', 'be', 'concise', 'thorough', 'account', 'tragic', 'abuse', 'Terri', 'Schiavo', 'Even', 'Terri', 'were', 'PVS', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'reminded', '*', 'sick', 'person', 'vegetative', 'state', 'awaiting', 'recovery', 'natural', 'end', 'still', 'right', 'basic', 'health', 'care', 'nutrition', 'hydration', 'cleanliness', 'warmth', 'etc', 'prevention', 'complications', 'related', 'confinement', 'bed', 'also', 'right', 'appropriate', 'rehabilitative', 'care', 'be', 'monitored', 'clinical', 'signs', 'eventual', 'recovery', 'should', 'like', 'particularly', 'underline', 'how', 'administration', 'water', 'food', 'even', 'when', 'provided', 'artificial', 'means', 'always', 'natural', 'means', 'preserving', 'life', 'not', 'medical', 'act', 'use', 'furthermore', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'principle', 'ordinary', 'proportionate', 'such', 'morally', 'obligatory', 'insofar', 'seen', 'have', 'attained', 'proper', 'finality', 'present', 'case', 'providing', 'nourishment', 'patient', 'alleviation', 'suffering', 'evaluation', 'probabilities', 'founded', 'waning', 'hopes', 'recovery', 'when', 'vegetative', 'state', 'prolonged', 'year', 'can', 'not', 'ethically', 'justify', 'cessation', 'interruption', 'minimal', 'care', 'patient', 'including', 'nutrition', 'hydration', 'Death', 'starvation', 'dehydration', 'fact', 'only', 'possible', 'outcome', 'result', 'withdrawal', 'sense', 'up', 'becoming', 'done', 'knowingly', 'willingly', 'true', 'proper', 'euthanasia', 'omission', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paull', 'II', '3/20/2004', 'address', 'International', 'Congress', 'Life-Sustaining', 'Treatments', 'Vegetative', 'State', 'Scientific', 'Advances', 'Ethical', 'Dilemmas']",The Terri Schiavo Story

Sadly, the film is accurate in that a woman with minimal consciousness (better than PVS), was legally murdered.  Those who dismiss this must ask some questions.  Why did Michael Schiavo during the last ten years prohibit any therapy of any kind -- even to the extent of slight stimulation?  (of course these orders were disobeyed to the extent they could be) Therapy would not have harmed her in the least and could have had a good end.  The only logical thing to infer is that Schiavo did not want his wife to get better. During the height of Terri's fight, why were cameras  and reporters not allowed?  The truth could have been determined,  As for disconnecting food and water?  Because no one can survive without food and water, such a disconnection is nothing more than murder.  Giving Terri a lethal injection would be more honest.  one more point:  Diagnoses are imperfect.  Were they perfect, no brain dead people would recover.  In Terri's case, her functioning was much above brain death.  She would have lived and might have recovered if not for Michael Schiavo  and the legal and medical system.  This film tells the story along with videos that demonstrate minimal consciousness - and maybe a little more.",4,subjective but pretty accurate,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,1335,"['Naturally', 'film', 'subjective', 'will', 'tug', 'one', 'heartstrings', 'Anyone', 'who', 'studies', 'case', 'subjective', 'Sadly', 'film', 'accurate', 'woman', 'minimal', 'consciousness', 'better', 'PVS', 'was', 'legally', 'murdered', 'who', 'dismiss', 'must', 'ask', 'questions', 'Why', 'did', 'Michael', 'Schiavo', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'prohibit', 'therapy', 'kind', 'even', 'extent', 'slight', 'stimulation', 'course', 'orders', 'were', 'disobeyed', 'extent', 'could', 'be', 'Therapy', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'harmed', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'end', 'only', 'logical', 'thing', 'infer', 'Schiavo', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'wife', 'get', 'better', 'height', 'Terri', 'fight', 'why', 'were', 'cameras', 'reporters', 'not', 'allowed', 'truth', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'determined', 'disconnecting', 'food', 'water', 'one', 'can', 'survive', 'food', 'water', 'disconnection', 'nothing', 'more', 'murder', 'Giving', 'Terri', 'lethal', 'injection', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'honest', 'one', 'more', 'point', 'Diagnoses', 'are', 'imperfect', 'Were', 'perfect', 'brain', 'dead', 'people', 'would', 'recover', 'Terri', 'case', 'functioning', 'was', 'much', 'brain', 'death', 'would', 'have', 'lived', 'might', 'have', 'recovered', 'not', 'Michael', 'Schiavo', 'legal', 'medical', 'system', 'film', 'story', 'videos', 'demonstrate', 'minimal', 'consciousness', 'maybe', 'little', 'more']",The Terri Schiavo Story

mother entered the room or she heard her mother's voice she would become very vocal, and vocalize with her mother. her beaming smile and very expressive eyes displayed total recognition and love.terri should have never been murdered. she deserved to live and be placed in the loving care of her parents.her husband refused treatment and rehabilitation. he had everything to gain by ensuring she was put to death, especially from the financial gain he would acquire.the video states it is false that 35 other judges viewed the original court trial reports, before terri was legally murdered.no additional judges reviewed anything, and therefore, terri's intentional murder by stopping all food and liquid would definitely cause her a very slow and very painful death.the favorable reports of various medical specialists which also tested terri had stated she was aware to a certain degree, and should not be put to death were never admitted into the original court trial.this is a wake up call for every disabled person to ensure that they prepare a health care proxy and appoint a loved one they really trust to ensure all of their medical legal wishes are honored to the letter, in order to ensure what happened to terri schiavo, will not happen to them, if they find themselves in her type of disabled state, or any type of associated medical disability condition.where there is life there is hope, and only God has the true right to decide when he wants to call us home.God gave us life and only God has the right to decide when it our time to go.my heart goes out to terri and i hope she is resting in eternal life in God's Heavenly Kingdom. she was a living breathing sweet human being and deserved the legal right to be placed in the care of her parents and not be intentionally murdered by the court and medical community who enacted this deplorable very slow and painful life ending act.my deepest condolences to terri's immediate family including her mom, her siblings, and her deceased dad who i hope is now embracing his loving daughter terri in Heaven.surely terri schiavo and her story will live on as a daily reminder of legal and medical evils which should never transpire.terri paid the ultimate price for being disabled.......she was murdered intentionally and paid with her life, and that is what i find to be so horrific in today's so called modern society where human life no longer holds any meaning unless we are perfect in every aspect of the word.",5,true compassionate honest review of the terri schiavo story,1355616000,"12 16,

1232934,A1K7X23UDT0R7V,B001REMSHG,Winston D. Jen,"[0, 0]","This film was funded by right-wing Christians and populated by well-meaning individuals who, sadly and mistakenly, believed that Terri was not brain dead, but merely &#34;disabled.&#34; Starting from a premise of quicksand, things go downhill from there. We are asked whether Terri was a person (she died after her brain injury with a shell being sustained by medical technology) and how she should be treated.The implication, of course, is that Terri was murdered, Michael Schiavo is a heartless beast and living wills/advance directives/DNR orders are a tool of the &#34;Culture of Death&#34; (contrasted with the Culture of Suffering). As her husband mentioned in his take on the whole debacle, almost no 27-year-olds have living wills. Perhaps the only good outcome of this farce will be the parade of people clamouring for DNR orders, advance directives and powers of attorney to prevent horrors and tragedies for families in the future. Claims that Terri showed signs of recovery, speech and the hope for a full recovery, even if true, were soundly refuted by the evidence of countless court-appointed neurologists (who did not have any vested interests, unlike those on the pro-life payroll).The interviewees claimed that Terri was not kept alive by machines (ignoring the feeding tube). While the family suffered a tragic and profound loss, their inability to accept reality did not do anything to improve the situation. Terri's responses were involuntary and random. She was unaware with no hope of ever regaining awareness. The autopsy conclusively proved that she was blind. Everything the Schindlers did &#34;for&#34; Terri was really done for themselves, to make themselves feel better.This film is designed to tug at its viewers' heartstrings, but it won't have much of an effect on anyone who hasn't already been assimilated into the frenzy whipped up by the rabid religious right. Anyone who has studied both sides of the case fairly and even-handedly will have to conclude that Terri died in 1990, a husk was kept alive by machines and compassionate nurses, and that Terri had no &#34;interests&#34; to fight for. The Religious Right exploited this tragedy and set two families against each other. They should be ashamed of themselves. I know I would be if I used personal tragedies for political ends.The most revolting statement comes as an anti-choicer berates and sanctimoniously preaches at the audience about Terri's manner of death. Dehydration was the only option since assisted suicide and euthanasia are not legal in Florida. They were responsible for Terri's gruesome end. The only silver lining was that Terri could not feel a thing.",1,Nothing Factual to Speak Of,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2662,"['film', 'was', 'funded', 'right-wing', 'Christians', 'populated', 'well-meaning', 'individuals', 'who', 'sadly', 'mistakenly', 'believed', 'Terri', 'was', 'not', 'brain', 'dead', 'merely', '34', 'disabled.', '34', 'Starting', 'premise', 'quicksand', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'there', 'are', 'asked', 'Terri', 'was', 'person', 'died', 'brain', 'injury', 'shell', 'being', 'sustained', 'medical', 'technology', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'treated.The', 'implication', 'course', 'Terri', 'was', 'murdered', 'Michael', 'Schiavo', 'heartless', 'beast', 'living', 'wills/advance', 'directives/DNR', 'orders', 'are', 'tool', '34', 'Culture', 'Death', '34', 'contrasted', 'Culture', 'Suffering', 'husband', 'mentioned', 'take', 'whole', 'debacle', 'almost', '27-year-olds', 'have', 'living', 'wills', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'good', 'outcome', 'farce', 'will', 'be', 'parade', 'people', 'clamouring', 'DNR', 'orders', 'advance', 'directives', 'powers', 'attorney', 'prevent', 'horrors', 'tragedies', 'families', 'future', 'Claims', 'Terri', 'showed', 'signs', 'recovery', 'speech', 'hope', 'full', 'recovery', 'even', 'true', 'were', 'soundly', 'refuted', 'evidence', 'countless', 'court-appointed', 'neurologists', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'vested', 'interests', 'pro-life', 'payroll', '.The', 'interviewees', 'claimed', 'Terri', 'was', 'not', 'kept', 'alive', 'machines', 'ignoring', 'feeding', 'tube', 'family', 'suffered', 'tragic', 'profound', 'loss', 'inability', 'accept', 'reality', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'improve', 'situation', 'Terri', 'responses', 'were', 'involuntary', 'random', 'was', 'unaware', 'hope', 'ever', 'regaining', 'awareness', 'autopsy', 'conclusively', 'proved', 'was', 'blind', 'Everything', 'Schindlers', 'did', '34', '34', 'Terri', 'was', 'really', 'done', 'make', 'feel', 'better.This', 'film', 'designed', 'tug', 'viewers', 'heartstrings', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'effect', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'assimilated', 'frenzy', 'whipped', 'up', 'rabid', 'religious', 'right', 'Anyone', 'who', 'studied', 'sides', 'case', 'fairly', 'even-handedly', 'will', 'have', 'conclude', 'Terri', 'died', '1990', 'husk', 'was', 'kept', 'alive', 'machines', 'compassionate', 'nurses', 'Terri', 'had', '34', 'interests', '34', 'fight', 'Religious', 'Right', 'exploited', 'tragedy', 'set', 'two', 'families', 'other', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'political', 'ends.The', 'most', 'revolting', 'statement', 'anti-choicer', 'berates', 'sanctimoniously', 'preaches', 'audience', 'Terri', 'manner', 'death', 'Dehydration', 'was', 'only', 'option', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'euthanasia', 'are', 'not', 'legal', 'Florida', 'were', 'responsible', 'Terri', 'gruesome', 'end', 'only', 'silver', 'lining', 'was', 'Terri', 'could', 'not', 'feel', 'thing']",The Terri Schiavo Story
