1571898,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B008NNY92Q,mk,"[1, 2]","This dog's point of view movie vacillates between romantic comedy and kids' animal adventure.Gabe the Cupid Dog narrates the tale of his attempts to hook up his master(Brian Krause) or ""Dad"" with the neighbor lady, single mom(Boti Bliss), so that Gabe and his owner won't move to England which would require Gabe to be locked in unsavory quarantine for 6 months.There are lots of animal shots, and the animals's mouths move when they to talk to each other; otherwise, one hears Gabes somewhat annoying voice over the whole movie.  That's my biggest gripe.  The humor misses a lot of the time, and has a bit of a ribald tone to it, e.g., Gabe steals the bikini top of a young woman sunning herself who then chases him down the street wrapped in a towel.  Next he accosts a group of nuns who end up giving his owner an earful of threats before telling him he better go to church.There's a couple of catchy tunes, and the kid actors are fine; there's a side story about the single mom becoming a famous writer.  It's Dove approved, i.e., no sex(some kissing), language or violence, PG'ish. It follows in the line of ""Cinnamon"" which I think is slightly better, both by Michael Feifer(director, producer, writer).  Ralph Waite(The Waltons) has a small part.I don't know; it's ok.  The kids followed the dog and the animals, but are totally bored by the romance.  For us adults- mostly bored.  I think the creators are trying very hard to please us all and keep it clean(I applaud that).  Must take a lot of patience to shoot all those animal close-ups.",3,"Cute Dog, Offbeat Humor",1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,1548,"['dog', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'vacillates', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'kids', 'animal', 'Cupid', 'Dog', 'tale', 'attempts', 'hook', 'up', 'master', 'Brian', 'Krause', 'Dad', 'neighbor', 'lady', 'single', 'mom', 'Boti', 'Bliss', 'so', 'Gabe', 'owner', 'wo', ""n't"", 'move', 'England', 'would', 'require', 'Gabe', 'be', 'locked', 'unsavory', 'quarantine', '6', 'months.There', 'are', 'lots', 'animal', 'shots', 'animals', 'mouths', 'move', 'when', 'talk', 'other', 'otherwise', 'one', 'Gabes', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'voice', 'whole', 'movie', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'humor', 'lot', 'time', 'bit', 'ribald', 'tone', 'e.g.', 'Gabe', 'bikini', 'top', 'young', 'woman', 'sunning', 'who', 'then', 'down', 'street', 'wrapped', 'towel', 'group', 'nuns', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'giving', 'owner', 'earful', 'threats', 'telling', 'better', 'go', 'church.There', 'couple', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'kid', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'side', 'story', 'single', 'mom', 'becoming', 'famous', 'writer', 'Dove', 'approved', 'i.e.', 'sex', 'kissing', 'language', 'violence', ""PG'ish"", 'line', 'Cinnamon', 'think', 'slightly', 'better', 'Michael', 'Feifer', 'director', 'producer', 'writer', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'Waltons', 'small', 'part.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ok', 'kids', 'followed', 'dog', 'animals', 'are', 'totally', 'bored', 'romance', 'adults-', 'mostly', 'bored', 'think', 'creators', 'are', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'please', 'keep', 'clean', 'applaud', 'Must', 'take', 'lot', 'patience', 'shoot', 'animal', 'close-ups']",N/A
