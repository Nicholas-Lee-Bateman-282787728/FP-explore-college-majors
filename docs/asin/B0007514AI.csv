Reasons why i'm not happy with this DVD?1) The exercise is hard on my knees, and i never had knee problems before.2) There are parts where they are going super fast and it's hard to do the exercise properly. Billy even says to make sure you do it properly if you want results, but by watching the people on the DVD, you can tell that they're going so fast that even they can't do it properly.3) The counting is way off and you do work out one side more than the other, this is not what I spent money for.  I could work out on my own if I didnt care about the counting and such, they're supposedly professionals and should pay careful attention to details like those.4) The chit chat, or 'encouragement' of the background people is obnoxiuos, specially the blond.5) No where on the DVD does it mention anything about the bands, that was also very upsetting. i tried using ankle weights and light weights, but it is not the same, I'm afraid of kicking too hard and have the ankle weight fly into my tv screen.conclusion: I wish I could return the DVD.",2,Big dissapointment,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1186,"['was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'video', 'watching', 'hearing', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'years', 'i', 'finally', 'broke', 'down', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Reasons', 'why', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'happy', 'DVD', '1', 'exercise', 'hard', 'knees', 'i', 'never', 'had', 'knee', 'problems', 'before.2', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'fast', 'hard', 'do', 'exercise', 'properly', 'Billy', 'even', 'make', 'sure', 'do', 'properly', 'want', 'results', 'watching', 'people', 'DVD', 'can', 'tell', ""'re"", 'going', 'so', 'fast', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'properly.3', 'counting', 'way', 'do', 'work', 'out', 'one', 'side', 'more', 'other', 'not', 'what', 'spent', 'money', 'could', 'work', 'out', 'own', 'didnt', 'care', 'counting', 'such', ""'re"", 'supposedly', 'professionals', 'should', 'pay', 'careful', 'attention', 'details', 'those.4', 'chit', 'chat', ""'"", 'background', 'people', 'obnoxiuos', 'specially', 'blond.5', 'No', 'where', 'DVD', 'mention', 'anything', 'bands', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'upsetting', 'i', 'tried', 'using', 'ankle', 'weights', 'light', 'weights', 'not', 'same', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'kicking', 'too', 'hard', 'have', 'ankle', 'weight', 'fly', 'tv', 'screen.conclusion', 'wish', 'could', 'return', 'DVD']",N/A

I do have 1LB hand weights that fit in your palm and I used them with this DVD also... However, I went and got some medium level work out bands (a bit harder than they ones they use in the video) and man does it change the level of the work out. The kicking is pretty much the same... but if you have a good workout band while you're doing all the punching - it is hard to keep your hands up the whole time. I have a feeling some of the people that didn't like this DVD and thought it was easy were either not using the bands or using ones that were too easy..It is a bit disorganized and I try to focus more on Shelly on one of the other people while Billy is talking b/c he is a bit distracting. Plus once I got used to the sequence of the exercises I knew when he was going to have us quit early or do an extra set so it didnt bother me as much.But overall this is a good workout, by the end I am (no lie) dripping sweat onto the floor. The kicking can be a bit much for people that are not that flexible - so you may want to be cautious of that.",4,Must use bands for optimal results,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,1138,"['When', 'first', 'did', 'DVD', 'did', 'bands', 'was', 'decent', 'cardio', 'workout', 'do', 'have', '1LB', 'hand', 'weights', 'fit', 'palm', 'used', 'DVD', 'also', 'However', 'went', 'got', 'medium', 'level', 'work', 'bands', 'bit', 'harder', 'ones', 'use', 'video', 'man', 'change', 'level', 'work', 'out', 'kicking', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'have', 'good', 'workout', 'band', ""'re"", 'doing', 'punching', 'hard', 'keep', 'hands', 'whole', 'time', 'have', 'feeling', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'easy', 'were', 'either', 'not', 'using', 'bands', 'using', 'ones', 'were', 'too', 'easy..It', 'bit', 'disorganized', 'try', 'focus', 'more', 'Shelly', 'one', 'other', 'people', 'Billy', 'talking', 'bit', 'distracting', 'once', 'got', 'used', 'sequence', 'exercises', 'knew', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'quit', 'early', 'do', 'extra', 'set', 'bother', 'much.But', 'good', 'workout', 'end', 'am', 'lie', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'floor', 'kicking', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'flexible', 'may', 'want', 'be', 'cautious']",N/A

876846,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B0007514AI,Colleen M. Schneider,"[0, 0]","I know that many have said that the Tae Bo workouts are mostly the same and having only the Basic DVD that has instructional, Basic & Advanced dvd's I would not know if this is much different or not.  Many of the moves I knew from the set I had, but the moves were done in different combos and I felt this dvd was somewhere between the basic & advanced versions that I do now.  I had my pedometer on while I did the dvd and logged in 3700+ steps in the 46 minutes that the dvd ran and I did work up a sweat, even without the strength bands.  I am quite sure adding extra resistance would tone you up even quicker and would be a nice challenge, but even as a daily exerciser, if you use your own body's resistance and are mindful of working the muscle you will get a good workout.  Hel-lo triceps....I can still feel them from doing the workout this morning.A few cautions: if you are a beginner you need to pace yourself.  It is too easy to start at a level that you are not up to yet and it is easy to start off with sloppy form because you are trying to go fast or harming yourself without having your body in proper alignment. It is much better to go more slowly and make sure that you are doing the exercise correctly. The speed will come, but good form should always be a constant.  I would also caution that you will need to be careful if you are working on carpet to make sure you do not twist your knees.I tried this as a borrowed dvd and am considering purchase.  I felt the dvd gave me a good workout and was fun.  If I do purchase this I would also seek out the resistance bands used in the workout as well as I would like the option of taking it up another notch, but again, without the weights it is a completely satisfying cardio workout in and of itself.",4,A good work out even without the bands...,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,1769,"['know', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'workouts', 'are', 'mostly', 'same', 'having', 'only', 'Basic', 'DVD', 'instructional', 'Basic', 'Advanced', 'dvd', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'different', 'not', 'Many', 'moves', 'knew', 'set', 'had', 'moves', 'were', 'done', 'different', 'combos', 'felt', 'dvd', 'was', 'somewhere', 'basic', 'advanced', 'versions', 'do', 'now', 'had', 'pedometer', 'did', 'dvd', 'logged', '3700+', 'steps', '46', 'minutes', 'dvd', 'ran', 'did', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'even', 'strength', 'am', 'quite', 'sure', 'adding', 'extra', 'resistance', 'would', 'tone', 'up', 'even', 'quicker', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'challenge', 'even', 'daily', 'exerciser', 'use', 'own', 'body', 'resistance', 'are', 'mindful', 'working', 'muscle', 'will', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'Hel-lo', 'triceps', '.I', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'doing', 'workout', 'morning.A', 'few', 'cautions', 'are', 'beginner', 'need', 'pace', 'too', 'easy', 'start', 'level', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'easy', 'start', 'off', 'sloppy', 'form', 'are', 'trying', 'go', 'fast', 'harming', 'having', 'body', 'proper', 'alignment', 'much', 'better', 'go', 'more', 'slowly', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'doing', 'exercise', 'correctly', 'speed', 'will', 'come', 'good', 'form', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'constant', 'would', 'also', 'caution', 'will', 'need', 'be', 'careful', 'are', 'working', 'carpet', 'make', 'sure', 'do', 'not', 'twist', 'knees.I', 'tried', 'borrowed', 'dvd', 'am', 'considering', 'purchase', 'felt', 'dvd', 'gave', 'good', 'workout', 'was', 'fun', 'do', 'purchase', 'would', 'also', 'seek', 'out', 'resistance', 'bands', 'used', 'workout', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'like', 'option', 'taking', 'up', 'notch', 'again', 'weights', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'cardio', 'workout']",N/A
876847,A3RPIWCD656PMH,B0007514AI,Gypsy82,"[33, 36]","This is a good workout but not as cardio intensive as the Get Ripped Advanced workouts.  If you can get through the Get Ripped Advanced Workouts then you will have no problem with this.  I have been doing Tae Bo for a long time and I have no problem getting through this workout. Personally, I think the ""Total Body Fatblaster"" is more cardio intensive and gives a better workout.  However, it is 55 minutes while this workout is only 45 minutes, which is nice.  If you are a beginner or have never done any of Billy's workouts then you will find this workout difficult.  He does alot of kicks and punches with and without the bands.  You need to know what you are doing so you don't injure yourself.  As always, his warm-ups and cool downs are a bit short.  Overall, I gave it 3 stars because compared to his other workouts, I don't think it is as cardio intensive.  If you have been doing Tae Bo and Billy's workouts for a long time, then you may find that you can get a better workout with some of his other tapes.

My sister told me of two new workouts that go along with the Billy Bands so I decided to try them out.  This was the first one I tried and felt that it was good, but definitely not Billy's best video.  The bands definitely add power to some of the moves causing you to sweat a lot more, but there are a few things where I feel that the bands are pointless.  The first move I'm thinking of is a jab, cross, jab and then a round house kick.  The bands are great for the arm part, but when you go to the round there is no resistance on the band so the band flies around.  The other move is a jab, cross, jab and pause and then a contact jab.  This combo is fine when doing it slow because there is an actual pause, but when he ups the tempo it's just a very awkward combo.  I noticed that even a few of the people in the background messed up.  In the beginning his counting is uneven and during one of the combos, I felt that Shellie and the others were counting at super speed.  Having said all of this, I did like the challenge of the bands and felt that it was a good workout.  It was a lot of the same things that were in the other videos and if the bands weren't involved it would just be another Taebo video.  I will keep the video and use it periodically, but it is by far not my favorite Taebo.",3,Not As Good As Expected...,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,1445,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'taebo', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Billy', 'Bands', 'have', 'bootcamp', 'workouts', 'really', 'enjoy', 'sister', 'told', 'two', 'new', 'workouts', 'go', 'along', 'Billy', 'Bands', 'decided', 'try', 'out', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'tried', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'definitely', 'not', 'Billy', 'best', 'video', 'bands', 'definitely', 'add', 'power', 'moves', 'causing', 'sweat', 'lot', 'more', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'where', 'feel', 'bands', 'are', 'pointless', 'first', 'move', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'jab', 'cross', 'jab', 'then', 'round', 'house', 'kick', 'bands', 'are', 'great', 'arm', 'part', 'when', 'go', 'round', 'resistance', 'band', 'band', 'around', 'other', 'move', 'jab', 'cross', 'jab', 'pause', 'then', 'contact', 'jab', 'combo', 'fine', 'when', 'doing', 'slow', 'actual', 'pause', 'when', 'ups', 'tempo', 'just', 'very', 'awkward', 'combo', 'noticed', 'even', 'few', 'people', 'background', 'messed', 'up', 'beginning', 'counting', 'uneven', 'one', 'combos', 'felt', 'Shellie', 'others', 'were', 'counting', 'super', 'speed', 'Having', 'said', 'did', 'challenge', 'bands', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'workout', 'was', 'lot', 'same', 'things', 'were', 'other', 'videos', 'bands', 'were', ""n't"", 'involved', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'Taebo', 'video', 'will', 'keep', 'video', 'use', 'periodically', 'far', 'not', 'favorite', 'Taebo']",N/A
