After watching this DVD, I had mixed feelings...it sure brings back memories! I am sure to get all the full 130 episodes DVD sets! The parts I like are the 'what we have learnt today' at the end of every episode. They may sound corny and old fashion, but hey! Here's what I was being taught when I was a kid. Pay attention to some of the teachings and they really mean something great. I have proven to grow up as a nice, kind and normal person. I would like to thank all the producers and staffs of Filmation for the wonderful show He-Man and all the hardwork they have done for more than 20 years ago.

905535,ATR72FW8LEZV1,B0009HBPHQ,C. L. Hanson,"[3, 3]","I remember watching He-Man every day after school, even if it was a re-run I've seen 100 times. I was an avid He-Man action figure collector, and really enjoyed the cartoon. Now, 22 years later, I can finally watch He-Man on the majesty of DVD.First off, this creation was really done first class. The packaging is wonderful, and the cool trading cards inside were a nice touch. This could have been slapped together in no time, but you can tell just by the overall presentation on the box and the inner linings that this was carefully done, and was made to appease the audience that clamored for it. Very well done.Now to the actual DVD's themselves. The colors, the picture and the sound are terrific. I didn't have anything to compare it to except my 22-23 year old memories. It's amazing what I can still remember (the background music especially), and what I've forgotten. My wife thought I was a complete nerd as I sat on the couch watching these episodes. I don't care. It's been so long since I've seen some of these episodes, that I wonder if I somehow never saw them. But, old age can creep up on you.What's even cooler is that even more releases of the cartoon are coming. I recommend this DVD set to anybody who was ever a fan of this great show. They don't make them like this anymore. Computer animation may be cutting edge and all that, but you simply just cannot compare to great storytelling, and good old fashioned drawing and paint!BUY IT!",5,I COMMAND THE JAWBRIDGE...OPEN!,1121385600,"07 15, 2005",2005,1458,"['remember', 'watching', 'He-Man', 'day', 'school', 'even', 'was', 're-run', ""'ve"", 'seen', '100', 'times', 'was', 'avid', 'He-Man', 'action', 'figure', 'collector', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'cartoon', 'Now', '22', 'years', 'later', 'can', 'finally', 'watch', 'He-Man', 'majesty', 'DVD.First', 'off', 'creation', 'was', 'really', 'done', 'first', 'class', 'packaging', 'wonderful', 'cool', 'trading', 'cards', 'were', 'nice', 'touch', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'slapped', 'together', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'just', 'overall', 'presentation', 'box', 'inner', 'linings', 'was', 'carefully', 'done', 'was', 'made', 'appease', 'audience', 'clamored', 'Very', 'well', 'done.Now', 'actual', 'DVD', 'colors', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'terrific', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'compare', 'except', '22-23', 'year', 'old', 'memories', 'amazing', 'what', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'background', 'music', 'especially', 'what', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'wife', 'thought', 'was', 'complete', 'nerd', 'sat', 'couch', 'watching', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'been', 'so', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'wonder', 'somehow', 'never', 'saw', 'old', 'age', 'can', 'creep', 'up', 'you.What', 'even', 'cooler', 'even', 'more', 'releases', 'cartoon', 'are', 'coming', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'anybody', 'who', 'was', 'ever', 'fan', 'great', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'Computer', 'animation', 'may', 'be', 'cutting', 'edge', 'simply', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'great', 'storytelling', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'drawing', 'paint', 'BUY', 'IT']",N/A
905536,A84STPNHGN7QW,B0009HBPHQ,Deanmozzer,"[4, 4]","If you've read the other reviews, you should know how the dvd came about and what the special features are.  I'm gonna go a little more in depth on these:First off, this dvd seems to be more of a promotional event than anything.  It wets your appetite for the release of all 130 episodes beginning on 10/18/05 with a six dvd set consisting of the first 33 episodes of the series.  The makers of these dvds know that buying one of the volumes is gonna be a commitment.  They want you to be sure that even if you liked He-Man as a kid, you will still like it as an adult, and invest in their product.  (Kind of like the whole toy thing all over again eh?)  Which is fair enough I guess since these cartoons are fun.  I'm glad I bought this dvd because I would have gone through the dilemma of whether to shell out the 50 bucks or so since I have not seen any of these episodes since I was 9.  He-Man, at least in my area, wasn't syndicated very much after the 80's, or if it was, I didn't get the channels.  So as big of a fan as I was growing up, I had to be sure that this was something I was still going to enjoy for more than just ""memories"".  Frankly, my memories lie more so with the toys, but that doesn't mean that I would still have fun playing with them.All this being said, it's a win-win situation.  The manufacturers win because they are making cash on episodes most of us will end up owning anyway and are making a stronger effort to ensure the success of four box-sets consisting of all the episodes by giving us - the fans, a taste of what they have to offer at a reasonable price.The fans win because ever since the advent of the 'dvd' and the appearance of cartoon 'seasons', we have been wondering ""When are they gonna do He-Man?!"".  Plus, two new documentaries specifically focusing on these 'favorite' episodes, (which likely won't also be on the full seasons) is worth it if you particularly liked these episodes.A few observations for those who have already seen it - (WARNING:  SEMI-Spoilers)I found the trivia during the scene selections to be particularly interesting.  I do wish, however, they would have been accessible apart from the scene selections as i'm a person who rarely goes through them and found it by accident.I understand these 'Best-Of' dvds weren't really meant to be stand-alone great dvds and really were put out to promote the seasons (I mean, couldn't the episodes deemed ""The Best"" have an asterisk on them in the full season sets?).  But I do hope they put a scene break between the intro music and the start of the episode.  Don't get me wrong, after all these years it was magical to see the abbreviated storyline at the beginning of every episode but around the 8th 'best' episode, I was getting tired of it.  It's nice to have a scene break for the ""moral"" of the story, but an extra one for the title would be nice.Lastly, we can go over what SHOULD have been on this dvd, like the real actors who gave these characters life with their voices rather than seeing an editor do (albeit, great) imitations.  But hopefully we will see it on the seasons.Janis Diamond is a MILF.Lee Crevenger - Didn't you just hate this guy?!  He reminds me of that kid in kindergarten that had all the He-Man toys (even the variants such as the He-Man with the sword sheath), and dressed up like He-Man for Halloween full body/muscle suit, boots and all.  I was so jealous of this kid because unlike me, he had blonde hair and didn't need a mask to look like He-Man.  All joking aside, I think it was nice to include a fan's perspective on the series and found the film cells interesting.It's finally here so you can have your fix and tell for certain if this is something you may want to invest in.  Just because I liked a cartoon when I was 5, doesn't mean that I will like it at 25.  As it turns out, this was not the case.  I still love He-Man.  I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out, and hopefully it serves as a catharsis for other shows of the same ilk that came out during the 80's and 90's to make their way onto dvd.  Gems such as SilverHawks and Conan The Adventurer I hope to see soon.  As it stands, Thundercats is coming out in August of '05, so fans of this genre of cartoons can finally celebrate.",4,Now we're getting somewhere!,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,4257,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'should', 'know', 'how', 'dvd', 'came', 'about', 'what', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""'m"", 'gon', 'go', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'First', 'dvd', 'be', 'more', 'promotional', 'event', 'anything', 'appetite', 'release', '130', 'episodes', 'beginning', '10/18/05', 'six', 'dvd', 'set', 'consisting', 'first', '33', 'episodes', 'series', 'makers', 'dvds', 'know', 'buying', 'one', 'volumes', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'commitment', 'want', 'be', 'sure', 'even', 'liked', 'He-Man', 'kid', 'will', 'still', 'like', 'adult', 'invest', 'product', 'Kind', 'whole', 'toy', 'thing', 'over', 'again', 'eh', 'fair', 'enough', 'guess', 'cartoons', 'are', 'fun', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'dvd', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'dilemma', 'shell', 'out', '50', 'bucks', 'so', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episodes', 'was', '9', 'He-Man', 'least', 'area', 'was', ""n't"", 'syndicated', 'very', 'much', '80', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'channels', 'So', 'big', 'fan', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'had', 'be', 'sure', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'enjoy', 'more', 'just', 'memories', 'Frankly', 'memories', 'lie', 'more', 'so', 'toys', ""n't"", 'mean', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'fun', 'playing', 'them.All', 'being', 'said', 'win-win', 'situation', 'manufacturers', 'win', 'are', 'making', 'cash', 'episodes', 'most', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'owning', 'anyway', 'are', 'making', 'stronger', 'effort', 'ensure', 'success', 'four', 'box-sets', 'consisting', 'episodes', 'giving', 'fans', 'taste', 'what', 'have', 'offer', 'reasonable', 'price.The', 'fans', 'win', 'ever', 'advent', ""'dvd"", 'appearance', 'cartoon', ""'seasons"", 'have', 'been', 'wondering', 'When', 'are', 'gon', 'do', 'He-Man', 'two', 'new', 'documentaries', 'specifically', 'focusing', ""'favorite"", 'episodes', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'also', 'be', 'full', 'seasons', 'particularly', 'liked', 'episodes.A', 'few', 'observations', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'WARNING', 'SEMI-Spoilers', 'found', 'trivia', 'scene', 'selections', 'be', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'do', 'wish', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'accessible', 'apart', 'scene', 'selections', 'i', ""'m"", 'person', 'who', 'rarely', 'found', 'accident.I', 'understand', ""'Best-Of"", 'dvds', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'meant', 'be', 'stand-alone', 'great', 'dvds', 'really', 'were', 'put', 'out', 'promote', 'seasons', 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'episodes', 'deemed', 'Best', 'have', 'asterisk', 'full', 'season', 'sets', 'do', 'hope', 'put', 'scene', 'break', 'intro', 'music', 'start', 'episode', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'years', 'was', 'magical', 'see', 'abbreviated', 'storyline', 'beginning', 'episode', '8th', ""'best"", 'episode', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'nice', 'have', 'scene', 'break', 'moral', 'story', 'extra', 'one', 'title', 'would', 'be', 'nice.Lastly', 'can', 'go', 'over', 'what', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'dvd', 'real', 'actors', 'who', 'gave', 'characters', 'life', 'voices', 'rather', 'seeing', 'editor', 'do', 'albeit', 'great', 'imitations', 'hopefully', 'will', 'see', 'seasons.Janis', 'Diamond', 'MILF.Lee', 'Crevenger', 'Did', ""n't"", 'just', 'hate', 'guy', 'kid', 'kindergarten', 'had', 'He-Man', 'toys', 'even', 'variants', 'such', 'He-Man', 'sword', 'sheath', 'dressed', 'up', 'He-Man', 'Halloween', 'full', 'body/muscle', 'suit', 'boots', 'was', 'so', 'jealous', 'kid', 'had', 'blonde', 'hair', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'mask', 'look', 'He-Man', 'joking', 'aside', 'think', 'was', 'nice', 'include', 'fan', 'perspective', 'series', 'found', 'film', 'cells', 'interesting.It', 'finally', 'here', 'can', 'have', 'fix', 'tell', 'certain', 'something', 'may', 'want', 'invest', 'Just', 'liked', 'cartoon', 'when', 'was', '5', ""n't"", 'mean', 'will', 'like', '25', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'still', 'love', 'He-Man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'rest', 'series', 'come', 'out', 'hopefully', 'catharsis', 'other', 'shows', 'same', 'ilk', 'came', 'out', '80', '90', 'make', 'way', 'dvd', 'Gems', 'such', 'SilverHawks', 'Conan', 'Adventurer', 'hope', 'see', 'soon', 'Thundercats', 'coming', 'out', 'August', ""'05"", 'so', 'fans', 'genre', 'cartoons', 'can', 'finally', 'celebrate']",N/A
905537,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0009HBPHQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","Way back in 1983, many of us who watched cartoons grew up with HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE.  The story about Prince Adam who has a secret which is being the hero known as HE-MAN.The series focused on the adventures of He-Man as he would go against the enemy hordes led by the evil Skeletor.The characters for the series were great and with a succesful toyline and a popular spinoff series (She-Ra, He-Man's twin sister) and another animated series which came out nearly a decade later, fans have been waiting for the series to come out on DVD.With the first season currently out on DVD, I opted for ""The Best Of"" featuring the top five episodes of season 1 and 2 voted by fans.It's one thing when you watch an older animated series that has been fully restored but it was even more fulfilling with the 2 new documentary features.These two documentaries pretty much focus on the show's producer, artists , writers and fans of the series, as they talk about each episode from no. 5 to no. 1 for both season one and two.What's even more impressive is they actually go into great detail about the episodes which I found fascinating.Upon watching the episodes, you realize that animation back then (in the U.S.) featured a bit of violence that you really don't see on TV animation these days.For example, the character of Man-at-War climbing a cliff while being pursuid by Mer-Man's lackey's.  Man-at-War uses an exploding device and the lackey's fall down the cliff to their doom and are seen lying on the ground.The DVD also comes with 2 collectible 4x6 cards by Bruce Timm and Adam Hughes, trivia and fun facts about the creation of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Trailers for upcoming He-Man releases and on DVD-Rom, scripts for the both #1 episodes.If you enjoyed this series from the past, definitely check out the first season box set.But if you are low on time and typically too busy to watch a full run of a series, and just want to watch the top five episodes for season 1 and 2 as voted by the fans, you really can't go wrong with this box set.

The Best of He-Man And The Masters of The Universe is awesome. Wow, wow, wow. It is so great to see the original He-Man series on DVD. The episodes look great. The packaging is colorful and awesome. The discs are stored on a box that opens up. This box has artwork on the front and back. The set includes two discs which each have art work on the cover. Disc one has a picture of He-Man and disc two has a picture of Skeletor. The package also includes a color booklet which features an episode guide and two collectable cards. The cards feature original He-Man artwork but the drawings do not look like the He-man from the animated series. The back of the cards feature bio's of people who worked on the series.This ""Best of"" set includes 10 episodes from the first season. Fans of the show are split. Some people wanted a full season, others are content with this release. I am one of the content people. A taste of He-Man is good enough for me and I will support future releases as well. Perhaps this inexpensive ""Best of"" was released to test the waters to see just how many people were interested in buying this series.As I mentioned, the episodes look great and at the end of each episode (not the moral lesson) there is text on the screen with Orko that descibes goofs or interesting tidbits about the episode just watched. The 10 episode set features episodes that fans of show voted as their favorites.

For some time now I have been hoping for the show to come out on dvd, and it finally is (next month for the entire first season). Until the first season comes out, ""The Best of He-Man and the Masters fo the Universe"" will have to do. ""The Best of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" is a best of collection from the show's first two seasons. Both discs contains a countain of the top five episodes from seasons 1 & 2.From season 1, I have to say that ""Evilseed"" is my favorite. Evilseed is this cabbage-looking villain who tries to take over Eternia with his evil plants, forcing He-Man and Skeletor to join forces. One of my favorite scenes was when Skeletor was forced to join forces with his most hated enemy, He-Man. His lines were hilarious although overdramatic. I also liked the episode ""Prince Adam No More"" when Prince Adam tries to prove himself to his father King Randor.On disc 2, I loved the story behind the Sorceress on ""The Origin of the Sorceress"". The only problem is how it didn't really mesh with her story from season 1 involving Teela called ""Teela's Quest"". It made no sense. I think the writers totally forgot about what happened in ""Teela's Quest"". Another great episode from season 2 is ""To Save Skeletor"" when He-Man has to clean the mess of what Skeletor made by bringing in a monster beyond his control into Eternia. Again this forces both He-Man and Skeletor to join forces. My personal favorite episode from this season is ""The Problem with Power"" where Skeletor tricks He-Man thinking that he was responsible for the plight of an innocent.Watching this best of collection brought back vivid memories of my love for this show. The dialogue is really over the top and hilarious. The animation may be out dated by some people's standards. All in all, I still love this show and I can't wait to get the first season on dvd.",5,Nostalgia at its best,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",2005,2028,"['grew', 'up', ""'80s"", 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'aspect', ""'80s"", 'was', 'cartoon', 'watched', 'One', 'favorite', 'shows', 'was', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'time', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'hoping', 'show', 'come', 'out', 'dvd', 'finally', 'next', 'month', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'out', 'Best', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'fo', 'Universe', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'Best', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'best', 'collection', 'show', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'discs', 'countain', 'top', 'five', 'episodes', 'seasons', '1', '2.From', 'season', '1', 'have', 'say', 'Evilseed', 'favorite', 'Evilseed', 'cabbage-looking', 'villain', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'Eternia', 'evil', 'plants', 'forcing', 'He-Man', 'Skeletor', 'join', 'forces', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'was', 'when', 'Skeletor', 'was', 'forced', 'join', 'forces', 'most', 'hated', 'enemy', 'He-Man', 'lines', 'were', 'hilarious', 'overdramatic', 'also', 'liked', 'episode', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'No', 'More', 'when', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'prove', 'father', 'King', 'Randor.On', '2', 'loved', 'story', 'Sorceress', 'Origin', 'Sorceress', 'only', 'problem', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'mesh', 'story', 'season', '1', 'involving', 'Teela', 'called', 'Teela', 'Quest', 'made', 'sense', 'think', 'writers', 'totally', 'forgot', 'what', 'happened', 'Teela', 'Quest', 'great', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'Save', 'Skeletor', 'when', 'He-Man', 'clean', 'mess', 'what', 'Skeletor', 'made', 'bringing', 'monster', 'control', 'Eternia', 'Again', 'forces', 'He-Man', 'Skeletor', 'join', 'forces', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'Problem', 'Power', 'where', 'Skeletor', 'He-Man', 'thinking', 'was', 'responsible', 'plight', 'innocent.Watching', 'best', 'collection', 'brought', 'back', 'vivid', 'memories', 'love', 'show', 'dialogue', 'really', 'top', 'hilarious', 'animation', 'may', 'be', 'out', 'dated', 'people', 'standards', 'still', 'love', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'first', 'season', 'dvd']",N/A
905540,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B0009HBPHQ,Garrett Aja,"[1, 3]","For a generation of children, He-Man is a near iconic figure, and without a doubt one of the most popular toylines and cartoons ever created. However, like most of the highly succesful cartoons of the 1980s, it hasn't been seen on home video or TV for years.So, when the Filmation library was sold to Entertainment Rights and plans for DVD releases were announced, there was must rejoicing. And even more so when the He-Man set was announced as having a ton of special features, starting with this best of set, which is part of a publicity blitz connected with the 2005 San Diego Comic Con (the largest comic book convention in the US). All things seemed fine, until more in-depth details were recently revealed.""Diamond Ray of Disappearance"" (the series premiere) is edited-a decent-sized chunk is missing around the act break (when Orko escapes from the palace). The missing section may be released, unrestored, as a special feature at some point, on a future set. This reason for this peculiar act, however, lies in the restoration of the series, which was done by Hallmark in the '90s. While everything I've seen implies a wonderful picture, there's a problem: it was done for the European PAL television format, and has therefore resulted in episodes being sped up by over a half minute in this American NTSC release.Given that these two problems (editing and PAL-related speed-up) have also plagued the Fat Albert DVDs to date, this reviewer is less than a happy camper. And given that this and future He-Man DVDs will be loaded to the gills with special features (which at most can be enjoyed once), it seems like someone's priorities are out of whack, and/or that there's not enough money available to perform a proper restoration, or even a simple transfer from the original film or the original US broadcast masters. I for one would also pay a few dollars more per set if that's what it would take to get a correctly timed version of the series. Alas, this is not to be. And the few die-hard viewers who may notice the difference (to quote the DVD publisher) must wait even longer for our He-Man fix on DVD. I know for certain that I won't be laying down my money for such a flawed release. *sighs*",2,Another disappointing TV-to-DVD release *sigh*,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,2208,"['generation', 'children', 'He-Man', 'near', 'iconic', 'figure', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'toylines', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'created', 'However', 'most', 'highly', 'succesful', 'cartoons', '1980s', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'home', 'video', 'TV', 'years.So', 'when', 'Filmation', 'library', 'was', 'sold', 'Entertainment', 'Rights', 'plans', 'DVD', 'releases', 'were', 'announced', 'was', 'must', 'rejoicing', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'He-Man', 'set', 'was', 'announced', 'having', 'ton', 'special', 'features', 'starting', 'best', 'set', 'part', 'publicity', 'blitz', 'connected', '2005', 'San', 'Diego', 'Comic', 'Con', 'largest', 'comic', 'book', 'convention', 'US', 'things', 'seemed', 'fine', 'more', 'in-depth', 'details', 'were', 'recently', 'revealed', 'Diamond', 'Ray', 'Disappearance', 'series', 'premiere', 'edited-a', 'decent-sized', 'chunk', 'missing', 'act', 'break', 'when', 'Orko', 'palace', 'missing', 'section', 'may', 'be', 'released', 'unrestored', 'special', 'feature', 'point', 'future', 'set', 'reason', 'peculiar', 'act', 'however', 'restoration', 'series', 'was', 'done', 'Hallmark', ""'90s"", 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'implies', 'wonderful', 'picture', 'problem', 'was', 'done', 'European', 'PAL', 'television', 'format', 'therefore', 'resulted', 'episodes', 'being', 'sped', 'up', 'half', 'minute', 'American', 'NTSC', 'release.Given', 'two', 'problems', 'editing', 'PAL-related', 'speed-up', 'have', 'also', 'plagued', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'DVDs', 'date', 'reviewer', 'less', 'happy', 'camper', 'given', 'future', 'He-Man', 'DVDs', 'will', 'be', 'loaded', 'gills', 'special', 'features', 'most', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'once', 'someone', 'priorities', 'are', 'whack', 'and/or', 'not', 'enough', 'money', 'available', 'perform', 'proper', 'restoration', 'even', 'simple', 'transfer', 'original', 'film', 'original', 'US', 'broadcast', 'masters', 'one', 'would', 'also', 'pay', 'few', 'dollars', 'more', 'set', 'what', 'would', 'take', 'get', 'correctly', 'timed', 'version', 'series', 'Alas', 'not', 'be', 'few', 'die-hard', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'notice', 'difference', 'quote', 'DVD', 'publisher', 'must', 'wait', 'even', 'longer', 'He-Man', 'fix', 'DVD', 'know', 'certain', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'laying', 'money', 'flawed', 'release', '*sighs*']",N/A

905543,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B0009HBPHQ,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[3, 3]","THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SPOILERS IN THE FOLLOWING REVIEW:REVIEWOverall, ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" is a seminal animated series whose legacy is secure.  But, this ten show collection does leave a lot to be desired.  The episodes that comprise it were voted on online by fans of the show.  I think  this may be a fairly unique method of marketing, but it doesn't necessarily represent the ten best shows out of one hundred thirty total shows produced.Granted, by the strictest definition, picking the ten best episodes of the series may be an impossible task. This is a two-disc set, with Disc One supposedly representing the five best episodes of the first season.  Disc Two means to represent the five best episodes of the second season.  On the first disc, you get the episodes ""Evilseed,"" ""Quest for He-Man,"" ""Prince Adam No More,"" ""Diamond Ray of Disappearance"" and ""Teela's Quest."" Disc Two brings you ""Into The Abyss,"" ""Teela's Triumph,"" ""To Save Skeletor,"" ""The Problem With Power"" and ""Origin of the Sorceress.""  On the first disc, only ""Prince Adam No More"" and ""Teela's Quest"" are genuinely worthy of inclusion on this set.  ""Diamond Ray of Disappearance"" was the first episode aired of the series and a lot of people love it.  I like it, but it is a flat story.  Skeletor procures the title diamond ray, and wants to use it to send his enemies to another dimension.  It is truly thrilling watching He-Man solve the problem, but the show is flat until then.  ""Evilseed"" and ""Quest for He-Man"" are good ideas gone fairly ridiculous.  Animation had not evolved enough to make Evilseed the plant being credible as a character, and an intriguing idea in ""Quest for He-Man""(He-Man is overpowered, and sent to another dimension by Skeletor)is ruined by a ridiculous giant rabbit ruling the planet on which He-Man finds himself.  ""Prince Adam No More"" and ""Teela's Quest"" both powerfully involve the search for family identity and acceptance, and are justifiably included.  The episodes representing the second season fare much better.  Only ""To Save Skeletor"" is truly a clunker, and the rest of the episodes are very good to great on this disc.  I still would have put some other different shows on the second disc.I would have liked to have seen a collection made up of favorite shows of the series' surviving voice actors and creative staff.  As a disclaimer, I found out this set was being released after it had been voted on and packaged.  My vote would have gone for first season shows ""Evil-Lyn's Plot,"" ""Masks of Power,"" ""The Mystery of Man-E-Faces"", the two-part ""House of Shokoti"" and ""Double Edged Sword.""  On the second season best-of disc, I would replace ""To Save Skeletor"" with ""The Witch and The Warrior,"" a very strong Paul Dini-penned script.  Strictly speaking, one could also replace ""Into the Abyss"" and ""Teela's Triumph"" with ""The Rainbow Warrior"" and ""Battlecat,"" and have two significantly upgraded shows.  I like ""Teela's Triumph,"" but this collection overdoes Teela-themed shows.  ""Into the Abyss"" is another example of that, as Teela falls into the chasm surrounding Castle Grayskull and has to be rescued by He-Man.  ""The Rainbow Warrior"" enriches Queen Marlena's character with a fairly sophisticated story, and hints that she may know more about Adam than she usually lets on.  ""Battlecat"" is a touching origin story for He-Man's fierce green feline mount.  ""The Problem With Power"" and ""Origin of the Sorceress"" are both untouchable gold.I love this series as a whole, but this particular set is definitely a mixed bag.  On the bright side, they did eventually release the entire series on DVD.",3,This is a tough one to rate,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,3653,"['ARE', 'SIGNIFICANT', 'AMOUNT', 'OF', 'SPOILERS', 'IN', 'THE', 'FOLLOWING', 'REVIEW', 'REVIEWOverall', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'seminal', 'animated', 'series', 'legacy', 'secure', 'show', 'collection', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'episodes', 'comprise', 'were', 'voted', 'online', 'fans', 'show', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'fairly', 'unique', 'method', 'marketing', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'represent', 'ten', 'best', 'one', 'hundred', 'thirty', 'total', 'shows', 'produced.Granted', 'strictest', 'definition', 'picking', 'ten', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'impossible', 'task', 'two-disc', 'set', 'Disc', 'One', 'supposedly', 'representing', 'five', 'best', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'Disc', 'Two', 'means', 'represent', 'five', 'best', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'disc', 'get', 'episodes', 'Evilseed', 'Quest', 'He-Man', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'No', 'More', 'Diamond', 'Ray', 'Disappearance', 'Teela', 'Quest', 'Disc', 'Two', 'Abyss', 'Teela', 'Triumph', 'Save', 'Skeletor', 'Problem', 'Power', 'Origin', 'Sorceress', 'first', 'disc', 'only', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'No', 'More', 'Teela', 'Quest', 'are', 'genuinely', 'worthy', 'inclusion', 'set', 'Diamond', 'Ray', 'Disappearance', 'was', 'first', 'episode', 'aired', 'series', 'lot', 'people', 'love', 'flat', 'story', 'Skeletor', 'title', 'diamond', 'ray', 'use', 'send', 'enemies', 'dimension', 'truly', 'thrilling', 'watching', 'He-Man', 'solve', 'problem', 'show', 'flat', 'then', 'Evilseed', 'Quest', 'He-Man', 'are', 'good', 'ideas', 'gone', 'fairly', 'ridiculous', 'Animation', 'had', 'not', 'evolved', 'enough', 'make', 'Evilseed', 'plant', 'being', 'credible', 'character', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'Quest', 'He-Man', 'He-Man', 'overpowered', 'sent', 'dimension', 'Skeletor', 'ruined', 'ridiculous', 'giant', 'rabbit', 'ruling', 'planet', 'He-Man', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'No', 'More', 'Teela', 'Quest', 'powerfully', 'involve', 'search', 'family', 'identity', 'acceptance', 'are', 'justifiably', 'included', 'episodes', 'representing', 'second', 'season', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'Only', 'Save', 'Skeletor', 'truly', 'clunker', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'disc', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'other', 'different', 'shows', 'second', 'disc.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'collection', 'made', 'favorite', 'shows', 'series', 'surviving', 'voice', 'actors', 'creative', 'staff', 'disclaimer', 'found', 'out', 'set', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'had', 'been', 'voted', 'packaged', 'vote', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'first', 'season', 'Evil-Lyn', 'Plot', 'Masks', 'Power', 'Mystery', 'Man-E-Faces', 'two-part', 'House', 'Shokoti', 'Double', 'Edged', 'Sword', 'second', 'season', 'best-of', 'disc', 'would', 'replace', 'Save', 'Skeletor', 'Witch', 'Warrior', 'very', 'strong', 'Paul', 'Dini-penned', 'script', 'Strictly', 'speaking', 'one', 'could', 'also', 'replace', 'Into', 'Abyss', 'Teela', 'Triumph', 'Rainbow', 'Warrior', 'Battlecat', 'have', 'two', 'significantly', 'upgraded', 'shows', 'Teela', 'Triumph', 'collection', 'Teela-themed', 'shows', 'Abyss', 'example', 'Teela', 'chasm', 'surrounding', 'Castle', 'Grayskull', 'be', 'rescued', 'He-Man', 'Rainbow', 'Warrior', 'Queen', 'Marlena', 'character', 'fairly', 'sophisticated', 'story', 'hints', 'may', 'know', 'more', 'Adam', 'usually', 'Battlecat', 'touching', 'origin', 'story', 'He-Man', 'fierce', 'green', 'feline', 'mount', 'Problem', 'Power', 'Origin', 'Sorceress', 'are', 'untouchable', 'gold.I', 'love', 'series', 'whole', 'particular', 'set', 'definitely', 'mixed', 'bag', 'bright', 'side', 'did', 'eventually', 'release', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD']",N/A

905547,AM6SOTOKGRZGA,B0009HBPHQ,Jerry McDaniel,"[1, 1]","He-Man and the characters that appeared on this series were derived from a toy-line. The collection boasts 10 episodes on two DVD's combining five from season #1 and five from season #2. HE-MAN had a much longer run than what I assume Filmation had intended...the show was a gigantic hit and it ran for two full seasons, 1983-1985, and 130 episodes. The episodes became wildly popular and it ran in syndication for several years after production of new episodes ended.This is a good collection for those new to the series...it gives you a taste of what the show was all about. The more dedicated fans are more likely to buy the larger DVD collections, though. The villains were just as popular as the good-guy's: Skeletor, Beast Man, Evil Lyn, Trap Jaw, Whiplash, Mer-Man, and several others fought He-Man and company constantly. Skeletor ran his base of operations from Snake Mountain. The action took place on Eternia...the planet was ran by a Royal couple named King Randor and Queen Marlena. They have a son, Prince Adam, who possesses a sword of power which enables him to transform into He-Man.The sword's power rests underneath Castle Greyskull in what was called the abyss. When Adam calls out his popular catchphrase ""By the power of Greyskull...I have the power!!!"" he changes into He-Man...no matter where he happens to be, each time he shouts out the magic phrase, he instantly appears in front of the Castle with the power charging into his sword from the abyss.As a sub-plot to the show, Skeletor constantly tries to over-take Castle Greyskull because he thinks it holds the secrets to becoming the ruler of Eternia. Nobody on the show knows that Prince Adam is He-Man except Orko, Man-At-Arms, and the Sorceress. In an unusual twist, the cartoon had a uniquely ""family"" quality...with a soap opera-like direction: on-going characters, feuds, story arcs, etc etc. Teela was Prince Adam's foil...she was constantly on his case about him being lazy...clueless that he was really He-Man. Duncan, whose professional name was Man-At-Arms, was Teela's step-father. Teela's birth mother is the Sorceress but the secret was kept from her.

I will review the show when it comes out on the first season coming this october but for now, i am reviewing this 2-Disc edition. It contains the 10 best episodes chosen by the fans of the 80's cult TV toon with 5 episodes each on 2 discs. They contain the episodes "" Quest for Teela"" which is about Teela trying to find who her mother as she heads to the oracle to find the answers until one of Skeletor's henchmen ""Mer-Man"" interrupts then on to Evilseed"" that deals with a cabbage-headed vegetable creature who has powerful plants to take over eternia including Snake Mountain but the only way to stop him is the forces of good and evil to join together. "" Prince Adam No More"" has Prince Adam wanting to make his father proud to proove that he isn't a goof all the time is stunned when his father is kidnapped by Beast-Man to impress Skeletor as Beast-Man was banished by everyone's favorite skullhead, "" The Diamond Ray of Disappearence"" has Skeletor with a powerful magical diamond that can send people to another dimension as only He-Man is the one that can crush the diamond. "" Into the Abyss"", Prince Adam and Teela are having a fun game in the forest until Teela falls into the abyss of Castle Greyskull with only He-Man to save her. Next up ""Teela's Triumph"" is about The Sorceress who's daughter Teela was missing had just disappeared into another dimension, Teela is worried as her mother was taken away leaving her to take the place of the sorceress as the mightiest warrior on Eternia is gone leaving Teela to deal with Skeletor who wants unlimited power. ""To Save Skeletor"" deals with Skeletor and his evil clan summons a powerful being from another dimension ( whom is almost remescence of the creature from ""Rock & Rule"" and Jabba the Hutt) as it wants to take over the planet and Greyskull, only Skeletor with his clan can join forces with the good guys especially He-Man and Sorceress to battle this dark fiend, next "" The Origin of the Sorceress"" tells how a wargod named ""Morgoth"" returns after many years to destroy humanity as He-Man and the sorceress must go to the ancient place where she tells her story of how she became the sorceress and fought Morgoth before. And now my two personal fave episodes "" Quest for He-Man"" and "" The Problem With Power"", now ""Problem with Power"" is a powerful moralistic episode about He-Man whom accidently kills an innocent man has just given up his power of responsiblity as Skeletor has tricked him and "" Quest"" has Ram-Man, Cringer and Orko to search for He-Man who just got his memory erased and sent to a wacky planet of animals contaminated by a evil rabbit being.The DVDs have good picture and sound with cool extras like Scripts for ""Teela's Quest"" and "" Origin of the Sorceress"", On the chapters pages of the episodes there are fun facts and trivia, trailer for the upcoming season 1 with full season 1 episodes and 2 documentary featurettes with interviews by fans and the staff of the show.Highly recommended! i also recommend "" Thundercats"", ""She-Ra"" and "" Transformers"".",5,10 great episodes on a superb 2-Disc collector's edition!,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3182,"['First', 'show', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'TV', 'Shows', 'i', 'was', 'young', 'i', 'am', 'still', 'fan', 'classic', 'superhero/fantasy', 'show', 'will', 'review', 'show', 'when', 'out', 'first', 'season', 'coming', 'october', 'now', 'i', 'am', 'reviewing', '2-Disc', 'edition', '10', 'best', 'episodes', 'chosen', 'fans', '80', 'cult', 'TV', 'toon', '5', 'episodes', '2', 'discs', 'contain', 'episodes', 'Quest', 'Teela', 'Teela', 'trying', 'find', 'who', 'mother', 'oracle', 'find', 'answers', 'one', 'Skeletor', 'henchmen', 'Mer-Man', 'interrupts', 'then', 'Evilseed', 'deals', 'cabbage-headed', 'vegetable', 'creature', 'who', 'powerful', 'plants', 'take', 'over', 'eternia', 'including', 'Snake', 'Mountain', 'only', 'way', 'stop', 'forces', 'good', 'evil', 'join', 'together.', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'No', 'More', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'wanting', 'make', 'father', 'proud', 'proove', ""n't"", 'goof', 'time', 'stunned', 'when', 'father', 'kidnapped', 'Beast-Man', 'impress', 'Skeletor', 'Beast-Man', 'was', 'banished', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'skullhead', 'Diamond', 'Ray', 'Disappearence', 'Skeletor', 'powerful', 'magical', 'diamond', 'can', 'send', 'people', 'dimension', 'only', 'He-Man', 'one', 'can', 'crush', 'diamond.', 'Abyss', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'Teela', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'game', 'forest', 'Teela', 'abyss', 'Castle', 'Greyskull', 'only', 'He-Man', 'save', 'Next', 'Teela', 'Triumph', 'Sorceress', 'who', 'daughter', 'Teela', 'was', 'missing', 'had', 'just', 'disappeared', 'dimension', 'Teela', 'worried', 'mother', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'leaving', 'take', 'place', 'sorceress', 'mightiest', 'warrior', 'Eternia', 'gone', 'leaving', 'Teela', 'deal', 'Skeletor', 'who', 'unlimited', 'power', 'Save', 'Skeletor', 'deals', 'Skeletor', 'evil', 'clan', 'summons', 'powerful', 'being', 'dimension', 'whom', 'almost', 'remescence', 'creature', 'Rock', 'Rule', 'Jabba', 'Hutt', 'take', 'over', 'planet', 'Greyskull', 'only', 'Skeletor', 'clan', 'can', 'join', 'forces', 'good', 'guys', 'especially', 'He-Man', 'Sorceress', 'battle', 'dark', 'fiend', 'next', 'Origin', 'Sorceress', 'how', 'wargod', 'named', 'Morgoth', 'returns', 'many', 'years', 'destroy', 'humanity', 'He-Man', 'sorceress', 'must', 'go', 'ancient', 'place', 'where', 'story', 'how', 'became', 'sorceress', 'fought', 'Morgoth', 'now', 'two', 'personal', 'fave', 'episodes', 'Quest', 'He-Man', 'Problem', 'Power', 'now', 'Problem', 'Power', 'powerful', 'moralistic', 'episode', 'He-Man', 'whom', 'accidently', 'innocent', 'man', 'just', 'given', 'up', 'power', 'responsiblity', 'Skeletor', 'tricked', 'Quest', 'Ram-Man', 'Cringer', 'Orko', 'search', 'He-Man', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'memory', 'erased', 'sent', 'wacky', 'planet', 'animals', 'contaminated', 'evil', 'rabbit', 'being.The', 'DVDs', 'have', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'cool', 'extras', 'Scripts', 'Teela', 'Quest', 'Origin', 'Sorceress', 'chapters', 'pages', 'episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'facts', 'trivia', 'trailer', 'upcoming', 'season', '1', 'full', 'season', '1', 'episodes', '2', 'documentary', 'featurettes', 'interviews', 'fans', 'staff', 'show.Highly', 'recommended', 'i', 'also', 'recommend', 'Thundercats', 'She-Ra', 'Transformers']",N/A

The cover and interior photos are fabulous, and the DVD set comes with two 4 x 6 postcards featuring ""Masters of the Universe"" comic book art. It's gorgeous!Now on to the best part...the DVDs themselves! This is a two-disc collection of ten classic ""He-Man"" episodes.

The restoration of the cartoon is amazing...it looks absolutely beautiful, with no graniness at all! The sound is greet, the navigation menus are great, and the bonus features are FABULOUS!

905552,AHF97M45JFCB,B0009HBPHQ,ONENEO,"[1, 1]","Believe it or not, The Best of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe was the DVD release from BCI that started it all. While it hasn't been said officially, it certainly appears as though the positive reaction of fans of the series led to BCI's continued dedication to bringing each and every single episode of the classic Filmation epic to DVD release.As I said in my review for the best of She-Ra (also from BCI), 10-best sets are a great idea for many reasons; not only are they typically much more affordable than buying entire series box sets, they are also a great way for a potential fan to discover whether or not that would be interested in the series as a whole. This is especially true in the case of The Best of He-Man as the ten episodes represented (across two discs) are favorites as voted on by fans.The set breaks down by including the five fan favorites from season 1 on disc 1 and the five best from season 2 on disc 2. The special features are also broken down similarly whereby each disc contains a feature commentary specific to the five episodes included within. These features include commentary by the show's creative staff (writers, directors, artists, animators, and producers).As far as the content itself is concerned, the 10 episodes included on this set bounce around from some of the very earliest productions and come close to skimming the outer reaches of the second (and final) season.Included are the following episodes from Season 1:Evil SeedPrince Adam No MoreDiamond Ray of DisappearanceTeela's QuestSeason 2:Into the AbyssTeela's TriumphTo Save SkeletorThe Problem With PowerOrigin of the SorceressAs has become tradition with all of BCI's impressive He-Man and the Masters of the Universe DVD releases (including She-Ra), this collection began the tradition of including a pair of 4x6"" art cards, this time by artists Bruce Timm and Adam Hughes.Many question the value of owning this collection, especially if they own the complete series box sets but BCI wisely spices this set with some documentary bits unavailable elsewhere and the pair of unique art cards. Most importantly, however, is that The Best of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe typically retails for around $15 and does a wonderful job of summarizing the 130 episodes of the series for potential fans.",4,The Set That Started It All,1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,2313,"['Believe', 'not', 'Best', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'was', 'DVD', 'release', 'BCI', 'started', ""n't"", 'been', 'said', 'officially', 'certainly', 'positive', 'reaction', 'fans', 'series', 'led', 'BCI', 'continued', 'dedication', 'bringing', 'single', 'episode', 'classic', 'Filmation', 'epic', 'DVD', 'release.As', 'said', 'review', 'best', 'She-Ra', 'also', 'BCI', '10-best', 'sets', 'are', 'great', 'idea', 'many', 'reasons', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'typically', 'much', 'more', 'affordable', 'buying', 'entire', 'series', 'box', 'sets', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'way', 'potential', 'fan', 'discover', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'series', 'whole', 'especially', 'true', 'case', 'Best', 'He-Man', 'ten', 'represented', 'two', 'discs', 'are', 'voted', 'fans.The', 'set', 'breaks', 'down', 'including', 'five', 'fan', 'favorites', 'season', '1', 'disc', '1', 'five', 'best', 'season', '2', 'disc', '2', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'broken', 'down', 'similarly', 'whereby', 'disc', 'feature', 'commentary', 'specific', 'five', 'episodes', 'included', 'features', 'include', 'commentary', 'show', 'creative', 'staff', 'writers', 'directors', 'artists', 'animators', 'producers', '.As', 'far', 'content', 'concerned', '10', 'episodes', 'included', 'set', 'bounce', 'very', 'earliest', 'productions', 'come', 'close', 'skimming', 'outer', 'second', 'final', 'season.Included', 'are', 'following', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'Evil', 'SeedPrince', 'Adam', 'No', 'MoreDiamond', 'Ray', 'DisappearanceTeela', 'QuestSeason', '2', 'AbyssTeela', 'TriumphTo', 'Save', 'SkeletorThe', 'Problem', 'PowerOrigin', 'SorceressAs', 'become', 'tradition', 'BCI', 'impressive', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'DVD', 'releases', 'including', 'She-Ra', 'collection', 'began', 'tradition', 'including', 'pair', '4x6', 'art', 'cards', 'time', 'artists', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'Adam', 'Hughes.Many', 'question', 'value', 'owning', 'collection', 'especially', 'own', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'sets', 'BCI', 'wisely', 'set', 'documentary', 'bits', 'unavailable', 'elsewhere', 'pair', 'unique', 'art', 'cards', 'Most', 'importantly', 'however', 'Best', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'typically', '15', 'wonderful', 'job', 'summarizing', '130', 'episodes', 'series', 'potential', 'fans']",N/A

First off the DVD is extremely well done, the menus and and packaging are TOP NOTCH. The actual transfer of the episodes are PRISTINE. I have a new 42"" Sony HDTV and it looks beautiful on there.

This in my opinion is the one to buy. The quality is outstanding, maybe better than when originally aired. The episode pics are great, especially ""The problem with Power."" I can only rate this a 5, but would rather rate it a 10. If you've been looking for 80's cartoons, especially He Man, this one is definately worth the money. It comes in a two disc set, with wonderful artwork on all the covers. I don't know how else to say it. If you like He Man, buy this set.

905555,A2MQLYAQKKRXEA,B0009HBPHQ,Reviewer,"[4, 7]","This is by far superb as quality can come for He-man.  This is only the beginning for the series.  The entire 130 episodes will be released in boxed sets starting October 18, 2005.  There will be four boxed sets.  Season 1 will be split into two parts because of the numerous amount of episodes in that season.  Seasons 2 and 3 will be released as a single boxed set each.  Why buy this collector's edition?  It's packed with extras, two collectible cards, and has a nice folder out photo where the discs are stored.  It has exclusive content that WILL NOT be on the other boxed sets that come out in the future.  The quality puts the older VHS releases of He-man to shame since this is a digitally remastered set.  The sound is in 2.0 stereo, which is the way it was originally recorded back in 1983 when the series first came out.  This is a really nice start for the first time release of He-man and I look forward to seeing more in the future.

His parents are King Randor and Queen Marlena, his friend Teela is the captain of the Royal Guard, and apparently also the daughter of the Sorceress. Some other people in their world consider Adam and Cringer goofy, but when trouble strikes---watch out because they are going to really make a difference.Adam raises his sword and says 'by the power of grayskull' transforming into He-man. Then he becomes this kid-friendly barbarian-hero character and Cringer is transformed into the fierce Battle Cat. As He-man, Adam battles the horrors of Skeletor and company, but he struggles with people's expectations of him for being Adam. This subplot really made the series more than 'just a kids show'.Only the Sorceress of Grayskull, Orko, and Duncan (Aka Man-at-arms/Teela's adoptive dad) know Price Adam's secret.Like so many other children of the 1980's, I grew up watching this 1983-1985 cartoon which was then produced by Filmation. Extras in this DVD release package include a LARGE and very well done interview. I am honestly neutral about the cards by today's design artists being included in the DVD set.The important thing is getting this classic series out onto DVD and then keeping the season releases up.
