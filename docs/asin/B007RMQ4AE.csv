1537126,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B007RMQ4AE,D.P.,"[2, 2]","vs. Christian - Before the match, we saw Ryder interrupt a confrontation between Christian & Tommy Dreamer setting up this non-title match. Christian was in control early & more aggressive than usual from the start with moves like his impactful running clothesline in the corner before Ryder was able to gain some momentum reversing Christian's own momentum. This went back & forth before Ryder was able to work on Christian's midsection with stretches, body scissors, bearhugs, and even a superplex before dropping Christian stomach first on the ring ropes. This was one of those matches that turned out better than you would have expected from the start as even the announcers pointed that out that nobody expected it to be this competitive.""ECW On Syfy"" July '09w/Hugh Jackman vs. Dolph Ziggler - In a nutshell, this was the match to start Ryder's chase for the U.S. Title & make a ""media clip"" moment with Hugh Jackman's involvement but past that, the match was around 4 minutes & too short for the match itself to be anything noteworthy.""RAW"" Sept. '11[Best Of RAW & SmackDown '11]w/John Cena vs. Awesome Truth - This took place during WWE's tour of England with the crowd being heavily biased towards Ryder & against his partner Cena. Cena & Ryder were in control during the first half with both having fun doing the Broski boot while there was one moment where Truth was sent over the top rope with his head bouncing off the mat on the floor before Miz & Truth took control by singling one member out at a time while using tactics such as distracting the referee & double teaming while Miz continued to keep taunting Cena whenever he was working over Ryder. This was a nice match with the only thing negative I can really say was the ending coming out of nowhere to the point where even the announcers were lost on what happened for a moment while the expression on Cena's face didn't help.""RAW"" Nov. '11vs. John Cena - With both men wanting a title match (Ryder for the U.S. & Cena for the WWE Championship), the General Manager setup this match with the winner getting their title shot at the next PPV. This match wasn't very long but a great offensive showcase for Ryder in the short time they had as he was dominate for a majority of this match by grounding Cena early in the match with a side headlock before executing other offensive maneuvers such as the tornado DDT & even landing the Broski boot before he was eventually caught by Cena. This was a stereotypical Cena performance but a good showcase for Ryder.""RAW"" Dec. '11w/Randy Orton vs. Dolph Ziggler & Wade Barrett - This tag match came together as both of these men had matches against each other coming up at the T.L.C. PPV that Sunday. This was just your average tag match that told the story of Barrett continuing to play mind games with Orton as he avoided him throughout the match but only came in when he knew Orton was at a disadvantage while both Barrett & Dolph continued to trying to keep an advantage with double teaming & working behind the referee's back.""SmackDown"" Dec. '11vs. United States Champion Dolph Ziggler - After weeks of campaigning (including a Twitter petition) & John Cena giving up his spot on the PPV, Ryder got another opportunity at the U.S. title with the crowd heavily behind him right from the start. The action went back & forth early with Dolph eventually gaining the advantage with a DDT on the apron followed by repeatedly dropping elbows while showing off to the crowd doing such things as push ups in the middle of the match. Ryder was able to make a comeback with moves like a missile dropkick as both men were making close near falls before Vickie tried to get involved to save Dolph only for that to end up backfiring on her. This was a real good opening match that had the right result & a nice feel good moment afterwords with the champion celebrating with his father in the crowd.T.L.C. '11This set is being put out on him to capitalize on the popularity he's gained for close to the past year thanks to his internet show but enough big moments in his career (his six man tag with World Champions Daniel Bryan & C.M. Punk the night after T.L.C. or him retiring Tommy Dreamer from WWE) weren't picked here in favor of unimportant forgetful filler matches to really justify a release so this is a good set for hardcore Ryder fans but past that, I would skip this.",3,WOO WOO WOO?
