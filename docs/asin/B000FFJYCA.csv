988962,A2MW4K4T7P35D1,B000FFJYCA,Another reviewer,"[2, 2]","Okay, I'll be right up front and admit that I am not a fan of anime.  To my backward way of thinking, peddling sex to kiddos is just not cool, and most anime does just that, with a few exceptions (think Kiki's Delivery Service and other such films - in my opinion, they are few and far between). This show doesn't do that - not even in an insidious way - nor does it pit friends against friends (think Pokemon). Perhaps it's because it's not strictly anime.  The humor is terrific. It's a show I can watch again and again with my kids.  Now that's saying something, anime or not.",5,"Not an anime fan, but I love this show!",1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,579,"['Okay', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'front', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'anime', 'backward', 'way', 'thinking', 'peddling', 'sex', 'kiddos', 'just', 'not', 'cool', 'most', 'anime', 'just', 'few', 'exceptions', 'think', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'other', 'such', 'films', 'opinion', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'show', ""n't"", 'do', 'not', 'even', 'insidious', 'way', 'pit', 'friends', 'friends', 'think', 'Pokemon', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'strictly', 'anime', 'humor', 'terrific', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'kids', 'Now', 'saying', 'something', 'anime', 'not']",Xiaolin Showdown - Season One

It was on sale for less than the cost of the rental.- The film is colorful but it's not funny. It's also boring. I'm sure that's why it lasted only two seasons. Furthermore, Warner Bros never released season 2 on DVD.- I don't know if it's more suitable to kids.- I gave my copy to a charity organization.",1,"NOT FUNNY + BORING = That's why it lasted only 2 seasons.

It was a show that impressed me within the first few episodes, and really stood out against the other shows that aired with it. The characters are funny, the plot engaging, the animation smooth, and some of the dialogue was tops. It ended with a season finale that had me on the edge of my seat. I must admit, Wuya is a pretty awesome villain, and Jack Spicer was also a great villain, cute in a dorky way and just outright funny.

988968,A2V0OJY5BIDNZC,B000FFJYCA,"Tim Coogan ""CN fan""","[3, 3]","""Xiaolin Showdown"" is an interesting breakthrough series.  Basically it's about four young monks travelling the globe for mystical artifacts called the Shen Gong Wu.  However, they must face a whole lotta bad guys in order to get the Wu, even if it results in an amazing duel known as the Xiaolin Showdown.Here's the who's who on the show:Omi - A young dragon-in-training who is confident in his training at the Xiaolin temple.  Unfortunately, he can't keep up with the times.Raimundo - A hip Brazillian boy who usually plays it cool, although his attitude sometimes interferes with his teammates.Clay - A down-home fella from Texas who is usually calm and steady in his training.Kimiko - A Japanese girl who never wears the same outfit twice in each episode.  She's very high-tech and fashionable, though she's never taken too seriously.Master Fung - The mentor of Omi and the others with lots of philosophy to boot.Dojo - A witty, yet stubborn dragon who can grow gigantic in size for transporting the young monks.Jack Spicer - A sinister boy genius with a love of robotics.  To me, he's really a wimp.Wuya - The spirit of the Heylin witch who seeks revenge and get as much Shen Gong Wu as she can.So join our young heroes in thirteen action and laugh packed episodes spanning their travels and their tribulations.  The two disc set is worth buying for, even if there's not much in special features.  Inevitably, this series is very nice if you like shows like ""Teen Titans"" or something like that.",4,The Showdown Show,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,1500,"['Xiaolin', 'Showdown', 'interesting', 'breakthrough', 'series', 'Basically', 'four', 'young', 'monks', 'travelling', 'globe', 'mystical', 'artifacts', 'called', 'Shen', 'Gong', 'Wu', 'However', 'must', 'face', 'whole', 'lotta', 'bad', 'guys', 'order', 'get', 'Wu', 'even', 'results', 'amazing', 'duel', 'known', 'Xiaolin', 'Showdown.Here', 'who', 'who', 'show', 'Omi', 'young', 'dragon-in-training', 'who', 'confident', 'training', 'Xiaolin', 'temple', 'Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'times.Raimundo', 'hip', 'Brazillian', 'boy', 'who', 'usually', 'cool', 'attitude', 'sometimes', 'teammates.Clay', 'down-home', 'fella', 'Texas', 'who', 'usually', 'calm', 'steady', 'training.Kimiko', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'who', 'never', 'same', 'outfit', 'twice', 'episode', 'very', 'high-tech', 'fashionable', 'never', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously.Master', 'Fung', 'mentor', 'Omi', 'others', 'lots', 'philosophy', 'boot.Dojo', 'witty', 'yet', 'stubborn', 'dragon', 'who', 'can', 'grow', 'gigantic', 'size', 'transporting', 'young', 'monks.Jack', 'Spicer', 'sinister', 'boy', 'genius', 'love', 'robotics', 'really', 'wimp.Wuya', 'spirit', 'Heylin', 'witch', 'who', 'revenge', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'Shen', 'Gong', 'Wu', 'join', 'young', 'heroes', 'thirteen', 'action', 'laugh', 'packed', 'episodes', 'spanning', 'travels', 'tribulations', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'worth', 'buying', 'even', 'not', 'much', 'special', 'features', 'Inevitably', 'series', 'very', 'nice', 'like', 'shows', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'something']",Xiaolin Showdown - Season One
