I was one of the many that watched Fireproof first, then to find out that the Sherwood church made two other films, so I backtracked.  I rented Facing the Giants and then came to Flywheel.  Since buying it only a few months ago, I've watched it over and over again.  Jay Austin is the every man.  He is dishonest in his business( a used car lot) and even over charges the minister at his church.  Even though going to church seems like a chore more than anything else.  He has a wife, Judy, and a son, Tod.  Judy knows that Jay can do better and Tod doesn't want to grow up to be like his dad.  But in a moment of self realization he gives his life to God.  God can do amazing things in your life if you let him.  The first half of the film is the set up for the second half.  Shot on a small budget, it still made big changes in my faith.",5,Flywheel soars,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,930,"['are', 'looking', 'good', 'movie', 'buy', 'even', 'rent', 'movie', 'consider', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'watched', 'Fireproof', 'first', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'Sherwood', 'church', 'made', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'backtracked', 'rented', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'then', 'came', 'Flywheel', 'buying', 'only', 'few', 'months', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'Jay', 'Austin', 'man', 'dishonest', 'business', 'used', 'car', 'lot', 'even', 'charges', 'minister', 'church', 'Even', 'going', 'church', 'chore', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'wife', 'Judy', 'son', 'Tod', 'Judy', 'Jay', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'Tod', ""n't"", 'want', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'dad', 'moment', 'self', 'realization', 'life', 'God', 'God', 'can', 'do', 'amazing', 'things', 'life', 'let', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'set', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'Shot', 'small', 'budget', 'still', 'made', 'big', 'changes', 'faith']",N/A

One was the Biblical admonition to step out in faith and the second was the Biblical verse that the Lord works all things for good to those who love him.Unlike so many low budget religious theme movies, this movie is actually well made. And here in 2008 when so many people are dealing with losing homes, jobs, higher fuel and food prices, its a great movie to remind those who profess a faith in the Lord, to be reminded that he wont let us down.  That he will make sure that our enemies are shown to be who they really are.Like the Bible verse about no weapon formed against us can prosper.  Its an honest, storyline about admitting we are wrong and asking the Lord to be #1 in our lives. Easier said than done, sometimes, when one fears that things will only get worse.And I loved the strong family, ethical, moral theme.

He turns his business over to God, and says that since it belongs to Him, He's now responsible for how his new honest approach turns out.Radical move.  And of course it works out for him.  It's a sweet story with some hilarious moments, and it becomes that rare low-budget movie that works in spite of its limitations.

Some days I just want to give up, because it is so hard to touch this boy's heart and help him see WHY anyone would want to submit every area of his life to a God who took his Dad away. He wonders why he should allow someone else to boss him around because it would make him feel like a slave.I picked this movie based on the reviews here. I have turned off our cable TV service, and I've been feeding his mind with good movies about God and about men in history who have led exemplary lives. It is so easy to grade ourselves on a curve, based on the lukewarm integrity and devotion to God of most of the people around us. I want my son to see what a truly sold-out-for-God man looks like. How he lives his daily life and makes the hard choices. How his actions are honorable even when no one is looking at him. And most of all...WHY a man would choose this life of servanthood to God.I loved this movie. I laughed my fanny off. My favorite part was when one of his older customers gave him an attitude adjustment for cheating her, lol. I cried through the entire movie. It was so touching. I also made compromises that I thought I could live with when I was a younger Believer. And I, too was wrong about that and had to face the humiliation, confess publicly, and make things right. Nothing in my life has ever been harder to do.I was absolutely shocked when my son gave this movie a 10. Maybe something he saw will stick in his mind and lead him to Jesus for life.

Rivera ""coming judgement""","[245, 251]","After seeing ""Facing the Giants,"" then going to the theater to see ""Fireproof,"" and subsequently also buying that DVD; I had to also see the initial effort by the Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia.The intent of this movie was to be a ministry outreach to their community, and the goal was to show it in a local theater for one night. It ended up being shown for weeks, being shown elsewhere, and then released on DVD. Its success led to the production of the two later projects.If you are going to judge it alongside Hollywood productions- yes, the quality is not on the same level; yes, the writing is not on the same level; yes, the acting is not on the same level; and yes, the production values are not on the same level. But, it's still not bad- especially for a first-time effort by a group of amateurs. And believe me, I've seen plenty of larger-budget movies by Hollywood professionals that were much worse.You have to realize, that although the intent of this movie is to entertain; the heart of it is to minister. At the time when Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" was released and became a blockbuster, and more religious-themed movies began being to be produced, it was said that the movie theater was becoming the new church. Let's face it, the past efforts of Christian movies, produced by Christians, have left a lot to be desired. But with ""Flywheel"" the bar was raised.As a Christian, knowing that this is a message movie, I watched it with ""spiritual"" eyes, so I was able to overlook its inadequacies. There is such an anointing on this movie, and it is very apparent that the Sherwood Baptist Church is yearning to bring glory to God, and to lift up Christ.Even so, I don't believe it will turn-off non-Christians, because it isn't preachy. The Godly values that the movie portrays is really just a demonstration of ethical living and doing the right thing. The movie is a witnessing tool, because it shows that you can preach a better message with your life, and not just your lips. In other words, actions speak louder than words.The goal for any Christian is to live a Godly life, and although many times we fall short, God's grace is sufficient. It's not about religion- it's about relationship. The movie shows what happen when we reach out to our Heavenly Father and are sensitive to what's in His heart. It's not about us. This movie shows what happen when we put aside what we want in order to do what God wants.We sing for God to Bless America, but why would He, if we're not willing to bless God in word and deed. The Sherwood Baptist Church is doing that with ""Flywheel"" and continue to do so with ""Facing the Giants"" and ""Fireproof."" If you're a Christian and you haven't seen all of these movies- you need to. Not only for the simple fact that they will bless you- but also to support this ministry. If you're not a Christian- these movies offer a practical demonstration of how God wants to work in our lives and our hearts, and how He wants to interact with us in a very real way.",3,The Establishment of a Ministry,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,3026,"['seeing', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'then', 'going', 'theater', 'see', 'Fireproof', 'subsequently', 'also', 'buying', 'DVD', 'had', 'also', 'see', 'initial', 'effort', 'Sherwood', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'Albany', 'Georgia.The', 'intent', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'ministry', 'outreach', 'community', 'goal', 'was', 'show', 'local', 'theater', 'one', 'night', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'shown', 'weeks', 'being', 'shown', 'elsewhere', 'then', 'released', 'DVD', 'success', 'led', 'production', 'two', 'later', 'are', 'going', 'judge', 'alongside', 'Hollywood', 'productions-', 'yes', 'quality', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'yes', 'writing', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'yes', 'acting', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'yes', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'still', 'not', 'bad-', 'especially', 'first-time', 'effort', 'group', 'amateurs', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'larger-budget', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'professionals', 'were', 'much', 'worse.You', 'have', 'realize', 'intent', 'movie', 'entertain', 'heart', 'minister', 'time', 'when', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'was', 'released', 'became', 'blockbuster', 'more', 'religious-themed', 'movies', 'began', 'being', 'be', 'produced', 'was', 'said', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'becoming', 'new', 'church', 'Let', 'face', 'past', 'efforts', 'Christian', 'movies', 'produced', 'Christians', 'have', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Flywheel', 'bar', 'was', 'raised.As', 'Christian', 'knowing', 'message', 'movie', 'watched', 'spiritual', 'eyes', 'was', 'able', 'overlook', 'inadequacies', 'such', 'anointing', 'movie', 'very', 'apparent', 'Sherwood', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'yearning', 'bring', 'glory', 'God', 'lift', 'up', 'Christ.Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'will', 'turn-off', 'non-Christians', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'Godly', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'demonstration', 'ethical', 'living', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'movie', 'witnessing', 'tool', 'can', 'preach', 'better', 'message', 'life', 'not', 'just', 'lips', 'other', 'words', 'actions', 'speak', 'louder', 'words.The', 'goal', 'Christian', 'live', 'Godly', 'life', 'many', 'times', 'fall', 'short', 'God', 'grace', 'sufficient', 'not', 'religion-', 'relationship', 'movie', 'what', 'happen', 'when', 'reach', 'out', 'Heavenly', 'Father', 'are', 'sensitive', 'what', 'heart', 'not', 'movie', 'what', 'happen', 'when', 'put', 'aside', 'what', 'want', 'order', 'do', 'what', 'God', 'sing', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'why', 'would', ""'re"", 'not', 'willing', 'bless', 'God', 'word', 'deed', 'Sherwood', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'doing', 'Flywheel', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'Fireproof', ""'re"", 'Christian', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movies-', 'need', 'Not', 'only', 'simple', 'fact', 'will', 'bless', 'you-', 'also', 'support', 'ministry', ""'re"", 'not', 'Christian-', 'movies', 'offer', 'practical', 'demonstration', 'how', 'God', 'work', 'lives', 'hearts', 'how', 'interact', 'very', 'real', 'way']",N/A

And the story has to be one of the better ones I've seen on screen. Just when it seems everything is miraculously (ar ar) settled, a new complication arises - which makes it all the more realistic, no easy answers or easy believism promoted here!

899536,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B0009231SC,GratedTopping,"[1, 1]","This was the first film created by the Sherwood Baptist church in Albany, GA. Recent movies released in theatres were ""Fireproof"" and ""Facing the Giants"".This is about the director's cut, but I also have the full-length version. Looking at both, there's only about 5-6 minutes that were trimmed. Some missing bits are:- when Jay's flipping through the TV, a few of the channels he passed-by are not there- when Jay's wife asks if it's okay if they just have fruit for dinner- the church service had more scenes of praise from the congregationThese + others that I didn't mention (and maybe didn't notice) were nothing major and didn't take away any important story parts.My full-length copy is on two DVDs, with one containing the extras. All the extras that were on that are here. The new extras on this single-DVD include a commentary, subtitles, an 8-part Bible study with clips from the movie, and a few additional outtakes.The commentary was informative and fun. Most everyone working on the project knew of one another and it was interesting hearing about them; the locations used; etc. I learned:- they actually lost 30 minutes of the final edit a week or so before the film was to premiere and it had to do it all over again; it was completed about 4 hours before the premiere time and that was rough for 'em- the baby you see at the end of the movie is the actual baby that was in the lead actress who was pregnant at the start of the film- when Jay slammed his hand on the kitchen table and yelled at his wife while they were eating, the reaction from the wife is taken from when her actual husband yelled the lines to her- it was made under $20,000; about $15,000 was donated from various members of the church- the frozen pizza that was served one night at dinner was to represent the lack of creativity in the lives of the married couple (something silly said lightheartedly by the two commentators having a laugh)This DVD has improved sound quality and color correction, as stated on the package, and that is true. I could hear the dialogue much easier. All in all, this is the one you'd want to have for the most features.*****I wanted to say something about comments from one of the 1-star reviewers.Part of it contained: ""This is a story of how a wicked man somehow has a miraculous change of heart, but we are never shown how, except for some prayer and religious TV watching. Here the message is unclear.""What? When Jay heard his son telling a friend that he didn't wanna be like his dad; when Jay's recent victim, a Reverend, just bought a car and prayed that the Lord would ""treat him just as he treated me today"" & Jay opened his eyes while feeling uncomfortable; when one of the other car dealers told him ""You taught me how!"" on how to do what it takes to sell the used car; and when he happened to flip to the station that, right at that moment, was talking about how 'your marriage is in the state it is because of choices you've made'.All throughout various events, these were moments that were surely getting to Jay. Change in attitude can happen; people can decide...and Jay wanted better, especially with his family. He was selfish and not in tune with others...he realized it more...and desired to work on himself. It wasn't miraculous (like it was just instantaneous); it was a process.Another part: ""This movie is the one of the most wicked I have ever seen. It is poison dressed as medicine. It is a lie dressed as truth. In this movie Christ is the missing flywheel that will make your life work. This is a lie. Christ is God Almighty; He made and maintains the universe and everything in it. He is King and Lord. He sits on the throne in Glory and disposes of all as He pleases. Christ is to be worshiped and obeyed. He is not a tool in our hands; we are objects He uses for His Glory (in heaven or in hell, see Roman 9).""Geez...it's a parable. The flywheel represents Jay's heart/manner. Easy. Of course Jesus is God and not a literal tool. ""Without your flywheel, you're not going anywhere."" the mechanic said to Jay. Without Christ, you're not going to be moving forward either. I could easily picture Jesus using a comparison such as this.*****OTHER THOUGHTS:- The car Jay gets at the beginning is not working and needs a new flywheel. After Jay gets right with God, the mechanic finds the flywheel the car needed. He said that he got it from someone for nothing and all he needed ""was to ask""...and that's what we are to do: ask God- When Jay gives the title of the car to the woman who wants to return a vehicle since she can't pay the rest, Jay says it's ""paid in full"" -- which is, of course, what Christ did for us. His death and resurrection allowed mankind to be able to come to God and get spiritually back on track; Jesus' laying down his life for us allowed our sin-debt to be paid in full.*****Lastly, I wanted to mention that in 2005 I visited a mental-health adult day-program where clients learn social skills and whatever else they might need. I was pleased that there was a ""spirituality"" group. I was permitted to show ""Flywheel"" to those who wanted to be in this particular group. I remember certain clients getting very emotional -- including the pregnant caseworker -- and that it had a positive effect on them that day. There was laughter, tears, and it was a special moment. I'm thankful that I had the opportunity to do this and I give glory to God.",5,"humourous, serious, and enjoyable all in one package",1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,5412,"['was', 'first', 'film',

Acting, mostly pretty good; no need to single out those who didn't quite carry their load, but these are clearly not professionals. Script, surprisingly good. I was impressed by the clever and thoughtful approach to many sub-themes. And I laughed aloud many times.I am fully aware that this was made to be shown locally and remain a tiny adventure. And also aware that they tackled my question better in their later films. But though Jay's life really was spinning out of control, the decision to toss it all on the Lord just seemed too abrupt. I know people do make sudden transformations. However, as one who did not (I took longer than anyone I know.....glad I was given enough time to complete it!) I found the discarding of cynicism and callousness that were part and parcel of who Jay rather unlikely. I would think a guy like Jay would look to carrying a load of dope before he got on his knees.However, these guys are good storytellers. The flywheel metaphor is brilliant. Unseen, almost unnoticed, yet when out of whack nothing works properly. (As was the metaphor of fireproofing a marriage....good stuff.)Yet what makes this film really glow in my mind is its connection to ""It's A Wonderful Life."" Except that they would call it, ""It Can Be A Wonderful Life."" Once Jay commits, his life becomes better, not perfect (which is why it loses another half star; everything just does not go 180 degrees like this) but far better. And will be better EVEN IF THE THINGS ARE GOING BADLY. If I could write to the producers, I'd ask them to give us a tale with a bit more Job-like content. Those who believe do not always come out on top. The Christianity haters often seem to be doing great. But as the characters in this tale show us, life can indeed improve if you choose to align your life with the truth. Trust and obey, as the hymn says.So, not a Hollywood production, but I am honest when I say this is a legitimate 4 star film.",4,A five star system really fails on this one,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,2060,"['are', 'too', 'many', 'scales', 'evaluate', 'Production', 'vales', 'were', 'fine', 'nothing', 'detracted', 'tale', 'being', 'told', 'Acting', 'mostly', 'pretty', 'good', 'need', 'single', 'out', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'carry', 'load', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'professionals', 'Script', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'was', 'impressed', 'clever', 'thoughtful', 'approach', 'many', 'sub-themes', 'laughed', 'aloud', 'many', 'times.I', 'am', 'fully', 'aware', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'shown', 'locally', 'remain', 'tiny', 'adventure', 'also', 'aware', 'tackled', 'question', 'better', 'later', 'films', 'Jay', 'life', 'really', 'was', 'spinning', 'control', 'decision', 'toss', 'Lord', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'abrupt', 'know', 'people', 'do', 'make', 'sudden', 'transformations', 'However', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'took', 'longer', 'anyone', 'know', '..glad', 'was', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'complete', 'found', 'discarding', 'cynicism', 'callousness', 'were', 'part', 'parcel', 'who', 'Jay', 'rather', 'unlikely', 'would', 'think', 'guy', 'Jay', 'would', 'look', 'carrying', 'load', 'dope', 'got', 'knees.However', 'guys', 'are', 'good', 'storytellers', 'flywheel', 'metaphor', 'brilliant', 'Unseen', 'almost', 'unnoticed', 'yet', 'when', 'whack', 'nothing', 'properly', 'was', 'metaphor', 'fireproofing', 'marriage', '.good', 'stuff', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'glow', 'mind', 'connection', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'would', 'call', 'Can', 'Be', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Once', 'Jay', 'commits', 'life', 'better', 'not', 'perfect', 'why', 'half', 'star', 'everything', 'just', 'not', 'go', '180', 'degrees', 'far', 'better', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'EVEN', 'THINGS', 'ARE', 'GOING', 'BADLY', 'could', 'write', 'producers', ""'d"", 'ask', 'give', 'tale', 'bit', 'more', 'Job-like', 'content', 'who', 'believe', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'Christianity', 'haters', 'often', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'great', 'characters', 'tale', 'show', 'life', 'can', 'indeed', 'improve', 'choose', 'align', 'life', 'truth', 'Trust', 'obey', 'hymn', 'says.So', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'am', 'honest', 'when', 'say', 'legitimate', '4', 'star', 'film']",N/A

Sure, they're all unprofessional unpaid amateurs, but they did a great job and got the message across.  There's not a lot of expensive sets or special effects in this movie- but the story is the most driving thing.Jay Austin is a used car dealer who fits every stereotype of sleazy used car salesmen out there.  He's an unscruplous dealer who cheats and rips off his customers- and teaches his employees to squeeze all the money they can out of each sale.  He has problems with his marriage because his wife disapproves of his dishonesty and his son doesn't want to be like him.  He also finds that he has to get enough money together to pay his mortgage quickly, as he's fallen behind on that.He goes to church with his wife after she nags him into it, but even there he puts in an empty envelope in the offering plate so others can think he gives a tithe.  The minister there decides to get a car from his for his daughter, and Jay rips him off too- though the minister thinks he's gotten a great deal.  When he prays for him and asks God to treat Jay just the way he's treated him, then we can start to see some things happening in Jay's life.When he finally gets to the point of realizing that He truly needs Jesus in his life and makes Him Lord- Jesus changes Jay completely and makes him into a honest man who sells his cars at honest and fair rates.  He's dedicated his car lot to the Lord and tries to honor God with it.And there's a lot more that happens because of that as we see how Jesus truly changes Jay's life and restores what was once broken.I definitely enjoyed this movie just as much as ""Facing the Giants"" and I would recommend it heartily.  There is a clear salvation message in this movie- and that's simply that Jesus loves everyone so much that He died for us and rose again- and all it takes to get to Heaven is to pray and make Him Lord and let Him make you into a new creature (2 Corinthians 5:17)  ""Flywheel"" presents a challenge to Christians to truly let Jesus be Lord over your whole life- including school, work, play, or wherever you find yourself.  And it presents a challenge to non-believers to really consider who Jesus is to them and where they stand with Him.Overall, it's a great movie with a clean, fun and funny storyline that has a serious message about the Lordship of Jesus and what He can do in our lives and it's highly recommended.

When his marriage and his strained relationship with his son comes under fire, he realizes that he wasn't involving God in any of his business ventures.Through colorful and intellectual characters like Jay's wife, mechanics and a couple of his prior customers, the Lord uses them to have Jay to make amends not only with life on the homefront, but with his public life at the car dealership.Another part of what made this movie great is the message of God's intervention for our lives.

My faith has been given a serious heart massage! This same experience occurred after viewing ""Facing The Giants"", but not quite as much as this movie. The most likely reason is that I have a son the same age as the main character in the story. The actors, directors and production staff are all members of the same church and the unity of thought and purpose is evident! Praise The Lord! Another small reason (but worth mentioning)I loved the film is that it has a 'real' feel to it: the characters are 'normal' people found in every small town in America. How many movies have a used car salesman as the leading character?

Ths is the best film I have ever seen for showing the fall and restoration of a Christian. As the daughter of a director who had two successful television series, I am somewhat picky on films. This one is so easy to follow and so well written, directed and acted that it is a joy. I was deeply moved by this story so real and so well suited to every true believer in Christ who has backslidden and the wonderful joy of restoration to fellowship with Christ.

Since it's Sherwood Baptist Church's first movie, and they were working with amateur cast and crew, I can forgive the camcorder type feel it has.  Aside from the lack of technical proficiency (which improved greatly during Facing the Giants), it's a fairly decent movie.  It felt a bit preachy (FTG was a lot preachier than this one), but I did like the fact that the main character's transformation seemed authentic.  In addition, although I'm not for the ""gospel of prosperity,"" it is refreshing to see a movie that shows that sometimes miracles can happen when one truly commits him/herself to their God.  I also felt refreshed to see a movie without profanity, sexual inuendos (or explicit sex), and so forth.  I would feel comfortable showing this one (and FTG) to people of all ages.  Even though I don't necessarily believe the message both movies try to send (I'm not fundamentalist, but am more moderate in my theology), I am still relieved to see a movie that sends a positive message.

899627,AQ5V6PW8TJJMP,B0009231SC,WithGODallthingsarepossible,"[0, 0]","This movie has a great message.  However, you must keep in mind that it was the first movie that Sherwood made-it was on a very low budget and all of the actors were amateur volunteers.  If you are critical towards movie quality/filming, then this movie isn't for you.  If you can see past the ""low-budgetness"" and look at the moral of the story-then watch this movie.  I would recommend watching all 4 of Sherwood's movies, they get better & better each time.  Starting with the next movie, Facing the Giants, the quality goes up drastically.  In fact it appears to me to be just as high of quality of normal Hollywood films.  Your time will not be wasted watching all 4 of these movies-and it helps to support a ministry instead of a sick/twisted Hollywood.",4,Great message,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,759,"['movie', 'great', 'message', 'However', 'must', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Sherwood', 'made-it', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'actors', 'were', 'amateur', 'volunteers', 'are', 'critical', 'towards', 'movie', 'quality/filming', 'then', 'movie', ""n't"", 'can', 'see', 'low-budgetness', 'look', 'moral', 'story-then', 'watch', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', '4', 'Sherwood', 'movies', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'time', 'Starting', 'next', 'movie', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'quality', 'up', 'drastically', 'fact', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'normal', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'time', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'wasted', 'watching', '4', 'movies-and', 'support', 'ministry', 'instead', 'sick/twisted', 'Hollywood']",N/A
