But when some of the episodes were on HBO I started to watch. And I started to laugh. The show was very funny. Whether it was the bubbly and eager additude of Andy (Gervais) or the bumbling wit of Maggie (Ugly Betty's Ashley Jensen). As for the DVD itself, the packaging persists of nice artwork in an accessible style. Inside of the package is seasons (or series) one and two and the ""Extra Special"" series finale. Each season contains 6 episodes. Each season features those six episodes on two discs. The quality of the picture is outstanding.

These seasons are amazingly short, like 6 half-hour programs per season for the first two and I haven't seen the finale yet.  The box set is the most sensible option price-wise and if you liked The Office then you will enjoy Extras as well.  Perhaps the characters in The Office were somewhat less annoying than in Extras though.  In Extras it's a toss-up as to who's most annoying - his agent (Stephan Merchant) or Maggie (Ashley Jensen).  The agent is overly idiotic, to the point where it almost seems slapstick - although Merchant seems like a pretty nice guy as himself in interviews.  Maggie is foot-in-mouth ten times over also, and will compete with the agent for getting on your nerves.  Andy Millman (Gervaise) is the silent (or not-so-silent) sufferer of these two fools.  Fortunately the whole program doesn't just revolve around these two (or you'd die of exasperation) and some of the comedy that suddenly evolves out of the typical Gervais-esque 'awkward moments' can be side-splitting.  This is a very entertaining show that is easy to watch.  The fact that it includes famous guest stars is interesting though by no means the only highlight - performances that I found especially funny would have been Kate Winslett and David Bowie.  I will say that the program leaves you feeling that everyone is cheap, shallow, two-faced, petty, corrupt, jaded and stupid.

1119939,AN9J46667D80O,B000YI99IW,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[5, 5]","Ah, the Brits. No one else can produce so many successful shows with such unlikable main characters. ConsiderThe Office - The Complete Collection BBC Edition (First And Second Series Plus Special)andBlack Adder: The Complete Collector's Set. Neither David Brent nor any of the various Blackadders (with the possible exception of Captain Blackadder), were especially likable, but the shows built around them were very good and very popular.Enter Ricky Gervais, formerly David Brent, now Andy Millman, would-be TV star. As a character he's very unlikeable and one of those for whom the word ""cringeworthy"" is coined. He's a character who tries very hard to get ahead, but his own lack of ability and confidence really holds him back.The character is fascinating to watch. He starts out as an extra, or ""background artist"", as he puts it. He wants to be more. He wants to have his own TV show on the BBC, but it's hard to just get speaking lines, and his particular personality traits and skills at self-sabotage only serve to make things worse.Consider, for example, and episode in which our hero is dating a Catholic woman. He's an atheist himself but is lying to her and saying he's a Catholic. This works reasonably well until her priest starts talking to him and he begins what my friend and I call ""The Millman Slide"", as instead of manning-up and taking responsibility for what he's done, he starts lying even more, and more ineffectively (at one point saying his childhood priest was one Father Michael O'Flatley). Soon he's buried himself so deep he knows there's no point in trying anymore and simply leaves the room. At one point he's talking to David Bowie and his insecurities are so obvious to everyone around him that Bowie makes up a song, on the spot, mocking him (""Depressed and all alone / Fatty takes his own life"").Along with Andy we have his incompetent agent, several celebrities playing exaggerated versions of themselves and Andy's friend Maggie, who in many ways is the heart of the series. Watching her develop as a character is one of the great joys of the show, particularly in the Christmas episode.The DVD's have several great extras (or ""bonus material,"" I guess I should call it), including outtakes, behind-the-scenes material and a short film on the efforts of Gervais and his collegue, Stephen Merchant, to get Leonardo DiCaprio onto the series. The only thing that's lacking, actually, is any additional features on the Christmas episode, and that's really too bad. I would've loved an audio commentary.This is an excellent series available on Amazon at an amazing price. You get all twelve episodes plus the Christmas special, and I highly recommend buying it as a set rather than just getting the discs on their own. You'll save money this way.If you have any interest in Hollywood, the movies, television or the entertainment world in general, you owe it to yourself to watch this show!",5,Wonderfuly cringeworthy!,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,2923,"['Ah', 'Brits', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'produce', 'so', 'many', 'successful', 'shows', 'such', 'unlikable', 'main', 'characters', 'ConsiderThe', 'Office', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'BBC', 'Edition', 'First', 'Second', 'Series', 'Plus', 'Special', 'andBlack', 'Adder', 'Complete', 'Collector', 'Set', 'David', 'Brent', 'various', 'Blackadders', 'possible', 'exception', 'Captain', 'Blackadder', 'were', 'especially', 'likable', 'shows', 'built', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'popular.Enter', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'formerly', 'David', 'Brent', 'now', 'Andy', 'Millman', 'would-be', 'TV', 'star', 'character', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'one', 'whom', 'word', 'cringeworthy', 'coined', 'character', 'who', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'ahead', 'own', 'lack', 'ability', 'confidence', 'really', 'back.The', 'character', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'out', 'extra', 'background', 'artist', 'be', 'more', 'have', 'own', 'TV', 'show', 'BBC', 'hard', 'just', 'get', 'speaking', 'lines', 'particular', 'personality', 'traits', 'skills', 'self-sabotage', 'only', 'make', 'things', 'worse.Consider', 'example', 'episode', 'hero', 'dating', 'Catholic', 'woman', 'atheist', 'lying', 'saying', 'Catholic', 'reasonably', 'well', 'priest', 'talking', 'what', 'friend', 'call', 'Millman', 'Slide', 'instead', 'manning-up', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'what', 'done', 'lying', 'even', 'more', 'more', 'ineffectively', 'one', 'point', 'saying', 'childhood', 'priest', 'was', 'one', 'Father', 'Michael', ""O'Flatley"", 'buried', 'so', 'deep', 'point', 'trying', 'anymore', 'simply', 'room', 'one', 'point', 'talking', 'David', 'Bowie', 'insecurities', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'Bowie', 'up', 'song', 'spot', 'mocking', 'Depressed', 'alone', '/', 'Fatty', 'own', 'life', '.Along', 'Andy', 'have', 'incompetent', 'agent', 'several', 'celebrities', 'playing', 'exaggerated', 'versions', 'Andy', 'friend', 'Maggie', 'who', 'many', 'ways', 'heart', 'series', 'Watching', 'develop', 'character', 'one', 'great', 'joys', 'show', 'particularly', 'Christmas', 'episode.The', 'DVD', 'have', 'several', 'great', 'extras', 'bonus', 'material', 'guess', 'should', 'call', 'including', 'outtakes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'material', 'short', 'film', 'efforts', 'Gervais', 'collegue', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'get', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'series', 'only', 'thing', 'lacking', 'actually', 'additional', 'features', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'audio', 'commentary.This', 'excellent', 'series', 'available', 'Amazon', 'amazing', 'price', 'get', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'Christmas', 'special', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'set', 'rather', 'just', 'getting', 'discs', 'own', ""'ll"", 'save', 'money', 'way.If', 'have', 'interest', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'television', 'entertainment', 'world', 'general', 'owe', 'watch', 'show']",Extras: The Complete Series
1119940,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000YI99IW,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[84, 94]","A few years back, Ricky Gervais created ""The Office,"" a Dilberty satire on office work. Now, he's created ""Extras,"" a wickedly funny satire on showbiz and acting, both seasons of which are contained here. And the fact that prominent actors appear in it -- as warped versions of themselves -- is just the icing on the comedy cake.Andy Millman (Gervais) and Maggie Jacobs (Ashley Jenson) are film extras -- Andy is embittered by his lack of success and his inept agent (Stephen Merchant, Gervais' work partner), while well-meaning Maggie merely pursues a series of crew members on the films they work in.The first episode features the two working in a biopic directed by a brusque Ben Stiller (""Would you stop going on about your f**king dead wife?""), and Andy gets himself kicked off the set. Their blunders continue with other stars: Kate Winslet in a nun costume, who teaches Maggie how to talk dirty to her new boyfriend (""I'd love it if you stuck your Willy Wonka in between my Oompa-Loompas!""); Samuel L. Jackson, and Patrick Stewart, who is writing a movie about psychkinesis and naked women.And in the second season, Andy gets his Big Break -- BBC2 is producing his sitcom ""When the Whistle Blows,"" but they dumb it down until it's popular but critically lambasted. Meanwhile, he and Maggie tangle with a bunch of new celebs -- the arrogant woman-chasing Daniel Radcliffe and Orlando Bloom, self-promoting Chris Martin, a hostile David Bowie, and Andy even stars in a play of Ian McKellen's about gay love (much to his discomfort).Finally, the Christmas special takes us forward -- Andy has fame and fortune from his sitcom, and Maggie is still struggling at the lowest rungs. When Andy blows up and destroys his own fame, he is forced to confront the fact that he cannot be both an ""artiste"" and rich'n'famous.... and also who his true friends will always be.It's a bit depressing compared to the past two seasons, especially when Andy has turned into a big stupid sitcom diva. But it is funny in an understated way, and Gervais' televised monologue is an absolute, heartbreaking gem.Part of the genius of ""Extras"" is that it isn't much like any other showbiz parodies -- the lead characters are on the lowest rung of acting, and the big egos are real stars making fun of themselves. Sometimes they play really nasty versions of themselves, such as Winslet saying that she's only making a Holocaust film so she can FINALLY nab an Oscar.The other half of the comic genius is Gervais' direction, with most of the jokes based on socially awkward situations. It's all about cringing and giggling at once, such as when Andy's pals see him pantsless in Ian McKellen's dressing room. Those hideously embarrassing situations -- usually with some hilarious dialogue involving the star guests (Bowie's ""little fat man/nobody's laughing"" song is a gutsplitter) are what it's all about.Gervais underplays a sort of befuddled, cynical extra, but you can really connect with his struggles, even when he gets his own sitcom. No matter what, Andy can always be depended on to jam foot in mouth, and occasionally to attack Warwick Davis. And Jensen is clumsily charming as Maggie, who tries to be nice to everyone but says all the wrong things at the wrong time, when she's not being pursued by Orlando Bloom or offending Samuel Jackson.From start to finish, ""Extras"" is an uproariously funny, barbed looks at the strange world of showbiz, with the self-parodying actors as the final perfect touch.",5,Extra!
