Jeff Daniels feels as unconfortable in the part as his out of luck actor character feels playing a gay Richard III, and Patricia  Heaton its ok but not better than in Everybody loves Raymond. I saw the original movie when I was just a kid in the 70's and  enjoy it, seeing it in  the 2004 version yesterday on tv, not much has changed, only celulars falling down the stairs so the phone booth must be used.

I do know that I did not need to see it again. The story was not difficult to follow and it was a cute story about a woman scorned by failed relationships with earlier roommate (male actors) and she wanted to change her life for the better.The remake of the movie was really funny. The script stayed very much on cue with the Richard Dryfus movie. But,  I really laughed myself to death on this one. The setting and fashion was more up to date. But I felt that Jeff Daniel played a little less intense a personality than Richard Dryfus. Richard Dryfuss played a little too intense a character. He seemed to be rather rude and self centered, whereas Daniels was more human in my opinion. Especially when the play was being performed. When you see his face in the dressing room after his performance on its opening night! I am laughing as I am writing this, I can still see his expression!Perhaps being older has made the difference in my viewpoint, but I am so happy to have this movie in my video collections.

821543,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B000228EYK,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[0, 1]","I enjoyed the plot of Neil Simon's ""The Goodbye Girl."" But one thing about the original 1977 film always bothered me-- and I had a BIG problem with it. My big problem was, and still  is, Marsha Mason, the former Mrs. Neil Simon herself and his frequent creative muse. For some reason I can't clearly define, Marsha Mason ANNOYS the hell out of me and I don't care for her in leading roles. So I much prefer this 2004 TV version with Patricia Heaton  (""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" ""The Middle"") as Paula, a divorced mother of 10 year old Lucy (Hallie Kate Eisenberg),  forced to share an apartment with actor Elliott Garfield (Jeff Daniels) after her callous ex-boyfriend Tony dumps her; draining her bank account and leaving New York City to make an Italian movie.  Ironically, Marsha Mason makes guest appearances  on ""The Middle"" as Patricia Heaton's mother.Those worried about an inferior remake have nothing to fear. Neil Simon has left his original 1977 screenplay intact; making very few, if any,  noticeable changes in his sharp, funny dialogue or the plot. Hey, it wasn't broke, so there is no need for Simon to fix it. ""The Goodbye Girl""  even  had yet another incarnation as a Broadway musical; with Bernadette Peters as Paula and Martin Short as Elliott. That version may have been difficult to take, as I find it impossible to believe any girl would find Short a charming room-mate; or fall in love with him by the last act, for that matter.Richard Dreyfuss won an Academy Award for his performance as Elliott in 1977. Jeff Daniels (""The Purple Rose Of Cairo"", ""101 Dalmations"") retains Dreyfuss' beard, but slips easily and effortlessly into the role of Elliott. Daniels and Heaton share an easy-breezy chemistry, which is crucial, because the plot depends on comic and romantic chemistry between Paula and Elliott. Daniels and Heaton are charming as they banter, bicker, and fall in love; just charming enough to make you forget about Dreyfuss and Mason, or at least be glad you watched this delightful ""revival."" In addition, Alan Cumming (""Cabaret"", ""The Good Wife"") steals scenes as a theatre director from Mars who insists that struggling actor Elliott play Richard as over-the-top gay in a, mercifully, Off-Off Broadway production of Shakespeare's ""Richard III.""",4,"""GOODBYE""...

I had just joined up with a new girlfriend and she wanted to see it so off to the local theater we went. I couldn't remember anything about the movie, but when I saw ""the Goodbye Girl"" on the bargain DVD rack. I immediately bought it. Well, it turned out that this was not the same Goodbye Girl. This was a later one produced as a TV movie. Such is life.""The Goodybye Girl"" is a story of a NYC dancer (Patricia Heaton) who seemed to hook up with NYC actors who leave when they get a better job elsewhere. Well, the latest one moved out and subleased his apartment in which she and her young daughter were living to another actor (Jeff Daniels) who suddenly showed up from Chicago. Naturally, there was a clash of interests with regard to the apartment and the new actor was the legal renter. The matter was uneasily resolved by having him move into his own apartment with her and her daughter occupying a major part of it. Now, proceed through a series of conflicts and episodes and a blooming romance until an eventually happy ending. It's an interesting story and well done. The acting is okay, but not particularly good. The story flows along at a good pace. It's mildly enjoyable watching.

821550,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000228EYK,MollyRK,"[9, 12]","This made-for-TV film is one that I felt instantly inclined to pick up on DVD when I came across it on Amazon, due mostly in part to the recognizable and talented cast. Patricia Heaton appeared in a couple movies and landed some guest spots on television series before her breakthrough on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" but this is one of the few films in which she stars. Many sitcom actors experience some difficulty transitioning to film, but Heaton has an apparent ease on camera and performs this role quite well, despite the fact that it is so different from her gig as Debra on ""Raymond."" In fact, any fan of that show who is familiar with Heaton's tough-as-nails, take-no-crap-from-anybody role may be a bit humored to see her in this movie as a character who is bawling over a guy within the first five minutes, but for her it works just fine. Heaton has a definite knack for humor and sarcasm in her acting, which gives her a nice distinction and gives her onscreen success.""The Goodbye Girl"" is a simple, sweet story of a single mother with a wise-beyond-her-years daughter and a reputation for falling for and being dumped by several actor types. As the sweet but undeniably cliched plot continues, another actor enters her life and shows a definite potential to establish a family with Heaton and her child.There is not a whole lot to the storyline and therefore not much to really comment on in that aspect, but the cast was well chosen and gives the movie a nice touch. Jeff Daniels is a genuinely funny actor with many humorous scenes here, and young child starlet Hallie Kate Eisenberg (remember those infamous Pepsi commercials?) maintains those classic out-of-control curls and river-deep dimples to give a believable portrayal as Patricia Heaton's 10-year-old daughter. Eisenberg has grown quite a bit since doing all those movies as a tiny little girl, but she works very well alongside Heaton and seems to be doing just fine as a preteen star. It is also nice to see Heaton playing such a large part with a child actress. Of course, she played a devoted and loving mother on ""Raymond,"" but in that show we actually don't see her interacting that much with her kids--it is mostly suggestive that she is with them a lot of the time. This movie has her and Eisenberg interacting all the way through, and the fact that they are more like friends than mother and daughter gives them both some good improvisational material to work with.In short, ""The Goodbye Girl"" is a movie worth renting or buying if you like the cast and would enjoy seeing a lighthearted and entertaining family story.",5,a TV movie that you just might really enjoy,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,2602,"['made-for-TV', 'film', 'one', 'felt', 'instantly', 'inclined', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'when', 'came', 'Amazon', 'due', 'mostly', 'part', 'recognizable', 'talented', 'cast', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'appeared', 'couple', 'movies', 'landed', 'guest', 'spots', 'television', 'series', 'breakthrough', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'Many', 'sitcom', 'actors', 'experience', 'difficulty', 'transitioning', 'film', 'Heaton', 'apparent', 'ease', 'camera', 'performs', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'fact', 'so', 'different', 'gig', 'Debra', 'Raymond', 'fact', 'fan', 'show', 'who', 'familiar', 'Heaton', 'tough-as-nails', 'take-no-crap-from-anybody', 'role', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'humored', 'see', 'movie', 'character', 'who', 'bawling', 'guy', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'just', 'fine', 'Heaton', 'definite', 'knack', 'humor', 'sarcasm', 'acting', 'nice', 'distinction', 'onscreen', 'success', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'simple', 'sweet', 'story', 'single', 'mother', 'wise-beyond-her-years', 'daughter', 'reputation', 'falling', 'being', 'dumped', 'several', 'actor', 'types', 'sweet', 'undeniably', 'cliched', 'plot', 'actor', 'life', 'definite', 'potential', 'establish', 'family', 'Heaton', 'child.There', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'storyline', 'therefore', 'not', 'much', 'really', 'comment', 'aspect', 'cast', 'was', 'well', 'chosen', 'movie', 'nice', 'touch', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'actor', 'many', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'here', 'young', 'child', 'starlet', 'Hallie', 'Kate', 'Eisenberg', 'remember', 'infamous', 'Pepsi', 'commercials', 'classic', 'out-of-control', 'curls', 'river-deep', 'dimples', 'give', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', '10-year-old', 'daughter', 'Eisenberg', 'grown', 'quite', 'bit', 'doing', 'movies', 'tiny', 'little', 'girl', 'very', 'well', 'Heaton', 'be', 'doing', 'just', 'fine', 'preteen', 'star', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Heaton', 'playing', 'large', 'part', 'child', 'actress', 'course', 'played', 'devoted', 'loving', 'mother', 'Raymond', 'show', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'interacting', 'much', 'kids', 'mostly', 'suggestive', 'lot', 'time', 'movie', 'Eisenberg', 'interacting', 'way', 'fact', 'are', 'more', 'friends', 'mother', 'daughter', 'good', 'improvisational', 'material', 'work', 'with.In', 'short', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'movie', 'worth', 'renting', 'buying', 'like', 'cast', 'would', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'lighthearted', 'entertaining', 'family', 'story']",Neil Simon's The Goodbye Girl

I like Daniel over Dryfuss anyday.

Hopefully we are all on the same page now with what I mean by ""adult""-suffice to say this was one of the few films I saw at the time that didn't have singing animals or Jodie Foster in it.Anyways, I remember thinking Marsha Mason was funny, Quinn Cummings was incredibly cool and Richard Dreyfuss-sigh. I was just in love. Who could forget his immortal line reading of ""And-I-don't-like-the panties-drying-on the line?""Why am I mired in the past you ask? Because so is this movie. This is-I think-the only work Neil Simon wrote specifically for the screen. TNT remade it word for word and sometimes scene for scene. The apartment the two characters fight over even looks exactly the same. Jeff Daniels seems to be channeling the spirit of Richard Dreyfuss-to be fair it would be hard not to. Patricia Richardson is no Marsha Mason. Marsha was bitchier than Pat in the role but you also felt how profoundly hurt she had been. Richardson just seems annoyed and is just not as funny. And you need to be funny to deliver the bitchy bon mots Simon scripted especially for then-wife Mason or you just look...bitchy. Hallie Eisenberg fares the best as Richardson's wise beyond her years daughter (the role originally played by Quinn Cummings.)Watching this when it aired on TNT, I felt a longing to turn it off and watch the original again. Which I see Amazon carries as well.
