They have  remarkable concern and ultimate care for one another.  When the father, a smuggler to the Iran/Iraq border dies, the children take over with incredible courage and compassion.The setting is at the Iran/Iraq border, mountainous snow-filled country, where smugglers risk their lives, health, and their pay,  as their carry heavy loads, some on mules, across the border, often encountering landmines, bandits, and brutal deep snow.  The father of the family is killed during a crossing, thus leaving the eldest, Ayoub, 12 years old,  to rise to adulthood, and care for his siblings.  The children are determined to continue their studies.One of the siblings, a 15-year old is handicapped, needs injections, plus an operation, or he will die soon.  The child, Madi, is dwarf-like, very small.  The oldest boy, Ayoub, is determined to make a crossing, just to have money for Madi's operation.  The oldest daughter, a young teen, is arranged to marry, and she agrees only because, also, there will be a way to have brother's surgery.As usual, the child actors are non-professional.  They have done a wonderful job!  The movie keeps you rooting for the children, and you remain interested the entire film.

Surprisingly, for an amateur cast, the acting is pretty good (compare this with the abysmal acting in the vastly overrated film ""Kandahar"" by Mohsen Makhmalbaf), and the camera work is not bad, but again, there is nothing particularly novel or interesting about this film other than that is Kurdish.  There is something almost patronizing about the praise that has been heaped on this film.  It is as if no matter what a Kurdish director produces, it is going to be praised for its very existence, not as a work of cinema in and of itself.

Not long into the movie, Ayoub's dad dies during one of those smuggling outings and now Ayoub must step in and provide for the rest of his siblings, including his crippled brother who badly needs an operation. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie is filmed using nothing but local, non-professional actors, and what a performance each of them gives, non more so that Ayoub Ahmadi, the 12 yr. old boy (all of the actors used their real names in the movie). Second, it feels as if this movie was shot in &#34;cinema verite&#34; style, which brings you even closer into the scenes. Third, beware, there are a number of tough scenes in the movie which left me emotionally gut-punched, but making this movie all the more powerful.This movie was originally released in 2000, and this DVD is the 2011 re-release by Lorber Films. Unfortunately there are no bonus materials whatsoever, which make this DVD reissue a missed opportunity. That aside, this movie brings an outstanding portrait of the human condition in one of the more challenging places on earth. So glad I saw this movie.

729418,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00007JGIE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Zamani Baray&eacute; Masti Absha (A Time for Drunken Horses) (Bahman Ghobadi, 2000)I have no idea what, exactly, Bahman Ghobadi, a Kurdish filmmaker currently best-known for his film No One Knows About Persian Cats, was thinking when he came up with the plot of A Time for Drunken Horses. Nor what he was ingesting, since I find it very hard to imagine that this movie, or at least some of its stranger details, was conceived by someone in a perfectly sober state. Needless to say, this ups the interest factor on what might otherwise be the kind of movie that some folks might call &#8220;one of those movies where nothing happens.&#8221; They're wrong, of course, but you know exactly the type of movie I'm talking about, the kind that generally appeals to critics and art-film nerds, but that most of the public couldn't care less about. Have you ever seen an Abbas Kiarostami movie? Than yeah, you know what I'm talking about. Kiarostami, too, is Iranian. He's somewhat better-known than Ghobadi. I'm not sure why; both of them are quite good at what they do, both of them take a lot of chances in their work, and both of them have quietly amassed a corpus that is as deep as it is pretty. But first you've got to scratch the surface hard enough to get at what's underneath, and I seem to have talked myself into helping you figure out how to do that with A Time for Drunken Horses, Sit back, relax, etc.As with most slice-of-life movies, A Time for Drunken Horses is essentially plotless for much of its length. It centers on a family of smugglers working the Iran-Iraq border. After the father of the clan is incapacitated, twelve-year-old Ayoub (like all the film's principals, in his only screen appearance) is forced to take over the business, both to feed his family and to save money for the medical care of his handicapped brother Madi (Madi Ekhtiar-dini). The family dynamic is interrupted when the family's uncle negotiates the hand of oldest daughter Rojin (Rojin Younessi) in marriage, which they hope will provide enough of a dowry to pay for an operation for Madi. The film's title refers to the alcohol-spiked water Ayoub and the other smugglers feed their pack mules both to keep them working and to fend off the cold in the Iranian mountains; work too hard, give them too much, and the animals get drunk. With Ayoub working overtime, the animals get very drunk indeed.Many of the reviews of the movie I have read while pondering mine speak to the movie's documentary-like atmosphere. I find that odd&#8212;not because I don't believe that there are families out there in poverty scraping by with smuggling (hell, I can see that in the Cleveland suburbs), but because the entire film is overlaid with a sheen of absurdity it's well-nigh impossible not to notice. The Kiarostami influence is there, of course, and it manifests itself in that blend of realism and absurdism you find in movies like A Taste of Cherry or Shirin. I'm not talking about extended fantasy sequences or anything, just that sense you get that things are just a little off. Things get more off the drunker the pack mules get. This is not coincidental. And then you get to the climax, or what passes for a climax in a film with such flat affect (and that, in itself, is part of what feels so absurd about this movie; it could have gone any way from melodrama to screwball comedy, and instead Ghobadi seems like he's trying to recreate the cinematography of Taiga in a film five times shorter). If you find yourself sitting there saying &#8220;what just happened?&#8221; to yourself, you're not alone. Especially when the credits start rolling a couple of minutes later. A lot of people saw this as huge. I don't know why, but I ended up seeing a curiosity. An interesting one to be sure, but I was not as moved by it as most. ** ",3,Visions of suffering.,1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,3820,"['Zamani', 'Baray', 'eacute', 'Masti', 'Absha', 'Time', 'Drunken', 'Horses', 'Bahman', 'Ghobadi', '2000', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'exactly', 'Bahman', 'Ghobadi', 'Kurdish', 'filmmaker', 'currently', 'best-known', 'film', 'One', 'Persian', 'Cats', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'came', 'up', 'plot', 'A', 'Time', 'Drunken', 'Horses', 'what', 'was', 'ingesting', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'imagine', 'movie', 'least', 'stranger', 'details', 'was', 'conceived', 'someone', 'perfectly', 'sober', 'state', 'Needless', 'say', 'interest', 'factor', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'kind', 'movie', 'folks', 'might', 'call', '8220', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'nothing', 'happens.', '8221', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'course', 'know', 'exactly', 'type', 'movie', ""'m"", 'talking', 'kind', 'generally', 'appeals', 'critics', 'art-film', 'nerds', 'most', 'public', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'about', 'Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'movie', 'Than', 'yeah', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Kiarostami', 'too', 'Iranian', 'somewhat', 'better-known', 'Ghobadi', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'take', 'lot', 'chances', 'work', 'have', 'quietly', 'amassed', 'corpus', 'as', 'deep', 'pretty', 'first', ""'ve"", 'got', 'scratch', 'surface', 'hard', 'enough', 'get', 'what', 'underneath', 'seem', 'have', 'talked', 'helping', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'do', 'Time', 'Drunken', 'Horses', 'Sit', 'back', 'relax', 'etc.As', 'most', 'slice-of-life', 'movies', 'Time', 'Drunken', 'Horses', 'essentially', 'plotless', 'much', 'length', 'family', 'smugglers', 'working', 'Iran-Iraq', 'border', 'father', 'clan', 'incapacitated', 'twelve-year-old', 'Ayoub', 'film', 'principals', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'forced', 'take', 'over', 'business', 'feed', 'family', 'save', 'money', 'medical', 'care', 'handicapped', 'brother', 'Madi', 'Madi', 'Ekhtiar-dini', 'family', 'dynamic', 'interrupted', 'when', 'family', 'uncle', 'hand', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Rojin', 'Rojin', 'Younessi', 'marriage', 'hope', 'will', 'provide', 'enough', 'dowry', 'pay', 'operation', 'Madi', 'film', 'title', 'refers', 'alcohol-spiked', 'water', 'Ayoub', 'other', 'smugglers', 'feed', 'pack', 'keep', 'working', 'fend', 'off', 'cold', 'Iranian', 'mountains', 'work', 'too', 'hard', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'animals', 'get', 'drunk', 'Ayoub', 'working', 'overtime', 'animals', 'get', 'very', 'drunk', 'indeed.Many', 'reviews', 'movie', 'have', 'read', 'pondering', 'mine', 'speak', 'movie', 'documentary-like', 'atmosphere', 'find', 'odd', '8212', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'families', 'out', 'there', 'poverty', 'scraping', 'smuggling', 'hell', 'can', 'see', 'Cleveland', 'suburbs', 'entire', 'film', 'overlaid', 'sheen', 'absurdity', 'well-nigh', 'impossible', 'not', 'notice', 'Kiarostami', 'influence', 'there', 'course', 'blend', 'realism', 'absurdism', 'find', 'movies', 'Taste', 'Cherry', 'Shirin', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'extended', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'anything', 'just', 'sense', 'get', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'off', 'Things', 'get', 'more', 'off', 'drunker', 'pack', 'get', 'not', 'coincidental', 'then', 'get', 'climax', 'what', 'climax', 'film', 'such', 'flat', 'affect', 'part', 'what', 'feels', 'so', 'absurd', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'melodrama', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'instead', 'Ghobadi', 'trying', 'recreate', 'cinematography', 'Taiga', 'film', 'five', 'times', 'shorter', 'find', 'sitting', 'there', 'saying', '8220', 'what', 'just', 'happened', '8221', 'yourself', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'Especially', 'when', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', 'couple', 'minutes', 'later', 'lot', 'people', 'saw', 'huge', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'curiosity', 'interesting', 'one', 'be', 'sure', 'was', 'not', 'moved', 'most', '**']",A Time for Drunken Horses Zamani barayé masti asbha

729420,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00007JGIE,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 8]","The strong feature debut of Iranian director Bahman Ghobadi (`Turtles Can Fly' 'Marooned in Iraq') is a simple story against the background of stark reality of the Kurds living in Iran, or I should say, in Kurdistan the area that includes south-eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, and western Iran. In this `A Time for Drunken Horses' Ghobadi a Kurd himself shows how children must survive on their own in Kurdish village, doing illegal (and highly dangerous) job of smuggling across the border between Iran and Iraq.Ayoub is a 12-year-old boy who works in the town nearby, and he takes care of his elder physically handicapped brother Madi. Madi is slowly getting worse, and Ayoub knows that his brother needs an operation. Madi has also two sisters Rojin and Ameneh, but lost his mother recently, and another sad news arrive - the death of his father on the smuggling trip.Now Ayoub must quit the school and work for his remaining family. This means Ayoub has to follow the footsteps of his father, who went across the Iran-Iraq border as smuggler. But the road is covered with snow, and the trip is risky because of the landmines and soldiers. And the employers may not be trustworthy. Even the mules have to endure very tough trek in the heavy snow (and people have to have them drink whiskey - hence the title though the director changed it to ""horses"").[BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE] Following the tradition of Iranian films in which the line that divides fiction and non-fiction is blurred, Ayoub is played by real-life Kurd boy Ayoub Ahmadi, and Madi by Madi Ekhtiar-dini. They are no professional actors, but the fact works to make the film realistic, sometimes almost like documentary. But what is most impressive is the stunning beauty of the landscapes. The images are often poetic, but still never fail to capture the life of the people living there. You have never seen anything like the awe-inspiring scenes in which the smugglers walk in the snowfield with the mules carrying two huge tires strapped to their sides.Probably not every Kurdish child lives a life like this, and `Marooned in Iraq' Bahman Ghobadi's follow-up to `Drunken Horses' shows a different aspect of the life of Kurdish people (about music in particular). Thus you can see the film as political message from the unjustly treated people, but at the same time it is strong with a more universal theme about the children who must confront the hard reality of life.
