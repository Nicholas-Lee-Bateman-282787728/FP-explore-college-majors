There is no volume 2 either so if you want the rest of season 1 after you buy this you will have to buy the entire first season release anyway. I bought this release because I had recently checked out the complete season 1 at the library and watched it so I wasn't desperate to buy the complete season release. I am a total maniac for the pilot episodes of old TV shows, and I was able to pick up this release with the pilot for practically nothing. It is a quality product as far as production goes, but a person would be better served to spend a little more and get the excellent Ironside complete first season.",3,Don't buy this unless you are like me.,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,680,"['title', 'impression', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'are', 'volume', '2', 'so', 'want', 'rest', 'season', '1', 'buy', 'will', 'have', 'buy', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'release', 'anyway', 'bought', 'release', 'had', 'recently', 'checked', 'out', 'complete', 'season', '1', 'library', 'watched', 'was', ""n't"", 'desperate', 'buy', 'complete', 'season', 'release', 'am', 'total', 'maniac', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'old', 'TV', 'shows', 'was', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'release', 'pilot', 'practically', 'nothing', 'quality', 'product', 'as', 'far', 'production', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'spend', 'little', 'more', 'get', 'excellent', 'Ironside', 'complete', 'first', 'season']","Ironside - Season 1, Vol. 1"
