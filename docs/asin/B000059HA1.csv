An amazing cast of characters, including a one-armed fighter, and a bad guy who masters in the mantis style.  All though at times the flashbacks and storyline slow down the movie, the fights and action make up for it fully.  I definately enjoyed this film, and I think that all kungfu collectors should go out and get it.  A classic.",4,Gordon Liu + wine = a lot of injuries,985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,381,"['Gordon', 'Liu', 'amazing', 'tale', 'revenge', 'amazing', 'cast', 'characters', 'including', 'one-armed', 'fighter', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'mantis', 'style', 'times', 'flashbacks', 'storyline', 'slow', 'down', 'movie', 'fights', 'action', 'make', 'up', 'fully', 'definately', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'think', 'kungfu', 'collectors', 'should', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'classic']",N/A

Well you would be somewhat of the mark with your assumptions on this movie.Gordon Liu plays a man whose parents are brutally murdered when he was a child. As a child he too was left to drown as the local thugs tried to eliminate his entire family. Before he meets his demise, he is rescued and saved by an old drunken monk who raises him while being the meanest old monk on the planet.The monk teaches him kung fu and the ""8 drunk gods technique"". Gordon then decides to take his revenge. First he kidnaps the leaders daughter, who just happens to be an old childhood sweethart of his. When the daughter ends up missing, all hell breaks loose.The fights are choreographed over the top, however, this is clearly not the best from Gordon Liu or the Lau Brothers. Get it because it's a classic.",3,A Classic from Gordon Liu and The Lau Brothers,985046400,"03 20, 2001",2001,954,"['One', 'would', 'assume', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'Chia', 'Hui', 'Lau', 'Kar', 'Fai', 'movie', 'directed', 'Lau', 'Kar', 'Leung', 'Director', 'Drunken', 'Master', '2', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'outstanding', 'Well', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'mark', 'assumptions', 'movie.Gordon', 'Liu', 'man', 'parents', 'are', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'child', 'too', 'was', 'left', 'drown', 'local', 'thugs', 'tried', 'eliminate', 'entire', 'family', 'demise', 'rescued', 'saved', 'old', 'drunken', 'monk', 'who', 'being', 'meanest', 'old', 'monk', 'planet.The', 'monk', 'kung', 'fu', '8', 'drunk', 'gods', 'technique', 'Gordon', 'then', 'take', 'revenge', 'First', 'leaders', 'daughter', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'old', 'childhood', 'sweethart', 'When', 'daughter', 'up', 'missing', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose.The', 'fights', 'are', 'choreographed', 'top', 'however', 'clearly', 'not', 'best', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'Lau', 'Brothers', 'Get', 'classic']",N/A

This movie is fun and its all about the great fight scenes. Absolute fantastic choreography and intense fight sequences make this movie an absolute must have for any MA fan. Gordon Liu is great and depicts the drunken fist style fairly acurately. For those reviewers that only gave this 1 or 2 stars, they obviously have no experience with kung fu films. Don't listen to them, they don't know what they're talking about. I own probably 40 kung fu flicks and this is definetly in the top 10. Up there with Shaolin Temple, Snake and Crane and Fearless Hyena. This one is a must have.
