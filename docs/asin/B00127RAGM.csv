It really was one of the better shows of the 90's. It will still make you laugh, and cry.  Despite the characters not having parents in their lives, they are still very much a ""family"" in the truest sense of the word.  Some of the mistakes they make are pretty ""bone headed"", as you will see, but that's all part of growing up. I wonder why the show ever was canceled?  It scares me to think that in today's political climate it would be, because it actually depicts a family that while isn't perfect, manages to do alright without a mother or father in the picture.  I really wish the networks would concentrate on developing more of this type show, instead of the reality garbage that is stinking up the airwaves today.  If you're a fan of the first two seasons, you will definitely want this one. I want to encourage everyone to buy this set because it is the only way to make sure that the remaining seasons will be produced.  Let's all hope that it won't take 2.5 years though. The reason for 4 out of 5 stars is because there are no featurettes or commentary on episodes.",4,Season 3-Keep'em coming Sony,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,1166,"['just', 'rented', 'Party', 'Five', 'Netflix', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'going', 'buy', 'here', 'really', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'shows', '90', 'will', 'still', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'characters', 'not', 'having', 'parents', 'lives', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'family', 'truest', 'sense', 'word', 'mistakes', 'make', 'are', 'pretty', 'bone', 'headed', 'will', 'see', 'part', 'growing', 'up', 'wonder', 'why', 'show', 'ever', 'was', 'canceled', 'think', 'today', 'political', 'climate', 'would', 'be', 'actually', 'family', 'while', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'do', 'alright', 'mother', 'father', 'picture', 'really', 'wish', 'networks', 'would', 'concentrate', 'developing', 'more', 'type', 'show', 'instead', 'reality', 'garbage', 'stinking', 'up', 'airwaves', 'today', ""'re"", 'fan', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'one', 'want', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'buy', 'set', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'sure', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'produced', 'Let', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', '2.5', 'years', 'reason', '4', '5', 'stars', 'are', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'episodes']",Party of Five: Season 3
1135546,A36R0EG9LQJYQK,B00127RAGM,"Brian Le Flem ""Farscape Fan""","[1, 4]","I only bought this DVD because I'm a Ben Browder fan.  The acting is very good, but most of the characters are very whiny (fault of the writers, obviously).  Often times, you just want to slap them--especially Lacey Chabert's character, and I was so happy when Paula Devicq's character was written out.  Again, I must stress that this is obviously the fault of the writers.  The best character, by far, is Jennifer Love Hewitt's, as she's exceptionally sincere and sweet (but not in a sickening way).  I don't plan on purchasing any other Season, and if this were on TV, I doubt I'd watch it.  If you're a fan of the actors, then this would be a worthwhile purchase, but if you want something with exceptional writing, character development, and compelling stories, then I suggest looking to David E.

It was so depressing on occasion in fact that you'd think it would make you switch off, but it somehow became even more addictive.Season 3's main storyline and emotional highpoint happens during the last third of the season, revolving around Bailey's alcoholism. We are also introduced to Bailey's new roommate Callie (the beautiful Alexondra Lee), and Charlie's relationship storyline evolves beyond Kirsten. The emotional highs are instantly tearjerking and the few moments when all is well with the family of five are wonderfully comforting to see.The DVD's only special features are some minisodes from other television series.At time of writing, Season 4 is not intended to be released.

I guess it didn't hurt that Matthew Fox and Scott Wolf were so hot.  I remember this to be one of my favourite seasons.  It was when Kirsten and Charlie got back together, Bailey goes to college, we meet Grace and you could see Claudia growing up more and more.For a refresher, here are the ways the episodes pan out.SUMMER FUN, SUMMER NOT - Charlie, now back together with Kirsten, is trying to get on with his life until Kirsten's mother unexpectedly shows up and tells them that she has left her husband.

Also, Kirsten's professor discovers that she has unintentionally plagiarized part of her dissertation, and risks losing her teaching position and everything else.DEAL WITH IT - Bailey's friend, Cooper, and Julia are attracted to each other, but Bailey forbids them to date. Bailey then moves out of the Salinger household and into an apartment with a new attractive roommate named Callie Martel, an older woman whom Sarah doesn't approve of.

Meanwhile, Griffin is trying to find a way to spend the $100,000 settlement he got for his knee injury and Julia tells him to help his long-estranged father who is having financial problems.

But her efforts to remain supportive for Bailey's recovery are met with disapproval from Callie who feels left out. When Bailey realizes that Callie's presence is one of the causes of his compulsion to drink, he moves out of her apartment and back into the Salinger house, thus leaving Callie all on her own as before when he first met her. Meanwhile, Claudia tries to show Charlie that Grace is too self-absorbed with running for an office seat and is also too obsessed with publicity than to care about the family. Also, Griffin voices his concern with Julia who's slacking off in school and skipping classes to be with him.A LITTLE FAITH - On Spring Break, Sarah goes away with her parents and Bailey volunteers himself to chaperon Claudia on a trip to Los Angeles for a violin concert in order to distract himself in her absence.

When she brings this news to Griffin, he tells her to put her love for him to the real test, by getting married. On the eve of Grace's election results, Charlie realizes that although he loves Grace, he tells her that she cannot love his siblings or any children like Kirsten did and tells her that his job as the legal guardian for his brothers and sisters must come first.I can't wait to get my copy of this.

It was better than I had remembered and after getting to the end of it, I immediately had to order Season 2. Season 2 was great as well.This show is great because of how it focuses on Character relationships. Each Character has a distinct personality and you feel like you really get to know them in just a short time. The actors are also amazing and they do a great job of making you really feel and care about the characters they portray.A lot of us have been waiting a very long time for Season 3, and it's finally coming to us in March. I am ecstatic about this!If you've never seen this show before, I strongly recommend you give it a shot.

1135558,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B00127RAGM,MollyRK,"[16, 19]","After two and a half years of waiting and wondering if Sony would ever gather enough sense to release Season 3 of ""Party of Five,"" it is finally, FINALLY slated to arrive in March 2008! From the Amazon reviews alone for Seasons 1 and 2, it is obvious that the series has a considerable fan base, with hundreds of people willing to purchase all six season sets, if only they would be made available. Well, that was all left in question when they stopped after Season 2, things appear to be picking up again with this third-year collection, and with that in mind, it's reasonable to believe that they will go ahead with Seasons 4, 5, and 6 in the future. There's no doubt that this is amazing news for all the fans who have patiently waited for this.As for me, I became an avid fan when I picked up the Season 1 DVD on a whim, and although I enjoyed the first year better than the second, I still look forward to purchasing this set when March rolls around. With the show's extremely heavy dose of melodrama and constant pain in the lives of the Salinger kids, it reminds me a lot of fellow 1990's phenomenon ""Beverly Hills 90210,"" which provided another harrowing case study of a group of kids who slip in and out of trouble, make life-changing decisions, and find themselves presented with a mixed bag of happiness and pain at every turn. Bottom line, this is not exactly the best show to watch if you're looking for something uplifting and light, ""Full House"" or ""7th Heaven"" style. Nope, ""Party of Five"" is in a class all its own, and the drama gets kicked up a little higher with every single episode. Naturally, that kind of thing isn't for everyone, but then again, if you're visiting this page, you probably know what it's all about, anyway.Season 3 finds the five Salinger siblings--ranging from ages 3 to (approximately) 24--struggling to sort through their personal lives and somehow remain a family. Oldest brother Charlie might have lost it for good with former soulmate Kirsten, and as he continues with his fickle and often irresponsible ways by having a fling with yet another woman, one has to wonder if he'll ever get it together and find what makes him happy. High school senior Julia suffers with everything from boyfriend woes to suicide, while impressionable young Claudia--who is now officially a teenager--is growing up quickly and could use some love and care from her siblings, but that's tough when they are all so preoccupied with their own affairs, appendicitis-stricken Claudia's only chance at getting to the emergency room at all is by calling 911 on herself. Little Owen is approaching the preschool age and continues to amaze audiences with the fact that despite everything, he somehow manages to get taken care of. I have to tell you, I don't know how it was done sometimes. Then, of course, there is 18-year-old Bailey, who seems to own this season as his once-mature ways are challenged by the independence of college and the realization that being miles away from the drama at home is a pretty sweet deal. This then leaves him with an intense alcohol problem that his own family might not be able to help him with. That's right, this is the season that contains the top-rate ""Intervention"" episode, and it is truly something to see. Be prepared for solid acting performances all around, particularly from Lacey Chabert, who--at the tender age of 13--blows her fellow, seasoned co-stars right out of the water with what is probably the most heartbreaking portrayal in the whole series. As a seventh grader who is watching with horror as her cherished brother, her favorite sibling (her words, not mine), risks ruining his entire life, Chabert's masterful acting and heart-rending facial reactions bring a great deal of credit to the role of Claudia. Few kids her age could have pulled it off, and she deserves big-time props for her emotional range. The whole string of episodes that deal with Bailey's alcoholism are truly incredible pieces of work, mainly because they bring the Salinger siblings together in ways that you didn't see as much in previous years.Again, the show probably doesn't require much more explanation if you are considering buying it in the first place, so all I can say now is THANK YOU to the DVD manufacturers for doing the right thing and bringing Season 3 to DVD at last. It is arguably one of the show's very best years, with intense plot threads and knockout acting performances from beginning to end. With a little luck, they might release another season or two before the end of 2008, and that would really be a reason for longtime fans to ""party.""Note: If you are one who enjoys special features on DVD's, be forewarned that this set contains nothing more than two random ""mini-sodes"" from popualar 1980's shows ""Silver Spoons"" and ""The Facts of Life."" It seems that if we want the episodes on DVD, though, that's the price that must be paid. Quite frankly, it doesn't bother me that much, but I know that some will be disappointed to know that there are no interviews, commentaries, outtakes, etc.....",4,The Salingers kick up the heat in a

Bailey's drinking problem is a major change of behavior from the responsible Bailey seen in the first two seasons, and is one of the strongest indications that living without parents can take a toll on even the most stable of teens. The premise of the show--five siblings trying to raise themselves amid obstacles and the consequences that can arise when there is no adult supervision (in spite of, or maybe because of, the eldest sibling's young-adult age)--is more evident than ever in Bailey's downward spiral. Owen's birthday party scene, in which Bailey literally plays the clown, is poignant and the intervention episode so uncomfortable that it is more real than a lot of post-Party of Five reality TV shows.Definitely one of the best cancelled TV shows ever, and probably the best season of all.",5,Party's best,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,981,"['seasons', 'season', 'three', 'probably', 'best', 'Salinger', 'family', 'number', 'obstacles', 'creating', 'turning', 'points', 'characters', 'Bailey', 'drinking', 'problem', 'major', 'change', 'behavior', 'responsible', 'Bailey', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'strongest', 'indications', 'living', 'parents', 'can', 'take', 'toll', 'even', 'most', 'stable', 'teens', 'premise', 'show', 'five', 'siblings', 'trying', 'raise', 'obstacles', 'consequences', 'can', 'arise', 'when', 'adult', 'supervision', 'spite', 'maybe', 'eldest', 'sibling', 'young-adult', 'age', 'more', 'evident', 'ever', 'Bailey', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Owen', 'birthday', 'party', 'scene', 'Bailey', 'literally', 'clown', 'poignant', 'intervention', 'episode', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'more', 'real', 'lot', 'post-Party', 'Five', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows.Definitely', 'one', 'best', 'cancelled', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'probably', 'best', 'season']",Party of Five: Season 3
