Delaspozas ""Alicia""","[1, 1]","I wanted to get some operas that I wasn&#8217;t familiar with and when I saw this DVD with very good reviews I thought that this was going to be a good selection.  I also knew the two main characters of the cast from other performances. Simon Keenlyside was very good as Macbeth, He showed the ambivalence of this character very well,  for instance he did every thing in his power to be a king even to get involved in commiting murder and having some remorse for his acts. He also was tormented by his dreams as a result of some of the premonitions received by the witches. Opposite to this performer was Ludmila Monastyrska who played Lady  Macbeth with a powerful voice and acting  this ambition character showed with great success  that she was willing to do any thing to be a queen .The rest of the cast as well as the chorus were very good.Using mainly black, red and gold for the scenery and costumes and the effect of the lights to reflect Macbeth&#8217;s tormented dreams mixed with reality made for an outstanding production.The quality of this blu ray was perfect with outstanding sound and filming.

Coombs ""Contemporary clarinet guy""","[18, 19]","Shakespeare's irony filled tragedy of the Scottish warrior and governor (or Thane) whose ambition drives him to murder always makes for great stage and screen. Verdi's librettist, Francesco Piave, sets the Shakespearean English into singer-ready common Italian and compacts the play into a fairly concise - and very compelling - two hours plus. It is also very interesting to watch and listen to how the essential roles are written. Macbeth and his conniving wife are written very chromatically and with some wonderfully threatening parts. King Duncan, his son Malcolm and Macduff, the general of the forces loyal to Malcolm, are given more ""pure"", higher and less sinuous vocals as if to draw sharp contrast between good and evil. This is some of Verdi's best music and among his most dramatic - and violent - stories, as is befitting the dark original play. This production. originally presented in 2002 at the Royal Opera, presents a visually stunning look and feel by director Phyllida Lloyd and designer Anthony Ward.  Heavy on symbolism, there is the gilded cage that the murdered king's crown sits in until it is taken by Macbeth, seeming to symbolize the unattainable - or the not rightfully obtained. The poles of wood carried by the rebel army from Birnam Wood visually echo the sticks used by the cadre of red turbaned witches, with their fairly creepy ""unibrow"" appearance. The physical set is spare, minimalist with bursts of red - bloody and matching the turbans and the bright gold of the king's horsemen is echoed almost in parody by the armor worn by Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. This particular performance is of the 2011 revival and the performances are fantastic as well. Simon Keenlyside is a lean, warrior looking man who portrays his character with a nervous energy and a paranoia that grows as he realizes how accurate the witches' coven seems to be in forecasting his doom.  I thought Liudmyla Monastyrska as Lady Macbeth presented perfectly as the conniving, self serving and - eventually - deranged and paranoid individual who wanted wealth and royalty by using her vain husband. Excellent performances are also given by Steven Ebel as Malcolm and Dimitri Pittas as Macduff. The orchestra and chorus of the Royal Opera House under maestro Antonio Pappano perform very well. Pappano's pacing is spot on and his use of exactly the right blend of punctuated brass and lithe string textures is exactly what is needed in Verdi. The chorus of warriors and courtiers was superbly trained by Renato Balsadonna. I enjoyed this production throughly as the first ""Macbeth"" I had seen (have only heard it before). This beautifully packaged DVD with excellent sound and crisp visuals makes a strong addition for any opera collection. It would even be a very compelling experience for someone just getting into opera.

1517730,ANJFW8DZ4ZCNK,B006NO1SSA,DDD,"[13, 16]","This new release of Verdi's Macbeth from ROH is both a very satisfying and exciting performance. It is highly recommendable. I initially intended to just watch a few minutes of the set, but almost immediately I found myself auditiing the entire performance.Simon Keenlyside has been indited for not being an Italian baritone. This criticism has been leveled at Thomas Hampson and Fischer-Dieskau. All three include this role in their repertoire. DFD made only a studio performance with Elena Suliotis as his Lady. The baritone was subbing for Tito Gobbi; it was performance that has been highly criticized and praised though the latter less so. Hampson's performance came from Zurich in a production which is easy to critcize for its ambiguity, but the baritone delivers a performance of great integrity and with his personal charisma he triumphs over any vocal chortcoming perccived or imagined. Keenlyside is also similarly gifted and triumphs as well. It is clearly a performance to which the singer has devoted both thought and imagination. He brings his considerable vocal gifts to the performance and while they may not include the robust column of sound that Taddei or Gobbi (or Warren or the underrated Robert Weede)had at their disposal his talent as a lieder singer is invoked at every turn; I don't think I have ever heard the text  delivered with such clarity and meaning. There is no attempt to darking and enlarge the sound that is naturally his. His Lady is a Ukranian soprano, Liudmyla Monastyrska. Vocally it is a thrilling performance, fearlessly delivered. Dramatically it has been criticized as immature. At times it does border on the ""hammy"" side, lacking in subtlety. In the house this is probably less of a problem; the camera, alas, captures more than one would like. It is wonderful to hear a big voice deliver the ""small"" notes and not fudge the fioritura; strangely at two points she sings a passage staccato rather than legato. I do not have a score so I have no way of knowing whether or not this is an option or just the caprice of a prima donna! An American, Raymond Acetim sings Banquo. He delivers his aria with requisite gravity and beautiful legato. On additional  musical matters mention must be made of the excellent choral work and the orchestra under Pappano. ROH is very lucky to have this conductor who brings both energy and great talent to his job, one that he loves very much. I don't know whether or not it was Pappano or Keenlyside, but the decision to include the Mal per me from the 1847 score was an excellent decision. It is Macbeth's last utterance and now having heard it I feel that is inclusion is justified and appropriate.At this point I feel I must mention the very first Macbeth that made it to DVD, a performance from Glyndebourne from 1972. The conductor is the late John Pritchard, an artist one would not associate with this music. Even so he is a musician of talent and integrity, perhaps even energized by his superb cast. The young Josephine Barstow is a Lady of one's dreams. No, it is not an Italian voice, but a full blooded spinto who has the full measure of the role. Opposite her is the great Greek baritone who recently died., Kostas Paskalis. For those for whom only an Italian baritone will suffice, look no further. He is the real thing, blessed with musianship and artistry. The Banquo is the very young James Morris.The production is effective and imaginative and while not literal it does an excellent job of evoking medieval Scotland. The costumes are not period appropriate but not a grab bag mixture of period styles, rather simply ""period"". The Witches all wear orange colored turbans and have been given ""uni"" brows. They are utilized in ways that are interesting, e.g., Macbeth's letter is delivered to his Lady  by one of the witches and Banquo's son is saved by a witch.In short a performance of distinction to set along side the Glyndebourne performance",5,An Exciting Macbeth,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,3941,"['new', 'release', 'Verdi', 'Macbeth', 'ROH', 'very', 'satisfying', 'exciting', 'performance', 'highly', 'recommendable', 'initially', 'intended', 'just', 'watch', 'few', 'minutes', 'set', 'almost', 'immediately', 'found', 'auditiing', 'entire', 'performance.Simon', 'Keenlyside', 'been', 'indited', 'not', 'being', 'Italian', 'baritone', 'criticism', 'been', 'leveled', 'Thomas', 'Hampson', 'Fischer-Dieskau', 'three', 'include', 'role', 'repertoire', 'DFD', 'made', 'only', 'studio', 'performance', 'Elena', 'Suliotis', 'Lady', 'baritone', 'was', 'subbing', 'Tito', 'Gobbi', 'was', 'performance', 'been', 'highly', 'criticized', 'praised', 'latter', 'less', 'so', 'Hampson', 'performance', 'came', 'Zurich', 'production', 'easy', 'critcize', 'ambiguity', 'baritone', 'performance', 'great', 'integrity', 'personal', 'charisma', 'vocal', 'chortcoming', 'perccived', 'imagined', 'Keenlyside', 'also', 'similarly', 'gifted', 'triumphs', 'as', 'well', 'clearly', 'performance', 'singer', 'devoted', 'thought', 'imagination', 'considerable', 'vocal', 'gifts', 'performance', 'may', 'not', 'include', 'robust', 'column', 'sound', 'Taddei', 'Gobbi', 'Warren', 'underrated', 'Robert', 'Weede', 'had', 'disposal', 'talent', 'lieder', 'singer', 'invoked', 'turn', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'text', 'delivered', 'such', 'clarity', 'meaning', 'attempt', 'darking', 'enlarge', 'sound', 'naturally', 'Lady', 'Ukranian', 'soprano', 'Liudmyla', 'Monastyrska', 'Vocally', 'thrilling', 'performance', 'fearlessly', 'delivered', 'Dramatically', 'been', 'criticized', 'immature', 'times', 'border', 'hammy', 'side', 'lacking', 'subtlety', 'house', 'probably', 'less', 'problem', 'camera', 'alas', 'more', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'wonderful', 'hear', 'big', 'voice', 'deliver', 'small', 'notes', 'not', 'fudge', 'fioritura', 'strangely', 'two', 'points', 'passage', 'staccato', 'rather', 'legato', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'score', 'so', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'not', 'option', 'just', 'caprice', 'prima', 'donna', 'American', 'Raymond', 'Acetim', 'sings', 'Banquo', 'aria', 'requisite', 'gravity', 'beautiful', 'legato', 'additional', 'musical', 'matters', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'excellent', 'choral', 'work', 'orchestra', 'Pappano', 'ROH', 'very', 'lucky', 'have', 'conductor', 'who', 'energy', 'great', 'talent', 'job', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'was', 'Pappano', 'Keenlyside', 'decision', 'include', 'Mal', '1847', 'score', 'was', 'excellent', 'decision', 'Macbeth', 'last', 'utterance', 'now', 'having', 'heard', 'feel', 'inclusion', 'justified', 'appropriate.At', 'point', 'feel', 'must', 'mention', 'very', 'first', 'Macbeth', 'made', 'DVD', 'performance', 'Glyndebourne', '1972', 'conductor', 'late', 'John', 'Pritchard', 'artist', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'associate', 'music', 'Even', 'musician', 'talent', 'integrity', 'perhaps', 'even', 'energized', 'superb', 'cast', 'young', 'Josephine', 'Barstow', 'Lady', 'one', 'dreams', 'No', 'not', 'Italian', 'voice', 'full', 'blooded', 'spinto', 'who', 'full', 'measure', 'role', 'Opposite', 'great', 'Greek', 'baritone', 'who', 'recently', 'died.', 'Kostas', 'Paskalis', 'whom', 'only', 'Italian', 'baritone', 'will', 'suffice', 'look', 'further', 'real', 'thing', 'blessed', 'musianship', 'artistry', 'Banquo', 'very', 'young', 'James', 'Morris.The', 'production', 'effective', 'imaginative', 'not', 'literal', 'excellent', 'job', 'evoking', 'medieval', 'Scotland', 'costumes', 'are', 'not', 'period', 'appropriate', 'not', 'grab', 'bag', 'mixture', 'period', 'styles', 'rather', 'simply', 'period', 'Witches', 'wear', 'orange', 'colored', 'turbans', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'uni', 'brows', 'are', 'utilized', 'ways', 'are', 'interesting', 'e.g.', 'Macbeth', 'letter', 'delivered', 'Lady', 'one', 'witches', 'Banquo', 'son', 'saved', 'witch.In', 'short', 'performance', 'distinction', 'set', 'along', 'side', 'Glyndebourne', 'performance']",N/A

This is perhaps the most moving and involving performance of the opera I've ever experienced. M. Keenlyside took awhile to warm into the part; most of Act 1 and part of Act 2 he seemed to be doing Hamlet again. However he then became the MAN - bloody Macbeth! and by the last act was singing and acting better than I've ever heard or seen him. A WOW expericence! Lady Macbeth (L. Monastyrska) led off quietly at first and then started to become fully the character in ""La luce langue"". She then grew into the role so that she was completely deranged by the time of ""Una macchia"". I've heard fifty years of Macbeths but I've never heard any performance so utterly frightening as Lludmyla gave. Her stained, strange voice would have pleased Verdi himself. The other roles were very well done as well and all did a creditable job. Most of the production, sets, costumes were all good to seviceable. Phyllida Loyd for the most part kept things going but as most tinkering directors do overdid a few spots. The children business was just too much; especially the ones coming in for the Macbeths. A little of this would have done nicely for suggestive realism but not a whole kindergarten class.

1517732,A16CWY4RZS28DL,B006NO1SSA,F. Fairfield,"[2, 2]","I fully agree with the other 3-star reviewer.  This production is ridiculous.  It is not just that the witches are dressed as  &#34;Tuareg camel drivers&#34;, there are also too many of them; and too many murderers to kill Banquo and his son (in spite of which, the kid does escape).  Also too many children throughout the production; you are reminded of that other scene in the Magic Flute where Papageno (Simon Keenlyside) has jumped into Papagena's bed, and the children are coming to them one after the other ; here you have Macbeth and his wife in a double bed with the witches bringing the children (&#34;First a little Macbethgeno, then a little Macbethgena&#34;) only to remove them almost immediately.As often happens nowadays, the director  ignored the libretto.  &#34;They  vanished&#34; says Macbeth after his first encounter with the witches; actually, they are sitting there, all of them (pretending to be invisible?) -- and they do not have any facial hair.  Later on, we see the witches brewing something and the libretto lists all the ingredients, but there is no cauldron on stage; nevertheless, Macbeth notices that &#34;the cauldron has vanished&#34;.  The cauldron, actually was pre-empted by Lady Macbeth who is taking a bath in it, with her clothes on, trying to wash her hand.  The banquet in Scene 3 becomes a cocktail party:  no table and no chairs for the guests; everybody is standing.  As for &#34;Birnam forest&#34;, the leafy branches that are supposed to hide the attacking army have been reduced to bare sticks (no branches, no leaves); this, we are told in the notes (page 6, just before the synopsis) is &#34;reminiscent of those which the witches waved in the first scene -- a further symbol of their controlling influence.&#34;On the back of the Blu-ray case, you can read that Liudmyla Monastyrska is &#34;both imperious and subtle&#34;; well, she does try hard to look imperious, but is not convincing.  I did not notice much subtlety either.If you are looking for a good Macbeth, you may want to look at the filmed version by Claude d'Anna (1987), with Leo Nucci and Shirley Verrett (conductor: Riccardo Chailly; Deutsche Grammophon; subtitled in English, German, French, Spanish and Chinese).",3,"Great music, awful to watch",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,2233,"['fully', 'agree', 'other', '3-star', 'reviewer', 'production', 'ridiculous', 'not', 'just', 'witches', 'are', 'dressed', '34', 'Tuareg', 'drivers', '34', 'are', 'also', 'too', 'many', 'too', 'many', 'murderers', 'kill', 'Banquo', 'son', 'spite', 'kid', 'escape', 'Also', 'too', 'many', 'children', 'production', 'are', 'reminded', 'other', 'scene', 'Magic', 'Flute', 'where', 'Papageno', 'Simon', 'Keenlyside', 'jumped', 'Papagena', 'bed', 'children', 'are', 'coming', 'one', 'other', 'here', 'have', 'Macbeth', 'wife', 'double', 'bed', 'witches', 'bringing', 'children', '34', 'First', 'little', 'Macbethgeno', 'then', 'little', 'Macbethgena', '34', 'only', 'remove', 'almost', 'immediately.As', 'often', 'nowadays', 'director', 'ignored', 'libretto', '34', 'vanished', '34', 'Macbeth', 'first', 'encounter', 'witches', 'actually', 'are', 'sitting', 'there', 'pretending', 'be', 'invisible', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'facial', 'hair', 'Later', 'see', 'witches', 'brewing', 'something', 'libretto', 'ingredients', 'cauldron', 'stage', 'nevertheless', 'Macbeth', '34', 'cauldron', 'vanished', '34', 'cauldron', 'actually', 'was', 'pre-empted', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'who', 'taking', 'bath', 'clothes', 'trying', 'wash', 'hand', 'banquet', 'Scene', '3', 'cocktail', 'party', 'table', 'chairs', 'guests', 'everybody', 'standing', '34', 'Birnam', 'forest', '34', 'leafy', 'branches', 'are', 'supposed', 'hide', 'attacking', 'army', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'bare', 'sticks', 'branches', 'leaves', 'are', 'told', 'notes', 'page', '6', 'just', 'synopsis', '34', 'reminiscent', 'witches', 'waved', 'first', 'scene', 'further', 'symbol', 'controlling', 'influence.', '34', 'back', 'Blu-ray', 'case', 'can', 'read', 'Liudmyla', 'Monastyrska', '34', 'imperious', 'subtle', '34', 'well', 'try', 'hard', 'look', 'imperious', 'not', 'convincing', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'much', 'subtlety', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'Macbeth', 'may', 'want', 'look', 'filmed', 'version', 'Claude', ""d'Anna"", '1987', 'Leo', 'Nucci', 'Shirley', 'Verrett', 'conductor', 'Riccardo', 'Chailly', 'Deutsche', 'Grammophon', 'subtitled', 'English', 'German', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Chinese']",N/A

This is a brilliant Macbeth to listen to - all the singers were excellent -- but visually I would have thrown rotten tomatoes at the director if I had been in the audience --- In short visually it is just plain terrible and ugly.The witches are all costumed like Tuareg Camel drivers -- I tended to think of them as the Camel Caravan. Lady Macbeth's attendants looked like they escaped from a Benedictine Priory. They were not costumed like ladies in Waiting. The male chorus, including Macbeth, by the end of the opera were dressed as if they worked for a moving & storage company as they were wearing the wide belts associated with heavy lifting. I doubt if this director has a clue what was worn in 11th century Scotland. And apparently he was too lazy to even find out.  When he put some armor on the chracters in the first act - they all looked like Cortez or Pizarro.The Carousel horses were ludicrous in their flowing skits. The main stage prop for the end of the opera is large metal box made of bars. I suppose one was suppose to see some inner meaning it, but frankly it didn't do anything for me and I had no idea why it was there.Also the costume for Lady MacBeth was distinctly unflatteringly. It used to be that those in charge of costumes made every effort for a flattering appearance even when the soprano was of generous propotions, as this soprano is. The white clinging costume she wore was downright ugly and unflattering. If I had been she I would have refused to wear it.This was the now favored unitary stage with sliding pieces -- no effort made to use the stage machinery provided to really stage the opera. We just slide some pieces up and down and get the camel caravan to push some of the props on stage. I am beginning to think that productions like these will discourage a whole generation of opera goers who will have no idea what is happening since the staging bears no realationship to the libretto. In fact the compose would have a hard time recognizing this as his opera.I have one final complaint. When did conductors dress like slobs?  You would think this was a dress rehearsal. I prefer to see my conductors in white tie and tails - I like the formality that a generation of conductor like von. Karajan brought to the podium. I suppose if you can't conduct like him there is no point in trying to dress like him - you might as well dress like a slob as this conductor did.",3,Auido 5 Star - Visual 0 Star,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,2462,"['Opera', 'visual', 'auditory', 'experience', 'brilliant', 'Macbeth', 'listen', 'singers', 'were', 'excellent', 'visually', 'would', 'have', 'thrown', 'rotten', 'tomatoes', 'director', 'had', 'been', 'audience', 'short', 'visually', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'ugly.The', 'witches', 'are', 'costumed', 'Tuareg', 'Camel', 'drivers', 'tended', 'think', 'Camel', 'Caravan', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'attendants', 'looked', 'escaped', 'Benedictine', 'Priory', 'were', 'not', 'costumed', 'ladies', 'Waiting', 'male', 'chorus', 'including', 'Macbeth', 'end', 'opera', 'were', 'dressed', 'worked', 'moving', 'storage', 'company', 'were', 'wearing', 'wide', 'belts', 'associated', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'doubt', 'director', 'clue', 'was', 'worn', '11th', 'century', 'Scotland', 'apparently', 'was', 'too', 'lazy', 'even', 'find', 'out', 'When', 'put', 'armor', 'chracters', 'first', 'act', 'looked', 'Cortez', 'Pizarro.The', 'Carousel', 'horses', 'were', 'ludicrous', 'flowing', 'skits', 'main', 'stage', 'prop', 'end', 'opera', 'large', 'metal', 'box', 'made', 'bars', 'suppose', 'one', 'was', 'suppose', 'see', 'inner', 'meaning', 'frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'had', 'idea', 'why', 'was', 'there.Also', 'costume', 'Lady', 'MacBeth', 'was', 'distinctly', 'unflatteringly', 'used', 'be', 'charge', 'costumes', 'made', 'effort', 'flattering', 'appearance', 'even', 'when', 'soprano', 'was', 'generous', 'propotions', 'soprano', 'white', 'clinging', 'costume', 'wore', 'was', 'downright', 'ugly', 'unflattering', 'had', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'refused', 'wear', 'it.This', 'was', 'now', 'favored', 'unitary', 'stage', 'sliding', 'pieces', 'effort', 'made', 'use', 'stage', 'machinery', 'provided', 'really', 'stage', 'opera', 'just', 'slide', 'pieces', 'up', 'down', 'get', 'camel', 'caravan', 'push', 'props', 'stage', 'am', 'beginning', 'think', 'productions', 'will', 'discourage', 'whole', 'generation', 'opera', 'goers', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'happening', 'staging', 'realationship', 'libretto', 'fact', 'compose', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'recognizing', 'opera.I', 'have', 'one', 'final', 'complaint', 'When', 'did', 'conductors', 'dress', 'slobs', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'prefer', 'see', 'conductors', 'white', 'tie', 'like', 'formality', 'generation', 'conductor', 'von', 'Karajan', 'brought', 'podium', 'suppose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'conduct', 'point', 'trying', 'dress', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'slob', 'conductor', 'did']",N/A
1517734,A3ODKKGVALLI2G,B006NO1SSA,Keris Nine,"[35, 35]","If the concept behind Phyllida Lloyd's direction at the Royal Opera House production of Verdi's Macbeth (revived here under director Harry Fehr) isn't immediately obvious and doesn't seem totally coherent, it's perhaps because the marriage of Verdi and Shakespeare itself in this earlier opera of the composer (unlike the magnificent later adaptations Otello and Falstaff) isn't the most consistent or coherent either. Lloyd's production however remains faithful to Verdi's imperfect interpretation of the work, working closely to mirror the tone of the production with what Simon Keenlyside, in an accompanying interview on the DVD and Blu-ray, vividly describes as the ""black tides"" of Verdi's score. Partly, that's mirrored in the black, white and red colour schemes, but there's also a sense that the production wants to put all the dark violence, all the horror and its consequences right up there on the stage also.Here the true nature of the violence is made ever present, and the full extent of its consequences made real. The reign of blood that is embarked upon is visible throughout here and no amount of hand-washing will completely erase it. The stage is often littered with the bodies of Macbeth's crimes that usually take place off-stage, and since all this is so vividly described in Verdi's score, why shouldn't it? Directing the orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Antonio Pappano seems determined also to tease out some greater subtleties in the score that aren't really there (although theCurrentzis/Tcherniakov productionfor the Paris Opera would beg to differ) and, consequently, it's a little bit too delicate when a bit of a heavier punch would be more appropriate, but it does nonetheless manage to draw that gloomy darkness out of the work very well. For all its efforts to put the horror up on the stage and the close attention paid to the score however, there's initially a detachment between the orchestration and the performances in Act I at least, which seems to be down to there not being enough attention paid to the acting. Things warm up a little by the end of Act II, Act III's potions, prophesies and apparitions are delightfully staged, and thereafter the deepening horror of the drama and the score starts to make the full extent of its presence felt.At the very least, the listener will be beaten into submission - as they should be - by the singing and presence of Lady Macbeth. The formidable ringing tone and sheer power of Ukranian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska's voice certainly achieves that, even if there isn't always an emotional depth behind her pronouncements and her acting ability is practically non-existent. With that voice, and Verdi behind it, that's not something to worry about in this particular opera however. On the lighter end of the register Simon Keenlyside is a true Verdi baritone. His consideration of his lines and delivery of them makes real the forced bravado and the underlying horror of his fate that lies in his character. That's quite impressive, particularly in his death scene aria 'Mal per me' (the opera working from Verdi's 1865 revision of the opera, but successfully reinstating some of the 1847 cuts like this one). Banquo is also well served by American bass, Raymond Aceto, and his Gran Scena 'Studia il passo, o mio figlio' is sung very well.The Blu-ray release of Macbeth is up to the expected high standards, the strong high contrast lighting showing good detail, while the mixing on both the PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 tracks give a fine account of the score, the mixing (along with Pappano's conducting), achieving a good balance between the orchestration and the singing voices. Extras on the BD include a Cast Gallery, Behind the Scenes Rehearsals and Interviews with Simon Keenlyside, Raymond Aceto and Liudmyla Monastyrska.

Later on I questioned some temps that seemed a little slow during Lady M's aria and the drinking song.  I'm not sure if this was the soprano's choice or the conductor's, but I found it distracting and labored in a few places.  The chorus is exquist and the other lead voices are very fine and not pushed.  Lady M and M were beautifully sung by very well produced voices.  This is the only production that I have heard where the two leads' voices were not overly huge and produced.  They were lighter than I have heard previously, but sang on the breath and never pushed or barked at each other like some of the heavier voices do.  I questioned some blocking issues that had Lady M wandering back and forth against the back wall in her first aria where I would have liked her further down stage.  Although Macbeth's acting was very good, I felt more of a one demention to Lady M who could only seem to produce one sinister look throughout the opera.  I felt she held back emotionally and I would have liked to have seen more sparks between the two leads.  The set was sparse, but it worked with the ever-smooth lucid blockiing of the fantastic chorus.  Sometimes I was wondering why the witches were in certain scenes not originally called for, but I soon got the message of the stage director and went with it.  One of the many good things about this production were the lack of cuts.  It is the first time I have heard Macbeth's lines after he was slain.  Normally, the opera is cut after he is slain and everyone's happy and the peseants rejoice.  I noticed more music than I hadn't heard before and I found that a very nice surprise.  I really like the production, but I was not thrilled.  However, if you are looking for a new production that will keep your interest, sung exceptionally beautiful, this is a very fine production.",4,"GOOD, NOT THRILLING",1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,1979,"['share', 'much', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'already', 'first', 'thing', 'caught', 'attention', 'was', 'energy', 'orchestra', 'brilliant', 'conducting', 'Later', 'questioned', 'temps', 'seemed', 'little', 'slow', 'Lady', 'M', 'aria', 'drinking', 'song', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'soprano', 'choice', 'conductor', 'found', 'distracting', 'labored', 'few', 'places', 'chorus', 'exquist', 'other', 'lead', 'voices', 'are', 'very', 'fine', 'not', 'pushed', 'Lady', 'M', 'M', 'were', 'beautifully', 'sung', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'voices', 'only', 'production', 'have', 'heard', 'where', 'two', 'leads', 'voices', 'were', 'not', 'overly', 'huge', 'produced', 'were', 'lighter', 'have', 'heard', 'previously', 'sang', 'breath', 'never', 'pushed', 'barked', 'other', 'heavier', 'voices', 'do', 'questioned', 'blocking', 'issues', 'had', 'Lady', 'M', 'wandering', 'back', 'forth', 'back', 'wall', 'first', 'aria', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'further', 'down', 'stage', 'Macbeth', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'felt', 'more', 'one', 'demention', 'Lady', 'M', 'who', 'could', 'only', 'seem', 'produce', 'one', 'sinister', 'look', 'opera', 'felt', 'held', 'back', 'emotionally', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'sparks', 'two', 'leads', 'set', 'was', 'sparse', 'worked', 'ever-smooth', 'lucid', 'blockiing', 'fantastic', 'chorus', 'Sometimes', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'witches', 'were', 'certain', 'scenes', 'not', 'originally', 'called', 'soon', 'got', 'message', 'stage', 'director', 'went', 'One', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'production', 'were', 'lack', 'cuts', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'heard', 'Macbeth', 'lines', 'was', 'slain', 'Normally', 'opera', 'cut', 'slain', 'everyone', 'happy', 'peseants', 'rejoice', 'noticed', 'more', 'music', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'found', 'very', 'nice', 'surprise', 'really', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'thrilled', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'new', 'production', 'will', 'keep', 'interest', 'sung', 'exceptionally', 'beautiful', 'very', 'fine', 'production']",N/A

Macbeth is an opera which is seldom performed so I have not seen as many performances of it as one might expect. However, I have never seen a satisfying performance live of this opera. This DVD from Covent Garden is the best performance of Macbeth I have ever seen, and I suspect that I would be saying this even had I actually seen many performances. The cast is outstanding. Simon Keenlyside is one of my favorite baritones and a brilliant Hamlet in the Covent Garden performance on DVD with Natalie Dessay. His performance as Macbeth is equally excellent both vocally and dramatically. I had never heard Liudmyla Monastyrska before, therefore, her Lady Macbeth was a stunning surprise. She is imperious and menacing and yet subtle and complex. Her performance is riveting.

And this production does not disappoint in the slightest.Everyone is familiar with the story of Macbeth, but Mr. Keenlyside brings a true-seeming broodiness to the title role - at first reluctant, then willing to commit murder at the urging of his wife (played masterfully by Liudmyla Monastryska), then expecting to triumph over the dictates of fate and finding that what the coven of witches revealed to him is becoming all too true.  It is a testament to Mr. Keenlyside's performance that you feel both sad for his character and glad to see him get what is coming to him all at the same time.  The imagery of the crown being kept in a golden cage fits perfectly.As for Lady Macbeth, Ms. Monastryska is captivating, initially greedy and cunning, but subtle and driving at the same time, simultaneously evoking feelings of sadness and just desserts as the deeds that she and her husband have done drive her sleepwalking - and the blood that has been shed preys on her subconscious.  Verdi demands vocal gymnastics from his leading lady, and she delivers with room to spare.  Simply marvelous.As for the overall production itself, it is well staged, not too much set and not too minimalist, with just the right amount of blood evidenced for this viewer.  Antonio Pappano does a good job with the orchestra, supporting the production and not distracting from it, while at the same time responding to the nuances of his cast.  And the coven of witches (lots of them!) all in scarlet turbans is a nice touch.  I enjoyed this immensely.
