Skinwalkers is simply a good old fashion horror/action/fantasy with a new twist on the werewolf plot. It's also entertaining! Slick looking with decent effects, it is good B-horror like the Carpenter films. The DVD quality is top notch. Sound and picture are state-of the-art. ( Running length is 91 min. minus 8 min. of credits. So it's a nice shorty ) Many reviews made me think the film was all bikers and guns, guns, guns...There is that , but many other elements in the mix like drama, atmosphere and some sex.The production was troubled, there were cuts, script changes (Director commentary notes these problems) yet a good movie still emerged. Even Orson Welles had these problems. Isaac did what he could with a story he felt passionate about. The result is a real treat! I'm glad I bought it and I'll watch it many times.Everybody was so rough on this flick that I had to look for myself and so should you.

1103974,AK0CENM3LUM28,B000VSDNFA,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","Skinwalkers / B000VSDNFA*Spoilers*I wanted to like ""Skinwalkers"", in the same vein that I like a lot of low-budget productions, but I just can't. It's not so much that there's anything wrong with it, so much as it's just so shallow and watered-down that it's hard to stay focused on the movie long enough to make it to the end.The acting is fine, really - in fact, much better than I usually expect from a hastily thrown together B-movie. And it's nice to see the actress fromBeowulf, who seems to specialize in iron-willed women who take horror movie events nicely in stride - something that most movies won't allow their heroines to do. And while the special effects are few and far between, and monstrously cheap when they do show up, I can accept that because god knows movies are expensive enough without having to try to make 'werewolves' look more like wolves and less like vampires with some extra body hair tagged on.No, what really sinks ""Skinwalkers"" is not the B-movie acting, or the low special effects budget, or the cookie-cutter 'chosen one' plot. What sinks it is how incredibly slow and shallow it feels as the actors slog to the finish line. There are a few good moments here, such as the shoot-out in the town'o'werewolves (although the whole thing is somewhat marred by the fact that, though the townspeople prepared enough in advance to plant guns under every bench and doorstep, they apparently then failed to *practice* shooting them or even learn how to AIM), but for the most part the entire movie is based around a bunch of people standing around and talking incessantly about irrelevant topics. The overall effect is just so bland and uninteresting that it's hard to even get worked up enough to criticize it - it's not a BAD movie, it's just inexcusably DULL.I could criticize it for the cookie-cutter plot, which is about as predictable at this point as the sun rising in the mornings, but it feels unfair to slam an obvious B-movie for overusing tropes like ""the chosen kid"", ""the strong single mother"", ""the missing-presumed-dead father"", and ""the 'turned' ally"". Really, this movie is so trite and shallow that it almost feels like a kids' movie, except that the violence will probably not be suitable for younger viewers.

1103976,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000VSDNFA,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","I could describe ""Skinwalkers"" if only I knew what it was about. Rarely has a supernatural thriller worked so hard at making absolutely no sense; every scene was crafted so superficially, with the filmmakers focusing on the look as opposed to the story. Not that it was all that good looking. If anything, the digital and makeup effects amount to nothing more than a direct to video horror film. What exactly are we being asked to watch here? If it's something with more depth than werewolves fighting amongst themselves, I'm afraid something was seriously lacking. The beginning of the year saw the release of ""Blood and Chocolate,"" a werewolf fable that many thought I was crazy for recommending. I admit that it's not a masterpiece, but good grief, at least it actually has a story. ""Skinwalkers,"" at best, only has an idea.The film operates under the premise that werewolves--or skinwalkers, according to old Native American beliefs--have divided themselves into two categories: those that think their condition is a blessing, and those that think it's a curse. The former can't resist the urge to feed on human blood, and they'll do anything to make sure that urge remains. The latter, on the other hand, purposely deny themselves blood by being strapped up whenever the full moon arises. They want to lead a normal human life, a life that isn't bogged down by the instinct to hunt. The only way this can happen is through a prophecy; apparently, when a half-blooded boy reaches his thirteenth year, werewolves will lose their natural urges.Okay, then. Now all we need is a plot to go with this, and we'll be in business. If only ""Skinwalkers"" had one. Every scene, every character, and every event is so haphazardly constructed that they almost seemed to belong in a different film. I distinctly remember two scenes in which shootouts take place, scenes that could have been entertaining had they not been so ridiculously out of place. The first one happens in the middle of a small town street; the filmmakers actually expected us to believe that everyone who lives there carries some type of gun, even the mailman. The second one happens in a hospital, a place where no one seems to care that people wander the halls with their guns ready.Just as baffling are the major characters, all of which seem so lost in the material that they don't know how the scenes should be played. The most important character is twelve-year-old Timothy (Matthew Knight), who's about ready to turn thirteen. He, of course, is the special child mentioned in the prophecy, and he's fiercely guarded by a band of werewolves, most notably his uncle, Jonas (Elias Koteas). His mother, Rachel (Rhona Mitra), is also protective, but she's also in the dark about werewolves, having been protected from the truth for years. They want Timothy to live because, come his birthday, he'll bring their days of uncontrollable hunting and feeding to an end. Naturally, the leader of the opposing werewolf faction--Varek (Jason Behr)--wants Timothy dead.As the characters stumble through the film, they find themselves in one mess after another, all of which end with silly escape scenes and the obligatory deaths of meaningless side characters. Varek and his band of motorcycle-riding baddies pursue Timothy and his protectors relentlessly, stopping only when necessary. Take, for example, a moment in a middle-of-nowhere bar--they attack and eat two men that tried to rape a waitress on a pool table. After that, they eat the waitress. What exactly was the point of this scene? To show that werewolves need to feed periodically? Oh, please. This idea did not have to be conveyed, and especially not through a scene like this. We already know that werewolves attack and eat people; it wouldn't matter whether or not the victims deserved it.How any of this came to be is anyone's guess. How did this werewolf cycle start? Why are so few at war with each other? Why only a handful of renegades after Timothy when it should be thousands? I ask these questions, but I suppose it doesn't matter whether or not I get the answers. I cared so little for this film that at a certain point, I could only think about leaving the theater and going home. I simply can't imagine how anyone could find this film entertaining. It's virtually impossible to get into, having absolutely no engaging qualities or even the tiniest hint of potential. It's about as unwelcome as the sight of a blood red moon, a prominent feature in this film. I don't presume to wonder why the rest of the world ignored this lunar phenomenon; it's a supernatural oddity included for spectacle, not for sense or reason.Pretty much the same thing can be said for ""Skinwalkers"" as a whole. This is one of the weakest monster movies I've ever seen, lacking in everything from story to cohesion to a general sense of direction. The only thing about it that works is its consistency in being a bad movie, which, believe me, is not saying very much.",1,A Wolf in Human's Clothing,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,4974,"['could',

It's like a modern day western with werewolves.The effects are nice, a mix of makeup appliances and CG, but interestingly the werewolf design is along the lines of the classic Lon Chaney Wolfman and not extremely canine as one might expect to see given the potential of available digital technology and other films with more radical, and cooler, werewolf designs.Transformations were also done mostly through cuts and not visual full-sequence. In fact one transformation scene, in which a werewolf is seen returning to human form, is very similar to the old school lapse-dissolve used in the afore mentioned Wolfman. I'm not sure if this was an intentional tribute to that classic film or just a bad morph job. I find it hard to believe it is the result of poor craftsmanship considering that the rest of the digital work in the film was pretty seamless and effective.The plot is okay, the action is good, the effects are good, the acting is okay, the cinematography is great but the color in some spots seems over-saturated, though the high contrast works. The ending is a bit thin but there is a fun twist with the grim reaper which adds a bit of comic relief from the relatively poor finale.The story goes something like this: there is a feud between two rival groups of werewolves. One group strives to be normal human beings, controlling their urges (restrained during their moon swings) while the others accept their natural ways and wish to continue their regular consumption of human blood without interruption.That interruption will occur when the chosen child turns 13, and for whatever supernatural reason upsets the carnivorous state of affairs for the wolf-naturalists. Of course this boy must be killed, so maiming, killing and transformations ensue as the good werewolves try desperately to stay one step ahead of the bad werewolves. Ain't that always the way.The child is the offspring of a woman who is part of the good wolf family - though she is non-werewolf, and hitherto unaware of her wolfish relations - and the leader of the opposing, marauding werewolf-pack.We're never quite sure what supernatural power makes the boy the key player, but whatever it is ultimately wins out and all ends well for mom, son and wolfdad. The boys thirteenth birthday brings the werewolf curse to an end and the family unit promptly returns to smiles and a future of fun and happiness, shrugging off the last hour and a half of bullets, bloodshed and bodies.It's basically an okay reworking of werewolf lore.

But to keep Tim safe, they will have to battle Varek and his big bad gang, despite vowing never to commit any acts of werewolfen violence.Yeah, it's pretty much the script for any derivative fantasy story -- there's a lazily-explained prophecy about the Big Savior (nobody ever explains where these prophecies come from), evil people who want to kill him, and good people who are keeping him safe. You'll find all this in ""Skinwalkers,"" and not a lot more.Instead, we get a lot of werewolves acting crazy and very, very evil. Gore. Bad editing during a rape scene. More gore. Shots of the moon. Shooting, lots of long tangled hair, motorcycles, and sexy women wearing leather.In fact, that's basically all ""Skinwalkers"" has going for it -- what little plot there is is incomprehensible, and usually not very well explained or scripted (""I am not human! I am better than that!"").  Apparently due to the dearth of plot, the writers tried to throw a curveball late in the film -- all I can say is, I kept expecting the ""Star Wars"" theme to play.And the actors do as well as can be expected, given the paper-thin depth of their characters -- Behr does a decent job growling and overacting, but Knight is embarrassingly bad, even for a child actor. The others... well, I have a bit of trouble recalling them, because few of them got to do much.""Skinwalkers"" suffers from a massive overdose of C-movie cheeze, with little plot and even less acting.

1103982,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000VSDNFA,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 2]","SKINWALKERSHave you ever been real excited to see something and then once it was over you felt a little, eh. If you have had that feeling chances are you were watching this movie which actually is not a horrible film, but it could have been so much more. I will say from the start that I bought this movie when it first came out for one reason, James Roday was one of the writers. For those who for some reason don't know who he is, he plays the lead character of Sean on ""PSYCH"" on the USA network. I am a huge fan of the show and so when I found out about this I had to check it out, plus he is from San Antonio Texas [formerly my city as well]. So I put this in and was ready to be entertained and at least in the end it did that. Before I get into the movie you must first learn what a skinwalker is, and yes of course it is a werewolf.The actual myth behind skin-walkers is from Native Americans who believed a skin-walker to be some one who had the ability to transform into any animal of his or her choosing. It is also believed by some that they can steal the skin or morph into the form of another person there is a lot more to this legend but I won't go into them right now [though I do recommend researching this subject, very interesting stuff]. This film is loosely based on this concept since it never really goes to much into all of that, and the only animal being transformed into are wolves. Still it is a very entertaining movie that is still kinda disappointing, I am confused as well.This movie is all about two different kinds of werewolves literally coming down to bad ones vs good ones, yes it is that simple. It turns out that during a two or three day period the moon will shine red which sets into motion an ancient prophecy that says a child of both human and skinwalker [half breed] will change into something that can cure the skinwalker curse. Of course the ""bad"" ones don't want this because they look at it as a gift not a curse, while the ""good"" ones find it to be a curse. The prophecy is never really discussed and you never know why or how this came to be but what ever I guess. So the bad ones are off on the hunt to try to kill this 13 year boy before the final night of the red moon. So naturally the good ones are trying to keep him safe and on an interesting side note they can't feed on humans. They must be locked down every night because if they feed on humans they become bad werewolves, yes that really is what happens.The movie boils down to a group of biker werewolves that are shooting towns up like crazy with all kinds of guns and explosions. Really this is an action film more so than anything else since a majority of the film is during the day with guns a blazin. This is great if you go into this knowing this is that type of film, those expecting a great horror film will be disappointed. This honestly would have been magnificent if it were to be done by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, a crazy werewolf biker shoot em up style flick a la ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" style. I must admit that the first half of this film is really entertaining and one of the must fun popcorn movies ever. But the last half of the movie suffers a little and goes back and forth to much in trying to decide what it wants to be. But the last scene or so sets up a possible sequel that if handled right could be great.I read in an interview that James Roday was a little disappointed with how they treated the script, I guess the original script was based more so on the actual Indian belief then the final product let on. Still for what it is fellow screenwriters Todd Harthan and James DeMonaco as well as Roday have crafted a great over the top fun film. Still I wonder what this film was originally supposed to be like, could have been classic maybe. Changes may have been made by executive producer Robert Kulzer who produced similar films like the ""Resident Evil"" films. Director Jim Isaac who also directed and produced ""Jason X"" I believe did a great job as far as the action goes and shows that as a director he can make an entertaining flick and can keep things moving but at times the direction like in the last half seems to falter a bit.Acting wise this is your typical b plot and type film and the acing follows suit. In fact as far as some of the cast goes and the style of this film it reminds me of the ""Feast"" series kinda, more so the last two then the first. Elias Koteas how ever does turn in a great performance as one would expect since the man is a great actor, and I also like the old woman how played the kids grandma. But I must say all of the actors did a good job with this type of flick and while some of the characters are kind of flat it still was entertaining.Hey any movie were a gang of biker werewolves ride into a small country town and start shooting it all up and along with them the townspeople [old and young] start pulling out shotguns and such of their own and blast away is cool with me. This is far from a perfect movie and the last half does suffer this is still a very entertaining movie. And while the film makes no sense at all sometimes that is just what you need. Drinks, pizza and a brainless flick is all that is required to have good time in my house.",3,"FUN BRAINLESS FLICK-QUENTIN TARANTINO, ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, AND JAMES RODAY COULD MAKE THIS A

1104004,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000VSDNFA,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[5, 6]","One of the best traditional werewolf tales to come along in any medium in ages, ""Skinwalkers"" - named after a Native American term for human-animal shapechangers - features a rivalry between opposing factions of werewolves (a favorite theme in more contemporary werewolf movies), and centers on a prophesied child who it's foretold will play a major role in the history of the werewolf struggle.Rather than being an immensely powerful new breed of werewolf, the blood of the child is supposed to hold a cure for the werewolf condition.  Hence, he's seen as a blessing by the skinwalkers who fight their condition and a menace by those who relish their lycanthropy.  In the world of ""Skinwalkers"", the lycanthropic condition is highly feral, driven by a ferocious bloodlust and, usually, by radical changes in temperament, especially when the werewolf has consumed fresh blood.  In this way it's very different from tales like the ""Underworld"" movies (which are also great, just in a different way) and most other recent werewolf films, where the creature often retains high intelligence and, while primal, a degree of control over itself.  Actually, the 'modern' take is more true to real wolves, while the 'traditional' werewolf is a near-mindless, snarling, frothing, kill-'em-for-the-sake-of-killing, monster.  And this is the breed in Skinwalkers, although many of those afflicted with the curse struggle against their other selves, and with the help of non-affected human allies, have found ways to contain the killing fury, including being strapped into specially constructed immobile harnesses before night falls during the full moon.That the werewolves's changes are almost completely dictated by the moon phases is another difference from the more versatile, change-at-will, werewolves from many other recent films.  Although in some circumstances it seems the change can be triggered during daylight hours, it's rare and seems to carry a high price.  The limitation of the transformation to certain nights also accounts for why the werewolf characters are sometimes armed with guns during the day, ignoring them at other times for the more 'natural' way of claw and fang.The prophesied child is already alive and is unaware of his nature, as is his mother, who've been being secretly watched and looked after by an alliance of 'good' werewolves and normal humans, who eagerly await the boy's thirteenth birthday, when he's supposed to begin fulfilling his destiny.  That birthday is fast approaching and the 'bad' werwolves are closing in, targetting any known members of this 'alliance' to try and ferret out the boy's whereabouts.A detailed sense of characterization, good performances, strong special effects, and frequent innovation have amped up what could have been a good but run-of-the-mill tale into something better.  This is one of the best 'classic mode' werewolf movies not just recently, but of all time, and a sadly under-seen and under-rated horror gem.",5,One Of The Best Traditional-Style Werewolf Movies In Ages,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,2979,"['One', 'best', 'traditional', 'werewolf', 'tales', 'come', 'along', 'medium', 'ages', 'Skinwalkers', 'named', 'Native', 'American', 'term', 'human-animal', 'shapechangers', 'rivalry', 'opposing', 'factions', 'werewolves', 'favorite', 'theme', 'more', 'contemporary', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'centers', 'prophesied', 'child', 'who', 'foretold', 'will', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'history', 'werewolf', 'struggle.Rather', 'being', 'immensely', 'powerful', 'new', 'breed', 'werewolf', 'blood', 'child', 'supposed', 'hold', 'cure', 'werewolf', 'condition', 'Hence', 'seen', 'blessing', 'skinwalkers', 'who', 'fight', 'condition', 'menace', 'who', 'relish', 'lycanthropy', 'world', 'Skinwalkers', 'lycanthropic', 'condition', 'highly', 'feral', 'driven', 'ferocious', 'bloodlust', 'usually', 'radical', 'changes', 'temperament', 'especially', 'when', 'werewolf', 'consumed', 'fresh', 'blood', 'way', 'very', 'different', 'tales', 'Underworld', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'just', 'different', 'way', 'most', 'other', 'recent', 'werewolf', 'films', 'where', 'creature', 'often', 'high', 'intelligence', 'primal', 'degree', 'control', 'Actually', ""'modern"", 'take', 'more', 'true', 'real', 'wolves', ""'traditional"", 'werewolf', 'near-mindless', 'snarling', 'frothing', ""kill-'em-for-the-sake-of-killing"", 'monster', 'breed', 'Skinwalkers', 'many', 'afflicted', 'curse', 'struggle', 'other', 'selves', 'help', 'non-affected', 'human', 'allies', 'have', 'found', 'ways', 'contain', 'killing', 'fury', 'including', 'being', 'strapped', 'specially', 'constructed', 'immobile', 'harnesses', 'night', 'falls', 'full', 'moon.That', 'werewolves', 'changes', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'dictated', 'moon', 'phases', 'difference', 'more', 'versatile', 'change-at-will', 'werewolves', 'many', 'other', 'recent', 'films', 'circumstances', 'change', 'can', 'be', 'triggered', 'daylight', 'hours', 'rare', 'carry', 'high', 'price', 'limitation', 'transformation', 'certain', 'nights', 'also', 'accounts', 'why', 'werewolf', 'characters', 'are', 'sometimes', 'armed', 'guns', 'day', 'ignoring', 'other', 'times', 'more', ""'natural"", 'way', 'claw', 'fang.The', 'prophesied', 'child', 'already', 'alive', 'unaware', 'nature', 'mother', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'being', 'secretly', 'watched', 'looked', 'alliance', ""'good"", 'werewolves', 'normal', 'humans', 'who', 'eagerly', 'await', 'boy', 'thirteenth', 'birthday', 'when', 'supposed', 'begin', 'fulfilling', 'destiny', 'birthday', 'fast', 'approaching', ""'bad"", 'werwolves', 'are', 'closing', 'targetting', 'known', 'members', ""'alliance"", 'try', 'ferret', 'out', 'boy', 'whereabouts.A', 'detailed', 'sense', 'characterization', 'good', 'performances', 'strong', 'special', 'effects', 'frequent', 'innovation', 'have', 'amped', 'up', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'run-of-the-mill', 'tale', 'something', 'better', 'one', 'best', ""'classic"", 'mode', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'recently', 'time', 'sadly', 'under-seen', 'under-rated', 'horror', 'gem']",N/A

1104009,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000VSDNFA,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 5]","Skinwalkers translates to Yenal Dooshi in the Navajo Language. It refers to the Native American legend about human beings who have the supernatural ability to transform to any animal they wish. Other folklore from other parts of the world gives references to Lycans (Werewolves)- taken from the dictionarySKINWALKERS is directed by James Isaac and is very loosely based on the legendary folklore of Indian tribes. I didn't exactly hate ""Skinwalkers"" but I didn't exactly like it either. I was really disappointed that it didn't explore the Native American folklore that the title felt more like a marketing ""gimmick"" rather than a representation of its main premise. Too bad, there is so little information about those tales. The film is being directed by Isaac; after his definite misfire ""Jason X"" will definitely give the impression not to expect much, so I had to sit down with my popcorn on a very lazy afternoon at home.There is a struggle between two factions of cursed werewolves called ""Skinwalkers"". One side wants the curse to end while one-side embraces what they are. You guessed it; the good guys are actually Skinwalkers that avoid the lust for blood and the bad guys are the exact opposite with the bloodlust raging within. There's an ancient prophecy that a boy (played by Matthew Knight) will rise on his 13th birthday and end the curse. Skinwalkers who embrace the curse led by Varek (Jason Behr) will stop at nothing to kill him while the ones who want the curse to end led by Jonas (Elias Koteas) will do anything to protect him.Skinwalkers is NOT a horror film but rather an action film with ""horror"" elements. The film is a straight up werewolf movie WITHOUT any intricate storytelling or character development. Remember the good ol'days when horror films were a dime a dozen in the multiplexes? ""Skinwalkers"" follow the same formulas and clich&eacute;s, an ancient prophecy for two sides to fight upon, humans caught in the middle, a boy and his mother (in this case played by mega-babe Rhona Mitra), cheesy script and an anti-hero seeking closure. If you see this movie with the right expectations, you may be entertained. I guess it wouldn't be so bad if it only had one motive: to provide us with ""junk"" entertainment. However, most of the time the film tried to take itself seriously, I guess its main weakness is; the film lacked discipline.There is some decent action footages to be had with ""Skinwalkers"". Highlights include a decent gun battle in the middle of the town of Huguenot; (I know) I really wanted to laugh since it almost felt like a Robert Rodriguez (He rocks by the way) ""wanna-be inspired"" gunfight. I suppose it was its intention, as the movie also has a bad-a$$ chick who almost looked like a crossover between ""Planet Terror"" and ""Desperado"". (Played by hottie Natasha Malthe). How come ""bad"" skinwalkers have to ride Harleys and clad in the usual ""biker"" look while the ""good"" skinwalkers look like regular Joes in flannel shirts? The usual Hollywood stereotypes are present and I believe there is only one Native American person in the movie, which I found disappointing, since Skinwalkers is based on Indian folklore. There is also the mom versus monster and the monster versus monster face-offs, which is regrettably, doesn't offer anything new to the horror fan.As for the cast and script, well, the dialogue doesn't have any bad language, which is surprising for a film that wants to project an attitude. Elias Koteas actually steals the show as the boy's uncle (His character is the only one who carried any weight) and Rhona Mitra is the distraught mom who had no idea that her son is the ""messiah"" for the skinwalkers. The rest of the cast is so flat and the acting is wooden. Also, the added twist with Kaleb, the boy's father had the potential to turn things around but it wasn't developed well that it just felt like a poor attempt to add ""meat"" to the film's premise. To its credit at the very least, the supposed mystery behind the prophecy is not of the usual mystical nature with a red moon (I've seen an actual red moon) foretelling the boy's rise and I felt it had potential. The make-up EFX by Stan Winston is reminiscent of older werewolf flicks and offers nothing new. Did I already mention mega-babes; Rhona Mitra, Natasha Malthe and Sarah Carter? (They're worthy of an extra star)""Skinwalkers"" is a movie with a lot of inconsistencies with plot holes aplenty but one thing it just ISN'T is dull and boring. The overused plot elements and devices combined with the hollow dialogue do hurt the film. (Perhaps the use of bad language may have helped this film) I mean it's ok to make a cheesy fun horror flick but don't play with genres unless you know which direction you're going. I suppose it can be diverting for viewers with low expectations. I really wanted to like it but in the end, it comes so short of other great pure action-horror ""hybrids"" such as ""Dog Soldiers"", ""Vampires"" and ""From Dusk till Dawn"".""Skinwalkers"" is a movie that requires minimum use of our brains, just be ready to roll your eyes from time to time and sit down on your favorite chair to relax.RENTAL [2 - stars] a good rental on a lazy, rainy afternoon. (Like the day I saw it)I still think ""Catwoman"" is the only flick truly worthy of 1 star.VIDEO/AUDIO: The video transfer is exceptional, the colors are natural with very strong contrast and black levels.
