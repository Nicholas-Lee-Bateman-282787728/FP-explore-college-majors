549960,A2PD2XJPBCV975,B00004T2SI,"Aaron Cumberledge ""therealunno""","[11, 12]","I bought the DVD of Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins despite all the bad reviews given to it on Amazon.  And I have to say, I  was very impressed.  It's not Toy Story, OK?  Don't buy this expecting  that, cause you won't get it.  But it is a very witty, action packed movie,  with a few twists and turns that I doubt anyone would predict.  The  animation is far better quality than most Disney direct to video releases,  and some of the dialogue is great.  Zurg is one of the only humorous  villains that I have seen work on any movie.  Most usually come off just  looking goofy, but this movie really pulls it off.  And although Buzz's  character is slightly different from that of his Toy Story counterpart, he  is still very lovable.  Pretty much the only reason I gave it 4 stars was  the running time.  It's a bit short.  But all in all, it's well worth the  money, and I recommend it to everyone.  I wish I could hope for the series  to be this good, but the preview of it on the DVD makes it look like it  will be horrible.

549962,A3CSRP3P4U9HI,B00004T2SI,Alan R. Holyoak,"[10, 12]","Other reviewers have compared this direct-to-video offering with the likes  of Pokemon, etc.  Well, I think they hit the nail on the head!  Pokemon and  the like are, in my opinion, senseless, pointless efforts to market  products to children.  The shows themselves seem to have no real point  other than to engage in pointless violence and sell products.I have to  say that this video is 1/2 step up from Pokemon offerings.  At least Buzz  and his cohorts are out to defeat the forces of evil.  You have to admit  that's a good cause.  Still, this show played like what I'd imagine would  happen if the old &quot;Spaceghost&quot; met up with professional wrestling  of today.  Lots of action, and lots and lots of blasting.  Some of the  characters were OK, not too memorable.  There was ONE interesting plot  development though.The MAJOR saving grace of this video was the brief  PIXAR intro where Andy's toys struggle to get the new Buzz video into the  VCR.  Now THAT was classic -- the 2 stars in my review are primarily for  that alone.As for another reviewer's comment about how well their child  likes this BUZZ offering...of course a child will sit through it for  multiple viewings...if someone doesn't provide any parental direction.  A  case in point is that kids will also sit through Pokemon, Digemon, and all  other kinds of brainless offerings that are out there.  Let's face it...all  those kinds of things are is digital candy for kids.  That's exactly what  marketers are hoping for...that kids will eat it up, and then persuade  their parents to buy them related products.  I don't say that in judgement  of another parent, just as an observation of what most any child will do,  given the opportunity.My recommendation is that you put this video  toward the bottom of your &quot;need to watch&quot; list.  Not that there's  a whole lot wrong with it...it's just that there are so many better things  children could be watching.Good luck.Alan Holyoak",2,The best part was the introduction...,968716800,"09 12, 2000",2000,1970,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'compared', 'direct-to-video', 'offering', 'likes', 'Pokemon', 'etc', 'Well', 'think', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'Pokemon', 'like', 'are', 'opinion', 'senseless', 'pointless', 'efforts', 'market', 'products', 'children', 'shows', 'seem', 'have', 'real', 'point', 'other', 'engage', 'pointless', 'violence', 'sell', 'products.I', 'have', 'say', 'video', '1/2', 'step', 'up', 'Pokemon', 'offerings', 'least', 'Buzz', 'cohorts', 'are', 'defeat', 'forces', 'evil', 'have', 'admit', 'good', 'cause', 'Still', 'show', 'played', 'what', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'would', 'happen', 'old', 'quot', 'Spaceghost', 'quot', 'met', 'up', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'today', 'Lots', 'action', 'lots', 'lots', 'blasting', 'characters', 'were', 'OK', 'not', 'too', 'memorable', 'was', 'ONE', 'interesting', 'plot', 'development', 'though.The', 'MAJOR', 'saving', 'grace', 'video', 'was', 'brief', 'PIXAR', 'intro', 'where', 'Andy', 'toys', 'struggle', 'get', 'new', 'Buzz', 'video', 'VCR', 'Now', 'was', 'classic', '2', 'stars', 'review', 'are', 'primarily', 'alone.As', 'reviewer', 'comment', 'how', 'well', 'child', 'BUZZ', 'offering', 'course', 'child', 'will', 'sit', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'someone', ""n't"", 'provide', 'parental', 'direction', 'case', 'point', 'kids', 'will', 'also', 'sit', 'Pokemon', 'Digemon', 'other', 'kinds', 'brainless', 'offerings', 'are', 'there', 'Let', 'face', 'kinds', 'things', 'are', 'digital', 'candy', 'kids', 'exactly', 'what', 'marketers', 'are', 'hoping', 'kids', 'will', 'eat', 'up', 'then', 'persuade', 'parents', 'buy', 'related', 'products', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'judgement', 'parent', 'just', 'observation', 'what', 'most', 'child', 'will', 'do', 'given', 'opportunity.My', 'recommendation', 'put', 'video', 'bottom', 'quot', 'watch', 'quot', 'list', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'wrong', 'just', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'things', 'children', 'could', 'be', 'watching.Good', 'luck.Alan', 'Holyoak']",Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins VHS

We were reunited with him and his cowboy friend Woody (Tom Hanks) in 1999's  smash-hit &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;.  And now--in his very own  direct-to-video movie--Buzz Lightyear is far from good.In &quot;Buzz  Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins&quot;, we are caught up  with space hero after Andy's toys from &quot;Toy Story&quot; insert the  video into the VCR.  This Pixar short is very well done, and is the most  enjoyable part of the film (explaining the first star).  After it, we are  plunged into the world of Star Command and the evil Emprorer Zurg.  Sadly,  this is all too plain--no Pixar involvement here.  The movie lacks good  visual effects because of this, and it is the most bitter disappointment.  What happened to the billrant visuials that brought ADULTS flocking into  &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;? STRIKE ONE!The plot  here, too, is very stupid, and does not encourage thinking.  Zurg steals  the Unimind from the Little Green Men's home plannet, and tips Star  Command's balanced working system. After doing this, he uses the Unimined  (now turned from good to evil) to control every plannet in the galaxy.  This plot is not only stupid, but is recycled, and has been used countless  times before.  STRIKE TWO!To make things even worse, if that's possible,  is the fact that Buzz's personality has been changed entirely.  What  happened to the gentel Buzz from &quot;Toy Story&quot;?  Now, all he is is  some idiled superhero who fights evil with ZAP! and WHAM!  This isn't the  Buzz I knew.  STRIKE THREE!The only good thing here is that ONE new  character has heart--Princess Nova, who (I think) echos Jessie the  Cowgirl's (from &quot;Toy Story 2)personality and viewpoints and walks in  her footsteps.

Hey, it IS a hard choice, and maybe the country is split 50/50, but I think I'm in the Buzz Lightyear half. Though like I said, it's a tough choice. Anyways, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is clear that it is merely a TV series pilot. What I mean is, most of this film is about introducing the characters you'll see on the show, setting up the situation for this upcoming situation comedy and all that. Now the show is out there, heck, it might even be off already, I'll have to check one of these Saturday mornings, but I watched it when I could, got several episodes on tape, and it was hilarious! On this DVD Tim Allen once again plays the voice of Buzz, but on the actual series the role was taken over by Patrick Warburton (The Tick, Kronk from the Emperor's New Groove, and Putty from Seinfeld). At first this bothered me, but eventually I grew to prefer his version of Buzz to Tim Allen's! Anyway, this is not important since the DVD uses Allen, so back to the DVD. As I said, it's about introducing the characters, but there IS a story involved. Here we get to see what Buzz is really all about. We get to see Evil Emperor Zurg, what it means to be a Space Ranger, and so on and so forth. It's all GREAT to a real Toy Story fan, but keep in mind that this is not Toy Story, it's not computer animation and the Toy Story gang only appear at the beginning to &quot;introduce&quot; the movie, or rather, to put it in their VCR and start watching it. The charcters here are Buzz, the huge, childlike Booster, XR the fast talking robot (who is the funniest character on the show), and the lovely Mira Nova. All the characters together do remind you a bit of the cast of Seinfeld, and some of them A LOT, especially Mira Nova. The story on this pilot episode is a bit less interesting than the show, and less funny, but it's still a must have and very entertaining. The DVD has some nice extras, including some cool games. I only hope more of this great show is released on DVD. Preferably all of it, though they rarely do that with American animation. I'd at least like to see more of these pilot episodes released, like the outstanding Duck Tales pilot, and the pilots for Tale Spin and Chip 'N' Dale's Rescue Rangers, Darkwing Duck, Bonkers, Goof Troop, etc...All these great Disney animated TV shows need to get DVD releases.",4,The movie that HAD to be made!!!,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,2436,"['DVD', 'MUST', 'fans', 'Toy', 'Story', 'especially', 'who', 'like', 'Buzz', 'more', 'Woody', 'Hey', 'hard', 'choice', 'maybe', 'country', 'split', '50/50', 'think', ""'m"", 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'half', 'said', 'tough', 'choice', 'Anyways', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'clear', 'merely', 'TV', 'series', 'pilot', 'What', 'mean', 'most', 'film', 'introducing', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'see', 'show', 'setting', 'up', 'situation', 'upcoming', 'situation', 'comedy', 'Now', 'show', 'there', 'heck', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'off', 'already', ""'ll"", 'have', 'check', 'one', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'watched', 'when', 'could', 'got', 'several', 'episodes', 'tape', 'was', 'hilarious', 'DVD', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'once', 'again', 'voice', 'Buzz', 'actual', 'series', 'role', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'Tick', 'Kronk', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'Putty', 'Seinfeld', 'first', 'bothered', 'eventually', 'grew', 'prefer', 'version', 'Buzz', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Anyway', 'not', 'important', 'DVD', 'Allen', 'so', 'back', 'DVD', 'said', 'introducing', 'characters', 'story', 'involved', 'Here', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'Buzz', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'Evil', 'Emperor', 'Zurg', 'what', 'be', 'Space', 'Ranger', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'GREAT', 'real', 'Toy', 'Story', 'fan', 'keep', 'mind', 'not', 'Toy', 'Story', 'not', 'computer', 'animation', 'Toy', 'Story', 'gang', 'only', 'appear', 'beginning', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'rather', 'put', 'VCR', 'start', 'watching', 'charcters', 'here', 'are', 'Buzz', 'huge', 'childlike', 'Booster', 'fast', 'talking', 'robot', 'who', 'funniest', 'character', 'show', 'lovely', 'Mira', 'Nova', 'characters', 'together', 'do', 'remind', 'bit', 'cast', 'Seinfeld', 'LOT', 'especially', 'Mira', 'Nova', 'story', 'pilot', 'episode', 'bit', 'less', 'interesting', 'show', 'less', 'funny', 'still', 'must', 'have', 'very', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', 'cool', 'games', 'only', 'hope', 'more', 'great', 'show', 'released', 'DVD', 'Preferably', 'rarely', 'do', 'American', 'animation', ""'d"", 'least', 'see', 'more', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'released', 'outstanding', 'Duck', 'Tales', 'pilot', 'pilots', 'Tale', 'Spin', 'Chip', 'N', 'Dale', 'Rescue', 'Rangers', 'Darkwing', 'Duck', 'Bonkers', 'Goof', 'Troop', 'etc', 'great', 'Disney', 'animated', 'TV', 'shows', 'need', 'get', 'DVD', 'releases']",Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins VHS
