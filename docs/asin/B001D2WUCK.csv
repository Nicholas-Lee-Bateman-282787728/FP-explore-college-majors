This is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  I remember seeing it one day at like 1 in the morning and the squiggle of the lines made me sick.  But as I watched it I got used to it and soon came to think of it as one of my favorites.  Plus the squiggles went awa in the second season I think.  The humor stayed though.Some may ask why?  Why buy it if you already have the seasons by themselves?  Well I collect cartoon stuff.  I am only 23 and just started but I know that this will be a great collection to add.  The exrta stuff in the set is worth buying it for alone.  Even the case that it all comes in.  Also, the soundtrack is a cool thing to add.In the end it comes down to this.  I think any fan of Home Movies will like this set for any or all of the reasons I have listed above.  Plus it is SUCH a good price!",5,From squigle vision to straight in a single bound!,1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,902,"['Well', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'yet', 'still', 'however', 'am', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'remember', 'seeing', 'one', 'day', '1', 'morning', 'squiggle', 'lines', 'made', 'sick', 'watched', 'got', 'used', 'soon', 'came', 'think', 'one', 'favorites', 'squiggles', 'went', 'awa', 'second', 'season', 'think', 'humor', 'stayed', 'though.Some', 'may', 'ask', 'why', 'Why', 'buy', 'already', 'have', 'seasons', 'Well', 'collect', 'cartoon', 'stuff', 'am', 'only', '23', 'just', 'started', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'collection', 'add', 'exrta', 'stuff', 'set', 'worth', 'buying', 'alone', 'Even', 'case', 'Also', 'soundtrack', 'cool', 'thing', 'add.In', 'end', 'down', 'think', 'fan', 'Home', 'Movies', 'will', 'like', 'set', 'reasons', 'have', 'listed', 'good', 'price']",Home Movies 10th Anniversary Set
