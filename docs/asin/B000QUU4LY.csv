1077640,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B000QUU4LY,D. A. Reed,"[0, 0]","Sister Act- The funniest out of the two. In a day and age where most plots are old hat, this is a bit refreshing (though done in 1992). Like The Blues Brothers (who make an almost impossible to see cameo at the end), this isn't a traditional musical in the sense that the songs advance the plot. Instead, Motown hits of the 60s are redone to be more Gospel-esque. Whoopi Goldberg is hilarious as Deloris, some of my favorite moments with her are the dinner scene, when she's trying to fit into convent life and at the bar. Kathy Najimy has always been one of my favorites ever since I saw her in Hocus Pocus. Like Goldberg and Mary Wickes (I love her deadpan wit), hers are the funnier moments of the film. Her perkiness is what makes the character funny, especially her scenes at the bar and during the montage. Wendy Makkena is good as the young Mary Robert and I used to love that her character really comes into her own voice but then I was disappointed that she was dubbed for her performances. Maggie Smith's Mother Superior is also another character that experiences change. From her hermit, tradition holdings stance at the beginning to actually caring about Deloris to risk her life to save her in the end is touching. Harvey Keitel is pretty much your basic Italian mob boss. Other than that, I really have no problems with this otherwise uplifting funny movie. Can't believe they made a stage show based on this. Oh well, can't be any worse than any of the Disney adaptations. 5 stars.Sister Act II: Back in the Habit- Though a favorite, it doesn't rank as high as the first. I give it credit for being original but a few things were plot points taken directly from the first, like Mary Clarence teaching a student to sing louder. Sound familiar? At least there is a different ending than the first, though the ending is rather predictable if you've seen ""underdog"" films. The return cast members still have the same chemistry that made the original memorable. The younger cast is again my problem. There are just too many teen actors. You have the main ones, who are good singers and have on-again, off-again good acting. Look for a very young Jennifer Love Hewitt (in the credits, Love has """" around it). The songs are great, the ones featuring the younger cast are given a hip-hop/rap edge to them. The opening song is one of the longest-medley's I've heard comprising of several recognizable songs (including two from the first). Aretha Franklin's hit song A Deeper Love is featured during the end credits. A worthy follow-up and thankfully (hopefully is probably a better word) there won't be Sister Act III because I don't know how they could pull that off. 4 stars.",5,Heavenly,1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,2683,"['Sister', 'Act-', 'funniest', 'two', 'day', 'age', 'where', 'most', 'plots', 'are', 'old', 'hat', 'bit', 'refreshing', 'done', '1992', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'who', 'make', 'almost', 'impossible', 'see', 'cameo', 'end', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'musical', 'sense', 'songs', 'plot', 'Instead', 'Motown', 'hits', '60s', 'are', 'redone', 'be', 'more', 'Gospel-esque', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'hilarious', 'Deloris', 'favorite', 'moments', 'are', 'dinner', 'scene', 'when', 'trying', 'fit', 'convent', 'life', 'bar', 'Kathy', 'Najimy', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'ever', 'saw', 'Hocus', 'Pocus', 'Goldberg', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'love', 'deadpan', 'wit', 'hers', 'are', 'funnier', 'moments', 'film', 'perkiness', 'what', 'character', 'funny', 'especially', 'scenes', 'bar', 'montage', 'Wendy', 'Makkena', 'good', 'young', 'Mary', 'Robert', 'used', 'love', 'character', 'really', 'own', 'voice', 'then', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'dubbed', 'performances', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'also', 'character', 'change', 'hermit', 'tradition', 'holdings', 'stance', 'beginning', 'actually', 'caring', 'Deloris', 'risk', 'life', 'save', 'end', 'touching', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'pretty', 'much', 'basic', 'Italian', 'mob', 'boss', 'Other', 'really', 'have', 'problems', 'otherwise', 'uplifting', 'funny', 'movie', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'made', 'stage', 'show', 'based', 'Oh', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'Disney', 'adaptations', '5', 'stars.Sister', 'Act', 'II', 'Back', 'Habit-', 'Though', 'favorite', ""n't"", 'rank', 'as', 'high', 'first', 'give', 'credit', 'being', 'original', 'few', 'things', 'were', 'plot', 'points', 'taken', 'directly', 'first', 'Mary', 'Clarence', 'teaching', 'student', 'sing', 'louder', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'least', 'different', 'ending', 'first', 'ending', 'rather', 'predictable', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'underdog', 'films', 'return', 'cast', 'members', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'chemistry', 'made', 'original', 'memorable', 'younger', 'cast', 'again', 'problem', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'teen', 'actors', 'have', 'main', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'singers', 'have', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'good', 'acting', 'Look', 'very', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'credits', 'Love', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'ones', 'featuring', 'younger', 'cast', 'are', 'given', 'hip-hop/rap', 'edge', 'opening', 'song', 'one', 'longest-medley', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'comprising', 'several', 'recognizable', 'songs', 'including', 'two', 'first', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'hit', 'song', 'Deeper', 'Love', 'featured', 'end', 'credits', 'worthy', 'follow-up', 'thankfully', 'hopefully', 'probably', 'better', 'word', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Sister', 'Act', 'III', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'could', 'pull', 'off', '4', 'stars']",N/A

1077644,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000QUU4LY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","The '90s was an excellent decade for comedienne and actress Whoopi Goldberg.From her award winning performance in ""Ghost"" (1990) and a fan favorite in the sci-fi syndicated TV series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", Whoopi Goldberg was one of the busiest actresses on the big screen.And if there was one film that Whoopi Goldberg would remembered for, it's her lead performance in the role of Deloris Van Cartier and Sister Mary Clarence in the 1992 film ""Sister Act"".The film which was budgeted at $24 million would go on to earn over $231 million.  And the success of the film would ensure a sequel the following year with ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"".  A comedy film that would bring back the talents from the first film but also feature the major film debut of R&B; singer Lauryn Hill and actress Jennifer Love Hewitt.And now to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ""Sister Act"", Touchstone Home Entertainment have released both films together on Blu-ray.VIDEO:""Sister Act"" and ""Sister Act 2: Back in Habit"" are presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1). For the most part, the upgraded HD transfer looks very good, especially compared to the original DVD release which now shows its age.  Colors are warm, skintones are natural, black levels are very good and deep.  But for the most part, there is much more clarity in the film.  From Whoopi Goldberg's bigger, fluffier hair to the close ups of the characters, the video quality is very good and there is a fine layer of grain present, very clean and saw no banding, edge enhancement or any video problems during my viewing of both films.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Sister Act"" and ""Sister Act 2: Back in Habit"" are presented in Engish 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  It's important for people to know that the film is primarily dialogue and music driven.  Dialogue is clear, as with the music.  ""Sister Act 2: Back in Habit"" tends to use more bass beats but I didn't really notice too much surround channel use only ambiance when crowds are seen.  But for these two comedy films, the lossless soundtrack was appropriate.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Sister Act: 20th Anniversary Edition/Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit "" comes with the DVD version of ""Sister Act"" and ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"".  As for special features, the Blu-ray release comes with:Inside Sister Act - (12:30) Interview with Director Emile Ardolino and the cast of ""Sister Act"".""If My Sister's In Trouble"" by Lady Soul - (3:59) Music Video by Lady Soul""I Will Follow Him"" by Deloris and the Sisters - This is only featured on the included VD of ""Sister Act"".JUDGMENT CALL:A hilarious, fun '90s comedy starring Whoopi Goldberg. ""Sister Act"" is probably a comedy film that the comedienne and actress will be forever remembered by.For those who grew up during this time period, Whoopi Goldberg was one of the top actresses and as a fan of Goldberg, I was following her comedy routines, her role on ""Star Trek: The Next Genertion"" and also her films (yes, including ""Jumping Jack Flash"").  But when ""Sister Act"" came out in theaters, it was a big hit!  In fact, you would see the singing nuns performing on various shows and suffice to say, the film propelled Goldberg's career as an actress, but showing that she can be a profitable lead actress.The first film was absolutely entertaining as Goldberg played the character of Deloris, who has a difficult time adapting to the rules of the Mother Superior at the church for her witness protection program and you know that her character of Deloris/Sister Mary Clarence will get into trouble...that is until she is able to interject some of her music skill and vibrancy to the choir.  The supporting characters are equally fun, from the fun, high-spirit Mary Patrick or the very shy Mary Robert or the very dry but blunt Sister Mary Lazarus.And the choir are literally the underdogs and you can't help but root for the underdogs as this choir that can't sign a tune, is suddenly transformed to a choir with so much synergy and energy that you want to see them succeed.But of course, aside from the choir storyline, you have the well-cast Harvey Keitel playing the mob boss Vince LaRocca and what better person to play the mob role!So, while the first film was exciting, hilarious and a lot of fun to watch.  The second film tried to repeat the same synergy to a group of unruly teenagers.  Unfortunately, that is when the story faces the typical '80s and '90s banality of teacher tries to help undisciplined teenagers.  Granted, the concept of the storyline is not about underprivileged or unruly youths, but these are a bunch of kids who have musical talent.  They just need a leader to hone that talent and that is where sister Mary Clarence comes along.While ""Sister Act"" is a comedy film that is timeless, because the ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" relies on teenagers of that time era and the of love hip-hop and music of that era, the music featured has a very early '90s feel that pretty much dates the film.But I will say that for many who were fans of music artist Lauryn Hill, this is her major film debut, as with actress Jennifer Love Hewitt.And while ""Sister Act"" retains its humor and comedy and that extra mob drama built into the storyline, ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" feels like watching an episode of ""Glee"" and seeing if these teenagers can win the state choir tournament and while enjoyable, the writing was not as strong as the first film.As for the Blu-ray release, the 20th anniversary of ""Sister Act"" brings us both films to HD via Blu-ray.  And for fans of the film, the upgrade will be worth it.  Although there are no new special features included in this 20th Anniversary release.  But as an extra incentive, you do get the DVD's of both films included with the Blu-ray release.Overall, ""Sister Act: 20th Anniversary Edition/Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" is a fun comedy release featuring the best Whoopi Goldberg comedy film!  While the first film was hilarious and fun and its humor manages to hold up two decades later, the second film was good but not as entertaining as the first film.  But the fact that both films are included together in the Blu-ray release makes it a much more appealing.",4,Blu-ray: Hilarious and fun! 2 films for the price of 1!,1354147200,"11 29,

(Also check outNunsenseand its sequel, with Rue McClanahan, for more Catholic humor.)I always thought Whoopi Goldberg made a great spontaneous nun, trying to fit in and trying to get away at the same time. Kathy Najimy as the overeager, happy sidekick was so much fun! Maggie Smith as the mean Mother Superior who didn't know what to make of her new charge intrigued me. This was before she was Professor McGonagall in Harry Potter and I was inspired to check out some of her older work from when she was young and had bigger roles.Of course, I don't even need to mention the music.

When she was talked into hiding out at the convent, the action slowed down a little, though certain parts were funny, such as when she, and Sisters Mary Patrick and Mary Robert entered a bar. However, the action took  off when she became head of the choir and introduced a bit of deep shoulder action to the nuns. Out of respect for those who still have not seen this movie, I won't say more about the contents. The DVD, which I bought in a set with the sequel Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, it played beautifully with no pausing as sometimes happens. It was very easy to remove the disk from its holder and replace after viewing the disk.

1077710,A37NL9EDUT23IV,B000QUU4LY,"takemehome ""Joey""","[62, 70]","It seems as though lately, nearly all movie studios are jumping onto a new trend in DVD releases - double, triple, even quadruple features which consist of taking ever-so-slightly related catalogue DVD releases and packaging them together. These are executed in several ways, ranging from simply packaging existing DVDs together, in the case of Buena Vista Home Entertainment's releases, or putting existing DVDs onto flippers, in the case of some of Warner Bros.' releases. Some sets put all the DVDs into one case, while others use a box with slim DVD cases inside. No matter how they're executed, these sets can usually be found for fifteen dollars or less in stores such as Wal Mart.On one hand, I kinda like this trend. It's a great value for your dollar, and who isn't looking for THAT these days? On the other hand, I feel like if they're going to do this, they could update some of these DVDs.Take this Sister Act 2-Movie Collection DVD. I picked this up because I LOVE these movies. Love love love. And for less than fifteen dollars, it's a great value. However, I'd have liked to see Touchstone Home Entertainment make this set with new DVD editions.Both DVDs feature non-anamorphic widescreen transfers likely taken from laserdisc masters. Both are fairly good and clean, but brand new anamorphic digital transfers would have been much better. Both DVDs feature a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround English track and a French language track and the film's original theatrical trailer. The first film's DVD also includes a making-of featurette and two music videos.What Touchstone could have done was make a new 2-Disc set with new Special Edition DVDs of both films. They could have included new anamorphic digital transfers, new making-of featurettes for both films where cast and crew members could look back on the films and their success, new audio commentaries from cast and crew, music-only audio tracks, and other such bonus materials which would have made this an amazing set.Despite these flaws, I can't really NOT recommend this DVD set to fans of the Sister Act films. If you only enjoy one or the other, you're better off getting the one film you enjoy on DVD by itself. However, if you're a fan of both films, like I am, this is the best value, and will save you some shelf space to boot.",3,"Great movies, but new DVD editions are sorely needed.",1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,2304,"['lately', 'nearly', 'movie', 'studios', 'are', 'jumping', 'new', 'trend', 'DVD', 'double', 'triple', 'even', 'quadruple', 'features', 'consist', 'taking', 'ever-so-slightly', 'related', 'catalogue', 'DVD', 'releases', 'packaging', 'together', 'are', 'executed', 'several', 'ways', 'ranging', 'simply', 'packaging', 'existing', 'DVDs', 'together', 'case', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'releases', 'putting', 'existing', 'DVDs', 'flippers', 'case', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'releases', 'sets', 'put', 'DVDs', 'one', 'case', 'others', 'use', 'box', 'slim', 'DVD', 'cases', 'inside', 'No', 'matter', 'how', ""'re"", 'executed', 'sets', 'can', 'usually', 'be', 'found', 'fifteen', 'dollars', 'less', 'stores', 'such', 'Wal', 'Mart.On', 'one', 'hand', 'kinda', 'trend', 'great', 'value', 'dollar', 'who', ""n't"", 'looking', 'THAT', 'days', 'other', 'hand', 'feel', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'could', 'update', 'DVDs.Take', 'Sister', 'Act', '2-Movie', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'picked', 'LOVE', 'movies', 'Love', 'love', 'love', 'less', 'fifteen', 'dollars', 'great', 'value', 'However', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Touchstone', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'make', 'set', 'new', 'DVD', 'DVDs', 'feature', 'non-anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'transfers', 'likely', 'taken', 'laserdisc', 'masters', 'are', 'fairly', 'good', 'clean', 'brand', 'new', 'anamorphic', 'digital', 'transfers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'DVDs', 'feature', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'English', 'track', 'French', 'language', 'track', 'film', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'first', 'film', 'DVD', 'also', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'two', 'music', 'Touchstone', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'make', 'new', '2-Disc', 'set', 'new', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVDs', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'new', 'anamorphic', 'digital', 'transfers', 'new', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'films', 'where', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'could', 'look', 'back', 'films', 'success', 'new', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'crew', 'music-only', 'audio', 'tracks', 'other', 'such', 'bonus', 'materials', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'amazing', 'set.Despite', 'flaws', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'fans', 'Sister', 'Act', 'films', 'only', 'enjoy', 'one', 'other', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'getting', 'one', 'film', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'However', ""'re"", 'fan', 'films', 'am', 'best', 'value', 'will', 'save', 'space', 'boot']",N/A
