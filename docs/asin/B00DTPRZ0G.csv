1661227,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00DTPRZ0G,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","Curse Of Chucky (2013), directed by Don Mancini. 95 minutes (unrated cut: 97 minutes)Plot:Proving that you just can't keep a Good Guy down, everyone's favorite homicidal maniac-trapped-inside-of-a-doll, Chucky (voiced by the indispensable Brad Dourif), has returned for more shenanigans in ""Curse Of Chucky."" This time he's landed in the lap of wheelchair-bound Nica (Fiona Dourif), herself hosting a houseful of grief-stricken family members. In an all-too-familiar fashion, members of her family start mysteriously dying in a variety of grisly ways, casting suspicion on the little red-headed chunk of plastic in the corner with a vacant stare and an inexplicable grin splashed across his face. As the clock winds down and the body count rises, Nica is in for a number of surprises, as are fans of the ""Child's Play"" franchise. Friends 'til the end indeed.Writing and Directing:In the wake of 2004's ultra-meta ""Seed Of Chucky,"" writer/director Don Mancini keeps the plot clean and clutter-free with ""Curse,"" letting the tension and bloodshed do most of the speaking. To that end, the film is more horror than comedy, calling back to the Tom Holland-helmed cult-classic that made us all so paranoid of Cabbage Patch Kids and their ilk 25 years ago (!). Mancini, who has written every single on of these films to date (and directed ""Seed""), has his finger firmly on the pulse of what his fanbase wants and delivers in spades. You want a more stripped-down flick where Chucky returns to his patented brand of sneaky slaughter? You got it. Do you want references and call-backs to film's past that will put a smile on your face? You get that too. Just make sure you watch the WHOLE feature. Franchise politics aside, Mancini does an excellent job of squeezing as much atmosphere out of his set-pieces as possible with a limited budget. The film looks and feels like a theatrical release, when it was clearly intended as a direct-to-video affair from the get-go.Cast:Fiona Dourif is a revelation as Nica. A regular chip off the old block, Fiona resembles her dad not only on the surface, but also in her ability to effortlessly pull off a complex character with limited means. Hopefully we will be seeing more of her in the future. The man himself, Brad Dourif, gets a significant amount of screen-time not as Chucky (who barely utters a line until half-way through the movie) but as Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler from way-back. We are treated to a great deal of flashbacks that wrap around nicely with the franchise's origins, and not only does Dourif still look the part, he gleefully embodies the role with all the necessary venom and vigor. The rest of the cast is serviceable if forgettable by comparison, barring a few 11th hour cameos that will have any fanboy (or girl) clamoring for more.Music:Joseph LoDuca's score works well for the most part, but can get a bit cumbersome in its final act. It's a far cry from the Graeme Revell and Pino Dinaggio works of yesteryear (or even the heavy metal assault of ""Bride Of Chucky""), but it gets the job done.The Bottom Line(s):""Curse Of Chucky"" is, in many ways, everything a fan could want from a sixth ""Child's Play"" flick. Mancini knows this franchise better than anyone else, so trust that you are in good hands. Relax, close your blinds and put your toys away. Chucky's back.Lesson Learned:Never accept large parcels with no return-address, lest you be supplied with a shotgun and plenty of ammunition.",4,Curse is a Blessing,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,3477,"['Curse', 'Chucky', '2013', 'directed', 'Don', 'Mancini', '95', 'minutes', 'unrated', 'cut', '97', 'minutes', 'Plot', 'Proving', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'Good', 'Guy', 'down', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'homicidal', 'maniac-trapped-inside-of-a-doll', 'Chucky', 'voiced', 'indispensable', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'returned', 'more', 'shenanigans', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'time', 'landed', 'lap', 'wheelchair-bound', 'Nica', 'Fiona', 'Dourif', 'hosting', 'houseful', 'grief-stricken', 'family', 'members', 'all-too-familiar', 'fashion', 'members', 'family', 'start', 'mysteriously', 'dying', 'variety', 'grisly', 'ways', 'casting', 'suspicion', 'little', 'red-headed', 'chunk', 'plastic', 'corner', 'vacant', 'stare', 'inexplicable', 'grin', 'splashed', 'face', 'clock', 'down', 'body', 'count', 'Nica', 'number', 'surprises', 'are', 'fans', 'Child', 'Play', 'franchise', 'Friends', 'end', 'indeed.Writing', 'Directing', 'wake', '2004', 'ultra-meta', 'Seed', 'Chucky', 'writer/director', 'Don', 'Mancini', 'plot', 'clean', 'clutter-free', 'Curse', 'letting', 'tension', 'bloodshed', 'do', 'most', 'speaking', 'end', 'film', 'more', 'horror', 'comedy', 'calling', 'back', 'Tom', 'Holland-helmed', 'cult-classic', 'made', 'so', 'paranoid', 'Cabbage', 'Patch', 'Kids', 'ilk', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'Mancini', 'who', 'written', 'single', 'films', 'date', 'directed', 'Seed', 'finger', 'firmly', 'pulse', 'what', 'fanbase', 'delivers', 'spades', 'want', 'more', 'stripped-down', 'flick', 'where', 'Chucky', 'patented', 'brand', 'sneaky', 'slaughter', 'got', 'Do', 'want', 'references', 'call-backs', 'film', 'past', 'will', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'get', 'too', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'WHOLE', 'feature', 'Franchise', 'politics', 'aside', 'Mancini', 'excellent', 'job', 'squeezing', 'much', 'set-pieces', 'possible', 'limited', 'budget', 'film', 'looks', 'feels', 'theatrical', 'release', 'when', 'was', 'clearly', 'intended', 'direct-to-video', 'affair', 'get-go.Cast', 'Fiona', 'Dourif', 'revelation', 'Nica', 'regular', 'chip', 'old', 'block', 'Fiona', 'dad', 'not', 'only', 'surface', 'also', 'ability', 'effortlessly', 'pull', 'off', 'complex', 'character', 'limited', 'means', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'more', 'future', 'man', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'significant', 'amount', 'screen-time', 'not', 'Chucky', 'who', 'barely', 'line', 'half-way', 'movie', 'Charles', 'Lee', 'Ray', 'notorious', 'Lakeshore', 'Strangler', 'way-back', 'are', 'treated', 'great', 'deal', 'flashbacks', 'wrap', 'nicely', 'franchise', 'origins', 'not', 'only', 'Dourif', 'still', 'look', 'part', 'gleefully', 'role', 'necessary', 'venom', 'vigor', 'rest', 'cast', 'serviceable', 'forgettable', 'comparison', 'barring', 'few', '11th', 'hour', 'cameos', 'will', 'have', 'fanboy', 'girl', 'clamoring', 'more.Music', 'Joseph', 'LoDuca', 'score', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'cumbersome', 'final', 'act', 'far', 'cry', 'Graeme', 'Revell', 'Pino', 'Dinaggio', 'works', 'yesteryear', 'even', 'heavy', 'metal', 'assault', 'Bride', 'Chucky', 'job', 'done.The', 'Bottom', 'Line', 's', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'many', 'ways', 'everything', 'fan', 'could', 'want', 'sixth', 'Child', 'Play', 'flick', 'Mancini', 'franchise', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'so', 'trust', 'are', 'good', 'hands', 'Relax', 'close', 'blinds', 'put', 'toys', 'away', 'Chucky', 'back.Lesson', 'Learned', 'Never', 'accept', 'large', 'parcels', 'return-address', 'be', 'supplied', 'shotgun', 'plenty', 'ammunition']",N/A

Chucky was a scary looking doll and a scary enough concept -- until the movies overexposed him, that is. Unfortunately, I feel they played their hand early in the series, even from the so-so first film. The rest devolved into hastily thrown together Z-grade horror movies that weren't worth a first look, let alone a second.Still, with a longer amount of time passed and the promise of a reboot, I was willing to give this a chance. And boy, I'm glad I did!The filmmakers wisely keep Chucky quiet for a good portion of the film. When he finally makes his presence fully known, the mayhem is more capably handled with just the right balance of humor, gore, and surprises. It's inspired storytelling for a series that seldom was.

Well, in this particular case, Curse of Chucky happened.Let me start off by saying that I was really excited for this movie. Like, REALLY excited. About five minutes into the movie, my excitement was running low, and by the half-hour mark, I was lost.**FROM HERE ON IN, THERE ARE SPOILERS... ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK**Let me first discuss what`s wrong with this movie (brace yourself)There are no really likeable characters. In the first three movies, it was Andy Barclay. You could have sympathy for that kid, man. In Bride and Seed, there were people you cared about as well, but when it comes to Curse... I didn`t care who died, who lived, and if they all died in the end.They gave Chucky a new look... I`m sure that`s the first thing everyone noticed about the movie. They gave him a new look, and now he looks like a GIRL. They should keep him looking like the original Child`s Play Chucky... no more changing his appearance!The maid was a lesbian... and with her employer! That isn`t something I would have expected from Chucky; it hasn`t been done in any of the other movies. And if they were paying any attention, they would have realized that by adding homosexuality into the movie (it wasn`t even relevant to the plot, a few minutes of almost pornography) was going to ruin it. I mean, look at Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2... don`t even go there.... never mind...They made the movie so confusing with people just coming into the movie and disappearing for long enough for us to completely forget about them (they are all forgettable anyway).Now, I`ll point out what`s good:We get a nice flashback to Charles Lee Ray, and we see his relationship with the family in the film.Despite the multiple flaws, it IS Chucky.Fiona Dourif (Brad`s daughter) is in this movie. Can you imagine the memories she would have... telling her kids her father tried to kill her when his soul was in a doll?So, it has it`s flaws and it`s positives... but in the end, Curse of Chucky is a rotten finale to the series.

1661235,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00DTPRZ0G,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 1]","After the off the rails hot mess that was ""Seed Of Chucky"", one wondered where in the world the series could go next. Thankfully, writer-director Don Mancini decided it had to go back to it's roots. Thank god. Thus, ""Curse Of Chucky"" is a return to form, and wipes away the bitter taste 'Seed' left in our mouths.The movie follows Nica (Fiona Dourif, daughter of Brad Dourif), a young woman confined to a wheelchair and living with her mother in a big, gothic house. A suspicious package arrives at the house carrying everyone's favorite sadistic doll. Where did it come from? Who sent it? Why them? After a tragedy, Nica's sister, brother in law, niece and a nanny come to the house, where strange things start happening and Chucky is back doing what he does best.Going back to it's roots, ""Curse Of Chucky"" is a much darker and serious in tone film than it's two predecessors. Chucky himself is sadisitc and demented here, but he still gets to deliver some of his trademark perverse comical lines. Working with a limited budget, the movie is based mainly at one location, so director Mancini has to do his best to make the most of it and make it interesting to keep the viewer interested. There are some nice visuals, angles, and Mancini does some old school horror shots here to keep things alive. He has to, as Chucky doesn't even really get going until the 50 minute mark. There is a lot of build up and suspense. A lot of Chucky sitting there and disappearing and people wondering if what they saw out of the corner of their eye was real or not. It does a decent job of setting the mood and setting Chucky up to finally start delivering. We don't even hear Chucky talk until almost 45 minutes into the movie. There are times when the movie gets a little boring and isn't as exciting as other entries in the series, but the pros outweigh the cons. What are some of the cons? It's a little sluggish here and there, and some of the effects of Chucky were lacking. Chucky looks different here and it's not really for the good. I am not a fan of CGI in Chucky's face either, but it's here. There are moments where he looks like Chucky, and the next moment he doesn't. It's odd.Cast-wise, Fiona Dourif is lovely and brings a more interesting and complex heroine to the genre. The supporting cast all do fine with their roles, but it still comes down to Brad Dourif. He also gets some screen time (which I won't go into, although other reviews on here spill everything) which is really cool, but he has not missed a step in voicing Chucky in the 9 years since the last film. That voice is Chucky, and it wouldn't be the same without him.Other reviews here have spilled some of the surprises in the movie(and some without warning!), but I certainly won't if you haven't read any. What I will say is that Mancini ties in things to the past films. He hasn't forgotten any of them as there are references and visuals. The last 10-15 minutes are cool and a treat to long time fans. Also, you must stay AFTER the end credits for a few minutes of new stuff that includes a wonderful,long time coming cameo. It's not a high body count, but there is some blood and gore, although it's not excessive or in your face.In the end, ""Curse Of Chucky"" wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be, but it was still a good, solid film that erases the lingering memory of 'Seed'. It's not the greatest film in the series, as I prefer the 1988 original, Part 2, and 'Bride' much more, but it's Chucky back being the Chucky we remember from the first film, and it has a number of references and treats for fans of the series. It's also a great looking film for a low budget, direct to DVD movie.

Rented the movie, popped it into the DVD player and became overwhelming disappointed.As you can tell by watching the previews, the dolls have been altered. Chucky is redone and looks different, no complaints from me. However, the story line starts off with a young girl who is wheelchair bound and her mother living together. The mother received a mysterious package that contains a good guy doll. The mother is found dead the next morning, the young girl's sister and her husband, child and nanny come to visit due to the mother's death.The sister is having a affair with the nanny and the husband is just stupid. The child is now Chucky's best buddy and attaches to the doll instantly.After everyone is slathered leaving the wheelchair bound girl fighting for her life it is discovered that Chucky when he was in his human body was a friend of the family or I guess, because this part of the movie was never fully explained.All and all this movie sucks..

Others have touted it as being boring, but I don&#8217;t see it that way at all.

It featured Jennifer Tilly in a perfectly realized comedic performance. With Seed of Chucky, Chucky had become something of a joke and was no longer scary. So returning the franchise back to its horror roots and taking a more serious approach to the material was a smart idea.While I applaud their decision to take the material more seriously, Curse of Chucky, unfortunately, just doesn't understand how to craft suspense and terror. They have a Gothic mansion. It takes place during a thunder storm. The villain of the film is a possessed doll and there is something inherently creepy about dolls to begin with. So they have the foundation for what could have been a scary film in place.The problem with Curse of Chucky is that almost all of its suspense is so far telegraphed in advance, that you can see it coming from a mile away. The cast tiptoes around a Gothic mansion during a storm. Chucky appears in the background oblivious to the film's characters. Que the music score. One girl gets undressed. We know she has it coming to her and so on and so on.One character is a kid. She's the innocent one caught in the mix. Some of the characters are jerks. Some are greedy schemers. Another character is helpless and misunderstood by everyone in general. It's pretty easy to figure the order in which everyone is going to get their just desserts. They're not really characters, but fodder for Chucky's mischievous mayhem.The original Child's Play showed some innovation when it came to Chucky's carnage, but there's no innovation to be found here. Chucky had some clever one liners in the original Child's Play. There's none here. There's a few plot twists, one too many in fact. Sometimes less is more.Curse of Chucky is just another bland, uninspired horror film that coasts on the goodwill established by the original Child's Play. It just happens to have an iconic horror film villain to distinguish itself. Otherwise, this is pretty forgettable stuff.

Universal Home Entertainment gives fright fans ""Curse of Chucky"" just in time for Halloween. There's no doubt that decades down the road, the image of the deranged Good Guys doll will be immortalized right next to the Universal Classic Monsters like Frankenstein's creation, Dracula, the Wolf Man, the Mummy, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Right or wrong, the ""Child's Play"" movies and their sequels have made that big of an impact on pop culture.Wheelchair-bound Nica and her mother live alone in a secluded mansion. When a mysterious package holding a vintage Good Guys doll named Chucky is delivered to their doorstep, they think it's just a mistake. After being tossed in the trash, Chucky is found sitting near the bloody corpse of Nica's mother. As the house fills up with guests for the funeral, the body count rises. The malevolent soul inside Chucky needs a body to inhabit, and Nica's niece meets his deranged requirements.Director/Writer Don Mancini brings the ""Child's Play"" movies full circle with ""Curse of Chucky."" After two entries in the series many would call more camp and humor than horror, he re-injects this entry with a healthy dose of suspense and thrills. His choice of an old dark mansion also helps by giving the film a classic gothic atmosphere. I would say this is the perfect balance between the original and its lighter-hearted sequels.The special effects team is hard at work in ""Curse of Chucky."" This is not the sanitized PG-13 or R-rated slasher films we saw in the late 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. It's graphic and the gore is here for everyone to enjoy. Whether running, smiling, turning his head around, or slashing away at someone, Chucky looks fabulous.Brad Dourif is every bit as humorous as we've come to expect when he voices Chucky. You can't help but giggle every time you hear the childhood toy utter foul language and say inappropriate things. He really is perfect in the role.""Curse of Chucky"" is full of skepticism towards religion and Christianity. Chucky tells the little girl he terrorizes that there is no God several times. Nica and her mother both left the church after an obvious period of disillusionment. The priest also seems rather judgmental and Nica's sister presents herself as a Christian but definitely doesn't live that way. You can take all this as an attack against Christianity or as a general example of how Director/Writer Mancini sees hypocritical ""followers"" of the faith.The Unrated version of ""Curse of Chucky"" didn't strike me as any worse than what would be considered an R-rated movie these days. There's plenty of graphic violence, foul language, and sexual situations. However, there's no nudity to be found.""Curse of Chucky"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1) and 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Every gory slash, cackle from Chucky, and rumbling roll of thunder will resonate throughout your home theater. The picture quality is clear and easy on the eyes as well.There are some interesting special features included on the Blu-ray edition of ""Curse of Chucky."" Audio commentary is provided by Director Don Mancini, Puppeteer Tony Gardner, and actor Fiona Dourif. It contains three featurettes entitled """"Playing with Dolls: The Making of 'Curse of Chucky,'"" ""Living Doll: Bringing Chucky to Life,'"" and ""Voodoo Doll: The Chucky Legacy.'"" Storyboard comparisons, deleted scenes, and a gag reel round out the bonus material.I'm actually quite surprised that ""Curse of Chucky"" didn't get a theatrical release. I know it boils down to Universal wanting to test the waters for their upcoming reboot of the franchise without investing too much in promotion. The film really does a great job revitalizing the series and reminding genre fans why they fell in love with the maniacal character in the first place.",4,"""Curse of Chucky"" Revives the Long Dormant ""Child's Play"" Franchise",1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,3854,"['been', 'almost', 'decade', 'Chucky', 'back', 'Universal', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'fright', 'fans', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'just', 'time', 'Halloween', 'doubt', 'road', 'image', 'deranged', 'Good', 'Guys', 'doll', 'will', 'be', 'immortalized', 'right', 'next', 'Universal', 'Classic', 'Monsters', 'Frankenstein', 'creation', 'Dracula', 'Wolf', 'Man', 'Mummy', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon', 'Right', 'wrong', 'Child', 'Play', 'movies', 'sequels', 'have', 'made', 'big', 'impact', 'pop', 'culture.Wheelchair-bound', 'Nica', 'mother', 'live', 'alone', 'secluded', 'mansion', 'When', 'mysterious', 'package', 'holding', 'vintage', 'Good', 'Guys', 'doll', 'named', 'Chucky', 'delivered', 'doorstep', 'think', 'just', 'mistake', 'being', 'tossed', 'trash', 'Chucky', 'found', 'sitting', 'bloody', 'corpse', 'Nica', 'mother', 'house', 'up', 'guests', 'funeral', 'body', 'count', 'malevolent', 'soul', 'Chucky', 'body', 'inhabit', 'Nica', 'niece', 'meets', 'deranged', 'requirements.Director/Writer', 'Don', 'Mancini', 'Child', 'Play', 'movies', 'full', 'circle', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'two', 'entries', 'series', 'many', 'would', 'call', 'more', 'camp', 'humor', 'horror', 'entry', 'healthy', 'dose', 'suspense', 'thrills', 'choice', 'old', 'dark', 'mansion', 'also', 'giving', 'film', 'classic', 'gothic', 'atmosphere', 'would', 'say', 'perfect', 'balance', 'original', 'lighter-hearted', 'sequels.The', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'hard', 'work', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'not', 'sanitized', 'PG-13', 'R-rated', 'slasher', 'films', 'saw', 'late', '1980s', '1990s', '2000s', 'graphic', 'gore', 'here', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'Whether', 'running', 'smiling', 'turning', 'head', 'around', 'slashing', 'away', 'someone', 'Chucky', 'fabulous.Brad', 'Dourif', 'bit', 'as', 'humorous', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'when', 'Chucky', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'giggle', 'time', 'hear', 'childhood', 'toy', 'utter', 'foul', 'language', 'say', 'inappropriate', 'things', 'really', 'perfect', 'role', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'full', 'skepticism', 'towards', 'religion', 'Christianity', 'Chucky', 'little', 'girl', 'God', 'several', 'times', 'Nica', 'mother', 'left', 'church', 'obvious', 'period', 'disillusionment', 'priest', 'also', 'rather', 'judgmental', 'Nica', 'sister', 'Christian', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'live', 'way', 'can', 'take', 'attack', 'Christianity', 'general', 'example', 'how', 'Director/Writer', 'Mancini', 'hypocritical', 'followers', 'faith.The', 'Unrated', 'version', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'worse', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'R-rated', 'movie', 'days', 'plenty', 'graphic', 'violence', 'foul', 'language', 'sexual', 'situations', 'However', 'nudity', 'be', 'found', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'presented', '1080p', 'High-Definition', 'Widescreen', '1.78:1', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'Every', 'gory', 'slash', 'cackle', 'Chucky', 'rumbling', 'roll', 'thunder', 'will', 'resonate', 'home', 'theater', 'picture', 'quality', 'clear', 'easy', 'eyes', 'are', 'interesting', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Director', 'Don', 'Mancini', 'Puppeteer', 'Tony', 'Gardner', 'actor', 'Fiona', 'Dourif', 'three', 'featurettes', 'entitled', 'Playing', 'Dolls', 'Making', ""'Curse"", 'Chucky', 'Living', 'Doll', 'Bringing', 'Chucky', 'Life', 'Voodoo', 'Doll', 'Chucky', 'Legacy', 'Storyboard', 'comparisons', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'round', 'out', 'bonus', 'material.I', ""'m"", 'actually', 'quite', 'surprised', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'theatrical', 'release', 'know', 'down', 'Universal', 'wanting', 'test', 'waters', 'upcoming', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'investing', 'too', 'much', 'promotion', 'film', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'revitalizing', 'series', 'reminding', 'genre', 'fans', 'why', 'fell', 'love', 'maniacal', 'character', 'first', 'place']",N/A

He has been scary, funny, creepy, and awesome all throughout the entire franchise. So when I learned that a new sequel was in the works I could not wait for it. I have loved all of the films in the series so I knew that this would be no different. The same guy that has written all of them Don Mancini returned to not only write but direct like he did the last one previous &#8220;Seed of Chucky&#8221;.Nica is a paraplegic woman who lives with her mother and receives a package one day out of the blue. Inside said package is a doll, a &#8220;Good Guy&#8221; doll, his name, Chucky. She has no idea why this came to her or who it is from but just thinks it is a mistake and thinks nothing of it. Later that night she is awaken by the sound of her mother&#8217;s scream. Upon investigating she finds her dead apparently from committing suicide, it is later ruled that. Soon after her sister and her family come to stay with her as the house was left to both of them. One wants to sell but Nica knows this place as home. Nica gives the doll to her little niece and the family settles in along with a priest that her older sister has brought to comfort her. But as the night goes on something is not right as her niece is talking to the doll as if it is talking back to her and family secrets are about to come out. Oh yeah did a mention that there is a serial killer doll in the house, what fun.In all honesty this may be the best sequel in the entire franchise. It is a return to the horror roots of the franchise much like the first ones but also retains some of the dark humor that the later ones became famous for. And for those wondering this is not a remake or reimaging, it is in fact a sequel that does a wonderful job of tying all the films together. Don like always has done a wonderful job with this film and you can tell he really cares about the character he created. The film feels and looks like the first one and the atmosphere is great. The film takes place almost entirely in one day in the house which for some reason I have always loved movies that take place in one day.Acting wise you know Brad Dourif is excellent as Chucky and as the returning Charles Lee Ray. The movies would be nothing without him as the voice of the franchise. But it is his daughter Fiona Dourif that surprised me most here. This is the first film I have seen her in although I know she is on the series &#8220;True Blood&#8221;. She is excellent here as paraplegic Nica and really comes across as natural. Everyone in the film does a great job as everyone was believable in their roles.This is a great Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack with all kinds of great special features.

The movie is shot and edited to build suspense and is a world apart from the sitcom trappings of Seed.A girl in a wheelchair (Brad Dourif's hot daughter Fiona) living in a rural home with her troubled mother receives a mysterious package one afternoon. It's Chucky, and he's somehow managed to get himself in the mail again. He's arrived to settle a score, and soon enough he has brainwashed a child into keeping his secret and is sneaking about in the shadows offing unsuspecting victims.Many people are saying that this movie is a return to form, and that it retcons Bride and Seed out of existence. Er...no, the film very much DOES acknowledge the events of Bride and Seed. Even if you paid the bare minimum of attention it would be hard to not to realize this. But I guess that expecting the movie to go in a different direction only led to further surprises when it eventually did tie in to the previous movies as well as giving us more back-story to Charles Lee Ray.I was worried that Chucky would be all CGI as Kevin Yagher has not been involved with the series since Bride, and while there IS some CGI, he's anamatronic for the most part. Instead of hogging the camera though he keeps quiet watches the humans interact for about half the movie before unleashing toy terror. Horror composer Joseph LoDuca delivers a pastiche of the Renzetti, Revell, and Donaggio's efforts without giving Curse a signature sound of its own. Not really a complaint, but more of a missed chance.It's certainly a worthy sequel and a can be viewed as a genuine horror film without any of the guilty pleasure of Seed. Keep watching to the end of the credits for a further surprise that ties the series together even more (though it does contradict the closing scene before the credits actually roll).Curse is significantly superior to Seed when it comes to cinematography. The movie was shot in ProRes 4:4:4 by Michael Marshall, who mainly has experience in Canadian TV shows. While I do not doubt that the movie would look better on 35mm film I still have no complaints regarding the picture quality. It's clean, it's sharp, the blacks are bold and colors sparkle. The DTS HD-MA sound is not without stingers, but they're smartly done.

When Sarah opens it, it is a Good Guy doll. The mouth can move and it talks.

1661281,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00DTPRZ0G,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","Only minutes into the movie I was already shocked at the production quality.  Immediately evident were some gorgeous efforts on cinematography in the early shots and the acting feels fresh and credible, unlike most stale to stagnant-flavored wooden acting of even &#34;decent quality&#34; horror.  Also slapping me in the face for attention, the camera work is thoughtful and innovative for the first time in the franchise.  This sequel/pseudo-reboot may not hold a candle to Evil Dead (2013) or Carrie (2013), but clearly more love and consideration went into this film than to simply capitalize on horror fans' fealty with more advanced CGI to supplement the effects.Nica (Fiona Dourif; True Blood, The Master) is a gorgeous wheelchair-bound young woman living with her mother (Chantal Quesnelle), who is sweet but over-protective to the point of inhibiting Nica's self-confidence.  They receive a package from an anonymous sender containing&#8230;you guessed it: a Good Guy doll!  After her mother is murdered, Nica's sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti; Insidious 2) brings her daughter (Alice) and nanny (Jill) for the funeral.  Alice quickly falls in love with Chucky and people start to die.We encounter the same classic tells.  The doll never seems to be where people left it, it appears in strange places, and young Alice makes vague suggestions that Chucky can move on his own (e.g., &#34;He's hiding&#34;).Brad Dourif (The Hazing, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Dune) returns to voice the iconic Chucky and his daughter Fiona does a fine job as well.  The only fault I found in the acting was some soap opera star playing an incredibly unconvincing priest and other actors in other minor roles.The kills were alright.  Nothing special, but still fun.  I'd say the same about the writing.  There were some cheap tactics (e.g., a lesbian adultery scenario) but overall this film was an enjoyable success.Directed and written (characters) by Don Mancini--who took part in writing all of the Child's Play franchise installments (1988-2013) and several related short films as well as directing Seed of Chucky (2004)--was limited to a DTDVD release after the understandably subpar performance of Bride of Chucky (1998) and Seed of Chucky (2004).  However, the quality of the present film suggests that the rumored Chucky 7 should find its way to a theatrical release.Curse of Chucky is tactful and shows restraint.  It's not until halfway through the film that we hear Chucky's voice or see him killing onscreen.  After the outlandishly farcical events and pacing of the last two movies, this is just what the franchise needed--a return to its roots!  No more jokes or fooling around; just the sort of plain old-fashioned malevolence that could make homicidal dolls menacing again.Watch this and enjoy.  The end does a fine job linking the stories of the movies together and you should stay through the credits for one last franchise cameo.",4,Exactly the kind of sequel we wanted (for a change) and just what the franchise needed!,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,2947,"['Only', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'already', 'shocked', 'production', 'quality', 'Immediately', 'evident', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'efforts', 'cinematography', 'early', 'shots', 'acting', 'feels', 'fresh', 'credible', 'most', 'stale', 'stagnant-flavored', 'wooden', 'acting', 'even', '34', 'decent', 'quality', '34', 'horror', 'Also', 'slapping', 'face', 'attention', 'camera', 'work', 'thoughtful', 'innovative', 'first', 'time', 'franchise', 'sequel/pseudo-reboot', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2013', 'Carrie', '2013', 'clearly', 'more', 'love', 'consideration', 'went', 'film', 'simply', 'capitalize', 'horror', 'fans', 'fealty', 'more', 'advanced', 'CGI', 'supplement', 'effects.Nica', 'Fiona', 'Dourif', 'True', 'Blood', 'Master', 'gorgeous', 'wheelchair-bound', 'young', 'woman', 'living', 'mother', 'Chantal', 'Quesnelle', 'who', 'sweet', 'over-protective', 'point', 'inhibiting', 'Nica', 'self-confidence', 'receive', 'package', 'anonymous', 'sender', 'containing', '8230', 'guessed', 'Good', 'Guy', 'doll', 'mother', 'murdered', 'Nica', 'sister', 'Barb', 'Danielle', 'Bisutti', 'Insidious', '2', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'nanny', 'Jill', 'funeral', 'Alice', 'quickly', 'love', 'Chucky', 'people', 'start', 'die.We', 'encounter', 'same', 'classic', 'tells', 'doll', 'never', 'be', 'where', 'people', 'left', 'strange', 'places', 'young', 'Alice', 'vague', 'suggestions', 'Chucky', 'can', 'move', 'own', 'e.g.', '34', 'hiding', '34', '.Brad', 'Dourif', 'Hazing', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Two', 'Towers', 'Dune', 'voice', 'iconic', 'Chucky', 'daughter', 'Fiona', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'fault', 'found', 'acting', 'was', 'soap', 'opera', 'star', 'playing', 'incredibly', 'unconvincing', 'priest', 'other', 'actors', 'other', 'minor', 'roles.The', 'kills', 'were', 'alright', 'Nothing', 'special', 'still', 'fun', ""'d"", 'say', 'same', 'writing', 'were', 'cheap', 'tactics', 'e.g.', 'lesbian', 'adultery', 'scenario', 'overall', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'success.Directed', 'written', 'characters', 'Don', 'Mancini', 'who', 'took', 'part', 'writing', 'Child', 'Play', 'franchise', 'installments', '1988-2013', 'several', 'related', 'short', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'Seed', 'Chucky', '2004', 'was', 'limited', 'DTDVD', 'release', 'understandably', 'subpar', 'performance', 'Bride', 'Chucky', '1998', 'Seed', 'Chucky', '2004', 'However', 'quality', 'present', 'film', 'rumored', 'Chucky', '7', 'should', 'find', 'way', 'theatrical', 'release.Curse', 'Chucky', 'tactful', 'restraint', 'not', 'halfway', 'film', 'hear', 'Chucky', 'voice', 'see', 'killing', 'onscreen', 'outlandishly', 'farcical', 'events', 'pacing', 'last', 'two', 'movies', 'just', 'what', 'franchise', 'needed', 'return', 'roots', 'more', 'jokes', 'fooling', 'around', 'just', 'sort', 'plain', 'old-fashioned', 'malevolence', 'could', 'make', 'homicidal', 'dolls', 'menacing', 'again.Watch', 'enjoy', 'end', 'fine', 'job', 'linking', 'stories', 'movies', 'together', 'should', 'stay', 'credits', 'one', 'last', 'franchise', 'cameo']",N/A

1661286,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00DTPRZ0G,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","After a near 9 year absence, everyone's favorite murderous doll, Chucky returned! When I first saw the trailer for the film, I wasn't interested in it too much because of how different Chucky looked but after giving it some time, I gave in, realized how creepier the new and improved Chucky looked and I'm proud to see it's in the 5 star section on my DVD shelf.The plot of the movie revolves around paraplegic, Nica, who lives with her mother Sarah. One afternoon, a package comes in the mail for Nica and it turns out to be Chucky inside of the box. Later that night, Sarah is mysteriously found dead via stab wound and her death is ruled as a suicide. The next day, Nica's older sister, Barb arrives, accompanied by her husband, Ian; daughter, Alice; live-in nanny, Jill; and Father Frank, a priest. Alice finds Chucky and keeps him. During dinner, Chucky secretly poisons a bowl of chili that Father Frank ends up eating and is later killed in a fatal car crash.Let me just say right off the bat that Barb (Danielle Bisutti) does too much of a good job at playing the bitch sister. You almost have a major disdain for the character as soon as she arrives on the screen. Back to the movie though. Later that night as everyone is sleeping, Nica has a suspicious feeling about Chucky and takes it upon herself to do some internet research on the doll, where she learns of Chucky's murderous history. From there on out, the family must survive the night and escape Chucky's wrath, but unfortunately most of them fall victim to him and die very gruesome deaths.An interesting thing to note about Curse of Chucky is that the movie returns to it's horror roots, whereas the last 3 Chucky films mixed horror and comedy. No humor here. Just horror at it's best. There's a bit of a shocking twist at the end of the movie that explains how the events of the first Child's Play movie came about. But the surprises don't stop there, as in the post-credits, we take a visit to a certain someone and I'll leave it that. To find out what these surprises are truly all about, you'll have to buy the movie....or just search the internet for spoilers. But I highly recommend buying this movie.

1661290,A3TMS14RL9Q0R1,B00DTPRZ0G,"K. Sommerfield ""Slasher Studios""","[18, 20]","What follows is a brief, spoiler free review. If you love Chucky as much as I think you might, don't like ANYONE give away the twists in the final act.If ever there was a fan boy horror movie on Chucky, ""Curse of Chucky"" would be it. With references to all of the previous entries in the franchise, this film is a delight from beginning to end. As ""Curse of Chucky"" begins, we meet the lonely Nica (played by Fiona Dourif in a wonderfully understated performance) as she is living with her mom in house in the middle of nowhere. Her mother wants to keep her sheltered from the rest of the world as Nica is confined to a wheelchair. One day, the two receive an anonymous package in the mail with a doll inside. The doll is Chucky and he is ready to play. When an unfortunate ""accident"" causes her mother's death, Nica's greedy relatives are back to claim the house and sell it to make a few extra bucks.After the rest of Nica's family arrives including her bitchy older sister Barb (nicely played by Danielle Bisutti) with her daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell), it is up to the family to survive the night to keep from becoming Chucky's latest victims. And victims many do become with a bloodbath that results in a few grisly deaths that had me smiling.Though the film starts with a slow buildup in the first act that results in two off screen deaths (don't worry, like I said, the film does get bloody), the film nicely comes together in its second act to become one of the best made for video horror movies of recent years. To go on and tell you what REALLY works about this film would be to give away way too many of the devilish surprises. Let's just say that fans will cheer in delight as the film hits its final act as there are in jokes, references, and homages to just about anything and everything Chucky has done in the past. The backstory might not be fulfilling to some and there might be some leaps in logic, but this is the rare horror sequel that actually appears to be trying to add something new while being faithful to what came before it. If you are a Chucky fan, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. Also, make sure to stay after the end credits for one treat of a scene that will leave audiences howling. Thanks for returning Chucky, you were missed. Now, let's see some more Chuck!",4,More Chuck For the Buck,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,2311,"['What', 'brief', 'spoiler', 'free', 'review', 'love', 'Chucky', 'as', 'much', 'think', 'might', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'ANYONE', 'give', 'away', 'twists', 'final', 'act.If', 'ever', 'was', 'fan', 'boy', 'horror', 'movie', 'Chucky', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'would', 'be', 'references', 'previous', 'entries', 'franchise', 'film', 'delight', 'beginning', 'end', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'meet', 'lonely', 'Nica', 'played', 'Fiona', 'Dourif', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'performance', 'living', 'mom', 'house', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'mother', 'keep', 'sheltered', 'rest', 'world', 'Nica', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'One', 'day', 'two', 'receive', 'anonymous', 'package', 'mail', 'doll', 'inside', 'doll', 'Chucky', 'ready', 'play', 'When', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'mother', 'death', 'Nica', 'greedy', 'relatives', 'are', 'back', 'claim', 'house', 'sell', 'make', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks.After', 'rest', 'Nica', 'family', 'including', 'bitchy', 'older', 'sister', 'Barb', 'nicely', 'played', 'Danielle', 'Bisutti', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'Summer', 'H.', 'Howell', 'family', 'survive', 'night', 'keep', 'becoming', 'Chucky', 'latest', 'victims', 'victims', 'many', 'do', 'become', 'bloodbath', 'results', 'few', 'grisly', 'deaths', 'had', 'film', 'slow', 'buildup', 'first', 'act', 'results', 'two', 'screen', 'deaths', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'said', 'film', 'get', 'bloody', 'film', 'nicely', 'together', 'second', 'act', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'made', 'video', 'horror', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'go', 'tell', 'REALLY', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'away', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'devilish', 'surprises', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'fans', 'will', 'cheer', 'delight', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'are', 'jokes', 'references', 'just', 'anything', 'everything', 'Chucky', 'done', 'past', 'backstory', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'fulfilling', 'might', 'be', 'leaps', 'logic', 'rare', 'horror', 'sequel', 'actually', 'be', 'trying', 'add', 'something', 'new', 'being', 'faithful', 'what', 'came', 'are', 'Chucky', 'fan', 'owe', 'yourself', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'Also', 'make', 'sure', 'stay', 'end', 'one', 'treat', 'scene', 'will', 'leave', 'audiences', 'howling', 'Thanks', 'returning', 'Chucky', 'were', 'missed', 'Now', 'let', 'see', 'more', 'Chuck']",N/A

Chucky ends up killing the mother, without the daughter knowing of him inside the doll. Her sister and her husband come to stay with her and bring along their nanny and little daughter. There is a long stint of boredom, but then when Chucky goes in for the kill it begins to pick up the pace. It's probably been expected by many fans that Chucky would eventually end up in the care of a girl. Chucky does what he does; the girl knows he is alive, but the adults don't beleive her. Chucky kills, and makes a few decent gore moments, probably the best ever seen in a Chucky movie that wasn't done for a laugh reaction.The end was a surprise. You think through most of the movie if this is supposed to be a remake, or how the heck Chucky is alive and living in the doll once again. In the end, all if revealed.

1661308,A25BJ6ZTGRNR3L,B00DTPRZ0G,North Gate,"[4, 4]","One of the things that I loved about Ronny Yu's 1998 Bride of Chucky was that it took the Child's Play franchise in a completely new direction. After two sequels, creator Don Mancini wrote in Tiffany, the ""bride"" to the infamous slasher, Chucky, which turned the fourth film into a buddy comedy. Even through the gags, both Mancini and Yu kept a straight face, delivering one of the biggest shockers in horror history: a terrifying half doll-half human baby with razor sharp teeth. Mancini, who created the franchise, and penned all of the films, would take the reigns with the 2004 Seed of Chucky, which made a sharp turn that many weren't expecting. While I judge each film on its own merits (I really liked Seed of Chucky), it wasn't the movie that Bride of Chucky promised when it left us with our jaws on the theater floor.Curse of Chucky, written and directed once again by Mancini, returns to the Child's Play roots, and finally delivers on that promise way back in 1998.On the franchise's 25th anniversary, Chucky fans are in for a treat with the latest installment, which puts Brad Dourif's (the voice of Chucky) daughter Fiona in the lead role. She plays Nica, a born paraplegic, who is tossed in the middle of family drama when a ""Good Guys"" doll is delivered to her house. Neither her nor her mother knows who or why it was sent to them. Tossed in the trash, that night Nica is awakened to screams, only to find her mother dead on the floor from an apparent fall off the balcony. The Good Guys doll sits in the corner watching. Brooding. Waiting. Classic.The next day, Nica's house is infiltrated with family, including her sister (Barb; Danielle Bisutti), brother-in-law (Ian; Brennan Elliott), their young daughter (Alice; Summer Howell) and a live-in maid (Jill; Maitland McConnell). The Good Guys doll immediately enamors Alice, making them best friends forever.Chucky - for those of you unacquainted, is a serial killer named Charles Lee Ray that became trapped inside the doll (see Child's Play) - immediately begins his mischievous games, causing bizarre and unexpected deaths to occur. It all needs to look like an accident, which sort of ties Mancini's hands from being able to do much ""slashing""; it forces him to create suspense in other ways, for example, like putting rat poison in a random bowl of the guests' soup.Curse of Chucky shows serious restraint, which is rare for a fifth sequel. Instead of jumping right in, Mancini works his way to the reveal, treating the film like an introduction to a completely new, younger audience. And even after ol' Chuckster is on a path of destruction, Mancini continued to peel layer, after layer, after layer off of the story, blasting the hardcore fans with more hat-tips than they'll be able to handle.The new design of Chucky, which will make sense when you see the flick, is crazy scary. Complimented with astounding effects work and puppetry, Chucky has never looked better...And even though budget appears to have no bearing on Chucky, you can definitely ""feel"" the constraints, especially since the near-entirety of the film is limited to a single location. Yet, Universal deserves serious props for getting creator Mancini back behind the camera because it was shot with extreme love and care, delivering on quality, classic camerawork and scares that feel intimate to a Child's Play film.As a hardcore Child's Play fan, I find the flaws weren't so overpowering, although I do wish it were a bit gorier. And oddly enough, I really didn't like what Mancini did with Charles Lee Ray's backstory, which I felt turned him into a more mean-spirited serial killer.Speaking of backstory, Mancini ties everything together in Curse of Chucky. It's a sincere love letter to the fans that really drop the gloves and goes for it. For some, the self-referential model may even be a little too much - but it without question carries the biggest geek-out moments since the 2003 Freddy vs. Jason.Following the finale, the overly long epilogue plays out like something you'd see in Ocean's Eleven; and in terms of a payoff, it's what makes or breaks the movie. Audiences should stick through the end credits for what will be the ultimate sendoff if the franchise were to die tomorrow.Curse of Chucky may just be the best home video sequel since Wrong Turn 2. It's alarmingly good, which puts pressure on Universal to answer as to why they didn't let Mancini shoot this for theaters. Chucky fans should rejoice, though, as Curse of Chucky is clearly going to re-ignite the franchise for years to come.",5,Suprised,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,4558,"['One', 'things', 'loved', 'Ronny', 'Yu', '1998', 'Bride', 'Chucky', 'was', 'took', 'Child', 'Play', 'franchise', 'completely', 'new', 'direction', 'two', 'sequels', 'creator', 'Don', 'Mancini', 'wrote', 'Tiffany', 'bride', 'infamous', 'slasher', 'Chucky', 'turned', 'fourth', 'film', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'Even', 'gags', 'Mancini', 'Yu', 'kept', 'straight', 'face', 'delivering', 'one', 'biggest', 'shockers', 'horror', 'history', 'terrifying', 'half', 'doll-half', 'human', 'baby', 'razor', 'sharp', 'teeth', 'Mancini', 'who', 'created', 'franchise', 'penned', 'films', 'would', 'take', 'reigns', '2004', 'Seed', 'Chucky', 'made', 'sharp', 'turn', 'many', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'judge', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'really', 'liked', 'Seed', 'Chucky', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Bride', 'Chucky', 'promised', 'when', 'left', 'jaws', 'theater', 'floor.Curse', 'Chucky', 'written', 'directed', 'once', 'again', 'Mancini', 'Child', 'Play', 'roots', 'finally', 'delivers', 'promise', 'way', 'back', '1998.On', 'franchise', '25th', 'anniversary', 'Chucky', 'fans', 'are', 'treat', 'latest', 'installment', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'voice', 'Chucky', 'daughter', 'Fiona', 'lead', 'role', 'Nica', 'born', 'paraplegic', 'who', 'tossed', 'middle', 'family', 'drama', 'when', 'Good', 'Guys', 'doll', 'delivered', 'house', 'mother', 'knows', 'who', 'why', 'was', 'sent', 'Tossed', 'trash', 'night', 'Nica', 'awakened', 'screams', 'only', 'find', 'mother', 'dead', 'floor', 'apparent', 'fall', 'balcony', 'Good', 'Guys', 'doll', 'sits', 'corner', 'watching', 'Brooding', 'Waiting', 'Classic.The', 'next', 'day', 'Nica', 'house', 'infiltrated', 'family', 'including', 'sister', 'Barb', 'Danielle', 'Bisutti', 'brother-in-law', 'Ian', 'Brennan', 'Elliott', 'young', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'Summer', 'Howell', 'live-in', 'maid', 'Jill', 'Maitland', 'McConnell', 'Good', 'Guys', 'doll', 'immediately', 'enamors', 'Alice', 'making', 'best', 'friends', 'forever.Chucky', 'unacquainted', 'serial', 'killer', 'named', 'Charles', 'Lee', 'Ray', 'became', 'trapped', 'doll', 'see', 'Child', 'Play', 'immediately', 'mischievous', 'games', 'causing', 'bizarre', 'unexpected', 'deaths', 'occur', 'look', 'accident', 'sort', 'ties', 'Mancini', 'hands', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'much', 'slashing', 'create', 'suspense', 'other', 'ways', 'example', 'putting', 'rat', 'poison', 'random', 'bowl', 'guests', 'soup.Curse', 'Chucky', 'serious', 'restraint', 'rare', 'fifth', 'sequel', 'Instead', 'jumping', 'right', 'Mancini', 'way', 'reveal', 'treating', 'film', 'introduction', 'completely', 'new', 'younger', 'audience', 'even', 'ol', 'Chuckster', 'path', 'destruction', 'Mancini', 'continued', 'peel', 'layer', 'layer', 'layer', 'off', 'story', 'blasting', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'more', 'hat-tips', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'handle.The', 'new', 'design', 'Chucky', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'see', 'flick', 'crazy', 'scary', 'Complimented', 'astounding', 'effects', 'work', 'puppetry', 'Chucky', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'even', 'budget', 'have', 'bearing', 'Chucky', 'can', 'definitely', 'feel', 'constraints', 'especially', 'near-entirety', 'film', 'limited', 'single', 'location', 'Universal', 'serious', 'props', 'getting', 'creator', 'Mancini', 'back', 'camera', 'was', 'shot', 'extreme', 'love', 'care', 'delivering', 'quality', 'classic', 'camerawork', 'feel', 'intimate', 'Child', 'Play', 'hardcore', 'Child', 'Play', 'fan', 'find', 'flaws', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'overpowering', 'do', 'wish', 'were', 'bit', 'gorier', 'oddly', 'enough', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'Mancini', 'did', 'Charles', 'Lee', 'Ray', 'backstory', 'felt', 'turned', 'more', 'mean-spirited', 'serial', 'killer.Speaking', 'backstory', 'Mancini', 'everything', 'together', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'sincere', 'love', 'letter', 'fans', 'really', 'gloves', 'self-referential', 'model', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'question', 'biggest', 'geek-out', 'moments', '2003', 'Freddy', 'Jason.Following', 'finale', 'overly', 'long', 'epilogue', 'out', 'something', ""'d"", 'see', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'terms', 'payoff', 'what', 'breaks', 'movie', 'Audiences', 'should', 'stick', 'end', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'ultimate', 'sendoff', 'franchise', 'were', 'die', 'tomorrow.Curse', 'Chucky', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'best', 'home', 'video', 'sequel', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '2', 'alarmingly', 'good', 'pressure', 'Universal', 'answer', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'Mancini', 'shoot', 'theaters', 'Chucky', 'fans', 'should', 'rejoice', 'though', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'clearly', 'going', 're-ignite', 'franchise', 'years', 'come']",N/A

If I didn't know better I would have thought she really was paralyzed.  Hopefully we will see her in even more movies - outstanding acting by her and A. Martinez, even though his part was relatively small. Chucky sure has gone through some facial changes since Child's Play 3.  Even with the scars and stitches, he has an even more menacing look.  I would like to know why the Play Pal company keeps putting this doll back together?  I don't get that.  Of course, Chucky keeps getting away with a lot more killings and innocent people who are trying to stop him get blamed for them, tried, and convicted to an insane asylum.  I liked it after Fiora got sentenced in court and the Chucky doll was on the evidence table,she wheeled by it in her wheelchair and taunted Chucky that she was still alive.  Then she gave a little evil laugh.  I also enjoyed her taunting Chucky about his failure in never being able to kill Andy. Chucky got real PO'd about that. There is a surprise on the DVD after all the credits have run (unrated version) that picks up on action 6 months after the mayhem in this movie but I won't spill the beans.

But this film is far superior to at least 3 of the series sequels, if not all of them.This movie begins with &#34;Chucky&#34; being sent to what would seem to be a random location/family. Of course, bodies pile up. Something that really works is Chucky's &#34;friend til the end&#34; being a girl, and that out of a whole suitcase of random dolls, she likes him the best. But they don't play the rehash card-she isn't right there, being ridiculed and blamed for everything...Chucky's &#34;Curse&#34; isn't revealed quite as much as one would hope, but how he ended up in that toystore is explained in full, and just how crazy he was b4 becoming a killer doll is also explained. This is his connection to this family.By all means, it is scary, suspenseful, and disturbing, like the films were prior to &#34;Bride.&#34; I liked Bride, but it was a little silly at times, and &#34;Seed&#34; was just stupid. This isn't like them at all, even though SPOILER ALERT! &#34;Tiffany&#34; does show up and while it's a small role, it really brought the movie full circle, and allowed everything to make sense while not being plaqued by &#34;Seed&#34;.If I have to rate this in the series, it's definitely better than the terrible &#34;Seed,&#34; as well as the rather poorly made &#34;Child's Play 3,&#34; and despite the fun it's still better than &#34;Bride.&#34; I'd compare this to the levels of horror &#34;Child's Play 2&#34; had, and honestly, it's just as if not more creepy due to the use of modern tech. And when I say modern tech, I mean better animatronics. This should've been released to theatres. I look forward to another film if it's half as good as this one.Any fan of Child's Play must see this, even if you hated the last three (3, Bride, Seed) or loved them all (besides Seed, maybe).

I had high expectations for Chucky's 6th film, but I was pretty letdown. After watching it a 2nd time, it was a little bit better. The first half of the movie is very slow moving it doesn't even feel like a Chucky movie. It felt like a spooky soap opera and Chucky was just sitting in the background, letting you remember that it's supposed to be his movie. It definitely goes back to the darker tone of the Child's Play series, but it just doesn't have the same spirit. The last half is where this movie actually starts to pick up and become interesting. There is a great flashback scene that gave me chills that explains why Chucky is attacking this family and how it leads to the opening of the original film, which I thought was EPIC! The after-credits scene was just as awesome as it finally gives us the return of Andy Barclay!When her mother supposedly kills herself, paraplegic Nica deals with her loss and the rest of her dysfunctional family. A Good-Guy doll by the name of Chucky shows up and befriends Barbara's daughter, Alice. Soon, grisly murders begin to happen and Nica links the doll to all the past murders and must fight Chucky before he gets his long-awaited revenge.

The characters are better than stock, and they have a connection to Chucky that plays out nicely over the course of the film. There are callbacks to the first movie that are most welcome, and an unexpected cameo at the end for fans of the later flicks. There is plenty of atmosphere thanks to the spooky old house, and an imperiled child is always a trope that can get your blood pumping. There's even a cliche that get turned on its ear, something that never gets old for me, especially in horror movies. The only thing I can really complain about is one act that features two unlikely character decisions that defy character motivation for the sole sake of moving the plot in a specific direction.

This film features dark scenes with POV shots that are as frightening as in the original two films. Then the doll's look along with the entire franchise is very creatively explained. The plot is written so well and really connects the entire franchise together.The pacing of this film was seamless. It did not even feel like it was 90 + minutes. The suspense was absolutely edge of your seat. This film did a great job at reminding audiences as to why Chucky is and always was a HORROR character to begin with.,5,He's Our Friend Till the End,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,963,"['What', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'expected', 'part', 'six', 'franchise', 'just', 'gone', 'direct', 'video', 'was', 'store', 'generic', 'body', 'count', 'film', 'featuring', 'group', 'people', 'locked', 'house', 'Chucky', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'kind', 'explanations', 'direct', 'ties', 'franchise', 'other', 'then', 'brief', 'retelling', 'Charles', 'Lee', 'Ray', 'getting', 'gunned', 'down', 'police', 'passing', 'soul', 'doll', 'MOST.I', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'happy', 'be', 'so', 'wrong', 'film', 'dark', 'scenes', 'POV', 'shots', 'are', 'as', 'frightening', 'original', 'two', 'films', 'Then', 'doll', 'look', 'entire', 'franchise', 'very', 'creatively', 'explained', 'plot', 'written', 'so', 'well', 'really', 'entire', 'franchise', 'together.The', 'pacing', 'film', 'was', 'seamless', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'feel', 'was', '90', '+', 'minutes', 'suspense', 'was', 'absolutely', 'edge', 'seat', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'reminding', 'audiences', 'why', 'Chucky', 'always', 'was', 'HORROR', 'character', 'begin']",N/A

I can see the writers thinking Bride and Seed of Chucky were too goofy, let's make him scary again. The only problem is that Chucky was never as scary as people thought. Or more accurately, you have to be a certain age to be scared by a killer doll.Unfortunately, the filmmakers think that Child's Play was a classic for all the wrong reasons and that the sequels were cool but then the movies went off the rails. So they do as much as they can to imitate the first movie, including a long slow build as a kid walks around with an ugly doll acting weird and saying things like &#34;Chucky says we're all gonna die&#34;. The problem with this strategy is that we KNOW it's Chucky, the killer doll with a New Jersey gangster tough guy routine and so there's no tension and no shock when Chucky finally starts talking. Instead, it's a long dreary march through horror movie cliches leading to a lot of chasing around and Chucky saying lines like &#34;women, can't live with them...period.&#34; which was never really Chucky. Chucky was funny because he took himself seriously and was a total jerk. Chucky was not the one-line Henny Youngman imitator that Freddy Krueger became.By trying to recreate Chucky and the &#34;horror&#34; of the first movie, the screenwriters and director took out all the excitement and fun, leaving us with a by-the-numbers horror movie that plods along without much to offer anyone.",2,Lifeless and misses the point of the series,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,1532,"['As', 'much', 'craze', 'reboot', 'movies', 'return', 'roots', 'time', 'when', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'can', 'see', 'writers', 'thinking', 'Bride', 'Seed', 'Chucky', 'were', 'too', 'goofy', 'let', 'make', 'scary', 'again', 'only', 'problem', 'Chucky', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'scary', 'people', 'thought', 'more', 'accurately', 'have', 'be', 'certain', 'age', 'be', 'scared', 'killer', 'doll.Unfortunately', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'Child', 'Play', 'was', 'classic', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'sequels', 'were', 'cool', 'then', 'movies', 'went', 'rails', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'imitate', 'first', 'movie', 'including', 'long', 'slow', 'build', 'kid', 'around', 'ugly', 'doll', 'acting', 'weird', 'saying', 'things', '34', 'Chucky', ""'re"", 'gon', 'die', '34', 'problem', 'strategy', 'KNOW', 'Chucky', 'killer', 'doll', 'New', 'Jersey', 'gangster', 'tough', 'guy', 'routine', 'so', 'tension', 'shock', 'when', 'Chucky', 'finally', 'talking', 'Instead', 'long', 'dreary', 'march', 'horror', 'movie', 'cliches', 'leading', 'lot', 'chasing', 'around', 'Chucky', 'saying', 'lines', '34', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'period.', '34', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'Chucky', 'Chucky', 'was', 'funny', 'took', 'seriously', 'was', 'total', 'jerk', 'Chucky', 'was', 'not', 'one-line', 'Henny', 'Youngman', 'imitator', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'became.By', 'trying', 'recreate', 'Chucky', '34', 'horror', '34', 'first', 'movie', 'screenwriters', 'director', 'took', 'out', 'excitement', 'fun', 'leaving', 'by-the-numbers', 'horror', 'movie', 'plods', 'along', 'much', 'offer', 'anyone']",N/A

1661322,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00DTPRZ0G,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Curse of Chucky(released Ay/13)stars,among others,Fiona Dourif,Danielle Bisutti,Brennan Elliott and Brad Dourif back as the voice of Chucky.As the 6th in the franchise's history,this is by FAR the worst of the bunch.The producers needed to go back and watch all the previous ones,because they failed to live up to the franchises lively dynamic and what made them so successful.Instead they use old worn tricks and shock elements that needn't have been included.The story finds a mother and her paraplegic daughter(wheelchair bound) living alone.One day they get a package and it is a Chucky doll.By that night,the mother is dead.The next day the daughter's sister,husband,their daughter,nanny and a local priest drop by to offer condolences and comfort.They stay the evening for supper and Chucky is on the move.He sprinkles rat poison on the dinner,but we don't know whose. Out in the dining room it is the priest who starts feeling ill.He leaves and is killed in a car crash on the way home.The sister and family decide to bunk in with her that night,which makes Chucky's night fun.It's storming out(typical,right?)and the little girl is afraid.He plays a game and locks her in a closet.With the girl out of the way,the nanny is the first to get it.Then as the mother tries to find her daughter,she gets hers while searching the attic.Her wheelchair bound sister has meanwhile had to drag herself way up the stairs and she arrives just as her sister falls down the attic stairs and into her lap.Chucky is in pursuit and she drags herself hurriedly into the sister's room and wakes the husband up who has had ear plus in.They flee into the garage.He goes back to try and find his daughter but finds the dead bodies instead.He comes back down to the garage,and ends up restraining her in her wheelchair upstairs,thinking she has done everything.While he checks his laptop,Chucky enters and pushes her wheelchair over him and then axes him.He then pushes her wheelchair through the railings and down to the floor below.While she lays on the floor,barely alive,he explains that in human form he was Charles Lee Ray.He became a friend of her family,but it was him that killed her father,mother and made her a paraplegic in her mother's womb.While fleeing the cops he was able to put his soul into a Chucky doll,25 years before.Back i the present,when a cop arrives and see the carnage he arrests her and she is charged.She is eventually convicted and sentenced to life.As the cop leaves the courthouse with the Chucky doll in a bag,Jennifer Tilly from the previous movie pops up from behind and slits the cops throat.In a post office later,she is mailing Chucky to another address.At that address we see Chucky reunited with the little girl,now living with her grandmother.Chucky plays&#34;hide the soul&#34; with her and recites an incantation.In a post credit scene we see the now grown up boy from the original film get the doll delivered to his house.As Chucky tries to make his move on him,his head is blown off.The producers of this film,instead of following the Chucky bible,tried to randomly throw in every piece of horror schlock they could get by with.They use the old canard of a red herring.At the dinner table while we await someone getting sick from the poison,the husband suddenly says &#34;wait....wait...wait...&#34;,like he is choking.Then he says&#34;This is the best tasting chili I've ever had&#34;.Lame.Then we have the shock value thrown in,for no reason.They allow Chucky to use profanity to a young girl.With adults is one thing,and we all know he would swear,but c'mon it looks terrible using it like that.Give your heads a shake.Then they throw in gratuitous lesbian sex,as the nanny and the girls mother go at it.There are lots of films that that kind of thing would be more appropriate in,but a horror film like this is no place for it.Then there are the endings,five of them to be exact!The film really should have ended around the moment the cop came and arrested the wheel chair bound daughter.Nope.We then go on to a courtroom scene where we see her sentencing carried out.I could have forgiven them that if they had ended it there.Nope.From here we see the cop taking Chucky in a bag in his car and Tilly popping up to off the cop.The end? No way.From here it's Tilly now at the post office mailing the doll to another victim.The end? You gotta be kidding me.From here we see Chucky reunited with the young girl now living with her grandmother who has been killed by Chucky.Ok,it's the end now,right? No.We get a post scene thing with a reuniting of Chucky with the young kid from the original Child's Play(how many people knew that?).Now is it done? Yes.....thankfully.A ridiculous way to end a movie and amateurish to boot.Then finally I must mention the priest's car accident.It was apparently a head on collision that somehow,beyond all logic,managed to take the roof right off the priests car(not the other guys).And of course,when they try and remove the priests body his head comes rolling off.The producers used the mantra,whether it makes sense or not,if we can get a scare,use it.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette,commentary,deleted scenes and a gag reel.All in all a total let down by a crew of folks that didn't seem to have the first clue as to what made the first five so successful.They were using broad strokes from the Chucky bible and filling it in with any kind of horror schlock you would see in a million other horror films.It's easy to make a doll look as if it has come to life and is animated,the hard part is doing it smartly.This filmed missed the boat on all counts.Give it a pass.",2,"This film was dead on arrival,and hey,Chucky didn't do it!",1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,5723,"['Curse', 'Chucky', 'released',

1661328,A3D28SE0H060MU,B00DTPRZ0G,Ryan,"[3, 4]","Many of the horror icons from the 1980s have returned to the big screen in recent years, though all have been reincarnations of the infamous monsters rather than a continuation. Jason returned with a steroid-affected physique, Freddy lost his humor and replaced it with stronger emphasis on pedophilia, and Leatherface became more sympathetic with several films giving us unnecessary back-story. The one villain from the 1980s to remain the same is Chucky, from casting to driving force and creator Don Mancini. The only thing that has changed over the years is the amount of damage done to his plastic face.Since Child's Play brought the ginger doll to life for the first time in 1988, creator Don Mancini has remained involved as screenwriter, and more recently as director. Mancini's career has consisted of little other than Chucky, with nearly all screenwriting credits belonging to the demonic doll. It wasn't until the last film, Seed of Chucky, that Mancini made his directorial debut. Curse of Chucky is his second film as a director, and though he still shows an inability to retrieve believable performances from any of his breathing actors, it is actually the screenwriting and a lack of Chucky's personality which drags this latest sequel into forgettable territory.The other remaining element from the franchise's origins is the voice of Chucky, Brad Dourif, though not in the same manner as fans of the franchise may be accustomed to. Gone are the wisecracking one-liners, instead replaced with a more silent Chucky and an emphasis on thrills and chills over laughter and camp. It almost feels like a throwback to the simplicity of the first film, though without the same amount of fun. Emphasis is on the deaths, which are very precisely carried out in terms of filmmaking, though too few and far apart to save the film. Curse of Chucky is a polished looking film, obviously created by some talented tradesmen, though lacking in any narrative creativity or engaging performances. In short, this is a bit too safe and predictable for a horror movie, even when it does deliver the gore.The plot is set up to take place entirely in one location, no doubt helping in lowering the cost of production and helping create the film's strong visuals from director of photography Michael Marshall. A package arrives as a gift to the home of Nica (Fiona Dourif), whose mother soon mysteriously dies.

The story builds up well with some gruesome kills and very cool chucky doll effects, most of them are practical but some are CGI for certain things we haven't seen chucky do before like walking down stairs etc. The story does take the series full circle linking it to the original and other sequels, plus we get a few nice cameos towards the end, the ending is slightly confusing as there is a cool after credit scene which im not sure fits in but is a good nod for the fans, overall its really worth checking out if your a fan, its fits in so well with the rest of this amazing horror gem of a franchise, the picture quality is outstanding on the Blu-ray, and there are plenty of great features!!!",5,"""..AWESOME SEQUEL..""",1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,1013,"['absolutely', 'great', 'return', 'form', 'child', 'play', 'series', 'true', 'fan', 'such', 'should', 'love', 'curse', 'chucky', 'last', '2', 'sequels', 'were', 'great', 'fun', 'sequel', 'back', 'old', 'school', 'roots', 'creepy', 'doll', 'picking', 'everyone', 'one', 'one', 'revealed', 'alive', 'once', 'again', 'story', 'up', 'well', 'gruesome', 'kills', 'very', 'cool', 'chucky', 'doll', 'effects', 'most', 'are', 'practical', 'are', 'CGI', 'certain', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'chucky', 'do', 'walking', 'down', 'stairs', 'etc', 'story', 'take', 'series', 'full', 'circle', 'linking', 'original', 'other', 'sequels', 'get', 'few', 'nice', 'cameos', 'end', 'ending', 'slightly', 'confusing', 'cool', 'credit', 'scene', 'not', 'sure', 'fits', 'good', 'nod', 'fans', 'overall', 'really', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'fan', 'fits', 'so', 'well', 'rest', 'amazing', 'horror', 'gem', 'franchise', 'picture', 'quality', 'outstanding', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'plenty', 'great', 'features']",N/A

1661333,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B00DTPRZ0G,The Piper at the Gates,"[3, 5]","As an avid horror fan, the Child's Play series is an unavoidable and undeniable favorite of the genre. And while I am a fan of the franchise overall, I can't accept the last two entries in the series, especially ""Seed of Chucky"", as nothing more than utter trash. So when I heard they were making another ""Chucky"" film, I could only hope and pray it wouldn't be anything like the last two. Don Mancini returns as writer/director, which by now, I didn't know if that was a good thing or not. Fortunately, ""Curse of Chucky"" goes back to the style of the first 3 films. A straight forward scary movie, with the humor only coming from the wise-cracking and foul mouthed Chucky! I won't bother writing out the plot and explaining characters or anything like that, but its a decent and pretty well written storyline. I do think it kinda gets off to a slow start, but it does pick up and get better as it goes along. And as it goes along, it does a good job of tying the other films together. However, I'm not completely sure where this film falls into the franchise's timeline. As far as the acting, its ok. Nothing too amazing. One reason for that could be that the characters are pretty forgettable overall. Though I do think that Fiona Dourif (yes, it is Brad Dourif's daughter) as the main protagonist Nica, has a real good performance. And of course Brad Dourif is great as always as the voice of Chucky. But due to the film's beginning slow pace, you don't get to hear a lot of him until the last act of the film. And I don't want to spoil anything, but there are also couple a surprises in the film. And be sure to stay tuned after the credits have rolled too! To be a direct to DVD film and having a budget of only 5 million (according to IMDB), the film does look pretty good. As far as the special effects, they were ok. Certain things didn't look that great and I just didn't there was enough blood. There are a couple of decent deaths, but most of them are too simplistic. But perhaps that had to do with budgetary reasons. As far as the animatronics go, they are decent. The close up shots are pretty good, but in shots that show the whole doll moving/walking, it doesn't always look so good. I'm not sure how much of that animation is pure mechanical or if some CGI was used as well. And again, I'm sure the budget limited this to a degree. And for those of you that were like me and thought they were way off on the look of Chucky when he comes to life, because I didn't like the look at all, it is explained during the movie, so be patient!! Overall, this is a good film. It breathes new life into a franchise that has really suffered for years. Too bad that Don Mancini didn't think of doing this one a decade or so earlier. And its too bad he didn't get a bigger budget for this one and a theatrical release, which would have been great. However, I think this film will do well and draw enough interest for future sequels with hopefully more resources to work with.",3,3.5 Stars: Chucky has new life in this surprisingly good sequel!,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,2977,"['avid', 'horror', 'fan', 'Child', 'Play', 'series', 'unavoidable', 'undeniable', 'favorite', 'genre', 'am', 'fan', 'franchise', 'overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'last', 'two', 'entries', 'series', 'especially', 'Seed', 'Chucky', 'nothing', 'more', 'utter', 'trash', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'Chucky', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'hope', 'pray', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'last', 'two', 'Don', 'Mancini', 'returns', 'writer/director', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'Fortunately', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'back', 'style', 'first', '3', 'films', 'straight', 'forward', 'scary', 'movie', 'humor', 'only', 'coming', 'wise-cracking', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'Chucky', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'writing', 'plot', 'explaining', 'characters', 'anything', 'decent', 'pretty', 'well', 'written', 'storyline', 'do', 'think', 'kinda', 'slow', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'get', 'better', 'along', 'along', 'good', 'job', 'tying', 'other', 'films', 'together', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'where', 'film', 'franchise', 'timeline', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'ok', 'Nothing', 'too', 'amazing', 'One', 'reason', 'could', 'be', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'overall', 'do', 'think', 'Fiona', 'Dourif', 'yes', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'daughter', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Nica', 'real', 'good', 'performance', 'course', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'great', 'as', 'always', 'voice', 'Chucky', 'due', 'film', 'beginning', 'slow', 'pace', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hear', 'lot', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'surprises', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'stay', 'tuned', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'too', 'be', 'direct', 'DVD', 'film', 'having', 'budget', 'only', '5', 'million', 'according', 'IMDB', 'film', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'As', 'far', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'ok.', 'Certain', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'great', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'enough', 'blood', 'are', 'couple', 'decent', 'deaths', 'most', 'are', 'too', 'simplistic', 'perhaps', 'had', 'do', 'budgetary', 'reasons', 'As', 'far', 'animatronics', 'go', 'are', 'decent', 'close', 'up', 'shots', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'shots', 'show', 'whole', 'doll', 'moving/walking', ""n't"", 'always', 'look', 'so', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'animation', 'pure', 'mechanical', 'CGI', 'was', 'used', 'as', 'well', 'again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'budget', 'limited', 'degree', 'were', 'thought', 'were', 'way', 'look', 'Chucky', 'when', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'explained', 'movie', 'so', 'be', 'patient', 'Overall', 'good', 'film', 'new', 'life', 'franchise', 'really', 'suffered', 'years', 'Too', 'bad', 'Don', 'Mancini', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'doing', 'one', 'decade', 'so', 'earlier', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bigger', 'budget', 'one', 'theatrical', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'However', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'do', 'well', 'draw', 'enough', 'interest', 'future', 'sequels', 'hopefully', 'more', 'resources', 'work']",N/A

Wait? There aren't any new horror in theaters. What kind of Halloween season is this? Well be that as it may, I suppose the next best thing to do is see what hitting the shelves; and there just so happens be a particular horror name hitting dvd/blu-ray front.This icon has not been seen since 2004, but the killer doll Chucky lives again in the direct-to-dvd film : Curse of Chucky. The studio behind the Child's Play franchise thought it would be best to reboot the series, but in the end, they decided to bring everyone's favorite killer doll to the small screen; but does this new film revitalized the 80's horror classic?For those who are wondering, Curse of Chucky is a sequel to Seed of Chucky (don't worry, the film doesn't talk about that movie). Anyways, one day a mysterious package arrives at the door of the handicapped Nica and her mother Sara. When Sara is killed in the night, Nica's sister and her family arrive to handle Sara's affair. During their stay, Sara's daughter Alice befriends what was in the box, and that was a doll named Chucky; and where Chucky is, chaos is sure to follow.Though this film is a direct-to-DVD, the story is a good continuation to Child's Play. My only gripe with the plot is how it is handled. The story itself is interesting, but the pacing is too quick. It felt like I was watching a short film found online. Yet, what the story lacks in pacing it makes up in intrigue. Curse of Chucky's story bring the series full circle; something I never expect to see in a movie like this.For a horror film, Curse of Chucky was surprising in its characters and performances. Fiona Dourif certainly stole the show as Nica. Fiona played a different kind of horror protagonist, and I hope we see more of these characters in the future. The other show stealer was none other then Fiona's father, Brad Dourif, who reprises his role as Chucky. He may not have had a lot of lines; but hearing Brad as Chucky is nothing but nostalgic as the character has not lost his muster. While the rest of the cast was not as strong as the Dourifs, Curse of Chucky still has an impressive ensemble; or at least these characters had a purpose for being in this movie. It is step from what we see in so many horror films these days.I've never been a fan of straight-to-dvd content (unless the film has DC Comics attached to it), but I have to say the quality of Curse of Chucky is worthy of the silver screen. While the cinematography is simple, it still effective capturing the horror that Child's Play was known for. Speaking of horror, while you can see most of the scares coming, there is an atmosphere to Curse of Chucky; which only helps the jump scares.In horror film, we often looks at the scenes that frighten us. Yet in the case of this film, I think the best scene was the dinner sequence. This scene did not rely on scares, but suspense as Chucky put rat poison in the chili and you wondered who the lucky person going home dead.While I'm not a major fan of direct-to-dvd films, I have to tip my hat to Curse of Chucky. Rather then feeling like the filmmakers were trying to get a quick buck, the movie felt like legitimate horror film worthy of the Chucky franchise. While there are some issues with the movie, Curse of Chucky is still a must see for any fan of the series.Also read the review here: [...]",4,A Worthy Entry Only $20,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,3463,"['Halloween', 'right', 'corner', 'what', 'better', 'thing', 'do', 'then', 't', 'review', 'latest', 'horror', 'film', 'hitting', 'silver', 'screen', 'Wait', 'are', ""n't"", 'new', 'horror', 'theaters', 'What', 'kind', 'Halloween', 'season', 'Well', 'be', 'may', 'suppose', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'see', 'what', 'hitting', 'shelves', 'just', 'so', 'happens', 'be', 'particular', 'horror', 'name', 'hitting', 'dvd/blu-ray', 'front.This', 'icon', 'not', 'been', 'seen', '2004', 'killer', 'doll', 'Chucky', 'again', 'direct-to-dvd', 'film', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'studio', 'Child', 'Play', 'franchise', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'reboot', 'series', 'end', 'decided', 'bring', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'killer', 'doll', 'small', 'screen', 'new', 'film', 'revitalized', '80', 'horror', 'classic', 'who', 'are', 'wondering', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'sequel', 'Seed', 'Chucky', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'film', ""n't"", 'talk', 'movie', 'Anyways', 'one', 'day', 'mysterious', 'package', 'door', 'handicapped', 'Nica', 'mother', 'Sara', 'When', 'Sara', 'killed', 'night', 'Nica', 'sister', 'family', 'arrive', 'handle', 'Sara', 'affair', 'stay', 'Sara', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'what', 'was', 'box', 'was', 'doll', 'named', 'Chucky', 'where', 'Chucky', 'chaos', 'sure', 'follow.Though', 'film', 'direct-to-DVD', 'story', 'good', 'continuation', 'Child', 'Play', 'only', 'gripe', 'plot', 'how', 'handled', 'story', 'interesting', 'pacing', 'too', 'quick', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'short', 'film', 'found', 'online', 'what', 'story', 'pacing', 'up', 'intrigue', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'story', 'bring', 'series', 'full', 'circle', 'something', 'never', 'expect', 'see', 'movie', 'this.For', 'horror', 'film', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'was', 'surprising', 'characters', 'performances', 'Fiona', 'Dourif', 'certainly', 'stole', 'show', 'Nica', 'Fiona', 'played', 'different', 'kind', 'horror', 'protagonist', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'characters', 'future', 'other', 'show', 'stealer', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'then', 'Fiona', 'father', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'who', 'role', 'Chucky', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'lines', 'hearing', 'Brad', 'Chucky', 'nothing', 'character', 'not', 'lost', 'muster', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'Dourifs', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'still', 'impressive', 'ensemble', 'least', 'characters', 'had', 'purpose', 'being', 'movie', 'step', 'what', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'days.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'straight-to-dvd', 'content', 'film', 'DC', 'Comics', 'attached', 'have', 'say', 'quality', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'worthy', 'silver', 'screen', 'cinematography', 'simple', 'still', 'effective', 'capturing', 'horror', 'Child', 'Play', 'was', 'known', 'Speaking', 'horror', 'can', 'see', 'most', 'scares', 'coming', 'atmosphere', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'only', 'jump', 'scares.In', 'horror', 'film', 'often', 'scenes', 'frighten', 'case', 'film', 'think', 'best', 'scene', 'was', 'dinner', 'sequence', 'scene', 'did', 'not', 'rely', 'scares', 'suspense', 'Chucky', 'put', 'rat', 'poison', 'chili', 'wondered', 'who', 'lucky', 'person', 'going', 'home', 'dead.While', ""'m"", 'not', 'major', 'fan', 'direct-to-dvd', 'films', 'have', 'tip', 'hat', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'Rather', 'then', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'quick', 'buck', 'movie', 'felt', 'legitimate', 'horror', 'film', 'worthy', 'Chucky', 'franchise', 'are', 'issues', 'movie', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'still', 'must', 'see', 'fan', 'series.Also', 'read', 'review', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A

Hence the reason that The Child&#8217;s Play series has just never done it for me.  It&#8217;s a DOLL!  It&#8217;s a three-foot tall doll!  Anyway, Chucky makes his for the sixth installment of the series in a story set four years after the events of the previous film, Seed of Chucky.  The Chucky doll arrives in a mysterious package at the home of wheelchair-bound Nica and her mother, Sarah.  Sarah tosses the doll into the trash but she dies later that night and the doll is found inside the home.The following day Nica&#8217;s sister Barb arrives with her husband Ian, daughter Alice, and live-in nanny, Jill to comfort the grieving Nica&#8230;and tell her they plan on moving her into an assisted living home and sell her house.  Nice.  When the family priest comes over for dinner, Chucky makes his first murderous move by pouring rat poison into a bowl of chili.  Throughout dinner we watch each member carefully trying to figure out which one got the tainted food.  It&#8217;s virtually the film&#8217;s only suspenseful moment.In between Chucky beginning his murderous rampage and attempting to possess the body of little Alice, we learn that Barb is actually having an affair with the nanny in a modern, PC twist to the usual husband banging the nanny.  It&#8217;s all very tiresome and dull and offers nothing new.

One day a package shows up and they are surprised to see a doll inside. After Nica's mother is found dead the rest of her family shows up and little by little others are found dead. Nica has her suspicions about the little doll but no one believes her. I have to admit that I do like the Child's Play series. The original is cheesy and fun to watch. Little by little they got more and more cheesy ultimately leading to Jennifer Tilly making fun of herself. What they did realize though is the cheesier they got the more humor they added in to make it more fun to watch. That said I was looking forward to seeing this one. Since it seems like all 80's movies are getting sequels this one was next on the list. Hopefully the fact that this is straight to video will convince them to stop. While this isn't terrible this installment is just very slow movie and boring. They went more serious with this one and I think that may have hurt the enjoyment of it. It could have been just my expectations of this but I found it really hard to get into. In order to get most of the little flashbacks and some plot points in this you do have to see all the others first. On the other hand re-watching all the others will show you just how bad this one is. Overall, disappointing, very disappointing. I give it a C+.",2,The next 80's series to get a sequel.

The latest (and first straight-to-video) entry takes the premise of a killing doll rather seriously, with several 1980s-ish gory scenes. That means no more jokes of the last two sequels &#8220;Bride of Chucky&#8221; and &#8220;Seed of Chucky.&#8221;Once again, we meet &#8220;Chucky,&#8221; a doll possessed by an evil soul of a serial killer. Brad Dourif provides the voice and also reprises the role of Charles Lee Ray. This time Chucky is sent to Sarah (Chantal Quesnelle), mother of a young woman Nica (Fiona Dourif). Next morning someone is found dead.When Nica&#8217;s sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti) and her family arrive, you know what happens next. The problem is the film&#8217;s pacing, which flags here and there, especially in the first half of the film. Still, toward the end the film picks up the pace, with a few interesting twists and post-credits scene.&#8220;Curse of Chucky&#8221; is a decent horror movie, throwback to the old slasher films, but don&#8217;t expect big scares or over-the-top killings here.",3,"I'm Chucky, Wanna Play: Going Back to the Roots as a Slasher Horror",1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1163,"['Written', 'directed', 'franchise', 'creator', 'Don', 'Mancini', '8220', 'Curse', 'Chucky', '8221', 'back', 'origin', 'slasher', 'horror', 'movie', 'latest', 'first', 'straight-to-video', 'entry', 'premise', 'killing', 'doll', 'rather', 'seriously', 'several', '1980s-ish', 'gory', 'scenes', 'more', 'jokes', 'last', 'two', 'sequels', '8220', 'Bride', 'Chucky', '8221', '8220', 'Seed', 'Chucky.', '8221', 'Once', 'again', 'meet', '8220', 'Chucky', '8221', 'doll', 'possessed', 'evil', 'soul', 'serial', 'killer', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'voice', 'also', 'role', 'Charles', 'Lee', 'Ray', 'time', 'Chucky', 'sent', 'Sarah', 'Chantal', 'Quesnelle', 'mother', 'young', 'woman', 'Nica', 'Fiona', 'Dourif', 'Next', 'morning', 'someone', 'found', 'Nica', '8217', 'sister', 'Barb', 'Danielle', 'Bisutti', 'family', 'arrive', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'problem', 'film', '8217', 'pacing', 'flags', 'here', 'there', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Still', 'end', 'film', 'up', 'pace', 'few', 'interesting', 'twists', 'post-credits', 'scene.', '8220', 'Curse', 'Chucky', '8221', 'decent', 'horror', 'movie', 'throwback', 'old', 'slasher', 'films', 'don', '8217', 'expect', 'big', 'scares', 'over-the-top', 'killings', 'here']",N/A

1661342,A2VYWLTNR8JORA,B00DTPRZ0G,what could have been,"[0, 0]","I must admit that I am not a huge fan of the Child's Play franchise. The first film scared the crap out of me (child of the 80's here), but it all got pretty silly after that (not that a voodoo possessed doll is a serious premise to begin with, but I digress...).Anyway, I've casually watched the plethora of sequels since. Much like the latter films of the Nightmare on Elm franchise, they took a turn for self parody and camp. Camp is fine and good, but it is an acquired taste. I understand that CP has an audience. I can only give casual accounts of the franchise of a whole because I've never been very invested in it.That said, I was not expecting an iota of horror goodness from this film. Initially rumored to be a REMAKE, Curse of Chucky works as a tidy little tie in film that explains the franchise from beginning to end (for the most part). In fact, I think the approach is EXTREMLY smart: instead of a true blue ""remake,"" this film works as a back to basics revamping (or laying to rest, depending on your view) of the series. Again: extremely surprised and pleased by the intelligent choices made here. Bringing Brad Dourif back and casting his daughter Fiona as the handicapped protagonist= brilliant moves.Moreover, this movie--while far from brilliant or ""film of the year""--has more suspense in it and clever pacing than most horror movies released in the last few years. Some of the humor of the series remains in tact, as well as one liners from Chucky, but the device is used sparingly. Curse of Chucky is a darker film than its predecessors and takes itself as seriously as it can (and this is a good thing).I would highly recommend this film to the diehard CP fan as well as the casual viewer. If you liked the first film, then I doubt that you won't at least appreciate this one for what it is.Recap: spooky staging/set, great pacing, FX (gore is great), acting (better than average for the genre), THOUGHTFUL script/ clever and creative use of back story.Ps- Be sure to watch the movie in its entirety, credits and all. There is a cute cameo at the end. I won't give away, but longtime fans will appreciate it, as well as genre fans who attend horror conventions.",4,Pleasantly surprised with this tie in/final chapter (?) !,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,2188,"['must', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Child', 'Play', 'franchise', 'first', 'film', 'scared', 'crap', 'child', '80', 'here', 'got', 'pretty', 'silly', 'not', 'voodoo', 'possessed', 'doll', 'serious', 'premise', 'begin', 'digress', '.Anyway', ""'ve"", 'casually', 'watched', 'plethora', 'sequels', 'Much', 'latter', 'films', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'franchise', 'took', 'turn', 'self', 'parody', 'camp', 'Camp', 'fine', 'good', 'acquired', 'taste', 'understand', 'CP', 'audience', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'casual', 'accounts', 'franchise', 'whole', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'very', 'invested', 'it.That', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'iota', 'horror', 'goodness', 'film', 'Initially', 'rumored', 'be', 'REMAKE', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'tidy', 'little', 'tie', 'film', 'franchise', 'beginning', 'end', 'most', 'part', 'fact', 'think', 'approach', 'EXTREMLY', 'smart', 'instead', 'true', 'blue', 'remake', 'film', 'back', 'basics', 'revamping', 'laying', 'rest', 'depending', 'view', 'series', 'Again', 'extremely', 'surprised', 'pleased', 'intelligent', 'choices', 'made', 'here', 'Bringing', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'back', 'casting', 'daughter', 'Fiona', 'handicapped', 'protagonist=', 'brilliant', 'moves.Moreover', 'movie', 'far', 'brilliant', 'film', 'year', 'more', 'suspense', 'clever', 'pacing', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'released', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'humor', 'series', 'tact', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'liners', 'Chucky', 'device', 'used', 'sparingly', 'Curse', 'Chucky', 'darker', 'film', 'predecessors', 'as', 'seriously', 'can', 'good', 'thing', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'diehard', 'CP', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'casual', 'viewer', 'liked', 'first', 'film', 'then', 'doubt', 'wo', ""n't"", 'least', 'appreciate', 'one', 'what', 'spooky', 'staging/set', 'great', 'pacing', 'FX', 'gore', 'great', 'acting', 'better', 'average', 'genre', 'THOUGHTFUL', 'script/', 'clever', 'creative', 'use', 'back', 'story.Ps-', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'movie', 'entirety', 'credits', 'cute', 'cameo', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'longtime', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'as', 'well', 'genre', 'fans', 'who', 'attend', 'horror', 'conventions']",N/A
