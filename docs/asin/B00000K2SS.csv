I was pleased to discover a taut little noir picture about a down-and-out ex-marine (Nicolas Cage) looking for employment in the wrong town. What ensues is a winding story involving murder for hire and a femme fatale. Cage and Boyle put in solid performances and Hopper is vaguely creepy as usual. I liked the pacing of this movie; it kept up the tension without overdoing it. With crazy twists and some laughs it kept me interested the whole time despite being occasionally formulaic. Too bad this movie was overlooked by the public, I advise you not to make the same mistake.",4,Don't miss this one too.....,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,677,"['had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'much', 'film', 'nothing', 'fact', 'when', 'stumbled', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'pleased', 'discover', 'taut', 'little', 'noir', 'picture', 'down-and-out', 'ex-marine', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'looking', 'employment', 'wrong', 'town', 'What', 'winding', 'story', 'involving', 'murder', 'hire', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Cage', 'Boyle', 'put', 'solid', 'performances', 'Hopper', 'vaguely', 'creepy', 'usual', 'liked', 'pacing', 'movie', 'kept', 'up', 'tension', 'overdoing', 'crazy', 'twists', 'laughs', 'kept', 'interested', 'whole', 'time', 'being', 'occasionally', 'formulaic', 'Too', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'overlooked', 'public', 'advise', 'not', 'make', 'same', 'mistake']",N/A

Michael arrives at a construction site to file a job application. His bad leg disqualifies him. [Insurance regulations?] He stops at a gas station for fuel, and gets a tip on work in Red Rock, the next small town. He walks into a bar, Wayne thinks he is Lyle from Dalla. Wayne advises him to make it look like a simple robbery. &#8220;You know what to do.&#8221; Its about Wayne&#8217;s wife. [This fits the pattern.] &#8220;Lyle&#8221; learns why Suzanne goes riding! &#8220;Its an awful lot of money.&#8221; &#8220;Love does strange things to people&#8221; she says, and makes a counter offer. Driving in the rain at night he hit a man in the road! He carries this man to the local hospital ER. This man was shot twice in the stomach! The Sheriff arrives. [Another surprise!] Can they forget about the whole deal? There is another surprise!The shooting says this is serious business now. Mike gets a ride from a passing car. Is he lucky? This driver offers a beer and a ride to Mike. What a coincidence! Mike escapes from the murderous pair. He has a story to explain his presence, and gets a ride to a ranch. We learn who was shot in the road! [No arms in that rural house?] Lyle hears the running bath water and goes to investigate. Another surprise! The Sheriff asks his Deputies to find the escaped prisoner; no APB. Wayne&#8217;s wife inherited money, her death would make her spouse a rich man. She offers thanks to Michael. [Her Guardian Angel?] &#8220;We&#8217;re not in Texas.&#8221; [Shouldn&#8217;t they have scooted out of this county and state?] Suzanne has a plan to get the money so they can go to Mexico; Mike agrees. She knows the combination to the safe in the floor. There are papers with the money there. Then Wayne shows up. The Deputies show up with bad news for Wayne. They question Wayne over the shooting of Kirk! [What a lucky brake!] Suzanne offers a deal to Michael. But there is another surprise here.Lyle returns to a house and warms it up. Then he returns to the Sheriff&#8217;s Office and starts to bargain with Wayne. They leave for a new destination. Lyle loves his Scotch whiskey, which loosens his tongue and inhibitions. They arrive at a graveyard to dig for buried treasure. Lyle talks to Wayne, &#8220;fair is fair&#8221;. Wayne has a trick too. There is a shot, then a fight. Then a call the Sheriff. The fight between Lyle and Wayne is ended by a statue. Suzanne acts against Lyle as well. The sirens in the distance announce the ending, Can they catch a train? Suzanne says its all about the money. &#8220;Go get it.&#8221; says Michael. There is an ironic ending to this story of greed.This story can be criticized for its characters, but this is a lesson about the logical conclusion for various crimes. Some parts may seem implausible, but this is a drama and not a true crime story. You can compare it to the classic crime stories of the 1940s. The obvious lesson is to avoid people with bad characters in your self-interest.",5,Crime in a Small Rural Town,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,3110,"['Red', 'Rock', 'West', '1994', 'filmA', 'car', 'parked', 'highway', 'Route', '487', 'Wyoming', 'driver', 'day', 'slept', 'car', 'Michael', 'construction', 'site', 'file', 'job', 'application', 'bad', 'leg', '[', 'Insurance', 'regulations', 'gas', 'station', 'fuel', 'tip', 'work', 'Red', 'Rock', 'next', 'small', 'town', 'bar', 'Wayne', 'Lyle', 'Dalla', 'Wayne', 'make', 'look', 'simple', 'robbery', '8220', 'know', 'what', 'do.', '8221', 'Wayne', '8217', 's', 'wife', '[', 'pattern', ']', '8220', 'Lyle', '8221', 'why', 'Suzanne', 'riding', '8220', 'awful', 'lot', 'money.', '8221', '8220', 'Love', 'strange', 'things', 'people', '8221', 'counter', 'offer', 'Driving', 'rain', 'night', 'hit', 'man', 'road', 'man', 'local', 'hospital', 'ER', 'man', 'was', 'shot', 'twice', 'stomach', 'Sheriff', '[', 'surprise', ']', 'Can', 'forget', 'whole', 'deal', 'surprise', 'shooting', 'serious', 'business', 'now', 'Mike', 'ride', 'passing', 'car', 'lucky', 'driver', 'beer', 'ride', 'Mike', 'What', 'coincidence', 'Mike', 'murderous', 'pair', 'story', 'explain', 'presence', 'ride', 'ranch', 'learn', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'road', '[', 'arms', 'rural', 'house', ']', 'Lyle', 'running', 'bath', 'water', 'investigate', 'surprise', 'Sheriff', 'Deputies', 'find', 'escaped', 'prisoner', 'APB', 'Wayne', '8217', 's', 'wife', 'inherited', 'money', 'death', 'would', 'make', 'spouse', 'rich', 'man', 'thanks', 'Michael', '[', 'Guardian', 'Angel', ']', '8220', '8217', 'not', 'Texas.', '8221', '[', 'Shouldn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'scooted', 'county', 'state', ']', 'Suzanne', 'plan', 'get', 'money', 'can', 'go', 'Mexico', 'Mike', 'combination', 'safe', 'floor', 'are', 'papers', 'money', 'there', 'Then', 'Wayne', 'up', 'Deputies', 'show', 'up', 'bad', 'news', 'Wayne', 'question', 'Wayne', 'shooting', 'Kirk', '[', 'What', 'lucky', 'brake', ']', 'Suzanne', 'deal', 'Michael', 'surprise', 'here.Lyle', 'returns', 'house', 'warms', 'up', 'Then', 'Sheriff', '8217', 's', 'Office', 'bargain', 'Wayne', 'leave', 'new', 'destination', 'Lyle', 'Scotch', 'whiskey', 'tongue', 'inhibitions', 'arrive', 'graveyard', 'dig', 'buried', 'treasure', 'Lyle', 'talks', 'Wayne', '8220', 'fair', 'fair', '8221', 'Wayne', 'trick', 'too', 'shot', 'then', 'fight', 'Then', 'call', 'Sheriff', 'fight', 'Lyle', 'Wayne', 'ended', 'statue', 'Suzanne', 'Lyle', 'as', 'well', 'sirens', 'distance', 'announce', 'ending', 'Can', 'catch', 'train', 'Suzanne', 'money', '8220', 'Go', 'get', 'it.', '8221', 'Michael', 'ironic', 'ending', 'story', 'greed.This', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'criticized', 'characters', 'lesson', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'various', 'crimes', 'parts', 'may', 'seem', 'implausible', 'drama', 'not', 'true', 'crime', 'story', 'can', 'compare', 'classic', 'crime', 'stories', '1940s', 'obvious', 'lesson', 'avoid', 'people', 'bad', 'characters', 'self-interest']",N/A

When he doesn't get the job, Mike finds himself down to his last few dollars, with no prospects on the horizon.  That all changes when he goes into a bar--looking for work--in the little town of Red Rock, Wyoming.Desperate for any kind of employment, Mike takes advantage of a case of mistaken identity when the bar owner, Wayne (the late great J.T. Walsh), asks him if he is there ""for the job.""  Expecting a job as bartender, Mike is horrified to find he has been hired as a assassin to kill Wayne's wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle).  Mike decides to keep Wayne's money but has no intention of honoring the contract.Stopping on his way out of town to warn Suzanne of her husband's plan, Mike finds her willing to double the contract price if he agrees to kill Wayne.  Figuring that he has landed in a nest of vipers, Mike writes a letter to the sheriff and plans to 'get the hell out of Dodge' when fate intervenes yet again in the form of a traffic accident.  The basically decent Mike takes the man who stumbled in front of his car to the Emergency Room only to find that the man was not only hit by his car but was shot as well.  A world of trouble opens up for Mike when the real contract killer, Lyle (Dennis Hopper), finally shows up.  What follows are a series of abortive attempts by Mike to leave town--only to be thwarted by chance and circumstance.""Red Rock West"" has a hard luck hero, a beautiful and bad-to-the-bone femme fatale, and enough treachery, betrayal, layered suspense, plot twists and duplicitous characters to satisfy any hardcore classic noir film fan.  The eerie deep shadows of classic noir have been replaced by panoramic views of Wyoming's barren sagebrush wastelands.  The soundtrack is supplied by such country greats as Johnny Cash, Dwight Yoakam (who also has a small cameo role) and Shania Twain.This is a 'no frills' DVD without a single extra.  It didn't really matter to me though as the movie itself was so outstanding and the transfer was quite good.  Along with such modern day classics as ""Blood Simple"" and ""Kill Me Again,"" ""Red Rock West"" is one of the best examples of the neo-noir crime film.",5,"""I hate to see an innocent woman get hurt, but it's an awful lot of money.""",1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,2489,"['was', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'elements', 'classic', 'film', 'noir', 'worked', 'when', 'combined', 'contemporary', 'western', 'surprising', 'little', 'thriller', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'written', 'directed', 'John', 'Dahl.Mike', 'Williams', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'likeable', 'down', 'luck', 'Gulf', 'War', 'vet', 'looking', 'work', 'roughneck', 'oilfield', 'Big', 'Sky', 'Country', 'When', ""n't"", 'get', 'job', 'Mike', 'down', 'last', 'few', 'dollars', 'prospects', 'horizon', 'changes', 'when', 'bar', 'looking', 'work', 'little', 'town', 'Red', 'Rock', 'Wyoming.Desperate', 'kind', 'employment', 'Mike', 'advantage', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'when', 'bar', 'owner', 'Wayne', 'late', 'great', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'there', 'job', 'Expecting', 'job', 'bartender', 'Mike', 'horrified', 'find', 'been', 'hired', 'assassin', 'kill', 'Wayne', 'wife', 'Suzanne', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Mike', 'keep', 'Wayne', 'money', 'intention', 'honoring', 'contract.Stopping', 'way', 'town', 'warn', 'Suzanne', 'husband', 'plan', 'Mike', 'willing', 'double', 'contract', 'price', 'kill', 'Wayne', 'Figuring', 'landed', 'nest', 'vipers', 'Mike', 'letter', 'sheriff', 'plans', ""'get"", 'hell', 'Dodge', 'when', 'fate', 'intervenes', 'yet', 'again', 'form', 'traffic', 'accident', 'basically', 'decent', 'Mike', 'man', 'who', 'stumbled', 'front', 'car', 'Emergency', 'Room', 'only', 'find', 'man', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'hit', 'car', 'was', 'shot', 'as', 'well', 'world', 'trouble', 'up', 'Mike', 'when', 'real', 'contract', 'killer', 'Lyle', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'finally', 'up', 'What', 'are', 'series', 'abortive', 'attempts', 'Mike', 'leave', 'town', 'only', 'be', 'thwarted', 'chance', 'circumstance', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'hard', 'luck', 'hero', 'beautiful', 'bad-to-the-bone', 'femme', 'fatale', 'enough', 'treachery', 'betrayal', 'layered', 'suspense', 'plot', 'twists', 'duplicitous', 'characters', 'satisfy', 'hardcore', 'classic', 'noir', 'film', 'fan', 'eerie', 'deep', 'shadows', 'classic', 'noir', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'panoramic', 'views', 'Wyoming', 'barren', 'sagebrush', 'wastelands', 'soundtrack', 'supplied', 'such', 'country', 'greats', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'who', 'also', 'small', 'cameo', 'role', 'Shania', 'Twain.This', ""'no"", 'frills', 'DVD', 'single', 'extra', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'outstanding', 'transfer', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'such', 'modern', 'day', 'classics', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'Kill', 'Me', 'Again', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'neo-noir', 'crime', 'film']",N/A

This reminded me so much of the noir ""After Dark, My Sweet"", except there really isn't any love story.  But the small town atmosphere, the drifter caught up, mostly because of a woman, the crazy bad guy, the greed-lust for money, the bedroom scene, are all there in both.  This one had far more plot turns and twists, and was almost comic in its relentless violence.  It was definitely a film noir, almost all scenes were at night, even in a graveyard.  I was definitely caught up in this movie and many of the plot turns took me by surprise.  Shot in Wyoming, the scenery was generally stark and bare in the few daylight scenes.

It's my understanding that this was originally a movie done for HBO or one of the other cable giants, but it has the feel of a movie I would have seen years ago at an art-house theater.Nicholas Cage - and I'm not much of a fan - drives his landliner of a Caddy out to an oil rig in the remote American West on the promise of a job by a buddy already working there. The rig boss turns him down upon learning of Cage's character's bum leg, the result of a military injury. Left high and dry, Cage's character, Michael, cruises into Red Rock on fumes, willing to do almost anything for work. He inadvertently accepts a job, the nature of which is vague, and is horrified to discover that he is expected to bump off a cheating wife.It's important to note here that Red Rock, a blip on the map, is essentially run by the sheriff of the town, in true Old West fashion. Saying too much here would ruin some of the excellent twists, but suffice it to say that Michael becomes the unwitting lynchpin that ties together all the nasty elements - a basically good guy caught between a bunch of slimeballs.There are a number of neat bits - Michael drives in and out of town past the city-limits sign so many times I kept looking for the population notation on the sign to change - and some priceless roles. Dennis Hopper saved ""Waterworld"" from a totally watery grave; if this movie was bad, he would have done the same thing, but he just adds to this one, at his maniac best and clearly enjoying every minute. Lara Flynn Boyle, as the femme fatale, ceased having much effect on my regard after Twin Peaks; she does OK here, but I did question Michael's continued involvement with her when she is such obvious bad news. J.T. Walsh plays pretty much his regular bad-guy role. The real treat for me is quite minor - a cameo by Dwight Yoakam that makes me smile every time I see it. (He also sings the theme at the end.)  One scene at a bar, where Michael is trying to escape from a hit man, has me on the edge even though I know what's going to happen.For a movie that nobody seems to have heard of, it has a lot going on. And at the end, everybody has gotten just what they deserve.

Getting a tip from a man in a gas station, he heads to a town called Red Rock into a small bar, where the owner inadvertently gives him a job as a hit man who is supposed to kill his wife. Before Michael (Cage) can say no to the man, he is handed a wad of money and instructions on how to kill the bar owner's wife.What makes this unknown thriller such a great movie is the feeling of mystery it projects. Like many other reviewers said, this film feels like a noir mystery in a western setting. Just when you think you have a piece of the plot figured out in your head, there is another twist. Cage's character plays the only truly noble character, as all characters have motives and hidden secrets that keep you guessing.This film didn't get much publicity when it was released, and I just happened to catch this title on the shelf of the video store years later. I remembered liking it before, so I had to watch again. It was even better the second time. Another great thing about this film is that there is a smart angle in presenting the mystery.

All you need is a smart script, good actors and loads of atmosphere. RRW delivers all these and more.Nic Cage plays an ex-marine, injured in Lebanon, who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee. He roles into Red Rock and is mistaken by bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not quite as his most menacing-but still evil) for a hit-man from Texas.He pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary. Only when he gets there, just to check her out. She offers him double to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be. But a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo-yoing in and out of Red Rock, back and forth. Eventually this leads to a run-in with Lyle from Dallas (a cheeky and somehow sympathetic Dennis Hopper), the REAL hit-man from Texas who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated.RRW never had a big release, thus most of it's audience discovered it on video or on cable TV showings. Viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a TV movie but it's bigger than that. The slick, slowly-timed direction, moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the DVD on a big HDTV.The only weak point of the movie I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke-ish hairdo.

The door opens and Michael slowly slides from the front seat where he had been sleeping. Only just awake, he puts a brace on his bum leg, walks around to the trunk where he takes out a pair of jeans. In jeans and a t-shirt, he does a few push-ups, puts on a clean shirt, combs his hair and practices a few ""hi, how-are-you's."" Michael, played by Nicolas Cage, is an unemployed ex-marine who's just driven from Texas to Wyoming with the promise of a job on a drilling crew. But he's too honest to hide his leg from the crew boss and is turned away. And after having spent his last $5 on gas, Michael wanders into Red Rock, Pop. 874, enters a bar and asks for a cup of coffee. The owner, Wayne, seeing his Texas plates, mistakes him for someone he's hired long-distance to come kill his wife Suzanne. In a series of misunderstandings, Michael leaves the bar with $5000 in cash and only a half-knowledge of what he's going to do next. He finally decides to visit and warn the wife, who, in turn, offers him $10,000 to murder her husband. Michael takes the money but with the sole intention of running. Unfortunately, Michael finds that, as hard and fast as he runs, he is forever returning--whether wittingly or unwittingly--to Red Rock West. He has fallen into a kind of maze whose every turn serves only to reveal the deceiving promise of the previous turn. But that is the very engine for both the riveting intrigue and the eerie dark comedy that accompanies this fundamentally decent, world-weary soul whose honesty and benefit-of-the-doubt-granting credulity lead him through a succession of plot twists too numerous, unexpected and original to bear comparison with any contemporary wannabe.I won't tell you what happens next; it would be cinemaphile sacrilege to reveal the tricks behind the narrative magic that would otherwise have held you spellbound.

Michael escapes while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real killer,&quot;Lyle From Dallas&quot; (Dennis Hopper) who plays the role with murderous glee.After discovering that both he and Michael are former marines, Lyle insists on buying him a drink at, where else, The Red Rock Bar.

Michael (Nicholas Cage) arrives in Wyoming with a promised job that doesn't pan out. Without money and low on gas, he heads into the town of Red Rock West. When Michael walks into a bar and is asked by the owner Wayne (the oily and late great J. T. Walsh)if he's there about the job, Michael does what anyone would do--he says yes. What he doesn't realize is that Wayne has mistaken him for a hitman he's hired sight unseen to kill his wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). Michael takes the $10,000, a key and heads up to Wayne's house. We're not really sure of his intentions all we do know is that he seemed like such a nice guy. When the real hit man Lyle (Dennis Hopper)shows up, things become more complicated as Michael has his money and Wayne's wife.A clever, well written and directed film noir thriller from John Dahl (""The Last Seduction"", ""Joy Ride""), ""Red Rock West"" became a cult classic on video when it was first released. The film also has enough quirks to remind me of the same qualities that made the Cohen Brothers' ""Blood Simple"" and David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" memorable as well. This film isn't like those films but has a distinctive personality and visits the same genre with typically comic/dramatic results.Although I didn't totally buy Cage as Michael, he does work his way into the role and does a convincing job. The supporting cast gives a terrific performance particularly J. T. Walsh, the underrated Timothy Carhart as his deputy and Lara Flynn Boyle. Dennis Hopper does a variation on ""Frank"" from Blue Velvet although his turn as Lyle is equally memorable I'm surprised he didn't spring for the role he was originally cast for that of Wayne (which Walsh plays to perfection).The image quality on the DVD is exceptionally good and the extras consist of a running commentary from both Director Dahl and his brother co-producer/co-writer Rick. It's full of fascinating tibits about the difficulty in shooting a film like this on location. It's a pity there's no commentary from Cage, Hopper or Boyle. We also get the theatrical trailer although, curiously, there's no featurette on the making of this terrific cult classic. I would love to see this reissued with a featurette on Walsh and with deleted/alternate scenes.
