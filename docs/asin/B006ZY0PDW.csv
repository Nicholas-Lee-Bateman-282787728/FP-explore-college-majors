The B-17s themselves are computer generated but the generation is for once done so well that it is sometimes possible to forget that it is being done.

1523807,A1BNTP7D2D32YP,B006ZY0PDW,Arvad,"[8, 19]","Let me begin by saying that it would have been a real pleasure to be able to give this film a rating of either four or five stars. Unfortunately, I think it's important to give an honest review of this type of film which involves both military and aviation history as well as film making.This is a military aviation history drama that makes extensive use of Computer Generated Imaging. CGI particularly lends itself to this genre due to the prohibitive costs involved in using actual equipment, either original or replicas, as well as the associated costs, insurance, safety hazards, etc. That said, CGI also allows the replication of actual incidents and events that would be extraordinarily dangerous to recreate.Another factor with the cuurent technoligical development of CGI is that it still doesn't look ""real"". This is not a problem as long as the film makers are able to present as accurate a representation as they can of the look and feel of the events and actions, that they wish to present to a viewer who would be intersted in this type of film.While the appearance of the Boeing B-17 bomber, the ""Fortress"" is very well done, in most of the scenes there is a minor innaccuracy in the takeoff film sequences. The film shows the fully loaded B-17 aircraft taking off with the speed, elegance and grace of a partially loaded fighter plane of that era. In reality, the word that best describes the takeoff of the fully loaded World War Two bomber is ""Labored"".The depictions of the bomber stream when the bombers encounter Flak are well done. During their approach to target the bombers are attacked by enemy fighter aircraft and the film producers got the sound effcts wrong. The film depicts the sound of the bombers fifty caliber defensive fire against the fighters accurately but the attacking fire of the fighters is all wrong. The later model Messerschmitt (BF-109F) fighters shown, like all of the 109 fighters, were equipped with either fifteen or twenty millimeter cannon, one in each wing. These weapons had a slightly slower rate of fire combined with a much louder and distinctive report as each round was fired. The airmen who flew the bombers have always spoken of being able, by sound alone, to know when an enemy aircraft was firing its' armament. This type of innaccuracy could still be excused if the rest of the film was true to life in its representation.The scene that is the real ""Howler"" occurs in that part of the film where the enemy gunfire flashes are shown. This scene also has an interception by Americam P-40 fighter aircraft of which more later. The scene shows the Luftwaffe aircraft using their smallest (7.62/.30 caliber) nose mounted machineguns to attack the bombers. Firstly, even if a german fighter pilot was literally able to attain 100% accuracy with these weapons, after firing all of his ammunition into a B-17 and having nothing left, the bomber would have proceeded onward as if nothing had happened. It would be like a single bee trying to drop an elephant. Secondly it was a not uncommon practice for Luftwaffe pilots to tell their ground crews not to put any ammunition in the nose guns as they were considered useless in aerial combat and the weight saving was a bigger positive for the overall performance of the fighter.In the interception scene the B-17 bomber crew, under attack by five BF-109 fighters, call for help from any American fighters in the area. Help arrives in the form of two P-40 fighter aircraft which, in the film, shoot down three of the enemy aircraft and drive the other two off. The P-40 was one of the main fighter aircraft that the U.S. went to war with, having been designed and in production before the war. Due to USAAF guidelines, the P-40 operated at low altitude (below 12,000 feet); above which its performance, in all regards, rapidly fell off. As a consequence it was used either for ground attack, against bombers operating at low level or against other aircraft that had equal or inferior flight characteristics. A more important factor was the qualitative difference between the P-40 and the BF-109. The BF was superior in speed, rate of climb, ability to operate at higher altitudes and firepower. In this latter case the P-40, being equipped with six .50 caliber machineguns had to get in closer in order to be able to hit the enemy aircraft while the BF-109 could stand off and fire at greater ranges due to its cannon armament. The P-40 was equal to the BF-109 in dive and superior to it in turns. In the real life situation depicted in the film the P-40s would have attempted to draw off the BF fighters using a series of feints and mock attacks, assuming the American pilots had some experience and training. Unless American pilots flying P-40s  had an overwhelming advantage in numbers at favorable altitude they would not have tangled with the Messerschmitts. Why the film makers did not depict the use of the P-51B or even P-47 as American fighters, which would have been more accurate and believable for this scene, escapes me.Overall this is a watchable film that suffers mostly from lack of research by the film makers.Correction to this review. In this review I call the B-17 a medium bomber. This is incorrect. It was originally envisaged as a bomber to replace the B-10 which was being recognized as a medium bomber due to aircraft development of that era. During the initial design stage it was decided to create a heavy bomber design rather than another medium bomber. The B-17 was the result of that process.I apologize for the error.",2,Embarrassingly Innaccurate,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,5550,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'real',

I had not seen any publicity for it and I follow movie releases fairly closely. It is apparently a low budget, independent production.  It is pretty ambitious for such a film.  To recreate the large bomber formations, fighter plane attacks and even the base camp it uses a lot of CGI.So, I have seen FORTRESS and I very much enjoyed it.  Sure, the visual effects are sometimes a bit crude, but most of the time they are pretty effective and certainly good enough to support the story.  I'd say the visual effects are a bit better than those in the TV series DOGFIGHTS (which were pretty good) but not up to the standards of RED TAILS (a high bar, IMO).  The movie was well written and I was impressed by the performances by the unknown (to me) cast.  For a movie made on a tiny fraction of most big studio movie budgets it is quite an accomplishment.Synopses of the story can be found on IMDb and if you haven't watched the trailer on YouTube, yet, do so.  If you like WW II movies, especially about the air war in Europe, I think you will like FORTRESS.I like this movie enough that I have pre-ordered the Blu-ray.

Still, the outside shots of the bombing missions and duels with German fighters are quite arresting in places, usually without the animation being too obvious.We're convincingly shown a great many technical details of WWII bomber flying here, and the way FORTRESS combines the gritty realism of today's war films with some of the endearingly corny plot elements of older films works quite well.The biggest weakness is that the central characters are rather flat and under-developed.

It is not 12 O-clock High.  If it wasn't for the music and the name on the plane, you'd never know the crew was suppose to be Irish.Speaking of credits, watch the credits until the end.

A good story line with decent acting and great CGI effects (way too short) but good!!!  I first saw this trailer as a movie coming out of Germany.....was shocked to see is was done in the USA.

Starring Bug Hall, Donnie Jeffcoat, Sean McGowan, and Manu Intiraymi, this movie tells the story of a B-17 bomber crew who, after losing their original commander in a raid over Sicily, find themselves having to deal with breaking in the replacement, a young pilot who has no clue how to fit in, and who seems to do everything wrong at first, alienating the men he's supposed to be commanding.The thing I loved most about this film is the acting.  The stars bring a freshness and vitality to the story that seems to be lacking in most big-budget Hollywood war epics, and they are the best and brightest of today's crop of young actors.  I definitely hope to see more from this bunch!The story was very good as well.  Some of the pranks that the Lucky Lass's crew pulled on their new commander (and each other) brought to mind some of the stories I used to hear from my father about his service in the Navy Seabees, and I spent a good amount of time watching Fortress and being just plain awestruck at how real the Lucky Lass and her crew felt to me because of the things they would do.All in all, Fortress was a wonderful movie, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone without hesitation.",5,"Awesome movie, one I would highly recommend",1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,1292,"['bought', 'Fortress', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'very', 'first', 'moment', 'was', 'hooked', 'Starring', 'Bug', 'Hall', 'Donnie', 'Jeffcoat', 'Sean', 'McGowan', 'Manu', 'Intiraymi', 'movie', 'story', 'B-17', 'bomber', 'crew', 'who', 'losing', 'original', 'commander', 'raid', 'Sicily', 'find', 'having', 'deal', 'breaking', 'replacement', 'young', 'pilot', 'who', 'clue', 'how', 'fit', 'who', 'do', 'everything', 'wrong', 'first', 'alienating', 'men', 'supposed', 'be', 'commanding.The', 'thing', 'loved', 'most', 'film', 'acting', 'stars', 'bring', 'freshness', 'vitality', 'story', 'be', 'lacking', 'most', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'war', 'epics', 'are', 'best', 'brightest', 'today', 'crop', 'young', 'actors', 'definitely', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'bunch', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'pranks', 'Lucky', 'Lass', 'crew', 'pulled', 'new', 'commander', 'other', 'brought', 'mind', 'stories', 'used', 'hear', 'father', 'service', 'Navy', 'Seabees', 'spent', 'good', 'amount', 'time', 'watching', 'Fortress', 'being', 'just', 'plain', 'awestruck', 'how', 'real', 'Lucky', 'Lass', 'crew', 'felt', 'things', 'would', 'do.All', 'Fortress', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'hesitation']",Fortress
