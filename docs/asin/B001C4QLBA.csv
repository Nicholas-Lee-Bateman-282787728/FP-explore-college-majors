He starts from the east and heads west, going north and south in the interim, all the while in his black London taxi cab.He visits rodeos, Native American tribes, gets some home cooked soul food, and visits the famous ""Mustang Ranch,"" goes swimming with the sharks, and ends up on top of a volcano, among other things. It's really entertaining and fascinating to watch as you'll discover things you never knew about America.If you enjoy travel shows and want to learn more about the USA, I highly recommend this DVD set.

Fry is such a fascinating person in his own right that his playing fictional characters often deprives the audience of his best asset, his real self.  That is on showcase here as Fry takes on a journey through the United States in a British taxicab.  His choices for stopping points are all his own and showcase his own wide ranging interests.  Unlike most documentary fare, this plays as if you are along on a personal odyssey with Stephen Fry and, as his friend, he is relating conversationally to you his thoughts and ideas about America as you travel to and around various points.  His choices for stopping points are all as unique as himself.  I wish Fry would do more of this kind of show rather than playing fictional characters such as Peter Kingdom and a PR man (as he did in another BBC series).

Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[0, 0]","This is a six-part series, one hour per episode, in which Stephen Fry visits every state in America, including Alaska and Hawaii. Inevitably, he can't spend long in each state, so really this is less a travel series than a chance to spend time with Mr. Fry. He's a congenial companion, with the ability to find interest in most things he sees. Although he touches on some of the famous sights, his focus is on out-of-the-way spots and unusual people. He, or more likely his crew, do a good job of finding locations and people that hold the attention when interviewed by the engaging Mr. Fry.Well, except for episode 5. I'm not sure what went wrong there, but in episode 5 he visits only 4 states (New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Nevada) and spends way too much time on rather dull subjects. The Mustang Ranch brothel has been shown many times before and playing a version of the old TV series 'The Mole' in Las Vegas with the Chippendale dancers really wasn't of any interest to anyone but the participants. The Mormon calendar shoot was no better. Had these been small segments in, say, a ten-state episode, then fair enough, but this was the one episode where longer segments were shown and it just wasn't very interesting. I'd have liked to have heard why the series took such a sharp change in direction there (and then went back to its former self in episode 6), but the set has no special features to explain what went into the making of the show.Four stars for 5 good episodes out of 6. If you want to see Stephen Fry in a 5-star series, check out 'Last Chance To See', filmed at the same time (the cast Fry wears on his arm in one episode of 'In America' was caused by a fall in 'Last Chance').

This would be perfect to be shown on PBS, but BBCAmerica will probably show it, wedged amongst the tabloid & ""reality"" TV that BBCAmerica has become infested with, and have more terrible commercials than program content. PBS will continue to show more Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, & Susan Powter infommercials instead of the type of programming that made its name. And the good news is buying a British DVD means you don't get all the stupid US previews and ads, plus one thing that I love about most Region 2 DVD's: no security seals.But this program was exactly what I expected, with Fry's wry & dry commentary, letting us come along as he crosses the US, in a left-hand drive English taxi, what most Yanks would call a ""London"" taxi. What I didn't expect was that he would actually bad-mouth certain places, the most glaring of which must remain nameless....but there was a TV show about it in the 80's with a couple of dicks named Tubbs & Crockett. One thing in that city that was fun was that Fry was dragged onto the dance floor, which is the first time I've seen him shake it since he was doing Dancercise on A Bit of Fry and Laurie - Seasons One & Two(""Dancercise is a combination of 'dance' and 'circumcise'""). Usually travel programs are all sweetness & light, but we see quite a few American warts. When visiting St. Louis, we just glimpse the Arch: it's never mentioned, but instead Fry spends the segment with a group of homeless...actually they're not homeless- their home is an abandoned factory.Far, far too much time was spent in Las Vegas, but I guess Mr Fry can be excused: his time was spent doing a ""team-building"" exercise with Chippendale dancers, & at a beefcake calendar shoot featuring Mormon men. And if I was going to send someone I like to Colorado, I certainly wouldn't send them to Aspen. Could have been worse, though, he could have gone to Vail. And unfortunately, it wasn't raining in Seattle, which is one cause he never mentioned when discussing the Jet City's high suicide rate.(Seattle is not #1 in suicides any longer....the city at the beginning of this paragraph is. Small wonder.)Like Bill Bryson and Michael Palin, Stephen Fry doesn't take himself too seriously, although he does show off his erudition while at the Mormon men photoshoot, and the man he's talking to basically says ""I have no idea what you just said.""The fact this is now available in the US is a good omen. Hopefully Fry's QI TV show may also become more readily available. That's a great show, but not stupid enough to be cloned by the powers who run American TV. QI is Quite Interesting, but for right now is just available out of the UK in Region 2 format, or a few clips on YouTube, but if you enjoy Stephen Fry, I highly recommend this, his podcast, and a program I just recently ran acrossKingdom: Series 1 (Region 2).

1174817,A2X22JBJXERVQD,B001C4QLBA,Sanity in SF,"[10, 20]","As a travelogue exploring the States, the show is simply too brief which means a largely superficial experience -- not just for the viewer, but more importantly for Stephen Fry. One sees no arc of development on his part: no deepening perspective, greater insight or growing affection as his journey goes on. The diversity of the US (historically, geographically, culturally, etc.) is really the star of the show and therefore makes for very interesting viewing.Sadly, Stephen Fry himself is one of the weaker elements of this adventure. Fry reveals himself to be quite the ""little Englander"" in his travels. In San Francisco, he refers to the 2 most renowned British exports to the US (a guy who invented the internet and the lead designer for Apple); Fry then asks the Apple designer from Britain why he thinks he and the internet guy both chose to settle in the US. His response: Because the US is characterized by a LACK of cynicism, and ideas are such fragile things, so this environment is a much better one for a creative person, a designer. That is the most ironic moment in the entire series because the Apple designer inadvertently points to what makes Stephen Fry's televised journey ultimately so unsatisfying.Everywhere he is met with generosity, kindness and American pride. Yet try as he might, his own cynicism and condescension keeps bursting through. The contrast with travelers like Michael Palin or Joe Cross is huge. I kept wishing for the deep compassion, affection and joy exhibited by Ken Burns' films or as seen in Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead even as Joe Cross interacted with lower class and morbidly obese Americans. At bottom, Fry is an uptight, prissy, judgmental upper-middle-class English snob who can't help using phrases about America as ""vulgar"", ""kitsch"", ""for all its flaws"", ""for good and for evil"", etc. which remain untempered by affection.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[45, 49]","I have just spent the last six hours watch a very personable (and quite funny) British television personality show me parts of America that I never knew existed. It sometime takes a person from overseas to show us things about ourselves and our culture (and our beautiful natural resources!) that we are too close to see.Stephen Fry explains, in the first few minutes of this FABULOUS six-part BBC series, that he was almost born in Princeton, NJ where his father lived for a while. He's always had a fascination with the US and so in 2008 he brought a real British taxicab here and drove to every one of the 50 states. (Well, that's what he says he did. In reality he covered 51, because the District of Columbia - where he stopped  - is not a ""state"", and he had to leave the taxi in Washington State and fly to both Alaska and Hawaii.. But who's griping? Not me! I don't know how long it took to film this journey but it was obviously 6 months or more. And I give lots of credit to the photographer and Directors John Paul Davidson and Michael Waldman, who are there capturing the beauty - as well as some eccentrics.The show aired on the BBC and was aimed at UK audiences so you'll hear a few curse words once in a while. And the section on Nevada visits the famous ""Mustang Ranch"" (where prostitution is legal) and parents may not want to share those moments with young children. But the rest makes great family viewing.The six hour-long episodes cover a different region. Fry starts in Maine and heads south. From the Deep South he heads to the Mississippi River and follows it all the way from Louisiana (visit to New Orleans after Katrina and to Angola State Penitentiary) to Michigan (Detroit auto industry). Then, the great Mountain States, The Southwest and finally, The Pacific. He visits famous tourist places of course but he gets to places you'd never see on your own. In Knoxville, TN there is a real ""body farm"". In Miami he visits a Senior Housing compound where he meets ""senior male escorts"". (The ratio is 10 women to one man!. He visits Kent State and discusses the massacre there, and in Chicago he gets a tour with blues man Buddy Guy.. The ""Mountains and Plains"" section includes a great interview with Ted Turner - who is America's largest private land owner - on one of his ranches and Fry joins him for a buffalo dinner. I really could go on and on about the highlights but that will destroy the fun!  Okay, a few states are just ""drive thru"" moments and Fry confuses the State of Delaware with the Delaware River between New Jersey and Pennsylvania when he crosses on the Cape May (NJ) to Lewes (Del) ferry and says that George Washington ""crossed the Delaware here in 1776"".Within minutes of the start you can't help but like Fry and bond with him. At the beginning of Episode Three we find him wearing an arm cast (!) but he never explains why its there and by the next few states, it's gone. And he does ask insightful questions of the people he visits.I can't recommend this set highly enough! I've even found a few new states I want to visit. This was a massive project to produce and I, for one, am glad that Fry allows all of us to join him on his journey!Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,The most engaging travelogue of America I remember seeing!,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,3225,"['have', 'just', 'spent', 'last', 'six', 'hours', 'watch', 'very', 'personable', 'quite', 'funny', 'British', 'television', 'personality', 'show', 'parts', 'America', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'sometime', 'person', 'overseas', 'show', 'things', 'ourselves', 'culture', 'beautiful', 'natural', 'resources', 'are', 'too', 'close', 'see.Stephen', 'Fry', 'explains', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'FABULOUS', 'six-part', 'BBC', 'series', 'was', 'almost', 'born', 'Princeton', 'NJ', 'where', 'father', 'lived', 'while', 'always', 'had', 'fascination', 'US', 'so', '2008', 'brought', 'real', 'British', 'taxicab', 'here', 'drove', 'one', '50', 'states', 'Well', 'what', 'did', 'reality', 'covered', '51', 'District', 'Columbia', 'where', 'stopped', 'not', 'state', 'had', 'leave', 'taxi', 'Washington', 'State', 'fly', 'Alaska', 'Hawaii..', 'who', 'griping', 'Not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'film', 'journey', 'was', 'obviously', '6', 'months', 'more', 'give', 'lots', 'credit', 'photographer', 'Directors', 'John', 'Paul', 'Davidson', 'Michael', 'Waldman', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'capturing', 'beauty', 'as', 'well', 'eccentrics.The', 'show', 'aired', 'BBC', 'was', 'aimed', 'UK', 'audiences', 'so', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'few', 'curse', 'words', 'once', 'while', 'section', 'Nevada', 'famous', 'Mustang', 'Ranch', 'where', 'prostitution', 'legal', 'parents', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'share', 'moments', 'young', 'children', 'rest', 'great', 'family', 'viewing.The', 'six', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'cover', 'different', 'region', 'Fry', 'Maine', 'heads', 'south', 'Deep', 'South', 'Mississippi', 'River', 'way', 'Louisiana', 'visit', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Katrina', 'Angola', 'State', 'Penitentiary', 'Michigan', 'Detroit', 'auto', 'industry', 'Then', 'great', 'Mountain', 'States', 'Southwest', 'finally', 'Pacific', 'famous', 'tourist', 'places', 'course', 'places', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'own', 'Knoxville', 'TN', 'real', 'body', 'farm', 'Miami', 'Senior', 'Housing', 'compound', 'where', 'senior', 'male', 'escorts', 'ratio', '10', 'women', 'one', 'man', 'Kent', 'State', 'massacre', 'there', 'Chicago', 'tour', 'blues', 'man', 'Buddy', 'Guy..', 'Mountains', 'Plains', 'section', 'great', 'interview', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'who', 'America', 'largest', 'private', 'land', 'owner', 'one', 'ranches', 'Fry', 'buffalo', 'dinner', 'really', 'could', 'go', 'highlights', 'will', 'destroy', 'fun', 'Okay', 'few', 'states', 'are', 'just', 'drive', 'thru', 'moments', 'Fry', 'State', 'Delaware', 'Delaware', 'River', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Pennsylvania', 'when', 'Cape', 'May', 'NJ', 'Lewes', 'Del', 'ferry', 'George', 'Washington', 'crossed', 'Delaware', 'here', '1776', '.Within', 'minutes', 'start', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Fry', 'bond', 'beginning', 'Episode', 'Three', 'find', 'wearing', 'arm', 'cast', 'never', 'why', 'next', 'few', 'states', 'gone', 'ask', 'insightful', 'questions', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'set', 'highly', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'even', 'found', 'few', 'new', 'states', 'want', 'visit', 'was', 'massive', 'project', 'produce', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'Fry', 'join', 'journey', 'Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Stephen Fry in America Region 2
1174821,A2HC5RRZ399BSD,B001C4QLBA,Tyler,"[2, 2]","As an American, and Stephen Fry fan, I was intrigued to find out what this series would be like. I was not disappointed. It is one of the most fascinating, beautiful, and heartwarming trips across America that I've ever seen. Fry travels to every state in the Union (some seem to get the shaft) from one adventure to the next. I enjoyed very much that for the most part, he avoids major cities. These places have been covered so many times. Instead, he seems to focus on whatever staple each state is known for. Most Americans wouldn't be surprised by his choices, but for others it may be a learning experience of America's various cultures. In a lot of ways, Each state really is like its own country. There is a Sense of unfairness with the time spent in each state. Some he merely drives through, which leaves you feeling underwhelmed. I suppose it wouldn't be a problem, but some of the states that receive the most attention, are rather unworthy of it. His visit to Las Vegas, for example, was strangely boring and much too long. I have to take a star off for that, because much of the series is so good, being thrown a dud episode is depressing. I've already viewed this series twice, and can't wait to jump in again. What a refreshing and fun vacation, with a wonderful host, that you can take right in your living room.
