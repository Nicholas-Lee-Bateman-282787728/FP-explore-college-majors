Hill ""CFH""","[5, 7]","Animals should have been a good ""Grade B"" horror flick, but it really never got interesting enough to make it worth seeing.The plot seemed interesting enough - No spoilers from me: The story revolves around a washed up football player who returns to his backwards hometown only to fall into a serious rut. Along comes a beautiful stranger who takes an interest in him, but she has a serious ulterior motive.What follows is a lot of sex, some fairly well done gore effects, a few weak fight scenes, and perhaps the cheesiest CGI special effects ever (seriously). The acting was on par with other low budget movies, but there were really no standouts to make this movie worth seeing again. This movie really moved slowly and the odd camera work and editing also made it difficult to watch.Not Recommended.CFH",2,Missed The Mark,1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,806,"['Animals', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'Grade', 'B', 'horror', 'flick', 'really', 'never', 'got', 'interesting', 'enough', 'make', 'seeing.The', 'plot', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'enough', 'No', 'spoilers', 'story', 'around', 'washed', 'up', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'backwards', 'hometown', 'only', 'fall', 'serious', 'rut', 'Along', 'beautiful', 'stranger', 'who', 'interest', 'serious', 'ulterior', 'motive.What', 'lot', 'sex', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'gore', 'effects', 'few', 'weak', 'fight', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'cheesiest', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'ever', 'seriously', 'acting', 'was', 'par', 'other', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'were', 'really', 'standouts', 'make', 'movie', 'seeing', 'again', 'movie', 'really', 'moved', 'slowly', 'odd', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'also', 'made', 'difficult', 'watch.Not', 'Recommended.CFH']",N/A

1336667,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B003CP1SW4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","I ended up watching ""Animals"" because it had Marc Blucas from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and Naveen Andrews from ""Lost,"" so I figured there had to be something here to attract both of them, besides a paycheck.  Blucas plays Jarrett, who is one of those nice guys who meets up with a bad girl, in this case Nora played byNicki Aycox.  What drives most of the plot in story, which was adapted by Craig Spector from thenovelby John Skipp, are the two big things that Jarrett does not know that the audience does.  The first is that Nicki's bite is turning him into an animal just like her, which would be a werewolf-like thing (the hyphen signifies that it is neither a wolfman like in ""The Wolfman"" or a big wolf like in ""New Moon"").  We are have an inner beast yadda-yadda-yadda, and now Jarrett's gets to come out and play.  The second is that our hero is involved in a love triangle, because Nicki has been taking a break from Andrews' Vic, and now Vic wants her back.  Actually, there is a third thing that Jarrett does not know, and that would be that he has the love of a good woman, namely Jane (Eva Amurri), back at the local watering hole.In the final analysis, ""Animals"" falls prey to the fate of many horror movies in that when you finally get to see the monsters in their full glory, you are more inclined to laugh than to shake with fear in your boots.  So the rule of thumb here is the less you see of the actors, the less you enjoy the film.  Of course, that means the reverse is true, and with regards to three of the four main characters you are going to get to see pretty much all of them.  One of the strengths of this horror film ends up being the sex scenes, which are pretty much on a par with late night cable soft core porn.  When it comes to gratuitous nudity and sex, it is hard to beat horror films and usually the sight of a woman's naked breasts are a clear indication that she is about to be dead and they are about to be covered in blood.  But these sex scenes were well integrated into the storyline.Speaking of blood, my favorite scene in this movie was when Vic encounters one of those convenience store clerks who would rather talk on a phone than wait on a customer and he unleashes his inner animal to teach her the error of her ways.  The payoff for this scene is a nice example of how you can be more effective suggesting what happens rather than showing everything.  So director Douglas Aarniokoski (credited as Arnold Cassius) gets credit for doing more with the material than you would expect.  The rating on this one ends up where it is because two stars means I wish I had not bother to watch the movie (one star means the people who made it should be hunted down and hurt badly), and three stars means I will probably never watch it again but it had its moments, which aptly describes ""Animals.""",3,It is an interesting horror movie where the sex is better than the violence,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,2838,"['ended', 'up', 'watching', 'Animals', 'had', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Lost', 'figured', 'there', 'had', 'be', 'something', 'here', 'attract', 'paycheck', 'Blucas', 'Jarrett', 'who', 'one', 'nice', 'guys', 'who', 'up', 'bad', 'girl', 'case', 'Nora', 'played', 'byNicki', 'Aycox', 'What', 'most', 'plot', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'Craig', 'Spector', 'thenovelby', 'John', 'Skipp', 'are', 'two', 'big', 'things', 'Jarrett', 'not', 'know', 'audience', 'first', 'Nicki', 'bite', 'turning', 'animal', 'just', 'would', 'be', 'werewolf-like', 'thing', 'hyphen', 'wolfman', 'Wolfman', 'big', 'wolf', 'New', 'Moon', 'are', 'have', 'inner', 'beast', 'yadda-yadda-yadda', 'now', 'Jarrett', 'come', 'out', 'play', 'second', 'hero', 'involved', 'love', 'triangle', 'Nicki', 'been', 'taking', 'break', 'Andrews', 'Vic', 'now', 'Vic', 'back', 'Actually', 'third', 'thing', 'Jarrett', 'not', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'love', 'good', 'woman', 'namely', 'Jane', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'back', 'local', 'watering', 'hole.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'Animals', 'prey', 'fate', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'monsters', 'full', 'glory', 'are', 'more', 'inclined', 'laugh', 'shake', 'fear', 'boots', 'rule', 'thumb', 'here', 'less', 'see', 'actors', 'less', 'enjoy', 'film', 'course', 'reverse', 'true', 'regards', 'three', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'see', 'pretty', 'much', 'One', 'strengths', 'horror', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'soft', 'core', 'porn', 'When', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'sex', 'hard', 'beat', 'horror', 'films', 'usually', 'sight', 'woman', 'naked', 'breasts', 'are', 'clear', 'indication', 'be', 'dead', 'are', 'be', 'covered', 'blood', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'integrated', 'storyline.Speaking', 'blood', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Vic', 'one', 'convenience', 'store', 'clerks', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'talk', 'phone', 'wait', 'customer', 'inner', 'animal', 'teach', 'error', 'ways', 'payoff', 'scene', 'nice', 'example', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'suggesting', 'what', 'rather', 'showing', 'everything', 'So', 'director', 'Douglas', 'Aarniokoski', 'credited', 'Arnold', 'Cassius', 'credit', 'doing', 'more', 'material', 'would', 'expect', 'rating', 'one', 'where', 'two', 'stars', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'bother', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'should', 'be', 'hunted', 'down', 'hurt', 'badly', 'three', 'stars', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'had', 'moments', 'aptly', 'Animals']",N/A

Spencer ""horror/fantasy author""","[1, 1]","(actually I'd give it two and a half stars, but the template won't let me go halfway on a star... but since I *really wanted to like* this movie more than the final verdict left me, figured I er on the side of nice.)So, the movie version of one of the best werewolf novels ever... wound up as a direct-to-redbox cheapy. Nowhere near as bad as feared; in fact, there's a lot going for this, particularly in atmosphere and inspired character-actor casting - I think I'm in love with Eva Amurri and Nickie Aycox [hot werewolf girls... literally at each other's throats... *growl*], Marc Blucas is perfectly cast and deserves to go far as an actor, and villain Naveen Andrews is a pure wicked treat. But I swear, someone in the freakin' editing room must have been on a Mission to make this movie suck! And the story/mythos-changes did nothing but clutter things worse. Also, they made that most frequent of gambles when adapting material like this from page to screen, namely taking story elements that were withheld 'til later in the book, creating tension and mystery that built to surprise twists, and presenting it in real-time from the git-go (as in pretty much every screen/stage version of DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE). Sometimes said switch-around works out well, in other cases not. Here... not so much :-/ And seriously, when adapting a 500-page novel with a rather packed plot, there's no excuse for so much filler in the first half of an 80-minute movie, then truncating the second half of the story within an inch of its life. All that internal POV/voice-over/werewolf-DNA-microscope-footage nonsense was a nightmare (and not in the good way you'd hope for from this sort of movie). Still, I confess, I actually like how they made use of low-rent CGI for their creature effects. If you can't make your otherworldly creature look convincingly physically *there*, why not go the other way and have it look intentionally *not* quite there, semi-spectral, suggesting your beastie's not fully of this dimension of existence. Makes perfect sense to me, to where it's a wonder someone didn't think of it sooner.

On the outside this movie is about blood, sex, sweat, and murder.  But in reality it is about the futility of unrequited love and what choosing the wrong partner who wants nothing to do with you may ultimately someday cost you.It is about Jared, a washed out former jock who has returned to his hometown, now works in construction.  Nora and Vic are 2 people that have the ability to turn at will into these huge dog-like animal creatures that have increased strength, eyesight, sense of smell, incredible speed, and some other abilities.  There are 2 types.  Nora and Vic are predators who hunt regular humans and live off of their flesh and blood, but Nora hates herself for doing it and Vic even more for making her that way.She comes to Jared's town and is immediately infatuated with him.  There are some good sex scenes.  Nora makes Jared like her.  Vic shows up before Jared's change is complete. Vic agrees not to harm Jared if Nora will return with him, but he goes back on his word and ends up killing Jules, Jared's best friend.  Vic throws Nora into a cage temporarily.Jared turns to his friend Jane, who now owns Jules' bar, for comfort and a job.  Jane and Jared fall in love.  Jared discovers that Jane is also an animal-like creature but she lives in harmony with people.  Jane lives in a slightly isolated location a small way away in the woods and lives off of deer, rabbits, and other wild animals.Nora escapes from Vic and returns to Jared and asks him to runaway with her.  Jared rejects Nora in favor of Jane, his mate.  Jane and Nora get into a fight.  Nora is killed.  Jane is mortally wounded.  Vic goes after Nora only to discover that she is dead.  Vic goes after Jared and Jane.  Jared confronts Vic at the site where Jared used to work.  Jared kills Vic and uses the blood from his heart to save Jane.

But now, thanks to the Twilight and Underworld franchises, the werewolf genre is both exploding and being whipped to the ground.  Soon it will go the way of the zombie by being so ubiquitous as to be positively loathsome, no matter how sexy the actor/actress playing the part.  On the writing end:  as a pair, John Skipp and Craig Spector wrote some of the most formidable horror of the 1980's and early 90s with such fare as Light at the End, The Cleanup, and the Scream.  By the time the Animals novel came out, their star had long faded as the quality of their earlier work seemed to be lacking.  How appropriate that their weakest work gets made into such a weak movie that tries to capitalize on the werewolf craze.  To harken again to the mainstream franchise movies, the werewolf film genre' wasn't just reignited with these movies, but positively exploded as werewolves were no longer solitary tragic figures, but were now dynamos of sexuality.  Animals is very upfront about getting its horndog on as the unsympathetic leads pretty much spend half of the movie doing it all over the place.  As many reviewers have remarked, there is not much of a plot.  Girl runs away from abusive controlling douche bag boyfriend (played with a sleazy relish by Naveen Andrews), girl meets guy and treats him like how she was treated and gives him something (wink-wink, nudge-nudge).  The special effects weren't cheap so much as they were insubstantial-I kept wondering what the hell it was I was seeing all the time.
