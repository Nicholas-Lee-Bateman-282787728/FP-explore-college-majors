1139644,AFJNWPKMIOYBP,B0012YB9HG,"A. Friedman ""life enthusiast""","[23, 24]","Quite depressing. Like going to a funeral, it is unpleasant, and yet deeply touching, moving, and worthwhile. Elicits introspection. Rather than preachy or energizing, the mood is profound grief over humanity's impact on ""our"" planet. The viewer is assumed to already be familiar with over-population, peak oil, global climate change, pollution, species extinction, and resource depletion. This movie sears the guilt and grief of that into one's soul.There is no happy chapter, no talk of solar energy and technological rescue, but instead just a call to be more awake, more questioning, and more active in cleaning up the debris, just in case there is any hope left for our survival. By de-emphasizing statistics and ratcheting up sorrowful emotions, this documentary stands apart in its genre. It's uniqueness thus warrants your effort to seek it out and view it.If I knew the world would end tomorrow, I would still plant a tree today.--Martin Luther [from a deleted scene in the movie]",5,"A brutally honest perspective, and therefore profoundly sad",1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,989,"['Quite', 'depressing', 'going', 'funeral', 'unpleasant', 'yet', 'deeply', 'touching', 'moving', 'worthwhile', 'Elicits', 'introspection', 'Rather', 'preachy', 'energizing', 'mood', 'profound', 'grief', 'humanity', 'impact', 'planet', 'viewer', 'assumed', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'over-population', 'peak', 'oil', 'global', 'climate', 'change', 'pollution', 'species', 'extinction', 'resource', 'depletion', 'movie', 'guilt', 'grief', 'one', 'soul.There', 'happy', 'chapter', 'talk', 'solar', 'energy', 'technological', 'rescue', 'instead', 'just', 'call', 'be', 'more', 'awake', 'more', 'questioning', 'more', 'active', 'cleaning', 'up', 'debris', 'just', 'case', 'hope', 'left', 'survival', 'de-emphasizing', 'statistics', 'ratcheting', 'up', 'sorrowful', 'emotions', 'documentary', 'apart', 'genre', 'uniqueness', 'thus', 'warrants', 'effort', 'seek', 'out', 'view', 'it.If', 'knew', 'world', 'would', 'end', 'tomorrow', 'would', 'still', 'plant', 'tree', 'today.', 'Martin', 'Luther', '[', 'deleted', 'scene', 'movie', ']']",What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire (Licensed for Individual Use Only)
1139645,AEGLLY9CXWXX3,B0012YB9HG,"Halifax Student Account ""a-beautiful-idea""","[3, 17]","The script is poetic, editing superb and the mood is tranquil in immense forbidding doom. This documentary is definitely aimed at the Oscar award crowd. Whereas Al Gore thinks we can save our world by buying energy saving light bulbs, the narrator of What a Way to Go relishes the coming apocalypse.The narrator's message is made crystal clear. We technology users are living in a pre-apocalyptic bubble ready to pop (the rest are already there)! According to the experts on here, humanity is rationally walking into a very large gas oven, with eyes wide open. We all know this, that the temperature is rising but we can't be bothered to get off our bottoms to walk across the room to check the thermostat.This herald of doom is what we are flayed with, for a painful two hours. Painstaking because there is little humor in this message and the talking heads are undeniably very clever talking heads, with structured arguments that are logical but extreme in a end-times kind of way. They all have books to promote and they are well published; it's like they really want it to happen. But hey, it may be my bubble existence that makes me blinkered. Now it's time for the bad part of my review.Although the documentary is stamped with quality and blows away all the rubbish on the Discovery channel, I was distracted by the puny voice over. The guy talking the main narration bit sounds just like Brian from Family Guy (apologies to Family Guy fans). A nasal little boy voice emanating from a middle aged man; crying about his childhood, this voice ruined my enjoyment of an otherwise well produced film. Trying to watch this film with that horrid voice is analogous to viewing a renaissance masterpiece whilst being trapped for two hellish hours with a shy stuttering dribbling Claudius with a fetish for necrosis. This is a shame because what Brian says Brian says with a beautifully written script in front of him. Most documentaries are voiced in an Al Gore dead-pan drone. This writer attempts to write his voice script in beautiful poetry, however, no matter how well written the script may be, this doesn't make the writer a good orator.It's funny the way a man's ego works. You would think that a guy who worries about the coming apocalypse, and makes a film about it; well you would expect him to be fairly selfless and empathic wouldn't you? He would want to produce his well packaged film to get his message out. The message would be the reward itself but the man has an ego to feed, so he sits in his basement and insists that he will do the voice over himself! It would be like Steven Spielberg elbowing Harrison Ford aside because he's the director and he's going to be Indiana Jones! God, the guy must be a walking beacon of insecurity, demanding to be heard on his masterpiece of a film! (I'm assuming that he wrote it because there is allot of ""I"", this and, ""I"" that, ""when I was a child"", ""I worry"" blah blah). We instinctively adopt a veneer of sneering defensive superiority; especially if we know Family Guy, I mean, its Brian's voice, but only depressed and sad and more nasal than Brian (I'm not knocking the voice acting on Family Guy; it's obviously superb. The actor who plays Brian talks fast and articulate and very comic; this guy's voice has none of these good points).The guy should have hired a voice actor. You cannot be too proud when you're trying to save the planet. A woman's voice is handy in these suicide situations. Psychologists argue we can more easily identify with with a female voice. Well I can anyway.",3,Apocalyptic Porn with Brian from Family Guy!,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,3549,"['script', 'poetic', 'editing', 'superb', 'mood', 'tranquil', 'immense', 'forbidding', 'doom', 'documentary', 'definitely', 'aimed', 'Oscar', 'award', 'crowd', 'Whereas', 'Al', 'Gore', 'can', 'save', 'world', 'buying', 'energy', 'saving', 'light', 'bulbs', 'narrator', 'What', 'Way', 'Go', 'relishes', 'coming', 'apocalypse.The', 'narrator', 'message', 'made', 'crystal', 'clear', 'technology', 'users', 'are', 'living', 'pre-apocalyptic', 'bubble', 'ready', 'pop', 'rest', 'are', 'already', 'there', 'According', 'experts', 'here', 'humanity', 'rationally', 'walking', 'very', 'large', 'gas', 'oven', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'know', 'temperature', 'rising', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'get', 'off', 'bottoms', 'walk', 'room', 'check', 'thermostat.This', 'herald', 'doom', 'what', 'are', 'flayed', 'painful', 'two', 'hours', 'Painstaking', 'little', 'humor', 'message', 'talking', 'heads', 'are', 'undeniably', 'very', 'clever', 'talking', 'heads', 'structured', 'arguments', 'are', 'logical', 'extreme', 'end-times', 'kind', 'way', 'have', 'books', 'promote', 'are', 'well', 'published', 'really', 'want', 'happen', 'may', 'be', 'bubble', 'existence', 'blinkered', 'Now', 'time', 'bad', 'part', 'documentary', 'stamped', 'quality', 'away', 'rubbish', 'Discovery', 'channel', 'was', 'distracted', 'puny', 'voice', 'guy', 'talking', 'main', 'narration', 'bit', 'just', 'like', 'Brian', 'Family', 'Guy', 'apologies', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fans', 'nasal', 'little', 'boy', 'voice', 'emanating', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'crying', 'childhood', 'voice', 'ruined', 'enjoyment', 'otherwise', 'well', 'produced', 'film', 'Trying', 'watch', 'film', 'horrid', 'voice', 'analogous', 'viewing', 'renaissance', 'masterpiece', 'whilst', 'being', 'trapped', 'two', 'hellish', 'hours', 'shy', 'stuttering', 'dribbling', 'Claudius', 'fetish', 'necrosis', 'shame', 'what', 'Brian', 'Brian', 'beautifully', 'written', 'script', 'front', 'Most', 'documentaries', 'are', 'voiced', 'Al', 'Gore', 'dead-pan', 'drone', 'writer', 'write', 'voice', 'script', 'beautiful', 'poetry', 'however', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'may', 'be', ""n't"", 'make', 'writer', 'good', 'orator.It', 'funny', 'way', 'man', 'ego', 'would', 'think', 'guy', 'who', 'coming', 'apocalypse', 'film', 'well', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'fairly', 'selfless', 'empathic', 'would', ""n't"", 'would', 'want', 'produce', 'well', 'packaged', 'film', 'get', 'message', 'out', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'reward', 'man', 'ego', 'feed', 'basement', 'will', 'do', 'voice', 'would', 'be', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'elbowing', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'aside', 'director', 'going', 'be', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'God', 'guy', 'must', 'be', 'walking', 'beacon', 'insecurity', 'demanding', 'be', 'heard', 'masterpiece', 'film', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'wrote', 'allot', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'worry', 'blah', 'instinctively', 'adopt', 'veneer', 'sneering', 'defensive', 'superiority', 'especially', 'know', 'Family', 'Guy', 'mean', 'Brian', 'voice', 'only', 'depressed', 'sad', 'more', 'nasal', 'Brian', ""'m"", 'not', 'knocking', 'voice', 'acting', 'Family', 'Guy', 'obviously', 'superb', 'actor', 'who', 'Brian', 'talks', 'fast', 'articulate', 'very', 'comic', 'guy', 'voice', 'none', 'good', 'points', '.The', 'guy', 'should', 'have', 'hired', 'voice', 'actor', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'proud', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'save', 'planet', 'woman', 'voice', 'handy', 'suicide', 'situations', 'Psychologists', 'can', 'more', 'easily', 'identify', 'female', 'voice', 'Well', 'can', 'anyway']",What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire (Licensed for Individual Use Only)
