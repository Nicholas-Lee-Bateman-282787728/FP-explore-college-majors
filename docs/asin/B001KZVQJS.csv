I find her character inspirational and soothing.With that being said, I must urge people to watch seasons 1-7 before season 9, as the writing is MUCH better, as are the guest stars and plots. Season 8 was bad, and really had a different feel that 1-7.This season ( 9) returns to the traditional MSW writing, but Angela's character still doesn't have the same feel to her, and seems much more metropolitan than 1-7.

In particular, A Christmas Secret which actually someone is almost murdered in Cabot Cove. I also enjoyed The Dead File in which Jessica is used as a characteur of herself in a comic strip. BUT my favorite would have to me The Wind in the Tower. It takes place in Ireland. A man dies but is it natural or murder?  If your reading this then you are a fan. Season 9 is much more fun than season 8 (in fact the beginning has JB's typewriter instead of the word processor used in S8). I wish that Universal would release the seasons more quickly.

1212624,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001KZVQJS,Z Hayes,"[5, 5]","I have loved Murder She Wrote since watching the first season as a thirteen year-old back in 1984. Though I love all the seasons, I am particularly fond of the earlier seasons, and was not really happy when Jessica made brief appearances in one of the later seasons [with other characters standing in and solving cases]. Season 9 however turned out to be a winning season putting the show back on top with compelling plots and excellent acting all around.The episodes in Season 9 have interesting plots:""Murder in Milan"" - Jessica investigates the murder of film producer Catherine Wayne during the Milan Film Festival.""Family Secrets"" - I love it when the stories are set in Cabot Cove, Maine. Here Jessica helps uncover a 30-year-old scandal in Cabot Cove when her ex-student is murdered in the course of writing a book about it.""The Mole"" - A case of mistaken identity has Jessica kidnapped and when the woman she is mistaken for is killed, Jessica investigates.""The Wind Around the Tower"" - I loved this episode. Jessica teams up with old friend, Sean Culhane [George Hearn] to solve the murder of their host at a country estate in Ireland.""The Dead File"" - Jessica finds herself at the receiving end of a satirical comic strip in NY.""Night of the Coyote"" - Jessica investigates the murder of an old mining town entrepreneur.""Sugar and Spice, Malice and Vice"" - Agent Michael Hagarty [Len Cariou] finds himself in a spot after he becomes the prime suspect in the murder of his daughter's fiancee.""The Classic Murder"" - A psychic is found murdered after foretelling the murder of a missing tycoon.""A Christmas Secret"" - one of my favorite episodes of this season. It has to do with secrets and is set in Cabot Cove.""The Sound of Murder"" - Jessica investigates a murder that happens during a taping of a rock video.""Final Curtain"" - An actor's personal manager is murdered.Set in Cabot Cove.""Double Jeopardy"" - Jessica investigates the murder of a slumlord in NY.""Dead Eye"" - Introduces recurring character Charlie Garrett [Wayne Rogers]. Jessica attends a writer's convention in Miami and investigates a murder.""Killer Radio""  - A potential buyer of a radio station is murdered. Set in the Midwest.""The Petrified Florist"" - A Beverly Hills florist supplying fodder to tabloid mags is murdered.""Threshold of Fear"" - A woman who lives in isolation fears for her life when the killer she envisions in her dreams attempts to see her in real life, but then turns up dead.""The Big Kill"" - Jessica investigates two murders in Cabot Cove that have to do with industrial espionage.""Dead to Rights"" - Jessica questions the veracity of her ex-researcher Dana Ballard [Molly Hagan], who was a compulsive liar.""Lone Witness"" - A delivery boy swears his innocence when he is suspected of murder. It is left to Jessica to prove his innocence.""Ship of Thieves"" - Jessica and Dennis Stanton investigate murder on the high seas aboard a cruise ship.""The Survivor"" - Jessica's computer tech finds her life in peril.""Love's Deadly Desire"" - Set in Cabot Cove, novelist Sybilla Stone's sister is found murdered wearing Sybilla's cloak, but was it a case of mistaken identity instead?Apart from the intriguing plots, I also enjoyed identifying many familiar names who made regular appearances in various TV shows throughout the 80s and 90s, and even earlier.
