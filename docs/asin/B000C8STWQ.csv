Can you really ignore the calling blaming it all on fear of failure or other sircumstances in life? The story in this film touches on many simmular subjects and gets it done very well! I was amazed for a movie to cover so much in such an interesting, but healthy and useful way. Even though it starts out a bit slowly, but the scenes get better and better as we familiarize ourselves with the people of Tuscany more. With loads of easy going but great lessons and some tear jerking scenes, the movie provides amazingly beautiful and heart warming shots of Tuscany. You'll want to go to Italy, but best of all, you'll want to go to that place in your own heart that makes sense to you. This movie pushes on the hardship of discovering a way out in life for creative people. For many folks their dreams never come true, they're like little birds that cannot fly out of a cage, so in this story, what's amazing is that all the characters found their way out. Everyone had a happy ending only because they listened and they learned. I also enjoyed the story line between the young editer and the older writer. Heartbreaking and very thaughtprovoking. I thought this movie was amazing, in fact it is now one of my favorites. If you also think that it is indeed very hard to find movies that are fun, interesting and have some sort of lessons, like a good book, this movie is right for you.

955745,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000C8STWQ,David Bower,"[1, 1]","We watched this film last night and did enjoy it but we will not, however, want to watch it again anytime soon; it's not a bad film but just a little too predictable. It does have some beautiful scenery and some interesting characters but too often they're engaged in slightly over-the-top situations which compromise the films originality.The sudden breaks are rather strange as one reviewer pointed out; it really does appear they were intended for the insertion of commercials; I've seen this effect on older TV shows but their reason was clear there.The three main characters played by Harvey Keitel, Joshua Jackson, and Claire Forlani did good jobs with the roles they played. Brad Mirman, the writer, brought together a collection of situations which we have seen many times before and was pretty sure to attract an audience.By way of summation, this is an entertaining film that uses predictably pleasant ingredients resulting in an evening of very familiar enjoyment.

955749,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000C8STWQ,Grady Harp,"[14, 14]","Tuscany is like a magnet for sentimental Americans: the landscape, the people, the appreciation of life emanates from the sunscapes and offers a paradise to world-weary viewers.  And so it is that Tuscany is the true star of this little romantic film.  Yet writer/director Brad Mirman clearly knows how to script and move a story that, while predictable, still carries us along with wonderful characters from a fine cast.Jeremy (Joshua Jackson) works for a publishing house in New York and is sent to Tuscany to coerce famous novelist Weldon Parish (Harvey Keitel) into ending his 20-year moratorium and write a new, 'bound to be best seller' novel.  Parish has not written since he lost his beloved wife, becoming instead a rascal who spends his days basking in the lazy sun with his best friends the priest Father Moretti (Giancarlo Giannini), hotelier Gustavo (Armando Pucci) and his squeeze Amalia (Valeria Cavalli).  He lives with his daughter Isabella (Claire Forlani) and is visited often by his other daughters Dinnie (Silvia De Santis) and  Maura (Bianca Guaccero), each of whom hopes that their father will return to writing. Upon Jeremy's arrival he finds that everyone in the village is protective of Parish and when he finally meets the silent author, he discovers a man who loathes editors, publishers, press, and anyone else who wants him to start writing again.  Gradually Jeremy and Parish begin to break down barriers: Jeremy admits that he longs to be a writer but fears failure and Parish admits that his silence at the typewriter is due to a similar fear.  Jeremy falls in love with Isabella, becomes a part of Parish's drinking trio, undergoes some lessons in life .... and the ending is obvious from the start!Harvey Keitel gives a moving performance as the gritty but passionate writer, Joshua Jackson makes Jeremy a believably transitioned man, and the supporting cast is consistently excellent. It really doesn't matter that we know from the beginning just how things will turn out: it is the getting there that is the pleasure of this light but touching film. The only significant problems are in the editing: there appear to be stops and starts as though this were made for television with places for commercials.  But other than that this is a film that only asks that we relax, nod recognition, and enjoy the theme of the importance of honesty and the quality of life available if we follow our dreams.

Buena Vista Distributors should be hung, strung and quartered for releasing such a dreadful presentation on the US market and at a price of $29+ it proves that some studios are just plain greedy and hold their customers in contempt.  Surely they could have obtained the original anamorphic master digi-tape of the movie for US release.The  good news is that the film was shot in anamorphic widescreen, (1.78:1 - enhanced to 16x9).  The bad news is that the NTSC version is pan-and-scan, presumably re-edited for TV.  They have 'forced commercial breaks' into the film, that's why there are so many 'fades to black' where the storyline does not justify them.  Before the end titles scroll up, the picture and vocal song fades to black, and a pan up to the sky and part of the vocal are lost.Well, if you want to see the film in all its glorious anamorphic (16x9) widescreen presentation, with exceptional picture quality and color saturation, buy the Region 2 PAL version from amazon.co.uk.  The picture is so sharp you would think HD couldn't look any better!  The audio is somewhat superior too!  The disc also contains the same extras as the US version.  What a difference the correct screen ratio transfer can make to the complete enjoyment of a movie, in the way it was originally intended to be seen!  5 Stars for the movie - 1 star for the terrible NTSC Region 1 version!",1,Region 1 DVD Viewers Have Been Hoodwinked,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,1644,"['would', 'normally', 'give', ""'Shadows"", 'Sun', '5', 'stars', 'wonderful', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'stunning', 'landscapes', 'Tuscany', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'give', '1', 'star', 'dreadful', 'pan-and-scan', '4x3', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'forced', 'Region', '1', 'viewers', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Distributors', 'should', 'be', 'hung', 'strung', 'quartered', 'releasing', 'dreadful', 'presentation', 'US', 'market', 'price', '29+', 'studios', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'greedy', 'hold', 'customers', 'contempt', 'Surely', 'could', 'have', 'obtained', 'original', 'anamorphic', 'master', 'digi-tape', 'movie', 'US', 'release.The', 'good', 'news', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '1.78:1', 'enhanced', '16x9', 'bad', 'news', 'NTSC', 'version', 'pan-and-scan', 'presumably', 're-edited', 'TV', 'have', ""'forced"", 'commercial', 'breaks', 'film', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'many', ""'fades"", 'black', 'where', 'storyline', 'not', 'justify', 'end', 'titles', 'scroll', 'up', 'picture', 'vocal', 'song', 'fades', 'black', 'pan', 'up', 'sky', 'part', 'vocal', 'are', 'lost.Well', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'glorious', 'anamorphic', '16x9', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'exceptional', 'picture', 'quality', 'color', 'saturation', 'buy', 'Region', '2', 'PAL', 'version', 'amazon.co.uk', 'picture', 'so', 'sharp', 'would', 'think', 'HD', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'better', 'audio', 'somewhat', 'superior', 'too', 'disc', 'also', 'same', 'extras', 'US', 'version', 'What', 'difference', 'correct', 'screen', 'ratio', 'transfer', 'can', 'make', 'complete', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'way', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'seen', '5', 'Stars', 'movie', '1', 'star', 'terrible', 'NTSC', 'Region', '1', 'version']",Shadows In The Sun

955761,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B000C8STWQ,Pork Chop,"[0, 0]","Shadows in the Sun (2005) - is a quality, entertaining andrelaxing movie, that meets and exceeds the standard set byHarvey Keitel over his career.Of course, Keitel has made a number of hard-edge, toughunderworld movies, but in many of those in the mid-90's has mellowedout, and took on less of the earlier lone-wolf, tormented andcontroversial roles and more melodramatic, balanced, grown-manroles, many of which having a European sensibility.This is a great movie for HK, in the same manner of many of hismovies from the 90's that were also excellent. Of course, it isnot for everyone, considering the fragmented, completely scatteredtastes, opinions and inclinations of over 80% of the viewingpublic, who too often, just gobble up whatever is on the frontpage of a newspaper, magazine or website these days, 9 times outof 10.So,  I am glad to support and collect this legend's works in the business.In this movie, the viewer has the opportunity to see a contrastbetween HK, in the role of a retired writer with that of anup-and-coming and aspiring writer; of one who has been there and donethat as a youth, and over his life. The publisher's road rep ispresneted as a teetotaler, roboticized, plasticized from theenvironmental limitations and economical conditions in which he wasbrought up as and his character formed with the usual outside, socialpressures.Once in Italy, HK, reponding to a request for coaching thataspiring professional, advises the latter to discover the ""Wild Man""that is struggling to jump out of him, to grab onto something morestimulating that an ordinary routine, repeated day after day, time aftertime, to instead make every living moment meaningful, allowing thoseexperiences to later be put to paper, in a book.The supporting actor, playing the young writer, is JoshuaJackson, who many may jump too soon in underestimating, butactually, is able to balance both aspects of staying true to hisown British role upbringing, and culture while at the same time, changing,as a chameleon,  not staying impervious to the beauty of this(fictional) Italian small town (less than 500 people) whereresidents still have not only knowledge of their traditions handeddown in the past 500 to 2,000 years, but still live many of  them on adaily basis. The church, the priest, the town folk, festivities, combined withHK's young, charismatic woman (played by Claire Forlani), coupled withwine and song from time to time, in a rural setting. brings a charm to the screen.Granted, this small world is fictional, idyllic, and utopic.. but sometimes, to change into a dream-world state, this iswhat some viewers may enjoy to turn off from a hyper-technological,hyper-accelerated pace of life.Congratulations to Harvey Keitel in selecting a role in anothergreat script, and demonstrating depth time after time, invarious roles, and bringing together all  actors and cinematic professionalsto release this great movie and others.",4,"A quality, entertaining and relaxing movie",1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,2935,"['Shadows', 'Sun', '2005', 'quality', 'entertaining', 'andrelaxing', 'movie', 'standard', 'set', 'byHarvey', 'Keitel', 'career.Of', 'course', 'Keitel', 'made', 'number', 'hard-edge', 'toughunderworld', 'movies', 'many', 'mid-90', 'mellowedout', 'took', 'less', 'earlier', 'lone-wolf', 'tormented', 'andcontroversial', 'roles', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'balanced', 'grown-manroles', 'many', 'having', 'European', 'sensibility.This', 'great', 'movie', 'HK', 'same', 'manner', 'many', 'hismovies', '90', 'were', 'also', 'excellent', 'course', 'everyone', 'considering', 'fragmented', 'completely', 'opinions', 'inclinations', '80', '%', 'viewingpublic', 'who', 'too', 'often', 'just', 'gobble', 'up', 'frontpage', 'newspaper', 'magazine', 'website', 'days', '9', 'times', 'outof', '10.So', 'am', 'glad', 'support', 'collect', 'legend', 'works', 'business.In', 'movie', 'viewer', 'opportunity', 'see', 'contrastbetween', 'HK', 'role', 'retired', 'writer', 'anup-and-coming', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'one', 'who', 'been', 'there', 'donethat', 'youth', 'life', 'publisher', 'road', 'rep', 'ispresneted', 'teetotaler', 'roboticized', 'plasticized', 'theenvironmental', 'limitations', 'economical', 'conditions', 'wasbrought', 'up', 'character', 'formed', 'usual', 'outside', 'socialpressures.Once', 'Italy', 'HK', 'reponding', 'request', 'coaching', 'thataspiring', 'professional', 'latter', 'discover', 'Wild', 'Man', 'struggling', 'jump', 'grab', 'something', 'morestimulating', 'ordinary', 'routine', 'repeated', 'day', 'day', 'time', 'aftertime', 'instead', 'make', 'living', 'moment', 'meaningful', 'allowing', 'thoseexperiences', 'later', 'be', 'put', 'paper', 'book.The', 'supporting', 'actor', 'playing', 'young', 'writer', 'JoshuaJackson', 'who', 'many', 'may', 'jump', 'too', 'soon', 'underestimating', 'butactually', 'able', 'balance', 'aspects', 'staying', 'true', 'hisown', 'British', 'role', 'upbringing', 'culture', 'same', 'time', 'changing', 'chameleon', 'not', 'staying', 'impervious', 'beauty', 'fictional', 'Italian', 'small', 'town', 'less', '500', 'people', 'whereresidents', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'knowledge', 'traditions', 'handeddown', 'past', '500', '2,000', 'years', 'still', 'live', 'many', 'adaily', 'basis', 'church', 'priest', 'town', 'folk', 'festivities', 'combined', 'withHK', 'young', 'charismatic', 'woman', 'played', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'coupled', 'withwine', 'song', 'time', 'time', 'rural', 'setting', 'charm', 'screen.Granted', 'small', 'world', 'fictional', 'idyllic', 'utopic..', 'sometimes', 'change', 'dream-world', 'state', 'viewers', 'may', 'enjoy', 'turn', 'off', 'hyper-technological', 'hyper-accelerated', 'pace', 'life.Congratulations', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'selecting', 'role', 'anothergreat', 'script', 'demonstrating', 'depth', 'time', 'time', 'invarious', 'roles', 'bringing', 'together', 'actors', 'cinematic', 'professionalsto', 'release', 'great', 'movie', 'others']",Shadows In The Sun
