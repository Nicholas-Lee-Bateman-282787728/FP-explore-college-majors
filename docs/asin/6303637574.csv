It works because of a wonderful combination of romance and comedy, neither taking itself too seriously.Sandra Bullock plays Lucy with that trademark combination of sass and sweet. She's got something all of us can relate to at one point - she's a little klutzy, a little tired, a little dreamy, and a little sad. Still, it's far from bleak - she's got her kitty, a home and a job, not to mention a healthy sense of humor. She even has a semi-real Mr. Right.Then Mr. Right falls off a subway platform. Oops. It's Lucy to the rescue! At the hospital she meets his eccentric family, the Callaghans, and then it gets complicated when they mistake her for his fiance.  Taken to their hearts from Grandma Elsie to brother Jack, Lucy finally has the family she's always craved and she can't disillusion them with the truth as long as their son is in his coma. For the solitary Lucy, life gets very, very full.It's a little predictable, but the end is a bit of a surprise. For a fluffy movie, it handles things with a dash of wry maturity. The setting is Chicago and winter, so it's a perfect holiday season movie that will get you in the mood for winter cheer. This is a comedy that doesn't go for laughs, but simply shows us the way life is often funny and sweet.  Perhaps it doesn't quite make the most of the actors or plot, but those are easily overlooked.  It's one of those movies you watch again and again to recapture the feelings of warmth and optimism that it inspires.

383026,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303637574,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 7]","`While You Were Sleeping' is one of those movies that reminds me how much I love movies.  No matter how sappy, how improbable and how sentimental this film really is it works so well because it tries hard enough.  It really excels in yanking those heart strings and endearing the audience to the characters involved.  `While You Were Sleeping' is the film that just about every romantic comedy dreams of becoming.  In fact Sandra Bullock is officially the queen of the romantic comedy (sure Meg Ryan is great, and I love her, but Bullock has this locked up) for when you tag this with her brilliant comedic work in `Two Weeks Notice' and you have two of the best romantic comedies ever filmed.Sandra plays Lucy Eleanor Moderatz, a young toll booth clerk who has fallen madly in love with a business man who takes the train everyday.  Like most of the memorable characters played by Bullock, Lucy is out of luck when it comes to love and really life in general.  She wants to fall in love and travel the world but has never come close.  Then one day her luck changes in a very strange and unexpected way.  When this man, Peter, gets mugged right in front of her and pushed onto the train tracks Lucy ends up saving his life, and in a hospital mix-up she ends up being perceived as Peter's fianc&eacute;.  Peter is in a coma and unable to correct the misunderstanding and so immediately Lucy is welcomed into the Callaghan home with open arms as they await Peter's awakening.There's just one problem, and that problem comes in the form of Peter's brother Jack who doesn't believe for one minute that Lucy is his brother's fianc&eacute;.  In fact he tries everything in his power to prove her wrong.  Lucy on the other hand, while hating the fact that she's lying to this wonderful family, can't help but enjoy the feeling she has now being part of a family.  She finally feels whole.  She has people to spend her holidays with, people who love her and care about her and she just can't get up the strength to give that up.  Jack poses another problem though as time progresses.  As Lucy and Jack continue to spend time together they begin to feel a little more strongly for each other then they would have expected and this poses problems all their own.`While You Were Sleeping' sports an Oscar worthy performance by Bullock in my humble opinion (my personal Best Actress winner of the given year) as well as some impressive supporting performances as well.  Bill Pullman is usually `leave him or take him' in my book but here he actually does a great job, as does Peter Gallagher who is never really a highlight for me.  The true shining star comes in the form of Jack Warden though as Saul, the loving Grandfather who takes Lucy under his wing.  His performance is endearing and touching.  The late Peter Boyle is also great here.So, while `While You Were Sleeping' may be a somewhat predictable comedy oozing forth with heaping globs of sentiment it hits its mark one-hundred percent and rises above it's competitors as the superior romantic comedy, the film they can all aspire to become, the film they all should look up to and the film that will make you love movies once again.",5,Utterly perfect romantic comedy...,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,3182,"['Were', 'Sleeping', 'one', 'movies', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'movies', 'matter', 'how', 'sappy', 'how', 'improbable', 'how', 'sentimental', 'film', 'really', 'so', 'well', 'hard', 'enough', 'really', 'yanking', 'heart', 'strings', 'endearing', 'audience', 'characters', 'involved', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'film', 'just', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'fact', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'officially', 'queen', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sure', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'great', 'love', 'Bullock', 'locked', 'up', 'when', 'tag', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'work', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'have', 'two', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'ever', 'filmed.Sandra', 'plays', 'Lucy', 'Eleanor', 'Moderatz', 'young', 'toll', 'booth', 'clerk', 'who', 'fallen', 'madly', 'love', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'train', 'everyday', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'played', 'Bullock', 'Lucy', 'luck', 'when', 'love', 'really', 'life', 'general', 'fall', 'love', 'travel', 'world', 'never', 'come', 'close', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'luck', 'changes', 'very', 'strange', 'unexpected', 'way', 'When', 'man', 'Peter', 'mugged', 'right', 'front', 'pushed', 'train', 'tracks', 'Lucy', 'up', 'saving', 'life', 'hospital', 'mix-up', 'up', 'being', 'perceived', 'Peter', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Peter', 'coma', 'unable', 'correct', 'misunderstanding', 'so', 'immediately', 'Lucy', 'welcomed', 'Callaghan', 'home', 'open', 'arms', 'await', 'Peter', 'awakening.There', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'problem', 'form', 'Peter', 'brother', 'Jack', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'one', 'minute', 'Lucy', 'brother', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'fact', 'everything', 'power', 'prove', 'wrong', 'Lucy', 'other', 'hand', 'hating', 'fact', 'lying', 'wonderful', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'feeling', 'now', 'being', 'part', 'family', 'finally', 'feels', 'whole', 'people', 'spend', 'holidays', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'care', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'strength', 'give', 'up', 'Jack', 'problem', 'time', 'Lucy', 'Jack', 'continue', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'begin', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'strongly', 'other', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'problems', 'own.', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'sports', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Bullock', 'humble', 'opinion', 'personal', 'Best', 'Actress', 'winner', 'given', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'impressive', 'supporting', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'usually', 'leave', 'take', 'book', 'here', 'actually', 'great', 'job', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'highlight', 'true', 'shining', 'star', 'form', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'as', 'Saul', 'loving', 'Grandfather', 'who', 'Lucy', 'wing', 'performance', 'endearing', 'touching', 'late', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'also', 'great', 'here.So', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'comedy', 'oozing', 'forth', 'heaping', 'globs', 'sentiment', 'mark', 'one-hundred', 'percent', 'rises', 'competitors', 'superior', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'film', 'can', 'aspire', 'become', 'film', 'should', 'look', 'up', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'love', 'movies', 'once', 'again']",While You Were Sleeping VHS

For a living, she sits in a booth day after day and collects tolls.  One day, she sees a tall, dark handsome man (Peter) who seems to resemble her now dead father.  She falls in love with him but he's oblivious to her.Because Lucy lives alone, her boss gets her to work Christmas Day.  Amazingly, the man of her dreams rushes by on the Holiday, drops some coins in her booth, and wishes her a merry Christmas.  It happened so fast that poor Lucy never even got the chance to speak to her would-be lover.  As fate would have it, though, he ends up getting mugged and is pushed onto the tracks in front of an oncoming train.  Lucy bolts from her booth and jumps onto the tracks.  As she lies on top of him, she rolls him and herself out of the path of the oncoming train, thus saving his life.At the hospital, the personnel block her from going to him.  As they do, she stares through the glass doors at his prone form lying on a gurney and says, ""I'm going to marry him.""  A nearby nurse oversees what happens and hears what Lucy says.When the family arrives, they rush into Peter's room anxious to see how he is doing.  Lucy is pointed out to them and they are told that she saved Peter's life.  And that's when the nurse tells everyone that Lucy is his fiance - and the fun begins.There's much said about the predictability of this film.  Whether you feel it is predictable or not, it's handled in such a way that you're anxious to see the story unfold and to watch how everything turns out.  Sandra Bullock gives a terrific performance as the sweet, lonely, and lovable Lucy; Bill Pullman plays, Jack, Peter's brother.  A cast of great character actors make up Peter's family.  I honestly believe it's the combined performance of the stellar cast that make this film so memorable.If you're thirsting for something wholesome, funny, and that doesn't get old with repeated viewings, then this is the movie for you!

Granted, in real life that's so unlikely as to be effectively impossible, but I still dare them to imagine they wouldn't get mentally and emotionally knocked for a loop when events rush up and overwhelm the parameters of their lives like this.At any rate, the fun is in how Lucy and the Callaghan's - who owe Lucy BIG TIME, never mind the misunderstandings - become family. That's not to say the the romance isn't an enjoyable one - Bullock and Pullman are a very winning couple - with a nice payoff that ties several motifs neatly together.

Every moment of this sweetly endearing story will leave you with a warm and tingly  feeling all over that won't wear off until long after the movie ends. In  her first starring vehicle, an extremely appealing Sandra Bullock plays  lonely subway worker Lucy and brings a warmth, freshness, and vulnerability  to this character that everyone can identify with.  After all, we've all  had unrequited crushes on someone else at one point in our lives, but when  Lucy saves the life of her &quot;dream man&quot; Peter, a hilarious comedy  of errors ensues at the hospital when she is mistaken for his fiancee and  passed off to his family as such. In the beginning, Lucy reluctantly plays  along with the ruse, but as she falls in love with Peter's family and  especially his brother Jack, she finds it very difficult to tell them the  truth - that she is not engaged to Peter, indeed she has never even spoken  to him!  Bullock and Pullman shine as the two romantic leads who are loath  to admit how attracted they are to each other, and the marvellous  supporting cast add many laughs to this gem of a movie.  This is a very  entertaining way to spend over ninety minutes.  You would have to be very  hard to please if you didn't enjoy this movie about love at second sight.

383039,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,6303637574,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 7]","One of the surprise films of 1995, While You Were Sleeping is one of the top romantic comedies of the decade. Sandra Bullock experiences her breakout role as the loveable lead character, and Bill Pullman makes a name for himself a year before the release of Independence Day (where he performed masterfully as the president). Overall, While You Were Sleeping is a classic feel-good love story with enough comedy and laughs to avoid earning the designation of a soppy chick flick.Sandra Bullock plays the role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz, a Chicago subway ticket-taker who whittles away the hours of her life trapped inside a ticket booth along the tracks. Each day, Peter Callaghan (Peter Gallagher) passes by in his daily commute to work. Lucy has managed to develop a crush on the man (whose name she doesn't even know), fantasizing about their life together, but she never says a word about it. When Christmas Eve arrives, she witnesses a gang of thugs beat up Peter and leave him on the tracks. Risking her own life, Lucy saves Peter from an oncoming train and summons medical help.While in the hospital, she tells the nurse she's the man's fianc&eacute;e, and when Peter's family shows up at the hospital, the nurse relays the same information to them. Shocked that Peter had a fianc&eacute;e they knew nothing about, they nonetheless take Lucy under their wing. Afraid to reveal the truth, Lucy goes along with the lie while Peter remains in a coma. When Peter wakes up, he doesn't remember Lucy, and she continues the lie - telling him he suffers from amnesia. Meanwhile, Peter's brother Jack (Bill Pullman) comes to know Lucy intimately. He has his suspicions about her, but becomes attracted to her himself. When the truth comes out, Lucy will have to answer for her actions...In While You Were Sleeping, a bona fide star is born in actress Sandra Bullock. Although her performance in Love Potion No. 9 is just as brilliant, the film itself didn't enjoy the commercial success necessary to propel her stardom. In While You Were Sleeping, Bullock gets the recognition she deserves. Her sweet, shy demeanor, coupled with a talent for slapstick comedy, makes her character quite relatable and easy to like. Bullock has a great feel for delivering her lines, and it's obvious in this picture.With a classic 'character trapped in a lie' plotline, While You Were Sleeping relies upon the onscreen relationship between actress Sandra Bullock and actor Bill Pullman. The two pull it off well, and the audience takes an instant liking to all the characters involved. In the end, the viewer has to root for the two to get together, and when an audience becomes emotionally involved in the outcome of a film, then you've got a definite hit on your hands. While You Were Sleeping is one of those movies, and that's why it earns its designation as a must-see film...The DVD Report",5,A truly charming romantic comedy...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2873,"['One', 'surprise', 'films', '1995', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'one', 'top', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'decade', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'breakout', 'role', 'loveable', 'lead', 'character', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'name', 'year', 'release', 'Independence', 'Day', 'where', 'performed', 'masterfully', 'president', 'Overall', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'classic', 'feel-good', 'love', 'story', 'enough', 'comedy', 'avoid', 'earning', 'designation', 'soppy', 'chick', 'flick.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'role', 'Lucy', 'Eleanor', 'Moderatz', 'Chicago', 'subway', 'ticket-taker', 'who', 'away', 'hours', 'life', 'trapped', 'ticket', 'booth', 'tracks', 'day', 'Peter', 'Callaghan', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'passes', 'daily', 'commute', 'work', 'Lucy', 'managed', 'develop', 'crush', 'man', 'name', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'fantasizing', 'life', 'together', 'never', 'word', 'When', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'gang', 'thugs', 'beat', 'up', 'Peter', 'leave', 'tracks', 'Risking', 'own', 'life', 'Lucy', 'Peter', 'oncoming', 'train', 'summons', 'medical', 'help.While', 'hospital', 'nurse', 'man', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'when', 'Peter', 'family', 'up', 'hospital', 'nurse', 'same', 'information', 'Shocked', 'Peter', 'had', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'knew', 'nothing', 'about', 'nonetheless', 'take', 'Lucy', 'wing', 'Afraid', 'reveal', 'truth', 'Lucy', 'along', 'lie', 'Peter', 'coma', 'When', 'Peter', 'up', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Lucy', 'lie', 'telling', 'amnesia', 'Meanwhile', 'Peter', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'know', 'Lucy', 'intimately', 'suspicions', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'When', 'truth', 'out', 'Lucy', 'will', 'have', 'answer', 'actions', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'bona', 'fide', 'star', 'born', 'actress', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'performance', 'Love', 'Potion', 'No', '9', 'just', 'brilliant', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'commercial', 'success', 'necessary', 'propel', 'stardom', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'Bullock', 'recognition', 'Her', 'sweet', 'shy', 'demeanor', 'coupled', 'talent', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'character', 'quite', 'relatable', 'easy', 'like', 'Bullock', 'great', 'feel', 'delivering', 'lines', 'obvious', 'picture.With', 'classic', ""'character"", 'trapped', 'lie', 'plotline', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'relies', 'onscreen', 'relationship', 'actress', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'actor', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'two', 'pull', 'off', 'well', 'audience', 'instant', 'liking', 'characters', 'involved', 'end', 'viewer', 'root', 'two', 'get', 'together', 'when', 'audience', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'outcome', 'film', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'definite', 'hit', 'hands', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'one', 'movies', 'why', 'designation', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",While You Were Sleeping VHS

Bullock) who is completely alone for the holidays. Lucy is in love with Peter, but it is from afar- really far-they have never met. So, lonely Lucy has no love, no real friends, and works every holiday because she is the only Metro employee without a family. Fate takes a hand, however, and she ends up saving the life of her handsome stranger (Peter).  At the hospital, Peter's family then mistakes her for the man's fiancee, and miscommunications abound.  What could have been a really corny, screwball type comedy, is stopped by Bullock's portryal of Lucy. Lucy is so earnest that you do not question the idea that there was no way for her to clear up the misunderstanding with the stranger's family (who practically adopt her for the Christmas season). Lucy needed them and they needed her to bring them closer to their son, who had become estranged over the years.This warm and fuzzy story takes an interesting turn when the family's other son, Jack meets Lucy and Peter comes out of the hospital...There is almost ""It's A Wonderful Life"" message to this film, which totes  ""life doesn't turn always out the way you plan.""

The remarkable ease with which the actors and director Jon Turteltaub pull it off reminds me of Billy Wilder's Sabrina (which was likely an inspiration for the two brothers' odd relationship in While You Were Sleeping) or some other sophisticated black and white comedy.  Sandra Bullock is a very endearing actress to watch with a great smile and likable personality.  Even when she's overstretched emotionally by all the crazy goings-on in this story, there's a special charm to her exasperation.  Bill Pullman is very appealing as the romantic lead she falls in love with.  (While watching it, I often envisioned Kirk Douglas in the role because of some similarities of mannerisms.)Romantic comedies take life seriously but with a lot of optimism.  I enjoy the genre because I love the clever writing and story developments.  This is one of my favorites.  Its humor is probably even cleaner than some black and white romantic comedies, and there's fairly little cussing.

383060,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6303637574,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","1995 was the year that Sandra Bullock challenged Meg Ryan for the title of America's Cinema Sweetheart.  ""The Net"" and this film particularly both released in 1995 were responsible.  My wife loves this movie, it's one of her all-time favorite romantic comedies and for me while not one of my top all-time favorites, I think it's one of the best of its genre in the 1990's.  ""While You Were Sleeping"" has a simplicity and a sweetness without being saccharine, a beguiling, charming cast headed by Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman giving breakthrough performances.Lucy Moderatz (Sandra Bullock) is a young, lonely Chicago Transit Authority token collector.  An only child, her mother died when Lucy was a baby, her father died just the year before.  All she has is her cat and her apartment; there is no man in her life.  Lucy has a crush on a nameless handsome young professional (Peter Gallagher) who is a daily commuter who doesn't notice her.  On Christmas Day, Lucy works since she is the only one in her team that is without a family.  To her horror her mystery crush is mugged before her eyes and either falls or is pushed onto the tracks.  Lucy jumps onto the tracks and rescues the unconscious stranger just in the nick of time, pulling him out of the way of an oncoming train.  She accompanies him to the hospital, but at first she isn't allowed into the ER, since he's in a coma and in critical condition.  Lucy sadly muses aloud ""I was going to marry him"", she is overheard by a nurse who assumes she is the man's fianc&eacute;e.The patient's family arrives understandably upset.  They are the Callaghans, the father ""Ox"",(Peter Boyle) the mother ""Midge""(Micole Mercurio), Grandma Elsie (Glynis Johns) , little sister Mary (Monica Keena) and close family friend Saul (Jack Warden).  The nurse mistakenly tells the family that Lucy is Peter's (the name of the victim) fianc&eacute;e.  The family warmly accepts her, and Lucy at first is embarrassed to admit the truth, and worried also that doing so might cause Grandma Elsie who has a heart condition to have an attack.  That first night Lucy returns to the hospital to sit with the comatose Peter and tells him the truth, which is overheard by Saul unseen by Lucy.  In the next couple of days, Lucy spends more time with the Callaghans and is drawn in by their quirky, yet loving ways, and begins to care deeply for them.  Saul tells Lucy he knows her secret, but will not tell the Callaghans until the right moment.  However Peter's younger brother Jack (Bill Pullman) is initially suspicious of Lucy, but he too accepts her.  As they are thrown together the friendship he feels for her deepens, as does her feeling for him.  Then on New Year's Eve, Peter awakens from his coma, but although he remembers all his family, he can't remember Lucy as his ""fianc&eacute;e"", and is told he has selective amnesia.  That's all, I don't want to reveal anything else, and you'll need to see the film to see how it all is resolved.It's a shame that the Academy Awards rarely give comic or romantic comic performances the recognition they deserve.  Like Meg Ryan in ""When Harry Met Sally"", another beautifully realized portrayal, Sandra Bullock's Lucy was also ignored with not even a nomination come Oscar time.  Unfortunately, it seems the Academy will always be drawn to the heavy dramatics, even though comedy is more difficult to play.  Sandra Bullock really comes into her own as an actress in this movie.  Yes she has the atypical charm of the romantic ing&eacute;nue or heroine, but in her quiet soliloquy to the unconscious Peter she has a poignancy and depth that touches the heart of the viewer.  You can empathize with Lucy's loneliness; everyone I think has been lonely at one point in their lives. Sandra Bullock in her straightforward manner, devoid of self-pity, gives Lucy a simple dignity that makes one come to care for her Lucy and root for her success.  Yet, she's winsome and charming and shows true star quality, she shines onscreen.After the previous year's ""Sleepless in Seattle"" when Bill Pullman's character lost Meg Ryan to Tom Hanks, it was refreshing to see his character as the romantic hero, and get the girl in the process.  He has a low keyed, easy going manner, a wry sense of humor, and most importantly has a potent chemistry with Sandra Bullock.  Both bring out the best in each other.The rest of the cast all excellent, and provide the necessary support to Bullock and Pullman to make them sparkle all the more.  Tip of the hat to Peter Gallagher as the bewildered self-absorbed Peter, Peter Boyle as Ox, doing a kinder, brighter version of his later character in ""Everyone Loves Raymond"", Jack Warden as Peter's caring godfather Saul, who's like another member of the Callaghans.  I don't want to forget the ladies, Mercole Mercurio as the cozy Midge, Glynis Johns, always a welcome addition as Grandma Elsie, Monica Keena cute without being cloying as Mary, and finally Ally Walker as Ashley, Peter's former fianc&eacute;e from hell.The screenplay by Daniel G. Sullivan and Frederic LeBow is deftly written, and the Chicago locations add a nice note of authenticity.  Another plus is the opening credits rolling while Natalie Cole belts her classic ""This will be (an everlasting love)!""Given that the film starts on Christmas Day and goes through New Year's, this has become a holiday tradition in our home, watched at least once during the Christmas season.  However, we also will view it through the year, and I highly recommend you do the same at least once.  I think you'll find it's a keeper, and well worth the $5.40 plus shipping you will spend at Amazon!",5,"""I went from being all alone to being a fianc&eacute;e, a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister

As Lucy, a tollbooth worker smitten with Peter, a daily commuter, Sandra really pulls off being the type of girl you fall in love with for many many reasons.  The scoop is that Lucy saves Peter after he's mugged and falls to the train tracks below.  At the hospital in order to see Peter she lies and tells the nurse she's his fiancee.  The nurse in turn tells the family and before Peter can wake from his coma he's got a new bride-to-be.  Heres the problem...after Peter wakes up Lucy realizes that she prefers his brother and so the spiral towards her confession starts.  This is a great movie, heartwarming, funny, and sad all at the same time.

And the Fear is its central protagonist, Lucy.  Cut off from the Family, unpoliced by her father, she is a single woman with an unlimited, socially disruptive potential for promiscuity, to the point where every man in the film, young or old, rich or poor, can be plausibly linked to her as a partner.  The film's movement is to rein this potential wild card in, bring her back to the Family, to a site where privacy is given up in exchange for comfort, where one is constantly being looked at by others.  In such a scenario, Peter the coma-guy is not so much her ideal better half as her bad double - he IS promiscuous, he lives his life away from the family.This gives a dark edge to what is a film smirking like a Nora Ephron clone, especially if we switch the film's focus from its apparent heroine onto Bill Pullman's Jack (which I would advise those with sensitive stomachs to do, those immune to Ms. Bullock's 'charms').  He is a kind of detective-spy, investigating Lucy to ensure that she is family-worthy and controllable.  This is not to say that there aren't tensions - Jack wants to leave his dad's business; but there is no question of him leaving the family circle, which simply absorbs outsider-goodness, in the shapes of Lucy and godfather Saul.  Indeed, fathers and their children is a major sub-theme, with Lucy looking for someone to replace her idealised dad.To be honest, 'Sleeping' is only truly enjoyable whenever the wonderful Peter Gallagher is on screen, his breezing egotism a breath of fresh air in an atmosphere dank with goodwill.  But if this film plays Peter's dream - and it IS HE who is sleeping - and all the characters are reflections of HIS ego, than the film opens up far more interesting possibilities.",3,Romantic comedy as social surveillance.,1010793600,"01 12, 2002",2002,1857,"['trading', 'amiably', 'casual', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'actual', 'fact', 'Horror', 'Film', 'Fear', 'central', 'protagonist', 'Lucy', 'Cut', 'off', 'Family', 'unpoliced', 'father', 'single', 'woman', 'unlimited', 'socially', 'disruptive', 'potential', 'promiscuity', 'point', 'where', 'man', 'film', 'young', 'old', 'rich', 'poor', 'can', 'be', 'plausibly', 'linked', 'partner', 'film', 'movement', 'rein', 'potential', 'wild', 'card', 'bring', 'back', 'Family', 'site', 'where', 'privacy', 'given', 'up', 'exchange', 'comfort', 'where', 'one', 'constantly', 'being', 'looked', 'others', 'such', 'scenario', 'Peter', 'coma-guy', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'ideal', 'better', 'half', 'bad', 'double', 'promiscuous', 'life', 'away', 'family.This', 'dark', 'edge', 'what', 'film', 'smirking', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'clone', 'especially', 'switch', 'film', 'focus', 'apparent', 'heroine', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Jack', 'would', 'advise', 'sensitive', 'stomachs', 'do', 'immune', 'Ms.', 'Bullock', ""'charms"", 'kind', 'detective-spy', 'investigating', 'Lucy', 'ensure', 'family-worthy', 'controllable', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'tensions', 'Jack', 'leave', 'dad', 'business', 'question', 'leaving', 'family', 'circle', 'simply', 'outsider-goodness', 'shapes', 'Lucy', 'godfather', 'Saul', 'Indeed', 'fathers', 'children', 'major', 'sub-theme', 'Lucy', 'looking', 'someone', 'replace', 'idealised', 'dad.To', 'be', 'honest', ""'Sleeping"", 'only', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'whenever', 'wonderful', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'screen', 'breezing', 'egotism', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'atmosphere', 'dank', 'goodwill', 'film', 'Peter', 'dream', 'HE', 'who', 'sleeping', 'characters', 'are', 'reflections', 'HIS', 'ego', 'film', 'up', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'possibilities']",While You Were Sleeping VHS

Ambivalence.  Mas y menos.  Occasional yawns.  Occasional chuckles.  Occasional urges to change the channel.  The story is at least intriguing.  A bored, lonely transit token taker (try to say that fast three times) named Lucy (Sandra Bullock) has a crush on a suave passenger she sees on a daily basis; only the suave dude named Peter (Peter Gallagher) has no idea he is the object of Lucy's heartfelt desires.  One unfortunate day Peter is mugged alongside the subway tracks and is knocked unconscious; alarmed, Lucy leaves her booth and pulls him off the tracks before Peter becomes subway road pizza.  She accompanies him to the nearest hospital, and via a chain of awkward events tells staffers she is Peter's fiance, then sticks to her story when Peter's concerned family rushes in.  Thus Peter lies in a coma as Lucy digs herself into a deeper hole, then falls in love with Peter's family, then especially falls in love with Peter's brother Jack (Bill Pullman).  And of course Jack falls for Lucy, which makes him torn between his feelings for her and his devotion to his brother (who is unaware all of this is taking place).  Everything rolls predictably to the inevitable ""come clean"" scene--right at the altar, mind you--causing Lucy to experience considerable angst, followed by the kittens and butterflies ending.Bullock was born to play the lead in chick flicks, and here she's good as the lonely, somewhat frumpish spinster in need of a shake-up in her meandering life.  Pullman is rather wooden, while Gallagher gets the lion's share of comedic facial expressions (by the end of this film, his character becomes the definition of confused).  Other performances include Peter Boyle as the father of the brothers, and Jack Warden as an ornery, somewhat cantankerous old family friend and godfather to Peter.  The class warfare subplot is duly noted; Peter is a successful lawyer, yet somewhat of a lout, while Jack is the hardworking blue collar yeoman with aspirations of building furniture as a career.  How noble.  In any event, if chick flicks are your cup of joe then WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING will float your boat.

383082,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6303637574,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 6]","Even though she showed a deft touch for racist vitriol in Paul Haggis' ""Crash"", Sandra Bullock will forever be etched as the lovable girl-next-door from this winsome 1995 romantic comedy directed by Jon Turteltaub. In a vehicle that was written originally for Demi Moore by Daniel G. Sullivan and Fredric Lebow, Bullock shines as Lucy Moderatz, a lonely token collector at a Chicago L-train station. The plot focuses almost completely on Lucy and how she becomes involved with not only Peter Callaghan, the object of her romantic fantasies, but his loving family as well. It all turns on a train platform incident where muggers have pushed Peter onto the tracks at which point Lucy saves him from an oncoming train.The seemingly innocent deception begins when a hospital nurse assumes that Lucy is Peter's fianc&eacute;e. Since he is comatose and she is smitten with the man she thinks he is, the charade gets bigger as the Callaghans welcome her with open arms. However, the inevitable complications ensue when Peter's brother Jack enters the picture at first suspicious but then...well, you can figure out the rest. There are definitely some narrative lapses that make this film less than logical, for example, the Callaghan's somewhat blas&eacute; attitude toward Peter's comatose state once they meet Lucy. Regardless, Turteltaub manages to make the lightweight film feel like a throwback to an earlier era of romantic comedies.Bill Pullman makes a nice, casual leading man as Jack, and there is genuine chemistry between the two stars. The rest of the cast is sharp and funny, in particular, Peter Boyle as the Callaghan paterfamilias, a far warmer variation than his ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" curmudgeon; Glynis Johns as the dotty grandmother, not that far removed from her maternal suffragette in ""Mary Poppins""; Michael Rispoli as Lucy's persistent suitor and wannabe cross-dresser, Joe Jr.; Jack Warden as understanding Uncle Saul; and Peter Gallagher nicely underplaying the less-than-ideal Peter. But it's Bullock's show, and no matter how many times she has recycled her persona on lesser comedies since then, it's her sincerity, self-deprecating manner and plain-faced beauty that makes this movie one of the better studio confections of the 1990's.

When I came across WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, I let out an ""Aha!""  I recalled that the bulk of that movie's action took place during the Christmas season--even though I also recalled that it was released to theaters in the spring.Sometimes movies with farfetched premises benefit from being set in the holiday season.  It's a magical time for many of us, and we are sometimes more generous toward and believing of the fantastical elements in such tales.  (Even if they are released in May.)  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING has as gimmicky a premise as you could conceive of: Chicago working class girl (transit worker Sandra Bullock) worships yuppie lawyer from afar, saves  his life and gets mistaken for his fiancee by his loving, kooky and--as it turns out--equally working class family (since the yuppie lawyer, played[?] by Peter Gallagher is conveniently in a coma, he can't set the record straight).  But then, the working class gal meets and falls big for the lawyer's regular guy brother (Bill Pullman) and all kinds of complications and highjinks ensue.It's all very ""high concept,"" in a way, except that if I read the definition of that film term correctly, ""high concept"" is one or two sentence summation used as a sales pitch when marketing a film to a producer.  And for the life of me, I can't really see summarizing WYWS's gimmick into two punchy sentences (the ones penned above, you'll note, are rife with subordinate clauses).  The flick's got an angle, obviously, but I'm glad it wasn't my job to market it.Which is not to say that despite the film's rickety premise and obvious hokum, it's not enjoyable.  Many viewers just love this movie, and I've actually discovered that there are some folks in my circle who drag it out every holiday season along with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and WHITE CHRISTMAS.  (And I thought *I* was being so clever last Dec. 25!)  Bullock and Pullman are appealing actors and serve this vehicle very well.  The rest of the cast(which includes reliable character actors like Glynis Johns, Jack Albertson and Peter Boyle) is also fine, if sometimes a little manic.  As is the overall pacing.Suspension of disbelief is key to appreciating this film's good qualities.  It did not occur to me the first time I watched this movie that if Chicago is anything at all like NYC (closer to my own stomping grounds), the story of a transit worker who rescued her fiance would have been all over the tabloids and the local broadcast news.  In other words, there would have been no way that her (actually inadvertent) little ruse would not have come to light within a day or so.  It certainly would not have just been a family affair as it is in the movie.But it was Christmastime and a time for fairy tales and happy endings.  And maybe I subconsciously gave the film a few extra points for giving my own family name (spelled the old Irish way) to the warm, kooky family.  I even forgave the fact that like many movies of this genre, it actually alternated from being at times genuinely cute and endearing to sometimes being too cute by at least half.  The movie probably would not have gelled quite as well with other actors in the leads, but even though both Pullman and Bullock have taken on and pulled off more challenging roles in recent years, they are ideally cast here.And that counts for something.",3,Holiday Bon Bon,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,3455,"['Last', 'Christmas', 'home', 'nursing', 'broken', 'arm', 'started', 'rummage', 'collection', 'find', 'unusual', 'Christmas', 'fare', 'When', 'came', 'YOU', 'WERE', 'SLEEPING', 'let', 'out', 'Aha', 'recalled', 'bulk', 'movie', 'action', 'took', 'place', 'Christmas', 'season', 'even', 'also', 'recalled', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'spring.Sometimes', 'movies', 'farfetched', 'premises', 'benefit', 'being', 'set', 'holiday', 'season', 'magical', 'time', 'many', 'are', 'sometimes', 'more', 'generous', 'believing', 'fantastical', 'elements', 'such', 'tales', 'Even', 'are', 'released', 'May', 'YOU', 'WERE', 'SLEEPING', 'as', 'gimmicky', 'premise', 'could', 'conceive', 'Chicago', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'transit', 'worker', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'yuppie', 'lawyer', 'afar', 'life', 'mistaken', 'fiancee', 'loving', 'kooky', 'out', 'equally', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'yuppie', 'lawyer', 'played', '[', ']', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'conveniently', 'coma', 'ca', ""n't"", 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'then', 'working', 'class', 'gal', 'meets', 'big', 'lawyer', 'regular', 'guy', 'brother', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'kinds', 'complications', 'highjinks', 'ensue.It', 'very', 'high', 'concept', 'way', 'read', 'definition', 'film', 'term', 'correctly', 'high', 'concept', 'one', 'two', 'sentence', 'summation', 'used', 'sales', 'pitch', 'when', 'marketing', 'film', 'producer', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'summarizing', 'WYWS', 'gimmick', 'two', 'punchy', 'sentences', 'ones', 'penned', ""'ll"", 'note', 'are', 'rife', 'subordinate', 'clauses', 'flick', 'got', 'angle', 'obviously', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'job', 'market', 'it.Which', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'rickety', 'premise', 'obvious', 'hokum', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'Many', 'viewers', 'just', 'love', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'discovered', 'are', 'folks', 'circle', 'who', 'drag', 'out', 'holiday', 'season', 'IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', 'WHITE', 'CHRISTMAS', 'thought', '*I*', 'was', 'being', 'so', 'clever', 'last', 'Dec', '25', 'Bullock', 'Pullman', 'are', 'appealing', 'actors', 'serve', 'vehicle', 'very', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'reliable', 'character', 'actors', 'Glynis', 'Johns', 'Jack', 'Albertson', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'also', 'fine', 'sometimes', 'little', 'manic', 'overall', 'pacing.Suspension', 'disbelief', 'key', 'appreciating', 'film', 'good', 'qualities', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'Chicago', 'anything', 'like', 'NYC', 'closer', 'own', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'story', 'transit', 'worker', 'who', 'rescued', 'fiance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tabloids', 'local', 'broadcast', 'news', 'other', 'words', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'actually', 'inadvertent', 'little', 'ruse', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'come', 'light', 'day', 'so', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'family', 'affair', 'movie.But', 'was', 'Christmastime', 'time', 'fairy', 'tales', 'happy', 'endings', 'maybe', 'subconsciously', 'gave', 'film', 'few', 'extra', 'points', 'giving', 'own', 'family', 'name', 'spelled', 'old', 'Irish', 'way', 'warm', 'kooky', 'family', 'even', 'forgave', 'fact', 'many', 'movies', 'genre', 'actually', 'alternated', 'being', 'times', 'genuinely', 'cute', 'endearing', 'sometimes', 'being', 'too', 'cute', 'least', 'half', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gelled', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'actors', 'leads', 'even', 'Pullman', 'Bullock', 'have', 'taken', 'pulled', 'off', 'more', 'challenging', 'roles', 'recent', 'years', 'are', 'ideally', 'cast', 'here.And', 'something']",While You Were Sleeping VHS
383100,A23INOBJ1LVGNM,6303637574,G. Wayne Cochran,"[1, 1]","While You Were Sleeping is a movie about a lonely Chicago Transit Authority worker finding true love. Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) works in a collection booth for the Chicago Transit Authority, daydreaming about a well dressed, handsome man named Peter Callaghan (Gallagher) that is one of the daily commuters. On Christmas day, Lucy saves his life from being run over by a train, but he is left comatose. Due to an unforeseen turn of events, his family believes she is engaged to Peter. Things get even more complicated for Lucy when she meets Peter's brother, Jack (Pullman). Lucy has to juggle her feelings for Peter and Jack while trying to maintain the accidental deception to their family.One of the things that sets While You Were Sleeping apart from other romantic comedies that came before it is that it doesn't take itself as seriously as movies like Sleepless In Seattle or When Harry Met Sally do. The comedic timing of the cast is perfect for this movie, and the comedic moments do not feel forced or contrived.

Well, soon afterwards, we had all seen the movie and we, the men , hesitantly agreed that it was a really enjoyable movie.It has humor, sentimental characters, and for me, most importantly, genuiness. Sandra B. does an incredible job in not overacting and being terrifically believable as young Lucy who is just looking for love. Her speech at the wedding when explaining the why of the whole charade makes me cry every time.I'm really glad that I have the DVD, just for the picture and the durability of the format.

Hertel ""Jane Marple""","[3, 5]","The story is sweet and could have been sticky, and yet it is a deep, touching movie about loneliness, with a happy ending for many (Lucy, all the family). The casting deserves an Oscar, it is perfect. Though if I had been asked if I would chose Bill Pullmann, before I saw him, I would have said no, for I could not detect any sex appeal in him in Sleepless in Seattle. I know better now. He is a terrific actor, that is why I have not noticed before how attractive he is! He can play the clumsy niceguy and you cannot imagine you would like to be touched by him.  In While you were Sleeping, I developed a crush for him, he could touch me any time! The movie can be seen again and again, and never gets boring, instead one discovers little ""Schmankerl"" by listening better to the dialogs. One wants to sit among the family at the dinner table when they have this hilarious conversation, where both Jack and Lucy for the first time share the same sense of humour and enjoy it. Sharing the same sense of humor is most important for a lasting relationship/marriage. One wants to know more about what happened after he proposes in the toll booth, one wants to know how they lived after they married. The best scene? Not just one: definitely when they slipped on the ice, but also when Jack explains what leaning is and Joe jr. interrupts and asks ""is this guy bothering you? I know carate"", and when Joe jr. cried about Miss 3rd floor and Lucy invites him to try on her shoes again. This scene shows that the makers of this film had the true Christian spirit: understanding, caring, and accepting that loneliness has many faces, and how charitable it is to be tolerant and not condemming. Anyone saying this film is ""only"" a comedy? They ought to see the film again, for it is so much much more. Anyone saying this film is not realistic? Think again! Lucy was lonely, but brave, has a loving and kind heart, it is very realistic that she daydreams about one man, and truly falls in love with another. It is a fact that if you are romantic and admit it, romantic things will happen to you. Same holds true that if you do not believe in love, you most probably will never feel the breathlessness and the sparks.

It's a cute, warm and funny story of Lucy (Sandra Bullock) who falls in love with a guy (Peter) she's never met before (played by The O.C's Peter Gallagher).  She saves him one day after he was pushed to the tracks in Chicago's El system.  When they won't let her in to see him because she isn't family, she mumbles to herself that she was going to marry that guy and a nurse overhears this and assumes she's the fiance.  Just before she can correct that faux pas, Peters family come to see him and she can't back out of it.  Now there is a facade to pull off but not before she falls in love with Peter's brother, Jack.  Oy vey.It's such a cute store and if you are a fan of romantic comedies, then this is for you.  I love her pain in the neck yet well meaning neighbour Joe Jnr.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 4]","Sandra Bullock has a natural way of acting that makes you wonder whether she is as she comes across on the screen.  You can discern her character from ""Speed"" in this movie, albeit a more relaxed version of that character.  It's Sandra's charm that will entrance a viewer and give you a warm and fuzzy feeling by the end of the movie.Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) is alone and lonely, aggravated by her job as a token taker for the Chicago Transit system.  Her father passed away the previous year, she has no close friends, and her mother passed away many years earlier.  Each morning a handsome and somewhat debonair man stops by her window.  Lucy is in love with him in her mind, but he never talks to her, and it is not likely that he will.On another lonely Christmas Day Lucy is stuck working while all her co-workers are at home with their families.  The debonair gentleman comes to her window and wishes her a Merry Christmas, and suddenly Lucy finds herself at a total loss for words.  As Lucy is berating herself for her sudden lack of verbal skill, the handsome man is accosted by two thugs who attempt to rob him.  In the course of the robbery, the man is shoved onto the railroad tracks, where a train is imminent.Lucy rushes out of her cage as the thugs run away, jumps down onto the tracks, and pulls the man off the rails just as a train rushes over the spot where he was lying but moments before.  Concerned for the man's welfare, Lucy follows him to the hospital, where a nurse overhears Lucy muttering to herself, and believes Lucy to be the man's fianc&eacute;.  Suddenly Lucy is in the middle of a big, friendly family.  The handsome man is Peter Callaghan, played by Peter Gallagher, an attorney.Lucy loves being part of the family, and they quickly grow to love her.  However, Lucy soon meets Jack Callaghan, Peter's brother, played by Bill Pullman, and Lucy grows to love Bill.  Of course, we know that eventually Peter must wake up, and Lucy must be found out.  The events that take us from the accident to the end of the movie are sometimes predictable, but Sandra and Bill carry the movie with their natural and mellow relationship.While Sandra and Bill are the main characters, there are quite a few other actors that add spice to this movie, most particularly Jack Warden, but also Peter Boyle, Glynis Johns, and Michael Rispoli as Lucy's landlord's son Joe Fusco, Jr., aka Joey, Jr.  Michael provides an bizarre contrast as Lucy discovers him in her closet trying on a pair of her shoes, and Lucy makes mention of 900 numbers drawing a response of ""How did you find out about that"" from Joey, Jr.This movie is light romantic comedy.  There are a few moments of outright hilarity reminiscent of the much more dysfunctional family in ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.""  Most of the humor is more laid back and feel good.  By the end of the movie you want to hug Sandra Bullock (actually, throughout most of the movie too) and tell her everything is going to be all right.This feel-good movie is perfect for Christmas and winter, and for those who want to believe in fairy tales and that good things happen to good people.",4,Romantic Comedy that Gives You a Warm and Fuzzy Feeling,1057881600,"07 11, 2003",2003,3148,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'natural', 'way', 'acting', 'wonder', 'screen', 'can', 'discern', 'character', 'Speed', 'movie', 'more', 'relaxed', 'version', 'character', 'Sandra', 'charm', 'will', 'entrance', 'viewer', 'give', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'end', 'movie.Lucy', 'Moderatz', 'Bullock', 'alone', 'lonely', 'aggravated', 'job', 'token', 'taker', 'Chicago', 'Transit', 'system', 'father', 'passed', 'away', 'previous', 'year', 'close', 'friends', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'many', 'years', 'earlier', 'morning', 'handsome', 'somewhat', 'debonair', 'man', 'stops', 'window', 'Lucy', 'love', 'mind', 'never', 'not', 'likely', 'lonely', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'Lucy', 'stuck', 'working', 'co-workers', 'are', 'home', 'families', 'debonair', 'gentleman', 'window', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'suddenly', 'Lucy', 'total', 'loss', 'words', 'Lucy', 'berating', 'sudden', 'lack', 'verbal', 'skill', 'handsome', 'man', 'accosted', 'two', 'thugs', 'who', 'attempt', 'rob', 'course', 'robbery', 'man', 'shoved', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'where', 'train', 'imminent.Lucy', 'rushes', 'cage', 'thugs', 'run', 'away', 'jumps', 'down', 'tracks', 'man', 'rails', 'just', 'train', 'rushes', 'spot', 'where', 'was', 'lying', 'moments', 'Concerned', 'man', 'welfare', 'Lucy', 'hospital', 'where', 'nurse', 'overhears', 'Lucy', 'muttering', 'herself', 'Lucy', 'be', 'man', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Suddenly', 'Lucy', 'middle', 'big', 'friendly', 'family', 'handsome', 'man', 'Peter', 'Callaghan', 'played', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'attorney.Lucy', 'being', 'part', 'family', 'quickly', 'grow', 'love', 'However', 'Lucy', 'soon', 'Jack', 'Callaghan', 'Peter', 'brother', 'played', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Lucy', 'love', 'Bill', 'course', 'know', 'eventually', 'Peter', 'must', 'wake', 'up', 'Lucy', 'must', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'events', 'take', 'accident', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'sometimes', 'predictable', 'Sandra', 'Bill', 'carry', 'movie', 'natural', 'mellow', 'relationship.While', 'Sandra', 'Bill', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'actors', 'add', 'spice', 'movie', 'most', 'particularly', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'also', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Glynis', 'Johns', 'Michael', 'Rispoli', 'Lucy', 'landlord', 'son', 'Joe', 'Fusco', 'Jr.', 'aka', 'Joey', 'Jr.', 'Michael', 'bizarre', 'contrast', 'Lucy', 'closet', 'trying', 'pair', 'shoes', 'Lucy', 'mention', '900', 'numbers', 'drawing', 'response', 'How', 'did', 'find', 'out', 'Joey', 'Jr.This', 'movie', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'outright', 'hilarity', 'reminiscent', 'much', 'more', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'Most', 'humor', 'more', 'laid', 'back', 'feel', 'good', 'end', 'movie', 'want', 'hug', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'actually', 'most', 'movie', 'too', 'tell', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'right.This', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Christmas', 'winter', 'who', 'want', 'believe', 'fairy', 'tales', 'good', 'things', 'happen', 'good', 'people']",While You Were Sleeping VHS

Then one day her whole world is overwhelmed by a kind of powerful (albeit non-lethal) tsunami - and she will be carried by this gentle but irresistible wave in a direction she would never have suspected... I will say no more here about the story.The operative words when describing this film are &#34;warm&#34;, &#34;gentle&#34; and &#34;adorable&#34;. There is absolutely nothing dark in this whole film, even if at one moment a furious shrew (Ally Walker, grandiose) appears - but even she is somehow funny rather than bad... There is also a comatose patient, a freak incident involving a crayon, some furniture breaking (mostly accidental), pants ripping (completely accidental) and of course there is Joe Fusco Jr (Michael Rispoli, fantastic) whose very existence on this planet may seem to be an aggression against the rest of humanity - but all of this just gives the occasion for more humour.Humour in this film is of best quality, with absolutely NO strong language, but with some pretty good one liners and verbal fencing. And then there is of course THE scene with the Callaghan family eating dinner together and having a conversation... Words can hardly describe this scene but I will always consider this as a great injustice that nobody was nominated to the Oscars for it...This film, together with &#34;Speed&#34;, was the beginning of Sandra Bullock's great career. Peter Boyle (greatly regretted) and Bill Pullman, who play respectively Ox Callaghan and Jack Callaghan (his second son), are two other pillars of this film.Bottom line, this is an ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE thing, which can be watched as many times as you want (with my wife we saw it no less than seven times - may be more).

Bullock is great is her natural simplicity. But it is Pullman who is perhaps the real star with his understated but deep personality. Most supporting actors are great as well, which is a real plus.I also find a message in this film, not sure whether it was intended by either its author or the director but here it is: be ready to change your life, because what you really wanted for a long time, and thought was impossible, might actually happen.

383171,A36EW68H08UOCS,6303637574,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[126, 133]","For her work after ""Speed"" my brother began referring to Sandra Bullock as ""Queen of the Chick Flicks"", and I won't disagree, although some of her films work much better for members of both sexes than others. ""While You Were Sleeping"" is an entertaining film for Guys and Dolls, and it works in repeated viewings.Sandra portrays Lucy Moderatz, who takes tolls on the L train in Chicago and from afar has an obsessive crush on the handsome, well-dressed Peter Callaghan, played by Peter Gallagher. The audience must willingly accept that someone as likable and attractive as Sandra Bullock is stuck in a dead-end job where she is lonely and works all the holidays because, after all, she doesn't have anyone to share them with.  The movie doesn't give you much time to dwell on this because before you know it, Peter is getting mugged and knocked off Lucy's train station platform where he falls unconscious onto the path of a rapidly approaching train.  Not surprisingly, Lucy jumps down and pulls the man of her dreams to safety.  Lucy then follows the comatose Peter to the hospital where a nurse overhears Lucy in one of her daydreams say ""this is the man I'm going to marry"" - which naturally leads the nurse to think that Lucy and Peter are engaged when, in fact, the only words that have passed between them are when Peter paused to say ""Merry Christmas"" as he dropped his token into Lucy's toll booth.Peter's wonderful family arrives and the misunderstanding of Lucy as Peter's fiancee is perpetuated.  Lucy could have cleared up the whole misunderstanding from the first moments but:1. Peter's family is wonderful and Lucy is lonely.2. Peter's grandmother has a ""heart condition"" and Lucy fears that telling the truth may send Grandma over the edge. (The screenwriters were clearly searching for a reason for Lucy to not just fess up....)3. Since Lucy has been fantasizing about Peter for awhile it's not that difficult for her to pretend to be his fiancee.I've heard Roger Ebert say it's not as important *what* a movie is about as *how* the movie is about that thing.This movie would be doomed to failure if it were only about some pathetic toll-taker who pretends to be engaged to her dream-boat to his family while he's in a coma.  But Lucy isn't pathetic - she's as likable and attractive as, well, Sandra Bullock, and Peter's family is full of charming, likable folks.  Peter, as things would have it, isn't as charming as Lucy dreamt.  Although he used to be in the family business of antique furniture, he went to law school and now barely keeps in touch with his family.  He has a bitchy girlfriend who is in Europe leaving calls on his answering machine while he is in a coma - one of the calls tells him ""yes, I'll marry you"".Again - it's not difficult to guess where much of this is going.  Bill Pullman plays Peter's charming, easy-going brother, Jack, who has stayed close to the family, running Dad's business.  (There is an extremely well-done low-key scene close to the end where Jack tells Dad, played by Peter Boyle, that he wants to MAKE furniture instead of just dealing it - which will mean getting out of the family business.  The scene has both a ring of authenticity, not yielding to any histrionic cliches, and at the same time maintaining the warm feelings that you've built up for both of these characters by this portion of the movie.  These kinds of scenes *make* this movie.)Jack Warden gets special kudos from me as Peter's godfather, Saul, who loves his godson, but also comes to love Lucy as well. Michael Rispoli steals a few scenes as ""Joe, Jr."" the son of Lucy's landlord.  In the early scenes Joe comes across as a shorter, heavier Andrew Dice Clay wannabe.  But by the end even Joe has become someone deserving our admiration. This is the kind of movie where you want nice things to happen to the characters - and the movie goes about it's business in a very satisfying way.",5,A Chick Flick that Guys can like too!,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,3921,"['work', 'Speed', 'brother', 'began', 'referring', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Queen', 'Chick', 'Flicks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'films', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'members', 'sexes', 'others', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'repeated', 'viewings.Sandra', 'portrays', 'Lucy', 'Moderatz', 'who', 'tolls', 'L', 'train', 'Chicago', 'afar', 'obsessive', 'crush', 'handsome', 'well-dressed', 'Peter', 'Callaghan', 'played', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'audience', 'must', 'willingly', 'someone', 'likable', 'attractive', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'stuck', 'dead-end', 'job', 'where', 'lonely', 'holidays', ""n't"", 'have', 'anyone', 'share', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'time', 'dwell', 'know', 'Peter', 'getting', 'mugged', 'knocked', 'off', 'Lucy', 'train', 'station', 'platform', 'where', 'unconscious', 'path', 'rapidly', 'approaching', 'train', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Lucy', 'down', 'man', 'dreams', 'safety', 'Lucy', 'then', 'comatose', 'Peter', 'hospital', 'where', 'nurse', 'overhears', 'Lucy', 'one', 'daydreams', 'say', 'man', ""'m"", 'going', 'marry', 'naturally', 'nurse', 'think', 'Lucy', 'Peter', 'are', 'engaged', 'when', 'fact', 'only', 'words', 'have', 'passed', 'are', 'when', 'Peter', 'paused', 'say', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'dropped', 'token', 'Lucy', 'toll', 'booth.Peter', 'wonderful', 'family', 'arrives', 'misunderstanding', 'Lucy', 'Peter', 'fiancee', 'perpetuated', 'Lucy', 'could', 'have', 'cleared', 'up', 'whole', 'misunderstanding', 'first', 'moments', 'but:1', 'Peter', 'family', 'wonderful', 'Lucy', 'lonely.2', 'Peter', 'grandmother', 'heart', 'condition', 'Lucy', 'telling', 'truth', 'may', 'send', 'Grandma', 'edge', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'clearly', 'searching', 'reason', 'Lucy', 'not', 'just', 'fess', 'up', '3', 'Lucy', 'been', 'fantasizing', 'Peter', 'not', 'difficult', 'pretend', 'be', 'fiancee.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'say', 'not', 'important', 'movie', '*how*', 'movie', 'thing.This', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'doomed', 'failure', 'were', 'only', 'pathetic', 'toll-taker', 'who', 'be', 'engaged', 'dream-boat', 'family', 'coma', 'Lucy', ""n't"", 'pathetic', 'likable', 'attractive', 'well', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Peter', 'family', 'full', 'charming', 'likable', 'folks', 'Peter', 'things', 'would', 'have', ""n't"", 'as', 'charming', 'Lucy', 'dreamt', 'used', 'be', 'family', 'business', 'antique', 'furniture', 'went', 'law', 'school', 'now', 'barely', 'touch', 'family', 'bitchy', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'Europe', 'leaving', 'calls', 'answering', 'machine', 'coma', 'one', 'calls', 'yes', ""'ll"", 'marry', '.Again', 'not', 'difficult', 'guess', 'where', 'much', 'going', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Peter', 'charming', 'easy-going', 'brother', 'Jack', 'who', 'stayed', 'close', 'family', 'running', 'Dad', 'business', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'low-key', 'scene', 'close', 'end', 'where', 'Jack', 'Dad', 'played', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'MAKE', 'furniture', 'instead', 'just', 'dealing', 'will', 'mean', 'getting', 'family', 'business', 'scene', 'ring', 'authenticity', 'not', 'yielding', 'histrionic', 'cliches', 'same', 'time', 'maintaining', 'warm', 'feelings', ""'ve"", 'built', 'up', 'characters', 'portion', 'movie', 'kinds', 'scenes', '*make*', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'special', 'kudos', 'Peter', 'godfather', 'Saul', 'who', 'godson', 'also', 'love', 'Lucy', 'as', 'well', 'Michael', 'Rispoli', 'few', 'scenes', 'Joe', 'Jr.', 'son', 'Lucy', 'landlord', 'early', 'scenes', 'Joe', 'across', 'shorter', 'heavier', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'wannabe', 'end', 'even', 'Joe', 'become', 'someone', 'deserving', 'admiration', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'want', 'nice', 'things', 'happen', 'characters', 'movie', 'business', 'very', 'satisfying', 'way']",While You Were Sleeping VHS

And if you've seen my ""About Me"" page - I wanna be just like her! But that's never gonna happen. She gets all the great leading guys - Keanu Reeves, Chris O'Donnell, Benjamin Bratt, Bill Pullman, Sylvester Stallone, Hugh Grant? OK, the last 3 depend on your tastes really. I've had this film on video for quite a while, but when I taped it off the TV, what happened? My tape ran out. So I never knew who she married or what happened. Then when I saw it to buy on DVD, I jumped at the chance. The ending ... frankly could have been better. That always happens doesn't it? You wait so long to see an ending of a film, and then it totally disappoints you. It was a good film though, although the family members could have been fleshed out a bit. And lucky Peter Gallagher or whatever his name is, got paid to lie in a coma for most of the film! This film is great if you're a romantic mood, or you're sad. It's a feel good film.

I found it very difficult, however, to see 'Lucy' dressed for work, looking as though she is homeless, and without access to a shower.  If you focus on this anomaly, you could easily project that 'Lucy' will never be happy because she thinks so little of herself.  Her hair looks dirty and unkempt, with stuck, thready, bangs, her clothing is barely that out of a bad trash bin.  Contrast that with the coworker we see in one scene.It's so bad, in fact, that there is no way she would have been allowed to look like that, and, it makes it all the more implausable, that when she is visited at work by the teenage daughter of her 'adopted' family, the girl doesn't blink an eye at 'Lucy's forelorn appearance.It is unlikely enough that 'Peter' would want to date a token-taker, (her gain, really), without the trappings.  But 'Lucy' is such so vague, even to herself, that the hot dog vendor she patronizes on a daily basis, cannot remember how she takes her hot dog, when he remembers everyone elses.Her supervisor is no friend.  A very bad line where he tells her that the only way to be part of a family is to be born into it, was not only wrong, but cruel.In the end, there is one reality here, and one fantasy, that might make you sad.

Stuck in the lie, the woman, Lucy Moderatz, joins the family for Christmas festivities and becomes close to them, including her ""fianc&eacute;e's"" younger brother, played by Bill Pullman.  High jinks ensue as the commuter, Peter Callaghan, comes to and does not remember Lucy...who could have seen that coming?  Without giving anything else away, it's a fun holiday film that spares us all those clich&eacute;d morals.  I especially enjoyed Peter Boyle's performance.  Seeing the man who made the character of Frank Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond famous play this calm, quiet man just shows this great actor's range and talent.  He and the rest of the cast are definitely worth watching.

I'm happy to see other reviewers also feel the same way I do about this movie! This is one of the few movies that I repeatedly put into my dvd player for viewing. It is one of the best romantic comedy films ever made.The story is about Lucy (Sandra Bullock), a lonely girl without family, who works in a tollbooth everyday with boredom. The only high point of her work is when she sees Peter Callahan, a man who walks by her booth everyday to catch the subway. She has not talked to him ever but hopes that one day that he too will fall in love with her. One day though, due to some circumstances, something happens to Peter and she saves Peter's life in the subway station and brings him to the hospital. Due to some misunderstandings, Peter's family think Lucy is his fianc&eacute;e and accept her as part of her family, where she gets to meet Jack (Bill Pullman). Soon Lucy finds herself in a sticky position and has to decide as to who she really loves in the end.You will never get tired of watching this movie over and over again. When you watch this film, you will laugh, cry, and feel good about yourself. Sandra Bullock did a great job of playing Lucy. The chemistry between her and Bill Pullman is wonderful throughout the movie. Also, the background music to the movie is really great!

383211,A31J176KH7ZZEY,6303637574,RedPandaLalita,"[0, 0]","My television set was left on the Oxygen network with ""While You Were Sleeping"" just playing right now, and it reminded me how I never get tired watching this movie. I've seen about 98% of Sandra Bullock's movies, and Sandra Bullock is absolutely one of my favorite actresses of all time. I've honestly never been disappointed with any Sandra Bullock film I've seen. Maybe it's because I have so much respect for Sandra Bullock as both an actress and a real human being that I always see the good and the positive in every film she has done. Sandra Bullock is very real, authentic, honest, genuine, and down-to-earth in her performances just like she in real life. Anyways, when it comes to Sandra Bullock's comedies, this movie is my favorite. I've seen this movie many times, and have it on VHS and DVD formats. I really don't need to pop in the DVD though because this movie has had many television airings. Like many Amazon reviewers have already said, Sandra is very charming, endearing, funny, and adorable in this movie. And there is good chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. The rest of the cast give great performances. This movie personally hits close to home because I was raised in Illinois, and this movie was filmed in Chicago. A lot of people, including me, can relate to Lucy's (Sandra Bullock) loneliness, especially during the holidays. You can't help but root for Lucy when she finds happiness with the Callaghan family. There are many great scenes in this movie - the Callaghan family dinner scene, Lucy feeding Peter's cat, Peter trying to test his memory by saying the alphabet (this scene brought out laughs from the audience when I first saw this movie in the movie theater), Jack giving Lucy the snow globe, Lucy saying she finally got a stamp on her passport, etc. This movie is just a heartwarming movie. When you feel down, watch this movie. I appreciate every movie that Sandra Bullock has made. And I appreciate Sandra Bullock more as a human being in real life. Sandra Bullock is a wonderful human being. Sandra was very classy in the way she handled her divorce. All I can say is that any man would be extremely lucky to have Sandra Bullock as his significant other if Sandra even decides to take the time to venture in the romance department again. I'm very happy for Sandra that she has another ""man"" in her life - her cute and adorable adopted son, Louis Bardo. I admire Sandra's determination and strength in raising her adopted son alone. Sandra Bullock is a great role model when it comes to her humility and generosity - never hesitating in giving lots of her money to those who need it - victims of 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, Haiti earthquake, Japan earthquake, etc. And I love Sandra's wit and sense of humor. You can see many glimpses of Sandra's honorable and endearing character throughout her huge film catalog. I really think ""While You Were Sleeping"" is a movie that displays Sandra Bullock at her best besides her Oscar-winning perforamce for ""The Blind Side"". It's very hard not to smile while watching this film.

383212,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6303637574,Reviewer,"[3, 4]","A sweet and gentle, romantic film about how love sometimes slips in through the window rather than coming straight in through the front door, it's the one that put star Sandra Bullock into contention with Meg Ryan for the crown of America's Sweetheart.  And with good reason, because in ""While You Were Sleeping,"" directed by Jon Turteltaub, Bullock emerges as the epitome of the modern day ""girl next door,"" in the best and most sincere sense.  This is a film that explores one of the basic tenets of the human condition, the need to love and be loved, and makes no bones about what it's trying to accomplish along the way.  Clearly, the filmmakers want to make you feel good and entertain you at the same time.  And they succeed on both fronts.Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) lives alone in Chicago, where she has an apartment, a cat and a job with the CTA as a token taker for the train.  Her life is fairly uncomplicated and uneventful (read:  Dull), and the one thing she looks forward to in her daily grind is seeing a certain young gentleman who rides the train everyday and always passes through her toll booth.  She's doesn't even know his name, and they've never exchanged so much as a ""Good morning,"" but in her mind he's become the Prince Charming she's always dreamed about.Then on Christmas morning he passes through, but while waiting on the platform for the train he gets mugged and falls onto the tracks, unconscious.  And a train is coming.  Lucy runs to his aid and saves his life, but the severe head trauma he's sustained has put him in a coma.  At the hospital, they refuse to let her in to see him, as that is a privilege reserved for family members only; so in desperation she tells them that she is his fiancee, which does the trick.  But when his family-- his rather ""large"" family-- shows up, her ruse creates something of a sticky wicket.  Everything is moving so fast and becoming so emotional that Lucy simply can't get in a word of explanation.  The next thing she knows, to the family she is their beloved Peter's (Peter Gallagher) intended (even though he's never said a word to them about her), and because the situation is so frantic and there's such concern about Peter, besides which it's Christmas, Lucy can't bring herself to tell them the truth.  So in an instant, her life is suddenly changed; she's surrounded by ""family,"" and she's ""engaged"" to her Prince Charming.  Even if he is, well...in a coma.Turteltaub has crafted and delivered a thoroughly engaging film in the tradition of Nora Ephron's ""You've Got Mail"" (the second best romantic comedy ever made) and ""Sleepless In Seattle.""  He sets a perfect pace, and presents his endearingly eclectic assemblage of characters in the best possible way-- he makes you feel at home with them.  Most importantly, though, Turteltaub manages to make this a ""sweet"" film without being ""saccharin"" about it, which would have sunk it quicker than a deflated rubber raft in an undertow.  Instead, he pulls out all the right stops to make his film entirely Ephronesque and entertaining, and it works beautifully.  The humor is warm, and as the story moves along he builds upon that strong sense of ""need"" that is universal, then triumphs by satisfying that need in the end.Sandra Bullock has never been more winning or winsome than she is here; there's a special quality about her Lucy that makes you want to reach out to her.  She is, without question, the most vulnerable character Bullock has ever played.  There is very little of Annie (""Speed"") or Gracie (""Miss Congeniality""), for example, about her; the closest to Lucy of any of her characters, in fact, would be Birdee in ""Hope Floats.""  That is not to say there is anything ""weak"" about Lucy at all-- quite the contrary, in fact.  There is a decided strength in the very benevolence of Lucy's nature, even in the way she wears her heart on her sleeve and especially inasmuch as she is not afraid to admit to herself what she really wants and needs.  This is an independent woman who accepts and meets any and all challenges of life, but keeps an open mind and, above all, an open heart.  And that is what makes Lucy so endearing; she's the one who brings a cake to the office to share with her co-workers for no other reason than the fact that it makes the world and everybody in it a little bit better.  That's what Bullock brings to her performance here, and it's what makes Lucy one of her most enduring and memorable characters.As for sliding in through the window rather than coming through the front door, that's exactly what Bill Pullman does with his portrayal of Peter's brother, Jack Callaghan.  He's the one who shows up after the fact, as it were, but very quickly makes a connection and ingratiates himself with the audience.  Initially, Jack seems to be playing the role of devil's advocate, his suspicions aroused by the fact that Peter has never mentioned Lucy to him; but that begins to change with some very subtle undertones that prove to be extremely effective.  And Pullman does a terrific job of developing his character in real time, which makes Jack convincing, and a piece of the puzzle that fits in perfectly.  A ""character actor"" type leading man, Pullman has a resume filled with varied and colorful characters, but Jack is his most engaging role ever, and he succeeds entirely with it.The wonderful supporting cast includes Jack Warden (Saul), Peter Boyle (Ox), Micole Mercurio (Midge), Michael Rispoli (Joey) and the wonderful Glynis Johns, as beautiful and charming as ever as Elsie.  Warm and poignant, ""While You Were Sleeping"" is one to savor; this one's a keeper.  (BTW, the #1 romantic comedy?

Lonely transit clerk Lucy (Sandra Bullock) saves Peter Callaghan's life.  While he languishes in a coma, Peter's family mistakes Lucy for his fiancee.  It's true Lucy is attracted to Peter (Peter Callagher) from afar, but she can't bring herself to tell the Callaghans the truth that she and Peter are not engaged.  In fact, they are virtual strangers.  The Callaghans are the tightly knit family Lucy misses, and that makes her more reluctant to set the record straight.  When they invite her over to celebrate Christmas with them, Lucy is hooked.  She meets Peter's brother, Jack (Bill Pullman), and an attraction develops.This may all sound as typical romantic comedy fluff, but ""comedy"" is the key word.  Sandra Bullock's flair for light comedy is amply demonstrated in this film.  She shines as a blue collar Audrey Hepburn.  In addition, there is an outstanding supporting cast that keeps the laughs coming fast and frequent.  Especially good is Jack Warden as Saul and his repartee with Glynis Johns, the impish grandmother.  Michael Rispoli as Joe Fusco, Jr. is hilariously boorish.  The film blends clever dialogue, romance, and warm fuzzy moments.  To the male viewers out there (recoiling in horror about now), stay with it, guys.  Enjoy the laughs and Sandra Bullock's sparkle.  Multiple viewing only enhances the rewards.  ;-)",5,A chick flick that even tough guys can love.,980294400,"01 24, 2001",2001,1434,"['great', 'date', 'movie', 'Even', 'date', 'merely', 'watching', 'home', 'spouse', 'Lonely', 'transit', 'clerk', 'Lucy', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Peter', 'Callaghan', 'life', 'coma', 'Peter', 'family', 'mistakes', 'Lucy', 'fiancee', 'true', 'Lucy', 'attracted', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'Callagher', 'afar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'tell', 'Callaghans', 'truth', 'Peter', 'are', 'not', 'engaged', 'fact', 'are', 'virtual', 'strangers', 'Callaghans', 'are', 'tightly', 'knit', 'family', 'Lucy', 'more', 'reluctant', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'When', 'invite', 'celebrate', 'Christmas', 'Lucy', 'hooked', 'Peter', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'attraction', 'develops.This', 'may', 'all', 'sound', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fluff', 'comedy', 'key', 'word', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'flair', 'light', 'comedy', 'amply', 'demonstrated', 'film', 'blue', 'collar', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'addition', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'laughs', 'coming', 'fast', 'frequent', 'Especially', 'good', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Saul', 'repartee', 'Glynis', 'Johns', 'impish', 'grandmother', 'Michael', 'Rispoli', 'Joe', 'Fusco', 'Jr.', 'hilariously', 'boorish', 'film', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'romance', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'moments', 'male', 'viewers', 'out', 'there', 'recoiling', 'horror', 'now', 'stay', 'guys', 'Enjoy', 'laughs', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'sparkle', 'Multiple', 'viewing', 'only', 'rewards']",While You Were Sleeping VHS

My husband is getting a little tired of it, but there are nights when I tell him, &quot;It's either this or 'Babe'!&quot; From the opening scene, there is something sweetly philosophical about this movie, and Sandra Bullock has never been more appealing as a funny, klutzy girl who never makes it out of Chicago. (Of course, Sandra Bullock playing a woman who is frumpy is stretching credibility a bit.) And if any woman can keep from melting when Bill Pullman focuses that sweet, intense gaze, I've yet to meet her.The vulnerability of the main characters gets you pulling for them right from the start, and the secondary characters do a wonderful job of convincing you that they are real with their own histories.Peter Boyle is hysterical as the decent, but frustrated, father of Bill Pullman. And Peter Gallegher does a star turn as a handsome, spoiled &quot;putz,&quot; as one of the characters calls him. Glynis Johns is laugh-out-loud funny as the sweetly confused grandmother.All in all, this is a movie that is well worth watching over and over again, especially when you need a little reminder that love is waiting out there for us all.",5,The SWEETEST movie!,1050624000,"04 18, 2003",2003,1258,"['Were', 'Sleeping', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'DVD', 'least', '20', 'times', 'husband', 'getting', 'little', 'tired', 'are', 'nights', 'when', 'tell', 'quot', ""'Babe"", 'quot', 'opening', 'scene', 'something', 'sweetly', 'philosophical', 'movie', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'appealing', 'funny', 'klutzy', 'girl', 'who', 'never', 'Chicago', 'course', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'playing', 'woman', 'who', 'frumpy', 'stretching', 'credibility', 'bit', 'woman', 'can', 'keep', 'melting', 'when', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'sweet', 'intense', 'gaze', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'meet', 'her.The', 'vulnerability', 'main', 'characters', 'pulling', 'right', 'start', 'secondary', 'characters', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'convincing', 'are', 'real', 'own', 'histories.Peter', 'Boyle', 'hysterical', 'decent', 'frustrated', 'father', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Peter', 'Gallegher', 'star', 'turn', 'handsome', 'spoiled', 'quot', 'quot', 'one', 'characters', 'Glynis', 'Johns', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'sweetly', 'confused', 'grandmother.All', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'especially', 'when', 'need', 'little', 'reminder', 'love', 'waiting', 'out', 'there']",While You Were Sleeping VHS

She gradually falls for him, until one day a chance accident causes Lucy to be heroic and saves the man's life. Perhaps this is her chance to win the guy over.She meets his family at the hospital where 'Peter' lies in a come. They all love her and think she's a great catch. They buy her story she's the girlfriend and the scene is set; She will just have to hope that when Peter wakes up he will think it's a great idea too.Okay, simple, cheesy, yeah, kind of predictable, but effective. What a love story!But, maybe 'cause it was the 90's (or maybe the writers stuffed up) they throw in a twist. Along comes Peter's brother. Jack. Jack is as smug as he is full-of-himself, swaggering and confident. Lucy is clearly smitten as he talks himself up.And then, if that wasn't bad enough, he suddenly turns into this sensitive, sad person who has self-esteem issues because he's a working class guy and no-one wants him, they want his rich, business man brother. Teenage-angst hogwash.If seeing Jack go from 'I'm a big man who drives big trucks and lifts heavy furniture' to 'poor me, no one wants a low-income earner like me' is cringe-worthy enough, even worse is his teenage-like whining about his father 'forcing' him to be a furniture deliverer in the family business. The guy's pushing 40 for crying out loud! He confronts his father for a 'I don't want to be a truck driver to deliver furniture, I want to MAKE furniture'. Dare I be cynical and suggest they could have chosen something a bit more removed from the earlier career and gone with 'Accountant' or, I dunno 'Astronaut'. His father reacts with a rather calm 'Okay', as if what's the big deal about, though you were expecting Jack to burst into tears and his dad runs over and hugs him, ""Oh sorry, I didn't realise I was hurting you all those years by forcing you to be a truck driver"".The most disappointing bit is when Peter wakes from his coma. He falls madly for Lucy as the original plot would have dictated. But no feel-good-happy-ending here folks. Although various women turn up claiming to be his lovers, and despite everyone saying he's a sleazebag, he actually seems like a nice person who is genuinely interested in Lucy, he kind of sees her as a 'good girl' and wants to settle down with her. He reckons 'she's really something'. Someone should have told that to the people who made this film.
