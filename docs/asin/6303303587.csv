Unfortunately, producers are too cheap to hire good writers worthy of his intense performances. We especially don't appreciate seeing Sam cast in the role of unpricipled evil, charicatured evil murderous law man. Those who like lots of wild western gun play will not be disappointed. Yes, in the early days of cattle barons, railroad tycoons, and hordes of cowboys let loose on towns for drunken R&R;, there were some real bad characters. The real character, Wyatt Earp, and others did play a significant role in riding out on the trackless prairie and bring amoral dirt bags to justice. Lots of press, and tales of the the West were sold based upon these and other highly exaggerated sagas. Until today, we have magnified these crimes into what seems to be wall to wall trigger happy satanic werewolves dotting the horizon as far as we can see. We know we are in for a lot of gunfire in the openings scenes. focus, fade, focus, fade, on a variety of men loading and cocking their rifles and pistols. Not two minutes later gunfire erupts that would make a Civil War battle field carnage look like a game of badmitton by comparison. And oh it goes on and on, and on. If that weren't bad enough, each bullet ripping through flesh is shot in slow motion, so we can 'feel their pain'.All underscored by an implausible script. C'mon, people.

368261,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6303303587,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","""The Desperate Trail"" is an R-rated straight-to-video Western from 1995 starring Sam Elliott as Marshal Bill Speakes; he wants to bring to the gallows his daughter-in-law, Sarah (Linda Fiorentino), who murdered his son but is blinded to her defense of spousal abuse. In her run from the law Sarah hooks up with a charming conman, Jack Cooper (Craig Sheffer).[Mild SPOILERS follow, although I don't give away the ending]POSITIVES:- I liked the ominous ""church bells"" soundtrack. It's simple and unique but I didn't find it jarringly incongruous to the Western genre as some apparently did.- The first act was the best, but the rest of the film was still pretty good. It's a solid Western with a lot of drive and Peckinpah-like gunfights.- What I liked most was the thought-provoking elements of the story. One theme is the evil of spousal abuse. Not just in reference to what drove Sarah to this ""desperate trail,"" but the guy she pistol-whips for giving his wife a black eye (the wife ultimately leaves him and even Marshal Speakes admits the man deserved it).- Another theme is the corrupting power of the ""Eli Syndrome."" Eli was a legitimate chief priest in the Old Testament who spoiled his sons and allowed them to run amok, carnally speaking, in their temple service, which ultimately brought God's judgment and their deaths (1 Samuel 2 & 4). Just so, Bill Speakes was obviously a solid citizen, successful cattle rancher and marshal who spoiled his son. His kin-bias wouldn't allow him to see the other side of the story; it blinded him. Although he WAS a good man and in some ways even a great man this bias was his weakness and successfully corrupted him.- Another theme is desperation. The film's called ""The DESPERATE Trail"" for a reason. Sarah was on her way to the gallows and would need the stagecoach money to make a successful escape to freedom. Women had few options outside of marriage or prostitution out West back then; how much more so if you're a wanted fugitive? She was desperate, pure and simple. The guy she pistol-whips deserved it. Sarah didn't try to steal money from the members of the stage so she wasn't a ""stage robber"" in the conventional sense nor did she rob stages throughout the rest of the film, i.e. for a living; it was a one-time thing. Although she does rob a store for needed supplies, but --again -- she was desperate.As far as her being the heroine and Jack Cooper the hero, in the sense of Bonnie & Clyde, one of the points of the film is that there is no hero. Everyone's corrupt in one way or another, defiled by ""the sins of the father,"" the father being Marshal Speakes. The exception is Jack, who's simply corrupted by his conman nature and desire to provide for his crippled brother, which is another example of kin-bias. Yet he clearly displays traits of love & loyalty, which Sarah is able to easily pick up on after her experiences with an abusive husband. So, although there are strong amoral aspects to the story, one gets the vibe that a certain person or people may move on to a positve and respectable future, once justice is served and they perhaps find the grace of another shot at life, which is a big IF.NEGATIVES:- Sam Elliott, the quintessential Westerner, is his usual laconic self, but he's not the main character, plus his role is atypical since he's not the customary easy-going, likable hero; here he's quiet and respectable until one sees his blind hatred and unwillingness to see anything less than nobility in his son, who he obviously spoiled. This isn't a negative to me; I'm only citing it for those who prefer to see Elliot as the noble star in Westerns.- As the film progresses it becomes clearer that this is a straight-to-video Western. For instance, the film was shot in New Mexico with very fitting locations for a Western, but they seem minimalistic and bleak. Of course, this may have been the point since they're on ""the desperate trail."" Another example would be a couple cases of questionable dialogue/acting and the simple soundtrack. Again, I don't personally find this objectionable since I appreciate low-budget movies.The runtime is 92 minutes.FINAL WORD: ""The Desperate Trail"" is a solid Western with a lot of drive and action, plus it has thought-provking themes that are fairly covert and left to the viewer to mine. Although the main characters appear amoral or immoral on the surface the story reveals why they're corrupt and desperate, besides themes of love & justice come into play. However, those who only prefer Elliott in the typical role of the easygoing Western hero should stay away.GRADE: B",4,"The ""Eli Syndrome"" corrupts",1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,4598,"['Desperate', 'Trail', 'R-rated', 'straight-to-video', 'Western', '1995', 'starring', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Marshal', 'Bill', 'Speakes', 'bring', 'gallows', 'daughter-in-law', 'Sarah', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'who', 'murdered', 'son', 'blinded', 'defense', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'run', 'law', 'Sarah', 'up', 'charming', 'conman', 'Jack', 'Cooper', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', '[', 'Mild', 'SPOILERS', 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', ']', 'POSITIVES', 'liked', 'ominous', 'church', 'bells', 'soundtrack', 'simple', 'unique', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'jarringly', 'incongruous', 'Western', 'genre', 'apparently', 'did.-', 'first', 'act', 'was', 'best', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'solid', 'Western', 'lot', 'drive', 'Peckinpah-like', 'gunfights.-', 'What', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'thought-provoking', 'elements', 'story', 'One', 'theme', 'evil', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'Not', 'just', 'reference', 'what', 'drove', 'Sarah', 'desperate', 'trail', 'guy', 'giving', 'wife', 'black', 'eye', 'wife', 'ultimately', 'even', 'Marshal', 'Speakes', 'man', 'deserved', 'theme', 'corrupting', 'power', 'Eli', 'Syndrome', 'Eli', 'was', 'legitimate', 'chief', 'priest', 'Old', 'Testament', 'who', 'spoiled', 'sons', 'allowed', 'run', 'amok', 'carnally', 'speaking', 'temple', 'service', 'ultimately', 'brought', 'God', 'judgment', 'deaths', '1', 'Samuel', '2', '4', 'Just', 'so', 'Bill', 'Speakes', 'was', 'obviously', 'solid', 'citizen', 'successful', 'cattle', 'rancher', 'marshal', 'who', 'spoiled', 'son', 'kin-bias', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'see', 'other', 'side', 'story', 'blinded', 'WAS', 'good', 'man', 'ways', 'even', 'great', 'man', 'bias', 'was', 'weakness', 'successfully', 'corrupted', 'him.-', 'theme', 'desperation', 'film', 'called', 'DESPERATE', 'Trail', 'reason', 'Sarah', 'was', 'way', 'gallows', 'would', 'need', 'stagecoach', 'money', 'make', 'successful', 'escape', 'freedom', 'Women', 'had', 'few', 'options', 'marriage', 'prostitution', 'out', 'West', 'back', 'then', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'so', ""'re"", 'wanted', 'fugitive', 'was', 'desperate', 'pure', 'simple', 'guy', 'deserved', 'Sarah', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'steal', 'money', 'members', 'stage', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'stage', 'robber', 'conventional', 'sense', 'did', 'rob', 'stages', 'rest', 'film', 'i.e', 'living', 'was', 'one-time', 'thing', 'rob', 'store', 'needed', 'supplies', 'again', 'was', 'desperate.As', 'far', 'being', 'heroine', 'Jack', 'Cooper', 'hero', 'sense', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'one', 'points', 'film', 'hero', 'Everyone', 'corrupt', 'one', 'way', 'defiled', 'sins', 'father', 'father', 'being', 'Marshal', 'Speakes', 'exception', 'Jack', 'who', 'simply', 'corrupted', 'conman', 'nature', 'desire', 'provide', 'crippled', 'brother', 'example', 'kin-bias', 'clearly', 'traits', 'love', 'loyalty', 'Sarah', 'able', 'easily', 'pick', 'up', 'experiences', 'abusive', 'husband', 'So', 'are', 'strong', 'amoral', 'aspects', 'story', 'one', 'vibe', 'certain', 'person', 'people', 'may', 'move', 'positve', 'respectable', 'future', 'once', 'justice', 'served', 'perhaps', 'find', 'grace', 'shot', 'life', 'big', 'IF.NEGATIVES', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'quintessential', 'Westerner', 'usual', 'laconic', 'self', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'role', 'atypical', 'not', 'customary', 'easy-going', 'likable', 'hero', 'here', 'quiet', 'respectable', 'one', 'blind', 'hatred', 'unwillingness', 'see', 'anything', 'less', 'nobility', 'son', 'who', 'obviously', 'spoiled', ""n't"", 'negative', ""'m"", 'only', 'citing', 'who', 'prefer', 'see', 'Elliot', 'noble', 'star', 'Westerns.-', 'film', 'clearer', 'straight-to-video', 'Western', 'instance', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'New', 'Mexico', 'very', 'fitting', 'locations', 'Western', 'seem', 'minimalistic', 'bleak', 'course', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'point', ""'re"", 'desperate', 'trail', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'couple', 'cases', 'questionable', 'dialogue/acting', 'simple', 'soundtrack', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'personally', 'find', 'objectionable', 'appreciate', 'low-budget', 'movies.The', 'runtime', '92', 'minutes.FINAL', 'WORD', 'Desperate', 'Trail', 'solid', 'Western', 'lot', 'drive', 'action', 'thought-provking', 'themes', 'are', 'fairly', 'covert', 'left', 'viewer', 'mine', 'main', 'characters', 'appear', 'amoral', 'immoral', 'surface', 'story', 'reveals', 'why', ""'re"", 'corrupt', 'desperate', 'themes', 'love', 'justice', 'come', 'play', 'However', 'who', 'only', 'prefer', 'Elliott', 'typical', 'role', 'easygoing', 'Western', 'hero', 'should', 'stay', 'away.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
