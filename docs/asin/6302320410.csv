I simply wanted to add that as of late 2013, I am among the many who consider this 1991 film still worth viewing, more than 2 decades after its release.It's also a nice change of pace to see Goldie Hawn in a serious role, in this gradually 'unwinding', plot twist -laden thriller (the story starts out slowly, as they establish the 'base' from which an increasingly more rapid 'ride' takes place, as Goldie Hawn's character begins to 'unravel' a web of lies, while a 'creepy' factor emerges, and danger looms).",5,"Still worth seeing, more than 20 years after its release",1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1022,"['been', 'just', '10', 'years', 'top', 'review', '2003', 'mention', 'film', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'film', 'release', '12', 'years', 'time', 'review', 'now', '22', 'years', 'later', 'concur', 'also', 'agree', 'was', 'skillfully', 'delivered', 'performance', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'even', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'years', 'ago', 'worth', 'revisiting.Aspects', 'plot', 'have', 'been', 'conveyed', 'other', 'reviews', 'simply', 'wanted', 'add', 'late', '2013', 'am', 'many', 'who', 'consider', '1991', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'viewing', 'more', '2', 'decades', 'release.It', 'also', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'see', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'serious', 'role', 'gradually', ""'unwinding"", 'plot', 'twist', '-laden', 'thriller', 'story', 'out', 'slowly', 'establish', ""'base"", 'increasingly', 'more', 'rapid', ""'ride"", 'place', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'character', ""'unravel"", 'web', 'lies', ""'creepy"", 'factor', 'emerges', 'danger', 'looms']",Deceived VHS

At the time I was far from a Goldie Hawn fan (I didn't find her interesting, attractive or talented, but I was also sixteen so what did I know).  I had no desire to watch it but I did, for her.  I didn't really like it, but one cannot deny that parts of this film really `work'.  Even at that young age, walking in with a begrudging intolerance, I had to admit that the film has certain strengths.Basically, the film is predictable and improbable and overly long.  But it is saved by some top notch direction and solid performances.  I really commend Damian Harris for grasping how to mold this thriller in the same vein as classic Hitchcock.  The way that the scenes are framed and captured help create a true sense of dread and tension that permeates the film, even when situations seem completely farfetched.  Hawn is also extremely good in the lead role.  As unsuspecting wife, Adrienne, she conveys so much with her eyes and body language, capturing the frightening understanding of just who she is married to.The sad thing about `Deceived' is that it is marred by the unoriginality of its plot.  Now sure, it came out in the 90's and that marring may have more to do with the increasingly banal unoriginal recent films, but the fact still remains that we have seen this film a dozen or couple dozen or five-hundred times before and so seeing this one doesn't really do much for the average movie goer.  Still, it maintains the thrills well and even holds up, to a degree, today (I just watched this recently) so one can certainly justify giving it a watch.",3,A tightly directed yet not so tightly woven thriller...,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,1650,"['remember', 'when', 'wife', 'were', 'dating', 'brought', 'movie', 'house', 'watch', 'time', 'was', 'far', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'interesting', 'attractive', 'talented', 'was', 'also', 'sixteen', 'so', 'what', 'did', 'know', 'had', 'desire', 'watch', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'parts', 'film', 'really', 'work', 'Even', 'young', 'age', 'walking', 'begrudging', 'intolerance', 'had', 'admit', 'film', 'certain', 'strengths.Basically', 'film', 'predictable', 'improbable', 'overly', 'long', 'saved', 'top', 'notch', 'direction', 'solid', 'performances', 'really', 'commend', 'Damian', 'Harris', 'grasping', 'how', 'mold', 'thriller', 'same', 'vein', 'classic', 'Hitchcock', 'way', 'scenes', 'are', 'framed', 'captured', 'help', 'create', 'true', 'sense', 'dread', 'tension', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'situations', 'seem', 'completely', 'farfetched', 'Hawn', 'also', 'extremely', 'good', 'lead', 'role', 'unsuspecting', 'wife', 'Adrienne', 'conveys', 'so', 'much', 'eyes', 'body', 'language', 'capturing', 'frightening', 'understanding', 'just', 'who', 'married', 'to.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'Deceived', 'marred', 'unoriginality', 'plot', 'Now', 'sure', 'came', 'out', '90', 'marring', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'increasingly', 'banal', 'unoriginal', 'recent', 'films', 'fact', 'still', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'dozen', 'couple', 'dozen', 'five-hundred', 'times', 'so', 'seeing', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'average', 'movie', 'goer', 'Still', 'thrills', 'well', 'even', 'up', 'degree', 'today', 'just', 'watched', 'recently', 'one', 'can', 'certainly', 'justify', 'giving', 'watch']",Deceived VHS

Doing less than 30 million in box office, this was not a big hit; but it is a film that holds up remarkably well 12 years after release.  Goldie Hawn does an excellent job as Adrienne Saunders, a woman who seems to have it all with a beautiful child and happy marriage.  Her husband Jack seems like the All-American father.  Then when a colleague of her husband's gets murdered, clue upon clue seems to fly up in her face until Adrienne has to confront her husband.  Then he mysteriously dies in a car accident.  Director Damian Harris who seems to thrive on thrillers such as last year's &quot;Mercy,&quot; does an amazing job of having event build upon event.  The supporting cast of characters do a great job from Jack Saunders' sister to Paul Sullivan's mother.  While this may not be a perfect film, it is a thriller that packs a wallop.  Goldie Hawn delivers an understated and believable performance as the terrorized and deceived wife.  This is a film worth discovering or revisiting a little over a decade after its release.

If you enjoy thrillers, this one should be in your collection because it doesn't get much better. The performances are top-notch, the writing was up to par and the suspense and mystery builds through the entire film. The musical score and the settings used were all very effective. You can watch the Siskel & Ebert review of this online. They give credit to Goldie for doing something different other than comedies. But Ebert says there was too much chasing around at the end so some may view it as being in the sub-genre of horror. I loved the ending as it was very entertaining and exciting. Had they gone more subtle, Ebert probably would have then called it anti-climatic. They also poke fun at some of the writing recalling a scene where Goldie tells someone to ""Watch out!"" Good for her. I loved that scene. One noticeable cliche' here I will mention is the cat jumping out unexpectedly, and I won't say when.

Inspired by the type of films normally associated with Alfred Hitchcock, this film is a terrific vechicle for Goldie's dramatic talents and really shows her great diversity as an actress which is often quite underestimated.Not a huge success upon its release &quot;Deceived&quot; nevertheless is a taut and attention grabbing little thriller that succeeds throughout its entire length in keeping you on the edge of your seat and really keeps you guessing right up to its terrifying conclusion. Indeed the film's finale is so full on, exciting and indeed scary, that it can be a quite exhausting experience watching it. However for lovers of a good thriller this well made film is I think an undiscovered gem that will really hold your attention and will stay in your mind.Goldie Hawn plays Adrienne Saunders a highly succesful career woman  who has a great job, beautiful apartment, and a lovely daughter and who thinks her life is complete when she meets by chance a handsome and successful stranger Jack Saunders (played by terrific actor John Heard in a chilling performance) when a blind date doesn't show. She falls instantly in love and they marry and their life together appears to be a perfect one until strange revelations and occurences start happening that make Adrienne suspicious and begin to question who she has actually married. Through the course of the story Adrienne finds that her husband is living under an assumed name and that when he is supposedly killed in a car accident it is revealed that he is actually alive and has another family that she knows nothing about. As the true story of her husbands real identity begins to reveal itself Adrienne begins to fear for her life as Jack is also revealed as a murderer of both some hitchhikers to cover his tracks,and one of his collegues in the Egyptian section of the Metropolitan Museum where he has stolen an extremely valuable Ancient Egyptian piece of jewellery, hidden it in Adrienne's apartment and is now intent upon trying to get it back. The scenes of Jack first stalking and then pursuing his wife as she begins to find out the truth of his real identity are quite harrowing with alot of Hitchcockian elements inserted to add to the tension and shock value. Goldie Hawn is excellent in portraying firstly a disbelieving woman who goes through all the trauma of realising that she has been totally deceived about the life she was leading and the man she thought she was married too. John Heard is right on and very scary in the role of Jack who has led a double life for years and is not what he first appears to be. His acting in the exciting finale is excellent and he projects the right elements of menace and madness which is ideal for the role. He works very well with Goldie and the conclusion of the film is a real shocker, containing I believe one of the best finales of any thriller of recent years. I wont reveal here what it is for the benefit of those who haven't seen this film yet but it is truly frightening and well staged.&quot;Deceived&quot; is not one of Goldie Hawn's best known films and being one of her rare excursions into the dramatic thriller genre for which she is not commonly associated , was largely passed over during the time of its theatrical release. It however is a wonderfully surprising film with lots of twists and turns in the plot, interesting characters, and a terrific finale.
