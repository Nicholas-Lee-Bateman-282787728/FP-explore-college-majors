550918,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00004TRD2,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","It is a puzzlement to me that OLIVE THE OTHER REINDEER ran on broadcast once, in 1999, and since then has been Fox's orphan child while lesser Christmas cartoons clog the airwaves.  Based on a kids' book and the author's own Jack Russell Terrier, OLIVE got its title from a pun: Olive the pooch hears that Santa is appealing to ""Olive, the other reindeer"" to make Christmas a success and not the usual ""All of the other reindeer . . . ""  With the help of a wisecracking penguin, Martini, and in spite of a comically disgruntled postal worker, Olive makes her way up North but infiltrating Santa's compound is not easy.Some reviewers have complained that OLIVE may not be suitable for very young children.  Perhaps not.  But the show has considerable merits for older children and adults, not least because of its charmingly awkward ""cutout"" animation style, its songs, the bubbly voicing of the title character by Drew Barrymore, and its not inconsiderable throwaway wit (the bus Olive rides is a ""Mauvehound"").  Without commercials, OLIVE runs a mere 45 minutes but the DVD also includes a making-of short.

550921,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,B00004TRD2,"Bonnie Sayers ""autismfamily""","[3, 6]","Olive is a female brown and white mix, housebroken and owned by Tim. The voice for Olive is Drew Barrymore, also one of the Executive Producers along with Matt Groening (The Simpsons). Olive, The Other Reindeer is adapted from the book of the same name.Anyone familiar with The Simpsons will enjoy the humor in Olive, The Other Reindeer, as well as the animation and witty dialogue that passes quickly in this forty-five minute movie. Either four or five times the characters break into song and dance that flows along with the story line. The neighborhood mailman is the only one who does not want Christmas to happen. He breaks into a solo song that adds its own animation portraying the heartache a Mailman goes through for several weeks each year. This is due to strain on his shoulders from the heavy bags carrying catalogs, cards and gifts.The voice for the Mailman is that of Dan Castellaneta (Homer on The Simpsons), he is a short man with black hair and moustache that dons many disguises along this journey that takes Olive to the North Pole. One of the funniest scenes is in the beginning when Olive helps an animal family snag a Christmas tree. The problem is that the trees are too big for them, but Olive returns with a small green pine tree that is really the air freshener kind you hang on your car mirror. This gag went unnoticed by my son, but adults sure would get a kick out of this scene.Olive is not your typical dog that barks or digs holes, instead she has a pet flea that cannot hear very well and mistakes an announcement over the radio that sets the journey for Olive, The Other Reindeer. While moving the dial around on the pink radio Olive is wrapping the slippers she is giving her owner Tim for Christmas. Tim is upset because Santa just cancelled Christmas because the reindeer Blitzen has broken a leg and Santa cannot fly with only seven reindeer.The first time I viewed Olive, The Other Reindeer it certainly did sound like Santa stated he would have to get Olive, The Other Reindeer, but he was really saying ""All the other reindeer"". While this slip up seemed easy to make, Fido (the pet flea) made a few more blunders when Tim was calling into the pet house to Olive. Fido made it seem that the apology Tim was giving to Olive was the other way around and this angered Olive so much that she decided it was up to her, Olive, The Other Reindeer to make sure Christmas would come.The character of the Mailman is a bit evil and treats the animals badly, so this might be hard to watch for smaller children. In Olive, The Other Reindeer the roles are reversed and instead of the Mailman being scared of the dangerous attack dog, it is the Mailman we need to keep an eye on. It turns out that all the letters Santa has received were really the work of the Mailman, each one telling Santa how much they hated Christmas. While the journey to get to the North Pole is going on we also see news media camped on the hill at the North Pole while Santa and the reindeer discuss what to do.This is certainly a holiday film worth purchasing for the family or grandkids to watch the days and nights leading up to Christmas. The animation was reminiscent of The Simpsons, with the same brand of humor mixed in. Edward Asner is the voice of Santa Clause. The color is vibrant through out the movie with a fast pace of silliness thrown in.",5,Olive saves Christmas,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,3359,"['Olive', 'female', 'brown', 'white', 'mix', 'housebroken', 'owned', 'Tim', 'voice', 'Olive', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'also', 'one', 'Executive', 'Producers', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'Simpsons', 'Olive', 'Other', 'Reindeer', 'adapted', 'book', 'same', 'name.Anyone', 'familiar', 'Simpsons', 'will', 'enjoy', 'humor', 'Olive', 'Other', 'Reindeer', 'as', 'well', 'animation', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'quickly', 'forty-five', 'minute', 'movie', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'characters', 'break', 'song', 'dance', 'story', 'line', 'neighborhood', 'mailman', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'Christmas', 'happen', 'solo', 'song', 'own', 'animation', 'portraying', 'heartache', 'Mailman', 'several', 'weeks', 'year', 'due', 'strain', 'shoulders', 'heavy', 'bags', 'carrying', 'catalogs', 'cards', 'gifts.The', 'voice', 'Mailman', 'Dan', 'Castellaneta', 'Homer', 'Simpsons', 'short', 'man', 'black', 'hair', 'moustache', 'many', 'disguises', 'journey', 'Olive', 'North', 'Pole', 'One', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'when', 'Olive', 'animal', 'family', 'snag', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'problem', 'trees', 'are', 'too', 'big', 'Olive', 'returns', 'small', 'green', 'pine', 'tree', 'really', 'air', 'freshener', 'kind', 'hang', 'car', 'mirror', 'gag', 'went', 'unnoticed', 'son', 'adults', 'sure', 'would', 'get', 'kick', 'scene.Olive', 'not', 'typical', 'dog', 'digs', 'holes', 'instead', 'pet', 'flea', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'very', 'well', 'announcement', 'radio', 'journey', 'Olive', 'Other', 'Reindeer', 'moving', 'dial', 'pink', 'radio', 'Olive', 'wrapping', 'slippers', 'giving', 'owner', 'Tim', 'Christmas', 'Tim', 'upset', 'Santa', 'just', 'cancelled', 'Christmas', 'reindeer', 'Blitzen', 'broken', 'leg', 'Santa', 'can', 'not', 'fly', 'only', 'seven', 'reindeer.The', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'Olive', 'Other', 'Reindeer', 'certainly', 'did', 'sound', 'Santa', 'stated', 'would', 'have', 'get', 'Olive', 'Other', 'Reindeer', 'was', 'really', 'saying', 'other', 'reindeer', 'up', 'seemed', 'easy', 'make', 'Fido', 'pet', 'flea', 'made', 'few', 'more', 'blunders', 'when', 'Tim', 'was', 'calling', 'pet', 'house', 'Olive', 'Fido', 'made', 'seem', 'apology', 'Tim', 'was', 'giving', 'Olive', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'angered', 'Olive', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'was', 'up', 'Olive', 'Other', 'Reindeer', 'make', 'sure', 'Christmas', 'would', 'come.The', 'character', 'Mailman', 'bit', 'evil', 'animals', 'badly', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'smaller', 'children', 'Olive', 'Other', 'Reindeer', 'roles', 'are', 'reversed', 'instead', 'Mailman', 'being', 'scared', 'dangerous', 'attack', 'dog', 'Mailman', 'need', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'letters', 'Santa', 'received', 'were', 'really', 'work', 'Mailman', 'one', 'telling', 'Santa', 'how', 'much', 'hated', 'Christmas', 'journey', 'get', 'North', 'Pole', 'going', 'also', 'see', 'news', 'media', 'camped', 'hill', 'North', 'Pole', 'Santa', 'reindeer', 'discuss', 'what', 'do.This', 'certainly', 'holiday', 'film', 'purchasing', 'family', 'grandkids', 'watch', 'days', 'nights', 'leading', 'up', 'Christmas', 'animation', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Simpsons', 'same', 'brand', 'humor', 'mixed', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'voice', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'color', 'vibrant', 'movie', 'fast', 'pace', 'silliness', 'thrown']","Olive, The Other Reindeer VHS"

550923,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B00004TRD2,christinemm  from The Thinking Mother blog,"[37, 89]","Before I begin you need to know I am writing as a parent of a 3 year-old who tries to limit television viewing to non-violent content for him at this age. If I was a single adult or childless my review would have been very different.This video takes just a glimmer of the books' original content and makes a whole different story out of it. If you enjoyed this children's picture book then don't assume the video is the same story as I did. If anyone is wondering, the book is short picture book appropriate for babies on up. (The content of the book is innocent and happy, with no negativity or violence.)I bought the video not having previewed it first, for my 3 year-old. It didn't seem necessary to preview a movie that was based on a picture book for children aged 4-8 and was a cartoon type movie for children. I was not happy with type of negative and violent content being marketed to young children. Based on my liking the story book, I assumed the story was the same and good, innocent content but I was wrong.The video is peppered with negativity and language inappropriate for a small child. Here are just some of the things that go on that I didn't like:Olive's owner loves her and is telling her that and she can't hear him. The flea is the interpreter and tells the dog that the owner doesn't love her and wants her to go away. Olive is upset and sad. (That amount of sad emotion seems out of place and unnecessary.)Christmas is cancelled due to a reindeer being sick and children are upset.Olive pairs up with a penguin (a character not in the book) who speaks like a mobster and sells fake Rolex watches and stolen stationery on the city streets out of a briefcase. Penguin explains that he stole the stationery when he was fired from his job at the city pound. One reason given for the termination was that he was smuggling in dirty magazines for all to read. (What are small children supposed to know about dirty magazines? As a parent what explanation am I supposed to give when my 3 year-old asks what that is and why it is so bad he'd get fired?)There is a deranged, mean postal delivery man who hates Christmas since he doesn't like the increase in work load during the Christmas season. He kidnaps Olive and wants to hurt her. Olive escapes and rejoins the penguin.Then they go into a North Pole bar full of nasty talking characters (including reindeer) who proceed to try to injure them by throwing them all over the room and threatening to throw them off the roof. Words such as jerk and idiot are used to name-call Olive and the penguin (who is now seen as a nice, good, character).There is talk of how the North Pole area is in bad financial times all because Santa called off Christmas. Olive ends up flying with the reindeer and saves the day and Christmas is on.I have no idea what the producers where thinking and to what age this would be appropriate. This is nothing like the old Christmas shows I remember from my childhood such as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman.

The dolls hit the shelves, the character hits the lunch boxes, shirts, and whatever else they can stick it on and then we get the same thing next year. Of course common imagery and ideas from 'classic' Christmas entertainment is pulled in along the way and that's how it all works.This is different- it has life and honesty. Characters are grumpy, indifferent, multi-dimensional, but the lovable dog pushes through it all with the help of an unlikely Christmas ally- a scoundrel penguin who sells counterfeit watches on the side.There are too many subtle jokes to count- each one a pleasant discovery for adult viewers, but at the same time this is sweet and funny enough to keep kids entertained as well.

With a female or male voice, it seems too human, and that's where this movie goes wrong.  Some people have a good voice for animated characters, Drew Barrymore does not.

We fell in love with Olive's story when we picked up the hardcover children's book some time ago. The 1999 television adaption that originally ran on Fox keeps much of the spirit of the original book. The adaption and extension of the original story is quite good as well.Blitzen has broken a leg and Santa may not be able to deliver all his Christmas toys this year. In a television interview he mentions that without the help of &quot;All the other reindeer&quot; Christmas may literally not get off the ground. Olive, a dog who believes completely in the Christmas spirit (and who can, of course talk and has her own television in her doghouse)becomes convinced (with a little pushing from her pet flea)that Santa actually said &quot;Olive the other reindeer&quot;. Olive believes that her owner doesn't care for her anymore (due to the poor hearing of her pet flea. He confuses what her owner says and leads Olive to believe that she isn't loved or wanted. He needs to get his ears checked, Olive).Convinced that without her help Christmas won't happen, Olive makes a trek to the North Pole. An evil postal worker though tries to stop her along the way--it seems he has problem with Santa going all the way back to his childhood. Olive also gets help from a penguin.The animation is surprisingly true to the original artwork of the book. The computer animation is rendered as such as that the characters don't have the rounded look of most CGI creations giving Olive a unique look all its own. The songs aren't as instantly memorable as Rudolph The Rednose Reindeer (which everybody seems to forget wasn't a Christmas traditional. It was created for the Rankin-Bass Christmas television special) but, perhaps, these clever songs might eventually occupy a special place given time.Drew Barrymore gives an outstanding and sincere performance as Olive as do all the supporting voice cast.

Veteran voice over star Dan Castellaneta does the evil Postman some kinda strange justice and you have the music from REM's Mike Stipe. A caveat, however. This is produced by the Simpson's creator Matt Greoning. Also, when it premiered on Fox some years ago, it was right before a special Christmas episode of Eddie Murphy's The PJs. In other words, expect a bit of edginess and hipness not found in, say, the Rankin/Bass production of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.
