798763,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B0001B50EY,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[4, 4]","""Girl with a suitcase"" is perhaps the first film that we would label as the Italian answer to the emerging French New Wave. Regarding the moral codes at those times, the script describes the agonic desperation of an alluring woman in pursuit of her pretended happiness. Although her efforts are unfruitful, the bother of his lover tries to give her advices and consolation, but the fatality hovers that cloudy atmosphere, leaving her with just an exit door.Valerio Zurlini (1926-1982) was one of the most mature and relevant Italian directors of his generation. He always a very low profile and his real artistic motivations always turned around the edge conditions in the human being, trapped into the well web of lies and no sense hopes signed and remarked by an understandable conviction based on twisted illusions of better and sunny horizons.Claudia Cardinale meant for the Italian Cinema what Anna Karina for the Frenchmen, the beauty and nave girl who always falls in love with the wrong guy, defying all kind of precepts or even good advices. Both of them were perfect for those roles in which the lost innocence and the missing faith prevailed in the social ambiance.You really should not miss this one, as part of an important item into the evolution of the Italian cinema in those ages.",4,"Memorable script, and towering performance of Claudia Cardinale!",1213833600,"06 19, 2008",2008,1297,"['Girl', 'suitcase', 'perhaps', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'label', 'Italian', 'answer', 'emerging', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'Regarding', 'moral', 'codes', 'times', 'script', 'agonic', 'desperation', 'alluring', 'woman', 'pursuit', 'pretended', 'happiness', 'efforts', 'are', 'unfruitful', 'bother', 'lover', 'tries', 'give', 'advices', 'consolation', 'fatality', 'hovers', 'cloudy', 'atmosphere', 'leaving', 'just', 'exit', 'door.Valerio', 'Zurlini', '1926-1982', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'mature', 'relevant', 'Italian', 'directors', 'generation', 'always', 'very', 'low', 'profile', 'real', 'artistic', 'motivations', 'always', 'turned', 'around', 'edge', 'conditions', 'human', 'being', 'trapped', 'well', 'web', 'lies', 'sense', 'signed', 'remarked', 'understandable', 'conviction', 'based', 'twisted', 'illusions', 'better', 'sunny', 'horizons.Claudia', 'Cardinale', 'meant', 'Italian', 'Cinema', 'what', 'Anna', 'Karina', 'Frenchmen', 'beauty', 'nave', 'girl', 'who', 'always', 'love', 'wrong', 'guy', 'defying', 'kind', 'precepts', 'even', 'good', 'advices', 'were', 'perfect', 'roles', 'lost', 'innocence', 'missing', 'faith', 'prevailed', 'social', 'ambiance.You', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'one', 'part', 'important', 'item', 'evolution', 'Italian', 'cinema', 'ages']",N/A

According to Maltin the original Italian version was 135 minutes while this VHS tape was only 96 minutes. Also it was dubbed into English which I always find very distracting. The print quality inself was inferior with the opening sequence particularly bleached out.I have always been a fan of Claudias but can't really rate this tape as it is far from the intent of the original production. I may take another chance on it if it is released on Blu-ray as a restored version some day.

798765,A1TS9YHBML4KRI,B0001B50EY,Michael Ryan,"[0, 0]","What a disappointment in the quality of this release.  Without question I would rate this classic Zurlini directed classic film with 5 Stars, as the movie is that good.  The attractive packaging of the distributor also leads one to believe that this would be a greatDVD to watch, but the contrasty quality of the DVD soon ruins those expectations, with its lack of crisp visual clarity and often washed-out images.  The movie is still a great story to watch and features the beautiful and young Claudia Cardinale in one of her finest early Italian films (in a dubbed version).  This is a fairly hard title to obtain on video and it is extremely disappointing that the releasing company didn't obtain better source material to reproduce their video from.  This DVD looks a lot like an amateur copy made from either a 16mm film print or else some form of video tape original.  The sketchy quality makes one of Zurlini's classic films really hard to fully enjoy.  I understand that there are other reproductions of this elsewhere that made have better quality.",2,Very Sketchy Video Transfer Ruins A Great Claudia Cardinale Classic,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,1057,"['What', 'disappointment', 'quality', 'release', 'question', 'would', 'rate', 'classic', 'Zurlini', 'directed', 'classic', 'film', '5', 'Stars', 'movie', 'good', 'attractive', 'packaging', 'distributor', 'also', 'one', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'greatDVD', 'watch', 'contrasty', 'quality', 'DVD', 'soon', 'expectations', 'lack', 'crisp', 'visual', 'clarity', 'often', 'washed-out', 'images', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'story', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Claudia', 'Cardinale', 'one', 'finest', 'early', 'Italian', 'films', 'dubbed', 'version', 'fairly', 'hard', 'title', 'obtain', 'video', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'releasing', 'company', 'did', ""n't"", 'obtain', 'better', 'source', 'material', 'reproduce', 'video', 'DVD', 'lot', 'amateur', 'copy', 'made', '16mm', 'film', 'print', 'else', 'form', 'video', 'tape', 'original', 'sketchy', 'quality', 'one', 'Zurlini', 'classic', 'films', 'really', 'hard', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'understand', 'are', 'other', 'reproductions', 'elsewhere', 'made', 'have', 'better', 'quality']",N/A
798766,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B0001B50EY,Randy Keehn,"[0, 0]","""Girl with a Suitcase"" is an interesting film that draws us into two very different characters.  One is a world-wise ""singer"" who took some time off from her occupation to follow a young playboy.  The other is the  slightly underage brother of that playboy whose innocence contrasts nicely with the singer.  ""Girl with a Suitcase"" is a very mature and somewhat complex film that can generally fit into the ""coming of age"" film category.  What seperates GWAS from the others in that genre is the maturity of the two individuals.  There isn't a lot of silliness in the film and the path the relationship takes is uneven.  The mature person acts accordingly as does the immature person.  We may not enjoy the developments but that is because we are used to predictible outcomes in these sorts of movies.  This is not a great film but it is a movie worth watching.  I judge from the other reviews that not many liked the transfer on the DVD.  I didn't see anything wrong with what I was watching (that is unless it wasn't supposed to be B&W).",3,Young Love,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,1038,"['Girl', 'Suitcase', 'interesting', 'film', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'One', 'world-wise', 'singer', 'who', 'took', 'time', 'off', 'occupation', 'follow', 'young', 'playboy', 'other', 'slightly', 'underage', 'brother', 'playboy', 'innocence', 'nicely', 'singer', 'Girl', 'Suitcase', 'very', 'mature', 'somewhat', 'complex', 'film', 'can', 'generally', 'fit', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'category', 'What', 'GWAS', 'others', 'genre', 'maturity', 'two', 'individuals', ""n't"", 'lot', 'silliness', 'film', 'path', 'relationship', 'uneven', 'mature', 'person', 'accordingly', 'immature', 'person', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'developments', 'are', 'used', 'predictible', 'outcomes', 'sorts', 'movies', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'judge', 'other', 'reviews', 'not', 'many', 'liked', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'B', 'W']",N/A
798767,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B0001B50EY,Westley,"[19, 22]","""Girl With a Suitcase"" is a relatively obscure Italian film from 1960.  Claudia Cardinale stars as Aida, a small-time club singer with somewhat questionable morals.  She is first seen traveling to Parma with her flashy current boyfriend.  When the boyfriend abandons her at a garage, she tries to track him down in Parma.  Instead, she finds his 16-yead-old brother, Lorenzo (Jaques Perrin).  She starts an unusual relationship with him, and her motives remain unclear, which is the source of the drama.  The film is generally interesting and well-acted - worthy of 4 stars; it even received a nomination for the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival.Unfortunately, as has been noted by a previous reviewer, the DVD transfer is abysmal.  The print quality is particularly bad - early scenes are almost completely bleached out and later scenes are extremely dark, as though everyone is in shadows.  In addition, only a full-screen version is available, which results in several important conversations whereby only one person is visible on-screen.  Finally, the original Italian version with subtitles is not offered - this DVD is dubbed into English.  The sound and dubbing are decent, but the actors all end up sounding rather flat and non-descript.  It's really sad when a worthwhile movie is so poorly transferred.  The DVD also has no extras.",2,Good Movie -- Terrible DVD Transfer,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,1348,"['Girl', 'Suitcase', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'Italian', 'film', '1960', 'Claudia', 'Cardinale', 'Aida', 'small-time', 'club', 'singer', 'somewhat', 'questionable', 'morals', 'first', 'seen', 'traveling', 'Parma', 'flashy', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'When', 'boyfriend', 'garage', 'track', 'down', 'Parma', 'Instead', '16-yead-old', 'brother', 'Lorenzo', 'Jaques', 'Perrin', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'motives', 'remain', 'unclear', 'source', 'drama', 'film', 'generally', 'interesting', 'well-acted', 'worthy', '4', 'stars', 'even', 'received', 'nomination', 'Golden', 'Palm', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival.Unfortunately', 'been', 'noted', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'abysmal', 'print', 'quality', 'particularly', 'bad', 'early', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'bleached', 'out', 'later', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'dark', 'everyone', 'shadows', 'addition', 'only', 'full-screen', 'version', 'available', 'results', 'several', 'important', 'conversations', 'whereby', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'visible', 'on-screen', 'Finally', 'original', 'Italian', 'version', 'subtitles', 'not', 'offered', 'DVD', 'dubbed', 'English', 'sound', 'dubbing', 'are', 'decent', 'actors', 'end', 'up', 'sounding', 'rather', 'flat', 'non-descript', 'really', 'sad', 'when', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'so', 'poorly', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'also', 'extras']",N/A
