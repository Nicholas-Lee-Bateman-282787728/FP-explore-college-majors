970360,A358XP3X4U0X45,B000E8M0SS,bookloversfriend,"[55, 58]","This is an extraordinary movie.  It deals with realistic situations and realistic people without being oppressive.  When people stop associating with other people who are wrong for them and manage to fall in with the sort of people who are right for them, their lives improve dramatically, as happens in this movie.Other reviewers have picked up on how the judge helped this teenage girl, but they didn't see how the girl helped the grown woman also.  By being brazen enough, and smart enough to ask some searching questions, she helped.  Also, the parallel in situations between the girl and the grown woman with regard to their respective fathers made for a rich story.This movie should also be commended for having been brave enough to deal with a bright kid, and for understanding how bright kids are different and how even their emotional problems are different.Quibbles: the transition for the girl was a bit too fast.  It was not unrealistic, but it needed more development.  This of course would have slowed down the pace of the movie, however, and most viewers would have liked it less.  The movie is only 80 minutes long.  It would have been better at the usual TV-movie length of 100 minutes.Also, the father's reaction at the end was not credible to me.  Maybe he did feel guilty, but he was also feeling a lot of other things.  His avoidance reaction was just not credible.In defense of the movie, however, against another commenter: there are ends left open at the movie's end.  One cannot assume the exact nature of those resolutions and condemn the movie for making these resolutions which it in fact leaves open.  Also, it is not at all unrealistic that the judge found the father: after all, she was looking through the records to do just that.Bottom line: Don't miss this movie.  There aren't many this good that deal with human problems and decent human beings.",4,Don't miss it.,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,1881,"['extraordinary', 'movie', 'realistic', 'situations', 'realistic', 'people', 'being', 'oppressive', 'When', 'people', 'stop', 'associating', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'wrong', 'manage', 'fall', 'sort', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'right', 'lives', 'improve', 'dramatically', 'happens', 'movie.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'how', 'judge', 'helped', 'teenage', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'girl', 'helped', 'grown', 'woman', 'also', 'being', 'brazen', 'enough', 'smart', 'enough', 'ask', 'searching', 'questions', 'helped', 'Also', 'parallel', 'situations', 'girl', 'grown', 'woman', 'regard', 'respective', 'fathers', 'made', 'rich', 'story.This', 'movie', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'commended', 'having', 'been', 'brave', 'enough', 'deal', 'bright', 'kid', 'understanding', 'how', 'bright', 'kids', 'are', 'different', 'how', 'even', 'emotional', 'problems', 'are', 'different.Quibbles', 'transition', 'girl', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'fast', 'was', 'not', 'unrealistic', 'needed', 'more', 'development', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'slowed', 'down', 'pace', 'movie', 'however', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'less', 'movie', 'only', '80', 'minutes', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'usual', 'TV-movie', 'length', '100', 'minutes.Also', 'father', 'reaction', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'credible', 'Maybe', 'did', 'feel', 'guilty', 'was', 'also', 'feeling', 'lot', 'other', 'things', 'avoidance', 'reaction', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'credible.In', 'defense', 'movie', 'however', 'commenter', 'are', 'left', 'open', 'movie', 'end', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'assume', 'exact', 'nature', 'resolutions', 'condemn', 'movie', 'making', 'resolutions', 'fact', 'open', 'Also', 'not', 'unrealistic', 'judge', 'found', 'father', 'was', 'looking', 'records', 'do', 'just', 'that.Bottom', 'line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'good', 'deal', 'human', 'problems', 'decent', 'human', 'beings']",Ordinary Miracles
