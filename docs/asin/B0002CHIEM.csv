With that said, GRANDMA'S BOY has our man doing what he does best. He's an everyman who almost anybody can relate to trying, in this case, win the girl and defeat the town bully. Sounds familiar and hackneyed? Not so. Harold Lloyd's genius was his ability to make you empathise with him as a person and not merely as a character to laugh at.Many people in their thrities and forties today remember the syndicated 1970s televison show HOORAY FOR HAROLD LLOYD which introduced us to the true king of silent comedy who should have taken his rightful place among the Little Tramp and the Bus man.To the folks at KINO and AMAZON-BLESS YOU! Now if you'll bring out other Lloyd classics such as SAFETY LAST, WHY WORRY, and THE FRESHMAN (Step right up and call me Speedy!) lovers of TRUE CLASSIC COMEDY will LINE UP to buy this stuff and be ETERNALLY GRATEFUL.

When I rented this from the library to see what all the fuss over Harold was about, I kind of had mixed reactions.  I really liked 'Grandma's Boy,' the very early short feature-length film, and also enjoyed, among the shorts, 'I Do' (which was my personal favorite), 'Just Neighbors,' 'Number, Please?' (except for the disappointing ending), and 'Are Crooks Dishonest?'  Though apparently a number of people really like them, I wasn't that captivated by 'An Eastern Westerner,' 'Bumping into Broadway,' or 'His Royal Slyness.'  Still, it did make me generally interested enough to want to see more, and the next time I had a chance to see more, during the mini-marathon Turner Classic Movies ran of Harold's films during April 2005, I did become a big fan based on seeing some of his great full-length features.  I think the ideal introduction to a new fan would be a feature-length movie, like 'Grandma's Boy' on this disc; it really serves to establish Harold's screen persona of the shy awkward smalltown boy, having to overcome obstacles such as cowardliness, meekness, local bad guys, and people who don't take him seriously.  He was one of those comedians who was more like just a regular guy (with the simple physical modification of glasses) who got into normal understandable situations and trouble and had to use his own wits and summon his own courage and strength of character to get out of them and save the day.  Because most of the shorts on this disc are from so early in Harold's career (some of them even from before the accident that nearly took his own life in September 1919), they might not be appreciated for their humor and brilliance by a new fan who is probably more apt to want to see Harold at the peak of his creativity, not when he was still learning the ropes and developing his character more and more.",4,Possible door in for new fans,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,1976,"['most', 'films', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'solid', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'guaranteed', 'turn', 'first-time', 'viewer', 'huge', 'fan', 'When', 'rented', 'library', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'Harold', 'was', 'kind', 'had', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'really', 'liked', 'Boy', 'very', 'early', 'short', 'feature-length', 'film', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'shorts', 'Do', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite', ""'Just"", 'Neighbors', ""'Number"", 'Please', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'Crooks', 'Dishonest', 'Though', 'apparently', 'number', 'people', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'captivated', ""'An"", 'Eastern', 'Westerner', ""'Bumping"", 'Broadway', 'Royal', 'Slyness', 'Still', 'did', 'make', 'generally', 'interested', 'enough', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'next', 'time', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'more', 'mini-marathon', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'ran', 'Harold', 'films', 'April', '2005', 'did', 'become', 'big', 'fan', 'based', 'seeing', 'great', 'full-length', 'features', 'think', 'ideal', 'introduction', 'new', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'feature-length', 'movie', ""'Grandma"", 'Boy', 'disc', 'really', 'establish', 'Harold', 'screen', 'persona', 'shy', 'awkward', 'smalltown', 'boy', 'having', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'such', 'cowardliness', 'meekness', 'local', 'bad', 'guys', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'was', 'one', 'comedians', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'like', 'just', 'regular', 'guy', 'simple', 'physical', 'modification', 'glasses', 'who', 'got', 'normal', 'understandable', 'situations', 'trouble', 'had', 'use', 'own', 'wits', 'summon', 'own', 'courage', 'strength', 'character', 'get', 'save', 'day', 'most', 'shorts', 'disc', 'are', 'so', 'early', 'Harold', 'career', 'even', 'accident', 'nearly', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'September', '1919', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'appreciated', 'humor', 'brilliance', 'new', 'fan', 'who', 'probably', 'more', 'apt', 'want', 'see', 'Harold', 'peak', 'creativity', 'not', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'learning', 'ropes', 'developing', 'character', 'more', 'more']",The Harold Lloyd Collection: Volume 1

THIS print has many shots missing.  It EVEN has a shot out of place: where the little dog jumps up onto the carousel is placed AFTER the shot of him already ON the carousel!!!  Terrible!!The piano music is usually pretty good and sometimes quite funny, but Neil Brand plays extremely heavy so that after a few minutes I feel exhausted.  Brand is curiously variable.  He is quite good and funny in ""Number Please"", but then he does not make any attempt whatever to fit the action of ""His Royal Slyness""; it's almost as if Kino said, 'Improvise for 20 minutes and we'll buy the recording from you' and then just stuck the music onto the film.  Then BOOM, the next two films are back at Brand's best: heavy but fitting--particularly ""An Eastern Westerner"" is well-synchronized music-to-film.The music to the movie ""I Do"" is a small band--there are no credits that say who this is, but it is AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!  It sounds like some sort of Avante-Garde Euro-Weenie Ha-Ha music and does not in any way fit either the action or even the general character of the movie.I cannot give this DVD more than 1 star.

830233,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B0002CHIEM,Chip Kaufmann,"[35, 35]","I will always have a special place reserved for Harold Lloyd for it was he who first introduced me to silent movies with his 1962 compilation HAROLD LLOYD'S WORLD OF COMEDY. But it has been very difficult to see his films since then as he and later his family have kept them under lock and key. A number of his best known features such as SAFETY LAST (the one where he hangs from the clock hands) were released on VHS by HBO back in 1992 but they have long been unavailable.Harold's granddaughter Suzanne, who now heads the Lloyd Family Trust, was responsible for those releases. She had planned to issue them on DVD in 2002 but for whatever reasons that never happened. This collection from Kino and Lobster Films contains his first feature film GRANDMA'S BOY from 1922 (one of Harold's personal favorites and a blueprint for many of his later films) along with 7 shorts that show off Harold at his best. Some of the earlier shorts feature a young Bebe Daniels as his love interest while the later ones and GRANDMA'S BOY feature his future wife Mildred Davis.Lloyd was a superb athlete and some of the physical stunts he pulls off especially in BUMPING INTO BROADWAY, I DO and AN EASTERN WESTERNER rival anything done by Buster Keaton. What makes some of them even more remarkable is that in 1919 while filming the short HAUNTED SPOOKS (not in this collection but available elsewhere from Kino), he lost the thumb and first finger of his right hand in a freak explosion and wore a glove with special appendages for the rest of his career. If you look carefully during GRANDMA'S BOY and the Mildred Davis shorts you'll be able to see it.This collection is a must for any fan of silent comedy and especially the long suffering fans of Harold Lloyd who, except for the 1992 releases which disappeared all too quickly, have had to put up with second and third rate copies. All of the shorts are restored and most of them look pretty good while GRANDMA'S BOY looks great. As in the other releases in Kino's SLAPSTICK SYMPOSIUM series, the musical accompaniment is by Neil Brand who does his usual fine job...POSTSCRIPT: NOVEMBER 15, 2005 - Harold Lloyd's major feature films have just been released in a 7 DVD set called THE HAROLD LLOYD COLLECTION.

830236,A22BL7L1Y40VPE,B0002CHIEM,Robert Morris,"[12, 12]","Folks with an interest in silent screen comedy will welcome this selection. Until this release, it has been easier to obtain the short films of Keaton and Chaplin than those of the third of the major silent clowns, Harold Lloyd. Short film comedies of these three are facinating because they reveal the development of the character, and also uniquely reveal the essence of the clown in ways that the longer films do not. In my mind, mature short films like Cops (Keaton) and The Adventurer (Chaplin) are often more satifying to watch than their longer efforts.Harold Lloyd's character offers an interesting contrast to Keaton and Chaplin. Chaplin's stories rely heavily on the struggle of the poor tramp against poverty and injustice. Keaton's nemesis is more often fate as revealed in nature or machine. Lloyd's glasses character fights more often against his own limitations, typically shyness (Grandma's Boy), or being thrust into a culture into which he does not fit well (An Eastern Westerner, His Royal Slyness). Lloyd also eschews the pathos of the tramp and the dark world view of Keaton in favor of an eternally optimistic vision of an individual overcoming his limitations.The Lloyd collection samples short comedies of the comedian between 1918 and 1922, and also contains his first feature film, Grandma's Boy. All of the films are interesting to watch, and the resolution of the prints is generally excellent. Grandma's Boy clearly reveals a fully developed formula for the Lloyd character, and is also the probably the funniest of the bunch. Of the other films, the best are Neighbors, a clash that arises out of mutual clumsiness between Lloyd, Bebe Daniels, and Snub Pollard, and An Eastern Westerner, the classic story of a tenderfoot trying to cope in the wild west. In general, this collection reveals the unique genius of Harld Lloyd -- like Keaton, he does not start out trying to mimic Chaplin, the original master, but develops his own gags and story formulae. There are many moments in this collection that reveal Lloyd's genius, and I recommend this collection, especially to students of silent comedies, and of course to Harold Lloyd fans like myself.",4,Important addition to silent comedies on DVD,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,2177,"['Folks', 'interest', 'silent', 'screen', 'comedy', 'will', 'welcome', 'selection', 'release', 'been', 'easier', 'obtain', 'short', 'films', 'Keaton', 'Chaplin', 'third', 'major', 'silent', 'clowns', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'Short', 'film', 'comedies', 'three', 'are', 'facinating', 'reveal', 'development', 'character', 'also', 'uniquely', 'reveal', 'essence', 'clown', 'ways', 'longer', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'mature', 'short', 'films', 'Cops', 'Keaton', 'Adventurer', 'Chaplin', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'satifying', 'watch', 'longer', 'efforts.Harold', 'Lloyd', 'character', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'Keaton', 'Chaplin', 'Chaplin', 'stories', 'rely', 'heavily', 'struggle', 'poor', 'tramp', 'poverty', 'injustice', 'Keaton', 'nemesis', 'more', 'often', 'fate', 'revealed', 'nature', 'machine', 'Lloyd', 'glasses', 'character', 'fights', 'more', 'often', 'own', 'limitations', 'typically', 'shyness', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'being', 'thrust', 'culture', 'not', 'fit', 'well', 'Eastern', 'Westerner', 'Royal', 'Slyness', 'Lloyd', 'also', 'pathos', 'tramp', 'dark', 'world', 'view', 'Keaton', 'favor', 'eternally', 'optimistic', 'vision', 'individual', 'overcoming', 'limitations.The', 'Lloyd', 'collection', 'samples', 'short', 'comedies', 'comedian', '1918', '1922', 'also', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'films', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch', 'resolution', 'prints', 'generally', 'excellent', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'clearly', 'fully', 'developed', 'formula', 'Lloyd', 'character', 'also', 'probably', 'funniest', 'bunch', 'other', 'films', 'best', 'are', 'Neighbors', 'clash', 'mutual', 'clumsiness', 'Lloyd', 'Bebe', 'Daniels', 'Snub', 'Pollard', 'Eastern', 'Westerner', 'classic', 'story', 'tenderfoot', 'trying', 'cope', 'wild', 'west', 'general', 'collection', 'unique', 'genius', 'Harld', 'Lloyd', 'Keaton', 'not', 'start', 'out', 'trying', 'mimic', 'Chaplin', 'original', 'master', 'own', 'gags', 'story', 'formulae', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'collection', 'reveal', 'Lloyd', 'genius', 'recommend', 'collection', 'especially', 'students', 'silent', 'comedies', 'course', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'fans']",The Harold Lloyd Collection: Volume 1
