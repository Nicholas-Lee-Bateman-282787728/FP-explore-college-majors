I especially liked how it was set in the early 1960's which allowed for limited 80's cliches. The  cast was multiracial which made it stand apart from other television series  and the musical numbers were totally awesome! I would recommend to anyone  who likes watching &quot;feel good&quot; movies that leave a warm spot in  your heart!,5,Great  80's television pilot,956880000,"04 28, 2000",2000,459,"['kid', 'growing', 'up', '80', 'best', 'movies', 'television', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'loved', 'watching', 'show', 'especially', 'liked', 'how', 'was', 'set', 'early', '1960', 'allowed', 'limited', '80', 'cliches', 'cast', 'was', 'multiracial', 'made', 'stand', 'apart', 'other', 'television', 'series', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'totally', 'awesome', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'watching', 'quot', 'feel', 'good', 'quot', 'movies', 'leave', 'warm', 'spot', 'heart']",N/A

I had purchased the vhs-movie but over the years have some how misplaced it. I was hoping that it would be in dvd. This was a great family movie. I loved all the singing and the great story line. For those who have never had the pleasure of seeing this movie...you have really missed out. I hope it eventually will show up in dvd. This movie will always be one of my favorites.,5,Loved the movie and the series,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,521,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', '1987', 'watched', 'series', 'week', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'when', 'was', 'cancelled', 'had', 'purchased', 'vhs-movie', 'years', 'have', 'how', 'misplaced', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'dvd', 'was', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'loved', 'singing', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'really', 'missed', 'out', 'hope', 'eventually', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'dvd', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'favorites']",N/A
370481,A2KPZJBVVUNUT4,6303359361,S. Beachy,"[2, 2]","First off, this is by far one of the best series cancelled way too soon.  I just wish that they would put out a DVD of the entire series including the movie.  I just fell in love with this series growing up and when it went off the air, I was devasted!  It's one of the few shows that I still think about and want to see again.  I refuse to buy it on tape though because I wouldn't want to watch it in fear of something happening to it or it wearing out like tapes tend to do. Secondly, I have to add this point, the movie is NOT the series at all.  I have no idea where anyone got that impression.  The series was also missing one of the movie's key characters.  The movie focuses a lot on one character and her need to be independent due to some boy (Nina played by Heather McAdams who later played Cat on Sisters/ Teddie's daughter).  The series, as far as I can remember, doesn't even mention her character.  I could be wrong in my memory of this, but I'm absolutely correct about the issue of the series and the movie not being the same.  Anyway, it's a movie that will stick with you for a long time.",5,Waiting for DVD of movie and series.,1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,1106,"['First', 'off', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'cancelled', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'entire', 'series', 'including', 'movie', 'just', 'fell', 'love', 'series', 'growing', 'up', 'when', 'went', 'air', 'was', 'devasted', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'still', 'think', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'refuse', 'buy', 'tape', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'fear', 'something', 'happening', 'wearing', 'out', 'tapes', 'tend', 'do', 'Secondly', 'have', 'add', 'point', 'movie', 'NOT', 'series', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'anyone', 'got', 'impression', 'series', 'was', 'also', 'missing', 'one', 'movie', 'key', 'characters', 'movie', 'lot', 'one', 'character', 'need', 'be', 'independent', 'due', 'boy', 'Nina', 'played', 'Heather', 'McAdams', 'who', 'later', 'played', 'Cat', 'Sisters/', 'Teddie', 'daughter', 'series', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'remember', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'memory', ""'m"", 'absolutely', 'correct', 'issue', 'series', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'same', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'will', 'stick', 'long', 'time']",N/A
