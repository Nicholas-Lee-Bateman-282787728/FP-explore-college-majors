The first time I saw this movie was ten years ago, and I hated it because at the time I didn't appreciate humor in horror movies. Now I do appreciate it, and Urban Legends: Final Cut was way better on second viewing. It's full of cheese and campy moments, thanks to Loretta Devine and Jessica Cauffiel, who basically plays the same dumb blonde character she played in Valentine and both Legally Blonde films. Also, the killer in this one is great, with a creepy mask. If you thought Urban Legends: Final Cut sucked when you saw it several years ago, you should check it out again. It works more as a campy slasher-comedy than as a serious horror movie.

And, to my great pleasure, It wasn't.Also, based on the reviews I read before deciding to purchase this DVD, I expected ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" (a.k.a. ""Urban Legend 2"") to be an original and entirely independent project (not a rehash/continuation of the ""first"" movie of the same name) ... And, to my great pleasure, It was.It is not really possible to compare the two films and say emphatically that one was superior to the other, since, other than the Title, the [quote] return [unquote] of Loretta Devine's security officer character, and the concept of brutal murders being based on popular urban legends, the two films really have no connection with each other.This is what I was hoping for, because I couldn't be able to stand the idea of a continuation of a story that made little to no sense to me. Not to say that ""UL-1"" was not an enjoyable movie storywise, but I ended up hating it because they overplayed the ""winter coat"" angle of story to such a ridiculous extent that it fell by the wayside as being way too forcably contrived and disingenuous.Fortunately, ""UL-2"" played it more straight and made its stalker dozens of times more believable, though not quite as menacing. And apart from the grizzly ""kidney operation"" sequence near the beginning of the film, I thoroughly enjoyed the refreshing break that this particular ""slasher film"" had to offer by playing it more for chills and suspense rather than for the typical gratuitous blood, guts and gore.The ""movie within a movie"" concept was equally effective, keeping the viewer guessing constantly-- even right down to the very last moments of the movie --about what was taking place and how it all fit together.Admittedly, this film can't come even close to touching any of the ""Scream"" movies, but it is still a compelling and coherent suspense-thriller with a number of (occasionally humorous) twists and turns which make for an enjoyable-- though not extraordinarily scary --edge-of-the-seat ride that's well worth the price of purchase.",4,"""Splice-&-Dice""",1015372800,"03 6, 2002",2002,2161,"['*Based', 'reviews', 'read', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'expected', 'Urban', 'Final', 'Cut', 'be', 'rip-off', 'Scream', 'trilogy', 'great', 'pleasure', ""wasn't.Also"", 'based', 'reviews', 'read', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'expected', 'Urban', 'Final', 'Cut', 'a.k.a', 'Urban', 'Legend', '2', 'be', 'original', 'entirely', 'independent', 'project', 'not', 'rehash/continuation', 'first', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'great', 'pleasure', 'not', 'really', 'possible', 'compare', 'two', 'films', 'say', 'emphatically', 'one', 'was', 'superior', 'other', 'other', 'Title', '[', 'quote', ']', 'return', '[', 'unquote', ']', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'security', 'officer', 'character', 'concept', 'brutal', 'murders', 'being', 'based', 'popular', 'urban', 'legends', 'two', 'films', 'really', 'have', 'connection', 'other.This', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'idea', 'continuation', 'story', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'Not', 'say', 'UL-1', 'was', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'storywise', 'ended', 'up', 'hating', 'overplayed', 'winter', 'coat', 'angle', 'story', 'ridiculous', 'extent', 'fell', 'wayside', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'forcably', 'contrived', 'disingenuous.Fortunately', 'UL-2', 'played', 'more', 'straight', 'made', 'stalker', 'dozens', 'times', 'more', 'believable', 'not', 'quite', 'menacing', 'apart', 'grizzly', 'kidney', 'operation', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'refreshing', 'break', 'particular', 'slasher', 'film', 'had', 'offer', 'playing', 'more', 'chills', 'suspense', 'rather', 'typical', 'gratuitous', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore.The', 'movie', 'movie', 'concept', 'was', 'equally', 'effective', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'guessing', 'constantly', 'even', 'right', 'down', 'very', 'last', 'moments', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'how', 'fit', 'together.Admittedly', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'even', 'close', 'touching', 'Scream', 'movies', 'still', 'compelling', 'coherent', 'suspense-thriller', 'number', 'occasionally', 'humorous', 'twists', 'turns', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'extraordinarily', 'scary', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'ride', 'well', 'price', 'purchase']",N/A

This film isn't scary, nor does it even come close. The gore isn't even half as bad as many people say it is. There was only two scenes where the gore was somewhat high, and still, it wasn't even that bad, becuase it's really fake and only is on screen for about 3 seconds.The first UL was an ok movie, with some good suspense scenes. This UL basically says &quot;WE DON'T NEED NO STINKIN SUSPENSE!!!!&quot; and you're left with laughably stupid death scenes that aren't scary. Is it just me, or did the killer look so stupid, it was unbelieved? Not once in any horror film have I sceen has there been a killer that looked so stupid, then in this one, a shmuck in a fencing mask. Even in the first UL, the killer had a somewhat scary appearance. This one, nope, he isn't scary.Another thing, In a slasher movie, aren't the deaths supposed to be slashings? Well, why don't you tell that to the screenwriters. There's only one slashing in this film, and you can barely see it happening due to shoddy direction. As for the other death scenes, they include a deranged window cil, a camera lens with a vengence , two electrocutions (also hampered by shoddy directing), and a hanging. I didn't care less about what was actually happening in the movie, since it made no sense at all. So, I found myself waiting for death scenes, and since most were drab, that didn't save the movie.Also, this film blatantly rips off the blair witch project. It's hilarious.And the killer's motive is laughable. I laughed my way through the pitiful finale. &quot;Those who can't do, Teach!!!&quot; LOL!!!!!!A rotten screenplay, bad acting, awful directing, need I say more?

That isn't to say that `Urban Legends: The Final Cut' doesn't do its job (it surely has it's moments of terror), but this film is truly a dime-a-dozen these days, and this is far from the top of the pack.  In fact, the original `Urban Legend' film scared the daylights out of me, and while it wasn't quite on par with its obvious influence (`Scream'), it still remains one of my favorite `slasher' films.This is a huge step backwards.The film is heavy on the cheese factor (even the whole premise of a girl trying to receive a coveted Hitchcock award by serving up glorified snuff is rather preposterous) and the acting is serviceable at best, and the whole `he has a twin' aspect of the film borders on laughable, BUT when it hits it hits quite well, and even though we've seen it before (the film is not ashamed of the amount of scenes it borrows from better films) it is still pretty scary.I did like the updated mask.In the end though, there really isn't any reason to see this film.

Jennifer Morrison as the heroine is cute and everything, but she's kinda boring. Former teen heartthrob, Joey Lawrence, is okay as a pompous rich kid. Loretta Devine, returning from the original, is, like in the first, the real standout. The killer's outfit is pushing it a little bit. I think filmmakers are running out of ideas for the killers. The ending isn't as well done as the original either. What are you going to do?.

First, the thing that made the first film unique (having people die according to urban legends) doesn't happen that often in the film.

Second, there are weak plot points that pop up from the unbelievable &quot;twin&quot; of a suicide victim and the fact that no one seems to want to track down people who have vanished.  (For example, the heroine sees someone being murdered on a surveillance camera but looses the video tape evidence after being pursued by the killer.  One would think that the campus security guard after having lived through some murders before would at least try to track down the person supposedly killed or investigate the scene of the alleged crime.  She doesn't do either.  She doesn't even deem it necessary to call the police to investigate the heroine's claim of being chased.)

I took a big chance and bought this DVD without even seeing the film.. And the Gamble paid off well.The film is Great and the DVD is Wonderful. Deleted Scenes, Gag Reel, Director's Commentary, Making Of; we get a lot of good extras.Like the original, ""Urban Legends, Final Cut"" gives us all the Teen Slasher Ingredients, and in Perfect Doses. Some of the Acting may be below average, but the star, Jennifer Morrison gives a Sympathetic, Likeable performance. Anthony Anderson gets the Silver Medal playing (you guessed it) the Comic Relief. The Death Scenes, one in particular, are Inspired. Gore Hounds Rejoice. Being that it's a ""Film within a Film"" scenario, there is a lot of potential for False Scares and clever kills, and the director never misses a chance to use them. The Ending is the one thing that stands Head and Shoulders over the original.

It is good to see it go, but it was fun while it lasted. That's why I believe that &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; should be the &quot;final&quot; slasher film because it goes out on top. It is a sequel but it stands on its own. The scares are scary and the intense sequences are present. It is called Urban Legends, but the killer doesn't knock-off his or their victims with legends. So what's the point of the title? The movie within a movie is called &quot;Urban Legends&quot;. So you see that this sequel isn't a remake of the first and only has a supporting character of the original return. It doesn't rip-off any ideas the first had and it becomes, by the end, better than most of this genre and mainly,its original. Although the whole &quot;movie within a movie&quot; concept was filled to the top of the glass by &quot;Scream 2&quot; and &quot;Scream 3&quot;, this doesn't exactly focus on it. It focuses on the whodunit and the results are pretty snappy. To top that, the score is really good compared to others of its kind. The score to &quot;Scream&quot; is haunting and beautiful,and untouchable. Until now. This score challenges it. Over all, &quot;Final Cut&quot; is not as bad as most expect.

566323,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0000541TL,Craig MACKINNON,"[2, 2]","The first urban legend to appear in Urban Legends: The Final Cut is probably the most famous of them all - the story of the person drugged in a bar and waking up in a bathtub of ice without any kidneys. This is also the most gruesome part of the story - like the original Scream, the most graphic death is the first. The film then falls into a fairly standard story - people wander into dark hallways and die, a walking killer moves the same speed as a frantically running victim, and everyone except the central character is a suspect (until they die, of course). Having said that, the movie is fun in its way, and there are some nice nudges to other movies and a tongue in cheek sense of the absurd which, of course, all horror movies are.The DVD includes a director's commentary from rookie director John Ottman (who is best known as the editor/composer of Usual Suspects and Apt Pupil, among others). The commentary is fun - again, Ottman pokes fun at the genre and his budget, while at the same time praising the actors and pointing out his favourite shots and scenes. The acting is quite reasonable (luckily for us, Joey Lawrence does not sing), and the movie does look quite good (although I may be partisan, since it was filmed on my home campus of Trent University). The DVD also includes some cut scenes, with a commentary included as to how they fit in the movie and why they were cut. This is always my favourite extra whenever it's included on a DVD.I gave this movie 3 stars, which is the same number as I gave to American Beauty. Of course, Urban Legends is not nearly as good a movie, but for its genre, it's very adequate.

At the country's most distinguished (albeit weird) film-making school, the Hitchcock Award for best student movie is the ultimate accomplishment, all but guaranteeing the winner a quick jump to a directing chair in Hollywood.  The protagonist, Amy, decides to break away from her documentary roots and produce a horror movie, one in which a serial killer patterns his murders on urban legends.  When Travis, arguably the school's most gifted student, receives a low grade on his film, he takes his own life.  He is only the first character to die.  As Amy begins filming her own movie, several of her fellow students are murdered, and eventually the killer comes after her.  For the most part, this is standard horror material.  The idea of murdering people in the manner of urban legends is pretty cool, although the pattern seems to degrade from this path toward the end.  The identity of the killer is not overly shocking, but the producers do a pretty good job of keeping the viewer guessing up until the end.  The final scene was a little weird and confusing, but, all in all, the plot held up rather well from beginning to end.In terms of the horror quotient, I would not classify this movie as particularly scary.  There is a masked killer chasing people down and killing them, but there's nothing here to make you jump out of your seat.  The special effects are pretty good, and there is a nice variety to be found in the manner of the murders (which does include one beheading, which is something no horror film should be without).  The movie has its lighter side, as well, obviously not taking itself too seriously.  The projected image of the film-making school is basically a parody of itself, and the antics of the two set design students produce some good laughs.  The movie could be considered rather Scream-like, but it has enough character of its own to succeed in its own right.The special features on the DVD are both good and bad.  The inclusion of seven deleted scenes is nice and provides further insight into the mindset of the characters as well as the story itself.  The gag reel contains some funny bloopers and other moments not included in the final print.  The ""making of featurette"" is rather disappointing, however; it does feature some interviews with a good number of cast members, but it provides little insight into the actual making of the movie.All told, this is a better-than-average slasher film, mixing in good acting, great special effects, and an actual storyline that doesn't reveal its most important secrets until the very end.

566326,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B0000541TL,D. Litton,"[5, 7]","It's not everyday that we get an original horror movie with an intelligent plot, likeable characters, a traffic-stopping cast and chills beyond our imagination. But do you think &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; is one of them? Oh, no. The film, being a sequel to the first film, is the latest in a long, long, long, long line of sequels which do no justice to the predecessor, and not only that, but it copies directly off of &quot;Scream 2&quot; and &quot;3,&quot; just like &quot;Urban Legend&quot; had the look and feel of a &quot;Scream&quot; wannabe. Do the producers of these movies sit around in a room and actually think this stuff is going to appeal to anyone with the least bit of intelligence and common sense? Do they think that our lives are so jaded by originality that they must inject us with banal characters, a washed up storyline, and a mess of total stupidity? Hollywood hates us!The movie is such a piece of undeniable trash that its story is just a pain to even look back on. We are introduced to select students of Alpine University, which is a renowned film school where, every year, one person receives the Hitchcock Award for the best thesis film. This sparks the attention of dithy documentarian Amy Mayfield, who jumps into the project after hearing a story from Reese, the new campus security guard and the sole returning character from the first film.She writes her script, which, wouldn't you know it, is about tall tales known as urban legends, and begins gathering up her cast and crew. She has some competition, though: Toby is filming a horror thriller that takes place on an airplane (shades of &quot;Final Destination,&quot; maybe?), and his cast and crew are much more dilligent. Others include Travis, whose film &quot;The Gods of Men&quot; is in the finishing stages, and Graham, whose the son of a Hollywood mogul.And this is where our killings take place, leaving us with dead bodies, useless plot twists, and a plot that borrows all it can from just about every horror franchise it can get its hands on. The movie even goes so far as to insult its own name, because its killings, with the exception of one, are not even considered urban legends in reality. Perhaps the writers just ran out of creativity, or the legends that were left weren't bloody and stupid enough for the demographic group this film aims itself at.And if there ever was a movie that copycats, this is it. The whole actors-involved-in-a-film-getting-killed-according-to-the-script thing has been done already, much better in &quot;Scream 3,&quot; but &quot;UL:FC&quot; doesn't seem to care. It treats the material as if its new and fresh, which leaves us with a wasted six dollars for a movie that we could've rented already. And the ending is so blatantly reminiscent of the on-stage showdown in &quot;Scream 2,&quot; which places our killer and prey on the set of some movie where they have access to all sorts of materials where they can prolong the inevitable ending in which the real killer will meet his demise. And don't even start criticizing me about giving away the ending: the plot's sky-high predictability factor will not only give away the identity of the killer, but will leave you with no surprises.The actors are your typical ensemble of pseudo-teenage college kids who have nothing better to do than run around and corner themselves into fatal situations than to actually use their heads. Jennifer Morrison plays Amy, who never comes off as being more than the average run-of-the-mill clueless college groupie, as does the rest of the cast composed mostly of unknowns who probably think that this movie will lead them to new heights of fame (what a mislead).

I would like to now express to the makers of this &quot;film&quot; that I require compensation. If you would be so kind, please write me a check for 100 minutes. The acting is horrid, the script is bland and midway through takes a turn for the absurd, and the look of the killer is just plain laughable. Why is the villain wearing a fencing mask of all things? Did the costume designers just give up one day? The story involves students being killed off while working on a thesis film concerning urban legends. Note: It has almost absolutely nothing to do with the previous film. Thus, it is not so much a sequel as a film trying to cash in on an already established (and sub par) horror title. The scares are banal stalker fare (i.e. someone pops out of the shadows) that are pathetically predictable and never haunt the viewer after leaving the film. &quot;Urban Legends&quot; also blatantly rips things off from numerous other films. Apart from being another &quot;Scream&quot;-esque potboiler, one gory death scene (which is the only gory scene) seems to borrow from Italian horror masters like Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento. Another killing borrows from the voyeur-murderer film &quot;Peeping Tom.&quot; And, during one chase, one gets the more than distinct first person camera shakiness of &quot;The Blair Witch Project.&quot; The characters are all one dimensional, even the villain.

When compared to the ""I know"" movies it seems much better but this sequel rocks.Although not completely different from all the other teen (read actors in late 20s/early 30s) slasher flicks out there Urban Legend 2 seems to be fresher than I had expected. I was pleasantly surprised.The whole execution of the plot and the action seems to be a great deal more light-hearted and realistic. The photography and the setting looks very good on the big screen and the lead heroine is easy on the eye. She's way more talented and attractive than other scream queens. Not that I want to typecast her.The identity of the bad guy was a mystery all the way thru for me and the way John Ottman makes us point the finger at a number of different characters was done whole lot better and way more subtler than Wes Craven. And none of the characters were annoying or irritating as they normally are in this sub-genre. Though Anthony Anderson as a camp film student was pushing it a bit too much.The humor was also spot-on. There wasn't much I didn't laugh at that I was supposed to and it didn't spoil the intense atmosphere. The way the film was self-aware and in-jokey without becoming a parody was WAY more convincing and pleasing than any of the Scream movies. And the film students who refer to other movies and movie making was the kind of gimmick Scream 2 and Scream 3 could have benefited from if it were done properly.The presence of Joey Laurence just made a good movie even better.

The budget was good -- and &quot;Trevor&quot; is hot enough to droooool over, but that's about all the movie is good for. Not only does it rip off the ideas responsible for SCREAM, but the camera work is lazy and the attack scenes are cheesy. I mean, SLOW MOTION tacky. What can you expect from a first time director. For those expecting a follow-up to the first part, don't hold your breath. Hollywood hasn't quite learned that sequels don't do well when you write a movie about something DIFFERENT and slap the same name on it.That said, as a DVD I was disappointed. Though there are a LOT of deleted scenes and a boring blooper reel, the menu looks like it was whipped up by a child and.... I was THOROUGHLY ANGERED by the fact that a scene was missing altogether. After seeing UL2 in the theatres, I was ecstatic at a scene in which Reese (the security guard portrayed by Loretta Divine) is acting out a scene from COFFY as it plays on her monitors. I went out and bought all of PAM GRIER'S movies afterwards. And yet... WHERE IS THIS SCENE ON THE DVD??? It's gone. Wiped from existence. All they left was her dancing to the FOXY BROWN theme.If you're a faithful slasher/horror buff like me, you'll buy it. But it doesn't mean you have to like it.P.S. The point of the horror genre is NOT to notice references to other movies. That was SCREAM'S point. Not what should be the point of every movie that followed.",1,BOOO!

566341,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B0000541TL,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[0, 1]","This movie is an excellent follow-up to the original ""Urban Legend"".The story centers around several film production students who attend the prestigious Alpine University film school; called ""the best film school in the world"" by one of the school's professors.  Travis, the school's top student, has just turned in a sub-par thesis film for which he receives a low grade.  Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison) has decided to do her thesis film about a fictional campus serial killer who kills his victims by using urban legends. She brings her idea before her film professor and he seems to think that its an excellent idea. Both Amy and Travis are vying for the all-important Hitchcock film award, which carries a $15,000 prize and a virtual guarantee of a Hollywood film career.Amy begins working on her project, and all seems to be going well initially until, mysteriously, students begin to turn up missing and, eventually, dead.  The students have been killed by using urban legends, just as Amy has in her film.  Additionally, Travis has killed himself in despair over his low grade, but someone stole Travis' original film and took credit for themselves.Meanwhile, Trevor, Travis' twin brother, has come to Alpine to help solve Travis' death.  Trevor doesn't believe that Travis killed himself, so, with Amy's help, the two begin searching for answers.  Meanwhile, more students have been killed by the serial killer.  Will Travis and Amy solve the murders before the killer reaches them?This is a surprisingly good movie.  The plot is excellent and it keeps you guessing right up to the end as to who the killer is.  There are several suspects revealed throughout the film, but the killer's identity isn't revealed until the end.  It was fun for me trying to figure out who the killer was.  Of course, no horror movie would be complete without blood and guts, and this movie has plenty of both.I recommend this movie very highly. No one is safe and everyone is a suspect.

There are so many warnings where people are being killed off by some UL wacko and yet they stayed!!! At least in Jason everyone stayed until there is only one victim left who is smart enough to try to leave and end up killing hockey face until the next sequel.

It is so odd that they make a sequel to a great original, but make the sequel ruin a perfect good 'could've been' trilogy!  I was getting tired with this film because it had nothing to do with the first film.  The murders, also, except for two, never refer to Urban Legends either!  The only neat thing about this movie is that you actually get to see the Kidney Heist, which wasn't performed at the end of the original.  In the first film, you see Brenda, the killer of the original, at the end of the movie telling her friends about how the murders of Pendleton really go- so you think she'll return for the sequel, but she doesn't until the last MINUTE of the movie!  She has no big part or anything!  The acting was okay, but not great.  The story was clumsy and stupid!  This movie should've never been a sequel to the URBAN LEGEND film.  So I just wanna end at saying- ""FINAL CUT IS A BORING RIDE OF NOTHING!  IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL AND NEVER GIVES UP ""TRYING"" TO BE A GOOD SUSPENSE FLICK, WHEN IT REALLY IS JUST CHEAP MOVIEMAKING NONSENSE!""

Fowler ""ben1283""","[1, 1]","Any attempt to follow up one of the worst of the post-Scream bunch of smirkingly ironic teen horror flicks, Urban Legend, was going to be viewed with a bit of scepticism.  Unsurprisingly, when Urban Legend: Final Cut hit the screens it bombed with most everyone that saw it.  And for good reason.  Why it even carries the title 'Urban Legend' is beyond me, as none of the murders here are based on urban legends.  Instead we've got bland lead Amy, a film college student who's in with a shot for the prestigious Hitchcock Award, which virtually guarantees a Hollywood deal.  Of course, this is a highly coveted prize and before you can shout 'red herring', there's a whole shoal of them hiding in the shadows or popping out to tell Amy to watch her back.With a truckload of references to other movies, Ottman's directorial debut (and it shows) pretends to be cleverer than it actually is, mostly by referencing more highbrow sources than others of its kind.  Unfortunately that doesn't mean it doesn't succumb to a death of boredom and deja-vu.  The deaths are unimaginative and a killer in a fencing mask is only marginally better than the parka in the prequel.  The acting is also below par, with the exception of Lorretta Devine as the surviving security guard from the original, who is consistently hilarious.  There really is nothing to recommend this movie at all actually.  It can't even be recommended as being so bad it's good - it's just plain bad.  Thankfully there appears to be returning trend towards genuine horror with the likes of The Others and The Ring, but for now it's just hard to accept that in Scream, one of the most original and influential movies in years, influenced all the wrong directors.

Dungan,"[1, 4]","&quot;I got a good story, it's about a campus serial killer who murders eight students&quot; At Pendelton students battle to make the best student film which will win them the Hitchcock award, who ever wins is basicly garenteed a place in Hollywood. Amy is stuck for a movie idea for her collage thesus, so when she gets a ride from the sucurity guard, she also gets and idea, to make a movie about a serial killer who murders are all based on Urban Legends. This seems like a good idea and it gets approved but as soon as she starts she runs into problems, bad acting, other members are pissed at her for stealing their genre, oh and a masked psycho seems to be killing off her cast and crew. It all seems to start when one student kills himself because of his low grade Amy seems to suspect something is wrong, the dead students twin brother also shows up to look into the sueiside more for he is convensed his brother didn't kill himself. Amy's crew seem to be getting shorter and shorter. Compitition is a killer, now it seems as if someone is killing the computition. Lets get something straight, I love slasher movies and I truely enjoy the new breed, Urban Legends is a fantastic entry into trendy slasher movies. I found myself jumping in my seat alot of times, John Ottman really knows how to scare his audence. The deaths where compleatly edge of your seat stuff, I for one loved them. I really enjoyed the amount of suspence there was in this movie, it was great.  On to the killer, although he/she looked cool I often found myself thinking that he/she looked like a big walking micro phone, I liked the idea of changing the costume around. I found pretty much all the charicters likeable, they all seemed to have their own personality. One thing that was great was the first death, that has to be the greatest death I've seen so far in a 90s horror movie. The rest of the kills arn't really gruesome but somehow this didn't seem like a gore movie, much more to do with suspence.  Over all I truely loved Urban Legends: Final Cut and I advise fans to go see it, it's a must, and if your not a fan of the first, see it anyway, it's like a different series. 10/10",5,Brilliant,978220800,"12 31, 2000",2000,2172,"['quot', 'got', 'good', 'story', 'campus', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'eight', 'students', 'quot', 'Pendelton', 'students', 'battle', 'make', 'best', 'student', 'film', 'will', 'win', 'Hitchcock', 'award', 'who', 'ever', 'basicly', 'garenteed', 'place', 'Hollywood', 'Amy', 'stuck', 'movie', 'idea', 'collage', 'thesus', 'so', 'when', 'ride', 'sucurity', 'guard', 'also', 'idea', 'make', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'murders', 'are', 'based', 'Urban', 'Legends', 'good', 'idea', 'approved', 'as', 'soon', 'problems', 'bad', 'acting', 'other', 'members', 'are', 'pissed', 'stealing', 'genre', 'oh', 'masked', 'psycho', 'be', 'killing', 'off', 'cast', 'crew', 'start', 'when', 'one', 'student', 'low', 'grade', 'Amy', 'suspect', 'something', 'wrong', 'dead', 'students', 'twin', 'brother', 'also', 'up', 'look', 'sueiside', 'more', 'convensed', 'brother', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Amy', 'crew', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'shorter', 'shorter', 'Compitition', 'killer', 'now', 'someone', 'killing', 'computition', 'Lets', 'get', 'something', 'straight', 'love', 'slasher', 'movies', 'truely', 'enjoy', 'new', 'breed', 'Urban', 'Legends', 'fantastic', 'entry', 'trendy', 'slasher', 'movies', 'found', 'jumping', 'seat', 'alot', 'times', 'John', 'Ottman', 'really', 'how', 'scare', 'audence', 'deaths', 'where', 'compleatly', 'edge', 'seat', 'stuff', 'one', 'loved', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'amount', 'suspence', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'killer', 'he/she', 'looked', 'cool', 'often', 'found', 'thinking', 'he/she', 'looked', 'big', 'walking', 'micro', 'phone', 'liked', 'idea', 'changing', 'costume', 'found', 'pretty', 'much', 'charicters', 'likeable', 'seemed', 'have', 'own', 'personality', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'first', 'death', 'be', 'greatest', 'death', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', '90s', 'horror', 'movie', 'rest', 'kills', 'ar', ""n't"", 'really', 'gruesome', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'gore', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'suspence', 'truely', 'loved', 'Urban', 'Legends', 'Final', 'Cut', 'advise', 'fans', 'go', 'see', 'must', 'not', 'fan', 'first', 'see', 'anyway', 'different', 'series', '10/10']",N/A
566355,A363QRXP83K8ZE,B0000541TL,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[0, 0]","Solid slasher, wrong series?This film was panned by many, yet for a genre film I think it's a lot better than the original Urban Legend.A film school class are all competing for the prestigious Hitchcock Award, which is regarded as a golden key to Hollywood for the student who wins it.  However, when the cast and crew of a coveted student film begin dying, and someone switches the film on the credits, it's clear that someone wants the award very, very badly.Admittedly, the final payoff--the identity of the killer and his plan--doesn't make the most sense.  (How would the killer honestly expect to get away with it?)  However, a few elements made it very entertaining.  One is the film within a film setup, and the numerous references to film.  This is not the same thread that ran through the Scream series, though.  The characters here are less aware of the conventions of the slasher film, and the murders are not always the typical &quot; 'Are you there?' [splat!] &quot; setup.The only element, strangely enough, that the original Urban Legend has over The Final Cut is the urban legend piece itself.  There aren't enough famous urban legends left to use in this one since many--the killer in the backseat, the killer calling from inside the house, the killer in the dark room--were used in the original.  The Final Cut does have the 'waking up in a bathtub full of ice cubes to find your kidneys missing' one.  That shows up here in a very bloody, demented, and tense scene early on.  It was stylish and twisted, and a good slasher kill.  Other than that, yes, people die, but not in 'urbgan legend' ways.  Which is fine, because the body count is decent, and the killer sports a much snappier gettup than the original film's 'massive parka-clad slasher'.  One kill in particular owes a lot to Peeping Tom, and it's a nice touch (the voyeur view kill) as the class watches what they think are the dailies from the protagonist's student horror film.  It plays with the whole standard of seeing through the killer's eyes and the 'gaze' and power of sight afforded other characters.There's also at least one electrocution, always welcome, and a man beaten with a camera lens, very self-reflexive.The director is John Ottman, who is actually a composer, and he contributes a very capable score as well.  (Some of his music was also featured in H20.)  The only real link to the first film is through Reese Wilson, the school security guard from the original who finds herself at another college where the same old same old is happening.  Hart Bochner returns to slasherdom (having been in the 1980 Terror Train) as a film prof.The DVD is very good.  We get a featurette, deleted scenes, trailers, and even a gag reel, which is amusing for a horror film and is a good touch (you watch flubbed takes and botched stunts.)The film has a decent gore factor and a decent whodunit.  It's stylish, and more than serviceable in the genre.

It's rare that in this genre that you have a film that is better than its predecessor. In the past only two real benchmarks really approached this threshold, Halloween came close to bettering the original with Halloween 2. Also Nightmare on Elm Street 3 became very memorable as it started the ""Dream Trilogy"" which shot Freddy to the top and is still considered one of the better horror trilogies. There were even some moments in the Friday the 13th series that topped the original. In that series the budget got bigger on each film and that could be the soul reason for the longevity of the series.Don't get me wrong UL2 is predictable and has some awesome scenes coupled with some real dumb ones But it's the cast and the fresh faces that breathe new life into a stuffy genre. I always hated the slasher films where they use guest appearances to further the series. (ie: The Scream Trilogy) I also liked the fact that this film did do its best to stand on its own and not appear as a sequel. Throughout the whole film there were only 2 scenes that connected it to the first. In the Freddy, Jason and Michael Myers series it was always the same guy slicing and dicing. Scream had the same mask and the killer was always related to somebody in the previous film. UL2 breaks new ground there also because it doesn't follow that trend.If you are a slasher genre fan and love the tension, UL2 is a must. Just the kidney bathroom scene is worth the admission for horror lovers. If you need a psychological thriller where you use a lot of brain cells to keep you guessing then UL2 may feel flat.

In my honest opinion, it'a almost as good as its predecessor.This film has so many different bright spots.  the first of which is the cast.  This movie is proof positive that you can make an enjoyable horror film with a young cast WITHOUT featuring eye candy like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar.  The whole cast was great.  Heck, even Joey Lawrence (who I detested on BLOSSOM) was enjoyable in this film.Speaking of the cast, Loretta Devine is the only cast member from the original film who is in this film... and man alive, is she a hoot!  She provides the film with a lot of great comical moments... all without taking away from the horror theme.I recommend this film to those of you who liked the original... as well as lovers of the horror genre.

I would recommend the original more because it is a mix of suspense and horror genre and it's great if you like to scream and be scared! The plot takes place at a college and Jennifer Morrison (Stir of Echoes) stars as Amy Mayfield who yearns for the Hitchcock award so she must make an excellent film to be awarded, but someone will just die for it more than she! Reese (Loretta Devine) from the original stars as a security guard as she did in the first one, where she acts like Coffee, her favorite movie cop! Joseph Lawerence (TV's Brotherly Love) stars  as a wealthy student who seems to be Amy's agent on set and turns out to be a jerk that is always on his cell!

Take, for instance, the scene where the killer is revealed or the hackneyed slasher costume, in this case a fencer's mask and hooded cloak (Why sure!).The cast is highlighted by the attractive Jennifer Morrison and detracted by Eva Mendes' obnoxious lesbian character (Eva is fine but her character, as written, is unattractive and annoying).Almost the entire film takes place on an isolated university campus, shot at Trent University in Peterborough, Canada, NE of Toronto. The exception is a carnival sequence shot at a Toronto amusement park. These restrictive locations give the film a confined, TV-budget air.The climax is cartoonish and overlong.BOTTOM LINE: Not bad, but practically every Friday the 13th sequel is more entertaining (yes, even ""Jason Takes Manhattan"").
