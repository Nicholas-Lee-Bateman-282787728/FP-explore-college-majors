So when I discovered this film in the bin for just $3 (a film with Morgan Freeman's face on the cover!), I couldn't just pass by. It was only at home when I read some reviews...I was prepared for the worst when started to watch this, but everything appeared to be not as horrendous as I anticipated. Of course it's low-budget and a bit amateur and overly didactic, but it has some positive features also. The acting was decent, and I saw quite a potential in directing. I think given a budget like for a normal movie Po Johns could make it work. In general ""Guilty by Association"" left an impression of a truthful film, although I admit it's hard to judge living rather far from DC.But Morgan Freeman was excessive here. I understand his face had to attract attention to the film, but his part was small and not necessary at all. His appearence hit the eye, and the reason he's here for is obvious. Although he might have had his reasons - the movie raises serious questions Freeman might have wanted to contribute.So in my humble opinion the movie is rather curious and although bad, it's not THAT bad. If I were a producer, I'd raise some money for the next Po Johns' flick - he may come up with something very cool like ""New Jack City"" or even ""Training Day"" (at least those were cool movies for me).",3,MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,1442,"['Region', '1', 'DVDs', 'are', 'more', 'expensive', 'Russia', 'US', 'Usual', 'price', '30', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', '10', 'even', 'special', 'offer', 'bins', 'when', 'discovered', 'film', 'bin', 'just', '3', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'face', 'cover', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'pass', 'was', 'only', 'home', 'when', 'read', 'reviews', 'was', 'prepared', 'worst', 'when', 'started', 'watch', 'everything', 'appeared', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'horrendous', 'anticipated', 'course', 'low-budget', 'bit', 'amateur', 'overly', 'didactic', 'positive', 'features', 'also', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'saw', 'quite', 'potential', 'directing', 'think', 'given', 'budget', 'normal', 'movie', 'Po', 'Johns', 'could', 'make', 'work', 'general', 'Guilty', 'Association', 'left', 'impression', 'truthful', 'film', 'admit', 'hard', 'judge', 'living', 'rather', 'far', 'DC.But', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'excessive', 'here', 'understand', 'face', 'had', 'attract', 'attention', 'film', 'part', 'was', 'small', 'not', 'necessary', 'appearence', 'hit', 'eye', 'reason', 'here', 'obvious', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'reasons', 'movie', 'serious', 'questions', 'Freeman', 'might', 'have', 'wanted', 'contribute.So', 'humble', 'opinion', 'movie', 'rather', 'curious', 'bad', 'not', 'THAT', 'bad', 'were', 'producer', ""'d"", 'raise', 'money', 'next', 'Po', 'Johns', 'flick', 'may', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'very', 'cool', 'New', 'Jack', 'City', 'even', 'Training', 'Day', 'least', 'were', 'cool', 'movies']",N/A

SHOCKINGLY, THE CREW OF THIS HOOD MOVIE HAPPENED TO GET MORGAN FREEMAN TO APPEAR IN THIS MOVIE. MORGAN FREEMAN, WHO IS BY FAR THE BEST ACTOR IN THE CAST, ACTUALLY HAS A SMALL ROLE. ALL HE DOES IS NARRATE, AND HE DOESN'T APPEAR UNTIL THE LAST 35 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. THE FILM IS A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT THE REST OF Y'ALL SAY IT IS.

755513,AR8VRE3JD8DWS,B00009NH8J,"Teri Ulrich ""the_shape1978""","[1, 1]","Like many people else who posted a review here, I was fooled by the trailers and ads which all showed Morgan Freeman as one of the main roles, but it turns out he only had a very small amount of cameo appearances near the ending and the very first scene. I first off noticed all the mangled camera shots, cheap sound effects, and pour directing, that was going too far to reach something original. I found all of that disrupting the movie. But as the movie went on, I found out it had somewhat of a heart, and showed the reality of the harsh lives of gangsters living in one of the most crime populated areas in the U.S., Washington D.C., where almost a third of the gangsters popularing the country are living. The characterization was built up pretty good overall, but the pace of the movie was off, making it somewhat dull and boring. It wouldn't pass off as an exciting thriller, because it's not. So, unless you like movies with gang wars and some meaning tied into the end, you could maybe rent this movie once. It's worth a look, but those looking for action-packed crime dramas, or fast-paced crime thrillers, this is a movie you should skip over and just go on with Training Day and Narc. I think that this movie had potential to become something bigger, but failed to trick audiences in the ways we like to be tricked.",2,"Somewhat original, but an overall disappointment....",1061510400,"08 22, 2003",2003,1328,"['many', 'people', 'else', 'who', 'posted', 'review', 'here', 'was', 'fooled', 'trailers', 'ads', 'showed', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'one', 'main', 'roles', 'out', 'only', 'had', 'very', 'small', 'amount', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'ending', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'first', 'noticed', 'mangled', 'camera', 'shots', 'cheap', 'sound', 'effects', 'pour', 'directing', 'was', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'reach', 'something', 'original', 'found', 'disrupting', 'movie', 'movie', 'went', 'found', 'had', 'somewhat', 'heart', 'showed', 'reality', 'harsh', 'lives', 'gangsters', 'living', 'one', 'most', 'crime', 'populated', 'areas', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'where', 'almost', 'third', 'gangsters', 'popularing', 'country', 'are', 'living', 'characterization', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'off', 'making', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'boring', 'would', ""n't"", 'pass', 'off', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'not', 'So', 'movies', 'gang', 'wars', 'meaning', 'tied', 'end', 'could', 'maybe', 'rent', 'movie', 'once', 'look', 'looking', 'action-packed', 'crime', 'dramas', 'fast-paced', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'movie', 'should', 'skip', 'just', 'go', 'Training', 'Day', 'Narc', 'think', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'become', 'something', 'bigger', 'failed', 'trick', 'audiences', 'ways', 'like', 'be', 'tricked']",N/A
