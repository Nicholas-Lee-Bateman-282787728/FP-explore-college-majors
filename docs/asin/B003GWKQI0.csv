1345463,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B003GWKQI0,Douglas M,"[4, 6]","""Paid"" is quite an important film in the legacy of Joan Crawford for this was a part she fought for and represented her first really dramatic outing. Based on a play called ""Within the Law"", the film is an early talkie which means it is static and verbose. Crawford plays a wrongly convicted girl who seeks revenge on the judge who sentenced her to 3 years imprisonment by marrying his son. Credibility does not enter the screenplay but Crawford, as directed by Sam Wood, is surprisingly convincing, generally avoiding the overacting and pretentiousness which blighted many of her performances of this period. Fortunately too, she avoids the plummy tones which she began to adopt as she ""bettered"" herself in her personal life. The supporting cast is colourless with the exception of Winnie Lightner as Crawford's sidekick. The best scenes, severly censored before the film was released, are the vignettes of the women's prison. The last ""Act"" of the film is endless as the District Attorney tries to establish who committed a murder.The film has been issued in the Warner's Archive Collection which means it is very expensive, the print is unrestored and there are no extras. In this case, the print is very worn with a lot of surface noise in the first part of the film and poor contrast throughout. If you are a Crawford fan, you may enjoy seeing your heroine at her magnetic early best but otherwise, don't bother.",2,Early Crawford dramatic talkie,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,1418,"['Paid', 'important', 'film', 'legacy', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'part', 'fought', 'represented', 'first', 'really', 'dramatic', 'outing', 'Based', 'play', 'called', 'Law', 'film', 'early', 'talkie', 'static', 'verbose', 'Crawford', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'girl', 'who', 'revenge', 'judge', 'who', 'sentenced', '3', 'years', 'imprisonment', 'marrying', 'son', 'Credibility', 'not', 'enter', 'screenplay', 'Crawford', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'generally', 'avoiding', 'overacting', 'pretentiousness', 'blighted', 'many', 'performances', 'period', 'Fortunately', 'too', 'plummy', 'tones', 'began', 'adopt', 'bettered', 'herself', 'personal', 'life', 'supporting', 'cast', 'colourless', 'exception', 'Winnie', 'Lightner', 'Crawford', 'sidekick', 'best', 'scenes', 'severly', 'censored', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'are', 'vignettes', 'women', 'prison', 'last', 'Act', 'film', 'endless', 'District', 'Attorney', 'establish', 'who', 'committed', 'murder.The', 'film', 'been', 'issued', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'very', 'expensive', 'print', 'unrestored', 'are', 'extras', 'case', 'print', 'very', 'worn', 'lot', 'surface', 'noise', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'poor', 'contrast', 'are', 'Crawford', 'fan', 'may', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'heroine', 'magnetic', 'early', 'best', 'otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother']",N/A
1345464,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B003GWKQI0,Dr. James Gardner,"[13, 13]","We tend to think of Joan Crawford in the ""Mommie Dearest"" tradition and forget that in the early 30s she was a beautiful young woman who was an excellent actress. Though her role in ""Grand Hotel"" (1932) gets the most attention, this 1930 crime melodrama shows that ""Grand Hotel"" was not a fluke.Crawford got her start in silent films and her marriage to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in 1929 added to her clout. From 1932 through 1936 she was among the top 10 moneymaking stars. In 1945 she won the Oscar for ""Mildred Pierce"" and would be nominated two more times (""Possessed"" in 1947 and ""Sudden Fear"" in 1952).The film co-stars Robert Armstrong, who is best known for his role as hunter Carl Denham in 1933's ""King Kong"". Armstrong performed in 160 films including ""Son of Kong"" (1933), ""Palooka"" (1934), ""G Men"" (1935). ""Man of Conquest"" (1939) and ""Mighty Joe Young"" (1949).Marie Prevost co-stars as Crawford's friend. Prevost had been a major star in the silent era, but her alcoholism and weight problems caused her to lose roles and by 1930 she was only capable of getting secondary roles. In this film she shines and puts in one of her best performances. She died a few years later and Crawford paid for her funeral.Robert Emmett O'Conner plays a detective. O'Conner appeared in more than 200 films and is best remembered as Jimmy Cagney's sponsor Paddy Ryan in ""Public Enemy"" (1931). I remember him best as the detective who hounds the Marx Brothers in ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935). In this film O'Conner is still doing a lot of the silent film schtick which appears a little funny today.There are about 10 minutes of film focusing on prison life for women that are eye opening. Crime was a popular subject in the early 30s and films about prison life (e.g., ""The Big House"", ""Fugitive from a Chain Gang"") were popular. This is real interesting stuff.Sam Wood produced and directs. Wood began his career as an assistant to Cecil B DeMille and started directing films in 1920. He hit his stride in the mid 30s with ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935), ""A Day at the Races"" (1937), and ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" (1939) for which he received his first of 3 Oscar nominations. Among the 80 films he directed, ""Kings Row"" (1942), ""Pride of the Yankees"" (1942), and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" (1943) stand out.This is an excellent film. Crawford and Prevost are great, Robert Armstrong is his usual snappy self, and the direction by Sam Wood is taut. The story is interesting and absorbing and the scenes about prison life in the 20s are truly enlightening.",4,Crawford Shines,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,2540,"['tend', 'think', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'tradition', 'forget', 'early', '30s', 'was', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'excellent', 'actress', 'role', 'Grand', 'Hotel', '1932', 'most', 'attention', '1930', 'crime', 'melodrama', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'was', 'not', 'fluke.Crawford', 'got', 'start', 'silent', 'films', 'marriage', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Jr.', '1929', 'added', 'clout', '1932', '1936', 'was', 'top', '10', 'moneymaking', 'stars', '1945', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'would', 'be', 'nominated', 'two', 'more', 'times', 'Possessed', '1947', 'Sudden', 'Fear', '1952', '.The', 'film', 'co-stars', 'Robert', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'hunter', 'Carl', 'Denham', '1933', 'King', 'Kong', 'Armstrong', 'performed', '160', 'films', 'including', 'Son', 'Kong', '1933', 'Palooka', '1934', 'G', 'Men', '1935', 'Man', 'Conquest', '1939', 'Mighty', 'Joe', 'Young', '1949', 'Prevost', 'co-stars', 'Crawford', 'friend', 'Prevost', 'had', 'been', 'major', 'star', 'silent', 'era', 'alcoholism', 'weight', 'problems', 'caused', 'lose', 'roles', '1930', 'was', 'only', 'capable', 'getting', 'secondary', 'roles', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'died', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Crawford', 'paid', 'funeral.Robert', 'Emmett', ""O'Conner"", 'detective', ""O'Conner"", 'appeared', 'more', '200', 'films', 'best', 'remembered', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'sponsor', 'Paddy', 'Ryan', 'Public', 'Enemy', '1931', 'remember', 'best', 'detective', 'who', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'A', 'Night', 'Opera', '1935', 'film', ""O'Conner"", 'still', 'doing', 'lot', 'silent', 'film', 'schtick', 'little', 'funny', 'are', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'focusing', 'prison', 'life', 'women', 'are', 'eye', 'opening', 'Crime', 'was', 'popular', 'subject', 'early', '30s', 'films', 'prison', 'life', 'e.g.', 'Big', 'House', 'Fugitive', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'were', 'popular', 'real', 'interesting', 'stuff.Sam', 'Wood', 'produced', 'directs', 'Wood', 'began', 'career', 'assistant', 'Cecil', 'B', 'DeMille', 'started', 'directing', 'films', '1920', 'hit', 'stride', 'mid', '30s', 'A', 'Night', 'Opera', '1935', 'Day', 'Races', '1937', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', '1939', 'received', 'first', '3', 'Oscar', 'nominations', '80', 'films', 'directed', 'Kings', 'Row', '1942', 'Pride', 'Yankees', '1942', 'Whom', 'Bell', 'Tolls', '1943', 'stand', 'out.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'Crawford', 'Prevost', 'are', 'great', 'Robert', 'Armstrong', 'usual', 'snappy', 'self', 'direction', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'taut', 'story', 'interesting', 'absorbing', 'scenes', 'prison', 'life', '20s', 'are', 'truly', 'enlightening']",N/A
1345465,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B003GWKQI0,Joker,"[2, 2]","Paid (1930) stars Joan Crawford, Robert Armstrong, and Marie Prevost, and was directed by Sam Wood.  This was really the first serious dramatic role that Crawford received where she could really show her acting abilities.  Crawford received the lead role when Norma Shearer, who was originally given the lead part, backed out due to her pregnancy.  In stepped Crawford, who is  outstanding as Mary Turner, a young woman who's convicted of a crime she didn't commit.  She spends three years in prison as a result.  Hardened by prison life, she makes plans for what she's going to do when she gets out, which is to get revenge on the person who sent her to prison.  Crawford's performance is raw and gritty.  That's all I want to say.  Watch it to see how everything unfolds.  This is a pre-Code film, so there are some things in it that aren't censored that normally would be if it would have been made after the Code was enacted.  I think the Code was the worst thing Hollywood ever did.This is an early talkie, so it has the feel of a stage play much of the time.  Noticeably absent as well is a musical score, though it does have music in the opening and closing credits.  This is how movies were done back in the late 1920s and early 1930s - music at the start, no music in the movie itself, then music at the end.  This is an old movie, having come out in 1930, so there are a lot of ""pops"" and hiss throughout.  Quite often the film is somewhat ""wobbly"" and ""shaky"" as well, with lots of scratches and dust.  I love this.  I love old movies that aren't in pristine condition, instead they're raw and full of imperfections.  I do feel, however, that the movie is in good shape considering how old it is.  The movie is on a DVD-R, but it is professionally labeled and the label side looks like any other standard manufactured DVD.Paid pays off.

1345466,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B003GWKQI0,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Paid is a memorable pre-Code film; the acting by all is excellent! It was great to see Joan Crawford's performance in particular; she really does a great job of portraying her character. The choreography and cinematography are both rather good and the musical score, while not extensive because this is not a musical, enhances the film as well. In addition, the plot moves along well except for a few details that happen quickly near the end of the film--that required me to pay a little more attention but it's all still very well done.When the action starts, Mary Turner (Joan Crawford) is falsely accused of stealing from Gilder's department store where she slaved as a saleswoman working for peanuts. The owner of the store, Edward Gilder (Purnell Pratt) appears in court with his own lawyer to insist that Mary is guilty; he wants Mary to serve time in prison. And she does serve time in prison--three years' time! We see what went on in prison (at least what the filmmakers wanted us to see); Mary is initially horrified and frightened but as she serves her prison sentence she learns about law and ways to legitimately get around the law. Mary also makes friends with Agnes Lynch (Marie Provost) who gets out of prison about the same time Mary does.Mary doesn't even have a room after she's released; but it isn't long before Aggie (Agnes) introduces Mary to Joe Garson (Robert Armstrong) who has a record of breaking the law. Joe wants to make Mary a partner in his life of crime and he wouldn't mind getting to know Mary better, either, perhaps in exchange for letting her stay with him. However, Mary tells Joe and Aggie about her own ideas--ways to just barely get around the law while making tons of money going after rich old men for ""breach of promise."" Mary and Aggie (with Joe mostly off to one side) accuse the rich old men of promising to marry Aggie and then breaking their promise which results in the elderly men having to pay off Aggie to avoid a scandal. Aggie, Mary and Joe split the money and wow, how they get rich! True, Detective Cassidy (Robert Emmett O'Connor) is after them but because Mary knows the law so well Cassidy can never quite pin a crime on them, much to Cassidy's and Inspector Burke's (John Miljan) chagrin.But Mary wants even more. To get revenge on Gilder for falsely accusing her of theft, she woos and marries his son Bob (Douglass Montgomery) before Gilder even knows about it! Gilder might be stuck with Mary as his daughter-in-law but he tries to get Mary accused of another crime so she can go back to prison--hopefully for good!There's more to the plot that this but I'll stop here to avoid giving away spoilers; I want you to enjoy and appreciate this film as much as I did! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything works out.Look also for very good performances by Hale Hamilton as District Attorney Demarest; Tyrell Davis as Eddie Griggs; William Bakewell as Carney and George Cooper as Red. Gwen Lee plays Bertha and Louise Beavers has a small cameo as an African-American convict in the women's prison. Unfortunately, you'll also see a very embarrassingly dated scene in which Bob dismisses a Japanese man who was his hired help.Paid is a great film for fans of the actors in it; and people who appreciate pre-Code films with gritty drama will not be disappointed.",5,"""You're going to pay me for everything I'm losing in life--wait and see--wait and see!""",1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,3346,"['Paid', 'memorable', 'pre-Code', 'film', 'acting', 'excellent', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'performance', 'particular', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'are', 'rather', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'not', 'extensive', 'not', 'musical', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'addition', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'well', 'few', 'details', 'happen', 'quickly', 'end', 'film', 'required', 'pay', 'little', 'more', 'attention', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'done.When', 'action', 'Mary', 'Turner', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'falsely', 'accused', 'stealing', 'Gilder', 'department', 'store', 'where', 'slaved', 'saleswoman', 'working', 'peanuts', 'owner', 'store', 'Edward', 'Gilder', 'Purnell', 'Pratt', 'court', 'own', 'lawyer', 'insist', 'Mary', 'guilty', 'Mary', 'serve', 'time', 'prison', 'serve', 'time', 'prison', 'three', 'years', 'time', 'see', 'what', 'went', 'prison', 'least', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'see', 'Mary', 'initially', 'horrified', 'frightened', 'prison', 'sentence', 'law', 'ways', 'legitimately', 'get', 'law', 'Mary', 'also', 'friends', 'Agnes', 'Lynch', 'Marie', 'Provost', 'who', 'prison', 'same', 'time', 'Mary', 'does.Mary', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'room', 'released', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Aggie', 'Agnes', 'Mary', 'Joe', 'Garson', 'Robert', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'record', 'breaking', 'law', 'Joe', 'make', 'Mary', 'partner', 'life', 'crime', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'getting', 'know', 'Mary', 'better', 'either', 'perhaps', 'exchange', 'letting', 'stay', 'However', 'Mary', 'Joe', 'Aggie', 'own', 'ideas', 'ways', 'just', 'barely', 'get', 'law', 'making', 'tons', 'money', 'going', 'rich', 'old', 'men', 'breach', 'promise', 'Mary', 'Aggie', 'Joe', 'mostly', 'one', 'side', 'rich', 'old', 'men', 'promising', 'marry', 'Aggie', 'then', 'breaking', 'promise', 'results', 'elderly', 'men', 'having', 'pay', 'off', 'Aggie', 'avoid', 'scandal', 'Aggie', 'Mary', 'Joe', 'split', 'money', 'wow', 'how', 'get', 'rich', 'True', 'Detective', 'Cassidy', 'Robert', 'Emmett', ""O'Connor"", 'Mary', 'law', 'so', 'well', 'Cassidy', 'can', 'never', 'quite', 'pin', 'crime', 'much', 'Cassidy', 'Inspector', 'Burke', 'John', 'Miljan', 'chagrin.But', 'Mary', 'even', 'more', 'get', 'revenge', 'Gilder', 'falsely', 'accusing', 'theft', 'woos', 'marries', 'son', 'Bob', 'Douglass', 'Montgomery', 'Gilder', 'even', 'Gilder', 'might', 'be', 'stuck', 'Mary', 'daughter-in-law', 'get', 'Mary', 'accused', 'crime', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'prison', 'hopefully', 'good', 'more', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'here', 'avoid', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'want', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Suffice', 'say', 'rest', 'film', 'how', 'everything', 'out.Look', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Hale', 'Hamilton', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Demarest', 'Tyrell', 'Davis', 'Eddie', 'Griggs', 'William', 'Bakewell', 'Carney', 'George', 'Cooper', 'Red', 'Gwen', 'Lee', 'Bertha', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'small', 'cameo', 'African-American', 'convict', 'women', 'prison', 'Unfortunately', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'very', 'embarrassingly', 'dated', 'scene', 'Bob', 'Japanese', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'hired', 'help.Paid', 'great', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'pre-Code', 'films', 'gritty', 'drama', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

This was one of her first ""talkies"" and Joan determined to show the movie studio execs she was more than a flapper, proved she had the acting chops in her first compelling dramatic performance. She is mesmerizing! Supported by a strong cast like Marie Prevost as endearing wise cracking Agnes Lynch, Robert Armstrong as con artist Joe Garson and Purnell Pratt as the hateful Edward Gilder, her former boss, the film is well written and an entertaining story! Based on ""Within the Law"" by Bayard Veiller which ran successfully on Broadway in 1912 and three silent films later, this film version (and a talkie) is a must see. Although director Sam Wood does a decent job, it is evident that several scenes were shot like a stage play. The look of the film is interesting however, and set lighting captures the mood, especially with shots of Joan in the women's penitentiary. 30's Films of the day were somewhat stylized and the acting often exaggerated and over the top. But Joan Crawford is a natural and gives an unforgettable performance. She is a knockout in every sense of the word!The premise is still a good one and this movie buff would love to see the film remade today in a modern version with excellent direction. But it would be hard to top Joan Crawford's performance. ""Paid"" opens up with a court scene that sentences wrongfully accused Mary Turner to three years in the pen for stealing from the Gilder store where she's worked as a clerk. The department store owner Edward Gilder and his high priced lawyer decisive in sending Mary to jail, represent the unfair establishment.The film made shortly after the famous stock market crash, is a perfect film for the times. The viewer is immediately on board and Mary Turner represents the oppressed innocent trying to get ahead. It is no wonder that the film did so well in the box office. The first time the camera gives you a close up of Joan Crawford, it is a powerful and unforgettable experience. Joan shows her enormous talent in her hurt, indignant, scared and angry expressions as she receives her sentence. Her big eyes and convincing performance reels the audience in and the viewer becomes an ally with her promise to avenge herself. I was glued to the screen wondering how she was going to get her revenge. The twists and turns in the story line were not always predictable. Joan Crawford gives the most enigmatic and interesting character transformation. In the beginning of the film she is a framed innocent person, but when Mary Turner comes out after doing her time, she is jaded by the system though wiser, stronger and with knowledge of the law. She is going to get even and no one is going to stand in her way even when she starts to fall in love. Mary Turner helps her con artist friends but only if they stay ""within the law."" Her associations lead to conflict and a major turning point in the story. I recommend this gem of a film.
