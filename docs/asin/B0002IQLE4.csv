Absolutely hilarious!!!!I'll never understand why goosebumps was supposed to be chilling when it is clearly not!!R.L. Stine is a superb writer though!!!,5,"Hilarious, Campy, Funny, Hammy",1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,512,"['Very', 'good', 'flick', 'goosebumps', 'least', 'frightening', 'might', 'be', 'preschoolers', 'only', '.the', 'mask', 'was', 'cool', 'was', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'campy', 'acting', 'mean', 'mask', 'did', 'look', 'old', 'man', 'how', 'could', 'kid', 'wearing', 'mask', 'old', 'man', 'face', 'scare', 'anyone', 'kid', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'so', 'stupid', 'when', 'filming', 'episode', 'was', 'Absolutely', 'hilarious', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'goosebumps', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'chilling', 'when', 'clearly', 'not', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'superb', 'writer']",N/A

836251,A25VIJX4PMC7F3,B0002IQLE4,Full Moon.,"[0, 2]","Hi, I ordered this DVD.  It arrived in good condition and looked good.  My bad review is not for the movie itself, but for the DVD options.There is an error on the packaging.  It states that the DVD has captions.However, it does not and I could not turn them on at all.  If you look at the screenshot of the back cover on here, you can see that it says, ""Captioned.""  However, even this does not work because there is no menu option for the captions and remote access does not work either.  This DVD was unwatchable as a result and I had to return it.The difference between subtitles and close captions are that subtitles can be turned on via menu access or remote.  Closed captions should be the same, but most DVD companies often forget to put the closed captions on DVDs or do not include them in the menu, so they cannot be turned on.Very disappointing.",1,Error on DVD packaging.,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,857,"['Hi', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'good', 'condition', 'looked', 'good', 'bad', 'review', 'not', 'movie', 'DVD', 'error', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'captions.However', 'not', 'could', 'not', 'turn', 'look', 'screenshot', 'back', 'cover', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'Captioned', 'However', 'even', 'not', 'work', 'menu', 'option', 'captions', 'remote', 'access', 'not', 'work', 'either', 'DVD', 'was', 'unwatchable', 'result', 'had', 'return', 'it.The', 'difference', 'subtitles', 'close', 'captions', 'are', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'menu', 'access', 'remote', 'Closed', 'captions', 'should', 'be', 'same', 'most', 'DVD', 'companies', 'often', 'forget', 'put', 'closed', 'captions', 'DVDs', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'menu', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'turned', 'on.Very', 'disappointing']",N/A

But I don't understand why they released the second story on dvd and not the first Haunted Mask, as well. They're both really creepy and scary, but not in a really frightening way that will scare little kids. I really wish they'd put out the first Haunted Mask to complete the story.
