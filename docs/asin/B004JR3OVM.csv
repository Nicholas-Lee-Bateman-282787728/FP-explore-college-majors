For $3.99 we felt pretty sad that we wasted our money on something this dumb. I have no idea how these greats reviews were posted. Perhaps they were done by youngsters who idealizes the dream of becoming famous. Take my word for it! Search on.

1411619,A22MQ2OAHY8SIJ,B004JR3OVM,"KittyKins ""KittyKins""","[2, 2]","I bought this movie to add to my Cinderella movie collection, but found it has really very little to do with Cinderella other than the odd reference.  You'll see a girl named Elle whose uncle wonders where she is at midnight, but no step-mother or glass slipper. However putting that technicality aside, it is a really sweet movie with wonderful music.  I find that anything with Sterling Knight is outstanding due to his superb acting ability. He presents a tender and gentle quality, and those blue eyes would make anyone melt. Ashley Hewitt also does a good acting and musical performance. This story is more of a rags to riches story and about following your dreams. It's also about honesty and being true to yourself.  Elle is the daughter of musicians who were tragically killed in a plane crash as she was about to do her Berkley audition. She is adopted by her Dad's best friend whom she calls her uncle and who is a music producer. Ty Parker is a big music star whom Elle has been secretly in love with since she was a little girl. When she meets Ty she is dressed like a princess and puts up a masquerade, because she is afraid to reveal to him who she really is.  It's a lovely romantic movie with nothing offensive, and many touching moments.  I particularly like the ""Courage to Love"" montage with Elle and Ty. Fairy tales and happy endings can come true! Although I was a tad disappointed that it isn't ""truly Cinderella"" I'd definitely recommend it.",4,"Good Movie But It ""Ain't"" Cinderella",1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,1464,"['bought', 'movie', 'add', 'Cinderella', 'movie', 'collection', 'found', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'Cinderella', 'other', 'odd', 'reference', ""'ll"", 'see', 'girl', 'named', 'Elle', 'uncle', 'wonders', 'where', 'midnight', 'step-mother', 'glass', 'slipper', 'However', 'putting', 'technicality', 'aside', 'really', 'sweet', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'music', 'find', 'anything', 'Sterling', 'Knight', 'outstanding', 'due', 'superb', 'acting', 'ability', 'tender', 'gentle', 'quality', 'blue', 'eyes', 'would', 'make', 'anyone', 'melt', 'Ashley', 'Hewitt', 'also', 'good', 'acting', 'musical', 'performance', 'story', 'more', 'rags', 'riches', 'story', 'following', 'dreams', 'also', 'about', 'honesty', 'being', 'true', 'Elle', 'daughter', 'musicians', 'who', 'were', 'tragically', 'killed', 'plane', 'crash', 'was', 'about', 'do', 'Berkley', 'audition', 'adopted', 'Dad', 'best', 'friend', 'whom', 'uncle', 'who', 'music', 'producer', 'Ty', 'Parker', 'big', 'music', 'star', 'whom', 'Elle', 'been', 'secretly', 'love', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'When', 'Ty', 'dressed', 'princess', 'up', 'masquerade', 'afraid', 'reveal', 'who', 'really', 'lovely', 'romantic', 'movie', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'particularly', 'Courage', 'Love', 'montage', 'Elle', 'Ty', 'Fairy', 'tales', 'happy', 'endings', 'can', 'come', 'true', 'was', 'tad', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'truly', 'Cinderella', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend']",N/A

Never let anyone tell you you can't do anything you set your mind to!  God gives everyone their own unique, special talent.  Education is the main thing.  I saw a young boy on TV the other day on Joel Osteen.  He wanted a college education more than anything, but his family was so poor that they could not afford it.  He got good grades in school and managed to obtain 3.2 million dollars worth of schlorships.  If you set you mind to something, don't let anyone tell you you can't do it.  Elle finally learned that lesson and all of her dreams came true and had the love of her Prince.  Always let God guide your steps and Fairey Tales will come true, it could happen to you.
