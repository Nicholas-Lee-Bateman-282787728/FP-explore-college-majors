473044,A3DNQVYEDVGH0F,630567681X,C. Burkhalter,"[6, 8]","This film is bizarrely uneven. What seems like a reasonably straight-forward comedy (albeit a pretty subdued one) gradually gives way to a depressing portrait of displacement in the inhuman contemporary work force. However, while changing gears, the film never loses the audience. The more comedic beginning commits us to these characters. We like them, we like them together, and we like them together in the ridiculous and pointless do-nothing jobs they keep. So as they drift apart and as the work conditions become more and more dehumanizing, we empathize totally and feel a disappointment in the deterioration of this little community we'd really come to like. Furthermore, most of us have had friendships drift apart, and more specifically working relationships become estranged. ""Clockwatchers"" preys on this and as a result is one of the more effective downers I've seen.Much of the early half of the film reminds most viewers of a more tame ""Office Space,"" for obvious reasons. But ""Clockwatchers"" distinguished itself well from this movie and others of its type. Actually, I think a far closer companion film would be the early portions of ""Fight Club"" (another film that dramatically shifts gears but keeps the audience in tow). Like ""Fight Club,"" ""Clockwatchers"" relies on cynical and ironic wit and moreso on extremely stylized sets, lighting, and camerawork. Another unusual aspect of this film is the unmistakable lack of anything resembling a romance plot whatsoever. How many girlfriend comedies - commercial or independent - can you think of that don't land boyfriends on the laps of at least one of the characters before the credits roll? ""Clockwatchers"" succeeds by these differences. Its a film like really no other, and it fascinates us and sticks in our memories as a result. I mean, ""Clockwatchers"" isn't saving lives or anything, and Bresson it ain't, but it is a film I keep going back to for its many (refreshingly) atypical handlings of a pretty well-tread concept.",4,One of indie comedy's biggest downers.,1035936000,"10 30, 2002",2002,1993,"['film', 'bizarrely', 'uneven', 'What', 'reasonably', 'straight-forward', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'subdued', 'one', 'gradually', 'way', 'depressing', 'portrait', 'displacement', 'inhuman', 'contemporary', 'work', 'force', 'However', 'changing', 'gears', 'film', 'never', 'audience', 'more', 'comedic', 'beginning', 'commits', 'characters', 'like', 'together', 'like', 'together', 'ridiculous', 'pointless', 'do-nothing', 'jobs', 'keep', 'So', 'drift', 'apart', 'work', 'conditions', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'dehumanizing', 'empathize', 'totally', 'feel', 'disappointment', 'deterioration', 'little', 'community', ""'d"", 'really', 'come', 'like', 'Furthermore', 'most', 'have', 'had', 'friendships', 'drift', 'apart', 'more', 'specifically', 'working', 'relationships', 'become', 'estranged', 'Clockwatchers', 'preys', 'result', 'one', 'more', 'effective', 'downers', ""'ve"", 'seen.Much', 'early', 'half', 'film', 'most', 'viewers', 'more', 'tame', 'Office', 'Space', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Clockwatchers', 'distinguished', 'well', 'movie', 'others', 'type', 'Actually', 'think', 'far', 'closer', 'companion', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'early', 'portions', 'Fight', 'Club', 'film', 'dramatically', 'shifts', 'gears', 'audience', 'tow', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Clockwatchers', 'relies', 'cynical', 'ironic', 'wit', 'moreso', 'extremely', 'stylized', 'sets', 'lighting', 'camerawork', 'unusual', 'aspect', 'film', 'unmistakable', 'lack', 'anything', 'resembling', 'romance', 'plot', 'whatsoever', 'How', 'many', 'girlfriend', 'comedies', 'commercial', 'independent', 'can', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'land', 'boyfriends', 'laps', 'least', 'one', 'characters', 'credits', 'roll', 'Clockwatchers', 'differences', 'film', 'really', 'other', 'sticks', 'memories', 'result', 'mean', 'Clockwatchers', ""n't"", 'saving', 'lives', 'anything', 'Bresson', 'ai', ""n't"", 'film', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'many', 'refreshingly', 'atypical', 'handlings', 'pretty', 'well-tread', 'concept']",Clockwatchers VHS

Ebeling ""ctlpareader""","[9, 11]","The editorial reviewer infers that it might be unlikely that &quot;intelligent, capable women languish&quot; in boring, demeaning office temp work.  Apparently, the editorial reviewer has led an advantaged life some place where the economy has always boomed, where everyone has always known what they wanted and gotten it, where business culture is democratic and kind.  Clockwatchers, for all its interesting European styling, has pinned down two  realities most realistically: life in a business office and what life is like when you are waiting for it to become something, anything. Toni Collette's performance is incredible as is that of the rest of the cast.  Their characters are recognizable but not stereotypes.  The comedy is gentle, the sound and settings are stark, but the sting of being so invisible you don't even rate the bottom of the totem pole is like a bright flare. I gave this only four stars because some might think it drags (but that is part of its point), and others will never appreciate the fact that yes, for many intelligent women, this is a passage of life.

Besides the fact that I like to support smaller, independent films (especially since this one features a lot of women in front of and behind the scenes), CLOCKWATCHERS is simply an entertaining show!  It has a smart tone, and is a close cousin to OFFICE SPACE (featuring that *other* FRIENDS star, Jennifer Aniston).The story is engrossing and concerns a pack of temps.  Toni Collette plays Iris, who starts out as a timid, shy and introverted person.  Her encounters with the other girls changes her (especially with the outspoken and quirky character played by Parker Posey - she's great in this!). Toni Collette is very good here - and although she is an Academy Award nominated actress (THE SIXTH SENSE) it's funny how the director's use of a new shade of lipstick is filmatic shorthand for the character change Iris goes through!  Lisa Kudrow is not quite as ditzy as she usually is on FRIENDS.  It's nice to see her in a different mode.There's not much more story than that.  If you've been a temp or work in an office environment you will appreciate this film.  The film's theme is about sleepwalking through life and making your mark.  Most of the girls cow to the corporate machine.  One of them scratches &quot;I was here&quot; on her desk - just to make her mark.There's an interesting subplot about an office thief that gets tied into the movie's theme nicely.Please rent or buy this film.

G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[7, 8]","When I asked for this for Xmas, my brother was convinced he had mis-heard me and was either asking for &quot;Clockers&quot; or &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;....of course I had to explain that I had caught this movie by accident on cable on a lunch break, been riveted to my couch, and ended up blowing off an hour of work so I could finish it. It was that good. People should not be fooled into thinking, however, that this is some laugh-out-loud comedy. There are laughs, but &quot;Clockwatchers&quot; is by and large a dark film. It covers a year in the life of four temp-secretaries who work at a soulless, drab stuck-in-the-1950s ad firm that looks like every schoolroom you grew up in (outstanding set design, down to the frosted ripple glass windows, washed-out pastel tones and antique pencil sharpeners)and is about as much fun to work at. The girls are all trying to escape to better lives and become friends, but as they grow increasingly desperate and humiliated, their friendship, rather than strengthening, begins to crumble. Toni Collette does a great job as Iris, the chief-young-woman-in-transition, trying to figure out who she is and where she is going in a world where she does not seem to matter, while Parker Posey, who rightfully has a cult following (and not just because she's cute, though as long as we're on the subject -- she is, very) is hilarious as the girl who wants a better life but isn't willing to work to get it. All four believe they are invisible and irrelevant, and they are largely proven right as the movie goes on. Their job is dehumanizing drudgery, and those who could mitigate it, by showing them respect and consideration, do the exact opposite. The woman who oversees the temps is every condescending schoolmarm you ever had in fourth grade. The executives are either shallow or vacuous, and talk without listening and smile without meaning it. Even the perfume girl in the department store, who should be an ally, chooses to hide behind snobbery. All the girls want to hear is &quot;I see you&quot; but people keep trampling them as if they don't exist.

I can relate to everything Iris (Colette) goes through in the film. When someone starts a job, it begins as  fun. Then, something comes along to turn it into just another job. That's  what makes Clockwatchers a spot on interpretation of our lives. The  performances are also great: Colette as the shy one; Kudrow as the man  wanting, actress; Posey as the fiesty, outspoken one; and Ubach as a  pampered, unknowing bride-to-be. I'm usually not a fan of independant  films, but once in a while, one comes along to grab my attention and never  let's go until the very end. This one did that. This movie also makes it's  point without using excessive language, violence, or sex. After the last  indy film I watched (Happiness), I needed a cleansing.

473063,A2G265ELKPQJQZ,630567681X,Renee,"[2, 2]","Parker Posey has seriously grown on me over the years.  What I like about her movies are the emotional extremes they tend to evoke in people.  Either you hate it or you think it's brilliant.  Surprisingly most people lean toward the latter.  'Clockwatchers' is a wonderful example of this dynamic.I see many people comparing this movie to Office Space and I believe they are doing the review readers a disservice.  The only thing similar about the 2 movies is that they both take place in an office and they are both highly relatable to a certain segment of employees.  The similarity ends there.  They have both been considered dark comedies, but I don't see how either of them fit into that category.  There was very little about Office Space that was dark and very little about Clockwatchers that was funny.  With that said, I could relate to Clockwatchers on such a fundamental level that if it comes on cable, I can't resist watching it.  Why?  Because I get something new from it every single time I see it.Most of the people who gave this movie a poor rating, were expecting a comedy.  If you want to laugh and drift off into mindless entertainment, don't watch this.  It was meant to evoke thought regarding work ambitions and behaviors and it succeeds brilliantly at doing that.  If you work in an office setting, you should be able to find yourself somewhere in this movie and you may not like what you see.  It's like entertainment counseling that forces you to look at yourself from the outside where it's much easier to see your flaws clearly.  Offices should make this movie mandatory viewing for all incoming employees from the janitor to the CEO, so that people can start off with an understanding of how their work behaviors affect others.",5,"Not very funny, but relevant",1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,1756,"['Parker', 'Posey', 'seriously', 'grown', 'years', 'What', 'like', 'movies', 'are', 'emotional', 'extremes', 'tend', 'evoke', 'people', 'hate', 'think', 'brilliant', 'Surprisingly', 'most', 'people', 'lean', 'latter', ""'Clockwatchers"", 'wonderful', 'example', 'dynamic.I', 'see', 'many', 'people', 'comparing', 'movie', 'Office', 'Space', 'believe', 'are', 'doing', 'review', 'disservice', 'only', 'thing', 'similar', '2', 'movies', 'take', 'place', 'office', 'are', 'highly', 'relatable', 'certain', 'segment', 'employees', 'similarity', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'dark', 'comedies', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'fit', 'category', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'Office', 'Space', 'was', 'dark', 'very', 'little', 'Clockwatchers', 'was', 'funny', 'said', 'could', 'relate', 'Clockwatchers', 'fundamental', 'level', 'cable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'watching', 'Why', 'get', 'something', 'new', 'single', 'time', 'see', 'it.Most', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'poor', 'rating', 'were', 'expecting', 'comedy', 'want', 'laugh', 'drift', 'off', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'was', 'meant', 'evoke', 'thought', 'regarding', 'work', 'ambitions', 'behaviors', 'brilliantly', 'doing', 'work', 'office', 'setting', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'somewhere', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'like', 'entertainment', 'counseling', 'look', 'outside', 'where', 'much', 'easier', 'see', 'flaws', 'clearly', 'Offices', 'should', 'make', 'movie', 'mandatory', 'viewing', 'incoming', 'employees', 'janitor', 'CEO', 'people', 'can', 'start', 'off', 'understanding', 'how', 'work', 'behaviors', 'affect', 'others']",Clockwatchers VHS

I found after the first 5 minutes of just watching the start out of curiousity I ended up getting completely hooked and watching the entire film -- and I loved it.  I never really cared much for Toni Collete or Lisa Kudrow but I do love Parker Posey.  As soon as I saw her first appear in the film I just knew this wasn't going to be any ordinary comedy.  All the actors in this film deliver flawless performances and the characters are just like most people you encounter in the workplace.  It's deliciously cynical and dark, making fun out of the most ordinary and mundane situations - but it has a very profound and thought-provoking message in the end that makes the film seem sad overall.

It's a film that exposes,  with no mercy, the tedious, soul-draining routine that workers, especially  temps, go through every day, and how they can feel totally trapped, with no  chance at freedom. Sure, it's wickedly funny in it's observations of  soulless companies and their rules and policies, but beneath it lies a  bleak look at how people can totally lose their identity when devoted to  their job, when everything always boils down to pleasing others and  maintaining a decent salary. Like Parker Posey's character says in one  scene, &quot;I feel like I'm floating, with no connection to the outside  world&quot;. The actresses in &quot;Clockwatchers&quot; are great, they all  express their characters perfectly, especially during the second half of  the movie, when all of their friendships crumble. The transformation of  Toni Collette's character is chilling, especially at the end.

473066,AR1T36GLLAFFX,630567681X,Scott FS,"[7, 10]","You might raise my rating by one; if you dislike them, lower it by one star.Several temps work in a non-descript office.  They share the fate of the ignored, unappreciated temporary worker who is neither a member of the staff, nor an outsider.  Call them in-betweeners.Toni Collette stars as the prototypical mousy temp.  Lisa Kudrow and Parker Posey are her co-workers.There really isn't much of a plot, beyond the strange interactions between the female temps and the 'real' employees of the company.  Toni Collette plays Iris Chapman, who is hired after passing a typing test of sorts, using invoices she's not to mess up because they are 'expensive'.  She gets the job in spite of botching more than a few of the expensive forms, which she puts in her purse, then disposes of them in the company restroom.The film is long on atmospherics, long, lazy shots of the impersonal office, complete with the madding muzak music constantly playing in the background.  I was expecting for one of these women to go berserk, but the meltdowns seemed to be mainly internal.I'd recommend this movie for the thoughful moviegoer who can appreciate a slow, deliberate film that seeks to explain and explore the repressed and the timid in the workplace, and how they manage to (generally) maintain their sanity in an indifferent world.",4,If you like dark comedies,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,1321,"['might', 'raise', 'rating', 'one', 'dislike', 'lower', 'one', 'star.Several', 'temps', 'work', 'non-descript', 'office', 'share', 'fate', 'ignored', 'unappreciated', 'temporary', 'worker', 'who', 'member', 'staff', 'outsider', 'Call', 'in-betweeners.Toni', 'Collette', 'stars', 'prototypical', 'mousy', 'temp', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'are', 'co-workers.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'strange', 'interactions', 'female', 'temps', ""'real"", 'employees', 'company', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Iris', 'Chapman', 'who', 'hired', 'passing', 'typing', 'test', 'sorts', 'using', 'invoices', 'not', 'mess', 'up', 'are', ""'expensive"", 'job', 'spite', 'botching', 'more', 'few', 'expensive', 'forms', 'purse', 'then', 'company', 'restroom.The', 'film', 'long', 'atmospherics', 'long', 'lazy', 'shots', 'impersonal', 'office', 'complete', 'madding', 'muzak', 'music', 'constantly', 'playing', 'background', 'was', 'expecting', 'one', 'women', 'go', 'berserk', 'meltdowns', 'seemed', 'be', 'mainly', 'internal.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'thoughful', 'moviegoer', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'film', 'explain', 'explore', 'repressed', 'timid', 'workplace', 'how', 'manage', 'generally', 'maintain', 'sanity', 'indifferent', 'world']",Clockwatchers VHS
473067,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,630567681X,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[6, 6]","Clockwatchers is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. An inspired film full of original ideas, this thought-provoking brilliant satire that makes clever social commentary about how a workplace environment dehumanizes the people who work in it. Underlying the dark humor in the film are some powerful truths about the world of work.Clockwatchers follows the story four temporary workers Iris, a shy woman contemplating her future in the working world, Margaret a brilliant free spirit whose dynamic personality hides her vulnerabilities, Paula, an older woman running out of time to achieve her dreams of becoming an actress, and Jane, a woman biding time with a job until she gets married to her dream man. Global Credit's indifferent employees don't see them as people with dreams and futures; just butts to fill seats so the company looks busy. So the four bide their time doing mindless tasks in this brain-numbing environment complete with tortuous lite muzak, bright florescent lights and drab gray furniture. Because they're temps no one sees them. To get a semblance visibility from someone in the company the four act in passive aggressive manner at work: Paula constantly breaking the copier with paper clips; Margaret's destroying the desk to state she was there, Jane's constant personal calls and Iris writing in a journal. To cope with the isolation on the job, the four temps become friends and even hang out after work.As the women start to grow closer, they change: Iris grows out of her shyness, Margaret starts to actualize her potential as a leader, Paula starts making her move on the copier guy and working towards her acting career, and Jane starts to see an identity outside of her future husband. Just when the women are starting to grow, the soul-crushing environment of Global Credit works to break their friendship and their spirits. Even though the company has temps, it hires Cleo, an assistant for the job Margaret wanted and even suggested to management. Ironically, when the temp clique ignores her she begins stealing office objects in the same passive aggressive way to get attention. Minor stuff like mugs and such. This brings the full-time office staff into an uproar. I just love the BS speech made by the CEO about being a ""family"". Truly hilarious! I love how in that scene the out-of touch executives are shown sitting at a conference table on one side of the room and the employees huddled together tightly next to the door. Just like real life.The company blames the temps for the thefts and starts to treat them in a more dehumanizing way to ferret out the thief. The humiliating tactics used by management like cameras, to watch the temps ultimately breaks up the relationships of the women. Iris passively watches as Margaret is fired unjustly; Jane escapes through her marriage and Paula gets transferred. Once all her friends are forced out of their jobs Iris starts to stand up for herself. Making herself visible with make-up and a suit her father bought for her, she gets her journal back from Cleo, and then manipulates the managers in such a way so she can get a letter of recommendation for Margaret. At the end of the movie we see Iris make a final transformation into a complete human being. Following her father's advice she never lets go of the memories of her friends from the temp job as she begins her new permanent job at the food company. I believe that's where she went, and this is why she stopped working at Global credit. In addition to the suit her father got her, She wears a gold necklace like Jane, lipstick like Paula, hair like Margaret and a new personality of her own.This movie on the surface looks like a story about temps and how they deal with the indifferent workplaces they're in however, it's has more layers than that. There's probably more to this movie than I'm writing about, each time I watch it I get something new from it.Directors Jill Sprecher and writer Karen Sprecher create a perfectly crafted film that looks and feels like real life transpiring in every frame. Production values are top notch for a low budget film. I love the office set design; the drab gray furniture and monotonous Berber carpet contrasting against the white Formica desks and bright florescent lights create an environment that's downright apathetic. The mind destroying lite muzak only adds to the insanity. But what I love most of all are the little touches in the characters' costumes, like Iris wearing no dowdy clothes and makeup, Margaret wearing the same brown rubber sole shoes with every outfit, and Paula's character overdressing and wearing too much makeup just to look younger. I also love how some supporting characters wear the same outfits two and three times. These little touches make this film just that more realistic and distinguish the character's unique personalities.The acting in this movie is just brilliant. Toni Collette gives an-Oscar level performance as Iris. The understated way she acts truly captures a shy person. You only know how she feels about what's going on at work by watching her subtle facial expressions. Parker Posey also gives an Oscar level performance as Margaret. Posey has such a strong presence that she steals all of the scenes she's in. Lisa Kudrow is in top form here as Paula. Alana Ubach is great as Jane the woman who does nothing, but kill time until the nuptials. Look For Jamie Kennedy in a standout role as the mailroom guy and Debra Jo Rupp as Barbara the evil boss who always goes by the rules regardless of the people who work for her and, David James Elliot as a tall handsome manager who doesn't see anyone under him.Clockwatchers is a top ten Shawn James Five star Essential Video. If you have a job or are starting one, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE! Mark my words in another four or five years people will be calling this movie a classic.

Now that's a company with happy and loyal employees. You  know that working for a place that values the employee's role in the  success of the company is a company that will continue to survive as each  employee will give their all to the success of the  firm.&quot;Clockwatchers&quot; shows a company that has somehow become  successful, but is falling apart without even knowing it from the lowest  ranks. Petty supervisors who don't even know the names of employees who  have been working under them for over a year... managers who publicly  humiliate employees in front of others who have no professional need to  witness it... and employees with no real job to do other than to look very  busy and watch the clock.Instead of paying 100 employees $25K each, they  could have easily paid 33 employees $75K each and gotten twice the  productivity for the same expense (less if you think about the cost of  benefits!). It's all to clear from this film that you reap what you  sow.I have plans of starting my own business in a few years and if it  becomes successful enough to the point I'm hiring employees and supervisors  of employees (whether the role is secretarial, or even restaurant workers),  I will require the viewing of this film as part of their training.",5,every employer and manager should be required to see this,963100800,"07 9, 2000",2000,1645,"['are', 'upbeat', 'moments', 'film', 'tone', 'depressing', 'movie', 'anyone', 'corporate', 'world', 'especially', 'managers', 'should', 'see.I', 'remember', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'heard', 'Kingston', 'makers', 'computer', 'memory', 'chips', 'were', 'so', 'successful', 'gave', 'employees', 'Christmas', 'equalling', 'triple', 'annual', 'salary', 'up', 'tripling', '100K', 'Now', 'company', 'happy', 'loyal', 'employees', 'know', 'working', 'place', 'employee', 'role', 'success', 'company', 'company', 'will', 'continue', 'survive', 'employee', 'will', 'give', 'success', 'firm.', 'quot', 'Clockwatchers', 'quot', 'company', 'somehow', 'become', 'successful', 'falling', 'apart', 'even', 'knowing', 'lowest', 'ranks', 'Petty', 'supervisors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'names', 'employees', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'year', 'managers', 'who', 'publicly', 'humiliate', 'employees', 'front', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'professional', 'need', 'witness', 'employees', 'real', 'job', 'do', 'other', 'look', 'very', 'busy', 'watch', 'clock.Instead', 'paying', '100', 'employees', '25K', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'paid', '33', 'employees', '75K', 'gotten', 'twice', 'productivity', 'same', 'expense', 'less', 'think', 'cost', 'benefits', 'clear', 'film', 'reap', 'what', 'sow.I', 'have', 'plans', 'starting', 'own', 'business', 'few', 'years', 'successful', 'enough', 'point', ""'m"", 'hiring', 'employees', 'supervisors', 'employees', 'role', 'secretarial', 'even', 'restaurant', 'workers', 'will', 'require', 'viewing', 'film', 'part', 'training']",Clockwatchers VHS

Everything in this is low-key and understated (except, of course, Parker Posey, and she seems just right in this). It proceeds slowly and dreamlike as these temps live  in a droning, lifeless hell. This corporation appears to have no reason for  living just as these ladies have no compelling function to fulfill at the  office. They're just there, doing silly chores and getting occassionally  micromanaged on a most minute process. Their disbelief gets further  challenged as the corporation takes ugly monitoring steps to reduce a rash  of thefts (stolen paperweights, pens and coffee mugs!). It's like a setting  from one of those Tom Stoppard plays of the absurd, but made palatable for  the movie audience.Management is barely present at this corporation.  Usually, they're off to meetings, never answering their phones and never  minding the store, leaving these temps alone to ponder this strange  setting. When management appears they are portrayed disconnected  automatons, not the type of Machavellian Dogberts you might expect in an  office sendup movie.Toni Collete is amazing. She can telegraph every  thought and nuance. She does not even need to speak for us to know what is  going on.",4,Deceptive.

473070,A18CRS4FLVH5YW,630567681X,"Star Sailor ""Worldwide Traveler""","[3, 4]","I was very impressed with this little gem of a film.  Toni Collette is brilliant with her role.  She has come a long way from &quot;Muriels Wedding&quot; and has made quite a name for herself as a character actor.  Lisa Kudrow plays a great cynic.  Parker Posey holds her trademark dark spritely self and does a great scene where she gets fired.  All in all this movie presents a excellent interpretation of todays American office politics and how people in todays workforce are underpaid, underappreciated and are continually thrown to the way side.  This movie holds well and makes you feel right along with what is going on within the film.  I saw this movie on Starz just recently and I recommend seeing it for free first before buying this on DVD since this movie isn't all that great on DVD with the exception of wide screen format.
