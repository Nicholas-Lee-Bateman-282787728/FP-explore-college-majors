The film is one of those timeless classics. Growing up in Brooklyn, this has to be one of my favorite  films.

63692,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0783230524,Austin Somlo,"[1, 5]","Viewed: 8/02, 8/06Rate: 18/02: This is one of the downright worst films I have ever seen, close to Waterboy, Vertical Limit, and The Legend of Bagger Vance. The actors in this movie are horrible. I find this movie unbearable and difficult to watch in one seating, continuing to squirm around. I stopped this video at least 15 times, making promises to myself to watch it at a time for 10 to 15 minutes each. The story is god-awful, and this movie has hit the bottom point based on moral values, especially on the perspective of how a ghetto Black family lives. The girl Troy makes me sick to my stomach. How they beat the white neighbor with glasses makes me to say that Spike Lee should be ashamed of himself displaying this kind of mockery. This movie is an obvious revelation that Spike Lee is a racist. I am not a racist, but this kind of scene is giving a message that white people, especially the ugly ones, deserve to be beaten up and made mockery out of. Wake up Spike Lee...this is not the 1960's when you can be Malcolm X of the African-American generation in the late 20th and the early 21st century. Spike Lee had no justification to provoke the old anger of Malcolm X through filmmaking. What I don't understand is why Troy (the leading black sister) is so special and still hurts the society, getting away with it. One of the worst line I have heard through the film was, ""I hope we don't have to dress up for mommy's funeral."" I am speechless as it seems like the children of the family do not really care about the mother's passing. I don't even appreciate the boy with glasses, beating up his siblings, be allowed to have total freedom to choose basketball over anything more important. The mother made me sick to my stomach also. The portrayal of her as a role model is nonexistent. Finally, last thing to say, when the movie nearly ends and the mother dies, I am calling it as an act of disrespect made by Spike Lee in reference to making the movie a ""worthy-audience-gripping-to-feeling-sad-for-them"" change of tide. I am telling you, this is an absolute one of the worst and racist films I have ever seen, and I have no respect for Spike Lee's work still even though I have seen Malcolm X, He Got Game, Do the Right Thing, etc.. The most important African-American film maker of the decade or even the century? Please...spare me the humor.8/06: Crooklyn is a terrible film, lacking any value of entertainment and containing the worst characters I could possibly endure. I am not appreciative of any film where it's okay to lie and get away with it, beat up somebody because he looks geeky, and a mother teacher who actually profanes around her children and beating them around by her strictness. Who cares if it's a black film? It doesn't make it any more special than others. Oh good riddance...the mother died. That was the best part of the film. Yeah, she was an awful person to begin with. Crooklyn is appropriately titled because it's a breeding ground of future criminals. Looking how the black children lived was enough to convince me. Please, show me a nicer family than them, and I'll watch as long as there is a point. Also, please throw in some entertainment value. Spike Lee can't make a decent film...he is just a terrible filmmaker. All he does is portray extremities and try to shock people, but that's old and tired. Crooklyn was too formalistic because I've seen this type of movie in Terms of Endearment. Of the DVD, I can't believe it, as I thought it was a technical error in the VHS tape, that I saw the same squeeze, starting in the home of an Aunt in Maryland and lasted for a good portion of time. That was intolerable. ""I hope we don't have to dress up for mommy's funeral,"" one of the children says. Nice...real nice.

""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","Crooklyn, which Lee co-wrote with his siblings Joie Lee and Cinque Lee, marks a departure for Spike in its subject matter, offering a warm, tragicomic look at growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1970s, when the main drugs parents had to worry about their kids falling prey to wasn't crack or heroin but television and sugar. Alfre Woodard and Delroy Lindo head the Carmichael clan, a family of seven loosely based on the real-life Lees.Woodard plays Carolyn, who teaches school and tries to keep the house in order, including her husband Woody (Lindo), a musician trying to stay true to his art even if that means placing his family in a financial strait-jacket. Crooklyn takes the point of view of the family's only daughter, 9-year-old Troy (Zelda Harris). While the film certainly looks through her eyes, it doesn't seem to be a strong enough viewpoint to carry the film's whimsical meandering. While Woodard, Lindo and Harris all give solid performances, the four brothers tend to disappear into the woodwork, never really developing into characters in their own rights. Subplots about a neighbor (David Patrick Kelly) and two glue-sniffing street kids (one played by Spike Lee) appear but never really go anywhere, though the glue sniffers do provide some funny camera angles. There aren't many overt flaws in Crooklyn. All but the most comic of urban violence has been removed, and we're left with a somewhat-idealized view of an early-70s Brooklyn.Lee is as talented as any director is capturing an era, and some of the early scenes perfectly recall the mood of the time. The pop soundtrack may be a little too obvious, but it gets the job done. As usual, Lee has assembled an excellent cast. Alfre Woodard and Delroy Lindo do tremendous jobs. David Patrick Kelly provides a little comic relief as the white next-door neighbor who annoys just about everyone. Then there's Zelda Harris, whose unaffected performance is the glue that holds the picture together.Crooklyn turns out pleasant enough, but by the end, it feels as if something has been left out and it just stops. The world of a child -- especially one pushed all-too-soon into adulthood -- is never easy, and this film captures the facets of Troy's odyssey.

It is probably the second best movie that director, Spike Lee has ever made. Lee's best was the classic 80's flick &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;.But while &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; was about ethnic tensions, racism and strife, &quot;Crooklyn&quot; is a film about love.In the movie we meet the Carmichael family. They yell, scream, call each names, even get into physical fights.But it is very evident, that love is very strong among this large brood.Dad (well played by Delroy Lindo) is a musician who is trying to create some honest music thats important to him. Mom (fabulously played by Alfre Woodard) is pulling her hair out, trying to keep this inner city family's finances above water, while trying to stop the kids from killing each other.But the film really centers on 9 year old Troy (Zelda Harris) who shows us the ins and outs of her family life and the close Brooklyn neighborhood that she is growing up in. Juvenile actress, Zelda Harris gives us an amazing starring performance that is totally believable. The movie is pretty much autobiographical (Lee wrote it with his sister Joie)and it richly lays on the 1970s nostalgia with cultural references among other things to &quot;Soul Train&quot;, the &quot;Patridge Family&quot;, Walt Fraiser, and baseball stategamatic.The film also has a wonderful soundtrack which is packed with '70s R&amp;B and pop music from groups like the Jackson 5, the Spinners, Curtis Mayfield, the Staple Singers and Sly and the Family Stone.In fact, my favorite part of this movie is the opening credit sequence, where you hear Marc Dorsey's &quot;People Make the World Go Round&quot;, while the film shows us the neighborhood's children playing various sidewalk, kids games.Between Soccer practice and video games, do kids even do this anymore?

The movie has quite a bit of love in it and that carries the story above and beyond the usual family history movie.  The girl's impression of the local drug addicts are hilarious.

Naturally, this coming-of-age  family comedy set in Brooklyn during the 70's obviously has a strong  autobiographical slant to it (the screenplay was written by Spike and two  of his siblings, the story itself was credited solely to his sister, Joie),  but if you've read Spike's out-of-print diary of the making of his first  film &quot;She's Gotta Have It&quot;, then you get an even stronger idea of  how personal this film is to Spike; the Clinton character is obviously  molded after him.  The acting, cinematography, cultural references, music  and acting are all superior.  Most creative was the debut of Spike's  &quot;slimmed-in&quot; cinematography during the Virginia sequence, which  would soon become a Spike Lee trademark.  Fans of Delroy Lindo who haven't  seen this film will be surprised with his gentle &amp; sensitive  performance.I'll tell you why this film has such a profound impact on  me.  I, like many others, have seen hundreds of films set in different  times, places, etc.  But very few films have been able to transport me back  to another time &amp; place as effectively as &quot;Crooklyn&quot;.  For  the duration of the film, I really feel as if I'm enjoying an intimate  portrait of a working-class black family in Brooklyn during the 1970's,  it's like I'm right there.

Who can forget this gem?Crooklyn is loosely based on Spike Lee's life growing up. Its mostly a story that mostly details the struggles of a family growing up in Brooklyn as seen through the eyes of Troy(played by Zelda Harris). There are beautiful performances to be seen here. Alfre Woodard's presense is felt as the stern but loving mother of four kids and Delroy Lindo's is great as the father who is also dealing with pressure as a struggling musician and trying to pay the rent on time. They go through the normal strife that any black family has to go through in poor areas but they still find a way to maintain. I remember as a kid that the last scene with the mom passing on had me choked up. Troy and her brother holding hands at the reception for the funeral was a touching scene too. They drove each other crazy but it was still love in the end. Crooklyn has brief moments of awareness like one scene in particular: Troy's aunt comparing troy's hair to her adopted child's hair saying that the adopted child's hair was good hairnad that Troy's hair was rough was a sublte form of self-hatred but most people wouldnt pick up on that. Of course Spike Lee has to make an appearance in the movie. He plays a junkie who chases kids around trying to steal money from them. In short Crooklyn stands out as one the best dramas of all time and one of Spike Lee's best work. The characters are ones that you care about, their struggles are real and anybody who has been there can also relate.
