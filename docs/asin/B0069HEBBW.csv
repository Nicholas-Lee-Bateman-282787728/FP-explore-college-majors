We have about 21 Baby Einstein Videos and we like all of them.  My kiddo who is almost 2 years old has been listening to mom play the congas since before he was born.  He likes all musical instruments.  This DVD has a lot of great stuff for kiddos to learn about. This is a great DVD.,5,Great Video,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,371,"['am', 'going', 'write', 'same', 'review', 'gave', 'video', 'World', 'Music', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'have', '21', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'Videos', 'like', 'kiddo', 'who', 'almost', '2', 'years', 'old', 'been', 'listening', 'mom', 'play', 'congas', 'was', 'born', 'musical', 'instruments', 'DVD', 'lot', 'great', 'stuff', 'kiddos', 'learn', 'about', 'great', 'DVD']",N/A

The video is not long.  Just 25-30minutes but it's long enough to entertain the babies.  Plus they have a couple of shorter versions that they can watch that are between 5-10 minutes in length.",5,Great DVD for babies 3mo's+,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,326,"['twins', 'love', 'only', 'were', '3', 'months', 'old', 'when', 'appreciated', 'music', 'visuals', 'esp', 'puppets', 'video', 'not', 'long', 'Just', '25-30minutes', 'long', 'enough', 'entertain', 'babies', 'have', 'couple', 'shorter', 'versions', 'can', 'watch', 'are', '5-10', 'minutes', 'length']",N/A
