327310,A1LH7YTNTWP6MT,6302676576,Andrew Furst,"[0, 1]","I greatly enjoyed ""Magnum P.I."" back in the 1980's, and I've been a baseball fan much longer than that.  I missed this in the theaters but figured I'd take a chance on the DVD at a relatively cheap price.  Even with low expectations, I was disappointed.  The outline of the story is actually promising - an American major league baseball player, once great but past his prime, has Japan as his only option.  He's an arrogant jerk, and he immediately clashes with the Japanese culture and the Japanese team manager.  Both player and manager are hard-headed but ultimately need each other to succeed.  Great idea, very poor execution.  For one thing, Selleck is somewhat miscast, it's just too hard to see him as a complete jerk after being the ""good guy"" in Magnum all those years.  The language is unnecessarily foul, and again pretty shocking to hear coming from Selleck.There are several juvenile scenes of giving a player a ""hotfoot"", something that apparently happened now and then in baseball's early years, but I doubt was ever part of baseball in the 1990's.  Likewise, the excessive tobacco chewing (and spitting) seems out of place in the 1990's.  Worst of all are the insulting references to Japan as some sort of land of ""little people"", extremely superstitious and bound to tradition.  Again and again, the 6'4 Selleck hits his head on too-low doorways for the cheap laugh.  I have no idea if the stadiums are really like that in Japan, but given that there have been several Japanese players in the US of roughly Selleck's height, it seems unlikely there would have been so much undersized architecture even back in the early 1990's.  Also, it's shown that there are several other tall American baseball players in Japan, even some tall Japanese players, so making Selleck seem like Gulliver among the Lilliputians seems wrong, and at any extent seems overplayed.  They also get too much into Japanese baths and bathrooms; I realize that those are different from the USA, but it still seems like there's too much focus on these, played for cheap laughs.  More cheap laughs come from the endless, silly clips of Japanese commercials and reality shows - while these certainly exist, the impression one gets is that this is virtually ALL there is to Japanese TV.  Maybe this is supposed to be simply the view of the ""ugly American"" character played by Selleck, but the net result is a movie that seems eager to portray Japan as a silly, superstitious culture of short people.  Pretty painful to watch a lot of that; it would have been nice to see more balance, the silly with the serious.Dennis Haysbert does a nice job in a fairly small role as Selleck's fellow American teammate.  Selleck's personal translator does a great job, though to me he looked a little too round-eyed to be authentically ethnic Japanese (maybe he is Japanese, but his appearance seemed to undermine the authenticity a bit here).  There's a romantic angle between Selleck's character and a Japanese woman which is ok, not great.  Unfortunately the woman - though in many ways ""modern"" - also seems to embrace a lot a superstitious traditions.  It's also not particularly clear why she's so interested in Selleck's self-absorbed character, unless she's mesmerized by his large hairy chest - which is shown prominently in numerous scenes.As far as the actual baseball play, there could be more of it.  Mainly it emphasizes that the Japanese players have been taught not to be too aggressive, with the intent of avoiding mistakes rather than making the great play, and that Selleck's character is not as great a hitter as he thinks he is.  This all plays out to a fairly logical conclusion; again my problem is not with the overall storyline but the details.  On the positive side, the photography of the baseball plays is quite good (especially the pitcher-to-hitter action), and Selleck swings the bat in a convincing way.  Overall though, I recommend not watching this, unless you are a completest who wants to see every ""baseball"" movie, every Tom Selleck vehicle, or everything that purports to be ""about Japan"".  I understand that this movie was not well-received in Japan, and I think I can understand why.",2,It's pretty bad.,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,4196,"['greatly', 'enjoyed', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'back', '1980', ""'ve"", 'been', 'baseball', 'fan', 'much', 'longer', 'missed', 'theaters', 'figured', ""'d"", 'take', 'chance', 'DVD', 'relatively', 'cheap', 'price', 'Even', 'low', 'expectations', 'was', 'disappointed', 'outline', 'story', 'actually', 'promising', 'American', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'player', 'once', 'great', 'past', 'prime', 'Japan', 'only', 'option', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'immediately', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Japanese', 'team', 'manager', 'player', 'manager', 'are', 'hard-headed', 'ultimately', 'need', 'other', 'succeed', 'Great', 'idea', 'very', 'poor', 'execution', 'one', 'thing', 'Selleck', 'somewhat', 'miscast', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'see', 'complete', 'jerk', 'being', 'good', 'guy', 'Magnum', 'years', 'language', 'unnecessarily', 'foul', 'again', 'pretty', 'shocking', 'hear', 'coming', 'Selleck.There', 'are', 'several', 'juvenile', 'scenes', 'giving', 'player', 'hotfoot', 'something', 'apparently', 'happened', 'now', 'then', 'baseball', 'early', 'years', 'doubt', 'was', 'ever', 'part', 'baseball', '1990', 'Likewise', 'excessive', 'tobacco', 'chewing', 'spitting', 'place', '1990', 'Worst', 'are', 'insulting', 'references', 'Japan', 'sort', 'land', 'little', 'people', 'extremely', 'superstitious', 'bound', 'tradition', 'Again', 'again', '6', '4', 'Selleck', 'head', 'too-low', 'doorways', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'have', 'idea', 'stadiums', 'are', 'really', 'Japan', 'given', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'Japanese', 'players', 'US', 'roughly', 'Selleck', 'height', 'unlikely', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'undersized', 'architecture', 'even', 'back', 'early', '1990', 'Also', 'shown', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'tall', 'American', 'baseball', 'players', 'Japan', 'even', 'tall', 'Japanese', 'players', 'making', 'Selleck', 'seem', 'Gulliver', 'Lilliputians', 'wrong', 'extent', 'overplayed', 'also', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'Japanese', 'baths', 'bathrooms', 'realize', 'are', 'different', 'USA', 'still', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'played', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'More', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'come', 'endless', 'silly', 'clips', 'Japanese', 'commercials', 'reality', 'shows', 'certainly', 'exist', 'impression', 'one', 'virtually', 'ALL', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'Maybe', 'supposed', 'be', 'simply', 'view', 'ugly', 'American', 'character', 'played', 'Selleck', 'net', 'result', 'movie', 'eager', 'portray', 'Japan', 'silly', 'superstitious', 'culture', 'short', 'people', 'Pretty', 'painful', 'watch', 'lot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'balance', 'silly', 'serious.Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'nice', 'job', 'fairly', 'small', 'role', 'Selleck', 'fellow', 'American', 'teammate', 'Selleck', 'personal', 'translator', 'great', 'job', 'looked', 'little', 'too', 'round-eyed', 'be', 'authentically', 'ethnic', 'Japanese', 'maybe', 'Japanese', 'appearance', 'seemed', 'undermine', 'authenticity', 'bit', 'here', 'romantic', 'angle', 'Selleck', 'character', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'ok', 'not', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'woman', 'many', 'ways', 'modern', 'also', 'embrace', 'lot', 'superstitious', 'traditions', 'also', 'not', 'particularly', 'clear', 'why', 'so', 'interested', 'Selleck', 'self-absorbed', 'character', 'mesmerized', 'large', 'hairy', 'chest', 'shown', 'prominently', 'numerous', 'scenes.As', 'far', 'actual', 'baseball', 'play', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'Mainly', 'Japanese', 'players', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'aggressive', 'intent', 'avoiding', 'mistakes', 'rather', 'making', 'great', 'play', 'Selleck', 'character', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'hitter', 'out', 'fairly', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'again', 'problem', 'not', 'overall', 'storyline', 'details', 'positive', 'side', 'photography', 'baseball', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'pitcher-to-hitter', 'action', 'Selleck', 'swings', 'bat', 'convincing', 'way', 'Overall', 'recommend', 'not', 'watching', 'are', 'completest', 'who', 'see', 'baseball', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'vehicle', 'everything', 'be', 'Japan', 'understand', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'well-received', 'Japan', 'think', 'can', 'understand', 'why']",N/A

327317,A2V7EO331SFUF6,6302676576,D.B. Spalding,"[23, 24]","MR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a ""light, sports comedy"" it truly has a heartwarming core as human and universal as some of Capra's finest. At the plot level, you have the paradox of baseball, a fine old American game, as it is played in Japan - turned around, with American values cast off and Japanese values imprinted upon the game. (Some of the superficial ""sports comedy"" results from Jack's uncomprehending disbelief at how ""basa-boru"" is played in Japan.) You also have a lead character who's presented as an over-the-hill, aging baseball star, but who is actually quite immature - pro ball allowed him to postpone growing up. And you have a lead character who is rudely resistant to the changes in his life that are being forced upon him, refusing to accept the curveball that life has given him, in the midst of a new country, a new manager, a new team, and a new girlfriend, who have all welcomed him and try to accept him. Sound like heavy stuff? Not really. It's a charming ""clash of cultures"" comedy that takes place on the national, sports, romantic, and professional levels. But if you watch it sensitively enough, you will also find a great story about a man who has to abandon his immaturity and grow up way too late in life (causing some amount of personal pain), and finds success in places he never expected it. I love the story, but I also have great respect for Selleck's performance; he bares his tush (literally) to portray an ugly American, insulting people and throwing tantrums in public, then lets us inside this character to understand his dismay.

The story is about Selleck who is a has been star on the Yankees baseball team who is abruptly traded to a Japanese team. Shocked at first when he is told, he is in for a whole new territory when he finds himself lost in Japan.He was once a star, but age and bad habits have caught up to him. In one of the first scenes, Frank Thomas plays the backup who is ready to take his spot and outshine him. Also, we see he is a wise ass, basically a grown up kid still pulling lame pranks on the players around him. Like I mentioned, he developed bad habits as a player, being unable to hit to the opposite field(ie: one dimensional ability).While in Japan, he continues his bonehead antics, insulting his teammates, assistants around him and worst of all, his new team manager, a hard-ass that is not impressed with his jokes. I have to say right here, the movie is ridiculous, but there are some interesting thoughts on differences in culture and culture assimilation.After a few days in Japan, he gets to the team facilities and immediately sticks out, walking around in his shoes(not knowing to take them off), sitting near his locker while the team gathers and other such things that he must quickly learn to adjust. He meets another American player played by Dennis Haysbert, who warns to respect the team and how it works, not to continue his antics. He messes up like usual, though, and ticks everyone off.The movie is a fairly basic/cheesy comedy troughout, but again I found it somewhat entertaining and I liked the concept of the Selleck character having to learn the traditions around him and improve his own bad habits in playing baseball. The team manager is played by a Japanese guy who was also in Black Rain. It's interesting, because this movie and Black Rain do have a parallel which again makes the concept interesting. They are both about a stale American who must continue his work in Japan, overcome/respect culture differences, then ultimately make it back home to America.",3,"Baseball hijinks, with ridiculous star, make for ridiculous fun.",1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,2085,"['somewhat', 'silly', 'movie', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'came', 'out', 'early', '90s', 'story', 'Selleck', 'who', 'been', 'star', 'Yankees', 'baseball', 'team', 'who', 'abruptly', 'traded', 'Japanese', 'team', 'Shocked', 'first', 'when', 'told', 'whole', 'new', 'territory', 'when', 'lost', 'Japan.He', 'was', 'once', 'star', 'age', 'bad', 'habits', 'have', 'caught', 'up', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'Frank', 'Thomas', 'backup', 'who', 'ready', 'take', 'spot', 'outshine', 'Also', 'see', 'wise', 'ass', 'basically', 'grown', 'up', 'kid', 'still', 'pulling', 'lame', 'pranks', 'players', 'mentioned', 'developed', 'bad', 'habits', 'player', 'being', 'unable', 'hit', 'opposite', 'field', 'ie', 'one', 'dimensional', 'ability', '.While', 'Japan', 'bonehead', 'antics', 'insulting', 'teammates', 'assistants', 'worst', 'new', 'team', 'manager', 'hard-ass', 'not', 'impressed', 'jokes', 'have', 'say', 'right', 'here', 'movie', 'ridiculous', 'are', 'interesting', 'thoughts', 'differences', 'culture', 'culture', 'assimilation.After', 'few', 'days', 'Japan', 'team', 'facilities', 'immediately', 'sticks', 'out', 'walking', 'around', 'shoes', 'not', 'knowing', 'take', 'off', 'sitting', 'locker', 'team', 'gathers', 'other', 'such', 'things', 'must', 'quickly', 'learn', 'adjust', 'American', 'player', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'who', 'respect', 'team', 'how', 'not', 'continue', 'antics', 'up', 'usual', 'though', 'ticks', 'everyone', 'off.The', 'movie', 'fairly', 'basic/cheesy', 'comedy', 'troughout', 'again', 'found', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'liked', 'concept', 'Selleck', 'character', 'having', 'learn', 'traditions', 'improve', 'own', 'bad', 'habits', 'playing', 'baseball', 'team', 'manager', 'played', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Black', 'Rain', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Black', 'Rain', 'do', 'have', 'parallel', 'again', 'concept', 'interesting', 'are', 'stale', 'American', 'who', 'must', 'continue', 'work', 'Japan', 'overcome/respect', 'culture', 'differences', 'then', 'ultimately', 'make', 'back', 'home', 'America']",N/A

327347,A3CI4SA5MCHOR,6302676576,"raboof ""Lauren in Tokyo""","[11, 12]","Tom Selleck plays Jack Elliot in this funny and insightful comedy about an American baseball player 'demoted' to the Japanese league.  It has all the cultural in-jokes that you'd expect including ""Taking a bath before washing"", ""Wearing shoes indoors"", and ""You say one thing, the translator will make it sound nice"".But at the heart of the movie, the story is all about accepting foreign culture.  Jack butts heads with Japanese culture.  He is loose, relaxed, and immature.  The Japanese are tight, uptight, and very serious.  As long as everyone sees him as an outsider, they will respect him in public but doubt him in private, and he will never truly fit in.After a series of humiliating losses, he finally reaches the point where he realizes that his strength and skill are not enough to defeat his problems and he turns to the coach and Japanese culture to help him overcome his ego.  The coach admonishes him to stop feeding off of his past successes lest he eat all those successes away, look only to the future in other words.  He does so and the rest of the movie shows Elliot becoming stronger in the stadium and spiritual world.  By embracing the Japanese Way, he becomes a better person.However, the flip side to this movie is that the Japanese Way has led to a failing baseball team.  Despite the coach's best efforts to harangue the players into playing well, they are too gunshy to play their best.  It isn't until the coach accepts that the softer method of coaching based on encouraging the players and fostering a team spirit that the team's slump ends.  Jack Elliot made his own mark on the team by bringing trademark American-style attitude to the team.In the end the message is clear.  At the micro-level, the Japanese style of living with its emphasis on detail, cooperation, and austerity is beneficial, and the American style emphasizing laziness, freedom, and individuality is detrimental.  At the macro-level, though, the message is quite the opposite.  Success is brought by each individual's freedom to make mistakes, being relaxed, and not having an oppressive culture looming above.It's a fun movie with a lot of insight into the Japanese culture as well as insight into American culture.

A couple of the preceding reviews nicely capture the surprising complexity of characterization in a film which isn't short on gags, most of them originating from Selleck's boyish and inconsiderate antics, which nonetheless contribute to his dual role as a student and teacher.The film is a bit short on plot, but manages to go deeper into characterization than either ""Bull Durham"" or a contemporaneous East-West baseball comedy starring Michael Keaton.  There's no need to exaggerate the accuracy of the representation of Japanese ways, but what there is to see strikes this reviewer, who's read ""You Gotta Have Wah,"" as an accurate look at Japanese culture through baseball, a strikingly individualistic sport for all the talk about team spirit (my theory explaining its appeal to the Japanese).Perhaps it's a bit surprising to see the Walt Disney sponsorship of a film which, though clean of guns and violence, has more sex than is considered acceptable by the standards of the new ""American Puritanism.""  Ava Takanashi, who has the assignment of getting Sellek into bed but not before undressing and bathing him, is at once as delicate and modest as she is determined and effective.

For another, the schism between American and Japanese ideologies/way of life is just so truly captured that it is difficult to believe this movie is not the de-facto recommendation for people interested in Japan. Guess it missed out on the major league scene because, well, quite literally it is not about US major leagues?A US baseball star (Selleck) is traded to a Japanese baseball team and finds himself at intellectual loggerheads with the extant coach of the team. This, plus a slight romantic sub-plot as he falls in love with the coach's daughter.Barring some minor cheesy moments -- e.g., when the coach takes Selleck to a golf driving range and makes him hit the balls with a baseball bat, only to hear ""I want to hit balls"" instead of ""I want to hit baseballs""...hmm -- the accuracy of Japanese life is truly stunning. Including, eating ramen with vociferous slurps, digging chopsticks vertically in rice bowls being a no-no, the language used to communicate between the American/Japanese, even a scene with a real on-sen. A refreshing break after stereotype galore seen in movies of that time, including the entertaining ""Black Rain"" or the absolutely goofball ""Rising Sun"".To cut to the chase, this is an under-rated gem of a movie, very well shot, some messages about life and profession as seen from two very different perspectives that are likely to resonate with either side.  Selleck takes the cake with his acting, baring his tush (literally, I may add) to portray a grouchy American, snubbing people relentlessly and throwing tantrums in public, then letting us inside this character to understand his views.

327359,A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,6302676576,Todd7,"[2, 4]","Mr. Baseball (1992) is a movie that has its share of flaws and frustrations. First of all, choosing Tom Selleck as the main character was probably a mistake. I know that he's a big baseball fan, and was probably the reason why he was given the role, rather than fitting a perfect mold. Selleck has to play an immature role (as the script says) for a guy who's accustomed to more serious roles in the past, and the result is a disaster of sorts. For example, how many times did he have to say ""God damn"" in this movie? Is that the phrase that reinforces this guys contempt for playing in Japan and having a hard time adapting to their culture? Seems way over the top to me. Another thing that I noticed while watching this film is the frequent absence of music. I wouldn't want to own the soundtrack, if there is even one out there.

327363,A38QEATH3NODFM,6302676576,Wiseguy 945,"[2, 2]","I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out, Tom Selleck was riding the wave of success that three men and a baby, and trying to solidify himself in the movies, he took this roll in Mr. Baseball.  Selleck plays an arrogant american baseball star who is in a prolonged slump in his carreer, facing retirement or trade, he chooses trade. Little did he know the trade would be far beyond a transfer from the east coast to the west coast...how about across the pacific.  He ends up in Japan playing in the japaneese league.  Being stubborn in his Superstar ways, he doesn't want to change his way to ""be a team player"". Selleck actually does a great job at playing a jerk, disrespectful to his new team and even to the culture. Well, as any superstar with a big head and small brain, he starts chasing this Beutiful japaneese businesswoman that works for the team in advertising/promotion.  Little does he know that she's the Manager's daughter.  Will the star change his ways, will he fail because of ego?  Great story, entertaining and some funny parts, but goal is to show and build respect for other cultures and be more open. It reminds me of a movie a few years earlier, Gung Ho.  Yes, the movie does somewhat feel dated now, showing the stereotypical japaneese culture and preaching a message of openess, coming from a time in the 80's when Japan-US relations were lower because of the resessions and Japaneese movement of business into our country, Like the closing of american automotive plants and opening of the toyota and honda factories in the us. This film was meant to be a booster for starting to heal a wound that had really developed.  The message is universal and timeless, just be open, and show respect to other cultures, and you might learn something.

327365,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,6302676576,Zack Davisson,"[7, 7]","The biggest surprise of ""Mr. Baseball"" is not that it's actually a pretty good movie, which it is, but that it's one of the few entries in the ""Wacky Japan"" genre that delivers an honest portrayal of Japan and the Japanese people, as well as as the awkwardness of being a foreigner in Japan, instead of stereotype-ridden nonsense like ""Gung Ho!"" and ""Lost in Translation.""The plot is pretty basic.  An aging baseball player gets traded to a Japanese team. Proceed fish out of water story, complete with convenient love story and eventual cultural reconciliation, which shows that both countries have something to give.  Its a common enough theme, but still worthwhile if pulled off well.  The story has a foundation of truth, being based in part on American ball player Randy Bass and his attempt to break Japanese legend Sadaharu Oh's home run record while playing for the Osaka-based Hanshin Tigers.Much of the film is carried by Tom Selleck, who has shown in films like ""Quigley Down Under"" and ""In & Out"" that he can handle the big screen.  He has an easy charm about him, which helps him establish a likable character even when he is being a big loudmouth American jerk.  His foil is Coach Uchiyama, played by Ken Takakura who is arguably the greatest Japanese actor of his generation. It was a shock to hear Takakura speak English. I didn't know he could!  The two represent the obstinate styles of their representative countries,  neither willing to give in or admit the strengths of the other.  In-between these two are the American baseball player Max ""Hammer"" Dubois, who has been in Japan for awhile and has assimilated more or less, and the beautiful Hiroko, who is finally strong enough to break through Selleck's pigheadedness.So no surprises with the story, but anyone looking for a real window in what it is to come to Japan as a foreigner could do worse that checking out ""Mr. Baseball.""  Its one of the few movies I wish I had actually seen before I came to Japan, although seeing it afterwards I was able to reminisce fondly over the same mistakes I made, and the same stupid assumptions I brought over.",4,You gotta have Wa,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,2122,"['biggest', 'surprise', 'Mr', 'Baseball', 'not', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'entries', 'Wacky', 'Japan', 'genre', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'awkwardness', 'being', 'foreigner', 'Japan', 'instead', 'stereotype-ridden', 'nonsense', 'Gung', 'Ho', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'plot', 'pretty', 'basic', 'aging', 'baseball', 'player', 'traded', 'Japanese', 'team', 'Proceed', 'fish', 'water', 'story', 'complete', 'convenient', 'love', 'story', 'eventual', 'cultural', 'reconciliation', 'countries', 'have', 'something', 'give', 'common', 'enough', 'theme', 'still', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'story', 'foundation', 'truth', 'being', 'based', 'part', 'American', 'ball', 'player', 'Randy', 'Bass', 'attempt', 'break', 'Japanese', 'legend', 'Sadaharu', 'Oh', 'home', 'run', 'record', 'playing', 'Osaka-based', 'Hanshin', 'Tigers.Much', 'film', 'carried', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'who', 'shown', 'films', 'Quigley', 'Down', 'Out', 'can', 'handle', 'big', 'screen', 'easy', 'charm', 'establish', 'likable', 'character', 'even', 'when', 'being', 'big', 'loudmouth', 'American', 'jerk', 'foil', 'Coach', 'Uchiyama', 'played', 'Ken', 'Takakura', 'who', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'generation', 'was', 'shock', 'hear', 'Takakura', 'speak', 'English', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'two', 'represent', 'obstinate', 'styles', 'representative', 'countries', 'willing', 'give', 'admit', 'strengths', 'other', 'In-between', 'two', 'are', 'American', 'baseball', 'player', 'Max', 'Hammer', 'Dubois', 'who', 'been', 'Japan', 'awhile', 'assimilated', 'more', 'less', 'beautiful', 'Hiroko', 'who', 'finally', 'strong', 'enough', 'break', 'Selleck', 'pigheadedness.So', 'surprises', 'story', 'anyone', 'looking', 'real', 'window', 'what', 'come', 'Japan', 'foreigner', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'checking', 'out', 'Mr', 'Baseball', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'wish', 'had', 'actually', 'seen', 'came', 'Japan', 'seeing', 'was', 'able', 'reminisce', 'fondly', 'same', 'mistakes', 'made', 'same', 'stupid', 'assumptions', 'brought', 'over']",N/A
