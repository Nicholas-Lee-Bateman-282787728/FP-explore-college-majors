770349,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000B1OFL,A Customer,"[0, 2]","Summary:Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) and John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) are career criminals that have surrounded themselves with criminal experts to help them in their burgling exploits. They have their getaway specialist, Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), their technology specialist, Lyle/The Napster (Seth Green), and their demolitions specialist, Left Ear (Mos Def).The movie begins with a very well thought out heist in Venice, Italy where the gang, with the help of another career criminal, Steve (Edward Norton), steals 30+ million dollars in gold and pulls it off without a hitch... well, almost.The hitch is Steve double crosses the rest of the group, kills John, and leaves the rest for dead. But Charlie and the rest of the gang don't give up so easily. They escape, regroup, and track Steve down in Los Angeles. The only problem is without John, who also happened to be the group's safe cracker, the group doesn't have anyone that can open the safe where Charlie is keeping the gold. Charlie then turns to John's daughter, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), who happens to be a legitimate safe specialist, to help them bring Steve down by stealing his gold.Stella agrees and the group sets up their plan - lure Steve out of the house, break in, steal the gold, and get out of LA before Steve is any wiser. But Steve catches on to the plan when he figures out Stella's identity. The result is a much more complicated plan that results in high speed chases involving helicopters, Mini-Coopers, and armored trucks. The movie ends with Steve being done in by someone other than Charlie's group, but he is delivered into their hands by Charlie. Though it takes some doing, Charlie and the gang get the gold, Stella gets satisfaction, and Charlie and Stella get each other.My Comments:Following in the tradition of caper movies, this movie sets you up to root for criminals (something my wife continuously points out to me as being supportive of anti-social behaviors). Also, this movie is kind of a remake of a movie from the sixties with the same name. But based upon what the writers and director of the film have to say (I haven't seen the original), the movies are actually quite different.As far as the story goes, it's pretty solid. I was very impressed by the eventual resolution of pretty much every plot point. For example, after `The Italian Job' (the heist in Venice), each of the gang members goes around saying what they are going to do with their share of the money. When Steve turns on them, they obviously can't afford to do what they had planned. However, Steve takes all of their advice and gets all of the things they had wanted. But once the tables are again reversed and Steve meets his fate, the movie concludes with the dreams of the gang members being realized. This is really just a very small part of the movie, but the fact that it was included and well-resolved speaks highly of the care given to details in this film.However, there are some problems with the story that, if resolved, would have made the movie both more convincing and more entertaining. The major problem I had with the story was Stella's motivation for getting involved in the second heist. I think through a combination of poor acting on Charlize Theron's part and part scripting and dialogue, Stella's motivation turns into a mottled sense of revenge, but it was not a very convincing sense of revenge and definitely didn't seem like enough motivation to leave what appeared to be a very good job in order to get involved in what could potentially result in Stella's death. If you can give the movie leeway here, the rest of the movie is good enough that you can quickly forget that Stella's motivation is not only shallow but weak.The other problems really just involve kind of poor decisions on the part of the writers, even though the decisions are probably justified because without them the movie would not have been able to continue. How the gang survives being dumped into a reservoir in the top of the Alps is beyond me. After about a minute in that water they would have been suffering the effects of hypothermia. It never could have happened. Also rather silly is the idea that Steve, who just happens to be on the lamb, would hit on a cable repair person despite thinking that he recognizes her. This obviously advances the story by given Charlie and his gang the ideas for plan B and makes the movie much more exciting, but is still pretty forced. I should point out, however, that despite having problems with some of these things I really didn't see them as being that distracting. It really is a pretty solid movie.As for the acting, I was actually pretty impressed, especially by Mark Wahlberg. Perhaps this is just the perfect role for him, because I have not been impressed with him in the past, or maybe he's just improving, but I really liked him in this role. With the exception of some of Charlize Theron's poorer segments, the rest of the cast was really good. Seth Green, Jason Statham, and Mos Def were all very funny. I do have to admit that I was surprised to see Statham in a supporting role after what I thought was a pretty good performance in The Transporter. The only other problem I had with the acting is that Edward Norton's abilities as an actor didn't seem to be utilized to their fullest extent. He has done some incredible stuff, but he wasn't really a stand out in this film. I think just about anyone could have played that role and played it about as well as he did. He was fine, but this definitely wasn't Fight Club or American History X.Overall, this is a very entertaining movie. When you find out by watching the special features that almost all of the stunts and chase scenes are real rather than CGI I think pretty much anyone will be amazed at what the makers of this film were able to do. With a fairly solid story and pretty good acting, I'm going to recommend this to action movie fans. The story isn't super-deep and the characters aren't as developed as those from a Kerouac novel, but this is a very enjoyable movie.",4,I liked it; it&#65533;s a pretty good movie,1065571200,"10 8,

Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[0, 2]","When I first heard of this remake, I was sure it was going to be awful, and that it would never live up to the Michael Caine original. As it happens, there's not much living up to do, since it bears so little resemblance to the original that directly comparing the two would make no sense. There are one or two points which can be compared (and I will get to them), but other than that, this film can quite easily be considered by itself.The first comparable point (which is quite minor, really), is the characters. Yes, Mr. Bridger and Charlie Croker have the same names as the original characters, but that is where their similarities end. Please, if you're doing a film with the same title and same character names, make the characters at least similar. The bulk of the film is very enjoyable- a heist is pulled off rather successfully, one partner double crosses the others, and things kick off when the cheated partners go out for revenge. It has casing jobs, safe-cracking, breaking in and a couple of great getaways- all the ingredients of a good heist film.Unfortunately, it has one thing that heist movies do not need- emotional ties. What is it with Hollywood these days that means that every film needs to have some kind of personal reason for things happening? Why couldn't they just make a heist film about a group of thieves trying to steal gold because it's there, rather than because it was taken by someone who killed your dad / friend / brother / favorite poodle? So... the ties are set up, the heist is planned and pulled off, and they make their getaway. This is where the second comparison comes in. The original film featured a very long race through underground shopping centers, down church steps, over roofs, all to avoid a traffic jam. Whilst this new film features cars racing down steps, and through tunnels, it's very obviously a case of ""fans will expect this, so we'll put it in"", as there's very little of it, and it does to some extent seem tacked on.Admittedly, this section of the film did please me a little bit, in that Croker says ""let's do it like The Italian Job"". Although his reference to the characters is referring to the job pulled in the film's opening, it also seemed to be a nod to the original as this section did bear the most similarity to its namesake. Overall, I quite liked The Italian Job. It did have some flaws, but then it had some great moments. I found it very enjoyable to watch, and would advise others to see it.",3,"Good No, Enjoyable Yes",1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,2475,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'remake', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'awful', 'would', 'never', 'live', 'up', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'original', 'not', 'much', 'living', 'up', 'do', 'so', 'little', 'resemblance', 'original', 'directly', 'comparing', 'two', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'points', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'will', 'get', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'quite', 'easily', 'be', 'considered', 'itself.The', 'first', 'comparable', 'point', 'quite', 'minor', 'really', 'characters', 'Yes', 'Mr.', 'Bridger', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'have', 'same', 'names', 'original', 'characters', 'where', 'similarities', 'end', 'Please', ""'re"", 'doing', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'same', 'character', 'names', 'make', 'characters', 'least', 'similar', 'bulk', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable-', 'heist', 'pulled', 'off', 'rather', 'successfully', 'one', 'partner', 'double', 'others', 'things', 'kick', 'off', 'when', 'cheated', 'partners', 'go', 'out', 'revenge', 'casing', 'jobs', 'safe-cracking', 'breaking', 'couple', 'great', 'getaways-', 'ingredients', 'good', 'heist', 'film.Unfortunately', 'one', 'thing', 'heist', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'need-', 'emotional', 'ties', 'What', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'film', 'have', 'kind', 'personal', 'reason', 'things', 'happening', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'heist', 'film', 'group', 'thieves', 'trying', 'steal', 'gold', 'there', 'rather', 'was', 'taken', 'someone', 'who', 'killed', 'dad', '/', 'friend', 'brother', '/', 'favorite', 'poodle', 'So', 'ties', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'heist', 'planned', 'pulled', 'off', 'make', 'getaway', 'where', 'second', 'comparison', 'original', 'film', 'featured', 'very', 'long', 'race', 'underground', 'shopping', 'centers', 'down', 'church', 'steps', 'roofs', 'avoid', 'traffic', 'jam', 'Whilst', 'new', 'film', 'features', 'cars', 'racing', 'down', 'steps', 'tunnels', 'very', 'obviously', 'case', 'fans', 'will', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'put', 'very', 'little', 'extent', 'seem', 'tacked', 'on.Admittedly', 'section', 'film', 'did', 'please', 'little', 'bit', 'Croker', 'let', 'do', 'Italian', 'Job', 'reference', 'characters', 'referring', 'job', 'pulled', 'film', 'opening', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'nod', 'original', 'section', 'did', 'bear', 'most', 'similarity', 'namesake', 'Overall', 'quite', 'liked', 'Italian', 'Job', 'did', 'have', 'flaws', 'then', 'had', 'great', 'moments', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'would', 'advise', 'others', 'see']",N/A
770352,A379SAP75SPDHD,B0000B1OFL,Alec Solomita,"[2, 2]","The Italian Job is a breath of fresh air in a year that has been filled with many dissapointing action pictures and popcorn films. While the summer season has started off great, the winter and spring were filled with mediocre offerings like The Hunted, Basic, and Tears of the Sun. The Italian Job does what those films did not. It takes a plot we've seen many times before, the heist genre, and adds humor, good action scenes and characters that we actually care about to create a very entertaining film. The plot is simple enough: Six thieves complete an amazing heist in Italy, when one of the thieves double cross the rest of the team and takes off with the gold, killing the elder thief and leaving the rest of the tean for dead. The rest of the film revolves around the thieves, aided by the deceased thief's daughter, and their quest for revenge against their former colleague. The action scenes are fast paced and very crisped, and they do a better job of making mini coopers look fun and exciting than The Bourne Identity, another surprise summer hit from last year. The cast is quite good for the most part. Edward Norton was very good as the thief who betrayed the team. He seemed angry and slimy throughout the film. That might have been more about his disdain for having to make the film than his acting, as a contractual oblogation with Paramount forced him to do this film. Charlize Theron did a very good job as a safecracker, who is in the heist to avenge her father's death. Seth Green is very funny as the standard computer geek. Jason Stratham and Mos Def also provide comic relief as bickering partners who function as the driver and the explosives expert. Donald Sutherland puts in a nice performance as the elder thief, as we truly believe his experineces and knowledge. The only actor that I was not pleased with was the film's star, Mark Wahlberg. He comes off as extremely stiff, and his character is the only one without a personality. He's likable because he's the leader and we know he is a good guy, but he had no chemistry with Theron and he is the least memorable character in the film. With that being said, he doesn't ruin the film and the film provides enough action, humor, twists and turns to make it an incredible thrill ride from beginning to end.

That is always nice to see in a movie, a woman with a strong character who actually wers clothes that cover more than just the bare necessities.2. Seth Green makes a great geek. He was born to be a geek.3. It will make you laugh, or at least utter a chuckle from time to time.4. The movie has great action scenes and the plot is interesting.Now on to the negatives:1. Not all of the cast members' acting was up to par (*cough* Wahlberg *cough*). He is nice to look at but good acting that does not make.2. There are dry moments. When the action slows down it may be hard at certain moments to keep you eyes open. Good if you are on a date or need to go to the bathroom.3.

This is one of those films for me.  The plot is nothing short of ridiculous, completely unrealistic and none-to original, but I still can't help but totally adore this movie.  It is fun and exciting and intense, regardless of the predictability of it all.I haven't seen the original (staring the BRILLIANT Michael Caine) but I really should!The film revolves around a group of professional thieves who join forces with the daughter of a respected partner who was murdered and robbed by someone they trusted.  What follows is a slew of preposterous yet highly entertaining sequences of tricks, gadgets and slowly boiling sensual chemistry (Marky Mark and Charlize make a beautiful pair, don't you think?).Wahlberg is a reliable leading man.  He isn't doused with talent like some other actors his age, but he has a likable charm (that whole Brooklyn attitude sits well on him) and he knows how to work a scene.  Charlize Theron has talent (thus the Oscar) but she doesn't really use it in fluff films like this.  She doesn't elevate any of her scenes, but she is gorgeous, which is all this role really required of her.  Edward Norton is the most talented actor here (well, one could debate between him and Sutherland, but la'Donald isn't in more than five minutes of this) and he shows it by oozing a sensual creepiness that makes his irresistible and completely commanding.  That dinner confrontation scene alone is just jaw dropping intensity wrapped up in a dapper little package.The rest of the cast does their job.  Jason Statham is brooding and buff and a total lady killer; Seth Green is comic relief of the nerdy kind; Mos Def is quiet, charming and totally likable.  They work very well.The film is chuck-full of brilliantly paced chase scenes (those ugly little cars have never been so cool), beautifully choreographed action sequences (not to mention beautifully photographed landscapes) and clever tricks that gloss over the plot holes nicely.

Overall, the movie is predictable, but it's still fun watching these thieves do their job.The characters in the film are all cliche but you'll like em anyway. Seth Green's character, Napster (the supposed real inventor of the program) is my favorite. The cast is talented, but their performances feel very boxed in. I attribute this to the MTV video style directing that never lets any performances shine.Possibly the film's biggest flaw is the marketing. If you've seen the trailer to this film, you've seen the movie. I'm not kidding, it's basically a Cliff's Notes of the film. There's not a single surprise in store that the trailer doesn't reveal.

It is also a smart and well-photographed movie that proves the old adage of depending on the use of a great story and then embellishing on it with all the bells and whistles. The plot is as believable as anything can be that posits the existence of people so smart, so devious, and so daring as to be able to do some of the things that are done here. Yet the qualms about believability quickly fade with each nosiy and exciting revving up of the action, which is well choreographed, full of pyrotechnics, and absolutely fresh and new, adding to the charm of the movie.The cast adds immeasurably to the charm of the movie, with Donald Sutherland, Ed Norton, and several notable others lending both credence and a certain gritty feel to this tale about life on the margins, on the far side of the law. I also got the impression that given the box office success of this film; much of the crew may be back to thrill us again in an inevitable sequel. I am up for it. After all, given the aplomb and cool they displayed in driving a trio of Metros through the streets, sewers, and tunnels of Los Angeles at rush hour, and added into this mix was a certain level of style and intelligence often missing in such caper flicks, it would be fun to consider a series of such films.

No big drama, no great life issues; just a fun plot, great action, and good looking people packing the screen. ""The Italian Job"", a remake of the 1969 Michael Caine flick, is cinema escapism at its best and a great bet for a Friday night date.Mark Wahlberg stars as Charlie, acting head of a gang of high-tech, high class thieves. He's taking over for his mentor (played by the always welcome Donald Sutherland) as his team sets up a brilliant scheme for $35,000,000 in gold bars (the ""Italian Job"" of the title).But things don't go quite as planned, and one year later Charlie reassembles his mates, plus his mentor's daughter (Charlize Theron) to take revenge on the man who betrayed them and set things right once and for all.The action here is splendid, imaginative and well filmed. The script is tight, with plenty of snappy lines to go around (including a great running gag about just who invented Napster) and the musical score is surprisingly nice. All the actors have fun with their roles, especially Seth Green as a computer geek and Edward Norton as the slimy bad guy. And of course there's Wahlberg.I like Mark Wahlberg. I can't help it. I like him more with every movie he makes. I like his quiet, confident walk, his little boy smile, and the way his forehead crinkles whenever somebody yells at him. He seems to actually get better looking as the movie goes along, and his chemistry with Theron is low-key but sexy.I give ""The Italian Job"" five stars not because it was a masterpiece, but because I had a great time and know the film will hold up well with future viewings (it was a lot like ""Ocean's Eleven"" in this regard).

Even the talented Norton fails to deliver a notworthy acting performance and computer geek Lyle played by Seth Green steals the show with his performance.The action including an excellent car chase scene featuring a trio of Mini Coopers roaring through gridlocked Los Angeles streets is unrelenting.

Nice cars, nice actors, nice settings, pretty much everything you'd like and want to see in a good movie.  Mark Wahlberg stars as the main character, Charlie Croker, a pro at what he does: stealing.  He's an excellent thief, and the main planner for a crew of theives including, Mos Def, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland.  The opening of the film starts in Venice with a smart heist in process.  When the thieves have gotten what they wanted: 35 million dollars in gold bars, one the theievs (Edward Norton) double-crosses them and makes it off with the gold and kills Sutherland's character in the process.  Wahlberg soon recruits Charlize Theron (Sutherland's daugther) to help get revenge for their mentor and her father and to try and get possession of the gold back.The film's premise is simple but cleverly done.  I for one never knew being thief could require so much dedication and devotion.  The main highlight of this film is the climax: the car chase involving those beloved mini-coopers.  I don't think this film had the best car chase considering there were other films with a lot better chases including T3:Rise of the Machines, Bad Boys II and The Matrix Reloaded.  Though it is pretty good and worthwhile.  I luckily got to see this on the big screen and it actually is worth it.

Get together an interesting, big name cast and assign them each a specialization.  Launch this talented group of individuals into a world of immense action and crime in which the cops and authority seem to hold no place-the battle is purely between the ""good"" bad guys and the ""bad"" bad guys.  I enjoyed this film, but not as much as ""Ocean's Eleven"" or even ""Sneakers""-another film with a somewhat similar premise.Although I don't think I'm as harsh as some others have commented, I wasn't particularly impressed with the acting in this film.  I was expecting more from Edward Norton, but perhaps the role just didn't allow for anything.  The action sequences in this film are good and I was particularly impressed with the helicopter scene-the flying is incredibly difficult to pull off and, as the special features inform us, was not added with computer graphics.  The special features on this disc are not anything special.  I watched all of the little short documentaries on the various aspects of the film.  While they are interesting and provide some insight into the making of the film, there really isn't a whole lot to say about a pure action film.While it's not as good as ""Ocean's Eleven,"" the film is still worth a look if you're interested in those types of movies.

As most film fans will know the original movie concluded with the gang of bullion thieves stuck in a rather precarious situation atop one of the Italian Alps. The remake however includes the actual ""Italian Job"" of the title at the beginning of its movie and then weaves a tale of betrayal and payback that has one of the thieves double-crossing his partners and taking off with the gold himself.In this respect the movie probably would have been better off not adopting the name of its illustrious predecessor. In fact, in talks with the director to promote this movie, it was revealed that Italian authorities were less than happy to hear that Hollywood planned to remake a movie - that is such a ""national treasure"" in the hearts of Italy - that they almost refused the team to film in Venice. Only when they were able to convince the Italians that it was a homage and that they intended no disrespect to the original that they were allowed to continue.Fans of another remake (Ocean's Eleven) will no doubt lap this movie up. This production has another hip cast and the same slick method of storytelling. It was pleasing to see the return of the Morris Minor car as one of the holdovers from the original movie and I thought Charlize Theron was a welcome addition to the cast as the beautiful daughter of one of the original thieves. What was most disturbing though was the fact that the original Italian Job was an eclectic collection of British thieves, whereas here they are American - not sure why they made that change since the humor employed in the original was so British.Still, as heist movies go this film is a success and a lot of fun.

That said this is not a remake, the story is totally different and the italian connection is shakey, more a distant excuse to use the same name.The similarity is in the genre, the style of humor which is the spirit of the movie and the real stars of the film - thirty four Mini Coopers which are glorious.The action scenes which are excellent, are made even better somehow by the fact the cast performed the vast majority of the stunts themselves.  The scenes featuring the Mini Coopers (the modern version of the cars used in the original movie)and the armoured car were incredible.  As an aside there were also a couple of scenes featuring an original mini cooper as used in the original movie, the contrast in the modern and classic versions is quite striking.The cast are all very good, my particular favorites being Seth Green for being brilliantly funny, Jason Statham for pure cool and Edward Norton the villan for being the best actor by far.  Oh and don't forget Charlize Theron for being many things and all of them great.Overall this is a fun exciting action movie with a lot of  laughs thrown in, overall for most people including me that is a pretty attractive package.I would also recommend watching the original 1969 version, it still stands up as a movie well worth watching.",5,Remake that's not a Remake,1068163200,"11 7, 2003",2003,1416,"['2003', 'Italian', 'Job', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'combining', 'great', 'action', 'good', 'cast', 'really', 'witty', 'lines', 'said', 'not', 'remake', 'story', 'totally', 'different', 'italian', 'connection', 'shakey', 'more', 'distant', 'excuse', 'use', 'same', 'name.The', 'similarity', 'genre', 'style', 'humor', 'spirit', 'movie', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'thirty', 'four', 'Mini', 'Coopers', 'are', 'glorious.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'somehow', 'fact', 'cast', 'performed', 'vast', 'majority', 'stunts', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Mini', 'Coopers', 'modern', 'version', 'cars', 'used', 'original', 'movie', 'armoured', 'car', 'were', 'incredible', 'aside', 'were', 'also', 'couple', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'original', 'mini', 'cooper', 'used', 'original', 'movie', 'contrast', 'modern', 'classic', 'versions', 'quite', 'striking.The', 'cast', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'particular', 'favorites', 'being', 'Seth', 'Green', 'being', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'pure', 'cool', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'villan', 'being', 'best', 'actor', 'far', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'being', 'many', 'things', 'great.Overall', 'fun', 'exciting', 'action', 'movie', 'lot', 'laughs', 'thrown', 'overall', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'pretty', 'attractive', 'package.I', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'watching', 'original', '1969', 'version', 'still', 'up', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

While you do not approve of their actions, it is nevertheless satisfying to watch the bad guy get his comeuppance.

Characterization is good--each one stands out.  Good humor.  Fast pace.  It is a nice remake of the 1969 original, paying tribute to its predecessor without duplicating it outright.The blu-ray transfer was okay but not great.  Outdoor daytime scenes had remarkable detail and little film grain.  The same cannot be said for indoor or nighttime shots, however, which demonstrated considerable film grain.  The colors were muted just a bit overall, and the sound was not strong--I had to crank up the volume a few notches, which helped.  Not the worst blu-ray I have ever seen, but not the best either.Parental Advisory: The movie is rated PG-13 for language and some violence.  There are a couple of scenes featuring women who could have used more covering, but this was relatively tame by Hollywood standards.This is an entertaining heist film that is worth watching.

Anyway if you're familiar with the Michael Caine original than you'll even enjoy this revisionist remake of the '70s film. Wahlberg makes a fine hero, Theron is nice to look at and Edward Norton is a lot of fun as the villain you'd love to hate.  If you liked ""Oceans 11"" then you'll enjoy this.  I've knocked one star for the video quality of this in HD but the price of this in HD DVD versus the Blu-ray is so obscenely low that it definitely ranks as a best buy.  Like would you pay $5 or $6 for this disc in HD or close to $20 in Blu-ray--go figure.

Gary Gray redeems himself with this slick hesit film. The problem with Gray's last film was the script and given the right material Gray shows his talent as a director , hence his work in his previous films The Negotiator and Set It Off. The Italian Job sharp and witty written by Donna & Wayne Powers is a huge improvement over the previous film Valentine, the Powers duo get great performances out of everyone in the cast from the star Mark Wahlberg to Franky G. Walhberg and his team which consit of Mos Def, Seth Green and Jason Statham decide to reccuit Charlize Theron to bring the evil Ed Norton. The trailer pretty much gives away the plot of the film so I won't ruin it here but the film is a lot of fun and considering the lack of gun battle violence that's really suprising. Seth Green and Mos Def are real scene stealers as always and Wahlberg has great chemistry with everyone in the cast.

770427,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B0000B1OFL,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[0, 1]","'The Italian Job' starts off in Venice, Italy.  A team of thieves, lead by Charlie Croker, played by Mark Wahlberg, steal about $35 million in gold.  Charlie has taken over as the leader of this gang of thieves from John Bridger, played by Donald Sutherland.  John is an 'old-school' safe cracker.  On their way out of Italy, one member of the crew, Steve (played by Ed Norton), betrays the rest of the crew, shoots John, steals the gold, and leaves the rest for dead.  A year later, Charlie finds him, rounds up the crew, and hires John's reluctant daughter, played by Charlize Theron, to help them steal the gold back and get even.This movie is fun.  There are some great action scenes that are becoming somewhat famous involving a trio of Mini Coopers.  The cast is rounded out by Jason Statham (as handsome Rob), Seth Green (Napster), and Mos Def (Left Ear).  The entire cast plays off each other very well, and they all look like they had fun doing this movie.  Green has a great scene where he mimics Statham as his character picks up a blonde.  Each of the characters is given just enough back story to be fleshed out without going too deep.The DVD contains a fair amount of extras.  There is a featurette about the movie itself, which is decent.  The most fun extra is the documentary on how the cast was taught to drive the minis.  It looks like they got a little competitive.  There are also some deleted scenes that will satisfy DVD die hards.Overall, I'd recommend this film to almost anyone.  Parts of the movie are predictable, and the actual heist is a little light on suspense, but its a fun movie.  I haven't seen the original, so I can't offer a comparison.

The result is 2003's ""The Italian Job"", a fast-paced and enjoyable action thriller.The movie opens with an elaborately-planned heist in Venice, Italy.  A crack crew of thieves goes to Mission: Impossible-like lengths to extract a fortune in gold from a canal-side mansion and escape to the Italian Alps.  There, one of the crew (Edward Norton as a slick and selfish bad guy) betrays the rest, killing the aging master thief (cameo by Donald Sutherland), stealing the gold, and scattering the crew.Fast forward a year.  Charlie Croker, the master thief's protege (played with cool precision by Mark Wahlberg), locates the traitor, living in a fortress mansion in Los Angeles.  He reassembles the team to steal the gold back.  This effort is the heart of the film, as Charlie's team plots their entrance into the mansion and their escape afterward.  The highlight of the movie is a nail-biting chase across Los Angeles, with Charlie's team in specially modified Mini-Coopers and their former teammate in hot pursuit by helicopter.  A tense final confrontation at the Los Angeles train station reveals a few final plot twists.Charlize Theron does an excellent turn as Croker's safe-cracking love interest.  Seth Green is the team's computer whiz and comic relief.  Jason Statham is the team's hunky automotive expert.

A True Babe---in Charlize Theron, who is not only blonde but actually beautiful in a unique way (most Hollywood blondes are blandly homogenous) and can actually act.  Marvelous eye candy.2.  Somewhat interesting characters---the computer nerd is pretty stock, but the others are somewhat original, esp. Handsome Rob, who's just hilarious.3.  Somewhat original action scenes---how they dislodge the safe in Venice, and then the armored car in L.A., was rather neat.4.  Unusual choice of Cool Car---I'd expect Porsches, BMWs, Ferraris...but never the Mini-Cooper, which looks the Communist-era East German Trabant, a little box on wheels.5.  Competent dialogue---most action flicks are full of clunky, hackneyed lines that just make you feel sorry for the poor actors who have to deliver them with a straight face.  This screenplay in contrast seems to have been written by actual junior high school graduates.Now my dislikes:1.  Plot gets more than a little unbelievable towards the end---namely, why didn't our heroes just as easily wack Edward Norton's character themselves at the end, instead of paying off the Russian mob a huge chunk of loot to do it for them?2.  Why does Charlize Theron get to keep her clothes on in this movie?  What a crying shame, especially considering she didn't in &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; which was geared to far less of a predominantly male audience.  Wait...could it be the PG-13 rating, which would allow in a lot more prepubescent moviegoers?3.  Cheesy product placement.

770444,A4FAPQKQQLJY1,B0000B1OFL,Elite,"[0, 0]","Making a remake of an older film is not an easy task. You don't want to just rehash everything from the original, but you don't want to spit in the face of it either. I think this is a very good remake and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Like other reviews have said, it is very predictable and at some points you have to leave your brain at the door. But when I go to a movie, I am mostly concerned about one thing.....is the movie entertaining enough to justify the money I am paying to see it? In that way, this flick definately delivers.The story is about a group of thieves who steal a bunch of gold and one of the guys in the group double crosses the rest and leaves them for dead. Years later, they find the traitor and aim at stealing the gold back from him.Obviously this is not a complicated plot. The story itself isn't deep and overly engaging, but it just keeps you interested enough to like all the characters in the film. The movie is cast very well. Mark Wahlberg plays the lead actor and he is pretty good. It is impressive to see how far he has come since his early days of acting. Not that he is the next DeNiro, but I am at least happy he got rid of that ""hip-hop"" accent of his. Charlize Theron is also quite good. Sure she is mostly here for the eye candy and this role doesn't make her flex her acting muscles much, but I enjoyed her in the role.Edward Norton (who is one of my two favorite actors of this generation. Johnny Depp being the other) plays the baguy here. Don't worry I am not ruining any plotlines for you by telling you that. Just watch the trailer and you would figure it out. I do like him as the villain here and I wish I could see him in more of these roles. He doesn't play it over the top, and he definately gets you to dislike his character. Donald Sutherland is underused here, but good as usual. The rest of the characters are here for humor and some other great moments. Mos Def, Seth Green, and one of my favorites, Jason Statham play their roles perfectly and provide most of the levity in the film. Overall the acting was quite good.Basically this movie isn't going to win any awards, but it's a great ""sit on the couch and entertain me"" movie. I like how it was shot. The music was good. The acting was great. F. Gary Gray did a good job directing it. The writing was slick. It's just a good, but not great movie. Just don't go into it expecting to see a rehash of the original film. You will not get what you expected, for better or worse.Special Features: There is plenty to like in the special features as well. There is a making of documentary. It's not as bad as most ""everyone kisses everyone else's butt"" type of featurette and is watchable. A little featurette showing the actors learning to drive the Mini's was entertaining. There is also a featurette just on the Mini's themselves. 6 deleted scenes, the trailer, and a featurette about the stunts in the film round out the package.",4,"A very good, but predictable movie........",1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,2938,"['Making', 'remake', 'older', 'film', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'just', 'rehash', 'everything', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spit', 'face', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'remake', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'very', 'predictable', 'points', 'have', 'leave', 'brain', 'door', 'when', 'go', 'movie', 'am', 'mostly', 'concerned', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'justify', 'money', 'am', 'paying', 'see', 'way', 'flick', 'definately', 'delivers.The', 'story', 'group', 'thieves', 'who', 'steal', 'bunch', 'gold', 'one', 'guys', 'group', 'double', 'rest', 'dead', 'Years', 'later', 'find', 'traitor', 'aim', 'stealing', 'gold', 'back', 'him.Obviously', 'not', 'complicated', 'plot', 'story', ""n't"", 'deep', 'overly', 'engaging', 'just', 'interested', 'enough', 'like', 'characters', 'film', 'movie', 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'lead', 'actor', 'pretty', 'good', 'impressive', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'come', 'early', 'days', 'acting', 'Not', 'next', 'DeNiro', 'am', 'least', 'happy', 'got', 'rid', 'hip-hop', 'accent', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Sure', 'mostly', 'here', 'eye', 'candy', 'role', ""n't"", 'make', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscles', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'role.Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'one', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'generation', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'being', 'other', 'baguy', 'here', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'am', 'not', 'ruining', 'plotlines', 'telling', 'Just', 'watch', 'trailer', 'would', 'figure', 'out', 'do', 'like', 'villain', 'here', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'roles', ""n't"", 'play', 'top', 'definately', 'dislike', 'character', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'underused', 'here', 'good', 'usual', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'humor', 'other', 'great', 'moments', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Seth', 'Green', 'one', 'favorites', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'play', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'provide', 'most', 'levity', 'film', 'Overall', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good.Basically', 'movie', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'great', 'sit', 'couch', 'entertain', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'shot', 'music', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'directing', 'writing', 'was', 'slick', 'just', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'see', 'rehash', 'original', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'what', 'expected', 'better', 'worse.Special', 'Features', 'plenty', 'like', 'special', 'features', 'well', 'making', 'documentary', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'else', 'butt', 'type', 'featurette', 'watchable', 'little', 'featurette', 'showing', 'actors', 'learning', 'drive', 'Mini', 'was', 'entertaining', 'also', 'featurette', 'just', 'Mini', '6', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'featurette', 'stunts', 'film', 'round', 'package']",N/A

The cast is electrically charged without that all too familiar over-the-top push.

770468,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0000B1OFL,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","As do-overs of Michael Caine pictures go, 2003's THE ITALIAN JOB, in my eyes, easily torpedoes the GET CARTER and ALFIE remakes. There's not much that this version has in common with the 1969 original, other than that both films showcase them cute, tiny Mini-Coopers (if you can't find parking, you could just pick them up, put them in your pocket). Mark Wahlberg isn't one of those demonstrative actors, he's from that strong silent mold of heroes. So, whether understated or merely bland - I'm not sure which - Wahlberg is likable and he provides the grounding element. THE ITALIAN JOB is fast-paced and stylish and clever, and the revenge sub-plot is always a good draw to pull in an audience. But what really makes this movie is the swaggering, irresistible cast supporting Wahlberg.The film kicks off at a stately mansion sitting over a canal in Venice, Italy as master planner Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) and his crew of specialists successfully pull off a heist of 35 million dollars in gold bullion. But as someone not that famous once said: ""No battle plan has ever survived first contact with the enemy."" Steve (a slimy Edward Norton) is Charlie's inside man and, it turns out, Steve is the dirtiest scoundrel of the bunch, and the greediest. He double crosses the team and murders Charlie's savvy old mentor (Donald Sutherland) and tries to kill everyone else. Steve walks away, alters his identity and moves to L.A., believing that everyone's dead. He keeps on believing this for one year. After which time Charlie finally locates him. And then you just sit back and soak in the gratifying bit of vengeance as it plays out.This is the movies, so I guess there's a suspension of disbelief involved when Charlize Theron is introduced as Estella Bridger, a gifted safecracker who freelances for police agencies. She gets recruited by Charlie Croker in his revenge plot against Steve, and it's personal for Estella because Charlie's murdered mentor also happens to be her father. This is one of those roles that's real easy to coast on, and yet Theron manages to demonstrate equal doses of emotional vulnerability and steeliness. She's also an absolutely sick driver which endears her to me even more. She and the rest of Mark Wahlberg's crew easily sell the movie for me. Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) is the hunky Cockney-talking wheel man. Left Ear (Mos Def, fabulously laid back) is the demolitions expert. Lyle (Seth Green) is the geeky computer tech and is the film's funniest character. Lyle claims that he invented Napster, which his college roommate Shawn Fanning stole while Lyle was, in fact, napping. Seth Green gets the lion's share of the funny lines (""You'll never shut down the real Napster."").There are some alarmingly fun, snazzy bits in this flick. Watching the actors zip around in their souped-up, tricked-out Mini-Coopers, I admit to a moment in which I contemplated getting me my own Mini. I absolutely cracked up during Seth Green's Napster bits and his improvisational impersonation of Handsome Rob. And then the hi-tech stuff, from gaining control of the stop lights to figuring out which of the decoy trucks is the real deal. As always, a huge part of enjoying the caper genre is in watching the plan coming together and then the execution of it. And then, because we anticipate the plan somehow going squirrely - it always does - we wonder how our guys will get themselves out of whatever scrape. And scrapes are guaranteed once the film throws in a scary Ukrainian mob boss and a massive Samoan who tends to tell his lady friend to ""Baby, go relax."" whenever he wants to get rid of her. As expected, Charlie Croker manages to work around these highly dangerous characters. THE ITALIAN JOB, I wouldn't call it a strikingly original heist thriller. But going by the huge appeal and chemistry of the cast, time will fly by even faster than those Mini-Coopers. Plus, it's hard to pass up a chance to ogle Charlize Theron. Can't wait for THE BRAZILIAN JOB, whenever that comes out.This is the Special Collector's Edition and the DVD's bonus features are: ""Pedal to the Metal: The Making of THE ITALIAN JOB"" (00:18:16 minutes);

From Venice to Los Angeles, from gondolas to cars, from canals to overstuffed streets, etc. The interest is not so much in the action which is simple and well dynamized by a good rhythm. Not so much in the plot and the suspense because we all know from the very start that justice will prevail, I mean that the first robbers will recuperate their gold no matter what. The interest of the film is in the details of the action. It all revolves around the use of hightechnology in city managing (here the traffic and the subway) and in security systems (here safes and the tools to break them without explosives). But once again this does not create any suspense because we know this hightechnology will not fail, except on order and command. The second interest is in the characters. They are simple and their psychologies are also very simple, but less simple than we could have feared. Hence they have some simple depth nearly like real human beings. A father who is absent, a father figure who is looming high and a man who comes into the slot and becomes the absent father who is no father any more but just a plain and desired male lover. This needs two rather good actors to imply and impersonate this situation in simple face expression and body language. The camera does the rest. In other words a good entertaining experience.

Make a double batch of popcorn and settle in for a rollicking movie ride! The producers could have lost the script and speaking parts altogether - the action alone, along with the wicked sound track, would make many folks very happy. This tongue-in-cheek, super burglary, double-cross, murder, revenge thriller includes the grandmother and the mother of all chase scenes. There's a wild boat ride through the canals of Venice, and even wilder car chases, with the grand finale roaring through a Los Angeles train station, into tunnels, down stairs, with a wind-up duel between a Mini-Cooper and a helicopter. Charlize Theron looks svelte and sexy behind the wheel! If you are looking for a more cerebral film, then I'd advise you to rent something on the quieter side.Donald Sutherland is terrific in a cameo as John Bridger, the sage guru among a band of hi-tech thieves plotting to steal millions in gold bullion from a safe in beautiful Venice. (Great photography!!) Bridger's protege, the outfit's mastermind, Charlie Croker, (played by Mark Wahlberg), along with his team, pull-off the heist without a hitch. After a spectacular get-away, the group drinks to success and future plans as wealthy men against the backdrop of the Swiss Alps. Then in the first twist, and there are more twists, turns, hitches and hikes in this one than in any amusement park ride, the evil-doing, back-stabbing, amoral Steve, (Ed Norton), turns on his fellow thieves. He heists the heist, murdering Bridger, and he believes, the rest of his mates.Fast-forward one year and we find Bridger's daughter Stella, (Charlize Theron), a professional safe and vault technician (read safecracker), still mourning her Dad. Enter Dad's favorite sidekick, Charlie Croker, who proposes a plan for revenge to Stella. She buys in, along with old team members Napster, (Seth Green, who steals scene after scene), Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), and Left Ear (Mos Def) - very funny characters, all! They trek out to LA, where Steve has a new alias, high-end digs, guard dogs and body guards galore...and the GOLD! And they plan their ultimate payback!I am not going to critique the acting or direction - I don't think this is what the film is about. There is nothing deep or meaningful here. It's just FUN! I am not a fan of action films. Chases, car and other, minimal acting and small plots are not my style - and I liked this movie! So, go know!?

John Bridger, a master safecracker, is about to pull the last job of his career.  Only this time he isn&#65533;t running the show, that responsibility has been passed on to his successor Charlie Crocker, the mastermind behind the whole scheme.  Everything goes according to plan, until one of them decides to doublecross the rest of the group.  Now, a year after that unfortunate incident, Charlie finally locates the traitor&#65533;s trail.  He enlists the help of John&#65533;s daughter Stella, who happens to be an expert of safes and locks herself.  Together with his former cohorts, they will attempt to reclaim what is rightfully theirs&#65533;, as well as exact revenge the person that betrayed them.Admittedly the plot of The Italian Job follows the same set up as most caper films: a crew get together, then comes the obligatory introduction of the important players, with the explanation, the preparation and finally the completion of the heist.  Despite the formulaic scenario, director Gray&#65533;s execution was so energetic and thrilling that such contrivance can be easily overlooked.  There were a couple of story elements that were never fully explained to my satisfaction.  Even so, these irritations did not dampen my enjoyment for the film.&#65533;There are two kinds of thieves in the world: ones that steal to enrich their lives, and ones that steal to define their lives.&#65533;Mark Wahlberg is likeable enough as the main character Charlie, but lacks the charisma to carry the movie himself.  Luckily, the rest of the cast was more than capable of picking up the slack.  Charlize Theron exudes confidence and a kind of recklessness in the role of Stella Bridger; her charm is unmistakable here.  Edward Norton, on the other hand, seems to lack his usual intensity playing the villainous Steve.  Seth Green is again relegated to be the token wise-cracker, don&#65533;t get me wrong, the guy is funny and does a good job as the computer wizard Lyle, but I think he is capable of much more than just the comedy relief.  Jason Statham is dynamic as Handsome Rob, and Mos Def&#65533;s Left-Ear is quirky.  It is a shame that Donald Sutherland&#65533;s part is so small, even though his character, John Bridger, is an important aspect of the story.  I confess that for most of the film I was dreading the cliched romance between the two leads that is usually found in these movies, and to my surprise the writers never resorted to it.

770496,A1PNNR3B9H8GTC,B0000B1OFL,Jeremy Berman,"[0, 3]","The Italian Job has all the ingredients of a slick, stirring action adventure. Based on the classic 1969 caper of the same name, the film places an emphasis on the dazzling car chases, intricate gadgetry, and high-octane explosions that routinely stimulate moviegoers. The provocative story (concerning the efforts of a group of high-tech thieves to steal the gold of a treacherous former comrade) provides director F. Gary Gray ample opportunity to delve into the intriguing themes of vengeance, greed and moral bankruptcy. Even the Los Angeles setting grants the movie a glitzy mysteriousness that seems to promise grand excitement and clever invention.Unfortunately, these potentially glorious elements never come together to form the excellent movie that The Italian Job should have been. The blame rests primarily on screenwriters Donna and Wayne Powers, who frequently leave their characters hunched over computers discussing strategies or sitting in hotel rooms and restaurants telling ridiculous stories about themselves. Consequently, the momentum of the film frequently stalls and very little heisting actually gets accomplished. Also troublesome is the casting of lead actors who fail to instill their characters with the intensity and liveliness they need to be effective fictional creations. Mark Wahlberg is particularly disappointing as Charlie Croker, the leader and mastermind of the thieve group. Charlie is supposed to exude wily cunning and repressed rage as he plots against his enemies, but Wahlberg can barely muster the energy to squint his eyes at those he doesn't like. Charlize Theron looks equally bored as resident safecracker Stella Bridger, often fighting sleep as her character confronts personal tragedy and physical challenges. Most surprising is the mediocre performance of Edward Norton as Charlie's nemesis, the diabolical Steve Frezelli. Norton is one of the most versatile and charismatic actors currently working in Hollywood, but he fails to supply Frezelli with a single quirk or nuance that might render him more than a typical screeching villain.Despite these considerable flaws, The Italian Job is not without its human charms. Seth Green, Jason Stathem and Mos Def all turn in humorous and stylized performances as the other members of Charlie's gang, and the touching cameo appearance by Donald Sutherland as an aging safebreaker might be worth the price of admission alone. But at almost $9.00 per ticket, even Donald would understand if someone went elsewhere for more thoroughly satisfying entertainment.",2,"Almost, but Not Quite",1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,2554,"['Italian', 'Job', 'ingredients', 'slick', 'stirring', 'action', 'adventure', 'Based', 'classic', '1969', 'caper', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'emphasis', 'dazzling', 'car', 'chases', 'intricate', 'gadgetry', 'high-octane', 'explosions', 'routinely', 'stimulate', 'moviegoers', 'provocative', 'story', 'concerning', 'efforts', 'group', 'high-tech', 'thieves', 'steal', 'gold', 'treacherous', 'former', 'comrade', 'director', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'delve', 'intriguing', 'themes', 'vengeance', 'greed', 'moral', 'bankruptcy', 'Even', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'setting', 'grants', 'movie', 'glitzy', 'mysteriousness', 'promise', 'grand', 'excitement', 'clever', 'invention.Unfortunately', 'potentially', 'glorious', 'elements', 'never', 'come', 'together', 'form', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Italian', 'Job', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'blame', 'primarily', 'screenwriters', 'Donna', 'Wayne', 'Powers', 'who', 'frequently', 'leave', 'characters', 'hunched', 'computers', 'discussing', 'strategies', 'sitting', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'restaurants', 'telling', 'ridiculous', 'stories', 'Consequently', 'momentum', 'film', 'frequently', 'very', 'little', 'heisting', 'actually', 'accomplished', 'Also', 'troublesome', 'casting', 'lead', 'actors', 'who', 'fail', 'instill', 'characters', 'intensity', 'liveliness', 'need', 'be', 'effective', 'fictional', 'creations', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'leader', 'mastermind', 'thieve', 'group', 'Charlie', 'supposed', 'exude', 'wily', 'cunning', 'repressed', 'rage', 'enemies', 'Wahlberg', 'can', 'barely', 'muster', 'energy', 'squint', 'eyes', ""n't"", 'like', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'equally', 'bored', 'resident', 'safecracker', 'Stella', 'Bridger', 'often', 'fighting', 'sleep', 'character', 'confronts', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'physical', 'challenges', 'Most', 'surprising', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Charlie', 'nemesis', 'diabolical', 'Steve', 'Frezelli', 'Norton', 'one', 'most', 'versatile', 'charismatic', 'actors', 'currently', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'supply', 'Frezelli', 'single', 'quirk', 'nuance', 'might', 'render', 'more', 'typical', 'screeching', 'considerable', 'flaws', 'Italian', 'Job', 'not', 'human', 'charms', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Jason', 'Stathem', 'Mos', 'Def', 'turn', 'humorous', 'stylized', 'performances', 'other', 'members', 'Charlie', 'gang', 'touching', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'aging', 'safebreaker', 'might', 'be', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'almost', '9.00', 'ticket', 'even', 'Donald', 'would', 'understand', 'someone', 'went', 'elsewhere', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'satisfying', 'entertainment']",N/A

770503,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0000B1OFL,Joe Sherry,"[1, 2]","A film by F. Gary GrayI didn't think much of this movie from watching the trailer.  It looked a little cheap and cheesy and I didn't expect it to be remotely worth watching.  Then it started to make money and I started hearing positive word of mouth reports about the movie.  It became one of those ""sleeper"" hits that nobody expected, least of all me.  After all of the positive word on this movie, I gave it a shot.  Happily, I can report that the movie is actually quite good.The movie opens in the midst of a heist.  Charlie (Mark Whalberg) is the leader of the group pulling off this heist.  It is audacious (stealing quite a bit of gold bricks) and it is creative in how it is pulled off.  It ends with a nice chase sequence and naturally they get away with it.  I'm not giving anything away.  Just when they've gotten away with it, one of the members of the group pulls a double cross.  Steve (Edward Norton) had his own plan in place to take the gold for himself, and he kills one member and gets away with it.  Again, I'm not spoiling the movie, I'm setting it up.  This is all exposition.The main story comes some time after this.  Charlie finds out where Steve is living (in extravagant wealth), and he pulls together the old crew to rob Steve of the gold that Steve stole from the crew.  They add Stella (Charlize Theron) to the crew (for reasons that I'm not quite prepared to spoil) and plan the new heist.  There is some suspense and interesting gadgets, until it is time for the heist.  This is when things really pick up and we get to the point of the whole movie: the chase.The simple fact is that is movie is a lot of fun.  It is very fast paced, and is like a quick reading novel.  It moves fast, keeps you interested, and gives a satisfying conclusion.  The acting is fine for what it is, and this is a stylish movie.  This movie will never win any major awards, but it doesn't have to.  It's better than most typical summer movies, and I would definitely recommend it.The Italian Job co-stars Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, and Jason Statham.",4,"a lot of fun, one of the better summer movies.",1069286400,"11 20, 2003",2003,2064,"['film', 'F.', 'Gary', 'GrayI', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'movie', 'watching', 'trailer', 'looked', 'little', 'cheap', 'cheesy', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'remotely', 'worth', 'watching', 'Then', 'started', 'make', 'money', 'started', 'hearing', 'positive', 'word', 'mouth', 'reports', 'movie', 'became', 'one', 'sleeper', 'hits', 'nobody', 'expected', 'least', 'positive', 'word', 'movie', 'gave', 'shot', 'Happily', 'can', 'report', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'good.The', 'movie', 'midst', 'heist', 'Charlie', 'Mark', 'Whalberg', 'leader', 'group', 'pulling', 'off', 'heist', 'audacious', 'stealing', 'quite', 'bit', 'gold', 'bricks', 'creative', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'nice', 'chase', 'sequence', 'naturally', 'get', 'away', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'Just', 'when', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'away', 'one', 'members', 'group', 'double', 'cross', 'Steve', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'had', 'own', 'plan', 'place', 'take', 'gold', 'one', 'member', 'away', 'Again', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'movie', ""'m"", 'setting', 'up', 'exposition.The', 'main', 'story', 'time', 'Charlie', 'out', 'where', 'Steve', 'living', 'extravagant', 'wealth', 'together', 'old', 'crew', 'rob', 'Steve', 'gold', 'Steve', 'stole', 'crew', 'add', 'Stella', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'crew', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'prepared', 'spoil', 'plan', 'new', 'heist', 'suspense', 'interesting', 'gadgets', 'time', 'heist', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'pick', 'up', 'get', 'point', 'whole', 'movie', 'chase.The', 'simple', 'fact', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'quick', 'reading', 'novel', 'fast', 'interested', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'acting', 'fine', 'what', 'stylish', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'win', 'major', 'awards', ""n't"", 'have', 'better', 'most', 'typical', 'summer', 'movies', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'Italian', 'Job', 'co-stars', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Jason', 'Statham']",N/A

The story is still somewhat the same though. In Venice, Italy, a team of expert thieves pulls a daring heist of 35 million dollars in bars of gold. One of the thieves betrays his companions and swipes the gold for himself. One year later, in Los Angeles, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitorI was truly entertained with this movie because it kept on going the entire time, there was never really a break in the action and that is what I liked about it. The scene with the Mini Coopers has to be seen to be believed because it is truly something spectacular.Jason Statham, Seth Green and Donald Sutherland are all extremely funny in their roles and the constant bickering going on between some of the characters is worth watching the movie alone, truly funny stuff. Whereas some of the other provide more comic relief Charlize Theron, Edward Norton and Wahlberg provide a more serious aspect.All in all this a movie that will keep you entertained for the entire duration, it has humor, action and everything else you would expect from the sort of movie you simply watch to enjoy yourself, not to think too much.

I found this movie to be quite entertaining from the opening scene all the way to the closing scene which is a bit unusual for these types of movies.Mark Wahlberg has certainly come into his own as a superstar and he quite well proves it with his performance in this movie.  The ever beautiful and alluring Charlize Theron stars and performs quite admirably in this movie.  The supporting cast of Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, Franky G and a brief but poignant performance by Donald Sutherland all of which deserve high praise for their collective performances which combined, all bring this movie to a new height.Director, F. Gary Gray also deserves praise for bringing this great heist/caper movie to fruition and putting together such a wonderful cast.  The score for this film perfectly enhances the overall feel of the movie.The Premise:Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) has planned the perfect heist and carried it out perfectly with his crew as they go to Italy to steal millions of dollars worth of gold bricks.  The one thing he didn't plan for was being double crossed by a member of his crew, Steve (Edward Norton).  As part of his plan in double crossing Charlie and the rest of the crew, Steve kills Charlie's mentor and Stella's (Charlize Theron) father, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), but fails to kill Charlie and the rest of the crew as he thought he did.What follows from there is a very intelligently written and played out heist/caper movie as Charlie finds Steve once again and enlists the aid of Stella in regaining the gold that they'd stolen.I highly recommend this movie as it is one of the better and most enjoyable movies of its type.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Pedal to the Metal:  The Making of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;-Putting the Words on the Page for &quot;The Italian Job&quot;-&quot;The Italian Job&quot; - Driving School-The Mighty Minis of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;-High Octane:  Stunts From &quot;The Italian Job&quot;-6 Deleted Scenes-Theatrical Trailer",4,The Italian Job - A very good heist/caper movie!,1072051200,"12 22, 2003",2003,2144,"['quot', 'Italian', 'Job', 'quot', 'good', 'fun', 'intelligent', 'quot', 'heist', 'quot', 'type', 'movie', 'predicated', 'revenge', 'factor', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'opening', 'scene', 'way', 'closing', 'scene', 'bit', 'unusual', 'types', 'movies.Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'certainly', 'come', 'own', 'superstar', 'quite', 'well', 'performance', 'movie', 'ever', 'beautiful', 'alluring', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'stars', 'performs', 'quite', 'admirably', 'movie', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Franky', 'G', 'brief', 'poignant', 'performance', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'deserve', 'high', 'praise', 'collective', 'performances', 'combined', 'bring', 'movie', 'new', 'height.Director', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'also', 'praise', 'bringing', 'great', 'heist/caper', 'movie', 'fruition', 'putting', 'together', 'such', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'score', 'film', 'perfectly', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie.The', 'Premise', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'planned', 'perfect', 'heist', 'carried', 'out', 'perfectly', 'crew', 'go', 'Italy', 'steal', 'millions', 'dollars', 'gold', 'bricks', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'was', 'being', 'double', 'crossed', 'member', 'crew', 'Steve', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'part', 'plan', 'double', 'crossing', 'Charlie', 'rest', 'crew', 'Steve', 'Charlie', 'mentor', 'Stella', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'father', 'John', 'Bridger', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'kill', 'Charlie', 'rest', 'crew', 'thought', 'very', 'intelligently', 'written', 'played', 'out', 'heist/caper', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'Steve', 'once', 'again', 'aid', 'Stella', 'regaining', 'gold', ""'d"", 'stolen.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'type', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Pedal', 'Metal', 'Making', 'quot', 'Italian', 'Job', 'quot', '-Putting', 'Words', 'Page', 'quot', 'Italian', 'Job', 'quot', 'quot', 'Italian', 'Job', 'quot', 'Driving', 'School-The', 'Mighty', 'Minis', 'quot', 'Italian', 'Job', 'quot', '-High', 'Octane', 'Stunts', 'quot', 'Italian', 'Job', 'quot', 'Deleted', 'Scenes-Theatrical', 'Trailer']",N/A

Several times the caveat 'it's not about the money' is repeated, which is important lest we forget that these are honorable thieves, not, well, dishonorable thieves. Reminds me of the old legal axiom, ""when the lawyers tell you it's not about the money it's about the principle . . . . it's about the money."" I mean Hell. It's 35 million dollars!Anyhow, ""The Italian Job"" has Theron who as always does a credible job with what she's given and is drop dead gorgeous while she's doing it, Statham who is just as tough as they come and like Dominic West (""The Wire"") a credit to his British Roots, and Mark (""I am not Matt Damon and I am much better than Matt Damon"") Wahlberg, who does a good job as the leader of the pack and chief retributionist.The drawback (and it's a fun show) is that there is little feeling to it. You know Sutherland is sponsoring Wahlberg to be the best thief in the world, but we don't know why. Wahlberg et al. travels 5ooo miles to Hollywood and brings the four remaining gang members, with cars, motorcycles and connections to avenge Sutherland, but we don't know how he gets the money to do so (he lost evrything in ""the Italian job"") or why. Charlize doesn't like Wahlberg but after awhile, she still seems unenchanted with him. And Norton is an evil, murdering bad guy . . . . at least they tell us that but it doesn't seem to come across.It's like the ""Bourne"" movies with Damon, kind of the same in the sense that they are big on retribution and have great cinematography.

One is on the canals of Venice and involves speed boats and gondolas.  The car chases are really good too.  In one scene the cars drive down the stairs and on to the tracks of the Los Angeles subway.

Edward Norton does a terrific job playing the slimy double-crosser and with Jason Statham, Mos Def and Seth Green backing up our two main protagonists this is probably one of the few ensemble casts without any real weaknesses.Mark Wahlberg has had me hooked since ""Three Kings,"" and ""The Italian Job"" only adds to his growing resume. Charlize Theron is incredible as always and she manages to take a role that could have easily become a cliche and make it completely unique.I've never seen this director before, but with the planning and camerawork that went into the film, you can bet that I'll be looking for him again in future films.

Gary Gray (Friday, A Man Apart)The Italian Job is a fast-paced, entertaining, and fun crime caper. In a year of pointless remakes, this one fairs very well and boasts a terrific cast who deliver excellent performances.The admittedly cliched plot follows the same set-up as most caper films, including the recent ""Ocean's 11"" and ""The Good Thief,"" which, despite the hype, was boring and poorly edited: a crew get together to pull of a heist, the characters are briefly introduced, the preparation is set forth,and finally, it comes time to complete the heist, with lots going wrong. Despite the formulaic scenario, director F. Gary Gray's execution was high-energy and exciting, so the lackluster plot can easily be overlooked. One brilliant twis in the film has our characters rigging the stoplights of Los Angeles so they can drive right out of the city with a carful of gold (in a safe that they're stealing back after their double-crossing ex-partner, played by Edward Norton, stole it from them), with nothing but green lights, while everyone else gets red lights, thus keeping the roads plugged with the largest traffic jam in L.A. history and the police from pursuing them.All this leads to well-staged speedboat and car chases which produces nail-biting suspense in beautiful locations. From start to finish, the filmmakers rarely pass up a joke--they even find a way to use Napster inventor Shawn Fanning in a very funny cameo.It's true the movie may have a few plot holes, and, yes, it works a little too hard to sell a happy ending, which is the only aspect of the film that DIDN'T work. But this kind of pure escapist fare can get away with a certain amount of flaws through high spirits and sheer inventiveness - both abundant qualities in The Italian Job. It's an adventure and a character study and a hoot-and-a-half worth of laughs.

It's a blend of the story-driven crime capers of a generation ago and today's computer generated special effects techniques. For the most part, this combination succeeds. The action and the story are both strictly of the ""only in the movies"" variety, but they are fun to watch. ""The Italian Job"" may not be a classic, but it is quite entertaining.The movie opens in Venice, where John [Donald Sutherland], an old professional thief, and his protegee, Charlie [Mark Wahlberg], are in the final stages of planning a $35,000,000 gold heist with their gang. The exciting, though improbable, plan goes off without a hitch, but one of the members, Steve [Edward Norton], turns out to be a traitor. He and his own Ukrainian gang steal the gold and leave John, Charlie and the rest for dead in an Alpine lake. Steve ends up in Los Angeles, where he uses his gold to finance a lavish lifestyle.  What he doesn't know is that everyone but John survived somehow, and now, along with John's beautiful daughter, Stella [Charlize Theron], the guys are out for revenge.The excellent cast, which also includes Seth Green and Jason Stratham, doesn't have much in the movie that tests its muscles talent-wise, but everyone performs with great gusto. They may be in `just a movie', but at least it is far from an embarrassing one.Of particular note is the photography.

Once this movie crosses the finish line, you actually feel like you just regained that precious 105 minutes you lost watching...oh, hell, I don't know, ""Maid in Manhattan"".Donald Sutherland plays a thief who, with his crew members (Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Mos Def, Jason Statham, and Ed Norton), heist $35 billion in gold bullion from a Mafia safe. They think they're all set until one of their crew members turns on them during the end of the getaway. Sutherland is killed and the turncoat crew member escapes with the gold, nearly killing his teammates in the process.Flash forward, a year later. The turncoat is rich and Wahlberg has found him living in L.A.. Wahlberg assembles his original team to go after the turncoat, even enlisting the help of Sutherland's daughter who is a beautiful Mini-Cooper-driving safe-cracker(!). ""It's not about the gold! It's about payback!"", the movie boldly states although I wonder if there was no gold involved and it sunk with Charlie Croker's almost-doomed crew, whether they would go after the punk.This movie is like that small box of chocolates you get from your other half instead of the large box. It goes down easy and doesn't make you feel like you've overeaten. As sleek as the Mini-Coopers that coast through the sewers of L.A., this is a summer action picture with the works. It's as techno-horny as the two ""Mission: Impossible"" films, though less serious and as fast and furious as...well...the Fast and the Furious and even Gone in 60 Seconds. Though, it's less goofy and with a slicker and smarter plotline.A who-who's of young Hollywood talent is the main reason to see this movie. Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie, Ed Norton as the unpredictable Steve, Seth Green is the computer-hacking ""Napster"", Jason Statham is ""Handsome Rob"", the wheelman, Mos Def is surprisingly good as ""Left Ear"", the explosives man, and Charlize Theron rounds out the cast as Stella the Safecracker, the daughter of Donnie Sutherland's character, John Bridger (in a nice homage to the original Charlie Croker, played by Michael Caine in the 1969 film).I almost would have preferred that this film could have been a remake/sequel in which Sutherland was playing the elder Croker and Theron was the next-generation Croker (The beginning of the film feels like the veteran is handing the ball to the rookie) but, alas, Mark Wahlberg takes the reins and the film works on its own as a fine ""heist-the-loot-and-run"" ride.The script is witty and good fun. The good guys are smart, funny, and charming and have all the cool gadgets and you want to see the bad guy get his butt kicked in the end.85 percent of this film is shot in L.A., California which begs the question, ""Why is this called 'The Italian Job'?"" However, such intricacies are easily overlooked when you watch the film and you could simply chalk it up to the fact that it's in tribute/reference to the first film.This is the first film I have seen where, after it ended, I wanted to get in my car and drive anywhere at speeds exceeding 100 MPH without care that the cops might pull me over.--Matt",3,VROOM!!!,1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,3214,"['popcorn', 'finished', 'popping', 'couch', 'welcoming', 'fun', 'ready', 'be', 'had.How', 'could', 'NOT', 'Italian', 'Job', 'Once', 'movie', 'finish', 'line', 'actually', 'feel', 'just', 'regained', 'precious', '105', 'minutes', 'lost', 'watching', 'oh', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', '.Donald', 'Sutherland', 'thief', 'who', 'crew', 'members', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'heist', '35', 'billion', 'gold', 'bullion', 'Mafia', 'safe', 'think', ""'re"", 'set', 'one', 'crew', 'members', 'end', 'getaway', 'Sutherland', 'killed', 'turncoat', 'crew', 'member', 'gold', 'nearly', 'killing', 'teammates', 'process.Flash', 'forward', 'year', 'later', 'turncoat', 'rich', 'Wahlberg', 'found', 'living', 'L.A..', 'Wahlberg', 'original', 'team', 'go', 'turncoat', 'even', 'enlisting', 'help', 'Sutherland', 'daughter', 'who', 'beautiful', 'Mini-Cooper-driving', 'safe-cracker', 'not', 'gold', 'payback', 'movie', 'boldly', 'wonder', 'was', 'gold', 'involved', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'almost-doomed', 'crew', 'would', 'go', 'punk.This', 'movie', 'small', 'box', 'chocolates', 'get', 'other', 'half', 'instead', 'large', 'box', 'down', 'easy', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'overeaten', 'As', 'sleek', 'Mini-Coopers', 'coast', 'sewers', 'L.A.', 'summer', 'action', 'picture', 'works', 'as', 'techno-horny', 'two', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'films', 'though', 'less', 'serious', 'fast', 'furious', 'well', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'even', 'Gone', '60', 'Seconds', 'less', 'goofy', 'slicker', 'smarter', 'plotline.A', 'who-who', 'young', 'Hollywood', 'talent', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Charlie', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'unpredictable', 'Steve', 'Seth', 'Green', 'computer-hacking', 'Napster', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Handsome', 'Rob', 'wheelman', 'Mos', 'Def', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Left', 'Ear', 'explosives', 'man', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'out', 'cast', 'Stella', 'Safecracker', 'daughter', 'Donnie', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'John', 'Bridger', 'nice', 'homage', 'original', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'played', 'Michael', 'Caine', '1969', 'film', 'almost', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'remake/sequel', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'playing', 'elder', 'Croker', 'Theron', 'was', 'next-generation', 'Croker', 'beginning', 'film', 'feels', 'veteran', 'handing', 'ball', 'rookie', 'alas', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'reins', 'film', 'own', 'fine', 'heist-the-loot-and-run', 'ride.The', 'script', 'witty', 'good', 'fun', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'smart', 'funny', 'charming', 'have', 'cool', 'gadgets', 'want', 'see', 'bad', 'guy', 'get', 'butt', 'kicked', 'end.85', 'percent', 'film', 'shot', 'L.A.', 'California', 'question', 'Why', 'called', ""'The"", 'Italian', 'Job', 'However', 'such', 'intricacies', 'are', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'could', 'simply', 'chalk', 'up', 'fact', 'tribute/reference', 'first', 'film.This', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'where', 'ended', 'wanted', 'get', 'car', 'drive', 'anywhere', 'speeds', 'exceeding', '100', 'MPH', 'care', 'cops', 'might', 'pull', 'Matt']",N/A

770560,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B0000B1OFL,Mel Odom,"[6, 11]","THE ITALIAN JOB is billed as a remake of a popular Michael Caine movie from 1969, but it is so highly inventive in most aspects that it's really more of an original.  The movies still occupies itself with a daring robbery of gold bricks involving managing traffic and the use of mini-Coopers, and some of the characters even have the same names as the first movie.  However, the remake is a definite thriller that is guaranteed to stoke the adrenaline levels of watchers everywhere.Mark Wahlberg stars as Charlie Croker.  Donald Sutherland plays John Bridger, his criminal mastermind mentor.  It's this relationship, along with Charlize Theron as his estranged daughter Stella, that really drives the movies.  Edward Norton plays the bad guy, while Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G round out the crew.The movie opens with a fantastic bit that establishes the relationship between Croker and Bridger, then moves smoothly into an action riff that eats up screen footage and shows off Venice and the canals.  After a double-cross in the Swiss Alps, the movie skips ahead a year and introduces us to Stella Bridger.  Stella makes her living as a professional safecracker who uses her powers for good.  Charlie talks to her, telling her they've finally tracked down the man who killed her father, and he offers her a place on the team to get revenge.From that point on, the movie sprints forward into a rapid-fire game of cat and mouse between our heroes and the bad guy.  It plays out like a chess battle, but accelerated to tire-screeching hairpin twists and turns.The Blu-ray edition of the movies is awesome.  The video content is so clear in Venice that you'll swear you're on the canals yourself.  Director F. Gary Gray's pacing and shots are designed to thrill, and they do.  The picture is absolutely stunning.

But they are quickly double-crossed by one of their own partners in crime, who kills Bridger and forces the others to plummet into an icy river, leaving them for dead.A year goes by and Croker contacts Stella (Charlize Theron), Bridger's daughter and a safe-cracking expert, and tells her that he has picked up the trail of the man who killed her father. He invites her to join his team and help reclaim their gold and avenge John Bridger's death.Don't be discouraged from watching this movie by believing it to be a modernized remake of the 1969 classic. While there are definitely some connections between them (a plot-driving gold heist, car chases involving mini coopers and the movies' titles), this one is an excellently executed, Gary Gray film that shines on its own.In a tight, solid plot it combines fast-paced action, thrilling suspense, clever and daring heists, great locales, state-of-the-art technology, engaging and witty characters, and a healthy dose of comedy skillfully added in all the right places. And the fact that it leaves out any unnecessary dramatic, life-altering issues makes it even more fun to watch.The enjoyable mix of characters flawlessly portrayed by the actors, come alive through smart, snappy dialogues and believable characterizations. The choice of good, old-fashioned stunts that lend authenticity to the action over the not always effective CGI special effects, and the surprisingly pleasant musical score, give this movie the perfect finishing touch.Sit back and enjoy the ride!--Reviewed by M.

Wahlberg has that stoic manliness we used to get from guys like Mitchum and Widmark; Charlize Theron as Sutherland's beautiful daughter, does nicely; Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def are perfect members of Wahlberg's gang.

770569,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0000B1OFL,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","I live right around the corner from a Mini Coop dealership and I'm an Italian-American, so I thought it fitting that I finally rented this movie.  It's a remake of the 1969 original starring Michael Caine.  Whereas that film took place in Italy, the remake stays there only for the introduction and then swiftly moves to California.I love heist films.  Like Ocean's Eleven or Heat, it's all about the cast.  You can see a pattern in the characters:THE WHEELMAN: This is the guy who mans the getaway vehicle, be it helicopter, jet, or car.  Handsome Rob (Jason Statham, my favorite action hero) plays a decidedly scrappy, suave wheelman.  This also happens to be almost the exact character from The Transporter.  Hopefully, Statham will move beyond this type of character, but it's a testament to action tropes that he can actually be typecast as ""the wheelman.""THE TECH: This guy is almost always a nerd and usually the comic relief.  Lyle (Seth Green) nails this role and actually steals the show with his jokes.  One ad-libbed sequence of Lyle mocking Handsome Rob is the funniest part of the movie.  Of course, the challenge with this sort of character is that he needs to be able to pull off seemingly magical feats of technological wizardry without overshadowing the expertise involved.  When Lyle manages to take control of the entire traffic system, you really have to wonder if he couldn't be better off striking out on his own.  He's almost too good for the movie.THE DEMOLITIONIST: The demolitionist's job is to blow things up.  Sometimes he's a homicidal maniac, other times he's cool and collected.  Left Ear (Mos Def) is a cool customer. And he doesn't like dogs. He gives Lyle competition for the funniest line in the movie:Left Ear: This dude got dogs. I don't do dogs... I had a real bad experience, man.Charlie Croker: What happened?Left Ear: I had. A bad. Experience.THE OLD MAN: You've seen this guy before.  He's probably the former leader of the group.  He's seen too much, been around the block too many times, and he knows his days are numbered.  He just wants one last, big heist so he can retire forever.  He almost always dies in the film.  That pretty much sums up John Bridger (Donald Sutherland).THE HOT CHICK: A recent invention, the hot chick's purpose is to keep men interested.  She can have a variety of roles (tech, wheel-err-woman, demolitionist).  Sometimes she has her own unique set of skills as safecracker.  That's John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), who competes admirably in the sea of testosterone.THE LEADER: Handsome, smart, a safecracker himself, this guy is the one who pulls off a sneaky job right under the bad guys' noses. Unfortunately, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) is more narrator than anything else.  He seems to have very little to do, and that's a shame, because Wahlberg's talented enough to do much more.The villain is Steve (Edward Norton) a thief turned bad. He knows all of our protagonists' tricks, so he knows how to counter them.  And since he stole the gold from the original Italian Job, he's the perfect foil.  Norton plays him with just the right amount of shifty-eyed sleaze.The Italian Job has lots of cool car chases, lots of near misses, and a lot of twists and turns (literally and figuratively) that make it a brisk, entertaining movie.  You get quickly caught up in the machinations of the characters, which allows the film to get away with a lot of unbelievable nonsense.  But who cares? From the funky flashbacks to the quippy asides, it's clear that Italian Job doesn't take itself too seriously.Although it's more Job than Italian, the Italian Job is still a fun ride.",4,The Italian Review,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,3657,"['live', 'right', 'corner', 'Mini', 'Coop', 'dealership', ""'m"", 'Italian-American', 'thought', 'fitting', 'finally', 'rented', 'movie', 'remake', '1969', 'original', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Whereas', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'Italy', 'remake', 'only', 'introduction', 'then', 'swiftly', 'California.I', 'love', 'heist', 'films', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'Heat', 'cast', 'can', 'see', 'pattern', 'characters', 'WHEELMAN', 'guy', 'who', 'getaway', 'vehicle', 'be', 'helicopter', 'jet', 'car', 'Handsome', 'Rob', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'favorite', 'action', 'hero', 'decidedly', 'scrappy', 'suave', 'wheelman', 'also', 'be', 'almost', 'exact', 'character', 'Transporter', 'Hopefully', 'Statham', 'will', 'move', 'type', 'character', 'testament', 'action', 'tropes', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'typecast', 'wheelman', 'TECH', 'guy', 'almost', 'always', 'nerd', 'usually', 'comic', 'relief', 'Lyle', 'Seth', 'Green', 'role', 'actually', 'show', 'jokes', 'One', 'ad-libbed', 'sequence', 'Lyle', 'mocking', 'Handsome', 'Rob', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'course', 'challenge', 'sort', 'character', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'seemingly', 'magical', 'feats', 'technological', 'wizardry', 'overshadowing', 'expertise', 'involved', 'When', 'Lyle', 'take', 'control', 'entire', 'traffic', 'system', 'really', 'have', 'wonder', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'striking', 'out', 'own', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'movie.THE', 'DEMOLITIONIST', 'demolitionist', 'job', 'blow', 'things', 'up', 'Sometimes', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'other', 'times', 'cool', 'collected', 'Left', 'Ear', 'Mos', 'Def', 'cool', 'customer', ""n't"", 'like', 'dogs', 'Lyle', 'competition', 'funniest', 'line', 'movie', 'Left', 'Ear', 'dude', 'got', 'dogs', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'dogs', 'had', 'real', 'bad', 'experience', 'man.Charlie', 'Croker', 'What', 'happened', 'Left', 'Ear', 'had', 'bad', 'Experience.THE', 'OLD', 'MAN', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'guy', 'before', 'probably', 'former', 'leader', 'group', 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'been', 'block', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'days', 'are', 'numbered', 'just', 'one', 'last', 'big', 'heist', 'can', 'retire', 'forever', 'almost', 'always', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'John', 'Bridger', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', '.THE', 'HOT', 'CHICK', 'recent', 'invention', 'hot', 'chick', 'purpose', 'keep', 'men', 'interested', 'can', 'have', 'variety', 'roles', 'tech', 'wheel-err-woman', 'demolitionist', 'Sometimes', 'own', 'unique', 'set', 'skills', 'safecracker', 'John', 'daughter', 'Stella', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'who', 'admirably', 'sea', 'testosterone.THE', 'LEADER', 'Handsome', 'smart', 'safecracker', 'guy', 'one', 'who', 'sneaky', 'job', 'right', 'bad', 'guys', 'noses', 'Unfortunately', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'more', 'narrator', 'anything', 'else', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'shame', 'Wahlberg', 'talented', 'enough', 'do', 'much', 'more.The', 'villain', 'Steve', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'thief', 'turned', 'bad', 'protagonists', 'tricks', 'how', 'counter', 'stole', 'gold', 'original', 'Italian', 'Job', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Norton', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'shifty-eyed', 'sleaze.The', 'Italian', 'Job', 'lots', 'cool', 'car', 'chases', 'lots', 'near', 'misses', 'lot', 'twists', 'turns', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'make', 'brisk', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'get', 'quickly', 'caught', 'up', 'machinations', 'characters', 'film', 'get', 'away', 'lot', 'unbelievable', 'nonsense', 'who', 'funky', 'quippy', 'asides', 'clear', 'Italian', 'Job', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously.Although', 'more', 'Job', 'Italian', 'Italian', 'Job', 'still', 'fun', 'ride']",N/A

770572,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B0000B1OFL,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[0, 1]","Has Hollywood truly run out of good ideas? It sure seems that way with the large amount of sequels and remakes invading movie theaters this year. You think its bad now? Wait until next year. For the time being, let's focus on the entries for 2003. Many of the high profile features this summer are sequels including The Matrix Reloaded, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, and X2: X-Men United while remakes seemed to restricted to the lower profile projects such Freaky Friday and The Italian Job. Most modern movie-goers may not be familiar with the original The Italian Job which starred Michael Caine, Benny Hill, and Noel Coward in this 1969 British caper comedy. The latest version of the classic film features actor Mark Wahlberg, who has become known his roles in other remake films such as The Planet of the Apes and The Truth About Charlie, neither of which received exceptionally high praise from critics or the public. Will his presence in yet another remake continue the trend? Maybe the presence of Edward Norton and Charlize Theron, two other well known performers, can counterbalance any negativity from Wahlberg's past. One thing's for sure, the sight of mini-coopers driving down subway stairs sure has drawn plenty of attention. Let's just hope there's more behind this film then that.The story follows a group of thieves as they try to pull a huge heist on a former colleague who ripped them off a year ago. Charlie Croker loves his profession almost as much as his mentor. What profession is that? Theft. John Bridger realizes he is getting older and decides that he is getting to the point where he wants to slow down and spend time with his daughter. In coming to this decision, he wants to hand the reins over to Charlie in helping him pull off one last great heist before his retirement. After the crew consisting of inside man Steve, computer whiz Lyle, explosive expert Left-Ear, and wheel-man Rob are successful in this heist of nearly $35 million in gold, they are suddenly double-crossed by Steve, who kills John and leaves the others for dead. Though the others survive, they are still saddened by the loss of their group leader. That's why one year later when they catch up with their former associate, they employ John's daughter Stella in helping them steal the gold back and avenge John's death. Even without seeing the original film, the story for The Italian Job is rather predictable but it the cleverly choreographed action sequences that save this production from being mundane.There a reason why the Paramount marketing team is focusing on The Italian Job's action sequences; the film has no real star power behind. At least none that would bring in a reasonable crowd on their name alone. Mark Wahlberg, who, as it was said before, best known for his performances in past remakes, show improvement in his acting ability from his previous entries but not enough to solidify him for anything outside of future remakes. Edward Norton, best known for his roles in American History X and Fight Club, gives a wonderfully villainous performance that will leave everyone watching the film absolutely despising his character. Charlize Theron gives a decent performance in this film but still leaves a sense that the filmmakers used her just as eye-candy for this feature. Not her fault, but obviously there could have been better used for her in this film. And Donald Sutherland gives a delightful performance despite his limited time on screen.Overall, the amusing performances and spectacular action sequences save this film from being less then a mediocre retread. Unfortunately as good as the filmmakers try to make this film out to be, The Italian Job doesn't even come close to the prestige of other crime capers such as Ocean's Eleven. There may be many reasons behind this; the fact that none of the performers, outside of possibly Edward Norton, have really showcased their full acting talent in any other high-profile features to make this more then just humorous or slightly enjoyable. Maybe it's the fact that, unlike Ocean's Eleven, the audience pretty much knows what is going to happen before they even get comfortable in their seats. Blame the marketing for pretty much showcasing the entire film in the trailer but the premise itself doesn't help the suspense factor of this film either. Had the filmmakers added a few more twists and turns in the plot of the remake rather then just modernizing the original crime capper then maybe this would have been more then a moderate piece of escapism. Rather then dwelling on what could have been, The Italian Job doesn't require you to leave your head at the door like other summer features but it does test the believability of some movie-goers.",4,The Moose Hole -

It will entertain you for an hour and a half, but there's really nothing you'll take with you.All the actors are fairly unique and fun to look at.  Mark Wahlburg is the brains of the bunch, but he's sensitive too.  Jason Statham stands out as &quot;Handsome Rob&quot; who is a wheelman as well as a ladies man.  Charlize Theron holds a subdued beauty and confidence in this film.However the characters are not larger than life like the characters in Snatch or Oceans Eleven, but they also don't try to be authentic like characters in The Score or Spy Game.  This middle ground approach leaves the characters a little bland and forgettable.The plot is fair, though it is a little predictable.  There are heists and double-crosses.  Much of it is a setup for the stunts, which are pulled off well and don't show any major flaws.  The Mini Coopers are fun to watch.However, the plot is also a setup for heavy product placement, including the Mini Coopers, several Napster references, and a prominent Pepsi truck used in one of the stunts.I liked that this film did not rely heavily on profanity or violence.  None of the protagonists used weapons, and I cannot recall any of them swearing.  The biggest laugh of the film for me was when a 400 pound gangster called another character a &quot;mother freaker.&quot;  It has a PG-13 rating because Edward Norton whacks a couple guys with guns.I recommend this movie if you're looking to kill 90 minutes, but don't expect a lot of brain work or redeeming value.Pros:-simple, straightforward, fun caper movie-no profanity-the heroes use no weapons (besides a fist)-directing is clean; no major flawsCons:-cliched and predictable-heavy product placement-won't leave you with any redeeming value beyond pure entertainment",3,Pop the popcorn and kill 90 minutes,1068595200,"11 12, 2003",2003,1859,"[""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'quot', 'Italian', 'Job', 'quot', 'take', 'what', 'summertime', 'caper', 'movie', 'will', 'entertain', 'hour', 'half', 'really', 'nothing', ""'ll"", 'take', 'actors', 'are', 'fairly', 'unique', 'fun', 'look', 'Mark', 'Wahlburg', 'brains', 'bunch', 'sensitive', 'too', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'out', 'quot', 'Handsome', 'Rob', 'quot', 'who', 'wheelman', 'as', 'well', 'ladies', 'man', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'subdued', 'beauty', 'confidence', 'film.However', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'Snatch', 'Oceans', 'Eleven', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'authentic', 'characters', 'Score', 'Spy', 'Game', 'middle', 'ground', 'approach', 'characters', 'little', 'bland', 'forgettable.The', 'plot', 'fair', 'little', 'predictable', 'are', 'heists', 'double-crosses', 'Much', 'setup', 'stunts', 'are', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'major', 'flaws', 'Mini', 'Coopers', 'are', 'fun', 'watch.However', 'plot', 'also', 'setup', 'heavy', 'product', 'placement', 'including', 'Mini', 'Coopers', 'several', 'Napster', 'references', 'prominent', 'Pepsi', 'truck', 'used', 'one', 'stunts.I', 'liked', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'rely', 'heavily', 'profanity', 'violence', 'None', 'protagonists', 'used', 'weapons', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'swearing', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'film', 'was', 'when', '400', 'pound', 'gangster', 'called', 'character', 'quot', 'freaker.', 'quot', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'couple', 'guys', 'guns.I', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'kill', '90', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'brain', 'work', 'redeeming', 'value.Pros', '-simple', 'straightforward', 'fun', 'caper', 'movie-no', 'profanity-the', 'heroes', 'use', 'weapons', 'fist', '-directing', 'clean', 'major', 'flawsCons', '-cliched', 'predictable-heavy', 'product', 'placement-wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'redeeming', 'value', 'pure', 'entertainment']",N/A

Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) is his protege at the helm of an operation for the first time. Kyle (Seth Green) is their computer guy. Left Ear (Mos Def) does explosives and demolition. Handsome Rob (Jason Statham)  is the wheel man responsible for the getaway. And Steve (Edward Norton)  infiltrates the target building. The object of their desire is a safe containing $35 million in gold bricks. The job goes as planned until Steve betrays his partners, leaves them for dead,  and makes off with the loot. A year later, back in the United States, Charlie has tracked Steve down and reassembled his team to take back the gold and exact revenge for John's murder. John's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron), a safe expert who normally works on the right side of the law, joins them with vengence on her mind.Director F. Gary Gray has made an upbeat, funny and action-packed caper film. &quot;The Italian Job&quot; is light entertainment. The characters have just enough depth to bring them within the bounds of credibility and enough idiosyncrasies to make them entertaining. The film revolves around clever, complicated heists and spectacular chase scenes. Three souped up Mini Coopers and one vintage Mini are featured prominently. These little cars steal every scene they are in. &quot;The Italian Job&quot;'s stunts and chase sequences are not digitally enhanced. They were filmed the old fashioned way with lots of fancy driving and smashed cars, which gives them a sense of fun sometimes absent in modern action films. Sometimes I felt that too much time was spent on the antics of the obligatory colorful characters,which creates excessive lulls between substantive scenes. The movie tries desperately to make computer technology look interesting and sexy, which seems to be the (failed) mission of every action film these days. But &quot;The Italian Job&quot; is slick, fun, and energetic. It is only loosely based on the 1969 film of the same name. Recommended for a good time at the movies and to Mini Cooper aficionados everywhere.The DVD: Bonus features include a short &quot;making of&quot; documentary with interviews with director F. Gary Gray and  the film's cast (except Edward Norton), interviews with the film's writers, a segment about the driving training that the actors received, a segment about the film's specially designed Mini Coopers, explanations of the film's most spectacular stunts including the unprecedented chase scene in Venice's canals, some deleted scenes, and the theatrical trailer.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 21]","Whatever your thoughts on the original movie, last year's The Italian Job has very little in common with it, only referencing the former once when talking about car chases.  If anything, this seems to have been influenced by Ocean's Eleven more than anything else in it's efforts to be achingly cool.  Unfortunately it just doesn't succeed.  The plot is minimal, but that's not really the complaint given the fact that you don't go and see this kind of film for the plot.  You go to see it for the action, and here's it's pretty stinted and unexciting.  The direction is so sloppy that virtually no tension is built up in the various heist sequences, and the beautiful Venice backdrop is barely utilised at all.  More importanly, the return of the Mini chase sequence is distinctly lacklustre.  In recent years both The Rock and The Bourne Identity have given us much better car chase scenes, and this one really falls flat.In many ways it's a shame this isn't any better, because its cast really is superb.  If you can forget about the wooden star quality of Mark Wahlberg, then you've got Oscar-winner Charlize Theron and Oscar-nominee Edward Norton is supporting roles.  Unfortunately both actors aren't given nearly as much screen time as you might like, Norton's role amounting to little more than a cameo.  Contractually obliged to take the role, this is least distinguished role yet, a shame given the fact he is such an astounding talent.  Anyone wanting to see him in better roles would do better to check out American History X or 25th Hour.  Perhaps surprisingly, the best performances come from the minor players of the crack team.  Seth Green really hits his stride here, capitalising on his Austin Powers and Buffy fame to give the few laughs the film contains.  Jason Stratham is also very good, though his persona from Snatch may wear thin before too long.Like I said, the main problem with The Italian Job is that it's so boring, overlong, cheesy and unexciting.  There are heaps better action movies out there - Speed and True Lies spring to mind - and as far as heist movies go, Ocean's Eleven, and even the uneven The Score, have this beat.

The hard-edged direction of F. Gary Gray (""The Negotiator"") was nothing short of excellent! The talents of Mark Wahlberg (""Planet of the Apes""), Charlize Theron (""The Devil's Advocate""), Edward Norton (""The Score""), Seth Green (The ""Austin Powers"" films), Jason Statham (""The Transporter"", ""Snatch""), Mos Def (""Brown Sugar""), and Donald Sutherland (""A Time to Kill"") were top-notch, powerful, and commanding!This remake of the 1969 film focuses on career criminal Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) and his team: computer expert Lyle (Green), wheelman Handsome Rob (Statham), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), and inside man Steve (Norton). Along with Charlie's mentor/veteran safecracker John Bridger (Sutherland), the team has successfully pulled off a daring heist at a heavily guarded palazzo in Venice, Italy. The prize: $35 million worth of gold bullion! After a clean getaway, Charlie and the crew experienced a threat that they never saw coming...a double-crosser! As it turns out, Steve just happened to be the double-crosser! And the end result: The death of John Bridger and leaving the rest of the team for dead as well! A year later, Charlie and the team find Steve in Los Angeles and they decide to get some long-awaited revenge, but they couldn't do it alone. This is where John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Theron), comes into the picture. Stella is an expert safecracker with nerves of steel like her father, and the murder of her father provides much of the drive for the conflict of the film. Stella reluctantly joins Charlie and the gang as they come up with a brilliantly smart and devious plan. The plan: To re-steal the gold by tapping into L.A.'s traffic control system and manipulate signals, thus creating one of the biggest traffic jams in L.A.'s history! Also included in the plan is that once they have reclaimed the gold, they can get away in their speedy, but versatile, Mini Cooper automobiles, which are small enough to drive on sidewalks so they can make a clean getaway before the massive traffic jam clears. Like Charlie says in the film, ""We'll do it like the Italian Job."" Because you see, this isn't about the money. This isn't about payoff. It's about payback!In conclusion, ""The Italian Job"" has lots of action, harrowing suspense, brilliant stuntwork, lots of surprises, and outstanding performances from a top-notch cast!

770591,A2WMPYQA0VDO3H,B0000B1OFL,Nickibockers,"[12, 14]","While I love Michael Caine, the original Italian Job was just overall goofy, for today's standards, and the heist wasn't believable, as he had poor technology, a fat blubbering professor, an inept Mafia at his tail, too little money to divvy up amongst a bus full of incompetent nincompoops, and a brain-dead girlfriend. All of which would have better made a Brit Com series than an action movie.I was reluctant to see this movie when I heard it was coming out... Until my Original Italian Job-loving (and MINI loving, to boot) Dad bought it. I watched it and it was brilliant!Suspend disbelief for a while and just enjoy the possibility of mastermind thieves and safe-crackers pulling one over the ever-sleezeball-portraying Norton, and getting away with MINI loads of gold bars.Mark Wahlberg plays well the cunning master-thief Charlie Croker and Donald Sutherland gets an all-too-short, but very well-acted role as the surrogate dad for Charlie, sometimes better than his role as dad for his daughter Stella.I enjoyed the mix of characters and thought Charlize Theron does a good job as grieving daughter Stella trying to keep away from everything that reminds her of her father, including Charlie. The writers did a good job holding off on cheezy love scenes that so easily could have been inserted in tender, vulnerable moments between the Stella and Charlie.The others play well with and off each other, from the goofy Seth Green as the resentful ex-Napster Lyle, to a half-deaf loveable Left Ear, and a swaggering smooth-talker of a Brit in Handsome Rob. This small group of characters, as opposed to the large posse Michael Caine had around him, would more believably go along with the heist for a large chunk of the more abundant millions.While the only resemblance to the original is the three red, white and blue MINIs (originally a nod to the Union Jack), and the heist through a traffic jam (a traffic jam in LA is much more believable than the one in the original, and I thought the writers did a good job reworking that), and a wee bit of Italy in the beginning, this movie holds its own as an original, fun, fast-paced joy ride.Don't be too hard on the advertisers!

""Bad Boys,""  ""Die Hard,"" and ""True Lies"" can all be called guilty pleasures. Another genre that has come into fashion recently in the heist or caper flick, where a stylish yet motley crew of thieves follow their charismatic leader to bull off what is always ""One Last Job"".The charismatic leader of the group is Charlie Croker (Mark Walberg, in a performance that gives a new definition to the term `dry-read'). The rest of this crew are equally as predictable; there's the computer guy who can hack into anything, the demolitions guy, the womanizing wheelman, and the veteran thief and safecracker in it for ""one last job"" played by Donald Sutherland. Rounding out the crew is Steve Frezelli (Edward Norton) the only member of the crew that has no discernable talent, which makes him the prime suspect in any double cross.The real story of this movie is the Ed Norton had to do it, because he had signed a multi-film deal with the studio, and the studio was threatening legal action. You can tell because he gives one of the most uninspired performances of his career. Mark Walberg is never believable for a minute as the charismatic leader of his crew.The jokes, which admittedly are funny in a corny way, are too rapid fire for the audience to take the action part seriously, but are not funny enough for this to be a fulfilling comedy. I kind of wish the filmmakers went completely overboard and made a self mocking action movie like ""The Boondock Saints."" But the film always tries to keep one foot in the land of credibility and it just doesn't work because I was never invested in this movie or the characters at all. I wouldn't have cared if at any time during the movie everybody dropped dead.The movie feels like an excuse to get as many mini-coopers into a film as possible. The sound editors made these mini's sound like fire breathing tractor-trailers, not like the hamster wheel engines that Mini's actually are equipped with.

You need to learn what your talking about before you come on here yapping BLU RAY BLU RAY BLU RAY.As of right now it is very common knowledge that the combination of Microsofts VC-1 with HD-DVD is putting out a noticably better picture than the Blu Ray MPEG2 combination. The Toshiba is simply getting better bitrates and lets face it when talking HD, bitrate is everything.As for the storage argument, even Sony has backed off of using that argument in its promotion of Blu Ray. The fact is that right now Sony only has single layer Blu Ray discs available with 2 layer coming very soon making the 25 Gig disc a 50 Gig disc. HD-DVD is currently capable of dual layer at the moment for 30 Gigs with a 3 Layer disc on the way soon making it a 45 gig disc. So to sum that up for you HD-DVD will max out at 45 Gigs and Blu Ray will max at 50 Gigs. If you thing that a measly 5 Gigs is something so big as to sway your decision on which format to support than your crazy. 45 Gigs is absolutly plenty of room for 1080p movies. Sony has conned you once again into thinking you need something you dont.So to sum up this argument, at the current time, HD-DVD is by far looking like the much better choiuce of the two formats. Better picture quality, cheaper player and a very descent selection of movies on the way. Ihave made my choice and its HD-DVD.As for the movie The Italian Job, Its not the best of the Paramount releases but it is a nice crisp image. I actually think the reason its not as sharp as some of the others like Sahara is the original film stock. Its still a very nice upgrade from the original DVD release and being its one of my favorite con movies to come out in recent years, it was a no brainer.

The writing fades a bit about an hour into the movie.  About the only rediculous part is the blatant product endorsing (mini Cooper cars, Pepsi Blue).  Some clothing line might have made a mint if their name showed up on Charlize's near see-through tank tops.. guessing it was quite cold on the set.Also getting some audience interest is a mechanic nicknamed 'Wrench' played by Franky G, who made over half the female crowd go ""Wooo!"".  Maybe the steroids made him forget his last name.  ;)Movie warnings: profanity, no Marky Mark singing (thank God), no sex scenes, three 'yeah rights', and the emergence of the acting career (non-speaking role) of Man Show Juggy girl Julie Costello as Becky, the cable girl.If you're into the adrenaline rush movies with added comedy in the right places, I would highly recommend this one.",4,Product endorsement central  :P,1054080000,"05 28, 2003",2003,1541,"['Mark', 'Wahlburg', 'remake', '1969', 'film', 'note', 'directors/producers', 'little', 'thing', 'called', ""'originality'.."", 'try', 'sometime', '.Mark', 'thief', 'who', 'major', 'gold', 'heist', 'Italy', 'help', 'old', 'pro', 'played', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'computer', 'hacker', 'Seth', 'Green', 'demolitions', 'expert', 'Mos', 'Def', 'get-away', 'man', 'Jason', 'Statham', '.The', 'plan', 'perfectly', 'one', 'other', 'members', 'group', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'character', 'greedy', 'gold', 'rest', 'dead.The', 'group', 'get', 'gold', 'back', 'little', 'help', 'safecracker', 'played', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'old', 'pro', 'daughter.The', 'movie', 'amazing', 'action', 'sequences', 'stunts', 'writing', 'fades', 'bit', 'hour', 'movie', 'only', 'rediculous', 'part', 'blatant', 'product', 'endorsing', 'mini', 'Cooper', 'cars', 'Pepsi', 'Blue', 'clothing', 'line', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'mint', 'name', 'showed', 'up', 'Charlize', 'near', 'see-through', 'tank', 'guessing', 'was', 'quite', 'cold', 'set.Also', 'getting', 'audience', 'interest', 'mechanic', 'nicknamed', ""'Wrench"", 'played', 'Franky', 'G', 'who', 'made', 'female', 'crowd', 'go', 'Wooo', 'Maybe', 'steroids', 'made', 'forget', 'last', 'name', 'Movie', 'warnings', 'profanity', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'singing', 'thank', 'God', 'sex', 'scenes', 'three', 'rights', 'emergence', 'acting', 'career', 'non-speaking', 'role', 'Man', 'Show', 'Juggy', 'girl', 'Julie', 'Costello', 'Becky', 'cable', 'girl.If', ""'re"", 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'movies', 'added', 'comedy', 'right', 'places', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one']",N/A

Predictably, there's a classic case of backstabbing amongst the thieves who did the job (I don't think I'm spoiling anything here -- any movie where the first 15 minutes are of a job going smoothly, you KNOW there's going to be a doublecross to set off the next hour and a half of film).  We then follow the team as they go on a mission of vengence both to reclaim their booty and to get even with their wayward associate.The clever bit is the planning that goes into the operations.

But despite that glaring flaw (how many such thieves really exist), the film is exceptionally good.  The plot is solid, the cast is never boring, the schemes are interesting, and despite the ending's more corny aspects, everything comes together nicely, allowing you to walk away very satisfied as the credits roll.  Betrayed by one of their own after a successful gold heist in Italy, a group of highly intelligent thieves, led by Mark Wahlberg, intend to locate their traitor in order to get the loot back and have their revenge, especially given that a good friend and partner of theirs was killed by this outlaw.  Joining them is Charlize Theron, the daughter of the deceased who, despite her estrangement with her father over the years, would still like a slice of sweet revenge for herself.  Now, this group must travel to Los Angeles, where their Benedict Arnold, played by Edward Norton, has made himself quite comfortable, and use their brains once again to accomplish their goal.  Again, I didn't like the ""Robin Hood"" angle this movie was going for...I think the Ocean's trilogy handled the motives and desires of the thieves much better, but this film was still awesome.  I am sad that Donald Sutherland was once again killed off early in the film, but I suppose the strong impression he made in his brief appearance totally justifies this as he does leave a lasting impact on the rest of the film...I hope the studio still paid him handsomely.  With a host of creative supporting characters, this film does employee a few clich&eacute;s, corny moments, and obvious plot points, but, like the plot, it all works out in the end.

770621,A1POMPC5RSXA73,B0000B1OFL,resident_out_of_touch,"[1, 6]","Shallow characters, uninspired directing, a lackluster screenplay, and tasteless ""hollywood"" music make this shameful wannabe of Ocean's Eleven a huge waste of considerable talent and resources. A great cast is relegated to sketchily developed characters that barely transcend the status of ""stock"". A great deal of potential depth and intrigue is lost by making Edward Norton's villain not only conspicuously absent from much of the film, but also by depriving him of any interesting persona whatsoever. Even Ed Norton, coerced into working on this questionable film, could not bring anything worthwhile to the role. or maybe he didn't care to. The music oscillates awkwardly between blatant ripoffs of the sly double-bass/breakbeat grooves used by Soderberg, and the most tasteless and unoriginal of grandiose film scorms, piling huge string-section crescendos and mind-numbing pounding of drums into chase scenes that are already chaotic enough.Artistically speaking, this is a terrible film, practically a catalog of all that is wrong with big-budget Hollywood fare. However, like most bad Hollywood movies, as a no-brainer two hours of visceral entertainment the film succeeds. Caper/heist films are inherently enjoyable for me, and some funny supporting character interplay and spectacular location work make it a decent action film. But shutting down Sunset Blvd or shooting a boat chase in Venice doesn't bring life or depth to a film, and when the film leaves the action to work on the story or characters, it's the same uninspired nonsense that is in every movie of this type.

Without revealing any spoilers, after the heist, one of the group turns on the rest, and the remainder of the film is about the rest of the group's attempt to get the spiols from the job back.

There's not much original here, and you'll see the movie's twists coming long before its actors, but lots of stuff blows up, the actors all play their roles to the hilt, and there are a lot of one-liners to throw around at work the next day.

770630,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000B1OFL,Robert Moore,"[2, 3]","Look, this is a very solid and professionally produced motion picture, and if all you are seeking is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours, this film will do as well as most.  But the fact is, we really have seen it all before.  In the case of this film, literally, being an inferior remake of the 1969 version starring Michael Caine (though, to be fair, the plots are quite different).  There isn't anything truly wrong with the film.  The chase scenes are expertly performed, the suspense is just right, the gimmicks engaging and interesting, and, for the most part, the cast highly entertaining.So why did I feel a bit let down afterwards?  Well, in part because of Mark Wahlberg.  Three things kept running through my mind as I watched him.  One was that he is absolutely terrible compared to Michael Caine's job playing Charlie Kroker.  Caine is one of the great actors in recent decades in the movies, while Wahlberg is pretty much this year's flavor.  A second thing was that the great Jason Statham, who plays Handsome Rob in the film, would have been an infinitely better Charlie Kroker than Wahlberg (maybe its the Cockney accent he has in common with Michael Caine).  Finally, as I listened to Wahlberg flatly deliver one line after another in a dull monotone, it occurred to me that he is clearly one of the worst actors in the world.  Either that or he is content to sleepwalk through a part.  I ought to add that he was surprisingly good in THREE KINGS, though I haven't seen him in anything that was especially well done since.The rest of the cast, thankfully, is much better, though no one is really given much of an opportunity to put their acting skills on display.  Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses in the movies when given a role that draws out her skills (like MONSTER, which should net her an Oscar in a couple of days).  She isn't just a pretty face.  Jason Statham is fine in his rather undemanding role.  I would love to see him in a really dark and bleak film.  I am not sure how wide his range is, but I would like to find out.  Edward Norton is a great actor, but his part, like most of the others, didn't call at all upon his considerable talents.I did enjoy seeing Donald Sutherland in his brief but key role as John Bridger, the safe cracker who is also the father of Stella (Charlize Theron).  Sutherland starred with Julie Christie in one of the most famous films ever set in Venice, Nicholas Roeg's 1973 DON'T LOOK BACK.  I couldn't help think of that in the various shots that demonstrated that it really was Vienna.By the way, in one scene where you can see Steve Frezelli's (Edward Norton's character) widescreen TV through an outside window, you can definitely see Michael Caine's image on it for a second or so.In short, this is a slickly made film that didn't require much of the actors and doesn't demand much on the part of the viewer.

The story begins in Venice, Italy, where a cadre of thieving buddies, under the tutelage of one Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg), pulls off an amazing heist of some gold bars valued at $35 million.  But before any of the guys have had a chance to even cash in and enjoy their stake, they are betrayed by one of their own - Steve, played by Edward Norton - who kills their mentor, the beloved John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and leaves the rest of the gang for dead in a near-frozen river in the snowy Alps.  A year later, thawed out and not a little peeved at the turn of events, Charlie and the rest of the crew discover Steve's whereabouts in Los Angeles and plot out an enormously complicated scheme to exact their revenge - more for their slain buddy, of course, than for the gold itself.The plotting is never really as compelling as it could be, but ""The Italian Job"" boasts enough finesse and skill in its execution to make the film fun for most of its running time.  The biggest flaw in the screenplay is that it doesn't take full advantage of the tension and conflict inherent in the narrative setup.  We want to see more confrontation scenes between the ""good"" thieves and the one ""bad"" one, but Steve rarely spends any screen time confronting his pursuers.  That's why the best scene by far is one that occurs in a restaurant when the antagonists DO actually square off against each other fact to face.  The overall lack of interaction between these two forces might have been less noticeable and detrimental had the filmmakers come up with any internecine conflicts among Charlie and the other members of his brigade.  Instead, these guys all get along so swimmingly with one another that all we are really able to do is watch the mechanics of the storyline as they play themselves out.  The men have no disagreements, no differences of opinion and no conflicts of interest within their happy little group, a defect in the screenplay which robs the film of some of the tension it might otherwise have had.Still, ""The Italian Job"" is a smooth, fairly standard, fairly enjoyable little time waster with a few good chases both on land and sea, some deft acting and a smattering of amusing one-liners to keep us from walking out of the theater.

It has a great cast, lots of action, but leaves me feeling a bit empty afterward.  So for me this is a rental and will not be added to my collection.  The picture quality is decent, but I'm not sure I would replace the SD DVD with the HD version (if I owned it.)The whole Blu-Ray vs. HD DVD argument is getting a bit tedious, but I'll weigh in.  I've owned my Toshiba HD DVD player since launch day and I've enjoyed it.  I was originally going to wait until a format ""won"", but the release of Serenity pushed me off the fence.  If HD DVD dies, I'll still have a collection of dozens or hundreds of movies to watch-much like I did with laserdisc after DVD killed it.Right now, Blu-Ray only has single layer 25 GB discs and Sony is using the inefficient MPEG-2 codec (compared to Microsoft's VC1 used in nearly all HD DVD titles).  This has resulted in a poorer picture and fewer extras.  Dual layer discs are on the way, but studios may not use them (they may be too expensive in the near term.) Also, the studios could switch to VC1, but again that is up to them.  While the picture quality on even the best HD DVDs is excellent, most will not notice the improvement over standard DVD unless they view both side-by-side.  This makes an HD DVD player purchase difficult to justify.  The lower picture quality of Blu-Ray, combined with the much higher player price is even harder to justify and will keep me from getting Blu-Ray until it can at least match HD DVD's quality.",4,"Good movie, decent HD transfer",1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,1559,"['one', 'movies', 'like', 'watching', 'soon', 'forget', 'plot', 'great', 'cast', 'lots', 'action', 'feeling', 'bit', 'empty', 'afterward', 'So', 'rental', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'added', 'collection', 'picture', 'quality', 'decent', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'replace', 'SD', 'DVD', 'HD', 'version', 'owned', 'whole', 'Blu-Ray', 'vs.', 'HD', 'DVD', 'argument', 'getting', 'bit', 'tedious', ""'ll"", 'weigh', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'Toshiba', 'HD', 'DVD', 'player', 'launch', 'day', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'wait', 'format', 'won', 'release', 'Serenity', 'pushed', 'off', 'fence', 'HD', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'still', 'have', 'collection', 'dozens', 'hundreds', 'movies', 'watch-much', 'did', 'laserdisc', 'DVD', 'killed', 'it.Right', 'now', 'Blu-Ray', 'only', 'single', 'layer', '25', 'GB', 'discs', 'Sony', 'using', 'inefficient', 'MPEG-2', 'codec', 'compared', 'Microsoft', 'VC1', 'used', 'nearly', 'HD', 'DVD', 'titles', 'resulted', 'poorer', 'picture', 'fewer', 'extras', 'Dual', 'layer', 'discs', 'are', 'way', 'studios', 'may', 'not', 'use', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'expensive', 'near', 'term', 'Also', 'studios', 'could', 'switch', 'VC1', 'again', 'up', 'picture', 'quality', 'even', 'best', 'HD', 'DVDs', 'excellent', 'most', 'will', 'not', 'notice', 'improvement', 'standard', 'DVD', 'view', 'side-by-side', 'HD', 'DVD', 'player', 'purchase', 'difficult', 'justify', 'lower', 'picture', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'combined', 'much', 'higher', 'player', 'price', 'even', 'harder', 'justify', 'will', 'keep', 'getting', 'Blu-Ray', 'can', 'least', 'match', 'HD', 'DVD', 'quality']",N/A

770652,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0000B1OFL,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 3]","F. Gary Gray's ""The Italian Job"" (2003) is a glossy, pretty update of an earlier movie.  If ""Ocean's Eleven"" hadn't been exquisitely remade in 2001 by Steven Soderbergh, George Clooney, and assorted other stars, ""The Italian Job"" might have been able to stand on its own two feet.  Unfortunately, it looks like a poor knock-off job where Mark Wahlberg unsuccessfully tries to be another Danny Ocean, but lacks the gravitas of either Clooney or the original Ocean, Frank Sinatra.One thing about this movie is undeniable, and that is that it looks great.  From the opening scenes of a clever heist in Venice to a double-cross on a chilly Alpine dam to a car chase through L.A. to the glorious lines of Charlize Theron's face, ""The Italian Job"" is one of the best-looking crime movies you'll ever see.  Unfortunately, beauty carries a movie only so far - ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is another movie that looks uber-gorgeous, but nobody's going to eagerly await the 10th-anniversary edition of that DVD, are they?Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, who starts the film as the heir apparent to the role of leader of a gang of lovable thieves, now that former leader John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is stepping down.  Croker leads his team through the successful ""Italian job,"" which is a clever heist involving swiping a huge safe from a Venetian mansion using explosives, scuba gear, and a very fast boat.But in a plot twist that the promotional ads gave away, the Italian Job goes bad when Steve (Ed Norton) double-crosses the team and leaves them for dead, swiping $35 million in gold ingots.  (As an aside, is ""Steve"" really the name you want for your villain?  If the filmmakers were trying to make a comic point here, perhaps using the blandness of Steve to point out the over-the-top names of many movie villains, they were a bit too subtle.  Instead, ""Steve"" comes off like a first-draft name that they simply forgot to revisit.)Some time later, Croker and team track down Steve in L.A. and plan for a caper that would both bring back the millions they lost to Steve as well as a certain measure of vengeance.  To do this, they need a safe-cracker, and wouldn't you know it, the late Mr. Bridger left a lovely daughter Stella (the aforementioned Ms. Theron), who is a safe-cracker who works for the police when she isn't racking up speeding tickets.  But where dear old dad ""worked by instinct,"" Stella uses the best in modern technology to get the job done.  With that set-up, would you be surprised if there is a scene where Stella has to abandon her hi-tech gadgetry and crack a safe using nothing but her ""instincts""?  If you would be surprised by such a plot development, ""The Italian Job"" is probably going to be one of your favorite movies.And this is ultimately where ""Ocean's Eleven"" sinks ""The Italian Job.""  Both movies cover essentially the same ground (planning an incredibly complex and witty heist), but ""Ocean's Eleven"" does this so much better.  Both films involve teams of lovable criminals, but while you can't criticize Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Seth Greene of ""Italian Job,"" this ensemble can't hold a candle to ""Ocean's Eleven's"" ""supporting cast"" of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mack, Carl Reiner, and others.  I enjoy Ms. Theron's performance much more than Julia Roberts' turn in ""Ocean's Eleven,"" but it must be said that as far as the female leads are concerned, there are no losers here.Both films also spend a lot of time focusing on the intricate planning that goes into a major caper, but again ""Ocean's Eleven"" has a caper that is rich with surprise, wit, and humor.  The climactic heist in ""The Italian Job"" builds to, of all things, a car chase.  Sure, it's an amazing car chase, but if your movie is focusing on wit and humor, relying on a car chase to pull off the climax is a signal that the writers have given up.And finally, as much as I enjoy Ed Norton as an actor, you have to admit that his villain, Steve, can't hold a candle to the ominous refinement brought to the screen by Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict in ""Ocean's Eleven.""  Garcia injects such slick venom into his scenes that otherwise throwaway lines like his ""Terry"" - ""Danny"" exchange with Clooney take on a whole new life.  Ed Norton is a wonderful actor, but Steve just ain't that much of a bad guy -- he's so unoriginal that he spends his ill-gotten gains on the prizes that his other fellow criminals planned to purchase.  Translation -- Steve is an empty box, and empty boxes do not great villains make.Perhaps I'm getting long-winded for a three-star review.  I must confess I had high expectations for ""The Italian Job.""  But at the end of the day, all Wahlberg and crew (with the exception of Charlize Theron) did was make me want to go watch a better crime movie.",3,"Overly cheerful caper film lacks wit, but looks

770656,A3G8M1XWGVW9XX,B0000B1OFL,"shelley de lange ""avid reader""","[2, 3]","This movie does exactly what it sets out to do - entertain and show off the Mini Cooper. That's why I give it 5 stars - not because it's Oscar material, it's not trying to be, but because it accomplishes its goal with incredible surety and finesse. While parts of the plot have been done before, such as the master criminal who wants one last job before going straight and ends up dying, it never feels cliched. Everything about this movie gels.The basic plot is a crew of criminals pull off a job - without guns - stealing gold bars. One of them decides he wants the whole shebang and steals from his pals. A year later, they try to steal the money back.Donald Sutherland is wonderful as the master criminal mentor. Why does this actor not work more often? It's a real shame. He manages to be heartfelt, funny, wise and even sexy. A real star. Mark Whalberg underplays his straight-man part as the junior master criminal, and it's a good choice as the rest of his crew is very colorful, so he gives balance to the ensemble.Seth Green does what he does best - don't ever grow up, Seth! Jason Stratham, the British actor, has a chance to relax in a non-death/bullets everywhere type movie and reallly shines. When he turns on his mojo to ensnare the actress from The Man Show, you can practically smell his testosterone. Instead of hearing how he manages to charm his target, we get hysterical dialogue supplied by nerdy, woman-challenged Seth Green as he watches in admiration and frustration.Charlize Theron has never been spunkier or more vulnerable as the daughter of Sutherland. She drives fast and cracks million-dollar safes and makes it all very believable. Edward Norton is truly slimey - a crook with no imagination, who spends his ill-gotten gains on the very toys his betrayed comrades wished for, in effect, stealing from them twice.The director manages both his ensemble cast and the action with a deft touch. The movie never drags but instead has a nice varying dynamic from fast to slow to fast again. Unlike ""Oceans Eleven,"" things go wrong in this movie, plans are changed.The music is a nice blend of hard-pounding soundtrack and classic songs. The two chase scenes are very fun - the first being motorboats in Venice canals, the second of course the Mini Coopers driving through tunnels, by trains, up on sidewalks, and through aquaducts. The cars seem cooler than any of James Bond's by the end of the movie.Comparisons with ""Oceans Eleven"" and ""The Score"" are inevitable and I have to say I liked this movie better than either of them. ""The Score"" was tired, slow and pretty much boring, just really run of the mill. ""Oceans Eleven"" was fun, but it was a movie that showcased its stars. It was pure Hollywood, sterile, clean, no one really gets hurt and there's no hint of danger.This movie is grittier and shows not only the master criminals but the seamier side of crime such as the Ukrainian mobsters who make our mafia look like schoolchildren. Justice is certainly served by the end of the movie, but they very cannily leave it up to our imagination.This movie is definitely worth full price at the theaters, and worth seeing on the large screen.

Gary Gray for making such a good feature film when his directorial resume mostly consists of rapper videos. Gray's other most recent notable feature films were 2005's flop sequel to the classic Get Shorty (1995) and 2003's A Man Apart (which I have not seen).Storywise, The Italian Job really worked well. It had a good flow that kept you interested. There were way too many of the typical over the top Hollywood action film sequences that are just plain old unbelievable: cars driving down busy sidewalks at high speed; driving through a busy subway; people surviving sure-death situations; absolutely zero police response to what would realistically summon a cavalry of cops...these kinds of surreal action take a bit away from the movie.The cast is pretty good, and the acting is very good. The story is familiar enough as it is popular throughout the history of film: A heist is made by a group of thieves/one of the crooks goes rogue/the group seeks revenge.So if the genre is up your alley, then by all means The Italian Job should work for an evening of entertainment. And if you like it, you're in luck....A sequel has been announced for 2008 called The Brazilian Job with (mostly) the same cast and director (the most important aspects in a recipe for a successful sequel).Let's hope in the sequel that Gray keeps a better handle on reality.

If you're going to use the same title, names and gimmick and that's it then you have 2002's The Italian Job.This was a great opportunity to re-make a classic with enough sympathy and sufficient nods to the original to make it different yet retaining all the excitement and fun of the 1969 version but somewhere along the line all of this is missing. F Gary Gray may be a decent director however, in this movie at least, his talents are wasted.With a plot that you could drive umpteen Mini coopers through, the actors don't have much to play with here; for once Wahlberg is one-dimensional. I expected more from him after decent performances in The Perfect Storm amongst others. Theron is there as the eye-candy and little else. I cringed when Charlie (Wahlberg) asks her to join up with them and she refuses at first, only to reconsider later. This was so scripted that both my wife and I correctly guessed she'd initially say no, then it would cut to her thinking of her deceased father and then she'd call Charlie to tell him she's in and instantly hang up. We've seen this so many times, this must be in the mythical 'Rules of Drama' book that most Hollywood Producers each receive upon graduating from Film School.It's no coincidence that the film goes into a tailspin once Bridger (Donald Sutherland) dies early on. There's no substance here, it's just stunts, unlikely scenarios and unlikely set-up scenes for forthcoming plot turns (I mean, who calls the cable company as soon as you lose a signal - don't you fiddle with the cables, wires, check plugs etc? And when the cable 'girl' comes, do you expect her to start opening doors for some spurious reason?).The Mini Coopers ARE this movie.

770685,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0000B1OFL,trebe,"[1, 2]","Borrowing a few key elements, from the original 1969 film, the reworked version of The Italian Job (2003) is a slick, high tech affair that centers on revenge, rather than on executing an outrageously glorious theft, and bolstering national pride.In Venice, Italy, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) masterminds the theft of a cache of gold bars worth 35 million.  His team includes safecracker John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), point man Steve (Edward Norton), and electronics whiz Lyle (Seth Green). The heist goes smoothly, and the mood is celebratory, until Steve pulls a double cross, kills John Bridger, and the crew winds up trapped in an SUV, submerged under the ice of a frozen lake, dodging bullets.Moving forward a year, Croker discovers that Steve has surfaced in LA, going under the name of Steve Frazeli, and gathers his group together, to try and steal back the gold.  Needing a safecracker, he turns to Bridger's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron), who happens to open safes for a living.  The assembled team heads to California, to get the ""LA Job"" done.Edward Norton has a talent for playing obnoxious characters you love to hate, and the arrogant, sneering Frazeli, is the kind of vermin that deserves to be crushed like a roach.  The man does have a keen instinct for survival, and quickly moves his stash of gold, when he discovers that he is a target.  A swift closer of loose ends, he ruthlessly eliminates the Russian dealer who was exchanging his gold for cash.  With his hand forced, and the Ukrainian mafia poking around, Croker has to quickly adjust his plans, and make a completely different play.The original Italian Job, was about English criminal, who with the backing of the British underworld, makes a play to steal a delivery of gold from the Fiat Company in Turin, Italy.  Remarkably, few connected with the 2003 update, seemed familiar with the 1969 classic.  The newer film is not a remake, or an adaptation, it is more of mutation, grabbing a few selected strands of original DNA material, and adding some high tech elements, purely American sensibilities, and coming out with something completely different.  Prior to being commissioned to do the screenplay, the writers for the update, had also never even seen the original film.  The few key story elements that migrate to the new film include, stolen gold bars, three mini cooper automobiles, looting an armored car, and the manipulation of traffic control systems.With Croker, Bridger and Left Ear, being predominantly behind the wheel, the mini Coopers are prominently featured, on the streets, and in subway tunnels, and the storm drain systems of Los Angeles.  It's a short, but pretty cool ride, with Frazeli following the action from above, in a helicopter.  The ending is PG-13 soft, without the satisfaction of seeing old Steve pounded down like a nail, and the gang finally getting to enjoy their ill gotten gains.  They say it wasn't about the money, but it that just doesn't ring very true.  The film could be much edgier, but things flow so smoothly for the gang, that there is never a feeling of real danger.  And the writing is not as clever as it thinks it is.There is no commentary track, but the bonus featurettes cover the usual making of topics, plus things like the participants lack of familiarity with the original film, the writing of the screenplay, the stunts, and the driving training that the cast went through.  An ultracompetitive Theron, evidently had great enthusiasm for the driving.  Co-writers Donna and Wayne Powers seem extremely pleased with their screenplay, and how it was executed.  That the original film was almost completely gutted, matters not.  Interestingly, no interviews with Edward Norton appear in the featurettes.Although far from a homage to the original film, for what it is, ""The LA Job"" is a very slick, bold, fast moving, if superficial, action thriller, that mostly entertains.  F. Gary Gray is apparently hands on director, who does have a flair for capturing action.  The acting is not bad for a film of this type, with Wahlberg, Norton, and Theron being quite solid.  Jason Statham, who is capable of much, much more, is an underused team player, and Donald Sutherland's appearance is brief, but impactful.",3,"mildly inspired by the original, should be called The LA Job . . .",1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,4329,"['Borrowing', 'few', 'key', 'elements', 'original', '1969', 'film', 'reworked', 'version', 'Italian', 'Job', '2003', 'slick', 'high', 'tech', 'affair', 'revenge', 'rather', 'executing', 'outrageously', 'glorious', 'theft', 'bolstering', 'national', 'pride.In', 'Venice', 'Italy', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'theft', 'cache', 'gold', 'bars', 'worth', '35', 'million', 'team', 'safecracker', 'John', 'Bridger', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'driver', 'Handsome', 'Rob', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'expert', 'Left', 'Ear', 'Mos', 'Def', 'point', 'man', 'Steve', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'electronics', 'whiz', 'Lyle', 'Seth', 'Green', 'heist', 'smoothly', 'mood', 'celebratory', 'Steve', 'double', 'cross', 'John', 'Bridger', 'crew', 'up', 'trapped', 'SUV', 'submerged', 'ice', 'frozen', 'lake', 'dodging', 'bullets.Moving', 'forward', 'year', 'Croker', 'Steve', 'surfaced', 'LA', 'going', 'name', 'Steve', 'Frazeli', 'gathers', 'group', 'together', 'try', 'steal', 'back', 'gold', 'Needing', 'safecracker', 'Bridger', 'daughter', 'Stella', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'who', 'open', 'safes', 'living', 'assembled', 'team', 'heads', 'California', 'get', 'LA', 'Job', 'done.Edward', 'Norton', 'talent', 'playing', 'obnoxious', 'characters', 'love', 'hate', 'arrogant', 'sneering', 'Frazeli', 'kind', 'vermin', 'be', 'crushed', 'roach', 'man', 'have', 'keen', 'instinct', 'survival', 'quickly', 'stash', 'gold', 'when', 'target', 'swift', 'closer', 'loose', 'ends', 'ruthlessly', 'Russian', 'dealer', 'who', 'was', 'exchanging', 'gold', 'cash', 'hand', 'forced', 'Ukrainian', 'mafia', 'poking', 'around', 'Croker', 'quickly', 'adjust', 'plans', 'make', 'completely', 'different', 'play.The', 'original', 'Italian', 'Job', 'was', 'English', 'criminal', 'who', 'backing', 'British', 'underworld', 'play', 'steal', 'delivery', 'gold', 'Fiat', 'Company', 'Turin', 'Italy', 'Remarkably', 'few', 'connected', '2003', 'update', 'seemed', 'familiar', '1969', 'classic', 'newer', 'film', 'not', 'remake', 'adaptation', 'more', 'mutation', 'grabbing', 'few', 'selected', 'strands', 'original', 'DNA', 'material', 'adding', 'high', 'tech', 'elements', 'purely', 'American', 'sensibilities', 'coming', 'out', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'Prior', 'being', 'commissioned', 'do', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'update', 'had', 'also', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'few', 'key', 'story', 'elements', 'migrate', 'new', 'film', 'include', 'stolen', 'gold', 'bars', 'three', 'mini', 'cooper', 'automobiles', 'looting', 'armored', 'car', 'manipulation', 'traffic', 'control', 'systems.With', 'Croker', 'Bridger', 'Left', 'Ear', 'being', 'predominantly', 'wheel', 'mini', 'Coopers', 'are', 'prominently', 'featured', 'streets', 'subway', 'tunnels', 'storm', 'drain', 'systems', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'short', 'pretty', 'cool', 'ride', 'Frazeli', 'following', 'action', 'helicopter', 'ending', 'PG-13', 'soft', 'satisfaction', 'seeing', 'old', 'Steve', 'pounded', 'down', 'nail', 'gang', 'finally', 'getting', 'enjoy', 'ill', 'gotten', 'gains', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'money', 'just', ""n't"", 'ring', 'very', 'true', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'edgier', 'things', 'flow', 'so', 'smoothly', 'gang', 'never', 'feeling', 'real', 'danger', 'writing', 'not', 'as', 'clever', 'commentary', 'track', 'bonus', 'cover', 'usual', 'making', 'topics', 'things', 'participants', 'lack', 'familiarity', 'original', 'film', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'stunts', 'driving', 'training', 'cast', 'went', 'ultracompetitive', 'Theron', 'evidently', 'had', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'driving', 'Co-writers', 'Donna', 'Wayne', 'Powers', 'seem', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'screenplay', 'how', 'was', 'executed', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'gutted', 'matters', 'not', 'Interestingly', 'interviews', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'appear', 'featurettes.Although', 'far', 'homage', 'original', 'film', 'what', 'LA', 'Job', 'very', 'slick', 'bold', 'fast', 'moving', 'superficial', 'action', 'thriller', 'mostly', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'apparently', 'hands', 'director', 'who', 'have', 'flair', 'capturing', 'action', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'type', 'Wahlberg', 'Norton', 'Theron', 'being', 'quite', 'solid', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'who', 'capable', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'underused', 'team', 'player', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'appearance', 'brief', 'impactful']",N/A

770688,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000B1OFL,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","After that dreadful remake called (For""Get Carter""), another Michael Caine film is brought from the vault.  Mr. Caine himself in one interview made it clear that he is very proud of the original film made in 1969, and I am sure he will not be so sad after watching this slickly done remake.The new story itself is loosely connected with the original, so let's stop saying 'remake? not again' and see this one as a well-crafted heist movie.  The premise is surprisingly simple.  One heist in Venice leads to double-crossing, and after one year the betrayed thieves get a chance for revenge in Los Angels.  The film features gripping sequences of stealing a big heavy safe, wild motor-boat ride (that must have scared the people in Venice) and car chase of three Mini-Coopers, which literally steals the show with very useful agility.Actors are all good, but all typecast, so you can tell who is the traitor or who got killed while watching the opening credits.  Two names might attract you such as Mark Wahlberg as Charlie, nominal leader of the group, and Charlize Theron as Stella who decides to break the law for her personal reasons, but it is supporting actors like computer-wizard Seth Green or Jason 'Handson Rob' Statham that really impress you with unexpectedly comical turns.  You also see Edward Norton, Mos Def, Franky G, and ubiquitous Donald Sutherland.  Michael Caine does not appear himself, probably because of his regret of having done it in ""Carter,"" but it does not mean that he is all gone from the film.  Try to spot 'him.'The greatest value of the film lies in F. Gary Gray's skillful handling of the characters, and his proficient staging of actions, especially the ones using three Mini-Coopers.  But why Mini-Coopers, you might ask.  Like the original, these characters have to use them in the crutial scenes, so let's not say this is product placement.  Actually, you may say those cars running like daredevil are the true star of the film.",4,FUN RIDE: and That's What We Want,1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,1966,"['dreadful', 'remake', 'called', 'Get', 'Carter', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'film', 'brought', 'vault', 'Mr.', 'Caine', 'one', 'interview', 'made', 'clear', 'very', 'proud', 'original', 'film', 'made', '1969', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'sad', 'watching', 'slickly', 'done', 'remake.The', 'new', 'story', 'loosely', 'connected', 'original', 'let', 'stop', 'saying', ""'remake"", 'not', 'again', 'see', 'one', 'well-crafted', 'heist', 'movie', 'premise', 'surprisingly', 'simple', 'One', 'heist', 'Venice', 'double-crossing', 'one', 'year', 'betrayed', 'get', 'chance', 'revenge', 'Los', 'Angels', 'film', 'gripping', 'sequences', 'stealing', 'big', 'heavy', 'safe', 'wild', 'motor-boat', 'ride', 'must', 'have', 'scared', 'people', 'Venice', 'car', 'chase', 'three', 'Mini-Coopers', 'literally', 'show', 'very', 'useful', 'agility.Actors', 'are', 'good', 'typecast', 'can', 'tell', 'who', 'traitor', 'who', 'got', 'killed', 'watching', 'opening', 'credits', 'Two', 'names', 'might', 'attract', 'such', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Charlie', 'nominal', 'leader', 'group', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Stella', 'who', 'break', 'law', 'personal', 'reasons', 'supporting', 'actors', 'computer-wizard', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Jason', ""'Handson"", 'Rob', 'Statham', 'really', 'impress', 'unexpectedly', 'comical', 'turns', 'also', 'see', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Franky', 'G', 'ubiquitous', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'not', 'appear', 'probably', 'regret', 'having', 'done', 'Carter', 'not', 'mean', 'gone', 'film', 'Try', 'spot', ""'him"", 'greatest', 'value', 'film', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'skillful', 'handling', 'characters', 'proficient', 'staging', 'actions', 'especially', 'ones', 'using', 'three', 'Mini-Coopers', 'why', 'Mini-Coopers', 'might', 'ask', 'original', 'characters', 'have', 'use', 'crutial', 'scenes', 'let', 'not', 'say', 'product', 'placement', 'Actually', 'may', 'say', 'cars', 'running', 'daredevil', 'are', 'true', 'star', 'film']",N/A
770689,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0000B1OFL,Tucker Andersen,"[2, 3]","Several of the early Amazon reviews adequately describe this film (as does Stephen Holden's surprisingly favorable review in the...New York Times).....Thus, this review will not comment in detail on the plot or the cast, but instead will try to furnish some additional observations and some insights about the nature of this movie. This is a caper film for moviegoers who like action including the usual chase scenes (including speedboats through the Venice canals) combined with sophisticated technology and the usual quota of misdirection and complications to be overcome.  It actually opens with the initial heist of $35 million of gold bullion; the main elements involve the falling out of the conspirators and the plans for revenge and reclamation of the bullion after its subsequent theft.There is very little character development except for three of the conspirators. Donald Sutherland has a crucial but much too brief role for one of my favorite actors as John Bridger, an aging pro who is handing on his expertise to his young protege Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg). Edward Norton is almost perfect as the shallow Steve Frezelli, the member of the group who is in it solely for the money and is unfazed by any code of honor among thieves. (Almost like a reprise of his character in THE SCORE.)  In a great twist, he defines himself by his posseessions but can't even come up with anything original to purchase with the loot. Last, Seth Green is greaty as Lyle the techno-geek whose expertise is crucial to the robberies and who wants to be known as The Napster, since he claims that the Napster technology was stolen from him by his college roommate while he was taking a nap. The rest of the characters are quite well cast but pretty unidimensional, and the romantic elements are almost nonexistent but fortunately are not central to the story. A nice twist was the similarities in the methodology employed in the two major heists, and the use of technology was actually quite clever.My wife and I both enjoyed this movie more than we expected that we would, there are enough plots twists and misdirection to keep it enjoyable and as well as a reasonable amount of tension on occasion. We also thought that the use of the mini Coopers as in the original version with Michael Caine was both a nice touch and worked great both as a plot device and in the theft and chase finale. The one caveat that I would like to emphasize is the limited amount of character development. Thus, it is more like OCEANS ELEVEN in this respect, and less like the recently released THE GOOD THIEF. In this regard, it also stands in sharp contrast to three of my favorite films of this genre, THE SCORE with the wonderful roles and interaction of Brando and DeNiro (along with Angela Bassett's brief appearance) and both the original THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (Steve McQueen And Faye Dunaway) and the remake with Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo, which in all instances incorporated a great plot based on a heist but were about the characters and their goals, self images and relationships combined with an important romantic overlay. Thus, while this was a fun flick that will be enjoyable for an occasional viewing, it only deserves four stars in my opinion. Those three are all five star classics that should never grow stale.",4,A Fun Caper with some Great Action Scenes,1054684800,"06 4, 2003",2003,3309,"['Several', 'early', 'Amazon', 'adequately', 'describe', 'film', 'Stephen', 'Holden', 'surprisingly', 'favorable', 'review', 'New', 'York', 'Times', '..Thus', 'review', 'will', 'not', 'comment', 'detail', 'plot', 'cast', 'instead', 'will', 'try', 'furnish', 'additional', 'observations', 'insights', 'nature', 'movie', 'caper', 'film', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'action', 'including', 'usual', 'chase', 'scenes', 'including', 'speedboats', 'Venice', 'canals', 'combined', 'sophisticated', 'technology', 'usual', 'quota', 'misdirection', 'complications', 'be', 'overcome', 'actually', 'initial', 'heist', '35', 'million', 'gold', 'bullion', 'main', 'elements', 'involve', 'falling', 'conspirators', 'plans', 'revenge', 'reclamation', 'bullion', 'subsequent', 'very', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'three', 'conspirators', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'crucial', 'much', 'too', 'brief', 'role', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'John', 'Bridger', 'aging', 'pro', 'who', 'handing', 'expertise', 'young', 'protege', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'almost', 'perfect', 'shallow', 'Steve', 'Frezelli', 'member', 'group', 'who', 'solely', 'money', 'unfazed', 'code', 'honor', 'thieves', 'Almost', 'reprise', 'character', 'SCORE', 'great', 'twist', 'posseessions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'original', 'purchase', 'loot', 'Last', 'Seth', 'Green', 'greaty', 'Lyle', 'techno-geek', 'expertise', 'crucial', 'robberies', 'who', 'be', 'known', 'Napster', 'Napster', 'technology', 'was', 'stolen', 'college', 'roommate', 'was', 'taking', 'nap', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'cast', 'pretty', 'unidimensional', 'romantic', 'elements', 'are', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'fortunately', 'are', 'not', 'central', 'story', 'nice', 'twist', 'was', 'similarities', 'methodology', 'employed', 'two', 'major', 'heists', 'use', 'technology', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'clever.My', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'expected', 'would', 'are', 'enough', 'plots', 'twists', 'misdirection', 'keep', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'well', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'tension', 'occasion', 'also', 'thought', 'use', 'mini', 'Coopers', 'original', 'version', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'worked', 'great', 'plot', 'device', 'theft', 'chase', 'finale', 'one', 'caveat', 'would', 'like', 'emphasize', 'limited', 'amount', 'character', 'development', 'Thus', 'more', 'OCEANS', 'ELEVEN', 'respect', 'less', 'recently', 'released', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'THIEF', 'regard', 'also', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'three', 'favorite', 'films', 'genre', 'THE', 'SCORE', 'wonderful', 'roles', 'interaction', 'Brando', 'DeNiro', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'brief', 'appearance', 'original', 'THOMAS', 'CROWN', 'AFFAIR', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'remake', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Renee', 'Russo', 'instances', 'incorporated', 'great', 'plot', 'based', 'heist', 'were', 'characters', 'goals', 'self', 'images', 'relationships', 'combined', 'important', 'romantic', 'overlay', 'Thus', 'was', 'fun', 'flick', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'occasional', 'viewing', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'opinion', 'three', 'are', 'five', 'star', 'classics', 'should', 'never', 'grow', 'stale']",N/A

It's a pity that the film wasn't cast with an actor of Ed Norton's caliber in the role of Charlie Croker (played by Wahlberg. Norton can be quite a charming actor and it would have been interesting to see him in the role.  Like the horrible reimagined Planet of the Apes, The Italian Job isn't a remake as such but using the same basic dramatic situation to create a new, interesting and kinetic film.The plot has been pretty well summarized before but it hinges more on the revenge angle than the original film (if memory serves); Charlie Croker (Wahlberg)and his mentor's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron)are going after one of their own. Ed Norton plays Steve a member of their gang who steals from his friends and then bumps off the John Bridges the head of their gang (Donald Sutherland). Croker and Stella set up the ultimate scam/heist to get what was theirs to begin with and extract revenge for the murder.The latter part of the film is set in Los Angeles although the Mini-Cooper's so prominent in the original film still have more than a featured cameo. Turning the original film's basic plot on its head helps make this version a refreshing take on the original tale.F. Gary Gray's direction infuses the film with enough energy to fuel two films. His direction is crisp, sharp and usually on target. The cast he and the producers assembled (including the marvelous Seth Green)can, for the most part, more than hold their own against the Michael Caine's crew in the 1969 film. The only major drawback, again, is Wahlberg who is adequate but doesn't bring any charisma to the role. A better choice to cast in the film would have been George Clooney who at least has the wattage to light up the role.The widescreen transfer looks very, very good. I don't own but did get a glimpse of the fullscreen version as well and it looked fairly good as well. The extras include five featurettes on everything from the making of the film to the stunt driving. While there isn't a director's commentary (much less one from the cast), perhaps that's all for the better. It seems the action speaks for itself. You'll notice you can get both films as a two DVD set. If you're a fan of the original and have seen this version and liked it, then it might be a better way to go vs. buying them individually. Unfortunately, the two Jobs set doesn't include anything beyond what's on them individually, so the only benefit might be in saving a bit of money. While it's not a bus full of gold, The 2003 film packs enough thrills, chills and spills to make it worthwhile viewing if nothing else than for a rental.",4,Teaching an old plot new tricks,1065830400,"10 11, 2003",2003,2701,"['only', 'thing', 'wrong', 'Italian', 'Job', 'miscast', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'misused', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'pity', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'cast', 'actor', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'caliber', 'role', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'played', 'Wahlberg', 'Norton', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'charming', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'role', 'horrible', 'reimagined', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Italian', 'Job', ""n't"", 'remake', 'such', 'using', 'same', 'basic', 'dramatic', 'situation', 'create', 'new', 'interesting', 'kinetic', 'film.The', 'plot', 'been', 'pretty', 'well', 'summarized', 'more', 'revenge', 'angle', 'original', 'film', 'memory', 'serves', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'Wahlberg', 'mentor', 'daughter', 'Stella', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'are', 'going', 'one', 'own', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Steve', 'member', 'gang', 'who', 'friends', 'then', 'bumps', 'off', 'John', 'Bridges', 'head', 'gang', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Croker', 'Stella', 'set', 'up', 'ultimate', 'scam/heist', 'get', 'what', 'was', 'begin', 'extract', 'revenge', 'murder.The', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Mini-Cooper', 'so', 'prominent', 'original', 'film', 'still', 'have', 'more', 'featured', 'cameo', 'Turning', 'original', 'film', 'basic', 'plot', 'head', 'make', 'version', 'refreshing', 'take', 'original', 'tale.F', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'direction', 'film', 'enough', 'energy', 'fuel', 'two', 'films', 'direction', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'usually', 'target', 'cast', 'producers', 'assembled', 'including', 'marvelous', 'Seth', 'Green', 'can', 'most', 'part', 'more', 'hold', 'own', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'crew', '1969', 'film', 'only', 'major', 'drawback', 'again', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'adequate', ""n't"", 'bring', 'charisma', 'role', 'better', 'choice', 'cast', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'least', 'wattage', 'light', 'up', 'role.The', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'did', 'get', 'glimpse', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'well', 'looked', 'fairly', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'extras', 'include', 'five', 'featurettes', 'everything', 'making', 'film', 'stunt', 'driving', ""n't"", 'director', 'commentary', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'cast', 'perhaps', 'better', 'action', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'can', 'get', 'films', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', ""'re"", 'fan', 'original', 'have', 'seen', 'version', 'liked', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'way', 'go', 'vs.', 'buying', 'individually', 'Unfortunately', 'two', 'Jobs', 'set', ""n't"", 'include', 'anything', 'what', 'individually', 'only', 'benefit', 'might', 'be', 'saving', 'bit', 'money', 'not', 'bus', 'full', 'gold', '2003', 'film', 'packs', 'enough', 'thrills', 'chills', 'spills', 'make', 'viewing', 'nothing', 'else', 'rental']",N/A
