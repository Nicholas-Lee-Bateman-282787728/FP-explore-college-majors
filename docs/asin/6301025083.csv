There is nothing like watching Fellini spin his magic in one of his many classic works, and 8 1/2 is the finest of the lot.As with most of his best work, the film is virtually plotless and filled with scenes of great creative energy.  The film follows a movie director named Guido whose life is slowly spinning out of control while shooting his latest picture.  All manner of &quot;groupies&quot; and hangers on keep interrupting his life as does the crew, his mistress and wife.  On top of this, he faces a creative &quot;block&quot; and is disturbed by recurring nightmares, dreams and visions.This is a GREAT film, and as usual, Criterion has presented it in a very fine package.

243572,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6301025083,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 6]","Wow.  Wow.  Double Wow.  I was unsure what I was about to indulge myself in when I first picked up this film.  Foreign, Fellini, and Oscar were all that I knew about this mythological film.  I had read about it in books, read reviews of it on top ten lists, but never found myself in the same room as it.  I wanted to see this so passionately that when it arrived I immediately popped it into my player and began watching it.  What I witnessed was like a drug on the brain.  The images, the story, the sheer brilliance and force behind the crafty eye of Fellini brought me deeper into this film than any other I have seen.  This is not easy for me to say because I have seen tons of films in my lifetime, but this film really takes the cake.  The brilliant black and white photography, the powerful ear-gobbling music, and the acting - Marcello Mastroianni controls this film.  You cannot seem to get your eyes off his scenes.  All of these elements create an innovative, provocative film based loosely on the life of Fellini, but also about the competitive and dragging world of film creation.From the opening scene, the tone is set in this film.  As we see Guido (Mastroianni) trying to escape a smoking car while nobody tries to help, we are captured.  The senses are heightened, and claustrophobia sets in and never leaves throughout the rest of the film.  Fellini has trapped us into this character and is beginning our roller-coaster ride known as Guido's life.  As we meet the rest of the characters, that looming claustrophobia continues to stay with us.  We add to this grab bag of emotions the struggle that Guido has with women, the stress pressures of completing a film that he has no clue how to start.  The only idea he has deals with a large structure that seems to keep the producers at bay.  Couple with this his struggling childhood memories of women and the angry power of his wife.  It is hard not to be involved with Guido throughout the course of this film because of these intense emotions that Fellini has fed to us.Outside of the emotional aspects of this film, it is beautifully directed.  Fellini pulls no stops (nor does Criterion) in the creation of this film.  The music, the actors, and even the beauty of the random, chaotic scene works to perfection everytime.  This is not a film you can sit down and enjoy once, it is definitely one that needs to be played over and over again.  In the film Sideways, Giamatti's character talks about wine being ""never the same each time you drink it"".  Each sip produces a new flavor and even if you open another bottle of the same, it may not be able to replicate the same exact taste.  That is how I feel about this film.  The first time I watched it, I was oblivious to the surroundings and the sub-stories.  I was so engulfed with Guido that I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  If I were to watch 8  again, focusing on a different aspect, I am sure to see a different film than I originally saw.  That is the greatness of Fellini, he directs so that each time you watch you are constantly seeing something new.  I saw that with his film Juliet of the Spirits as well.  I am not as voiced in Fellini as I should be, but these two films have proved that I need to see more and more of his work.Finally, I would like to say that I enjoyed this film for a direct reason.  You don't see this technique used in many Hollywood films today, and I think that is why it caught my eye in Fellini's masterpiece.  You could be sitting in a room full of friends and family, and honestly each person in the room (as the final credits ran) would say that they saw a different film than what you thought.  It is like going into an art museum for the first time.  You can all look at the same visions, but it is how you perceive these visions that makes it a great piece of art.  Fellini did this with 8 .  I don't know if it was on purpose, or if he had a direct vision for some of the scenes, but when it was done there were several different thoughts about this film.  I guess what I am trying to say is that it creates conversation.  This isn't a film that you sit down, watch, and walk away without a word muttered through your lips.  This is a piece of art that will remain in your mind long after the film is over, causing questions to arise days, weeks, months after viewing.  I still ask questions about Guido's dream where the women from his past and present all live in the same house as him.  It is so deep and beautiful that it erupts with conversation daily.  I find that a great tool for grading films is how much conversation occurs after them.  Good or bad, if you can talk about it at lengths with friends, than you know you have something special on your hands.Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  While the ending was a bit confusing, I continued to think about it long after the film was over and came to realize that Fellini is a master of film.  I cannot wait to watch this film again, and again, and again.  It should have won for best film of the year in 1964, or at least for best director, but alas, I can live with the best Foreign Film of the year.  This film should be at or near the top of everyone's favorites list and should be served with an amazing red wine, an open mind, and good friends.  It is the perfect combination for this priceless film.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Accept me as I am.

243573,AAZRWLML88IZK,6301025083,A kids review,"[6, 7]","The conventional wisdom is that Federico Fellini went wrong when he abandoned realism for personal fantasy; that starting with ""La Dolce Vita"", his work ran wild through jungles of Freudian, Christian, sexual and autobiographical images. The precise observation in ""La Strada"" was the high point of his career, according to this view, and then he abandoned his neorealist roots. ""La Dolce Vita"" was bad enough, ""8 1/2"" was worse, and by the time he made ""Juliet of the Spirits"", he was completely off the rails. Then all is downhill, in a career that lasted until 1987, except for ""Amarcord"", with its memories of Fellini's childhood; that one is so charming that you have to cave in and enjoy it, regardless of theory.This conventional view is completely wrong. What we think of as Felliniesque comes to full flower in ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""8 1/2."" His later films, except for ""Amarcord,"" are not as good, and some are positively bad, but they are stamped with an unmistakable maker's mark. The earlier films, wonderful as they often are, have their Felliniesque charm weighted down by leftover obligations to neorealism.The critic Alan Stone, writing in the Boston Review, deplores Fellini's ""stylistic tendency to emphasize images over ideas."" I celebrate it. A filmmaker who prefers ideas to images will never advance above the second rank because he is fighting the nature of his art. The printed word is ideal for ideas; film is made for images, and images are best when they are free to evoke many associations and are not linked to narrowly defined purposes. Here is Stone on the complexity of ""8 1/2"": ""Almost no one knew for sure what they had seen after one viewing."" True enough. But true of all great films, while you know for sure what you've seen after one viewing of a shallow one.""8 1/2"" is the best film ever made about filmmaking. It is told from the director's point of view, and its hero, Guido, is clearly intended to represent Fellini. It begins with a nightmare of asphyxiation, and a memorable image in which Guido floats off into the sky, only to be yanked back to earth by a rope pulled by his associates, who are hectoring him to organize his plans for his next movie. Much of the film takes place at a spa near Rome, and at the enormous set Guido has constructed nearby for his next film, a science fiction epic he has lost all interest in.The film weaves in and out of reality and fantasy. Some critics complained that it was impossible to tell what was real and what was taking place only in Guido's head, but I have never had the slightest difficulty, and there is usually a clear turning point as Guido escapes from the uncomfortable present into the accommodating world of his dreams.Sometimes the alternate worlds are pure invention, as in the famous harem scene where Guido rules a house occupied by all of the women in his life--his wife, his mistresses, and even those he has only wanted to sleep with. In other cases, we see real memories that are skewed by imagination. When little Guido joins his schoolmates at the beach to ogle the prostitute Saraghina, she is seen as the towering, overpowering, carnal figure a young adolescent would remember. When he is punished by his priests of his Catholic school, one entire wall is occupied by a giant portrait of Dominic Savio, a symbol of purity in that time and place; the portrait, too large to be real, reflects Guido's guilt that he lacks the young saint's resolve.All of the images come together into one of the most tightly structured films Fellini made. The screenplay is meticulous in its construction--and yet, because the story is about a confused director who has no idea what he wants to do next, ""8 1/2"" itself is often described as the flailings of a filmmaker without a plan. ""What happens,"" asks a Web-based critic, ""when one of the world's most respected directors runs out of ideas, and not just in a run-of-the-mill kind of way, but whole hog, so far that he actually makes a film about himself not being able to make a film?"" But ""8 1/2"" is not a film about a director out of ideas--it is a film filled to bursting with inspiration. Guido is unable to make a film, but Fellini manifestly is not.Mastroianni plays Guido as a man exhausted by his evasions, lies and sensual appetites. He has a wife, chic and intellectual, who he loves but cannot communicate with, and a mistress, cheap and tawdry, who offends his taste but inflames his libido. He manages his affairs so badly that both women are in the spa town at the same time, along with his impatient producer, his critical writer, and uneasy actors who hope or believe they will be in the film. He finds not a moment's peace. ""Happiness,"" Guido muses late in the film, ""consists of being able to tell the truth without hurting anyone."" That gift has not been mastered by Guido's writer, who tells the director his film is ""a series of complete senseless episodes,"" and ""doesn't have the advantage of the avant-garde films, although it has all of the drawbacks.""Guido seeks advice. Aged clerics shake their heads sadly and inspire flashbacks to childhood guilt. The writer, a Marxist, is openly contemptuous of his work. Doctors advise him to drink mineral water and get rest, a lot of rest. The producer begs for quick rewrites; having paid for the enormous set, he insists that it be used. And from time to time Guido visualizes his ideal woman, who is embodied by Claudia Cardinale: cool, comforting, beautiful, serene, uncritical, with all the answers and no questions. This vision, when she appears, turns out to be a disappointment, but in his mind he transforms her into a Muse, and takes solace in her imaginary support.Fellini's camera is endlessly delighting. His actors often seem to be dancing rather than simply walking. I was interested to read that he played music during every scene. The music must have brought a lift and subtle rhythm to their movements. Of course many scenes have music built into them: In ""8 1/2,"" orchestras, dance bands and strolling musicians are seen, and the actors move in a subtly choreographed way, as if they're synchronized. Fellini's scores, by Nino Rota, combine snatches of pop tunes with dance music, propelling the action.Few directors make better use of space. One of his favorite techniques is to focus on a moving group in the background and track with them past foreground faces that slide in and out of frame. He also likes to establish a scene with a master shot, which then becomes a closeup when a character stands up into frame to greet us. Another technique is to follow his characters as they walk, photographing them in three-quarter profile, as they turn back toward the camera. And he likes to begin dance sequences with one partner smiling invitingly toward the camera before the other partner joins in the dance.All of these moves are brought together in his characteristic parades. Inspired by a childhood love of the circus, Fellini used parades in all his films--not structured parades but informal ones, people moving together toward a common goal or to the same music, some in the foreground, some farther away. ""8 1/2"" ends with a parade that has deliberate circus overtones, with a parade of musicians, major characters, and the grotesques, eccentrics and ""types"" that Fellini loved to cast in his films.I have seen ""8 1/2"" over and over again, and my appreciation only deepens. It does what is almost impossible: Fellini is a magician who discusses, reveals, explains and deconstructs his tricks, while still fooling us with them. He claims he doesn't know what he wants or how to achieve it, and the film proves he knows exactly, and rejoices in his knowledge.",5,8 1/2,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,7697,"['conventional',

With ""8 1/2"" happens something very interesting, there are some scenes that are almost incomprehensible, but they are very interesting to see, because since the movie offers few explanations, the audience must be thinking most of the time, trying to solve the puzzle, so ""8 1/2"" requires an active audience.The cast is very good, the obvious mentions are Marcello Mastroianni and the gorgeous actress Claudia Cardinale, but Anouk Aim&eacute;e (as Luisa, the central character's wife) is another highlight in the cast. ""8 1/2"" presents some of Fellini's trademarks: there are a lot of surreal scenes that look like a complicated dream, or a nightmare if you wish. The use of the camera is very artistic and groundbreaking. And the pace is slow, but captivating.From the opening scene, a mysterious and beautiful dream-like sequence, to the final scene, ""8 1/2"" is an intelligent and insightful movie. Fellini carefully introduces the viewer inside the mind and thoughts of Guido, his fears, passions and insecurities, making Guido a very complex character.

I've heard people say this is Fellini's masterpiece. I've even been told by some, that this is one of the greatest films ever made! I don't think this is Fellini's masterpiece, to me that title belongs to &quot;Nights Of Cabiria&quot;. And as for stating that this is one of the greatest movies ever filmmed, it just may as well be. Marcello Mastroianni stars as what we suspect to be a thin disguise of Fellini himself. He just can't seem to think of an ending for his new movie. After having dreams about flying over cars, due to his feeling &quot;closed in&quot; he is taken to a hospital where he can get some rest. Later he meets his wife at a train station. But, none of this is really important, I feel to the story. These aren't really the moment we remember about this film. It's those moments where Mastroianni's mind drifts. The scene where he meets his parents at the deserted area, or him thinking back to when he was a child, and meet a whore. It was these scene we become so taken with. Some might have a hard time getting everything in their very first viewing, and therefor my not like the film. I myself had to watch it twice. Truly a landmark film by Fellini, which won him (I believe) his first Oscar. If you enjoy this movie, I suggest &quot;La Stada&quot;, &quot;The White Shiek&quot;, &quot;Nights Of Cabiria&quot;, and &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;.

It is one of the greatest movies ever, and you will find countless reviews by movie critics and historians much more qualified than I am to confirm it. 8 1/2 is Fellini at his best: poetic, funny, deep, entertaining, meaningful. Both music and photography are absolutedly great. Not an easy film to watch, but one that you will remember, even if you find it at times strange and/or confusing.But now let us come to the DVD. The quality of the picture and of the sound are excellent, and the translation is very accurate (I am Italian). The commentary is one of the best I had the opportunity to listen to in a Criterion Collection. Very very informative. The extra material on the second disc is excellent. ""Fellini: A Director's Notebook"" is a very funny and interesting portrait of Fellini. The documentary on Nino Rota (the composer of so many of Fellini's music, and much else) is wonderful. The interview with Sandra Milo (""Carla"") is splendid, and very sweet and touching. It tells very good things about her. The interviews with Lina Wertmuller, and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro are also very interesting, and not the silly and empty 10-minutes interviews that you find too often included as extra material in DVD nowadays.Overall, an excellent DVD for a movie that justly made movie history.

243578,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301025083,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Federico Fellini's `8 ' is a film about film.  It carries the very essence of art in it's most entrancing form and delivers a beautiful interpretation of the glories as well as the tragedies of creating that said art.  I think that may be why `8 ' is considered to be one of the finest films ever made, because it truly fleshes out the angels and demons involved in getting a directors vision off the ground.  It attacks the distress and anguish over desiring to create something meaningful and original without turning your good name into a disgrace by inventing a flop.  Thanks to a very strong and honest performance by Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni, `8 ' becomes something real and beautiful.Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, an Italian director who is trying to escape pressure to start his next film.  While supposedly resting at a spa he finds himself bombarded by critics and producers and actresses, all wanting to know what his next film is going to be about, what their roles are going to be and when they can expect to start shooting.  The problem is that Guido can't decide what his next film should be about.  He wants to create something beautiful, something strong and meaningful but his ideas are not coming as richly as he would like.  Guido cannot seem to find solace outside of work with his wife and even his mistress giving him grief on a personal level and so Guido finds himself retreating into his mind, concocting dream sequences that prove to be the greatest inspiration for his next film.It is also within these dreams that we come to know who Guido really his.  We see segments from his childhood, fictionalized to create a dream world in which he is free to explore the facets of his life that helped shape the man, the director, the artist that he is today.  To me, the opening scene alone is what defines the final feeling I was left with at the movies end.  The scene, involving Guido trapped inside a car filling with fumes, cars surrounding him at all sides, his constant screams and pleadings going unanswered, unnoticed even express the struggle one has to undergo in order to create their vision; pressure building from all sides to conform and sell-out and give in to the demands of others.The acting here is superb, truly elevating this film to masterpiece levels of greatness.  Marcello Mastroianni is marvelous as Guido, really getting into his soul and fleshing out his ever feeling; from distress and desperation to a giddy gleefulness that comes from becoming a part of his vision.  Anouk Aimee is effective as Luisa, Guido's troubled wife.  Her face reads many layers of pain and heartache.  Sandra Milo is superbly cast as Carla, Guido's mistress.  She is charming and funny and full of life; a nice contrast to the cold etched on Mastroianni's face.  Claudia Cardinale is a dream as Guido's muse Claudia, an actress who tends to be almost too demanding for Guido's taste.  Barbara Steele is intriguing as Gloria, the fianc&eacute;e of Guido's good friend Mario and Mario Pisu is impressive as that good friend.  All involved, the ones mentioned as well as each and every other supporting actor, are wonderfully cast and only add to the films greatness.What I love about `8 ' is the fact that it allows the audience to appreciate what goes into creating the films we all love to watch.  In fact, I think that `8 ' is a film that any lover of film must witness for it completes the obsession so-to-speak, giving us a chance to live the life of the ones responsible for giving us these gifts in film.  It has been noted that `8 ' is somewhat of an autobiographical film for Fellini, and it truly possesses an honesty that could only come from experience.  As the film draws to a close one is forced to face the fear of creating something below you, while confronting the heartbreak that comes from abandoning something you truly treasure because of fear of outside interpretation.I couldn't help but see a likeness to Woody Allen when watching this movie.  It had that same sort of dramedy vibe that Allen seems to capture (granted I have not seen a lot of Allen's films but it's undeniable the similarities).  The film never seems dated or irrelevant.  The rich black and white tones are beautifully captured and displayed for the audience, and the cinematography, score and set design (including the costumes) are all top notch.  `8 ' could have been made last year, it is that beautifully constructed.  Rightfully winning the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (and rightfully garnering Fellini a directing nomination), `8 ' is one of the greatest films I've had the pleasure of witnessing.  Named by many as one of the top 50 films of all time, I truly feel that `8 ' is actually one of the most important films of all time, for it allows the public to crawl inside their obsession with film and understand the makings of cinema all to a greater degree.",5,Beautifully honest depiction of ones struggle to create...,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,4899,"['Federico', 'Fellini', '8', 'film',

What is really unraveling is his life, and the film includes some very funny scenes about the toll the labor is taking on him.Fellini makes it tough in my opinion to determine which scenes are occurring in real life and which scenes are all in the character's head. But I think that's the point, it's about discovering how easy our desires intersect with reality, and how we struggle to survive in the midst of the two.I think this film requires more than one viewing to understand everything that is going on. I think that will turn some viewers away because it can be a bit frustrating to watch this film the first time.

In a wonderful blend of reality, flashback, and pure fantasy (the last two sometimes indistinguishable) we explore the director's dilemma: actors and actresses are waiting for auditions; the producer hounds him; his writer (actually his alter ego) keeps telling him the script is empty and pointless, the project a waste of time (this ironic character, played by Jean Rougeul, is a marvelous creation). Also there is his wife (Anouk Aimee), who no longer can stand his philandering.The flashbacks/fantasies are very funny, especially the one in which he imagines all the women in his life make up a willing harem. The only fault with the movie is the last five minutes where Mastroianni concludes he can't procrastinate any longer, and that making pictures is his life and he must get on with it regardless of the failures: it's all much too preachy and cheap. Actually, the movie should have ended in the car with Rougeul lecturing him on the uselessness of his work: that would've been perfect.

You can be guaranteed a fantastic film if you haven't seen this yet.As far as the BD itself, the transfer is absolutely fantastic!  The DVD version itself already had a pretty pristine transfer, but of course with the BD upgrade the resolution and detail is so much better, and of course comes loaded with extras and an accompanying booklet that is actually quite thorough and should be considered an item in itself, and not just a supplement to the disc.I haven't watched them all, but the extras that are bundled with the film are plentiful and quite informative.  Often times with extras you feel as though it is just filler and fodder (let's be honest, it usually is) but at least Criterion makes a conscious effort to make it interesting.  I'd say the extras are worthwhile, and also an upgrade from the DVD version.The biggest difference I noticed from my first viewing is that the subtitles are slightly changed from the DVD version, and also theatrically.  There are probably lots of different translations, but it IS different from the DVD but not drastically.  The same point is made, but just using a different delivery.  Not sure how I feel about some of the changes, but I probably just got used to the previous translation.I'm not sure where some of these discrepancies or complaints are coming from that have surfaced recently, but my copy was packaged in the special made Criterion jewel cases, NOT the cardboard ones, and of course not the actual blue ones.  For a while, with some of the earlier releases, Criterion was releasing its BDs in cardboard slip case and digi-pack format which angered a lot of customers who spoke their voice and got them to upgrade to the now standard jewel cases.  A good move in my opinion, but now I'm stuck with Third Man and 400 Blows in cardboard.  Reportedly, you can send in the old cases to get upgraded to new ones, but it'll cost you 5 bucks each, so...

But it is not just the most brilliantly vivid visual film I've seen, it is indeed brilliantly conceived from beginning to end as well.Guido is a film director who is struggling with his latest film. He's dealing with inner conflict - how to make a film with complex ideas come across simplistically so anybody can understand it - but also conflict with just about everyone else who is involved in the film, from actors to producers to professional Catholic consultants. On top of all of this, his wife knows that he's unfaithful and their relationship is ready to implode (or explode).The plot is simple. The execution is complex, as director Federico Fellini shifts freely between the real and surreal, mixing and matching the outer world of Guido with the inner, in order to draw the viewer into the madness that is filmmaking.I won't pretend to have understood everything that happened in the movie, and I'm not sure I would still pick up on everything after five or ten viewings, but I think the film works as an experience that doesn't necessarily need to make complete sense.

They can result in some interesting themes and scenes for the film, but often, most manifestly in the Saraghina and Cardinal digressions, they make far too much of points that could more easily and poetically been conveyed onscreen. Both of these motivs waste a good twenty or more minutes of the film's running time....As for the famed narrative- or meta-narrative. Let me give a brief rundown of what 8 is about. The film opens with shots of 43 year old married filmmaker Guido Anselmi in a traffic jam. It is obviously a dream sequence- or is it a scene from the film that he is to make, the one this film is about? It is clearly a set piece, and after escaping from his car window, as if from the uterus, he takes to the air, and becomes a kite, pulled back down to earth by whom we later recognize as the filmic representatives of Claudia Cardinale (playing herself), the actress who is to star in Guido's film within this film. As he falls to earth he wakens at a health spa where he is recuperating from a breakdown of some sort, along with his screenwriter, a dense film critic named Daumier (Jean Rougeul). Outside the spa he has a vision of a virginal white clad goddess, also played by Claudia Cardinale- although she is a separate character from the Claudia Cardinale who later appears as an actress in 8. She manifestly represents an idealized vision of love and femininity to Guido. Daumier then criticizes Guido's ideas for his upcoming film as immature and self-indulgent, as Fellini obviously is striking the first blows for his film's claim to greatness.He then spots Mario Mezzabotta (Mario Pisu), an old friend who is squiring around a dark, sexy young American girl he intends to marry. Her name is Gloria Morin (Barbara Steele, Mario Bava's horror film diva). Guido then heads to the train station to meet his gauche and buffoonish married mistress Carla (Sandra Milo). He already regrets asking her to come, until that night they play a game of hooker and john, and she eagerly plays her naughty role to sexual perfection. Guido falls asleep and dreams of his parents at a cemetery, His father (Annibale Ninchi) is dead, and his mother (Guiditta Rissone) kisses him lasciviously, then pulls back to reveal it is his wife, Luisa (Anouk Aim&eacute;e). Later, Guido tries to avoid movie types and reporters who are after the story of what his next film will be about. Some entertainment ensues at the hotel, and Guido is reminded of a mysterious childish saying from his past, asa nisi masa. This nonsense phrase is the film's equivalent of Citizen Kane's Rosebud. How this all turns out is well known and detailed by others.Incidentally, there is some confusion over why the film is called what it is called. The truth is that the film's final title 8 refers to the number of films Fellini directed to that point- six features, two short () films, and his first film, half a feature, Luci del Varieta, which he co-directed with Alberto Lattuada, thus totaling 7 films. This was therefore his 8th film. As for the critical reception and continuing misconstruals this film receives, both positive and negative, it is easy to see why. Much of this confusion is recapitulated in the film's original title La Bella Confusione (The Beautiful Confusion). It is not clear whether or not this internal artistic confusion was genuine, in Fellini's case, but it does not matter to his puppet, Guido Anselmi, for intent is meaningless in art. The end result is all, always all. Thus, 8  is a weird m&eacute;lange of Freudian pop nonsense (id, ego, superego), and Salvador Dal&igrave; lite imagery, that badly dates the film intellectually. All of it is well handled, in beautiful black and white cinematography by Gianni de Venanzo, with an intriguing and well-placed musical score by Nino Rota, to enhance the artificiality of it all, but all the personal references, which in the film do little to enhance an understanding of Guido, even as they may lend obsessive critics insight into Fellini's life, drag the film down by its own overblown heft....8 improves with rewatching, but it's still too long, filled with clumsy satire- Saraghina and the Cardinal, pointless digressions, and the like.",4,"Classic, but not quite

243595,A315K47GRB024C,6301025083,Daniel C. Markel,"[4, 6]","This review is for the 2001 Criterion DVD.The movie '8-1/2' is allegedly an ""artistic"" autobiography of Federico Fellini's life as a director.  The essence of the film is that a director named Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) has started making a movie but has lost his creative energy.  As a means of finding inspiration, Guido goes to an Italian health spa but is still tormented by his producer, auditioning actors and even an intellectual critic who all put great demands on Guido's time, energy and thought.  Guido escapes his peers by having an affair with a trashy mistress in another part of town but is later joined by his embittered wife a few days afterward.The movie has plenty of abstract allegories, childhood flashbacks, present day issues and even some very restrained sexual fantasies about women.  The movie reveals that Guido is torn in so many directions.  When he has an affair, he is immediately conflicted as a Roman Catholic, as a husband, and as a son of morally upstanding parents.  We also see where his infidelity has damaged his marriage - perhaps beyond repair.  Finally, he also finds that the perfect woman doesn't turn out of be perfect after all.  Eventually the film becomes a movie within a movie.  He wants to make an honest film but is so saturated in the conflict and tormoil of life.  Guido finally liberates himself when he realizes that the beautiful confusion of life is what needs to be celebrated on film.The movie at times is difficult to follow - especially since much of the abstract artistry is so ambiguous.  But I found the characters very engrossing and early 1960's Italy a fascinating and fashionable setting.  The most of the women in this movie are very beautiful and alluring while the rest had immeasurable entertainment value.  The men are typically very animated and complex.  I was never bored with any of the scenes, but as an art film, I can't say that I was inspired or moved by this picture.  I thoroughly enjoy the energy  of the Italian culture and this film certainly revealed much of it.  The B&W; cinematography was top-notch and the music has typically festive and quite enjoyable.  This is a movie that is clearly not for everyone and I'll be the first to admit that on an artistic level I think it's just OK for me.  But at the same time, I think this is a movie everyone needs to experience just once to have some appreciation and understanding for Italian neo-realism films.  I've watched this movie now five times and I still get new insights with each viewing.  The commentary is somewhat helpful but at times does not fully explain Fellini's true intent of some of the artistic episodes.  Perhaps, that's the way he intended it - to mean what you want it to mean.The DVD is a stunning B&W; widescreen transfer and the sound is excellent.  There are plenty of extras in this double DVD package.

243596,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6301025083,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[31, 38]","Semi-autobiographical self-analysis mixed with fantasies in a movie?  It worked for Fellini to the point that it yielded him his third Oscar for best foreign film, the other two being La Strada and La Dolce Vita.  It's a unique testament to his vision.The opening scene itself is memorable.  In it, Guido Anselmi is inside a car surrounded by traffic.  He tries to get out but can't, frantically rapping on the window, unable to breathe.  The occupants of the other cars stare expressionlessly at him.  It's a brilliant symbol of the oppression of society and conformity.  The allegory continues with him soaring into the sky and being a human kite, after which authority orders him to be brought back down to earth instead of being in the clouds.  How repressive!Guido is a film director in his stride who's onto a rough start with his current project.  Yet his collaborator Daumier finds several flaws.  There is no fundamental guiding principle, no philosophical premise, and ambiguous intention.  One thing that Guido wants for sure is an angelic woman dressed in white, symbolizing innocence, purity, and salvation.  Ironically, in the end, it is she identifies his problem for him.  The reason why there isn't a coherent project going on is that the movie is more scenes from Guido's childhood, and many of those are played throughout the film.  He wants to make a film that is honest, helpful to everyone, and that will bury everything dead in everyone.  But does he really have anything to say?  In the meantime, he is hounded by his producer to stick to schedule, hire actors, and start shooting.He also has a mistress Carla, who's extravagant, sexy, a bit loquacious, being at an impasse in his marriage to Luisa.  But it's the fantasy-world and the past that he retreats to in times of stress that's the real wonder here.  We learn of his encounter with the hefty and sensuous Saraghina, who lives on the beach and who teaches the local Catholic school kids forbidden dances.  The scene of having his own harem, full of the women whom he has encountered, is nothing more than a big booster shot to his male ego.  I need to daydream something like that more often.In the scene between Guido and the Catholic cardinal, I found a line there that reminded me why I quit going to church.  Guido complains of not being happy.  The cardinal replies, ""Why should you be happy?  That is not your task in life.  Who said we were put on Earth to be happy?""  He then quotes from Origenes:  ""There is no salvation outside the Church.""A question from Guido to Claudia, the stunning actress tapped to play his pure angel is also one to us all:  ""Could you choose one single thing and be faithful to it?  Could you make it the one thing that gives your life meaning, just because you believe in it?""Marcello Mastroianni is well-placed as Guido, as is Sandra Milo as Carla and Anouk Aimee as Luisa.  Barbara Steele plays someone usually out-of-character compared to the horror films she did during this time, as Gloria, the poetic young fiancee of Guido's friend Mario.  She has a wonderful line:  ""The cruel bees have sucked the life from these poor flowers.""This movie was called 8-1/2 because Fellini had done seven films plus three collaborations in which he shot a short segment for an anthology, counting each collaboration as half, so he decided this film would be his 8-1/2th.

The movie is easier to understand if you realize this movie is essentially about itself. Quite a departure from Fellini's work in the 50s, such as the mesmerizing Nights of Cabiria. With 8 1/2, he embraced a much more fanciful surrealistic style, later to be dubbed &quot;Fellini-esque&quot;. It's a much more imaginative and cinematic style than the earlier neo-realist style. It allows us to really get inside the head of Guido (and Fellini also). We witness his dreams, his fantasies, his frustrations, his memories, his ideas, all in vivid carnivalesque vignettes. The opening sequence features Guido stuck in a traffic jam, then climbing out of his car and flying away in the sky. He flies far above a beach almost like a kite, with a rope attached to his leg held by one of his associates. Then he is pulled back down to earth by the rope and promptly returns to reality. This sequence sets the tone for the film. Guido drifts back and forth in between fantasy and reality. Perhaps to escape the frustrations of being unable to make his next film, of dealing with his producers, or of dealing with the women in his life. However, he never manages to escape for long without being pulled back down to earth by his problems.It's a scenario that we can all relate to. The reason that we go to movies in the first place is to escape from our everyday problems and concerns. This is Guido's (and Fellini's) predicament: that he can't even escape from his own concerns long enough to create a film, so that his viewers can escape theirs. Fellini, however, was able to take this predicament and make it into his film. The result is probably the most clever and complex film about filmmaking ever made.This can be a bit daunting to a first time viewer. 8 1/2, I think, is a film that you really have to grow into. It takes multiple viewings to really get a good grasp of everything that's going on. And with each viewing, you should notice something new and catch on to the many complexities of the film. I will admit that I have not completely grasped all the meanings of this profound film, but it's a joy to experience even if you absorb only a little. The combination of the images and Nino Rota's music and Fellini's dazzling photography makes for quite an experience.The Criterion DVD is definitely one to pick up. I haven't seen all the extra material on the disc, but the movie itself looks superb. The picture quality is really astounding. I saw 8 1/2 on an old VHS tape a while back and this DVD looks much, much better! It's a clean, detailed picture that really brings out the beauty of the black and white photography. The picture is also enhanced for 16:9 TVs.

This film is a mad circus, a mediation on life and love, and the most deliriously perfect film on the face of the earth. In short, 8 is the film equivalent of a baptism, each and every time I watch it I feel as though I am born again. Frederico Fellini's 8 is not just a magical film, the film itself is magic. It is a film about the beauty in artistic confusion and misguided passions, told seemingly autobiographically from the point of view of Guido Anselmi, a popular film director who finds himself awash in creative disunion and romantic pandemonium. Throughout the film Guido seeks out solutions through increasingly bizarre bouts of sordid self reflection that manifests itself in fits of manic hysteria and surreal fantasies that conjure up the most perplexing of answers.Guido Anselmi is played by one of the finest of all the Italian actors, Marcello Mastroianni, and it is a performance for the history books. Mastroianni bridges the gap between film acting and true self-realization, just as director Frederico Fellini closes the gap between film and art, art and life, and life and dreams. This is a film that tries to communicate a great deal with its audience, therefore I find it best to go into 8 as a dry sponge, eager to absorb all of the wonderful and fantastic ideas the film so eloquently and carefully bestows.8 is truly a one-of-a-kind experience, and I believe it one of the most important films ever made. It is extremely difficult to be unmoved by this film. I find it deeply affecting, haunting even, but in a very warm, comforting, welcoming, and even forgiving way. The honesty of 8 is unobscured by artistic and financial boundaries, as he explores not only the creative mind but the human spirit as well, and how these two things often war with each other. I recommend 8 to anyone who has ever fallen in love with a film, hell, I actually recommend 8 to anyone and everyone I know! I believe that everyone owes it to themselves to see this film. I believe that everyone should have the good fortune of experiencing of the greatest works of art that has ever been produced.I honestly cannot stress enough how remarkable 8 truly is. There is not a single wasted frame of film in the whole piece. 8 is a wonderful, hypnotic, and beautiful odyssey. 8 is not just a film about film, it is a film about life.To sum up all that's been said, I'll just repeat the obvious: 8 is one of my favorite films, and it is a very beautiful film.

Then I listened to the commentary track, and everything fell in place, more or less.The story, if we can say there is one, follows Guido, a movie director, staying at a health spa while trying to organize his next movie. His problem is that he has no idea what the movie is about, nor does he know what he is doing. Everything in his life lacks balance and he cannot admit the truth to himself or others, so he looks inwards to try to find answers, while being hounded by disgruntled actresses and journalists.8 1/2 has a multitude of narrative levels, even its own critic. At a first viewing, you have an utter but &quot;Beautiful Confusion&quot;, as the movie was first supposed to be called. But there *is* a method to this madness, and if you are very patient and have the DVD commentary track, you can understand it, I promise you. I think I managed that, but it's difficult (I don't want to give it away, however tempting it is). There is a reason why it's called an art students' favourite.Contrarily to what some ignorant critics have said, 8 1/2 is not about creativity or making a movie or somesuch nonsense. There is strictly no movie-making in this movie, as Guido has no screenplay, and no idea where he is going. Trying to explain this movie cannot be done, unless you simply tell the truth - that it is an exploration of Fellini's psyche and problems. The movie itself feels more like a sustained emotion than a movie, because we are basically exploring one gigantic theme, and we just don't know it. It is not an easy movie to watch emotionally or to remember, because the storyline is fragmentary. It's more like a dream than an actual story.From the opening dream scene of Guido trapped in a car, to the bath house (the most inspired scene I've ever seen), to the unfinished spaceship structure, 8 1/2's style is the equal of its content.

This time it was different. I knew it from the opening scene, from the first sounds of Nino Rota's music. I wanted to know how Guido would balance the demands of his producers and the insecurities of his love life. I sometimes barely could tell the difference between the reality and Guido's surfing the waves of his memory or building the Utopias in his mind where things were exactly the way he wanted them to be - and I really did not want to tell the difference. I just was there, following Guido on his journey where Fellini sent us. Then, that scene came, ""La Saraghina's"" lurid dance on the beach. There was something in that scene that made me return to it over and over again. What was it? The dancing woman was not young, pretty or graceful. On the contrary, she was fat and ugly but there was something about her - that smile, resilience, the promise of joy that attracted eager schoolboys. It was a last time the young Guido felt happy without guilt and shame that inevitably came after the encounter and stayed with him forever; he learned that joy and punishment are inseparable...There have been fewer than a handful of films that affected me as profoundly as 8  did:Tarkovsky's ""Zerkalo"" - when the master holds the mirror in front of you that reflects his soul and mind, open you eyes and heart, don't say a word, just watch closely.Tarkovsky's ""Andrey Rublev"" - What is talent? Is it a God's gift or Devil's curse? Is an Artist free in choosing what to do with that gift?Bergman's ""Persona"" - How far can one individual go in opening his soul to the other without losing identity and sanity?Fellini's -""Nights of Cabiria"" - ""Dum Spiro - Spero"" - While there's life there's hope.In 8 , Fellini explored all these subjects and in the final he took the idea of life and hope ever further: after all the characters in his film disappear from the screen, all what left behind is ""a little orchestra of Hope with Love as its conductor"".

243609,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301025083,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[213, 223]","Frederico Fellini's masterwork 8  is difficult to approach largely because of its reputation. Many critics also state that the film is so complex that it requires multiple viewings to understand, and this is likely to intimidate many viewers.  But the truth is that, in spite of its surrealistic flourishes, 8  is more straight-forward than its reputation might lead you to believe.The storyline itself is very simple.  A famous director is preparing a new film, but finds himself suffering from creative block: he is obsessed by, loves, and feels unending frustration with both art and women, and his attention and ambition flies in so many different directions that he is suddenly incapable of focusing on one possibility lest he negate all others. With deadlines approaching the cast and crew descend upon him demanding information about the film-information that the director does not have because he finds himself incapable of making an artistic choice.What makes the film interesting is the way in which Fellini ultimately transforms the film as a whole into a commentary on the nature of creativity, art, mid-life crisis, and the battle of the sexes.  Throughout the film, the director dreams dreams, has fantasies, and recalls his childhood-and this internal life is presented on the screen with the same sense of reality as reality itself.  The staging of the various shots is unique; one is seldom aware that the characters have slipped into a dream, fantasy, or memory until one is well into the scene, and as the film progresses the lines between external life and internal thought become increasingly blurred, with Fellini giving as much (if not more) importance to fantasy as to fact.The performances and the cinematography are key to the film's success.  Even when the film becomes surrealistic, fantastic, the actors perform very realistically and the cinematography presents the scene in keeping with what we understand to be the reality of the characters lives and relationships.  At the same time, however, the film has a remarkably poetic quality, a visual fluidity and beauty  that transforms even the most ordinary events into something slightly tinged by a dream-like quality.  Marcello Mastroianni offers a his greatest performance here, a delicate mixture of desperation and ennui, and he is exceptionally well supported by a cast that includes Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee, and a host of other notables.I would encourage people not to be intimidated by the film's reputation, for its content can be quickly grasped, and when critics state the film requires repeated viewing what they actually seem to mean is that the film holds up extremely well to repeated viewing; each time it is seen, one finds more and more to enjoy and to contemplate.  Even so, I would be amiss if I did not point out that people who prefer a cinema of tidy plot lines and who dislike ambiguity or the necessity of interpreting content will probably dislike 8  a great deal; if you are uncertain in your taste on these points you would do well to rent or borrow the film before making a purchase.

Fellini, from the book Fellini on Fellini.Round and round we go with this film, one of the greatest films ever made, one of my top 10 films, and arguably Fellini's greatest work, or close to it (La Dolce Vita is as good as this one).  It's the film where Fellini went into surrealism and dreams and never went back.  It's also one of the greatest films ever made about filmmaking and the artistic process.  Despite being a cinema person, I don't like films about the business, as they become so esoteric (especially films made about Hollywood) that they are far too ""inside"" for most.  The Hollywood films (especially ones of recent vintage) give the impression that only in Hollywood are there problems on film sets, and that making films is difficult.  Problems exist on all films sets.  That's life.  8 1/2 is not esoteric.  It's a universal film.We see Guido, a famously successful film director, who is suffering from creative block, a ballooning budget on a film he doesn't want to make, martial problems, mistress problems, health problems, etc., etc..  At times, it's hard to tell what's real and what's imaginary, but you're ultimately not to supposed to know what's real and what's imaginary.  This causes much confusion at times, but it's supposed to be, and it works magically.  The film is really striking for many reasons.  Its excellent pace, wonderful, crisp photography, great performances, its unforgettable imagery, and one of the greatest endings in the history of cinema.For those who don't know, Fellini called this 8 1/2 because, according to him, it was his ""8 1/2th"" film.  He co-directed his first film (which he counted as half), and made 7 features up until this one.  Despite being made over 40 years ago, the film hasn't dated and remains, rightfully so, on many greatest films ever made lists.",5,The Delightful Confusion.....,1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,1925,"['movie', 'business', 'macabre', 'Grotesque', 'combination', 'football', 'game', 'brothel', 'Fellini', 'book', 'Fellini', 'Fellini.Round', 'round', 'go', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'top', '10', 'films', 'arguably', 'Fellini', 'greatest', 'work', 'close', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'film', 'where', 'Fellini', 'went', 'surrealism', 'dreams', 'never', 'went', 'back', 'also', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'filmmaking', 'artistic', 'process', 'being', 'cinema', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'business', 'become', 'so', 'esoteric', 'especially', 'films', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'inside', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'especially', 'ones', 'recent', 'vintage', 'give', 'impression', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'there', 'problems', 'film', 'sets', 'making', 'films', 'difficult', 'Problems', 'exist', 'films', 'sets', 'life', '8', '1/2', 'not', 'esoteric', 'universal', 'film.We', 'see', 'Guido', 'famously', 'successful', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'suffering', 'creative', 'block', 'ballooning', 'budget', 'film', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'martial', 'problems', 'mistress', 'problems', 'health', 'problems', 'etc.', 'etc..', 'times', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'imaginary', ""'re"", 'ultimately', 'not', 'supposed', 'know', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'imaginary', 'much', 'confusion', 'times', 'supposed', 'be', 'magically', 'film', 'really', 'striking', 'many', 'reasons', 'excellent', 'pace', 'wonderful', 'crisp', 'photography', 'great', 'performances', 'unforgettable', 'imagery', 'one', 'greatest', 'endings', 'history', 'cinema.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Fellini', 'called', '8', '1/2', 'according', 'was', '8', '1/2th', 'film', 'co-directed', 'first', 'film', 'counted', 'half', 'made', '7', 'features', 'up', 'one', 'being', 'made', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'film', ""n't"", 'dated', 'rightfully', 'so', 'many', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'lists']",N/A

Christal,"[2, 5]","Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is mesmerizing in it's tone, style and technique all the while telling a coherent story of the inner depression of a director. It can be somewhat obvious that Fellini used a lot of his personal experience after the success of his film La Dolce Vita and how most likely he was under the gun to make another success. It is also one of the testaments to his imagination and creative flair of film that he decided to use this problem to his advantage. By combining many of his deep, joyful, though troublesome memories with strange and interesting detail around the picture world in Italy, he has crafted a masterpiece about film.Marcello Mastroianni, who also played the lead in La Dolce Vita and a number of other Fellini movies, takes on playing a verion of Fellini- Guido Orefice is fourty-three, somewhat sick, pulled in several directions at numerous times, the director with little time is assigned to pump out new ideas for his new movie and get the right actors for the job. Mastroianni projects a splendid performance of his version of Fellini (his version by the way, not an exact replica) since he conveys all the sorrow right in his eyes, within at a lot of moments. This is a good mood motivator.Overall what makes 8 1/2 unique are the numerous sequences where Guido escapes in his dreamworld of women, memories, and the fancy free-flight. Most memorable (indeed one of the most memorable of all time from my standpoint) scenes is the first of the movie, where he is stuck in traffic, surrounded by a many lot of odd looking people, and getting exasperated when some type of gas fumes into the unopenable car. Then he finally reaches his abscond- getting out through the roof of the car and flying away in the sky; only to get tugged at by a counselor while floating without moving in the sky to the words- Down, definitely down. The fact that this scene is only the first in a line of others that ring surreal simplicity while is just one of the many triumphs present here. The last scene is also one for the books if only for it's cheery lunacy.(By the way, this critertion DVD is also worth 5 stars.

I got a little confused with the constant interchange between Guido's dreams, fantasies, memories, and present events. Although it was easy to distinguish the reality from fantasy, I did not fully understand the reason for these fantasies and what they were about. Having already seen a similar great mind game movie ""Mulholland Dr."" without a doubt, 8  is one of the best movies made about filmmaking. Many believe that master director Federico Fellini based the movie on himself and his struggles. The movie appears semi-autobiographical because the central character in the movie is also a director named Guido Anselmi, played brilliantly by Marcello Mastroianni. It is about Guido's confusion on what his next movie is about. While trying to reach a decision, Guido also confronts his own personal problems.Guido is already a successful and famous director. And for his next film, a science fiction one, he asked the studio for a massive construction of a prop spaceship. The construction cost the studio millions of Liras, but they did it anyway because they are confident with Guido's abilities. Before filming starts, Guido had a nervous breakdown that made him think about what he is doing. He then postpones the shoot and tries to rewrite the script. When he could not come up with the story he likes, he believes that he ran out of inspiration. So retreats to his dreams and fantasies to come up with one, while his producer, cast, and crew keep pressuring him to start the shoot.Aside from his problems with his film's story, he also confronts his problems with his wife Luisa (Anouk Aimee) and his mistress Carla (Sandra Milo). Guido invites Luisa to the set even though he knows Carla is there. Guido is even careless enough to let the two women be present at the same place. Luisa knows about Guido's affair with Carla, but Guido keeps insisting her that its over. Fellini's directing is excellent. He gracefully guides the audience inside what is clearly a troubled man's mind. Sometimes, Fellini does not show a transition from the realities to the fantasies, but we know that it's only a fantasy because it couldn't have happened in reality. We take a journey through Guido's mind. From his memories of dancing with a prostitute as a child to a fantasy where he has all the woman in his life in the same room. Fellini's camera work is amazing, and he also added some entertaining dance sequences.My only criticism here is that it takes the movie too long to get off the ground. It seems to be stuck in its launching pad at some times. Some scenes and sequences are a little too long and extended. Nonetheless, 8  is still amazing and captivating. It exhibits and plays gently with the mind. 8  is one of the stalwarts of foreign cinema, and I recommend this movie to movie lovers who want to see the works of Fellini.",5,Applaud the man with no clear ideas,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2904,"['have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'Federico', 'Fellini', '8', 'got', 'little', 'confused', 'constant', 'interchange', 'Guido', 'dreams', 'fantasies', 'memories', 'present', 'events', 'was', 'easy', 'distinguish', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'did', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'reason', 'fantasies', 'what', 'were', 'about', 'Having', 'already', 'seen', 'similar', 'great', 'mind', 'game', 'movie', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'doubt', '8', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'made', 'filmmaking', 'Many', 'believe', 'master', 'director', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'based', 'movie', 'struggles', 'movie', 'semi-autobiographical', 'central', 'character', 'movie', 'also', 'director', 'named', 'Guido', 'Anselmi', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Marcello', 'Mastroianni', 'Guido', 'confusion', 'what', 'next', 'movie', 'about', 'trying', 'reach', 'decision', 'Guido', 'also', 'own', 'personal', 'problems.Guido', 'already', 'successful', 'famous', 'director', 'next', 'film', 'science', 'fiction', 'one', 'asked', 'studio', 'massive', 'construction', 'prop', 'spaceship', 'construction', 'cost', 'studio', 'millions', 'Liras', 'did', 'anyway', 'are', 'confident', 'Guido', 'abilities', 'filming', 'starts', 'Guido', 'had', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'made', 'think', 'what', 'doing', 'then', 'shoot', 'tries', 'rewrite', 'script', 'When', 'could', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'story', 'ran', 'inspiration', 'So', 'retreats', 'dreams', 'fantasies', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'producer', 'cast', 'crew', 'keep', 'pressuring', 'start', 'shoot.Aside', 'problems', 'film', 'story', 'also', 'problems', 'wife', 'Luisa', 'Anouk', 'Aimee', 'mistress', 'Carla', 'Sandra', 'Milo', 'Guido', 'Luisa', 'set', 'even', 'Carla', 'there', 'Guido', 'even', 'careless', 'enough', 'let', 'two', 'women', 'be', 'present', 'same', 'place', 'Luisa', 'Guido', 'affair', 'Carla', 'Guido', 'insisting', 'Fellini', 'directing', 'excellent', 'gracefully', 'audience', 'what', 'clearly', 'troubled', 'man', 'mind', 'Sometimes', 'Fellini', 'not', 'show', 'transition', 'realities', 'fantasies', 'know', 'only', 'fantasy', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened', 'reality', 'take', 'journey', 'Guido', 'mind', 'memories', 'dancing', 'prostitute', 'child', 'fantasy', 'where', 'woman', 'life', 'same', 'room', 'Fellini', 'camera', 'work', 'amazing', 'also', 'added', 'entertaining', 'dance', 'sequences.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'here', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'be', 'stuck', 'launching', 'pad', 'times', 'scenes', 'sequences', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'extended', 'Nonetheless', '8', 'still', 'amazing', 'captivating', 'gently', 'mind', '8', 'one', 'stalwarts', 'foreign', 'cinema', 'recommend', 'movie', 'movie', 'lovers', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'works', 'Fellini']",N/A

243620,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6301025083,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","Federico Fellini's ""8 1/2"" is considered by many to be one of the best films ever made, but has a large amount of haters too. It's not hard to see why, even if you love the film. It mixes fantasy and reality, sometimes jumping from one to the other with little-to-no warning. Some critics have even complained they couldn't tell what parts of the movie were fantasy and reality, which I think is actually kind of stupid...I knew exactly what was and what wasn't. I think it'll be hard for people to not acknowledge that this is a great film. It's not one of the most entertaining movies I've seen, but it's wonderfully photographed and has some classic moments. Visuals definitely overrule plot in the film. The movie opens in a very trippy dream sequence. Our main character, Guido (Marcello Mastroianni), dreams that he suffers asphxia in his car and then is suddenly floats into the sky; Before being pulled down via a rope by one of his associates. Namely his screenwriter. The movie is basically like this; Guido is a director who wants to make a movie, a good movie to be precise. Problem is, he's ran out of ideas and is stuck directing a science-fiction movie he has no interest in. Meanwhile, he juggles an affair with his mistress and his wife; He's not good at it. In one scene, his wife and mistress end up at the same place together. But, looking away from plot for a second, there's one scene that stands out among all others in my head. There's a flashback scence, where Guido, as a young boy, and his schoolmates go to the beach to watch the prostitute Saraghina. This scene plays almost like a silent film. She, basically, dances for the sex-crazed young boys; But it's not the dance itself, but the music on the soundtrack that she's dancing too. Neither one of these would factors would be of much importance, but it's the combination of them that makes the scene so great. It's very surreal and just really well done. I've only seen this film once, but I'm already curiously eager to see it again. It's not like any movie I've ever seen before; The ending, especially, fits the film so well. A lot of people won't like it; It's in Italian, lots of fantasy sequences, etc. But this is a great film. Most critics, most filmmakers, Roger Ebert, and myself agree.

243621,A1LBBULBEREVEF,6301025083,Kathy Fennessy,"[3, 5]","I found it off-putting at first, but Federico Fellini's eighth film (the ""1/2"" represents a short) seems less offensive in retrospect. Basically, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni) is a bit of a jerk when it comes to women, and the women in the picture are painted with pretty broad strokes (Anouk Aim&eacute;e is the Uptight Wife, Claudia Cardinale is--literally--the Dream Girl, etc.). But I think we're meant to see them as he does and not necessarily as the director feels we should. The elegantly world weary Mastroianni is probably the only actor in the world who could have made this kind of character sympathetic. Not much happens either, but I guess that's the point: 8-1/2 is a film about a man--a filmmaker--at an impasse in his life. Women frustrate him, he's getting old, and he just can't seem to get his latest production off the ground. It's all one long bad dream. For what it's worth, director Jonathan Nossiter (Sunday, Signs & Wonders) has said he didn't like the film when he first saw it either. Some viewers may find that it takes a combination of time and successive viewings to fully penetrate this self-enclosed world--but it's worth the effort.As a special bonus, the carnival-esque soundtrack is one of Nino Rota's very best and just gets better the more I hear it.

243622,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,6301025083,Kenji Fujishima,"[4, 8]","For what it is---an intensely personal statement about Fellini's own frustrations at a film director at a certain point in his life, as reflected by the frustrations of his film director alter ego Guido Anselmi---Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is indeed brilliant and creative. It is certainly not like any other film you've ever seen, and it deserves to be seen by any serious cinema enthusiast at least once or twice, since it is such an influential film.That being said, I have to admit that, after having seen it twice, I personally still can only express a cold admiration for Fellini's achievements here. I just can never really get myself personally involved in Fellini's world here to the point that I truly care about Guido and his predicament. Fellini hardly bothers to build up any sympathy for Guido or any of the characters (although I personally did feel some sympathy for Guido's wife Luisa, who is convincingly portrayed by Anouk Aimee as a woman who has had enough of his husband director's cheating ways). The film is on such a personal level that Fellini shuts the audience out and makes us view his universe from afar without truly enveloping us in it, and while what he does in that universe is undeniably brilliant, it means precious little to us in the end. I am almost tempted to echo some of the sentiments of critics (like Pauline Kael) who were less than enthusiastic when the film was first released in America---those who dismissed the film as &quot;self-indulgent trivia.&quot; I expected a film about filmmaking, and what I saw instead was the story of a director going on and on and on about his own suffering, and frankly sometimes I just didn't truly care.But then, of course, maybe Fellini never intended to fully engage the audience in this film. Or maybe I just have to watch more Fellini films in order to perhaps get onto his wavelength (so far, 8 1/2 is the only film of Fellini's I have seen). Despite my personal misgivings, 8 1/2 does have some justly famous sequences and images(the harem sequence being the standout), and is interesting enough to warrant a look by any serious film enthusiast. Who knows? Great art sometimes doesn't reveal its depths the first time, and maybe this film will eventually reveal something more in subsequent viewings (although in the back of my mind I have my doubts).",4,"Fascinating, but a film more to respect than love",1085961600,"05 31, 2004",2004,2338,"['what', '-an', 'intensely', 'personal', 'statement', 'Fellini', 'own', 'frustrations', 'film', 'director', 'certain', 'point', 'life', 'reflected', 'frustrations', 'film', 'director', 'alter', 'ego', 'Guido', 'Anselmi', '-Federico', 'Fellini', '8', '1/2', 'indeed', 'brilliant', 'creative', 'certainly', 'not', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'be', 'seen', 'serious', 'cinema', 'enthusiast', 'least', 'once', 'twice', 'such', 'influential', 'film.That', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'admit', 'having', 'seen', 'twice', 'personally', 'still', 'can', 'only', 'express', 'cold', 'admiration', 'Fellini', 'achievements', 'here', 'just', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'personally', 'involved', 'Fellini', 'world', 'here', 'point', 'truly', 'care', 'Guido', 'predicament', 'Fellini', 'hardly', 'build', 'up', 'sympathy', 'Guido', 'characters', 'personally', 'did', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Guido', 'wife', 'Luisa', 'who', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'Anouk', 'Aimee', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'enough', 'husband', 'director', 'cheating', 'ways', 'film', 'personal', 'level', 'Fellini', 'audience', 'view', 'universe', 'afar', 'truly', 'enveloping', 'what', 'universe', 'undeniably', 'brilliant', 'precious', 'little', 'end', 'am', 'almost', 'tempted', 'echo', 'sentiments', 'critics', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'who', 'were', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'America', '-those', 'who', 'dismissed', 'film', 'quot', 'self-indulgent', 'trivia.', 'quot', 'expected', 'film', 'filmmaking', 'what', 'saw', 'instead', 'was', 'story', 'director', 'going', 'own', 'suffering', 'frankly', 'sometimes', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'truly', 'care.But', 'then', 'course', 'maybe', 'Fellini', 'never', 'intended', 'fully', 'engage', 'audience', 'film', 'maybe', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'more', 'Fellini', 'films', 'order', 'perhaps', 'get', 'wavelength', 'so', 'far', '8', '1/2', 'only', 'film', 'Fellini', 'have', 'seen', 'personal', 'misgivings', '8', '1/2', 'have', 'justly', 'famous', 'sequences', 'images', 'harem', 'sequence', 'being', 'standout', 'interesting', 'enough', 'warrant', 'look', 'serious', 'film', 'enthusiast', 'Who', 'Great', 'art', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'depths', 'first', 'time', 'maybe', 'film', 'will', 'eventually', 'reveal', 'something', 'more', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'back', 'mind', 'have', 'doubts']",N/A
243623,AO461REE0KA4J,6301025083,keviny01,"[50, 55]","**EDIT 10/4/11: ADDED REVIEW OF 2009 CRITERION BLU-RAY**The most obvious achievement in 8 1/2, Fellini's mind-boggling piece of self-examination, is its audacious mixture of dreams and reality in order to show the protagonist Guido's whimsical mind state. Dream sequences come and go without warning, depicting Guido's pain, yearning, frustration, guilt that can pop up at any instant. The first time we see Guido's face, it is his mirror image, hinting to us the unreality we are about to face. Some of the dream sequences have a Bunuel-like surrealism. Some of them, however, blend almost seamlessly into scenes of reality, intentionally confounding us. Some are nightmarish, yet some are warm and hopeful. Some are brief flights of fancy, and some are lengthy, elaborate, wild visions that reflect Guido's heightened sense of confusion and anxiety. Although the film is often called the best film ever made about a filmmaker, its theme is universal in that it is a vivid picturization of a person's (and by extension, any person's) mind, which is often haunted by the past, tormented by the present, and apprehensive about the future and the unknown...The Criterion Blu-ray edition duplicates all the content in the bonus features and booklet of the DVD edition, but offers a high-def picture and lossless uncompressed mono track.  The 1080p video transfer seems to come from the same high-def source that created the DVD edition (which looks very good itself), so you get the inherent advantage of high-def over standard-def, which is 2-3 times higher resolution horizontally and vertically.  The uncompressed audio track is encoded at a bit rate of 1152 kbps, which is 6 times higher than that of the DVD's Dolby Digital mono track.  In short, this is the best the film has ever looked and sounded on home video.  Of course, the better your audio and video equipments (especially screen size), the better your experience.  I viewed mine on a 50"" screen.  As is usually the case in viewing black-and-white films on Blu-ray, you see more optimal black and white levels than the DVD counterpart.  But be sure to calibrate your screen properly, such as with the ""color bars"" screen that comes with all Criterion discs.  Proper calibration is quite important for serious viewing of Blu-rays because of the format's ability to show a lot more subtleties and nuances in the picture than DVDs ever can.The 52-minute short film ""Fellini: A Director's Notebook"" in the Blu-ray's bonus feature section actually has better picture quality than that on the DVD edition.  It still looks severely battered and scratchy, but the colors are much brighter, whereas on the DVD they look very faded.  Criterion has obviously found a different video copy of the film for the Blu-ray, as indicated by the opening logo that does not exist on the DVD.For my opinions on the quality of the bonus features, please see my original DVD review below.**BELOW IS MY REVIEW OF THE 2001 CRITERION DVD EDITION, originally posted Dec-05-2001**The new Criterion DVD of 8 1/2 has a sparkling video transfer. A frame-by-frame cleanup of the picture has been done, so this DVD is significantly better-looking than Criterion's laserdisc version in 1989. There are momentary freeze frames during the opening scene, but since they also appeared on the LD, I assume they are normal. The 1.0 mono audio track is indistinguishable in quality from that on the LD -- it is mostly clean and sharp, although loud sound shows some distortion. The image is anamorphic. The disc is region-free. The audio is supported by newly-translated optional English subtitles.There is one slight discrepancy between the LD and the DVD. The LD contained the American release version of the film in which some scenes, such as the one in which Guido first meets his wife, had altered music cues. The DVD, however, is the original Italian version, retaining all of its original music.The DVD's audio commentary comprises of scene-specific comments (whose authorship is unclear), and additional comments from critic Gideon Bachmann and NYU professor Antonio Monda. The result is a pretty well-rounded audio essay covering the film's conception, production details, themes, and artistic significance, as well as personal recollections, anecdotes, and abandoned concepts and scenes. Other extras include two 1-hour films on the filmmakers. The first is ""Fellini: A Director's Notebook"", directed by and starring Fellini himself. It is a sort of Fellini-style DAY FOR NIGHT, a fictional, somewhat humorous account of how the director goes about making a film. The video/audio quality of this piece is poor, and there are no subtitles or closed captioning. The second film is a documentary made by German filmmakers in 1993 titled ""Nino Rota: Between Cinema and Concert"". It offers an intimate yet enigmatic portrayal of Nino Rota through his personal recordings, film footage of him working with Fellini, clips of some early films scored by Rota, and interviews of his associates and students. One segment is about how Rota recycled his score from the 1957 film FORTUNELLA to create the theme for THE GODFATHER, an act that would cost him the Oscar nomination. The DVD extras also include 3 new interviews. Sandra Milo speaks candidly about her experiences, both personal and professional, with Fellini. Linda Wertmuller lavishes praises on Fellini's genius while offering a fascinating appraisal of Fellini's psychology that figures prominently in 8 1/2. And Vittorio Storaro pays tributes to the achievements of 8 1/2's cinematographer, Gianni di Venanzo. Rounding out the extras are 100 or so still photos from the set of the film, some of which were taken from deleted scenes.",5,"Review of 2009 Criterion Blu-ray, 2001 Criterion DVD",1007510400,"12 5,

Gittins,"[11, 45]","Criterion 2-disk version review:Tedious fictional semi-autobiographical story about a film director who is working on a movie but can't figure out a plot or ending. I can see where people might think this is a great art film, but I found it a struggle to watch (once with and once without commentary).The commentors point out every little nuance that is supposed to mean something - whether it truly does is debatable - ""this scene with Guido totally in darkness while Claudia is in light means...""...""notice how the succession of large closups shows..."" etc.I could only sit through about 5 or 10 minutes of the hour long feature about Fellini - very tedious as some 1960's Italian hippies were trying to make some point (or joke). (In Italian with subtitles).Interview with Sandra was pretty nice. Sampled and passed on other interviews.Documentary on Nino Rota (in German with subtitles) was OK, though I was not that interested and bailed early.Passed on photographs.The booklet has some interesting background in which Fellini explains he had a type of ""director's block"" and decided to make a movie about that.The movie was beautifully filmed in black-and-white, had interesting use of light and shadow, and included some nice images and sets.

Guido is sent to a health spa where he is supposed to recover from his stressful life, but instead is continuously pursued by people around him, by his past, and by his conscious.  The people around Guido are either dependent on him, desire his company, or merely try to advertise themselves in his presence.  In order to cope with a large number of people Guido has developed a social dance where he is able to circumvent or approach the individuals of his choosing.  This dance is also Guido's way of dealing with life and its complications, which affects him physically, psychologically, and socially.8 fragmentally displays Guido's life as he dances between reality, dreams, and memories in the developmental stage of a film production.  This cerebral dance helps him to avoid what is deemed as uncomfortable as he escapes into his memories where he can find some joy and peace.  However, Guido often reminds himself of how his past sometimes plagues him as he can recollect deep memories of discomfort and guilt.  These negative emotions lead Guido into an internal crisis where he struggles with his decisions in the light of moral judgment that is heavily weighted by his Catholic upbringing.  Despite the internal crisis, the dance continuous as Guido is compelled to flee his painful memories by seeking company outside of his marriage as he seeks self-affirmation when he is alone.  The cheating provokes further guilt which urges Guido to remain dancing as he escapes into a dream world where he attempts to unify memories with the present where his consciousness sets the rules.  But to Guido's dismay he finds the dreams forcing him back into reality as his dreams rebel against himself.  This is due to his conflicting ideas that are simultaneously rejected and approved of in order to find temporary happiness and please those around him.  In essence, it is Guido's denial of his own lies that is the root to his guilt and unhappiness.Fellini's 8 is a cinematic masterpiece, which encourages analytical and artistic thinking as it dives into a dense fabric of inventive imagery.  Vividly Fellini paints Guido's moral crisis onto the silver screen, which offers a surreal cinematic experience as it drifts between reality and dreams.  In addition, 8 shows Fellini's profound understanding of human psychology, which possibly could have been based on himself.  The fragmented story line enhances the visual feeling of the stress that Mastroianni's character experiences as well as developing a deep understanding for his mind.  The opening shot where Guido dreams of being enclosed in a smoldering car stuck in traffic displays Fellini's true cinematic genius as he develops an image of panic, anxiety, and fear.  This visualization is something that can be discovered in every film that Fellini has directed as well as his trademark of having a circus-like atmosphere.  8 has everything of what makes it a Fellini film, which offers a unique experience that could only have been accomplished by a true cinematic artist.",5,Fellini's fragmented masterpiece of an internal crisis...,1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,3164,"['prominent', 'film', 'director', 'Guido', 'Marcello', 'Mastroianni', 'overworked', 'harassed', 'fatigued', 'aspect', 'being', 'Guido', 'sent', 'health', 'spa', 'where', 'supposed', 'recover', 'stressful', 'life', 'instead', 'continuously', 'pursued', 'people', 'past', 'conscious', 'people', 'Guido', 'are', 'dependent', 'desire', 'company', 'merely', 'try', 'advertise', 'presence', 'order', 'cope', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'Guido', 'developed', 'social', 'dance', 'where', 'able', 'circumvent', 'approach', 'individuals', 'choosing', 'dance', 'also', 'Guido', 'way', 'dealing', 'life', 'complications', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'socially.8', 'fragmentally', 'Guido', 'life', 'reality', 'dreams', 'memories', 'developmental', 'stage', 'film', 'production', 'cerebral', 'dance', 'avoid', 'what', 'deemed', 'as', 'uncomfortable', 'memories', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'joy', 'peace', 'However', 'Guido', 'often', 'how', 'past', 'sometimes', 'can', 'recollect', 'deep', 'memories', 'discomfort', 'guilt', 'negative', 'emotions', 'lead', 'Guido', 'internal', 'crisis', 'where', 'decisions', 'light', 'moral', 'judgment', 'heavily', 'weighted', 'Catholic', 'upbringing', 'internal', 'crisis', 'dance', 'continuous', 'Guido', 'compelled', 'flee', 'painful', 'memories', 'seeking', 'company', 'marriage', 'self-affirmation', 'when', 'alone', 'cheating', 'further', 'guilt', 'Guido', 'remain', 'dancing', 'dream', 'world', 'where', 'unify', 'memories', 'present', 'where', 'consciousness', 'rules', 'Guido', 'dismay', 'dreams', 'forcing', 'back', 'reality', 'dreams', 'rebel', 'due', 'conflicting', 'ideas', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'rejected', 'approved', 'order', 'find', 'temporary', 'happiness', 'please', 'essence', 'Guido', 'denial', 'own', 'lies', 'root', 'guilt', 'unhappiness.Fellini', '8', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'analytical', 'artistic', 'thinking', 'dense', 'fabric', 'inventive', 'imagery', 'Vividly', 'Fellini', 'paints', 'Guido', 'moral', 'crisis', 'silver', 'screen', 'surreal', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'reality', 'dreams', 'addition', '8', 'shows', 'Fellini', 'profound', 'understanding', 'human', 'psychology', 'possibly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'fragmented', 'story', 'line', 'visual', 'feeling', 'stress', 'Mastroianni', 'character', 'experiences', 'as', 'well', 'developing', 'deep', 'understanding', 'mind', 'opening', 'shot', 'where', 'Guido', 'dreams', 'being', 'enclosed', 'smoldering', 'car', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'displays', 'Fellini', 'true', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'image', 'panic', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'visualization', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'discovered', 'film', 'Fellini', 'directed', 'as', 'well', 'trademark', 'having', 'circus-like', 'atmosphere', '8', 'everything', 'what', 'Fellini', 'film', 'unique', 'experience', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'true', 'cinematic', 'artist']",N/A

Everyone is getting ready to film and the actors are all present but the character played by Marcello Mastroianni doesn't have a story much less a script.  He confronts his wife, his girlfriends, friends and others who are hanging on his every whim and desire for employment and success.  Only with his leading actress, Claudia Cardinale can he let his guard down and allow her to be in the driver's seat (literally).  The others cling to him as he tries to run away and not be bothered in order to think.  The idea comes to him at the last moment before production has shut down and in the face of a staunch critic who tells him that he was right not to try rather than to risk failure.  The effort of creativity, fear of its loss and the vision others have of the artist which can be positive or toxic to artistic talent is a large theme in this movie.

Possibly it was because I completely related to the main character's pain of being trapped in a reality that made him paranoid, or that every problem that he had would topple down his other problems like dominoes, pressure from the people who surrounded him, personal and professional alike. Or maybe since it was directed and written by Fellini. In any way, this vision only Fellini could take on, a director who had no idea how to finish his own film, with his personal struggles surrounding him at the same time, was destined to be the film that Fellini should be remembered for. You may want to scream at yourself after watching this film. But do you exactly know why?Criterion put together the ultimate package for   supplements galore. Commentary is fun for the enthusiasts, along with Terry Gilliam's intro. But all the fun to me lies in the autobiographical film that Fellini made for television. Just sit back and watch this after the movie. You'll see what I mean by it. Or maybe you won't. The documentary on the amazing Nina Rota from German television is also included, the composer behind many of his films, possibly this one being the most memorable of his film scores. They also held back at nothing and included many essays for the booklet inside, which I still have no idea why other companies feel this is not a `supplement If you don't own any of Fellini's films on DVD, this is the one to start off with. This has the best extras of any out there.On a side note, the audio seemed to be slightly off, but it might be a defect on my copy, I haven't seen anything on Criterion's website that says anything about it.Best shot/sequence:With Criterion remastering every frame, it's hard to pick out the best of the best. But the opening dream sequence when Guido is stuck in traffic and floats away is still far and away one of the greatest dream sequences ever made, with subtle uses of freeze framing, dissolves, and telephoto lenses.

Fellini captured the true whirlwind of ideas, fantasies, desires, evocations, memories and nightmares of a film director (in this case, Mastroianni) who suffers from a blank in the middle of his will-be next film.This is a film where Fellini uses himself as the primary source for his character with beautiful evocations of his own childhood and all the characters that populate his mind.Constructed against the idea of a plot, the film goes deeper and deeper into the main character's mind allowing Fellini do display his true command of the images.Beautifully shot in B&W; it is incredible how Fellini and his cameraman arrange all the elements inside the frame - resulting in shots that are not found anywhere else. Every shot is a masterpiece of image composition that only DVD can do justice to.This CRITERION edition is vastly superior to all other versions of this film. Not only it provides top quality on the film itself, but also a huge amount of valuable extras. The comentary is key to understanding the ""whys"" and ""hows"" of the Fellini universe. But there are also photos, interviews, a Fellini's short, a documentary, etc.A true masterpiece from a master director.",5,"BEAUTIFUL, HAUNTING AND POETIC FILM.",1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,1251,"['best', 'portrait', 'artist', 'mind', 'ever', 'made', 'Cinematic', 'terms', 'Fellini', 'captured', 'true', 'whirlwind', 'ideas', 'fantasies', 'desires', 'evocations', 'memories', 'nightmares', 'film', 'director', 'case', 'Mastroianni', 'who', 'blank', 'middle', 'will-be', 'next', 'film.This', 'film', 'where', 'Fellini', 'primary', 'source', 'character', 'beautiful', 'evocations', 'own', 'childhood', 'characters', 'populate', 'mind.Constructed', 'idea', 'plot', 'film', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'main', 'character', 'mind', 'allowing', 'Fellini', 'do', 'display', 'true', 'command', 'images.Beautifully', 'shot', 'B', 'W', 'incredible', 'how', 'Fellini', 'cameraman', 'arrange', 'elements', 'frame', 'resulting', 'shots', 'are', 'not', 'found', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Every', 'shot', 'masterpiece', 'image', 'composition', 'only', 'DVD', 'can', 'do', 'justice', 'to.This', 'CRITERION', 'edition', 'vastly', 'superior', 'other', 'versions', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'top', 'quality', 'film', 'also', 'huge', 'amount', 'valuable', 'extras', 'comentary', 'key', 'understanding', 'whys', 'hows', 'Fellini', 'universe', 'are', 'also', 'photos', 'interviews', 'Fellini', 'short', 'documentary', 'etc.A', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'master', 'director']",N/A
243636,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,6301025083,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[1, 3]","This movie is about as tiring and confused as the narrator/protagonist. Just like him we know his project is doomed, but we can't do anything about it until he does something about it, so we plod along with him and hope that maybe someone else will work it out for him.It's a very intimidating film, I think even moreso for filmmakers. It represents just the fear they have, where they want to express something but have no idea how to do it, so try to pass off a bunch of vague and insubstantial images as a plot for a while until other people start getting serious about what's needed to be put in it to make it actually a film. In that way it's a lot like Adaptation, except Adaptation makes it colorful and zany in a twisted way while this makes it pretty dark and brooding. Both films are brilliant, if for no other reason in that I can't believe it actually worked out.In fact, one thing that's amazing about this film is that I didn't feel like I was watching Fellini (like how in Adaptation I felt I was watching Charlie Kaufman). Despite the inherent self-reflexiveness of having a movie about movies, this one didn't seem to bring attention to the camera or exposition at all, instead making the ""movie within a movie"" moments a product of the antihero's film-centric imagination (how his dreams are filled with set pieces, rigid cutting, and silent, visual aura while the real moments in the film are filled with sound, other people moving, longer, more flowing takes, and less dance numbers.) It also is very interesting to follow the supporting characters, how they all seem to have wives you never see and mistresses you see all the time, how they all do their thing without knowing what they're supposed to do, all because that's all they know how to do, and how they invest themselves with the director and he just pushes them aside. Then with all the introductions to women who want parts, the whole melange of faces and bodies all trying to get something out of nothing... it's a very exhausting film.But that's what it's trying to express, so it's amazing. I love the obvious and yet completely profound images of stuff like ""The set built on sand"" and ""I need to include everything to express nothing.""

243637,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6301025083,"Promise ""promise""","[2, 2]","I remember a time around jr. high school when there was a spate of kids writing homework papers about how they couldn't write the paper. They always had a ring of authenticity and sometimes some humor but usually very little else.  This movie is about a film director who is making a movie about not being able to make a movie.  The difference here is obviously that Fellini is a genius and his creative effort turns out to be splendidly brilliant and entertaining unlike those jr high school papers.There's so much to say about it.  It's like life--where do you approach it?  Obviously some folks won't like it and that's understandable and fine.  No one likes everything. For those who want a linear plot and everything spelled out for them, forget it. For those who can let go of logic for a little while, ascend into a space where  where dreams and reality, the past and present intermingle, this film can be deeply rich and satisfying.I saw it when it came out and was dazzled.  In those days, style was big in my book and this film had all of the elements that impressed me and my friends. It's always a risk for me to re-view those films that I fell in love with so long ago...sort of like meeting a first love  again in middle age...will he still charm? This film stood the test.  I was still wildly entertained by the surface beauty but this time I think I understood the basic story a little better.  It's part of the value of this film that there is more to it than style. It has psychological and social validity as well.I won't recount the story as so many others here have done that.  A psychiatrist could have a field day analyzing Guido's neuroses. I did actually have a hard time believing the final resolution--it seemed to come a little too easily after the long ""display"" of the problem.  But what comes across, finally, is the joy of it all.  Fellini may escape into a dream world to avoid his adult commitments but he does come back again...just like Guido escaped from his car up into the stratoshere, but was pulled down by the cord tied to his ankle.  We are asked to believe that these descents or ascents into his dreamworld have helped him to resolve his conflicts.There is a very touching interview included on the second disk with Sandra Milo, who plays Guido's mistress in the film.  She was Fellini's mistress for 17 years and her comments are not to be missed.  I don't know if Fellini's actual conflicts were resolved as Guido's seem to be, in the film.  But the joy and beauty of the film along with the honesty of the self-revelation give this great magic.Some of my favorite scenese are those remembrances from Guido's childhood-- like playing in the wine vat and then  being adoringly wiped off by the loving mama.  And the unforgettable scene on the beach of the schoolboys jumping up and down for joy as the town prostitute does the rhumba.  The sheer exuberance and joy of these scenes make the film worth watching.  And the music...!!

He is not mature in his dealings with women.Among others, there is his mistress Clara, there is his wife Luisa, and there is Claudia who is (for him) the Anima and she has `the power or the key' to turn things straight for him.I do have two (minor) points of criticism.(1) Guido happens to be a not really likable character but he also somehow remains distant for the viewer (except in his memories and dreams) and because of this it is quite likely that the viewer does not really care so much for his well-being though his disfunctioning is the main theme of the movie.- Spoiler alert -Near the end Guido has a redemptive insight and all the characters of the movie join together in a festive finale. The energy circulates again. (Truly a great scene!)(2) This liberating insight seemed to come `from nowhere', it was not an effect of (for example) a change in his attitude. For me, this felt rather `unorganic' and `thought out' and arbitrary than organic and natural.Though I still consider this movie a great artistic achievement, the two points mentioned keep me from really being concerned about Guido's proceedings and from being really enthousiastic about the movie as a whole.",4,A Fellini classic,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,1578,"['have', 'been', 'admirer', 'movie', 'Fellini', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'yesterday', 'saw', 'movie', 'fifth', 'time.I', 'still', 'consider', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'especially', 'dreams', 'memories', 'are', 'portrayed', 'admirable', 'way', 'cinematography', 'indeed', 'great', 'throughout.Guido', 'creative', 'crisis', 'probably', 'crisis', 'contacts', 'women', 'even', 'bigger', 'not', 'mature', 'dealings', 'women.Among', 'others', 'mistress', 'Clara', 'wife', 'Luisa', 'Claudia', 'who', 'Anima', 'power', 'key', 'turn', 'things', 'straight', 'him.I', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'minor', 'points', 'criticism', '1', 'Guido', 'be', 'not', 'really', 'likable', 'character', 'also', 'somehow', 'distant', 'viewer', 'memories', 'dreams', 'quite', 'likely', 'viewer', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'well-being', 'disfunctioning', 'main', 'theme', 'movie.-', 'Spoiler', 'alert', '-Near', 'end', 'Guido', 'redemptive', 'insight', 'characters', 'movie', 'join', 'together', 'festive', 'finale', 'energy', 'circulates', 'again', 'great', 'scene', '2', 'liberating', 'insight', 'seemed', 'come', 'nowhere', 'was', 'not', 'effect', 'example', 'change', 'attitude', 'felt', 'rather', 'unorganic', 'thought', 'out', 'arbitrary', 'organic', 'natural.Though', 'still', 'consider', 'movie', 'great', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'two', 'points', 'mentioned', 'keep', 'really', 'being', 'concerned', 'Guido', 'proceedings', 'being', 'really', 'enthousiastic', 'movie', 'whole']",N/A
243640,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6301025083,Randy Keehn,"[1, 3]","I purchased this DVD because of its' sustained superior ratings in the Sight and Sound survey every decade of the best films of all time.  Obviously, there must be something very great about this movie.  There is but but there are some second thoughts that plagued me along the way.  First of all, I am always impressed by a film's ability to hold our attention.  This is often where the skill of film editing is best appreciated.  I confess that I found myself looking for some scenes in &quot;8 1/2&quot; to move along.  This is a cerebral movie, not an action movie but there seemed to be a fair amount of redundancy.  Secondly, I was surprized by the sound work on this movie.  I made a quick glance at a few other reviews but didn't see any similar comments.  Thus I don't know if it was just my copy.  However, the sound didn't match up with the film very well at all.  This gives the movie an odd appearance of being an Italian movie dubbed in Italian.  Was I missing something?  Finally, the message in this film, for me, was &quot;to your own self be true&quot; which is certainly a valid philosophy; just ask Socrates.  However, it was stretched to come across as &quot;accept me for who I am, not whom you want me to be&quot;.  This message is still a valid philosophy but a bit harder for some of us to accept.Having said all of that, let me praise the movie; (I DID give it a &quot;5&quot; after all).  The acting is terrific; especially Marcello Mastroianni whose air of detachment fit the movie so well.  The photography (B&amp;W) was excellent, as well.  The story is one of a director who has lost his own direction.  As he stumbles aimlessly along supposedly putting together a film,  his inteactions with others and his reminiscences give us an insight to his confusion.  His world is overwhelming him and he can't figure out where to turn.  He is much the victim of himself (which makes the message that much harder to swallow).  As his crisis reaches its' own crisis, the movie rights itself with his discovery of his own self-awareness.  Everything comes together at the end with a message of hope (primarily for the director).  The beauty of the movie is how we are able to follow the character's collapse and rebirth.  It is also in the way we can see the rest of the world through his own eyes.  This is the sort of movie that will expand with each re-viewing.  The DVD contains a second disc with information and reviews about the movie and the Director.This is a good movie that caught me off-guard because I was victimized by too much advance hype.  I understand the hype but it would have been better to discover it for myself.  Discover it for yourself and it will be a movie you'll remember.",5,How Good is Great?,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,2722,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'sustained', 'superior', 'ratings', 'Sight', 'Sound', 'survey', 'decade', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'Obviously', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'very', 'great', 'movie', 'are', 'second', 'thoughts', 'plagued', 'way', 'First', 'am', 'always', 'impressed', 'film', 'ability', 'hold', 'attention', 'often', 'where', 'skill', 'film', 'editing', 'best', 'appreciated', 'confess', 'found', 'looking', 'scenes', 'quot', '8', '1/2', 'quot', 'move', 'along', 'cerebral', 'movie', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'fair', 'amount', 'redundancy', 'Secondly', 'was', 'surprized', 'sound', 'work', 'movie', 'made', 'quick', 'glance', 'few', 'other', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'similar', 'comments', 'Thus', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'just', 'copy', 'However', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'odd', 'appearance', 'being', 'Italian', 'movie', 'dubbed', 'Italian', 'Was', 'missing', 'something', 'Finally', 'message', 'film', 'was', 'quot', 'own', 'self', 'be', 'true', 'quot', 'certainly', 'valid', 'philosophy', 'just', 'ask', 'Socrates', 'However', 'was', 'stretched', 'come', 'quot', 'accept', 'who', 'am', 'not', 'whom', 'want', 'be', 'quot', 'message', 'still', 'valid', 'philosophy', 'bit', 'harder', 'accept.Having', 'said', 'let', 'praise', 'movie', 'DID', 'give', 'quot', '5', 'quot', 'acting', 'terrific', 'especially', 'Marcello', 'Mastroianni', 'air', 'detachment', 'fit', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'photography', 'B', 'amp', 'W', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'one', 'director', 'who', 'lost', 'own', 'direction', 'aimlessly', 'along', 'supposedly', 'putting', 'together', 'film', 'inteactions', 'others', 'reminiscences', 'give', 'insight', 'confusion', 'world', 'overwhelming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'turn', 'much', 'victim', 'message', 'much', 'harder', 'swallow', 'crisis', 'own', 'crisis', 'movie', 'rights', 'discovery', 'own', 'self-awareness', 'Everything', 'together', 'end', 'message', 'hope', 'primarily', 'director', 'beauty', 'movie', 'how', 'are', 'able', 'follow', 'character', 'collapse', 'rebirth', 'also', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'rest', 'world', 'own', 'eyes', 'sort', 'movie', 'will', 'expand', 're-viewing', 'DVD', 'second', 'disc', 'information', 'movie', 'Director.This', 'good', 'movie', 'caught', 'off-guard', 'was', 'victimized', 'too', 'much', 'advance', 'hype', 'understand', 'hype', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'discover', 'Discover', 'will', 'be', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'remember']",N/A

I was in my mid-twenties and liked the big-breasted women. Saw the movie again yesterday at the Colonial in Phoenixville, PA, a wonderfully restored small town theatre, and reentered the world of the great director Federico Fellini. The cast consisted of Marcello Mastroianni (mid life crisis of the great director), Claudia Cardinale (the perfect woman), Sandra Milo (the chesty but dim lover) and Anouk Aim?e (the ordinary wife he cheats on).For Fellini, 8 ? continued a trend away from the realism of his early movies to a surrealistic view of his own life. The film has a simple premise. The great director has no idea what his next movie is about, while his producer and film company wait for Mastroianni to tell them what the movie is about. It does not help that Mastroianni falls in love with every woman in the cast and every woman he ever knew. The famous harem scene is near the end of the movie, where all the women in his life await his every whim. The older ones get banished upstairs. When the women revolt, he gets his whip and regains order. The women love him again. Oh, irony, but in Surrealism, Freud reigns supreme and dreams are a wish.

It's just a basic conceit that anyone who wants to create should avoid... don't make the creation about the act of creating it.Yet, time and again it's an irresistible lure... the grand tell-off tell-all that creative people can't resist. It always stinks, and this wasn't really an exception. Things are constantly ""told"" rather than shown... from politics, to philosophy, to love, this is more of a director's essay disguised as a story, than a story. Fellini throws in lively dream sequences, and tries to doll the whole thing up as a righteous attempt at clearing the skeletons out of his personal closet by blurring the lines of film and barely disguised confession.

Guido Anselmi is the protagonist and is a thinly-veiled projection of (director) Federico Fellini.  Formally, this film has moments of rare beauty.  In terms of content, it is a confessional piece that appears extremely personal while at the same time giving voice to common struggles of man.  Guido is subjected to a maelstrom of questions which he has no answers to.  One can assume these are all questions that he is silently asking himself.  Guido's conversations become quite loaded and reveal an incomplete man beneath the mystique of an artistic reputation.  Guido navigates often hostile environments with only brief possibilities for fulfillment and repose.  Guido cannot find the worldly rewards that he expects for himself and seems as much a victim of his own pessimism as of the endless demands of his colleages and lovers.  Toward the end, the desperation featured in the story might actually reflect the reality of the production of 8 1/2.  I am only guessing, because as obsurd as the film becomes it seems to remain interested in ""the truth"" of things.  Questions play a large role in this story as much as do the silences that often follow them.Fellini has left us with a groundbreaking film that has a lot of heart.

You will either love it or hate it but it will evoke a strong response either way. Fellini combines dreamlike fantasy sequences and distorted childhood memories with a real contemporary story line in a way that brilliantly blends them and blurs the line between the main character's fantasies and reality. The result is a dissection of  a man's total experience , both external and internal, as he plans to direct a film and struggles inwardly with mid life crises concerning his career and his complex relationship to women both past and present. Watching this I can't help but wonder how Fellini ever convinced others who participated in this artistically and financially of what his vision for this film was. It's hard to imagine anyone making a film like this today. Woody Allen has obviously been heavily influenced by Fellini's work but he only uses some elements while for Fellini the entire 2 1/2 hours is a mesmerizing blend of surreal elements. I think Fellini was a true artist as a director and he gets a tremendous performance out of Mastrianni in 8 1/2.

243645,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,6301025083,RMurray847,"[2, 4]","I've had to admit this before, but I don't know much about the creator of 8 , Federico Fellini.  I've certainly heard of him for decades, but until recently, I had not seen any of his films.  I recently watched AMARCORD, and found it energetic and evocative, but kind of empty as well.  A man looking back on his childhood with clear memories of how he FELT, portraying events in the over-important manner that kids think about the things that happen to them...like nothing is more important.  I enjoyed the film, but didn't quite understand the fervor.8  caused many similar feelings for me.  It's filmed in gorgeous black and white, and it's even more of a dreamlike experience than AMARCORD.  On the surface, it tells the story of a famous Italian film director, Guido (played by the really terrific Marcello Mastroianni), who has perhaps had some sort of minor breakdown or creative collapse, and has gone to a spa somewhere in Italy.  Presumably, he has gone to get away from it all for a while, but he is surrounded by producers, critics, actors, who are all ready for him to start his next film.  It's clear Guido has no clear idea of what his film is about, except it is clearly meant to be autobiographical...yet he isn't sure what he's saying with the film.  Guido doesn't exactly have writer's block...he's got TOO much inspiration.  Seemingly, he desires to cram his entire life into the film, making it an homage to the important women in his life, and perhaps an apology.  While Guido clearly knows a lot of men...it is the women who have been important to him and who he has treated poorly throughout his life.  He remembers his mother, the village prostitute (very different than the village prostitute in AMARCORD), his many girlfriends, his wife, his sister, his current mistress.  They are all different.  He clearly has affection for them, and they mostly have some for him as well...but are frustrated, angry even tormented by his poor treatment.  They have offered him love, and he has given much less in return.The story is intermixed with numerous odd fantasies that Guido has.  He imagines scenes such as living in a harem with all his women, who are happy to share his attention.  He remembers scenes from his life.  Each piece he conjures is like a little absurdist piece...ridiculous and revealing.  But Fellini has even filmed his ""normal"" scenes like some crazy dance sequence...camera swirling, voices coming from all directions, extreme close-ups.  So even Guido's ""real life"" feels dreamlike.  The spa is an odd place, apparently real, yet somehow fantastical in its operation.  The movie set being built for Guido is a huge launching pad for a spaceship...yet we get absolutely no idea how a travel into space has anything to do with the movie Guido is apparently creating.8  explores (in my mind...I chose not to read any essays before throwing my thoughts out there) the crush of fame, as everyone around him is drowning Guido in their own demands.  It explores the psyche of a man who can't be faithful and/or can't return love.  It explores the creative process itself.  It's a film about a guy making a film about a guy who makes films.  Mastroianni is certainly a stand-in for Fellini himself...the film must surely by auto-biographical to some degree.  It feels too specific not to be.The cinematography is splendid.  The editing feels way ahead of its 1963 time.  The performances all nicely balance realism and an over-the-top cartoonishness...suitable for the circus-like atmosphere of the proceedings.  The music is appropriately loud and insistent.  We sense Guido is in a pressure cooker, and all these loud, sweaty people, loud, brassy music and swirling cameras are keeping him off balance and ready to explode.  Even in his calmest moments, and there are many, Guido is thinking, thinking, thinking.  How will he meet the demands of those around him...and why should he?The movie was admirable...yet for me it left me only bemused, not really entranced.  The character of Guido is simply too unlikeable.  He's charming as can be...but Guido (and thus, Fellini) is guilty of too much navel gazing and (as one character says near the end) assumes that people will find his life interesting.  Yes, Fellini is a beloved director and ground-breaking filmmaker...but exploring what a jerk he is and how tormented by his own fame is a bit of a bore.  I was unable to get through the film in one sitting...it took me three chunks of roughly 45 minutes to get to the end.  I feel dreadfully shallow saying this, especially about a film that is practically popping with energy and creativity.  But for me, the shallow philosophizing (really, just the director trying to excuse and ask forgiveness for piggish behavior) just doesn't make it compelling.I viewed the Criterion Blu-Ray.  The picture is splendidly crisp.  Dialogue, strangely, often seemed slightly out of synch with the actors.  Not sure if this isn't from the original.  But the subtitles are HORRIFIC.  I've complained about Criterion's subtitles before...they insist on white subtitles even on black & white films, with little or no outlining of the letters.  This has been a pain before, but 8  has many scenes with significant swaths of white, and I found myself having to pause from time to time just to squint and read the subtitles.  Criterion does such a great job with so many other aspects of what they do...why for goodness' sake can't they do better with the all-important subtitles?8  was worth seeing.  It's a classic and it's an important part of cinematic history...thus, I feel I've checked off a film on the list of ""you can't be a true movie buff if you haven't seen these films.""  Yet it felt a little too much like homework for me to give it a ringing endorsement.",3,"Didn't bowl me over, and the subtitles are a disgrace.",1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,5789,"[""'ve"", 'had',

Then there are his memories, which interweave with reality and are so indistinguishable from it that at times the viewer is uncertain what has really happened.

Everything is grotesque yet understated and subtle.He feels besieged, overwhelmed as so many people keep coming at him, and yet he tries to see his way forward.

I'm tempted to do a straightforward account as if this were a simpler film, but 8 1/2 is a film about the making of a film and simultaneously, what seems to be, a real-time documentary about said film about a film. But I don't think that's complex enough. A fourth dimension to add might be the context of Fellini's actual life is being played out above and beyond that. Fellini does a pretty fine job at intertwining those threads, with an emphasis on his self-examination. He lays it all out there. He may have benefited more from a Freudian examination.The tortured and eternally frustrated director seems to be at a crossroads in his career. He's on the cusp of his biggest film to date. The only problem is he doesn't seem to be inspired or motivated to make it. He seems willing to play the roll of director, but hardly seems to enjoy getting his hands dirty anymore. All day, everyday, he carries a pained look on his face as he has to fend off his anxious producer or evade countless wanna-be actors or has-been actresses. It doesn't help that the perfect lead actress isn't the one he's been seeing behind his wife's back. On top of juggling his mistresses (of which he's alternately tired and inspired to do), he's constantly getting his ass kissed by staff who have relatives sprouting from everywhere to get in on the film. It begins to pain him to have to meet with his staff, his producers, or longtime friends in the industry who find it difficult to associate with Guido because ""he's changed"".What's amazing about 8 1/2 is that it's extraordinarily well thought out and meticulously planned. For all the soul searching going on and questions being raised, the film uses Guido's past and several delusional/male fantasies to answer them. Just as a something to ponder comes up, it's addressed. After all, it his his film. But, as segmented and, dare I say, somewhat dissatisfying as that aspect is, it comes off as clever and insightful. I love how Guido seems to always be in a state of reflection, but at the same time, he conducts himself as though the past doesn't exist. He comes off quite self-centered and arrogant; which to those around him choose to accept as charm. But his closest friends & family have become weary of Guido's childish exploits. In a twisted sort of way, I think that's what motivates and inspires him.Those first few minutes of 8 1/2, in my opinion, is essentially the entire film encapsulated in dream form. I found that fascinating. For the entire movie to be fully effective though, it might have dispensed with what I consider to be an ending that may have appeared to be the allocution the film built up to, but was actually as evasive and nonchalant as Guido was to his wife. I believe his wife was the voice of reason in the film, but was once again, patronized and handed a bill of goods from her husband. Which makes his revelation all the more disingenuous. The journey of Guido (Fellini) into absolution has him remaining the self-centered person he truly is and at the risk of losing his marriage and career, conjures up a moment of lucidity to pacify his wife's contempt. It would be a beautiful thing indeed if it wasn't just a defense mechanism which only enables Guido's ego. Sadly, his revelation is for the benefit of himself, and maybe also for his adoring audience. The irony is, that I didn't (or wouldn't have) expected anything less. How could I?A brilliant and deep film that is resolute and steadfast with it's content, but can surely mean many different things depending on the viewer.",5,8 1/2 opens in a dream.,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,4457,"['maybe', 'more', 'precisely', 'daydream', 'man', 'stuck', 'heavy', 'traffic', 'Not', 'car', 'moving', 'utter', 'gridlock', 'most', 'everyone', 'close', 'proximity', 'deeply', 'focused', 'exception', 'car', 'two', 'short', 'order', 'car', 'fill', 'smoke', 'choke', 'tries', 'escape', 'car', 'can', 'not', 'latches', 'crawl', 'out', 'window', 'Then', 'float', 'gridlocked', 'traffic', 'sky', 'where', 'rope', 'tied', 'ankle', 'man', 'below', 'basically', 'flying', 'kite', 'man', 'actually', 'trying', 'pull', 'ground', 'man', 'sky', 'liberate', 'leg', 'rope', 'wishing', 'float', 'away', 'free', 'dream', 'ends.Guido', 'mollycoddled', 'famous', 'director', 'who', 'find', 'beginning', 'film', 'being', 'pampered', 'who', 'well', 'being', 'being', 'scrutinized', 'room', 'full', 'attendants', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'do', 'straightforward', 'account', 'were', 'simpler', 'film', '8', '1/2', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'simultaneously', 'what', 'be', 'real-time', 'documentary', 'said', 'film', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'complex', 'enough', 'A', 'fourth', 'dimension', 'add', 'might', 'be', 'context', 'Fellini', 'actual', 'life', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'Fellini', 'pretty', 'fine', 'job', 'intertwining', 'threads', 'emphasis', 'self-examination', 'there', 'may', 'have', 'benefited', 'more', 'Freudian', 'examination.The', 'tortured', 'eternally', 'frustrated', 'director', 'be', 'crossroads', 'career', 'cusp', 'biggest', 'film', 'date', 'only', 'problem', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'inspired', 'motivated', 'make', 'willing', 'play', 'roll', 'director', 'hardly', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'hands', 'dirty', 'anymore', 'day', 'everyday', 'pained', 'look', 'face', 'fend', 'off', 'anxious', 'producer', 'evade', 'countless', 'wanna-be', 'actors', 'has-been', 'actresses', ""n't"", 'help', 'perfect', 'lead', 'actress', ""n't"", 'one', 'been', 'seeing', 'wife', 'back', 'top', 'juggling', 'mistresses', 'alternately', 'tired', 'inspired', 'do', 'constantly', 'getting', 'ass', 'kissed', 'staff', 'who', 'have', 'relatives', 'sprouting', 'everywhere', 'get', 'film', 'pain', 'have', 'meet', 'staff', 'producers', 'longtime', 'friends', 'industry', 'who', 'find', 'difficult', 'associate', 'Guido', 'changed', '.What', 'amazing', '8', '1/2', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'meticulously', 'planned', 'soul', 'searching', 'going', 'questions', 'being', 'raised', 'film', 'Guido', 'past', 'several', 'delusional/male', 'fantasies', 'answer', 'Just', 'something', 'ponder', 'up', 'addressed', 'film', 'segmented', 'dare', 'say', 'somewhat', 'dissatisfying', 'aspect', 'off', 'clever', 'insightful', 'love', 'how', 'Guido', 'always', 'be', 'state', 'reflection', 'same', 'time', 'past', ""n't"", 'exist', 'off', 'quite', 'self-centered', 'arrogant', 'choose', 'accept', 'charm', 'closest', 'friends', 'family', 'have', 'become', 'weary', 'Guido', 'childish', 'exploits', 'twisted', 'sort', 'way', 'think', 'what', 'inspires', 'him.Those', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', '8', '1/2', 'opinion', 'essentially', 'entire', 'film', 'encapsulated', 'dream', 'form', 'found', 'fascinating', 'entire', 'movie', 'be', 'fully', 'effective', 'might', 'have', 'dispensed', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'ending', 'may', 'have', 'appeared', 'be', 'allocution', 'film', 'built', 'up', 'was', 'actually', 'evasive', 'nonchalant', 'Guido', 'was', 'wife', 'believe', 'wife', 'was', 'voice', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'patronized', 'handed', 'bill', 'goods', 'husband', 'Which', 'revelation', 'more', 'disingenuous', 'journey', 'Guido', 'Fellini', 'absolution', 'remaining', 'self-centered', 'person', 'truly', 'risk', 'losing', 'marriage', 'career', 'up', 'moment', 'lucidity', 'pacify', 'wife', 'contempt', 'would', 'be', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'indeed', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'only', 'Guido', 'ego', 'Sadly', 'revelation', 'benefit', 'maybe', 'also', 'adoring', 'audience', 'irony', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'expected', 'anything', 'less', 'How', 'could', 'brilliant', 'deep', 'film', 'resolute', 'steadfast', 'content', 'can', 'surely', 'mean', 'many', 'different', 'things', 'depending', 'viewer']",N/A
243651,A3T8Y73DOFUIR6,6301025083,S. Smith-Peter,"[10, 11]","Guido is a director who can't make a film.  Meanwhile, he's the subject of a great film.  Others have given the story, so I won't recap it here.  I will say that watching the film as a woman is a strange experience. We are obviously supposed to identify with Guido for most of the movie, and yet his view of women is warped, as it is always filtered through two foundational experiences, linked to two senses: the bath and talcum powdering given to him by his mother while a child, which is associated with touch, and the dance of Saraghina, linked to sight.He divides up the women in his life according to these experiences, with his wife (who is explicitly linked to his mother in more than one scene) standing for the sense of touch, while his mistress and most of the other women, are there for - in his mind - his visual pleasure.  While a child, he watched the prostitute Saraghina dancing on the beach and was caught and punished in his Catholic school.  This imprinted on his sexual self, and now desire is linked to shame for him.The compass rose of his feelings toward women is the following: fear, disgust, longing, and desire.  Usually more than one will be present.  For his wife: fear and longing.  For his mistress: disgust and desire.  For Claudia, his ideal woman: longing and desire. His compass is always spinning around as he encounters other women. Note that love is not one of the options, but then again, neither is hate.  This is not a man who hates women, but also one who doesn't know how to love them.Note too, that the verbal is missing from his two foundational experiences.  Sight and touch are key, but hearing and words are, for him, a sort of false arena of exchange, where lies are traded for lies in order to allow him to make films.  In his relationship with his wife, who he does long for (although I'm not sure he loves her), he is unable to speak to her in a real way, which drives her away from him due to his constant lies.  I really liked Luisa, Guido's wife, who is a strong character even in this very male-dominated movie.  The scene where Guido is showing his (awful) screen tests is a particularly interesting one, as it shows that Guido is being unfair and cruel to his wife. This scene is one of the few where I believe we're supposed to identify with someone other than Guido -i.e., with Luisa.  If the movie-in-a-movie is unfair, it opens up the possibility that Fellini knows that he has problems and issues with women.The dance of Saraghina has many echoes in the film. Guido is constantly trying to control and reshape this experience, which showed the power of women over him. Note that Saraghina is older and shown almost as a giantess on film, as she would have seemed to the young Guido.  When he ""directs"" his mistress in fantasy play, he draws big eyebrows on her, like Saraghina had, and he says it's to make her look like a whore. In another long scene, he combines his two foundational experiences and has his wife, along with all the other women in his life, wash and powder him.  An old showgirl dances before them all.  This is a particularly cruel scene, and is another attempt to defuse the power of Saraghina's dance, as the old showgirl is old in a powerless way and her dance is grotesque.  In the end, she is sent upstairs with the other women who are too old for Guido's desire.  But because Saraghina's dance is imprinted on Guido's sexual template, no matter his treatment of other women, it cannot be contained and any victory over it will be a temporary one.The ending is very powerful because at the very site of the failed transcendence of the spaceship scene from his failed movie, a scene of human collectivity is enacted.  All the characters come out holding hands, as in a parade, thus combining the senses of of touch and sight. Even his wife is connected to the whole, and we see a moment of togetherness.  And yet the secret of a happy ending is knowing where to stop, and the last shot of a lone performer suggests that when this moment is over, Guido will still be alone with his procrustean sexual scenarios.  But then again, he's been in one of the greatest movies ever, so art can redeem life, if only partly and imperfectly.",5,Watching Fellini while female,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,4216,"['Guido', 'director', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'Meanwhile', 'subject', 'great', 'film', 'Others', 'have', 'given', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recap', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'watching', 'film', 'woman', 'strange', 'experience', 'are', 'obviously', 'supposed', 'identify', 'Guido', 'most', 'movie', 'yet', 'view', 'women', 'warped', 'always', 'filtered', 'two', 'foundational', 'experiences', 'linked', 'two', 'senses', 'bath', 'talcum', 'powdering', 'given', 'mother', 'child', 'associated', 'touch', 'dance', 'Saraghina', 'linked', 'sight.He', 'divides', 'women', 'life', 'according', 'experiences', 'wife', 'who', 'explicitly', 'linked', 'mother', 'more', 'one', 'scene', 'standing', 'sense', 'touch', 'mistress', 'most', 'other', 'women', 'are', 'there', 'mind', 'visual', 'pleasure', 'child', 'watched', 'prostitute', 'Saraghina', 'dancing', 'beach', 'was', 'caught', 'punished', 'Catholic', 'school', 'imprinted', 'sexual', 'self', 'now', 'desire', 'linked', 'shame', 'him.The', 'compass', 'rose', 'feelings', 'women', 'following', 'fear', 'disgust', 'longing', 'desire', 'Usually', 'more', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'present', 'wife', 'fear', 'longing', 'mistress', 'disgust', 'desire', 'Claudia', 'ideal', 'woman', 'longing', 'desire', 'compass', 'always', 'spinning', 'around', 'other', 'women', 'Note', 'love', 'not', 'one', 'options', 'then', 'again', 'hate', 'not', 'man', 'who', 'women', 'also', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'love', 'them.Note', 'too', 'verbal', 'missing', 'two', 'foundational', 'experiences', 'Sight', 'touch', 'are', 'key', 'hearing', 'words', 'are', 'sort', 'false', 'arena', 'exchange', 'where', 'lies', 'are', 'traded', 'lies', 'order', 'allow', 'make', 'films', 'relationship', 'wife', 'who', 'long', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'unable', 'speak', 'real', 'way', 'away', 'due', 'constant', 'lies', 'really', 'liked', 'Luisa', 'Guido', 'wife', 'who', 'strong', 'character', 'even', 'very', 'male-dominated', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'Guido', 'showing', 'awful', 'screen', 'tests', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'one', 'Guido', 'being', 'unfair', 'cruel', 'wife', 'scene', 'one', 'few', 'where', 'believe', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'identify', 'someone', 'other', 'Guido', '-i.e.', 'Luisa', 'movie-in-a-movie', 'unfair', 'up', 'possibility', 'Fellini', 'problems', 'issues', 'women.The', 'dance', 'Saraghina', 'many', 'echoes', 'film', 'Guido', 'constantly', 'trying', 'control', 'reshape', 'experience', 'showed', 'power', 'women', 'Note', 'Saraghina', 'older', 'shown', 'almost', 'giantess', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'young', 'Guido', 'When', 'directs', 'mistress', 'fantasy', 'play', 'big', 'eyebrows', 'Saraghina', 'had', 'make', 'look', 'whore', 'long', 'scene', 'two', 'foundational', 'experiences', 'wife', 'other', 'women', 'life', 'wash', 'powder', 'old', 'showgirl', 'dances', 'particularly', 'cruel', 'scene', 'attempt', 'defuse', 'power', 'Saraghina', 'dance', 'old', 'showgirl', 'old', 'powerless', 'way', 'dance', 'grotesque', 'end', 'sent', 'upstairs', 'other', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'old', 'Guido', 'desire', 'Saraghina', 'dance', 'imprinted', 'Guido', 'sexual', 'template', 'matter', 'treatment', 'other', 'women', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'contained', 'victory', 'will', 'be', 'temporary', 'one.The', 'ending', 'very', 'powerful', 'very', 'site', 'failed', 'transcendence', 'spaceship', 'scene', 'failed', 'movie', 'scene', 'human', 'collectivity', 'enacted', 'characters', 'come', 'out', 'holding', 'hands', 'parade', 'thus', 'combining', 'senses', 'touch', 'sight', 'Even', 'wife', 'connected', 'whole', 'see', 'moment', 'togetherness', 'yet', 'secret', 'happy', 'ending', 'knowing', 'where', 'stop', 'last', 'shot', 'lone', 'performer', 'when', 'moment', 'Guido', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'alone', 'procrustean', 'sexual', 'scenarios', 'then', 'again', 'been', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'art', 'can', 'redeem', 'life', 'only', 'partly', 'imperfectly']",N/A

There is one other scene in particular where Mastroianni stands in front of a light -- an effect I'm certain Fellini realized -- and you can literally see the light shine from his graying hair. Even the subtitles have been re-done. I can remember looking at the fuzzy subtitles on the VHS and struggling to concentrate. On this Criterion Collection DVD, they are crisp and clear as anything on the market.Most significant to me, though: the commentary section! Though I've watched this film a few times (I can still remember getting chills up my spine the first time I saw the opening sequence) the commentary will blow you away with how complex this 2 hour film is. Though it is a film that is fun enough to watch for its own sake -- the commentary read like a guidebook to Picasso's cubist period, explaining the significance of casting certain characters, various symbols: for example, the watch given to Mastroianni by the Producer in the film echoes Fellini's own producer giving him a watch under similar circumstances after his filming La Dolce Vita. There are many like images and symbols explained. The depth of commentary made this film Ten Times more complex than without -- and yet, even realizing how much more complex and personal this film is, it's still the fun 2 hour film it'll always be! It's just that watching it now is watching a film with thirty years of wisdom packed into one DVD. Amazing. Nina Rota's score is a trip! I've only had time, so far, to browse over the interview section on Disc 2 (nearly three hours worth of interviews).

243653,AWY56V0LIB3P,6301025083,Stephen McLeod,"[8, 11]","This new Criterion Collection edition of *8 1/2* is one of the best DVD ""special edition"" sets I've come across.The Movie:Fellini's breakthrough film is a movie about itself. It is archetypal in the Fellini canon because it both settles old scores and announces a new cinema. The film's hero is an Italian filmaker (Mastroianni as ""Guido"" a quasi-alter ego for the director) who has just had his first major hit (=La Dolce Vita). He is not resting on his laurels, however. He is confronted with the necessity of the next movie. This necessity is both personal to the director and apparently contractual: the producer is forever hovering... To Guido, it is an inner necessity, an unrest, a creative suffocation, objectified in the opening sequence of the movie where Guido is seen/not seen by the camera, trapped inside a tiny car that is itself trapped in a traffic jam that stretches endlessly beyond available light as the car fills with toxic gas. We see the as yet unidentified hero in silhouette from behind. We see his hands and feet from outside the car, through the window as he desparately tries to escape. Then, he mysteriously escapes through the car's roof like a new bird escaping its shell and is carried off into the clouds, etc.The trouble is, this is a wish fulfillment dream. In ""real"" life, Guido is about to make a movie, and he has no idea what it's going to be about, or what to do with all the actors and extras, and the giant launching pad for some kind of space-ship that is the only thing even close to a concrete idea for the projected picture.The film is not, however, a perfect autobiographical fit. For one thing, Fellini gets to finish his movie and Guido, evidently, does not. But, that said, the movie is a virtual mirror of itself, which was a very hard thing to pull off in 1962, before the concept of ""virtual"" was annexed by the codifiers of computer jargon, and *8 1/2* is nothing if not a virtuoso performance. Fellini's breakthrough is the film we watch. But in the film, the hero finds the resolution to his anguish, not in finding the project - that is, in making what would have been the film-about-itself within the film-about-itself within the film-about-itself that we are, finally, watching - but in letting go of the project, in surrendering to the impossibility of finding it or making it. Precisely *on the other side of his own fantasy-suicide*, at the moment when he apparently gives in to despair, he discovers the circle of life and becomes able to join into the procession of lives into which his own life is finally intertwined.So, this is an essential film. And it is a film so rich in texture that a person could watch the movie a hundred times and find new things to wonder at, and discover new connections between the One and the Many - Fellini's personal/existential problem.The DVD:First disc contains a sparkling transfer of the movie that restores a luster to the angular lights and shadows in Fellini's final black & white movie. Audio commentary by a couple of scholars and Fellini's former close accomplice Gideon Bachman.Second disc contains Fellini's famous ""Director's Notebook"" of 1968(-9), an hour-long movie that was originally made for television, as well as another documentary about composer Nino Rota, and various interviews, including one with the ever-fiesty Lina Wertmueller who was Fellini's Asst.

243655,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,6301025083,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[20, 36]","Federico Fellini's ""8 "" is often cited as the late director's masterpiece but it is a maddening film to watch.  It is filled to the brim with symbols, abstract ideas, ambiguity, and inner ruminations that taken together imposes on the audience the same disorienting feeling its main character is experiencing.  This absence of a conventional narrative is an intriguing and bold step taken by a true artist of the medium, but experimentation alone does not make for a good film.Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) is a film director who has just completed a hit film and is now taking refuge at a health spa.  His downtime is interrupted by a parade of individuals who do not realize that a crisis is at hand - the director has no idea what to do for a follow-up feature.  Money has already been spent for an elaborate film set but Guido does not know what to do with it.  Hoping to find inspiration, Guido starts to look into his past and experiences a spiritual crisis as he finds it difficult to reconcile his carnal, commercial, and creative sides.The famous sequence where Guido is reunited with all of the women he has crossed paths with in his life is a powerful sequence that is full of passion and energy.  Yet, this same level of vigor is not maintained for the entire film and after a while the vivid yet disconnected imagery we are left with that is meant to symbolize Guido's aimlessness just becomes annoying.  Fellini was a man ahead of his time in exploring the notion of creative bankruptcy in a commercial medium on such a sophisticated level.  However, by using the narrative of ""8 "" to symbolize and deliver the message at the same time, he produced a film that comes across as too clever for its own good.",2,"""Accept me as I am.

It has been widely regarded as a masterpiece and a gem by film critics everywhere. The film won two Adademy awards one for best foreign language film and was nominated for three others including best director.The movie is about a filmmaker who struggles with ideas for a new movie that he plans to work on. He frequently has nightmares and flashbacks based on previous events in his life.The film is incredibly photographed in has some good long shots my favorite of which is when the camera pans across an outdoor picnic with Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkries"" played by an unseen orchestra (we only see the conductor.)The DVD has great special features alsoDisc 1 contains the film with an optional audio essay by Fellini friend, Gideon Bachmann and NYU film professor, Antonio Monda. It also contains a theatrical trailer and an introduction presented by Terry Gilliam.Disc 2 contains the Fellini autobiographical film ""Fellini: A Director's Notebook"",""Nino Rota: Between Cinema and Concert"", an excellent biographical documentary on Italian film composer Nino Rota who composed music for many of Fellini's films but is best known for writing the music in the Godfather movies. He originally composed the famous Godfather theme for the film ""Fortunella"" co-written by Fellini.Disc 2 also contains official behind the scenes photos and some ameteur photos by Gideon Bachmann.

Of course, for their DVD edition, we can expect nothing less. And now, you have the great master Vittorio Storaro explaining how another great master, Gianni di Venanzo did all this and how it's important to the art of cinema.... already a hell of a good reason to own the DVD.More than a simple autobiography of a filmmaker, 8 1/2 is a journey into the creative human mind, its agony, self doubts, moral and sexual confusion, and its redemption. The sturuggle of art versus life, and the endless search for a proper ballance. That's why, not only fimmakers but all sort of creative people call this &quot;the best film I have ever seen,&quot; &quot;the film that has influenced my life the most.&quot;Because the film is more a free description of the flow of the human mind, its consciousness as well as its sub-consciousness, than just an autobiography. If you sit back to see just a simple movie in which everything is used to explain a linear story, the film may be confusing. But once you free your mind and let the sweeping camera movements and the stunning, brilliant imagery guide you into the mind of the protagonist-director, I can assure you it will be one of the richest cinematic experience of your life, because then the film allows you to see the reflection of your own psychological life in it.The special feature of the DVD includes a very rarely-seen self portrait-documentary by the genious himself, &quot;Fellini: a director's notebook&quot;. I think it's the first time this forgotten film goes to home video, that's already another good reason to add this DVD to your collection. And it's a very appropriate choice to put this unknown, almost unseen masterpiece to Fellini's own official masterpiece 8 1/2.But a bit distressing, since after all the proper ballance between life and creativity that Fellini seems to have achieved at the end of 8 1/2... well, when you see &quot;a director's notebook&quot; you see that the conflict is not resolved at all! But then to see &quot;Notebook&quot; and then go back to &quot;8 1/2&quot;, you may be able to see it in a different perspective, so that's great!!Life is a constant inner search and inner struggle; whether you will suffer from it and try constantly to escape, or you'll make your mind up to enjoy it since it will never go away anyway, that's up to you. And 8 1/2 is a film that will give you that energy, because it's also so funny.

It's pointless to complain about it being hit-and-miss or confused, since erratic confusion is the nature of the beast as Fellini becomes possibly the first man to film his own nervous breakdown (or at very least his crisis of creativity). In many ways the turning point in Fellini's career where fantasy and grotesquery would become an increasing part of increasingly disjointed phantasmagorias with a design style as cluttered as a tart's dressing table, there are moments that strike home and the latter scenes with his wife and with Claudia work because there's a sense of self-awareness of Fellini's limitations not just as an artist but as a human being. But overall I was just left with the feeling that I'd got on the wrong train by mistake.(Incidentally, to strike a timely note, it's amusing to note that the producer's brainless bimbo girlfriend is the spitting image of Paris Hilton!)It's a shame Criterion's otherwise excellent 2-disc DVD couldn't locate the deleted sequences, although they are represented in the excellent stills galleries.

Fellini's Guido is a director with an identity crisis effecting or as a result of his professional and personal life. The various scenes are powerful examples of what Fellini can do when he's operating at his full artistic capabilities. Part magical realism, part autobiography and done in a style that only Italian film was once able to do, watching 8  has always been a great experience for me.Fellini's self-conscious artistic manner and self-absorption, which can drag down some of his later works, become the strengths of 8 . His dreams, doubts and visions are the film itself and delivered so masterfully that Fellini never again was able to match (though he came close) this sort of narrative.There are so many great scenes in this film. Among the best is the imaginary ""revolt"" of the women in his life, where Guido's home is full of a ""harem"" that all turn against him.  Equally great is the circus scene where freaks and mirrors reflect the turmoil and confusion in his life.Some might call this an ""artsy"" film, which I think is a back handed complement.
