1519367,A29PLTX74EI6NN,B006T0R1WU,"Kai Roberts ""mysterymaven""","[18, 18]","I am impressed with this series.  It's powerful, suspenseful, and well-plotted. There's good character development bolstered by an emotional ""pull"" that draws the viewer into caring about the people portrayed.  That extra dimension proves the skill of both the screenwriters and the actors.  The story line revolves around the character of Maria Wern, a seasoned police officer who is also a recent widow with two young children. Maria is played intelligently and sensitively by Eva Rose. The struggles that she endures, putting their lives back on track while pursuing her career as a senior police officer, resonate with the viewer as a genuine effort --  it is not a cliche-ridden treatment , or an overly-emotional one. The character does not wallow in self-pity; neither is she so numbed by her own suffering that she's devoid of compassion for others.  It's a believable blend. The other ensemble actors are also very good and their characters seem fleshed-out and nuanced --they are people one can relate to and come to care about. Personally, I found this especially true of Maria's boss, Thomas.  Thankfully, he is not portrayed as the typical stock character of a gruff-but-indulgent boss, or an administrator more concerned with the departmental budget than with effective policing. Neither is he a chauvinist who patronizes Maria.  It's so refreshing to have professionals portrayed as decent, normal folks who can rise above petty jealousies to do their jobs as a team. The plots are fairly inventive, though I've seen a similar opening gambit in another series (it's shocking and haunting, so heads-up). A further point is that it is offered in Swedish, but the subtitles are excellent and do not detract from the viewing experience. Overall, then, I do recommend this series as being intelligent, well-done, and compelling.",5,First-rate,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,1838,"['am', 'impressed', 'series', 'powerful', 'suspenseful', 'well-plotted', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'bolstered', 'emotional', 'pull', 'viewer', 'caring', 'people', 'portrayed', 'extra', 'dimension', 'skill', 'screenwriters', 'actors', 'story', 'line', 'character', 'Maria', 'Wern', 'seasoned', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'also', 'recent', 'widow', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'Maria', 'played', 'intelligently', 'sensitively', 'Eva', 'Rose', 'struggles', 'putting', 'lives', 'back', 'track', 'pursuing', 'career', 'senior', 'police', 'officer', 'resonate', 'viewer', 'genuine', 'effort', 'not', 'cliche-ridden', 'treatment', 'overly-emotional', 'one', 'character', 'not', 'wallow', 'self-pity', 'so', 'numbed', 'own', 'suffering', 'devoid', 'compassion', 'others', 'believable', 'blend', 'other', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'characters', 'seem', 'fleshed-out', 'nuanced', 'are', 'people', 'one', 'can', 'relate', 'come', 'care', 'Personally', 'found', 'especially', 'true', 'Maria', 'boss', 'Thomas', 'Thankfully', 'not', 'portrayed', 'typical', 'stock', 'character', 'gruff-but-indulgent', 'boss', 'administrator', 'more', 'concerned', 'departmental', 'budget', 'effective', 'policing', 'chauvinist', 'who', 'Maria', 'so', 'refreshing', 'have', 'professionals', 'portrayed', 'decent', 'normal', 'folks', 'who', 'can', 'rise', 'petty', 'jealousies', 'do', 'jobs', 'team', 'plots', 'are', 'fairly', 'inventive', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'similar', 'opening', 'gambit', 'series', 'shocking', 'haunting', 'heads-up', 'further', 'point', 'offered', 'Swedish', 'subtitles', 'are', 'excellent', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Overall', 'then', 'do', 'recommend', 'series', 'being', 'intelligent', 'well-done', 'compelling']",Maria Wern: Episodes 1-3

I'm a sucker for closeups and shows that take the trouble to reveal the human side of things.  I can't give it 5 stars because for me, the story lines and their trajectories aren't quite tight enough, meander somewhat, and don't have that WOW factor- that satisying Columbo-like PUNCH- of COURSE, that makes PERFECT sense, at the end.  Gratuitous elements are added for dramatic effect/shock value, rather than in service to a tight plot (example- **spoiler alert**- in episode one the severed head in the well made sense, the others, not so much).  A few too many coincidences, things that don't quite add up, loose ends tied up in improbable ways (Maria's neighbors on either side!) or not at all.There's pathos but I just wasn't feeling it, for some reason.  I liked that time was taken to reveal particulars of characters' experiences (Maria looking longingly at her husband's photo, the chief interacting with his wife's dog) but for me the personal didn't go deep enough, I didn't feel I knew/understood these people, maybe too subtle for me.  It may be just YOUR cup of tea though and I do recommend it, worth seeing.A similar though better series, that I HIGHLY recommend, (also with stunning scenery, and humanity, but with tidier plots and greater depth, though somewhat darker, an Irish show) isSingle-Handed.  This is the PAL DVD link, at the moment I'm unable to insert the link to the Instant Video, free with Prime, but it comes up if you search in the main search box for single-handed in instant video.
