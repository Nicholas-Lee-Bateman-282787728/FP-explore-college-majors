457306,A1THJ5GJF9NLCS,6305268843,"BLee ""bpslee""","[12, 12]","The story might be remininscent of Jane Austen, particularly so when the setting was England in 1840. Yet other than the setting and costume, everything else is modern, the theme and the plot and the rhythm, everything. The main theme here is about desire and obligation or duty or the conflict between the soul and lust. As such, one just fails to see any connotation with DH Lawerence. It would rather remind us of Dr Zhivago instead.We have everything we possibly could expect from any movie: sound, sight, drama, everything. We have an excellent cast plus exquisite acting, including spendrift Lord, the good natured sister-in-law and even the stubborn and wayward 8 years old Louisa, not just the hero and the heroine. And the dialogues and the language including the dramatic ironies are just intriguing. As the story unfolds itself, it was clear that it was not simply a deal for money. The penniless girl, whose mother died at her birth and was raised up by her father, and she was trying to save her beloved father who was sent to jail because of a debt. It was because of her duty to her father.The softest spot of all would rather be Charles' wife: back in 1840 there was no way that a human vegetable could be so decently maintained, the least of would be the look of her eyes which were so crytal clear. This perhaps is due the artistic requirements of the movie as a whole.But this is a very small point indeed. Yet, who can possibly blame the husband who had been mourning the virtual death of his wife for 10 whole years, when his love and attention had turned to his own lively daughter? His own worldly father says his is ""abnomral"" being so dutiful. If anybody ever says the turn is not convincing, he obviously has not known life yet.Sophie had given life to her part in a most remarkable way here (and so did the young girl and her father). I have seen Sophie in another movie, shot quite a number of years back, which was not eqaully impressing as this.All in all, we can't ask for more from this movie. It is almost as good as the Polish movies like Blue, Red and White. What puzzles me is, why isn't this released on DVD in US yet?

To compare it with something familiar to movie viewers I would say it has a lot in common with `Jane Eyre' with a little touch of the American tale `The Miracle Worker.'Sophie Marceau is not only beautiful as expected, but delivers a very emotional, controlled performance as the new governess to a wealthy Englishman's child who also happens to be her own daughter.

The movie is shamefully ""out of print"" and as such this is the only way to get it. Most movies shelved in a distant back room and forgotten about by the studio aren't worth importing, but this one is.""Firelight"" is a movie that most people love for many reasons. I personally like the controversial plot that is established with the opening scene -- in which a beautiful young woman, Elisabeth, is questioned by an unseen gentlemen in order to be considered ""worthy"" of bearing his illegitimate child. The man, whose name we later learn is Charles, has lost his wife in a terrible horseback riding accident, leaving her comatose. He is for all intensive purposes, trapped, both by his libertine father's mounting debts and his inability to remarry, but his principles refuse to allow him to take a mistress, and so he wants a child to provide him with the love and affection the rest of his family cannot provide.Their first encounter is ""business"" in which she remains cold and withdrawn and he is understandably shy and distant. But somewhere between their curious conversations over the three days spent on the coast, and their second and third encounter, something sparks between them. Elisabeth is driven by remorse that she can never see him again, nor experience this kind of love for real, and he too takes delight in her. Seven years later, she turns up on his doorstep wanting to act as a governess to their daughter, and it all unfolds from there.Movies like this must be cautious or risk offending their audience -- and even as we might morally question the actions of the characters, the writer/director has done such a tremendous job that we are fond of them, fond enough to forgive and understand even their most shocking actions. Casual intimacy that turns out to be not-so-casual after all is not the only thing to raise your eyebrows, since also involved is a murder... or a mercy killing, however you wish to look at it.Everything about this production is exquisite. Gorgeous exterior shots, beautiful colors in the house contrasted with the bleak English countryside, lingering glances across lavish drawing rooms. The dialogue is marvelous, from his tentative observation that the light of the fire gives off more illumination than he expected to their passionate arguments. The performances are also flawless and have incredible chemistry. When they finally tenderly kiss, it is more erotic than most graphic love scenes. Which brings me to the love scenes... all things considered, they are not as graphic as one would expect. In fact, more movies would do well to learn something from them, because it is filmed as a union as much of mind as body, rather than one filled with explicit movement or moaning, and that, in my opinion, is what makes it so sexy.I saw this many years ago and then recently, and had to purchase the import because I love it so much.

457318,AVCRD98TH48RN,6305268843,D. Knouse,"[19, 21]","4.5 stars.  The one thing I've noticed about films set in England is that the pace of the film is exquisitely deliberate, like a great novel unfolding before my eyes. &quot;Firelight&quot; is no exception to this axiom.  The pace is slow yet fluid and flows so well that I was actually disappointed when the film ended.  I kept thinking, &quot;What happens next?&quot;  I was eager for the story to continue, which is the sign of an exceptional film.  However, this is not perfect, like so many reviewers here suggest.  It is nearly so.  The most obvious flaw is when Sophie Marceau is wading out into the water, breaking the ice to get to her daughter who just fell through.  The ice is fake, to put it simply, looking more like chunks of styro-foam than shards of broken ice.  Something else that bothered me was that Sophie's lover's wife is totally catatonic....and she is still alive in 1837?  It is hardly likely, being as unresponsive as she was, that she would have survived 10 years in that day and age.  They never showed her eating or doing anything during the course of the film, apparently asking the audience to think she survives on willpower alone. Also, when she finally passes, with a little assistance, the husband doesn't grieve very long for one who claimed to love her so dearly.  Sure, he is relieved of the burden, but a long-lost love just died.  I would be torn up, even if I hadn't spoke to her for 10 years.  She was there all along, a constant reminder of a great love that was once vibrant and alive.  But those inconsistencies, and other smaller and more insignificant moments, cannot take away from the fact that this is an elegant film with superb photography, great costumes and set design, and a passionate performance from the undeniable star of this engaging film, Sophie Marceau.  She uses so much subtlety in her work here that the end result is pure magnificence. The best part of this film is the ending, not that I wanted it to end.  Most British melodramas insist on a tragic ending, but to my delight and surprise this film does not embrace that convention.  Overall, this is a wonderful film, reminiscent of Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; and definately worth a look.",4,"Be patient, this is a British film.",1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,2223,"['4.5', 'stars', 'one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'films', 'set', 'England', 'pace', 'film', 'exquisitely', 'deliberate', 'great', 'novel', 'unfolding', 'eyes', 'quot', 'Firelight', 'quot', 'exception', 'axiom', 'pace', 'slow', 'yet', 'fluid', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'actually', 'disappointed', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'kept', 'thinking', 'quot', 'What', 'next', 'quot', 'was', 'eager', 'story', 'continue', 'sign', 'exceptional', 'film', 'However', 'not', 'perfect', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'suggest', 'nearly', 'so', 'most', 'obvious', 'flaw', 'when', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'wading', 'out', 'water', 'breaking', 'ice', 'get', 'daughter', 'who', 'just', 'fell', 'through', 'ice', 'fake', 'put', 'simply', 'looking', 'more', 'chunks', 'styro-foam', 'shards', 'broken', 'ice', 'Something', 'else', 'bothered', 'was', 'Sophie', 'lover', 'wife', 'totally', 'catatonic', '.and', 'still', 'alive', '1837', 'hardly', 'likely', 'being', 'as', 'unresponsive', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'survived', '10', 'years', 'day', 'age', 'never', 'showed', 'eating', 'doing', 'anything', 'course', 'film', 'apparently', 'asking', 'audience', 'think', 'willpower', 'alone', 'Also', 'when', 'finally', 'little', 'assistance', 'husband', ""n't"", 'grieve', 'very', 'long', 'one', 'who', 'claimed', 'love', 'so', 'dearly', 'Sure', 'relieved', 'burden', 'long-lost', 'love', 'just', 'died', 'would', 'be', 'torn', 'up', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'spoke', '10', 'years', 'was', 'there', 'all', 'along', 'constant', 'reminder', 'great', 'love', 'was', 'once', 'vibrant', 'alive', 'inconsistencies', 'other', 'smaller', 'more', 'insignificant', 'moments', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'elegant', 'film', 'superb', 'photography', 'great', 'costumes', 'set', 'design', 'passionate', 'performance', 'undeniable', 'star', 'engaging', 'film', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'so', 'much', 'subtlety', 'work', 'here', 'end', 'result', 'pure', 'magnificence', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'ending', 'not', 'wanted', 'end', 'Most', 'British', 'melodramas', 'insist', 'tragic', 'ending', 'delight', 'surprise', 'film', 'not', 'embrace', 'convention', 'Overall', 'wonderful', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'quot', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'quot', 'definately', 'look']",Firelight VHS

This film, however, is truly brilliant.  Even the most hard-core critic will have a difficult time deconstructing this masterpiece.  As for the acting, Sophie Marceau and Stephan Dillane give stirring performances.  Dillane is such a great actor.  After seeing his performance in &quot;Welcome to Sarajevo,&quot; I knew that &quot;Firelight&quot; would have a high calibre of acting.  This film will go on my movie shelf as a &quot;keeper.&quot;  Moreover, the premise of the story is very interesting.  Set in the early to mid nineteenth century, Charles (Dillane) engages Elizabeth (Marceau) in what he considers to be a purely &quot;business&quot; transaction.  Because his wife is invalid, he proposes to spend three nights with Elizabeth in order to impregnate her so that he might have an heir.  However, Elizabeth cannot keep her part of the bargain.  Even though &quot;Miss Louisa&quot; was conceived during the time of firelight, she cannot forget the daughter she gave birth to.  After seven years of searching, she finally finds her daughter and manages to obtain employment in Charles' household.  This film is so touching because it explores the bond between mother and child.  Just as Elizabeth yearned for her &quot;English daughter,&quot; her daughter yearned for her mother - a gap, which no father can fill, no matter how much love is given.

Here, an English gentleman (Stephen Dillane) is looking for a weekend of fairly anonymous sex in hopes of fathering a child, as his invalid wife is not up to the task. An impoverished Swiss miss (Sophie Marceau) is desperate for money due to her family's circumstances. She passes muster during the initial interview with the English gentleman and is hired for the job of potential surrogate mother. Their nights of anonymous sex turn out to be a surprise for both of them, yet they part with the understanding that they will never again meet. Their union having proved fruitful, she ultimately gives birth to a child, their daughter, who is taken from her immediately after birth and given to the father, as contracted. For seven long years they are separated. They are then all brought together, causing upheaval and tumultuous changes in all their lives.This is a well acted drama with fine performances by the entire cast. The only wrong note is struck by the child who plays the seven year old daughter. She is simply odious and obnoxious, making the viewer itch to slap her.

457338,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6305268843,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 4]","""Firelight"" is one of my favorite films.  I call it a classic, although many have never heard of it.  I recently showed it to the acting class I teach and the room broke out in applause at the closing credits.  With my videocassette copy quickly becoming outdated, I decided to get a DVD.  William Nicholson directed this.  He has two Oscar nominations for his screenplays for ""Shadowlands"" & ""The Gladiators.""  ""Firelight"" is certainly lyrical, moving slowly.  But it builds with such a certain steady climb with the rising action that by its climax, we hate to stop watching.  I think this is Sophie Marceau's shining moment, despite excellent appearances as Princess Isabelle in ""Brave Heart"" & as Polina Delacroix in ""Alex & Emma.""  As Elisabeth, she is mesmerizing.  Her intensity is so subtle yet gloriously clear.  One moment where she looks at a bare Charles rising from a swim, she catches her breath just a little and then struggles for control.  Stephan Dillane plays Charles Godwin.  I recently saw him inSavage Grace.  He also played Thomas Jefferson in ""John Adams"" and the husband to Nicole Kidman's Oscar-winning performance as Virigina Woolf inThe Hours.  As Charles, his performance also is a tightly controlled one that seeks to explode once behind closed doors.  Dominique Belcourt plays their daughter Louisa, sassy & unruly.  Lia Williams who was recently inThe Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomeyplays the sister-in-law Constance.  Hers is another subtle but riveting performance.  Kevin Anderson from Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre & whose first film was as Tom Cruise's buddy in ""Risky Business"" plays John Taylor, an Ohio farmer striking up a deal.  Joss Ackland who was in ""Shadowlands"" plays Charles' father Lord Clare.  I pull this film out and watch it every year or so.  It never fails to grip me, even as I begin to know it frame by frame.

Gregg,"[1, 1]","BEAUTIFUL Sophie Marceau plays a single, independent woman (as much as one could be back in those days where a woman could marry and be someone's property or be single and lonely as a governess).Her mother had died in childbirth, and she was raised by her dad. They don't tell you what he did, but her dad is in prison and she needed money to get him out. She could either marry well and have them pay to get her father out of prison (but then she'd be bound to that person for the rest of her life) - or she could sell herself short term, discreetly, and then get on with her life.  She choose the latter by way of agreeing to  carry a strangers child (he needed an heir) for a generous price - not knowing who he was or where that child went. She would only know of course that the child would be raised in a wealthy home. They spent 3 nights together and went their separate ways. When the time came for her to deliver, arrangements had been made with a woman to see to the delivery and the immediate whisking away of the baby to its father. ...A rather cold arrangement.What she hadn't counted on was how much that baby would mean to her - though she never saw it, just heard the midwives say it was a girl and hearing her first cry when her bottom was slapped before the women scurried off with her.  She clung to the memory of her child's cry and made pretty pictures in an album remembering the birthdays etc...to someday give to her child. And she spent 7 years searching for her.She finally finds a position as governess for her daughter, who is a complete brat and runs nannies/governesses off in short order.  When the child's father comes home from a business trip and is introduced to the new governess his sister-in-law hired - he (of course) recognizes her, freaks and says she must leave.  Unfortunately, they must give 1 month's notice so that the governess may find another working/living arrangement elsewhere, so he's stuck with her for 1 month.Within that time, she makes progress with the child and they develop a bond, and romance is kindled with the father.Not really a unique/special story, and the physical love scenes leave a lot to be desired.  Then there's the not-too-well-thought-out story of his wife ""who didn't die"" - she's in a coma for 10 yrs however back in those days there was no way they could've kept her alive for 10 yrs in her condition as they didn't do intravenous feeding and even if by some miracle they got broth down her throat, it's not likely they could've made her last 10 years.

Beautifully directed by William Nicholson and acted by the entire cast, especially Sophie Marceau as the governess Elisabeth Laurier and Stephen Dillane as the aristocratic Charles Godwin, individual scenes are certain to stay with the more sensitive viewer.But the happy, hopeful ending -- spoiler alert! -- is based upon the murder of a comatose patient by hypothermia. Why is the window wide open in winter? Who put out the fire? Does anyone care? (The patient's previous ten-year survival is itself most remarkable for 1830s England. For starters, how is this patient fed? Feeding tubes??? The scriptwriter, apparently, doesn't want viewers to think about such unromantic things, but for no-nonsense old me, they are troubling). In fact, the entire denouement is much too facile and glosses over anything that gets in the way of the two stars' raging hormones, including the murder of a comatose spouse and the earlier lack of reaction from a little girl who discovers that her beloved daddy is schtupping the governess.But jumping from the end back to the beginning, the less-than-subtle symbolism is really fun. For example, the aristocrat doesn't rest upon his ancestral laurels but is an avid sheep breeder. This, of course, is what triggers in him the idea of obtaining an heir though hiring a surrogate for breeding purposes. And thus, in a nice, neat Thomas Hardy way, the fun really gets started.",3,Romance vs Reality,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,1523,"['Firelight', 'initial', 'unrequited', 'passions', 'mainly', 'amoral', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'Beautifully', 'directed', 'William', 'Nicholson', 'acted', 'entire', 'cast', 'especially', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'governess', 'Elisabeth', 'Laurier', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'aristocratic', 'Charles', 'Godwin', 'individual', 'scenes', 'are', 'certain', 'stay', 'more', 'sensitive', 'happy', 'hopeful', 'ending', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'based', 'murder', 'comatose', 'patient', 'hypothermia', 'Why', 'window', 'wide', 'open', 'winter', 'Who', 'put', 'out', 'fire', 'Does', 'anyone', 'care', 'patient', 'previous', 'ten-year', 'survival', 'most', 'remarkable', '1830s', 'England', 'starters', 'how', 'patient', 'fed', 'Feeding', 'tubes', 'scriptwriter', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'want', 'viewers', 'think', 'such', 'unromantic', 'things', 'no-nonsense', 'old', 'are', 'troubling', 'fact', 'entire', 'denouement', 'much', 'too', 'facile', 'glosses', 'anything', 'way', 'two', 'stars', 'raging', 'hormones', 'including', 'murder', 'comatose', 'spouse', 'earlier', 'lack', 'reaction', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'beloved', 'daddy', 'schtupping', 'governess.But', 'jumping', 'end', 'back', 'beginning', 'less-than-subtle', 'symbolism', 'really', 'fun', 'example', 'aristocrat', ""n't"", 'rest', 'ancestral', 'laurels', 'avid', 'sheep', 'breeder', 'course', 'what', 'triggers', 'idea', 'obtaining', 'heir', 'hiring', 'surrogate', 'breeding', 'purposes', 'thus', 'nice', 'neat', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'way', 'fun', 'really', 'started']",Firelight VHS

457359,A29CUCGRX04TS8,6305268843,Sailoil,"[7, 7]","Firelight is a stunningly beautiful film, a real work of the cinematic art, that is successful on many levels.The plot is compelling.  A young penniless girl accepts a deal to bear a child for a wealthy aristocrat in return for payment.  In the course of their ""business deal"" are sown the seeds of a potential relationship.  But this is nipped in the bud.  A child is born and duly handed over.But the child acts as a magnet, drawing the mother in a search for her daughter, in her adopted role as governess.  And at last, she tracks down her daughter, and her erstwhile lover, to his estate, where he lives with his invalid wife.Can she, in the role of governess, capture the love of her unruly and wayward daughter?  Can she live under the roof of her daughters father and maintain a distance?The central theme of the film is Desire.  How strong and what a terrible thing is desire, that can tear up families, ruin estates and cause good men to kill?  As universal a question as can be found.All of this is the makings of a good film, but what elevates it to excellence are the cinematography and Sophie Marceau in the lead role.In firelight, we are told, when the lamps are turned off, time stands still.  And when the lamps are lit, and time starts again, what occurred by firelight is not only forgotten, but is as though it never happened.  By firelight the film is all yellows, browns and reds, warm and passionate.  The rooms small and cosy, filled with life and light.  But in daylight all is blue and grey, stark and cold.  The rooms are large, cold and empty.  Charles comments ""All these grand rooms and we live our lives within three feet of the fire"".  By day the film moves with the pace of a Jane Austen or a Bronte novel.  It is reminiscent of Stanley Kubricks film of Barry Lyndon, austere, paced, measured, like Bach or Hayden.  By firelight everything softens and warms and relaxes.  All of this is achieved by the cinematography.Marceau is now well know for her roles in Braveheart and The James Bond: World is Not Enough.  But this is a far more personal performance, more crafted.  And she is, if anything, more beautiful for being stilted in her environment.  She is the making of the film.  Stephen Dillane is excellent as her counterpart, but the low interest at the box office possibly had much to do with the fact that he is not the typical Mr Darcy character you would expect.  He is not tall, not dark and not handsome.  And yet, he is perfect in the role as the disapproving son of a spendthrift lord, the loyal husband of  a wife who is a vegetable, and the overindulgent father of a wayward daughter.As films go, this is a class act.

She keeps the bargain for 7 years, then tracks them down, and stays in his house with the daughter and his comatose wife.  They resume their intimate relations.  Husband kills wife.  They lament what he did but say it was worth it, and fall into each others' arms.  Daughter discovers her real mom and tells mom she's glad she was sold for a high price vs. a low one--mom and daughter joyfully unite and all 3 ride off into the sunset.  I gave this 2 stars because it was very predictable, and after several hearts were broken and one person killed in order for them to get together, I  could take no joy in their romance.

It was written and directed by William Nicholson. Who is he, you ask? He is a novelist, playwright, and screenwriter who co-authored Gladiator, wrote Shadowlands, Nell, First Knight, and many others. The story is extremely different for a period film, yet Bronte-type familiar in its plot.It begins with a single woman from Switzerland, named Elizabeth, in an interview with an elderly lady and an unidentified man in a chair who she cannot see. The position is unlike any job a woman would take in 1838 England. She agrees to father the stranger a child for the sum of 500 pounds and walk away giving him the baby and promising never to see him or the child again. Her motive for agreeing to do such an immoral act is only explained by one sentence - her father needs the money.When she finally meets her employer in a discreet location by the ocean, they have sex for three nights in a row. (Prepare yourself for moaning and full breast scenes.) She knows nothing about him - his name, where he lives, and why he is seeking a child in an immoral tryst when he is married. At first, it is a cold and detached union with one purpose - to impregnate her. However, by the third time, the two see each other as individuals and form a fragile attachment that is quickly severed by their parting. Nine months later, she bears him a little girl, which she never has the opportunity to hold or see.The story picks up eight years later with huge gaps and unexplained backstory that you are left to fill in on your own. Suddenly, Elisabeth shows up on Charles Godwin's doorstep who is the father of their child. She has been hired as a governess and meets her daughter for the first time. He is appalled that she has broken her promise and quickly goes to dismiss her but gives her one month's notice. Elizabeth is horrified to find a bratty little girl, Louisa, who is disrespectful and unschooled because governess after governess gives up on the unruly child.Then the story takes an unseen twist. Charles is still married to a woman who lies in a coma after a riding accident ten years earlier. Like the mad wife of Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre, she is tucked away in a room, lying in a bed, unresponsive with open eyes, a paralyzed body, and the inability to move or talk. (Of course, medically speaking because she's been that way for ten years, unable to swallow food or water, you have to believe the story is plausible. It takes a bit of imagination on your part. During that era, I doubt she would have survived but a few months.)Nevertheless, the story continues. Elizabeth forges a relationship with her daughter, but swears to Charles not to tell her the truth. As the days pass, Charles and Elisabeth rekindle their affections for one another and begin a sexual affair. So what happens next? Well, I'm not going to spoil it for you.It's a strange plot with a lot of holes and unexplained twists and turns. The affair between Charles and Elisabeth is understandable because of their odd relationship of having had a child together. Charles is obviously lonely and love-starved because of his unresponsive wife. Elizabeth sees Charles as the man who took her virginity, gave her a child, and who she fell in love with when they first met. Louisa is angry for having no mother and obviously acting out due to her own inward pain.Regardless of the plot holes, the movie does have endearing qualities and touching points. You can identify with the character's emotions and their motivations. However, in the end you will be left to judge the outcome on your own - was it right or wrong and will God have mercy on their souls?",4,Period Moviie with Some Merits,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,3726,"['Tucked', 'away', 'steaming', 'Amazon', 'period', 'movie', 'lost', 'crowd', 'Firelight', 'filmed', '1997', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'William', 'Nicholson', 'Who', 'ask', 'novelist', 'playwright', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'co-authored', 'Gladiator', 'wrote', 'Shadowlands', 'Nell', 'First', 'Knight', 'many', 'others', 'story', 'extremely', 'different', 'period', 'film', 'yet', 'Bronte-type', 'familiar', 'plot.It', 'single', 'woman', 'Switzerland', 'named', 'Elizabeth', 'interview', 'elderly', 'lady', 'unidentified', 'man', 'chair', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'position', 'job', 'woman', 'would', 'take', '1838', 'England', 'father', 'stranger', 'child', 'sum', '500', 'pounds', 'walk', 'away', 'giving', 'baby', 'promising', 'never', 'see', 'child', 'again', 'motive', 'agreeing', 'do', 'immoral', 'act', 'only', 'explained', 'one', 'sentence', 'father', 'money.When', 'finally', 'employer', 'discreet', 'location', 'ocean', 'have', 'sex', 'three', 'nights', 'row', 'Prepare', 'moaning', 'full', 'breast', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'name', 'where', 'why', 'seeking', 'child', 'immoral', 'tryst', 'when', 'married', 'first', 'cold', 'detached', 'union', 'one', 'purpose', 'impregnate', 'However', 'third', 'time', 'two', 'see', 'other', 'individuals', 'form', 'fragile', 'attachment', 'quickly', 'severed', 'parting', 'Nine', 'months', 'later', 'little', 'girl', 'never', 'opportunity', 'hold', 'see.The', 'story', 'up', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'huge', 'gaps', 'unexplained', 'backstory', 'are', 'left', 'fill', 'own', 'Suddenly', 'Elisabeth', 'up', 'Charles', 'Godwin', 'doorstep', 'who', 'father', 'child', 'been', 'hired', 'governess', 'daughter', 'first', 'time', 'appalled', 'broken', 'promise', 'quickly', 'dismiss', 'one', 'month', 'notice', 'Elizabeth', 'horrified', 'find', 'bratty', 'little', 'girl', 'Louisa', 'who', 'disrespectful', 'unschooled', 'governess', 'governess', 'up', 'unruly', 'child.Then', 'story', 'unseen', 'twist', 'Charles', 'still', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'coma', 'riding', 'accident', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'mad', 'wife', 'Edward', 'Rochester', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'tucked', 'away', 'room', 'lying', 'bed', 'unresponsive', 'open', 'eyes', 'paralyzed', 'body', 'inability', 'move', 'talk', 'course', 'medically', 'speaking', 'been', 'way', 'ten', 'years', 'unable', 'swallow', 'food', 'water', 'have', 'believe', 'story', 'plausible', 'bit', 'imagination', 'part', 'era', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'few', 'months', 'Nevertheless', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'swears', 'Charles', 'not', 'tell', 'truth', 'days', 'pass', 'Charles', 'Elisabeth', 'rekindle', 'affections', 'one', 'begin', 'sexual', 'affair', 'what', 'next', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'you.It', 'strange', 'plot', 'lot', 'holes', 'unexplained', 'twists', 'turns', 'affair', 'Charles', 'Elisabeth', 'understandable', 'odd', 'relationship', 'having', 'had', 'child', 'together', 'Charles', 'obviously', 'lonely', 'love-starved', 'unresponsive', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Charles', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'virginity', 'gave', 'child', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'Louisa', 'angry', 'having', 'mother', 'obviously', 'acting', 'out', 'due', 'own', 'inward', 'pain.Regardless', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'have', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'touching', 'points', 'can', 'identify', 'character', 'emotions', 'motivations', 'However', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'judge', 'outcome', 'own', 'was', 'right', 'wrong', 'will', 'God', 'have', 'mercy', 'souls']",Firelight VHS

Even in the 1.33-1 format it's wonderful.",5,Firelight,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,508,"['anyone', 'who', 'DVD', 'player', 'can', 'play', 'Region', '2', 'imports', 'price', 'buying', 'Region', '2', 'version', 'film', 'see', 'original', 'formating', 'other', 'reason', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'intended', 'format', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'buy', 'region', 'player', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'film', 'hope', 'someday', 'someone', 'may', 'think', 'issue', 'Blu-Ray', 'not', 'non-USA', 'format', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'please', 'do', 'favor', 'Even', '1.33-1', 'format', 'wonderful']",Firelight VHS
