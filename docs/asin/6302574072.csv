321178,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302574072,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 4]","""They were your friends!"" cries Maggie Harwood when she walks in on the pistol-holding, aged but well preserved Philippe. Lying on the rug behind him are his two, now dead, associates. ""Well,' says Philippe, ""we weren't that close.""Maggie (Penelope Ann Miller) is the heroine in this romantic comedy thriller. While the hero is the overly handsome, strong-jawed and mustachioed Oliver Plexico (Tim Daly), the real sex appeal comes from Philippe as played by 73-year-old Louis Jourdan. This was his last film. While many may remember him as the dashing and love-struck Gaston Lachaille in Gigi, he remains more fondly in my heart as Dr. Arcane in Swamp Thing. Like Dr. Arcane, Philippe is an incorrigibly well-mannered, egocentric and murderous creep. I suspect there are few actors as good as Jourdan who would be willing to semi-sing, while smacking his lips, leering and snapping his fingers, ""There are chicks just ripe for some kissin'And I mean to kiss me a few!Then those chicks don't know what they're missin'I got a lot of livin' to do!""Jourdan does it. It's grotesquely funny.The Year of the Comet is all about wine, and especially about an extraordinarily rare bottle of wine, an 1811 Lafite, that was once part of Bonaparte's cellar. In auction it could bring at least a million dollars. Maggie, who works for her father, the wine merchant Sir Mason Harwood (Ian Richardson), is sent to Scotland to appraise an extensive wine collection that Harwood and Company may be commissioned to place in auction. Maggie, who knows almost as much about wine as her father, may be ""a funny, over-worked ragamuffin"" but she got the assignment from her father by telling him he either gives her this chance to show just how good she is or she's quitting. Now she's knocking on the great oaken door of an isolated Scottish castle to appraise the wine. Unknown to Maggie, she's interrupting the torture of the owner by Philippe and his men. Philippe assures his victim that shoving the hypodermic needle with a certain drug right in the eyeball won't interfere with the man's vision...although it will cause exquisite pain later with each blink. All that we know is that there is a formula Philippe is determined to have. Maggie is taken to the cellar and this is when, brushing off centuries of cobwebs and grime while she looks at these hundreds of encrusted wine bottles, she makes her discovery...the 1811 Lafite. And it's just a short while later that Maggie makes more discoveries. First, she finds Oliver looking for her, the man who prefers beer and calls wine a beverage. She met him at a wine tasting at Harwoods. She and Oliver discover the body of the owner in the wine cellar and they discover Philippe and his crew absconding with the bottle of Lafite.The chase is on! Sometimes Maggie and Oliver chase Philippe. Sometimes he's chasing them. They chase around with cars, motorbikes, helicopters, airplanes and rowboats. They chase scenically through the cold, rocky mountains of Scotland and the warm slopes of the French Rivera. Maggie and Oliver bicker, kiss, bicker, fall in love and bicker. And then they wind up having to listen to Philippe sing ""Gotta lotta livin' to do."" By now we've realized (this is no spoiler) that this adventure has as much to do with the secret formula and glands as it has to do with wine.Year of the Comet strains to be a Hitchcock romantic thriller. While it doesn't come close it's an engaging, undemanding romp. The script is by William Goldman, a man who knows what he's doing with this sort of thing. Try Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid or The Princess Bride. He works wonders with the clich&eacute;s he deliberately uses. The direction, however, is a letdown. It's clunky and never lets the script build much steam, either in the chases or in the romance department. I don't know what happened to Peter Yates, but the director of Bullitt, Breaking Away and Eyewitness just doesn't seem engaged. Miller and Daly are attractive enough, although Daly is better at being handsome than at being an amusing speaker of clever lines. Cary Grant needn't worry. The real pleasures of the movie, other than the plot, are Louis Jourdan (now nearly 90 and living in France) and Ian Richardson, such a sly actor. Ian McNeice as one of Philippe's men holds his own.Year of the Comet is amusing fluff, undemanding and a pleasant adventure. I liked it enough to have watched it twice in four years.

321180,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302574072,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Tim Daly seems to be known more for his moments on television than for his ventures into motion picture. He really just doesn't have a lot of defining roles in cinema. In the small screen, he starred memorably in WINGS and then, more recently, in the very short lived THE FUGITIVE and THE NINE. And, lest the fanboys forget, he was the voice of the WB's animated Superman in the mid to late '90s. But he did have that one movie, even if it's not that well known. One of the very few of his cinematic efforts which does stand out in my mind - even to this day - is 1992's YEAR OF THE COMET, which is a modest and lighthearted foray into a world where wine, skullduggery, and the quest for eternal youth bump heads. Tim Daly is outstanding as Oliver Plexico, the boorish, semi-dashing hero with the lower back affliction. This is also the film in which I developed a huge crush on Penelope Ann Miller.Here's the plot: Miller plays the prim and proper (but very pretty) Margaret Harwood, the daughter of a London wine merchant. Margaret is steeped in wine lore, certainly knowing much more about the trade than her snooty, British half-brother. But, because she's a woman, she's relegated to handling the menial, every day tasks of the business. She dearly wants to travel and be an appraiser of wine. She finally gives her father an ultimatum: assign her a legitimate project or she walks. Her father, knowing her worth, reluctantly caves, and Margaret is off to Scotland to catalogue a castle's wine cellar.There, she stumbles into intrigue and great peril as she unearths a giant, dusty bottle of rare vintage, labeled as an 1811 Lafite and possibly once belonging to Napoleon Bonaparte. Incidentally, 1811 is referred to as the Year of the Comet, the ""most legendary year in the history of wine."" The very next morning, she meets up with crass, beer swilling Oliver Plexico (Daly), the errand boy of a Texas wine connoisseur who'd already agreed to purchase the Lafite. But, shortly after, Margaret and Plexico find themselves in mortal danger as various strange and intimidating men begin to pursue them.All this hoopla for a bottle of wine, or as Oliver Plexico bemusedly wonders, ""I can't believe we're doing all this for a beverage."" But the movie works, and works wonderfully. The very capable William Goldman scribes the screenplay and turns what could've been a dull, mediocre story into something that's still fairly predictable but, in his hands, also becomes frothy, engagingly tongue-in-cheek, and very romantic. And let's not forget funny. The film also benefits from the delightful backdrops of the French Riviera and Scotland (although Oliver's statement of ""All I know is, I just...hate Scotland."" can be forgiven, given what he's been thru).And then there's the acting and rapport of the two leads. By no means are these two stars A-listers, but, in this film, they give their best performances, or, at least, my favorite performances. Penelope Ann Miller gets the film's top billing and she's fetching as the cultured, uptight girl with surprising reserves of gumption. She instills Maggie with a certain innocent, almost waiflike quality, which, by the way, only serves to make her even sexier in that one bathtub shot (sorry, rated PG-13). These two actors emit a certain heat between them as, decidedly, their thorny but playful give and take chemistry becomes the film's single, greatest asset. From the moment they began to insult each other, you had a feelin' about these two...Tim Daly - fit, poofy-haired, and mustached - shows here that he can play the rugged, wrily charming hero with the best of 'em. I like that he isn't portrayed as a James Bondian type who casually routs the bad guys. In fact, if memory serves me, Oliver Plexico gets beat up more times than he gets to deliver a smackdown on people. French actor Louis Jordan plays his villainous part with fervor; even when he tortures his victims, he displays a debonair French flair. The other noteworthy role here is that old woman who plays the eavesdropping Scottish landlady. She's a treat.Someday, some happy day, the powers that be will produce a Region 1 dvd of YEAR OF THE COMET (and, hopefully, it'll be in widescreen, with extra features, but that might be asking for too much). Until then, I'll settle for my Region 2 dvd and my VHS tape copy, which are the only ways for me to reliably catch up again with Oliver Plexico - who's more than he seems - and his ""funny, overworked ragamuffin.""",5,"""I can't believe we're doing all this for a beverage.""",1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,4488,"['Tim', 'Daly', 'be', 'known', 'more', 'moments', 'television', 'ventures', 'motion', 'picture', 'really', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'defining', 'roles', 'cinema', 'small', 'screen', 'starred', 'memorably', 'WINGS', 'then', 'more', 'recently', 'very', 'short', 'lived', 'THE', 'FUGITIVE', 'THE', 'NINE', 'lest', 'fanboys', 'forget', 'was', 'voice', 'WB', 'animated', 'Superman', 'mid', 'late', ""'90s"", 'did', 'have', 'one', 'movie', 'even', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'known', 'One', 'very', 'few', 'cinematic', 'efforts', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'even', 'day', '1992', 'YEAR', 'THE', 'COMET', 'modest', 'lighthearted', 'foray', 'world', 'where', 'wine', 'skullduggery', 'quest', 'eternal', 'youth', 'bump', 'heads', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'outstanding', 'Oliver', 'Plexico', 'boorish', 'semi-dashing', 'hero', 'lower', 'back', 'affliction', 'also', 'film', 'developed', 'huge', 'crush', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller.Here', 'plot', 'Miller', 'prim', 'proper', 'very', 'pretty', 'Margaret', 'Harwood', 'daughter', 'London', 'wine', 'merchant', 'Margaret', 'steeped', 'wine', 'lore', 'certainly', 'knowing', 'much', 'more', 'trade', 'snooty', 'British', 'half-brother', 'woman', 'relegated', 'handling', 'menial', 'day', 'tasks', 'business', 'dearly', 'travel', 'be', 'appraiser', 'wine', 'finally', 'father', 'ultimatum', 'assign', 'legitimate', 'project', 'father', 'knowing', 'worth', 'reluctantly', 'Margaret', 'Scotland', 'catalogue', 'castle', 'wine', 'cellar.There', 'intrigue', 'great', 'peril', 'giant', 'dusty', 'bottle', 'rare', 'vintage', 'labeled', '1811', 'Lafite', 'possibly', 'once', 'belonging', 'Napoleon', 'Bonaparte', 'Incidentally', '1811', 'referred', 'Year', 'Comet', 'most', 'legendary', 'year', 'history', 'wine', 'very', 'next', 'morning', 'up', 'crass', 'beer', 'swilling', 'Oliver', 'Plexico', 'Daly', 'errand', 'boy', 'Texas', 'wine', 'connoisseur', 'who', ""'d"", 'already', 'agreed', 'purchase', 'Lafite', 'shortly', 'Margaret', 'Plexico', 'find', 'mortal', 'danger', 'various', 'strange', 'intimidating', 'men', 'begin', 'pursue', 'hoopla', 'bottle', 'wine', 'Oliver', 'Plexico', 'bemusedly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'re"", 'doing', 'beverage', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'very', 'capable', 'William', 'Goldman', 'screenplay', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dull', 'mediocre', 'story', 'something', 'still', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'hands', 'also', 'frothy', 'engagingly', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'very', 'romantic', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'funny', 'film', 'also', 'benefits', 'delightful', 'backdrops', 'French', 'Riviera', 'Scotland', 'Oliver', 'statement', 'All', 'know', 'just', 'hate', 'Scotland', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'given', 'what', 'been', 'thru', '.And', 'then', 'acting', 'rapport', 'two', 'leads', 'means', 'are', 'two', 'stars', 'A-listers', 'film', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'least', 'favorite', 'performances', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'film', 'top', 'billing', 'fetching', 'cultured', 'uptight', 'girl', 'surprising', 'reserves', 'gumption', 'Maggie', 'certain', 'innocent', 'almost', 'quality', 'way', 'only', 'make', 'even', 'sexier', 'one', 'bathtub', 'shot', 'sorry', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'two', 'actors', 'emit', 'certain', 'heat', 'decidedly', 'thorny', 'playful', 'give', 'take', 'chemistry', 'film', 'single', 'greatest', 'asset', 'moment', 'began', 'insult', 'other', 'had', 'feelin', 'two', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'fit', 'poofy-haired', 'mustached', 'shows', 'here', 'can', 'play', 'rugged', 'wrily', 'charming', 'hero', 'best', 'like', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'James', 'Bondian', 'type', 'who', 'casually', 'bad', 'guys', 'fact', 'memory', 'serves', 'Oliver', 'Plexico', 'beat', 'up', 'more', 'times', 'deliver', 'smackdown', 'people', 'French', 'actor', 'Louis', 'Jordan', 'villainous', 'part', 'fervor', 'even', 'when', 'victims', 'debonair', 'French', 'flair', 'other', 'noteworthy', 'role', 'here', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'eavesdropping', 'Scottish', 'landlady', 'treat.Someday', 'happy', 'day', 'powers', 'be', 'will', 'produce', 'Region', '1', 'dvd', 'YEAR', 'THE', 'COMET', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'widescreen', 'extra', 'features', 'might', 'be', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'then', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'Region', '2', 'dvd', 'VHS', 'tape', 'copy', 'are', 'only', 'ways', 'reliably', 'catch', 'up', 'again', 'Oliver', 'Plexico', 'who', 'more', 'funny', 'overworked', 'ragamuffin']",Year of the Comet VHS

To say that it's special would be an understatement of monumental proportions. Oenophiles don't dream of women - they dream of bottles. And The Year Of The Comet is 'The Year' to own.As 2013 will host a pair of so-called notable comets, perhaps providing the best views since The Year Of The Comet and likely the last chance this century for such a viewing, I decided to put time in and give praise to one of my favorite films of the same name. One of the best romantic comedies of the 90s; arguably equal to many of its better known contemporaries like 'Pretty Woman' and 'Jerry Maguire'.Tells the story of Margaret 'Maggie' Harwood, the younger child to Sir Mason Harwood, managing partner of Harwood House, a premiere wine brokerage. Her upbringing in America due to a divorce during which her mother won custody. Returning to the family business, she finds herself as a second rate menial, a peon. Her older half-brother the long presumptive successor - Margaret is therefore delegated to  setting, washing and cleaning up after the tastings. Her dream of brokering a wine cellar growing more distant with each passing year. Frustrated that her incompetent and emotionally twisted older sibling gets all the plum assignments - she makes one last final appeal to her father: Give her a client or she's gone. It's not an idle threat. Despite her love of both father and the business, she's no longer doing the slave bit.Stunned that his little obedient automaton has a voice of her own, he relents.There's a small cellar they've been asked to disperse. An absentee Scottish laird - a lord of a castle and estate - passed away with no designated heir for the wine and spirits collection. Her job: Inventory, evaluate, and prep for shipment to their London firm.Unbeknownst to all - the unoccupied manor is already occupied. Some very unsavory characters have made it their base of operations. One of whom is being tortured for information that has absolutely nothing to with crushed grapes. And he's about to die - in the wine cellar.Refusing to be brushed away in her very first, and if unsuccessful, only assignment - she demands to see the cellar. Threatening to call the police if she cannot verify the contents of the collection, the villains decide that discretion is the better part of confrontation, they allow her access to the cache. Not realizing until it's too late that the information that they so desperately seek was scribbled onto a wine bottle. A rather large and dusty wine bottle. The same bottle that Maggie is about to rediscover.Uncovering one of the most important treasures of the 20th century, and perhaps the greatest wine discovery in nearly two hundred years, she's located a magnum from the personal store of Napoleon I, Emperor of France and conqueror of Europe. It's estimated value: USD$1,000,000.00. The single most expensive bottle of wine in the world, and Maggie found it hidden away by a throwaway client.The problem is that such a find can't and won't be quiet for long. Soon slimy agents of the ultra wealthy and various nogoodniks are making their way to Scotland. By hook or crook, they want that bottle. They'll kill if they have to in order to obtain it.Making the situation even more volatile (fun) is Maggie's airborne chauffeur. Devilishly handsome, overwhelmingly smarmy, and apparently multitalented in all manner of maneuvers - besides behind the stick of a chopper. Her exuberance at locating the magnum bubbles over to her personal life as she and one Oliver Plexico fall into bed. Very unlike her, but the passion she's held back for so long suddenly makes its way out of her corked social life.As the various factions battle for the wine - Maggie and Oliver find themselves pitted against the villains, the elements, and even each other.A tightly woven and superbly acted romantic comedy in the best tradition of 'It Happened One Night' and 'Libeled Lady'.Personal Note:- Strangely, and perhaps as a form of self-flagellate punishment, Tim Daly has never taken pride of performance in this wonderful movie. Even going so far as to showcase it as an error in judgment during a cameo appearance in the tv show ""Monk"".I honestly did not and do not understand his embarrassment of this terrific and very enjoyable film.",5,A Very Special Year,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,4504,"['1811', 'was', 'auspicious', 'year', 'grape', 'few', 'remaining', 'bottles', 'various', 'vineyards', 'Europe', 'command', 'prices', 'today', 'can', 'easily', 'purchase', 'multi-bedroom', 'home', 'large', 'tract', 'property', 'most', 'US', 'real', 'estate', 'markets', 'say', 'special', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'monumental', 'proportions', 'Oenophiles', 'do', ""n't"", 'dream', 'women', 'dream', 'bottles', 'Year', 'Comet', ""'The"", 'Year', 'own.As', '2013', 'will', 'host', 'pair', 'so-called', 'notable', 'comets', 'perhaps', 'providing', 'best', 'views', 'Year', 'Comet', 'likely', 'last', 'chance', 'century', 'viewing', 'decided', 'put', 'time', 'give', 'praise', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'same', 'name', 'One', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', '90s', 'arguably', 'equal', 'many', 'better', 'known', 'contemporaries', ""'Pretty"", 'Woman', ""'Jerry"", ""Maguire'.Tells"", 'story', 'Margaret', ""'Maggie"", 'Harwood', 'younger', 'child', 'Sir', 'Mason', 'Harwood', 'managing', 'partner', 'Harwood', 'House', 'premiere', 'wine', 'brokerage', 'upbringing', 'America', 'due', 'divorce', 'mother', 'won', 'custody', 'Returning', 'family', 'business', 'second', 'rate', 'menial', 'peon', 'older', 'half-brother', 'long', 'presumptive', 'successor', 'Margaret', 'therefore', 'delegated', 'setting', 'washing', 'cleaning', 'up', 'tastings', 'dream', 'brokering', 'wine', 'cellar', 'growing', 'more', 'distant', 'passing', 'year', 'Frustrated', 'incompetent', 'emotionally', 'twisted', 'older', 'sibling', 'plum', 'one', 'last', 'final', 'appeal', 'father', 'Give', 'client', 'gone', 'not', 'idle', 'threat', 'love', 'father', 'business', 'no', 'longer', 'doing', 'slave', 'bit.Stunned', 'little', 'obedient', 'automaton', 'voice', 'own', 'small', 'cellar', ""'ve"", 'been', 'asked', 'disperse', 'absentee', 'Scottish', 'laird', 'lord', 'castle', 'estate', 'passed', 'away', 'designated', 'heir', 'wine', 'spirits', 'collection', 'job', 'Inventory', 'evaluate', 'prep', 'shipment', 'London', 'firm.Unbeknownst', 'unoccupied', 'manor', 'already', 'occupied', 'very', 'unsavory', 'characters', 'have', 'made', 'base', 'operations', 'One', 'whom', 'being', 'tortured', 'information', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'crushed', 'grapes', 'die', 'wine', 'cellar.Refusing', 'be', 'brushed', 'away', 'very', 'first', 'unsuccessful', 'only', 'assignment', 'see', 'cellar', 'Threatening', 'call', 'police', 'can', 'not', 'verify', 'contents', 'collection', 'villains', 'decide', 'discretion', 'better', 'part', 'confrontation', 'allow', 'access', 'cache', 'Not', 'realizing', 'too', 'late', 'information', 'so', 'desperately', 'seek', 'was', 'scribbled', 'wine', 'bottle', 'rather', 'large', 'dusty', 'wine', 'bottle', 'same', 'bottle', 'Maggie', 'rediscover.Uncovering', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'treasures', '20th', 'century', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'wine', 'discovery', 'nearly', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'located', 'magnum', 'personal', 'store', 'Napoleon', 'Emperor', 'France', 'conqueror', 'Europe', 'estimated', 'value', 'USD', '1,000,000.00', 'single', 'most', 'expensive', 'bottle', 'wine', 'world', 'Maggie', 'found', 'away', 'throwaway', 'client.The', 'problem', 'find', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'quiet', 'long', 'Soon', 'slimy', 'agents', 'ultra', 'wealthy', 'various', 'nogoodniks', 'are', 'making', 'way', 'Scotland', 'hook', 'crook', 'want', 'bottle', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'have', 'order', 'obtain', 'it.Making', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'volatile', 'fun', 'Maggie', 'airborne', 'chauffeur', 'Devilishly', 'handsome', 'overwhelmingly', 'smarmy', 'apparently', 'multitalented', 'manner', 'maneuvers', 'stick', 'chopper', 'exuberance', 'locating', 'magnum', 'personal', 'life', 'one', 'Oliver', 'Plexico', 'fall', 'bed', 'Very', 'passion', 'held', 'back', 'so', 'long', 'suddenly', 'way', 'corked', 'social', 'life.As', 'various', 'factions', 'battle', 'wine', 'Maggie', 'Oliver', 'find', 'pitted', 'villains', 'elements', 'even', 'other.A', 'tightly', 'woven', 'superbly', 'acted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'best', 'tradition', ""'It"", 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', ""'Libeled"", ""Lady'.Personal"", 'Note', 'Strangely', 'perhaps', 'form', 'self-flagellate', 'punishment', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'never', 'taken', 'pride', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'showcase', 'error', 'judgment', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'tv', 'show', 'Monk', 'honestly', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'embarrassment', 'terrific', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film']",Year of the Comet VHS

The acting isn't too great, the characters cheesy and the plot silly but it's watchable.I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it never made a big impact.For a romance it was disappointing. The characters are thrown together and fall in love in a day. I guess it's supposed to be spontaneous but it just seemed ridiculous to me. The so-called villains act like they jumped out of a Pink Panther cartoon.This was definitely a mixed bag for me. It starts off intriguing but becomes less and less interesting as it goes on.I wouldn't have kept watching it if Tim Daly hadn't looked so hot in it.
