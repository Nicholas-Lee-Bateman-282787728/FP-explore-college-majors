Joan Crawford stars as an older spinster who falls for the young,handsome Burt (Cliff Robertson) There's a fling at the beach,flirting over chicken salad sandwiches,and an impulsive wedding in Mexico. Soon after that,he's confronted with his ex-wife (Vera Miles) and his father (Lorne Greene,in his pre-Adama days)""Autumn Leaves"" explains Joan's appeal among gays. There's an age difference,there is a stigma to the relationship, the younger man is deemed neurotic and shipped off to a mental ward (foreshadowing Robertson's Oscar-winning role in ""Charly"") It's no wonder her movies were (and to some extent,still are) revered at the Castro Theater.""Autumn Leaves"" has PLENTY of expected twists. There are some unintentionally hilarious moments,such as when Greene tells Crawford ""Burt loves you like a mother"" (she's already married him) The romance is at once Oedipal and sexy. Cliff Robertson,who now stars as Peter Parker's loveable uncle in the Spider-Man series, was quite hunky back in the day. There's psychological tension! Overacting!

She plays Millicent (Milly) Wetherby, a lonely 40ish woman who has sacrificed her youth taking care of her invalid father. Now he is gone and she feels like life has passed her by until Burt Hanson (Cliff Robertson in only his second film appearance) interrupts her chicken salad one night at a diner. He practically pries open her life, and they begin dating even though he is over ten years younger than she. She tries to be practical, but he sweeps her off her feet and the two elope to Mexico. Then Milly starts to notice little things...Burt has told her he was from Racine, now he says he is from Chicago. Burt meets Milly's employer and talks about all of the battles he saw in the military when he has told her previously that he was a supply clerk and never saw action during his time in the service, but the final straw is when an ex-wife she didn't even know about shows up at her door.This is a hard film to characterize. It's definitely not a soaper, but it has aspects of that. It has romance, dealing with mental illness, and even elements of a thriller to it. It deals with the self-doubt we all have about the choices we have made in life. No high-camp Johnny Guitar is this film. Although, don't get me wrong, I love Joan in her campy 50's films too.Cliff Robertson is almost at the bottom of the bill on this one, even though he really is the male lead. This is only his second film, yet he pulls off the part of the child-like Burt like a pro. It's also good to see Ruth Donnelly as Milly's ever-supportive older neighbor twenty years after she was a contract player over at Warner Brothers. I highly recommend this film for anyone who even remotely enjoys Joan Crawford's films. You don't have to be a big fan to appreciate this one.Sony should really put this one on DVD.

350415,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6303011403,darragh o'donoghue,"[6, 8]","Robert Aldrich drags (pun intended) the 1940s 'woman's picture' and Freudian melodrama violently screaming into the blandly conformist 1950s, creating a demented leftist classic.  We are so used these days to seeing balding old actors having their egos massaged by nubile young actresses, it's nice to see a Hollywood film that turns the tables for a change, even if the double-standard decrees that the woman's 'punishment' for such taboo transgression is Oedipal crises, insanity, conspiracies and domestic brutality.Joan Crawford is in her self-sacrificing, suffering element as a middle-aged spinster, whose professional and financial independence, unheard of in the family-values/woman=housewife 50s (and provocatively located in the home, from where, way ahead of her time, she works as a for-hire, boss-less typist), is matched by a barren emotional life.  On a rare, disppointing, outing, she meets (or, more accurately, has thrust upon her) a pushy, talkative young man, with whom she begins, after hesitation over feared social disapproval, a life-saving romance.  to the audience, the young man's nervy volubility and suspicious actions simply suggest a conman picking up a lonely vulnerable woman, but there soon unravels darker secrets, much more fundamental to the aggressively self-confident, delusive America of the era.it would spoil the delirious development of the narrative to reveal any more: suffice it to say the sacred cow of the family is slaughtered, in particular paternal authority, revealed as phoney, malevolent and perverse, actually trying to reverse the process of social order (as adapted from Freud's Oedipal theory), rather than unpholding it.  The 1940s psychoanalytic film tended to limit itself to individual trauma, or, at most, suggest the healing possibilities for war-derived trauma.  Aldrich's variant applies the psychic repressions of individuals to the political, social and cultural repressions of a nation, showing how their only outlet is in violence.  the transgressor can only by brought back into the fold by brainwashing (euphemised by the bland jargon of experts), as shown in a horrifying montage anticipating 'A Clockwork Orange'.this violence is embodied in Aldrich's film form, with its wild lurches in tone and genre, the disorientation of editing and composition, the increasing hysteria of the acting and the neurotic shocks of the very imaginative soundtrack, both music and sounds.Aldrich's plot bears some similarity to THE great 50s melodrama, Douglas Sirk's 'All That Heaven allows', and he shares with the German an interest in using the popular weepie as a vehicle for locating crises in the family and society.  His visual style is also similar - the use of frames within the screen (doorways, windows, mirrors etc.) to create proscenium arches, suggesting the falseness, the theatricality of a society based on social and gender performances, rather than true feeling.  Aldrich's style is more heavy-handed than the graceful Sirk's, stridently imposing his points, but he achieves some remarkable effects, such as an early flashback where a concert audience blacks out a haloed Crawford, as she remembers in headless flashback the family scene that determined her solitary future.  His ability to make restrictive interiors suddently seem vast and alienating, is also striking.Crawford, her grimly clenched, over-lipsticked mouth mummified in an androgynous, Edith Piaf-like death mask, is fantastic.",4,Excellent dry run for 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?',1005696000,"11 14, 2001",2001,3471,"['Robert', 'Aldrich', 'pun', 'intended', '1940s', ""'woman"", 'picture', 'Freudian', 'melodrama', 'violently', 'screaming', 'blandly', 'conformist', '1950s', 'creating', 'demented', 'leftist', 'classic', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'days', 'seeing', 'balding', 'old', 'actors', 'having', 'egos', 'massaged', 'nubile', 'young', 'actresses', 'nice', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'tables', 'change', 'even', 'double-standard', 'decrees', 'woman', ""'punishment"", 'such', 'taboo', 'transgression', 'Oedipal', 'crises', 'insanity', 'conspiracies', 'domestic', 'brutality.Joan', 'Crawford', 'self-sacrificing', 'suffering', 'element', 'middle-aged', 'spinster', 'professional', 'financial', 'independence', 'unheard', 'family-values/woman=housewife', '50s', 'provocatively', 'located', 'home', 'where', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'for-hire', 'boss-less', 'typist', 'matched', 'barren', 'emotional', 'life', 'rare', 'disppointing', 'outing', 'more', 'accurately', 'thrust', 'pushy', 'talkative', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'hesitation', 'feared', 'social', 'disapproval', 'life-saving', 'romance', 'audience', 'young', 'man', 'nervy', 'volubility', 'suspicious', 'actions', 'simply', 'suggest', 'conman', 'picking', 'up', 'lonely', 'vulnerable', 'woman', 'there', 'soon', 'unravels', 'darker', 'secrets', 'much', 'more', 'fundamental', 'aggressively', 'self-confident', 'delusive', 'America', 'era.it', 'would', 'spoil', 'delirious', 'development', 'narrative', 'reveal', 'more', 'suffice', 'say', 'sacred', 'cow', 'family', 'slaughtered', 'particular', 'paternal', 'authority', 'revealed', 'phoney', 'malevolent', 'perverse', 'actually', 'trying', 'reverse', 'process', 'social', 'order', 'adapted', 'Freud', 'Oedipal', 'theory', 'rather', 'unpholding', '1940s', 'psychoanalytic', 'film', 'tended', 'limit', 'individual', 'trauma', 'most', 'suggest', 'healing', 'possibilities', 'war-derived', 'trauma', 'Aldrich', 'variant', 'psychic', 'repressions', 'individuals', 'political', 'social', 'cultural', 'repressions', 'nation', 'showing', 'how', 'only', 'outlet', 'violence', 'transgressor', 'can', 'only', 'brought', 'back', 'fold', 'brainwashing', 'euphemised', 'bland', 'jargon', 'experts', 'shown', 'horrifying', 'montage', 'anticipating', 'Clockwork', ""Orange'.this"", 'violence', 'embodied', 'Aldrich', 'film', 'form', 'wild', 'lurches', 'tone', 'genre', 'disorientation', 'editing', 'composition', 'increasing', 'hysteria', 'acting', 'neurotic', 'shocks', 'very', 'imaginative', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'sounds.Aldrich', 'plot', 'similarity', 'THE', 'great', '50s', 'melodrama', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', ""'All"", 'Heaven', 'shares', 'German', 'interest', 'using', 'popular', 'weepie', 'vehicle', 'locating', 'crises', 'family', 'society', 'visual', 'style', 'also', 'similar', 'use', 'frames', 'screen', 'doorways', 'windows', 'mirrors', 'etc', 'create', 'proscenium', 'arches', 'suggesting', 'falseness', 'theatricality', 'society', 'based', 'social', 'gender', 'performances', 'rather', 'true', 'feeling', 'Aldrich', 'style', 'more', 'heavy-handed', 'graceful', 'Sirk', 'stridently', 'imposing', 'points', 'remarkable', 'effects', 'such', 'early', 'flashback', 'where', 'concert', 'audience', 'blacks', 'out', 'haloed', 'Crawford', 'headless', 'flashback', 'family', 'scene', 'determined', 'solitary', 'future', 'ability', 'make', 'restrictive', 'interiors', 'suddently', 'seem', 'vast', 'alienating', 'also', 'striking.Crawford', 'grimly', 'clenched', 'over-lipsticked', 'mouth', 'mummified', 'androgynous', 'Edith', 'Piaf-like', 'death', 'mask', 'fantastic']",Autumn Leaves VHS

She emerges from the bedroom where we see a black phone in the center of the screen which seems enormous.  She gathers her resolve and approaches the phone.  The camera then films her from below, with her upper face highlighted.

Joan discovers he is a mental illnes and some other skeletons in the closet.For me, The point of the movie is't will she take him back, but will her love for him persevere through everything....The excellent Lorne Green and Vera Miles add a nice touch. Also Milli's only close confidante, her neighbor Liz is quite endearing and her delivers her lines in a pleasent,more realistic way than viewers have grown accustomed to from all those movie from the golden age of hollywood.Although the theme of this film is more about the love each character has for one another,and too much of a melodrama to be really a (long) study of mental illness practices, it is still one of the best old hollywood films I have seen on the subjest.ALso LOVED ""the snake pit"" with Olivia Dehavilland...This movie has a very sweet ending and is very worth watching.

350420,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6303011403,JGC,"[1, 1]","I first saw this movie several years ago, and perhaps I was too young to really appreciate it because at the time I didn't realize that this was such a beautiful, powerful and moving story. But over time, like the love that Milly felt for Burt, I have totally fallen in love with this movie. I am ashamed of myself for not giving ""Autumn Leaves"" its due credit and for not realizing how essential the story was when I first saw it.It seemed like during the '50s Joan was terribly typecast. She either played the horrible man-eater, or in a reverse-role, she played the sympathetic heroine. But in ""Autumn Leaves"" she is able to stand-out and truly gives one of her best dramatic performances of her entire 6-decade career. Why Joan was not nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.""Autumn Leaves"" says so much and is so almost overt while still always remaining almost peaceful and rather sublime (and rather poetic, too). The movie's like the classic country song by The Bellamy Brothers, ""let your love grow with the smallest of dreams...""The performances by everyone in this production is second to none. Cliff Robertson (as the hopeful yet harried Mr. Burt Hanson) was magnanimous and powerful because each syllable he uttered conveyed the emotions of so many sentiments. The man is truly an actor's actor.At first sight when you begin watching this picture you may think that it's just a typical ""Joan Crawford love-story."" But that couldn't be further from the fact. Yes, it starts out as a love story, and love carries the movie through to the final scene (which always makes me cry), but it's a highly dramatic story of faith, trust and unity.I cannot say enough about Joan's performance in this picture because ""Autumn Leaves"" is truly the cumulative embodiment of all of her professional years of acting. Yet she doesn't play it up or act artificial in the least. Instead, watching Milly Hanson was more like watching an old familiar friend as she suffered through heartache while finding a new life through love and commitment.These are the basic stats of the movie:Autumn Leaves (August 2, 1956) (Studio: Columbia)Distributor: Sony PicturesRuntime Listing: 107 mins.Color/BW: Black and White(Joan played: Millicent ""Milly"" Weatherby Hanson)Brief Synopsis:A lonely typist is seduced into a romance with a man 10 years younger. Once married, their lives come unhinged when the young man begins to have a psychotic breakdown.The supporting cast of everyone involved was totally on par with the rest of the picture (perfect, perfect, perfect). Ms. Ruth Donnelly played Milly's perpetual lady in waiting (Liz) so astutely, it was as if the 2 ladies knew each other in a former life. And, although they were both a couple of bankrupt sickies with the morals of a feral alley cat, both Vera Miles (as Virginia) and Lorne Greene (as Mr. Hanson, Sr.) were so believable that I actually wanted to slap both of their faces.And I loved how Joan totally went off on Burt's father, ""even when he doesn't know what he's doing,"" she says with venom in her words, ""he's a saner man than you are."" And she had a few choice words for Burt's trampy first-wife, ""where's your decency...in what garbage dump?"" But this is the only movie that I know of where Joan actually swore. I was very surprised to hear it too, but the word totally described Virginia (it rhymes with nut and starts with an s-l.)""Autumn Leaves"" is also important because it touches upon a subject that is still to this day stigmatized; mental illness. Of course some of the scenes in the picture may seem somewhat dated, it is still relevant. Burt displayed classic bipolar symptoms, yet there was still something very endearing and almost innocent about him because he was able to make his viewers relate. And just because Burt was severely ill didn't mean that his wife loved him any less; in fact, Milly thought she wasn't good enough for him. Which is something that I will never understand, yet I know that it fits in perfectly with the story and with the part that Joan played. Because everything that Joan's role conveyed was that of a doting and dedicated wife who wanted nothing more than her husband to enjoy love and lucidity.Love is the defining message of this picture. It may bend, but it never breaks. Recently, I gave this movie to a very good friend who was going through a very difficult time and he told me how much it helped because the message was not hokey, it was totally universal. Isn't it a rare movie that can speak to people like that, more than 50 years later, while transcending so many different emotions and feelings?Speaking directly about ""Autumn Leaves,"" Joan said: ""One of my very favorite pictures, and for a lot of good reasons. It was, I think, the best film of its type, the older woman with a younger lover, ever made. The loneliness and the desperation of her situation came through with no need for melodrama or overacting, in fact, I played it down. Cliff Robertson was stunning; very few actors could have brought that kind of credibility to such a demanding part. His mad scenes can't be topped...""""Autumn Leaves"" is considered a classic, yet it still has not found a home on DVD. I am certain I speak for many of Joan's loyal fans when I kindly tell Sony that we do not care about anything besides the film. It doesn't need special features or a documentary or anything. Just put it out on DVD. It is a perfect love story. And, ""Autumn Leaves"" truly proves that Joan was the most versatile actress of her time.I also applaud this movie because it proves that fidelity comes in all different forms and it's a reminder that we should never give up. Maybe you're a ""Milly,"" (or a ""Burt""), but no matter what your situation is, you can find your ""Autumn Leaves,"" if you seek it out and have faith. Both Milly and Burt were thrown away by society, and it wasn't until Burt literally cornered Milly that she found a friendly and a loving face. And I really believe it was because Burt didn't give up on Milly that Milly didn't give up on Burt. For me, ""Autumn Leaves"" will also always be a reminder of compassion and a reminder that love conquers all.Thank you for making this picture, Joan. May you rest in peace knowing that there is an entirely new generation of fans who are celebrating ""Autumn Leaves.""",5,stand by your man,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,6304,"['first', 'saw', 'movie',

Just some quick thoughts on this Joan Crawford classic...Autumn Leaves (1956) stars Joan Crawford, Cliff Robertson, Vera Miles, and Lorne Greene.  Basically the movie is about a man who falls for an older woman and this woman finally falls for this younger man who later turns out to be mentally unstable.  Watch to find out how everything unfolds.The acting is excellent throughout.  A young Cliff Robertson gives a great performance, as does a 50-ish Joan Crawford.  I don't care for Crawford's hairstyle and most of her wardrobes in this movie, but she did look good for her age and it's her acting that counts.  A young Vera Miles also appears in this movie, along with Lorne Greene.This movie is unavailable on DVD just by itself.

The first half of this film is boring and becomes stagnant to the point of wanting to fast-forward. I kept hoping for some over-the-top histrionics which are a Crawford trademark. The only satisfaction I got was from the typewriter scene listening to her odd, gurgling wails, and the encounter with Vera Miles and Lorne Greene outside her bungalow.

350423,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6303011403,Kevin Killian,"[0, 1]","Cliff is a little wooden but the part he's playing would be a challenge to just about any actor.  Aldrich tried luring Marlon Brando into the part and he would have been ideal perhaps, but few actors had the cojones in those days, the mid fifties, of appearing so weak.  Robertson spends much of the movie just lying down and crying like a little baby, as the process of infantilization takes its terrible toll on him.  His sobs are real, it's just the other aspects of Hansen's character that he falls down on.  You keep waiting to figure out why Joan is drawn to him.  Can't shje see there's something wrong there?  That quickie Mexcican marriage, with little Mexican children in sombreros, and donkeys in sombreros, why so sudden?  I'm sure the contemporary audience would have read this plot as a re-tread of the earlier SUDDEN FEAR, where Joan married a maniacal Jack Palance.  Here as it turns out Cliff is no Jack Palance, he's just been turned into a boy by a trauma endured way before the movie begins.[SPOILERS AHEAD.]When Virginia comes to visit Millie in the bungalow row, she's wearing a sweetly sophisticated sleeveless sundress and she looks all together.  You immediately start wondering, ""Who's she""?  And so does Millie.  Then Virginia reveals that she was once married to Burt Hanson, and that their divorce decree hasn't even been good for a month.  For all Burt knows, says Virginia, she's still married to him!  Joan shakes her head, she just can't believe it!  Neither could I.  But it's Vera Miles so she must be telling the truth.  Then Lorne Greene shows up as Burt's dad, saying that, even though he loves his boy, the way a man loves his only son, that Burt can't be trusted and one shouldn't believe a single word Burt tells you.  Also, he's a shoplifter!I guess it could have been worse.  I wonder why the movie didn't play it so that Burt and Virginia in fact were still married?  Wouldn't that have made Burt more perfidious?  Maybe it was against the code for him to then marry Millie in a bigamous relationship?  It's all very dubious, especially when you find out that Vera Miles and Lorne Greene are committing, according to Joan, ""the ugliest of all possible sins, so ugly that it drove him into the state he's in now!""  I'll tell you, my heart flew into my mouth and it is still there!  I always thought, Vera Miles, nice but dull.  Now I discover, she's pure evil.I always thought that VERTIGO would have been a lousy film if Vera Miles, Hitchcock's favorite, hadn't gotten pregnant and had to drop out, leaving it for Kim Novak.  I mean, who could believe that Jimmy Stewart would fall in love with Vera Miles even once, let alone twice!  But AUTUMN LEAVES must have been a good audition tape for Miles and she gives off a slow heat, like a leg of lamb.  Is she still alive?

Joan Crawford plays a single, middle aged woman, named Millicent ""Millie"" Wetherby, who lives a sterile, lonely life. She is self-employed as a typist and works out of her home. The only people she seems to see are her clients and her landlady (Ruth Donnelly). Hers is a solitary existence. One day, she meets a younger man, Burt Hanson (Cliff Robertson), who despite their age difference manages to sweep her off her feet. Despite her concerns about this May/December romance, she falls in love with the irrepressible Burt. After some persuading, she agrees to marry him. Her happiness is palpable.Once the honeymoon is over, however, her nightmare begins, as she discovers that the man she loves seems to be someone other than the man whom she married. Burt had apparently been married before and had unexpectedly come upon his wife (Vera Miles) and his father (Lorne Green) in a compromising position together. This had the effect of putting Burt into some sort of fugue state. The net result was that it caused Burt to become mentally unbalanced. How Millie handles this and what happens to her and Burt make for as engrossing film.This is a wonderful, poignant melodrama that sees Ms. Crawford give a sensational performance as the vulnerable, yet strong, Millie, who confronts the demons in Burt's closet and, ultimately, makes them go away. A very young and boyish Cliff Robertson gives a suitably engaging performance as the hapless Burt. Ruth Donnelly is terrific as Millie's landlady. It was especially nice to see Ms. Donnelly in this film, as she had been in a number of Ms. Crawford's early films. Lorne Green and Vera Miles round off the strong supporting cast. The soundtrack is wonderful, as the title song of the movie is sung by musical great, Nat ""King"" Cole.

She is Millie Weatherby (Joan Crawford), an aging writer whose prospects for romance seem very slim. (Maybe it's those scary eyebrows.) She is a sweet woman, but set in her ways and introverted. Magically, an attractive younger man falls into her lap. Bert Hanson (Cliff Robertson) is an ex-military soldier roaming around town when he finds Millie in a restaurant and begins chatting her up. She spurns his advances at first, but slowly warms up to him. The two begin a passionate love affair. She is afraid because of their age difference, but he convinces her that they are meant for each other. However, the more she learns about Mr. Hanson, the more she questions him. It seems that he isn't being entirely truthful to her.A highly entertaining and sometimes shocking film, this movie surpasses expectations. It is certainly melodramatic, but it nicely transitions from a romance to a psychological thriller. There are some very sexy scenes in this movie; it seems the code wasn't too concerned with the appeal of aging actresses or the things they said. There is a scene on the beach very similar to the famous one from From Here to Eternity, and you might find yourself gasping at some of the lines, especially one scene where Millie blows up at Bert's father and his girlfriend.It's a fun ride, and with Joan Crawford, how could you go wrong?",4,"""Why shouldn't I pick up an expression here and there?

350430,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6303011403,Silver Screen,"[1, 1]","""Autumn Leaves"" is Joan Crawford's 1956 Columbia offering and it's anything but typical Crawford for the period.In this melodrama, Ms. Crawford plays spinster Millicent Wetherby (could this name be any more probable for a spinster?), a typist who works from her modest apartment.  As was the usual case for the time, and as told in a brief flashback, Milly took care of her aging father, rather than finding love, and has now found herself older, alone and desperately wishing for a good man.  Such an opportunity arrives when she meets Burt Hanson (Cliff Robertson) in a diner, after a solo evening out at the symphony.  Despite Milly's initial chilly reception to the at least decade younger Burt, he quickly wins her over and the two have a rushed courtship over the next month.  Burt pops the question (after the two spend agonizing days apart)and before you can say ""something old, something new"", the couple are headed down to Mexico to tie the knot.  The honeymoon ends fairly quickly for Milly though - - first with Burt bringing home excessive and expensive gifts for her, then with the facts of Burt's past changing, and then finally with Virginia Hanson (Vera Miles) showing up at Milly's doorstep and announcing herself as Burt's first wife - - having only been divorced recently, with Burt being unaware that they were divorced at the time he married Milly.  Milly is floored by this relevation, along with the fact that Burt's father (Lorne Greene) is very much alive, despite Burt telling her he had died, and after speaking to Virginia, goes by the department store where Burt has told her that he is a manager, only to find out that he is a tie salesman (and he has stolen all the gifts he has brought home to Milly).  With the weight of his lies catching up with him and his past staying at the local hotel, Burt begins a mental decline.  Milly finds out that six months after Burt and Virginia married, Burt walked in on Virginia and his father in a very compomising situation and has been unwell ever since.  After being physically assaulted by Burt, Milly makes the difficult decision to have Burt committed, knowing full well that once he is recovered he may not need her any longer.  Happily, Burt remains very much in love with his wife, who is waiting for him when he is ready to return home.""Autumn Leaves"" is quite a departure for Ms. Crawford.  She plays a simple, quiet woman, without a hint of histrionics or shrewd behavior.  She is deeply and desperately in love with her husband and, at the same time, fearful that their age difference will tear them apart.  She has a brief scene in the movie, post-wedding, where she is lounging in the marital bed, content as a cat, and it's obvious that she and Burt are physically very happy - - but that mature, experienced and self-satisfied Milly quickly disappears when troubles start mounting.This is also not your standard May-December romance as the woman is older and the man is found crying in the hallway, or calling out to his former wife.  Despite the fact that Burt manhandles Milly, he still remains a sympathetic character who you want to get better and reconcile with Milly by the end.Overall, ""Autumn Leaves"" is one of Ms. Crawford's more underrated and underplayed performances, and one of her better offerings in the latter part of her career, before she began her descent into horror and exploitation pictures.  Be sure not to miss the scene where Ms. Crawford, as Milly, confronts Burt's ex-wife and father about their sinful relationship, hurling out ""[...]"" to Virginia with such venom that you just KNOW there's a spitfire lurking under Milly's skin somewhere!Highly recommended.",4,"No Camp, No Histrionics, Just Crawford",1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,3674,"['Autumn', 'Leaves', 'Joan', 'Crawford', '1956', 'Columbia', 'offering', 'anything', 'typical', 'Crawford', 'period.In', 'melodrama', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'spinster', 'Millicent', 'Wetherby', 'could', 'name', 'be', 'more', 'probable', 'spinster', 'typist', 'who', 'modest', 'apartment', 'was', 'usual', 'case', 'time', 'told', 'brief', 'flashback', 'Milly', 'took', 'care', 'aging', 'father', 'rather', 'finding', 'love', 'now', 'found', 'older', 'alone', 'desperately', 'wishing', 'good', 'man', 'opportunity', 'when', 'Burt', 'Hanson', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'diner', 'solo', 'evening', 'out', 'symphony', 'Milly', 'initial', 'chilly', 'reception', 'least', 'decade', 'younger', 'Burt', 'quickly', 'over', 'two', 'have', 'rushed', 'courtship', 'next', 'month', 'Burt', 'question', 'two', 'spend', 'agonizing', 'days', 'apart', 'can', 'say', 'something', 'old', 'something', 'new', 'couple', 'are', 'headed', 'down', 'Mexico', 'tie', 'knot', 'honeymoon', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'Milly', 'first', 'Burt', 'bringing', 'home', 'excessive', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'then', 'facts', 'Burt', 'past', 'changing', 'then', 'finally', 'Virginia', 'Hanson', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'showing', 'up', 'Milly', 'doorstep', 'announcing', 'Burt', 'first', 'wife', 'having', 'only', 'been', 'divorced', 'recently', 'Burt', 'being', 'unaware', 'were', 'divorced', 'time', 'married', 'Milly', 'Milly', 'floored', 'relevation', 'fact', 'Burt', 'father', 'Lorne', 'Greene', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'Burt', 'telling', 'had', 'died', 'speaking', 'Virginia', 'department', 'store', 'where', 'Burt', 'told', 'manager', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'tie', 'salesman', 'stolen', 'gifts', 'brought', 'home', 'Milly', 'weight', 'lies', 'catching', 'up', 'past', 'staying', 'local', 'hotel', 'Burt', 'mental', 'decline', 'Milly', 'out', 'six', 'months', 'Burt', 'Virginia', 'married', 'Burt', 'walked', 'Virginia', 'father', 'very', 'compomising', 'situation', 'been', 'unwell', 'ever', 'being', 'physically', 'assaulted', 'Burt', 'Milly', 'difficult', 'decision', 'have', 'Burt', 'committed', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'once', 'recovered', 'may', 'not', 'need', 'longer', 'Happily', 'Burt', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'wife', 'who', 'waiting', 'when', 'ready', 'return', 'home', 'Autumn', 'Leaves', 'quite', 'departure', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'simple', 'quiet', 'woman', 'hint', 'histrionics', 'shrewd', 'behavior', 'deeply', 'desperately', 'love', 'husband', 'same', 'time', 'fearful', 'age', 'difference', 'will', 'tear', 'apart', 'brief', 'scene', 'movie', 'post-wedding', 'where', 'lounging', 'marital', 'bed', 'content', 'cat', 'obvious', 'Burt', 'are', 'physically', 'very', 'happy', 'mature', 'experienced', 'self-satisfied', 'Milly', 'quickly', 'when', 'troubles', 'start', 'mounting.This', 'also', 'not', 'standard', 'May-December', 'romance', 'woman', 'older', 'man', 'found', 'crying', 'hallway', 'calling', 'out', 'former', 'wife', 'fact', 'Burt', 'Milly', 'still', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'better', 'reconcile', 'Milly', 'end.Overall', 'Autumn', 'Leaves', 'one', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'more', 'underrated', 'underplayed', 'performances', 'one', 'better', 'offerings', 'latter', 'part', 'career', 'began', 'descent', 'horror', 'exploitation', 'pictures', 'Be', 'sure', 'not', 'miss', 'scene', 'where', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'Milly', 'Burt', 'ex-wife', 'father', 'sinful', 'relationship', 'hurling', 'out', '[', ']', 'Virginia', 'such', 'venom', 'just', 'KNOW', 'spitfire', 'lurking', 'Milly', 'skin', 'somewhere', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Autumn Leaves VHS
350431,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6303011403,Simon Davis,"[15, 15]","&quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; has always been a personal favourite of mine. Being a fan of any stage in Joan Crawford's career I find her in &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; to be both a powerful performer but also able to display a rather touching vulnerability in her performance as Millicent Wetherby a single early middle aged woman who is alone in the world and feels that that is the way it will always be.By this time in her career Joan Crawford's great days as a top flight star at MGM and then Warner Bros. were passed but in early 1955 Joan signed a 3 picture deal with Columbia pictures for a considerable sum of money and proved once again that she was expert at reinventing herself as a more mature performer in roles that further explored areas of her formidable character. The 3 films she starred in were &quot;Queen Bee&quot; 1955, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; 1956, and &quot;The Story of Esther Costello&quot; 1958. All were very different but all reaped good profits and kept Joan in &quot;A&quot; pictures till the end of the decade. &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; directed by Robert Aldrich, who Joan would work with again in 1962 on the memorable &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane&quot; with Bette Davis, is I feel the best of the three and gives Joan an opportunity to work with a sympathetic character at a time when her roles where getting more and more domineering in character.Joan's character of Millicent (Millie) is a typist who is very efficient in her work but finds her personal life is non existent. She lives in a row of apartments which are run by her friend and landlady liz (Ruth Donnelly) who is in the same predicament with no man in her life. Millie by chance meets and falls in love, and marries a much younger man Burt Hanson (Cliff Robertson)only to find her new found love turn to horror when it is revealed he suffers from a mental health condition. She also has to deal with Burt's former wife and his conniving father, Vera Miles and Lorne Greene respectively, who are involved with each other, have caused the grief that Burt has gone through,  and want Burt out of the way.&quot;Autmun Leaves&quot; is a dramatic and stirring story and is an early attempt to put a more realistic light on the tragedy of mental illness and the effects it causes. I feel this issue is handled in a mature and non judgemetal manner in the film and makes for a most engrossing story. Joan Crawford gives the role of Millie her all and she is just right in her early scenes as the lonely single lady just wanting some love in her life. Her later acting in the scenes where Burt's condition and family history becomes apparent to her is superlative. Her interactions with the characters played by Vera Miles and Lorne Greene are extremely powerful and it is interesting to see Lorne Greene in an early role just before he found everlasting stardom on &quot;Bonanza&quot;. It's Joan however who keeps your attention and her development in the story from a victim through to some one who is capable of deciding her own future is excellent. It is by far her best performance in her later years.I strongly recommend &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; to you if you appreciate a good mature story, strong acting and a production with a good heart to it.

350434,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6303011403,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[6, 7]","Being an ardent fan of Joan Crawford I have watched nearly all the films she has starred in either through VHS, DVD, or television airings. I have come to the conclusion the 1950's were by far the decade that showcased Crawford in some of her best work, although many would argue her best films roles were in the 1930's and '40's. I guess I enjoy watching Joan in this phase of her life where she is still ""the star"" as she would often play older women in love with younger men, men who were often at times dangerous and who would place Crawford's characters in situations of peril. Nowhere is this more evident than in 1956's ""Autumn Leaves"". Regarded by Joan as one of her favorites, ""Autumn Leaves"" stars Joan as a woman who falls for a much younger man, played superbly by Cliff Robertson. His character is mentally unbalanced who eventually abuses the Crawford character both mentally and physically. In time Millicent (Joan's character) discovers the key as to why her new-found boyfriend is disturbed. Both Vera Miles and Lorne Green are superb in this and this would be Robert Aldrich's first film in which he directed Crawford, the second being 1962's ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"".Joan has also gone on record as saying she helped coach Robertson when it came time to do his mad scenes as she starred in a similar role in 1947's ""Possessed"" where she played an unbalanced nurse who shoots her lover cold.Unfortunately, ""Autumn Leaves"" has never received a DVD or Blue Ray release here in North America despite having a cult following. It has, however, recieved a DVD release in Spain for Region 2 players. ""Harriet Craig"" (1950) and ""Berserk!"" (1968) have also been released for Region 2. So, Columbia since these movies have been restored to DVD qlarity for foreign countries why not release them to the North American marketplace?UPDATE: ""Autumn Leaves"" is coming to DVD is an exquisite boxset in November, 2012 called ""Joan Crawford in the 1950's"" being released by Sony/TCM. The film will be available for the first time on DVD format along with never-before DVD releases of ""Harriet Craig"" and ""The Story of Esther Costello""!
