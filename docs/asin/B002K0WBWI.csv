This is a fantastic DVD!  It's literally packed with wonderful songs (like the Lady Bug Picnic), ABCs, counting, story time - all the things myself and my parents loved about the show when I was little.  My son's favorite characters are Ernie and Bert, and some of the stand-alone DVDs I've bought for him over the past year barely mention them.  With over 5 hours of Sesame Street on this set, Ernie and Bert get a little more screen time.It's a good value too - the individual DVDs are ten or more dollars for 30-45 minutes, and this HUGE set is only 20.  I'm very happy with my purchase.",5,What a wonderful DVD!,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,710,"['grew', 'up', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'now', 'kids', 'are', '1', '3', ""'m"", 'falling', 'love', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'literally', 'packed', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'Lady', 'Bug', 'Picnic', 'ABCs', 'counting', 'story', 'time', 'things', 'parents', 'loved', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'son', 'favorite', 'characters', 'are', 'Ernie', 'Bert', 'stand-alone', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'past', 'year', 'barely', 'mention', '5', 'hours', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'set', 'Ernie', 'Bert', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'screen', 'time.It', 'good', 'value', 'too', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'are', 'ten', 'more', 'dollars', '30-45', 'minutes', 'HUGE', 'set', 'only', '20', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'purchase']",N/A

1273598,AY3EENC2BGTGK,B002K0WBWI,"M. G. Gagliano ""Maria""","[14, 15]","If there was a person raised on Sesame Street, it was me. I was 3 years old when Sesame Street first aired on TV. I don't recall much before the age of 3 but I do recall Sesame Street.Every day my mother put it on our Montgomery Ward, black and white 13 inch TV and we watched and sang along. After I grew out of Sesame Street I would revisited it while babysitting my cousins. Then again, when I was in my late teens, while getting ready for work, I would occasionally put it on. We didn't have cable and there was nothing on beside the news. So, I would go back to something that was comforting and comfortable. With 13 channels you didn't have much of a choice back then. However, when my son was born and I had all the choices in the world, 180 something channels and all the VHS and DVD tapes a child could ever want, I still put Sesame Street on for him.Why? Well, easy, it was something I respected. Something I knew he would love and something I could deal with. I have always felt that too much TV is not the problem for children. It is what they watch, and Sesame Street for me has good morals, is educational and entertaining.We still watch it everyday at 7:00 a.m.When we received the DVD set in the mail I was so excited to show the kids. We watched it in two days.In A Nutshell: I loved sharing songs I remember with my kids. They were surprised at all the songs I knew. What I also liked and appreciated was how fast Sesame Street moves along. Back in the 60's the colors weren't as vivid the effects not as eye catching but this DVD is fast paced. Basic Sesame Street logic, keep things moving and colorful and kids will watch.The set also comes with a book full of colorful photos and journaling about the inception of Sesame Street and behind the scenes which were really fun to see.",5,40 Years of Memories,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,1801,"['was', 'person', 'raised', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'was', 'was', '3', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'first', 'aired', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'much', 'age', '3', 'do', 'recall', 'Sesame', 'Street.Every', 'day', 'mother', 'put', 'Montgomery', 'Ward', 'black', 'white', '13', 'inch', 'TV', 'watched', 'sang', 'along', 'grew', 'out', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'would', 'revisited', 'babysitting', 'cousins', 'Then', 'again', 'when', 'was', 'late', 'teens', 'getting', 'ready', 'work', 'would', 'occasionally', 'put', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'was', 'nothing', 'news', 'So', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'something', 'was', 'comforting', 'comfortable', '13', 'channels', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'choice', 'back', 'then', 'However', 'when', 'son', 'was', 'born', 'had', 'choices', 'world', '180', 'something', 'channels', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'child', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'still', 'put', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'him.Why', 'Well', 'easy', 'was', 'something', 'respected', 'Something', 'knew', 'would', 'love', 'something', 'could', 'deal', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'TV', 'not', 'problem', 'children', 'what', 'watch', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'good', 'morals', 'educational', 'entertaining.We', 'still', 'watch', '7:00', 'a.m.When', 'received', 'DVD', 'set', 'mail', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'show', 'kids', 'watched', 'two', 'days.In', 'Nutshell', 'loved', 'sharing', 'songs', 'remember', 'kids', 'were', 'surprised', 'songs', 'knew', 'What', 'also', 'liked', 'appreciated', 'was', 'how', 'fast', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'along', 'Back', '60', 'colors', 'were', ""n't"", 'vivid', 'effects', 'not', 'eye', 'catching', 'DVD', 'fast', 'paced', 'Basic', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'logic', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'colorful', 'kids', 'will', 'watch.The', 'set', 'also', 'book', 'full', 'colorful', 'photos', 'journaling', 'inception', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'scenes', 'were', 'really', 'fun', 'see']",N/A

1273600,A2DLOZ9F2493E,B002K0WBWI,Nicolette Clark,"[154, 163]","This DVD set was nostalgic and at times almost brought tears to my eyes.  For those parts (The ladybug picnic, The pinball counting to 12, the cartoon typewriter, the cast iron ""I"", etc) I would give it ten stars.  Sesame Street literally shaped my life as a young child.  I watched it religously until age seven (I'm thirty-five now).  The reason for my three star rating is because of the lengthy songs and dull skits, which unfortunately took most of the time.  Leena Horne singing didn't do it for me at five and she especially doesn't do it for me now at thrity-five.  Sorry, but same to you Diana Ross.  I wanted to see more of the aliens (""yep, yep, yep...nope, nope, nope""), Bert and Ernie, Super Grover, and the Tiddly-winks (who were suspiciously absent).Watching this DVD made me realize how they should now call Sesame Street, just plain Elmo's World.  That's who it's really all about now anyway.  I loved the good old days when ALL the characters received equal billing.  Now it seems like the first forty minutes of Sesame Street is just filler until Elmo, the big star, shows up.  Don't get me wrong, I like Elmo, and so do my three little ones, but all the other characters have their own personalities and ability to teach as well.  This DVD is a reminder of that.So CTW if you're reading this, I would buy every single episode of Sesame Street from 1974-79 if you put it out on DVD.  Stop teasing us with these short DVD releases showing only clips.  To those of you who are thinking of purchasing this DVD set, I would get it, it is worth it.

Or at least, I loved it from when I was a child--from its inception until approximately 1980.

Roosevelt Franklin, writers who met social, racial and class conditions head-on, the music of Joe Raposo--this is what I wanted.How disappointing.  There is a minimum of new material from the Old School DVD collections.  And Joe Raposo's name is not even prominent (is it even mentioned?) in the book that accompanies the DVDs.  I'll have to read it again, but Jon Stone is fronted and Raposo is definitely in the background.Anyway, I'll just have to keep hoping that the marketing gurus at Sesame Wallet Project see fit in the future to release our childhood memories more systematically and completely.
