It was even better then I remembered from when I was a kid. Very mature show for the times it was written and shown. Waiting for the second season to be produced on dvd. Great show for adults and kids. Unlike so many shows that are shown today it actually has some good plots and stories as well as acting. Well heres hopeing.,5,SHAME ITS NOT FORE SALE,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,459,"['shame', 'decided', 'not', 'produce', 'second', 'season', 'bought', 'Life', 'Ledgend', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'first', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'then', 'remembered', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Very', 'mature', 'show', 'times', 'was', 'written', 'shown', 'Waiting', 'second', 'season', 'be', 'produced', 'dvd', 'Great', 'show', 'adults', 'kids', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'are', 'shown', 'today', 'actually', 'good', 'plots', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'Well', 'hopeing']",Wyatt Earp: Season 2 Complete
