Morgan Simpson is so good in this film, he nailed Bailey. I loved everything about this film. I watch it over and over, I was so sad to hear Michael Clark Duncan died. What a horrible shame, he had so much to give us. I hope Morgan makes more films just like this one. He has so much talent and the story line really tugs at your heart. Bailey shows you how much forgivness can change your life. Although this is just a movie, it is so true in your own life. All I can say is Morgan, you are amazing.!",5,Excellent movie!

Jefferson Bailey (Simpson) is a blues player who is in serious financial trouble. When a stranger (Duncan) shows up to let him know his grandfather has died and left him something he dismisses it. When someone come to collect on his debt Bailey catches up with the stranger and decides that a trip is better then the alternative. What starts off as an escape turns into a life changing experience for all involved. This is a very good movie but the music is what really make the movie what it is. If you are a fan of the blues then this movie is made for you. The plot isn't really that original but because of the music it keeps you interested and wanting to see what happens next. About half-way through the movie get very predictable but it is still interesting enough to keep you watching. While not quite at the level of ""Almost Famous"" or ""August Rush"" this is still a music movie that is worth watching. I liked it. Overall, a good movie with great music that deserves to be seen. I give it a B.",3,A very good movie with great music. Not really original but worth watching. I recommend this for the music.
