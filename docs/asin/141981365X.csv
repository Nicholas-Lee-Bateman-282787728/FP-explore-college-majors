174308,A144NRQVLUE8NG,141981365X,caj,"[7, 14]","This review is for the season, not the dvd package. This season seemed to go off track from the great first season. While it is still superior to most of the teen dramas on the air today, a lot of things didn't work for me in season 2.Of all the new characters (and there were quite a few) only Felix really worked - until they ruined his character toward the end. The other new characters were pretty much a yawn fest, including Felix's dull sister. Felix had great chemistry with Brooke and really brought out a lot of intensity to some of the other characters. He had real potential of becoming a very complex character for many years to come.Speaking of Brooke, boy, did they ruin her character. She was a fun, edgy character who, unrealistically, transformed into a dull, responsible cliche. And what happened to the Lucas/Peyton romance. Just because the actors that portray Lucas and Brooke are married doesn't mean that their characters should hook up on the show. Let's explore Lucas and Peyton some more.My two favorite relationships of the series - Nathan/Hayley and Nathan/Lucas were sacrificed this season for very poor stories. The brotherly relationship is the heart and soul of the show, while Hayley was completely written out of character. Who knew that Nathan would turn out to be the mature one in that relationship?As for the adults, where was Whitey for most of the season? Or for that matter, the basketball team and high school??? The new relationships for Keith and Karen didn't work. And Nathan's mother did a complete 180 with her personality. Only the wicked Dan really was really worth watching. He's the new JR Ewing.On positive notes, the actress that plays Peyton did some incredible work this season. Also, it did look as if the show was heading back to the right direction with the last few episodes of this season. Nathan's 'what if' dream was classic.Regardless, I will still buy this season because I love this show. Here's hoping that season 3 gets back on track.",3,Did this season go off track from season 1?,1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,2001,"['review', 'season', 'not', 'dvd', 'package', 'season', 'seemed', 'go', 'off', 'track', 'great', 'first', 'season', 'still', 'superior', 'most', 'teen', 'dramas', 'air', 'today', 'lot', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'season', '2.Of', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'only', 'Felix', 'really', 'worked', 'ruined', 'character', 'end', 'other', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'yawn', 'fest', 'including', 'Felix', 'dull', 'sister', 'Felix', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Brooke', 'really', 'brought', 'out', 'lot', 'intensity', 'other', 'characters', 'had', 'real', 'potential', 'becoming', 'very', 'complex', 'character', 'many', 'years', 'come.Speaking', 'Brooke', 'boy', 'did', 'ruin', 'character', 'was', 'fun', 'edgy', 'character', 'who', 'unrealistically', 'transformed', 'dull', 'responsible', 'cliche', 'what', 'happened', 'Lucas/Peyton', 'romance', 'Just', 'actors', 'portray', 'Lucas', 'Brooke', 'are', 'married', ""n't"", 'mean', 'characters', 'should', 'hook', 'up', 'show', 'Let', 'explore', 'Lucas', 'Peyton', 'more.My', 'two', 'favorite', 'relationships', 'series', 'Nathan/Hayley', 'Nathan/Lucas', 'were', 'sacrificed', 'season', 'very', 'poor', 'stories', 'brotherly', 'relationship', 'heart', 'soul', 'show', 'Hayley', 'was', 'completely', 'written', 'character', 'Who', 'knew', 'Nathan', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'mature', 'one', 'relationship', 'adults', 'where', 'was', 'Whitey', 'most', 'season', 'matter', 'basketball', 'team', 'high', 'school', 'new', 'relationships', 'Keith', 'Karen', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Nathan', 'mother', 'did', 'complete', '180', 'personality', 'Only', 'wicked', 'Dan', 'really', 'was', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'new', 'JR', 'Ewing.On', 'positive', 'notes', 'actress', 'Peyton', 'did', 'incredible', 'work', 'season', 'Also', 'did', 'look', 'show', 'was', 'heading', 'back', 'right', 'direction', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'Nathan', ""'what"", 'dream', 'was', 'classic.Regardless', 'will', 'still', 'buy', 'season', 'love', 'show', 'Here', 'hoping', 'season', '3', 'back', 'track']",N/A

Dan who was recovering from his heart attack planed the ultimate revenge on his brother Keith who slept with his wife Deb. Peyton dealt with a number of blows and even turned to drugs, only to be reunited with Jake and to find love with him, even if just for a little while. Two newcomers Felix and Anna joined the fold and shook things up in Tree Hill with Brooke and Lucas respectively. Lucas made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the ones he loves. Karen found love with her professor. Nathan had to deal with the crushing blow that his new wife Haley chose to put her music career ahead of their marriage. Deb struggled with her drug addiction and her desire to leave Dan.Just a brief and general overview of this season. You have to watch it to really enjoy the plots. They moved even quicker this season, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I couldn't stop watching, until I was done.

The later half of the season had some great stand alone episodes, that alone made it worth the buy & the swapping of roles between Nathen and Lucas in the switch episode worked amazingly well.I also hope Hayley and Nathen make it as they are such a great couple and I wish the third season was out.
