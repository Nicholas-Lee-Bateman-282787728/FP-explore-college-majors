1190678,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B001FB55L2,Amit Talpade,"[0, 0]","Brothers' is about two brothers and an American version of a Danish film `Brodre'. They are played Jake Gyllenhaal and Tobey Maguire, they are also not alike. Jake is an ex con and Tobey is Marine Corp who is a family man married to Natalie Portman and getting ready to go to Afghanistan. He is deployed and in a few days the news arrives that he has died. But he does not instead he is captured by the Taliban and as a prisoner of war undergoes some gruesome torture. His sorrowful wife is unable to believe that he has left them but somehow during the course of the absence becomes very close to his brother Jake Gyllenhaal (Tommy), but they maintain a platonic relationship. The children become close to their uncle and the family starts mending their frayed relationship with Gyllenhaal. Until, one day Sam (Tobey Maguire) returns but he is a changed man both physically and mentally and the strains start to show. In my opinion, the story while sufficiently powerful was not enough to make this movie watchable but the chemistry between the lead actors and the direction. All three leads put in a brave, balanced and a polished performance that is beyond their years. I loved Tobey Maguire and how he managed to convey the mental anguish of a traumatized soldier. The child stars are great in their roles and the rest of the cast supports well. The movie is a reminder of the service that our servicemen are providing out country and the heartbreak, trials and tribulations that they and their families go through every day. This movie while not overtly political does question the futility of war. Finally the song Winter by U2 has been used to great haunting effect.

This is certainly the case in ""Brothers"" where a veteran from Afghanistan returns home to small town America as damaged goods.The brothers around which the film is based are Sam and Tommy Cahill.  The former is a decorated soldier and the pride of his overbearing father.  Tommy, on the other hand, has just been paroled from gaol for robbery.  For him, his father has little more than contempt.Sam is shot down in a helicopter while on duty in Afghanistan.  He is reported dead.  His wife is shattered.  However, it is here that Tommy steps up by offering his sister-in-law a helping hand.  He is slowly welcomed and his two young nieces come to adore him.  It is at this point hat Sam is found not to be dead.  He had been held captive by militants and dreadfully mistreated.  Effectively, he is a broken man.  His return home is a great challenge.  He simply can't fit in.  He believes his wife and brother to have been having an affair.

I'm not surprised at all to see that Tobey Maguire was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as Capt. Sam Cahill, he earned it. Clifton Collins Jr. (Dirty&The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day) also plays a small role in the movie.

1190682,A30TQET02FLSUX,B001FB55L2,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 1]","Brothers (2009) is one of those incredible indie films with incredible talent that was incredibly UNDER-rated when it came out in theaters. Even though it was a remake of a Danish film of the same name from 2004, it felt very fresh and American to me. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Having watched the behind-the-scenes extras on the DVD, which include scenes from the Danish film, it seems to me that this story was even better told from an American point of view. I don't want to give away the story since this is a movie all about story and characters, but basically it's about 2 brothers and their family, set against an Iraq/Afghanistan war story. Tobey Maguire's character Sam Cahill gets captured while stationed in Afghanistan and is assumed to be dead. His wife Grace, played by Natalie Portman, grieves and works to move on with her life after this news and the funeral. Sam's trouble-making brother Tommy, played with understated brilliance by Jake Gyllenhaal, becomes the replacement father and husband for Grace gradually. Of course a relationship develops between Tommy and Grace and that causes trouble when it turns out Sam is not dead and returns home from Afghanistan.I think what is so brilliant about this movie is the complexity of the characters, but also the simplicity of the them at the same time. The acting by the three main young actors is great and was sorely overlooked by the Oscars. The Trailer does not do the movie justice, although there are some great scenes from the movie in the trailer.  This is one of those movies, like Crazy Heart (2009), that has to be watched to be fully appreciated.

AMAZING acting!I don't really watch many movies without having any critical judgment regarding the acting, story, or direction.... something! It's rare for me to have totally rave reviews. That being said...I've always liked the people in this film, especially Natalie Portman, but they really blew my mind in this movie. Wonderful direction, writing and story. It was touching and even the children wowed me with their acting. The whole thing was overwhelming. I watched it twice in the 24 hours, the second time with my mom because I knew she'd like it.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: (I can't remember the trailer now, because it's been a few months. I don't think I'm going to give away any spoilers, but please take note before reading on, just in case. Thanks)They advertise it as a thriller about jealousy, but it's actually a brutally honest and sad story about veterans and their families. I have no experience with having lost family to war, but this was really about that. Natalie Portman was especially amazing because she didn't overdo the grieving. It would have been so easy for an actress to ham up this role, but she was so subtle, it was very effective and realistic. The relationship between the family members was complex and deep; there was nothing about this movie that I would have thought needed changing.I want to stress that I had watched this movie thinking that it was about a crazy guy who was jealous after being presumed dead, as they show in the trailers. But it is really about the war, family, and pulling through the most tragic of circumstances.

I have not seen the Danish film and now I wish I had.  This is because I just read here that in the Danish movie, the wife does start an affair with her brother-in-law.  This film lost a lot of its punch when the director shied away from letting that happen in the American remake.  As a result, it's as if someone punctured the air out of the movie past the halfway point. This should be a very taut, sharp drama throughout , which I suspect he Danish one is. The American one simply cannot sustain the same tension when the guts were removed from the script.  The actors are very good, both the brothers and the wife.  I think they make the best of what they've got.  So the problem must be that director Jim Sheridan was worried about losing audience if he kept the film as stark as the Danish version (that a film is Scandinavian and stark borders on redundancy).

Both timely and thought-provoking, it deftly illustrates the hardships for soldiers returning home from battle and trying to readjust to civilian life.This movie is packed with stellar performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman.  I was especially surprised and impressed by Tobey Maguire.  This was a different role for him.  He plays a Marine who is sent to Afghanistan to join the war efforts.  His plane gets shot down, and his family is told the tragic news.His brother (Gyllenthal) tries to somewhat step into his shoes and give support to his widowed family.  He left behind two daughters that are still in need of a father figure, and a wife (Portman) that might possibly have needs of her own.  They carry on in his absence, and are shocked and overjoyed at his return.  Although he is definitely a changed man.War is utter hell.  It places an immense burden on all those involved.  What seperates this movie from other ""dead hero returns home"" stories is it presents an alarming and intense quandary in the battlefield that also seems very authentic.  The sort of life-altering predicament that has no easy answers or no heroic solution.  Soldiers might be placed with some unfathomably tough choices.  It is easy to contemplate how you would react, but really you have no idea until you are put in that situation.Don't be expecting lots of explosions or battle scenes here.  Brothers is a slow-paced drama that examines themes of family, trust, and insecurities, all of which are effected by the tribulations of battle.

Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Sam (Tobey Maguire) are brothers and their father is an ex-marine that served in Vietnam. Sam is a marine that is deployed to Afghanistan while Tommy is generally a drunken scoundrel that is considered a failure by their father. Grace (Natalie Portman) is Sam's wife and she also has a low opinion of Tommy. Sam also has two very young daughters that he is devoted to.When Sam is lost and presumed dead in Afghanistan, Tommy steps up and acts as a father to Sam's girls and does other things for Grace, showing that he cares about their problems. After some time Sam is rescued from the Taliban base and comes back a very changed man. Even though nothing sexual happened between Tommy and Grace, Sam believes that they had sex and he is also haunted by the demons of the war and his captivity.The performances here are outstanding, especially that of Maguire, his rendition of the tortured soul with the face and eye movements and even the spit flying as he rages mesmerizes you as you wait for a terrible disaster to happen.My wife served as a counselor intern for the VA while she was in her master's program in counseling and she often talked about how much anger some of the veterans had, even decades after physically leaving the war. From what little I know from her experiences and the people that I have known before and after their war experiences, what this movie depicts is no exaggeration.

""Charlie""","[3, 4]","This movie was very intersting, however, I was extremely disgusted with the way Hollywood originally marketed it--as a thriller--in the previews leading up to its release.  I couldn't wait to see this movie when it first came out off that alone.  It was almost billed as a Fatal Attraction-esque movie from the previews alone: Widow becomes romantically entangled with her dead husband's brother only to find out that he isn't dead at all and they try to conceal their relationship until he discovers the truth and loses it.  On the flip, the movie was basically about a husband who is presumed dead after being a POW in Iraq, his fight for survival during that harrowing time, and his failed attempts to adjust once he finally comes home.  Only secondary to this is his brother (Jake Gyllenhaal) stepping in to be a father figure of sorts and the romantic sparks between he and his sister-in-law (Natalie Portman).  I came into the movie expecting to see one thing, but got something entirely different.What I got wasn't bad at all though only because of the caliber of acting.  Tobey Maguire in particular was so haunting that I was downright on the edge of my seat waiting to see that moment where he finally cracked and exploded.  Though the scene wasn't what you would expect if you let the previews fool you, it was very intense and built up nicely.  Another performance that left me in awe was the young lady who portrayed the eldest daughter.  The fire in her during that kitchen scene when she blurted out her view on the situation between her mother and uncle was magnificent; she had daggers in her eyes and was fuming, it was just beyond believeable to watch in my opinion.  Jake Gyllenhaal had his moments too, but he was his purest when he saved his character's brother from doing the unthinkable in the end.  I felt Natalie Portman's character didn't have much depth, and she was clearly overshadowed by Maguire and Gyllenhaal's performances.I would give it 4 stars, but again, I was disappointed at the slant the studio took just to get people into the theater.  Clearly the Academy took note of that as well, which is why its nominations didn't make it beyond the Golden Globes, which is sad because honestly this movie had a fighting chance had it just been presented as is.",3,"Great Movie, Horrible Marketing Campaign",1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,2292,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'intersting', 'however', 'was', 'extremely', 'disgusted', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'originally', 'marketed', 'thriller', 'previews', 'leading', 'up', 'release', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'alone', 'was', 'almost', 'billed', 'Fatal', 'Attraction-esque', 'movie', 'previews', 'alone', 'Widow', 'romantically', 'entangled', 'dead', 'husband', 'brother', 'only', 'find', 'out', ""n't"", 'dead', 'try', 'conceal', 'relationship', 'truth', 'flip', 'movie', 'was', 'basically', 'husband', 'who', 'presumed', 'dead', 'being', 'POW', 'Iraq', 'fight', 'survival', 'harrowing', 'time', 'failed', 'attempts', 'adjust', 'once', 'finally', 'home', 'Only', 'secondary', 'brother', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'stepping', 'be', 'father', 'figure', 'sorts', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'sister-in-law', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'came', 'movie', 'expecting', 'see', 'one', 'thing', 'got', 'something', 'entirely', 'got', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'only', 'caliber', 'acting', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'particular', 'was', 'so', 'haunting', 'was', 'downright', 'edge', 'seat', 'waiting', 'see', 'moment', 'where', 'finally', 'cracked', 'exploded', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'let', 'previews', 'fool', 'was', 'very', 'intense', 'built', 'up', 'nicely', 'performance', 'left', 'awe', 'was', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'portrayed', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'fire', 'scene', 'when', 'blurted', 'out', 'view', 'situation', 'mother', 'uncle', 'was', 'magnificent', 'had', 'daggers', 'eyes', 'was', 'fuming', 'was', 'just', 'believeable', 'watch', 'opinion', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'had', 'moments', 'too', 'was', 'purest', 'when', 'saved', 'character', 'brother', 'doing', 'unthinkable', 'end', 'felt', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'depth', 'was', 'clearly', 'overshadowed', 'Maguire', 'Gyllenhaal', 'performances.I', 'would', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'again', 'was', 'disappointed', 'slant', 'studio', 'took', 'just', 'get', 'people', 'theater', 'Clearly', 'Academy', 'took', 'note', 'as', 'well', 'why', 'nominations', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'sad', 'because', 'honestly', 'movie', 'had', 'fighting', 'chance', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'presented']",N/A

1190695,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B001FB55L2,Craig Whittle,"[21, 25]","BROTHERSSTARRING: Tobey Maguire, Natalie Portman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Shepard, Bailee Madison, Taylor Geare, Patrick Flueger, Clifton Collins Jr., Ethan Suplee and Mare WinninghamWRITTEN BY: David Benioff; based on the screenplay Bodre by Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas JensenDIRECTED BY: Jim SheridanRated: RGenre: DramaRelease Date: 04 December 2009I have always wondered if maybe Tobey Maguire had a dark side to him, buried away, deep behind that charming Peter Parker smile. Now that I have seen his disturbing performance in Brothers; I know that he does.He plays Capt. Sam Hill of the U.S. Marine Corps and he does it miraculously. At first everything seems to be ok with Sam. He has a wonderful wife and two beautiful kids; a strong relationship with his father and he loves and defends his brother. However, all of that is about to change.We learn early on in the film that he is to be shipped off to Afghanistan. He is proud to be a Marine and is equally proud to go.Just days before he leaves, his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is released from prison. We don't know why, but Sam's wife Grace (Natalie Portman) isn't very fond of him.Their father Hank (Sam Shepard) agrees with Grace entirely. In his eyes, the two brothers are worlds apart. Sam is the saint and Tommy is the family screw-up. Having been a Marine himself, Hank respects Sam and constantly puts Tommy down for not being more like his brother. There are some very well acted scenes between the three of these Hollywood greats; particularly the first dinner scene when Tommy is released from prison.It's not a hard sell at all to buy Gyllenhaal and Maguire as brothers. Several people over the years have commented on their similar looks; they have been mistaken for one-another; and at one point Gyllenhaal was rumored to be relieving Maguire in the Spider-Man franchise. Their on-screen chemistry is more than believable, so fans will enjoy their scenes together, as did I.The plot thickens when Sam's chopper goes down and he and his crew are believed to be dead. We know from the trailers, the opening credits saying Tobey Maguire's name first and just common movie-goer knowledge, that he is not dead. If you haven't seen the trailers, relax; it's revealed to us right away that he is alive.Himself and another soldier have in fact been captured by the Taliban and are brought to a secret hideout in the Afghan Mountains. Having done a tour of duty there myself, I can tell you that wherever they filmed this sequence is very close to the real deal.Sam is an officer and his counterpart is an enlisted Private. He constantly reminds him of their differences in rank throughout all of their scenes together.I found this annoying as I don't think that nine out of 10 soldiers would be that over-zealous about their rank in a situation like this, but there is always that one guy. And it does serve a purpose as Sam is very good at reading people and can see that this particular soldier is weak and will most likely not be able to handle whatever sadistic torture their captors have in store for them.I found the scenes in Afghanistan to be the most entertaining portion of the film and there are several of them. Tobey Maguire does an amazing job in these scenes and will show you dimensions of himself that you have never seen before. He is driven to do things that a lot of people may say they would never do in that situation; but I don't think any of us ever really know what we are or aren't capable of until we are put into a certain situation. This film will really make you ask yourself what you would do if you were in Sam's shoes.I'm displeased to report that the rest of the film was a letdown. The only positive thing I really took from the rest of it, were the amazing performances of all the actors. There wasn't a single person in this film that didn't bring every bit of what they had to offer to each and every scene. Even small characters were casted well and delivered excellent performances. I don't know how they got Clifton Collins Jr. to do the two or three tiny scenes that he was in; but they did and he brought an impressive performance with him.Natalie Portman is as amazing as ever. She plays Grace so effortlessly and has great chemistry with the actors playing her family. In the scene where she receives the news of her husband's death, she goes from smiling to an absolute wreck without so much as a second going by.I feel Jake Gyllenhaal was cheated out of some screen time in the film. You never really got to know his character as well as you should have. Regardless of this, he still does a knock-out job with it anyway.The same goes for Sam Shepard. I felt like this character should have had either a bigger part in the story or a smaller one. With an actor like Sam Shepard, the answer better be bigger. We get absolutely no closure from his character's issues in the film.Scenes seem poorly edited and at times, too glamorized for this film. I feel like a lot of them were too bright and didn't fit well with the dark tones of the film as a whole.The most disappointing piece of the film was the romance between Tommy and Grace. I kept waiting for there to be this moment where they fall in love for each other and have a secret affair; but it never happens. They have one intimate moment where they share a kiss and both of them seem to regret it instantly and it is never brought up again; because right after it they discover Sam is still alive.I was expecting this huge love triangle to unfold. I think that based on the trailer and the poster alone, most would agree with me in thinking this is what was going to happen. There was opportunity after opportunity for there to be moments between them. Then when the romance never comes you are left wondering `what was the point of those scenes then?' Take the scene where she leaves in the middle of the night to go and pick Tommy up from the bar; or the idea of him offering to rebuild her kitchen for her. These are classic set-up scenes for a romance to ensue, and there is nothing!I get the feeling that the filmmakers' intentions were not to have the over-done love triangle, and instead let it all be in Sam's head. For some, this may be a pleasant aspect of the film. I can even appreciate the originality in that; it's just that I kept expecting these other things to happen and when they didn't, I was disappointed.I thought there would be hot and forbidden sex scenes; followed by the heart-throbbing suspense of them trying to cover it up, as they realize they are still in love even after Sam is back in the picture.What we get instead is Sam returning and being wacked out of his frigging mind from the trauma he experienced over there. He is deathly thin and this adds a great deal to him being creepy. His children are afraid of him and his wife looks at him as if he is another man altogether.Rather than the suspense, we just get what I would call annoying drama. Sam flat out confronts Tommy about sleeping with his wife, and Tommy never once denies having done so. Well no wonder the poor guy continues to think that something is going on!As if that wasn't bad enough, one of Sam's daughters is so distraught that her daddy isn't the same anymore, she screams at him and tells him that her mother and Tommy have sex all the time. She yells this in front of everyone at the dinner table, and neither Grace nor Tommy says anything to comfort Sam by assuring him, this is untrue. Had it happened, this would have been a little bit more tolerable; but it didn't! Nothing happened! So why wouldn't either of them say something to deny it?As far as I'm concerned, there was no justification for the daughter to act that way in the first place. There wasn't enough suspense of her daddy being frightening and different that would have caused her to do this. It seemed like two or three scenes between the two of them had been deleted and made it play-out wrong.It's not a bad movie; just not what I had anticipated and looked forward to it being, nor is it what it could have easily been. I'm sure a lot of people will still enjoy it. In the meantime, to hold me over until another film delivers hot steamy romance mixed with suspense and a classic love triangle; I suppose I can watch Pearl Harbor again.",3,Brothers

I don't know what insight the movie can give you at all and the acting (other than Maguire's) seemed very hollow.  When Maguire was acting up in the kitchen, Portman's character was just too unrealistic to me.  I understand shock but her complete lack of emotion seemed fake.  The line ""we are brothers"" somehow meant what at the scene in front of the house.It seemed pretty clear to me too that there wasn't a military advisor on this movie, or if there was, he was asleep.  There were so many breaches of etiquette in the movie that it was truly distracting.  Salutes were rare in this movie yet something simple like that was botched.  Those that are not veterans may not understand how something as simple as that can take you out of the movie.  Salutes and other forms of etiquette and protocol are gestures of respect.  Not doing them is dishonorable and disrespectful.  If you are going to go through the trouble of making sure the uniform looks authentic, then you can make sure behavior is also authentic.I understand that many war veterans don't want or have huge difficulties in talking about what happened.  However, when it is clear that something is wrong, it would help if the audience would be given some tools on what to do.  Instead the movie just drags along with no one stepping up to the plate to do anything about it.  Even at the end - the revelation could have been taken in many ways.

I didn't want to see some movie about a wife cheating with her brother-in-law, particularly with a war hero as the foil for her actions. I didn't want to see a silly thriller with serious themes as the backdrop.Thankfully, ""Brothers"" is closer to an indie film than a suspense story. It takes a hard look at family life and the effects of war on a marriage, children, and those who stand on the front lines. When Sam (Tobey Maguire) heads off for another tour in Afghanistan, he leaves behind a beautiful wife (Natalie Portman) and two young daughters, as well as his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) who's been recently released from prison. The relationships are established clearly, and the acting is superb all around. The story takes a turn when Sam seems to have died in combat. He has, in fact, survived as a prisoner of the Taliban, but his family back home mourns his loss, and slowly begins to put back together the pieces. There are some poignant moments, and the parallels between Sam's war experiences and his father's--in Vietnam--create an interesting dynamic.The story's tension picks up when Sam is faced with some horrible ethical decisions to survive. It's hard to judge or understand, and for some, his decision will seem unbelievable. For the sake of his family, he makes a hard choice, and I was willing to go with it. When he returns home, though, he is still suffering the psychological trauma of the war, and he begins to suspect his brother and wife of sleeping together. This leads to some suspenseful moments, but the deeper issue is his mental struggle to hang on after his decisions. I was afraid the last half-hour would turn into a mindless chase through suburbia, but instead the story concludes with some bittersweet moments that leave us pondering the horrors our brave soldiers experience.This is neither a suspense thriller (as advertised), nor some steamy story about a love triangle (as also advertised...using a child to spread the lie, of all things!). It is a serious look at the need to care for our soldiers, for their families, and not allow this cycle to continue into the next generations.

I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was quite a good movie, but I found it less than satisfying, which I'll mention below. The ""Brothers"" was originally a Danish movie and was made over to better fit the situation of the United States. The movie concerned two brothers who were about the same age but were very different in personality and temperament. One was very successful (Maguire), a star football player who enlisted in the Marine Corps, and re-enlisted to fight the war in Afghanistan. The other (Gyllenhall) was a nehr-do-well, always in trouble, couldn't seem to stay with anything and even had to serve a short prison term. Now, guess which one their Korean War Marine Hero father preferred? I think you got it correct, and if you didn't, it would become crystal clear as the movie progressed.Maguire had a wife and two daughters who were delighted to see him again upon his return from Afghanistan, but he  didn't stay around long until his next re-enlistment. Then a series of events happened in short order. Maguire's helicopter was  shot down and he was presumed dead. The death notice went back to his family and the grief sank deeply in. Everyone began to adjust each in his or her own way. But wait! It turned out that Maguire and a second U. S. soldier survived the crash and were held captive by the enemy under dreary conditions. Maguire was ordered by the enemy commander to kill his loyal companion and friend. If he didn't, the commander would blow Maguire's brains out and he had already shown that he knew how to do it. Maguire took the easy and cowardly way out, he beat his companion to death with a piece of pipe. Shortly after this grisly little episode, a marine copter arrived, scattered the enemy and rescued Maguire. Well, you now had a bit of a psychological dilemma on your hands. Maguire returned home and, let's just say, he was less than well adjusted with being back. All sorts of problems surfaced, including a perceived problem between the two brothers and Maguire's wife. Everything went bad. It was a very interesting situation and one that might have taken place in many situations in America during this extended time of war.

1190709,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001FB55L2,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","It takes extraordinary courage to place a film like BROTHERS before the public, and it is to the credit of director Jim Sheridan that this superb study of the effects of war on everyone around the globe is so fine.  Based on Suzanne Bier's Danish film 'Brdre' concerning the same timeframe in the Afghanistan war, this screenplay was successfully adapted by David Benioff from Anders Thomas Jensen's Danish screenplay. It is delivered in somewhat choppy format, throwing the audience one minute in the US and the next in Afghanistan, and while it does take getting used to, this choice of storytelling ultimately works splendidly, heightening the tension in a very steady unrelenting way.The Cahill family consists of alcoholic, Vietnam Vet father Hank (Sam Shepard), stepmother Elsie (Mare Winningham) and two brothers - 'perfect' athlete and successful USCM Captain Sam (Tobey Maguire) and the recently released from prison 'worthless' Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Sam is departing for Afghanistan, leaving his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and two daughters Isabelle and Maggie (child actress par excellence Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare).  Sam entrusts a farewell letter to his best friend Major Cavazos (Clifton Collins Jr.) in case he doesn't return.  Sam is off to war and is very soon shot down and taken prisoner by the Afghanis: the report sent home is that Sam has been killed in action. Sam and Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger) are starved, beaten, and abused as prisoners until at one hideous moment Sam is instructed to kill the doomed Joe - an act he carries out and absorbs all the subsequent anguish and guilt that results from his act of survival.At home Grace and Tommy become close: the girls love Tommy, Tommy works on Grace's house, and when the report of Sam's death reaches them they are bonded even more tightly - despite Hank's hateful attitude toward the 'failure' Tommy. But when word reaches them that Sam is alive and when Sam returns home, the trials begin.  Sam is wasted physically and emotionally, forever devastated by his war experience and his guilt.  The story form here on must be seen to understand just how bitterly cruel the aftermath of war can be.This is truly an ensemble movie with every character perfectly cast and giving memorable performances.  Few will be able to erase the images that Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman create - and hopefully those bleak images will force some reality testing on the ongoing question of the 'worth' of war.

1190713,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B001FB55L2,Haunted Flower,"[3, 4]","""Brothers"" was directed by Jim Sheridan, director of ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" in 2005 and is based on the motion picture ""Brdre"" from Denmark. The story is about two brothers, Tommy and Sam played by Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal. Sam is the good son, a marine deployed to Afghanistan and Tommy has always been a bit of a screw-up and just got out of jail. While Sam is gone, Tommy attempts to take care of Sam's wife, Grace played by Natalie Portman and their daughters.At this point, the film takes a ""Pearl Harbor"" turn and Sam is announced dead to his family back home from a crash, but the audience knows he's actually been taken as a P.O.W. The grief and Tommy's great playfulness with the children brings Tommy and Grace closer together to try to build back the broken family. Until one day when Sam returns home....If you haven't seen this movie, do not watch the trailer first, go in blind. The trailer really emphasizes the few moments of heightened tension in the film and makes it sound like this really intense nonstop drama. In truth, most of this movie is spent with long quiet sad looks and adorable children playing. The overall film was a result felt underwhelming from what I was expecting. I would not call this film boring though. What kept me interested were the individual performances.Tobey Maguire has really picked a good role here with Captain Sam Cahill. In the beginning of the movie, he's a loving father and husband and when he smiles he looks just like Peter Parker with a military crew cut. After being put through the physical and emotional torture of imprisonment, he comes back a damaged man projecting his turmoil on everyone around him. His post-traumatic stress is always simmering under the surface and really comes to a boil near the end in a powerful scene where he screams at his wife about how much he loves her while waving a gun around.The big question throughout the film in regards to Grace and Tommy is did they or didn't they? Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal bring poignant performances to this otherwise very depressing film. Serious Kudos to young Bailee Madison for her portrayl of daughter, Isabelle. She shows maturity beyond her years with control of a very difficult role. It is definitely worth a watch for slow building drama and more commentary on the after-effects of war, but while they are explosive moments, it is not nearly as intense as the trailer might have you believe.",4,Brothers,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,2446,"['Brothers', 'was', 'directed', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'director', 'Get', 'Rich', 'Die', 'Tryin', '2005', 'based', 'motion', 'picture', 'Brdre', 'Denmark', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'Tommy', 'Sam', 'played', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Sam', 'good', 'son', 'marine', 'deployed', 'Afghanistan', 'Tommy', 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'screw-up', 'just', 'got', 'jail', 'Sam', 'gone', 'Tommy', 'take', 'care', 'Sam', 'wife', 'Grace', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'daughters.At', 'point', 'film', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'turn', 'Sam', 'announced', 'dead', 'family', 'back', 'home', 'crash', 'audience', 'actually', 'been', 'taken', 'P.O.W', 'grief', 'Tommy', 'great', 'playfulness', 'children', 'Tommy', 'Grace', 'closer', 'together', 'try', 'build', 'back', 'broken', 'family', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'Sam', 'home', '.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'trailer', 'first', 'go', 'blind', 'trailer', 'really', 'few', 'moments', 'heightened', 'tension', 'film', 'sound', 'really', 'intense', 'nonstop', 'drama', 'truth', 'most', 'movie', 'spent', 'long', 'quiet', 'sad', 'looks', 'adorable', 'children', 'playing', 'overall', 'film', 'was', 'result', 'felt', 'underwhelming', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'film', 'boring', 'What', 'kept', 'interested', 'were', 'individual', 'performances.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'really', 'picked', 'good', 'role', 'here', 'Captain', 'Sam', 'Cahill', 'beginning', 'movie', 'loving', 'father', 'husband', 'when', 'just', 'like', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'military', 'crew', 'cut', 'being', 'put', 'physical', 'emotional', 'torture', 'imprisonment', 'back', 'damaged', 'man', 'projecting', 'turmoil', 'everyone', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'always', 'simmering', 'surface', 'really', 'boil', 'end', 'powerful', 'scene', 'where', 'wife', 'how', 'much', 'waving', 'gun', 'around.The', 'big', 'question', 'film', 'regards', 'Grace', 'Tommy', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'bring', 'poignant', 'performances', 'otherwise', 'very', 'depressing', 'film', 'Serious', 'Kudos', 'young', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'portrayl', 'daughter', 'Isabelle', 'maturity', 'years', 'control', 'very', 'difficult', 'role', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'slow', 'building', 'drama', 'more', 'commentary', 'after-effects', 'war', 'are', 'explosive', 'moments', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'intense', 'trailer', 'might', 'have', 'believe']",N/A

In 2007, Captain Sam Cahill is preparing to leave for his fourth tour of duty with the marines in Afghanistan. His brother has just been released from jail for committing rape. The two brothers are very close, but their father, an ex-marine sergeant, a veteran of Vietnam, considers Sam a hero and his bother Tommy a failure.While in Afghanistan, Sam's plane is shot down, the military assumes that he is killed, and informs his wife and two daughters that he is dead. However, he is not killed. He and a private are captured by Taliban soldiers and tossed and held for months into a dismal hole. Sam does all he can to persuade the private not to give in to the Taliban. He is firm for months. But the two are tortured repeatedly and horribly and Sam is forced by the Taliban to kill the private.Back at home, his brother Tommy, well-meaning, changes his wasteful personality and does all he can to help Sam's wife. He remodels her kitchen and other parts of her house. He helps her, encourages her, and makes her and her daughters laugh. He goes to the woman he assaulted and begs her pardon. Sam's wife is impressed. After smoking dope together and having a drink, she kisses him. One kiss.After months, Sam is rescued. He can hardly talk when the marines take him from his hole. When he comes home, it is clear that he is traumatized. He asks his brother about his wife: ""Did you f**k her? Tell me. I understand. I forgive you."" He also blows up at his wife saying that she has been sleeping with Tommy. He yells at his kids. He tells his colonel that his family does not understand him.What will happen between Sam's wife and his brother? Can Sam be helped? Can he improve his relationship with his wife, Tommy, his two daughters, and his father? What will be the relationship between him and the wife of the private that he killed? Was he a hero?

Save that garbage for Lifetime and A-Lister female celebrities who either want a time piece under their belt, or think they have the chops to translate a classic piece of chick-lit onto the big screen with more than a modicum of success.  Looking at you, Kate Winslet.  Instead, this movie instantly gains a star when it avoids the cheap and the obvious, delving into the rampant Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) cases resulting from wars in the Middle East rather than an actual love triangle.  Allowing the superb cast to channel emotions ranging from joy to despair, elation to psychosis, was a much wiser choice.Just as Jarhead Captain Sam Hill (Tobey Maguire) is strapping on his LPCs and heading out to BFE, Afghanistan where he'll get sleepless nights in the sandbox and the 4 fingers of death for dinner, leaving his beautiful wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and their two daughters behind, bidding his Marine Corp father an Alpha Mike Foxtrot, his soup sandwich brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is being released from prison for an undisclosed crime.All is well in the MMFD until Hill's chopper flight goes Tango Uniform, hit by enemy fire.  Thrown to his fourth point of contact with no time to pop smoke, his situation is a FUBAR Charlie Foxtrot and he's taken prisoner by the Taliban.  Captured with a Private, Cpt. Hill reminds the lower enlisted Marine to remain disciplined and strong.  He is assumed dead, and his family is informed of the travesty.  Before the dress blues have left the driveway, Sam's brother Blue Falcons him back home, playing the role of Jodie with Grace.  When he's rescued, however, the movie heats up as PTSD hinders the reacclimation with his family and causes him to engage in the mental goat rope of infidelitous thoughts.Military lingo aside, this is a very compelling film dealing with timely subject matter.  The three leads are wonderful, but Tobey Maguire really stretches his legs in his role as a traumatized Marine back from war.  When he begins to go bug-eyed - aided by his gaunt appearance - it's genuinely disturbing.  The pacing away from war is a little slow but manageable.I give very high praise and recommendation for director Jim Sheridan's work in this film.  He made the right choices, let the stars dominate the screen, and created a wonderful, albeit imbalanced movie.",5,"Tobey Maguire shows his mettle, stepping out of the Spiderman costume",1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,2501,"['Contrary', 'what', 'trailer', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'not', 'modern', 'day', 'hedonistic', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'love', 'triangles', 'pseudo-incestuous', 'relationships', 'Save', 'garbage', 'Lifetime', 'A-Lister', 'female', 'celebrities', 'who', 'either', 'want', 'time', 'piece', 'belt', 'think', 'have', 'chops', 'translate', 'classic', 'piece', 'chick-lit', 'big', 'screen', 'more', 'modicum', 'success', 'Looking', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Instead', 'movie', 'instantly', 'gains', 'star', 'when', 'cheap', 'obvious', 'delving', 'rampant', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'PTSD', 'cases', 'resulting', 'wars', 'Middle', 'East', 'rather', 'actual', 'love', 'triangle', 'Allowing', 'superb', 'cast', 'channel', 'emotions', 'ranging', 'joy', 'despair', 'elation', 'psychosis', 'was', 'much', 'wiser', 'choice.Just', 'Jarhead', 'Captain', 'Sam', 'Hill', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'strapping', 'LPCs', 'heading', 'out', 'BFE', 'Afghanistan', 'where', ""'ll"", 'get', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'sandbox', '4', 'fingers', 'death', 'dinner', 'leaving', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Grace', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'two', 'daughters', 'bidding', 'Marine', 'Corp', 'father', 'Alpha', 'Mike', 'Foxtrot', 'soup', 'sandwich', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'undisclosed', 'crime.All', 'well', 'MMFD', 'Hill', 'chopper', 'flight', 'Tango', 'Uniform', 'hit', 'enemy', 'fire', 'Thrown', 'fourth', 'point', 'contact', 'time', 'pop', 'smoke', 'situation', 'FUBAR', 'Charlie', 'Foxtrot', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Taliban', 'Captured', 'Private', 'Cpt', 'Hill', 'lower', 'enlisted', 'Marine', 'remain', 'disciplined', 'strong', 'assumed', 'dead', 'family', 'informed', 'travesty', 'dress', 'blues', 'have', 'left', 'driveway', 'Sam', 'brother', 'Blue', 'Falcons', 'back', 'home', 'playing', 'role', 'Jodie', 'Grace', 'When', 'rescued', 'however', 'movie', 'up', 'PTSD', 'reacclimation', 'family', 'engage', 'mental', 'goat', 'rope', 'infidelitous', 'thoughts.Military', 'lingo', 'aside', 'very', 'compelling', 'film', 'dealing', 'timely', 'subject', 'matter', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'really', 'legs', 'role', 'traumatized', 'Marine', 'back', 'war', 'When', 'go', 'bug-eyed', 'aided', 'gaunt', 'appearance', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'pacing', 'away', 'war', 'little', 'slow', 'manageable.I', 'give', 'very', 'high', 'praise', 'recommendation', 'director', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'work', 'film', 'made', 'right', 'choices', 'let', 'stars', 'dominate', 'screen', 'created', 'wonderful', 'albeit', 'imbalanced', 'movie']",N/A

It's a danish movie and it stars Connie Neilsen (Gladiator) as the wife. The danish version is, in my humble opinion, superior. The acting is rougher and more realistic. The story is shot in a less ""finished"" product. More grain in the image. Darker. And there are more details within the scenes. The brother who is held captive actually has a purpose in the camp. Also, he promises something to someone... which make what he does even more sad. You then see him having remorses without being able to admit anything. It eats him inside and he even tries to let it all out in front of his superior. But he simply can't. You don't see that inner struggle in the american version. Not as much. You guess it and you sense it but you do not ""see"" it.And in the Danish film, the accident at the beginning leaves almost no chance for us to think that the brother-soldier will survive. In the U.S. version, you wonder why they would even think so fast that he's dead. After all, you just see a malfunction of the chopper even if it has been hit.Is it because i saw the foreign version before the american one? But it seems to me that the actor playing the brother (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) is more believable than Jake Gyllenhaal who is still a great actor. But Jake does not look as mean as the danish actor and the work he has to do with himself is therefore less important... and touching. The relationship between the two brothers is more believable in the danish version, i think. And the tension and love between Nikolaj Lie Kaas's character and his father is way more subtle and emotional than the american version.But in both films, i couldn't believe the love between the husband and the wife. But I could understand the passion between that same wife and her brother-in-law, though. But not between her and her husband. It's gotta be the ""chemistry"" between the actors i suppose. But When the brother-soldier becomes obssessive, both actors were superb, especially Tobey Maguire.All in all, there are a few things that i prefer in the american version but even so, i recommend the Danish version first. More realistic and less ""hollywood polished"". Then again, seing both film back to back is also highly recomended as it is a great exercise for any future screenwriter.",3,You can judge the movie itself but don't judge the story before you've seen the original danish version.,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,2380,"['***', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', '****First', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'original', 'film', 'shot', '2005', 'MUST', 'look', 'watch', 'danish', 'movie', 'Connie', 'Neilsen', 'Gladiator', 'wife', 'danish', 'version', 'humble', 'opinion', 'superior', 'acting', 'rougher', 'more', 'realistic', 'story', 'shot', 'less', 'finished', 'product', 'More', 'grain', 'image', 'Darker', 'are', 'more', 'details', 'scenes', 'brother', 'who', 'held', 'captive', 'actually', 'purpose', 'camp', 'Also', 'something', 'someone', 'make', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'sad', 'then', 'see', 'having', 'remorses', 'being', 'able', 'admit', 'anything', 'inside', 'even', 'let', 'out', 'front', 'superior', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'inner', 'struggle', 'american', 'version', 'Not', 'much', 'guess', 'sense', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'it.And', 'Danish', 'film', 'accident', 'beginning', 'almost', 'chance', 'think', 'brother-soldier', 'will', 'survive', 'U.S.', 'version', 'wonder', 'why', 'would', 'even', 'think', 'so', 'fast', 'dead', 'just', 'see', 'malfunction', 'chopper', 'even', 'been', 'hit.Is', 'i', 'saw', 'foreign', 'version', 'american', 'one', 'actor', 'playing', 'brother', 'Nikolaj', 'Lie', 'Kaas', 'more', 'believable', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'still', 'great', 'actor', 'Jake', 'not', 'look', 'as', 'mean', 'danish', 'actor', 'work', 'do', 'therefore', 'less', 'important', 'touching', 'relationship', 'two', 'brothers', 'more', 'believable', 'danish', 'version', 'i', 'think', 'tension', 'love', 'Nikolaj', 'Lie', 'Kaas', 'character', 'father', 'way', 'more', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'american', 'version.But', 'films', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'love', 'husband', 'wife', 'could', 'understand', 'passion', 'same', 'wife', 'brother-in-law', 'not', 'husband', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'i', 'suppose', 'When', 'brother-soldier', 'becomes', 'obssessive', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'especially', 'Tobey', 'Maguire.All', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'i', 'prefer', 'american', 'version', 'even', 'so', 'i', 'recommend', 'Danish', 'version', 'first', 'More', 'realistic', 'less', 'hollywood', 'polished', 'Then', 'again', 'seing', 'film', 'back', 'back', 'also', 'highly', 'recomended', 'great', 'exercise', 'future', 'screenwriter']",N/A

It is one of the few stories not afraid to throw the other sides of war into the spotlight for others to see.

Gyllenhaal is coming out of prison as Maguire is off to war.  Maguire's bird gets shot down and he is presumed dead.  Gyllenhaal steps in to take his brother's spot in their family until the truths start to come to head.The entire cast of this film is brilliantly acted.

When the Marine turns out to be alive, he returns to a home that doesn't perceive as home anymore, either on the surface nor beneath it.Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhall each turned in good performances in leading roles, as did Sam Shepherd in his supporting role, but the performance that most impressed me was Tobey Maguire's. I've never viewed Maguire as an actor with a lot of range or depth. In fact, it took me a while into this movie to get ""Spider-Man"" out of my head. But his turn as the returning war veteran was the standout of this film. Not Oscar-caliber, but definitely noteworthy, and he showed much more depth than I expected from him in his role.The pacing of the movie is slow, but not terribly slow. The story is very well-written, and there is some excellent metaphorical usage throughout, but the execution of it all simply falls flat. This movie could have easily slipped into ""message film"" mode, but it avoided that trap. We are reminded, however, that the price of war isn't measured in dollars. It's worth noting that I found the ending to be appropriate and satisfying in its subtlety.The mark of a good and/or memorable movie is one that you're able to discuss long after you've left the theater.

When his brother, an ex-con, steps in to look after his brother's presumed widow the viewer feels more of a connection between the two because they share more screen time and had more of a character development.

Gourdine ""IMJOHNNYDAFOX""","[1, 2]","First and foremost, if you're looking for a lot of action and possible explosions, then Brothers will probably bore you to sleep. However, if you're looking for a film that has a lot of drama and some suspense building up to an apex of action, then perhaps Brothers is for you.Brothers is about the model son/father/husband/soldier being called off to war to fight for his country. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is a ""favored son"",loving husband, great father and a Captain in the US Armed Forces.His brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is just returning home from prison from what appears to be a bank robbery. He is not to the son that he was supposed to turn out to be according to his father. This aspect plays out throughout the movie.Natalie Portman (Grace) is Sam's loving wife. She plays a gorgeous and supportive wife and loving mother.When Sam gets called off to war to go to Afghanistan, his life after that will never be the same again. You'll have to watch the movie yourself to determine why. While Sam is away fighting for our country, Tommy is good with Sam's kids and he also seems to fill an emotional void with Grace. Come to find out, Tommy has a secret crush on Grace. Grace and Tommy begin spending a lot of time together while Sam is away. And that time spent together seems to continue even after Sam comes home. Because of what Sam has endured in Afghanistan, he finds it extremely difficult to communicate with his wife and kids. Over time Sam seems to become suspicious of an affair between Grace and Tommy in spite of Tommy bringing another woman by the house. What I will say without giving away the movie is that Sam confronts both his wife and Tommy. The movie builds to an apex from there.In my opinion, Brothers lacked an appropriate ending. Though the drama was intense, there were too many loose ends that weren't tied up to make the movie complete. Everyone involved in the action portion of this film did a stellar job. It's the writers that did the actors an injustice by putting on (what I think) an incomplete movie. I'd give this movie 3 and half stars.

The other thing is the plot of the film, this had the potential to be a really great movie if they had of made it more about Jake and Natalie's characters becoming more romantically involved without the audience knowing Maguire's character is still alive until much later into the film.

Especially after the family is notified that Sam's plane crashed in Afghanistan and that he didn't survive.However, we soon glimpse scenes in Afghanistan that reveal that Sam is not dead, but a prisoner who is being tortured.  The horror is almost overwhelming.There are moments back home, though, where Tommy and Grace seem more and more connected.So imagine what will happen when Sam actually returns.

His father and stepmom are part of their life. The husband is played by Tobey, and he has a brother who he seems to be protective of, played by Jake. Jake's role is more of the scapegoat, being measured as less than by his father. It starts off just showing the way the family acts with each other than it branches off into Tobey's character going to war to Afghanastan. He and another officier get shot down and become prisoners of war. The torture scenes feel brutal and what is required brings Tobey's character waves of shame. He gets saved by a fleet of marines than has to go home and find that his life will never be the same again. His brother ends up filling his shoes while he was away. The title makes it seem like it was about the two and their connection together, yet I don't really see a plot line that warrants that title. The disasterous damage done to the psyche is reflected well by the actor, Maguire. You can see the set tension in his face and body language. The wife, Natalie, loves her husband and wants to support as best she can. She does a good job at showing her feelings on screen and is so believable.

I liked the caring and thoughtfulness that the brothers father showed to Portman's character and children by buying milk and just being so at ease with his extended role to them.

The story content however was depressing and fell short at the end. If you're looking for a movie depicting how war makes people do terrible things and ruins families, this is it. If you're looking for something about working thru hard times and pulling thru together, plan to be disappointed. All in all the story felt incomplete. Jake G's character was getting close to being more than an ex-con but never quite got there, ended as a jerk trying to be better. Toby M's actions as a prisoner were inexcusable and dishonorable and not suprisingly haunted him at home. My father was a WWII vet and I am certain down to my toes that he would have died before taking the life of a fellow American soldier to save his own. Fear and being a hostage does strange things to people but Toby's character lost it for me when he took that step. Natalie P's character never quite crosses the line into infidelity but just skirts it, so the love triangle the film leads you to expect falls flat. Good for her but made the movie more of a dud. The story ends on a downturn with Toby M in military custody, mentally unstable and Natalie willing to stay by his side though he can't commit to anything. Overall just plain depressing to watch. Movies don't have to be all hearts and flowers for me to enjoy them, I love a good Clint Eastwood crime flick. Brothers left me irritated with the characters,too many unresolved issues and with nothing positive,no honor at the end. It doesn't really end either, it just stops. At least Clint gets the bad guys in his movies. In Brothers, the good guys turned into bad guys. If it had gone farther, had Toby apologise to the family he destroyed or man-up in court for his actions,it could have been so much better.

1190743,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B001FB55L2,"L P ""lilip""","[1, 1]","When this movie first came out, all trailers and advertisements misled audiences into believing that it was some sort of a love-triangle type story a la ""Legends of the Fall"" - you know, two brothers who both fall for the same woman and the drama that ensues. In reality, it is more of an anti-war psychological drama exploring the profound effects of war on soldiers and ultimately their families. The acting is superb - especially Toby McGuire - and this movie is anything but a sappy love story about two brothers who fall for the same woman. That would have been trite and in and of itself is more of a side-line in this story. Jake Gyllenhaal kisses Portman once, when she is high, mourning and believing her husband to be dead. They dont have an affair, they dont fall in love and there really is not much of a relationship between them there.But, there is also not much of a relationship between the two brothers  - played by Gyllenhaal and Maguire - either. They don't act like brothers and friends who have each others' back; the brotherhood which - as the title of the film suggests - is supposed to be so essential to them and their relationship is not really established. They act more like buddies who haven't seen in each other in a while and exchange awkward and polite glances and gestures every now and then. This is one of the issues I had with this move: here we are to believe that these two have a special bond that gets them through the worst of times, but it doesn't naturally follow from the story and the actions of the characters. It feels forced. In other words, if it hadn't said in th script that Gyllenhaal and Maguire are to be brothers, you wouldn't know from their actions that they in fact are.Gyllenhaal is the outlaw and black sheep of the family who has gotten himself into trouble more times than he can remember - and is accordingly also not very welcome at home - while Maguire plays the beloved son who makes his father proud by having enlisted to bravely fight for his country. Maguire, before he deploys and also later, never has any kind of meaningful conversation with his brother about anything. When he welcomes Gyllenhaal back from prison, he is neither happy nor in any way emotionally touched to see him. As a matter of fact he draws a blank and gives him an awkward look. He never says he loves him no matter what he did and there is no ""buddy moment"" between the two.Natalie Portman plays the devoted, sweeter-than-sugar wife of Tobey Maguire's. She is so perfect and perky, and just beautiful and toned, that you want to poke her with a needle to see if she is real. Don't get me wrong, Portman is a great actress but I think she was seriously miscast for this part. As a mother of two and housewife in a small town she is just not believable. She was totally out of place - both looks wise as well as personality wise. Portman is just too young (or looks too young) to be able to pull off the mommy part. She could have easily played Maguire's teenage sister and would have actually been more believable. Her character also doesn't play the part of the mourning wife who has received devastating news very convincingly. I mean here is this woman who has been told that her husband and the love of her life, is dead, and you never see her crash, you never see her fall apart, you never see her unkempt or out of it or unpretty - she is always together, always pretty. Yes she does cry once when she gets his clothes for someone else, but 5 minutes later, she snaps out of it and is fine again.The best and most convincing part of the movie is Maguire's emotional melt-down after the horrors he witnessed in the war. That aspect of the story is really what's at the heart of this movie and the most convincing, heartbreaking but also powerful. I loved the depth with which the adverse psychological effects of war were explored and exposed. It was like a slap to the face of all those who somehow glorify and romanticize the notion of going to war and fighting for your country (such as Maguire's father). It dispels the myths that surround war and conquering, with brutal honesty.Many anti-war movies these days focus on the politics of war and the geopolitical implications of US presence in this fraudulent war in the middle east, but this movie goes right down to the heart of the matter, to the cellular level if you so will, one by one, layer by layer, peeling off and exposing the horrors and dysfunctions that are created when we send young people who have enthusiasm and ideals to fight a war for dubious and questionable political and economic ambitions; a war that crushes their spirit and mind - leaving them emotional, physical and spiritual wrecks for the rest of their lives. While movies like ""Platoon"" have already given us a glimpse into the not so romantic side of war, this movie really takes it to a human level, which many people can identify with.The writers have put their main focus on this aspect and the whole storyline about one brother possibly falling for his brother's wife, seems more like a distraction or sideline (or PR to sell the movie). I think the writers should have either just dropped that storyline altogether or really fleshed it out and explored it - which would have taken this movie down an entirely different path.Altogether I would say a powerful anti-war movie with substance and fantastic acting.",4,Great Movie Exploring the Psychological Effects of War,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,5399,"['When', 'movie', 'first',

Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Brothers is an emotional, realistic motion picture that tells the story of what can happen when someone is missing in action during wartime and presumed dead--and then returns back home to everyone's amazement. The casting was superb and the script, musical score and editing were all very well done; this is a gripping drama that had my eyes glued to the screen to find out more as the plot progressed and then to see what came of all of it. Another reviewer writes that this ""is as real as it gets;"" and indeed it was all so believably done I felt as if I were there!When the action starts, we meet Marine Captain Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire); he goes to get his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) out of prison; Tommy will now be on parole for a bank robbery. Sam also gets ready to leave his family to return to Afghanistan for yet another tour of duty, much to the chagrin of Sam's wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and his daughters Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare).It isn't long, though, before Sam and some of his men are shot down during a helicopter mission; and Sam along with his Marine buddy Joe Willis (Patrick John Flueger) are held by the Taliban as hostages. Because they cannot be found and the crash was very bad, the military tells Grace that her husband Sam has been killed in combat; and the entire family, including Tommy, begins a painful mourning experience. This includes many snide put-downs Tommy must endure from his father Hank (Sam Shepard).Things gets more complicated when Tommy innocently tries to console Grace and the young girls; he goes to great lengths to put some happiness back into their lives--in fact, Tommy and his buddies even build a new kitchen for Grace!  Grace and the other family members start to rebuild their lives--and that's just when Grace gets a phone call that Sam is actually still alive and is returning home quite soon.But Sam has changed very much because of the incredible psychological trauma he experienced at the hands of his captors. He has had to do something nearly unspeakable in order to be released from them; and Sam can't even tell them what he had to do. Sam is also possessed with the false notion that Tommy and Grace have started an intense romance in his absence when all they did was share a very brief and awkward kiss--just once.The rest of the plot is for you to learn as you watch the film. Suffice it to say that Sam's scars are profoundly deep (he has post-traumatic stress disorder) and he refuses to believe that Tommy and Grace have been just very good friends.There is some violence and a few four letter words in this movie; it's not for young children but adults may like this movie very much.The DVD comes with a few extras including an optional running audio commentary with director Jim Sheridan; a featurette entitled ""Remade in the USA: How Brdre Became Brothers"" and ""Jim Sheridan: Film and Family.""Brothers impressed me; the cast does a wonderful job and that's grand. I highly recommend this for people who like dramas and gritty war dramas.

El-Hewie""","[1, 7]","Brothers [Theatrical Release:he plan of linearly telling a multifaceted, long story diminished the joy of engaging the viewer. The movie attempted to cover too many places and scenarios in a short space, but to end up circumstantial on most themes. By the time the viewer gets a feel of the family life prior to the marine's leave to Afghanistan, the viewer is exposed to the brief and intense scenario of getting captured by the enemy. The scenario shifts back to the family adjustment after the news of missing the husband, father, and son marine.Here the movies touches on multiple scenarios on relation to the missing father of two daughters, the feeling of his widow, the struggle of the father of the missing marine, and the reaction of the community to such loss. In this complicated third scenario, the brother of the marine stands up to support the family of his lost brother. The troubled brother appeared saner than his prospering marine's brother.Then the movie shifts gears to explain the whereabouts of the war prisoner, with no clear idea why he was compelled to kill his mate other than making a video tape. The return home that surprised the unexacting family was cold and lacked any appropriate preparation. By then, the viewer has already been shuffled back and forth between three disconnected family situations, three disconnected marine personalities, and very sketchy capturing drama.The viewer is thus witnessing the two sides of totally disconnected theaters of events in total defiance of real life experience. Such improper and unreal feeding of news could only happen long after discovery completes. With the simultaneous reporting of events, the viewer already expects the reaction of the characters since their prior inducing experiences were told in advance.The display of the posttraumatic struggle was very brief and tense and should have been more elaborate to allow for reasonable outcome. It was not clear whether the returned marine injured by his own incarceration or his suspicion of his wife's betrayal or otherwise.The choice of the actors and their roles was spotless.

Everybody expects him to suck it up and resume the kind of existence he led before his horrible war experiences. However, Sam actually grew some personality during his captivity and torture. He is incapable of understanding this empty kind of life any more, let alone actually living itThe powerful and painful message of this movie is that some people can only be shaken out of the stupor they live in by something as horrible as what Sam goes through in Afghanistan.

1190766,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001FB55L2,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""Brothers"" is an American remake of an excellent Danish drama from 2004.  As the title suggests, the story centers on two male siblings who are essentially polar opposites of one another.  Sam (Tobey Maguire) is an upright family man and lifelong Marine who has already served one tour in Afghanistan and is all set to embark on a second.  Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a ne'er-do-well ex-con who's released from prison on the very same week Sam is being re-deployed to the battlefield, leaving a wife (Natalie Portman) and two young daughters (the delightful Bailee Madison and Taylor Grace Geare) behind at home.  When news comes that Sam has been killed in a helicopter crash, Tommy is there to help pick up the pieces, leading to some potential romantic complications between him and his brother's grieving widow, Grace.  But that turns out to be only half the story, as anyone familiar with the Danish version already knows.Written by David Benioff and directed by Jim Sheridan, ""Brothers"" follows the original fairly closely in terms of outline and incident, focusing on one man's attempts to turn his life around after making a mess of things, and another's efforts to come to terms with an action he performed under duress that his conscience will clearly never allow him to live with.  The complex relationships among the three principal players - along with Sam's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - are dealt with in an adult and thoughtful fashion, with a minimum of melodrama and nary a hint of sensationalism.  The conflicts are further exacerbated by the men's father (Sam Shepherd), a hardnosed Vietnam vet whose personal preference for Sam over Tommy has been evident to both boys from very early on in their lives.""Brothers"" reveals its European roots in its more deliberate pacing, its emotional complexity, its lack of judgment towards its characters, and its willingness to leave some loose ends hanging at the end.  Maguire and Gyllenhaal are both excellent as the two torn brothers trying to stay close despite their differences - as are Portman, Shepherd and Mare Winningham as the boys' loving and conciliatory step mom whose calming influence over her husband goes a long way towards ameliorating some otherwise potentially volatile situations.",4,generally faithful adaptation of the Danish original,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,2264,"['Brothers', 'American', 'remake', 'excellent', 'Danish', 'drama', '2004', 'title', 'story', 'centers', 'two', 'male', 'siblings', 'who', 'are', 'essentially', 'polar', 'opposites', 'one', 'Sam', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'upright', 'family', 'man', 'lifelong', 'Marine', 'who', 'already', 'served', 'one', 'tour', 'Afghanistan', 'set', 'embark', 'second', 'Tommy', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'ex-con', 'who', 'released', 'prison', 'very', 'same', 'week', 'Sam', 'being', 're-deployed', 'battlefield', 'leaving', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'delightful', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'Taylor', 'Grace', 'Geare', 'home', 'When', 'news', 'Sam', 'been', 'killed', 'helicopter', 'crash', 'Tommy', 'there', 'help', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'leading', 'potential', 'romantic', 'complications', 'brother', 'grieving', 'widow', 'Grace', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'story', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'Danish', 'version', 'already', 'knows.Written', 'David', 'Benioff', 'directed', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'Brothers', 'original', 'fairly', 'closely', 'terms', 'outline', 'incident', 'focusing', 'one', 'man', 'attempts', 'turn', 'life', 'making', 'mess', 'things', 'efforts', 'come', 'terms', 'action', 'performed', 'duress', 'conscience', 'will', 'clearly', 'never', 'allow', 'live', 'complex', 'relationships', 'three', 'principal', 'players', 'Sam', 'Post-Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'are', 'dealt', 'adult', 'thoughtful', 'fashion', 'minimum', 'melodrama', 'nary', 'hint', 'sensationalism', 'conflicts', 'are', 'further', 'exacerbated', 'men', 'father', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'hardnosed', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'personal', 'preference', 'Sam', 'Tommy', 'been', 'evident', 'boys', 'very', 'early', 'lives', 'Brothers', 'European', 'roots', 'more', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'lack', 'judgment', 'towards', 'characters', 'willingness', 'leave', 'loose', 'ends', 'hanging', 'end', 'Maguire', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'excellent', 'two', 'torn', 'brothers', 'trying', 'stay', 'close', 'differences', 'are', 'Portman', 'Shepherd', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'boys', 'loving', 'conciliatory', 'step', 'mom', 'calming', 'influence', 'husband', 'long', 'way', 'ameliorating', 'otherwise', 'potentially', 'volatile', 'situations']",N/A

The quasi romance between Tommy (Jake) and Grace (Natalie) only amounted to slow flirtation. This storyline would have more depth if there were a real relationship formed when Sam (Tobey) was rescued from Afghanistan. Indeed, the story of Sam's ordeal and subsequent torment provides all the driving intensity in this movie. Tobey does a good job in portraying a psychological damaged individual. In the climax, Sam finally blows up emotionally over the perceived betrayal by his brother Tommy and his wife Grace, but underneath, the cause for his breakdown is his own guilt over his action towards a brother of war in Afghanistan. In some ways, the Tommy and Grace story, rather light and enjoyable, is like a sugar coat around the bitter theme of the price of war.",4,Watch it for Tobey,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,894,"['fact', 'Jake', 'Natalie', 'are', 'listed', 'stars', 'roles', 'really', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'haunting', 'role', 'Tobey', 'quasi', 'romance', 'Tommy', 'Jake', 'Grace', 'Natalie', 'only', 'amounted', 'slow', 'flirtation', 'storyline', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'depth', 'were', 'real', 'relationship', 'formed', 'when', 'Sam', 'Tobey', 'was', 'rescued', 'Afghanistan', 'Indeed', 'story', 'Sam', 'ordeal', 'subsequent', 'torment', 'driving', 'intensity', 'movie', 'Tobey', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'psychological', 'damaged', 'individual', 'climax', 'Sam', 'finally', 'up', 'emotionally', 'perceived', 'betrayal', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'wife', 'Grace', 'underneath', 'cause', 'breakdown', 'own', 'guilt', 'action', 'brother', 'war', 'Afghanistan', 'ways', 'Tommy', 'Grace', 'story', 'rather', 'light', 'enjoyable', 'sugar', 'coat', 'bitter', 'theme', 'price', 'war']",N/A
1190768,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B001FB55L2,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`Brothers' is essentially a film about the impact of war on a family. Sam (Tobey Maguire) is a marine who goes off to war in Afghanistan and whose plane gets shot down and he is presumed dead, whilst in reality being held captive by the Taliban. Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is his brother who starts to look after Sam's family and develops a deep relationship with Sam's wife, played by Natalie Portman, as well as with Sam`s two daughters. Sam experiences some truly horrendous things during his captivity and has trouble adjusting to civilian life on his return and starts to have suspicions about the intimacy of his wife and brothers relationship. This film is very well directed and some scenes are excellently framed and shot, most notably those in Afghanistan. The acting from all three main stars is very good as well and Portman is her usual exemplary self. Maguire portrays the angst and trauma of a returned soldier well and although he is the weakest actor here, he is still very credible. There are some VERY powerful scenes in this film and there is a tension towards the end that keeps you hooked. There are also some real tender and softer moments too which balance the film well. You realise watching this film that the mental trauma of war can be just as potent as the physical impact and misdirected anger, when not properly dealt with, can tear a family apart. It is also worth mentioning that I enjoyed the soundtrack and felt it complimented the film perfectly. All in all this is a film with impact and although it has it's flaws (the most obvious being the biased, clich&eacute;d and stereotyped portrayal of the Taliban) it manages to keep you engrossed for the duration and gives you plenty of food for thought.

1190772,A4JHEO7H330AF,B001FB55L2,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","BROTHERS (2009) stars Tobey Maguire as a Captain in the U.S. Marines, Jake Gyllenhaal as his deadbeat ex-con brother, and Natalie Portman as Tobey's wife.  The story opens on October 7, 2007, and shows Marines in training and jogging, with snow to the side of a road.  Then, we see Tobey at his desk, writing a goodbye letter to his wife.  Tobey specifies that the letter is to be opened only of Tobey is killed in action.  (The letter is not opened until near the end of the movie.)  In the next scene, Tobey hands the letter to a major.  The Major is played by Clifton Collins, who I recognized from another war picture, Tigerland (2000).At 2 and a half minutes, the scene shows Tobey at home with his wife and two girls, Isabelle (older) and Maggie (younger).Tobey: Hey, hey baby.  How was school?Maggie (in bathtub): Great!Tobey Maguire then goes to Isabelle's room.  She is in her bed, busily reading.Tobey: What's wrong, honey?Isabelle (sullen):  You're leaving again.Tobey: Come give your daddy a hug.Isabelle: No.Tobey: Come on, give me a kiss.Isabelle (still sullen): Just go.Tobey: Three kisses?Isabelle: I wanna read my book.Tobey (probingly and flirtatiously):  I see a smile coming!Isabelle then squeals with laughter, and the pair make a happy daddy and daughter.Tobey: Now you're getting 100 kisses.Then the younger daughter (Maggie) enters the room, jumps up and down on the bed, and then leaps on Tobey's shoulders.  Tobey picks up Isabelle, and totes both girls about, the three of them engaging in the typical ecstasy that characterizes daddies and their girls.  I am not sure how the scriptwriter got it right, but everything is perfect about this particular scene, that is, the fact that little kids change from sullenness to delightful laughter in a wink, and the fact that little kids seem to have a requirement for bed-bouncing written on their birth certificate.The next scene, which is four minutes into the movie, shows Jake being released from prison.  He is in a good mood, as he is escorted past various cells, and the other prisoners merrily wish him well.  Tobey picks up Jake in his pickup truck, and the two brothers are glad to see each other.JAKE RE-UNITES WITH FAMILY.  Jake goes to Tobey's house.  Maggie says to Jake, ""Mom doesn't like you.""  Tobey's father (the grandfather) says to Jake, ""Your brother is a hero, he's serving his country, now don't you forget that.""  Grandfather is a Vietnam war vet, who has an axe to grind, and who enjoys pontificating about the virtues of the Marines and how tough they are.  Grandfather's occasional axe-to-grind opinions gently add to the film's purposeful increase in the general stress-level within the family. At 11 minutes, Tobey takes off his wedding ring, and gives it to Natalie Portman, who realizes that they are both preparing for his possible death, and she strings it around her neck.  At 13 minutes, we see Tobey in his helicopter, and with in a minute, it gets shot down over the desert.  A few seconds later, we see Natalie in her bathtub at home, and the doorbell rings, and two Marines are at the door with the bad news.  At 15 minutes, Natalie is crying because of the news that Tobey is dead.  At 16 minutes (at midnight), Jake (the slacker, and brother of Tobey) arrives in the pickup truck that he'd borrowed from Natalie.  He is returning it after borrowing it.  The taillight had been accidentally broken (this indicates Jake's incompetence).  Jake is welcomed inside, where grandfather is busy nursing a liquor bottle.  Grandfather offers Jake some liquor, but Jake says no.  Nobody says much in this scene.  At the funeral, grandfather is in his Vietnam war military uniform, and he drinks from a liquor flask.  The Major gives Natalie the letter that Tobey's written, but she does not open it.  (She opens it at the end of the movie.)  Jake tells grandfather to hand over his car keys, because Jake knows that grandfather was drinking liquor at the funeral.  There is a little argument, which serves to increase the general background of family stress, which so characterizes the cleverly written screenplay.ALTERNATING SCENES FROM AFGHANISTAN & HOME.  At 24 minutes, we see Tobey and another Marine (Private Willis) being marched through the desert.  They are locked into a hole in the ground.  In the next scene, occurring at 3 am, Jake calls Natalie from a bar, requesting to be picked up, and requesting that she pay Jake's $47 bar tab.  Natalie drives to the bar, but Jake is disorganized and talks childish nonsense to the bartender, believing himself to be amusing.  ""Tommy, I have two little girls sleeping in the parking lot at 3 am,"" says Natalie angrily.The next scene is in the kitchen at home in the morning.  ""No drinking out of the carton, it's gross,"" scolds Maggie, when Jake drinks from the carton.  Grandfather arrives, and apologizes for drinking liquor at the funeral.  At 32 minutes, back in the desert, we see Tobey and the private in their underground jail cell.  Then at home, Jake surprises Natalie by arranging for his friends to do a professional makeover of the family kitchen.  Then, the scene returns to the desert, and Tobey repeatedly instructs the Private never to give away information.  We see the Afghanis executing one of their own soldiers, because the soldier had used his cell phone to talk to his family, thereby risking the secrecy of their location.ROMANCE.  Back at home, Natalie says to Jake, ""I didn't like you, you were always drunk and fighting,"" recollecting earlier days.  They share a joint, then engage in chit-chat about pop music, and then they smooch for a little bit (yum, yum).  Then, Natalie withdraws from their embrace, and proclaims, ""I have to go outside to get some air.""  And so she goes outside, and Jake cries by himself for several seconds.  (But I don't care about Jake's little emotional cubbyhole, because Jake is just a happy-go-lucky slacker.)BIG TURNING POINT.  At 55 minutes, we are back on the desert, and Tobey is forced to kill the Private with an iron pipe.  At first, Tobey tosses the iron pipe on the desert sand, but then a half dozen Afghanis point their guns at Tobey, and his face contorts, and he does the unthinkable.  (This is not the same Tobey Maguire that we know and love from SEABISCUIT.)NOBODY REALIZES IT.  Tobey is rescued by American soldiers, and he phones Natalie, and everybody is happy and things seem to be back to normal. At 63 minutes, Tobey steps off an airplane, and he embraces his family and friends, who were waiting at the airport.  At 66 minutes, Natalie enters the bathroom where Tobey is shaving, and she sees the torture wounds on his back, but she says nothing.At 67 minutes, the grandfather says this to Tobey, ""After I got back from Nam, I took it out on you and your mother . . . if you want to talk, just let me know.""  (But the grandfather does not realize that his son Tobey has been converted into a somebody who is not his usual self.). At 69 minutes, Tobey asks Jake if he had gotten intimate with his wife (Natalie), and adds, ""I can forgive you.""  But Jake responds, ""What's going on in your head that makes you think that?""  In the next scene, occurring at home, the widow of the dead Private comes over with her infant, and pays a social call, and engages in chit-chat with Natalie.  Tobey appears, and she asks him, ""Did you see him die,"" not realizing that Tobey was forced to bash her husband's head open with an iron pipe.  Tobey succinctly answers, ""No.""MANIFESTATIONS OF MENTAL STRESS.  At 74 minutes, Tobey is back on the Marine base, and he requests additional duty in Afghanistan.  The Major refers to his continuing counseling.  In the next scene, at home, Isabelle makes a funny children's joke about elephant ears.  Tobey does not respond to the joke, and Isabelle asks him if he is alright.  Tobey accuses Jake of doing it with his wife.  Tobey rushes out into the night, and visits the grave of the dead Private.  In the family scenes that follow, Isabelle is fearful of her father.THE BALLOON SCENE.  In my opinion, the balloon scene is one of the finest tension-building scenes in the history of American cinema.  Maggie (the younger daughter) is having her birthday party, and Jake brings his new girlfriend, a nursing student.  ""This is an old friend,"" announces Jake.  In good humor, the nursing student adds, ""Actually, we just met an hour ago.""  At the birthday party, the grandfather makes an unintentional jab at Tobey, where the result is an increase in Tobey's stress.  Grandfather says, ""These days they need therapy if you stub their toe.  These guys are Marines, they're trained for it.""  The nursing student jumps into the dialogue, and although understanding that Marines are trained to kill, she adds that ""a Marine cannot be trained to watch people die.""  (None of the people at the birthday party table know that all of this talk is pushing Tobey over the edge.)  At 75 minutes, begins the balloon-squeaking scene.  Isabelle reaches for a floating balloon, by the string.  She begins to squeak it, while looking at her father across the table.  After about ten minutes of this on-and-off squeaking, Tobey has reached his limit, and he momentarily blows up, yelling, ""ENOUGH.""IMPLANTING WORDS INTO THE MOUTHS OF BABES.  Do you remember the line from the movie, E.T., where a little boy called another boy, ""Penis-breath?""  Well, this film discloses more of the same thing, that is, adults implanting words into the mouths of babes.  Isabelle, who is visibly upset, declares to her father, ""Couldn't you just stay dead?  You're just mad 'cause mom would rather sleep with Uncle Tommy than you.  Mom and Uncle Tommy had sex all the time.""  From this point on, Tobey is not his usual self.  I do not give away the ending.",5,"A masterful disclosure of stress, attempts to conceal stress, and situations that synergize to make the mental pot boil over",1404691200,"07 7,

The soldier has a family of his own that loves him, and the brother that is a screw-up only has his brother to love him. Things change, however, when the world falls apart and the soldier appears dead. Then the other brother brings in people to help with the house, to help with the family, and to try to heal. He screws up some, too, and moves in n his brother's wife by mistake. As this is happening, the soldier is held captive with another soldier and finds himself having to do some horrible things to stay alive.Still, he lives and comes home.When he comes home, he has some horrible things in his mind and, worse still, he sees what his brother has done for his wife. He notes the house and the happiness of the kids and thinks that he has been traded in for a different model. This leads him to think that maybe the world is broken and that maybe the one thing that kept him alive no long needs him.It is horribly sad.The problem with this movie is not in the build or the things that happen as the soldier has to survive or the things that the family does. The kid's acting is great and the things that are done have a natural flow to them. The nightmares make sense, too, as do the things that seem to haunt the jealous clouds. I could see how that could easily play out when a man had only one need when it came to home, and how mistrust would show its head when he found himself needing.The problem I have is how it all comes to a conclusion. you expect one thing and, well, you won't get what you think. You will instead have a happy movie that the commercials lied about and you will think ""why."" And perhaps the reason is to say that happiness can be secured and perhaps it is to thwart the flow of ugly movies that have soldiers going mad. It has been shown that soldiers are the one type of person we see as going mad more than any other in movies, after all, and maybe that is bad. Maybe, but I still wanted it to get gruesome because it was what I thought I was being promised.O well.Should you rent it? Maybe, if you seem to think this is for you. I would not suggest it, liking it enough to give it a 2.8 or so, but not really happy with that ending. It bothered me a lot, more than I normally let a segment get to me, but I wanted something.Take your chance - a lot of people liked it and maybe you will, too. i simply found it lackluster and, if nothing else, more like an MTV production than anything.

Even from the trailers, it seemed there was more to it but after watching it, you find it's a different story. Toby Maguire's character is married to Natalie Portman's character and they have two daughters. He has a brother who just got out of prison, played by Jake Gyllenhaal . The simple premise is, Maguire leaves for Afghanistan just as his brother is released and then something happens during his tour of duty, and his family believes him to be dead. We find out very quickly this is not the case, but at home, things get a bit cozy between Portman and Gyllenhaal. Like I said, the trailer leads you to believe their relationship truly progresses to a deeper level, but in reality, the only thing that really transpires is literally one kiss. Not to say that they don't feel anything, but things don't go further for them. Then they find out Maguire is still alive, though he has been a prisoner of war for some time and had to endure a traumatizing event. This is where the true drama begins.After Maguire is rescued and sent back home, his family very quickly realizes that everything is not OK. He is clearly traumatized though he does a good deal to hide it, even asking his commanding officer to send him back to war. His marriage is strained and so is the relationship with his children. He gets it in his head that his brother slept with his wife, and that sets him off during a tense, climactic scene.Basically, what I found misleading is the fact that the title is called Brothers, and yet, there is not much in the story that really pertains and establishes their relationship to each other. Yes, they seem to care for each other, but there is nothing deeper that is developed or explored. Also, for some strange reason, I found the fact that both Portman and Maguire are parents slighly unbelievable. I'm not sure why, but it just seemd somewhat odd whenever they were around the children. Besides that, I thought Brothers was a solid film, that really deals with what seems to be a recurring theme in real life-the lives of soldiers after they come home. What horrors they've faced, and how to begin again or return to their former lives.

Haunted by his experiences, suffering from paranoia, Sam finds it difficult to settle back into the life he once occupied.A remake of a 2004 Danish film ""Brdre"" which originally starred Connie Nielsen (""Gladiator""), Jim Sheridan's powerful drama retains the plot and dynamics of the original film while adding a dramatic nuance unique for American audiences. While it doesn't quite measure up to the original Danish film which has a plot twist that is missing here that adds power to the conflict between the brothers, Sheridan's film hits most of the right notes and is rarely off key.The performances from each of the actors adds to the film with the lead actors giving strong multi-layered performances. The screenplay by writer David Benioff (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""The Kite Runner"", ""Stay"" and ""Troy"")feels authentic but the removal of one major plot twist does rob this film of some of its complexity.The Blu-ray has a sharp, beautiful looking transfer and nicely capturing the lovely Santa Fe landscape. We get an intelligent commentary track with director Jim Sheridan discussing what captivated him about the original drama and his own approach to the material; we also get a trio of featurettes on the production including one that focuses on translating the original film for an American audience without losing the essence of what made the original ""Brdre"" so powerful.""Brothers"" may not work as well as the original film due to some changes to the plot of the film but the performances and direction ring so true that one can forgive the change and its impact on this drama. Each film is uniquely powerful and Sheridan's ""Brothers"" gets more right than wrong and is well worth watching.A complaint about the Blu-ray (and maybe this applies to the DVD as well I don't know) but I find it ANNOYING when I have to wade through previews and an advertisement for Blu-ray to get to the main menu so I can watch the film. It's unfriendly authoring and not well done. It's also a tactic that other studios are using and it's NOT consumer friendly (not that they have ever cared about that). If you buy (or rent) a disc you should be able to bypass all of this junk and NOT waste your time waiting for the film to start. Blu-ray menus that use Java (which this does) were originally designed so you could just jump to the menu and choose what you want to watch.

1190778,A24J6PQ0FN55A6,B001FB55L2,WestGrl,"[0, 1]","Brothers was a very emotional movie but it's not so much a war movie but an intimate look at one family. Those expecting the normal blood & gore war movie may not get what they are looking for. I thought the acting was wonderful. I've never been a big fan of Tobey Maguire's but this was a side of him that I have not seen & I was happy to see him go to a character that is not the norm for him. I especially was moved by the acting of the older daughter. The emotion you see on her face for such a little girl was amazing.I've read some of the past reviews mentioning PTSD & how this movie is unreal or anti-military. For anyone that bothered to watch the Special Features on the DVD, you will know this was originally a Danish movie that was remade in America. Second, even if you know someone who has suffered PTSD, doesn't mean you are an expert. As with any form of mental illness there are varying degrees. This wasn't some guy coming home from the war who was a little messed up in the head from watching people die. This was a man who suffered a traumatizing crash, was held as a POW, tortured, starved, etc. Every person handles these situations differently. It's also been proved that people who suffer head trauma can suffer from worse cases. Since this Marine was in a crash it could very well be he suffered a hard hit to the head. There are cases of soldiers that come home & kill loved ones. These are the extreme cases, like in this movie, the cases that are very few but can happen. This movie helps to show you more then just the blood & gore part of war, it shows what can happen to our soldiers when they come home if we don't take care of them. If we expect them to ""be a man"" & brush themselves off & go back to their lives as if nothing happened. The least we owe them is to make sure they are ok when they come home. Is that anti-American?

1190780,AP3B615GM191G,B001FB55L2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 5]","Well, here it is again...another one of those situations where the trailer is actually better than the film itself.  After viewing that preview for ""Brothers"", I had high hopes that it would succeed where ""Jarhead"" failed in telling the next ""Rambo"" story (this time about the Iraq War instead of Vietnam).  Unfortunately, the film was much too understated and sparse to do anything of the sort.The basic premise of the movie sees a young Marine (Tobey Maguire) supposedly die in a helicopter wreck while serving in Iraq.  The wife (Natalie Portman) and two daughters he left behind mourn his death, and are comforted by the Marine's brother (Jake Gyllenhaal).  When ""Gyllenhaal"" and ""Portman"" get to be a little more than friends, however, the sudden, unexpected return of ""Maguire"" creates a high amount of tension.Here's the problem: If the film had focused on that description (and the one teased to us in the trailer), I think it would have been a much more memorable film.  The conceptual love triangle that could have played out would have had the potential to tread on new ground in terms of military pictures, creating a sense of high drama.  Instead, though, the ultimate vision of the film focuses far too much on Maguire's mental anguishes and doesn't allow the relationship drama to blossom.SPOILER ALERT: While presumed dead, Maguire is tortured by his enemy, even forced to kill a fellow Marine in cold blood.  Thus, when he comes back home, he is a sort of walking zombie of his former self.  He isn't able to reconcile his actions and allow himself to slip back into the real world, and even the hint of a Gyllenhall-Portman relationship pushes him over the edge (before that angle has any time to dramatically build).Sadly, in a way, the acting is actually at a very high quality, with the ""lead three"" giving great performances and the auxiliary cast doing a tremendous job in rounding things out (the ""Dad"" and ""oldest girl"" characters are very interesting to watch).  However, director Jim Sheridan didn't seem to be able to decide which film he wanted to make: the one about the effects of torture on a Marine's psyche, or the one about how he fits back in with his family after being presumed dead.  Sheridan tries to ""go epic"" and do both, but ends up accomplishing neither.Thus, unless you can stand a movie in which many themes are thrown at you that are never really fleshed-out or fully realized in the end, I would recommend staying away from this one.

The story focuses on the Cahill family - Captain Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire in a compelling and finely nuanced role) loves his wife Grace (Natalie Portman who is amazing as always) and his two young daughters and is also strongly connected to his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal). As Sam gets ready to be deployed to Afghanistan, Tommy is released from prison for robbing a bank. When Grace receives news that Sam died in a helicopter crash somewhere in the mountains of Afghanistan, it is Tommy who looks in on her and the girls and forms a close relationship with the kids. There is a certain amount of chemistry between the still grieving Grace and the turned-over-a-new-leaf Tommy who finally seems to have a purpose.But it turns out that Sam is not dead after all - he returns from Afghanistan emotionally empty and psychologically damaged. His young daughters no longer feel comfortable around him and seek out Tommy's company instead. Grace is at her wits' end as to how to cope with this stranger in her life, not realizing the dark and tortured secret Sam carries within him. Sam, in his anguish, turns upon those he loves, accusing Grace and Tommy of having an affair and things quickly go downhill.What makes this a watchable drama is the compelling and credible performances by the three lead actors, i.e. Maguire, Gyllenhaal, and Portman. Maguire convinces us of the harrowing effects of war on the human psyche and of how this in turn impacts families - this is a situation that is very relevant given current events. Gyllenhaal also turns in a fine performance as the younger brother who is deemed a failure by many, yet manages to turn his life around. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Portman is strong and in fact, I felt that their relationship seemed more credible than the one portrayed between the husband and wife. Portman delivers a heartrending performance as the devoted and confused wife who struggles to help her husband through his crisis. The young actors who portray the daughters are amazing, especially the actor playing the older daughter who convincingly emotes all her confusion and sadness at this strange and scary person who once used to be a loving and fun father. There is one scene around the family dining table which sees all the anger, hurt, and confusion  convincingly portrayed and which left a strong impression on me. All in all, this is a compelling movie about how a soldier copes with the harrowing effects of war, and of its impact on those close to him.",4,Credibly acted movie about family and the psychological scars of war,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,2750,"['When', 'rented', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'was', 'remake', 'Danish', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'i.e.Brothersand', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'Danish', 'version', 'plan', 'thought', 'American', 'remake', 'was', 'credibly', 'acted', 'three', 'lead', 'actors', 'story', 'Cahill', 'family', 'Captain', 'Sam', 'Cahill', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'compelling', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'role', 'wife', 'Grace', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'amazing', 'always', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'also', 'strongly', 'connected', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Sam', 'ready', 'be', 'deployed', 'Afghanistan', 'Tommy', 'released', 'prison', 'robbing', 'bank', 'When', 'Grace', 'news', 'Sam', 'died', 'helicopter', 'crash', 'somewhere', 'mountains', 'Afghanistan', 'Tommy', 'who', 'girls', 'close', 'relationship', 'kids', 'certain', 'amount', 'chemistry', 'still', 'grieving', 'Grace', 'turned-over-a-new-leaf', 'Tommy', 'who', 'finally', 'have', 'purpose.But', 'out', 'Sam', 'not', 'dead', 'Afghanistan', 'emotionally', 'empty', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'young', 'daughters', 'no', 'longer', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'seek', 'out', 'Tommy', 'company', 'instead', 'Grace', 'wits', 'end', 'how', 'cope', 'stranger', 'life', 'not', 'realizing', 'dark', 'tortured', 'secret', 'Sam', 'Sam', 'anguish', 'accusing', 'Grace', 'Tommy', 'having', 'affair', 'things', 'quickly', 'go', 'downhill.What', 'watchable', 'drama', 'compelling', 'credible', 'performances', 'three', 'lead', 'actors', 'i.e', 'Maguire', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Portman', 'Maguire', 'harrowing', 'effects', 'war', 'human', 'psyche', 'how', 'turn', 'impacts', 'families', 'situation', 'very', 'relevant', 'given', 'current', 'events', 'Gyllenhaal', 'also', 'fine', 'performance', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'deemed', 'failure', 'many', 'yet', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'chemistry', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Portman', 'strong', 'fact', 'felt', 'relationship', 'seemed', 'more', 'credible', 'one', 'portrayed', 'husband', 'wife', 'Portman', 'heartrending', 'performance', 'devoted', 'confused', 'wife', 'who', 'help', 'husband', 'crisis', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'daughters', 'are', 'amazing', 'especially', 'actor', 'playing', 'older', 'daughter', 'who', 'convincingly', 'confusion', 'sadness', 'strange', 'scary', 'person', 'who', 'once', 'used', 'be', 'loving', 'fun', 'father', 'one', 'scene', 'family', 'dining', 'table', 'anger', 'hurt', 'confusion', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'left', 'strong', 'impression', 'compelling', 'movie', 'how', 'soldier', 'copes', 'harrowing', 'effects', 'war', 'impact', 'close']",N/A
