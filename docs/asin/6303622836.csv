382110,A1MBR816GYHY71,6303622836,"Doc ""Dr. M. Anthony Collins, Ph.D., CIET""","[1, 1]","Martial Artist throughout the world now Cynthia Rothrock (one of two non-Asian Queens of MA) who is well know for combining Chinese Martial arts with Karate. If you ever attended a B, AA or AAA martial art tournament on the west central west or east coast worth anything she was there. I met her and Keith Cook at two of these events when I was an (Hung Gar/ Tang Lang) exhibitionist in the late 1970's until mid 1980's.I can honestly say few people know about the Hung style (except of watching Shaw Brothers movies). Nor are people familiar with several of the Hung systems subdivisions. let's meet  Sifu Don Niam. Sifu Niam is a master of Hung Fot Kung Fu (10 animal system)  which is one hardcore subdivision. If you are familiar with Hung Gar (5 animal-5 element system), Hung Kuen or even Choy Li Fut (5 animal systems)  you will be entertained by this movie. Although a ""B"" rated movie it delivers in power and shows you that this system was designed to be fluid as well as take and deliver punishment. The acting of Sifu Niam and Sifu John Miller (who is also a Hung martial artist) both need a lot of work. I guess that's why Sifu Niam is not well known except for in the MA cult classic world.  However if you like action, this movie delivers.  Also, for people who know the true meaning of WuShu and Kung Fu you will understand why I didn't say Gung Fu (which is the correct term for southern systems) - Except can be interchangeable for systems which incorporate northern and southern techniques i.e. Wu Shu Wu meaning 'martial' = techniques/skill and Shu meaning 'art' of war/fighting",4,WuShu Meets Hung,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,1597,"['Martial', 'Artist', 'world', 'now', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'one', 'two', 'non-Asian', 'Queens', 'MA', 'who', 'well', 'know', 'combining', 'Chinese', 'Martial', 'arts', 'Karate', 'ever', 'attended', 'B', 'AA', 'AAA', 'martial', 'art', 'tournament', 'west', 'central', 'west', 'east', 'coast', 'worth', 'anything', 'was', 'there', 'met', 'Keith', 'Cook', 'two', 'events', 'when', 'was', 'Hung', 'Gar/', 'Tang', 'Lang', 'exhibitionist', 'late', '1970', 'mid', ""1980's.I"", 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'few', 'people', 'know', 'Hung', 'style', 'watching', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'movies', 'are', 'people', 'familiar', 'several', 'Hung', 'systems', 'subdivisions', 'let', 'meet', 'Sifu', 'Don', 'Niam', 'Sifu', 'Niam', 'master', 'Hung', 'Fot', 'Kung', 'Fu', '10', 'animal', 'system', 'one', 'hardcore', 'subdivision', 'are', 'familiar', 'Hung', 'Gar', '5', 'animal-5', 'element', 'system', 'Hung', 'Kuen', 'even', 'Choy', 'Li', 'Fut', '5', 'animal', 'systems', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'movie', 'B', 'rated', 'movie', 'power', 'system', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'fluid', 'as', 'well', 'take', 'deliver', 'punishment', 'acting', 'Sifu', 'Niam', 'Sifu', 'John', 'Miller', 'who', 'also', 'Hung', 'martial', 'artist', 'need', 'lot', 'work', 'guess', 'why', 'Sifu', 'Niam', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'MA', 'cult', 'classic', 'world', 'However', 'like', 'action', 'movie', 'delivers', 'Also', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'true', 'meaning', 'WuShu', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'Gung', 'Fu', 'correct', 'term', 'southern', 'systems', 'can', 'be', 'interchangeable', 'systems', 'incorporate', 'northern', 'southern', 'techniques', 'i.e', 'Wu', 'Shu', 'Wu', 'meaning', ""'martial"", '=', 'techniques/skill', 'Shu', 'meaning', ""'art"", ""'"", 'war/fighting']",N/A
382111,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6303622836,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","Thanks to the internet, a little-known martial arts flick from 1993 gained widespread publicity as one of the most unintentionally funny things ever put to celluloid, but most people who mention ""Undefeatable"" really have no idea what they're talking about. Most folks who LOL it haven't seen a Cynthia Rothrock movie before, much less anything directed by Godfrey Ho, and can't describe anything about the movie beyond that single silly fight scene. Granted, the film doesn't exactly have universal appeal, but apprehensive fans ought to know that, for all of its flaws, ""Undefeatable"" is actually one of the more entertaining offerings from this stage of Rothrock's career.The story: when his wife leaves him, abusive and psychologically-disturbed fighter Stingray (Don Niam,Baja Run) goes on a murder spree targeting every woman who resembles his departed lady. When the sister of a notorious female gang member (Rothrock,Above the Law) becomes one of his victims, she and a righteous policeman (John Miller) scour the city's underground fighting locales to find him.The film's style is a continuation ofHonor & Glory, a previous Rothrock/Godfrey collaboration that featured many of the same cast and crew members. Believe it or not, that one outdoes ""Undefeatable"" for all-around goofiness, but both are actually among the more sound offerings of director Ho. All the people out there proclaiming this to be the worst movie ever obviously haven't looked into the man's earlier filmography, for even though this one features overacting galore, iffy production values, plenty of silly situations (e.g. a kidnapped Donna Miller tries to escape Stingray by pretending to be his mother) and a general low-budget feel, at least all of its scenes were filmed specifically for this movie and the characters' dialogue wasn't decided during post-production and implemented via voiceovers. It never had a chance at any awards, but for a Hong Kong movie co-written by someone who probably doesn't understand English (Tai Yim) and filmed in America by a Mandarin director, it really doesn't look too bad.There are ten pretty decent fights to be seen, but with the exception of the final two, they're all rather short and don't feature any established talent besides Cynthia and John Miller. Luckily, most of them are still fun to watch thanks to their indulgence in absurdity, like when Cynthia battles a fellow in football gear for money and later an eagle claw master (wearing clawed gloves, no less) on top of some barrels. Her solo faceoff against Stingray may actually be the best fight of the film: though it includes a silly slow-motion shot of a snowfall of packing peanuts, she gets to wield her favored hook swords and duel with a katana-wielding Don Niam. Niam seems like a good martial artist but his movements are too stiff to be taken seriously, and that's before his physical stuff takes a backseat to his completely overblown facial expressions and gestures. The infamous final fight between Miller, Niam, and Rothrock is an inexplicable drop in quality; I can only assume that ol' Godfrey was tired of holding back and just cut loose for the film's final five minutes, demanding that Miller and Niam scream their lungs out while pantomiming their choreography throughout the completely ludicrous finale. Miller and Niam rip their shirts off but apparently Cynthia wasn't allowed to. Shame.It's great that this movie made it to wide-release DVD; it's definitely not the most dignified vehicle to do so, but with luck, its gravitating absurdity will draw in potential new fans to everybody involved. Rest assured, Cynthia Rothrock has done better (not so much Mr. Ho), but for anybody wanting a short break from her more serious work, this one makes for a fun 90 minutes of time-wasting.",3,"""I want to warn you - this isn't going to be easy.""",1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,3793,"['Thanks', 'internet', 'little-known', 'martial', 'arts', 'flick', '1993', 'gained', 'widespread', 'publicity', 'one', 'most', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'things', 'ever', 'put', 'celluloid', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'mention', 'Undefeatable', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Most', 'folks', 'who', 'LOL', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'anything', 'directed', 'Godfrey', 'Ho', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'anything', 'movie', 'single', 'silly', 'fight', 'scene', 'Granted', 'film', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'universal', 'appeal', 'apprehensive', 'fans', 'ought', 'know', 'flaws', 'Undefeatable', 'actually', 'one', 'more', 'entertaining', 'offerings', 'stage', 'Rothrock', 'career.The', 'story', 'when', 'wife', 'abusive', 'psychologically-disturbed', 'fighter', 'Stingray', 'Don', 'Niam', 'Baja', 'Run', 'murder', 'spree', 'targeting', 'woman', 'who', 'departed', 'lady', 'When', 'sister', 'notorious', 'female', 'gang', 'member', 'Rothrock', 'Law', 'one', 'victims', 'righteous', 'policeman', 'John', 'Miller', 'scour', 'city', 'underground', 'fighting', 'locales', 'find', 'him.The', 'film', 'style', 'continuation', 'ofHonor', 'Glory', 'previous', 'Rothrock/Godfrey', 'collaboration', 'featured', 'many', 'same', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'Believe', 'not', 'one', 'Undefeatable', 'all-around', 'goofiness', 'are', 'actually', 'more', 'sound', 'offerings', 'director', 'Ho', 'people', 'there', 'proclaiming', 'be', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'man', 'earlier', 'filmography', 'even', 'one', 'overacting', 'galore', 'iffy', 'production', 'values', 'plenty', 'silly', 'situations', 'e.g', 'kidnapped', 'Donna', 'Miller', 'escape', 'Stingray', 'pretending', 'be', 'mother', 'general', 'low-budget', 'feel', 'least', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'specifically', 'movie', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'was', ""n't"", 'decided', 'post-production', 'implemented', 'voiceovers', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'awards', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'movie', 'co-written', 'someone', 'who', 'probably', ""n't"", 'understand', 'English', 'Tai', 'Yim', 'filmed', 'America', 'Mandarin', 'director', 'really', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'bad.There', 'are', 'ten', 'pretty', 'decent', 'fights', 'be', 'seen', 'exception', 'final', 'two', ""'re"", 'rather', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'feature', 'established', 'talent', 'Cynthia', 'John', 'Miller', 'Luckily', 'most', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'thanks', 'indulgence', 'absurdity', 'when', 'Cynthia', 'fellow', 'football', 'gear', 'money', 'later', 'eagle', 'claw', 'master', 'wearing', 'clawed', 'gloves', 'less', 'top', 'barrels', 'solo', 'faceoff', 'Stingray', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'best', 'fight', 'film', 'silly', 'slow-motion', 'shot', 'snowfall', 'packing', 'peanuts', 'wield', 'favored', 'hook', 'swords', 'duel', 'katana-wielding', 'Don', 'Niam', 'Niam', 'good', 'martial', 'artist', 'movements', 'are', 'too', 'stiff', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'physical', 'stuff', 'backseat', 'completely', 'overblown', 'facial', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'infamous', 'final', 'fight', 'Miller', 'Niam', 'Rothrock', 'inexplicable', 'drop', 'quality', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'ol', 'Godfrey', 'was', 'tired', 'holding', 'back', 'just', 'cut', 'loose', 'film', 'final', 'five', 'minutes', 'demanding', 'Miller', 'Niam', 'scream', 'lungs', 'out', 'pantomiming', 'choreography', 'completely', 'ludicrous', 'finale', 'Miller', 'Niam', 'rip', 'shirts', 'apparently', 'Cynthia', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'Shame.It', 'great', 'movie', 'made', 'wide-release', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'not', 'most', 'dignified', 'vehicle', 'do', 'so', 'luck', 'gravitating', 'absurdity', 'will', 'draw', 'potential', 'new', 'fans', 'everybody', 'involved', 'Rest', 'assured', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'done', 'better', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Mr.', 'Ho', 'anybody', 'wanting', 'short', 'break', 'more', 'serious', 'work', 'one', 'fun', '90', 'minutes', 'time-wasting']",N/A
382112,APIW11UEPKIC2,6303622836,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[5, 7]","Yes, this is THE Undefeatable, one of the best cheesy movies ever made.  Godfrey Ho's modern day masterpiece.  The acting is beyond horrible, and the way the actors deliver their lines is bound to cause laughter.The movie starts off with a woman talking to her psychiatrist about her abusive husband Paul.  She says Paul used to be a mechanic but has changed since he became a fighter.  He fights in death matches and thinks he is undefeatable.  Paul is nicknamed Stingray.  He gets home one day and sexually abuses his wife.  She finally leaves him and Stingray goes crazy.  He starts kidnapping any woman that has a flower dress and red hair like his wife.  The cops start to take notice after finding the women dead.  There are a lot of clues, but these cops are not the brightest people.  Ray Niam, an unknown actor to me, plays the cop that is investigating the murders.Cynthia Rothrock is a gang member who fights on the street to earn money.  She has a job as a waitress but needs the extra money to pay for her sister's college tuition.  Her sister just so happens to have red hair and wears a flower dress.  She is kidnapped and killed, and Rothrock teams up with the cop to take down the killer.The fight scenes are not too bad.  Stingray is hilarious.  He is very muscular, kind of looks like Michael Douglas, and has a crazy mullet fro thing going on.  His acting is so bad that he comes across as being mentally handicapped.  He is not believable at being scary, but he is still a lot of fun to watch.  His movements are very akward and his facial expressions had me bursting out with laughter.The first fight scene introduces Ray Niam as the cop.  This guy is a horrible actor.  He never shows any emotion, and his acting performance is actually funny because you can tell he is trying his hardest, yet he does everything wrong.  So the first fight has him taking out 2 goons who are robbing a convenience store.  This fight is pretty good, but only about 10 seconds long.  Ray Niam does some good handwork and takes out both guys quickly.Next fight has Rothrock fighting a rival gang member.  The fight itself is decent, but what is going on around the fight is much more interesting.  The audience starts clapping and stomping a concrete wall in a rhythmic beat.  Godfrey Ho really knows how to set the mood.Next fight has Stingray killing some guy and kidnapping his girlfriend.  Nothing special about this fight.  It's too short, and the actor who plays Stingray doesn't seem to know what choreography is.  He does his own thing.  There is an nice stunt at the end of the fight, but that's it.Then Rothrock has another planned fight.  She goes up against a big guy who wears football pads and charges at her like a football player.  Rothrock kicks him a few times and beats him easily.  Somehow Stingray spots the football player and his girlfriend going home from the fight with Rothrock.  The girl is wearing a flower dress and has red hair so Stingray goes over to their trailer and beats the guy up.  But he doesn't take the girl.  I think Godfrey Ho just forgot.  This fight is over quickly.  The football player is so bad he actually makes Stingray look good with a few of his punches.In the next scene Stingray sees Rothrock's sister with her red hair and flower dress.  This is one of the better fights of the movie, but too short only lasting about 30 seconds.  Stingray looks tough and there is a good stunt.Now that her sister is dead, Rothrock tries to find the killer by challenging gangs to fights.  She goes up against an eagle claw performer.  I like the idea of having the eagle claw guy wear actual claws, but the choreography is only average.The next guy Rothrock challenges is not bad.  They have a good fight but it is cut too short and turns into a bad group fight.  There are a couple good stunts but the choreography is slow.The final fight is Stingray vs the cop.  This is as bad as fight choreography gets.  These guys do not work well together.  There is no chemistry and none of their attacks look believable.  The cop is always putting his hand up to block kicks and punches before Stingray even attacks.  Midway through they decide to take off their shirts for some reason.  I guess Godfrey Ho was hoping the audience would look at the guys chests instead of the terrible fight that is going on.  So the fight is bad, but very funny.If you are a hardcore fighting fan, then this will disappoint.  If you like really cheesy movies then you will love this.  The final scene may just be the best scene in the movie.  Rothrock decides to enroll all of her gang member friends into college.  So is Rothrock going to college?  She says no, but the cop already enrolled her.
