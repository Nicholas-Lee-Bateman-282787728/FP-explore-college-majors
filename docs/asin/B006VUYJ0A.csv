As I already have that series, it was a waste of time buying this, it is just a re-release with new cover art. Next time I will wait for someone to list the episode titles so I know what I'm buying. The episodes are good, of course, but it is much cheaper to buy them as part of the complete series. Ok if you have no desire to own much Scooby or just something to keep the kids quiet..but in saying that this material is quite old,and won't keep older kids amused for long, unless they like the show.",2,"A re-release of old scooby, beware!",1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,621,"['was', 'unaware', 'DVD', 'old', 'Scooby-doo', 'episodes', '1970s', 'original', 'series', 'Scooby-doo', 'where', 'are', 'already', 'have', 'series', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'buying', 'just', 're-release', 'new', 'cover', 'art', 'Next', 'time', 'will', 'wait', 'someone', 'list', 'episode', 'so', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'buying', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'course', 'much', 'cheaper', 'buy', 'part', 'complete', 'series', 'have', 'desire', 'own', 'much', 'Scooby', 'just', 'something', 'keep', 'kids', 'quiet..but', 'saying', 'material', 'quite', 'old', 'wo', ""n't"", 'keep', 'older', 'kids', 'amused', 'long', 'like', 'show']",Scooby-Doo! and the Safari Creatures
