Naruto Shippuden reached its best arc so far, and with minimal filler interference, resulting in a memorable collection of episodes that one can feel proud of owning. However, the same cannot be said for this boxset.Containing episodes 180 to 192 (12 episodes) this set is chronologically supposed to follow the events of the Pain arc, but instead takes us back 3 years to Naruto as a twelve year old. This set contains practically 99% filler and will undoubtedly be a disappointment to fans eagerly awaiting the next slice of canon brilliance. Furthermore, these fillers offer flashbacks to events that never actually happened in Naruto part 1; which may only put off viewers who haven't seen the first part (episodes 1 - 136).  Now I don't mind original content as long as it is done well and has some thought put into it, but that isn't the case here: they're bland, boring and don't tell us anything we didn't know before; Naruto was treated dreadfully by the villages etc. Every filler that involves Naruto's character uses this form of development to death. It's a shame because fillers either portray him as an idiot or a as someone shallow - he's neither in reality, but clearly someone didn't tell the filler writers.In short, this set is pointless. If their is one redeeming feature of these episodes, then it is the use of the old soundtrack which brings back a sense of nostalgia, but really, that's it. For those who have money constraints then I advise against purchasing this set as I'd be ultimately telling you to throw your money away. Unless you are a die hard fan who cannot stand having a space in your collection, then you can safely avoid this set without any worries of missing anything that continues the story.",3,Skip if you don't like fillers.,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,1854,"['previous', 'fantasic', 'boxsets', 'was', 'clear', 'old', 'saying', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'who', 'wait', 'was', 'true', 'Naruto', 'Shippuden', 'reached', 'best', 'arc', 'so', 'far', 'minimal', 'filler', 'interference', 'resulting', 'memorable', 'collection', 'episodes', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'proud', 'owning', 'However', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'boxset.Containing', '180', '192', '12', 'episodes', 'set', 'chronologically', 'supposed', 'follow', 'events', 'Pain', 'arc', 'instead', 'back', '3', 'years', 'Naruto', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'set', 'practically', '99', '%', 'filler', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'disappointment', 'fans', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'next', 'slice', 'canon', 'brilliance', 'Furthermore', 'fillers', 'offer', 'flashbacks', 'events', 'never', 'actually', 'happened', 'Naruto', 'part', '1', 'may', 'only', 'put', 'off', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'part', '1', '136', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'original', 'content', 'as', 'long', 'done', 'well', 'thought', 'put', ""n't"", 'case', 'here', ""'re"", 'bland', 'boring', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Naruto', 'was', 'treated', 'dreadfully', 'villages', 'etc', 'Every', 'filler', 'Naruto', 'character', 'form', 'development', 'death', 'shame', 'fillers', 'portray', 'idiot', 'someone', 'shallow', 'reality', 'clearly', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'filler', 'writers.In', 'short', 'set', 'pointless', 'one', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'episodes', 'then', 'use', 'old', 'soundtrack', 'back', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'really', 'who', 'have', 'money', 'constraints', 'then', 'advise', 'purchasing', 'set', ""'d"", 'be', 'ultimately', 'telling', 'throw', 'money', 'away', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'having', 'space', 'collection', 'then', 'can', 'safely', 'avoid', 'set', 'worries', 'missing', 'anything', 'story']",N/A

There have been dramatic scenes of how these female characters feel about their crush...but never a notice from the male character.
