Aside from The Brian Wilson band the only song I truly felt was Jeff Beck's Surf Up, those notes bleed soul. Since they are all Wilson's songs no performance is truly bad oh wait Richie was awful but the rest is enjoyable enough.

1007676,A1ZOFK31NJB5K4,B000GW8RWA,Michael Thorner,"[3, 3]","This tribute wasn't as strong as the 2001 tribute held at Radio City Music Hall. Having said this, it's worth purchasing just for John Legend's mesmerizing performance of the Pet Sounds track I JUST WASN'T MADE FOR THESE TIMES. Even though Brian Wilson's band backs up Legend on this version, and the original arrangement is left more or less intact, this most excellent band does bend the arrangement ever so slightly, giving it a bit of a groove so as to cradle Legend's soulful voice and delivery. Legend obviously understands the material implicitly, which is surprising considering his youth and the fact that the material is over 40 years old. His performance showcases how timeless Brian's music can be as long as the artist understands the musical complexity and emotional directness Brian was such a genius at creating with his songs.",3,John Legend Nails It.,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,843,"['tribute', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', '2001', 'tribute', 'held', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'Having', 'said', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'just', 'John', 'Legend', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'Pet', 'Sounds', 'track', 'JUST', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'MADE', 'FOR', 'THESE', 'TIMES', 'Even', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'band', 'up', 'Legend', 'version', 'original', 'arrangement', 'left', 'more', 'less', 'intact', 'most', 'excellent', 'band', 'bend', 'arrangement', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'giving', 'bit', 'groove', 'so', 'cradle', 'Legend', 'soulful', 'voice', 'delivery', 'Legend', 'obviously', 'material', 'implicitly', 'surprising', 'considering', 'youth', 'fact', 'material', '40', 'years', 'old', 'performance', 'how', 'timeless', 'Brian', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'long', 'artist', 'musical', 'complexity', 'emotional', 'directness', 'Brian', 'was', 'such', 'genius', 'creating', 'songs']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[11, 13]","Every year the MusicCares charity division of the Grammy Foundation honors a living music legend with a ""tribute concert"". While the 2006 concert - honoring James Taylor - was issued in December, the 2005 one - honoring Brian Wilson- was just issued on DVD by Eagle Vision.  And it was worth the wait. Though the editing of this 66-minute concert makes it look like it was edited down from a cable TV broadcast it appears - from the credits - that this was produced by Eagle Vision solely for home video. It's edited tightly and we go from performer to performer, except for one speech near the end. (All the backstage talking, and background on what MusicCares does, is included as a separate 12-minute supplement).What we have here is a concert performed in front of a ""black-tie"" audience of donors at a fundraiser. So you won't see anyone from the audience yelling or standing up. This was sure a conservative audience. But it's what's captured on stage that counts. All the performers are backed by Wilson's ""Smile"" band and these musicians are great!The show starts off with the weakest performance, in my opinion, with the Red Hot Chili Peppers doing ""I Get Around"". Maybe it was because it was early in the concert but no sparks flew. By the third number, when the amazing ""twentysomething"" Jamie Cullum rips through ""Sail On Sailor"" with Fred Martin & The Levite Camp (who got the only standing ovation of the evening for their soaring gospel vocals), thinks start to boil. The most interesting pairing is Michael McDonald and Billy Preston Performing ""Don't Worry Baby"" with McDonald on vocal and piano and Preston on organ. Shelby Lynn sings ""Surfer Girl"" without changing the gender in the lyrics, which makes for an ""interesting"" arrangement. The most riveting part of the evening - other than Wilson himself performing a 3 song finale - is watching a restrained Jeff Beck pick out Wilson's vocal lines on his guitar for ""Surf's Up"" - followed by Beck playing guitar on ""Surfin' USA"" with the lead vocal from the guitarist in Wilson's band.Others on the stage include Darlene Love, the Backstreet Boys, The Barenaked Ladies (doing the only non Wilson-penned song of the evening: their song titled ""Brian Wilson""), and John Legend. Camera work is excellent, especially on Beck's solos.. This is a must DVD for Wilson fans and a great tribute to a true music legend.Steve Ramm ""Anything Phonographic""",5,"A Diverse Group Pays tribute to the ""Smile"" Guy",1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,2411,"['year', 'MusicCares', 'charity', 'division', 'Grammy', 'Foundation', 'living', 'music', 'legend', 'tribute', 'concert', '2006', 'concert', 'honoring', 'James', 'Taylor', 'was', 'issued', 'December', '2005', 'one', 'honoring', 'Brian', 'Wilson-', 'was', 'just', 'issued', 'DVD', 'Eagle', 'Vision', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'editing', '66-minute', 'concert', 'look', 'was', 'edited', 'down', 'cable', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'credits', 'was', 'produced', 'Eagle', 'Vision', 'solely', 'home', 'video', 'edited', 'tightly', 'go', 'performer', 'performer', 'one', 'speech', 'end', 'backstage', 'talking', 'background', 'what', 'MusicCares', 'included', 'separate', '12-minute', 'supplement', 'have', 'here', 'concert', 'performed', 'front', 'black-tie', 'audience', 'donors', 'fundraiser', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'audience', 'yelling', 'standing', 'up', 'was', 'sure', 'conservative', 'audience', 'what', 'captured', 'stage', 'performers', 'are', 'backed', 'Wilson', 'Smile', 'band', 'musicians', 'are', 'great', 'show', 'weakest', 'performance', 'opinion', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Peppers', 'doing', 'Get', 'Maybe', 'was', 'was', 'early', 'concert', 'sparks', 'flew', 'third', 'number', 'when', 'amazing', 'twentysomething', 'Jamie', 'Cullum', 'Sail', 'Sailor', 'Fred', 'Martin', 'Levite', 'Camp', 'who', 'got', 'only', 'standing', 'ovation', 'evening', 'soaring', 'gospel', 'vocals', 'start', 'boil', 'most', 'interesting', 'pairing', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'Billy', 'Preston', 'Performing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Worry', 'Baby', 'McDonald', 'vocal', 'piano', 'Preston', 'organ', 'Shelby', 'Lynn', 'Surfer', 'Girl', 'changing', 'gender', 'lyrics', 'interesting', 'arrangement', 'most', 'riveting', 'part', 'evening', 'other', 'Wilson', 'performing', '3', 'song', 'finale', 'watching', 'restrained', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'pick', 'out', 'Wilson', 'vocal', 'lines', 'guitar', 'Surf', 'Up', 'followed', 'Beck', 'playing', 'guitar', 'Surfin', 'USA', 'lead', 'vocal', 'guitarist', 'Wilson', 'band.Others', 'stage', 'include', 'Darlene', 'Love', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'Barenaked', 'Ladies', 'doing', 'only', 'non', 'Wilson-penned', 'song', 'evening', 'song', 'titled', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'John', 'Legend', 'Camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Beck', 'solos..', 'must', 'DVD', 'Wilson', 'fans', 'great', 'tribute', 'true', 'music', 'legend.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
