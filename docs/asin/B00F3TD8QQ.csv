Yes it could have been better, I would still love to see a movie that delved into the real attitude of punk rock but CBGB is still a fun movie.It is not all that accurate from a historical standpoint and there are some real omissions as to the bands that are shown (I would bet that copyrights had a lot to do with that...so not punk rock) but what is there is a blast.I have been a BIG fan of the DEAD BOYS since those days and still am, it is great to see them in a feature film (seeing Ron Weasly from Harry Potter as Cheetah Chrome is worth watching this by itself).

I enjoyed the movie for what it was, and being familiar with the bands and people, the Ramones, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, David Bryne, ect.

Sometimes you just have to persevere, be in the right place and the right time and take &#34;yes&#34; for an answer and in this case that is Hilly Kristal.  Kristal stated the famed CBGB club because he thought country music was going to be the next big thing.  CBGB actually stands for Country, Bluegrass & Blues and that is what Kristal had in mind for the club.What turned out instead to play were a bunch of raw punk bands and Kristal was smart enough to ride the wave and let these bands play.  Huge acts like The Talking Heads, Blondie, The Ramones and The Police got their start at CBGB and have credited Kristal with being instrumental in launching the punk scene.The movie isn't a documentary, so don't expect it to be.  It is a pretty good representation of the times and is a very entertaining movie with some great music.  I think even people who aren't fans of the punk scene would enjoy watching this movie as it's much more about the people surrounding the club and a story of Hilly Kristal who went through a couple of bankruptcies before hitting it big with the club.Overall I'd say this is a must watch for anyone that loves punk music and music in general.",5,"Great Cast, Great Acting and Great Music",1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,1311,"['Sometimes', 'force', 'so', 'strong', 'going', 'find', 'way', 'break', 'matter', 'what', 'case', 'punk', 'music', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'persevere', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'take', '34', '34', 'answer', 'case', 'Hilly', 'Kristal', 'Kristal', 'stated', 'famed', 'CBGB', 'club', 'thought', 'country', 'music', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'CBGB', 'actually', 'Country', 'Bluegrass', 'Blues', 'what', 'Kristal', 'had', 'mind', 'club.What', 'turned', 'out', 'instead', 'play', 'were', 'bunch', 'raw', 'punk', 'bands', 'Kristal', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'ride', 'wave', 'let', 'bands', 'play', 'Huge', 'acts', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'Blondie', 'Ramones', 'Police', 'got', 'start', 'CBGB', 'have', 'credited', 'Kristal', 'being', 'instrumental', 'launching', 'punk', 'scene.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'representation', 'times', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'great', 'music', 'think', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'punk', 'scene', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'people', 'surrounding', 'club', 'story', 'Hilly', 'Kristal', 'who', 'went', 'couple', 'bankruptcies', 'hitting', 'big', 'club.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'must', 'watch', 'anyone', 'punk', 'music', 'music', 'general']",N/A
1670384,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00F3TD8QQ,David Baldwin,"[0, 1]","In my neighborhood in Philly growing up most of my friends were Led Zeppelin or Yes fiends while I was a Beatles and Stones fan.  I attended Temple University in 1981 and became acquainted with suburban kids who turned me on to alternative music and taught me to think outside the box.  I never fully embraced punk but the shows were a lot of fun more than a Jethro Dull concert.  I still recall a packed Ramones concert at the now defunct Chestnut Cabaret in 1987 when I was pushed up against a speaker and my ears were ringing for days afterward.  This film captures the excitement of those times.  Far from perfect director Randall Miller's film in its own grungy ragged way works because it is a celebration of the punk ethos.  I'm amazed this film was ever made at all because with few exceptions CBGB created marginally commercial acts who barely got any airplay with the exception of college radio.  I doubt the Ramones ever cracked the Top 40 in this country but were superstars nonetheless and acknowledged as innovators by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  If I were to describe this film it would be akin to Alan Arkush's ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"" informed by the late lamented rock magazine ""Trouser Press"".  If anything see this film for Alan Rickman's heartfelt portrayal of Hilly Kristal, the visionary but good naturedly financially misguided owner of CBGB.  The closest I ever got to CBGB was the outside in 1986 and its exterior was dumpy.  This film gives you a sense of time and place and to feel what it was like to be in one of these clubs. An Oscar should go to the film's filth coordinator.  ""CBGB"" is a cult favorite in the making.  One little nitpick.  Patti Smith is shown in the film breaking Hilly's rule of singing only original material by performing a cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Because the Night"".

1670387,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00F3TD8QQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","CBGB is the hilarious true story of punk rock impresario Hillel ""Hilly"" Crystal (brilliantly portrayed by Alan Rickman), the infamous bum (but a very nice man) who opened his little hole-in-the-wall bar, named CBGB, in the bowery. It was the mid-1970s and Crystal had the idea of hosting the goofiest young bands.He ended up launching the careers of Blondie (Debbie Harry mainly), The Talking Heads, The Ramones and so on--the American Punk scene that morphed into the heady weirdness of the early 1980s. Aside from Rickman's star turn here--very major in fact for someone at Rickman's stage of life--this is an excellent music history snippet.All the stars appearing in the film are young actors beautifully matched to the roles. The girl who played Deborah Harry is stunning; the girl who played Patti Smith left me sort of reeling. In fact, that became a little sore point for me because I know one cannot sanitize the history of American Punk--but this film was just too gratuitous and gross for my taste.Mind you, I remember the music and the new young stars--as they emerged, I liked a lot of their fine music. Blondie was probably my personal favorite. That doesn't mean I want to see what a libertine Deborah Harry may or may not have been--this movie shows a bit much for my liking.I will add the most thrilling aspect for me was the cameo appearance of Rupert Grint--he of Ronald Weasley fame--as a member of some forgotten band. I have compared Grint's comic talent to Buster Keaton and I stand by that. In his brief cameo, he steals the show. Somehow this leads me right into my huge pet peeve:Why was this film presented in the ""comic book"" style? Disney made it work inSky High (Widescreen Edition). A few other times it has been sadly deployed; filmmakers need to stop doing it altogether until they can invent a fresh, transcendent approach. I really hated that about this otherwise excellent movie. The soundtrack, all original as far as I can tell, is KILLER and I'd love to own it.Something else bothered these sensitive ears (which may not even matter): Rickman seems like he hasn't been able to shake off the cadence of Severus Snape yet. Rickman always does flawless American accents, but here he has trouble reaching escape velocity from John Bull--and the velvety Snape 'sneer' is evident throughout. This happens to actors on occasion for unfathomable reasons and I hope Rickman can recover from it soon, like it was a cold or flu.Word to the wise, then: I don't think you need my warning, but this is NOT a family film and I would not encourage teens to be allowed to see it. Oh, it could have been much worse, Rickman saves the day in almost every scene, but I just don't think this is anything other than an adult film. There's no 'pornography'-type stuff, but they managed to sneak in some objectionable content.Anyway I liked it and found it very well done. So will you, if you like this manner of music, want to hear the true story of Hilly Crystal and his discovery of all this great talent, even if you are just curious to see an awesome film about American Punk's history. The music is worth it, Rickman is always worth it, and the quality of this film is excellent.For those interested in the music history, you might like the story of Boy George/Culture Club's beginnings:Worried About the Boy(see my review).",5,"Meet Hillel Crystal, who gave us American Punk rock",1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,3345,"['CBGB', 'hilarious', 'true', 'story', 'punk', 'rock', 'impresario', 'Hillel', 'Hilly', 'Crystal', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'infamous', 'bum', 'very', 'nice', 'man', 'who', 'opened', 'little', 'hole-in-the-wall', 'bar', 'named', 'CBGB', 'bowery', 'was', 'mid-1970s', 'Crystal', 'had', 'idea', 'hosting', 'goofiest', 'young', 'bands.He', 'ended', 'up', 'launching', 'careers', 'Blondie', 'Debbie', 'Harry', 'mainly', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'Ramones', 'so', 'American', 'Punk', 'scene', 'morphed', 'heady', 'weirdness', 'early', '1980s', 'Aside', 'Rickman', 'star', 'turn', 'here', 'very', 'major', 'fact', 'someone', 'Rickman', 'stage', 'life', 'excellent', 'music', 'history', 'snippet.All', 'stars', 'appearing', 'film', 'are', 'young', 'actors', 'beautifully', 'matched', 'roles', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'stunning', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'left', 'sort', 'reeling', 'fact', 'became', 'little', 'sore', 'point', 'know', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'sanitize', 'history', 'American', 'Punk', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'gratuitous', 'gross', 'taste.Mind', 'remember', 'music', 'new', 'young', 'stars', 'emerged', 'liked', 'lot', 'fine', 'music', 'Blondie', 'was', 'probably', 'personal', 'favorite', ""n't"", 'mean', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'libertine', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'bit', 'much', 'liking.I', 'will', 'add', 'most', 'thrilling', 'aspect', 'was', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ronald', 'Weasley', 'fame', 'member', 'forgotten', 'band', 'have', 'compared', 'Grint', 'comic', 'talent', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'stand', 'brief', 'cameo', 'show', 'Somehow', 'right', 'huge', 'pet', 'peeve', 'Why', 'was', 'film', 'presented', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'Disney', 'made', 'work', 'inSky', 'High', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'few', 'other', 'times', 'been', 'sadly', 'deployed', 'filmmakers', 'need', 'stop', 'doing', 'altogether', 'can', 'invent', 'fresh', 'transcendent', 'approach', 'really', 'hated', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'original', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'KILLER', ""'d"", 'love', 'own', 'it.Something', 'else', 'bothered', 'sensitive', 'ears', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'matter', 'Rickman', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'shake', 'off', 'cadence', 'Severus', 'Snape', 'yet', 'Rickman', 'always', 'flawless', 'American', 'accents', 'here', 'trouble', 'reaching', 'escape', 'velocity', 'John', 'Bull', 'velvety', 'Snape', ""'sneer"", 'evident', 'actors', 'occasion', 'unfathomable', 'reasons', 'hope', 'Rickman', 'can', 'recover', 'soon', 'was', 'cold', 'flu.Word', 'wise', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'warning', 'NOT', 'family', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'encourage', 'teens', 'be', 'allowed', 'see', 'Oh', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'Rickman', 'day', 'almost', 'scene', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'other', 'adult', 'film', ""'pornography'-type"", 'stuff', 'managed', 'sneak', 'objectionable', 'content.Anyway', 'liked', 'found', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'So', 'will', 'like', 'manner', 'music', 'want', 'hear', 'true', 'story', 'Hilly', 'Crystal', 'discovery', 'great', 'talent', 'even', 'are', 'just', 'curious', 'see', 'awesome', 'film', 'American', 'Punk', 'history', 'music', 'Rickman', 'always', 'worth', 'quality', 'film', 'excellent.For', 'interested', 'music', 'history', 'might', 'like', 'story', 'Boy', 'George/Culture', 'Club', 'beginnings', 'Worried', 'Boy', 'see', 'review']",N/A

But only one band that broke from CBGB would become the biggest commercial act of all-time from that scene... and it was and still is Blondie.  This film represents the downtown, NYC club scene well and brings you back in moments that are very hair-raising-realistic.  But, as a longtime Blondie supporter and for these producers to know Blondie and Debbie Harry's now-iconic status, it was actually painful to watch the ill-cast Malin Akerman as lead singer for Blondie.  Absolutely *nothing* about her reads ""Debbie Harry"".  Let's face it, if this film does nothing else, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that simply having blonde hair and wearing knee-high boots does not an icon make.  Malin comes across as harsh, insecure and brittle and looks nothing like the well-known sultry songstress.  The only emotion she gives is the sense of being pissed off the whole time she is on screen.  You just want to get up and phone Debbie Harry at home and say, ""Excuse me, have you seen this film?  No?  Good.  Would you mind coming over here and playing this part?""  That being said, considering Debbie Harry herself looks as young today as Malin Akerman, she probably SHOULD have played herself!  Now THERE'S a way to make this film a box office smash!  But what did it in for me was when Malin spoke in that sharp, cheezy-phony, over-the-top Brooklyn accent (she obviously didn't study Debbie's soft New Jersey voice or mannerisms at all).  I cringed.  You have to ask yourself, ""Did anybody even *attempt* to consult Blondie or Debbie Harry before this happened?""  The answer is ""No, they didn't"".  Debbie and Chris (Stein; guitarist/founder of Blondie) mentioned it recently.  So, hoping for something wonderful with this film and being left with the sense of ""How could this have happened?"", I gave my copy of CBGB away the same night I watched the film.  I would agree that Hilly Kristal, Iggy Pop and the club itself are vividly brought back to life on screen.  There were times in the film where I wanted so bad to walk in that front door again because the surroundnigs truly ring accurate.

Which leads me to CBGB, a film I wasn't sure about - I haven't always been a big fan of the punk music scene, and that's an understatement - but this was actually a fun, funny, and truly entertaining movie about the infamous New York City club that gave many (MANY) new bands (punk and otherwise) their first chance at public exposure back in the 1970s ... and about the man who started it, the flaky, cranky, foul-mouthed, yet utterly loveable Hilly Kristal (Rickman).A man of dubious talents who already has two bankruptcies under his belt, Hilly borrows money from his mother to open a club in the Bowery that will cater to the new, upcoming big trend in music: Country, Bluegrass, and Blue (which is how the club got its name, CBGB, an acronym for the music he wanted to showcase). The acts that came along, however, were more rock, hard rock, and punk oriented, but provided they played by Hilly's one rule - ALL original music, no covers or retreads of established hits - he booked acts he thought had potential (turns out, he thought MANY of them had potential). As the club gave birth to acts like The Ramones, Patti Smith, Blondie, Television, Talking Heads, Iggy Pop, The Dead Boys, The Police and more, it become THE place for underground bands wanting their voices heard to be played ... and THE place to be if you were cool, for soon Hilly's club becomes packed wall to wall with people, the club itself gaining national attention as some of its acts got signed and become superstars.But Hilly sucked as a businessman, wanting to help everyone - giving junkies work to do around the club to help them survive, letting many people in for free who couldn't pay - and as Hilly, Rickman is just incredible at playing a quirky, emotionally detached yet oh-so-generous entrepreneur who can't seem to understand he's running his own success into the ground. The film is so damned interesting (and fun!) to watch, between the music and Rickman and a fine supporting cast, as well as CBGB, the real star of the film. If you see it, stick around for the end credits, where you will get both a look at and feel for the real-like inspiration for the film, Hillly Kristal.

What it turns out to be is the launching pad for an entirely new sound for a new generation. As the legend goes punk wasn't born here but after bands such as Blondie, The Ramones, The Police and Iggy Pop punk was discovered here. I have to admit I am not a fan of punk music. I did like the Police and some songs by the bigger named artists but overall it's not one of my favorite genres. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this going in but I really ended up liking it. Alan Rickman is great in this (as always) and the story moved fast enough that there really wasn't a boring part in this at all. The actors they picked to play the bands were spot on, Malin Akerman, Rupert Grint and Kyle Gallner are all interesting choices. I really ended up liking this much more then I thought I would. Overall, this is not just a good movie about music, this is a good movie period. I give it a B+.",4,"I really ended up liking this much more then I thought I would.
