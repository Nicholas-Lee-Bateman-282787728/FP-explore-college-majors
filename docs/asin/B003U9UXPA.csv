1363206,AQQBRDQ2QJOO8,B003U9UXPA,Andrew C Wheeler,"[1, 1]","My wife and I have a running joke that there are only twenty working actors in the UK at any one time. It's not precisely true -- the real number is probably closer to thirty -- but we do seem to see a lot of small British movies, and we keep tripping over the same actors again and again. Remembering their names, though, can sometimes be more tricky.So, as we were watching it, we were thinking of WILD TARGET as a movie in which the rockstar fromLove Actuallywas a hit man, trying to killThe Young Victoria, while the red-headed kid fromHarry Pottersort-of became his apprentice, andArthur Dentwas hired byRupert Everett(we instantly remember him; dunno why) to kill the first hit man. Oh, andJudith Starkadderwas the first hit man's very supportive mother.As I've noted before, I am precisely the audience for comedies about hit men -- as previously proved byYou Kill Me,The Matador, andGrosse Pointe Blank-- so I wanted to see WILD TARGET as soon as I knew it existed. And it does what a comedy about hit men has to: it immediately gets the audience on the side of Victor Maynard (Bill Nighy) by immersing us in his world and seeing it through his eyes and his voice. So we want him to continue to succeed in his chosen career -- but that's a problem, since we also see young con artist Rose (Emily Blunt) finagle a complicated double-swap of a counterfeit Rembrandt to a not-quite-crimelord (Everett), and we'd prefer to see her succeed as well, or at least survive.Unfortunately, they can't both succeed equally, since Everett's character hires Maynard to kill Rose, which he sets off to do in his usual professional manner. But her life is so chaotic and full of unexpected events that he can't quite do it, and, through the sort of unlikely series of events that movies like this are full of, Victor ends up on the run with both Rose and a young man named Tony (Rupert Grint), with another hit man named Dixon (Martin Freeman) after him and Rose. It all ends pretty much the way it should, and goes a lot of enjoyable places along the way.WILD TARGET is fun and witty and entertaining, though there's something just slightly out-of-focus about it, particularly in Rose's characterization. (She takes risks reflexively, all of the time, just to do dangerous things, and there's no explanation or excuse or payoff for that -- she also asks every man she meets ""how much do you weight,"" which equally leads nowhere.) But, for those of us who love comedies about hit men, it's a gem, and one easy to overlook.",4,Just Shoot Them,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,2514,"['wife', 'have', 'running', 'joke', 'are', 'only', 'twenty', 'working', 'actors', 'UK', 'one', 'time', 'not', 'precisely', 'true', 'real', 'number', 'probably', 'closer', 'thirty', 'do', 'seem', 'see', 'lot', 'small', 'British', 'movies', 'keep', 'tripping', 'same', 'actors', 'again', 'again', 'Remembering', 'names', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'more', 'tricky.So', 'were', 'watching', 'were', 'thinking', 'WILD', 'TARGET', 'movie', 'rockstar', 'fromLove', 'Actuallywas', 'hit', 'man', 'trying', 'killThe', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'red-headed', 'kid', 'fromHarry', 'Pottersort-of', 'became', 'apprentice', 'andArthur', 'Dentwas', 'hired', 'byRupert', 'Everett', 'instantly', 'remember', 'dunno', 'why', 'kill', 'first', 'hit', 'man', 'Oh', 'andJudith', 'Starkadderwas', 'first', 'hit', 'man', 'very', 'supportive', 'mother.As', ""'ve"", 'noted', 'am', 'precisely', 'audience', 'comedies', 'hit', 'men', 'previously', 'proved', 'byYou', 'Kill', 'Me', 'Matador', 'andGrosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'so', 'wanted', 'see', 'WILD', 'TARGET', 'as', 'soon', 'knew', 'existed', 'what', 'comedy', 'hit', 'men', 'immediately', 'audience', 'side', 'Victor', 'Maynard', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'immersing', 'world', 'seeing', 'eyes', 'voice', 'want', 'continue', 'succeed', 'chosen', 'career', 'problem', 'also', 'see', 'young', 'con', 'artist', 'Rose', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'finagle', 'complicated', 'double-swap', 'counterfeit', 'Rembrandt', 'not-quite-crimelord', 'Everett', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'see', 'succeed', 'well', 'least', 'survive.Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'both', 'succeed', 'equally', 'Everett', 'character', 'Maynard', 'kill', 'Rose', 'do', 'usual', 'professional', 'manner', 'life', 'so', 'chaotic', 'full', 'unexpected', 'events', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'sort', 'unlikely', 'series', 'events', 'movies', 'are', 'full', 'Victor', 'up', 'run', 'Rose', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Tony', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'hit', 'man', 'named', 'Dixon', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Rose', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'should', 'lot', 'enjoyable', 'places', 'way.WILD', 'TARGET', 'fun', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'something', 'just', 'slightly', 'out-of-focus', 'particularly', 'Rose', 'characterization', 'risks', 'reflexively', 'time', 'just', 'do', 'dangerous', 'things', 'explanation', 'excuse', 'payoff', 'also', 'man', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'weight', 'equally', 'nowhere', 'who', 'love', 'comedies', 'hit', 'men', 'gem', 'one', 'easy', 'overlook']",N/A

1363216,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003U9UXPA,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[36, 38]","WILD TARGET (2009) is one of the most enjoyable, relaxing and hilarious films I have ever seen. The British have a way with this kind of black comedy that we have yet to perfect, though we try.The legendary assassin Victor Maynard (Bill Nighy in yet another cool-as-a-cucumber role of a lifetime) is reaching a midlife crisis. He falls for his latest hit, young swindler  Rose (Emily Blunt in a role that actually fits her well). As she throws him off his game initially, he begins to like her immensely.A fateful encounter in a parking garage introduces them to each other and to Tony (a sweet Rupert Grint), a bisexual pothead garage attendant who saves first the life of Rose, then Victor. They flee together, and a sort of sweet madness ensues.It is not what you'd expect, and were it not for occasional foul scenes (which we can bear with a guffaw) I'd recommend such caliber of comedy for children. Sadly, black comedy of this caliber is not for children's innocent eyes. But here I'll leave this fantastic film, for you to discover and judge.The cast is rounded out by crooked art collector Ferguson (Rupert Everett, appearing apparently because he needs the work) and the immortal Aileen Atkins as Victor's former-assassin mother and first teacher. (In a bit of a snit, she excoriates Victor for his crisis: ""A Beretta! The gun of princes! For your SEVENTH birthday!"") Also moving to me was Victor's white cat Snowy, who has the most wonderful MEOW.With all the great talent here and others whose names I'm too tired to mention, I have to say a word about Rupert Grint. Rupert's a handsome, rising star with a flair for sweetness, drama and comedic skills I have often compared to those of Buster Keaton. Sometimes I wonder if old Buster from Kansas and Rupert from Stevenage are somehow related.Rupert is the busiest of the HARRY POTTER 'children', with two excellent films under his belt already (CHERRYBOMB and DRIVING LESSONS). This, his third major film with major work to show for it, is his third film off the POTTER reservation. Here's a toast: a long and successful career for Rupert!And a long, cult-classic status for WILD TARGET ... one of the best films (for its genre) that I have ever seen.WILD TARGET is an English remake of the French film ""Cible &eacute;mouvante"" (1993) - which I am now anxious to see.

I do appreciate a bit of British humor once in a while-like how people will comment on the obvious: ""You just shot my ear off."" and the amusing yet practical response: ""Sorry-you frightened me! If you put it on ice, hospital can sew it back on..."" yet things never get too gross or fall into the realm of toilet humor.

1363222,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003U9UXPA,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","WILD TARGET is a fine example of the way British comedies are made to suceed: take a good script (this film is based on the 1993 French film ""Cible &eacute;mouvante"" by Pierre Salvadori and adapted for the English version by Lucinda Coxon), A director who knows how to pace fun with action (Jonathan Lynn), and cast it with character actors of the caliber of Bill Nighy, Emily Blunt, Rupert Grint, Rupert Everett and Eileen Atkins and the result is bound to be sophisticated farce.  It works every time!Victor Maynard (Bill Nighy) is a 54-year old professional assassin from a family of professional assassins (the matriarch is Louisa Maynard played to a fare-thee-well by Eileen Atkins) who is unmarried and therefore is leaving no heir to the heritage of his family.  Victor never misses his target - until he is paid to assassinate the kleptomaniac/con artist Rose (Emily Blunt) who is in the midst of swindling the wealthy Ferguson (Rupert Everett) with a fake Rembrandt self portrait.  Rose has her style and as Victor attempts to carry out his assignment he is thwarted by an innocent kid bystander Tony (Rupert Grint) who makes a shot Victor can't ignore - perhaps this ad is the heir apparent to Victor's solitary life.  In a series of fun twists and turns Victor is taken in by both Rose and Tony and the chase between the trio and the henchmen of Ferguson is on.  Yes, the shenanigans are  funny and the cast is terrific in tossing away hilarious lines of dialogue, but true to British form there is also a series of sidebars that are carefully written to give the story a fine sense of human interactions.

Yes, he is a little shaky and new, but it works for his character and there are some real gemstone one-liners that he delivers hilariously. Oh, and Rupert Everett, though his role is somewhat small and shallow, is as charming as ever. This film does not take itself too seriously, nor should it, as it is an awesome dark(ish) comedy that succeeds where many contemporary movies fail. I highly recommend picking it up and seeing for yourself. A+ from me.Sidenote: For all you fashion-minded folks out there, Emily Blunt's wardrobe is AMAZING in this film.",5,"Awesome, hilarious movie!

1363244,A129YBX5BVNW2,B003U9UXPA,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***I had a feeling from seeing the trailer for ""Wild Target"" that I'd enjoy it - and like many others - I was more than pleasantly surprised.Jonathan Lynn's 2009 film is a hugely enjoyable romp - a kicking little movie with a very witty and warm script. That it stars the truly scrumptious Emily Blunt is good enough for most guys - but mix in real comedic talent like Bill Nighy, Rupert Everett, Martin Freeman and Gregor Fisher - and you're going to have your funny bones tickled - a lot.What's also unexpected is the genuine (if unlikely) chemistry between Blunt and Nighy. And while the camera simply adores our Em in every scene she appears in - it's Nighy who's steals the entire film. He is just superb as the twitchy po-faced assassin Victor Maynard still unable to live without his mother and properly pleased with his lifetime of strangulations, poisonings and a good clean bullet in the head (his preferred trademark). His mad upper-crust mother Louisa has even made him a lovely newspaper-clippings memento of all these killings and put them in a scrapbook for his 52nd birthday (how thoughtful). Veteran and classy British actress Eileen Atkins gives an equally scene-stealing performance here too - a great combo with Nighy.The story goes like his - Ruby (Blunt) falsifies a rare painting, pawns it off on bad guy Rupert Everett for a cool million quid, but gets rumbled. Victor is called in to `remove' said rumbler. But of course he is completely unhinged by the lovely kleptomaniac Rose and their initial mutual loathing eventually develops into something worth fighting for. Rose doesn't need to be extinguished by Victor, but protected by him instead (even if it costs 30,000 a week to do so). And Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley from Harry Potter) is cleverly cast too as the footloose and parentless young lad Tony - who simply gets tangled up in the whole shooting match, but turns out to have natural gun-slinging capabilities - and therefore become the apprentice Victor never had. They form an unlikely trio as (slightly bumbling) professional killers pursue them (Martin Freeman and a very funny Geoff Bell).Hardly original stuff I know - but as other reviewers have said, I'd rather watch this 'again' than sit through some of the truly awful rom-com pap thrown at us these days by Hollywood. It may not be an oil painting, but it's a bloody good copy mate.Like ""Tamara Drew"" - ""Wild Target"" is a very likeable British Ealing-Comedy kind of movie - with a great cast and a very, very witty script. It's a good night in and well worth a punt. And the BLU RAY is very cheap too.I'm off now to dream of lovely Emily and put down the fact that's she's happily married as a minor inconvenience and trivial detail...BLU RAY Specifications:EXTRAS: Cast & Crew InterviewsVIDEO: High Definition 1080p 24/16.9 2.35:1 AspectAUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio English 5.1SUBTITLES: English SDH",4,"""...It's A Rembrandt!

1363245,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003U9UXPA,Mark Turner,"[3, 5]","I'm always tickled when I get the chance to watch a movie without any preconceived notions about whether it will be good or not, few expectations planned for me by either great or poor previews or if its something I've heard nothing of but watch because it arrives in the mail. Such is the case with a movie I've just found one of the funniest I've seen in ages, WILD TARGET.Bill Nighy stars as Victor Maynard, a professional hit man carrying on the family tradition of being the best in the business. No one has ever seen Maynard or witnessed him commit any murder, even his competition. He is a man who doesn't exist who gets the job done quickly, neatly and efficiently.At the same time Victor is being hounded by his mother. He's just turned 55 and has yet to have an heir to carry on the family name and business. Having been taught by his father, who will he leave all his knowledge to?Victor's latest target is a young woman named Rose (Emily Blunt) who has staged an art robbery and the sale of a forgery of a famous Rembrandt painting. Having been paid $900,000 by a wealthy art fancier named Ferguson (Rupert Everett) for the original painting, she switched it out with a copy so that the original could go back to the museum it was located in. Ferguson wasn't too happy about being swindled though so he's hired Victor to kill Rose in 24 hours.But things don't always go as planned. Victor tracks down Rose but with each attempt on her life something stops him. Be it someone stepping out from a shop or finding a man slipping into her bed, something always gets in the way. And just as he's about to get the job done in a parking garage, one of Ferguson's henchmen gets in the middle of it and Victor kills him for interfering. When the second henchman gets the drop on Victor, a young drifter named Tony (Rupert Grint) shoots him giving the trio an opportunity to vacate before they're arrested.Realizing she's in danger, Rose offers Victor $30,000 to be her bodyguard. Interested in seeing where this goes, Victor takes the job and begins to do what he does best, avoid being detected. Unfortunately Rose isn't a willing participant in the endeavor instead doing things that draw more attention to them instead of keeping them under the radar. Not a good thing to do since Ferguson has hired the second best hit man in the business to finish the job.As the story moves forward, Victor seems to think that Tony has a natural ability for firearms after having seen him shoot someone using a weapon for the first time. Realizing this, he takes Tony under his wing with promises of teaching him the trade. Although he doesn't tell him he's a killer, telling him he's a detective instead.An attraction between Rose and Victor develops through the series of events that unfold. This wayward young woman who no one has ever stood up for or protected begins to feel deep emotions for the first person who has ever done so, Victor. And in Rose, Victor sees perhaps a chance at life, something he willingly kept away from in his plastic covered home in the country, the location he chooses to protect Rose and Tony in. But eventually we know the bad guys will show up, truth will be revealed and the outcome will be unpredictable.Sounds pretty straight forward, right? Well the fact is that it isn't. In reading the synopsis one would think this is a hard core action film with plenty of bloodshed. But it isn't. Instead it's a dark comedy that ranks among some of the funniest I've ever seen. Everything from a potential witness to murder in the form of a parrot to banged up bad guys done so in the oddest ways possible fill this film with tons of laughter. Then again I have a twisted sense of humor so that helps.Nighy does a great job here as he does in nearly everything I've ever seen him in. Blunt is an attractive young actress who gives more depth than her years would make one believe. And Grint, finally doing something outside of HARRY POTTER offers a good job as a potential assistant to Nighy.The movie was much funnier than I expected it to be. I actually found myself laughing out loud a number of times. This is a movie that you could enjoy the first time around and perhaps even a second or third time. While you may not decide to buy this one, it is definitely one of the best titles around worth the money to rent.

I'm pleased to say that I thought it was a pretty good little bit of black comedy.  The premise is not exactly original:  Victor (played by Bill Nighy), a sophisticated but lonely hitman, falls in love with a woman he's been ordered to kill.  He decides to protect her instead.  Chaos and mayhem ensue.  ""Wild Target"" is given a boost out of the completely banal by Emily Blunt's performance as Rose, who comes across as someone even an uptight triggerman might fall for.What kept me from giving the movie five stars is that most of the laughs are front-loaded...the pace of the film slowed down some once they got to the country home of Victor and the birthday party scene was a bit contrived.  Another thing that worked slightly against the film was that Victor came across as so uptight and reserved, it was perhaps a bit difficult to see him and Rose as a couple.But this being said, I thought it was a fun movie and I don't feel I wasted my money buying it or my time watching it.",4,Is it a classic?

It is like a bumbling Stooges act for the middle of the film as he decides to protect her instead, while also apprenticing a hapless young man. Nighy's mom is a little over-the-top by Eileen Atkins who I last saw in the nice filmEvening, and the remaining cast is average to overly cheesy. The comedy tried to be dark as the body count goes up, but Nighy carries this overall without letting it get too slapstick.The Blu specs are solid as the picture is clear, so much so that the background failings can be obvious (can see the rain outside nearby windows when they are trying to make it look sunny, crew reflections, etc.) and the DTS is mixed nicely. The car chase scenes are where the channels get used the most and it surrounds you just right. Unfortunately though Fox once again dumps this BD with nothing extra. The ""On Target with Emily Blunt"" lasts a few minutes and is immediately forgettable.

His hobbies include learning French, chess, and encapsulating his furniture in plastic.Rose is a light fingered free spirit. She had a copy made of a Rembrandt, made a switch and double crossed a buyer. Victor is supposed to kill her, but after a few failed attempts because of her Inspector Clouseau ability to avoid a bullet, he has become an admirer of the girl and in a twist of fate becomes her protector with Ron Weasly as his apprentice.While the story was humorous, it lacked a certain uniqueness.

1363278,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B003U9UXPA,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[0, 0]","This is a British remake of a French comedy, which a lot of folk have said is much better - well originals nearly always are. I decided to judge this purely on its own merits. A lot of Brit comedy of late has been anything but funny and actually quite poor, this however has real charm and some on screen chemistry that worked for me.I think it is because of some rather good acting and a wealth of British stars. Bill Nighy plays Victor Maynard, a typically erudite, restrained sort of City gent, who earns his money by being a professional hit man.  He is hired to take out Rosie (Emily Blunt), but after a bungled attempt he sort of starts falling for her womanly charms. Rupert Grint of Harry Potter fame, plays his pot smoking, accidental side kick, and he is really good, I quite liked his character. I think it is because he does it in a nave childish way, yet is convincing. We also have Martin Freeman playing another hit man, though a lot more ruthless.Fans of Rab C. Nesbitt will be delighted that Gregor Fisher plays a hit man. I've just realised there are quite a few hit persons in this little plot. To top it all of we have Rupert Everett as a play boy nasty, and Bill Nighy's mum turns out to be part of `the family business' too, that of being hired killers.It is a pretty good romp, with non gratuitous violence and some very good performances. The plot may be a tad ridiculous, but this is a comedy, and I did laugh a number of times. The real star is Nighy and if you are a fan of his, you will not be in the least disappointed.",4,"""They can't kill me for less than a million!""",1308528000,"06 20, 2011",2011,1548,"['British', 'remake', 'French', 'comedy', 'lot', 'folk', 'have', 'said', 'much', 'better', 'well', 'originals', 'nearly', 'always', 'are', 'decided', 'judge', 'purely', 'own', 'merits', 'lot', 'Brit', 'comedy', 'late', 'been', 'anything', 'funny', 'actually', 'quite', 'poor', 'however', 'real', 'charm', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'worked', 'me.I', 'think', 'rather', 'good', 'acting', 'wealth', 'British', 'stars', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Victor', 'Maynard', 'typically', 'erudite', 'restrained', 'sort', 'City', 'gent', 'who', 'money', 'being', 'professional', 'hit', 'man', 'hired', 'take', 'out', 'Rosie', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'bungled', 'attempt', 'sort', 'starts', 'falling', 'womanly', 'charms', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'pot', 'smoking', 'accidental', 'side', 'kick', 'really', 'good', 'quite', 'liked', 'character', 'think', 'nave', 'childish', 'way', 'convincing', 'also', 'have', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'playing', 'hit', 'man', 'lot', 'more', 'ruthless.Fans', 'Rab', 'C.', 'Nesbitt', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'Gregor', 'Fisher', 'hit', 'man', ""'ve"", 'just', 'realised', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'hit', 'persons', 'little', 'plot', 'top', 'have', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'play', 'boy', 'nasty', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'mum', 'out', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'business', 'too', 'being', 'hired', 'killers.It', 'pretty', 'good', 'romp', 'non', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'tad', 'ridiculous', 'comedy', 'did', 'laugh', 'number', 'times', 'real', 'star', 'Nighy', 'are', 'fan', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'least', 'disappointed']",N/A

He also takes under his wing a young man named Tony (Rupert Grint) as an ""apprentice,"" who got involved in Victor's (attempted) killing of her. There is so much potential for a rollicking crime comedy, potential that is sadly wasted here.The film's promising premise and talented cast (including Rupert Everett) ends up being squandered because of the inept direction from Jonathan Lynn, whose comedies (""Nuns on the Run,"" ""My Cousin Vinny,"" ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and others) have been hit and miss. The players are doing their best with Bill Nighy attempting to bring deadpan humor to the script but without much success, because the film is too tame, lacking the zany energy this type of comedy, or farce, really needs.The British crime comedy is a remake of a French film ""Cible &eacute;mouvante"" starring Jean Rochefort, Marie Trintignant and Guillaume Depardieu.
