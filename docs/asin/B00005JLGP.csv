600824,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005JLGP,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","It is night. The police investigate two murders. There is a message written in blood on the wall for McCaleb. McCaleb notices red stains on one person's shoes and chases the hooded figure until he gets away. [Is he getting too old?] Two years pass, Terry is taking it easy. A visitor asks for help, Miss Rivers knows about Terry's heart operation. Gloria Torres was his heart donor. So Terry visits the police station to learn about the murder. He watches the video of the murder-robbery, then visits that liquor store. Terry uses a computer to track similar crimes. The police think the robber killed people so there would be no witnesses. Terry's doctor says he must take it easy and rest more. Terry investigates a likely suspect, who attacks him and runs away. Terry is told to stay out of police business.Terry wonders if there was a connection between the victims. He finds a connection - something was taken from each victim. But that suspect killed himself on the city line. Terry thinks the case isn't closed yet, and finds a link between the victims. Anyone who benefitted would be a suspect. Was it to harvest their organs? Comparing the time of the call leads to a shocking surprise! Who was in that dark car? But the lead turns out to be dead. Terry comes up with an explanation. [Did you get a clue from that check?]It was a good story until the dramatic revelations at the end. Terry's heart is hardened to do what needs to be done. There is a final drama on an old boat, but we know there will be a happy ending. Was this ending needlessly gruesome? Was the novel better than this film? This story was damaged by its incredible ending. The many murder victims seemed like needless overkill and made it seem like a cartoon.

600827,A1IBC9XP2LICQL,B00005JLGP,A. Wolverton,"[0, 1]","Ex-FBI agent Terry McCaleb spends most of his days onboard his boat where he's recovering from a heart transplant.  It's a quiet, restful life until Graciella Rivers steps onto McCaleb's boat.  She wants McCaleb to find the murderer of her sister Gloria.  McCaleb is uninterested until Graciella discloses one addition piece of information: the heart McCaleb received once belonged to Gloria.I really try hard not to compare movies to the novels they inspired, but in this case I watched the movie days after I finished the book.  Still, I always endeavor to give the movie a fair shake.(SPOILERS FOLLOW)  The movie is a very smart, well-crafted story throughout, and Eastwood the Director knows how to keep the audience involved without giving away too much too soon.  He also knows gives the audience credit for being smart enough to make connections without having to spell everything out for them.  (I sure wish other directors understood that audiences do not need everything explained to them.)  But I have two big problems with the film - one of character and one of casting.  Even if I had never read the book, I would still have these problems: First, Detective Arrango's role is convoluted.  Is he a true foil for McCaleb or is he onscreen for comic relief?  To me, his function in the film as an irritant for McCaleb was not believable or consistent.  One moment he jokes with McCaleb like they're buddies, the next he's in McCaleb's face.  Then he's a clown...Too many hats, too many faces.  Second, 15 minutes into the movie, I know who the killer is.  Why?  You have no big-name actor playing the villain.  You DO have a big-name actor doing very little during the first 90 minutes of the film...he has to do SOMETHING...conclusion?  He's the villain.  Way too obvious.

600828,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JLGP,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[2, 2]","This film celebrates Clint's long overdue return to the murder mystery genre. And returns he does in high style and with a true passion in ""Blood Work"", a meaningful play on words that becomes evident over the progress of the film.  Eastwood' s knowing, Oscar-winning directorial hands are firmly in evidence from the outset, and he has lovingly given us terrific cinematography of the San Diego seascapes along which much of the plot occurs.  Her Clint plays a retired FBI profiler whose last assignment was with a serial murderer who got away, and by way of the opening chase scene caused the near-fatal heart attack that puts Eastwood permanently on the sidelines. Or so it would seem, until Eastwood's character receives an unexpected gift of life by way of a heart transplant, which serves to re-energize him and gives him a new lease on life. Through a series of seeming coincidences, Eastwood becomes re-involved in the case as a private detective, and what he discovers spins the case (and his life) into automatic overdrive.What results is indeed a thinking man's mystery, carried out with excitement and a lot of intersting plot turns along the way. The script is both tight and compelling, written by the author of &quot;LA Confidential&quot;. Jeff Daniels is very good as the neighbor living two boats down from Clint's at the Marina, and given his own infirmities, Eastwood involves him in the proceedings as a designated driver. I had a strong suspicion from early on in the film based on my own personal animus against coincidences, and turned out to be pleasantly surprised with what I discovered as the plot progressed. This would be a  welcome addition to anyone's murder mystery genre collection, one that is smart, suspenseful, and entertaining.  Giving Clint's age of 72, it is unlikely there will ever be another Dirty Harry episode. In its absence, this entry satisfies the continuing hunger pains quite nicely. I recommend this as a great evening's entertainment.

Just can't get enough of that guy!InBlood Work, Eastwood plays a retired, aging FBI profiler who recently had a heart transplant. Although not completely well, he's tough, gruff and smart as a whip. When his heart donor's grieving sister (Wanda De Jesus) asks him to find her dead sibling's killer, he feels obligated to do it even if it puts his health at risk.This is a gritty, no-nonsense role and Eastwood is superb as Terry McCaleb. Jeff Daniels, who plays Eastwood's neighbor and younger sidekick, is well cast, also. Brian Helgeland, ""L.A. Confidential"" Oscar-winner, wrote a sharp, sensible script that is pure Eastwood all the way. ""Blood Work"" is adapted from a novel by Michael Connelly.Some people may chuckle at a brief love scene between Eastwood and De Jesus, but I think he will always be a sensual man, so had no problems with that. It was a realistic portrayal... But I did giggle when his real-life wife, Dina Ruiz, popped up in a scene with microphone in hand, trying to get a quote from Eastwood's character, Terry McCaleb. That was a cameo role at its best. :-)Eastwood is my favorite all-time actor, no matter what his age. The man has stamina and great box-office appeal at 72 or 22!Blood Workis an exciting thriller with edge-of-your-seat pacing, great action and an excellent cast.

600834,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00005JLGP,Bobby Underwood,"[3, 3]","Clint Eastwood embraced growing older and more fragile in this leisurely paced and thoughtful cop film. Eastwood himself has grown older and wiser, both as an actor, a producer, and a director. Even though I guessed fairly early on who the killer was and the film ran a little long, this film is about the journey. Paced much like Line of Fire, it also is about the character as much as the crimes, and that, coupled with the charisma of Eastwood, makes this a good film.Clint Eastwood is legendary FBI profiler Terry McCaleb. He is tracking a serial killer known as ""Code Killer"" when this film opens. Leaving Terry messages written in blood at each crime scene, the prey is enjoying the chase. When McCaleb finally has him within reach during a foot pursuit, Terry suffers a heart attack so massive that only a heart transplant saves his life, forcing his retirement from the Bureau. Then the killings stop.Taking the advice of his cardiologist, Bonnie (Angelica Huston), he takes life easy on his boat. Jeff Daniels is excellent as his next door pal, Buddy. Things are going smoothly in the immediate days after the transplant darkly beautiful Graciella shows up wanting the former FBI Agent to go look into the murder of her sister. Since it appears to be a random act of violence during a robbery, and Terry has severe doubts as to whether he is even up to such a task, he tries to decline. But empathy for Graciella and the son who no longer has a mother, coupled with his his attraction to her, make turning her down problematic. When he discovers the heart beating in his chest belonged to the murdered woman, honor and guilt set him on the trail once again. Buddy becomes his sidekick as he slowly gets up to speed. Terry knows he is not the same man anymore, but might be able to get part of himself back if he can survive the chase. Paul Rodriguez gives a very funny performance as exasperated L.A. Detective Arrango who thinks Terry should stay retired and out of his case.But Terry still has connections, including the pretty Tina Lifford in a nice role. It is obvious she and Terry had more than a casual relationship in the past and she gives him more leeway than she probably should in his pursuit of justice for his donor's killer. Terry begins to have feelings for Graciella and though some critics at the time found Clint's performance in the brief love scene rather stoic, his reaction, or rather lack of one, at Graciella's advances in the scene are in keeping with his condition and the fear the now fragile McCaleb has due to his recent transplant and the health complications brought on by his investigation. As his old nemisis returns and Terry discovers the reason for all the killings it complicates matters no end, both investigation wise, and in his personal life, which have become intertwined.Eastwood gives a thoughtful performance as an actor and adds some humor and good music as director to round out this entertaining film. His final exchange with Rodriguez after a somewhat lengthy chase and confrontation with the killer, end the film on a high note.

Unfortunately, that's really the very least of this picture's troubles. Though built around a somewhat interesting premise, the film's director--that being Eastwood--fails to deliver anything that is even barely watchable. Blame can also be laid at the feet of whoever wrote the creaky script, and the casting department won't being getting any props,either--it goes without saying that Eastwood is his usual wooden self, but both Paul Rodriquez and Jeff Daniels are irritating and miscast, respectively. The actresses come off a little better, with Tina Lifford as a former partner and Anjelica Huston as Eastwood's cardiologist faring best, though anyone buying the supposed attraction between Eastwood and Wanda De Jesus needs their head checked.

600841,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00005JLGP,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","Blood Work is a clever and satisfying mystery, in my opinion, with one drawback: The killer isn't all that hard to spot. On the other hand, the ""why"" of two of the killings is appalling, the police procedural aspect is interesting and it has the star quality of Clint Eastwood to power things along. More specifically, it has Eastwood taking full advantage of his age to play a retired FBI agent who has had a heart transplant, who is unwell, who keeps touching his chest in an uneasy awareness that what's there isn't his, who has to gulp pills and plot his temperature, and who often looks clammy and exhausted. At 72, this is the smart Clint Eastwood who some time ago decided to make his advancing years work for him, and not pretend to be an artificially preserved action hero.Terry McCaleb (Eastwood) was an older FBI agent on the trail of the Code Killer, a psycho serial butcher who leaves number clues next to his victims. McCaleb nearly catches him once during a hard chase through L. A.'s alleys. And then he has a heart attack. Two years later, McCaleb has retired and is living on his boat in the Long Beach marina. Beating in his chest for the last 60 days is the heart of a young woman who was murdered in a convenience store hold-up and who happened to have a rare blood type that matched McCaleb's. Her sister (Wanda de Jesus) has discovered McCaleb was the recipient and talks him into investigating the crime. He reluctantly agrees. His cardiologist (Anjelica Huston) is furious. The two detectives on the case want no part of him. His only allies are his former FBI partner and a neighbor on the next boat, a laid-back aging surfer dude (Jeff Daniels). Painstakingly, McCaleb slowly begins to find a pattern that is intensely disturbing.For me, the movie works for three reasons. First, even though through the process of elimination the killer can be fairly easily spotted after the first 40 minutes or so, the reason behind the recent killings is well disguised. I didn't catch on until just before McCaleb did. There is a certain ick quality to the killings that made it worth hoping that the killer would have a painful death. Second, Eastwood's acceptance of his age brings a lot of resonance to his recent movies, including this one. Eastwood looks his age. Although most 72-year-olds probably wish they had Eastwood's bone structure and weight, there's no disguising the turkey wattles of his neck. He doesn't try to. Third, McCaleb's concern about his health after his heart transplant is believable. I think it would take some getting used to having a donated organ in your body. I'd be constantly aware that the body's rejection could happen anytime and could be fatal. McCaleb has to haul around a carrying case full of his medications and water. He has to track his temperature for any signs of a fever. He takes a lot of pills. We're with him twice when he has to undergo a catheter inserted in a neck artery and threaded into his heart. It's uncomfortable and exhausting. McCaleb may be a smart FBI detective, but he's a man with a damaged body he has to come to terms with.As with most Eastwood movies, there is a strong woman for his character to interact with. Graciella Rivers is the sister of the woman whose heart is now beating in McCaleb's body. She's a waitress in an upscale restaurant and bar; she's taken charge of her sister's young son; and while she's concerned about McCaleb's health, she wants her sister's killer caught and punished. When a relationship slowly starts to develop between her and McCaleb, it's very much one between two adults.The climax of the movie takes place at night in a deserted, half-sunken freighter which had run aground in the middle of the Long Beach harbor. There are plenty of rusting, dark stairwells, steel doors and compartments filled with oil-slicked water. What makes the action work for me is that it is believable. There are no improbable stunts and flashy explosions, just a wounded killer and McCaleb, and McCaleb is pushing himself too hard. It takes a little assistance from Graciella to finish the killer off.The DVD transfer looks very good to me. There are few extras, including a couple of puff-piece ""How we made the movie"" features.",4,"A strong Clint Eastwood movie, where retired FBI agent Terry McCaleb must deal with his new heart and a psychotic killer",1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,4231,"['Blood', 'Work', 'clever', 'satisfying', 'mystery', 'opinion', 'one', 'drawback', 'killer', ""n't"", 'hard', 'spot', 'other', 'hand', 'why', 'two', 'killings', 'appalling', 'police', 'procedural', 'aspect', 'interesting', 'star', 'quality', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'power', 'things', 'along', 'More', 'specifically', 'Eastwood', 'taking', 'full', 'advantage', 'age', 'play', 'retired', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'had', 'heart', 'transplant', 'who', 'unwell', 'who', 'touching', 'chest', 'uneasy', 'awareness', 'what', ""n't"", 'who', 'gulp', 'pills', 'plot', 'temperature', 'who', 'often', 'clammy', 'exhausted', '72', 'smart', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'time', 'ago', 'decided', 'make', 'advancing', 'years', 'work', 'not', 'pretend', 'be', 'artificially', 'preserved', 'action', 'hero.Terry', 'McCaleb', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'older', 'FBI', 'agent', 'trail', 'Code', 'Killer', 'psycho', 'serial', 'butcher', 'who', 'number', 'clues', 'victims', 'McCaleb', 'nearly', 'once', 'hard', 'chase', 'L', 'A', 'alleys', 'then', 'heart', 'attack', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'McCaleb', 'retired', 'living', 'boat', 'Long', 'Beach', 'marina', 'Beating', 'chest', 'last', '60', 'days', 'heart', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'convenience', 'store', 'hold-up', 'who', 'happened', 'have', 'rare', 'blood', 'type', 'matched', 'McCaleb', 'sister', 'Wanda', 'de', 'Jesus', 'discovered', 'McCaleb', 'was', 'recipient', 'talks', 'investigating', 'crime', 'reluctantly', 'cardiologist', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'furious', 'two', 'detectives', 'case', 'want', 'part', 'only', 'allies', 'are', 'former', 'FBI', 'partner', 'neighbor', 'next', 'boat', 'laid-back', 'aging', 'surfer', 'dude', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Painstakingly', 'McCaleb', 'slowly', 'find', 'pattern', 'intensely', 'disturbing.For', 'movie', 'three', 'reasons', 'First', 'even', 'process', 'elimination', 'killer', 'can', 'be', 'fairly', 'easily', 'spotted', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'reason', 'recent', 'killings', 'well', 'disguised', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'just', 'McCaleb', 'did', 'certain', 'ick', 'quality', 'killings', 'made', 'worth', 'hoping', 'killer', 'would', 'have', 'painful', 'death', 'Second', 'Eastwood', 'acceptance', 'age', 'lot', 'resonance', 'recent', 'movies', 'including', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'age', 'most', '72-year-olds', 'probably', 'had', 'Eastwood', 'bone', 'structure', 'weight', 'disguising', 'turkey', 'wattles', 'neck', ""n't"", 'try', 'Third', 'McCaleb', 'concern', 'health', 'heart', 'transplant', 'believable', 'think', 'would', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'having', 'donated', 'organ', 'body', ""'d"", 'be', 'constantly', 'aware', 'body', 'rejection', 'could', 'happen', 'anytime', 'could', 'be', 'fatal', 'McCaleb', 'haul', 'around', 'carrying', 'case', 'full', 'medications', 'water', 'track', 'temperature', 'signs', 'fever', 'lot', 'pills', ""'re"", 'twice', 'when', 'undergo', 'catheter', 'inserted', 'neck', 'artery', 'threaded', 'heart', 'uncomfortable', 'exhausting', 'McCaleb', 'may', 'be', 'smart', 'FBI', 'detective', 'man', 'damaged', 'body', 'come', 'terms', 'with.As', 'most', 'Eastwood', 'movies', 'strong', 'woman', 'character', 'interact', 'Graciella', 'Rivers', 'sister', 'woman', 'heart', 'now', 'beating', 'McCaleb', 'body', 'waitress', 'upscale', 'restaurant', 'bar', 'taken', 'charge', 'sister', 'young', 'son', 'concerned', 'McCaleb', 'health', 'sister', 'killer', 'caught', 'punished', 'When', 'relationship', 'slowly', 'develop', 'McCaleb', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'two', 'adults.The', 'climax', 'movie', 'place', 'night', 'deserted', 'half-sunken', 'freighter', 'had', 'run', 'aground', 'middle', 'Long', 'Beach', 'harbor', 'are', 'plenty', 'rusting', 'dark', 'stairwells', 'steel', 'doors', 'compartments', 'filled', 'oil-slicked', 'water', 'What', 'action', 'work', 'believable', 'are', 'improbable', 'stunts', 'flashy', 'explosions', 'just', 'wounded', 'killer', 'McCaleb', 'McCaleb', 'pushing', 'too', 'hard', 'little', 'assistance', 'Graciella', 'finish', 'killer', 'off.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'including', 'couple', 'puff-piece', 'How', 'made', 'movie', 'features']",Blood Work
600842,AQVBOVE8P7K3J,B00005JLGP,Condor Libros,"[0, 2]","Even great directors can have their lesser work, and ""Blood Work"" is one of Eastwood's.  This one had the misfortune of being released not too long before Eastwood's late career renaissance - that string of extraordinarily strong, thematically and artistically ambitious films that included ""Mystic River,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" - and this film's lesser status became even more obvious in its wake.""Blood Work"" is a modestly scaled genre picture - modest both in scope and in structure.  And even by the modest standards of the crime thriller, I have to admit that the plot of ""Blood Work"" is pretty standard, predictable stuff.  (Dollars to donuts that you'll have the culprit figured by the half-hour mark, if not before.)Because of that, it would be easy to beat up on this picture, and to call its scripting a little lazy. (Others already have.) Were Eastwood a flashier director, he might have been able to use that flash to distract from the thin, somewhat contrived plot.  But Eastwood is - and always has been - a classical director, seemingly averse to razzle dazzle editing or camerawork, and so the mechanics of the plot become clear from the early going.(And I use neither of those aforementioned terms - ""flash"" and ""classical"" - as a criticism.  In the right hands, both ""flashy"" and ""classical"" direction can have serious pleasures.)Despite its predictability, however, ""Blood Work"" has its upsides.  There's a surprisingly easy going vibe to this picture, and to the performances. Yes, Eastwood is again playing a variation on the persona he's played for much of his career, but hey - he does it well, no?  And he has genuine chemistry with Wanda de Jesus.  These performers make their parts seem like real people whose plot dictated challenges don't strictly seem like plot elements.  There's a lived in quality to these characters, and to the performances, that could only have been conveyed by a veteran director and a seasoned cast of old pros. (Anjelica Huston, Jeff Daniels, and veteran character actor Dylan Walsh all make appearances.)  Indeed, this is one of Eastwood's strengths as a director - he often remembers to utilize old pros as an integral part of his pictures.So yes, ""Blood Work"" ain't Eastwood's best work.  It's a (very) modest genre picture.  But it is at the very least honest about its genre origins, and it remains quite watchable despite its predictability.  And hey, that's more than most pictures can lay claim too.* Curiously enough, even with its deficiencies I enjoy this one more than some of Eastwood's most recent work (""Changeling,"" ""Invictus,"" ""Hereafter,"" ""J. Edgar"").  These last four films may be ambitious, but they're not especially succesful or engaging.

And though he does turn in an above average performance, it doesn't really save this movie from a quick trip from the new release wall to the discount rack.The plot's intriguing enough; I won't waste space on it here since  it's in the Editorial Review.  The twists and turns lead character Terry McCaleb takes to find the killer make the pace of the film enjoyable, and the climax forced a double-take from me.The acting, for the most part, I found a bit stiff, and the flow of the scenes throughout said little more than ""book adaptation"".  I couldn't help but think as the film progressed of how much better Michael Connelly's story likely is in print.  A couple of scenes had me literally rolling my eyes, especially the love scene. It probably fits somehow in the book, but in the film it just seemed placed there in an attempt to hold my interest.  Another was the ending itself; although I didn't see it coming, it was very undramatic and drew just an ""Oh."" from me rather than a ""Wow!""The cameos were appealing; comedian Paul Rodriguez plays a surprisingly grating homicide detective and rival to McCaleb, and Anjelica Huston does well as McCaleb's cardiologist.Overall, this movie, while an average adaptation, does little more than stir interest to read the actual novel, which is likely a wonderful psychological thriller.",3,Makes me want to read the book.,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,1445,"['really', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'bought', 'movie', 'well', 'fact', 'was', 'cheap', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'turn', 'above', 'average', 'performance', ""n't"", 'really', 'save', 'movie', 'quick', 'trip', 'new', 'release', 'wall', 'discount', 'rack.The', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'space', 'here', 'Editorial', 'Review', 'twists', 'lead', 'character', 'Terry', 'McCaleb', 'find', 'killer', 'make', 'pace', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'climax', 'forced', 'double-take', 'me.The', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'found', 'bit', 'stiff', 'flow', 'scenes', 'said', 'little', 'more', 'book', 'adaptation', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'film', 'progressed', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'story', 'likely', 'print', 'couple', 'scenes', 'had', 'literally', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'especially', 'love', 'scene', 'probably', 'somehow', 'book', 'film', 'just', 'seemed', 'placed', 'there', 'attempt', 'hold', 'interest', 'was', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'was', 'very', 'undramatic', 'drew', 'just', 'Oh', 'rather', 'Wow', 'cameos', 'were', 'appealing', 'comedian', 'Paul', 'Rodriguez', 'surprisingly', 'grating', 'homicide', 'detective', 'rival', 'McCaleb', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'well', 'McCaleb', 'cardiologist.Overall', 'movie', 'average', 'adaptation', 'little', 'more', 'stir', 'interest', 'read', 'actual', 'novel', 'likely', 'wonderful', 'psychological', 'thriller']",Blood Work

Director/star Eastwood uses his age to good advantage here, playing a man who is so concerned about his health that he doesn't even want to drive himself around town.  Nevertheless, his mind is as sharp as ever.  Although the pace of the film is deliberate, I was intrigued by the mystery and surprised by the key observation toward the end of the film that provided the key to finding the killer.A couple relatively minor but still annoying points marred my enjoyment of this fine film.  There is some over-the-top gunplay in the middle of the story that seemed to belong in another movie.  Also, although the romance between DeJesus and Eastwood was tender and very well acted, its just a little bit creepy to see men in their seventies hooking up with women who are young enough to be their own granddaughters.

Terry McCaleb has had a hard life because of the frustration of letting the killer slip through his hands due to the heart ailment that he suffered just as he was about to catch him. Even more daunting is that the victims' blood matches McCaleb's and he in fact got a heart transplant from one of the murder victims but defies the health effects of his heart transplant to bring down the killer before he strikes again.This movie is a really good thriller for the most part but the movie does have it's share of flaws like even a lot of positive reviews have emphasized. One of the is that the acting by the entire cast, while decent, does from time to time, drift off in all directions. However my favorite one was actor Paul Rodriguez. While he doesn't have a whole lot of acting time on this film, he is so funny as the hot-tempered chief who has had a long standing semi-rivalry with McCaleb. Seeing his character go ballistic all the time is so funny and to be honest, besides Clint Eastwood, Paul Rodriguez really is the shining star for me.""Blood Work"" is also marred somewhat by a slow moving storyline and it drags on in places and as a result it's sometimes hard to watch the movie without sitting still or getting bored but it does pick back up before you would fall asleep. One lovemaking scene between Gracielle Rivers(Wanda De Jesus) and McCaleb was somewhat iffy in my opinion due to their age differences and it felt cold to me.However, The idea of the killer targeting individuals with the same blood type is in my opinion quite original and keeps this movie from being totally predictable. This is not an essential movie by any stretch of the imagination but for those who like shows like ""CSI"" as well as ""CSI: Miami"", then this film is worth a look or two.

Oh sure, there is no doubt that John Wayne reigned supreme, even in our minds, but Clint's portrayals were more sinister.  Then there were the Dirty Harry films - this was the thinking man's Arnold Schwarzenegger - he didn't need muscles to take out a man - just that enormous pistol and his gravelly retorts.In fact, Arny should thank Clint for a career, because without Dirty Harry, I doubt there would have been any of Arny's characters in film.Eastwood has certainly had a few misfires:  Any Which Way They Can (?) and as a director: Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.With Blood Work, Eastwood shows us he's not only got the goods as an actor but as a director too.Based on a good novel, Eastwood had good source material. (However, if my recollection is good, the story line is slightly adjusted in this film).  Terry McCaleb is a FBI profiler on the trail of a serial killer.  He physically ""makes"" the guy, but doesn't see his face.  He chases him down and even manages to shoot the SOB while he has a serious heart attack.Flash forward two years and Terry is recovering from a heart transplant that has put him out of commission for a while.  Suddenly, a beautiful hispanic woman shows up at his door with information that her sister's heart resides in his chest after she was executed during a convenience store hold-up.Guilt and curiosity compel Terry to investigate further.

600862,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JLGP,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This is a real good thriller because it is entirely logical. A serial killer follows a certain logic, a logic that becomes certain little by little for us, as it does for the police provided the police does not decide that the first approach is the only one possible. The film shows very well that the logic of the killer has to be reconstructed through a trial and failure procedure. In this case it is determined by the game of cat and mouse the killer is playing with the cop he has more or less chosen as his ""partner"", if we can call that pair work partnership. But in fact it is and the cop as much as the killer need each other to exist. That is what's vicious about this film. The cop needs the killer without whom he does not exist at all. And that's why it is so difficult for him to kill the killer at the end because they have become intimate. But yet the thriller is not as intense as it could have been because Eastwood avoid the gross part of serial killing and the crime scenes are never that dirty, that disgusting, that heavily shown, and since we are in a film we know the solution will come and we are only trying to follow the track that leads to the killer, along with the cop. In this case the signature was given from the very start though the police thought it was a code. It was not. It was a riddle revealing the name of the killer, and it took an eight year old boy to see it and the cop took quite a few or a couple of days before realizing what was so obvious right under his eyes. And then he discovers that the killer had also foreseen this epiphanic moment and was ready, very well prepared for the final fight, though he had maybe over-estimated the gratefulness of the cop for having provided him with a life in a way; or in fact in two ways, but you will have to discover how. And that is maybe this slower dimension of the film that makes it more human and less gory like so many about serial killers. More a reflection about life, and death, and a sad picture of the hatred and rivalry that poison the police bodies and agencies and work in Los Angeles, even if we know that it is not the exclusive characteristic of Los Angeles, far from it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",4,Slightly too logically slow,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,2295,"['real', 'good', 'thriller', 'entirely', 'logical', 'serial', 'killer', 'certain', 'logic', 'logic', 'certain', 'little', 'little', 'police', 'provided', 'police', 'not', 'decide', 'first', 'approach', 'only', 'one', 'possible', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'logic', 'killer', 'be', 'reconstructed', 'trial', 'failure', 'procedure', 'case', 'determined', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'killer', 'playing', 'cop', 'more', 'less', 'chosen', 'partner', 'can', 'call', 'pair', 'work', 'partnership', 'fact', 'cop', 'as', 'much', 'killer', 'need', 'other', 'exist', 'what', 'vicious', 'film', 'cop', 'killer', 'whom', 'not', 'exist', 'why', 'so', 'difficult', 'kill', 'killer', 'end', 'have', 'become', 'intimate', 'yet', 'thriller', 'not', 'as', 'intense', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'because', 'Eastwood', 'gross', 'part', 'serial', 'killing', 'crime', 'scenes', 'are', 'never', 'dirty', 'disgusting', 'heavily', 'shown', 'are', 'film', 'know', 'solution', 'will', 'come', 'are', 'only', 'trying', 'follow', 'track', 'killer', 'cop', 'case', 'signature', 'was', 'given', 'very', 'start', 'police', 'thought', 'was', 'code', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'riddle', 'revealing', 'name', 'killer', 'took', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'see', 'cop', 'took', 'quite', 'few', 'couple', 'days', 'realizing', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'right', 'eyes', 'then', 'killer', 'had', 'also', 'foreseen', 'epiphanic', 'moment', 'was', 'ready', 'very', 'well', 'prepared', 'final', 'fight', 'had', 'maybe', 'over-estimated', 'gratefulness', 'cop', 'having', 'provided', 'life', 'way', 'fact', 'two', 'ways', 'will', 'have', 'discover', 'how', 'maybe', 'slower', 'dimension', 'film', 'more', 'human', 'less', 'gory', 'so', 'many', 'serial', 'killers', 'More', 'reflection', 'life', 'death', 'sad', 'picture', 'hatred', 'rivalry', 'police', 'bodies', 'agencies', 'work', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'even', 'know', 'not', 'exclusive', 'characteristic', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'far', 'it.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",Blood Work

Produced, directed, and starring Clint Eastwood, it also features Jeff Daniels and Anjelica Huston.It starts with Connelly's FBI profiler Terry McCaleb at a crime scene where he sees a message meant for him taunting him. In the crowd he spots the killer and runs after him. The exertion causes McCaleb to have a heart attack, but he has a chance to fire off some rounds at the murderer.Two years later, Terry, the recipient of a heart transplant, is visited by his murdered donor's sister, Graciela, who wants him to find her sister's killer which he feels obligated to do. To him, ""Murder is evil, a hateful thing.""Not having a ""ticket,"" a private investigator's license he has to use his wiles and his connections in police departments to investigate the case. The sister was killed in a convenience store robbery that was caught on tape. The murder leads to another related killing at an ATM machine also caught on tape. Suspects turn up, but they, too, end up murdered. Also, inexplicably McCaleb is being followed.The viewer's credulity gets sorely tested by some of the incidents as McCaleb follows up leads. Instead of following Connelly's plot, the screenwriter dreams up a melodramatic and incredible ending that even moviegoers, not knowing the book's plot, are going to find difficult to swallow.The murderer would have to be a wonder worker to get around the way he does and get away with all the shenanigans that go on in the last third of the movie.Mr. Eastwood, if you're going to choose the work of one of America's top crime writers, try to stick to his superior plotting and brainier twists and turns.

It has a pulp novelist's crux and the kind that can work in a movie if the right things happen, but screenwriter Hegeland couldn't make the magic that he did with L.A. Confidential.  Most disappointing is the same uneven nature that has made Eastwood's directing career more uneven than his acting one.  I think Eastwood's strength is that he sees the world from a heroic perspective, and he makes a great hero for that genre.  He can even be great when he plays against that type in movies like Unforgiven.  For years I have tried to figure out why his movies can be so uneven and I think it is the way he directs actors.  When he has a top notch cast like in Unforgiven or Midnight in Garden of Good and Evil, he really pulls off something special.  But the actors playing the modern day scenes in Bridges of Madison County were so bad that it killed an otherwise beautifully directed film.  Here's Eastwood with mediocre material like Bridges and he and Meryl Streep are just genius, but the grown kids are horrid.  The same thing happens in BLOOD WORK.  Jeff Daniels is his usual underrated, but comic Paul Rodriguez is so inconsistent in his emotions and behavior that he renders his own character unrealistic.  The lessor known actors also have a way of playing as if they are just in a movie.  Clint, though, is his usual genius on screen as he continues to prove to be one of the ten greatest actors in film history.

McCaleb at first demurs, but then has a change of heart, so to speak, when he learns that the dead woman was the donor of his new ticker.The best part of BLOOD WORK, also directed and produced by Eastwood, is watching Clint depict the aging, debilitated and physically vulnerable McCabe, who can perhaps be viewed as a composite of all the other heroes played by Clint over the decades, only older.  Eastwood, possibly mindful of his own mortality, is perhaps acknowledging time's inexorable march through Terry's persona. Beyond that, the film had its uneven moments. Paul Rodriguez plays Detective Arrango, a Latino LAPD cop so gratuitously buffoonish and unpleasant that I'm surprised the Brotherhood of Latino Law Enforcement Officers isn't suing. Anjelica Huston overacts her role as McCabe's cardiologist, Dr. Bonnie Fox, who's snappishly unsympathetic to Terry's desire to see justice done for the woman whose heart keeps him alive. Moreover, McCabe early on hypothesizes an unknown circumstantial link between Graciela's sister and another man murdered by (apparently) the same killer. Though Terry is proven right, of course, the evidence for this premature conclusion was decidedly unclear to this viewer at the time. Additionally, it was never explained how the killer got access to crucial blood type records, and this was a major loose end in my book since such data isn't in the public domain. On the other hand, Jeff Daniels does a swell job as Buddy, McCabe's neighbor in the next boat slip. Buddy, an affable but unemployed and self-professed loser, supplements monetary support from his father by acting as Terry's driver during the latter's investigations.BLOOD WORK has a plot gimmick that eventually leads to a satisfying ending involving McCabe, Graciella and the Bad Guy.  Despite its flaws, I liked this film a lot simply because Eastwood will always be my all-time favorite cinematic Tough Guy.",4,Forty-three years older,1030233600,"08 25, 2002",2002,2855,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'fans', 'who', 'remember', 'young', 'headstrong', 'Rowdy', 'TV', 'series', 'RAWHIDE', '1959-1966', 'going', 'see', 'latest', 'Eastwood', 'Big', 'Screen', 'epic', 'sobering', 'reminder', 'time', 'up', 'all.In', 'BLOOD', 'WORK', 'Clint', 'Terry', 'McCaleb', 'high', 'profile', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'severe', 'heart', 'attack', 'chasing', 'foot', 'vicious', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'taunting', 'messages', 'McCaleb', 'crime', 'scene', 'Terry', 'climbing', 'over', 'fences', 'just', ""n't"", 'easy', 'used', 'be', 'then', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'old', 'days', 'would', ""'ve"", 'just', 'stood', 'back', 'shot', 'perp', 'down', 'long', 'range', '.44', 'Magnum', 'Oh', 'well', 'case', 'now', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Terry', 'just', 'off', 'heart', 'transplant', 'retired', 'boat', 'Graciella', 'Wanda', 'De', 'Jesus', 'up', 'request', 'McCaleb', 'get', 'back', 'harness', 'investigate', 'death', 'sister', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'convenience', 'store', 'holdup', 'McCaleb', 'first', 'demurs', 'then', 'change', 'heart', 'so', 'speak', 'when', 'dead', 'woman', 'was', 'donor', 'new', 'ticker.The', 'best', 'part', 'BLOOD', 'WORK', 'also', 'directed', 'produced', 'Eastwood', 'watching', 'Clint', 'depict', 'aging', 'debilitated', 'physically', 'vulnerable', 'McCabe', 'who', 'can', 'perhaps', 'be', 'viewed', 'composite', 'other', 'heroes', 'played', 'Clint', 'decades', 'only', 'older', 'Eastwood', 'possibly', 'mindful', 'own', 'mortality', 'perhaps', 'acknowledging', 'time', 'inexorable', 'march', 'Terry', 'persona', 'Beyond', 'film', 'had', 'uneven', 'moments', 'Paul', 'Rodriguez', 'Detective', 'Arrango', 'Latino', 'LAPD', 'cop', 'so', 'gratuitously', 'buffoonish', 'unpleasant', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Brotherhood', 'Latino', 'Law', 'Enforcement', 'Officers', ""n't"", 'suing', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'role', 'McCabe', 'cardiologist', 'Dr.', 'Bonnie', 'Fox', 'who', 'snappishly', 'unsympathetic', 'Terry', 'desire', 'see', 'justice', 'done', 'woman', 'heart', 'alive', 'Moreover', 'McCabe', 'early', 'hypothesizes', 'unknown', 'circumstantial', 'link', 'Graciela', 'sister', 'man', 'murdered', 'apparently', 'same', 'killer', 'Terry', 'proven', 'right', 'course', 'evidence', 'premature', 'conclusion', 'was', 'decidedly', 'unclear', 'viewer', 'time', 'Additionally', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'how', 'killer', 'got', 'access', 'crucial', 'blood', 'type', 'records', 'was', 'major', 'loose', 'end', 'book', 'such', 'data', ""n't"", 'public', 'domain', 'other', 'hand', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'swell', 'job', 'Buddy', 'McCabe', 'neighbor', 'next', 'boat', 'slip', 'Buddy', 'affable', 'unemployed', 'self-professed', 'loser', 'supplements', 'monetary', 'support', 'father', 'acting', 'Terry', 'driver', 'latter', 'investigations.BLOOD', 'WORK', 'plot', 'gimmick', 'eventually', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'involving', 'McCabe', 'Graciella', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'flaws', 'liked', 'film', 'lot', 'simply', 'Eastwood', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'cinematic', 'Tough', 'Guy']",Blood Work
600869,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B00005JLGP,Junglies,"[1, 1]","Let me preface my review by an admission. I like the work that Clint Eastwood does and have done ever since I first saw Rawhide so I am, to some extent, biased.However, before seeing this movie today, my thoughts upon seeing the trailer on TV were that this was like a Dirty Harry movie. As the beginning of the movie proceeded I could see that there were obvious parallels and indeed it occurred to me that at one stage the movie was intended to lay the ghost of Dirty Harry to rest. There have been many calls for Clint to reprise the role despite his advancing years and I think that this is a clear message that there will be no more.In many ways this is the antithetical movie to a Dirty Harry - it is slower paced, gory in a different sort of way, set in anonymous Los Angeles rather than San Francisco, making fun out of some of the situations such as having a partner in the way of the Enforcer.The plot is quite a clever one but does not take a reasonable member of the audience long to figure out. It has a plausible love interest as well as engaging dialogue and some great character interactions. As always with his movies the production and direction are crisp and sharp. The score sounds remarkably like the Lalo Schiffrin scores of DH but they are not.This is an enjoyable outing by Clint Eastwood and while it may not be the blockbuster audience attractor of the year it is a good solid tale with more than a modicum of good acting and storytelling which makes it good value for money as a cinema outing.One of the best remarks I heard about this was that Clint Eastwood does not mind appearing as a character of about his own age. That is clearly true but as the old adage says you are only as young as you feel, With this movie Clint shows that he is still feeling a lot younger than his physical age which means that there are plenty more of good movies to come from him yet.This is good solid entertainment from one of America's best known and loved Hollywood icons.

Still a strong presence on screen, Eastwood has proven an even greater presence behind the camera.

600874,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLGP,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","I would expect a wide range of responses to ""Blood Work,"" with the key factor being at what point in the proceedings you went from being behind in figuring out what was going on to getting way ahead of the game.  Once again Clint Eastwood is working in front and behind the camera, playing Terry McCaleb, who is an F.B.I. Profiler working on the case of the Code Killer.  Literally on the heels of the serial killer, McCaleb suffers a massive heart attack, but still manages to put a bullet in the fleeing suspect.  We then jump ahead two years to a point where McCaleb is retired and ending his second month with a new heart.  Then Graciella Rivers (Wanda De Jes's) shows up at boat and says she wants him to investigate the murder of her sister.  McCaleb declines, since he is retired from the force and recovering from a heart transplant, but Graciella trumps his objections by telling him that it is her sister's heart that is now beating in his chest.  McCaleb feels obligated to investigate, even though it means stepping on the toes of the local cops (Paul Rodriguez and Dyaln Walsh as the unfriendly cops and Jaye Winston as the helpful one).McCaleb is not well; we know this because everybody constantly tells him and his doctor (Anjelica Huston) has a fit every time he even spends time thinking hard.  But McCaleb has a debt to repay, and as he investigates the murder he, of course, uncovers things that none of the other cops are picking up on.  I know exactly what I want to say about this type of thriller, but even announcing in general terms what is happening here would give the game away.  I caught on about five minutes before McCaleb did and while I liked the revelation of what exactly had been done and why, I have to admit the film is all downhill by that point.  From there on ""Blood Work"" is less about McCaleb using his brains and more being able to do what needs to be done to bring down the villain before he needs another heart transplant.Clint Eastwood is in his seventies now and is deservedly up for an Oscar nomination for his work as director on ""Mystic River.""  I have much less of a sense of Eastwood the director on this 2002 film, but mainly because Eastwood the actor is more noticeable.  When you look back on the films in which Eastwood has acted in the past few years (""Space Cowboys,"" ""True Crime,"" ""Absolute Power"") it becomes clear that that he is cognizant of his age and consciously making films suitable to a man his age.  That is not meant as a slight, because most actors his age are not still running around at all, let alone as leading men in theatrical films.The only persons that come to mind from my lifetime would be Spencer Tracy, who was 67 when he died after making ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" and John Wayne, whose last film, ""The Shootist,"" was really the only one that showed him as a figure in decline before his death at the age of 72.  You would think the better comparison would be to Wayne, given Eastwood's history with the western, but it was Tracy who had four Oscar nominated performances in his last decade, playing older men (add ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" ""Inherit the Wind"" and ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" to the aforementioned film).  Eastwood has only received one acting nomination, for ""Unforgiven,"" yet he is carving out a body of work as an older leading man.  Paul Newman has been doing mostly supporting roles since he finally won his long-overdue Oscar.  Only Clint Eastwood has really been making a lot of movies, a list to which ""Blood Work"" gets added, about an old guy trying to hang on to his Alpha-male role.Final Note After the Fact: I went to hear Jeff Daniels in concert this week (August 2006).  Apparently he spends his spare time driving around in a camper and performing at small venues where he plays his guitar and sings songs.  One of his songs is ""The Dirty Harry Blues,"" which is about his experiences making this film and working with Clint Eastwood, which is why I am watched it again tonight.  The song is better than the movie, but that is more a tribute to Daniels' songwriting, singing and guitar playing than a knock on the film.",4,"Okay, how long will it take you to figure this one out?",1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,4139,"['would', 'expect', 'wide', 'range', 'responses', 'Blood', 'Work', 'key', 'factor', 'being', 'what', 'point', 'proceedings', 'went', 'being', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'getting', 'way', 'ahead', 'game', 'Once', 'again', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'working', 'front', 'camera', 'playing', 'Terry', 'McCaleb', 'who', 'F.B.I', 'Profiler', 'working', 'case', 'Code', 'Killer', 'Literally', 'heels', 'serial', 'killer', 'McCaleb', 'massive', 'heart', 'attack', 'still', 'put', 'bullet', 'fleeing', 'suspect', 'then', 'jump', 'ahead', 'two', 'years', 'point', 'where', 'McCaleb', 'retired', 'ending', 'second', 'month', 'new', 'heart', 'Then', 'Graciella', 'Rivers', 'Wanda', 'De', 'Jes', 'up', 'boat', 'investigate', 'murder', 'sister', 'McCaleb', 'retired', 'force', 'recovering', 'heart', 'transplant', 'Graciella', 'trumps', 'objections', 'telling', 'sister', 'heart', 'now', 'beating', 'chest', 'McCaleb', 'feels', 'obligated', 'investigate', 'even', 'stepping', 'toes', 'local', 'cops', 'Paul', 'Rodriguez', 'Dyaln', 'Walsh', 'unfriendly', 'cops', 'Jaye', 'Winston', 'helpful', 'one', '.McCaleb', 'not', 'well', 'know', 'everybody', 'constantly', 'doctor', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'fit', 'time', 'even', 'time', 'thinking', 'hard', 'McCaleb', 'debt', 'repay', 'murder', 'course', 'uncovers', 'things', 'none', 'other', 'cops', 'are', 'picking', 'up', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'say', 'type', 'thriller', 'even', 'announcing', 'general', 'terms', 'what', 'happening', 'here', 'would', 'give', 'game', 'away', 'caught', 'five', 'minutes', 'McCaleb', 'did', 'liked', 'revelation', 'what', 'exactly', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'why', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'downhill', 'point', 'there', 'Blood', 'Work', 'less', 'McCaleb', 'using', 'brains', 'more', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'bring', 'down', 'villain', 'heart', 'transplant.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'seventies', 'now', 'deservedly', 'up', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'work', 'director', 'Mystic', 'River', 'have', 'much', 'less', 'sense', 'Eastwood', 'director', '2002', 'film', 'mainly', 'Eastwood', 'actor', 'more', 'noticeable', 'When', 'look', 'back', 'films', 'Eastwood', 'acted', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Space', 'Cowboys', 'True', 'Crime', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'clear', 'cognizant', 'age', 'consciously', 'making', 'films', 'suitable', 'man', 'age', 'not', 'meant', 'slight', 'most', 'actors', 'age', 'are', 'not', 'still', 'running', 'around', 'let', 'alone', 'leading', 'men', 'theatrical', 'films.The', 'only', 'come', 'mind', 'lifetime', 'would', 'be', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'who', 'was', '67', 'when', 'died', 'making', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'John', 'Wayne', 'last', 'film', 'Shootist', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'showed', 'figure', 'decline', 'death', 'age', '72', 'would', 'think', 'better', 'comparison', 'would', 'be', 'Wayne', 'given', 'Eastwood', 'history', 'western', 'was', 'Tracy', 'who', 'had', 'four', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performances', 'last', 'decade', 'playing', 'older', 'men', 'add', 'Old', 'Man', 'Sea', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'aforementioned', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'only', 'received', 'one', 'acting', 'nomination', 'Unforgiven', 'yet', 'carving', 'out', 'body', 'work', 'older', 'leading', 'man', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'been', 'doing', 'mostly', 'supporting', 'roles', 'finally', 'won', 'long-overdue', 'Oscar', 'Only', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'really', 'been', 'making', 'lot', 'movies', 'list', 'Blood', 'Work', 'added', 'old', 'guy', 'trying', 'hang', 'Alpha-male', 'role.Final', 'Note', 'Fact', 'went', 'hear', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'concert', 'week', 'August', '2006', 'Apparently', 'spare', 'time', 'driving', 'around', 'camper', 'performing', 'small', 'venues', 'where', 'guitar', 'sings', 'songs', 'One', 'songs', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Blues', 'experiences', 'making', 'film', 'working', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'why', 'am', 'watched', 'again', 'tonight', 'song', 'better', 'movie', 'more', 'tribute', 'Daniels', 'songwriting', 'singing', 'guitar', 'playing', 'knock', 'film']",Blood Work

He's over 70 years old now and, instead of making believe that this is not happening, he finds roles that try to show its reality.  I applaud him for this.  Blood Work is a good film.Eastwood is cast as an FBI profiler nearing retirement who's being taunted by someone known as the &quot;code killer&quot;.  After a chase, he suffers a heart attack and the killer gets away.  Fast forward two years.  He's now the recipient of a heart transplant, and his cardiologist, played by Anjelica Houston, is telling him to take it easy.  Ha!  You and I know right there that he's going to be swept into some sort of new police work.  Well -- it sure is wild.  It seems the young woman whose heart he has received in the transplant was murdered.  And her sister, played by Wanda De Jesus, is begging him find the killer.  Naturally, he now has to use all his years of wisdom to investigate.What follows is a fast paced police procedural drama to which he is personally connected.  There are lots of clues and a few false leads and some startling twists and turns of the plot.  Tina Lifford is cast as the cop who helps him.  She has just the right amount of cop savvy and skepticism to make her very real.  Paul Rodriguez is cast as the cop who's jealous of Eastwood's accomplishments.  And there's even a ethnic angle thrown in as the murdered woman, her sister and Rodriguez are all of Mexican descent. The setting is Los Angeles and Eastwood lives on a houseboat in the Marina.  His next-door-neighbor is Jeff Daniels, who becomes Eastwood's sidekick.I enjoyed all the acting, the cinematography and the storyline.  It didn't even matter to me that it was all a little too farfetched and that some of the details of the plot didn't make sense.

Terry is also happens to be a retired FBI agent that has been given a new lease on life, but with a heart of a murder victim.  Since Terry has a very unique blood type, the murder victim's sister, Graciella Rivers, tracks him down and asks him to investigate who murdered her sister. She knows he has the training and a stickler for details, to have the reputation of being the best detective at the FBI's Southern California Office.  Terry knows he will be going against his doctor's orders, but is hooked on a mission he cannot say no to.  Terry calls up all his old favors with the FBI and Police Departments, to help solve this strange crime.Terry's cardiology surgeon, Dr. Bonnie Fox (Angelica Houston) is upset he took on this mission as he is still recovering from major surgery, but ends up helping him.The story is interesting on how it builds suspense on small clues that come together at a steady pace.  Harry shows great determination not to let the killer get away on a cold case crime the Police have given up on.  The police have mixed feelings about Terry investigating the case but grudgingly help.  Terry also enlists the help of his houseboat neighbor, Buddy Noone (Jeff Daniels) to drive him around and help out with the mundane chores of the investigation.

Why do I rent things expecting they are junk?  9/10ths of movie rental is the masochistic art of self-inflicted stinkers.  But this movie surprised me.  Possibly its because I watched it on four separate nights, a little bit at a time, and allowed each segment to settle into my subconscious.  I felt I got to know the characters.  The movie was slow and easy-going, even though a killer is on the loose and Clint is prone to play fast and loose with buckshot on what seems to be a Culver City street.  His fetching black female cop friend gets out her own piece and shoots hell out of the suspected perp's vehicle even though she doesn't even know what's going on.  All this and the movie has a subdued, contemplative feel.  You gotta like this movie.And then there's Buddy, the self-described Boat Bum who is Clint's next door neighbor down at the marina.  I really fell for this character.  So minor, so plausible as an ordinary, idle man who knows that he is a loser, preferring to sit life out on the sidelines with a sad little smile and a case of beer.  This man is so human, so full of muted pathos.  The movie is a strangely meditative cop drama where all these little characters loom larger than life because, without realizing it, our attention dwells on them so long.

Retired FBI agent Terry McCaleb thinks that it is the *locations* which are random, and that the killer's victims are very, very specific. Will his wisdom prevail? That is one of the interesting plot elements in ""Blood Work"", the 20th movie starring Clint Eastwood that he has also directed.Eastwood plays McCaleb, a gritty man with a gentle streak, who was forced into retirement after suffering a heart attack while chasing a serial killer on his last case. Two years later, McCaleb receives a new heart, and the serial killer is still at-large. Terry McCaleb is Eastwood playing his age. We know that this man used to possess solid physical strength, but age has diminished that strength, so now he is left to rely almost solely on his keen intellect. That intellect does not fail him, although it is sometimes slow to catch on.McCaleb is enjoying retirement on his boat, when he is approached by the sister of the woman whose heart he now has. She explains to him that her sister was murdered (one of the victims of the aforementioned hold-up artist/killer), and she would like for McCaleb to crack the case and find the murderer. At first reluctant, the former FBI man soon acquiesces to the sister's request, and the game is afoot.I found ""Blood Work"" enjoyable. Watching Eastwood so easily play the role of McCaleb is fun in and of itself, and the story is always involving. It isn't necessarily as realistic as it could have been, but that is part of its charm. McCaleb falls into that realm of the Hercule Poirot detective: a former law enforcement official who should, by no real rights, have access to such things as police discussions of the case, a crime scene, evidence books, and videotapes of murders - yet he does. That is fine. It leaves the story unhampered, and it can progress at a good pace.The revelation of the killer in ""Blood Work"" I found to be a little weak, and somewhat over the top. I would not dare disclose any more here. But suffice it to say, it jarred me a little bit. Nevertheless, I found the movie a highly entertaining weekend diversion.

Oh, well, I think Eastwood did a remarkably good job in bringing this excellent Michael Connelly book to screen.  Having read the book, it was good to see Brian Hildegard's screenplay maintain the feel and tension of the novel.  Eastwood directs well, and plays his role of Terry McCaleb to the max.  It's one of the first movies where he plays a character more suitable to his age; but as my wife says, who cares if he's 72 and romances younger women?  She said he could put her shoes under her bed anytime; of course, she'd have to move  mine!  But I digress...Wanda DeJesus and Tina Lifford are fine as the women in Clint's life--I particularly liked Lifford's portrayal of Jan, whose involvement with Clint goes a little deeper than what we think?  I loved Paul Rodriguez and Dylan Walsh as the LA cops who want Clint out of the way.  Walsh who doesn't say a lot, has a commanding presence as an alternate to Rodriguez's bravado.  Anjelica Huston is perfect as Clint's doctor: I've known medical people just like her.  Takes a small role and commands the screen when she's on.

600887,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00005JLGP,"Mike London ""MAC""","[2, 2]","Clint Eastwood, one of Hollywood's most famous `tough' guys, has lately been turning in pictures ruminating his mortality, and this one is no different.  Watching his old films, such as The Outlaw Josey Wells and the Dirty Harry flicks, it's rather startling to see Eastwood looking so --, well, so old.Blood Work, directed by Eastwood, features him in the role of a retired FBI cop (Terry McCaleb) who was a main media cornerstone.  Chasing the ""Code Killer,"" a person who leaves codes for McCaleb to break, he chases him down a long alley and they collaspes from a heart issue.Two years later, he's living on a marina, trying waiting for a heart transplant.  He gets one, and then is approached with another case.  Graceille (Wanda De Jesus), the lady who contacts him, has a very convincing argument: he has her murdered sister's heart.  He takes the case, despite the very verbal protest from his doctor who threatens to quit seeing him if he doesn't slow down.The rest of the movie moves through Eastwood chasing the killer.  What makes Blood Work such an effective piece of film-making is it shows the `tough man' stereotype as a shell.  Seeing Eastwood stoved up and constantly aware of his mortality is rather shocking, and it drives home not only Terry McCaleb's mortality but Eastwood's as well.  At the film's climax, there's shots of Eastwood with a gun that look like they're straight out of Dirt Harry.  This time around, instead of looking menacing and invincible, Eastwood looks withered, like he's been on the road too long though he can still pack a punch.  That exploration of mortality is what makes this film successful.Another element, largely unexplored in police thrillers, is the duality of man.  Without giving to much away, the movie examines the idea of the Ying-Yang, and how both good and evil need one another, forming a symbiotic relationship.  One belief is good and evil function because of the conflict they provide, and they need each other.  The film rejects this (thankfully), and this rejection ties into McCaleb's retirement and failing health, uniting the two major themes into a very nice, cohesive ending sequence.  This theme of duality definetly sets apart Bloodwork and how deftly Eastwood ties that into the mortality issues shows how accomplished these film makers have become in their craft.The only main issue I had with Bloodwork was the love story angle.  While very underplayed, McCaleb and Graceilla eventually get together, but it feels so artificial and forced.  It doesn't ring true at all: not that they could not get together, but Eastwood didn't develop the onscreen story enough in that department to make it believable.Other than the film's weakness in the love story, Bloodwork triumphs.

Confidential"" script by Brian Helgeland (which he also adapted), ""Blood Work"" serves as a fine adult suspense film.First of all, Eastwood does a nice job playing McCaleb, the ex-FBI guy with a heart transplant. When you see him in the mini-documentary after the film, you realize the slow speech and overall beaten tone of his character is 'acting'. I feel a few of the other reviewers may have missed that. He is so spry and well-spoken that the contrast to the movie is a bit startling.As usual in an Eastwood film, he surrounds himself with A+ talent. There are a few clunky lines spread throughout the movie; it is by no means perfect. But his ensemble manages to make it so you hardly care.The only truly disposable characters were Paul Rodriguez, who quickly becomes tiresome, and Dylan Walsh, because I don't think he had one line in the whole thing.The procedural portion of the film is very slowly and carefully told; it may put off viewers lacking patience. The melodramatic portion (he's investigating the murder of the person whose heart he now has...) may cause a viewer or two to roll their eyes, but those who are willing will enjoy a crisp adult crime film.I would be remiss if I failed to mention the lovely Long Beach locations.There.

Though he was nominated for a best actor Oscar in only one film(Unforgiven) in which he deserved the nomination, I stand convinced that this was indeed his best performance. I was blown away. He nailed the character and the entire performance was brilliant. It seems because he has aged and his voice has become a little gravel-like, it does seem it may distract some viewers of this film from realizing just how good Clint was in this movie. Clint's roles are usually not very demanding. He normally plays characters that don't have extremely dramatic moments or dialogue, and the same it true here as well. But despite it his performance was truly great in this film. Beyond this Clint also produced and directed most of this movie pitch perfect.

steadily re-releasing most of his works onto DVD,either singly and/or sets,in a remastered form and boy do they look good.This movie is no exception and as always this enhances the viewing experience tremendously.The story line in this well cast movie is about one Lt.McCaleb,retired FBI profiler.One night he is on scene investigating a homicide when he spots the suspect.He chases him but has a heart attack while trying to climb a chain link fence.The hooded suspect stops and starts back towards him which enables McCaleb to get a few shots off at him,and he wounds the fleeing suspect.McCaleb goes out and we find that he is not only still alive but has received a heart transplant from a young lady who was fatally shot in a robbery around this same time.He also is now retired and living on a boat,and his neighbour is a jolly sort of guy by the name of Jasper Noone(Jeff Daniels),who lives off his dad's stipends.One day NcCaleb is visited by a woman by the name of Graciella Rivers(Wanda De Jesus).It seems McCaleb was the recipient of his dead sisters heart and she reasons he owes it to her sister to find her killer.Reluctantly he agrees but as his inquiries and investigation widen his heart is starting to act for the worse under the strain.His doctor Dr Fox(Angelica Huston)continually warns him against such folly but McCaleb determinedly soldiers on.The trail has many branches and some of them lead to seemingly dead ends but there is a grisly connection to all of them.Witnesses even get killed and when he goes to the location of one of the murders at an ATM machine,the murderer himself unknowingly(to McCaleb)stands right behind him.As McCaleb's heart saps his energy he enlists the help of Jaspar,whom he calls ""Buddy"",to drive him around to various locales.A Russian suspect who he interrogates at his work place roughs up the weakened McCaleb and escapes,only to turn up dead later.He visits the wife of the ATM victim and discovers the killer has been taking souvenirs.Not only that but close studying of security tapes of the crime scenes reveals the killer is sending McCaleb verbal messages.Graciella and her sisters son visit McCaleb one evening on his boat.The son asks McCaleb what the numbers mean that were found at the original crime scene.He says he could never figure them out and the boy replies that there is no number one.McCaleb and the Graciella visit the hospital next day and talk to his doctor.Someone he believes has hacked into the blood donor files and  that the motive for the killings was their blood types not money.Sure enough this turns out to be the case as the main victims names/blood types are all on the list.The revelation finally hits McCaleb and he pays a visit to his boat pal Buddy.It was his last name that finally gave him the answer....no(one),as in no""one"" in the numbers left at the original crime scene.Buddy is the killer and admits it at gun point.He has kidnapped Graciella and her sisters son and when he attempts to leave McCaleb wounds him in the arm.He forces Noone to take him to their location;on a boat due for demolition run aground in the harbour.Noone temporarily escapes and when McCaleb finds and frees Graciella and her sisters son,he tells them to pull his boat back from the one they're on until they get his signal.However the killer has already hidden aboard the boat and when he reveals himself she deliberately rams the boat into the derelict boat and Noone goes flying off onto its deck.Lying there he taunts McCaleb telling him he needs him and other lies.One shot and he lands on shallow water on the boat.Defiantly he raises his head out of the water but Graciella is there to push it back down.A taut thriller with a totally surprising twist to its ending,this is a thoroughly enjoyable entry in the Eastwood canon and proves,as if he needed to prove anything,what a great talent he is.I can say with some satisfaction that while I was never a fan of his spaghetti westerns,I latched onto his works in the late 60s and early 70s.I could see the talent on the rise then and knew great things would happen with Eastwood.And while no one ever has a perfect record,Eastwood has come as close as any to accomplishing that in a stellar acting and directing career;while making tons of coin at the box office for Warner Brothers along the way.His is truly a Hollywood success story where Eastwood has admirably done it...""his way"",and I'm am grateful to have been along for the ride all these years and am still amazed at his on going output.A true talent and original.Thank you Mr.Eastwood.This newly remastered edition gives us a clear and crisp picture in its' original a/r.Extras include a featurette on the production end of things,a conversation with Eastwood,De Jesus and Paul Rodriguez and the trailer.All in all a highly enjoyable and recommended Eastwood picture guaranteed to satisfy all the way to the end.",4,A very decent Eastwood Thriller,1287878400,"10 24,

600904,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLGP,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 8]","***1/2 For action movie stars, the question of how to age gracefully on screen has become a growing concern of late, now that many of the men who made their mark and their fortunes in the genre during the `70's, `80's and early `90's have begun to slip not merely into middle age but, in some cases, even old age as well.  For understandable reasons, many of these brawny gentlemen have refused to go gently into that night of second-string bit player roles and has-been status - and their studios, which earned some mighty bucks off their popularity during that time, have been reluctant to let go of them as well.  The action genre requires, of course, a nimbleness and vitality that come only with youth.  How then to get men pushing 50, 60, even 70 years of age to compete with the up-and-coming action stars of the future, men with the energy and vigor to pull off the stunts these senior citizens can but dream about from their own long-past glory days?  One way to deal with the problem is to simply ignore the effects of aging altogether, to have the actors go through the motions anyway, even at the risk of reducing the whole enterprise to the level of rank implausibility.  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, in their latest action films, have settled for this strategy, the result of which is that their films haven't been either very successful at the box office or all that much fun to watch of late.  The much older Clint Eastwood has decided to take the opposite tack.  In the latter stages of his career, Eastwood has found ways to incorporate the elements of aging into the people he is portraying.  These characters need time to recover from the stressful physical requirements of the job; their reflex time is not always what it should be; they work hard at staying alongside their younger crime-fighting partners when pursuing a suspect on foot; they get winded when they run.  The sight of Eastwood panting to keep up with the President's motorcade in ""In the Line of Fire"" is one of the great emblematic images of `90's action cinema.Well, it is nine years since that film, and Eastwood himself is now 72 years old.  In his new film ""Blood Work,"" Eastwood's Terry McCaleb is about as close to keeling over dead as any action movie protagonist we have ever come across.  Not only is he old, he suffers a heart attack while chasing a serial killer in the opening scene and, two years later, has just received a brand new ticker, courtesy of a young female donor who was murdered in a convenience store robbery.  Although McCaleb's doctor keeps telling him that this postoperative period is a crucial one requiring complete rest and relaxation, this retired FBI murder investigator decides to disobey doctor's orders when the heart donor's beautiful sister arrives on his houseboat begging him to help her find the young woman's killer.  The plot of ""Blood Work,"" based on the novel by Michael Connelly (and adapted by Brian Helgeland), is not the real selling point of the film - although it emerges as a better-than-average police procedural with some interesting plot twists, unusual locations and a nice maze-like structure to keep the audience guessing (although I must admit that I figured out who the killer was rather early on in the story).  The film also does a nice job closing in on itself, making McCaleb himself an integral part of the story's final unraveling (though it does steal a bit from ""In the Line of Fire"" in this one area).  Yet the most impressive aspect of the film is not its story but its central character and, most particularly, the performance of Eastwood himself.  Perhaps because he also directed the picture, this legendary star really seems to inhabit the character he is playing here.  With his craggy - but still remarkably handsome - face, Eastwood looks like a man who has weathered any number of life's greatest trials and emerged from them a better, more compassionate human being.  Having devoted his career to trying to get into the minds of the sickest types of criminals imaginable (serial killers), he is still able to be touched by the desperate pleas of a grieving sister, the sad plight of a young boy facing the grim prospect of an early death brought on by a weak heart, and the innate goodness and innocence of a young son who has lost the dearest thing in his life to a madman's bullet.  McCaleb knows the difference between good and evil, and he also knows that second chances don't always come around in life so he better make the most of the one he's been handed.There are superb supporting performances by Jeff Daniels as the neighbor excited at the prospect of sharing in some of the glamour of McCaleb's investigative work, Anjelica Huston as the cardiologist maddened by her patient's refusal to take it easy in his crucial period of convalescence, Wanda De Jesus as the sister who sets the plot in motion with her request that McCaleb help her in her search for justice, Paul Rodriquez as the eternally irate detective who thinks McCaleb is overstepping his jurisdiction and Tina Lifford as a fellow investigator who has enough faith to trust the old pro even when he seems to be going beyond the bounds of totally by-the-book rules and procedures.It's unfortunate that Eastwood does compromise a bit by having his character end up in a romantic relationship with the much younger De Jesus rather than with a woman closer to his own age.  I guess even this superstar couldn't stand THAT much of an affront to his male ego.  Oh well, give credit to the man for at least having the gumption to confront some of the realities of his own aging.  We are happy enough with what we have.  Let's not expect miracles.",3,solid Eastwood vehicle,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,5701,"['***1/2', 'action', 'movie', 'stars', 'question', 'how', 'age', 'gracefully', 'screen', 'become', 'growing',

So, the enjoyment is in the journey. And it's not a bad journey, as a retired FBI profiler (Clint Eastwood) takes the case of a woman (Wanda DeJesus) whose sister was killed by a serial killer, and whose heart now resides in Eastwood's body after a transplant.Hooey? Well, of course it is. But the movie has to jumpstart itself somehow.So, anyway, Eastwood ain't bad and admiring Wanda DeJesus is a decent way to spend an evening. Eastwood's leisurely ""real time"" method of directing a scene lets us relax a little, enjoy the flavor of the meat, if you will. I like that about Eastwood, even if I wouldn't want to see it every day. He plays the right cards here, letting scenes play long for atmosphere. Lord knows there ain't a lot of suspense.Like I said, a six-year-old can figure out the killer. It so plain-as-day you almost get faked out and think ""this is the red herring to end all red herrings."" The book can take its time a little, reveal itself more slowly. A movie has a budget, and it has actors, and those actors are paid, and you bet your bottom penny a studio isn't going to pay a well-known actor to just pal around on a houseboat.

600909,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JLGP,Steven Reynolds,"[2, 11]","A potentially silly story concept is at least grounded here by the no-nonsense solidity of Eastwood, but not even his wonderfully stoic performance can save this from Brian Helgeland's aimlessly wandering screenplay. The Oscar-winning co-writer of ""L.A. Confidential"" must have been asleep at the keyboard on this one: scene after scene is marred by repetitive exposition as characters are brought up to date with information the audience already knows. With all that free time to think about other things, it shouldn't take you long to figure out who's behind the killings and why.  When that's finally revealed, the film segues into a cliched and predictable climax cribbed from a Dirty Harry movie (I won't spoil it by telling you which one).  Eastwood's direction is either pleasantly old-fashioned or painfully uninspired, depending on your taste.

Blood Work is a detective movie that Clint Eastwood is at the heart of.

He has to have heart transplant in order to live. He learns that the heart he got was from a murdered woman.The sister of the murdered woman tracks Terry, who is now retired from the FBI down and pleads with him to look into the investigation. So with a license or the authority he takes on the investigation. The investigation goes from one unbelievable twist to another.I found this movie to move way to fast. The twists and the conclusions that Eastwoods makes from the clues are really hard to swallow. In particular the part when the sister asks for his help. He basically jumped to this womans rescue without even thinking about what he was getting himself into. He was only sixty days post-op from his transplant surgery.I think this was Eastwoods last hurray at a detective movie. At least I hope.

600912,A3C2WKP1LZKMU,B00005JLGP,"Tammy L. Schilling ""tammyl84""","[0, 4]","Blood Work is a somewhat typical cop vs. serial killer type story.  The serial killer gets his jollies by leaving some sort of cryptic code at each murder and leaving messages for the policeman who chases him.  And so it goes, we've seen it all before.The basic premise of Blood Work is that the cop, Terry McCaleb (Clint Eastwood) ends up being sidelined by heart disease and ends up getting a heart transplant a couple of years later.  Two months after his transplant the donor's sister comes around looking for McCaleb to find out who killed her sister.  Against the strenuous objections of his cardiologist (Angelica Houston), who worries about the new heart being rejected in McCaleb's still weak state, he takes on the assignment.  Jeff Daniels plays Buddy, a boatbum neighbor that McCaleb pays to drive him around.As you've probably guessed, it turns out that the donor was shot by the serial killer that McCaleb was trying to catch two years ago during his heart attack.  What's more, the donor was shot with the express purpose of getting McCaleb her heart, so that he could resume the game of trying to catch the serial killer.  And who is the serial killer?  Well, it's Buddy the boatbum, of course.The movie is basically predictable.  After all, isn't the goal of most of these movies to make the guilty party the least likely person right under your nose?  It's getting a little old.  Worse, during the hunt to find the person who shot the donor, McCaleb becomes 'involved' with her sister.  Oh, will someone kindly spare me the unlikely romance bit?  Is it absolutely essential that the writers come up with a love story in every one of these films?Still, the acting in this movie is good and there is a polish to the film that is much appreciated.  With Eastwood directing, the viewer is treated to a slow paced film that provides a little more brain candy than adreneline.  Some viewers, such as myself, will enjoy this quality.  Others will wish that they hurry up with it.  Overall, a predictable story but entertaining enough movie.

600915,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLGP,Tsuyoshi,"[29, 38]","My three star rating may look unkind, but actually it is 3.5, so don't be mistaken.  Clint Eastwood never played any other role than Eastwood (or Dirty Harry), that's true, but the point is, he does it cool, and does it with confidence.  He knows what he is doing, even as a director, and ""Blood Work"" is another proof that he is one of the accomplished directors of America.Eastwood is ex-FBI profiler Terry McCareb, now retired after one bloody case of murder.  Recovered from severe heart attack which hit him during the invetigation, he gets an operation.  Now a heart transplant recepient, Terry is advised to live quitely by his doctor Anjelica Huston.  But an unexpected visitor comes to him, asking him to help her; her sister was murdered at a grocery shop, and she says she has a good reason to ask Terry to do what she needs.Back in former business, Terry starts his own search for the killer, and the film displays some actions (including shootings) and activities of Terry with his sidekick Jeff Daniels (""Speed"" and ""Dumb and Dumber""), but it is Eastwood whom we would watch with certain amount of respect and feeling of ""wow"".  In fact, even though he was born in 1930, he still is in good shape, with his tough and cool images all around.  You may say this guy Terry is just an elder version of Harry, and you're right.  But when Eastwood does it, he does it better than anyone, blending his machismo with some sort of resignation and sadness which only those veterans can exude.Once I heard that Eastwood behind the carema never shouts or yells when shooting -- no ""Action!"" no ""Cut!"" -- but speaks it quietly (and in Italian too).  Probably so.  The pace of the film is always assured, showing that director Eastwood perfectly comprehends his subject.  No flashy camera work is there; you see his assured touch of direction, which can be neither too fast nor too slow.  Like his previous ""Space Cowboys"", ""Blood Work"" never runs, but is always moving.You might find the script of Brian Helgeland (""LA Confidential"" ""Knight's Tale"" and others) a little too transparent, but it keeps you interested even though some of you might detect the truth half on the way.  But as I said, it is the film of Clint Eastwood who, as you know, loves jazz music.  And like jazz, the film may look too slow and quiet for younger audiences as it goes with leisured pace.

600921,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B00005JLGP,Wayne C. Rogers,"[2, 2]","As a fan of the ""Terry McCaleb"" series by Michael Connelly, I didn't have a problem with Clint Eastwood portraying the F.B.I. profiler.  Though there might be an age difference, I thought Eastwood captured the character of the no-nonsense, tough-as-nails McCaleb perfectly.  In the film version of the novel, Blood Work, McCaleb has a heart attack while chasing a vicious murderer known as the Code Killer through the back allies of Los Angeles.  The movie then picks up two years later and sixty days after McCaleb has finally had a heart transplant.  Still recovering from the operation, McCaleb is approached by Graciella Rivera (the sister of the donor, Gloria, whose heart was given to him) to find the man who killed her beloved sister.  Perhaps out of guilt at being the receiver of the heart and against his better judgment, McCaleb agrees to look into the case.  He really doesn't expect to find out much, knowing that the police have probably taken the case as far as it can go.  All of that, however, changes as he starts to put the pieces of the puzzle together.  What had seemed at first to be a routine homicide ends up being something far darker and more violent than even our retired profiler could suspect.  He soon discovers a connection between Gloria's death and the murder of a man that happened just two weeks before hers.  This leads him to eventually believe that the Code Killer is back and that Gloria was killed so that he might have her heart and once again enact the battle between good and evil as the serial killer refers to it.  You see, the Code Killer hasn't finished with McCaleb and wants him back in the game.  The only thing the Code Killer hasn't figured into the equation is that though McCaleb's fragile, he's not as nice as he used to be and intends to put this asshole down the hard way with everything he's got.  The ending isn't going to be pretty.As the director and star of Blood Work, Clint Eastwood proves that he's still at the top of his game.  He keeps everything simple by casting good actors (Jeff Daniels, Angelica Huston, Wanda De Jesus, and Paul Rodriguez) who know exactly what to bring to a performance, getting each shot with just one or two takes, and playing Terry McCaleb as a real character who's in his senior years with a serious health condition.  The pace of the movie may be slow, but that's to be expected.  Neither Eastwood, nor McCaleb, are exactly young men in their prime.  Eastwood plays the role the way it should be done, taking it nice and easy, until the final confrontation occurs and he can do a ""Dirty Harry"" on the bad guy.  I love it at the end when the Code Killer thinks that he's won the game and walks confidently away from McCaleb, only to be shot by our slightly tarnished hero.  That's definitely something Dirty Harry would do.  Though there are a couple of things that aren't explained in the movie such as how the killer is able to tap into the organ donor's website to get the necessary information or how the killer is able to be parked down the street from the convenience store for the shotgun shootout when he's actually supposed to be doing something else, which I can't give away without telling you who he is.  The shootout was great, but the timing wasn't right and left a big plot hole for me to wonder about.  It makes me think that a scene was cut out of the movie.

This movie is anemic from the beginning. Taken from a wonderful novel by Michael Connelly, Clint plays an old grouchy dude who's just gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a serial killer. Run, run, run, THUD. Next, new ticker intact, Clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her sister, another cute black woman. Oh, and CBW#2 plays the guilt card on Clint, because he's got his new ticker courtesy of CBW#1. So there's a little bit of investigative work, a little but of huffin' and a puffin', and finally Clint discovers who the serial killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and the murder of the donor of his second ticker. Jeff Daniels plays a doofus that lives next door to Clint. What a stretch. Special warning: Clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he smooches on CBW#2. It must be in his contract or something. No one, and I mean, NO ONE wants to see saggy Clint with his shirt off. For a much, much better Clint movie, go rent ""Unforgiven"".",1,Clint!

I was convinced he had an heart attack, in fact it was a little annoying, as I thought he was going to have a real one.  I imagine this is his swan song as far as shoot'em up run 'em down movies of his younger years. And why not! It would still be good to see him in any detective work, forensic or otherwise. A great actor!Craciella Rivers, 'Flawless, The Insider,' did a great job as the sister of the murdered girl and whose heart was given to Clint.  She tracks Clint (an x FBI agent) down and wants him to find the killer. The story drags a little and Paul Rodriques, city cop 'Ronoldo' display's his angst toward Clint and in another movie, Clint would have slapped him around, but instead he gets the last verbal shot at the raving Renoldo. Very funny scene. I was wondering what Angelica Houston , 'Buffalo 66 ,' Ever After-was doing in this small part as the Dr. taking care of Clint, but then remembered that Clint was a great friend of John Houston, Angelica's father!

600926,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JLGP,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","When I watched this when it first came out back in 2002, I remember thinking that it was pretty good.  Upon further review of a more recent viewing, I am sad to report that ""Blood Work"" does not nearly hold up to the test of time.For a basic plot summary, the movie follows former police detective Terry McCaleb (Clint Eastwood), whose new heart happens to belong to a murder victim, a woman he vows (on the plea of her sister and orphaned son) to avenge by catching her killer.If you watched this movie in the theater back in 2002 without being spoiled by the ""twist ending"", you probably enjoyed it more than I will describe in this review.  At that point in Eastwood's career, it was a nice vehicle in transferring him strictly to ""old-timer"" roles instead of always trying to ""turn back the clock"" on his age-appropriateness.In retrospect, though, ""Blood Work"" has two things firmly against it:1. When it is quickly followed by ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", and Eastwood's directorial efforts like ""The Changeling"" and ""Flags of Our Fathers"", ""Blood Work"" all of a sudden seems more towards the median line in terms of Clint's overall performance.2. A more fair criticism of the film, though, would be that it is little more than a hard-boiled cop drama that (judging by the reviews of others, as I have not read the book it is based on) includes none of the ""heart"" (pardon the pun) of its printed page predecessor.  There are two many ridiculous logical jumps and character presentations (first and foremost being the ridiculous romance between old-man Clint and his heart-givers much younger sister) to make this flick seem ""original"" enough to give it screen credibility.Thus, like I said, the very first unspoiled viewing of Blood Work ""in its time"" might be a little bit better of an experience (though no classic by any means even then), but overall this is a film that will largely be lost to the sands of time (with only Eastwood's name keeping it relevant).",2,Doesn't Hold Up Well,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1979,"['When', 'watched', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'back', '2002', 'remember', 'thinking', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'further', 'review', 'more', 'recent', 'viewing', 'am', 'sad', 'report', 'Blood', 'Work', 'not', 'nearly', 'hold', 'up', 'test', 'time.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'former', 'police', 'detective', 'Terry', 'McCaleb', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'new', 'heart', 'belong', 'murder', 'victim', 'woman', 'plea', 'sister', 'orphaned', 'son', 'avenge', 'catching', 'killer.If', 'watched', 'movie', 'theater', 'back', '2002', 'being', 'spoiled', 'twist', 'ending', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'will', 'describe', 'review', 'point', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'was', 'nice', 'vehicle', 'transferring', 'strictly', 'old-timer', 'roles', 'instead', 'always', 'trying', 'turn', 'back', 'clock', 'age-appropriateness.In', 'retrospect', 'though', 'Blood', 'Work', 'two', 'things', 'firmly', 'it:1', 'When', 'quickly', 'followed', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Eastwood', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'Changeling', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Blood', 'Work', 'sudden', 'more', 'median', 'line', 'terms', 'Clint', 'overall', 'performance.2', 'more', 'fair', 'criticism', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'hard-boiled', 'cop', 'drama', 'judging', 'reviews', 'others', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'based', 'none', 'heart', 'pardon', 'pun', 'printed', 'page', 'predecessor', 'are', 'two', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'logical', 'jumps', 'character', 'presentations', 'first', 'foremost', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'romance', 'old-man', 'Clint', 'heart-givers', 'much', 'younger', 'sister', 'make', 'flick', 'seem', 'original', 'enough', 'give', 'screen', 'credibility.Thus', 'said', 'very', 'first', 'unspoiled', 'viewing', 'Blood', 'Work', 'time', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'experience', 'classic', 'means', 'even', 'then', 'overall', 'film', 'will', 'largely', 'be', 'lost', 'sands', 'time', 'only', 'Eastwood', 'name', 'keeping', 'relevant']",Blood Work
