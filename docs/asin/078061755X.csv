28314,A3Q77CS1DEQLMG,078061755X,Alessandro Bruno,"[4, 4]","This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. I bought this DVD as a gift, as I have seen this film five times already in three different languages.  I was astounded at how the film was at once simple yet moving and realistic withouyt resorting to any sappiness.  as someone who has struggled to become a good pianist (though hardly a virtuoso), I understood the emotion and desire that can overcome you as you decide to tackle a difficult piece.  Learning it is akin to a great triumph. I think the film is strongest during the sequence that depicts Helfgott's study at the Royal Conservatory as he learns the Rachmaninov concerto no. 3.  The shots of the hands climbing the keyboard, the emphasis on the choirds of the main cadenza and the obvious satisfaction shown by the actor were very moving.  I was on the edge of my seat.  I think, howver, the scene that truly shows what music can mean is one of the final ones as helfgott is jumping on a net listening to a headset playing a Vivaldi cantata.  He's completely lost in the music and an unbound happiness.  As I told the girl that accompanied me to my first viewing of the film, that's what music means to me.",5,Redemption and Music,1009584000,"12 29, 2001",2001,1179,"['one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'bought', 'DVD', 'gift', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'five', 'times', 'already', 'three', 'different', 'languages', 'was', 'astounded', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'once', 'simple', 'yet', 'moving', 'realistic', 'withouyt', 'resorting', 'sappiness', 'someone', 'who', 'struggled', 'become', 'good', 'pianist', 'hardly', 'virtuoso', 'understood', 'emotion', 'desire', 'can', 'overcome', 'decide', 'tackle', 'difficult', 'piece', 'Learning', 'akin', 'great', 'triumph', 'think', 'film', 'strongest', 'sequence', 'Helfgott', 'study', 'Royal', 'Conservatory', 'Rachmaninov', 'concerto', 'no', '3', 'shots', 'hands', 'climbing', 'keyboard', 'emphasis', 'choirds', 'main', 'cadenza', 'obvious', 'satisfaction', 'shown', 'actor', 'were', 'very', 'moving', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'think', 'howver', 'scene', 'truly', 'what', 'music', 'can', 'mean', 'one', 'final', 'ones', 'helfgott', 'jumping', 'net', 'listening', 'headset', 'playing', 'Vivaldi', 'cantata', 'completely', 'lost', 'music', 'unbound', 'happiness', 'told', 'girl', 'accompanied', 'first', 'viewing', 'film', 'what', 'music']",N/A

Behind him is the emotionally isolated existence as a child piano prodigy whose emotional turmoil led to a nervous breakdown and years of staying in a mental institution. Ahead of him is his eventual reconnection with the world around him driven by love and his virtuoso talent that had been long abandoned. As the movie progresses, we first see David's childhood living under his domineering father, Peter Helfgott in a suburban Melbourne house surrounded by barb wire. Peter is a Holocaust survivor, having seen his family destroyed at the hands of the Nazis. He rules the family with a stern demeanor, suffocating them with his love. Peter is obsessed with winning, and the need to keep his family together. This philosophy is imparted on young David, and nothing short of winning satisfies his father. David's father tells him  ""I know life is cruel, but music will always be your friend, everything else will let you down in the end. Everything. Believe me, everything."" Under the guidance of piano teacher Ben Rosen, David's skill is refined, winning him several competitions. In a national championship, he is offered a scholarship by violin master Isaac Stern to study in the United States. However, unwilling to loosen the grip on his son, Peter forbids David from going.After this missed opportunity, the piano teacher is replaced by an old Russian woman, who continues to encourage David and a second opportunity arises.  David gets a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London. Once again, his father forbids him to go, but in his first show of independence, David leaves the Helfgott home, and his father severs all relations with him. In London, David is mentored by Cecil Parkes and learns to play Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto, one of the most difficult piano pieces to play. David plays this piece perfectly in concert, but suffers an emotional breakdown as a result. We then see  David ten years later and he is a shattered man, spending his days in a mental institution, his talent unused, and his name forgotten. One rainy night, having wandered off, he comes upon a restaurant, and expresses himself on the unused piano against the back wall of the restaurant, playing an amazing rendition of The Flight of the Bumblebee. Impressed by his skill and the reaction of the restaurant patrons, the owner of the restaurant hires him to play there. Word of the master piano player spreads across Australia, and soon David finds himself on the stage of a recital hall once again. And along the way, he also finds true love, Gillian an astrologer who inspires him to greatness once again. When David does play again, many years later, he rejects the hollow philosophy of his father and begins a new path, embracing the support of those around him. He truly does shine.",5,Wonderful movie about David Helfgott,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,2961,"['beginning', 'movie', 'Shine', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'middle', 'aged', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'babbling', 'wandering', 'rain', 'state', 'transition', 'emotionally', 'isolated', 'existence', 'child', 'piano', 'prodigy', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'led', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'years', 'staying', 'mental', 'institution', 'Ahead', 'eventual', 'reconnection', 'world', 'driven', 'love', 'virtuoso', 'talent', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'abandoned', 'movie', 'first', 'see', 'David', 'childhood', 'living', 'domineering', 'father', 'Peter', 'Helfgott', 'suburban', 'Melbourne', 'house', 'surrounded', 'barb', 'wire', 'Peter', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'having', 'seen', 'family', 'destroyed', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'rules', 'family', 'stern', 'demeanor', 'suffocating', 'love', 'Peter', 'obsessed', 'winning', 'need', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'philosophy', 'imparted', 'young', 'David', 'nothing', 'short', 'winning', 'satisfies', 'father', 'David', 'father', 'know', 'life', 'cruel', 'music', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'friend', 'everything', 'else', 'will', 'let', 'down', 'end', 'Everything', 'Believe', 'everything', 'guidance', 'piano', 'teacher', 'Ben', 'Rosen', 'David', 'skill', 'refined', 'winning', 'several', 'competitions', 'national', 'championship', 'offered', 'scholarship', 'violin', 'master', 'Isaac', 'Stern', 'study', 'United', 'States', 'However', 'unwilling', 'loosen', 'grip', 'son', 'Peter', 'David', 'going.After', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'piano', 'teacher', 'replaced', 'old', 'Russian', 'woman', 'who', 'encourage', 'David', 'second', 'opportunity', 'arises', 'David', 'scholarship', 'Royal', 'College', 'Music', 'London', 'Once', 'again', 'father', 'forbids', 'go', 'first', 'show', 'independence', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'home', 'father', 'severs', 'relations', 'London', 'David', 'mentored', 'Cecil', 'Parkes', 'play', 'Rachmaninoff', 'Third', 'Piano', 'Concerto', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'piano', 'pieces', 'play', 'David', 'piece', 'perfectly', 'concert', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'result', 'then', 'see', 'David', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'shattered', 'man', 'spending', 'days', 'mental', 'institution', 'talent', 'unused', 'name', 'forgotten', 'One', 'rainy', 'night', 'having', 'wandered', 'off', 'restaurant', 'unused', 'piano', 'back', 'wall', 'restaurant', 'playing', 'amazing', 'rendition', 'Flight', 'Bumblebee', 'Impressed', 'skill', 'reaction', 'restaurant', 'patrons', 'owner', 'restaurant', 'play', 'there', 'Word', 'master', 'piano', 'player', 'spreads', 'Australia', 'soon', 'David', 'stage', 'recital', 'hall', 'once', 'again', 'way', 'also', 'true', 'love', 'Gillian', 'astrologer', 'who', 'greatness', 'once', 'again', 'When', 'David', 'play', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'hollow', 'philosophy', 'father', 'new', 'path', 'embracing', 'support', 'truly', 'shine']",N/A

Seeing it again, Shine is still a pretty good film. Geoffrey Rush may have won the Oscar, but I am very surprised that Noah Taylor didn't merit a win in a tie because he is also as good, if not better, as Rush. The same situation occurred when Daniel Day-Lewis won the Oscar yet Hugh O'Conor, the child, was totally better. Armin Mueller-Stahl and John Gielgud also turn in well-played performances. The story is interesting, but after reading a good deal of his background, there is a great deal of fabrication. The film may deliver great music; however in reality, David Helfgott is anything but. The trouble with his playing is that it's all technical, angry, and devoid of emotions: the sort of production that is done by rote memorization with lack of pacing. Nevertheless, the negatives don't diminish the film as a whole.

28323,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,078061755X,Daddy,"[0, 0]","Shine is a masterpiece of storytelling. It is the true story of David Helfgott, a child prodigy pianist, who suffered a psychological breakdown and lost himself. The film begins with David as an adult (played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush) and quickly flashes back to David's childhood, and we see the strain put upon David by his overbearing abusive father. Then, the middle of the film takes us through David's life as a young adult (played by Noah Taylor), in school. Here, we see signs of his emtional and mental derangement. There is a scene where he goes to retrieve a letter from a public mailbox, oblivious to the fact that he is naked from the waist down.  While trying to perform Rachmoninov's 3rd concerto - a piece of music which, according to his mentor/teacher (played masterfully by Sir John Gielgud) is maddening to play - David has a collapse, which leads to him lose his mind and turn in on himself. Later, the film returns to David as an older man. Because of his breakdown, he goes from one home to another, or stays with a friend. One night, he visits a tavern and impresses the crowd with a brilliant performance of Flight Of The Bumblebee on the piano. A woman at the bar befriends him and eventually offers him a place to stay, and through her, he meets his future wife (played wonderfully by Lynn Redgrave).  The story is far more involved than my brief summary. But, you get the idea.  The performances in this film are all outstanding. Rush won an Academy Award (and I think a Golden Globe Award too). Noah Taylor should have also won an award... his performance as young David was a brilliant work.  This movie is an award-winner and well worth the acclaim. It's a masterpiece.

I do hope that ""Shine"" is re-released with more in- depth features, including something that focuses on David Hefgott, the pianist that this movie is based on. I truly hope the decision is made to interview or document Helfgott in some way. That's the only reason I deducted a star, because the movie is outstanding. I would urge those who enjoyed this film to contact FineLine Pictures, who released the movie, and urge them to create a special edition DVD to include this.The real David Helfgott actually contributed as a musician (pianist, of course) for this wonderful film about his life, dramatizing his struggles through his childhood and breakdown as an adolescent. Yet it isn't about gloomy and depressing accounts but about survival and living to the best of one's abilities. Those who have little patience with people who are schizophrenic may become a bit uneasy at the performance of Geoffrey Rush who played the adult Helfgott. Rush's acting was impeccable and very believable, which is why some might be a little agitated or confused at the stuttering and incomplete and rambling dialog by Rush's character.But have patience in getting to understand Helfgott as the movie progresses. It can confuse the viewer since there are flashbacks and flash forwards. But you know, this was one beautifully produced movie. It has had high replay, because the film simply touches the heart. Just relax and allow the movie (and Helfgott's character) absorb you. By the end, you'll really FEEL how much of a journey that David Helfgott traveled to arrive where he did.And for those who enjoy Lynn Redgrave, my gosh. Her portrayal of Gillian was superb. Redgrave didn't even get any type of top billing and she didn't appear until late in the movie, yet I felt like Gillian and David were my own family by the end.The DVD's special features include a movie trailer, a video clip of an award presented to Rush (look for Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise together in the audience) and a somewhat unusually- formatted Q/A with director Scott Hicks (about a dozen questions are displayed and when you select one, a video with an answer by Hicks plays).""Shine"" wasn't meant to be a tearjerker movie, but it got to me.

It is very nearly too excellent to rate. One needs more than a boatload of stars to rate it. So I guess we are going to need a bigger boat tin which to place all of the stars needed to rate this movie.What can one say? Here we have a child prodigy growing up in a lower middle class Australian family with an over-bearing father who survived the holocaust. Auschwitz has taught him only two things, both of which he became neurotic about: that only the strong win and that winning is everything. The exact wrong lessons to earn from Hitler. These lessons manifested themselves as a ""control neurosis"" compelling him to control his family with an iron hand and at all cost -- that if it were his own survival imperative. It is these two well-meaning issues running in the subtext of the Helfgott family life that in the end undoes and destroys the family and the mind of the child prodigy.Because he comes up second best in a piano competition where he tries to play a piece much too difficult for his immature brain and skill, his father turns his anger on him and refuses to allow him to accept a scholarship to the U.S. This accumulation of defeats and rejections is too much for the youngster and from there on he chooses to make his own decisions about his career and finding his way in life,As a result, David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush) is ejected from the home and the family. His mind is too fragile to survive both the shock of this excommunication, and the pain of losing a local piano competition; but most of all in not being able to earn and maintain his father's approval. In a short while, this abandonment and accumulated problems leads to him to a mental hospital.Eventually he picks himself up dusts himself off, moves out of the hospital, finds an old piano and rehabilitates himself through the only thing he has mastery over, practicing and playing the piano. One night, in the rain he wanders into a piano bar without a piano player and tinkers for a while before he lets loose on Rimsky- Korsakov's ""The Flight of the Bumble Bee"" and in the process electrifies the small audience.  This self-arranged audition gets him a job, a place to stay and a new family of friends and admirers.  As his confidence grows, he builds up to attacking his real nemesis, the piece that help send him to the mental institution: Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 in ""D"" Minor, opus 30, menacingly referred to as ""Rach 3."" With the support of his new found friends he slowly works his way back into the classical music's inner circle and gets to play ""Rach 3"" in a concert where he redeems himself and overcomes his father's hex. His mental health is nearly completely restored. 100 stars",5,"Rich, Dense, Multilayered, Complex, poignant and Compelling",1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,2804,"['Remember', 'Jaws', 'where', 'Captain', 'are', 'going', 'need', 'bigger', 'boat', 'same', 'applies', 'movie', 'very', 'nearly', 'too', 'excellent', 'rate', 'One', 'more', 'boatload', 'stars', 'rate', 'So', 'guess', 'are', 'going', 'need', 'bigger', 'boat', 'tin', 'place', 'stars', 'needed', 'rate', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'Here', 'have', 'child', 'prodigy', 'growing', 'up', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'Australian', 'family', 'over-bearing', 'father', 'who', 'survived', 'holocaust', 'Auschwitz', 'taught', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'became', 'neurotic', 'only', 'strong', 'win', 'winning', 'everything', 'exact', 'wrong', 'lessons', 'earn', 'Hitler', 'lessons', 'manifested', 'control', 'neurosis', 'compelling', 'control', 'family', 'iron', 'hand', 'cost', 'were', 'own', 'survival', 'imperative', 'two', 'well-meaning', 'issues', 'running', 'subtext', 'Helfgott', 'family', 'life', 'end', 'undoes', 'family', 'mind', 'child', 'up', 'second', 'best', 'piano', 'competition', 'where', 'play', 'piece', 'much', 'too', 'difficult', 'immature', 'brain', 'skill', 'father', 'anger', 'allow', 'accept', 'scholarship', 'U.S', 'accumulation', 'defeats', 'rejections', 'too', 'much', 'youngster', 'there', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'career', 'finding', 'way', 'life', 'result', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'ejected', 'home', 'family', 'mind', 'too', 'fragile', 'survive', 'shock', 'excommunication', 'pain', 'losing', 'local', 'piano', 'competition', 'most', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'earn', 'maintain', 'father', 'approval', 'short', 'while', 'abandonment', 'accumulated', 'problems', 'mental', 'hospital.Eventually', 'up', 'dusts', 'off', 'hospital', 'old', 'piano', 'only', 'thing', 'mastery', 'practicing', 'playing', 'piano', 'One', 'night', 'rain', 'piano', 'bar', 'piano', 'player', 'tinkers', 'while', 'loose', 'Rimsky-', 'Korsakov', 'Flight', 'Bumble', 'Bee', 'process', 'small', 'audience', 'self-arranged', 'audition', 'job', 'place', 'stay', 'new', 'family', 'friends', 'admirers', 'confidence', 'grows', 'attacking', 'real', 'nemesis', 'piece', 'help', 'send', 'mental', 'institution', 'Rachmaninoff', 'Piano', 'Concerto', 'No', '3', 'D', 'Minor', '30', 'menacingly', 'referred', 'Rach', '3', 'support', 'new', 'found', 'friends', 'slowly', 'way', 'back', 'classical', 'music', 'inner', 'circle', 'play', 'Rach', '3', 'concert', 'where', 'overcomes', 'father', 'hex', 'mental', 'health', 'nearly', 'completely', 'restored', '100', 'stars']",N/A
28329,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,078061755X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 3]","That's a marvelous but cruel film. Cruel to us in its beauty. Cruel to David in his complete estrangement from the world of noise lost that he is in his world of music. How can you be deaf to anything but music? It is possible, even if that sounds crazy, if that is a mental lunacy. The film tries to get us to two conclusions. The first one is that a father can be right but only for a short while. A son has to get away from his father as soon as he can otherwise he might be destroyed, utterly destroyed. In this case he is only mentally destroyed. He loses the sense of time and even space probably. Time does not exist any more, which is not serious in itself; many people can live without time. But duration, goes away too and that is unbearable. When life does not have any duration any more it does not exist any longer and it becomes so static that it may drown you completely. David Helfgott is saved from his predicament, first by one decision: to go away from his father when he gets a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. Then by the phenomenal teacher he gets in London that accepts his decision to play Rachmaninoff in the Albert Hall, what his father wanted him to play when he was still a child. The connection of the father and his curse, the composer and his own predicament, and his emotion that he projects into the music, the place and his father's absence, all that does it: he loses the sound of the world, though not of the music, he loses the sense of duration and he falls into a complete vacuum, a mental hospital. He will be taken out of it by a simple lady who plays the piano for the patients, and then from this to that he will find a bar where he will be able to perform day after day and build a reputation that will attract people and one woman will accept to redeem him to life and marry him into a new career in the Albert Hall again for a second triumph, this time with no escape possible from the stage and success. And that is the second lesson. When you run away from your father and you lose him in the process, you lose any and all sense of reality that can only come back to you from inside and by accepting to bring that inside world of yours out. But you need some helping hands along the way, helping hands you have to negotiate and find all by yourself. And David did it. The son of the super poor surviving Jew exiled in Australia after the war was able to reach the sky and be some kind of an angel up there in the sunrise dancing in mid air as if he were on a trampoline. This optimism is refreshing because we all know too many people who did not end up like that. For one of these victims of life that manages to get through, so many will never even be able to raise their eyes and look at the stars.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Fathers have to be estranged from their sons.,1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,2905,"['marvelous', 'cruel', 'film', 'Cruel', 'beauty', 'Cruel', 'David', 'complete', 'estrangement', 'world', 'noise', 'lost', 'world', 'music', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'deaf', 'anything', 'music', 'possible', 'even', 'crazy', 'mental', 'lunacy', 'film', 'tries', 'get', 'two', 'conclusions', 'first', 'one', 'father', 'can', 'be', 'right', 'only', 'short', 'while', 'son', 'get', 'away', 'father', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'otherwise', 'might', 'be', 'destroyed', 'utterly', 'destroyed', 'case', 'only', 'mentally', 'destroyed', 'sense', 'time', 'even', 'space', 'probably', 'Time', 'not', 'exist', 'more', 'not', 'serious', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'live', 'time', 'duration', 'away', 'too', 'unbearable', 'When', 'life', 'not', 'have', 'duration', 'more', 'not', 'exist', 'longer', 'so', 'static', 'may', 'drown', 'completely', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'saved', 'predicament', 'first', 'one', 'decision', 'go', 'away', 'father', 'when', 'scholarship', 'Royal', 'Academy', 'Music', 'London', 'Then', 'phenomenal', 'teacher', 'London', 'decision', 'play', 'Rachmaninoff', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'what', 'father', 'wanted', 'play', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'child', 'connection', 'father', 'curse', 'composer', 'own', 'predicament', 'emotion', 'projects', 'music', 'place', 'father', 'absence', 'sound', 'world', 'not', 'music', 'sense', 'duration', 'complete', 'vacuum', 'mental', 'hospital', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'simple', 'lady', 'who', 'piano', 'patients', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'bar', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'perform', 'day', 'day', 'build', 'reputation', 'will', 'attract', 'people', 'one', 'woman', 'will', 'accept', 'redeem', 'life', 'marry', 'new', 'career', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'again', 'second', 'triumph', 'time', 'escape', 'possible', 'stage', 'success', 'second', 'lesson', 'When', 'run', 'away', 'father', 'lose', 'process', 'lose', 'sense', 'reality', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'back', 'accepting', 'bring', 'inside', 'world', 'yours', 'out', 'need', 'helping', 'hands', 'way', 'helping', 'hands', 'have', 'negotiate', 'find', 'David', 'did', 'son', 'super', 'poor', 'surviving', 'Jew', 'exiled', 'Australia', 'war', 'was', 'able', 'reach', 'sky', 'be', 'kind', 'angel', 'up', 'there', 'sunrise', 'dancing', 'mid', 'air', 'were', 'trampoline', 'optimism', 'refreshing', 'know', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'victims', 'life', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'will', 'never', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'raise', 'eyes', 'look', 'stars.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

Argiri,"[8, 12]","Brilliantly performed, emotionally appealing to the max...it's important to remember that the plotline in this film is, to be tactful, heavily fictionalized. If enjoyment alone were a just measure, I'd give it five stars, but available facts indicate that it is not just heavily fictionalized but exceedingly unfair to some individuals in David Helfgott's original family circle.  His dad, Peter Helfgott, is characterized as a prim and prissy monster who uses the Holocaust to justify all the tyranny he exercises in his grim and nasty little household. However, this scenario does not seem to have been literally true at any time, and bipolar illness such as Helfgott seems to have suffered does not require the undermining effect of an abusive parent, just an unfortunate heredity. Only logic of a specially American and sentimental kind demands a monstrous parent as the cause of this effect.I'm sorry to say I swallowed the plot whole the first time I saw it. It's that effective and affecting, but feels manipulative after garnering a few of the facts...I don't particularly enjoy enjoying something that perpetrates vicious calumny against a real individual who seems to have done nothing to deserve it. Shine does have absolutely brilliant imagery, such as the shots of Geoffrey Rush as David Helfgott in the unbounded joy of full manic flight, jumping on a trampoline, and fine acting...Lynn Redgrave's Gillian casting David's astrological chart on her PC and deciding to marry him, which decision can be seen in the slight arching of her brow before she slips off the big diamond ring she's recently accepted from another man.  If the director could have operated on the premise that David's illness was tragic and his talent was great, and that Gillian's love for him was idiosyncratic and absolute WITHOUT adding a pseudo-Dickensian villain to the mix, Shine would be in the same luminous category as A Beautiful Mind.",3,Take with a whole handful of salt in your popcorn...,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,1930,"['Brilliantly', 'performed', 'emotionally', 'appealing', 'max', 'important', 'remember', 'plotline', 'film', 'be', 'tactful', 'heavily', 'fictionalized', 'enjoyment', 'alone', 'were', 'just', 'measure', ""'d"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'available', 'facts', 'indicate', 'not', 'just', 'heavily', 'fictionalized', 'exceedingly', 'unfair', 'individuals', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'original', 'family', 'circle', 'dad', 'Peter', 'Helfgott', 'characterized', 'prim', 'prissy', 'monster', 'who', 'Holocaust', 'justify', 'tyranny', 'grim', 'nasty', 'little', 'household', 'However', 'scenario', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'literally', 'true', 'time', 'bipolar', 'illness', 'such', 'Helfgott', 'have', 'suffered', 'not', 'require', 'undermining', 'effect', 'abusive', 'parent', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'heredity', 'Only', 'logic', 'specially', 'American', 'sentimental', 'kind', 'monstrous', 'parent', 'cause', 'effect.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'swallowed', 'plot', 'whole', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'effective', 'affecting', 'feels', 'manipulative', 'garnering', 'few', 'facts', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'enjoying', 'something', 'vicious', 'calumny', 'real', 'individual', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'deserve', 'Shine', 'have', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'imagery', 'such', 'shots', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'unbounded', 'joy', 'full', 'manic', 'flight', 'jumping', 'trampoline', 'fine', 'acting', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Gillian', 'casting', 'David', 'astrological', 'chart', 'PC', 'deciding', 'marry', 'decision', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'slight', 'arching', 'brow', 'big', 'diamond', 'ring', 'recently', 'accepted', 'man', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'operated', 'premise', 'David', 'illness', 'was', 'tragic', 'talent', 'was', 'great', 'Gillian', 'love', 'was', 'idiosyncratic', 'absolute', 'WITHOUT', 'adding', 'pseudo-Dickensian', 'villain', 'mix', 'Shine', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'luminous', 'category', 'Beautiful', 'Mind']",N/A

28349,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,078061755X,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[9, 11]","Shine tells the true story of child genius pianist David Helfgott who suffers physical and mental abuse through his overbearing father (Armin Mueller Stahl) until he finally manages to escape to university in London.  However, his childhood still bearing over him along with the pressures of having to do well force his eccentricities to breaking point until he suffers a mental breakdown after performing Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 3 in D Minor.  Spending his early adult years in an institution it isn't until he meets Lynn Redgrave, an astrologist, and starts up playing the piano at a local bar that David realises his true potential.For years now the true life saga has been marred by criticism for being inaccurate or overly sensationalist.  Witness the good but ultimately incredibly flawed (despite superb performances) Beautiful Mind from a couple of years ago.  Play around with the material and you will only garner mixed reviews.  Even movies about madness seem to have a certain stigma attached to them simply due to the fact that many seem tailored towards the star.  Neither of these is the case with Shine, an understated and therefore touching and genuine movie from Australia.  Whilst the main theme of overcoming all obstacles to realise the person that you can be may sound clich&eacute;d, it is here done incredibly well by all concerned.  It's slow-burning, which might put a few people off, but the emotional pay-off is intense and even though this won't make you cry (something that appears to be almost requisite for a genre that often suffocates in sentimentality) it's certainly intelligent and makes you think.A lot of what makes Shine such an impressive view of madness os down to some superb performances from Noah Taylor (Flirting) and Geoffrey Rush (Lantana) as the teenage and adult David respectively.  The character progression is among the best I've seen in the last few years on film, ensuring constantly that madness is never reduced to a mere stereotype.  Rush's performance was deservedly Oscar-winning, although Taylor is every bit as good as you watch David's eccentricities gradually become more and more detatched from reality.  The fact that the filmmakers can then mould this into a sympathetic character that is starting to overcome his own insanity is very good indeed.  Also worthy of mention is Lynn Redgrave as David's future wife, who puts in an understated performance to go with a decidedly understated movie that is all the better for it.

28350,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,078061755X,Octavius,"[5, 7]","This film portrays the fictionalized account of pianist David Helfgott and the woes he suffered at being a piano prodigy from an early age.  A film that is somewhat uplifting but really over-the-top as to the merits of the main character, his life, and his accomplishments when compared to the lives of other professional musicians and composers.The film takes poetic license in showing how David Helfgott's gift for performing on the piano was frustrated by an abusive father and instant fame.  The film goes back in time and shows how David became a Rachmaninoff virtuoso but how the pressures of public performance and instant fame forced him to retreat back into a secluded private life.  David's talents and desire for publicity reemerge after performing for a small crowd at a bar and encountering his future spouse.  Although the film is relatively well done, David Helfott is an unsympathetic character who is overly neurotic, uncommunicative, arrogant, and altogether hostile.  Unlike the lives of great composers or other great musicians, there is nothing exceptional about Helfott's personality or accomplishments to make his unpleasant traits palletable.  He is not a Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Wagner, etc., whose vices and misdeeds can be forgiven due to their genius and unique contributions to the arts.  In short, although Helfott certainly has talent at performing on the piano, there is really nothing about him or his performances that equate him either at or above the level of other pianists such as Rubinstein, Lupu, Brendel, Perriah, etc.  The dramatic life and trials of Spielman during WWII in Polanski's ""The Pianist"" was a true story far more deserving of being put on film than Helfott's which, in comparison, seems pretty mundane.This is somewhat of an uplifting story about how fame and attention are too much for those that are overly eccentric and have a demanding father as a music tutor.  Otherwise, there is nothing particularly spectacular about David Helfgott, his personality, or his skills as a pianist that make this film shine through.  The only things shining bright here are the exaggerations as to the ""tragedies"" of the artist's life making him a rather unsympathetic hero when all is said and done.  When compared to the tragic lives of other performers such as Jaqueline du Pr&eacute;, I don't find this dramatic biographical exaggeration to be anything special to make a movie stand out.  Cellist Jaqueline du Pr&eacute; had her life and artistic career cut tragically short by M.S. from which she later died and the film covering her life was a great depiction of her triumphs and painful end.  Such tragedies make David Helfgott seem as little more than an overconfident prodigy who had an emotional breakdown when he realized, at the critical moment of a public performance, that he wasn't shining brightly enough to be a public performer in the spotlight afterall.  Too bad!  Why should anyone really care?  There's always serious pressure and competition in these circles and life isn't always fair!  In the end, his life's hurdles as a professional musician weren't exceptionally harder to overcome than those overcome by other professional musicians or composers.  In that light, David Helfgott's relatively mundane life and minimal fame as a pianist hardly seem to be worth making a movie about.",3,Shining Brightly Only in the Light of Fiction,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,3352,"['film', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'pianist', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'woes', 'suffered', 'being', 'piano', 'prodigy', 'early', 'age', 'film', 'somewhat', 'uplifting', 'really', 'over-the-top', 'merits', 'main', 'character', 'life', 'accomplishments', 'when', 'compared', 'lives', 'other', 'professional', 'musicians', 'composers.The', 'film', 'poetic', 'license', 'showing', 'how', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'gift', 'performing', 'piano', 'was', 'frustrated', 'abusive', 'father', 'instant', 'fame', 'film', 'back', 'time', 'how', 'David', 'became', 'Rachmaninoff', 'virtuoso', 'how', 'pressures', 'public', 'performance', 'instant', 'fame', 'forced', 'retreat', 'back', 'secluded', 'private', 'life', 'David', 'talents', 'desire', 'publicity', 'reemerge', 'performing', 'small', 'crowd', 'bar', 'encountering', 'future', 'spouse', 'film', 'relatively', 'well', 'done', 'David', 'Helfott', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'who', 'overly', 'neurotic', 'uncommunicative', 'arrogant', 'altogether', 'hostile', 'lives', 'great', 'composers', 'other', 'great', 'musicians', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'Helfott', 'personality', 'accomplishments', 'make', 'unpleasant', 'traits', 'palletable', 'not', 'Mozart', 'Beethoven', 'Chopin', 'Wagner', 'etc.', 'vices', 'misdeeds', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'due', 'genius', 'unique', 'contributions', 'arts', 'short', 'Helfott', 'certainly', 'talent', 'performing', 'piano', 'really', 'nothing', 'performances', 'equate', 'level', 'other', 'pianists', 'such', 'Rubinstein', 'Lupu', 'Brendel', 'Perriah', 'etc', 'dramatic', 'life', 'trials', 'Spielman', 'WWII', 'Polanski', 'Pianist', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'deserving', 'being', 'put', 'film', 'Helfott', 'comparison', 'pretty', 'mundane.This', 'somewhat', 'uplifting', 'story', 'how', 'fame', 'attention', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'overly', 'eccentric', 'have', 'demanding', 'father', 'music', 'tutor', 'Otherwise', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'spectacular', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'personality', 'skills', 'pianist', 'make', 'film', 'shine', 'only', 'things', 'shining', 'bright', 'here', 'are', 'exaggerations', 'tragedies', 'artist', 'life', 'making', 'rather', 'unsympathetic', 'hero', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'When', 'compared', 'tragic', 'lives', 'other', 'performers', 'such', 'Jaqueline', 'du', 'Pr', 'eacute', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'dramatic', 'biographical', 'exaggeration', 'be', 'anything', 'special', 'make', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'Cellist', 'Jaqueline', 'du', 'Pr', 'eacute', 'had', 'life', 'artistic', 'career', 'cut', 'tragically', 'short', 'M.S', 'later', 'died', 'film', 'covering', 'life', 'was', 'great', 'depiction', 'triumphs', 'painful', 'end', 'Such', 'tragedies', 'make', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'seem', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'overconfident', 'prodigy', 'who', 'had', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'when', 'realized', 'critical', 'moment', 'public', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'shining', 'brightly', 'enough', 'be', 'public', 'performer', 'spotlight', 'afterall', 'Too', 'bad', 'Why', 'should', 'anyone', 'really', 'care', 'always', 'serious', 'pressure', 'competition', 'circles', 'life', ""n't"", 'always', 'fair', 'end', 'life', 'hurdles', 'professional', 'musician', 'were', ""n't"", 'exceptionally', 'harder', 'overcome', 'overcome', 'other', 'professional', 'musicians', 'composers', 'light', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'relatively', 'mundane', 'life', 'minimal', 'fame', 'pianist', 'hardly', 'seem', 'be', 'worth', 'making', 'movie']",N/A

28353,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,078061755X,R.A. McKenzie,"[11, 12]","Before I watched this movie yesterday, I knew this was Geoffrey Rush's Oscar-winning performance, that Joel Siegiel considered it to be one the greatest movies ever, and that it won plenty of trophies.  But I had no idea what the movie was actually about.  I'd seen no trailers and knew very little about the actors' resume (even Rush's movies I can only count to about 10).  So I was fortunate to watch this DVD with a fresh perspective.This is the fall-and-rise (that's not a typo) of David Helfgott, a very gifted pianist who is trained since he was a boy by his deeply disturbed father Peter.  Eventually, after enduring unbearable turmoil within the family, teenage Helfgott attends the Royal College of Music, and practiced Ragmaninoff's ""Rach 3"" (supposedly the most difficult piece in the world) with such determination and focus that he perfected the technique, while the emotional ride eventually broke him.  When the movie first introduces us to Helfgott, he is a rambling confused man, who finds his way back into a small Australian restaurant and starts joyfully playing the piano.If this sounds like another version of ""A Beautiful Mind,"" have no fear.  This movie wisely ignores the psychological talk, and focuses on the emotions of the characters.  ""Shine"" does not care about what's going on inside David's mind; instead, we see how his somewhat abusive childhood and unattended confusion affects his interaction with the world around him.  The facial expressions tell the story, not doctors' diagnoses (which there is none).  Armin Mueller-Stahl's performance as Peter Helfgott is absolutely marvelous.  He is a man capable of loving his son, but is so intense (and sometimes violent) that he can't embrace his gifted son the way David needs.  John Gielgud gives another great performance as David's College professor, who also pushes David to reach his potential, but with more balance and affection than Peter does.  Lynn Redgrave is also excellent as the woman who befriends and helps heal (in a way) David.  Geoffrey Rush is terrific in ""Shine,"" but the movie could've better defined him.  You see, Rush is kind of the lead role, but we don't really get into his performance until the second half of the movie.  We begin ""Shine"" by seeing this bizarre, over-friendly stranger who wanders into a cafe -- we're supposed to think, ""Who is this baffling man?""  I actually find Noah Taylor's turn as the teenage David more compelling and moving than Rush's portion of the character.  Which is probably why I don't like this movie quite as much as most do.You see, ""Shine"" is actually two stories.  The first act focuses on the tension between David and Peter.  This is very well-executed, because Mueller-Stahl's intensity opposite Taylor's innocence and desperation is absolutely amazing.  Even when the two characters aren't together, you can still feel the anger and conflict.  David and Peter must have felt those same strong emotions...day after day, night after night.The second story is Rush's half of the film, when the grown-up David Helfgott is trying to cope with the world now that he is alone.  Director Scott Hicks makes it very clear that the people in David's life helped him reassimilate into the world, but what about David's efforts?  Instead of feeling genuinely moved, there are times when adult David is used simply as a mentally-damaged man who has difficulty compiling a comprehensive thought.  We share the frustration and test-of-patience the characterx feel, but it's almost too effective.  When Peter coldly tells his rambling son, ""Get to the point,"" the monstrous antagonist became my hero for a brief moment.  The second half of ""Shine"" is several genres of movies crammed into a hour-length.Don't get me wrong...this is a well-made movie.  There are no plots holes or character inconsistencies whatsoever.  Hicks has great control of the camera and wonderful attention to the simplest detail.  His timing is dead-on, and listening to his interviews on the DVD merits a second viewing.  I just felt that the comeback part of the movie needed more story.  This movie is only 105 minutes including credits.  With actors like this, I would've gladly taken a 2-hour picture.However, Rush and Redgrave are still heart-warming in their roles.  When the world applauses David's skills in a concert, and we see his tears, we are relieved that pain and suffering have ended...even if for only a brief moment in time.  Very few films invoke a stronger sense of hope.FINAL NOTE - If you're wondering why the movie is called ""Shine,"" Scott Hicks answers that question on the DVD.  But you should watch it for yourself, because you'll understand soon enough.",4,"""SHINE"" - For the Most Part, It Does",1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,4694,"['watched', 'movie', 'yesterday', 'knew', 'was', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Joel', 'Siegiel', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'won', 'plenty', 'trophies', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', ""'d"", 'seen', 'trailers', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'actors', 'resume', 'even', 'Rush', 'movies', 'can', 'only', 'count', '10', 'was', 'fortunate', 'watch', 'DVD', 'fresh', 'perspective.This', 'fall-and-rise', 'not', 'typo', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'very', 'gifted', 'pianist', 'who', 'trained', 'was', 'boy', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'father', 'Peter', 'Eventually', 'enduring', 'unbearable', 'turmoil', 'family', 'teenage', 'Helfgott', 'Royal', 'College', 'Music', 'practiced', 'Ragmaninoff', 'Rach', '3', 'supposedly', 'most', 'difficult', 'piece', 'world', 'such', 'determination', 'focus', 'perfected', 'technique', 'emotional', 'ride', 'eventually', 'broke', 'When', 'movie', 'first', 'Helfgott', 'rambling', 'confused', 'man', 'who', 'way', 'back', 'small', 'Australian', 'restaurant', 'joyfully', 'playing', 'piano.If', 'version', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'have', 'fear', 'movie', 'wisely', 'psychological', 'talk', 'emotions', 'characters', 'Shine', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'going', 'David', 'mind', 'instead', 'see', 'how', 'somewhat', 'abusive', 'childhood', 'unattended', 'confusion', 'interaction', 'world', 'facial', 'expressions', 'tell', 'story', 'not', 'doctors', 'diagnoses', 'none', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'performance', 'Peter', 'Helfgott', 'absolutely', 'marvelous', 'man', 'capable', 'loving', 'son', 'so', 'intense', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'embrace', 'gifted', 'son', 'way', 'David', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'great', 'performance', 'David', 'College', 'professor', 'who', 'also', 'David', 'reach', 'potential', 'more', 'balance', 'affection', 'Peter', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'also', 'excellent', 'woman', 'who', 'heal', 'way', 'David', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'terrific', 'Shine', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'better', 'defined', 'see', 'Rush', 'kind', 'lead', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'performance', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'begin', 'Shine', 'seeing', 'bizarre', 'over-friendly', 'stranger', 'who', 'cafe', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'Who', 'baffling', 'man', 'actually', 'find', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'turn', 'teenage', 'David', 'more', 'compelling', 'moving', 'Rush', 'portion', 'character', 'Which', 'probably', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'most', 'do.You', 'see', 'Shine', 'actually', 'two', 'stories', 'first', 'act', 'tension', 'David', 'Peter', 'very', 'well-executed', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'intensity', 'opposite', 'Taylor', 'innocence', 'desperation', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'Even', 'when', 'two', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'together', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'anger', 'conflict', 'David', 'Peter', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'same', 'strong', 'emotions', 'day', 'day', 'night', 'night.The', 'second', 'story', 'Rush', 'half', 'film', 'when', 'grown-up', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'trying', 'cope', 'world', 'now', 'alone', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'very', 'clear', 'people', 'David', 'life', 'helped', 'reassimilate', 'world', 'what', 'David', 'efforts', 'Instead', 'feeling', 'genuinely', 'moved', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'adult', 'David', 'used', 'simply', 'mentally-damaged', 'man', 'who', 'difficulty', 'compiling', 'comprehensive', 'thought', 'share', 'frustration', 'test-of-patience', 'characterx', 'feel', 'almost', 'too', 'effective', 'When', 'Peter', 'coldly', 'rambling', 'son', 'Get', 'point', 'monstrous', 'antagonist', 'became', 'hero', 'brief', 'moment', 'second', 'half', 'Shine', 'several', 'genres', 'movies', 'crammed', 'hour-length.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'well-made', 'movie', 'are', 'plots', 'holes', 'character', 'inconsistencies', 'whatsoever', 'Hicks', 'great', 'control', 'camera', 'wonderful', 'attention', 'simplest', 'detail', 'timing', 'dead-on', 'listening', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'second', 'viewing', 'just', 'felt', 'comeback', 'part', 'movie', 'needed', 'more', 'story', 'movie', 'only', '105', 'minutes', 'including', 'credits', 'actors', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gladly', 'taken', '2-hour', 'picture.However', 'Rush', 'Redgrave', 'are', 'still', 'heart-warming', 'roles', 'When', 'world', 'David', 'skills', 'concert', 'see', 'tears', 'are', 'relieved', 'pain', 'suffering', 'have', 'ended', 'even', 'only', 'brief', 'moment', 'time', 'Very', 'few', 'films', 'invoke', 'stronger', 'sense', 'hope.FINAL', 'NOTE', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'movie', 'called', 'Shine', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'answers', 'question', 'DVD', 'should', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'soon', 'enough']",N/A

I think of the beauty of the music and imagination it generates."" ~David HelfgottComic and profound, Shine reaches into the heart of what every meaningful movie seems to embody. The underlying currents are dark and cold, but the heights reach for a much more breezy mood and playful appeal. As a child prodigy struggles to live his life and please his father, he finds ways to survive even when his mind is drenched in obsessions and his life is a series of creative adventures.As if he can't contain the creativity it jumps from him in moments of inspired greatness. The way this story is woven together on screen is especially entertaining and you can't help but cry, laugh and be pleasantly surprised by the moments of inappropriate yet hilarious behavior. When David Helfgott speaks it is fast and furiously with his mind making connections in a very intriguing fashion.One of the brilliant moments is when Sir John Gielgud is shouting: ""You have to tame the piano..."" David Helfgott does more than tame the piano, he gives the piano a heart and the way he plays can be exciting, tense, relaxing, dreamy, intense, heart-sigh beautiful or even soul stirring and profound. You live in anticipation as classical music springs to life from his fingers. When he moves to London to study at the Royal College of music, he suffers more from his illness and seems to be at a breaking point from which he won't recover.This story of an Australian Pianist with an almost bipolar lifestyle shows the intricacies of survival within an illness. At times, the places he lives are left in shambles as he follows one joy to the next. Shine has profound movies of brilliance, beautiful heartfelt scenes and a dark side that creates a struggle until the moment of redemption in the rapturous standing ovation. Shine had my full attention and took me on a wild emotional ride into the eccentric David Helfgott's world of joyful child-like expression.Artistic license seems to run freely through this movie and the director may indulge in docudrama in places. In the end, you may just want to set aside the controversy and enjoy this for the beauty and connection. In the end, it is love that saves us all from ourselves and makes life a worthwhile adventure. Shine succeeds on so many levels, where so many other movies fail. My heart was completely captured and I feel that if all people care about is how his father was portrayed, they sadly missed the entire point of the story.~The Rebecca Review",5,Radiant Return from the Abyss,1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,2624,"['paradise', 'perform', 'front', 'audience', 'feel', 'one', 'audience', 'have', 'image', 'thoughts', 'think', 'beauty', 'music', 'imagination', '~David', 'HelfgottComic', 'profound', 'Shine', 'heart', 'what', 'meaningful', 'movie', 'embody', 'underlying', 'currents', 'are', 'dark', 'cold', 'heights', 'reach', 'much', 'more', 'breezy', 'mood', 'playful', 'appeal', 'child', 'prodigy', 'live', 'life', 'please', 'father', 'ways', 'survive', 'even', 'when', 'mind', 'drenched', 'obsessions', 'life', 'series', 'creative', 'adventures.As', 'ca', ""n't"", 'contain', 'creativity', 'moments', 'inspired', 'greatness', 'way', 'story', 'woven', 'together', 'screen', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cry', 'laugh', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'moments', 'inappropriate', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'behavior', 'When', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'fast', 'furiously', 'mind', 'making', 'connections', 'very', 'intriguing', 'fashion.One', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'when', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'shouting', 'have', 'tame', 'piano', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'more', 'tame', 'piano', 'piano', 'heart', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'exciting', 'tense', 'relaxing', 'dreamy', 'intense', 'heart-sigh', 'beautiful', 'even', 'soul', 'stirring', 'profound', 'live', 'anticipation', 'classical', 'music', 'springs', 'life', 'fingers', 'When', 'London', 'study', 'Royal', 'College', 'music', 'more', 'illness', 'be', 'breaking', 'point', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recover.This', 'story', 'Australian', 'Pianist', 'almost', 'bipolar', 'lifestyle', 'intricacies', 'survival', 'illness', 'times', 'places', 'are', 'left', 'shambles', 'one', 'joy', 'next', 'Shine', 'profound', 'movies', 'brilliance', 'beautiful', 'heartfelt', 'scenes', 'dark', 'side', 'struggle', 'moment', 'redemption', 'rapturous', 'standing', 'ovation', 'Shine', 'had', 'full', 'attention', 'took', 'wild', 'emotional', 'ride', 'eccentric', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'world', 'joyful', 'child-like', 'expression.Artistic', 'license', 'run', 'freely', 'movie', 'director', 'may', 'indulge', 'docudrama', 'places', 'end', 'may', 'just', 'want', 'set', 'aside', 'controversy', 'enjoy', 'beauty', 'connection', 'end', 'ourselves', 'life', 'worthwhile', 'adventure', 'Shine', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'fail', 'heart', 'was', 'completely', 'captured', 'feel', 'people', 'care', 'how', 'father', 'was', 'portrayed', 'sadly', 'missed', 'entire', 'point', 'story.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

Practicing night and day allows him to overcome this obstacle- but at a heavy price- it is indelibly etched in his soul.He descends into maddness- in which he continually fingers Rachmaninoff, and even starts speaking in a fast, stuttering fashion (perhaps based on the piece), forgets 'important' things such as putting on his clothes.While David never fully overcomes his illness, it doesn't matter.  As the film moves on, it becomes clear that neither his father nor Rachmaninoff 3 could conquer his ebullient spirit.  Returning to the piano years later (by wandering into a bar) he wins instant recognition for his virtuoso performance.  Later, his charming but humble personality delights a wealthy astrologist, Gillian Murray.  They marry, and with her support he returns to the concert scene, and fame.  More importantly, he lives with joy- not being afraid of jumping up and down on a trampoline or running with abandon on the beach, or putting his shoes on backward.Peter Helfgott wanted his son to win piano competitions.
