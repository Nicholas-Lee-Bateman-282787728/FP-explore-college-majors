This film (and yes I said film because of it's live action feel)strikes at the core of Wonder Woman with brute force and modern appeal. The movie brings DCs greatest heroine to life with vivid animation that captures the best of your favorite comic book frames. Awesome animation. The characters are so substance rich that you'll forget your watching a ""cartoon"".Digging deep into the origin of Wonder Woman the film- makers have fun creating believable landscapes while holding to the mythical charms that endear us to the chracter of Wonder Woman. To put it plainly , Wonder Woman kicks a*s and does so with plain spoken angst.The movie even dabbles in giving us Wonder Womans approach to some of todays females while holding to true femininity. Great writing all around with audio that is completely in sync. This animated triumph gives hope to the Wonder Woman fan who is salivating for a serious live action film.

1214350,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B001LK8SKW,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[2, 3]","I give the WONDER WOMAN TWO-DVD SET a generous 5-stars because I'm glad this favorite super hero of mine, finally gets the recognition she deserves with her own animated movie.That's not to say that this movie or the updated character of Wonder Woman is without flaws.The action and the animation is really good, but as some other reviewers noted some scenes are graphic showing blood and killings, and so if you have small kids it might disturb them. I thought that those scenes were appropriate, but I'm an adult.And I found the story a little odd as well because the big battle happens between the amazons, Ares (the God Of War), and mythological creatures, and it all takes place in the present day in Washington D.C., at some very historical sites like the Vietnam Memorial wall and the Lincoln Memorial. But all of the modern people are absent from these scenes, including reporters, so that was very strange. I kept wondering where are the people? Where are the reporters? Where are the looky-loos with their camera phones?Another pet-peeve was during the contest they didn't show ""bullets and bracelets,"" which was part of the amazon competition to find who would be the emissary to escort Trevor back to ""man's world,"" but they did show WW deflecting bullets when she comes into the city. And they don't show how Diana becomes WW, she's basically wearing the costume under her clothes like Superman. Boring! They should have done the spin or the lasso from the comics, to get her into her costume.And the character herself seemed a little aloof. I was introduced to Wonder Woman through the Lynda Carter TV seriesWonder Woman - The Complete First Seasonand I read the comics during the 70s and 80s, but Carter's characterization is so firmly cemented in my brain and that might be why I find this character a little distant. Steve Trevor was a little annoying, too. But those are small problems.Other than that, the movie is cool and the extras are worth it.On DVD #2 you get:=== Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream--(25:25-Minutes)===Discusses how creator Marston got the idea for Wonder Woman and how the comic book character has influenced pop culture.=== Wonder Woman: Daughter Of Myth-- (25:35-Minutes) ===Talks about the evolution of Wonder Woman from the Greek Myths to the television series with Lynda Carter.Also includes two Justice League cartoons ""To Another Shore"" and ""Hawk and Dove"" that both feature Wonder Woman as the lead character.I hope that another WW DVD will be coming out soon.",5,It's About Time For *Wonder*Woman*s Own Cartoon!,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,2508,"['give', 'WONDER', 'WOMAN', 'TWO-DVD', 'SET', 'generous', '5-stars', ""'m"", 'glad', 'favorite', 'super', 'hero', 'mine', 'finally', 'recognition', 'own', 'animated', 'movie.That', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'updated', 'character', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'flaws.The', 'action', 'animation', 'really', 'good', 'other', 'reviewers', 'noted', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'showing', 'blood', 'killings', 'so', 'have', 'small', 'kids', 'might', 'disturb', 'thought', 'scenes', 'were', 'appropriate', ""'m"", 'adult.And', 'found', 'story', 'little', 'odd', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'battle', 'amazons', 'Ares', 'God', 'War', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'place', 'present', 'day', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'very', 'historical', 'sites', 'Vietnam', 'Memorial', 'wall', 'Lincoln', 'Memorial', 'modern', 'people', 'are', 'absent', 'scenes', 'including', 'reporters', 'was', 'very', 'strange', 'kept', 'wondering', 'where', 'are', 'people', 'Where', 'are', 'reporters', 'Where', 'are', 'looky-loos', 'camera', 'phones', 'pet-peeve', 'was', 'contest', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'bullets', 'bracelets', 'was', 'part', 'amazon', 'competition', 'find', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'emissary', 'escort', 'Trevor', 'back', 'man', 'world', 'did', 'show', 'WW', 'deflecting', 'bullets', 'when', 'city', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'how', 'Diana', 'WW', 'basically', 'wearing', 'costume', 'clothes', 'Superman', 'Boring', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'spin', 'lasso', 'comics', 'get', 'costume.And', 'character', 'herself', 'seemed', 'little', 'aloof', 'was', 'introduced', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'TV', 'seriesWonder', 'Woman', 'Complete', 'First', 'Seasonand', 'read', 'comics', '70s', '80s', 'Carter', 'characterization', 'so', 'firmly', 'cemented', 'brain', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'find', 'character', 'little', 'distant', 'Steve', 'Trevor', 'was', 'little', 'annoying', 'too', 'are', 'small', 'problems.Other', 'movie', 'cool', 'extras', 'are', 'worth', 'it.On', 'DVD', '2', 'get', '===', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Subversive', 'Dream', '25:25-Minutes', 'how', 'creator', 'Marston', 'got', 'idea', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'how', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'influenced', 'pop', 'culture.===', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Daughter', 'Myth', '25:35-Minutes', '===Talks', 'evolution', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Greek', 'Myths', 'television', 'series', 'Lynda', 'Carter.Also', 'two', 'Justice', 'League', 'cartoons', 'Shore', 'Hawk', 'Dove', 'feature', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'lead', 'character.I', 'hope', 'WW', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'soon']",N/A

I found it at a rather cheap sale and decided to give it a try. Imagine my surprise that it was really quite enjoyable.To clarify, my exposure to Wonder Woman was strictly limited to Justice League cartoons from my youth. However, this movie managed to both expand and enhance her legend beyond expectations. This Wonder Woman was still new to Mans World, ran into several of the sort of cultural problems such an immersion would cause. Her potential male lead is both chauvinistic and lecherous, but very good at what he does as both a pilot and a fighter. Therefore, the team up and eventual romance is fun to watch develop. Coupled with excellent animation and an engaging plot, this movie is definitely worth the investment of both time and money :)However, I do have one bit of warning for the unwary.

As far as this film goes (and its production)  it is a classic example of reinventing the wheel without making any improvements on the original.I personally have been most disappointed in modern attempts to bring WW to the television. However, the WW presented in the Justice League Cartoon made for Cartoon Network was by far her best representation. I was so hoping the producers of this cartoon would use the same talent use in that series but they decided to use different art technique and voices. Although I have nothing against Keri Russell's portrayal however she was not as good as Susan Eisenberg's from the Justice League Cartoon series. The artwork was too stylized for my taste which resulted in WW losing much of her sex appeal. I was really disappointed to be sure.The film did have good bits and it did earn its PG-13 rating due to violence and some surprisingly frank language. I also found the film somewhat anti-climatic and formulaic. I was also disappointed that unlike the Justice League cartoon, WW fell victim to the ""charms of men"". She is much more interesting when her sexuality is in question and when she isn't able to be manipulated by men that easily.Most fans of WW and DC heroes in general will probably like this film but I find it disappointing that they had card blanche to make a really kick butt film but just produced the same old stuff done over and over.",3,Ok film but could/should of been much better,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,1505,"['Seen', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'was', 'child', 'As', 'far', 'film', 'production', 'classic', 'example', 'reinventing', 'wheel', 'making', 'improvements', 'original.I', 'personally', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'disappointed', 'modern', 'attempts', 'bring', 'WW', 'television', 'However', 'WW', 'presented', 'Justice', 'League', 'Cartoon', 'made', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'representation', 'was', 'so', 'hoping', 'producers', 'cartoon', 'would', 'use', 'same', 'talent', 'use', 'series', 'decided', 'use', 'different', 'art', 'technique', 'voices', 'have', 'nothing', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'portrayal', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Susan', 'Eisenberg', 'Justice', 'League', 'Cartoon', 'series', 'artwork', 'was', 'too', 'stylized', 'taste', 'resulted', 'WW', 'losing', 'much', 'sex', 'appeal', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'be', 'sure.The', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'bits', 'did', 'earn', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'due', 'violence', 'surprisingly', 'frank', 'language', 'also', 'found', 'film', 'somewhat', 'anti-climatic', 'formulaic', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'Justice', 'League', 'cartoon', 'WW', 'fell', 'victim', 'charms', 'men', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'sexuality', 'question', 'when', ""n't"", 'able', 'be', 'manipulated', 'men', 'easily.Most', 'fans', 'WW', 'DC', 'heroes', 'general', 'will', 'probably', 'film', 'find', 'disappointing', 'had', 'card', 'blanche', 'make', 'really', 'kick', 'butt', 'film', 'just', 'produced', 'same', 'old', 'stuff', 'done']",N/A

Yet, something compelled me to get this animated feature. I'm really glad I did. Out of all the Warner Priemere/DC Universe Animated Features that I have, this has to be the very best of them all.The story begins with a battle between the Amazons and the forces of Ares. Upon defeating Ares, Zeus forbids Hippolyta from slaying him and she imprisons Ares in a prison cell on the Amazons' homeland known as Themyscira, where he is shackled with bracelets that inhibit him from thriving off the psychic energy created by murder and mayhem. Embittered by her experiences with mankind, Hippolyta shelters the Amazons from ever dealing with men again. She creates a daughter from sand, Diana, and raises her to be a warrior like the rest of the women on her island. Yet, their life is disrupted when Steve Trevor crash lands on the island. Hippolyta orders him returned to his homeland. In order to do so, the women compete to see who has the honor of carrying him home. Hippolyta forbids Diana to compete yet she competes anyway, secretly. Diana wins the contest and is bestowed the honor. Yet, she takes on a greater mission when it is found out that Ares has escaped. Diana, along with Steve, must locate Ares and stop him from bringing about bloodshed. That's when things get very interesting.Director Lauren Montgomery did a great job directing this animated feature. Make no mistake, folks, this is a very adult-oriented cartoon...not one I'd suggest children to see. While there is very little blood present in the movie, there are many stabbings and decapitations in the movie as well as innuendos of an adult nature. Extras include: Commentary by Producers Gregory Novak and Bruce Timm, Writer Michael Jelenic and Director Lauren Montgomery, An exclusive first look at the  Upcoming Green Lantern animated feature, From Graphic Novel to Animated Movie: Justice League: New Frontier, Batman Gotham Knight: An Anime Evolution, Wonder Woman: Amazon Princess, the Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream featurette & the Wonder Woman: Daughter of Myth featurette.I loved the movie myself and can't wait to see their next feature.

1214364,A3BBIP7Y5YBL6,B001LK8SKW,BVJim,"[0, 0]","I have purchased a number of animated films from both DC and Marvel and I have to say that this one is probably the top of the heap. The story is solid and at 74 minutes, the movie doesn't feel like it is too long. Basically an origin story, the movie focuses on Wonder Woman as a teen before she takes on the red, gold and blue. Basic story: Steve Trevor crashes on Themyscira and one of the Amazons has to take him back to the real world so a contest is held to find the most worthy and Diana wins, however as the contest is being held Ares (the God of War) escapes from the Amazons so Diana has to both take back Steve Trevor and recapture Ares. It is refreshing that DC put out a film without Superman or Batman and I applaud the effort. There is quite a bit tossed in regarding female equality including a rather humorous exchange between Diana and a young girl as Diana teaches her sword fighting. The extras are fair with the ones on the first disc being repeats of previews of other DC releases that show up on a bunch of the other DC releases.

1214368,A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT,B001LK8SKW,Charlie Brooks,"[2, 2]","Wonder Woman has a tough time in DC's superhero community. She's one of the big three iconic superheroes alongside Superman and Batman, but writers tend to have a hard time fitting her into a specific niche. This has led to a lot of inconsistency in her depictions and has, on average, kept her from having the same luck in film as her male counterparts. Outside of the Linda Carter TV series, which was itself very campy, Wonder Woman has just struck out. Fortunately, this film, while not flawless, breaks that trend.The film mostly embraces the George Perez reboot from the 1980s, with Diana lacking a traditional secret identity and meddling in the affairs of the gods - in this case, Ares specifically, who seeks to lead the world to war. There is a bit of old-fashioned Wonder Woman here as well, specifically in her relationship with Steve Trevor, which is more romantic than in the Perez reboot. What follows is a fast-paced but well-told story that highlights some of the best parts of Wonder Woman.The voice acting is a high point of the film, with Keri Russell excellent as Wonder Woman, Alfred Molina playing a cunning and cruel Hades, and Nathan Fillion stealing the show as Steve Trevor. The animation is solid and the action is enjoyable. The only flaw in the film is that, like many DC films, it feels a bit on the short side, with some plot points rushed and character development taking a backseat to action. However, this flaw doesn't hurt the movie too much, and anybody who is a fan of Wonder Woman will be glad to see the iconic superheroine FINALLY get a movie that she deserves.",4,"At last, a good Wonder Woman film!",1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,1602,"['Wonder', 'Woman', 'tough', 'time', 'DC', 'superhero', 'community', 'one', 'big', 'three', 'iconic', 'superheroes', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'writers', 'tend', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'fitting', 'specific', 'niche', 'led', 'lot', 'inconsistency', 'depictions', 'average', 'kept', 'having', 'same', 'luck', 'film', 'male', 'counterparts', 'Linda', 'Carter', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'campy', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'just', 'struck', 'out', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'not', 'flawless', 'breaks', 'trend.The', 'film', 'mostly', 'George', 'Perez', 'reboot', '1980s', 'Diana', 'lacking', 'traditional', 'secret', 'identity', 'meddling', 'affairs', 'gods', 'case', 'Ares', 'specifically', 'who', 'lead', 'world', 'war', 'bit', 'old-fashioned', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'specifically', 'relationship', 'Steve', 'Trevor', 'more', 'romantic', 'Perez', 'reboot', 'What', 'fast-paced', 'well-told', 'story', 'best', 'parts', 'Wonder', 'Woman.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'excellent', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'playing', 'cunning', 'cruel', 'Hades', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'stealing', 'show', 'Steve', 'Trevor', 'animation', 'solid', 'action', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'flaw', 'film', 'many', 'DC', 'films', 'bit', 'short', 'side', 'plot', 'points', 'rushed', 'character', 'development', 'taking', 'backseat', 'action', 'However', 'flaw', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'anybody', 'who', 'fan', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'see', 'iconic', 'superheroine', 'FINALLY', 'get', 'movie']",N/A

I'm very pleased with this feature, in fact, it could have been released to theaters. The only thing that keeps me from giving the film 5 stars is some inconsistancy with the charactors and holes in the story compared with the comics tale of Diana's origin and powers. For example, In no version of Diana's story did Hippolyta have any kind of relationship with Ares. Heracles, yes, but not Ares. Also, early on, Steve Trevor engages Diana in a one-on-one fight. Diana should have been able to just grab him by the collar and hold him with no effort, instead, he holds his own. Later, we see her pick up a large desk, throw demons through walls, punch Ares off the Washington Monument, etc. However, this doesn't really take away from the enjoyment of the movie. The animation is very well done, the charactors are spot-on, and the visual effects are wonderful. This film has a better score than MANY live-action movies I've seen. Of course, the amazons are depicted as what they were: warriors. As a result, nothing much was held back in battle and fight scenes. Lots of violence and death, although with little blood flowing. Thought should be taken regarding young children viewing this film, as it is quite violent, along with some remarkably adult humor throughout. By and large, I loved the film, aside from the faults I listed earlier, along with her seemingly not being able to fly, which is a departure again from the comics and earlier animated versions of the Amazon princess.

1214378,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B001LK8SKW,D. A. Reed,"[2, 2]","Yay! Finally a Wonder Woman movie! Sadly DTV will probably be the only way we ever see the character in a film as Warner Bros. keeps turning down scripts.Fortunately the story is original whereas the first two were adaptations and the third serving as a semi-bridge between ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"". Utilizing Wonder Woman's supporting cast is a brilliant move seeing as how Timm never really used the Amazons very well, especially Queen Hippolyta. She always came off as an wooden and didn't really scream ""Warrior Queen"" to me. Come to think of it, all of the Amazons never seemed like great warriors in JL/JLU! They were always being beaten back by Felix Faust or some other magic spell. But thanks to the brilliant opening battle sequence, I was reassured of their prowess in battle. In fact, the Amazons are such great warriors that blood never stains their swords after stabbing or cutting someone's head off. Wonder Woman's powers are present except flight which at least is a reason why she uses the Invisible Jet (though the reason why the Amazons have it is a mystery though I think its technology is based on Themyiscara's cloaking device). Sadly, the way Diana just takes off her outer clothes to get into her outfit is just boring. I know the producers probably wanted to distance themselves from the ""Wonder Spin"" that Lynda Carter did but that has since been incorporated into the comics and was even used in JLU. If a live-action film is ever decided upon, I hope they take a cue from this movie. Just because the character originated during WWII, doesn't mean the movie has to take place there nor does it have to take place in modern or mythological times. This movie honors her history by using Wonder Woman's mythological background while having her story set in modern times.Again the animation is great (I'm just gonna say that the animation in the other films is great so that way I don't have to say the same thing over and over). All of the Amazons look good but Wonder Woman suffers the same as Superman from Doomsday. She looks too similar to her Justice League model, which is odd because in Crisis on Two Earths she looks different from her JL model. Ares makes for a great villain and his visual suits him (much better than the JLU model), though his upgraded form kind of borders on the ridiculous. Though why Hades is the size of Jabba the Hutt is confusing as all of the statues I've ever seen of him depict him with a slim build.Andrea Romano gives us another great cast. Keri Russell is perfect as Wonder Woman, Susan Eisenberg from JL seemed wooden several times throughout season one (then again, season one of JL was a very iffy season and she did improve). Nathan Fillion is also good as Steve Trevor, ably making him a chauvinistic pig but he has a sense of humor. Alfred Molina was a wonderful choice as Ares, adding yet another comic villain to his resum&eacute;. He brings a sense of menace to him (which was something Michael York failed to do in JLU). Virginia Madsen, again a perfect choice for Hippolyta. She plays the queen with diginity, elegance and a ferocity in battle. I don't know who they picked for JL, but they should've picked Madsen from the start, she at least projected emotion. Rosario Dawson is just alright as Artemis.

The pros heavily outweigh the cons in this latest adaptation and it couldn't have come soon enough for many die-hard fans. The animation, acting, story, and overall production is great. The only problems I had with it were Diana's personality - she was traditionally warmer than the rest of the amazons (though the greatest warrior of them all) and I found this incarnation to be a little rough around the edges. I also didn't like that her mother, Hippolyta, looked so much like her. I also prefer the traditional WWII era story as depicted in the 1970's live action series, but oh well. I also didn't believe how easily Steve Trevor accepted all of this fantastic mythological phenomenon happening all around him, from discovering a hidden island inhabited solely by women to an epic battle led by Ares the god of war. 74 minutes seemed too short.

1214385,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B001LK8SKW,E. David Swan,"[4, 6]","Wonder Woman has gotten some spectacular reviews from professional reviews but I can't say I was nearly as impressed. The movie goes back to the origin of Wonder Woman with some slight alterations from the comic book version. There was one strange change in the part where Diana competes surreptitiously in a competition to win the right to visit the outside world. In the comic she wears a mask and there was a masked fighter in the competition but it wasn't Diana so I got confused. Diana wears an open face helmet and when she inevitably wins the competition. Her mother Hippolyta asks her to remove it and reveal herself. It was weird because her face was nearly completely unobscured. This isn't a biggie but it's rather emblematic of a film that in my opinion just isn't that great.In the first few minutes of the film Wonder Woman's future boyfriend, Steve Trevor, crash lands on Paradise Island. One of my issues with WW has always been the lack of consistency in her powers. Sometimes she's merely a very strong woman (hence the ability of the Cheetah to go toe to toe with her) and at other times she's nearly as powerful as Superman. Since men are forbidden on Paradise Island Diana (as she's called on the Island) attacks him and actually gets tossed once or twice before kicking him in the groin. The only way this makes any sense is if Diana's powers are dramatically reduced on Paradise Island because later in the film she is monstrously powerful. So Trevor gets his junk kicked up into his brain because for most of the rest of the movie he behaves like a retarded, horny frat boy. Even in front of Diana's mother when his life is being threatened he can't stop making lewd inappropriate comments about Diana. Seriously, Steve is a total dolt and his ceaseless flirting is nauseating. He even disparages Wonder Woman herself implying that her costume makes her look like a hooker and refers to her home as Chastity Belt Island.If I were to guess why Wonder Woman has received reviews that in my opinion exceed its quality I would say it's because WW is willing to show more violence than any other DC Animation I can remember seeing. We're talking swords through the chest type violence and what fanboy wouldn't love to see an island of stacked Amazonians. Also, when Diana first puts on her Wonder Woman costume her bustier causes her breasts to bounce. The fact is that at my age it's going to take more than some jiggling cartoon boobs to get me interested. The worst thing for me was the way Wonder Woman would go on a feminist rant about how the outside world represses women and how women buy into this and become weak and needy but then she falls for a complete lout. Trevor even literally refers to himself as a chauvinistic pig but she still ends up with him. As a final insult Wonder Woman is facing off against Ares, the God of War, and he tells her she has learned nothing to which she replies, `I've learned one thing... It's not polite to hit a lady' WHAT?!?! That is completely diametrically opposite of everything Wonder Woman has preached through the movie. I had the thought that this film was written by a man trying badly to put himself in the mind of a liberated female until I discovered the writer was Gail Simone who is probably the best female comic writer in the business. What the heck happened?It's not a terrible film but it just wasn't for me. Whatever message the film was trying to convey failed in my book and despite the praise other have heaped on the film I found the animation mediocre for a DC animated movie. It's worth seeing but I wouldn't pay to own it.",3,"""They're messin' with Lincoln, NOBODY messes with Lincoln!!!"" - Steve Trevor",1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,3612,"['Wonder', 'Woman', 'gotten', 'spectacular', 'reviews', 'professional', 'reviews', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'impressed', 'movie', 'back', 'origin', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'slight', 'alterations', 'comic', 'book', 'version', 'was', 'one', 'strange', 'change', 'part', 'where', 'Diana', 'surreptitiously', 'competition', 'win', 'right', 'visit', 'outside', 'world', 'comic', 'mask', 'was', 'masked', 'fighter', 'competition', 'was', ""n't"", 'Diana', 'so', 'got', 'confused', 'Diana', 'open', 'face', 'helmet', 'when', 'inevitably', 'competition', 'mother', 'Hippolyta', 'remove', 'reveal', 'was', 'weird', 'face', 'was', 'nearly', 'completely', 'unobscured', ""n't"", 'biggie', 'rather', 'emblematic', 'film', 'opinion', 'just', ""n't"", 'great.In', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'future', 'boyfriend', 'Steve', 'Trevor', 'crash', 'lands', 'Paradise', 'Island', 'One', 'issues', 'WW', 'always', 'been', 'lack', 'consistency', 'powers', 'Sometimes', 'merely', 'very', 'strong', 'woman', 'hence', 'ability', 'Cheetah', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'other', 'times', 'nearly', 'as', 'powerful', 'Superman', 'men', 'are', 'forbidden', 'Paradise', 'Island', 'Diana', 'called', 'Island', 'actually', 'tossed', 'once', 'twice', 'kicking', 'groin', 'only', 'way', 'sense', 'Diana', 'powers', 'are', 'dramatically', 'reduced', 'Paradise', 'Island', 'later', 'film', 'monstrously', 'powerful', 'So', 'Trevor', 'junk', 'kicked', 'up', 'brain', 'most', 'rest', 'movie', 'retarded', 'horny', 'frat', 'boy', 'Even', 'front', 'Diana', 'mother', 'when', 'life', 'being', 'threatened', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'making', 'lewd', 'inappropriate', 'comments', 'Diana', 'Seriously', 'Steve', 'total', 'dolt', 'ceaseless', 'flirting', 'nauseating', 'even', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'implying', 'costume', 'look', 'hooker', 'refers', 'home', 'Chastity', 'Belt', 'Island.If', 'were', 'guess', 'why', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'received', 'reviews', 'opinion', 'exceed', 'quality', 'would', 'say', 'WW', 'willing', 'show', 'more', 'violence', 'other', 'DC', 'Animation', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'talking', 'swords', 'chest', 'type', 'violence', 'what', 'fanboy', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'see', 'island', 'stacked', 'Amazonians', 'Also', 'when', 'Diana', 'first', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'bustier', 'breasts', 'bounce', 'fact', 'age', 'going', 'take', 'more', 'jiggling', 'cartoon', 'boobs', 'get', 'interested', 'worst', 'thing', 'was', 'way', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'would', 'go', 'feminist', 'rant', 'how', 'outside', 'world', 'women', 'how', 'women', 'buy', 'become', 'weak', 'needy', 'then', 'complete', 'lout', 'Trevor', 'even', 'literally', 'refers', 'chauvinistic', 'pig', 'still', 'up', 'final', 'insult', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'facing', 'off', 'Ares', 'God', 'War', 'learned', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'polite', 'hit', 'lady', 'WHAT', 'completely', 'diametrically', 'opposite', 'everything', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'preached', 'movie', 'had', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'man', 'trying', 'badly', 'put', 'mind', 'liberated', 'female', 'discovered', 'writer', 'was', 'Gail', 'Simone', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'female', 'comic', 'writer', 'business', 'What', 'heck', 'happened', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'message', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'failed', 'book', 'praise', 'other', 'have', 'heaped', 'film', 'found', 'animation', 'mediocre', 'DC', 'animated', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'own']",N/A

And it is arguably the best DCU animated feature to date.This set has everything. Commentary on the feature, behind the scenes of the Green Lantern animated film, two huge documentaries, and the expected bonus episodes picked by DC animation expert Bruce Timm.The film itself shatters all expectations. Keri Russell does a solid job as she has to walk a very thin line between a powerful female demigod and a humanizing of said character. We are given a reinterpretation of the origin, but it a lot more hard-hitting.  The 'sidekick' Steve Trevor, is brought to life by fan favourite Nathan Fillion, and he walks similar thin line between someone capable of standing along side the Amazon Princess and at the same time being flirting shamelessly as the everyman. The story itself deals with the birth of Wonder Woman and her quest to track down the rogue god of war, Ares. There is a lot of violence and a lot of blood and death. Nothing we haven't seen in films, but it is new to the DCU animated titles. So keep this in mind of children.

The story is well crafted.The origins of Themyscira (Paradise Island) and the Amazons are intriguing.  The ancient god of war Ares is presented in all of his ""bad ass"" glory. He feeds off the bloodshed as he preaches his ""gospel of death"".Princess Diana is a true warrior.  She is very young, but her youth is no deterrent.  Her divine origin makes her a bridge between the gods and Amazons.The basic story is one of betrayal, secrets, bravery, and ultimate war.  Unfortunately, Washington, DC does not fare well in this 74 minutes film.The PG 13 rating is justified.  The war scenes at the beginning and the epic battle at the end in Washington are violent and bloody.  Well drawn with realistic action!Disc Two has additional features:Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream is a documentary about how Wonder Woman was created at DC Comics in 1941 by Dr. William M. Marston who wanted a female hero as a role model for young women.  ""Truth and power of women"" were the driving force behind Marston's creation.  Women's roles in society were changing because of WWII.Wonder Woman: Daughter of Myth examines the Greco-Roman culture transferred into current culture via the comic book.  This is a good introduction to the ancient goddesses of Greece and Rome. There is a focus on the Wonder Woman's television series with Lynda Carter.Two cartoons: Justice League Unlimited: To Another Shore and Hawk and Dove.I do have one issue with this film--the bar scene where Steve Trevor attempts to get Diana drunk for his own reasons.  Fortunately, she sees through his strategy and drinks him under the table.  However, it is commendable that Princess Diana did not succumb to the alcohol, but mortal young women could not survive the number of rounds that she drank.Too many women have been used and abused because of alcohol consumption. As the film depicts--""wicked, disloyal, and above all untrustworthy"" such is the nature of the male of the species.  Male bashing?

1214411,A26O0T192IBKY1,B001LK8SKW,J. Alford,"[1, 2]","'Bout freaking time Wo-Wo got her own gig! After three other made-for-video animated movies, DC Universe put together the first origin story involving one of their Big 3, Wonder Woman, which is great since Josh ""Whedonverse"" Whedon dropped the ball on the whole live-action film deal. Unlike Superman: Doomsday, Justice League: New Frontier, and Batman: Gotham Knight, this one isn't continuing from an already established storyline. It takes the original premise of Wonder Woman from the 40s, and resets it for the 21st Century.A few thousand years ago, the Amazons were under the subjection of Ares, the Greek god of war. Queen Hippolyta leads her sister-warriors in a battle to liberate themselves from Ares, and their bastard son, who like all good mothers, Hippolyta beheads. The Amazons are freed, and allowed to live on a secluded island called Themyscara(aka: Paradise Island), but must keep watch over the now less than powerful Ares who they keep imprisioned. Shoot ahead to modern day where skirtchasing pilot Steve Trevor crashlands on the island and is taken in by Diana, the daughter of Hippolyta brought to life from clay. The Amazons determine that Steve is not a theat, and hold a tournament to see who would be the one to take him back home. Diana disguises herself as a common warrior, and wins. But, its discovered that Ares seduced his jailer Persephone, and the two of them made their escape off the island. Diana now has to deliver Steve back to America, but at the same time find Ares. Once back in the States, Steve offers to help Diana. After a few drinks, they are attacked by a demigod working for Ares. Diana stops him, and learns that Ares is at an ancient temple leading to Tartarus. Diana and Steve fight Ares and Persephone in the temple, but are unable to stop them from entering the underworld, where Ares gets his uncle Hades to restore his godly powers. Steve takes the injured Diana to a hospital, where they explore their feelings. Ares then leads an assault on Washington D.C. with an army of monsters. Diana rushes to stop him, but is outnumbered. Fortunately, the Amazons arrive, and go all 300 on Ares' forces. Not even the combined might of zombie Amazons, and Ares' now more empowered strength stops Diana and the others from defeating him. Diana returns with others to Themyscara, but Hippolyta realizes that the Amazons should continue to learn more about the ""world of man"", and appoints Diana as their emissary. Diana now goes incognito as a regular American citizen with Steve knowing her true identity, which is now dubbed Wonder Woman. The film ends with her taking on the supervillainess, Cheetah.This was actually one of the better DC Universe selections. The animation was truly exceptional from the first two American-animated movies(Batman: Gotham Knight was all anime), and the story moved along really well. The only real downside was that alot was cut out for the sake of meeting Warner's 75 minute time limit. I dunno why, but all their OVAs have to be no more than 75 minutes, maybe to fit into a 90 minute airtime on Cartoon Network or something. Because of this though, there's quite a few corners that get shaved, like no explanation of where the technology for the invisible jet came from or how Diana even knows how to pilot it, and how a powerless Ares made it off Themyscara and all the way to Cuba with no boat or anything.The voice acting was pretty fair too, especially Nathan ""Captain Hammer"" Fillion as Steve Trevor. The character designs were also good. I liked the fact that they went back and made Hippolyta a brunette unlike on Justice League and the original Wonder Woman TV series where she was always blonde. Ares seems like a villain from a Yoshiaki Kawajiri animated film. Artemis looks pretty buff, like she usually does in the comics. Diana appears to be alot taller and athletic than in most other animated incarnations of her. Aside from the colossal design she had in Justice League: New Frontier, this version has her as a real warrior type, and not just a buxom chick in a swimsuit.Aside from the short runtime on it, Wonder Woman is a very satisfying superhero movie, animated or otherwise. The whole focus on this was mainly on Wonder Woman's mythological ties, and since she's a myth-based hero like Thor, Hercules, and Captain Marvel, at least most of the plots she's involved with are about gods and demons. Since this movie got most of that taken care of, if they end up doing some kind of contuation from it in say Wonder Woman 2, they'll hopefully be able to focus a little more on the actual superhero side of the character.

I put her up there with Green Lantern and Aquaman--filler heroes. If I'd known that it had the same director as Superman/Batman: Apocalypse I would have checked it out a long time ago.Briefly, Ares, the god of war, has escaped imprisonment. Diana (Wonder Woman) with the help of a soldier set out to stop Ares from destroying the world. This is the story in a nutshell without spoiling it. The story is very good, essentially the paradigm shift of a culture governed by women and where women are the stronger sex. Wonder woman keeps it real. If you want to be a man's equal then stop shaking your b**bs and *sses and do it yourself. ""Stop subordinating yourself to men"" is Wonder Woman's outlook. But despite her superior strength and independence the film shows that all women can be soft and feminized by real men, and even seduced, conquered, and deceived, as is often the case, by bad boys.The animation is top notch. The fight scenes are brutal and well-choreographed. This is definitely not the Saturday morning version of Wonder Woman I grew up with. These chicks kick *ass! I don't know how DC does it.

The action scenes are good particularly the ancient war where Queen Hippolyta was the wonder woman of her time.  And the animation is above average and looked good for the most part.What made this movie less than great is Wonder Woman is NOT exactly that -- wondrous.WW is the S man's equivalent: what she lacks in the strength department, she makes up for in amazing fighting ability; laser eyes with deflecting bracelets; super breath with a tiara and indestructible lasso.  She also flies like the Sman but because she's a woman, she gets to have accessories like the invisible plane.  And she's prettier.So what happened?She should have been showcased as the ultimate superpowered warrior in the DC universe with profound wisdom.  The real WW is the one found in Justice League Season 1 -- she could stop Sman if needed. A similar treatment is seen in Batman/Superman Apocalypse -- she is Beautiful in that movie, very strong, FLIES and had some awesome fighting moves.In this movie, she's no more powerful than a midlevel superhero in the DC universe. And she does not fly, why?Balance should be depicted in the DC universe. When there is a super Man, there should also be an equally super Woman. WW is the Ying in Superman's Yang, the Reaction to Sman's Action. If we are afraid of WW being great, why create her at all?I'm not disappointed entirely but she does not need a man to help her -- she is needed to help man's world.  She was saved one too many times by Steve Trevor in this movie. I mean, really?We live in a world ruled by Lady Gaga and Glee. I think we're ready for a Super woman.

Just my personal taste... I'm not saying the concept is deeply flawed or anything.  But since I've enjoyed several of the other recent DC direct-to-DVD animated features, I decided to buy this one anyway.  And I'm generally glad I did.This 72-minute, nicely-animated film didn't turn me around, but I have to say I enjoyed it well enough.  Lots of spit and polish, good music, and a mature edge made it worth a viewing.  Also, the bonus features on the two-disc set were generous and entertaining.  Two documentaries, about 25 minutes each, work together to make a good case for the importance and impact of the character in both the comics industry and among the reading public at the time of her creation.  I also liked the sneak peak of the upcoming ""Green Lantern"" direct-to-DVD animated film, which is featured on both the single-disc and two-disc version of ""Wonder Woman"" (the docs I mentioned are only on the two-disc version).In closing, true Wonder Woman aficionados might have a quibble or two (as another reviewer or two has pointed out, they never do explain where the invisible jet comes from), but will generally probably like this film a lot.  Myself, I thought the movie was pleasantly watchable, but I really enjoyed the thoughtful, in-depth documentaries that accompanied it.  Thus, I'm giving the DVD as a whole- the two-disc version- a strong recommendation.

Justice League: War), they would reallybe doing themselves a favor by going back and revisiting some of the movies they produced in the not so distantpast. Wonder Woman is one of them. The movie is superb in just about every aspect, from the the fluid. gorgeousanimation to the dramatic, rousing soundtrack,There are just so many elements of this movie that I love. Lets us begin with the voice acting, which is superb: Kerri Russell plays the role of a much younger Wonder Woman (in her early 20s),and she does so convincingly (this is not Susan Eisenberg's supremely confident WW, but rather a younger WW who is cautiously starting to find her place in the world); Nathan Fillon is great as Steve Trevor, playing the character with great charm and infectious humor; but the true revelation here Alfred Molina, whos steal every scene he is in as the mighty and arrogant God of War Ares. The story is wonderful, tracing the origins of Wonder Woman  and her departure from Themascira into wider world beyond. The story has a lot of wry, humorous moments (that all work), some brillant, fast paced action scenes, and some interesting observations on the plight of women in the modern world and their relationships with men (which come naturally to WW, being an outsider). The art and animation is so beautiful you almost feel moved by it in some places, and makes you realize how much the animation DC has put out recently has degenerated into poor quality Anime junk. And then the soundtrack, like in a all great movies, is lush, rousing, and, most of all, memorable -- you don't forget it ten minutes after seeing the movie.My only complaint with the movie? That there was no sequel. Instead, despite the commerical success of this movie and the almost unanimous praise by critics, DC Animation decides to meekly return to its tested and tired old formula: more Batman movies. Batman live action, Batman animation, Batman TV series, Batman until you want to puke.This is without a doubt one of the greatest animated movies ever made. Up there with the great Disney classics like Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin and Mulan. Bruce Timm and other powers at DC need to go back and revisit this movie and others made in the same era (like Green Lantern First Flight).

1214434,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B001LK8SKW,K. Ostrowski,"[9, 18]","I admit that I haven't read many Wonder Woman comics (and especially not recent ones,) but I'm familiar with the character and her core supporting cast, and what made the concept work during its initial run.  It's for these reasons that I have to point out just what a miserable failure this movie was, in virtually every respect.  ""Wonder Woman"" is a load of pushy, overly-violent, trash-talking, modern American feminism, and nothing else.  However, I feel it deserves a more thorough review than just that, so for the rest of the review, I'll be addressing the specific characters and other elements in the movie, to explain just why the film gets them wrong.-----Etta CandyEtta Candy is a minor character in the film.  So minor, in fact, that she gets, I think, less than a minute of screen-time.  In fact, it makes me wonder why they even bothered to put her in, if they couldn't do a better job on her than this.In this film, Etta is a tall, blond, skinny, seductive woman, who's briefly scolded by Wonder Woman for asking a man to move a desk for her.In the comics, Etta Candy was a short, plump, bruinette, who was the leader of a college sorority.  Wonder Woman discovered her when she was sickly and weak while visiting a local hospital.  In other words, Etta was unearthed on an errand of mercy; not a manhunt for an enemy, as in this film.I'm just going to be up-front about this.  Making Etta skinny is something which, by itself, would put this film on my butt-kick list, but the fact that they only used her to demonstrate one of Wonder Woman's character flaws puts it way over the top.-----HadesIn a way, my problem with the film's depiction of Hades is almost the precise reverse of my problem with Etta Candy in one sense, and precisely the same in another sense.In this film, Hades is a black-haired, lazy, obese man who reclines on a couch and orders people around in the underworld.  I have -never- seen him depicted this way before; not in the comics, and certainly not in any of the ancient Greek artwork that depicted him.  This is the problem which, as I said, is like the opposite of my problem with Etta.The problem which is the same for both characters is that in neither case do the characters have motives which are even remotely similar to their original counterparts.  Hades was sentenced to rule the underworld by Zeus, to keep him busy, and it apparently worked, as Hades is generally depicted as fearsome, but always a very busy guy.  Yet, in this film, he's apparently not busy, not working, not really fearsome at all, and not the least bit worried about all the extra work he'll have to do when Ares starts killing people.  In fact, he seems to -want- more people to die.This depiction just made no sense to me.  My conclusion here is that it was just done to avoid having to go too deep into the character, and to prey on the already-miserable fat-person stereotypes, just as a faithful rendering of Etta would have threatened them.-----Steve TrevorUp to now, we've been dealing mainly with bit players, but I don't think any character does quite as much damage to this movie as Steve Trevor.  In the comics, he was a brave, WWII fighter pilot, who was rescued by Wonder Woman and returned home.  She stayed on as a goodwill ambassador to ""man's world,"" and the two eventually fell in love.  Steve was a little awkward at times, in the comics, but he was a decent man nonetheless.In the movie, Steve is -not- a decent man.  He's a filthy, womanizing, letcherous, drunken buffoon.  Yes, he can fight pretty well in his own way, but that's just about all he brings to the film, and given that he's playing alongside a superheroine, that means he's basically a worthless character, serving only to give Wonder Woman a reason to visit man's world, and get her into trouble.But I think I know why they did him this way.  You see, midway through the film, Steve delivers a long and perfectly-accurate speech about how Wonder Woman needs to back off suspecting men of being patronizing every time they do something nice for a woman (she has a nasty habit, in this movie, of taking it as an insult whenever this happens.)  It's a good speech, and coming from, for example, a Sir Galahad or a Superman, it would have been one of the high points of the film, because it would have refuted, once and for all, the prejudices of the Wonder Woman character, and pointed out just what a jerk she was, and had always been, since the film began.However, the speech loses all of its steam, because, of course, we know that it's coming from a filthy, womanizing, letcherous, drunken buffoon, and in the eyes of modern men, if you're ""that kind of person,"" then any point you make must be a bad one.  This, I think, is why they went to such lengths to keep Steve Trevor from being a decent human being, or a good representative of the male gender, as he was in the comics.  It's because they want that message crushed.-----AresThe villain of the piece is Ares; the Greek god of war, who's been imprisoned on Wonder Woman's home island of Themyscira for ages, and is seeking a way to restore his powers, so that he can challenge the powers that be.  Ares comes across as being very much like Imhotep from the 1999 version of ""the Mummy;"" an immensely-powerful and threatening villain, who's seeking forbidden means to make himself even stronger through murder and general evil.Sadly, of all the characters in this film, he's probably the closest to his depiction in the comics and legends, with one exception.  Even once he ""gets his powers back,"" he still seems to be mortal.  The one constant thing about the legends of the Greek gods was that whether or not they could fight, they were immune to all forms of conventional attack.  This is a -big- flaw in the film.  However, I'll cover this more in a couple sections, when I get to Wonder Woman herself.-----The AmazonsIn the past, I've seen two basic depictions of the amazons; Wonder Woman's people.  First, there's the type that remains separate from ""man's world"" as a sort of religious devotion.  Second, there's the type that genuinely thinks of humans as inferior, and men especially so.  Needless to say, I favor the former over the latter, since an island full of intensely self-righteous and condescending jerks is hardly a proud heritage for a great superheroine.However, the amazons in this movie take things even further than the worst comic writing I've seen about them.  Not only are they totally convinced of their own superiority, but they practice active prejudice against men, and teach hatred of all men as though it were a religious doctrine.  This is bad enough, but it's not the only problem the amazons have.You see, it's revealed that this isolation from human beings is not by choice; that the amazons have adopted a life without families or children, with the exception of Diana, who was made from clay, and that they really have only two things in exchange; well-honed warrior disciplines, and the wisdom of ancient books.I say that these are the only things they have because these amazons are war-hounds and little else.  One of them is shown enjoying books, but even she turns into a battle-thrall near the end of the film, and at no point in the film are the amazons shown to be honest, good-hearted, or moral.  In fact, as far as I can tell, these amazons have no form of moral teaching, though they're perfectly eager to criticize things that offend their emotional sensibilities.  Needless to say, I was singularly unimpressed with the amazons in this movie, and everything about them, and it seems that...-----Wonder Woman Herself...has learned from them well.  Like them, she's a rabid man-hater and mindless battle-hound, and like them, she's constantly looking down her nose at things she finds emotionally-offensive, while demonstrating no clear, moral understanding at all.In the original comics, Wonder Woman was a brave, strong woman who fought crime and evil with her special powers, but she was also a caring, gentle soul, more akin to Mother Theresa than Xena; Warrior Princess.  She loved helping people out when they were in danger, or needed assistance, whether it involved fighting someone or not.  It was by no means rare to see her carrying someone to a hospital, or transporting medicine to victims of a plague; all the time with a smile on her face, because she knew she was helping someone.  No other reason was needed.On top of all that, Wonder Woman was genuinely virtuous; -in the Christian sense- of virtues.  She was humble, honest, charitable, joyful, loved peace, justice and righteousness, and she was as pure-hearted as a newborn.Sadly, many writers simply don't or didn't understand this about her, and it's become something of a trend in comics to depict her as a sort of ""perfect"" character who's become imperfect because she -thinks of herself as- perfect, and superior to everyone else.Still, as bad as this has gotten in the comics, it's even worse in this movie, which paints Wonder Woman as a genuine jerk with nothing even resembling gold in her heart.  Worst of all, this Wonder Woman is capable of murder.Yes, I realize that she killed someone in the comics as well, under pressure and during what essentially amounted to a hostage situation.  I raise issue with that as well, but not nearly as much as with this film, because at least -that murder- was treated as a genuine, moral problem.  In this film, Wonder Woman has no qualms whatsoever with slicing apart bad guys like cucumbers, -with the intent of ending their lives.-  There is nothing in any way moral or purehearted about this character, and therefore, nothing heroic.-----The Whole World View of the FilmI've said my piece on feminism elsewhere (google ""the problem of feminism"" in quotes.  It's the first one that pops up,) and I feel no need to repeat it.  However, this movie has, I think, two specific problems with feminism.1. First, Wonder Woman views the normal attitudes of a normal woman asking for help from a man as -entirely cultural.-  She insists that women can do anything which men can do, and here's the problem with that view.  It's -false.-  It's -false- that women can do whatever men can do.Women are built differently than men.  Their upper bodies aren't designed for the same kind of strenuous, heavy lifting, their torsos aren't meant for dodging blows in combat, and they wear out faster under prolonged physical activity.  Now, granted, a certain amount of training and practice can limit these disadvantages to a certian degree, but regardless, against a male opponent of comparable skill and practice, a woman would simply find herself outclassed in many areas; usually involving physical activity.The only reason why anyone would deny this is because Wonder Woman has superpowers, so she -is- built for heavy lifting, swift dodging, etc...  However, Wonder Woman is a fictional character, who is clearly the exception to the rule.  This is why the ancient Greeks found the amazons so humorous to tell stories about.  There was simply no way for women to overpower men in combat en masse in the real world.This is one of the reasons why the film irks me so.  It attempts to derive its philosophy from the abilities of fictional characters, who only represent a tiny minority, even in their own home universe.2. There have always been feminist or pseudo-feminist undertones to Woman Woman, but believe it or not, there was a time when feminism was a -good- thing; just the desire to see woman get a just wage for doing the same jobs as men.By contrast, much of modern feminism (at least in major, feminist organizations) has become just what Wonder Woman herself demonstrates in this movie, a disorganized, disagreeable group of angry, violent individuals, united by radical sexism.As sad as it's been to see feminism, as a cause, gradually turn into something horrible, it's been even worse seeing Wonder Woman trying to turn into something just as bad.  I guess that's all I really have to say.",1,"Pushy, Overly-Violent, Trash-Talking, Modern American Feminism, and Nothing Else",1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,12033,"['admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'read',

Several examples of Greek mythology play a major role in story development, which makes the movie very engrossing to watch, especially if you've studied mythology and have an interest in Greek culture. Sexism is another major cornerstone that, while only touched on in a few other comics and cartoons, is stated very boldly here, which made me fall in love with the movie and Wonder Woman in general. Not only does it teach that women can be just as strong as men, but that one big reason men and women often don't understand each other is because of lack of communication. I could imagine several instances where this movie could be shown and learned from in a classroom, be it high school or college.Education aside, it's just fun to watch girls do a lot of the butt-kicking instead of the guys.

The animation is fantastic, a step up from 'Justice League', and the story is complex, smart and really entertaining. At first I wasn't overly impressed with the voice acting, but then I realized how perfectly the actors voices represent the characters. Keri Russel as Diana may come off sounding wooden at first, but then you see that she really does sound like a strong warrior who needs to be warmed up a bit by Nathan Fillion's character. He does a great job at the red-blooded, all American male role and the chemistry between the two characters crackles and pops with sexual tension and humorous banter that makes for a fun romantic comedy. The action in this feature is compelling and it flows nicely with the plot, never dragging out or anything.I was never a fan of the Wonder Woman character before I saw this movie but now I am and I have become compelled to re-watch Justice League and the like because of this.

Usually humor falls flat in these animated adventures with stilted dialogue coming from the editing process, but Fillion's delivery actually had me laughing out loud a couple of times.Alfred Molina is also great as the villain Ares, really making the emotional moments of the character stand out just as much as the evil ones.Keri Russel's readings were a little bland at times, but it sorts of fits the naive attitude of the character.I would recommend this to casual fans of the character, very fun!",5,Enjoyable Update of A Classic Character,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,1153,"['only', 'rented', 'movie', 'lone', 'copy', 'Planet', 'Hulk', 'was', 'out', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'found.Being', 'disappointed', 'previous', 'DC', 'releases', 'Gotham', 'Knight', 'crapfest', 'was', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'had', 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'checking', 'out', 'team', 'take', 'Wonder', 'Woman', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'right', 'there', 'New', 'Frontier', 'terms', 'quality.Being', 'origin', 'story', 'movie', 'have', 'share', 'tedious', 'expository', 'dialogue', 'found', 'performances', 'pacing', 'story', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'script.Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Steve', 'Trevor', 'was', 'real', 'highlight', 'Usually', 'humor', 'falls', 'flat', 'animated', 'adventures', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'coming', 'editing', 'process', 'Fillion', 'delivery', 'actually', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'couple', 'times.Alfred', 'Molina', 'also', 'great', 'villain', 'Ares', 'really', 'making', 'emotional', 'moments', 'character', 'stand', 'out', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'evil', 'ones.Keri', 'Russel', 'readings', 'were', 'little', 'bland', 'times', 'fits', 'naive', 'attitude', 'character.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'casual', 'fans', 'character', 'very', 'fun']",N/A

There's a good reason for this, and begins with her title, ""Wonder Woman."" The days when quaintly identifying power with gender are several decades old (even D&D; now refers to monsters as ""lizardfolk"" instead of ""lizardmen""), and Wonder Woman's costume has evolved to only be a little less ridiculous. She's an Amazon, living a modern world, who flies an invisible jet, and lives by a code in which men are inferior. Is she an ancient Amazon with a quaintly anachronistic view of the world or an alien from a highly advanced society with technology so advanced that it looks like magic? ""Wonder Woman"" is not interested in giving you answers.What ""Wonder Woman"" does well is provide a mythical grounding for the character.  Wonder Woman, Diana, is basically a mythical goddess on par with Thor.  It's all the bizarre trappings that dilute her -- her weird magical lariat, the fact that she's dressed up like an American showgirl (""we made you a costume to fit in,"" say the Amazons, and that's a sadly ironic statement), or that she flies the aforementioned super jet when there appears to be no other technology on the island.Wonder Woman (Keri Russell) isn't just a superhero, she's godlike, so her strength, endurance, etc. are unmatched.  And yet she seems perfectly comfortable in a dress and heels (although she's not afraid to complain about it) and highly suspicious of womanizing hot shots like Steve Trevor (Nathan Fillion). But that's okay, they'll probably fall in love anyway, because Wonder Woman is still playing in a boy's world.The truth is that Wonder Woman's background doesn't lend itself to modern storytelling, and this installment does its level best to bridge the gap by smoothing over the rougher edges.  There's a running battle with Ares (Alfred Molina), the Greek Gods make an appearance, and Wonder Woman does get to show off just how physically powerful she is. But the writers aren't courageous enough to just dump some elements without messing with the continuity of the broader universe Wonder Woman and her Amazons inhabit.Thing is, Wonder Woman is mythology-light.  She's an Amazon but doesn't wield a sword, a warrior princess but still works with men, and an anachronistic throwback but but not so outdated that she can't use technology. Until some writer courageously cuts the fat, we'll continue to end up with well-intentioned but muddled backstories like this one.",2,Mythology-light,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,2507,"['might', 'have', 'heard', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'television', 'series', 'been', 'development', 'hell', 'years', 'good', 'reason', 'title', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'days', 'when', 'quaintly', 'identifying', 'power', 'gender', 'are', 'several', 'decades', 'old', 'even', 'D', 'D', 'now', 'monsters', 'lizardfolk', 'instead', 'lizardmen', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'costume', 'evolved', 'only', 'be', 'little', 'less', 'ridiculous', 'Amazon', 'living', 'modern', 'world', 'who', 'invisible', 'jet', 'lives', 'code', 'men', 'are', 'inferior', 'ancient', 'Amazon', 'quaintly', 'anachronistic', 'view', 'world', 'alien', 'highly', 'advanced', 'society', 'technology', 'so', 'advanced', 'magic', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'not', 'interested', 'giving', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'well', 'provide', 'mythical', 'grounding', 'character', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Diana', 'basically', 'mythical', 'goddess', 'par', 'Thor', 'bizarre', 'trappings', 'dilute', 'weird', 'magical', 'lariat', 'fact', 'dressed', 'up', 'American', 'showgirl', 'made', 'costume', 'fit', 'say', 'Amazons', 'sadly', 'ironic', 'statement', 'aforementioned', 'super', 'jet', 'when', 'be', 'other', 'technology', 'island.Wonder', 'Woman', 'Keri', 'Russell', ""n't"", 'just', 'superhero', 'godlike', 'strength', 'endurance', 'etc', 'are', 'unmatched', 'yet', 'perfectly', 'comfortable', 'dress', 'heels', 'not', 'afraid', 'complain', 'highly', 'suspicious', 'womanizing', 'hot', 'shots', 'Steve', 'Trevor', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'okay', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'fall', 'love', 'anyway', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'still', 'playing', 'boy', 'world.The', 'truth', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'background', ""n't"", 'lend', 'modern', 'storytelling', 'installment', 'level', 'best', 'bridge', 'gap', 'smoothing', 'rougher', 'running', 'battle', 'Ares', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Greek', 'Gods', 'make', 'appearance', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'get', 'show', 'off', 'just', 'how', 'physically', 'powerful', 'writers', 'are', ""n't"", 'courageous', 'enough', 'just', 'dump', 'elements', 'messing', 'continuity', 'broader', 'universe', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Amazons', 'inhabit.Thing', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'mythology-light', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'wield', 'sword', 'warrior', 'princess', 'still', 'men', 'anachronistic', 'throwback', 'not', 'so', 'outdated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'technology', 'writer', 'courageously', 'fat', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'end', 'up', 'well-intentioned', 'muddled', 'backstories', 'one']",N/A

The delicate balance of the Amazons is thrown out of whack, however, when a male pilot crash lands on their secret home and the mad god Ares escapes from their own prison. A contest is held to decide who will return pilot Col. Steve Trevor to the strange land of America, and to that winner is soon added the mission of finding and defeating Ares in battle before he can spread his evil bloodlust out of control. Of course, Diana is the victor and given the dangerous task, along with some flashy, powerful, and legendarily sexy gear, and Wonder Woman is born! But that's just half of her story, and her introduction to the modern world, growing relationship with Steve Trevor, and pursuit/battle with Ares and his minions are just as intriguing!Wonder Woman finally gets a film of her own in the new direct-to-DVD animated feature from Warner Premiere animation, and it's probably the best thing they've done so far, which is saying quite a lot! While the similar line of direct-to-DVD animated features from Marvel is pretty good and improving, Warner's DC comics animated films have the fantastic Bruce Timm behind them and all have been excellent. Though Timm's credit is not to undermine that of the directors, in this case Lauren Montgomery who also directed the excellent ""Superman: Doomsday"". Her attention to details and respect for the characters really resulted in something awesome here in ""Wonder Woman"", and the film is both beautiful to watch and great, great entertainment! Whether you're a longtime Wonder Woman fan or new to her whole world, this film is sure to please as long as you don't mind animation that is more mature than what U.S. studios usually provide. Now, I don't mean ""mature"" in every sense of the word, but in comparison to what one usually gets from animated features in the States. We get some uncompromising violence and (subtle) adult subject matter with hardly any ""American animation trying to be adult"" awkwardness. What I mean is, we thankfully hardly get any of that cheese factor that results from Americans not feeling too sure about how to write adult dialogue for animation. This time around, everything flows very naturally and believably, resulting in an overall much better film! You have to not think about the fact that the film you are writing for is animated (and therefore, according to much American thinking, ""for kids"", *pfft*), and the writers behind Wonder Woman seem to have pulled that off! Of course, the voice talent helps a lot too, and boy, does this film have some big names! Keri Russell stars as Wonder Woman (yeah, I had a thing for her back in the day too), Nathan Fillion is Col. Steve Trevor, Alfred ""Doc Oc"" Molina plays the villainous Ares, Rosario Dawson is Amazonian warrior Artemis, Virginia Madsen is Hippolyta, and Oliver Platt is Hades to name a few! Oh, and to address a common concern I'm sure, Wonder Woman is truly gorgeous and sexy in this film, different but not too different from how she was in the Justice League animated TV series from a few years back. Let's face it, some artists draw the Amazon princess and her sisters a bit scary, but no worries here! Now, I just hope they make a sequel and bring Wonder Girl into the cast! And if you're thinking, ""Oh, this is just another superhero origin story,"" stop right there! I know what you're saying, but the Wonder Woman origin, with its basis in Greek myth, is so different from most superhero origin stories, so original, that even if you're tired of superhero films that are origin stories, you are not likely to be bored by this one or feel you have seen it a hundred times before. This is one you need to check out!Now, I personally bought the Blu-Ray release myself, even though I still don't have an HDTV. I have a PS3 and figure I might as well be buying Blu-Rays already. It can be hard to read Blu-Ray menus on standard def TVs sometimes, but Wonder Woman's wasn't too bad. The widescreen visuals are fantastic, of course, even on standard, and we get a great filmmaker commentary option (director Montgomery has a lovely voice). Plus, we get two great featurettes on the creation of Wonder Woman and her relation to ancient myth. There's also the First Look promo for the upcoming ""Green Lantern"" animated feature and old First Look promos from previous releases (including this one). These are great because they're sort of little ""Making-of"" featurettes. But the big surprise is that 4 bonus TV episodes from the Justice League/Justice League Unlimited are included as well. Okay, maybe that's not a big deal if you already have those DVD sets, but I don't yet (They're on my list though). The first is a two-parter from Justice League entitled ""Paradise Lost"", the other two are from Justice League Unlimited: ""Hawk and Dove"" and ""To Another Shore"". These are all episodes that feature Wonder Women prominently and deal with myth. Great stuff! I believe two of these are only on the Blu-Ray. Also, the Blu-Ray comes with a digital copy, though to me those are just extra junk and I'd have preferred a standard def copy as an extra.So, when all is said and done, this is another great animated feature from Warner and DC, and I hope they keep on comin', because they just get better and better! Hope to see more from Wonder Woman too. This is a feature that I believe will please most viewers (who don't have a problem with the violence). Sure, some will be looking for something deeper and some hardcore fanatics will still find something to nitpick on in regards to comic canon, but overall ""Wonder Woman"" is a crowd pleaser and a winner!",5,U.S.-produced animation matures... amply.,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,5892,"['Born', 'earth', 'Themyscira', 'invisible', 'paradise', 'island', 'Amazonian', 'women', 'touched', 'blood',

I just bought a Wonder Woman costume because I recently saw Linda on Yahoo and seeing her took me back to when I was a kid.  So, after purchasing this costume I decided to look for shows to see how my favorite superheroine handled her business and I came across this video.

While Wonder Woman is part of DC's trinity (alongside Superman and Batman), she's never quite reached the uber-popularity of either of the aforementioned characters.  Well, here's hoping that she does, as this animated Wonder Woman feature contains everything that makes her such a great character, from some dynamite action to some surprisingly deep-rooted Greek mythology.  This is an origin story, in which Wonder Woman/Diana (voiced by Kerri Russell) is sent away from her homeland of Themyscria to take down the evil god of war Ares (voiced by Alfred Molina) as he seeks to reclaim his power and unleash destruction across the planet.  Along with her is roguish, womanizing pilot Steve Trevor (voiced by Nathan Fillion), who crash landed on her island and is simply smitten with her as well.  There's heaping amounts of action (that is definitely too violent for very young viewers), a great modern re-telling of Wonder Woman's origins, and a great voice cast that also includes Rosario Dawson, Virginia Madsen, Marg Helgenberger, and Oliver Platt; all of which do great work.  All in all, Wonder Woman is a wonderful (no pun intended) animated feature that old and new fans alike will definitely enjoy, and the DVD special features (including some insightful documentaries and a look at DC's next upcoming animated feature based on Green Lantern) are worth the price of admission alone.",4,The best DC animated flick yet,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,1488,"['DC', 'solid', 'line', 'animated', 'features', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'surprisingly', 'best', 'yet', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'part', 'DC', 'trinity', 'alongside', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'never', 'quite', 'reached', 'uber-popularity', 'aforementioned', 'characters', 'Well', 'here', 'hoping', 'animated', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'feature', 'everything', 'such', 'great', 'character', 'dynamite', 'action', 'surprisingly', 'deep-rooted', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'origin', 'story', 'Wonder', 'Woman/Diana', 'voiced', 'Kerri', 'Russell', 'sent', 'away', 'homeland', 'Themyscria', 'take', 'down', 'evil', 'god', 'war', 'Ares', 'voiced', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'reclaim', 'power', 'unleash', 'destruction', 'planet', 'roguish', 'womanizing', 'pilot', 'Steve', 'Trevor', 'voiced', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'who', 'crash', 'landed', 'island', 'simply', 'smitten', 'as', 'well', 'heaping', 'amounts', 'action', 'definitely', 'too', 'violent', 'very', 'young', 'viewers', 'great', 'modern', 're-telling', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'origins', 'great', 'voice', 'cast', 'also', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'do', 'great', 'work', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'wonderful', 'pun', 'intended', 'animated', 'feature', 'old', 'new', 'fans', 'alike', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'insightful', 'documentaries', 'look', 'DC', 'next', 'upcoming', 'animated', 'feature', 'based', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'alone']",N/A

So far DC comics has missed the mark with two sub par entries, that of SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY, and JUSTICE LEAGUE.  But the good news is...DC has finally done it!! The latest direct to DVD release by Warner brothers and DC comics WONDER WOMAN is truly deserving of the DC comics moniker.I went into this with no expectations...no wait that's not true....I fully expected this to be a complete waste.  I thought if they cant get Superman right..then the odds of them doing right by this property is slim to none.  All I know of Wonder woman is the Linda Carter television show, and the Saturday morning cartoons when I was a kid, but DC has brought a bold new envisioning of the character.  One that fan boys will love and girls can look up to as the wholesome superhero role model she has always tried to be...though the violence in the movie may be a bit much for the very young.The show begins with an exceptionally well animated and choreographed war scene between Ares the god of war and the Amazons and the action does not stop.  This was the most action packed of all of the recent direct to DVD affairs from the comic companies...yes marvels ULTIMATE AVENGERS included.  I don't want to give anything away, but they take the ridiculous idea of a princess goddess superhero who runs around in porn star clothes...and make it make sense...not only that they make it work in a major way.

1214466,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B001LK8SKW,NF,"[1, 1]","This is one of the best DC Universe videos that the Warner Brothers animation studio has produced. It is a retelling of the origin of Paradise Island, of the Amazons, and of Diana, Wonder Woman. The animation is very good, the portrayal of Wonder Woman spot on, the action and battle sequences are superb, and there is even a sense of humor that runs throughout the movie, e.g.:Ares: You seem as eager to meet me on the battlefield as you once did in the bedroom, Hippolyta.Hippolyta: I only hope you prove more skilled in this arena, Ares.The movie opens with a battle between the Amazons and the forces of Ares, God of War, with Queen Hippolyta in full armor leading the way. I found it a bit refreshing, actually, to see Hippolyta really kicking butt and not just being regal and queenly. In the confrontation with Ares, we find that Ares raped her and forced her to bear a son, a son who is now killing everyone he sees on the battlefield. Hippolyta sees her sisters killed in battle and, enraged, she attacks her own son, decapitating him. Ares attacks her in turn but is overcome. Hippolyta is set to kill Ares but is stopped by Zeus and Hera. In return for sparing Ares, Hippolyta is given Paradise Island and is also given charge of Ares, to imprison him forever.We next see Hippolyta sculpting the figure of a baby out of sand, anointing it with her own blood, and praying to the gods to bring the baby to life. Thus is born Diana, daughter of Hippolyta, Wonder Woman. We cut to years later, with Diana a grown woman, dueling with her peers, eager for new challenges. She finds such a challenge when pilot Steve Trevor's plane is shot down and he ejects, landing on the island. He is captured by Diana, after which Hippolyta decides that the time has come to resume contact with the outside world. She hosts a tournament to select the fittest Amazon to be the ambassador but forbids Diana from entering that tournament, sending her instead to guard Ares. A masked Diana secretly enters the tournament and wins.Hippolyta gives Diana her costume, tiara, wristbands, and lasso but the celebration of victory is shortlived, as the news reaches the Amazons of a betrayal and of the escape of Ares. Diana is given an added assignment: to return Steve Trevor and to stop Ares. After some amusing incidents of Diana's culture shock on her first exposure to man's world, Steve and Diana are attacked by a servant of Ares. After defeating him, Diana and Steve track down Ares, finding him attempting to open the gates to Tartarus. Steve and Diana fail to stop Ares and Diana is injured in the process.The portrayal of Hades is one of my biggest gripes about the movie, as he is displayed as an effete, obese, toga-clad Emperor Nero lookalike instead of a powerful Lord of the Underworld, one of the most powerful gods in the pantheon. He agrees to help Ares and frees him from the wristbands attached to him by Zeus that were robbing him of his power. Freed, Ares assembles his army and descends on Washington, D.C., attempting to start a war to end all wars, giving himself unlimited power, power enough to not only conquer mankind but to conquer the very gods themselves. I've omitted some sub-plots and there are several plot twists before all is said and done, with some frightening moments as Ares grows in power, endangering all that lives. The final ending? I'm sure that you can guess.Overall, this was a very solid, very entertaining effort. There is humor here but very little ""camp."" The voice acting is very good, with Alfred Molina, Keri Russell, Nathan Fillion, and Virginia Madsen, as Ares, Diana, Steve, and Hippolyta, respectively, all doing bang-up jobs. The story is well done, with a good mix of quiet moments, humor, tenderness, and action, and some very good interaction between Steve and Diana, as Diana realizes that men aren't quite what she thought they were, good or bad.

1214469,A1DSNDU1A7CIXG,B001LK8SKW,Nuker,"[1, 1]","Up until this movie came out, the recent releases of the DC animated films have felt like little more than fan service. I wasn't all that impressed with Superman:Doomsday (it was hardly the Death of Superman story anyway). New Frontier was great but lacked a grander feel that I think the story deserved. And Gotham Knight seemed more of a cash in on the Dark Knight hype of summer '08.Wonder Woman is more like it! Superman and Batman are great characters but way too over exposed. I have been waiting for years for them to give some service to the other great characters of the DC pantheon. And where better to start than the amazonian princess herself? This treatment felt right. It had the grip of a ""for general audiences"" popcorn movie while still retaining respect for all the great things about the character. This truly showed how she is hardly someone to play second fiddle to Superman or Batman. The movie showed how she is a highly trained combatant and diplomat. Her character design thankfully evoked Greek perfection and athletesism. Her voice design (Keri Russel) added a wonderful youthfulness and energy while still retaining that obligatory naivity you see in all characters cut off from society. In fact the entire cast is great. Alfred Molina does as good a job as anyone could expect but I felt his performance seemed a bit ""phoned in"" as Ares. The voice I did enjoy immensely was Virginia Madsen's characterization as Hippolyta. If Russel sounds like youthful Diana then Madsen would undoubtedly sound like grown Diana (Hippolyta being her mother of course).And the one mark I count most for in any of these projects is the animation. For low budget ""television"" style production it is damn impressive! The action sequences are smooth and kinetic and exactly what you want to see in an ""action feature"". I was worried that a movie about Wonder Woman was going to be made tame but this one delivers on its PG-13 rating.

1214470,AHF97M45JFCB,B001LK8SKW,ONENEO,"[4, 5]","Save for a single exception (Superman Doomsday), I've feverishly preordered and relished in each and every DCAU animated motion picture production that has come from Warner Brothers (yes that means the Superman/ Batman Public Enemies official countdown has already begun).  Wonder Woman had the distinction of being one of two full-length feature films released within a relatively short period of time (the other being Green Lantern First Flight which was released July 28th after WW's March 3rd release date).  As such I waited for GL to drop before ordering both films and had the unique experience of viewing them literally back-to-back.My review pertains specifically to the two-disc Special Edition DVD release and hence the hard facts of the set break down as follows:  Feature runtime of 74 minutes, a rating of PG-13 (due to sequences laced with violence and occasional suggestive material).  The first DVD contains the film, a full commentary track by the creative team, and an exclusive look at the Green Lantern Animated feature.The second disc contains two commentaries pertaining specifically to the Wonder Woman mythos: Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream & Wonder Woman: Daughter of Myth.  Finally Bruce Timm presents two Justice League episodes.The story can best be described as a cross between classic Greek-mythology merged with a modern day setting/ apocalyptic struggle for the fate of humanity.  In a word the scope of this film could best be described as ""massive"".  The show literally opens with an animated battle sequence that would fit right in with live action films such as 300 or Lord of the Rings.In extreme summation, the tale is basically Wonder Woman's origin story retold and fit to include a very modern-day interpretation of Washington DC.  Contained within are both the very earliest origins of the title character (which at some points predate her birth) and then her transformation from Amazon Princess to American super heroine.Plot Spoilers Ahead:The opening battle comes to a violent and graphic conclusion when Hippolyta (Diana's mother) beheads her own son, Thrax, who was conceived by none other than Ares.  Shocked at the fall of their son, Ares is caught off guard and falls to Hippolyta's sword as well.  Fueled with anger and hatred, Hippolyta is poised to slay Ares as well when Zeus intervenes and prevents her from taking Ares' life.Zeus' companionate wife Hera offers to instead bind Ares' powers with gauntlets so that he would be no more of a threat than a mere mortal. In compensation for their cooperation, the Amazons are granted the mystical island of Themyscira (which is cloaked from the eyes of man), where besides remaining forever young and beautiful, they are to hold the shackled Ares prisoner for all time.Life for the Amazons on Themyscira would potentially remain blissfully isolated from the rest of the world if not for the American fighter pilot Steve Trevor who crash lands on the all-female (save for Ares) hidden island.  The task then becomes one of finding an Amazon warrior up to the task of returning the pilot to his homeland of the United States.End of spoilers.The film is really quite beautiful to behold with a nice large color pallet and sweeping sense of scope.  Voice work is typical of the type of stuff Andrea Romano puts out in all of the DC animated productions.  Kerri Russell nails the role of Diana/ WW and Firefly's Nathan Fillion is equally well cast as the energetic/ optimistic Steve Trevor.Keeping in mind that this is the first animated feature devoted specifically to Wonder Woman, the film's production crew did a fantastic job ensuring that the material did her justice (no pun intended).  Much of this is credited to the direction of Lauren Montgomery; a storyboard artist on Justice League Unlimited and Justice League: New Frontier as well as one of three directors on the animated film, Superman: Doomsday.About the biggest complaint that I can partially sympathize with regarding Wonder Woman is that the entire story arc maintains its massive scope/ mythological influence without devoting much time to the Wonder Woman superhero character so beloved in both comic incarnations and in shows like Justice League/ JL Unlimited.  This was most certainly due to the 74-minute runtime and the restrictions involved therein.  Without providing direct spoilers, I will say that the material sets up the characters for a perfect sequel (or even television-based animated series) opportunity in the final moments of the movie.  Should either come to fruition, this animated film will likely be credited as flawlessly presenting the source material for another hit DCAU franchise.  Here's hoping!As it stands however, it's very easy to recommend this film to anyone who has enjoyed the DCAU's past animated efforts, has even the slightest interest in the Wonder Woman mythos, or just plain enjoys fine storytelling in the animated medium.

The special features contained within the two-disc special edition are informative, entertaining, and quite thorough.

I thought the draws were going to be better, with more deatil and better color, the animation is fine not as good as other movies. The plot is weak the Amazons are shown as slaves at the beginning, queen Hyppolita is a brave warrior which is something good, because we always saw her as somebody ""sweet"". Wonder Woman is shown here as a very aggressive woman sometimes with no feelings, the design of her face is ugly, they should have made a pretty woman. Ares is in a cell in Themyscira something I don't find any sense, he's a God and should be in a place where the gods can watch him. The Amazons are Greek and some buildings in Themyscira are pyramids of Mexican style, that's a big mistake, there are many centuries of difference between both civilizations. And I see they have books when they didn't had them. They way they dress it's very modern not of Greek style at all, and, how do they have a jet? Technology is forbidden in the island. This is a very disappointing film full of mistakes with a weak plot and bad draws.

I just knew her and liked her. So the story here is completely new to me and I LOVED it! I really hope there is a live action Wonder Woman movie made and I can only hope it's half as good as this! My one complaint is the invisible plane. It's kind of dumb. But it did provide a pretty fine line in the movie. And as for the corny dialog, it's handled brilliantly in this movie. The jokes are actually funny! And they serve to break up the seriousness of it all. This would be absolutely PERFECT for a live action film! What are they waiting for? DO IT! One of my favorite lines: ""Mr. President, we're still not sure what those things are on the front lawn."" LMAO!The only other thing, the artwork of the characters is rather simplistic. It's just slightly better than what you see on TV. They're animated fantastically but I wish the film had a bigger budget so they could have spent more time making the characters look better.Bring on the live action film please.",5,Best.

1214473,AA0BGTQHWKSQY,B001LK8SKW,Peekablue,"[5, 5]","I will begin by saying that I'm not a follower of the Wonder Woman comic books.  My exposure to her character is limited to the Lynda Carter TV series, the Superfriends cartoons, & the Justice League animated series.For starters, the animation is top notch.  I was immediately drawn into the movie by the epic battle scenes, which were exactly that...epic.  The voice casting was fairly well done.  Virginia Madsen was spot on as Hippolyta.  While I didn't exactly love Keri Russell as Diana, I didn't hate her, either.  Her voice is strong enough but she seemed a little too monotone, to me anyway.The storyline was good.  The action scenes were balanced well with drama & surprising moments of comedy, which made me laugh out loud.  I found Steve Trevor to be a little irritating & I can't see why someone like Diana would fall for him, which is why I gave the movie only 4 stars.  Also, I don't believe they ever explained the invisible jet.  I mean, if they've been essentially cut off from ""man's world"" for hundreds of years, where did the get the technology for the jet?The special features include previews of the new Green Lantern movie, due to be released this summer, which looks very good.  Previews of the Dark Knight animated movie, already released.  Documentaries on the making of this move & the creation of the Wonder Woman comics.  I found them very interesting.  It also features two Justice League Unlimited episodes that star Wonder Woman: To A Distant Shore & Hawk And Dove.Overall this is a great movie.

1214477,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B001LK8SKW,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[16, 30]","I have been anticipating this film since a First Look Featurette for it was revealed to be a special feature on the Batman: Gotham Knight DVD. After months of waiting and hyping myself up I was worried it may not be able to deliver but I'm happy to say I certainly feel like it delivered and then some. Wonder Woman's origin is wonderfully told in this amazing animated epic and my biggest issue is that this feature was only seventy four minutes long.The story has a lot to cover and this feature really tells two stories in half the time that a summer blockbuster has to tell one. The first being about the Amazon's long running battle with Ares and trying to conclude that and the second being about Diana's first experiences in man's world and her journey to finally becoming Wonder Woman. The film maker's obviously knew they were taking on a lot and I certainly admire that they would rather try something great and fail than do something lackluster and succeed. They have a few pacing issues, certain key moments may be given limited time to allow for more gratuitous battle scenes and sure there are some plot threads that suddenly appear unexpectedly at the end but overall the story is coherent, true enough to the character's and has some rewarding payoffs.The animation is AMAZING especially when compared to that attempted in Superman: Doomsday but even still compared to the beautiful work done in Justice League: New Frontier. Each time they put out a new feature DC/WP manage to top themselves and improve upon their previous efforts. I  thought it was well directed especially the two major battle scenes and multiple fight scenes. It's always the little things that make an animated feature and this one has them all over from the Themiscyra scenes all being bathed in a subtle warming white light to the amazing detail of the first shot of New York.I thought the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio track played great and I loved the epic score and summer blockbuster quality sound mixing. Some people have said they didn't like the voice casting/acting but I found it well done and they made me believe the character's with the little fault I found being in the writing. In fact other than the short time limit the only issues I had can be blamed on the writing.Issues I did find in the feature were that while having a mature rating it never tried to have a truly mature story for adults, and while the story they did tell was entertaining and certainly served the action scenes I personally would have liked a little more service to the character's themselves. I don't feel they destroyed the characters or betrayed them by any means but I do feel they could have served them better, especially Diana. That is all just personal opinion though and doesn't take away from the excellent production quality found here.Overall my only issues are with what isn't here, but that is entirely forgivable given the quality of what is here and how well it holds up together. If only they could have made this feature a two hour epic and released it in theaters with a little more focus on script then any issues I have with it could have easily been resolved, but I think if my biggest problem is that it's so well done I wish I could experience more than that means they've done a more than wonderful job.This feature is really just the starting point for the character and hopefully they will produce more Wonder Woman independent feature's if not direct sequels to this feature itself. The way it ends with Diana having really just become Wonder Woman leaves viewer's wanting more of her character and I hope that's what DC and Warner Premiere intend to give us. 5 stars on blue spandex.

Garrard ""the G-man""","[1, 1]","While the supplemental extras tend to be either ignored or viewed by only the most ardent of fans, the ones on this two-disc set serve to provide background on Wonder Woman's creator, the time in which the character emerged, and her revolutionary significance in both the emergence of the rights of women and pop culture.The two documentaries, ""Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream"" and ""Wonder Woman: Daughter of Myth"" are truly engrossing, painting a most positive portrait of the comic book icon, showing why she ranks up there with Superman and Batman as one of the greatest creations in the DC Universe.The two bonus cartoons, episodes from the ""Justice League"" series, are good but a better pair would have been the two-part installment ""Paradise Lost,"" which coincidentally features some of the same characters that appear in the ""Wonder Woman"" film.""Paradise Lost"" actually reveals one of the weaknesses of the film: primarily in the voice-acting arena.  The television installment features Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, Susan Sullivan as Hippolyta, the great English actor John Rhys-Davies as Hades, along with horror icon Robert Englund as Felix Faust.

1214482,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001LK8SKW,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","Mind you, my first choice to bring WONDER WOMAN into the 21st Century is Joss Whedon, who would not only manage to update our heroine but completely reimagine it. But this updating is based not on William Marston's original Wonder Woman, but later updatings. So while it doesn't break any new ground, it covers the familiar one is very satisfying fashion.The best thing about the movie is that while it covers the Wonder Woman origin story as well as you might hope, they also work in a nice story, with god of war Ares attempting to destroy the world, while Diana strives to prevent him. And the story is also enlivened by numerous moments of wit and intelligence. The entire production is several notches above just about any other animated superhero film.The voice over talent is uneven and is the weakest part of the film. In the two lead roles we have the stars of WAITRESS reunited. Nathan Fillion is outstanding as Steve, but I was mildly disappointed with Keri Russell as Diana (I love Keri Russell as a rule and think we need many, many more movies with her). Alfred Molina and Oliver Platt are both excellent as Ares and Hades respectively, while Virginia Madsen is great as Hippolyta, but far too many of the supporting talent disappoints.Still, this is a highly entertaining film. It doesn't correct the unjustified neglect of Woman Woman, one of the greatest of DC heroes (along with Superman and Batman, one of the Big Three) by DC in producing their movies.

1214492,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B001LK8SKW,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[2, 3]","Let's face it--the animation division of Time Warner has pretty much been the dominant division in this field for close to 70 years.  From the Bugs Bunny, Road Runner and other shorts of the 1940-1960 era, Warner Brothers have been able to create story, character and humor with great consistency.  But when Time Warner acquired DC Comics, it gave the animation division a whole new area to go into.  To that end, Time Warner--between the 1989 Batman movie and 1992's Batman Returns--launched ""Batman: The Animated Series"" for Fox Kids in 1992...and the collaboration between DC Comics/Warner Animation took off, giving us 13 years of great animation and storytelling.  This is a credit to two people--the great Bruce Timm, whose vision brought the storytelling to B:TAS and its successors (Batman Beyond, Superman: The Animated Series, and the Justice League/Justice League Unlimited) and allowed the drawn characters to be ""fleshed out""--having personalities and conflicts, being human.  The other person who should receive loads of credit...is the longtime voice casting director for Warner/DC, Andrea Romano.  She has not been afraid of the name of the vocal actor outweighing the drawn character; if anything, the vocal performances have enhanced the art--obviously Kevin Conroy's Batman, Mark Hamill's Joker; Clancy Brown's Lex Luthor, or Carl Lumbly's J'onn J'onzz from the JL/JLU.It seems logical that Warners/DC would step from the television work to the feature-length films they've been doing the last few years, and it seems linear to think that they would concentrate on origin stories, which is the premise of Wonder Woman.  Continuing with the philosophy that Timm originated with B:TAS, the story does have an adult tone that some parents might not think their children ready for.  It is a VERY good story, both in terms of art and voice work.  Once again, Romano has put together a very good vocal cast--Keri Russell and Nathan Fillion have worked on-screen together (""Waitress"").  I thought Russell might have been a bit light for Diana, but since it's a ""first-time"" story it was probably wiser to have a younger voice...Fillion seems to bring a lot of ""Firefly"" and ""Castle"" to Steve Trevor; making him less the classic ""Dude in Distress"" from the early days of Marston's art to a little bit of a partner with the Princess.  Alfred Molina's work as Ares is insidious and greasy, in line with many of his live-action turns as villains.  Virginia Madsen makes a great Hyppolyta, Rosario Dawson gives great anger to Artemis, and Oliver Platt steals the scenes where he voices Hades.But as GOOD as this movie is, it points up a long-term problem that Time Warner has had regarding the character.  The last five years, Warners/DC Comics/Legendary Pictures has been working on a live-action Wonder Woman project which has gone through names conncecting to it and pulling out, speculation on many a website as to who gets to put on the breastplate and the crown...just a lot of starts and stops when it comes to getting the production started, much less on film.  The biggest problem--and she gets mentioned only slightly in the special features in the two-disk set--is Lynda Carter hasn't been reborn.  If the casting directors can't find a 23-year old brunette who's at least 5'10"", athletic, and is (ahem) rather well built (Trevor/Fillion's observation about Diana's ""upper-body"" is great...and makes the movie PG-13 by itself), then it's better to draw Wonder Woman simply because no live person is going to look better than the artist's version of her.Because of the story, the art, and the brilliant voice work; this version of ""Wonder Woman"" is highly suggested.

1214493,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B001LK8SKW,Sean Curley,"[170, 207]","Created in 1941 by American scientist William Marston (with assists from his wife Elizabeth and their polyamourous lover Olive Byrne), Diana of Themyscira, Wonder Woman, has become one of the most famous heroes in comics.  She is usually counted among the ""Big Three"" of DC, her owners, alongside Superman and Batman.  This is, however, illusory in many respects; the character has never received even a fraction of the popular or creator attention of her alleged compeers (having, for example, to settle for a supporting role in Bruce Timm's own DC Animated Universe when the others got series of their own).  This is the first new solo Wonder Woman project in any medium apart from comics in more than thirty years.As mentioned, Timm and co. have worked with the character before, on ""Justice League Unlimited"", an exercise which was frankly a disastrous adaptation of the character.  Stripped of her personality and most of the important parts of her origin, with her villains and supporting cast either not there at all or bland ciphers, very little of what made the character great came through there.  I was apprehensive approaching this DVD, because, while a huge fan of Timm's animation, his track record with Wonder Woman is not good.  It was also hardly encouraging for writer Michael Jelenic to admit to not having known anything about the character before he was assigned to the film.  I should say, some spoilers are to be found.The basic plot, as has been outlined in the other reviews here, is in common with Diana's previous comics origin stories:  Ares, God of War (Mars, in Marston's original version) is loose and out to destroy the world, and it is up to the champion of his rivals in the Greek Pantheon to stop him.  The Amazons, mythical race of warrior women, hold a contest to determine who will face the threat, and Diana, defying her mother's wishes, enters and wins.  Whether or not she is accompanied by Steve Trevor as a love interest varies; here, she is.  Nothing revolutionary here, but there's no reason to radically change a solid and important story (which Timm and co. did in JLU).The animation is beautiful; by far the best stuff in any of the DC DVDs they've done so far. The Wonder Woman design is appreciably Greek, athletic and powerful while still very beautiful (though DC's own artists have a hard time rendering this version of the design consistently on the posters and other promotional material; compare the covers of the single- and two-disk versions of this DVD) and many other characters, such as Artemis, are rendered more or less perfectly.  The film can also be pretty funny, and it's pretty bloody, too; the battle scenes are close to flawless.  This is easily the finest action yet depicted onscreen in DC's animated efforts, which is quite a high bar to clear.  Bettering JLU, there's a more serious take on the character's mythology here, both in terms of the actual Greek mythology and Themysciran society, which in this case is inhabited by some actual characters with more than one dimension, rather than a bunch of drones lorded over by Diana's undeveloped mother.And now we arrive at the parts of the story where the writers are asked to really interpret the character, and, once again, they trip (though on the whole I'd say not as badly). Sigh.  I know (moreso than most, even) that Wonder Woman as a character has had a lot of different takes over her 70-year history, but in the broad scheme of things, there are in fact thematic elements that have been consistent from Marston onward. One of these, and really chief to the whole character, is that the Amazons are a superior and enlightened society who prize culture and the arts as high as martial prowess, love peace, and are meant to bring it to the wider world and save it. Get that through your skulls, Timm and co: superior society. Not ""bloodthirsty Xena clones"" and ""strawman feminist"". Because that's more or less what they are here, just like in JL/U. They're aggressively misandrist, to a point that they'e never been in the comics outside of abortions like Amazons Attack. If anything, they learn a valuable lesson on tolerance from Steve Trevor. They've got no philosophy or higher ideas here.Speaking of Steve Trevor, he's back in his Silver Age form, ie, sexist cad. Why do writers keep thinking a feminist hero should fall in love with a cad who is constantly making jokey, piggish advances? I mean, if you want him as a love interest instead of the Perez version, at least go with Perez's take on his personality: Post-Crisis Steve was a competent, gentlemanly fellow.On the subject of Diana's power levels; getting the thing that most people will talk about out of the way, she can't fly, which is lame (because creators are all obsessed with that stupid jet), but not insurmountable; the bigger issue is that her power levels are wildly inconsistent. When she first meets Steve, they get into a fist fight, at which he, in another unbelievable moment, actually holds his own for a bit, both in terms of martial arts proficiency and knocking her around. In other scenes (such as the clip they've shown online of her fighting Deimos), she's a mid-tier bruiser, throwing guys through walls and punching them across the room.  Jelenic seems desperate to avoid any suggestion that Steve isn't Diana's equal in order to not offend male audience members, which is a terrible way to approach this sort of thing; Steve is not Diana's equal in combat in the slightest, nor should he have to be.Setting aside these things (which, apart from power levels, are subjective, I suppose), parts of the plot/character-interaction are just baffling. Consider, after winning the Contest while in disguise to avoid her mother's ban on entering, Diana unmasks before the crowd and her mother, the Queen, who...has no reaction to this, whatsoever. That's a pivotal moment in the story, but Hippolyta just blankly offers congratulations.  This has always been a key moment in the characters' relationship, but instead, there's nothing.Timm's best work (ie, most of it) shows audiences the core of his heroes, what makes them unique and awesome as characters. Jelenic, the writer, mentioned something along these lines in his interviews: when talking about Hippolyta, he described her as ""almost Wonder Woman, but she isn't, which leads you to the question of why isn't she Wonder Woman? What is is about her and Diana that makes Diana Wonder Woman?""Jelenic never answers his own question. The war with Ares ultimately requires of Diana nothing that her mother couldn't have done, or Artemis (and not just because the Amazons all have the same powers here); absolutely anybody can use the Lasso of Truth here (indeed, it's Hippolyta's), and the defeat of Ares comes when Diana kills him with her sword.Ooooh, nobody else could have done that. Except they can, and they do.The contrast with George Perez's work in ""Gods & Mortals"" is just jarring here; Perez and later writers (such as Byrne, whose work on the character I find problematic in a lot of respects, did a lot of good in this respect) connect Diana's lasso with something inherent in her character, her devotion to Truth. When Perez's Diana faced down the God of War, she couldn't defeat him physically; instead, she realized that that wouldn't work, and instead she uses the lasso to show him that if he gets his wish to unleash ultimate war on the world in the nuclear age, he'll destroy the world, and thus all his worshippers, and, ultimately, he and the other gods will die too. That's something that nobody else could have done; that's why it was crucial that Wonder Woman save the world. Superman would have failed there; Batman would have failed; the rest of the JLA would have failed. It's Diana's wisdom (sufficient to outreason a god) and her special truth power that save the day.I mean, it's great that they depict her as a great combatant, but that's the bare minimum for any superhero; we go a bit further here by having her and the other Amazons unapologetically use lethal force (suck on that, Geoff Johns), which is a bonus. But, fundamentally, the creators' answer here for what makes Wonder Woman cool and unique as a superhero is that she beats people up real good. The lasso is just an accessory that they use as fodder for jokes about people telling the truth a la ""Liar Liar"", rather than something that says something profound about her.Maturity is more than just showing blood and making titty jokes; it's frustrating, when writers have laid the groundwork for a far more adult and intelligent Wonder Woman, one that wouldn't run afoul of any censor, Timm and his very talented associates seem incapable of taking us there.",3,Both pleasing and problematic.,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,8722,"['Created', '1941', 'American', 'scientist', 'William',

1214496,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B001LK8SKW,Simon,"[3, 4]","Wonder Woman is the 4th release from DC's Animated Movies line, following Batman: Gotham Knight, New Frontier, and Superman: Doomsday. This is an origin story detailing Wonder Woman's first encounter with man's world, her relationship with pilot Steve Trevor and her quest to stop the God of War Ares from crushing humanity.This is, by far, one of the best direct-to-video efforts you'll watch in a long, long time. Usually with these ""B-level"" animated films you'll find at least one key element missing - whether it be a plodding and cliched script, weak animation, or half-hearted voice acting. Wonder Woman sidesteps all of these pitfalls. The story is an original creation (credited to acclaimed writers Gail Simone & Michael Jelenic), and not an over-crammed adaptation of some mega comic arc. It finds time to introduce the Amazons, setup the origin elements, show Diana's culture shock in her new surroundings, develop the supporting cast, add a romance sub-plot, develop and further the plans of the villains, and also stuff in tons of exciting action sequences on top of everything else.The voice cast shines. Keri Russell makes a great Wonder Woman. Whereas I felt it took the prior ""Justice League"" incarnation of Wonder Woman a season or two to truly find her voice, Russell's inflections nail equal parts inner strength, femininity, and naivet&eacute; depending on Wonder Woman's situation. Fan favourite Nathan Fillion is much the same scoundrel hero he frequently plays, and it lends to a cool, modernized interpretation of Steve Trevor as well as add comic relief. Alfred Molina's Ares rounds out the main trio in the way great enemies should: calm, confident, and always threatening.DC animation has been consistently topping itself in terms of mature storytelling since the Batman animated series premiered in the 90s, and Wonder Woman carries on that tradition in multiple ways. There's the brutal action sequences that range from massive Greek epics to traditional hero-versus-villain fights; the dialogue is peppered with innuendo and mature references from line one, and the script hits all the gender issues Wonder Woman is known for raising.  Bottom line, there's a lot for fans of mature animation here. Probably not suitable for all ages, but it's great WB gets the older demographic.If you can't already tell, this is a must-see adventure. Wonder Woman has traditionally been one of the hardest heroes to adapt, and this DTV does her proud.

However, its clean style makes up for some of the lack of detail.Huge story holes and plot skipping.  Not normally a bad thing in a comic, but I think a little more story would have been better.Voice acting was only so-so, occasionally doing a little better.[mild spoilers coming]The constant man hating got to be a little much pretty early.  Yes, I know they are Amazons.  Yes, I know they have strong feelings about men.  Yes, I know Ares is a man.  However, the constant male put downs and remarks not to mention the poor little girl who was being ""oppressed"" by the mean boys was just too much.  I wasn't really offended, I just thought it wasn't Wonder Woman.  Wonder Woman is much more fair and intelligent than this movie shows.  No matter what happens, Wonder Woman is on it and she knows what to do.  She is a lot like Superman in that regard.  She can get mad, but it never messes up what she is doing.  And, yes, I know she is less experienced in dealing with the outside world but she is not less experienced in dealing with other people. She also would never kick a man in the groin, because it wouldn't be honorable, any more than she would stab someone in the back.  There was some male/female compromise at the end, but only by having Wonder Woman act like a bimbo??

Berntsen,"[1, 2]","Something I really appreciate about the movie-- whenever I meet someone who thinks Wonder Woman is cheesy, and they don't really know anything about the character, I can pop in the Blu-Ray and in 70 minutes show them just how cool of a character she is. DC Animation really nailed it with this movie, because it really is a perfect showcase of what a great character Wonder Woman is, and they manage to keep it accessible for both male and female audiences. Even if it has imperfections, it's still one of the best examples out there of how to make Wonder Woman both cool and accessible, and you don't have to pester your friends to attempt to read a comic in order to show it to them.Thus movie is the right way to do Wonder Woman. She is bad ass, beautiful, and a truly empowered woman who embraces her woman instead of denying it. As a man, I find the strength and spirit of her truly admirable, and if God someday blesses me with daughters, this is a hero I would be happy to see them looking up to, in place of the weak, co-dependent floozies that they are currently bombarded with (I'm looking at you, Bella Swan). I'd also be happy to see my sons respect her the way I'm sure they will with Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man, because it's good for boys to have strong female characters to look up to, as well. This is a true female superhero movie-- it's got action, adventure, lots of Greek mythology, and even a bit of romantic comedy. If you like superheros then you should definitely check it out, because this is the Princess of the Amazons at her finest. If you watch this movie and still don't like Wonder Woman, you probably never will.Also, the picture quality on this disc is great! Once you've seen 2D animation on Blu-Ray, you won't want to go back to DVD! It comes with a lot of great special features, too, including some episodes of Justice League featuring her.

Wonder Woman, the legendary Amazonian princess is given her first in depth origin story. This is a first for many comic book and DC animated universe fans alike and it is done in a fan appreciative manor.This story takes the fan favorite Wonder Woman stories and meshes them altogether in traditional Bruce Timm story telling, relatiable characters and an excellent voice cast. I would never have imagined that the well known Kerri Russel was able to portray such a strong heroine. Yet, this is an origin story so it is a much younger version of the character so it makes sense to bring a voice that can be transformed into a much stronger voice through time. The other cast memebers consist of Alfred Molina, Virginia Madesen and Rosario Dawson (to name a few). The outlay of the story is not constant brooding darkness, but it is a mature story so there are some real topics and often humerous moments that make it very real.Bruce Timm, is really taking full advantage of these films. His films are not always made with the pure satisfactory of the fans in mind. These are chances to show new innovative portrayals of the DC animated universe. Each film has a different mood, different style and never the same actors twice. I think that's what makes me want to see these films because they are different. The next film on the horizon is a new twist on Green Lantern. If you pick up the double disk there is an excellent documentry on the new project and because of this new innovative story they have in store for us, I cannot wait.",5,Pure Girl Power!

H.,"[2, 4]","I am not a huge Wonder Woman fan, but I know her story, and as of late have picked up quite a few of her trade paperbacks, and all I can say is, the Steve as Letch thing took me totally by surprise. Air Force pilots are not only trained to be fighters but are also trained to be ambassadors of the Air Force and the United States. All I kept thinking was, ""Wow, this is really disrespectful to fighters like the Navy's Blue Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds.""Taking it too seriously, probably, but even a writer who knew nothing about the military would not have an officer acting like that. Especially the remarks he made to a rookie pilot on a training mission.I mean, don't get me wrong, in the locker room, they may banter like that, but when meeting new people from new lands?No.Never.They are too disciplined for that.I wish they would have stuck to the comic book origins, which would have been better. But, they do odd things with Wonder Woman. Now, in the comic books, Athena is running around Olympus looking like she works on Wall Street and uses a laptop computer.She's a goddess, and she uses a laptop computer?I was hoping Bruce Timm would stick with the version from Justice League. I thought that characterization of her was very good. They made her the female Superman like she was back in the forties. Like she is today. I also wish they'd gotten Susan Eisenberg to come back for the voice work. She did it extremely well, conveying both strength and femininity.To me, she is to Wonder Woman what Kevin Conroy is to Batman.The story-line is thin, Trevor comes off downright unlikeable at times and tolerable at others. Like other people have noted, she is supposed to be powerful and a mortal decks her.If you've never seen a Wonder Woman animation version, you'll probably like it. If you've seen Justice League, you may--or probably--won't.The character has gotten the short end of the stick in writing for a long time, although the writers of her books today are far above what she's had. I would have thought that since she is ranked among the Big Three in the DC Universe next to Superman and Batman, we would have gotten something with a little more substance.I would recommend you check out Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.Best Wonder Woman line from Justice League:She is stuck in the old west with Superman and Batman and is deflecting bullets with her bracelets, and turns to them with a bored look on her face and says, ""These are the biggest, slowest bullets I have ever seen.""ROFL!!!!I don't know what changed from Justice League to this, but the great writing mixed with the slick humor is nowhere to be found here.",3,What Changed from Justice League to This?,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,2665,"['am', 'not', 'huge', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'fan', 'know', 'story', 'late', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'quite', 'few', 'trade', 'paperbacks', 'can', 'say', 'Steve', 'Letch', 'thing', 'took', 'totally', 'surprise', 'Air', 'Force', 'pilots', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'trained', 'be', 'fighters', 'are', 'also', 'trained', 'be', 'ambassadors', 'Air', 'Force', 'United', 'States', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'Wow', 'really', 'disrespectful', 'fighters', 'Navy', 'Blue', 'Angels', 'Air', 'Force', 'Thunderbirds', 'Taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'probably', 'even', 'writer', 'who', 'knew', 'nothing', 'military', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'officer', 'acting', 'Especially', 'remarks', 'made', 'rookie', 'pilot', 'training', 'mission.I', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'locker', 'room', 'may', 'banter', 'when', 'meeting', 'new', 'people', 'new', 'lands', 'No.Never.They', 'are', 'too', 'disciplined', 'that.I', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'stuck', 'comic', 'book', 'origins', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'do', 'odd', 'things', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Now', 'comic', 'books', 'Athena', 'running', 'around', 'Olympus', 'looking', 'Wall', 'Street', 'laptop', 'computer.She', 'goddess', 'laptop', 'computer', 'was', 'hoping', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'would', 'stick', 'version', 'Justice', 'League', 'thought', 'characterization', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'made', 'female', 'Superman', 'was', 'back', 'forties', 'today', 'also', 'wish', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'Susan', 'Eisenberg', 'come', 'back', 'voice', 'work', 'did', 'extremely', 'well', 'conveying', 'strength', 'femininity.To', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'what', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'Batman.The', 'story-line', 'thin', 'Trevor', 'off', 'downright', 'unlikeable', 'times', 'tolerable', 'others', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'noted', 'supposed', 'be', 'powerful', 'mortal', 'decks', 'her.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'animation', 'version', ""'ll"", 'probably', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Justice', 'League', 'may', 'probably', ""won't.The"", 'character', 'gotten', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'writing', 'long', 'time', 'writers', 'books', 'today', 'are', 'far', 'what', 'had', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'ranked', 'Big', 'Three', 'DC', 'Universe', 'next', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'substance.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'check', 'out', 'Justice', 'League', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited.Best', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'line', 'Justice', 'League', 'stuck', 'old', 'west', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'deflecting', 'bullets', 'bracelets', 'bored', 'look', 'face', 'are', 'biggest', 'slowest', 'bullets', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.', 'ROFL', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'changed', 'Justice', 'League', 'great', 'writing', 'mixed', 'slick', 'humor', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'here']",N/A

Ergo the dialog is cheesy, the plot predictable, most of the characters forgettable, and the action a bit stale.Granted a bit of research shows that some of the action was edited or outright cut to gain a PG-13 rating instead of an R rating. Right off hand, DC should have published the original version as an Unrated edition; but that's not what made this particular movie a 4 star watch.Nathan Fillion gives this film a star just by...
