The sections are:Warm Up-A quick little dance routine with a lot of plies, and some stretching for the legs and neck.Island Jam 1-This is the most fun of all the routines, I think, but it is hip-hop with quite a bit of island dance mixed in.  The dances are easy, but the arms are big which makes it cardio.Island Jam 2-I didn't find this as fun as the first one or as island like.  The moves are really all hip-hop here, but they are still good cardio builders, although there is one step Marie (the instructor) breaks down a move really slowly which causes my heart rate to plummet, but I just fast forward.Fast and Funky 1-This section I expected to get hip-hop dance, and that is what I got.  Unfortunately, Marie breaks down ALL the moves in this routine to teach them slowly, so I miss half of the routine fast forwarding, but it is a fun section, still.Fast and Funky 2-This routine is probably the sassiest of them all.  All of the moves have an attitude to them, and it is my least favorite.  Not because of the sass, but just because I didn't really like the moves.Diva Dance 1-This dance routine is mostly Latin, and the first few moves are Cha-Cha and Samba, but soon after that Marie tosses Latin away and just goes back to hip-hop moves.  I still liked this section.Diva Dance 2-This one seemed a bit Broadway with (surprise, surprise!) hip-hop mixed in.  This was a really fun combo, though.Cool Down-The cool-down stays with some Broadway slower moves, and Marie does a few stretch combos, but she should have done much more.  She stretches your neck, back, and shoulders and that's it.  It does not stretch your legs at all.This is a great DVD, and I love hip-hop dance I just wish some of the sections would have been more what they say.  To the men, though, you might want to skip this DVD because there are no male backups, although the moves aren't too feminine.

920893,A30OGYCJM4B10S,B000A3XY82,atisheh,"[0, 0]","At first, this workout seems pretty cheesy -- the moves are a little silly, and Marie Forleo likes to give themed encouragements along the lines of, ""You're on the island, mon!""Still, it's very well-structured, and it's perhaps that same cheesyness that makes it fun to work along with. Aside from an effective warm-up and cool-down, there are six dance segments. Each one starts with a simple move, builds on that with more moves, until you have a mini-choreography. You then do each move in the entire choreography twice, and finally, the whole choreo with only one rep of each move. Forleo always introduces the basic footwork, then adds stylizations like twists or hip bumps, then arm work, and finally chest or head stylizations. This is makes it easy to pick up the moves, and you can work at your level.The variety of dancers/exercisers in the background is really nice. Some are more into the dancing, some have less athletic bodies, some do smaller or imperfect versions of the moves.I tend to find cardio boring, but Cardio Dance Blast is a great way to stay mentally as well as physically engaged throughout a workout.",4,Great and not-boring way to get your heart pumping,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,1129,"['first', 'workout', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'moves', 'are', 'little', 'silly', 'Marie', 'Forleo', 'give', 'themed', 'encouragements', 'lines', ""'re"", 'island', 'mon', 'Still', 'very', 'well-structured', 'perhaps', 'same', 'cheesyness', 'fun', 'work', 'along', 'Aside', 'effective', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'are', 'six', 'dance', 'segments', 'one', 'simple', 'move', 'more', 'moves', 'have', 'mini-choreography', 'then', 'do', 'move', 'entire', 'choreography', 'twice', 'finally', 'whole', 'choreo', 'only', 'one', 'rep', 'move', 'Forleo', 'always', 'basic', 'footwork', 'then', 'stylizations', 'twists', 'hip', 'bumps', 'then', 'arm', 'work', 'finally', 'chest', 'head', 'stylizations', 'easy', 'pick', 'up', 'moves', 'can', 'work', 'level.The', 'variety', 'dancers/exercisers', 'background', 'really', 'nice', 'are', 'more', 'dancing', 'have', 'less', 'athletic', 'bodies', 'do', 'smaller', 'imperfect', 'versions', 'moves.I', 'tend', 'find', 'cardio', 'boring', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'Blast', 'great', 'way', 'stay', 'mentally', 'as', 'well', 'physically', 'engaged', 'workout']",Crunch - Cardio Dance Blast

I think the music is good and the moves are fun enough to keep me going through the whole thing.  Like most dance aerobics, Marie uses the ""building block"" method- during each routine, you'll keeping adding and adding moves until you have maybe 10 steps.  It will take a little time to get them all down pat, but even though I couldn't keep up right away, after about two or three times I had most of them.

What I do like is that there are some moves that are unique (you know how every exercise dvd has the same moves???), and the routines are short and fast, and easy to pick up. The problems are that the routines are short and fast and I never get winded or even that sweaty. You learn three steps, do the routine through a few times repeating each step twice. Then do the routine 4 times through and only doing the steps once. So, once you get going, you really only get 3 minutes of faster-paced movement. The steps are fun, so sometimes I put this dvd on after I complete a more strenuous workout routine. ALSO!! The outfits are SUPER distracting. There is one woman in jeans, and looking like she just stumbled into the class. Another woman is in a binkini top and baggy bottoms, as if she's going to the beach, but the most annoying outfit is the camoflauge pants of one woman, with one pant leg ripped off. No, not one short pant leg and one long pant leg, but a pant leg ripped, jagged, and hanging down. It's just bizarre, distracting, and really stupid. The other ladies look great in fun, colorful outfits. Can't we all just do that? :) Oh, also what I don't like about this (and the other crunch dvd I have) is that it seems like someone off camera tells them &#34;Okay, everyone hoot NOW!&#34; because they'll all WOOHOO at once, and at weird times, not just like the end of the routine. It feels so forced. OOOH! One more thing... there is a point where the bikini-topped woman rolls her eyes in exaggeration because we are about to do the workout 4 times through...as if she can't believe what this task-master is asking from her!

It's quick (about 30 minutes) but you really sweat while doing the dance moves.  It does take a while to get the dance moves down but once you relax and really get into it; it becomes second nature.  After a 3 week break from intense workouts, I returned to this one to get back in shape and to get back to a little bit of cardio.  I had forgotten how much fun it is to do.  Combine this with your favorite strength workout and you've got a really fun routine or just do it alone for your cardio portion.

920926,A2XSGDB4CWSS5J,B000A3XY82,ShellBear,"[13, 16]","This dance dvd is just so annoying on so many levels, I  don't know where to start. But I'll compare it to other dance fitness DVDs I have and hope it helps you make a decision.I've got Marie Forleo's Prevention Dance Yourself Thin  - she's really great in that  - explains the steps  clearly and is pleasant and encouraging.  My only criticism of that DVD is that it is a tad slow and  you spend a lot of time marching rather than repeating the steps over and over - you have to do it yourself to work up a sweat.  But she's very pleasant and doesn't shout at you in this one.  There are maybe 4 backup dancers who aren't distracting but help you follow the steps.So I bought the Crunch Cardio Dance Blast thinking, based on other reviews, that it would be a great workout and as I liked Marie, was looking forward to it.  But I find with this one, she's totally different - she shouts ""that was awesome"" just so many times ,she tells you to ""crack it, uh-huh"" ( whatever that means!), she squeals quite a bit, she rushes through the steps  (yes, you can rewind and replay but still, it's annoying) and the steps are just not much fun. I  couldn't believe it was Marie because she is just so different.  Also, there are about 7-8 backup dancers who look like they're at a party (one looks like she is high on illicit substance) , they are distracting and it just makes the screen look so busy.  They hoot and holler too, and are not that helpful if you can't follow the steps.It's like this Crunch DVD is aimed at a slightly younger audience -( I'm in my thirties) with all the ""attitude"", the squeals, shouting and ""whoo-hoos"". I wouldn't mind so much if the dance steps themselves were effective, but they're not very interesting and I've barely gone through the complete routine. After becoming familiar with the steps,  maybe  I've  done it twice in a month ...  and even then I need to turn the sound down so I don't hear all the squeals.If you're new to fitness dance DVDs, like I was, and don't know which to get or who is good, then I suggest the Crunch Fat Burning Dance Party and 10 Minute Solutions dvds with Jennifer Galardi.  She is a much better instructor - the moves are fun and entertaining and she is not at all annoying, kinda cute the way she encourages you with the steps. While others have said her steps are hard to follow, it's just a matter of watching, rewinding, doing it in slow motion until you have it.  I've never  done any dance before in my life and  have picked up the steps easily enough.  You do work out a sweat with those ones.So this one just makes my blood pressure rise and it's no surprise that I do not recommend it.  Marie's other - the Prevention one, is good for beginners, but not terribly vigorous , whereas the Jennifer Galardi dvds are fantastic.",1,Awesomely and intensely irritating,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,2797,"['dance', 'dvd', 'just', 'so', 'annoying', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'start', ""'ll"", 'compare', 'other', 'dance', 'fitness', 'DVDs', 'have', 'hope', 'make', 'decision.I', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Marie', 'Forleo', 'Prevention', 'Dance', 'Yourself', 'Thin', 'really', 'great', 'steps', 'clearly', 'pleasant', 'encouraging', 'only', 'criticism', 'DVD', 'tad', 'slow', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'marching', 'rather', 'repeating', 'steps', 'have', 'do', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'very', 'pleasant', ""n't"", 'shout', 'one', 'are', 'maybe', '4', 'backup', 'dancers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'distracting', 'help', 'follow', 'steps.So', 'bought', 'Crunch', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'Blast', 'thinking', 'based', 'other', 'reviews', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'workout', 'liked', 'Marie', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'find', 'one', 'totally', 'different', 'was', 'awesome', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'crack', 'uh-huh', 'quite', 'bit', 'steps', 'yes', 'can', 'rewind', 'replay', 'still', 'annoying', 'steps', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'fun', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'Marie', 'just', 'so', 'different', 'Also', 'are', '7-8', 'backup', 'dancers', 'who', 'look', ""'re"", 'party', 'one', 'high', 'illicit', 'substance', 'are', 'distracting', 'just', 'screen', 'look', 'so', 'busy', 'hoot', 'holler', 'too', 'are', 'not', 'helpful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'steps.It', 'Crunch', 'DVD', 'aimed', 'slightly', 'younger', 'audience', ""'m"", 'thirties', 'attitude', 'squeals', 'shouting', 'whoo-hoos', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'dance', 'were', 'effective', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'barely', 'gone', 'complete', 'routine', 'becoming', 'familiar', 'steps', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'done', 'twice', 'month', 'even', 'then', 'need', 'turn', 'sound', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'squeals.If', ""'re"", 'new', 'fitness', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'get', 'who', 'good', 'then', 'suggest', 'Crunch', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Dance', 'Party', '10', 'Minute', 'Solutions', 'dvds', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'much', 'better', 'instructor', 'moves', 'are', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'not', 'annoying', 'kinda', 'cute', 'way', 'steps', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'steps', 'are', 'hard', 'follow', 'just', 'matter', 'watching', 'rewinding', 'doing', 'slow', 'motion', 'have', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'dance', 'life', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'steps', 'easily', 'enough', 'do', 'work', 'out', 'sweat', 'one', 'just', 'blood', 'pressure', 'rise', 'surprise', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'Marie', 'other', 'Prevention', 'one', 'good', 'beginners', 'not', 'terribly', 'vigorous', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'dvds', 'are', 'fantastic']",Crunch - Cardio Dance Blast

I totally understand having a good time for the camera, but some of the facial expressions were a bit much.
