Much to my wife's dismay I flip this movie into the DVD player just after midnight on new years (hey, it's fair game I had to sit through Sweeney Todd for her). Were lounged across the living room floor, and I have the home theatre system up way too loud as usual (Yes, I still like to play my music way too loud too).The opening moments of the film were a little disappointing for me. It starts slow, and there are some tawdry moments in this script for sure. That being said it's a super hero movie!!! I mean do you really expect superb scripts and shakespearian acting? There is no plot, the acting is very disney channel in delivery, and there were a few lines children won't get that weren't funny to adults (and I felt a little inappropriate for a childrens movie). That all being said I actually enjoyed the movie. The cheesy lines were actually funny to me. The generic plot actually works for the movie, and the super hero dog is cute. I give it 3.8 stars. It really is a shame they didn't clean up the movie just a little. They could have made this a G film and it would have gotten 4.5 stars from me. As it stands it has some inappropriate innuendo I don't feel is appropriate for a childrens film. They just didn't target the right audience. Parents bring their children to these movies for the children. No need for secret innuendo in a failed attempt to entertain the parents as well.

What is great about it is that it takes itself seriously.  Being a real person version of the famous Underdog cartoon could have been a silly endeavor and been just another B movie but everyone involved is of the highest caliber and truly takes the task upon them seriously.The dog playing Underdog is truly adorable and Jason Lee does an excellent job of being the voice of the infamous dog.  He is very funny while being very endearing.  The dog, through many mishaps I will leave for you to discover, enters the life of retire policeman James Belushi and his teenage son who are dealing with the loss of their wife/mother.  James Beluxshi can sometimes be over the top but here he downplays and is very credible as the troubled excop.The relationship that develops between the boy and the dog - Shoeshine/Underdog is the heart of the film.  The pure fact that the producers managed to make a film about a superhero dog that is funny, endearing and has a lot of heart shows the heart that was put into making it.Hoghly recommend this film for kids of all ages.

Underdog was not the most graceful superhero (blowing up telephone booths, accidentally crashing through walls and destroying buildings left and right),but he was a true hero through and through. His catch theme ""there's no need to fear underdog is here""  very popular back then(Underdog always talkled in rhyme). and he was loved by many(myself included). I also always loved the Underdog theme which included the lyrics""a cry goes out from far and near for Underdog""! So when I first learned that Disney is making a live action version of the show I decided to hold judgement until I saw it. Past movies made from books or tv shows didn't fair to well (A Wrinkle in Time could have done much better if it was truer to the book). But, the preview of the movie looked promising. So I decided to just buy the movie rather than renting. I was not disappointed! The movie was great! It was very true to the original tv series(of coures some changes had to be made), but none-the-less it was a great movie. Fun for all ages 6 to 106! Those who choose to talk down the movie are just to rigid! I should know, I grew-up watching Underdog back in the sixties. True everyone has their own taste, but, I can't imagine anyone who loved Underdog not liking this movie, it's just good clean fun!!!(Maybe that's why some people don't like it, no bad language, no sex, no adult themes and no real violence.)Oh well you can't please everybody.

1108627,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B000WCBULO,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[1, 1]","Underdog has a quite a fascinating history, which can be read in the book ""How Underdog Was Born,"" or heard on an interview with co-creator Buck Biggers (whose daughter appears in one of the DVD special features) on the wonderful Time Travel Radio show.It seems that he and Chet Stover created and produced the original Underdog, Tennessee Tuxedo and other Total Television cartoons as clandestine moonlighting projects when they worked at a major New York ad agency, having meetings in their cars, sending a British front man to present the storyboards and making millions, especially for Underdog, which has become a pop culture icon and a beloved Macy's Thanksgiving Parade balloon. The DVD does include a short documentary segment that acknowledges the original series creators (you have to click on a ""dig deeper"" icon to see it).This 2007 film adaptation might have fallen under the ""what were they thinking?"" category, had it not been for the undeniable success of recent big-screen versions of small screen cartoons and sitcoms. As these sort of films go, this twist on the early 60's limited animation series is passable for a Saturday matinee potboiler in the Disney mold of ""The Monkey's Uncle"" and ""The Ugly Dachshund.""The film strangely tries to take itself too seriously at times but also wants to be a campy comedy and teeters between both with a few too many gags about various gasses and sniffs for some parents' comfort.  I must say, though, that I did enjoy the ""Lady and the Tramp""-like sequence at Tony's Restaurant, meatball and all.But take a look at the cast list and you might be surprised: hey everybody, it's ""Enchanted's"" Princess Giselle - the wondrous Amy Adams - doing the voice of Sweet Polly Purebred! You can even see her at the microphone in the bloopers section For fans of the very grown-up AMC series ""Mad Men"" will spot John Slattery is the mayor. And ""Daily Show"" viewers will smile to see Samantha Bee.I only wish the filmmakers had made more of an effort to reference the series. Perhaps they tried and couldn't make it work; as a creative person in a large organization, I'm no stranger to how a project can succumb to well-intentioned meddling. It can be tricky to keep fans of the original happy while breaking in a new audience.The other challenge this film faced was that the cartoon show is no longer widely played on broadcast TV, so it's not likely that kids were clamoring to see this as much as they would be to see, say, a live action Spongebob feature. When the first Flintstone feature made such a hit in theaters, Cartoon Network was still running the original show.The special features include deleted scenes hosted by director (and former animator) Frederik Du Chau, some bloopers (real ones, not the faux bloopers in the final credits), a rap video with the appealing Kyle Massey, of the Disney Channel comedy ""Cory in the House,"" performing the theme song which also plays over the end credits (it would have been nice to hear the original theme too, which occurred in the first Spiderman film).",3,"Don't expect the flavor of the original, more of a Saturday afternoon matinee action comedy",1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,3055,"['Underdog', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'history', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'book', 'How', 'Underdog', 'Was', 'Born', 'heard', 'interview', 'co-creator', 'Buck', 'Biggers', 'daughter', 'one', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'wonderful', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Radio', 'show.It', 'Chet', 'Stover', 'created', 'produced', 'original', 'Underdog', 'Tennessee', 'Tuxedo', 'other', 'Total', 'Television', 'cartoons', 'clandestine', 'moonlighting', 'projects', 'when', 'worked', 'major', 'New', 'York', 'ad', 'agency', 'having', 'meetings', 'cars', 'sending', 'British', 'front', 'man', 'present', 'storyboards', 'making', 'millions', 'especially', 'Underdog', 'become', 'pop', 'culture', 'icon', 'beloved', 'Macy', 'Thanksgiving', 'Parade', 'balloon', 'DVD', 'include', 'short', 'documentary', 'segment', 'original', 'series', 'creators', 'have', 'click', 'dig', 'deeper', 'icon', 'see', '2007', 'film', 'adaptation', 'might', 'have', 'fallen', 'were', 'thinking', 'category', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'undeniable', 'success', 'recent', 'big-screen', 'versions', 'small', 'screen', 'cartoons', 'sitcoms', 'sort', 'films', 'go', 'twist', 'early', '60', 'limited', 'animation', 'series', 'passable', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'potboiler', 'Disney', 'mold', 'Monkey', 'Uncle', 'Ugly', 'Dachshund', 'film', 'strangely', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'times', 'also', 'be', 'campy', 'comedy', 'teeters', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'gags', 'various', 'gasses', 'sniffs', 'parents', 'comfort', 'must', 'say', 'though', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Lady', 'Tramp', '-like', 'sequence', 'Tony', 'Restaurant', 'meatball', 'all.But', 'take', 'look', 'cast', 'list', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'hey', 'everybody', 'Enchanted', 'Princess', 'Giselle', 'wondrous', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'doing', 'voice', 'Sweet', 'Polly', 'Purebred', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'microphone', 'bloopers', 'section', 'fans', 'very', 'grown-up', 'AMC', 'series', 'Mad', 'Men', 'will', 'spot', 'John', 'Slattery', 'mayor', 'Daily', 'Show', 'viewers', 'will', 'smile', 'see', 'Samantha', 'Bee.I', 'only', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'made', 'more', 'effort', 'reference', 'series', 'Perhaps', 'tried', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'work', 'creative', 'person', 'large', 'organization', ""'m"", 'stranger', 'how', 'project', 'can', 'succumb', 'well-intentioned', 'meddling', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', 'keep', 'fans', 'original', 'happy', 'breaking', 'new', 'audience.The', 'other', 'challenge', 'film', 'faced', 'was', 'cartoon', 'show', 'no', 'longer', 'widely', 'played', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'not', 'likely', 'kids', 'were', 'clamoring', 'see', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'say', 'live', 'action', 'Spongebob', 'feature', 'When', 'first', 'Flintstone', 'feature', 'made', 'hit', 'theaters', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'was', 'still', 'running', 'original', 'show.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'hosted', 'director', 'former', 'animator', 'Frederik', 'Du', 'Chau', 'bloopers', 'real', 'ones', 'not', 'faux', 'bloopers', 'final', 'credits', 'rap', 'video', 'appealing', 'Kyle', 'Massey', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'comedy', 'Cory', 'House', 'performing', 'theme', 'song', 'also', 'end', 'credits', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'original', 'theme', 'too', 'occurred', 'first', 'Spiderman', 'film']",N/A

1108635,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000WCBULO,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 6]","Some movies just don't sound all that appealing from the moment you hear about them. Case in point, Disney's newest film ""Underdog"" based on the classic cartoon series about a crime fighting super dog. The premise is stupid, just as it was on the cartoon, but the cartoon still managed to entertain audiences in its day and it still does with reruns whenever they air. But when I heard that Disney was making a live-action adaptation of the cartoon, I thought this is going to be a really stupid, most likely crappy movie. But then I saw a preview for the movie, and my opinion changed, the preview showed that the movie had decent acting talents Jim Belushi, Peter Dinklage, Patrick Warburton, and Jason Lee; the film also seemed to be full of humor, with a little bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure (a must when adapting a cartoon); and it seemed that the movie actually had good special effects for making a flying, talking, superhero dog believable. So, I went from not caring if I ever saw the movie, to actually looking forward to getting to sit down to watch it.""Underdog"" is the story of an ordinary beagle named Shoeshine (voiced by Jason Lee) who through a series of unforeseen accidents; finds himself in a lab operated by a mad scientist named Dr. Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). When Barsinister tries to experiment on Shoeshine, the dog breaks free causing a devastating accident in the lab, and he is exposed to an experimental chemical that leaves him with super powers such as flight, strength and the ability to talk. After breaking free of the lab, Shoeshine finds himself a new home with a security guard (Jim Belushi) and his son, where he determines that his newfound powers can be used to save the citizens of Capital City from evil as the crime fighter, Underdog. However, when Barsinister, along with his henchman Cad (Patrick Warburton), discovers that this new hero, Underdog, is actually their escaped beagle, they will stop at nothing until the dog is returned to them, leaving the fates of those Shoeshine/Underdog cares for hanging in the balance. Now, all that remains is for us to hear those famous heroic words, ""This looks like a job for Superm...err, umm... oops, wrong movie, here's what I meant, ""There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!"".Well, here's the lesson that I learned from watching Disney's new film, ""Underdog"". Sometimes it's better to go with your initial gut instinct, instead of letting your mind be changed by smart marketing types who know how to properly edit batches of film together to make a fun, entertaining trailer that will get your attention and make you want to see the film, even though your better judgment is telling you that there's no reason at all that you should even be tempted to watch it.The problems I had with ""Underdog"" are not major, but they are big enough gripes to take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. The story isn't anything spectacular by any means; I mean it is supposed to be a kids movie that is adapted from a classic kids cartoon. When a studio sets out to make a kids movie, which is something that Disney does quite often (though to varying degrees of success as of late), then the filmmaker(s) and the writer(s) should feel some obligation to entertain the parents on some level, not the entire time necessarily, but at least a little bit. Especially, when the subject matter is taken from a classic cartoon series that some of these parents most likely watched and loved as kids, therefore I think there should at least be some kind of joke or sight gag or something that adults would get and enjoy as well. Now, I'm not saying there needs to be some kind of raunchy humor, by no means is that what I'm implying, you still keep the family-friendly tone, but there are ways to inject humor aimed more at adults without getting dirty, `Looney Toons' used to do it all the time in their animated shorts, so why can't the current crop of creative types come up with anything?The casting choices for this film were good, for the most part; some of the more talented members of the cast seemed wasted in their roles. Jim Belushi and Patrick Warburton are two very funny actors (in my opinion), but in this film neither funnyman is given much to do. Jim Belushi has had great success with his hit sitcom ""According to Jim"" on ABC, and with various movie projects throughout the years, but in this film it seemed like they didn't want him to be funny, which is fine he's done drama as well, and he's good at it, but his material is just so paper thin that I'm surprised he even signed on to the film. I mean, his character basically exists as a plot device to get the dog, Shoeshine, into a loving home, setting up for the obligatory shenanigans around the home that have been done to death in other movies, except here they can take things a little more extreme due to the whole super powered dog trick. Now, Disney has used Patrick Warburton in at least one of their previous films the hit animated movie ""The Emperor's New Groove"", he was the hilarious not-so evil, evil sidekick Kronk, who essentially stole the show, even got his own sequel ""Kronk's New Groove"". In this film, just like Jim Belushi, Patrick's character seems like a waste of time, he's given a few funny lines to say, but other than that he pretty much just stands around with nothing to do. With two solid comedic actors in such thankless roles, it makes me wonder was the script much funnier before filming or editing took place or were the paychecks just too good to resist? Actor Jason Lee (better known as Earl on TV's ""My Name is Earl"") was decent as the voice of Shoeshine/Underdog, he gave the character a likeable charm and sharp wit, but truth be told, any other actor could have done just as good, it's not like he has crafted a character that people will only remember his voice associated with. Peter Dinklage was good as the evil Dr. Barsinister, he seemed to be enjoying the role and being allowed to ham it up, but after awhile even his character seemed to have less and less to do. The younger actors (the one playing Jim Belushi's son and his would-be girlfriend) were alright, but both seemed inexperienced, and their performances felt stiff because of this.The special effects employed in this film were all very well done. I was surprised that for a kids movie that was adapted from a cartoon that the effects looked much more realistic than cartoonish. The flying scenes in particular were really well done, especially the sequence where Underdog is squaring off against three other super powered dogs working for the evil Barsinister. Basically, the effects are the only real highlight for this film, at least from an adult's perspective; kids will no doubt be entertained throughout the entire duration of the movie.Overall, ""Underdog"" is an average movie, that's aimed solely at kids with little to no humor that ever manages to get above the level of cute. So, you parents out there who may believe that the movie looked good based on the previews (in case your curious this is a case where most of the funny parts are in the previews) and your fond memories of the cartoon series, don't expect too much from the end result. You will most likely wind up just as disappointed as I was, but at least your kids will be happy, so at least you'll have that.""Underdog"" is rated PG for mild violence.",2,"Underdog Is Here, But

Dejected after his most recent failure (hams and bombs smell alike, right?), he sets out alone on the streets.He's quickly picked up by Cad (Patrick Warburton) and taken to the lab of the mad Dr. Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). When the bad doc tries to inject him with something, he starts running around the lab, accidentally knocking over a shelf full of bottles. From these comes his super powers of speech, speed, strength, flying, you name it.Underdog manages to get himself adopted by a recently widowed father (Jim Belushi) with a bitter son (Alex Neuberger). But Dr. Barsinister is continuing his evil scheme. Will he find Underdog? Can a small dog stop the mad scientist?Never having watched the old cartoon show, I can't compare this film to its source material.  I might have missed a few jokes as a result.  But I found this to be only an average film.  The story is predictable, but it was entertaining enough to hold my interest.  There were some great one-liners, but too much bathroom humor for my tastes.  I have a feeling the target audience of kids will enjoy it more then I did.Not surprisingly, the special effects were great.  The acting was fine, but nothing outstanding.  The exception to that was Patrick Warburton and Peter Dinklage.  They play the villains slightly over the top, and the result was perfect.  They were more funny then scary, although a couple scenes in the lab might frighten young children.This is a movie aimed at kids that is best left to them.

1108643,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000WCBULO,Mel Odom,"[0, 0]","When I was a kid, one of my favorite cartoon heroes was Underdog.  He was like Superman, only not as serious and certainly not as skilled.  His city had to have been running out of phone booths, because every time he changed from his secret identity of Shoeshine Boy to Underdog, the phone booth blew up.  Super, yeah.  But not so talented.And he talked in rhyme.  Everything was a couplet.  His questions and answers all rhymed and there was never any explanation as to why he had a quirk like that.  Best of all, the character was voiced by Wally Cox, who had the nerd voice down pat and whose underplayed emotions even at critical times were terrifically funny.The cartoon series started in 1964 and ran for 124 episodes.  It was revived again and again as comic books, and even as a radio show, but never as a movie until Walt Disney films produced it and released it in 2007.My son watched the movie in the theater and thought it was great.  He's ten, older than I was when I first discovered Underdog.  The movie is also live-action (with MAJOR CGI effects) which lends itself to the younger crowd.  And it stars a cute beagle as the main character.  If you're a kid, what's not to love?I sat down with my son and popped the DVD into the player.  Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much, but I can be a ten year old kid with the best of them.  When the remix of the show's theme song came on, I have to admit that I got excited and carried away, and even started singing along (the words that I could remember).The movie gave Underdog a police dog background that I wasn't exactly ecstatic about.  But it had him screwing up and immediately drawing sympathy, so it worked.In fact, the story pulls in the origins of so many things that weren't explained in Underdog's original cartoon run.  Never once did the series tell how Underdog got his powers.  It did mention the Underdog Super Energy Vitamin Pill, which gave Underdog a ""lift,"" and that got edited out to some degree once drug awareness started kicking into the kid's cartoon.  But no one mentioned where the pills came from.  The movie takes care of that, but it doesn't give Underdog the nifty little ring he kept his Underdog pill in.The movie explains where the costume came from as well as the name.  It even tells viewers how Underdog got the name Shoeshine, which my son and I found particularly hilarious.Some of the cartoon purists seem to hate the movie, but I thought it was really well done.  It brought the idea of a super-powered dog into the real world (well, as ""real"" as that could be) and paired him up with a kid (Jack played by Alex Neuberger).  Their dialogue and twist on the normal boy/dog relationship is great.Peter Dinklage stars as Simon Bar Sinister, the diminutive mad scientist that constantly plagued Underdog in the cartoon series.  There are moments when he steals the show and he is awesome.  Patrick Warburton, his hair appropriately styled, stars as Cad, Simon's henchman, and is a riot with his deadpan delivery and his thesaurus that only has the P section left.Although UNDERDOG isn't the most stunning film ever made, it's a great family film.  The pacing moves along so that even the little guys will be kept entertained, and the characterization (and Jason Lee's voice portrayal of Underdog) is well done.  It's a goofy little movie well worth watching, and will probably be watched again by the kids.The special features section is well done, and most of the kid will be interested in the behind-the-scenes feature showing how everything was done.  I know my kid loved the sections where they showed how the dogs were put into wire harnesses to ""fly.""This is one for the kids, and one for the grownups who can remember being kids.
