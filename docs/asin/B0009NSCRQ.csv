He does not have the background per-say but he nevertheless impresses the interviewer Charlene (Jane Curtin) and gets the job. Guided through the library by Judson (Bob Newhart) we find that there is a lot more to the library than one would guess.Flynn barley gets his fee wet when a vital spear (Spear of Destiny) part has been pilfered by a mysterious evil doer. Now he must learn his job OJT with the help of an aloof stoic female (as there ever was such a thing). The mission is to obtain the rest of the spear and not let the evil doer assemble it.In September of 1912 Adolph Hitler at the Hofburg Museum. Hitler later said ""...

The Librarian is by definition a know-it-all, and this aspect of the character is most often worked into the story in a humorous fashion. I found the ""surprise appearance character"" in this movie to be quite interesting, and well played by Kyle McLaughlin.The Librarian series is Indiana Jones Lite, and that's just fine. There is plenty of humor and other elements to interest adults, and action and 'cool factor' for kids to enjoy ... or vice-versa. LOLThe one thing the Librarian might want to work on, though, is hiding his trail. Where ever he's heading, the bad guys always show up just behind him, and occasionally even beat him there!These movies are worthwhile if, for no other reason, to see what may turn out to be some of Bob Newhart's final roles.

Seeing the names of Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin listed among the cast on the back of the DVD case should have been a dead giveaway.

My wife and I watched this when it originally aired and thought perhaps it was a pilot. We thoroughly enjoyed it and were disappointed not to  see a TV series from this movie. I am happy at least the movie has now come out on DVD. This is something like a modern day cross between ""Tomb Raider"" and the new ""Dr. Who"". The Librarian is not quite as physical as Indiana Jones, he uses his wits more to resolve problems, after all he was a professional student. However; there is still plenty of action and his guardian is not only lovely, she can kick the bad guys butts too. Good family entertainment and plenty of replayability. I suggest it as a purchase. I am anxiously awaiting my DVD to watch it again. This just recently came out on DVD. It is not well known movie and I think it may develop a bit of a movie cult status as it is unusual. This did not get alot of press and yet all my friends that I have talked to about it knew about it and thought it was great.

He's 32, lives with his mother, doesn't date, reads voraciously, and has racked up 14 years in college and 22 degrees.  Then, halfway through a project to build an exact one-tenth replica of the Great Pyramid (including the long-missing golden capstone), his professor throws him out of the class with no comprehensible (to Flynn or the viewer) reason except that it's time for him to go out and experience life in the real world.  Less than 24 hours later, he receives a magical-seeming letter (somewhat reminiscent of Harry Potter's acceptance to Hogwarts) that tells him he's been invited to interview for ""a prestigious position at the Metropolitan Public Library.""  When he gets it, he learns to his amazement and delight that the Library is a lot more than just a repository for books: it's the latest incarnation of an institution whose history goes back to Alexandria, and among its treasures are wondrous and magical objects ranging from the Ark of the Covenant and Excalibur (how the sword was recovered from the mere is never explained), through a live unicorn and the Goose That Lays the Golden Eggs, to a functioning jet-pack and H. G. Wells's original Time Machine.  And it has its enemies, including the ruthless Brotherhood of the Serpent, which longs to possess some of those treasures for the sake of the occult power they contain.  On Flynn's first day on the job, he finds that one of them--a piece of the Spear of Destiny, the weapon that pierced Jesus' side on the cross--has been stolen by a Serpent task force.  And it's up to him--geeky, clumsy Flynn--to get it back.  Why?  Because he's ""The Librarian.""  What follows is a chase from the Amazon Basin to the Himalayas and back to New York, infused with elements of Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and Young Sherlock Holmes in about equal measure, and with the Serpents ever breathing down his neck.  Accompanying him as bodyguard is the gorgeous and deadly Nicole Noone, who blames herself for the supposed murder of Flynn's predecessor.  And Flynn, somewhat to his own amazement, proves more than equal to the challenge thanks to his broad store of esoteric knowledge.  (He discovers romance too).Flynn is a charming character, and his improbable adventures are so well done that suspension of disbelief is very easy.  The movie was originally a TNT presentation and therefore, despite several hard-charging martial-arts sequences, no scarier than a Potter or Jones movie and suitable for all but the youngest and most sensitive children.  It may also inspire interest in some of the artifacts the Museum owns, and parents who buy it may find that they've inspired a Flynn of their own.

College has been his safe haven for most of his adult life, picking up new degrees like a magnet and a pile of iron filings, but when he's told by his professor he needs to graduate early and explore life the adventure begins.Soon after he gets an invite to interview as librarian for the Metropolitan Library. But not just as a normal librarian. It's full of treasures from across the world, real and mythical. And the job turns into finding and defending them. He's soon romping across the world trying to find the Spear of Destiny, accompanied by Nicole, the Librarian's bodyguard, Sonya Walger.The fun here is watching the situations and letting yourself go as the Librarian adventures, explores and fights the bad guys in true B movie fashion.

Written by David N. Titcher.First tv-movie in the series. Originally broadcast on TNT cable network.We meet Flynn Carsen (Noah Wyle) who is taking a tour through the Great Pyramid and reading the Third Dynasty hieroglyphics. Well, actually it's a pyramid being built in the University.  He is so excited about the project, but Professor Harris (Mario Ivan Martinez) has no use for him anymore. Flynn has more than enough degrees and it's time the Professor let him go. The Professor tells him he is avoiding life out there. Go get a job instead of taking the same classes over again. He has already talked to the administration. His degree has been signed off. Standing on an upper floor, a man by the name of Judson (Bob Newhart) watches Flynn and observes him.The next day, Flynn receives a magical invitation for an interview at the Metropolitan Public Library. After waiting in a super, long line of a spiral staircase, he is interviewed by a touch cookie, Charlotte (Jane Curtin). After getting through to her with his intellect, he is hired, but on a six-month trial basis.  Judson magically appears and welcomes him. He takes Flynn to a secret passage, a secret elevator and a large secret room that is probably as long as a football field. Real antiquities are housed here. The real Ark of the Covenant, the real Mona Lisa painting, the real Pandora's Box and many more.After the Spear of Destiny is stolen from the library, Flynn is asked on his first day on the job to go on an adventure to find the second missing piece in the Amazon jungle of Mexico. If all three pieces are brought together, it would be dangerous in the wrong hands.Also in the cast: Olympia Dukakis, Lisa Brenner, Sonya Walger, Kyle MacLachlan, Kelly Hu, Clyde Kusatsu, Mark Franco, Antonio Monroi, Leon de Luis.Filmed in Equestrian Statue of Charles IV, Plaza Manuel Tolsa, Churubusco, Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico.The Librarian: Quest For the Spear (2004-tvm).The Librarian  - Return to King Solomon's Mines(2006-tvm).Librarian : The Curse Of The Judas Chalice(2008-tvm).The Librarian tv series will be broadcast on TNT this Autumn 2014, 10 episodes.",4,The first adventure for The Librarian...like Indiana Jones.,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,2269,"['Librarian', 'Quest', 'Spear', '2004-tvm', 'Running', 'Time', 'One', 'Hour', '45', 'mins', 'Extended', 'version.Directed', 'Peter', 'Winther', 'Written', 'David', 'N.', 'Titcher.First', 'tv-movie', 'series', 'Originally', 'broadcast', 'TNT', 'cable', 'network.We', 'meet', 'Flynn', 'Carsen', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'who', 'taking', 'tour', 'Great', 'Pyramid', 'reading', 'Third', 'Dynasty', 'hieroglyphics', 'Well', 'actually', 'pyramid', 'being', 'built', 'University', 'so', 'excited', 'project', 'Professor', 'Harris', 'Mario', 'Ivan', 'Martinez', 'use', 'anymore', 'Flynn', 'more', 'enough', 'degrees', 'time', 'Professor', 'let', 'go', 'Professor', 'avoiding', 'life', 'there', 'Go', 'get', 'job', 'instead', 'taking', 'same', 'classes', 'again', 'already', 'talked', 'administration', 'degree', 'been', 'signed', 'off', 'Standing', 'upper', 'floor', 'man', 'name', 'Judson', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Flynn', 'him.The', 'next', 'day', 'Flynn', 'magical', 'invitation', 'interview', 'Metropolitan', 'Public', 'Library', 'waiting', 'super', 'long', 'line', 'spiral', 'staircase', 'interviewed', 'touch', 'cookie', 'Charlotte', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'getting', 'intellect', 'hired', 'six-month', 'trial', 'basis', 'Judson', 'magically', 'Flynn', 'secret', 'passage', 'secret', 'elevator', 'large', 'secret', 'room', 'probably', 'as', 'long', 'football', 'field', 'Real', 'antiquities', 'are', 'housed', 'here', 'real', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'real', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'painting', 'real', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'many', 'more.After', 'Spear', 'Destiny', 'stolen', 'library', 'Flynn', 'asked', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'go', 'adventure', 'find', 'second', 'missing', 'piece', 'Amazon', 'jungle', 'Mexico', 'three', 'pieces', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'dangerous', 'wrong', 'hands.Also', 'cast', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'Lisa', 'Brenner', 'Sonya', 'Walger', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'Clyde', 'Kusatsu', 'Mark', 'Franco', 'Antonio', 'Monroi', 'Leon', 'de', 'Luis.Filmed', 'Equestrian', 'Statue', 'Charles', 'IV', 'Plaza', 'Manuel', 'Tolsa', 'Churubusco', 'Mexico', 'City', 'Distrito', 'Federal', 'Mexico.The', 'Librarian', 'Quest', 'Spear', '2004-tvm', '.The', 'Librarian', 'Return', 'King', 'Solomon', 'Mines', '2006-tvm', '.Librarian', 'Curse', 'Judas', 'Chalice', '2008-tvm', '.The', 'Librarian', 'tv', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'broadcast', 'TNT', 'Autumn', '2014', '10', 'episodes']",The Librarian - Quest for the Spear

It's a difficult movie to categorize but is has elements from the comedy, romance, action, and fantasy genres. The strong points are the excellent casting and strong acting. The production values are only adequate; one gets the impression that the budget was not overly generous. The screenplay was also just adequate; once the film gets beyond introducing the ""Library"" premise there are not too many surprises left in the film.The film is raised above the mere adequate level by the cast. Noah Wyle exudes charm and is very likable in the title role. Sonya Walger is also outstanding and her scenes with Wyle are a joy to watch. Bob Newhart is at his deadpan best and Jane Curtin is also good. Olympia Dukakis gets as much as she can out of her few scenes.The villain of the piece, played by Kyle MacLachlan, is unfortunately one of the weaknesses of the script. MacLachlan does his best but there just isn't enough depth to the character. Because of this a major plot twist is much less effective than it might have been. His minion, played by Kelly Hu, is just eye candy. Her infatuation with Wyle leads to nothing and seems to have been in the script just to give Hu some lines.Despite all this the chemistry between Wyle and Walger, the support of Newhart, Curtin, and Dukakis, and the interesting Library premise are more than enough to keep the film off the ground.

He then received an invitation to interview at the Metropolitan Library.  Hidden in the depths of the library is the true Library.  Here as stored all the great knowledge and powerful artifact of the ages.  It has been locked away for millennia.  Wylie is offered the position of Librarian and he would be in charge of the collection.  But no sooner does he start than the Library's defenses are pierced and a piece of the Spear of Destiny has been stolen.Wylie must go in the field and retrieve the remaining pieces and rescue the stolen one before its power can be used for evil.  Lots of action and silliness follow as Wylie tries to fulfill his job and his destiny.  Add an excellent supporting cast of Bob Newhart, Jane Curtin and Olympia Dukakis really help keep this show entertaining and fun.But fun or not, this movie bears resemblance to Armageddon, the fun action picture that didn't make a lick of sense.  First we have Wylie have to find the remaining pieces of the spear instead of just rescuing the stolen one.  By finding the others, they just become vulnerable.  One an international flight the cockpit is open to visitors (there is an air marshal so we know the time frame).  A door on the plane is opened at cruising altitude and it doesn't depressurize (in fact passengers are shown to be completely unaware).  Cell phones apparently can work deep in the Amazon where there are no cell towers.  There is a Mayan pyramid a hundred times larger than anything they build and so tall it would have been seen from anywhere in the amazon.  The name of god has been lost for 4,000 years (and not just from the second destruction of the Great Temple in 70 AD).  Since the Spear is true, Christianity is true, but the Spear needs a Pagan ritual to put it back together (not bloody likely).  And more and more and more.  But like Armageddon the details don't matter.  Granted it would have been nice if they got some of them right but they didn't care about that.  If you like fun action films that have good characters and more than a hint of wit, then this one is for you.  If you can't stand plot inaccuracies, then stay away from this one.",3,"Fast, Fun, and Senseless",1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2237,"['Noah', 'Wylie', 'young', 'man', '22', 'degrees', 'being', 'forced', 'real', 'world', 'then', 'received', 'invitation', 'interview', 'Metropolitan', 'Library', 'Hidden', 'depths', 'library', 'true', 'Library', 'Here', 'stored', 'great', 'knowledge', 'powerful', 'artifact', 'ages', 'been', 'locked', 'away', 'millennia', 'Wylie', 'offered', 'position', 'Librarian', 'would', 'be', 'charge', 'collection', 'sooner', 'start', 'Library', 'defenses', 'are', 'pierced', 'piece', 'Spear', 'Destiny', 'been', 'stolen.Wylie', 'must', 'go', 'field', 'retrieve', 'remaining', 'pieces', 'rescue', 'stolen', 'one', 'power', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'evil', 'Lots', 'action', 'silliness', 'follow', 'Wylie', 'fulfill', 'job', 'destiny', 'Add', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'really', 'help', 'keep', 'show', 'entertaining', 'fun.But', 'fun', 'not', 'movie', 'resemblance', 'Armageddon', 'fun', 'action', 'picture', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'lick', 'sense', 'First', 'have', 'Wylie', 'have', 'find', 'remaining', 'pieces', 'spear', 'instead', 'just', 'rescuing', 'stolen', 'one', 'finding', 'others', 'just', 'become', 'vulnerable', 'One', 'international', 'flight', 'cockpit', 'open', 'visitors', 'air', 'marshal', 'know', 'time', 'frame', 'door', 'plane', 'opened', 'cruising', 'altitude', ""n't"", 'depressurize', 'fact', 'passengers', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'completely', 'unaware', 'Cell', 'apparently', 'can', 'work', 'deep', 'Amazon', 'where', 'are', 'cell', 'towers', 'Mayan', 'pyramid', 'hundred', 'times', 'larger', 'anything', 'build', 'so', 'tall', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'amazon', 'name', 'god', 'been', 'lost', '4,000', 'years', 'not', 'just', 'second', 'destruction', 'Great', 'Temple', '70', 'AD', 'Spear', 'true', 'Christianity', 'true', 'Spear', 'Pagan', 'ritual', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'not', 'bloody', 'likely', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'Armageddon', 'details', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Granted', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'got', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'like', 'fun', 'action', 'films', 'have', 'good', 'characters', 'more', 'hint', 'wit', 'then', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'plot', 'inaccuracies', 'then', 'stay', 'away', 'one']",The Librarian - Quest for the Spear

Living with his mother.  Never had a date, girlfriend, etc.  His professor for some ancient Egyptian course he was taking kicked him out of school and told him he should start living life and enjoying it.....so he starts looking for a job.  Then magically he gets a blank card that words appear on and it's a job offer for a library.  Ooooooooohhhhhhh I was on the edge of my seat....He gets there and there is a line for a position....the Librarian.  Why was that so exciting?  Beyond the fact that you get to take care of books?  Just kidding.....he was actually auditioning to be the keeper of some artifacts.

I find it rather doubtful.The Librarian: Quest for the Spear, silly name that it has, stars Noah Wyle (ER) as Indiana Jones, trekking through the Amazon jungle with a gorgeous sidekick (Sonya Walger, from the wasn't-aborted-nearly-soon-enough American version of Coupling). The two of them originally can't stand each other, but eventually get to be quite a partnership. Woo. They're being pursued by some baddies who are after the same thing they are, but are quite content to sit back and let Wyle and Walger do all the work. Why hasn't an action hero yet decided to sit back and let the bad guys do all the work, then pluck the item in question from their hands when they've faced all the dangers?So anyway, does it all sound familiar? It should. You've seen it in a million movies, from Douglas Fairbanks on down. There are some good ancillary roles, especially Bob Newhart as an unassuming caretaker-type, but Noah Wyle is a little too homey even to play the reluctant-action-hero role here; he always looks like he's out of his depth with the character, rather than the character being out of his depth with the situations.Just really all-around badly done. **",2,Just this side of unwatchable.,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,1270,"['Librarian', 'Quest', 'Spear', 'Peter', 'Winther', '2004', 'Did', 'anyone', 'really', 'think', 'find', 'rather', 'doubtful.The', 'Librarian', 'Quest', 'Spear', 'silly', 'name', 'stars', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'ER', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'trekking', 'Amazon', 'jungle', 'gorgeous', 'sidekick', 'Sonya', 'Walger', ""wasn't-aborted-nearly-soon-enough"", 'American', 'version', 'Coupling', 'two', 'originally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other', 'eventually', 'get', 'be', 'quite', 'partnership', 'Woo', ""'re"", 'being', 'pursued', 'baddies', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'thing', 'are', 'are', 'quite', 'content', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'Wyle', 'Walger', 'do', 'work', 'Why', ""n't"", 'action', 'hero', 'yet', 'decided', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', 'work', 'then', 'pluck', 'item', 'question', 'hands', 'when', ""'ve"", 'faced', 'dangers', 'So', 'anyway', 'sound', 'familiar', 'should', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'movies', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'down', 'are', 'good', 'ancillary', 'roles', 'especially', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'unassuming', 'caretaker-type', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'little', 'too', 'homey', 'even', 'play', 'reluctant-action-hero', 'role', 'here', 'always', 'depth', 'character', 'rather', 'character', 'being', 'depth', 'situations.Just', 'really', 'all-around', 'badly', 'done', '**']",The Librarian - Quest for the Spear

908665,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B0009NSCRQ,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[1, 1]","I've watched all three of the Librarian movies, so this will sort of be a conglomerate review of the trilogy.  Flynn Carson is adorable as a thirty-something, professional student whose head stores more facts than Encyclopedia Brittanica or reputable "".org"" sites.  After 16 years of college, he has 22 different degrees (12 bachelor's, 6 master's, and 4 Ph.D's).  According to my math (and no differential equations involved with this computation), he should be 34-years-old in the first installment.  Yet he celebrates his 32nd birthday in the second movie, when logically, he should be celebrating his 35th.  Ahh well, maybe he was dual-enrolled.His mother is forever setting him up with young women, including his own (a few times-removed) cousin in the third movie.  Flynn realizes after a blind-date (arranged, of course, by his fretting mother) with a social worker, that he needs to change in some ways.  So, when a Harry Potteresque invitation to apply for ""The Librarian"" post at the Metropolitan Museum of New York arrives unexpectedly in the mail, Flynn applies for the job.  He is selected because he can apply all his book learning to deduce that Charlene, the interviewer, had a reconstructive nose job in early childhood, currently suffers from swollen glands, and has two cats who left practically invisible traces of fur on her blazer.  He also knows what's important in life, gleaned from a recent pep talk with his mother:  it's the heart that matters more than the mind.The librarian job is a tour-de-force, and Flynn's prolonged studenthood was a serendipitous (or not so-serendipitous) preparation for the job description: saving the world.  These movies could also be called ""The Curator,"" as it seems like a private collections art curator is more apropos; Flynn repeatedly rescues or destroys mythical artifacts that have magical powers.After much adventure and near-death experiences, Flynn successfully retrieves the spear.  However, I thought that one detail was inconsistent. The spear was purposely split into thirds to render it less dangerous.  These three parts were hidden across the globe, one of which was housed at the Museum, where it was stolen.  The splintered pieces of the spear harnessed enough energy from a pyramid alignment that the spear became whole again.  Yet, Flynn is not asked to break the spear apart again once it is returned to the library.  I would have thought that he'd have to arrange for it to be splitered again and then hide the remaining two pieces at other remote geographical locations.Still, a lot of fun.  The character of Judson is mysterious.  The third movie implies he is much more than director of The Library, perhaps a supernatural deity. Flynn tells Judson, ""I know who you are.""

Glasses, no girlfriend, the whole geeky stereotype. But, the number of academic degrees add up close to room temperature, and this quest uses every bit of his encyclopedic knowledge.Noah Wyle (played by Flynn Carson) isn't an Indiana Jones, who becomes a hero by violating the nerdy image. He wins by his wiles, completely embracing his inner geek. And outer one, for that matter. Nicole (Sonya Walger) plays his gorgeous guide/guard, who alternates between pulling his helpless hide out of danger and following him as he deciphers clues from an ancient book.[Spoiler!]The one scene in the movie that might best characterize its spirit comes near the end. It has Bob Newhart going all Chuck Norris on a roomful of heavily armed badguys. Talk about tongue in cheek![End of spoiler]The adventure is chaste and bloodless, mostly, and keeps a humorous tone throughout. And, although he's inept in many ways, the movie never descends to the nerd-bashing that seems so culturally ingrained. In fact, a high point of the flick comes when Nicole starts the beatdown on the female badguy with the challenge ""Find your own geek!""
