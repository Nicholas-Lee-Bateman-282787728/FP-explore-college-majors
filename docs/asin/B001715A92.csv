Interestingly, since this show was mainstream network, it demonstrates vividly that an exciting and intense drama can be developed without the kind of gross overuse of obscenities, extreme violence, blood & gore and graphic sex that the writers of series on paid channels like HBO and Showtime seem to feel they MUST use since they CAN. (For example, Dexter is a great show but if his sister uses the F* word one more time in her ordinary conversation, my shoe is going thru the TV box!) My only quibble involves the occasional weak plot device such as having critical electronics like laptops and communication devices not protected by passwords so a passer-by can uncover earth-shattering secrets with the press of a button. But I guess the writer could always have found another device to disclose the secrets, in order to keep the story moving, so I forgive them!

It's right up there with Firefly, Dollhouse, and FlashForward as far as quality of acting and writing goes. But at least the two seasons we got were wonderful, edge-of-your-seat, white-knuckled ride that stayed in my heart and mind for a while.My only complaint here is that the first few episodes have some pretty silly fallacies (fallout that ""clears"" in 4 days? Ahem). A nuclear apocalypse purist that I am, I rolled my eyes and was tempted to turn it off right then and there. But the show drew me in with great actors, complex characters, and interesting twists and turns. The rest of it proved so good that by the end of the first season all those little imperfections were completely forgiven and forgotten. After that it was ""one more episode... one more episode... one more episode..."" all the way till the end, and sadness once it was over.I think the main thing this show has going for it is extremely likable characters who aren't cookie-cutter, and whom the average Joe can relate to.

1155522,AJWDOCM9BLAQ3,B001715A92,Fernando,"[0, 1]","I saw this DVD set available at library and after quickly checking the amazing ratings here on Amazon I picked it up. Like the other two-star reviews I'm also puzzled by the rabid fandom of this show.The Good: Jericho has a very interesting premise, I can see a producer's eyes light up when coming across a script like this. Much like Stephen King's The Fog, this is about the quiet life in a small town being disrupted by a catastrophe and the uncertainty as they try to figure out what has hit them. There is a large cast of characters and some small twists. There was surely enough promise to make this an EPIC series, unfortunately that's as far as Jericho gets: promise.The Bad: The bad is most of it. The writing is risible and clich&eacute;d. The acting talent is not uniform; it ranges from very good to wooden, no character ever giving you enough for you to care about them, and the director(s) don't know how to tease you into watching the next episode. And this is what dooms Jericho: the awful directing.My little rant: the last 10 years have been the golden age of TV series because production companies are FINALLY getting it, that giving more creative control to the writers and directors make for better shows. They've abandoned the sacred cow idea of the supremacy of the focus group nonsense, since these just recycled their ideas and didn't really reflect what people want to watch. You can't make a stand-out product by following the same recipe over and over, year after year. This is why series like Battlestar Galactica (with its many faults in the latter seasons), Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead, to name a few, have become a TV phenomenon; they dare to be different. This is also why Jericho fails, by trying to present a brave new world while using the same, trite TV-series recipe that makes for dumbed-down and complacent storylines. Whoever was directing this seemed very beholding to the old, uncreative way of doing a TV series.The problem is Jericho tries to present a post-apocalyptic world by insisting in treating day-to-day life with the same banality as the day before the explosion. After a catastrophe of that magnitude SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE (anyone who lived through 9-11 -an incident that Jericho tries to capitalize on- knows life didn't feel quite the same for a long time) but the good folk of Jericho remain downright indolent. The neighboring city of Denver has apparently been wiped out and no one seems really affected by it; people go to bars, not as refuge or escape, but to kick back, only the main characters have a sense of urgency and most folks treat the whole thing with like a traffic jam.The perfect example is on episode 2 - when the alarm is raised of the threat of -what they thought would be- acid rain. The episode is divided between frantically finding shelter for people and scenes where the two escaped convicts dressed as patrolmen are trying to... well, it's never clear what their objective is, so they decide that having a casual breakfast and hinting at nookie is better than escaping the inevitable cloud of doom approaching, again: no sense of urgency. At least the quiet, cute and shy ""weird"" kid in love with the spoiled, rich girl finally gets a chance to spend alone time with her through the storm. But as soon as the rains end her friends, whom you'd expect would be huddling with their families at home, show up at her house with the same levity they'd on a regular Saturday afternoon and judge her for hanging out with him, i.e. ""you're hanging out with that loser? Ewww!"" ... because that seems the most important thing in the world after a nuclear explosion has gone off miles from your town!And the show goes on like this. Episode after episode.You're either doing a disaster series/movie or a banal soap opera, and Jericho, to its failure, insists on being both. It doesn't get that some topics are game-changers: if you do post-apocalyptic you're turning the world upside down (Walking Dead, The Fog) and life on screen would be rough and bleak. If you combine that with the frivolity and insipidness of Melrose Place you end up with this disaster.",2,Disaster Series,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,4140,"['saw', 'DVD', 'set', 'available', 'library', 'quickly', 'checking', 'amazing', 'ratings', 'here', 'Amazon', 'picked', 'up', 'other', 'two-star', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'also', 'puzzled', 'rabid', 'fandom', 'show.The', 'Good', 'Jericho', 'very', 'interesting', 'premise', 'can', 'see', 'producer', 'eyes', 'light', 'up', 'when', 'coming', 'script', 'Much', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Fog', 'quiet', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'being', 'disrupted', 'catastrophe', 'uncertainty', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'hit', 'large', 'cast', 'characters', 'small', 'twists', 'was', 'surely', 'enough', 'promise', 'make', 'EPIC', 'series', 'unfortunately', 'as', 'far', 'Jericho', 'promise.The', 'Bad', 'bad', 'most', 'writing', 'risible', 'clich', 'eacute', 'acting', 'talent', 'not', 'uniform', 'very', 'good', 'wooden', 'character', 'ever', 'giving', 'enough', 'care', 'director', 's', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'tease', 'watching', 'next', 'episode', 'what', 'dooms', 'Jericho', 'awful', 'directing.My', 'little', 'rant', 'last', '10', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'golden', 'age', 'TV', 'series', 'production', 'companies', 'are', 'FINALLY', 'getting', 'giving', 'more', 'creative', 'control', 'writers', 'directors', 'make', 'better', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'abandoned', 'sacred', 'cow', 'idea', 'supremacy', 'focus', 'group', 'nonsense', 'just', 'recycled', 'ideas', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'reflect', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'stand-out', 'product', 'following', 'same', 'recipe', 'year', 'year', 'why', 'series', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'many', 'faults', 'latter', 'seasons', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'name', 'few', 'have', 'become', 'TV', 'phenomenon', 'dare', 'be', 'different', 'also', 'why', 'Jericho', 'trying', 'present', 'brave', 'new', 'world', 'using', 'same', 'trite', 'TV-series', 'recipe', 'dumbed-down', 'complacent', 'storylines', 'Whoever', 'was', 'directing', 'seemed', 'very', 'beholding', 'old', 'uncreative', 'way', 'doing', 'TV', 'series.The', 'problem', 'Jericho', 'tries', 'present', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'insisting', 'treating', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'same', 'banality', 'day', 'explosion', 'catastrophe', 'magnitude', 'SOMETHING', 'HAS', 'TO', 'CHANGE', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', '9-11', '-an', 'incident', 'Jericho', 'capitalize', 'on-', 'knows', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'quite', 'same', 'long', 'time', 'good', 'folk', 'Jericho', 'remain', 'downright', 'indolent', 'neighboring', 'city', 'Denver', 'apparently', 'been', 'wiped', 'out', 'one', 'really', 'affected', 'people', 'go', 'bars', 'not', 'refuge', 'escape', 'kick', 'back', 'only', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'sense', 'urgency', 'most', 'folks', 'treat', 'whole', 'thing', 'traffic', 'jam.The', 'perfect', 'example', 'episode', '2', 'when', 'alarm', 'raised', 'threat', '-what', 'thought', 'would', 'be-', 'acid', 'rain', 'episode', 'divided', 'frantically', 'finding', 'shelter', 'people', 'scenes', 'where', 'two', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'dressed', 'patrolmen', 'are', 'trying', 'well', 'never', 'clear', 'what', 'objective', 'decide', 'having', 'casual', 'breakfast', 'hinting', 'nookie', 'better', 'escaping', 'inevitable', 'cloud', 'doom', 'approaching', 'again', 'sense', 'urgency', 'least', 'quiet', 'cute', 'shy', 'weird', 'kid', 'love', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'girl', 'finally', 'chance', 'spend', 'alone', 'time', 'storm', 'as', 'soon', 'rains', 'end', 'friends', 'whom', ""'d"", 'expect', 'would', 'be', 'huddling', 'families', 'home', 'show', 'up', 'house', 'same', 'levity', ""'d"", 'regular', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'judge', 'hanging', 'out', 'i.e', ""'re"", 'hanging', 'out', 'loser', 'Ewww', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'world', 'nuclear', 'explosion', 'gone', 'off', 'miles', 'town', 'show', 'Episode', 'episode.You', ""'re"", 'doing', 'disaster', 'series/movie', 'banal', 'soap', 'opera', 'Jericho', 'failure', 'being', ""n't"", 'get', 'topics', 'are', 'game-changers', 'do', 'post-apocalyptic', ""'re"", 'turning', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Fog', 'life', 'screen', 'would', 'be', 'rough', 'bleak', 'combine', 'frivolity', 'insipidness', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'end', 'up', 'disaster']",Jericho - The Complete Series

Slevin,"[217, 224]","With season two just being completed and put out for sale this compilation would be the solution if you have yet to purchase season one.  Jericho, in my estimation, was one of the best dramas on TV.  Nicely, it is a change of pace from the great investigation, police or courtroom dramas that are so very good and popular.The neat thing about Jericho as a series it is a continuation of a story flow, you get hooked from the moment the bomb goes off.  There are scenes in the first episode reminscent of ""The Day After"" and other nuclear war type movies of the 80s.  However, the people seem real and you get into the characters right away.There are families, three and four generations of hometown Americans.  This movie shows values in relationships and core values of a people trying to survive and overcome hardships in a small town.  For those not in the know, Jericho was supposed to end with Season One.  There was a firestorm after the last episode where a reference to the battle of the buldge is mentioned and the term Nuts is used.  Well, the heroes of season two include the thousands of viewers who sent tons and tons of packaged peanuts to CBS demanding that Jericho stay on for one more year.  CBS relented and ran seven episodes.  That is season two.However the seven episodes took on a big screen dimension.  Interestingly, many of the episodes in Jericho had a big screen feel to it.  The last episodes of season one and virtually all of season two gave you the big screen feel.  Sadly, with so much more of a focus on getting the meat of the story in season two, you miss many characters and possible themes.  You have to watch season one.  There is the character who is the town bad boy with a very large group of men as his possee.  What could they have done with them in season two?Well, I guess the only thing left is a possible movie.  Too bad that Jericho was placed against Idol the first year and put on at 10 PM the next.  Really was a welcome relief to reality TV and will be missed.  Jericho will most likely have a 'cult' following for years to come and when people get around to watching it, they will wonder why they missed in in the first place.",5,This is the way to go if you have not acquired Jericho Seasons one and two yet,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,2179,"['season', 'two', 'just', 'being', 'completed', 'put', 'out', 'sale', 'compilation', 'would', 'be', 'solution', 'have', 'yet', 'purchase', 'season', 'one', 'Jericho', 'estimation', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'dramas', 'TV', 'Nicely', 'change', 'pace', 'great', 'investigation', 'police', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'good', 'popular.The', 'neat', 'thing', 'about', 'Jericho', 'series', 'continuation', 'story', 'flow', 'get', 'hooked', 'moment', 'bomb', 'off', 'are', 'scenes', 'first', 'episode', 'reminscent', 'Day', 'other', 'nuclear', 'war', 'type', 'movies', '80s', 'However', 'people', 'seem', 'real', 'get', 'characters', 'right', 'away.There', 'are', 'families', 'three', 'four', 'generations', 'hometown', 'Americans', 'movie', 'values', 'relationships', 'core', 'values', 'people', 'trying', 'survive', 'overcome', 'hardships', 'small', 'town', 'not', 'know', 'Jericho', 'was', 'supposed', 'end', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'firestorm', 'last', 'episode', 'where', 'reference', 'battle', 'buldge', 'mentioned', 'term', 'Nuts', 'used', 'Well', 'heroes', 'season', 'two', 'include', 'thousands', 'viewers', 'who', 'sent', 'tons', 'tons', 'packaged', 'peanuts', 'CBS', 'demanding', 'Jericho', 'stay', 'one', 'more', 'year', 'CBS', 'relented', 'ran', 'seven', 'episodes', 'season', 'seven', 'episodes', 'took', 'big', 'screen', 'dimension', 'Interestingly', 'many', 'episodes', 'Jericho', 'had', 'big', 'screen', 'feel', 'last', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'virtually', 'season', 'two', 'gave', 'big', 'screen', 'feel', 'Sadly', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'focus', 'getting', 'meat', 'story', 'season', 'two', 'miss', 'many', 'characters', 'possible', 'themes', 'have', 'watch', 'season', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'town', 'bad', 'boy', 'very', 'large', 'group', 'men', 'possee', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'season', 'two', 'Well', 'guess', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'possible', 'movie', 'Too', 'bad', 'Jericho', 'was', 'placed', 'Idol', 'first', 'year', 'put', '10', 'PM', 'next', 'Really', 'was', 'welcome', 'relief', 'reality', 'TV', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'Jericho', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'have', ""'cult"", 'following', 'years', 'come', 'when', 'people', 'get', 'watching', 'will', 'wonder', 'why', 'missed', 'first', 'place']",Jericho - The Complete Series

The isolated location of this town, allowed it to survive a national catastrophe, the destruction of 23 major U.S. cities by terrorist planted nuclear bombs. The series mixes the post apocalyptic story of the town's adaptation to end of the world with the discovery of the secrets of the true perpetrators of the attack. There are lots of plot twists and turns and action sequences. The scathing caricatures of government contractors run amok, and of corporate and political corruption at high levels still seem relevant. Maybe more so today than when the series aired. It's well written and the actors did a good job with their roles. Their characters lives and interactions are more complex than first appear. The fans demanded the short second season and the team put out a great effort, packing a lot of big screen action and drama into the small screen episodic format.

I don't own the DVD's but discovered that the show suddenly appeared on Netflix.  I eagerly sat through every episode within a 3 day period, devouring the show as I felt I would when I had seen the promos.I love post-apocalyptic horror/drama, and boy did this fit the bill.  I was a bit leery as I'm not a big fan of Skeet Ulrich, but in this show he really grew on me.  I was unfamiliar with many of the actors, which actually made the show better.  It reminded me of ""Alas Babylon"" revisited.  Sudden nuclear holocaust takes out most of the US leaving few small towns left standing.  This series follows the trials and tribulations of the small town of Jericho as they attempt to rebuild their town, defend it from vicious attackers, feed it's citizens, get the power on, and figure out just what happened in the world. If you watch it, you will find yourself watching show after show into the wee hours of the morning.Though some of the characters are a little week, I did enjoy the majority of them.  I didn't find too many cringe worthy lines or utterly absurd moments (I don't watch much TV because of it).  What I was happy to see was a very plausible reaction of a small town to a major catastrophe.  The trials they faced felt all too real, and their individual reactions (many of which were things I would never do) did remind me of how many people would react in that situation.Was this the perfect show?  No, first of all it was only a season and a half.  Although the final episode does give an ending, I was left wanting so much more.  Second the acting in parts was very TV movie, but most of the leads did fantastic jobs, with one scene in the second season almost bringing me to tears.

The small town of Jericho -- 5000 souls, is not touched directly by the nuclear attack.  The national power and information grid is gone, and the industrial and agricultural back of the nation is broken.One of the strongest aspects of ""Jericho"" are the superb characterizations. The cast in this series is excellent, and does a fabulous job of transporting the viewer into a scenario that is all too believable and even plausible.  People in this series act like real people, not Hollywood cut-outs.  Season One ends with a weird scenario in which certain Western States combine into the ""Allied States of America"" with a creepy new flag and a plan to shred the Constitution -- beginning with the Second Amendment's promise of the right to keep and bear arms.  Nothing blew my mind half as much as the close-up of this new flag, which promised ""a new direction"" for the Nation.Hollywood could not resist a few stupid and pointless jabs at the right-wing of this country, but I refused to allow this obnoxious Hollywood trait to interfere with my enjoyment of this superb series.  No spoilers here, but if you watch the series you will see that to which I refer.It is highly regrettable that this series did not make it into Season Three.

Jericho is not about some fictional ""what if"" scenario; it is about what has already happened in our country. The storyline's ""September attacks"" make it plain that we are talking about 9/11 and terror that was directed not from outside the country, as the propaganda machine spewed, but from inside at the highest level of government, for the purposes of subverting the Constitution and implementing policies that would otherwise never be accepted. In this story, we have the evil, bald mastermind from Wyoming (think: Dick Cheney) commanding an untouchable private army, ""Ravenwood"" (think: Blackwater).

That's right, America, I actually do not watch TV. Oh, I have a great, big, 42"" LCD HDTV, but I choose to only use that for watching DVDs because, quite frankly, commercial TV sucks. Having said that, I do have a membership to NetFlix, so I have previewed a few TV shows there because they are commercial free. My most recent discovery is ""Jericho"".I originally played the first episode because I am a fan of Skeet Ulrich (Jake Green). Many have referred to Skeet as a poor man's Johnny Depp, but I think Skeet is just a little more relaxed with his performances since he doesn't have so much pressure to be the big Hollywood star. Add Gerald McRaney as Skeet's father (Johnston Green) and mayor of the town and top it with the tough as nails mom who just can't wait to bake you a homemade pie, Pamela Reed (Gail Green), and you have an instant winner.I can't say enough about this show. I love the fact that Jericho is a speck of a town in the middle of Kansas that chooses not to fall apart during the worst disaster in the history of the United States. The people of Jericho simply ""get it"". Towns surrounding them have fallen into anarchy while Jericho celebrates Thanksgiving, manages to keep their grocery store in business, and still feels it is important to go out and vote. This isn't just an apocalyptic tale of death and chaos, it's a family story from the word go.  Ulrich's Jake Green has just returned to town from a self-imposed exile when the whole world gets turned upside down. Throughout the first few episodes we see the uncomfortable silences between Jake and his father. We also watch as the friendship between Jake and his brother, Eric (Kenneth Mitchell), slowly rebuilds. Of course, what end of the world tale would be complete without the ""boy sees girl he has always loved but now she is engaged to someone else"" arc?Buy this boxed set if you want to sit down and have a literal marathon of excellent TV. I know CBS cancelled the show mid-second season, but let me tell you, the suits at the Eye are idiots and should all be fired. This is TV worth watching. There are film makers out there who should watch this little show and take notes. The soundtrack alone is worth the purchase. My favorite musical finds are Coldplay's ""Til Kingdom Come"" and Damien Rice's ""9 Crimes"" which played during the perfectly choreographed final scene of season two, episode four, ""Oversight"".Of course, this is just my humble opinion, but I think CBS might actually take me seriously once they see the film I'm working on.

I had heard the hype, which generally causes my fanboy-repulsion-reflex to kick in (although Battlestar and Firefly are two of my favorites, so maybe I'm not immune).So we Netflixed it recently, and by about episode 2, we were hooked.  The acting, the story, the action sequences, and even the effects are all top notch, by any standards.  By the end of Season 1, I was very skeptical that they could wrap this whole complex and layered plot up.But they did.  In 7 short episodes of Season 2, things speed up and take on a more epic, desperate tone, and ultimately end up resolving themselves, more or less.  So don't be afraid of Jericho, thinking you are getting involved in yet another doomed TV show that was too good for the general population and badly marketed by the network.  There IS closure  on this one, and in my opinion, when the final credits roll, you will agree this is one of the most original and well executed action/dramas that has been on TV.And it took the 2nd season to make it so.

From the problems that came with needs to the things that people held onto because they hoped beyond hope that things like family and cities and nationalism could survive, Jericho quickly grew. It brought up a lot of things that series like to leave out, like what happens when a community wants a piece of your land so they can feed themselves or if one person has the right to hold a town almost at gunpoint because they own a store that happened upon some food along the way. Combine that with one of the most intriguing characters you'll ever see hiding in the background (he was one of those people you wanted to figure out, wanted to believe, but really didn't ever know for cerrtain), with flashes of brillance in the form of skirmishes that turned into mortar rounds and that turned into warfare, and with streaks racing through the sky and little glimpses of the world in a few frames and you have something that existed wonderfully - if briefly - on a channel that didn't love it enough.In Jericho, I found a great thing because this was more than a normal series. It didn't place faith in filler and it didn't really place trust in things happening matter-of-factly. The acting got better as the series went on, the characters got more interesting as you got to know them, and Jericho got more pressing as their wants and needs began to get bigger. The way they thought was beautiful, too, from the reasons you needed to take the logos off of vehicles to the pressing notion of love, loss, and alcohol on a town that didn't value most of these things enough before - whatever it is - begins developing. You don't know what it is developing either, and that;'s a great thing. honestly, I liked that most of all.If you need the whole series in one sweep, this is a good way to do it. If not, perhaps you should look into other avenues but you'll still want to finish it out. After watching some of it you'll see why the fan following was so dedictated to their show, too, and why cancellation was fought off for a time by peanuts for thousands upon thousands of fans simply because they liked what they saw.The sea of channels seems littered with the static of beautiful sdhows - that is one thing I have begun noticing more and more as time presses on.
