1129613,AP9X72S75PLAP,B00114UUA4,a customer,"[23, 27]","Starring Leah Pipes, Kristin Cavallari, Josh Henderson, Andrew Lawrence, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Geoffrey Lewis.  I saw the preview for this movie and thought it looked promising--like a decent low-budget ghost story. It starts off interesting enough...a high school girl (Pipes) comes out of rehab and moves to the town of Emerald. Her sister (Cavallari) tells her the train tracks are haunted because a bus full of school children were hit by a train years earlier. She attempts to adjust to her new life and she catches the attention of two of her male classmates (Henderson and Lawrence). Life becomes even more complicated when she starts seeing a girl who had died in the bus crash and so she now must find out what actually happened to the children who died in the crash.The first half builds like it will be a spooky ghost-story. The second half of the movie is were it falls apart, because all of a sudden it becomes a typical teenage slasher movie--a badly done Nightmare on Elm Street rip-off. The deaths are ridiculous and unoriginal and seem to come out of nowhere. The movie has a very made-for-t.v feel, except for the strong language. The lead actress is quite good and I always love to see Lou Diamond Philips and Geoffrey Lewis;  however, some of the other actors inexperience (especially the mother) showed through too much.Overall, if you know the tale or just want to watch it out of curiosity--rent it first. It's a two-in-a-half star movie, I just bumped it up because of the actors.",3,"Rent, don't buy--Possible minor spoilers",1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,1508,"['Starring', 'Leah', 'Pipes', 'Kristin', 'Cavallari', 'Josh', 'Henderson', 'Andrew', 'Lawrence', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'Geoffrey', 'Lewis', 'saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'thought', 'looked', 'promising', 'decent', 'low-budget', 'ghost', 'story', 'interesting', 'enough', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'Pipes', 'rehab', 'moves', 'town', 'Emerald', 'sister', 'Cavallari', 'train', 'tracks', 'are', 'haunted', 'bus', 'full', 'school', 'children', 'were', 'hit', 'train', 'years', 'earlier', 'adjust', 'new', 'life', 'attention', 'two', 'male', 'classmates', 'Henderson', 'Lawrence', 'Life', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'seeing', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'died', 'bus', 'crash', 'now', 'must', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'children', 'who', 'died', 'crash.The', 'first', 'half', 'builds', 'will', 'be', 'spooky', 'ghost-story', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'were', 'apart', 'sudden', 'typical', 'teenage', 'slasher', 'movie', 'badly', 'done', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'rip-off', 'deaths', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'unoriginal', 'seem', 'come', 'nowhere', 'movie', 'very', 'made-for-t.v', 'feel', 'strong', 'language', 'lead', 'actress', 'quite', 'good', 'always', 'love', 'see', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Philips', 'Geoffrey', 'Lewis', 'however', 'other', 'actors', 'inexperience', 'especially', 'mother', 'showed', 'too', 'much.Overall', 'know', 'tale', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'curiosity', 'rent', 'first', 'two-in-a-half', 'star', 'movie', 'just', 'bumped', 'up', 'actors']",Fingerprints

I wasn't sure how good it would be because usually the better the cover looks the worse the movie actually is. This movie was actually pretty good and great for a low budget film. It did give me goose bumps a few times and had me guessing. I liked that this wasn't just a scary movie and it actually had a murder mystery to it. There was very little nudity (and when I say very little I mean one part and is like a 5 to 6 second breast shot) which I also liked because for some reason most low budget films always have a lot of nudity in it because they think it will be better or because it will get more people to watch it. There were parts when certain characters died that I was kind of like ""they could have done that better,"" but it wasn't the way the character was killed, it was the way the character acted. There were only a couple unbelievable parts that you could tell the character lacked in acting skills, but it wasn't horrible enough for me to stop watching it. The ending was pretty good too. The only thing I didn't like about the ending was that they should have just ended it before they showed the two new characters making fun of the ghost story at the train tracks. It almost ruined the good note the ending left off on.

1129652,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00114UUA4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 6]","Fingerprints (Harry Basil, 2006)You've heard of the After Dark Horrorfest, right? Eight movies supposedly ""too scary to be released in theaters"" every year that are actually one step above (or, in some painful cases, one step below) Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies? Well, every once in a while I run across a movie that would have been absolutely perfect for After Dark that they somehow missed, probably because it's too well-made to actually bear the title-- it would make all the really mediocre movies look even more mediocre than they actually are. Fingerprints struck me this way; it's not all that good a movie, being both entirely unscary and entirely predictable, and thus it's perfect After Dark fodder, but it's well-made and well-acted enough that it would stand out in a typical After Dark lineup like a glowing beacon of sanity.Melanie (Pixel Perfect's Leah Pipes, all grown up) gets out of rehab and heads back home-- except ""home"" is now somewhere different, as her family moved to a new town while she was locked up. Her bubbly sister Crystal (Kristin Cavallari of the upcoming Green Flash in her first big-screen appearance) tries to help Melanie fit into the new digs as much as possible, but word got out, and the kids in her new high school already think of her as a freak. It doesn't help that it seems she sees ghosts. The town's local urban legend involves leaving one's car in neutral on a set of railroad tracks, which will encourage the ghosts of a number of children who died in a horrible bus/train collision in the fifties to push your car off the tracks, leaving fingerprints on your bumper if you've coated it in baby powder (thus the movie's name). Everyone knows it's just an urban legend (in the movie, anyway-- I've seen at least two claims that this is based on a true story, both of them, of course, in different towns), but Melanie befriends a shy youngster named Julie, who, it turns out, is not at all what she appears to be. Worse yet, kids are disappearing. Can Julie-- and, through her, Melanie-- figure out what's going on before she becomes the target?Yeah, it's a pretty standard mystery with supernatural elements, but nothing here feels clich&eacute;d, the way that such things often do. Pipes is a decent actress, and the Cleveland Brothers' (Souls' Midnight) script gives her a good, meaty part to sink her teeth into. There's also a strong supporting cast, including Lou Diamond Phillips in his best role (as a hapless guidance counselor) in close to a decade, and Geoffrey Lewis, one of those character actors who always seems to show up at just the right time (he also showed up in one of the better After Dark releases, Wicked Little Things, the same year this was released).A very enjoyable film all around, and one that you probably missed, given that theatrically it showed on just two screens (horror film festivals in New York and LA). It found its way to DVD earlier this year; hunt it down and give it a chance.

There was a tragedy in the small town the movie takes place in when, decades ago, a train slammed into a school bus that was stalled on the tracks, killing everyone onboard; in the modern day, there's a legend that if you park a car on those tracks, it will be pushed off the tracks and to safety by an invisible prescence - only fingerprints on the bumper or car's back remain, indicating it was the ghosts of the crash victims, trying to prevent any other accident from occuring on that spot.  But what's always apparantly been just an urban legend starts to come true...The catalyst for the change comes when a girl named Melanie (well played by Leah Pipes) returns home after a stay in an out-of-town hospital.  When Melanie and her friends try out the local legend, the car actually does move off the tracks.  And shortly thereafter more supernatural occurences start happening.  Melanie was in the hospital after an incident that left her legally dead for two minutes; it seems that her brush with death has resulted in her being able to interact with spirits more closely, and once near those haunted tracks...  However, things may not be what they seem.  It turns out that there are rumors that the crash all those years ago never happened at all, although how or why someone would fake something like that is unknown.  In addition to the spirit appearances, new deaths start to occur as an unknown assailant begins slashing through various people connected in one way or another with the tracks and/or the legend.""Fingerpints"" blends its 'haunting' story with 'stalk-and-slash' elements very well, coming out with a distinctive movie based on a fresh storyline.  And it does tie the different plot threads together in the end, leaving off with a powerful finale plus an opening for a possible follow-up (which I personally would be in favor of, although it might be tricky to reopen one of the plot threads that seems pretty much resolved).  In addition to Pipes's performance, the rest of the cast does a good job too, with Lou Diamond Phillips deserving special mention for his role as a teacher/guidance counsellor at the local high school.Aside from a couple of film festival appearances, this one went direct to DVD.  Direct-to-DVD titles have an unjustly bad rep; personally I've always thought there were quite a few gems in among the weaker entries, but over the last little while the ratio of quality direct-DVD titles has been picking up.  With the number of theatrically released horror movies in a bit of a dry spell, it's good to know that the original DVD releases are picking up the slack.",4,An Original Horror Movie Centering On The Ghosts Of An Old Train Crash,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,2731,"['title', 'Fingerprints', 'refers', 'marks', 'left', 'ghosts', 'dead', 'children', 'when', 'make', 'appearance', 'was', 'tragedy', 'small', 'town', 'movie', 'place', 'when', 'decades', 'ago', 'train', 'slammed', 'school', 'bus', 'was', 'stalled', 'tracks', 'killing', 'everyone', 'onboard', 'modern', 'day', 'legend', 'park', 'car', 'tracks', 'will', 'be', 'pushed', 'off', 'tracks', 'safety', 'invisible', 'prescence', 'only', 'bumper', 'car', 'back', 'remain', 'indicating', 'was', 'ghosts', 'crash', 'victims', 'trying', 'prevent', 'other', 'accident', 'occuring', 'spot', 'what', 'always', 'apparantly', 'been', 'just', 'urban', 'legend', 'come', 'true', 'catalyst', 'change', 'when', 'girl', 'named', 'Melanie', 'well', 'played', 'Leah', 'Pipes', 'home', 'stay', 'out-of-town', 'hospital', 'When', 'Melanie', 'friends', 'try', 'out', 'local', 'legend', 'car', 'actually', 'move', 'tracks', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'more', 'supernatural', 'occurences', 'start', 'happening', 'Melanie', 'was', 'hospital', 'incident', 'left', 'legally', 'dead', 'two', 'minutes', 'brush', 'death', 'resulted', 'being', 'able', 'interact', 'spirits', 'more', 'closely', 'once', 'haunted', 'tracks', 'However', 'things', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'seem', 'out', 'are', 'rumors', 'crash', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'happened', 'how', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'fake', 'something', 'unknown', 'addition', 'spirit', 'appearances', 'new', 'deaths', 'start', 'occur', 'unknown', 'assailant', 'slashing', 'various', 'people', 'connected', 'one', 'way', 'tracks', 'and/or', 'legend', 'Fingerpints', ""'haunting"", 'story', ""'stalk-and-slash"", 'elements', 'very', 'well', 'coming', 'out', 'distinctive', 'movie', 'based', 'fresh', 'storyline', 'tie', 'different', 'plot', 'threads', 'together', 'end', 'leaving', 'off', 'powerful', 'finale', 'opening', 'possible', 'follow-up', 'personally', 'would', 'be', 'favor', 'might', 'be', 'tricky', 'reopen', 'one', 'plot', 'threads', 'pretty', 'much', 'resolved', 'addition', 'Pipes', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'too', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'deserving', 'special', 'mention', 'role', 'teacher/guidance', 'counsellor', 'local', 'high', 'school.Aside', 'couple', 'film', 'festival', 'appearances', 'one', 'went', 'direct', 'DVD', 'Direct-to-DVD', 'titles', 'have', 'unjustly', 'bad', 'rep', 'personally', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'gems', 'weaker', 'entries', 'last', 'little', 'ratio', 'quality', 'direct-DVD', 'titles', 'been', 'picking', 'up', 'number', 'theatrically', 'released', 'horror', 'movies', 'bit', 'dry', 'spell', 'good', 'know', 'original', 'DVD', 'releases', 'are', 'picking', 'up', 'slack']",Fingerprints

Melanie and her family move from the big city to a small town after a recent tragedy. Once there, Melanie becomes obsessed with a local urban legend and decides to discover the truth behind it with the helps of some ghost children. Leah Pipes gives an absolutely amazing performance as Melanie. I hate it when such a great performance goes to waste because it's in some limit release horror film. I'd never even heard of her before this film, but she was so engaging and really got me into this film. Her sister in the movie is played by Kristin Cavallari, who is possibly the best looking girl I've ever seen. She didn't have as big a role in the movie, but she was so supportive and sweet when everyone thought her sister was crazy. Fingerprints seems like a cheesy b-horror movie, with it's poor cinematography and inexperienced supporting cast, but in reality, it's a fantasy story intermingled with a completely unnecessary secondary plot.

1129659,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00114UUA4,trebe,"[1, 2]","Based on an urban legend about ghosts pushing cars on railroad tracks, Fingerprints (2006) is a tale of suspense featuring a teenage girl playing detective.  The story seems padded with clich&eacute;d plot elements, to flesh out what is a rather barebones premise.  It all somehow plays like a bad episode of Scooby Doo, with some problematic acting performances.According to legend, in the town of Emerald, Texas, a school bus loaded with kids was hit by a train at the railroad crossing.  After this tragedy, supposedly if you park on the tracks and put the car in neutral, the ghosts of dead children will push the car to safety, sometimes leaving fingerprints on the vehicle.  After being in rehab, teenager Melanie Wood (Leah Pipes) rejoins her family, who have recently moved to Emerald.  Mel is well received by her older sister Crystal (Kristin Cavallari) and her father (Darryl Cox), but her mother (Ginger Gilmartin) appears to have some trust issues.The story briefly touches on Melanie's time in school, where she gets some counseling from Doug Perrywine (Lou Diamond Phillips), but Mel's fascination with the ghostly legend, becomes the basis of the film, as she repeatedly finds herself in a car parked on the railroad crossing, or hanging around the old abandoned train station, sometimes with her new friend Penn (Josh Henderson).  When Mel surprisingly experiences the phenomena of having her car pushed off the tracks, she also has an encounter with a little girl named Julie (Sydnee Harlan), that leads her to Mary Pearl (Sally Kirkland), the daughter of the conductor of the train that struck the school bus.  After Mel has a supernatural experience involving Julie, she becomes convinced that the little girl is asking for help, and during her investigation, discovers that Mary Pearl had a sister named Julie, who was killed in the bus accident.The level of action ramps up in the third act, and while the excitement is certainly welcome, the writing doesn't do a credible job of connecting together the various action sequences.  In stretching out a small story into a full length feature, the writers must believe that they can get away with anything, as the big reveal about the bus accident, long hidden crimes, and a secret dungeon, are pretty laughable.  The motivation for all the mayhem involving the construction of a new roadway, is like something right out of Scooby Doo.Seventeen year old Leah Pipes seems mature for her age, and does a satisfactory job in the lead role, while an animated Sally Kirkland does her best to make things fun.  The writing isn't as kind to some of the other characters, who come off as rather cartoonish.  The practical effects are mostly good, with a couple of gory kills.  Some of the other effects, like speeded up footage of a moving train, and some fast cut editing, aren't very convincing.  Apparently intended for an audience that isn't very critical, Fingerprints throws a lot of things into the mix, trying to keep things interesting, but ultimately delivers almost as many laughs as thrills, earning a rating of 2.5 stars.",2,"decades apart, a new roadway leads to murder...",1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,3095,"['Based', 'urban', 'legend', 'ghosts', 'pushing', 'cars', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'Fingerprints', '2006', 'tale', 'suspense', 'featuring', 'teenage', 'girl', 'playing', 'detective', 'story', 'padded', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'elements', 'flesh', 'out', 'what', 'rather', 'barebones', 'premise', 'somehow', 'plays', 'bad', 'episode', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'problematic', 'acting', 'performances.According', 'legend', 'town', 'Emerald', 'Texas', 'school', 'bus', 'loaded', 'kids', 'was', 'hit', 'train', 'railroad', 'crossing', 'tragedy', 'supposedly', 'park', 'tracks', 'put', 'car', 'neutral', 'ghosts', 'dead', 'children', 'will', 'push', 'car', 'safety', 'sometimes', 'leaving', 'fingerprints', 'vehicle', 'being', 'rehab', 'teenager', 'Melanie', 'Wood', 'Leah', 'Pipes', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'recently', 'moved', 'Emerald', 'Mel', 'well', 'received', 'older', 'sister', 'Crystal', 'Kristin', 'Cavallari', 'father', 'Darryl', 'Cox', 'mother', 'Ginger', 'Gilmartin', 'have', 'trust', 'issues.The', 'story', 'briefly', 'touches', 'Melanie', 'time', 'school', 'where', 'counseling', 'Doug', 'Perrywine', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'Mel', 'fascination', 'ghostly', 'legend', 'basis', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'car', 'parked', 'railroad', 'crossing', 'hanging', 'old', 'abandoned', 'train', 'station', 'sometimes', 'new', 'friend', 'Penn', 'Josh', 'Henderson', 'When', 'Mel', 'surprisingly', 'phenomena', 'having', 'car', 'pushed', 'off', 'tracks', 'also', 'encounter', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Julie', 'Sydnee', 'Harlan', 'Mary', 'Pearl', 'Sally', 'Kirkland', 'daughter', 'conductor', 'train', 'struck', 'school', 'bus', 'Mel', 'supernatural', 'experience', 'involving', 'Julie', 'convinced', 'little', 'girl', 'asking', 'help', 'investigation', 'discovers', 'Mary', 'Pearl', 'had', 'sister', 'named', 'Julie', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'bus', 'level', 'action', 'ramps', 'up', 'third', 'act', 'excitement', 'certainly', 'welcome', 'writing', ""n't"", 'do', 'credible', 'job', 'connecting', 'together', 'various', 'action', 'sequences', 'stretching', 'out', 'small', 'story', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'writers', 'must', 'believe', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'big', 'reveal', 'bus', 'accident', 'long', 'hidden', 'crimes', 'secret', 'dungeon', 'are', 'pretty', 'laughable', 'motivation', 'mayhem', 'involving', 'construction', 'new', 'roadway', 'something', 'right', 'Scooby', 'Doo.Seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'Leah', 'Pipes', 'mature', 'age', 'satisfactory', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'animated', 'Sally', 'Kirkland', 'best', 'make', 'things', 'fun', 'writing', ""n't"", 'as', 'kind', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'off', 'rather', 'cartoonish', 'practical', 'effects', 'are', 'mostly', 'good', 'couple', 'gory', 'kills', 'other', 'effects', 'speeded', 'up', 'footage', 'moving', 'train', 'fast', 'cut', 'editing', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'convincing', 'Apparently', 'intended', 'audience', ""n't"", 'very', 'critical', 'Fingerprints', 'lot', 'things', 'mix', 'trying', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'almost', 'many', 'laughs', 'thrills', 'earning', 'rating', '2.5', 'stars']",Fingerprints
