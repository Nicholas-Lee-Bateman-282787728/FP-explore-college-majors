I like 'rust never sleeps&quot; because it takes place in 1979 so you get to see him when he was at his prime, also nice selection of songs.  I like 'year of the horse&quot; because there's interviews with him and his band so you get to know him a bit. 'Red rocks' takes place in the year 2000 but like a good aged wine Neil Young never looses his appeal.  Some of my favourite on this dvd are 'words'and 'cowgirl in the sand'.  I like the long ones when Neil lets loose and goes crazy with his guitar. I will quote from James Bond, 'nobody does it better, makes me feel sad for the rest, nobody does it better, Neil your the best'.",5,this was the dvd I was waiting for,1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,751,"['have', '2', 'other', 'dvds', 'Neil', 'Young', ""'year"", 'horse', ""'rust"", 'never', 'sleeps', 'quot', 'far', 'one', 'favourite', 'like', 'never', 'sleeps', 'quot', 'place', '1979', 'get', 'see', 'when', 'was', 'prime', 'also', 'nice', 'selection', 'songs', 'like', ""'year"", 'horse', 'quot', 'interviews', 'band', 'so', 'get', 'know', 'bit', 'rocks', 'place', 'year', '2000', 'good', 'aged', 'wine', 'Neil', 'Young', 'never', 'appeal', 'favourite', 'dvd', 'are', ""'words'and"", ""'cowgirl"", 'sand', 'long', 'ones', 'when', 'Neil', 'loose', 'crazy', 'guitar', 'will', 'quote', 'James', 'Bond', ""'nobody"", 'better', 'feel', 'sad', 'rest', 'nobody', 'better', 'Neil', 'best']",N/A

564925,AJEOAE62QE5Y1,B000053U0B,Gerald B. Johnson,"[9, 15]","Lets get this straight from the start. I love Neil Young. He's created some of the most beautiful music of any artist in my lifetime. But he's getting on, he's slowing down, and it shows in this concert.I wouldn't say that this is a bad video, or not worth owning, but it doesn't compare to his work in his prime. At the top of his game Neil Young would make your jaw drop, your head spin, he would overwhelm you like a force of Nature. It was like watching a Home Run hitter at the plate, sometimes he would strike out, sometimes he would belt one out of the park, but he was never boring.This version of Neil Young is not the same, it is a natural evolution I guess, we all get older. What is missing from this performance pure and simply is &quot;Passion&quot;. No-one really seems to care about what they're doing, they are all having a good time, putting forth competant performances, but it lacks that 'razor's edge' quality. Neil Young always went for the jugular, and if he didn't kill you, he died a warrior's death, and you respected him for that.This version is a little too safe for me. There are a few very nice moments, and a lot of great songs. But I've heard better versions and 'nice' ain't what I'm looking for in a Neil Young concert. For those of you Neil Young fans wading through the numerous DVD offerings, I would suggest &quot;In Berlin&quot; as the best of the current bunch.

But now, having had my walls rocked by this performance, the negative words in some reviews don't hold rain water with me. What you have is the best seat in the house to an ultimately impassioned concert taking place at Red Rocks Amphitheater. Young is amazing as he leads the troups through a set that covers much of his career and hits a cressendo with World on a String, Tonight's the Night and an incredible performance of Cowgirl in the Sand. You truly get a concert experience with the 5.1 surround sound and feel you're part of a crowd that is not fazed by pounding rain. This concert is so much better than the cd of the same name. Don't expect Crazy Horse-like energy from the backup musicians, they mostly provide the canvas for Neil to paint his artwork on.
