We have so many Sesame Street dvds and I knew the kids would love this, which they did.  All three of my children enjoy this dvd, even my 10 year old, who loves to see Sheryl Crow.I must say, I grow weary of people who complain that Elmo is not in every skit of every dvd on the shelf.  While Elmo is a wonderful addition to the cast of characters, Sesame Street was thriving long  before the red monster arrived and the older, classic characters taught a whole generation of children, the very ones who are parents now.  Elmo is fine, but give the other characters a chance to grow on your children too.This is a fun dvd, just as I expected it would be...fun for ALL AGES!",5,another winner from Sesame Street,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,767,"['bought', 'impulse', 'saw', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'cover', 'think', 'funny', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'dvds', 'knew', 'kids', 'would', 'love', 'did', 'three', 'children', 'enjoy', 'dvd', 'even', '10', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'see', 'Sheryl', 'Crow.I', 'must', 'say', 'grow', 'weary', 'people', 'who', 'complain', 'Elmo', 'not', 'skit', 'dvd', 'shelf', 'Elmo', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'cast', 'characters', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'was', 'thriving', 'long', 'red', 'monster', 'arrived', 'older', 'classic', 'characters', 'taught', 'whole', 'generation', 'children', 'very', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'parents', 'now', 'Elmo', 'fine', 'give', 'other', 'characters', 'chance', 'grow', 'children', 'fun', 'dvd', 'just', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'ALL', 'AGES']",N/A

To my complete disappointment, this is EVEN WORSE than than the prior release.  The songs are a total bore (save the Sheryl Crowe number which is quite nice) and all seem to follow a very similar country/folksy rock format.  Usually they do a better job of mixing it up.  The two people who play letters A and Z and narrate this whole mess have all the flavor of carboard crust pizza with ketchup for sauce.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this video at all costs; I feel sick for having wasted money on it.  There isn't even any scene worth cutting to and showing my students.  The ""special features"" are totally worthless animated cuts...  they have way better vintage stuff they could have used.  The earlier reviewer from Mass. must certainly work for PBS; I had never seen them so desparate to resort to those types of tactics before.  I gave Do the Alphabet three stars and sadly this really can't even merit two.

898014,A26N6ZLBVTZD1G,B00080ZG7O,"R. Foss ""RF""","[0, 0]","My son started reciting his alphabet at 11 months. And then writing them at 1 and half. We thought he had autism (doesn't)so ED came in and worked with him. They were in shock that a little guy his age could write and read. He is obsessed with the alphabet. A little more then dad and I would like but hey if that is his passion then that is his passion. We are always buying alphabet dvd's and toys for him.He loves this dvd because of the music. Another passion of his. The music is easy on the ears and fun for kids. I like how they go over each letter and make it special. Plus the dvd is kind of funnny with the constant battle between A and the letter Z.  Other alphabet dvd's that are good are Inky Star alphabet. Which is really good for kids under two or even small infants kind of like baby einstein. It has music and goes over each letter. Also Elmo has another with grover and they go over each letter too. Another fun one is Blues Clues Alphabet Power(older kids may like). Tips: my husband starting singing the alphabet to my son since he was born. Every night before bed. He did it to get him to fall asleep because we thought it was a boring monotone song. But over time it just sort of stimulated his brain keeping him awake. He is now obsessed. I believe any child can learn early with determination just like reading. It's not something I push on my child, if anything he pushes it on me. LOL But kids can get discouraged if pushed too hard. And it may not be their passion. I love kids and believe everyone is good at something. I believe God has gifted every person with something their good at. Never get discouraged just keep searching for that passion.",5,A for Amazing,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1676,"['son', 'started', 'reciting', 'alphabet', '11', 'months', 'then', 'writing', '1', 'half', 'thought', 'had', 'autism', ""n't"", 'so', 'ED', 'came', 'worked', 'were', 'shock', 'little', 'guy', 'age', 'could', 'write', 'read', 'obsessed', 'alphabet', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'dad', 'would', 'like', 'hey', 'passion', 'then', 'passion', 'are', 'always', 'buying', 'alphabet', 'dvd', 'him.He', 'dvd', 'music', 'passion', 'music', 'easy', 'ears', 'fun', 'kids', 'like', 'how', 'go', 'letter', 'make', 'special', 'dvd', 'kind', 'funnny', 'constant', 'battle', 'A', 'letter', 'Z', 'Other', 'alphabet', 'dvd', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'Inky', 'Star', 'alphabet', 'Which', 'really', 'good', 'kids', 'two', 'even', 'small', 'infants', 'kind', 'baby', 'einstein', 'music', 'letter', 'Also', 'Elmo', 'grover', 'go', 'letter', 'too', 'fun', 'one', 'Blues', 'Clues', 'Alphabet', 'Power', 'older', 'kids', 'may', 'like', 'Tips', 'husband', 'starting', 'singing', 'alphabet', 'son', 'was', 'born', 'night', 'bed', 'did', 'get', 'fall', 'asleep', 'thought', 'was', 'boring', 'monotone', 'song', 'time', 'just', 'sort', 'stimulated', 'brain', 'keeping', 'awake', 'now', 'obsessed', 'believe', 'child', 'can', 'learn', 'early', 'determination', 'just', 'reading', 'not', 'something', 'push', 'child', 'anything', 'LOL', 'kids', 'can', 'get', 'discouraged', 'pushed', 'too', 'hard', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'passion', 'love', 'kids', 'believe', 'everyone', 'good', 'something', 'believe', 'God', 'gifted', 'person', 'something', 'good', 'Never', 'get', 'discouraged', 'just', 'keep', 'searching', 'passion']",N/A

This video starts off REALLY boring with the A and Z walking around the mall talking to people about the letters.  My son wants to see characters and singing.  The parts with the Sesame Street gang and the songs are fun, but the rest is boring.  He lost attentinon with this video and normally he is enraptured by Sesame Street videos.
