I think there are a few charachters that were needless and brought down the quality of the movie.  The cooks (the son and dad) kind of made this movie dumb for me, along with the cousin and MC Lytes charachter.  None of these charachters really improved this movie.2.  Treach was terrible as well.  He's always been a terrible actor to me, ever since Jasons Lyric! In fact, imagine Treach's charachter in Jasons Lyric, well it's the same charachter here just bald!3.  And this plot twist that every one is talking about was not that big of a suprise.  I figured it out the first time the ""other woman"" came to the house.  If you pay close attention you'll see this plot twist and it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO dumb.The only thing anyone has said about this movie that I agreed with is Allen Payne and Elise Neil had good chemistry.  I would love to see them together again.",2,Noooo....Uh-uhn...Uh-uhhhhn!!!,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,983,"['movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'terrible', 'plot', 'was', 'decent', 'times', 'got', 'dumb', 'middle.1', 'think', 'are', 'few', 'charachters', 'were', 'needless', 'brought', 'down', 'quality', 'movie', 'cooks', 'son', 'dad', 'kind', 'made', 'movie', 'dumb', 'cousin', 'MC', 'Lytes', 'charachter', 'None', 'charachters', 'really', 'improved', 'movie.2', 'Treach', 'was', 'terrible', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'been', 'terrible', 'actor', 'ever', 'Jasons', 'Lyric', 'fact', 'imagine', 'Treach', 'charachter', 'Jasons', 'Lyric', 'well', 'same', 'charachter', 'here', 'just', 'bald', '3', 'plot', 'twist', 'one', 'talking', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'suprise', 'figured', 'out', 'first', 'time', 'other', 'woman', 'came', 'house', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'see', 'plot', 'twist', 'SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO', 'dumb.The', 'only', 'thing', 'anyone', 'said', 'movie', 'agreed', 'Allen', 'Payne', 'Elise', 'Neil', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'together', 'again']",Playas Ball

1017497,A36EJIHCD4FEKV,B000HWZ4UM,TUCKER BABY,"[0, 0]",There were two reasons why I continued to watch this movie.1. Allen Payne. I love him and think he acts very well when given good material to work with.2. The Last Scene.  I was curious to see if Allen was going to get with Elise.  I figured they would get together. This was the best scene in the movie.The movie was a little too ghetto for me and $13.99 was too expensive for this trash!,2,Not one of Allen's best movies,1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,389,"['were', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'continued', 'watch', 'movie.1', 'Allen', 'Payne', 'love', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'given', 'good', 'material', 'work', 'with.2', 'Last', 'Scene', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'Allen', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'Elise', 'figured', 'would', 'get', 'together', 'was', 'best', 'scene', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'ghetto', '13.99', 'was', 'too', 'expensive', 'trash']",Playas Ball

I enjoy seeing Elise Neal in anything because she also is a fine actor and very easy on the eyes to boot. Her character did represent some semblance of logic in this disorganized film.  I guess any work beats no work at all. I bought the DVD so I earned the right to be critical, two thumbs down from me.
