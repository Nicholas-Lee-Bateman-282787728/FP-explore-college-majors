We can seek excitement or adventure which Maya possesses but our lives call for a transfer of personal confidence and reliance in childhood to self awareness and integrity of manhood. A child knows his wants and can muster courage, but nothing as a life and death struggle in the wilds of India demands. A best friend is required that exceeds the guidance of a father. Maya, the elephant has its mahut Raji as the ready soulmate for Terry. Boyhood is surrendered in friendship and with this change Terry out grows his losses. He becomes what he needs to be because his new brother needs him as much as he is needed.
