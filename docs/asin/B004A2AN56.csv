1390324,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B004A2AN56,Aco,"[3, 3]","A pretty amazing statistical observation of this film's reviews here on Amazon; of 167 reviews (as of 10/6/12) 20% are 5 star, 22% are 4 star, 17% are 3 star, 18% are 2 star and 22% are 1 star. These stats alone have made me (possibly) reconsider my view of this film....Seems pretty rare to find a film with such a wide range of opinions.For my part I agree that this is a weak film, somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. I appreciate Oliver Stone, his kinetic, detailed exhibitions of masculine ambition, anger and occasional depravity are almost always watchable and layered enough to reflect a consistent world view and style. No stranger to Violence or it's more sophisticated and interesting counter, Power, his stories are usually about unlikeable people (Gekko, Barnes, U-Turn's whole cast, Savages, (can James Woods be likeable?), Nixon, Castro, Talk Radio) who can't help themselves pursuing their ambitions and temptations. I will make an effort to see his films until he craps out too much, and even then I'll give him a chance. Look at Woody Allen, lots of misses lately, but a few terrific and great films too. An artist can't hit home runs all the time; a ground out to second is inevitable now and then.Wall Street 2 is not a good movie. Calling it Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps doesn't isolate it from the original. This is a sequel. It felt so labored and predictable, and as opposed to the first film, it wasn't of it's time, it merely tried to comment on it. I don't know which moment was worse: Charlie Sheen showing up as Bud Fox at some charitable event with two models on his arm, playing Charlie instead of Bud or the Clark Kent to Superman moment when we're told that Gecko is back in full player mode because he slicked his hair back like in the old days. These moments highlight the cheapness of Stone's direction and the sense that this was made because the opportunity presented itself, not because the story had to be told.Certainly the financial collapse of '07-'08 will be a story motif for many years to come. The circumstances and out comes resound to this day and are scarier and more vile than the antics of Tony Montana or the drug dealers of Savages.Josh Brolin is the best part of the movie, he can command the screen and has a hulking presence and physicality that was also memorable in American Gangster. Surely the  drive that gets people to the highest floors of some of the largest buildings and businesses can't be abandoned once they are assured of their positions there. The snake can't help but eat it's tail. Sorry for another metaphor.Carrie Mulligan is wasted as the suffering daughter of Gekko, who rebels against the family business by operating a non-profit independent journalism website. Her role is to facilitate heart, since her father has none, or not much of one or is really out of practice using it. Susan Sarandon is wasted even more. The disparity between the careers of talents like hers and comparable men is pathetic. She gets to smoke and act stupid, begging her brilliant son to save her. The women in Stone's films are usually badly drawn and either ball busters or weak. At least he is consistent though. And Shia LaBeouf, who is a better actor than Charlie Sheen for sure, just feels like another big budget American movie character; uber smart, very successful, cool and honorable. Matt Damon may have played this part 10 years before. You know, a flawless character who is a foiled by a darker, more cynical outside world that he seems surprised to discover.Ultimately this film makes me feel more cynical about it's production than the story it aims to tell.Here's to the 18%!",2,Wall Street 2: Puts Me To Sleeps,1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,3649,"['pretty', 'amazing', 'statistical', 'observation', 'film', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', '167', 'reviews', '10/6/12', '20', '%', 'are', '5', 'star', '22', '%', 'are', '4', 'star', '17', '%', 'are', '3', 'star', '18', '%', 'are', '2', 'star', '22', '%', 'are', '1', 'star', 'stats', 'alone', 'have', 'made', 'possibly', 'reconsider', 'view', 'film', 'pretty', 'rare', 'find', 'film', 'wide', 'range', 'opinions.For', 'part', 'agree', 'weak', 'film', 'somewhere', '2', '3', 'stars', 'appreciate', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'kinetic', 'detailed', 'exhibitions', 'masculine', 'ambition', 'anger', 'occasional', 'depravity', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'watchable', 'layered', 'enough', 'reflect', 'consistent', 'world', 'view', 'style', 'No', 'stranger', 'Violence', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'interesting', 'counter', 'Power', 'stories', 'are', 'usually', 'unlikeable', 'people', 'Gekko', 'Barnes', 'U-Turn', 'whole', 'cast', 'Savages', 'can', 'James', 'Woods', 'be', 'likeable', 'Nixon', 'Castro', 'Talk', 'Radio', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pursuing', 'ambitions', 'temptations', 'will', 'make', 'effort', 'see', 'films', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'then', ""'ll"", 'give', 'chance', 'Look', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'lots', 'misses', 'lately', 'few', 'terrific', 'great', 'films', 'too', 'artist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'home', 'runs', 'time', 'ground', 'second', 'inevitable', 'now', 'then.Wall', 'Street', '2', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'Calling', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', ""n't"", 'isolate', 'original', 'sequel', 'felt', 'so', 'labored', 'predictable', 'opposed', 'first', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'merely', 'tried', 'comment', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'moment', 'was', 'worse', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'showing', 'up', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'charitable', 'event', 'two', 'models', 'arm', 'playing', 'Charlie', 'instead', 'Bud', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'moment', 'when', ""'re"", 'told', 'Gecko', 'back', 'full', 'player', 'mode', 'slicked', 'hair', 'back', 'old', 'days', 'moments', 'highlight', 'cheapness', 'Stone', 'direction', 'sense', 'was', 'made', 'opportunity', 'presented', 'not', 'story', 'had', 'be', 'told.Certainly', 'financial', 'collapse', ""'07-'08"", 'will', 'be', 'story', 'motif', 'many', 'years', 'come', 'circumstances', 'out', 'resound', 'day', 'are', 'scarier', 'more', 'vile', 'antics', 'Tony', 'Montana', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Savages.Josh', 'Brolin', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'can', 'command', 'screen', 'hulking', 'presence', 'physicality', 'was', 'also', 'memorable', 'American', 'Gangster', 'Surely', 'drive', 'people', 'highest', 'floors', 'largest', 'buildings', 'businesses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'abandoned', 'are', 'assured', 'positions', 'there', 'snake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'eat', 'tail', 'Sorry', 'metaphor.Carrie', 'Mulligan', 'wasted', 'suffering', 'daughter', 'Gekko', 'who', 'family', 'business', 'operating', 'non-profit', 'independent', 'journalism', 'website', 'role', 'facilitate', 'heart', 'father', 'none', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'really', 'practice', 'using', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'wasted', 'even', 'more', 'disparity', 'careers', 'talents', 'hers', 'comparable', 'men', 'pathetic', 'smoke', 'act', 'stupid', 'begging', 'brilliant', 'son', 'save', 'women', 'Stone', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'badly', 'drawn', 'ball', 'busters', 'weak', 'least', 'consistent', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'who', 'better', 'actor', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'sure', 'just', 'feels', 'big', 'budget', 'American', 'movie', 'character', 'uber', 'smart', 'very', 'successful', 'cool', 'honorable', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'part', '10', 'years', 'before', 'know', 'flawless', 'character', 'who', 'foiled', 'darker', 'more', 'cynical', 'outside', 'world', 'surprised', 'discover.Ultimately', 'film', 'feel', 'more', 'cynical', 'production', 'story', 'tell.Here', '18', '%']",N/A

1390327,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004A2AN56,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Most people that I know regard the original `Wall Street' as `not as good as I remembered it', if they remembered it fondly at all.  In fact, it took me nearly four tries to actually get through the entire film.  It bordered on boring and redundant and the pacing was terrible.  Of course, Michael Douglas's portrayal of greedy corporate shark Gordon Gekko is iconic and his `signature performance', so there is always that.  This reboot, `Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' doesn't do a whole lot to improve on the original, but it is an improvement if we are going to be completely honest.  It has the same elements of greed and corruption but it also has familiar tensions thanks to the introduction of Gordon's daughter Winnie and her overachieving fianc&eacute;e who is just dying to get inside her father's world.  Some of the film can come across very cheesy and underdeveloped (Gekko's motivational speech for instance has no substance and felt like a `made for TV' moment) and some of the character development came across roughly though out (like that symbolic yet oddly underdeveloped motorcycle race).  Still, there are some aspects of this film that really work, like Carey Mulligan.  My god, she continues to be like the greatest thing in every film she's in.  She develops her character marvelously, and exhibits real flesh and bones.  Douglas rehashes a lot with an unbelievable tone, but he's Michael Douglas so all is forgiven.  The script is the real culprit here, for it just doesn't have a lot of weight.  It tries hard to be relevant and poignant, but in doing so it becomes almost too real to feel exciting.  There are segments that feel like newsreels and others that feel like poorly realized interpretations of `actual events'.  The film looks fresh though, and the pacing here is a true lifesaver.  I wouldn't ignore this completely, especially if you are a fan of the original or of the cast and director, but don't expect it to be outstanding because it isn't.",3,A little undercooked...,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,1987,"['Most', 'people', 'know', 'regard', 'original', 'Wall', 'Street', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'remembered', 'fondly', 'fact', 'took', 'nearly', 'four', 'tries', 'actually', 'get', 'entire', 'film', 'bordered', 'boring', 'redundant', 'pacing', 'was', 'terrible', 'course', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'portrayal', 'greedy', 'corporate', 'shark', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'iconic', 'signature', 'performance', 'always', 'that', 'reboot', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'improve', 'original', 'improvement', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'same', 'elements', 'greed', 'corruption', 'also', 'familiar', 'tensions', 'thanks', 'introduction', 'Gordon', 'daughter', 'Winnie', 'overachieving', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'who', 'just', 'dying', 'get', 'father', 'world', 'film', 'can', 'come', 'very', 'cheesy', 'underdeveloped', 'Gekko', 'motivational', 'speech', 'instance', 'substance', 'felt', 'made', 'TV', 'moment', 'character', 'development', 'came', 'roughly', 'out', 'symbolic', 'yet', 'oddly', 'underdeveloped', 'motorcycle', 'race', 'Still', 'are', 'aspects', 'film', 'really', 'work', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'My', 'god', 'be', 'greatest', 'thing', 'film', 'character', 'marvelously', 'exhibits', 'real', 'flesh', 'bones', 'Douglas', 'lot', 'unbelievable', 'tone', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'forgiven', 'script', 'real', 'culprit', 'here', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'weight', 'hard', 'be', 'relevant', 'poignant', 'doing', 'almost', 'too', 'real', 'feel', 'exciting', 'are', 'segments', 'feel', 'newsreels', 'others', 'feel', 'poorly', 'realized', 'interpretations', 'actual', 'events', 'film', 'fresh', 'pacing', 'here', 'true', 'lifesaver', 'would', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'completely', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'original', 'cast', 'director', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'outstanding', ""n't""]",N/A

They were deceived by the movie poster and by the previews, which conveyed a very different plot.The poster makes it look like the movie is about Gordon Gekko mentoring another young stock broker, but it's not. It's about Shia Labeouf's character trying to patch things up between Gekko and his estranged daughter, who happens to be Labeouf's girlfriend.It seems like most mainstream films have romantic sub-plots, either to humanize the characters so that when tragedy strikes the audience will feel sympathy for them, or to give women in the audience a bone to chew on. Here Wall Street is the sub-plot and the drama between Labeouf, his girlfriend and Gekko takes center stage.How could a man in a Wall Street occupation even have time for a girlfriend? Most Wall Street employees work 60+ hours a week, including weekends. These aren't 9-to-5 jobs. And why doesn't Labeouf ever look exhausted for that matter? When he's talking to his homely girlfriend, he appears fresh and composed.The film attempts to show the tender side of Gordon Gekko, but that is not what made him a great character. He was interesting as a ruthless speculator, gathering inside information and espousing his ""greed is good"" philosophy. In this movie he is sappy, weird and preachy.Anyone hoping for a dramatization of the recent financial crisis will be disappointed.

Also, I was anticipating a big drop off in terms of performance and content in writing, especially after seeing the crapfest out of Alexander by the great illustrious Oliver Stone. Finally, he is back.The best part of the film, as being the number one reason why I wanted to see it, is Michael Douglas, who turned in an unbelievably top-notch performance as the famous Gordon ""Greed Is Good"" Gecko. He never disappointed me for the slightest second. Of course, the most anticipated moment of the film was his meeting with Bud Fox, another famous character from the masterpiece. That was quite hysterical in a nostalgic way. Probably the only complaint I have of Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is the times of poor camera work, especially when Gordon Gecko is giving a lecture in an assembly hall. Although Shia LaBeouf couldn't act if his life depended on it, I thought he did fairly well, considering the kind of a cast that he was working with. Josh Brolin, whom I am very, very familiar with his great work from 80's, is a real charm to watch, and he is already an excellent actor.

Seeing all the bad reviews for this movie I had held off seeing it.  I am a great fan of almost all the stars especially Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf.  I finally thought how bad can it really be and ordered it on demand on cable.  I am writing this review to warn everyone - with this movie it honestly is not a matter of opinion, the movie is just plain terrible.  I don't get how people are going overboard criticizing the acting for there is very little for any of the actors to do.  I blame this disaster on Oliver Stone and him alone.  He is obviously trying to make a statement on money, its business etc.  No point is made and there is no story.  All the actors walk through each scene like zombies for the entire script is ridiculous.  There is no emotion for the acrtors to grasp onto.  The scenes where tears are shown are laughable for they are so poorly written and directed.  With this movie there is no beginning, middle or end.  When it was finally gratefully over I just felt like I had wasted 2 hours.  I had no idea what the point of it all was.  I really want to know what power Oliver Stone used to convince all these A list actors to participate in this terrible film.

1390333,A30TQET02FLSUX,B004A2AN56,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[8, 10]","There are a lot of great moments in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), director Oliver Stone's sequel to the landmark 80s film Wall Street (1987). I wish I could say that all those great moments add up to more, but they don't. Wall Street 2 is a good solid movie and well worth seeing for anyone who has seen the first one, but I feel like it lives a bit in the shadow of the original, like so many sequels. A few rare sequels that I think outshine their masterful predecessors are The Bourne Supremacy (2004), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Superman II (1980), and Clear and Present Danger (1994). But those sequels are the exception to the rule to say the least. I give the original Wall Street 3.5 out of 5 stars and the sequel 3 out of 5 stars. Both movies have scenes that are a perfect 5, but the narrative that wants to tie these unbelievable scenes together in both movies doesn't quite work. Something doesn't quite gel. Regardless, both movies are well worth watching, and the timing for the sequel is perfect. I saw it in the theater on Friday, opening day. I'm curious to see the opening week box office numbers to see how others responded to it. The trailers were perfect and got me extremely psyched to see the film right when it came out. And there are some great scenes in the film not revealed in the trailer.Shia LaBeouf is excellent as the young whipper-snapper protege replacement for Charlie Sheen, along with Carey Mulligan as his love interest and the daughter of Gordon Gekko. Josh Brolin plays the new 2000's Gordon Gekko replacement bad guy with perfect ease. And Gekko himself is reprised by the great Michael Douglas. There's no question in my mind that Douglas deserved his Oscar win for Best Actor as Gekko in the original Wall Street. It was and still is the role that defines him in my mind. The Academy got it right with that award for that particular role and not another. No one ever wonders who else could have been Gekko. Douglas owns this role. And we see flashes of that same brilliance 23 years later in Wall Street 2. The thing about film sometimes is that it has to age like wine. It might be bold and exciting when its young, but its true impact and depth can't always be appreciated until years later after it has sat awhile. The original Wall Street is now clearly an iconic and defining film from the height (and end) of the Reagon 80s...that ""greed is good"" time in our history that brought us to the collapse now in 2008-2010 when greed is no longer just good, it's legal, as Douglas quips in the new movie. I recently re-watched the original film and loved getting back into that time of cell phones the size of sub sandwiches.What I'm left with from both of these movies is a realization that money and greed really aren't the game that's played on Wall Street. The game is ""King of the Hill"".

Michael Douglas is the only reason to see this, if only to be paraded around as a soundbite machine while the rest of the film is miscast and simplistic. Stone slathers on his ""messages"" like a fat teenager with a jar of Miracle Whip; there are little hints of what has lead to the financial collapse here and there but the characters and plot are so cookie cutter that the film barely manages to capture a scintilla of the energy and drama of the street -- and what is here is pretty unrealistic.Shia LaBoef was a terrible choice as the lead -- Stone fails at presenting him as some kind of wunderkind, and he has neither the chops or charisma of Charlie Sheen back in '87. Cary Mulligan looks like a sad wee elf, while Susan Sarandon and Josh Brolin chew their dialogue so badly it's hard not to laugh. ""Wall Street"" is probably Stone's best film and rises above its cheese factor thanks to some compelling characters and an accurate portrayal of the kind of sacrifices it takes to become a player. Gordon Gecko was a fascinating character who made a lot of sense with his Faustian bargains and the like. There are hints of it here; probably the best scene in the film is where Gecko gives a presentation to college students as a kind of sequel to his ""Greed is Good"" speech.

1390345,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004A2AN56,C. Sawin,"[4, 9]","So first things first, I haven't seen the original Wall Street film from 1987 and know little to nothing about the market itself. Oliver Stone, who is certainly a very talented director, hasn't really made a film that I've loved. Considering all these factors, I was wondering how Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps would measure up. While a good portion of the film seemed to take solace in the massive amount of stock market jargon spewed throughout its entire duration, hiding underneath that layer of the film was where Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps truly shined.The first forty five minutes or so of the film come off as slightly convoluted. It almost feels intentionally overly complicated in its execution, but once the film starts to present itself as more of a revenge tale for Jacob Moore and focuses on the relationship between Gordon and Winnie Gekko things begin to get a bit more interesting.Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is full of nothing but solid performances from the entire cast. The only weak link of the bunch was Carey Mulligan who seemed to just cry every time she was on screen. Michael Douglas steals the spotlight every time he's given screen time. This is the type of role he was meant to play. While Shia LaBeouf has shown in the past that he has some untapped potential as an actor, he really steps it up here and this could be the best performance of his career so far. The on screen chemistry between these actors is unbelievably strong. Any scene involving Josh Brolin and Shia LaBeouf conversing with one another is one of the best in the film. There's also the scene where Douglas is pleading with Mulligan to give him another chance as a father that is incredibly memorable. Watching the relationship between LaBeouf and Mulligan fall apart is really powerful, as well. This stellar cast is near perfect for this film.While Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps starts off as a purposely baffling drama that revolves around the stock market and is somehow more talkative and dialogue driven than a Tarantino film, the film evolves into a rather intricate tale of revenge that is driven by nothing but strong performances all around.

While more mature cinematographically and done with a larger budget, Money Never Sleeps is still marred by Oliver Stone's heavy-handedness, tin ear, and inability to create believable plots and characters or to cast appropriately.  Like the original, this entire film rides not on any artistic merit but on the inherent sexiness of money and power and Michael Douglas' ability to embody it.My theory is that the script for this movie started life as an art student project about a girl who raises money to discover alternative energy by kissing a young Wall Street frog and turning him into a leftist eco-prince.  Then Oliver Stone got hold of it and added board room scenes and a styrofoam villain and made it ""topical"" by mentioning the housing crisis, which is really only incidental to the film.The only possible real drama in the film--the relationship between Gordon Gekko and his daughter--is gutted by a Deus ex Machina sonogram, and even this is ruined by a lame ending in which Gekko shows up and convinces the lovers to get back together by pointing out that nobody's perfect.  Much more interesting would have been for Gekko to keep the money he steals but point out to his daughter that her behavior of sacrificing her family out of rigidity proves that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  She is in her own way just as selfish and short-sighted as her father.  Then we could have seen some real struggle and growth, but it wouldn't have been PC, so instead the girl sacrifices nothing and gets to live in a giant expensive apartment while acting like a poor Earth-friendly hippie and the guy ends up in a purple cardigan.  The most satisfying part of the movie was knowing that when Gekko gives back the movie, he's already dec-tupled it so he still has plenty of bank.And you know that scene where LaBeouf tells the girl ""this thing's going to happen again and again because want to hear comforting stories""?

But nobody ever expected Oliver Stone to undermine the original's thematic concept that ""greed is good.""  This film is, in many ways (and this isn't a spoiler, although it sounds like one) Gordon Gekko's redemption.  And Gordon Gekko shouldn't be redeemed.The film centers on up-and-comer Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf doing better than usual, though not quite good enough), who happens to be in love with Gekko's daughter (Carrie Mulligan, the moral heart of the film).  Moore decides to take on Gekko's rival Bretton James (a menacing Josh Brolin).  What ensues begins as an intriguing film, with Moore confronting Gekko's immorality head-on.Michael Douglas is still a solid actor; no one could play this character like he could, and Gekko is still a vibrant villain, still a greedy take-all-comers.  LeBeuf's Moore is an ant compared to him; he's the kind of guy Gekko wouldn't spit on if he were on fire--and what exactly LeBeouf is doing here (and in the latest Indiana Jones fim) is beyond me.  Mulligan belongs here, and so do Brolin--actors capable of holding their own with Douglas in a role he's clearly comfortable in.  The script isn't even half-bad, but the final third of the film is a complete waste of time.  Why Oliver Stone felt he had to end the Gekko legacy this way is a mystery; has Stone gone soft, perhaps?  Either way, WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS is a fine two-thirds of a film, and those two-thirds are easily worth a rental price.  But ultimately, the film is a disappointment; it places too much emphasis on LeBeouf, who is good in some situations but is not capable of carrying a film of this magnitude.  The film also tries to eradicate the original's staying power; fortunately, WALL STREET is such a powerful, thoughtful film that it's here to stay.  The sequel, on the other hand, is forgettable; a rare write-off for Stone.

Don't compare apples to oranges! Different, both good, but not for the same reasons.""Wall Street II"" is worth watching (again and again) for several reasons:1. Great acting by superstar actors like Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen (not credited, but part of the movie for about 60 seconds....the best 60 seconds in the movie!).The ""accidental meeting at a party"" of 1987 ""Wall Street"" stars Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen is electric. These two guys are dynamite, and when mixed, produce incredible dramatics not seen in the rest of the movie, or in most other movies, anywhere.Two superstars, no other way to describe them.The movie is worth watching just for the quick take sequence which includes the return of ""Bud Fox"" (Charlie Sheen) meeting up with ""Gordon Gekko"" (Michael Douglas), both recently out of prison for ""insider information victimless crime"" offenses, and both doing great!You'll go a long way to see better, more dynamic superstar actor work than these two guys provide in this movie.It's explosive, and it's precious. Anyone who cares for incredible acting MUST see the Gekko and Fox Meetup part of the ""Wall Street II.""2. Michael Douglas is an incredible actor of high gifts. He deserved his Best Actor Academy Award from ""Wall Street I"" (1987) and this movie (""Wall Street II"") shows that with good writing and the right story, he can do the same good work, again and again and again.It is a pleasure and a privilege to see the great Michael Douglas act in ""Wall Street II."" His Dad, Kirk Douglas (aka ""Isadore Dempsky"") would be proud of son Mike.His weight in the movie is bad, and director Oliver Stone wisely shoots around the newly enlarged (too big) waistline Mike has in ""Wall Street II.""But...what the hell? Nobody's perfect.Other ""nobody's perfect"" fat movie stars in the movie include Sylvia Miles (see her before she gained weight in ""Midnight Cowboy"" [1969], and Susan Sarandon, who plays the mother of the young man star of the movie with a the strange name ""Shia LeBoeuf"" or something like that.The commentary (available on the DVD versions of this movie) of Oliver Stone is wonderful.Stone went to two famous prep schools (Trinity School in Manhattan, and the Hill School) and then went to Yale U. Then to NYC Film School.He is an educated, cultured man, and his commentary is filled with references to Greek mythical figures like Tiresias and others one learns only when one goes to the best-of-the-best classical eastern USA private schools....which Oliver Stone did!The DVD commentaries part of ""Wall Street II"" are a pleasure to listen to, and that is also true of other commentaries Oliver Stone provides for other DVD's I've seen and heard done by him, especially including his ""W"" movie.He's smart, interesting, and his company is for sale in these DVD commentaries, and he's worth inviting to dinner!Make sure the dinner you provide has gourmet tasty food and a beautiful, intriguing, promising female dinner partner for your guest, Oliver Stone.Great company from a smart, interesting, intelligent, and gracious man.Get this ""feel good"" movie and keep it close.You won't regret it!-------------Written by Tex (David) Allen.",5,"""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" (2010) is a great movie in surprising ways, not obvious, but worth thinking about!",1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,3484,"['Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', '2010', 'great', 'movie', 'surprising', 'ways', 'not', 'obvious', 'thinking', 'First', 'different', 'excellent', 'deservedly', 'praised', 'honored', 'Wall', 'Street', '1987', 'movie', 'starring', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Wall', 'Street', 'II', 'good', 'different', 'reasons', 'Do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'apples', 'oranges', 'Different', 'good', 'not', 'same', 'reasons', 'Wall', 'Street', 'II', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'several', 'reasons:1', 'Great', 'acting', 'superstar', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'not', 'credited', 'part', 'movie', 'about', '60', 'seconds', '.the', 'best', '60', 'seconds', 'movie', '.The', 'accidental', 'meeting', 'party', '1987', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'electric', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'dynamite', 'when', 'mixed', 'produce', 'incredible', 'dramatics', 'not', 'seen', 'rest', 'movie', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'anywhere.Two', 'superstars', 'other', 'way', 'describe', 'them.The', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'quick', 'take', 'sequence', 'return', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'meeting', 'up', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'recently', 'prison', 'insider', 'information', 'victimless', 'crime', 'offenses', 'doing', 'great', ""'ll"", 'go', 'long', 'way', 'see', 'better', 'more', 'dynamic', 'superstar', 'actor', 'work', 'two', 'guys', 'provide', 'movie.It', 'explosive', 'precious', 'Anyone', 'who', 'incredible', 'acting', 'MUST', 'see', 'Gekko', 'Fox', 'Meetup', 'part', 'Wall', 'Street', 'II.', '2', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'incredible', 'actor', 'high', 'gifts', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Wall', 'Street', '1987', 'movie', 'Wall', 'Street', 'II', 'good', 'writing', 'right', 'story', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'good', 'work', 'again', 'again', 'again.It', 'pleasure', 'privilege', 'see', 'great', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'act', 'Wall', 'Street', 'II', 'Dad', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Isadore', 'Dempsky', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'son', 'Mike.His', 'weight', 'movie', 'bad', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'wisely', 'shoots', 'newly', 'enlarged', 'too', 'big', 'waistline', 'Mike', 'Wall', 'Street', 'II', 'what', 'hell', 'Nobody', 'perfect.Other', 'nobody', 'perfect', 'fat', 'movie', 'stars', 'movie', 'include', 'Sylvia', 'Miles', 'see', 'gained', 'weight', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', '[', '1969', ']', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'mother', 'young', 'man', 'star', 'movie', 'strange', 'name', 'Shia', 'LeBoeuf', 'something', 'that.The', 'commentary', 'available', 'DVD', 'versions', 'movie', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'wonderful.Stone', 'went', 'two', 'famous', 'prep', 'schools', 'Trinity', 'School', 'Manhattan', 'Hill', 'School', 'then', 'went', 'Yale', 'U', 'Then', 'NYC', 'Film', 'School.He', 'educated', 'cultured', 'man', 'commentary', 'filled', 'references', 'Greek', 'mythical', 'figures', 'Tiresias', 'others', 'one', 'only', 'when', 'one', 'best-of-the-best', 'classical', 'eastern', 'USA', 'private', 'schools', '.which', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'did', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'part', 'Wall', 'Street', 'II', 'are', 'pleasure', 'listen', 'also', 'true', 'other', 'commentaries', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'other', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'done', 'especially', 'including', 'W', 'movie.He', 'smart', 'interesting', 'company', 'sale', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'worth', 'inviting', 'dinner', 'Make', 'sure', 'dinner', 'provide', 'gourmet', 'tasty', 'food', 'beautiful', 'intriguing', 'promising', 'female', 'dinner', 'partner', 'guest', 'Oliver', 'Stone.Great', 'company', 'smart', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'gracious', 'man.Get', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'keep', 'close.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', '-Written', 'Tex', 'David', 'Allen']",N/A

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","At the risk of being vilified by my fellow reviewers I will delicately scamper out on that metaphorical ledge to opine that I very much liked the sequel WALL STREET:  MONEY NEVER SLEEPS.  I enjoyed the continuity to the bawdy and delightfully rap scallion original; yet even more I enjoyed the evolution of ornery Gordon Gekko (and Michael Douglas was born to play this role).  As this film draws to its conclusion director Oliver Stone actually has this hombre exhibit some (slightly) redeemable qualities.  That surprised me (in a pleasant way) and added to my enjoyment of this mellower tale of wheeling and dealing in utopian green technology in this the cyber age.Yes, Gordo is out of prison and looking to rebuild his financial empire; but he's also looking to reconcile with the only family member he has left, his estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan, grow your hair out, please).  And over the course of these endeavors he happens to impress--and accordingly become the mentor of--Winnie's fiance, Jake (could someone please inform Shia LaBeouf his fifteen minutes of fame has ended?).  LaBeouf is the definite weak link in this ensemble; he can talk stock options, leverages, buyouts, and mergers all he wants, but he still looks like a 9th grader trying to sneak a peek into the girls' shower.  This distraction, however, did not (overall) take away from my enjoyment of the film.  Other solid performances include Frank Langella as Jake's former employer and mentor and Josh Brolin as the greedy, unethical uber villain.  But then again, Josh could read the phone book and still come across as conniving and maniacal.  But the ultimate treat was Charlie Sheen making a cameo as bad boy Bud Fox.  And we find out that, twenty years after having gotten his Road to Damascus comeuppance, he hasn't learned a blasted thing.As a scheming capitalist, I loved it.As for Eli Wallach, the blessed old gentleman, and his whistling, bird-like noises and weak gesticulations:  Why?I suppose WALL STREET:  MONEY NEVER SLEEPS gets so many raspberries from so many disappointed viewers due to the fact the protagonists don't collapse under the metaphorical houses of cards built by their own greed.  There is actual reconciliation and reclamation; I know, I know, for evil 1 per centers that's absolutely unthinkable.  Then again, this is a different time than the Eighties, with its Cindy Lauper tunes and poodle hair-dos.  Gordon Gecko has mellowed; maybe the rest of us should do the same.--D.

Great movie.There is much wit and wisdom in the one-liners.  Even if they sound like fortune cookie ""Confucious says..."" cliches.There are many fresh cinematographic views of Manhattan.  The vertical oblique shot of the iconic 55 Wall Street building was an unusual aspect of the building.  This was the building where the Great Depression of 1929 started: it was the premises of the New York City Bank, now Citibank.  The apartments within had high profile marketing in Singapore last year: get to be neighbours with Naomi Campbell, Bruce Willis, Harvey Weinstein, Mickey Rourke, and other celebs in what is now the Cipriani Building.Shia LaBeouf speaking in Chinese was comically weird.  For a movie based on real events, the spoken Chinese sounded bizarre.  There are dialect coaches for actors for regional accents in the USA, so why not for Chinese.  When this movie is expected to be seen by Chinese around the world, the absence of proper pronunciation of Chinese is a huge oversight.Conversely, the Chinese executive patronising the Yanks in melodramatic Charlie Chan English had me in stitches.  Chinese or any foreigner working at the level of billion dollar deals speak impeccable English these days - and they are likely to be American Ivy League graduates as well.Tonal inflections change the meaning of spoken Chinese words.  Take ""pi fang"" for example.  Different tones can change the context from ""I have come with three examples for you"" to ""I have come to fart three times for you"".  Hollywood has yet to make such a gaffe.  Lack of proper coaching for Chinese is false economy, particularly for a movie as fine as this one.Michael Douglas says maybe only 75 people in the world understand what CDO, CMO, SIV, ABS mean. No tonal inflections needed for Collateralised Debt Obligations, Collateralised Mortgage Obligations, Structured Investment Vehicles, Asset Backed Securities.  Welcome to the cognoscenti.Ignore the critics who panned this movie.  Demanding perfection for every movie is the unrealistic expectation of critics, and their opinions often mislead those of us who merely wish to be entertained.Comments about the sequel not measuring up to the original are trite and stating the obvious.  (for a lot worse, think Miss Congeniality 2, Behind Enemy Lines 2, Highlander 2, Legally Blonde 2, Karate Kid 2, Dirty Dancing 2, Speed 2, Gone with the Wind 2 aka Scarlett, Basic Instinct 2 and other bombs)Audiences are intelligent enough to distinguish gravitas from schmaltz.  If Michael Douglas can go on to do a Wall Street series, like Rocky, Indiana Jones or Star Wars, I am sure there will be a following.  Let the box office and dvd sales, not critics, decide.Michael Douglas' ""If you stop telling lies about me, I will stop telling the truth about you"" is actually an Adlai Stevenson 1952 quote.Warren Buffett, no less, had a cameo role as himself.

They should have never made a sequel to the the classic Wall Street. Money never sleeps will put you the sleep. The best scene was the cameo with Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas which reminded me why the first movie was so good. To say the plot is convoluted is an understatement. Bottom line, there was no plot. The story was just a mishmash of 2008 financial crisis with reference to Lehman Brothers and that week in September when the government had to bail out the financial institutions. The script was awful and corny. The writers had to put in financial jargon such as CDO, CDS, Sub-prime, bailout at every opportunity just for the sake of it. More annoyingly, I think there was at least 15min's of footage of CNBC which added no value at all. I mean literally everyone from CNBC had a bit in the movie, Maria B, Cramer, the Brain, Mark Haines, the Korean anchor (I forgot her name), Becky Q. Even Roubini and Buffet were featured. There was so much filler in the movie, without it, it would have 30 min's. Oliver Stone himself had at least 3 scenes. The acting was atrocious. It's true Michael Douglas can't act. His Oscar in Wall Street was a fluke. His acting in this movie is the same as his others like ""A Perfect Murder"" where he also played a financier. Shia LaB and the Carey girl had no on screen chemistry. All in all the characters were shallow and unbelievable. Josh Brolin also didn't seem to quite fit in as a business baddie. And what was Eli W doing in the movie? Maybe they are going to do a remake of ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", because Shia LaB's blackberry ringtone kept going off. For those who loved the original Wall St, the sequel is a travesty. Oliver Stone was lazy and must have been on high on drugs when he made this trash. There were so many references to the original Wall Street, it was a joke. Scenes in Central Park, boardroom scenes, trading floor scenes, even down to the scene with the real estate agent that sold Bud Fox his apartment was back in the sequel. Come on, at least think of something original!I don't know how much money they spent on this film, but they should have given it to the government so they could have helped people out with their mortgages instead.

Michael Douglas was reportedly gravely ill when he reprised his most memorable role as Gekko, a fiction so perfect that a whole generation of greedy B-school grads thought he was true history.But ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" has bottom line deficits also, principal among them being Shia LaBeouf in the role of Jake, the ethically floundering boyfriend of Winnie (Carey Mulligan), who happens to be the alienated daughter of Gekko. Here's where we need Lloyd Bentsen's famous quip: ""Listen, Jake, I knew Charlie Sheen, and you're no Charlie Sheen."" LaBeouf is painful; there's no way on earth this wimp can appear plausible to Winnie Gekko as a mate or to her invincibly rapacious father as a proteg&eacute;.The bigger deficit, however, is that Oliver Stone wants his film to be box-office. Or so it seems, which would imply that he's finally succumbed to greed himself. Or should we assume that the film is postmodernist self-reference? It's a 'hostile' takeover, a razor-keen satire of the Wall Street culture that is still dazzling/blinding America, packaged like a bad mortgage inside a feel-good love story. Did Milton let Lucifer get to Heaven after all? Did Moby Dick spit Ahab up on Tahiti? Gordon Gekko having a change of heart, he who has no heart, after watching the ultrasound of a fetus? Gimme a break!But, as I said, there are assets. There's a wealth of truth in Gekko's hypocrisy, explicit in his sermons to Jake and others, denouncing the ""game"" of getting rich. And it's the very truth that Oliver Stone wants Americans to hear, even if he needs to sugarcoat it in yuppy-puppy love.

There is so little story to tell throughout this 134 minute endless mess of a film that the viewers must resort to just ignoring the fact that we are being drowned in WallStreetSpeak and settle instead for watching the skills of such fine actors as Michael Douglas, Carey Mulligan, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Susan Sarandon (for a brief moment), Eli Wallach, and Frank Langella  (one wonders why they ever signed on to this film if they read the script).Perhaps it is the current economic climate that makes it difficult to find any humor or concern for these characters crippled by the recession: there are no redeeming outcomes form the crash that would suggest that anyone involved with Big Money learned a thing form the government bailout of Wall Street.  But watching the prison release of Gordon Gekko (Douglas) and discovering that his angry, unforgiving daughter Winnie (Mulligan) has taken up with a bright lad Jake (LaBeouf) who in many ways is like the father she loathes, then in a smarmy manner climbing back into the money game only to destroy any seed of conscience that might have grown from his incarceration and in doing so drive a wedge between Winnie and Jake is hardly the stuff of which memorable movies are made.

The sequel still has a lot to say about the world as such and finance capitalism in specific, but it is far too didactic to be impressive. The story has too many sub-plots, it is less a straight tale than a collection of snippets.The film is essentially about the Lehman-like bank crash and following events towards a world crisis. Stone has this time not succeeded in creating an iconic figure like Gordon Gekko who symbolized 'greed' in the Reagan years. The only fully convincing bad guy here is Eli Wallach, who deserves a best supporting Oscar for the meanest ugliest evilest barracuda of the millennium, but unfortunately his part is a minor one.The old Gekko shows up again and is involved in the tale, but not on the same powerful level as Michael Douglas 25 years ago. Yes, he is a plot driver, but he is not a screen dominator as he was before.There is far too much voice from the off too, mostly (or all?) by Shia La Beuf, or whatever way you spell that.

1390377,A330XFRJKS3APU,B004A2AN56,Igor Biryukov,"[0, 0]","I loved the film, the cinematography, and the music score. But I think it is not as a heavy weight as the original Wall Street film in the realm of ideas. But in the world we are living today, a cautionary tale about dangers of moneymaking on insider information is no longer valid. Today, a spread of the global communications, rise of derivative instruments - futures, options, and swaps - made it a mundane thing for the investment banks and hedge funds to gamble on information. That's why the Stone's sequel isn't about using insider information; rather it's about using disinformation and profiting from it.The first film was a film of ideas: it was an age-old story of Faust retold. The Wall Street Mephistopheles, the Grand Seducer by name Gordon Gekko made young trader Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen during his more coherent years) do immoral things for profit and for the sake of power. Fox paid the price (imprisonment), and in the end he redeemed himself. The villain's darkness helped to illuminate the important things that had been obscure to Bud Fox in the beginning.This sequel, while still good and filmed with quirky zoom-in and zoom-out camera, nevertheless doesn't position itself as a Foust-like tragedy. As a critique of the American capitalism, it is tongue-in-cheek. The Brolin's character (CEO of the evil investment bank Churchill Schwartz, a veiled portrait of Goldman Sachs) is not a real villain. He is like George W. Bush (Brolin's previous role) - firm, combative, but insecure, one-sided and vengeful. Also, there is no Gretchen he can offer. Brolin isn't a villain of the Gekko a la 1987 caliber. Where is the villain? It is not Brolin, not aging Gekko 2010, not Churchill Schwartz, not even capitalist system per se.I think the real villain is missing - what Stone wanted but failed to flesh out is a deformed capitalism which has so far captured the U.S. - a laissez faire-ish financial capitalism based on ideas of neo-liberal Chicago-school economics. It was sold to the American ruling class who thought that the progressive social agenda could be piggybacked to the deregulated markets espoused by that type of capitalism. Obama has changed nothing - his economic policies are being shaped by the same people - many of them with close links to Wall Street (like Tim Geithner, N.Y. Fed President at a time - also a personage in the film). These people helped to dismantled Roosevelt's curbs on the banking system during the Clinton era. In the end, Stone shouldn't lament that the American politics have been captured by a financial oligarchy. After all, why we would be watching his movies if this weren't the case?As for me, I think the situation is far more radical and we all are already living in the simulated world of dystopian Matrix, a simulacra, surrounded by a digital rain of symbols and signs, meaningless, but all-pervasive.

1390387,A2YRWE73IZYN0P,B004A2AN56,John F. Jamele,"[8, 11]","I have to hand it to Oliver Stone; it takes real talent to create a film with absolutely zero sympathetic characters- in fact, each character is more pathetic and unlikeable than the one before....1. Winnie Gekko- spends the entire film in a self-absorbed, self-pitying pout, simpering about how her father is responsible for All That Is Bad and complaining that her fiancee needs to ""make a difference""- what does she do?  Write for some blog.In the very first scene, she tells LeBouf to turn off the tv because her father is on it. When he doesn't instantly comply, she breaks the remote- then announces ""I'm taking a shower.""  Umm, why didn't you just go do that, and let him watch what he wanted? Later, she'll whine over dinner, whine over her massive engagement ring, whine that her father is responsible for the suicide of her brother,* whine whine...ugh, I kept wishing LeBouf would walk away. Why is she with him?  (Oh, and she ""doesn't care about money"" knowing damn well she's got $100 mil waiting for her when she hits 25.  Hey, I can totally relate, lady.  Really.)2.LeBouf's character- gets a $1.45 million bonus and instantly spends a third of it on a rock.  Hey, remember that energy company in desperate need of money? Ever consider that might be a better investment, doofus?  Then he insists on pushing Winnie and her dad together- why?3. Gordon Gekko- introduced telling a cliche-ridden, ponderous lecture.  Whatever.  Later he tells LeBouf that Lou's suicide was ""honorable.""  Lou had an adoring wife, a townhouse, more money than he could ever begin to spend, we can assume grown children and grandchildren, but kills himself because at 75 he can't manipulate money any more.  I wonder how much of his fortune he left to the thousands of loyal former employees?  Now that would have been honorable.4. Eli Wallach's character- seems to exist because Stone needed a dessicated zombie in a suit to spit out four lines and make stupid whistling sounds while gesturing with one hand.  What the hell was that?5. Josh Brolin's character- as pointed out in a previous review, this guy looks like he should be sitting in a fake volcano petting a cat, planning to nuke the world's economy with a laser satellite.  Too much.  On the other hand, I can't see what makes him a villain- he started a rumor?  Yeah? So?  LeBouf's character does the same thing in revenge.  Is he going to jail at the end too?6.  The insipid green energy scientist- seriously, buddy, shut up.  I'm as green as they come, and I started to wish an oil slick would engulf your laboratory.7.  Cameos by Bud Fox and the relator from the original film- as if ""Wall Street"" wasn't already desperately referenced enough before that, with the terrible Talking Heads-lite soundtrack and an awkward ""remember Blue Star?"" conversation between Douglas and LeBouf.  Talk about wrecking the message of the first film- see, Bud didn't learn the lesson that money isn't everything after all!  He came out of jail, went right back into wheeling and dealing, and got rich!  Jeesh, this would be like a sequel to ""A Christmas Carol"" in which Scrooge is a miserly, bitter, lonely old man again.  What WAS the point of the first film again?8. Susan Sarandon as house-flipper; Sarandon clearly decided to simply embrace every cliche'd image everyone has of realtors, down to the waving cigarette and fast talk.  After all, she's got maybe two minutes of screen time- why put in any work at all?9.  The non-plot: Is it about green energy?  Not at all.  Is it about father-daughter relationships? Hardly.  Is it about Wall Street, Greed?  Not that I could follow.  Is it about the power of rumors in the internet age?  Well, that might make a little sense, but it's so exaggerated, what's the point?  A sequel 20 years in the making which, in the end, was simply not worth the time.*Winnie can't bear to be with her dad even for a few seconds over dinner, and when she doesn't get his absolutely undivided attention, she throws a fit and walks out.  Maybe someone should tell her that the only reason Rudy committed suicide was because his name is mentioned in the original Wall Street movie and Stone felt he had to explain his absence from the sequel, plus he needed a reason for Winnie to hate her dad.

I'm not saying it's a bad film in general terms. It just doesn't live up to the original and lacks some creativity.The thing I came away from Money Never Sleeps thinking was that it lacked the edge of the original. Shia Labeouf does not have anywhere near the same kind of screen presence as Charlie Sheen did (Bud Fox makes a brief appearance in the sequel, by the way), leaving the direct inter-personal conflicts which feature in the story - verbal as they may be - less impactful. And the lack of one strong antagonist character (Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko sometimes is one, sometimes isn't) tends to diffuse the tension.In terms of the story, if you've read much about the history of the financial crisis - especially On the Brink, by Hank Paulson - you will see a very strong similarity in the early parts of Money Never Sleeps. There's also a firm that is portrayed very much in the way Goldman Sachs was portrayed in recent years. To top it all off, Gekko has very John Paulson-like success in the markets.I do think the new film does a pretty good job reflecting how information moves around these days. Blogs, instant messaging, and the like feature along side the traditional phone and in-person interaction. Overall, though, I'd give it a middling rating.

1390390,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B004A2AN56,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[4, 6]","I can't think of a single thing to recommend about this movie.  The original ""Wall Street"" plays like Shakespeare compared to this unnecessary sequel.There really isn't a compelling story to tell in this movie. It's a revenge story with no bite.  It's an economic cautionary tale that bores the viewer instead of grabbing him by the throat.Director Oliver Stone couldn't help but to give a few winks to his original ""Wall Street"" film by bringing back a couple of characters from that film for cameo appearances in this one. I suppose it was meant to be sort of a cute gift for the audience but it really doesn't do anything but distract from the present storyline, uninvolving though it may be.Shia LeBoeuf is sorely miscast here -- he doesn't have the masculine heft to look like anything other than a high-school kid wearing a grown-up's clothes.  Attempts to ""butch him up"" -- such as the scenes where he confronts a business rival, tears through the countryside on a motorcycle, or tries to play the romantic lead against co-star Carey Mulligan -- fall flat.  They aren't as laughably absurd as when Steven Spielberg dressed him up to emulate Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"" for his introductory moment in the last ""Indiana Jones"" film, but it comes dangerously close.In a nod towards the song by Talking Heads that played in ""Wall Street"" (and repeats here), Oliver Stone enlisted Talking Heads singer David Byrne to contribute a handful of songs for this movie, and Stone manages to shoehorn about a half-dozen of them into this film in very awkward fashion.  Stone also manages to sneak in some product placement for Heineken Beer in equally unsubtle fashion.Many of the background extras know they are on camera and over-act.  And during a scene at a fancy dinner and ball the extras are all dancing in different rhythm and in an inappropriate style to a waltz (the music for which was probably added in post-production:  it is doubtful that any music was played back for the extras during the actual shooting of the scene).Remember Gordon Gekko's ""Greed is good"" speech from the first film?  He gets another speech in this film too, and he plays it to a roomful of college students who laugh and applaud a little too enthusiastically at moments that don't merit that kind of response.  Chalk that up to Stone and/or the editor trying to ""juice up"" an otherwise uninspiring and unmemorable scene.  [And if I can be a little picky about that ""Greed is good"" speech from the 1987 film:  the original line was ""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good"".  TECHNICALLY, it should have been ""Greed is, for lack of a better word, good.""  Note the different placement of the word ""is"".  If the descriptive qualifier phrase ""for lack of a better word"" is placed after the word ""greed"" and before the verb, then the phrase is -- syntax-wse -- referring to the word ""greed""  (as in he used the word ""greed"" because he lacked for a better word).  By moving that phrase AFTER the word ""is"", it then is in reference to the word ""good"", as was the intended meaning.  The whole point of that oft-quoted line is that Gekko was indicating that he deemed greed to be ""good"" because he lacked for a more appropriate word than ""good"" to describe greed.]Back to the sequel:Oliver Stone has often employed some visual playfulness in both his camerawork and design.  The first third or half of the film features a lot of those attention-seeking visual histrionics, then he backs off of it for most of the rest of the film, then tosses one or two more in near the end.  Because of that inconsistency of style, it draws even more attention to itself.  It's as if he didn't have a coherent or consistent tone in mind for the film's look.  And when the film briefly switches locales to Zurich, the insert title on the screen shows ""Zurich, Switzerland"".  Oh, THAT Zurich!  And late in the film the location switches to London, and we are treated to a shot of the London Bridge and an insert title that says ""London, England"".  Oh, THAT London!  Thanks for the geography tutorial, Oliver.  And by the way, I really AM smarter than a fifth-grader:  I could have figured out Switzerland and England all by myself, thank you.The film also features one of the most overused and eye-rolling cliches in all of film -- the female lead delivering the news of her pregnancy at the most inopportune time for the baby's father to have to deal with it.  YAWN!The film carries two storylines -- the relationship complications between the two young leads and Michael Douglas's character, and the grossly oversimplified morality tale of the unethical practices that lead to our recent economic meltdown.  Neither story is terribly interesting, despite the latter being extremely relevant to real life.Susan Sarandon appears briefly as Shia's mom, and sports a thick regional accent that borders on parody.As for Michael Douglas, he's looking more and more like his father Kirk now.  And you'd have to blind not to notice his obvious dentures.This movie has a tame and uninteresting business story, a bland love story, too many moments of forced sentimentality, and Shia LeBoeuf trying unsuccessfully to be a credible movie-idol leading man.  Worst of all, NONE of the elements that made the original ""Wall Street"" a decently compelling tale of betrayal seem to work here.Don't buy it.  Don't rent it.  Let it sink down into oblivion where it belongs.  ""Money Never Sleeps"" should be put to rest.**  I will admit to liking one particular line of dialogue from the film:  Gordon Gekko leans across a table to whisper to a heated and crooked rival of his and says, ""If you stop telling lies about me, I'll stop telling the truth about you!""  I'll probably steal that line one day.",2,"Tedious, cliche-ridden, uninvolving, miscast, and possibly Stone's worst film",1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,5743,"['ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single',

While I usually don't mind following multiple plots in a movie, these plots felt forced together.I felt the acting was ok, overall.  Douglas doesn't miss a beat stepping back into the role of Gecko, and Frank Langella does a nice job in a small role.  Shia LeBouf was ok-I don't think he detracted from the movie, but he didn't add anything to it.  Carey Mulligan, on the other hand did not do well as Gecko's daugther, although she wasn't given much to work with from the script.  Susan Sarandon's cameo was pointless, although I did enjoy Charlie Sheen's short cameo.

1390393,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B004A2AN56,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[7, 9]","Here's how I know ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" is riveting--my Restless Leg Syndrome never bothered me during the film, no, not once. My attention was totally focused for the duration. Normally, during the evening I have to get up frequently and walk around to prevent wild kicking. During the film I didn't even know I had legs.I've read a number of reviews here at Amazon of this ""Wall Street"" and do not understand the negativity. One reviewer lists a cacophony of his (often amusing) reasons for disliking the film. I thought, Gee, I saw the same film, yet I was riveted. What's more, I'm not the only one who was. Two other reviewers--Wall Streeters themselves--found the film accurate and coincidental with the truth found on Wall Street.In response here are my reasons for labeling this Wall Street riveting:1. Truth: Director Oliver Stone was getting at Truth. What is it? How do we find it? And, most importantly, where? Do we find it in our relationships with our significant others? With our blood relatives? At work? Just what is truth? Is truth true one day and then changes the next? Does truth change with the weather, with conditions on Wall Street?2. Relationships: What is the basis for relationships? Do these change? If they do, why? If they don't, why not?3. Conspiracy theory: Here Stone has his most fun. Famous for being ""edgy,"" Stone has long espoused belief in conspiracy theories (and been laughed at for same). With Wall Street he found his mother lode because there is found the biggest conspiracy of all: Bankers vs the helpless, defenseless, average American who (like me) knows hardly anything about the workings and behind-the-scene actions of Wall Streeters at various levels. Josh Brolin's character makes millions at the expense of the said American.4. Education: Stone has delivered an attack on the specific people responsible for the devaluing of Wall Street just a couple of years ago. Those working for them were shown compassion and pardon.5. Character: What makes good character and flawed character? Or do we wear both sides of character simultaneously and operate at various levels depending on the circumstance? Is anyone immune from flawed character?6. The Game: Gecko (Douglas) refers to the game behind Wall Street and is, in essence, revealing addiction. Gecko and Josh Brolin's character are addicted to the rush of the game. Both insist money is not the end: it's only a by-product.7. Punishment: Is evil punished? The actions of bad character? On the other hand, is good character rewarded? Stone emphatically answers both questions.8. Revenge: Is it ever an acceptable motive for behavior, a question which introduces the issue of character.My list introduces all the major themes of the film (except alternative energy which is Stone's real reason for creating the film: to promote this issue). He answers all of my questions through plot and character revelation and development. I would love to take each item and flesh it out, but I would give major spoilers. The moviegoer should find the answers for him/herself.As for the actors, each is perfectly cast. Shia LaBoeuf is not my favorite actor, but his intensity and perfect pitch in each role is astounding. Here he absolutely floored me with each portrayal of a new emotion. How he deals with his mother and his reaction to the breakup are beautifully done. Michael Douglas portrays each level of truth mentioned in my list. I believed both versions. (Note: One reviewer questions his reaction to what he sees on the DVD. My response is to examine the potential relationship. A man wants this!) Carey Mulligan was also superb as the daughter/fiancee.The voice-over narration about evolution, about man's appearance on this earth and the practical impossibility of it. Why was that included twice (at least)? It is in responding to this information that Stone reveals his truth. Man is both good--that impossibility happening and the creature that appears--and flawed--that impossibility happening and the creature that appears. Each character represents a different level of this truth.For these reasons, I keep my stand: ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" is a riveting film which I plan to watch again.",5,Riveting!,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,4219,"['Here', 'how', 'know', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'riveting', 'Restless', 'Leg', 'Syndrome', 'never', 'bothered', 'film', 'not', 'once', 'attention', 'was', 'totally', 'focused', 'duration', 'Normally', 'evening', 'have', 'get', 'up', 'frequently', 'walk', 'prevent', 'wild', 'kicking', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'had', 'legs.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'number', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Wall', 'Street', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'negativity', 'One', 'reviewer', 'cacophony', 'often', 'amusing', 'reasons', 'disliking', 'film', 'thought', 'Gee', 'saw', 'same', 'film', 'yet', 'was', 'riveted', 'What', 'more', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'Two', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Wall', 'Streeters', 'found', 'film', 'accurate', 'coincidental', 'truth', 'found', 'Wall', 'Street.In', 'response', 'here', 'are', 'reasons', 'labeling', 'Wall', 'Street', 'riveting:1', 'Truth', 'Director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'was', 'getting', 'Truth', 'What', 'How', 'do', 'find', 'most', 'importantly', 'where', 'Do', 'find', 'relationships', 'significant', 'others', 'blood', 'relatives', 'work', 'Just', 'what', 'truth', 'truth', 'true', 'one', 'day', 'then', 'next', 'Does', 'truth', 'change', 'weather', 'conditions', 'Wall', 'Street', '2', 'Relationships', 'What', 'basis', 'relationships', 'Do', 'change', 'do', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'why', 'not', '3', 'Conspiracy', 'theory', 'Here', 'Stone', 'most', 'fun', 'Famous', 'being', 'edgy', 'Stone', 'long', 'espoused', 'belief', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'been', 'laughed', 'same', 'Wall', 'Street', 'found', 'mother', 'lode', 'found', 'biggest', 'conspiracy', 'Bankers', 'vs', 'helpless', 'defenseless', 'average', 'American', 'who', 'hardly', 'anything', 'workings', 'behind-the-scene', 'actions', 'Wall', 'Streeters', 'various', 'levels', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'character', 'millions', 'expense', 'said', 'American.4', 'Education', 'Stone', 'delivered', 'attack', 'specific', 'people', 'responsible', 'devaluing', 'Wall', 'Street', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'working', 'were', 'shown', 'compassion', 'pardon.5', 'Character', 'What', 'good', 'character', 'flawed', 'character', 'do', 'wear', 'sides', 'character', 'simultaneously', 'operate', 'various', 'levels', 'depending', 'circumstance', 'anyone', 'immune', 'flawed', 'character', '6', 'Game', 'Gecko', 'Douglas', 'refers', 'game', 'Wall', 'Street', 'essence', 'revealing', 'addiction', 'Gecko', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'character', 'are', 'addicted', 'rush', 'game', 'insist', 'money', 'not', 'end', 'only', 'by-product.7', 'Punishment', 'evil', 'punished', 'actions', 'bad', 'character', 'other', 'hand', 'good', 'character', 'rewarded', 'Stone', 'emphatically', 'questions.8', 'Revenge', 'ever', 'acceptable', 'motive', 'behavior', 'question', 'issue', 'character.My', 'list', 'introduces', 'major', 'themes', 'film', 'alternative', 'energy', 'Stone', 'real', 'reason', 'creating', 'film', 'promote', 'issue', 'questions', 'plot', 'character', 'revelation', 'development', 'would', 'love', 'take', 'item', 'flesh', 'out', 'would', 'give', 'major', 'spoilers', 'moviegoer', 'should', 'find', 'answers', 'him/herself.As', 'actors', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Shia', 'LaBoeuf', 'not', 'favorite', 'actor', 'intensity', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'role', 'astounding', 'Here', 'absolutely', 'floored', 'portrayal', 'new', 'emotion', 'How', 'mother', 'reaction', 'breakup', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'level', 'truth', 'mentioned', 'list', 'believed', 'versions', 'Note', 'One', 'reviewer', 'questions', 'reaction', 'what', 'DVD', 'response', 'examine', 'potential', 'relationship', 'man', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'was', 'also', 'superb', 'daughter/fiancee.The', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'evolution', 'man', 'appearance', 'earth', 'practical', 'impossibility', 'Why', 'was', 'included', 'twice', 'least', 'responding', 'information', 'Stone', 'truth', 'Man', 'good', 'impossibility', 'happening', 'creature', 'flawed', 'impossibility', 'happening', 'creature', 'character', 'different', 'level', 'truth.For', 'reasons', 'keep', 'stand', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'riveting', 'film', 'plan', 'watch', 'again']",N/A
1390394,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B004A2AN56,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","It has been over 20 years since director Oliver Stone's original hit ""Wall Street"" garnered actor Michael Douglas an Academy Award win and made the phrase ""Greed is good"" a pop culture staple. In late 2010, Oliver Stone reunited with Michael Douglas to give fans of the original film what they've been waiting to see for years... a sequel.""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" begins as Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is finally released from prison for insider trading. During his time away from the outside world, Gordon's daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), has severed all ties to her illustrious father and attempted to live her life free from his shadow. By her side is her fianc&eacute;, Jake (Shia LaBeouf), himself a Wall Street trader, who believes that perhaps the best thing for Winnie is to reconnect with her father. With so much time lost, Gordon sets his mind to bonding with his daughter, but also reclaiming the vast financial empire that was once his to rule, no matter the cost.So, after nearly 25 years have gone by as ardent fans have waited for the continuing story of Gordon Gekko; was this particular sequel worth the wait or even necessary for that matter? If you ask me, I would have to say, ""Not at all.""""Why,"" you ask? Well, there are several reasons that I felt this movie wasn't worth the wait, and I shall get to those in a moment. As for the second part of the question, that I can answer right now.Simply put, even if this film had been strong enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its predecessor, a task which could have been accomplished, it still would have been unnecessary.Reason being, the story of Gordon Gekko was finished when he was sentenced to prison. The original movie gave the audience plenty of insight into his character, and personally, there didn't seem to be anything further to explore. This was a sequel made for the sole purpose of cashing in on the still surprisingly strong popularity of this villainous Wall Street tycoon and the current financial crisis.As for what made the movie not worth the wait; for starters, the story written by Allan Loeb (""21"") and Stephen Schiff (""True Crime"") is surprisingly uncomplicated, completely derivative, and utterly weak.First off, an uncomplicated story isn't necessarily a bad thing. In some cases there are movies that could have been incredible had the writer and/or director reined in the proceedings a bit more. However, when you compare the richness, the detail, and multiple layers inherent in the original ""Wall Street""; well, a much simpler story seems almost insulting by comparison.Then there is the primary driving force behind this film's plot...revenge. While not a bad motivator for character's within a story, it can result in some undue predictability seeping into the mix. Sadly, this proved to be the case here, because it seemed as if every single major player in the film (aside from Winnie) had some vengeance kick they were on for one reason or another. After a while, this overuse of one single theme began to make almost every aspect of this film, from the characters to the dialogue to the story itself, feel extremely uninspired.Also, we have the complete lack of subtlety on behalf of director Oliver Stone. For a man as experienced in the art of filmmaking, one would have thought that he would have figured out how to be subtle. But, one would be wrong. This shortcoming is most prominently featured in his use of kids playing with bubbles to symbolize all of the ""bubbles"" (or trends) that occur in the stock market.Symbolism can be a useful and extremely helpful dramatic tool when properly utilized. However, when the same symbolism is used repeatedly within the same movie it moves beyond being a creative visual aide to being annoyingly clich&eacute;d and above all, insulting to the viewer.By the final use of bubbles in the movie, I really felt like Oliver Stone thought his audience would be too weak-minded to fully grasp what he was trying to convey within the story; hence, the need for such blatantly obvious visual aides. Well, I for one understood perfectly what the story was talking about (without the aides, I might add), and found the over-used symbolism to be unnecessary and ultimately patronizing.Another area in which the story felt weak was in its inclusion of the 2008 market crash. Many people, myself included, figured Oliver Stone would have used this movie as an attempt to analyze/attack Wall Street and the banking industry after the collapse of 2008. After all, when has Oliver passed up an opportunity (aside from ""World Trade Center"") to inject his own politics and theories into a film?However, nothing of the sort ever really occurs. Surprisingly, Oliver Stone never really delves into the details surrounding the market crash. Basically, the whole fiasco was dealt with in a manner befitting a fairly minor plot point in the movie.Even from my perspective as a guy who grows tired of Oliver's political and conspiratorial soapboxes found in many of his films; I expected more from such a provocative director. In this regard, the movie felt lazy and uninterested in actually dealing with any of the serious issues surrounding its plot.Despite the issues that plagued this film's story, some members of this talented cast did their level best to elevate the movie beyond its meager standing. The two headliners for the film were the increasingly popular Shia LaBeouf (""Transformers"") and returning star Michael Douglas.Actor Shia LaBeouf delivers a solid performance as Jake, a young up-and-comer on Wall Street and potential prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Gordon Gekko. Shia proves that he is more than capable of handling strictly dramatic material and that he doesn't always need to be delivering witty zingers amidst giant talking robots.Veteran actor Michael Douglas is perfectly conniving and underhanded, yet charismatic as ever in the role of Gordon Gekko. Despite the over twenty year sabbatical from this character, Michael brings Gordon back without missing a beat and delivers another great performance. It's just too bad that this return appearance had to occur in such a misfire of a sequel.Speaking of misfires what was the point of Charlie Sheen's useless cameo? I understand that Oliver wanted to let fans see what Bud Fox was doing these days, but couldn't his appearance have felt a little less shoe-horned in? Not to mention, the cameo did nothing to really serve the story other than provide a moment of awkwardness for Gordon. In fact, it just further cemented the pointless nature of this sequel.Anyway, back to the regular cast for this film. Actress Carey Mulligan (""An Education"") was good in the role of Gordon's estranged daughter, Winnie. My only complaint for her was that she wasn't really given all that much to do other than throw a few mini fits every time she caught a glimpse of her father (understandable given their history) or cry about everything. She's a talented actress for sure, but this role was wasted on her.Lastly, in the remaining supporting roles are Josh Brolin (""No Country for Old Men"") and Frank Langella (""Superman Returns""). Josh had to have been pleased to work on this film, or any film for that matter with some semblance of a cohesive story, after the ""Jonah Hex"" debacle. Even so, his character here is nothing more than your standard shady political type, and Brolin never really commits enough to the role to improve upon it.As for Frank Langella, his role as Jake's mentor/father figure was essentially an over-glorified cameo appearance. Certainly his character holds significant influence over Jake for the entire movie, but Frank was not given all that much to do in front of the camera. Just like Carey Mulligan, Frank was just another bit of wasted casting in the film and further proof of the vast amount of potential that this movie squandered in the end.In closing, after more than twenty years of fans waiting patiently had finally paid off, the end result was barely an average movie that is nowhere near as entertaining or engaging as its predecessor.""Wall Street: Money Never

1390395,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B004A2AN56,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[6, 9]","It's rare when a sequel can be said to be better than the original, but I think Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is better than its 1998 progenitor Wall Street. Money Never Sleeps is a much more subtly complex movie than Wall Street. It seems almost a masters class in filmmaking.Wall Street was misunderstood everybody took the Gordon Gekko ""greed is good"" speech as an endorsement or as a cheerleader for that philosophy without paying attention to the real message of the movie. This time I don't think director Oliver Stone is taking any chances on being misunderstood.Michael Douglas reprises his role as Gordon Gekko fresh out prison for his insider trading sins. He's a man without a country, no one is there to meet him, he has legendary status in the trading world but he's forgotten by the real players in the game, and his family is either dead or estranged. Shia LaBeouf is his soon to be son-in-law Jake Moore, a Wall Street trader who is more successful and idealistic than Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) was in the original. After LaBeouf's company is burned by the greedy Bretton James (Josh Brolin) and his father figure mentor Frank Langella commits suicide, he seeks out Gekko. In Wall Street, Gekko was Faust showing Sheen's Bud Fox the world's treasures and the ways to possess them. In Money Never Sleeps, Gekko is more a guide to the labyrinth, but we're also not sure if Gekko may be the devil himself. There are twists and turns of changing fortune as all the players seek to out maneuver each other.Stone's direction isn't as ham-handed and over the top as before, it's subtle. He still employs a lot of technique such as how he illustrates the ephemeral nature of money, at least the sums involved here, how it isn't quite real, and to the players it's just a way to keep score. The performances Stone gets are excellent. Michael Douglas plays this on so many levels, as washed up has been that tries to elicit sympathy from his daughter and perspective son-in-law, to able guide, to the lizard that still is Gekko. Shia LaBeouf has at last turned in a performance justifying the promise of his earlier roles. Eli Wallach continues his comeback with his role as Jules Steinhardt an old shark that age is dulling but he still has some power left in his bite, which can also be said for Wallach's acting.There are a couple of minor missteps. The cameo of Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox almost comes off as campy, and may have been an inserted after thought of a scene. Susan Sarandon is almost criminally wasted as LaBeouf's mother, a role that because of Sarandon's presence should have been bigger or more important to the plot.Wall Street Money Never Sleeps is a tour through a cut-throat world few of us get to see up close, and fewer of us understand but Money Never Sleeps is a tour you'll be glad you made.DVD/Bonus Features: When the DVD becomes available, I'll edit the review to reflect what's included in the package.",5,Better Than The Original,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,2939,"['rare', 'when', 'sequel', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'better', 'original', 'think', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'better', '1998', 'progenitor', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'much', 'more', 'subtly', 'complex', 'movie', 'Wall', 'Street', 'almost', 'masters', 'class', 'filmmaking.Wall', 'Street', 'was', 'misunderstood', 'everybody', 'took', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'greed', 'good', 'speech', 'endorsement', 'cheerleader', 'philosophy', 'paying', 'attention', 'real', 'message', 'movie', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'taking', 'chances', 'being', 'misunderstood.Michael', 'Douglas', 'role', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'out', 'prison', 'insider', 'trading', 'sins', 'man', 'country', 'one', 'there', 'meet', 'legendary', 'status', 'trading', 'world', 'forgotten', 'real', 'players', 'game', 'family', 'either', 'dead', 'estranged', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'soon', 'be', 'son-in-law', 'Jake', 'Moore', 'Wall', 'Street', 'trader', 'who', 'more', 'successful', 'idealistic', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'was', 'original', 'LaBeouf', 'company', 'burned', 'greedy', 'Bretton', 'James', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'father', 'figure', 'mentor', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'commits', 'suicide', 'out', 'Gekko', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Gekko', 'was', 'Faust', 'showing', 'Sheen', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'world', 'treasures', 'ways', 'possess', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'Gekko', 'more', 'guide', 'labyrinth', ""'re"", 'also', 'not', 'sure', 'Gekko', 'may', 'be', 'devil', 'are', 'twists', 'turns', 'changing', 'fortune', 'players', 'seek', 'out', 'maneuver', 'other.Stone', 'direction', ""n't"", 'ham-handed', 'top', 'before', 'subtle', 'still', 'lot', 'technique', 'such', 'how', 'ephemeral', 'nature', 'money', 'least', 'sums', 'involved', 'here', 'how', ""n't"", 'quite', 'real', 'players', 'just', 'way', 'keep', 'score', 'performances', 'Stone', 'are', 'excellent', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'washed', 'up', 'been', 'elicit', 'sympathy', 'daughter', 'perspective', 'son-in-law', 'able', 'guide', 'lizard', 'still', 'Gekko', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'last', 'turned', 'performance', 'justifying', 'promise', 'earlier', 'roles', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'comeback', 'role', 'Jules', 'Steinhardt', 'old', 'shark', 'age', 'dulling', 'still', 'power', 'left', 'bite', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'Wallach', 'are', 'couple', 'minor', 'missteps', 'cameo', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'almost', 'off', 'campy', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'inserted', 'thought', 'scene', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'almost', 'criminally', 'wasted', 'LaBeouf', 'mother', 'role', 'Sarandon', 'presence', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'bigger', 'more', 'important', 'plot.Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'tour', 'cut-throat', 'world', 'few', 'get', 'see', 'up', 'close', 'fewer', 'understand', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'tour', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'made.DVD/Bonus', 'Features', 'When', 'DVD', 'available', ""'ll"", 'edit', 'review', 'reflect', 'what', 'included', 'package']",N/A

Her boyfriend is a Wall Street analyst and is pretty good with alternative energy investments.  Wanting to help father and daughter resolve their differences, he steps in between them.  In doing so, he gets to know daddy a lot better.Within the story, you meet LaBeouf's former boss (Frank Langella), who is no longer at the top of his game.  You also meet Brolin's son, a stop-at-nothing billionaire investment firm owner.  Even Eli Wallace (The Good, Bad and the Ugly/The Godfather/many other films) has a part in the world of money as an aged mentor to the big money guys.Although I didn't understand a lot of the investment terminology, it didn't really matter.

1390397,A17DCPYMLXV1S4,B004A2AN56,Kay Shackleton,"[10, 15]","Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, the highly anticipated sequel to Oliver Stone's Wall Street from 1987, opened this weekend. If you are a fan of the original film, you may be wondering what Gordon Gekko, the ultimate antihero, would think of the crisis Wall Street has been going through and how he would have fared in such a market.The story opens in the year 2001 when Gordon (played by Michael Douglas) is released from prison with no fanfare or family to greet him. His only companion leaving prison is a prehistoric cell phone and a check for $1,800.00. Gordon writes a book that predicts a meltdown of the stock market due to sub-prime loans and the bets Wall Street companies were making against their own market. At one of his lectures, his future son-in-law just happens to be in the audience. His name is Jacob (played by Shia LaBeouf) and he has the hunger to beat Wall Street like his predecessor Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen's character in the first film).  Jacob introduces himself to Gordon and Gordon starts using Jacob's desires in order to be reacquainted with his daughter Winnie (played by Carrie Mulligan). He son Rudy, died of an overdose and Gordon states, ""She is all I have left."" Gordon's new mantra is ""time is everything"".At first you will think that Gordon has found redemption. He is making a modest income with his book profits and his main desire is to have a relationship with his daughter. Winnie shows only distrust for her father and warns Jacob to stay away from him. In the meantime, Jacob finds problems in his own work. First the company that he works for goes under and the owner, a father figure for Jacob, commits suicide. Jacob is in prime mode for some vengeance and Gordon seizes the opportunity for a little manipulation of his own.  Once Gordon starts ""playing the game"" again, he finds that he still a stellar player. But Gordon has no sense of boundaries and his desire for revenge fuels a non-stop ambition that takes prisoners at every step including Winnie and Jacob.The film moves well and the photography is reminiscent of the first film. All performances all well executed. But the ending of the film just ruins the entire film. The last scene of the film is so incongruent with the rest of the film, that it appears to be written and filmed by another crew. One of the best scenes from the original film is the ending as we see Bud Fox climbing the stairs of the court house to be sentenced to prison. It is an Iconic ending.  Oliver Stone missed a great opportunity to be honest and really send a message to the likes of Gordon Gekko.To see more of Kay Shackleton's reviews or film industry news see: [...]-Kay Shackleton is a film historian with focus on the Silent Film Era, see her work at [...]",3,Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps - Michael Douglas returns in his Iconic role,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,2750,"['Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'sequel', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Wall', 'Street', '1987', 'opened', 'weekend', 'are', 'fan', 'original', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'wondering', 'what', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'ultimate', 'antihero', 'would', 'think', 'crisis', 'Wall', 'Street', 'been', 'going', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'such', 'market.The', 'story', 'year', '2001', 'when', 'Gordon', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'released', 'prison', 'fanfare', 'family', 'greet', 'only', 'companion', 'leaving', 'prison', 'prehistoric', 'cell', 'phone', 'check', '1,800.00', 'Gordon', 'book', 'meltdown', 'stock', 'market', 'due', 'sub-prime', 'loans', 'bets', 'Wall', 'Street', 'companies', 'were', 'making', 'own', 'market', 'one', 'lectures', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'just', 'be', 'audience', 'name', 'Jacob', 'played', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'hunger', 'beat', 'Wall', 'Street', 'predecessor', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'character', 'first', 'film', 'Jacob', 'Gordon', 'Gordon', 'using', 'Jacob', 'desires', 'order', 'be', 'reacquainted', 'daughter', 'Winnie', 'played', 'Carrie', 'Mulligan', 'son', 'Rudy', 'died', 'overdose', 'Gordon', 'states', 'have', 'left', 'Gordon', 'new', 'mantra', 'time', 'everything', 'first', 'will', 'think', 'Gordon', 'found', 'redemption', 'making', 'modest', 'income', 'book', 'profits', 'main', 'desire', 'have', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Winnie', 'only', 'distrust', 'father', 'Jacob', 'stay', 'away', 'meantime', 'Jacob', 'problems', 'own', 'work', 'company', 'owner', 'father', 'figure', 'Jacob', 'suicide', 'Jacob', 'prime', 'mode', 'vengeance', 'Gordon', 'opportunity', 'little', 'manipulation', 'own', 'Once', 'Gordon', 'playing', 'game', 'again', 'still', 'stellar', 'player', 'Gordon', 'sense', 'boundaries', 'desire', 'revenge', 'fuels', 'non-stop', 'ambition', 'prisoners', 'step', 'including', 'Winnie', 'Jacob.The', 'film', 'moves', 'well', 'photography', 'reminiscent', 'first', 'film', 'performances', 'well', 'executed', 'ending', 'film', 'just', 'entire', 'film', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'so', 'incongruent', 'rest', 'film', 'be', 'written', 'filmed', 'crew', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'original', 'film', 'ending', 'see', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'climbing', 'stairs', 'court', 'house', 'be', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'Iconic', 'ending', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'missed', 'great', 'opportunity', 'be', 'honest', 'really', 'send', 'message', 'likes', 'Gordon', 'Gekko.To', 'see', 'more', 'Kay', 'Shackleton', 'reviews', 'film', 'industry', 'news', 'see', '[', ']', '-Kay', 'Shackleton', 'film', 'historian', 'focus', 'Silent', 'Film', 'Era', 'see', 'work', '[', ']']",N/A

Here's why:Poor storyline,Hated Shia and will never watch another movie with him in it again,The focus on the daughter who was not even in the first movie timeline. Plus she was crying or upset in every scene.The ending was terribly written to basically give you a hollywood ending.There was no dramatic suspense, tons of plot holes, and no character development.No moral of the story.Michael's performance was the only reason i didn't turn it off early.Plot twist example:Shia's mentor commits suicide due to the financial collapse of his company at the hands of a competitor. Shia gets some revenge by tanking the competitor's stock. What does the bad guy do? He offers Shia a job of course, then screws Shia over. Shia then goes to get revenge again. Seeing a pattern of trust, betrayal, revenge here? Because it is the same approach between Shia and the daughter, Shia and Gecko, Gecko and the daughter, Shia and his mentor, The mentor and the competitor, etc..To be honest, i am not going to waste more of my time reviewing this movie...it was that disappointing.

1390400,A356RFKNIG043B,B004A2AN56,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","3.7 starsThis film will be twice as entertaining for those who know investing, especially those who've worked on the Street and/or been traders, but those who haven't may find its various flaws debilitating. Stone can't be faulted for not putting his heart into this WS2, but he could have leaned on his editor and writers a little harder. The script has some sweet moments but also crams every investment chestnut in there that it can; I'm surprised they didn't end up saying, ""Buy low, sell high is the secret"", or have a character named Livermore. But those who haven't heard these maxims a thousand times will certainly enjoy the truths they contain, just as those who know the ego-driven world of Wall Street and Goldman Sachs will recognize many things here. Certainly former Lehman Brothers employees will find it all a bit too familiar.Sadly, as a movie it's a bit slipshod. Douglas is good again as Gekko, but writer Schiff gives him too many long speeches telling us what went wrong in the subprime debacle, without really making the information an integral part of the plot. That speechifying hurts, mainly because the speeches are so accurate and one wishes they'd been couched more thoroughly and believably. Langella looks scary these days, and does a nice job, as do most of the cast, though Shia is a bit lightweight in a number of ways. He's passable, but his part could have been knocked out of the park by a better choice.The main issue here is the plot, which has a few real holes, and makes little sense in terms of sending a message, and a message we all need to grok real fast at that. [Spoilers] Gekko steals 100 million from his daughter and turns it into a billion, then is some kind of nice guy for giving back the stolen seed capital? His daughter is so thinly drawn as to be gossamer, and the scenes between her and the others only really work when Douglas is around; he's acquired a fair bit of gravitas and blows the kids away. The veterans here hold their own, however, with Brolin doing a very nice turn, and his line, ""More!"" is perhaps the linchpin here. But some of the scenes in the Fed room miss a huge chance to show so much more of what really went on when our tax dollars were used to bail out the people who steal most of them anyhow. And the whole grandkid/family yearning from Gekko thing just doesn't feel authentic; chop it out and this film would have been lean and tight.Not as much fun as the first film, and a lot preachier, Wall Street is nonetheless a necessary cautionary tale from one of our few filmmakers with a real sense of how ugly things have become, and are likely to get again soon, as too few of the derivatives regulations have really been changed. Stone shot this nicely---it looks very good---but should have cut it much shorter, laid off the standard love story aspects, and really slammed Goldman Sachs to the ground, as they so richly deserve. They will soon bankrupt this country, along with our never-ending wars (which GS/the Street also does very well from), and while Stone ultimately says the right things here, the film lacks the edge it could have had.",4,Preachy but with a message well worth serious consideration,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,3129,"['3.7', 'starsThis', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'twice', 'entertaining', 'who', 'know', 'investing', 'especially', 'who', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'Street', 'and/or', 'been', 'traders', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'may', 'find', 'various', 'flaws', 'debilitating', 'Stone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'not', 'putting', 'heart', 'WS2', 'could', 'have', 'leaned', 'editor', 'writers', 'little', 'harder', 'script', 'sweet', 'moments', 'also', 'investment', 'chestnut', 'can', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'saying', 'Buy', 'low', 'sell', 'high', 'secret', 'have', 'character', 'named', 'Livermore', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'maxims', 'thousand', 'times', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'truths', 'contain', 'just', 'who', 'know', 'ego-driven', 'world', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Goldman', 'Sachs', 'will', 'recognize', 'many', 'things', 'here', 'Certainly', 'former', 'Lehman', 'Brothers', 'employees', 'will', 'find', 'bit', 'too', 'familiar.Sadly', 'movie', 'bit', 'slipshod', 'Douglas', 'good', 'again', 'Gekko', 'writer', 'Schiff', 'too', 'many', 'long', 'speeches', 'telling', 'went', 'wrong', 'subprime', 'debacle', 'really', 'making', 'information', 'integral', 'part', 'plot', 'speechifying', 'hurts', 'mainly', 'speeches', 'are', 'so', 'accurate', 'one', ""'d"", 'been', 'couched', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'believably', 'Langella', 'scary', 'days', 'nice', 'job', 'do', 'most', 'cast', 'Shia', 'bit', 'lightweight', 'number', 'ways', 'passable', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'knocked', 'park', 'better', 'choice.The', 'main', 'issue', 'here', 'plot', 'few', 'real', 'holes', 'little', 'sense', 'terms', 'sending', 'message', 'message', 'need', 'grok', 'real', 'fast', '[', 'Spoilers', ']', 'Gekko', 'steals', '100', 'million', 'daughter', 'billion', 'then', 'kind', 'nice', 'guy', 'giving', 'back', 'stolen', 'seed', 'capital', 'daughter', 'so', 'thinly', 'drawn', 'be', 'gossamer', 'scenes', 'others', 'only', 'really', 'work', 'when', 'Douglas', 'around', 'acquired', 'fair', 'bit', 'gravitas', 'kids', 'away', 'veterans', 'here', 'hold', 'own', 'however', 'Brolin', 'doing', 'very', 'nice', 'turn', 'line', 'More', 'perhaps', 'linchpin', 'here', 'scenes', 'Fed', 'room', 'huge', 'chance', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'when', 'tax', 'dollars', 'were', 'used', 'bail', 'out', 'people', 'who', 'steal', 'most', 'anyhow', 'whole', 'grandkid/family', 'yearning', 'Gekko', 'thing', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'authentic', 'chop', 'out', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lean', 'tight.Not', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'first', 'film', 'lot', 'preachier', 'Wall', 'Street', 'nonetheless', 'necessary', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'one', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'real', 'sense', 'how', 'ugly', 'things', 'have', 'become', 'are', 'likely', 'get', 'again', 'soon', 'too', 'few', 'derivatives', 'regulations', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'changed', 'Stone', 'shot', 'nicely', '-it', 'looks', 'very', 'good', '-but', 'should', 'have', 'cut', 'much', 'shorter', 'laid', 'off', 'standard', 'love', 'story', 'aspects', 'really', 'slammed', 'Goldman', 'Sachs', 'ground', 'so', 'richly', 'deserve', 'will', 'soon', 'bankrupt', 'country', 'never-ending', 'wars', 'GS/the', 'Street', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'Stone', 'ultimately', 'right', 'things', 'here', 'film', 'edge', 'could', 'have', 'had']",N/A

That film ended with the powerful Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, going to jail.  And so this new film opens with the supposedly older and wiser Gordon Gekko now getting out.  Years have gone by but the man has not changed much and even though he professes that he has changed, the audience knows better.In this film, like the previous one, there is a young, smart and ambitious young man working in a Wall Street firm who is in the process of learning the tricks of the trade while watching the destruction of some of the older leaders who are losing their businesses because of worthless debt.  In a twist to the plot, he's also involved romantically with Gekko's daughter.  How this all plays out makes the film drag.  It's the money and the trading that is the most interesting, not a simple romance which has no surprises.Some of the casting is excellent, especially Eli Wallach who, at age 95, is perfect in his role as an aging Wall Street executive with a sense of honor. There are also some real life newscasters playing themselves.  In some ways the film feels as fresh as recent headlines.  But in other ways it just doesn't have the cutting edge that the previous film had.  There is also just too much dependence of special effects and computer graphics.  This kind of stuff might be nice but it just doesn't compare to a good script.Generally the acting was good, but Gekko having a change of heart just didn't seem in character for him.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[3, 3]","Originally I bought a ticket for another movie and did not see it because this movie turned out to be a lot better than I expected.Framed as a revenge movie, the inciting incident occurs when young idealist, and greed prone Wall Street trader, Jake Moore's mentor dies in a tragic way. Jake wants to get to the bottom of the mystery of why he died, and get justice for the mentor.He happens to be dating Gekko's estranged daughter, and so contrives to meet him, and that is where this cautionary tale begins. Michael Douglas has made a career out of playing flawed yet charismatic and engaging characters, ultimately steps in to fill the mentor void, and clearly Gekko's time in prison has given him wisdom, but has this particular leopard changed his spots. You get the awful sense that this idealistic yet naive young broker is swimming with sharks and may get eaten.Gekko, as his name suggests, is reptilian in nature, and as we know reptiles do not nurture their young or have emotions, and are cold blooded, and ruthless.I loved the image and the metaphor of someone blowing a huge bubble in the park.What I found particularly engaging about this movie were some of Gekko's soundbites.You stop lying about me. I'll stop telling the truth about you.Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered.The villain of the movie is Tretton played with much charisma by Josh Brolin.

For example Jake Moore spreads a rumor that causes Tretton to lose $128 million, and Tretton's response is to offer him a job with his organisation.I don't about you, but if some young idealistic broker flat out tells me that he blames me for his bosses death, and costs me that much money, I would not be offering him a job or going motorcycle riding with him.The contemporary side story of the housing market is developed, and part of the collapse at least can be attributed to Wall Street greed, and also more individual greed. Jake's mother, played by Susan Sarandon is a real estate agent who fixes and flips houses, and gets cuaght when the housing market turns.Like many people Jake is a paradox. He gets a huge bonus check and somehow loses it all, and later bails out his mother even though he himself is broke. This guy makes his living advising people how to invest, and then invests in margin on his own company's stock.Money never sleeps is ripped from the headlines and topical, because we are still in economic turmoil because of the excesses of Wall Street, and the banks, and all the frauds and the bailouts.What struck me most from from this movie is that we are all prone to the excess of greed, most of us want to be rich.I think Michael Douglas does an excellent job, which could easily have gotten another Oscar nomination, for this reprise of his Oscar winning role. I have a high respect for Oliver Stone, not merely as a director but also as a screenwriter, as here.I encourage you to see this movie, because you will realise that some of the people who offer you advice talk the talk, but don't walk the talk, and it might change your perceptions about how you manage your money, and who you get to manage it. That insight ultimately might be worth more to you than the modest price of seeing this movie or buying the dvd.Good judgment comes from experience, yet experience comes from bad judgment.I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",4,Greed is no longer good,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,3412,"['Originally', 'bought', 'ticket', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'expected.Framed', 'revenge', 'movie', 'inciting', 'incident', 'when', 'young', 'idealist', 'greed', 'prone', 'Wall', 'Street', 'trader', 'Jake', 'Moore', 'mentor', 'tragic', 'way', 'Jake', 'get', 'bottom', 'mystery', 'why', 'died', 'get', 'justice', 'mentor.He', 'be', 'dating', 'Gekko', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'so', 'contrives', 'meet', 'where', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'flawed', 'yet', 'charismatic', 'engaging', 'characters', 'ultimately', 'steps', 'fill', 'mentor', 'void', 'clearly', 'Gekko', 'time', 'prison', 'given', 'wisdom', 'particular', 'leopard', 'changed', 'spots', 'get', 'awful', 'sense', 'idealistic', 'yet', 'naive', 'young', 'broker', 'swimming', 'sharks', 'may', 'get', 'eaten.Gekko', 'name', 'reptilian', 'nature', 'know', 'reptiles', 'do', 'not', 'nurture', 'young', 'have', 'emotions', 'are', 'cold', 'blooded', 'loved', 'image', 'metaphor', 'someone', 'blowing', 'huge', 'bubble', 'park.What', 'found', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'movie', 'were', 'Gekko', 'soundbites.You', 'stop', 'lying', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'telling', 'truth', 'you.Bulls', 'make', 'money', 'Bears', 'make', 'money', 'Pigs', 'get', 'slaughtered.The', 'villain', 'movie', 'Tretton', 'played', 'much', 'charisma', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'plot', 'points', 'found', 'implausible', 'example', 'Jake', 'Moore', 'rumor', 'Tretton', 'lose', '128', 'million', 'Tretton', 'response', 'offer', 'job', 'organisation.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'young', 'idealistic', 'broker', 'out', 'tells', 'bosses', 'death', 'costs', 'much', 'money', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'offering', 'job', 'going', 'motorcycle', 'riding', 'him.The', 'contemporary', 'side', 'story', 'housing', 'market', 'developed', 'part', 'collapse', 'least', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'Wall', 'Street', 'greed', 'also', 'more', 'individual', 'greed', 'Jake', 'mother', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'fixes', 'flips', 'houses', 'cuaght', 'when', 'housing', 'market', 'many', 'people', 'Jake', 'paradox', 'huge', 'bonus', 'check', 'somehow', 'later', 'out', 'mother', 'even', 'broke', 'guy', 'living', 'advising', 'people', 'how', 'invest', 'then', 'invests', 'margin', 'own', 'company', 'stock.Money', 'never', 'ripped', 'headlines', 'topical', 'are', 'still', 'economic', 'turmoil', 'excesses', 'Wall', 'Street', 'banks', 'frauds', 'bailouts.What', 'struck', 'most', 'movie', 'are', 'prone', 'excess', 'greed', 'most', 'want', 'be', 'rich.I', 'think', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'excellent', 'job', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'reprise', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'have', 'high', 'respect', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'not', 'merely', 'director', 'also', 'screenwriter', 'here.I', 'encourage', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'realise', 'people', 'who', 'offer', 'advice', 'talk', 'talk', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'talk', 'might', 'change', 'perceptions', 'how', 'manage', 'money', 'who', 'get', 'manage', 'insight', 'ultimately', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'more', 'modest', 'price', 'seeing', 'movie', 'buying', 'dvd.Good', 'judgment', 'experience', 'experience', 'bad', 'judgment.I', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

1390408,AK9UPC78LIPIR,B004A2AN56,maelje,"[2, 2]","""Money Never Sleeps"" could have been fantastic. And the timing was perfect for director Oliver Stone to explore the changes that had occurred on Wall Street since the 1980s. Alas, the critics are right on this one. The financial meltdown of 2008 provides a great backdrop, but Stone manages to squander most of his opportunity.How? The main culprit is the weak script. All the Wall Street stuff crackles with energy, but the situation involving Winnie, Gordon Gekko's daughter, and her fiance and father just doesn't add up to much. Michael Douglas is excellent as usual, and really tries to sell the idea of Gekko as a man torn by his old lust for power and greed and his need to reconcile with the one family member he has left -- but I just didn't buy it, and that's the fault of the screenwriting, not the actor. Douglas exudes charm as always, and the scenes involving him getting out of prison are at once humorous and heartbreaking, but the film quickly loses steam.But there are mediocre performances, too. Shia Labeouf has all the tools he needs to make his character -- Winnie's fiance Jacob Moore -- a fascinating study, but for reasons I can't quite articulate, he doesn't quite pull it off. What is it with this young chap? He was truly marvelous in ""The Greatest Game Ever Played,"" but since then seems to have made a career of being underwhelming in some very big movies -- the fourth ""Indiana Jones,"" the ""Transformers"" series, and this. As for Carey Mulligan: She pulls out all the stops (and the tears) in her performance as Winnie, yet ultimately I found it very difficult to care about her.I still give the Blu-ray release three stars, though, because of the extras, which actually eclipse the movie in terms of quality. There's a lot of material here about the way Wall Street works ""then and now,"" and also a really fine little history of that area of Manhattan that was more gripping than just about anything else on the disc. Too bad the feature itself falls short -- but I got it used, and all in all I think I made a wise investment. ;)",3,"Likable enough, but not enough emotional depth",1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,2062,"['Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'timing', 'was', 'perfect', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'explore', 'changes', 'had', 'occurred', 'Wall', 'Street', '1980s', 'Alas', 'critics', 'are', 'right', 'one', 'financial', 'meltdown', '2008', 'great', 'backdrop', 'Stone', 'squander', 'most', 'opportunity.How', 'main', 'culprit', 'weak', 'script', 'Wall', 'Street', 'stuff', 'crackles', 'energy', 'situation', 'involving', 'Winnie', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'daughter', 'fiance', 'father', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'excellent', 'usual', 'really', 'sell', 'idea', 'Gekko', 'man', 'torn', 'old', 'lust', 'power', 'greed', 'need', 'reconcile', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'left', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'fault', 'screenwriting', 'not', 'actor', 'Douglas', 'charm', 'always', 'scenes', 'involving', 'getting', 'prison', 'are', 'once', 'humorous', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'quickly', 'steam.But', 'are', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'too', 'Shia', 'Labeouf', 'tools', 'make', 'character', 'Winnie', 'fiance', 'Jacob', 'Moore', 'fascinating', 'study', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'articulate', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'What', 'young', 'chap', 'was', 'truly', 'marvelous', 'Greatest', 'Game', 'Ever', 'Played', 'then', 'have', 'made', 'career', 'being', 'underwhelming', 'very', 'big', 'movies', 'fourth', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Transformers', 'series', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'out', 'stops', 'tears', 'performance', 'Winnie', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'found', 'very', 'difficult', 'care', 'her.I', 'still', 'give', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'three', 'stars', 'though', 'extras', 'actually', 'movie', 'terms', 'quality', 'lot', 'material', 'here', 'way', 'Wall', 'Street', 'then', 'now', 'also', 'really', 'fine', 'little', 'history', 'area', 'Manhattan', 'was', 'more', 'gripping', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'disc', 'Too', 'bad', 'feature', 'short', 'got', 'used', 'think', 'made', 'wise', 'investment']",N/A

This movies differs from the first one mainly in how much more it delves into the personal lives of some of the characters. This mostly involves the romance between Shia Le Boeuf's character and Gecko's daughter. It's a bit too much like ""Peyton Place"" meets ""Wall Street"" for my taste, and I think the original is still better.So overall, it's a solid three star movie but there is one thing I liked, which is the fact that Eli Wallach at age 94 (what a trooper!)  plays the old investment banker who still has ""old school"" integrity and mores and I give the movie credit just for giving him a decent role. Wallach has been one of the great character actors for over 65 years and many will fondly remember him from such roles such as ""the Ugly"" in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" but he also has many notable stage appearances especially (""The Rose Tattoo,"" ""Teahouse of the August Moon,"" ""Major Barbara,"" etc.) during his early years to his credit.

And the plot was somewhat original. This film, the second film, is pure explotation garbage with a very peculiar message of its own.The first flaw is that the script lectures rather than tells a story. Every point has to be hammered obsessively just in case we missed it. And in case anyone misses it, you can be sure it will be repeated shortly.The second flaw is that Oliver Stone's mind is gone. He lives in a world of shadows and conspiracies that cannot be named. The ties to realism in the first film are replaced with hints of the evil men who lurk in the shadows.The film might have been interesting if it had followed up with the Charlie Sheen character. But instead we get Shia Labeouf. If Stone wanted to dig into conspiracies, he might want to take a look into the improbable rise and never-ending push of an utterly terrible actor. Labeouf is a b-actor great for talking to giant robots that turn into cars or being a sidekick but a dramatic lead he is not. He is in over his head in the film.Labeouf is Gekko's new underling set up to be corrupted. The story is changed up in that Gekko has a grown daughter this time. And like most of Oliver Stone's women, she is the incorruptable voice of virtue. I found nothing positive in her character. She was another spoiled trust-fund baby talking a good game about virtue while she lives off the proceeds. The daughter is engaged to Labeouf which means lots of whiny boring scenes with her telling him that he should be moral.The overall message of this film is in some sense the opposite of Wall Street (the original). Greed is not just good, its moral and right. And not only is greed good, greed is the path to restoring your fortune and regaining the love of your estranged daughter. And you can always become a better person by investing the proceeds of greed in ""GREEN TECHNOLOGY"". In many ways, Stone turns Gekko into another victim. Its not Gekko's fault. Its the fault of the men in the shadows who killed JFK and run the government.And so we have a contradiction at the heart of the film. Greed is bad but it works. Gordon Gekko's greed makes him a billionaire grandfather of a happy family. Labeouf's greed makes him rich and solves all his problems. Gekko's daughter's greed gives her a happy carefree life.The ultimate message here would seem to be: ""Its good to be rich"" and that greed is a disease only of the poor. The poor need to know their place and leave the good life to the Gekko's of the world.",1,terrible,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,2597,"['first', 'wall', 'street', 'film', 'was', 'topical', 'reasonably', 'ok', 'message', 'picture', 'story', 'was', 'competent', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'plot', 'was', 'somewhat', 'original', 'film', 'second', 'film', 'pure', 'explotation', 'garbage', 'very', 'peculiar', 'message', 'own.The', 'first', 'flaw', 'script', 'rather', 'tells', 'story', 'point', 'be', 'hammered', 'obsessively', 'just', 'case', 'missed', 'case', 'anyone', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'repeated', 'shortly.The', 'second', 'flaw', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'mind', 'gone', 'world', 'shadows', 'conspiracies', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'named', 'ties', 'realism', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'replaced', 'hints', 'evil', 'men', 'who', 'lurk', 'shadows.The', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'had', 'followed', 'up', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'character', 'instead', 'get', 'Shia', 'Labeouf', 'Stone', 'wanted', 'dig', 'conspiracies', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'look', 'improbable', 'rise', 'never-ending', 'push', 'utterly', 'terrible', 'actor', 'Labeouf', 'b-actor', 'great', 'talking', 'giant', 'robots', 'turn', 'cars', 'being', 'sidekick', 'dramatic', 'lead', 'not', 'head', 'film.Labeouf', 'Gekko', 'new', 'underling', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'corrupted', 'story', 'changed', 'up', 'Gekko', 'grown', 'daughter', 'time', 'most', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'women', 'incorruptable', 'voice', 'virtue', 'found', 'nothing', 'positive', 'character', 'was', 'spoiled', 'trust-fund', 'baby', 'talking', 'good', 'game', 'virtue', 'proceeds', 'daughter', 'engaged', 'Labeouf', 'lots', 'whiny', 'boring', 'scenes', 'telling', 'should', 'be', 'moral.The', 'overall', 'message', 'film', 'sense', 'opposite', 'Wall', 'Street', 'original', 'Greed', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'moral', 'right', 'not', 'only', 'greed', 'good', 'greed', 'path', 'restoring', 'fortune', 'regaining', 'love', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'can', 'always', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'investing', 'proceeds', 'greed', 'GREEN', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'many', 'ways', 'Stone', 'Gekko', 'victim', 'not', 'Gekko', 'fault', 'fault', 'men', 'shadows', 'who', 'killed', 'JFK', 'run', 'government.And', 'have', 'contradiction', 'heart', 'film', 'Greed', 'bad', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'greed', 'billionaire', 'grandfather', 'happy', 'family', 'Labeouf', 'greed', 'rich', 'problems', 'Gekko', 'daughter', 'greed', 'happy', 'carefree', 'life.The', 'ultimate', 'message', 'here', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'good', 'be', 'rich', 'greed', 'disease', 'only', 'poor', 'poor', 'need', 'know', 'place', 'leave', 'good', 'life', 'Gekko', 'world']",N/A

Next to Michael Douglas, LaBeouf came across as fake, dull, and unfit to earn the one and half million dollar bonus. The movie portrays a culture of sharks bent on greed with high skills in deception and trickery. Yet, Jake Moore appeared charged, combative, irrational, sentimental, and stupid. No where in the movie, one could point to any strength in Moore's character other than an angry, hostile, and restless person. Pulling a single trick of spreading rumor to hurt an opponent could not justify the entitlement to a front seat in a meeting on high financial stakes.  Moore cried and wept allover the movie than he did to prove his entitlement to his stiff-necked approach to influential figures.On the other hand,the seasoned Michael Douglas pulled over a flawless role from the opening of the movie upon leaving the prison to his glorious comeback. Douglas'Gekko character leveled perfectly with the Broslin's Breton sneaky and calculating persona. Both Gekko and Breton spiced the movie with their exceptional acting abilities, with the exception of hiring the obnoxious and snippy Moore.On the same line, Breton's team and his negotiation with the Chinese were the weakest link in the movie. All issues and players on the negotiating table with the Chinese sounded unfit to be there except the two Chinese speakers.With Michael Douglas inability to redo a revised version of the movie with better replacement of Jake Moore and all associates of Breton, the moviemaker would have to search for newer faces in order to salvage the many positive contributions of the movie on educational matters.",4,Shia LaBeouf's poor performance undermined the movie's potential for greater success.,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,1709,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'was', 'getting', 'unpleasant', 'irritating', 'actor', 'LaBeouf', 'play', 'Jacob', 'Moore', 'Next', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'LaBeouf', 'came', 'fake', 'dull', 'unfit', 'earn', 'one', 'million', 'dollar', 'bonus', 'movie', 'culture', 'sharks', 'bent', 'greed', 'high', 'skills', 'deception', 'trickery', 'Jake', 'Moore', 'appeared', 'charged', 'combative', 'irrational', 'sentimental', 'stupid', 'where', 'movie', 'one', 'could', 'point', 'strength', 'Moore', 'character', 'other', 'angry', 'hostile', 'restless', 'person', 'Pulling', 'single', 'trick', 'spreading', 'rumor', 'hurt', 'opponent', 'could', 'not', 'justify', 'entitlement', 'front', 'seat', 'meeting', 'high', 'financial', 'stakes', 'Moore', 'cried', 'wept', 'allover', 'movie', 'did', 'prove', 'entitlement', 'stiff-necked', 'approach', 'influential', 'figures.On', 'other', 'hand', 'seasoned', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'pulled', 'over', 'flawless', 'role', 'opening', 'movie', 'leaving', 'prison', 'glorious', 'comeback', ""Douglas'Gekko"", 'character', 'leveled', 'perfectly', 'Broslin', 'Breton', 'sneaky', 'calculating', 'persona', 'Gekko', 'Breton', 'spiced', 'movie', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'abilities', 'exception', 'hiring', 'obnoxious', 'snippy', 'Moore.On', 'same', 'line', 'Breton', 'team', 'negotiation', 'Chinese', 'were', 'weakest', 'link', 'movie', 'issues', 'players', 'negotiating', 'table', 'Chinese', 'sounded', 'unfit', 'be', 'there', 'two', 'Chinese', 'speakers.With', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'inability', 'redo', 'revised', 'version', 'movie', 'better', 'replacement', 'Jake', 'Moore', 'associates', 'Breton', 'moviemaker', 'would', 'have', 'search', 'newer', 'order', 'salvage', 'many', 'positive', 'contributions', 'movie', 'educational', 'matters']",N/A

The original Wall Street has dated somewhat since its 80's release - go watch it now, and you will more likely be amazed at the hair styles and synth-y soundtrack than the story.  But it was a real zeitgeist movie, doing what Stone can do best - using a storyline in a movie to hold a mirror up to America, even if the angle is not the most flattering one.  This time round though, the edge is gone - the heat of the satire has somehow gone off the boil.  Don't get me wrong, I still found this a good movie and entertaining, but it's more in a melodrama mould than the expose of Stone's former glories.The movie is set in 2008.  Gecko has been released from prison, aged, but impassive enough for us to find it difficult to tell if the experience mellowed him, or embittered him.  Into his life walks Shia Lebeouf, involved in a relationship with his estranged daughter.  Amid the backdrop of one of the most significant year in decades for Wall Street, we follow the relationships of these three, and a few significant others.  Plenty to enjoy on display - Leboeuf puts in a surprisingly decent performance, and age hasn't dulled the glint in Douglas eye.. there is still a tangible presence when he's on centre stage.  Stone has accumulated some other surprising talents too.. Susan Sarandon, Eli Wallach amongst others.. but they exist roles that are entirely dispensible from a story point of view.  Sarandon in particular has a well played role as Laboeuf's mother, which nonetheless does nothing except slow the pace of the movie down.  Perhaps the biggest star then, after Douglas, is Stone himself.  Not in his on screen cameo, but as the director... the film is full of interesting stylistic flourishes and images which make the movie a visual treat.  Alas, when you are noticing director's tricks and enjoying the soundtrack, perhaps it's a good indication the story is not as punchy as it thinks it is.Not a failure, indeed, worth watching - but this fails to capture the moment in the way its predecessor did.",3,"Though lacking bite, still enjoyable",1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,2200,"['More', 'polished', 'more', 'stylish', 'more', 'melodramatic..', 'yet', 'somehow', 'never', 'sharp', 'biting', 'original', 'once', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'disappointing', 'original', 'Wall', 'Street', 'dated', 'somewhat', '80', 'release', 'go', 'watch', 'now', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'amazed', 'hair', 'styles', 'synth-y', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'was', 'real', 'zeitgeist', 'movie', 'doing', 'what', 'Stone', 'can', 'do', 'best', 'using', 'storyline', 'movie', 'hold', 'mirror', 'up', 'America', 'even', 'angle', 'not', 'most', 'flattering', 'one', 'time', 'round', 'edge', 'gone', 'heat', 'satire', 'somehow', 'gone', 'off', 'boil', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'found', 'good', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'more', 'melodrama', 'mould', 'expose', 'Stone', 'former', 'glories.The', 'movie', 'set', '2008', 'Gecko', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'aged', 'impassive', 'enough', 'find', 'difficult', 'tell', 'experience', 'mellowed', 'embittered', 'Into', 'life', 'walks', 'Shia', 'Lebeouf', 'involved', 'relationship', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'backdrop', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'year', 'decades', 'Wall', 'Street', 'follow', 'relationships', 'three', 'few', 'significant', 'others', 'Plenty', 'enjoy', 'display', 'Leboeuf', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'performance', 'age', ""n't"", 'dulled', 'glint', 'Douglas', 'eye..', 'still', 'tangible', 'presence', 'when', 'centre', 'stage', 'Stone', 'accumulated', 'other', 'surprising', 'talents', 'too..', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'amongst', 'others..', 'exist', 'roles', 'are', 'entirely', 'dispensible', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'Sarandon', 'particular', 'well', 'played', 'role', 'Laboeuf', 'mother', 'nonetheless', 'nothing', 'slow', 'pace', 'movie', 'down', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'star', 'then', 'Douglas', 'Stone', 'Not', 'screen', 'cameo', 'director', 'film', 'full', 'interesting', 'stylistic', 'flourishes', 'images', 'make', 'movie', 'visual', 'treat', 'Alas', 'when', 'are', 'noticing', 'director', 'tricks', 'enjoying', 'soundtrack', 'perhaps', 'good', 'indication', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'punchy', 'failure', 'indeed', 'worth', 'watching', 'capture', 'moment', 'way', 'predecessor', 'did']",N/A

While the melodramatic plot could have easily served as a decent enough backdrop for an examination into the causes of the current financial crisis, Stone instead wastes oodles of potential to focus on the intertwining dramas between Gekko, Jake, Winnie, and James; and while all the players perform admirably enough, the end result leaves one asking just why care about any of the proceedings at all in the first place.  Stone's delivery is heavy-handed, and the end result is a disappointing bore of a film.  Even with old pros like Eli Wallach, Susan Sarandon, and Austin Pendleton along for the ride, the film is just comes off as an overly glossy, half-hearted re-tread of the original film.

1390427,A1A45641HBR5HK,B004A2AN56,"Norman Guilbert Jr. ""Rotobuster""","[1, 1]","This sequel to Wall Street is an also-ran.  A bit uneven in the plot, the Gecko-man is older but wiser...  Or Is he?  Or Isn't he?  Is he still a greedy creep or did he grow a heart?  Its hard to tell.  Just when we all want to send him to jail again for stealing funds from his daughter, we hear him explain that yes he did try to use her, yes he is a creep, but she's all he's got so even though I've screwed you (again), let's somehow try to work this out.  We see father and daughter getting warmer and fuzzier toward each other as the closing credits are about to roll, but I was left wondering what he was going to do to her next.  A leopard doesn't change its spots.It did show how superficial and banal the world of high-stakes money can be.  I loved the scene in which Gordon runs into a former high-powered colleague after getting out of jail and the man didn't have a clue who Gecko was.  How quickly they forget.  Of course, these empty greed-machines don't relate to people, they only care about the portfolio the person has and how they can grab a piece of it for themselves.All in all, I found the pace slower than the first flick, the plot contrived and thinner, with far less punch, and not nearly as memorable as the first.  It was good to see Charlie Sheen again, in a cameo, sneering at Gordon at a party.  But overall, it runs to my mind as an attempt to wring a few more bucks out of the Wall Street franchise, timed perfectly to appeal to all of us who might be just-a-little annoyed at what those creeps did to our economy in 2008...",4,"Michael Douglas, Greedy again...",1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,1557,"['sequel', 'Wall', 'Street', 'also-ran', 'bit', 'uneven', 'plot', 'Gecko-man', 'older', 'wiser', ""n't"", 'still', 'greedy', 'creep', 'did', 'grow', 'heart', 'hard', 'tell', 'Just', 'when', 'want', 'send', 'jail', 'again', 'stealing', 'funds', 'daughter', 'hear', 'explain', 'yes', 'did', 'try', 'use', 'yes', 'creep', 'got', 'so', 'even', ""'ve"", 'screwed', 'again', 'let', 'somehow', 'try', 'work', 'out', 'see', 'father', 'daughter', 'getting', 'warmer', 'fuzzier', 'other', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'roll', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'leopard', ""n't"", 'change', 'spots.It', 'did', 'show', 'how', 'superficial', 'banal', 'world', 'high-stakes', 'money', 'can', 'be', 'loved', 'scene', 'Gordon', 'former', 'high-powered', 'colleague', 'getting', 'jail', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'who', 'Gecko', 'was', 'How', 'quickly', 'forget', 'course', 'empty', 'greed-machines', 'do', ""n't"", 'relate', 'people', 'only', 'care', 'portfolio', 'person', 'how', 'can', 'grab', 'piece', 'themselves.All', 'found', 'pace', 'slower', 'first', 'flick', 'plot', 'contrived', 'thinner', 'far', 'less', 'punch', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'memorable', 'first', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'again', 'cameo', 'sneering', 'Gordon', 'party', 'overall', 'mind', 'attempt', 'wring', 'few', 'more', 'bucks', 'Wall', 'Street', 'franchise', 'timed', 'perfectly', 'appeal', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'just-a-little', 'annoyed', 'what', 'creeps', 'did', 'economy', '2008']",N/A

While the story has some plausibility and perhaps accurately reflects the 2008 financial crisis, Shia LaBeouf's character isn't believable at all. In addition, as great an actor as Michael Douglas is, his character in this movie just doesn't work. A watered-done Gordon Gecko who can't figure out whether he wants to be a shark or a sentimental, teary-eyed dad. It didn't work! Stone destroyed Gordon Gecko! The Charlie Sheen cameo didn't work either. Very cheesy. The only thing that kept this movie afloat at all was the memory of the last one. I kept thinking that Stone was going to capture the magic of the first film, but alas, he never came close.The other thing I hated about this movie was the social commentary (voiced frequently by the characters). Normally, I like in that in the movie, but in this case it didn't work at all because the actual movie didn't really support the commentary. That is, the movie was too weak to support or bolster the comments the characters were making. It seemed very incongruous.

Atkinson,"[53, 65]","** SPOILER ALERT **  Do not read if you do not want to know details **I saw the original in the theatre in 1987 and was hoping for a sequel since then. This film was originally to be released in April 2010, but was pushed back to September 2010 as it was included in the Cannes Film Festival, and the studio probably did not want the film to get lost among the summer flotsam.That said, this film was worth the wait. If you are an aficionado of the original, you will appreciate the homage that this film pays to it. The soundtrack features David Byrne (of Talking Heads fame, featured in the original soundtrack), Gekko bumps into Bud Fox at a party, and LaBoeuf has the same real estate broker as Fox and Darian used...the lady with the annoying voice. Upon his release from prison, Gekko is also handed his brick-sized cellphone, which gives the viewer a glimpse of just how much things have changed since the original. Would have also been nice to bring back Sean Young or Terence Stamp in some capacity. Eli Wallach had a bit part which also delivered comeuppance superbly to Brolin's character.I think that Michael Douglas must have a clause in his contracts that require his to give at least one great speech in each of his films. For this film, it was when he addressed the college class. Stone truly delivered here, and laid the blame for the crisis exactly where it belongs, which is to say with the majority of us. The reference to the bartender who owned three houses was perfect.The film's weaknesses are few, but still significant. Specifically, Laboeuf is miscast and comes across about as threatening as a box of facial tissues. Sheen brought a power and passion for both good and bad to the original. Laboeuf seems out of place and definitely out of his depth next to Gekko. I think James Franco would have been far more convincing. Langella was a great fit as Zweibel, but had a far too limited role. Brolin was superlative and can do evil better than most of his contemporaries. Susan Sarandon was great as Labouef's mother.The other significant weakness in the film is in how neatly the family issues are tied up and concluded. Not unless your family is named Osmond, is atonement and forgiveness as easy as portrayed in the film. I definitely expected better in this regard.Overall though, well worth the wait.

After I'm totally confused, I wanted some kind of personal drama as the whole thing goes to pieces.Wall street ex-con Michael Douglas, just back from the can, has written a book, ""Greed Is Good"", and is out on his book tour. His future son-in-law attends a lecture and they strike up a hostile but respectful relationship. Looks like his daughter is holding a major grudge against the ol' crook and family destroyer.Future son-in-law has another kind of ""green"" in mind - an environmentally friendly new source of energy. Douglas is, alas, still into the more traditional green. So is his new boss...and soon to be, ex-boss. This dude is even worse than Douglas! His ethics are so bad that even investigators temporarily forget what they are trying to investigate.Susan Sarandon does a very interesting, ""Saturday Night Live"" caricature of a Mom from Queens - formerly in healthcare, she too pursues the big dollar signs - in real estate.The market crashes, careers crash; market recovers somewhat; the ""new blood"" finds new ways to stay in the ""game"".Magnificent cinematography as Stone's camera eye takes us to the top of skyscrapers, sweeping down to the countenances of the frantic players on thestreets, dodging taxi cabs. The location shots are well-composed. Don'y know why major corporations can't afford to turn a few lights on in board meetings, but, hey, that's movie-making. (Like how come the sidewalks are always blanketed with water? - it looks cooler).Well-selected music, mostly from David Byrne, sounding at times like McCartney and at other times like Starr, weaves in and out.I hope that a ""Director's Cut"" can actually feature ""cuts"", as in heavy edits in the never-ending denouement.Not going to give away the ending...hint - it's not exactly non-""Hollywood""!

That may be the biggest fantasy, that anyone from Wall Street should be punished for their greed.This is an entertaining film, well acted, scripted and photographed. But, as we know Wall Street is protected by the politicians, and whatever financial gains the money grabbers achieve, they get to keep. We follow one firm, where a young trader named Jake Moore played by Shia LaBeouf, works for his mentor Frank Langella, known as Louis Zabel. The firm is ripe with rumours on the street and it comes tumbling down, due to the actions of Bretton James played by Josh Brolin, who has spread rumors about the instability of the firm. A tragedy occurs and Jake takes it upon himself to show revenge for the loss of his firm. He works with Gordon Gekko, Michael Douglas, whom he met when Gordon was speechifying. As a side kick, Josh is engaged to Gordon's estranged daughter, Winnie. He keeps his relationship with Gordon from Winnie, and we know that will mistake will come home to roost. Winnie, played by Carey Mulligan is a young woman who has lost her father to prison and brother to drugs. She is unforgiving at first, but begins to melt. The relationships intertwine with shoddy trading practices, love, ambition and revenge.A slow film getting started, but it builds to a good story that is easy to follow but not enough distaste for Wall Street is shown. We see people from the government and the White House doing what they can to help Wall Street maintain its financial stability.

Stone does understand Wall Street since his dad was a stock broker but he fades from the previous inglorious greed and fast paced of the original Wall Street.Gekko (Michael Douglas) has just gotten out of prison with his ancient 80s cellphone for all the crimes he committed. Shia LaBeouf is a young trader with Frank Langella's firm (think Lehman Brothers in the meltdown) but is no Bud Fox. Unlike Bud Fox's slick descent into being a criminal, the new Gekko protege already commits a crime with no recriminations against Josh Brolin's company. First, you see Gekko hawking his book, Is Greed Good? on CNBC, and at a college.After Shia and Gekko get acquainted, it is a lot of computer screens and the fall of Langella's trading firm (a Lehman Brothers reference to the recent meltdown). Shia is a pushing some global warming energy company NOT easy capitalism. His wife is a liberal blogger. Both are liberals. Not exactly the Bud Fox and Darryl Hannah coupling. Money never slept for them. Neither did crime and one being a whore.Gekko, demurred, wants his hands on a $100 million slush fund he left his daughter so he can get back in the game. Shia convinces his wife to let him have it since it was ill-gotten gains and Gekko said it would go to the company trying to make energy from the ocean (nice global warming energy company). Boggles the mind how Stone got so sloppy and literal here. Susan Sarandon's character, and Shia's mom, is an afterthought--filler.Josh Brolin, the villian, really plays the role and is the only real star in this vehicle. But, unlike Gekko who you liked before, he's evil from the beginning. He wants money anyway he can get it even screwing his own company in the process. Even Gekko wasn't that stupid in the first film. Gekko screwed Bud Fox and BlueStar airlines until Fox got a wake-up call and screwed Gekko (and sent him to jail).So, with Gekko's connections, Shia has committed a crime, lied to his girlfriend and ruined their relationship in the pursuit of financing a global warming company. Gekko was reformed then finds he way back to being a crook. But, really, Gekko doesn't do anything crooked. The slush fund puts him back in business and he not really doing the old things--sell on insider information.The other truth in the whole film is that America is broke according to Gekko's book. Ain't that the truth.The end is anti-climatic, too perfect and needed a good dose of Gekko. Gekko's lust is gone. It ain't Gekko you'll be watching but the rest of the cast. The movie is more Stone espousing his liberal views rather than trying to entertain you like he did so well in Wall Street.

The real-life financial collapse is a sad, rivetting, life-altering world event, containing unseemly characters and manipulation. This film does not do justice at all to that.Soon into the film, I found it unengaging, the story drifting, the characters uninteresting and the music jarringly out of place. I wanted the whole thing to end now!Adding Charlie Sheen into the mix was not necessary. His entrance in the film looked more like a star cameo which was distracting. Sheen's acting was that of someone who was just handed the script. Why bother?Regarding the other actors, Michael Douglas should have been more prominent, and I always like Josh Brolin and Susan Sarandon but Shia Lebeouf? Now there's an actor I can easily forget.Whoever chose the soundtrack, should check with the person who selected the music for the Sopranos tv series just as an example. I didn't feel the music went with the time period or events and was too loud, probably because it didn't fit into the film. I might have preferred no music to that except that it would have made the awful script more prominent.I was so looking forward to this film but in the end, it seemed like components that were thrown together to meet a schedule.

1390440,A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,B004A2AN56,rash67,"[12, 15]","2008 just before the collapse. Gordon Gekko, the man with the reptile brain in front, is back! A seriously ill Michael Douglas reprises one of his greatest roles as a Wall Street insider who used insider trading info to make a fortune and coined the phrase ""Greed is Good!"" before ending up for eight years in the Steel Bar Hotel. He loses it all (maybe) and is anxious to find a way to get it all back. And get back at those who put him there. But is he the major villain or not?Shia LaBeouf stars as Jake Moore, a somewhat more scrupulous Wall Street green energy trader at Keller Zabel. Josh Broslin is Breton James the menacing Wall Street sleazebag Investment Banker who advises the Federal Reserve on what to do about another firm Keller Zabel  (owned by Frank Langella's character, Lewis Zabel) who has too many toxic loans. Breton James recommends the Fed refuse lend to Keller Zabel and driving them to bankruptcy. (A story taken right from the headlines, ala Lehman Brothers, for those with limited memories). The Lewis Zabel pleads with the Fed for help, reminds them other banks also hold toxic assets and then commits suicide jumping in front of a subway after his company stock share plummets. Hypercompetitive Breton James, we find, is illegally doing insider trading, advising the Fed while shorting the Keller Zabel stock secretly from an offshore account and then buying it up for pennies on the dollar. An ancient Eli Wallach plays a Wall Street banker old enough to remember the (last) Depression.The plot elaborate goes on and I won't say more. LaBeouf and a weepy Carey Mulligan (An Education) playing Gekko's estranged daughter present the human backdrop as Wall Street scum make themselves rich and destroy the American Economy with Collateralized Debt Obligations, toxic loans and insider trading. The Fed tries to protect what's left of the totally bankrupt American economy, when they discover no money is left in America from people borrowing money to support a lifestyle they can't afford.See Gordon Gekko define moral hazard and Ninjas (No Income, No Job or Assets). Gekko's character switches back and forth: villain to victim to sage to hero to villain, etc, in an Academy Award worthy performance.There is a great scene of Manhattan, Wall Street at night, skyscrapers with electric ticker tapes flowing down the streets instead of cars. There is a graphic of the English Stock Market, the FTSE price collapse plotted against the London Tower Bridge profile and the Wall Street collapse plotted against the Manhattan profile. Stone's movie presents a fascinating use of special effects.If this movie seems wordy, Oliver Stone is nothing if not a teacher...A timely story. Today it has taken the Fed and the past and current administration years to fix the Great Recession caused by this era (and they are still working on it). Do you ever wonder why there haven't been any fraud convictions for bankers and brokerages who commited this and the Bush officials who let them do it? Certain people want to return America to this form of predatory Capitalism. ""Get the government off our (their) backs"" and so they can again steal The Wealth of Nations, whatever is left. Oliver Stone reminds us of the unbridled greed that caused our current problems in the first place. Some other reviewers didn't seem to get it.One of the best movies of the year. One of Oliver Stones best. Everyone in America should see this movie! Highly recommended.""The definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.""

There's a scene where Douglas, as Gordon Gekko, is addressing a classful of business students and his speech is cut up, unsure, halting, with dissolves between nearly every sentence (even some overlaps), as if the actor couldn't deliver more than a line at a time.  This is pathetic -- it's the reintroduction of the Gekko character who was such a firecracker in the first movie, and it should've been a kick in the gut, the film's single most powerful moment. Instead it's limp as a dishrag.I don't think it's Douglas' fault.  He's generally fine in the movie, developing the reptilian Gekko into the slimy character you love to hate.  Carey Mulligan is excellent as his conflicted daughter, and Susan Sarandon has a small but powerful role as Jake's mother.  But Shia LaBeouf makes Keanu Reeves look like a master thespian by comparison, with a range all the way from oak to walnut.  You never once buy him as a financial Wunderkind, much less a loving boyfriend.The middle of the movie contains a voice-over narration on the evils of Wall Street, and Oliver Stone's patronizing sermon rips the viewer out of the story.  The facts should be allowed to speak for themselves -- which reminds me, Stone could've taken some lessons from Planet Money on EXPLAINING what was going on rather than just throwing industry jargon around.  Stone gets most of the details right (so far as I can tell) but he didn't spend any effort explaining what traunches, CDOs, CDSs and all the rest mean. Shame on him, it was an opportunity to educate.  Finally he almost completely missed (or ignored) the big story behind the news headlines, the overly-cozy relationship between Wall Street and Moody's/S&P;, who were *supposed* to be protecting the public.David Byrne's music is over-used, ill-used and distracting, and it has no connection (lyrically or emotionally) with the story.  Tracks fromMy Life in the Bush of Ghostsworked well in the first movie butEverything That Happens Will Happen Todayis nowhere near as good -- or relevant.And the ending -- as most reviewers have noted -- seemingly was pasted on from a different movie altogether.

The talent and charisma that won him the Oscar for playing Gordon Gekko in the original film are still on display here.While Shia LeBeouf, as Jake, is the film's protagonist - a young man torn between becoming a ""Wall Street guy"" and the man his idealist left-wing fiancee Winnie, played by Carey Mulligan, wants him to be - he is only halfway engrossing and believable in his role. When you receive your acting pedigree from Nickelodeon and cereal commercials, it shows.He still comes through with the passion and energy needed in a handful of crucial scenes, and he plays off other actors such as Douglas and Susan Sarandon, who plays his overly needy mother with a perfect Long Island accent, very well.The incredible Josh Brolin plays Bretton James, easily the best cinematic antagonist of 2010. He makes James' suave conniving and cool malevolence pack extreme tension and dramatic pulse.Frank Langella is likely to pick up another Oscar nomination for his supporting role as Jake's mentor, Lewis Zabel. His pensive, thoughtful, perfectly nuanced portrayal of inward despair, loss of hope and protection for his protegee is instantly heartbreaking and deeply impressive.Mulligan both underacts and overacts, taking few risks in the more climactic scenes, mostly simply standing still and crying like a wounded bird. Of course, this may have more to do with Oliver Stone's directing choices.The legendary Eli Wallach is well-used, particularly in some humorous moments. He remains to this day a formidable and authoritative screen presence, seemingly without trying.The film is, indeed, too long. A solid 10 minutes could have been cut. It is easy to see Stone's temptation to leave it all in, however, since the story - if a bit tenuous on its grasp on current events, and unable to bring the audience into the nuts and bolts of Wall Street dealings - remains thoroughly arresting until five to ten minutes before the film reaches its surprisingly unambiguous conclusion.Those looking for the finesse of the original ""Wall Street"" will inevitably find themselves unsatisfied, but Gordon Gekko remains a sharp, heavy screen presence thanks to Douglas' talent, and Bryan Burrough's story is mostly solid, quite engaging and leaves room for some very fine acting along the way.",4,The Return of Gordon Gekko,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,2651,"['Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'many', 'redemptive', 'qualities', 'spite', 'rather', 'tentative', 'half-hearted', 'use', '2008', 'financial', 'crisis', 'conventional', 'only', 'mildly', 'textured', 'plotlines.Even', 'when', 'off-screen', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'natural', 'unassuming', 'acting', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'unstudied-looking', 'talent', 'charisma', 'won', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'display', 'here.While', 'Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'Jake', 'film', 'protagonist', 'young', 'man', 'torn', 'becoming', 'Wall', 'Street', 'guy', 'man', 'idealist', 'left-wing', 'fiancee', 'Winnie', 'played', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'be', 'only', 'halfway', 'engrossing', 'believable', 'role', 'When', 'receive', 'acting', 'pedigree', 'Nickelodeon', 'cereal', 'commercials', 'shows.He', 'still', 'passion', 'energy', 'needed', 'handful', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'other', 'actors', 'such', 'Douglas', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'overly', 'needy', 'mother', 'perfect', 'Long', 'Island', 'accent', 'very', 'well.The', 'incredible', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Bretton', 'James', 'easily', 'best', 'cinematic', 'antagonist', '2010', 'James', 'suave', 'conniving', 'cool', 'malevolence', 'pack', 'extreme', 'tension', 'dramatic', 'pulse.Frank', 'Langella', 'likely', 'pick', 'up', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'supporting', 'role', 'Jake', 'mentor', 'Lewis', 'Zabel', 'pensive', 'thoughtful', 'perfectly', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'inward', 'despair', 'loss', 'hope', 'protection', 'protegee', 'instantly', 'heartbreaking', 'deeply', 'impressive.Mulligan', 'underacts', 'overacts', 'taking', 'few', 'risks', 'more', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'simply', 'standing', 'still', 'crying', 'wounded', 'bird', 'course', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'directing', 'choices.The', 'legendary', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'well-used', 'particularly', 'humorous', 'moments', 'day', 'formidable', 'authoritative', 'screen', 'presence', 'seemingly', 'trying.The', 'film', 'indeed', 'too', 'long', 'A', 'solid', '10', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'easy', 'see', 'Stone', 'temptation', 'leave', 'however', 'story', 'bit', 'tenuous', 'grasp', 'current', 'events', 'unable', 'bring', 'audience', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'Wall', 'Street', 'dealings', 'thoroughly', 'arresting', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'unambiguous', 'conclusion.Those', 'looking', 'finesse', 'original', 'Wall', 'Street', 'will', 'inevitably', 'find', 'unsatisfied', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'sharp', 'heavy', 'screen', 'presence', 'thanks', 'Douglas', 'talent', 'Bryan', 'Burrough', 'story', 'mostly', 'solid', 'quite', 'engaging', 'room', 'very', 'fine', 'acting', 'way']",N/A

Reviews were mostly negative and so I tempered my expectations, but I wanted to revisit this world even if just to eliminate the movie from my potential wish list.I was pleasantly surprised.Frank Langella didn't have a big role as Louis Zabel, but it was an important one and set the scene well. Jake Moore (LaBeouf) plays a successful young broker who is dating Winnie Gekko (Mulligan). She's no longer in contact with her father (Gordon) since he was released from prison. Moore seems to admire Gordon Gekko and tries to patch up the father-daughter relationship.The stock market is facing hard times and many firms are going out of business. The heart of the story revolves around Moore's quest toavenge the death of his former boss and mentor Zabel by working for the billionaire (Brolin) who was largely responsible for the events leading to his suicide.A secondary story involves Gordon Gekko and his attempts to connect with his daughter while striving to establish himself on Wall Street despite not having any money.It's not as good as the original, but I am glad I saw it. Stone used some interesting choices to depict the business being done on Wall Street and it worked for me.The presentation was very good; much better than the dismal 1987 Blu-ray.

Michael Douglas reprises his iconic role of Gordon Gekko with great relish while Shia LaBeouf turns in some of his best work as a cocky, but emotional, up and comer. LaBeouf is turning into quite the dramatic lead and I look forward to more of his work. Carey Mulligan continues her winning streak as Gekko's daughter and the cast is rounded out from seasoned professions like Josh Brolin (re-teaming with Stone after ""W.""), Susan Sarandon, Frank Langella and Eli Wallach. The cinematography may be some of the best of 2010 for the fact that the camera is both reactive and reflective to the characters and the story. Yes, it's stylish, but it does more than just make the proceedings look cool. It serves the story and characters in ways I haven't seen anywhere else recently. Overall, the film is worth seeing for Stone's vivid and stylish imagery, an accurate, but simple, commentary on the financial crisis of the past decade and some good performances. It might not flow as easily as it would like, but the end result is more than worth the trouble of keeping up. I really enjoyed this fun sequel. (One should also take note of the ending, Stone is clearly having a blast with the Hollywood ""happy ending"" conventions and the ""insanity"" of the past decade. It proves to be extremely unsettling in all it's ""happiness"".)",5,"Sure, it's flawed, but it's got great energy and performances!",1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,1612,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'zeitgeist', 'film', 'mostly', 'heartedly', 'sequel', 'actuality', 'companion', 'film', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'zippy', 'overly', 'obvious', 'bit', 'meandering', 'picture', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'iconic', 'role', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'great', 'relish', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'best', 'work', 'cocky', 'emotional', 'up', 'comer', 'LaBeouf', 'turning', 'dramatic', 'lead', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'work', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'winning', 'streak', 'Gekko', 'daughter', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'seasoned', 'professions', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 're-teaming', 'Stone', 'W.', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'cinematography', 'may', 'be', 'best', '2010', 'fact', 'camera', 'reactive', 'reflective', 'characters', 'story', 'Yes', 'stylish', 'more', 'just', 'make', 'proceedings', 'look', 'cool', 'story', 'characters', 'ways', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anywhere', 'else', 'recently', 'Overall', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Stone', 'vivid', 'stylish', 'imagery', 'accurate', 'simple', 'commentary', 'financial', 'crisis', 'past', 'decade', 'good', 'performances', 'might', 'not', 'flow', 'as', 'easily', 'would', 'like', 'end', 'result', 'more', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'fun', 'sequel', 'One', 'should', 'also', 'take', 'note', 'ending', 'Stone', 'clearly', 'having', 'blast', 'Hollywood', 'happy', 'ending', 'conventions', 'insanity', 'past', 'decade', 'be', 'extremely', 'unsettling', 'happiness']",N/A

That's all the more reason why this sequel is so disappointing to me.  I'd hate to think Oliver Stone is losing his touch, so I'll chalk this puppy up to a rare mistake.The script falters, and is indeed, immature when considering the sophistication of the subject matter undertaken.  Both of the young actors (the up-and-coming new-age trader, and his fiancee', Gordon Gecco's daugher)left a lot to be desired in their character artistry.  Michael Douglas, one of my favorites, appeared too tired to care about his impact one way or the other; some of the dialogue reminded me of a flimsy soap opera segment rather than the tale of a displaced, ruthless master manipulator returning to the fold, if not the floor.I was expecting much more from this film and it could have been delivered; it certainly had the potential given all that has happened in the markets since the original ""Wall Street"" was released.  I'm not sure what happened, but I couldn't make enough excuses for it to give it more than two stars.Come back again, Stone, and this time give us a real one.

1390461,APTDA7GU7SUBG,B004A2AN56,Taggart Murphy,"[22, 32]","First: I love 1987's Wall Street.  Maybe one of my top 10 films of all time.  If I hear the opening notes of Naive Melody I want to drop what I'm doing and watch it that VERY SECOND.  Sure, it's got its own issues, most all of them contained in the Martin Sheen character, but come on - Martin & Charlie TOGETHER?! ""There came int Egypt a Pharoah that did not know..."", that made no sense 23 years ago or today, but how fantastic are the other lines? John C. McGinley might be my favorite character EVER, Marvin the Mindreader!?With that, I held off watching WS2 for months.  Why? Oliver Stone isn't what he used to be.  We can all make a case for Any Given Sunday but clearly the halcyon days are behind us.  Plus, given the financial collapse, you had to know the half-communist moralizing would be overpowering.  Plus Michael Douglas is SO OLD.  Plus stupid Shia LaBoeuf is SO TERRIBLE, not in this, in EVERYTHING.  So, I knew I shouldn't have watched it.  I knew it would be like this.So, I'll rattle off a few of the most egregious offenses:1. Frank Langella.  The father/son'ish relationship is terrible.  ""I remember you caddying..."" blech.  Jumping in front of a train? FYI the real Bear Stearns guys don't jump in front of a train, they go to their country house and sulk and count their severance.  Totally unnecessary and then you lose Langella and keep LaBoeuf.  Oh, how weird is it when stupid La Boeuf kisses Frank on his bald head?2. The girlfriend's stupid website.  The B story no one could care about.  She's pregnant, she's got a website, it has a little traffic but if you publish the slightest rumor about evil Brolin he's in cuffs in MINUTES.  Dumb.3. Music.  Is it me or was it 1) all David Byrne and 2) some stupid song with the word ""home"" in it played a thousand times? I guess I wasn't the only one who enjoyed the Talking Heads in the first flick, huh? Only Stone doesn't know what I do, which is that Byrne is virtually unlistenable since the Heads dissolved.4. The real estate agent: criminy, she was super old the last time, she looks dessicated here.  Still got the same voice but could we CGI her a little bit???5. Poor Susan Sarandon.  I suppose if we're going to moralize, we have to pillory a house flipper, but do we have to do it to Sarandon.  Ah, she's strung out on the payments, she should CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY and BE A NURSE GARGHH.6. Motorcycle race.  So Josh Brolin is, a) not the head of his firm but super valuable but b) still at the NY Fed meetings and apparently super-influential and also c) somehow integral in getting Gekko sent to jail, and d) also a super-accomplished super-bike racer just like stupid La Boeuf, and e) not an art collector but has super rare stuff in the study.  Whatever.  Clearly a supervillain, should have a cat and steal nuclear weapons.7. Renewable energy.  ARGH.  Aside from me never needing to hear 20 minutes on fake renewable energy, how many scenes of the white haired guy calling stupid La Boeuf? 30? ""Shia, I need money, I'm out of money, please more money."" Yuck.8. The meeting with the Chinese. I've worked with bankers for 15 years.  If you walk into a pitch meeting, they will PITCH until you cannot handle it anymore and go for the door.  Here, Evil Brolin has a 2 minute pitch on some nonsense, and then they're like ""no"", and he's like ""oh"" and then stupid La Boeuf wings it.  Oh so stupid.9. Gekko's speech.  So Gekko's speaking, and they cut, cut, cut, so you assume his speech is what, 30 minute? 45? Everything he says is SO STUPID and all platitudes you can't imagine not passing out if you had to hear it, but then we cut to the audience and they're all laughing and fired up.  The 4 minute version in the film was intolerable, I never would have survived the whole lecture.10. Gekko turning evil again, and then getting lame again.  The part where Gekko gets evil is the only high point, like the 10 minutes at the end of Star Wars III is the only high point in the whole 3 prequels there, where Darth shows up.  He gets rad and evil and buys suits and gets his hair cut and then sees a frigging ultrasound and promptly gets lame again.11.  Brolin's comeuppance.  This is such a pale shadow of the original I could hardly stand it.  Plus, how rad is Terrance Stamp?  Plus, for all the reviews about this being cutting commentary on the recent bout of financial crisis, the comeuppance (as well as Langella's downfall)? START A VICIOUS RUMOR! Not the unraveling of a complicated CDO, just start a rumor.  Brolin gets his because we announce he started a rumor.  SO LAME.12. The rooftop party.  Mom, Gordon Gekko, the dumb energy guy, the baby, the ""home"" song again.  BWAH.13. Charlie Sheen.  Oh my heavens.  Even if you know the cameo is coming you can;t be prepared for how bad it is:a) Sheen cannot act in a drama anymore, he could barely do it then.b) Gekko can't remember ""Blue Star""? Really?c) ""Does Blue Horseshoe still love Anacot Steel?"" Hey kids, here's a line you love, let's all say it!d) ""I made millions and these are girls! I'm Charlie Sheen!""14. Eli Wallach.  Like Langella, criminally underused.  Is he doing the Lou Mannheim part? At least Holbrook had a dozen lines, ""man looks into the abyss....""15. Sean Young.  The movie is this utterly terrible and you can't find a walk on for the old girl? You roll out bloated Bud Fox and Sean Young's home waiting for the phone to ring? On the same note, Darryl Hannah can't get a line? WHAT HAPPENED TO HER HOME DECOR BUSINESS? I MUST KNOW.16.  Naive Melody over the ending credits.  Please don't patronize me.So other than Gekko in London and some good helicpoter work in NYC, this essentially broke my heart.I've got four days off coming and I'm going to buy the blue ray of Wall Street and try to pretend like I never saw the second one.",1,I knew I shouldn't have watched it.

1390464,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B004A2AN56,The Guardian,"[0, 0]","Oliver Stone's films are normally heavy going, humourless and preachy; he likes to smash the audience over the head with his moralising and in ""JFK"" he got almost everything factually wrong. However, I always appreciated the original 1987 ""Wall Street"" for its sharp screenplay, superlative acting and editing and morally astute ""greed-is-NOT-good"" message. It's fair to say that Michael Douglas's devastating performance as Gordon Gekko defined the original film's core in personifying the selfish, cold, win-at-all-costs immorality of the long-gone 1980s.So 23 years on, what of this belated sequel, ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps""? Well, Stone is now a better film-maker, matured and wiser. He has crafted a near-excellent lesson in morality attacking this time not the activities of a few rogue traders, but the systemic corruption and imbalances inherent in a banking system with little external oversight or realistic internal managerial prudence which allows for continued out-of-control borrowing, leverage and debt-trading on insubstantial property assets on a truly galactic scale, to the point where it cracks and the global economy is almost brought to its knees. These guys can, at the end of the day, virtually dictate that government steps in to save them from going under because the consequences of failing to shore up the financial system are too awful to contemplate: social and economic meltdown, the ""end of the world.""Douglas resurrects his memorable role as Gordon Gekko in a second career-landmark performance, if anything even sharper than in the 1987 film. He has some killer lines (""If you stop telling lies about me, I'll stop telling the truth about you"" and ""Hey! If someone were to take out this building right now, there'd be no-one left to rule the world!"" stand out in memory). Released from jail after eight years, having lost his son to suicide following psychiatric breakdown he has searched his troubled soul and seems reformed. Daughter Winnie (played tearfully in a so-so performance by Carey Mulligan) is doing OK with fianc&eacute; stockbroker Jake Moore (played well by Shia LaBeouf, though as an actor he possibly lacks the gravitas the role calls for). Winnie will have nothing to do with newly-released and rehabilitated Pop, distrusts him and hates him for tearing the family apart, causing her brother's death and tarnishing her name. It's up to Jake to finally reunite them in (a rather formulaic Hollywood scene of) tearful forgiveness, though the journey is a rocky road and takes time.Having rediscovered his moral compass behind bars, Gordon has a new book published to coincide with his release. The book exposes the house of cards which is the western financial system, built on debt and promise-to-pay-eventually and motivated by greed whilst backed by insufficient assets. Gordon's book proves prophetic as the global credit crunch unfolds through 2007 and 2008. A killer scene where Gordon gives a presentation to several hundred finance students and players in a lecture hall, complete with black humour and devastating one-liners, may be destined to become one of cinema's most iconic moments. ""You're the NINJA generation"", he quips, ""No Income, No Job or Assets.""Without giving too much of the plot away, one of the main storylines is the engineered collapse of Lehman Bros - disguised in the film under another name as Jake's employer - and Jake's quest for revenge against the instigators with the covert assistance of Gordon. A new villain, Master-of-the-Universe Bretton James (played to suitably demonic effect by Josh Brolin), who of course Jake gets real close to, takes centre stage as The Bad Guy. The amorality of the game everyone is forced to play in the banking and stock-trading world is nailed to a ""T"" with some masterful observations by Stone. A little heavy-handed at times he may be, but he shows you the way it is, no holds barred. The screenplay is a devastating critique, fast-paced and tightly scripted and holds the attention mostly, though it's not exactly clich&eacute;-free.Where the film falls short is in the family-relationship and personal redemption department, which is almost classic Hollywood and doesn't really come off as well as the hard-hitting message about the financial system. It's just OK, but not altogether convincing. Stone manages to incorporate his alternative green-energy obsessions (in this case, hi-tech fusion) as the neglected Cinderella of big financial investment and there is, at a personal level, a happy ending of sorts for the three main characters. No-one comes out smelling of roses, but sure enough, Gordon is in the end redeemed.David Byrne's excellent music provides a quality soundtrack perfect for the film's mood. The supporting cast is good, especially Susan Sarandon as Jake's mother whose character has forsaken her career as a nurse (i.e. someone performing a job of real social value who ""makes a difference"") in order to become a real-estate speculator and make money in the casino economy until everything goes pear-shaped for her and she loses it all (go on, Oliver, ram your morality message home some more, why don't you?). The plot is fast-paced and convoluted, so you need to pay attention. Is it worth seeing? Yes, it is. It's a serious film and a good one, if not quite a great one.

The crash of 2008 provides a background of corruption, greed, stock manipulation, etc. for a drama that centers around Gordon, his estranged daughter and her Wall Street boyfriend.

1390467,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B004A2AN56,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[1, 3]","When the firstWall Streetmovie came out, I remember seeing it. I imagine there's a lot of greed among the suits there, but still found Oliver Stone to be a little self-righteous so the film didn't do that much for me.Then the suits declared that ""that's not the way Wall Street works,"" and that stimulated more interest in me for the film.My spouse hadn't seen the original so we watched the DVD last weekend. Then we went to see this, the sequel.It starts with Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) getting out of prison. Two details to note: 1) there wasn't even anyone there to meet him and (2) his ""portable phone"" looks almost like a WWII walkie talkie. (That I thought was a slight tone of comedy).Then we cut to his daughter, Winnie (Carrie Mulligan) and her lover, a budding stock broker not much unlike Charlie Sheen in the original, but with a little of a conscience--one accentuated by Ms. Gekko, who has a nonprofit environmental blog. Anyway, the boyfriend, Jake Moore (Shia LaBoef), has fantasies of some kind of laser/fusion energy, and he's been working with a physicist, Dr. Masters (Austin Pendleton) to develop that.Jake is also been mentored by Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), a big time wheeler dealer who's been put down to the point of suicide by Bretton James (Josh Brolin) another conscienceless wheeler dealer.I don't want to give away too much on the ongoing story. I found it so visually uncomfortable--it's like Stone's other film,Natural Born Killers; there's so much going on that it's distracting! I don't know if Stone is trying to be clever with it, but it's enough to make you motion sick!It's worse than watching news on some networks that have six things going on at once so that you can't focus on any of them.There's reference to Gekko's infidelity and to his wife's having suffered, and to his son's suicide (that was the wedge between Gekko and his daughter). I guess we can be grateful that Stone didn't dwell on those details in either of the films, but they seemed to slip into the plot a little sloppily.As to the greed of the suits on Wall Street, I do not delude myself into believing anything else. Just recently, I was listening to a podcast of those suits, all of them making 6 and 7 (and more!) figure annual salaries. They'd just been bailed out by the government, i.e., if the feds hadn't been there to bail them, they'd have been unemployed. Still, these loons (1) condemned Obama for his ""liberaliam"" and everything he ostentibly stands for and (2) insisted that they're as rich as they are because of their being ""smarter"" than the rest of us; one of them went so far as to refer to ""survival of the fittest."" But Stone tends to be distractingly self-righteous and that makes me feel uncomfortable.The film has its good points: Douglas runs off to UK and is just as ruthless as he was before prison. But then he reconciles with his daugher, though, for a while, you think they didn't. So there were tones of ""romance,"" dispute, and reconciliation.One scene, in which Jake goes on a little of a daredevil motorcycle ride with his then-boss Bretton James reminded me of a scene in the documentaryEnron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.But, again, the film had a little too much ""they all lived happily ever after."" For example, the Josh Brolin character was on his way to his demise. Then, Gekko came through to his daughter, the whole laser/fusion thing came about and, well, everyone seemed so happy, except for Brolin and for ZabelIf you want any particular excitement, or anything to talk about in a film class or discussion of Wall Street and its attributes, I don't recommend this film, to be honest.

1390469,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004A2AN56,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Those who expect an insightful look at Wall Street and the recent stock market crash will be disappointed at Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"" sequel to ""Wall Street"" made in 1987. But I know this is not a documentary, and it doesn't have to be one. What is really disappointing to me is the film could have been a more riveting drama with one very interesting anti-hero Gordon Gekko.Shia LaBeouf is Jacob Moore, ace trader working for a major investment banks. His girlfriend Winnie (Carey Mulligan) is a daughter of Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), released from jail back in 2001. Despite the warning from Winnie, after listening to Gordon's speech at his lecture, Jacob is instantly attracted to the disgraced former Wall Street banker, who once told the world ""Greed is good"" (and now wrote a book ""Is Greed Good?"")The film's complicated story also Bretton James (Josh Brolin), a ruthless head of an investment bank, and Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), head of Keller Zabel Investments Jacob currently works for. Charlie Sheen briefly appears as Bud Fox, the main character of the original ""Wall Street.""As you know, Gordon Gekko is the role for which the star Michael Douglas won Oscar about 24 years ago, and in the sequel Douglas is quite good as charismatic and mysterious father/mentor-like figure to Shia LaBeouf's would-be son-in-law/prot&eacute;g&eacute;. This is the most intriguing aspect of ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"" with Shia LaBeouf's character similar to the role played by Charlie Sheen in the original, but it is eventually sidelined by the less convincing story about the romance and even less convincing plotline about the nuclear fusion project. And there is another subplot about Jacob's mother (played by Susan Sarandon), a real-estate agent who needs money badly.I know making a film about the still on-going financial crisis is too difficult a task for anyone to deal with (especially when you have to do it without losing entertainment value), but after watching the film, I still don't know what ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" really wants to say. So many things are going on, but not many of them are really interesting or immediate, and some plotlines are treated rather heavy-handedly with clich&eacute;d narrative elements.

1390470,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004A2AN56,Turfseer,"[6, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***If you haven't already discovered it, Oliver Stone is a preacher. His movies always boil down to the proverbial 'us vs. them'. Back in 1987, with the release of the first 'Wall Street', there was some ambiguity in Gordon Gekko's famous phrase, ""Greed is Good."" Although Gekko was a bad guy, there was something charming about him, so one could still feel sorry for the rapacious financier even though he's being sent away to prison. In his later days, Stone's sense of subtlety has waned. While he still holds a great attraction to the world of wealth and privilege (after all, he is a very well off in real life), it would not be politically expedient for Stone to identify himself with the 1% crowd. Thus, the heroes of Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps are (in terms of today's nomenclature) the 99 per centers, who completely reject the ""greed is good"" mantra.'Money Never Sleeps' is set in 2008, the year of the Wall Street financial meltdown. If it were today, Stone might have had Jake, his proprietary trader protagonist, hanging out for a few hours in Zuccotti Park each day. Even though Jake professes his love for the 'green', he'll only invest in progressive companies that promote alternative energy. And his girlfriend, Winnie, who also happens to be Gordon Gekko's estranged daughter, runs a small website designed to expose one percenter shenanigans. Jake's mentor at his firm, Keller Zabel Investments, is Louis Zabel, another ""word is my bond"" good guy amongst the wolves, who can't take the heat when the firm loses 30% of its value at the beginning of the 2008 crisis. His solution is to jump in front of a subway train after one percenter bad guy Bretton James (Josh Brolin), CEO of Keller Zabel's rival, blocks a bailout for the troubled firm .Enter Gordon Gekko, ex-con, who wants to re-establish a bond with his daughter. He conscripts Jake by making a deal with him: if Jake can help him reconcile with Winnie then he'll provide information that can sink Brett. Jake uses information that causes Brett's' firm to lose $120 million but Brett inexplicably offers Jake a job. Jake's plan is to take revenge on the evil Brett who he holds responsible for his mentor's suicide. There is some hint that although Jake intends to undermine Brett from the beginning he's seduced by the wily CEO after Brett promises to steer a Chinese company toward investing in the fusion energy company Jake's been touting. When the economic crisis affects the firm, Brett plays it safe by promoting bunk solar panels and fossil fuels to the Chinese. Jake throws a fit when all bets are off for his fusion energy company; his 'dark moment of the soul' occurs when he blows his cover by cursing out Brett and getting himself fired.The solution is that Gekko reveals to Jake that he's had $100 million stashed away in a Swiss bank account all along and needs for his daughter to sign the money over to Jake who will in turn hand it over to Gekko who promises to invest it all in the fusion energy company Jake's trying to save. At first, Gekko appears to be returning to form when he disappears with the $100 million and the fusion company appears to be sinking like the Titanic.Jake's revenge plot against Brett turns wimpy when he merely gives Winnie some information that she publishes in her blog, leading to Brett's downfall. If you can believe that the unsubstantiated rumors in a small left-wing newspaper can destroy this powerful CEO, then perhaps I can sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. Whatever the case, Jake's passing of information to his girlfriend, is hardly the stuff of exciting denouements.The ultimate wimp-out of course is Gekko's decision to join the 99 percenters by returning the $100 million to the now reconciled couple and get to see his grandchild a year later. The good guy crowd wins the day by shouting the new 2008 mantra: 'Greed is bad'. Had 'Money Never Sleeps' been filmed during the time of OWS, Stone would have had Gekko along with Jake, Winnie (and a photo of the deceased Zabel) snuggle up together inside one of the newly minted pup tents in Zuccotti Park.Shia LaBeouf is really perfectly cast to play Jake. The actor who usually plays hotheads (and is a hothead in real life) shows himself to be more comfortable in a place like Zuccotti than inside an investment bank. In 'Money never sleeps', his rebellion takes the form of some wild riding on a motorcycle and well as cuddling with his 'greed is bad' significant other.. Carey Mulligan has little to do as liberal blogger Winnie but Josh Brolin is more enjoyable as a sinister over the top head honcho. Frank Langella is stuck in the role of the kindly mentor Louis Zabel and is too idealistic a character to be believable. Michael Douglas manages to pull off some real acting, particularly in the emotionally powerful scene when he first makes a real attempt to reconcile with Winnie. But the absurdity of Gekko suddenly reversing course at the film's climax, undermines all the good acting Douglas had done beforehand.'Money Never Sleeps' is Oliver Stone's attempt to be accepted by his middle-class audience. There is no chance anymore that Gordon Gekko can exist as both good and bad at the same time. Gekko can now only be good in the present. The bad guy of today, the Brett's of this world, the one percenters, must be thrown under the proverbial bus. In reality, however, none of the 'villains' of the 2008 economic crisis were called to the bar of justice. Quite the contrary, they made out like bandits! Thus, Stone's comeuppance of the one percenter crowd, rings as false as the idealized crowd of do-gooders he creates, that are depicted going to battle with them!",2,Zuccotti Park vs. One Percenters

1390477,AH64XXZBL1T6Z,B004A2AN56,Yaakov (James) Mosher,"[1, 4]","Michael Douglas is in top form in reprising his most famous/infamous character - financier Gordon Gekko. His young co-stars (Shia LaBoeuf and Carey Mulligan) try to keep up but don't quite get there. Don't fault them - few can run with Douglas, especially when he's deconstructing the contradictions that undergird modern commercial society.Gekko is out of prison and out with a book. He's talking about moral hazard and the twinkle in his eyes tip us that he's willing put up his dukes again in the game of hazard even though he talks like a recovering addict.It turns out that Gekko and would-be son-in-law Jacob (LaBoeuf) have the same target - a master hazard duker named Bretton James. Someone needs to scour the original ""Wall Street"" to look for the James character. I suspect he's not there.Josh Brolin plays James. Director Oliver Stone cast Brolin as Bush 43 in ""W."" Some might suspect Stone of needling the Bush White House through the casting but Stone is fair to Bush. There's even a line where Gekko and left-leaning daughter Winnie (Mulligan) agree that W. and Co. didn't cause the meltdown. The fact that Obama can't get Stone to throw a propaganda rabbit punch one month before the mid-term election is the surest sign yet that Barack may be a one-termer.Charlie Sheen makes a cameo (no Daryl Hannah, though) and that's the closest we come to flashbacks to the ""Wall Street"" of 1987. New music from the incomparable David Byrne keeps our minds straddled between the two eras but the only talking heads we're treated to are the financial junkies' favorites - CNBC's Maria Bartiromo, David Faber, and Sue Herera et al.The ""Money Never Sleeps"" subtitle is the recognition of 24-hour financial markets and their worldwide power. Greed, fear and our complicity in the mammouth profligacy are themes Stone strongly weaves into his script. We should be sobered by Gekko's explanation of the ""ninja"" generation.Stone gets close to identifying the Federal Reserve's destructiveness when Gekko talks of the bubble created when interest rates were driven down to 1 percent after 9/11. Later The Fed poses as savior. The bailouts are at odds with justice, but as Stone shows us, there's no easy way out (for the record, the banks did repay the government). The Fed is not completely the villain either since if Washington balanced its budget the central bank could largely escape being bubble-maker of last resort. As Gekko, summarizes it so well, ""Human beings...Got to give them a break. They're all a mixed bag.""That's a good prayer but the lack of religion among the ""Money Never Sleeps"" characters is conspicuous. It probably explains why Wall Street thinks the end of Big Finance is the end of life on Earth. They're self-absorbed in a colossal way. The human race will find different forms in dealing with this age-old problem of material provision. ""There's nothing new under the sun,"" King Solomon says in Eccelsiastes. (Interesting that ""Wall Street 2"" hit the theaters during the holiday of Sukkos, when Eccelsiastes is read). Contra Ben Bernanke, Hank Paulson and Larry Summers, Big Finance's waterloo is not the same thing as nuclear holocaust. Gekko ties it all together again by showing how the absence of religion boils everything down to a fetid struggle for power. The financier tells Jacob - ""It's not about the money. It's about the thing between people.""For those interested in getting out of the labyrinth and resurrecting stability, the way was shown by Moses in Egypt. The courage of President Reagan and Paul Volcker during the 1982 recession is a modern example. It comes down to living with the facts that corrections take time and things will get worse before they get better (and don't be fooled by the false dichotomy of government ""help"" versus ""doing nothing."").
