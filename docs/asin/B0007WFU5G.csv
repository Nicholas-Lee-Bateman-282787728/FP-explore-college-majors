892176,A3K441JYZFY0IF,B0007WFU5G,"Dennis Jiang ""Evilcon-114""","[4, 5]",A new character is introduced in this dvd. Her name is Mio Hio and oh my god she acts soo....white. Turns out she fell for Daisuke when she meets him in class and every time after that shes been stalking him. Other than that Dark works even harder trying to conceil the truth of the kiss happening from Daisuke. It's sad though how it all has to end for Risa. Turns out that Dark loved her grandmother and that Risa resembles her and for that he claims that he can never see her again. I would recommend this dvd to all fans of the previous dvds and I just want to say that the anime over all is very good.,5,Daisuke now has another girl chasin after him!!!,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,606,"['new', 'character', 'introduced', 'dvd', 'name', 'Mio', 'Hio', 'oh', 'god', 'soo', '.white', 'out', 'fell', 'Daisuke', 'when', 'class', 'time', 'been', 'stalking', 'Other', 'Dark', 'even', 'harder', 'trying', 'conceil', 'truth', 'kiss', 'happening', 'Daisuke', 'sad', 'how', 'end', 'Risa', 'out', 'Dark', 'loved', 'grandmother', 'Risa', 'can', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'would', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'fans', 'previous', 'dvds', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'anime', 'very', 'good']",N/A

892178,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B0007WFU5G,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Daisuke must steal another statue in this volume. Satoshi meets him there and during the battle, Daisuke is sent into the future. In this future Daisuke must retrieve the gem that was inside the statue. He is guided there by a magical girl. He meets his future son on this adventure. He follows him home and sees his Mom. Upon leaving, he hears the voice of his future wife. Ig you listen closely, you get an idea who she is. Or at least you can narrow it down a bit. There is also an episode where the Harada twins, and Mio come over for a barbeque. The character development is the main focus of these episodes.This volume contained one of my favorite episodes, episode 13. The new character, Mio is kind of annoying and doesn't really add much to the plot at this time. Her purpose isn't revealed until later on. These 4 episodes are some of my favorite ones yet. This series is really growing on me and I'm starting to enjoy it a lot. But even now it's still just a little better than average. The series is only half way through. There is more drama and action still to come.",4,A Glimpse into the Future,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1080,"['Daisuke', 'must', 'steal', 'statue', 'volume', 'Satoshi', 'battle', 'Daisuke', 'sent', 'future', 'future', 'Daisuke', 'must', 'retrieve', 'gem', 'was', 'statue', 'guided', 'there', 'magical', 'girl', 'future', 'son', 'adventure', 'home', 'Mom', 'leaving', 'voice', 'future', 'wife', 'Ig', 'listen', 'closely', 'get', 'idea', 'who', 'least', 'can', 'narrow', 'down', 'bit', 'also', 'episode', 'where', 'Harada', 'twins', 'Mio', 'come', 'barbeque', 'character', 'development', 'main', 'focus', 'episodes.This', 'volume', 'contained', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'episode', '13', 'new', 'character', 'Mio', 'kind', 'annoying', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'plot', 'time', 'purpose', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'later', '4', 'episodes', 'are', 'favorite', 'ones', 'yet', 'series', 'really', 'growing', ""'m"", 'starting', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'even', 'now', 'still', 'just', 'little', 'better', 'average', 'series', 'only', 'half', 'way', 'more', 'drama', 'action', 'still', 'come']",N/A
892179,A2T7TZBOTP68C7,B0007WFU5G,"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[4, 6]","D.N. Angel - Volume 4: Magical Girls contains four episodes (13-16) of the anime series.  These episodes are slow moving, with not much action or character development, even though two new female characters are introduced.I was excited to see that the extras contained music videos.  However, the videos are a complete snore.  Endless slow panning over DNAngel backdrops, with slow piano . . . zzzzzz.  Oh, sorry, where was I?  The best extra is the continuation of the conversation between the boy who does Daisuke's voice, and the music composer.  It seems these two have really warmed up to each other, and might be good friends.Episode 13: ""Eternal Instruction"" - Dark steals a statue of a raven that contains a female creature named Towa.  Towa is pretty, and is even determined to sacrifice herself for Dark, if it means he will get back safely.Episode 14: ""New Enemy"" - It is clear that Satoshi is fighting Krad, and whatever plot his father has for him.  Meanwhile, a new American student comes to school.  Her name is Mio Hio, and my god, she is the most annoying anime character I have ever seen.  She wears the most bizarre clothes - someone must have thought they were cute - and chases Daisuke all around the school, to the astonishment of the other students.  Daisuke clearly doesn't like her, but I was annoyed that he showed no backbone and let her hang all over him.  What a wimp!Episode 15: ""BQ Panic"" - The Harada's car breaks down, and the Niwa men must entertain them for the afternoon.  It was good to see Daisuke's dad back again, even if he does not get up from his chair the whole episode.  Oh, God, Mio Hio is back!Episode 16: ""There You Are"" - This episode redeems the DVD.  Risa is determined to make herself valuable to Dark.  But apparently, Dark does not share her love for him.  This episode really captures the pain of lost love.  Up until now, Risa was pretty annoying, but I actually feel sorry for her.",3,Kind of Slow Moving,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,1938,"['D.N', 'Angel', 'Volume', '4', 'Magical', 'Girls', 'four', 'episodes', '13-16', 'anime', 'series', 'episodes', 'are', 'slow', 'moving', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'two', 'new', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced.I', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'extras', 'contained', 'music', 'videos', 'However', 'videos', 'are', 'complete', 'snore', 'Endless', 'slow', 'panning', 'DNAngel', 'backdrops', 'slow', 'piano', 'zzzzzz', 'Oh', 'sorry', 'where', 'was', 'best', 'extra', 'continuation', 'conversation', 'boy', 'who', 'Daisuke', 'voice', 'music', 'composer', 'two', 'have', 'really', 'warmed', 'up', 'other', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'friends.Episode', '13', 'Eternal', 'Instruction', 'Dark', 'statue', 'raven', 'female', 'creature', 'named', 'Towa', 'Towa', 'pretty', 'even', 'determined', 'sacrifice', 'Dark', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'safely.Episode', '14', 'New', 'Enemy', 'clear', 'Satoshi', 'fighting', 'Krad', 'plot', 'father', 'Meanwhile', 'new', 'American', 'student', 'school', 'name', 'Mio', 'Hio', 'god', 'most', 'annoying', 'anime', 'character', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'most', 'bizarre', 'clothes', 'someone', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'were', 'cute', 'chases', 'Daisuke', 'school', 'astonishment', 'other', 'students', 'Daisuke', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'annoyed', 'showed', 'backbone', 'let', 'hang', 'What', 'wimp', 'Episode', '15', 'BQ', 'Panic', 'Harada', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'Niwa', 'men', 'must', 'entertain', 'afternoon', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Daisuke', 'dad', 'back', 'again', 'even', 'not', 'get', 'up', 'chair', 'whole', 'episode', 'Oh', 'God', 'Mio', 'Hio', 'back', 'Episode', '16', 'Are', 'episode', 'DVD', 'Risa', 'determined', 'make', 'valuable', 'Dark', 'apparently', 'Dark', 'not', 'share', 'love', 'episode', 'really', 'pain', 'lost', 'love', 'now', 'Risa', 'was', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'actually', 'feel', 'sorry']",N/A
