After seeing it first in the theater and then years later on video, I could not  believe it was as funny the second (and third and fourth and fifth) times  as the first.  Don't take it seriously and you will have a wonderful time  and you will be quoting lines for days afterwards.

The impressive talent with which he plays his various roles in this film -- and the way he makes fun of his own good looks -- pushes this up to the 5-star level for  me.

I figured it  would be just another lifeless spoof that is better left off of TV, but I  was wrong (as I sometimes am).  This is just a good movie.  The best part  of this movie, in my opinion, is when the brothers go to a costume ball  with the real Zorro brother dressed as Zorro and his brother dressed as a  woman.  Here the alcalde (Zorro's enemy) starts coming on to the the  brother dressed as a woman and in the process the two steal a very  exspensive necklace belonging to the alcalde's wife.  I would reccomend  this movie to anyone, buy it and watch it, you won't be disspointed.",5,just as funny as &quot;love at first bite!&quot;,967334400,"08 27, 2000",2000,724,"['was', 'honestly', 'surprised', 'film', 'funny', 'witty', 'quick', 'really', 'did', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'would', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'lifeless', 'spoof', 'better', 'left', 'TV', 'was', 'wrong', 'sometimes', 'am', 'just', 'good', 'movie', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'opinion', 'when', 'brothers', 'go', 'costume', 'ball', 'real', 'Zorro', 'brother', 'dressed', 'Zorro', 'brother', 'dressed', 'woman', 'Here', 'alcalde', 'Zorro', 'enemy', 'coming', 'brother', 'dressed', 'woman', 'process', 'two', 'steal', 'very', 'exspensive', 'necklace', 'belonging', 'alcalde', 'wife', 'would', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'buy', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disspointed']",N/A
226480,ADU5YGENM4TC3,6300247368,Rex Bittle,"[1, 1]","This is one of my favorite comedies of all time. I think the cast is so well established and connected that the movie just works in every way. Ron Liebman's &quot;Estaban&quot; is comic genius (&quot;I have always expected  people to be nicer than me, and never in my life, have I been  disappointed&quot;). Every line is crafted for a full funny effect. George  Hamilton's follow-up genre movies never worked as as well as &quot;Zorro,  The Gay Blade.&quot; Granted, some people will have to be in the mood for  some of the silliness to be funny; but this movie always puts me in a funny  mode.
