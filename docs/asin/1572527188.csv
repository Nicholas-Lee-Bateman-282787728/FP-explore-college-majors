I like this film for a lot of personal reasons, among other ones, which is what I concentrate upon here. I was the age (maybe plus a year) of the Hungarian immigrant teen, Karchy, in the year of the film's setting at the onset of the 1960s. I recall ""Cleavageland"" (affectionately erotic name for Cleveland, the supposedly unsexy city of northern Ohio!) admittedly from a bit later, when I did my graduate studies at the beginning of the following decade (1970s) in Ohio, in Kent, not far away from Cleveland (though closer to Akron) where campus life at Kent State University certainly included a lot more sex (and pop music) than in ever-so-swinging California and Massachusetts, where I had done my undergraduate studies! Ohioans, however incongruous it may seem to some, always have been hardy and randy folk, as well as practical and pious.I remember the music really, really well and even performed r&b; and ""soul"" music in public (on double bass, sometimes on piano too) during the first half of the 1960s in a mixed black and white group, and sang and played in gospel music (in both black and white idioms). None of that amounted to much, but it did help to understand and to experience directly the power of that music. What is more to the point, and which does conjure up very effectively the heat that r&b;/soul music of those years could generate, is the song that Karchie's black friend, Amos (acted by Damen Fletcher), and his musicians perform a few times here and there in the film, and which they come to record thanks to Billy Magic's intervention, as the motion picture tells its story. I remember, too, the ""Payola"" scandals that rocked (forgive the pun!) North American news-reporting during the 1950s and 1960s. I remember Church life, too, in those last years just prior to the Second Vatican Council. It's all here in ""Telling Lies in America"", as I still recall vividly the ""look"" and ""feel"" of the time, the furniture, urban architecture and decoration, fads, male and female hair styles, clothing, etc. of 1950s and early 1960s working class America, to which this film is visually faithful to a remarkable extent. Also, of course, I remember the awkwardness of youth that Karchy (played by Brad Renfro) is living through in the film.This is a fine movie. Kevin Bacon is terrific as the sleazy disc-jockey ""Billy Magic"", who takes Karchy under his wing and makes him feel important as his assistant, introduces him to some gratifying as well as degrading things in life, only to betray his boyish trust. However, Billy does right by Karchy and by Amos, too, due to some angry (and potentially career-killing) pressure from the white kid to help his black friend, which impels Karchy to come through with the legal break (in his payola case testimony) that gets Billy Magic out of trouble, despite potential harm to Karchy himself in misrepresenting the facts. In the face of some worrisome pressure from the federal agents, intent on ruining Billy, which they exert upon Karchy and on his aging father, eventually both gain their U.S. citizenship, a kindly judge realising the human decency of the father and son, so the film ends upbeat.

187950,A1TWTULVD6F22O,1572527188,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[13, 14]","from a surprising source!  Joe Esterhaz, not a particular favorite of mine, shines in the telling of his autobiographical &quot;coming of age&quot; story as a teenage immigrant in the early 60's.  Much has been made of the immigrant experience in the earlier part of the century, but this film gives us insight into what it was like for Europeans to be transported to America's &quot;golden age&quot;.Maximillian Schell is back on the screen, and welcome as the father of Esterhaz' alter-ego, Karchy Jonas.  He is a bit puzzling until you learn that he was a highly educated man in his native Hungary, forced into menial labor in his new country of choice.  He has instilled his belief in the power of being an American citizen in his son, Karchy, played by Brad Renfro.  Renfro is believable and gives a delicious naivete to the role of Karchy, both in his words and deeds.  His relationship to an older woman, Diney (Calista Flockhart looking real, not just cute) makes sense when you see how much she yearns for his honesty and his sense of wonder.  Despite a high ethical standard set by his father, Karchy is a noted fabricator of fibs.  Everyone who hears his stock line &quot;Lots of times&quot;, knows he is lying.Enter Kevin Bacon, the perfect Svengali for a boy looking to become a man in the &quot;coolest&quot; way possible.  Bacon is a hot disc jockey, whose personal code of honor is questionable.  There is no question that this is one of his strongest performances ever. From body language to his Texas twang, his regret at how his life turned out (from a brief glimpse he shares late in the movie) makes him a standout playing an early 60's &quot;lounge lizard&quot;. Bacon has a fine portfolio of work, but this is his ultimate role.Music and set are perfect for this nostalgic look back to the 60's.

187952,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,1572527188,Mr. Cairene,"[13, 13]","When he wasn't writing trashy, empty thrillers (Basic Instinct, Jade, Sliver), Joe Eszterhaz must have been reminiscing about his childhood, modulating what would eventually become Telling Lies In America, a great, tender, beautifully rendered film. Set in the early 1960s Cleveland Ohio, it is the story of Karchy Jonas (Brad Renfro), a 17-year-old son of a Hungarian mill worker (Maximilian Schell) who had been a PHD in law in the old country. Something, Karchy never fails to mention to all the authority figures in his life. All the father wants in life is for he and his son to become naturalized citizens. Duly, Karchy goes to the expensive school the old man has obviously strained to pay for where, unpopular, he bluffs about all the things there are to bluff about. He works nights at a grocery store where Diney (Calista Flockhart) also works in a pained saddened silence. He comes on to her with his obvious bluffs, the little lies that are so obvious to the worldly Diney that she pities him, or is amused by him. At night he comes home to the little house he shares with his father, looks in the mirror and desperately tries to pronounce ""the"" which without exception always seems to come out ""da"".Its fair to say that Telling Lies In America has its fair share of cliches. Those little cornets every coming of age film has to play. You have your hypocritical teacher/priest, your unattainable female Diney, her overbearing suitor Henry (Luke Wilson) and most importantly, Billy Magic (Kevin Bacon). Magic is one of those characters most filmgoers could draw from memory; the slicked back hair, the envy inducing array of lady-friends, babbling on his radio show in his all important ""slanguage"" while he offers his listeners some ""ear conditioning"" on a particularly hot day. Karchy is in awe of him. Except that the film wastes no time in exposing Magic as damaged goods. And Bacon, in some wry moments lets some of the man's bitterness show. Magic seems to like Karchy too, maybe he sees himself in the kid who can't help but showoff all the time. Or more ominously, he sees a profitable way to employ Karchy's masterful aversion to telling the truth.The director Guy Ferland gives the film a luminous, late 50s early 60s memorabilia rich look. The score by Nicholas Pixe, a trickling of organ, is stated only in the film's key scenes. It's a good sign, especially in a period film, when the direction and the music only impress in retrospect, rather then stick out and draw attention to themselves. They work in congruence with the story. The effect is that of nostalgia. Not hokey nostalgia, but the memories of growing up, with its highs and lows compressed into a hypnotic two hours. The cliches are not cliches if they're happening to and around people you know.Telling Lies in America will touch those nerve endings that responded to Barry Levinson's Diner. Even if this one isn't as witty with its dialogue or as generous with its guffaws, I like it better. I like the way Eszterhas weaves the humor of the Spanish fly episode, the familiar tale of a self-loathing bully into the story of a kid who just wants to be liked, without stepping into one saccharine puddle. Right up to it bittersweet ending, the film never hits a false note. It maybe ironic, that Karchy who is essentially a stand in for Esztherhas learns that he ""doesn't have to showoff so much"", has spawned the writer who would write a lot of showoffy trash. You'd think that it would take a very special film for me to forgive Showgirls.

When he gets this job at the radio station, one of the things he ask for is for a young boy.  He got told to go ahead. So he picks this one 17 year old teen that is very impressionable and doesn't know anything about bribes. That is what he got hired for. This young teen goes to a Catholic private school for boys. He gets in trouble in school left and right. He even gets suspended from school. He didn't know about these bribes until his friend told him. His friend has a band and they played for Kevin Bacon. After they played at this concert, his friend told him about the money. The young boy confronted Kevin Bacon only to fine the Cleveland Police talking to Kevin Bacon about these bribes. He denied and stated that they couldn't do anything to the teen because he wasn't an adult. Back then you had to be 21 to be classified as an adult. So Kevin Bacon told that this is how it is.
