As ""rated pg-13 for frightening moments"" appeared I whispered... ""Lady in the Water."" Jonathan smiled and said, ""No way you can tell what movie it is just by the rating..."" ""LADY IN THE WATER"" appeared a few seconds later.I am a huge Shyamalan fan, as most everybody and their mother likes to say. I have been eagerly, no, EAGERLY awaiting his newest film, and what I will say - may astound you. It is rediculously rare that a movie is almost solely relying on the name of its director to succeed. Lucas, Spielberg, Lynch, Donner, Eastwood... Just a handful and a few others. But in this case we still have a relative newbie. Since 98 four films have been released that have at the core been imaginitive and original. Though, in this film a character (a critic no less) points out that, ""There is no more originality, its a sad fact but we must accept it.""I say all that to say this: I will not describe the DOZENS of steps this movie takes to get from one point to the other. I won't Describe the creatures, nor the hidden agenda for which everyone is a part of. No, I will only say that I liked the movie. But then again, I liked Solaris... as my friends fell asleep.I liked it because it is a farely pure tale of hope. (Though contrived) Also, Giamatti's character is astounding to me. And believe it or not, the movie is very funny. No, not unintentionally. Some may think so. This is not his best film by any standards. I give that award to Signs, which is tied for my all-time favorite movie (with Awakenings by the way). Everyone likes movies for different reasons, the rest you can discover.The Dislikes would have to be, and this is my soapbox, DON'T BRING OUT THE EVIL CREATURE, NOR THE GOOD CREATURE, OUT EARLY IN THE FILM. Jaws, Signs, Close Encounters... Come On!! I feel like he broke his own rules. I KNOW that he actually does this to a certain extent, but the payoff is so fast that its more of a blur than an enjoyment. I didn't like how the ""Bedtime story"" is actually an epic that has to be spoken quickly and often. It's more like ""Cliff-notes to the history of the Narf society"". I was able to keep up, but I am afraid others will have issues.There is a scene in Lady in the Water that is so touching that it stands alone as a really great moment that Paul Giamatti's character has before the end. Really powerful. Also I loved the opening shot/scene after the cave drawings. You heard right. I also loved the fact that in the movie there is no outside world, only the apartment complex. That sense of solitude is what made Signs so great.Lady in the Water is a movie that I recommend because to me, its good. Though there are times where Shyamalan blatantly has his characters speaking about THIS MOVIES could-be-problems. But hey, movies should be about the experience, and I enjoyed mine, though I am sure before Lady in the Water finishes its run there will be many a candybar scraped from the screens. Here's hoping for the next Shyamalan film, may it be a movie that people don't expect a twist... then has one anyway.",3,"E-Gad Brain, NARF!!

1027886,A144XFUV2X4CMW,B000JLTR8Q,agent_odd,"[23, 41]","'Lady in the Water' is, indeed, quite a misfire, even more so than the much maligned 'The Village.' It was the first experience at the theater in which I walked out of a film before the credits. What's wrong with this picture? Well, so many many things! Many of its faults have been mentioned by other reviewers, and boy, they weren't lying. Lady is boring, self indulgent, mostly incoherent, downright silly, uneven, and puzzling (but not in a good way!. Like 'The Village,' the dialogue is hilariously clunky and inept. Night's screenplays are often murky, peculiar, and false, particularly when he is writing dialogue for children. Lady is no exception. What is so frustrating about this film and 'The Village,' is quite simply how Night dangles the carrot right in front of your face, but you can't (strain!) quite reach it. These films beg to be loved. Honestly, there is so much potential here. Both works could be utterly engaging and inspiring, but Night's recent work sinks under the weight of his own arrogance and cleverness. I truly believe that Night thinks each movie he makes is going to revolutionize the film industry or become one of the most successful and popular pictures out there. He really really wants to be liked. I'm also certain that Night's story ideas led to self-delusion almost immediately. When you consider the plot frames of his recent work, they do sound pretty cool (mostly!). ""Hey, that could make a really cool movie!"" Unfortunately, this kind of unchecked whimsy and wonder can sink a project faster than Lucas sank the Star Wars franchise. Ultimately, a neat bedtime story or a clever twist do need to follow some of filmdoms rules unless you're Orson Welles of course. Don't deliver an exciting premise that engages and entices only to cry ""wolf"" and send your audience home with a bag filled with air i.e. 'The Village,' and don't base a movie on a bedtime story you told your kids and then make all the adults in your movie behave as though they're your kids listening with wide eyed wonderment to the tale of a sea nymph who could save the world i.e. Lady in the Water. Night expects that his audiences will react to his films as though they were tasting chocolate for the first time. He so believes in what he is doing, that I bet he has to change his entire worldview every time said audiences don't proclaim him the new messiah. He's gotta be thinking ""This should have worked. It's not me, it's them!"" Night does have talent and vision, and his early work spoke of great things to come. Unfortunately, much like the ideas that inspire him, ultimately Night and the rest of us have all been betrayed. As a note, the score and cinematography in 'Lady in the Water' are strong and perceptive and the final shot before the credits is achingly beautiful. That's about all the good things I have to say about this disaster. I am very interested to see what studio, if any, will be willing to give him a green light on the next ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" project he thinks will restore  humanity's faith in the power of cinema. For the good of all humanity Night, volunteer at a Philadelphia library telling your stories to children and leave the filmmaking in more capable hands.",1,long day's journey into Night!,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,3233,"[""'Lady"", 'Water', 'indeed', 'quite', 'misfire', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'much', 'maligned', ""'The"", 'Village', 'was', 'first', 'experience', 'theater', 'walked', 'film', 'credits', 'What', 'wrong', 'picture', 'Well', 'so', 'many', 'many', 'things', 'Many', 'faults', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'boy', 'were', ""n't"", 'lying', 'Lady', 'boring', 'self', 'indulgent', 'mostly', 'incoherent', 'downright', 'silly', 'uneven', 'puzzling', 'not', 'good', 'way', ""'The"", 'Village', 'dialogue', 'hilariously', 'clunky', 'inept', 'Night', 'screenplays', 'are', 'often', 'murky', 'peculiar', 'false', 'particularly', 'when', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'children', 'Lady', 'exception', 'What', 'so', 'frustrating', 'film', 'Village', 'quite', 'simply', 'how', 'Night', 'carrot', 'right', 'front', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'strain', 'quite', 'reach', 'films', 'beg', 'be', 'loved', 'Honestly', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'here', 'works', 'could', 'be', 'utterly', 'engaging', 'inspiring', 'Night', 'recent', 'work', 'sinks', 'weight', 'own', 'arrogance', 'cleverness', 'truly', 'believe', 'Night', 'movie', 'going', 'revolutionize', 'film', 'industry', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'popular', 'pictures', 'there', 'really', 'really', 'be', 'liked', ""'m"", 'also', 'certain', 'Night', 'story', 'ideas', 'led', 'self-delusion', 'almost', 'immediately', 'When', 'consider', 'plot', 'frames', 'recent', 'work', 'do', 'sound', 'pretty', 'cool', 'mostly', 'Hey', 'could', 'make', 'really', 'cool', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'kind', 'unchecked', 'whimsy', 'wonder', 'can', 'sink', 'project', 'faster', 'Lucas', 'sank', 'Star', 'Wars', 'franchise', 'Ultimately', 'neat', 'bedtime', 'story', 'clever', 'twist', 'do', 'need', 'follow', 'filmdoms', 'rules', ""'re"", 'Orson', 'Welles', 'course', 'Do', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'exciting', 'premise', 'only', 'cry', 'wolf', 'send', 'audience', 'home', 'bag', 'filled', 'air', 'i.e', ""'The"", 'Village', 'do', ""n't"", 'base', 'movie', 'bedtime', 'story', 'told', 'kids', 'then', 'make', 'adults', 'movie', 'behave', ""'re"", 'kids', 'listening', 'wide', 'eyed', 'wonderment', 'tale', 'sea', 'nymph', 'who', 'could', 'save', 'world', 'i.e', 'Lady', 'Water', 'Night', 'audiences', 'will', 'react', 'films', 'were', 'tasting', 'chocolate', 'first', 'time', 'so', 'what', 'doing', 'bet', 'change', 'entire', 'worldview', 'time', 'said', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'proclaim', 'new', 'messiah', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'thinking', 'should', 'have', 'worked', 'not', 'Night', 'have', 'talent', 'vision', 'early', 'work', 'spoke', 'great', 'things', 'come', 'Unfortunately', 'much', 'ideas', 'inspire', 'ultimately', 'Night', 'rest', 'have', 'been', 'betrayed', 'note', 'score', 'cinematography', ""'Lady"", 'Water', 'are', 'strong', 'perceptive', 'final', 'shot', 'credits', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'good', 'things', 'have', 'say', 'disaster', 'am', 'very', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'studio', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'green', 'light', 'next', 'seemed', 'good', 'idea', 'time', 'project', 'will', 'restore', 'humanity', 'faith', 'power', 'cinema', 'good', 'humanity', 'Night', 'volunteer', 'Philadelphia', 'library', 'telling', 'stories', 'children', 'leave', 'filmmaking', 'more', 'capable', 'hands']",N/A

I am not sure why everyone was not enjoying themselves and when I got home and read the many critical reviews posted online I began to understand.  This movie is not hitting home with a majority of the viewers, and it is too bad because on first viewing it appeared to me to be one of the best modern fairy tales that I have seen.  I believe a part of the problem is that the trailer I saw for the film misrepresents it as a horror film.  Then I believe many people are unwilling to go along with the fairy tale premise.  This is a fairy tale.  It is a bedtime story.  So sit back relax and enjoy the story.  It is a wonderful modern myth that speaks to larger issues of faith and who we are on a personel level.  The movie is wonderfully shot, told, and presented.  I enjoyed the way the story unfolds and the many very funny scenes.  It is difficult to tell this type of story without losing the audience part way through and I felt Shyamalan did a masterful job of holding things together.

I loved Unbreakable and I loved Signs... but with The Village, I was pretty disappointed... so much so that when The Lady in the Water got panned critically when it came out, I didn't even bother going to see it or even renting it when it came out on DVD.Well, fast forward a couple of years to The Happening, which I decided to go see even though it, too, was universally panned by the critics. And, sure enough, it was a tremendous disappointment.So I can;t really say what made me decide to rent and watch The Lady in the Water tonight. Maybe I just wanted to confirm my suspicion that Shyamalan had truly lost his way cinematically. Maybe I just wanted to make sure I had seen all the movies before trying to form my opinion about them.Whatever the reason... I could have not been more wrong about this movie. It has all of the things that I was missing in The Happening: great characters, great story and plot, great pacing and cinematography. I don't know why this film was panned, exactly, but it is definitely worth watching.Now I am not saying that it is a perfect movie. Some of the writing and dialogue didn't work as well as other parts and I am not real fond of the  self-reflective casting of Shyamalan in such a major role in the movie, but aside from these things I thought that the movie was truly entertaining and more than worth my time.And I learned a most important lesson that Mr. Shyamalan didn't intend for me to learn: the critics aren't always right and you should form your OWN opinion of a movie.Or maybe that was a part of his message all along....",4,Listening to the critics.....,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,1856,"['not', 'always', 'good', 'idea.Allow', 'explain.Last', 'week', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'Shyamalan', 'director', 'movie', 'managed', 'resurrect', 'faith', 'man.Like', 'most', 'people', 'became', 'Shyamalan', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'movies', 'created', 'loved', 'Unbreakable', 'loved', 'Signs', 'Village', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'Lady', 'Water', 'got', 'panned', 'critically', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'going', 'see', 'even', 'renting', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD.Well', 'fast', 'forward', 'couple', 'years', 'Happening', 'decided', 'go', 'see', 'even', 'too', 'was', 'universally', 'panned', 'critics', 'sure', 'enough', 'was', 'tremendous', 'disappointment.So', 'can', 't', 'really', 'say', 'what', 'made', 'decide', 'rent', 'watch', 'Lady', 'Water', 'tonight', 'Maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'confirm', 'suspicion', 'Shyamalan', 'had', 'truly', 'lost', 'way', 'cinematically', 'Maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'had', 'seen', 'movies', 'trying', 'form', 'opinion', 'reason', 'could', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'movie', 'things', 'was', 'missing', 'Happening', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'story', 'plot', 'great', 'pacing', 'cinematography', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'panned', 'exactly', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching.Now', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'perfect', 'movie', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'parts', 'am', 'not', 'real', 'fond', 'self-reflective', 'casting', 'Shyamalan', 'major', 'role', 'movie', 'aside', 'things', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'more', 'worth', 'time.And', 'learned', 'most', 'important', 'lesson', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'learn', 'critics', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'right', 'should', 'form', 'OWN', 'opinion', 'movie.Or', 'maybe', 'was', 'part', 'message']",N/A

Well, I say that and I must say that this particular film caused me to extract all that faith and I have not seen a single film by the director since.  That said, it bothers me that I find a sense of strange excitement when I see his name, as if maybe, just maybe this next offering will be the real follow up to `Unbreakable'.And then he releases that `Airbender' movie, further cementing my thoughts on his `has been' status.`Lady in the Water' was the last film I've seen by the `one hit wonder' director.  I must admit that when I first saw the trailer for the film I was sitting firmly on the fence.  I had just witnessed the underwhelming (yet not without a sliver of merit) `The Village' and so my expectations weren't particularly high, and yet the film looked ridiculously intriguing.  It looked dark and mysterious and developed and despite the scathing review in my EW magazine, I threw caution to the wind and jumped right in.The film is such a sloppy mess I'm just utterly disgusted.The film runs that sick line between underdeveloped and overdeveloped.  The storyline is so contrived and thick with unnecessary details that the actual depth of `story' is non-existent.  It is 100% gimmick with no real development of themes and moral.  It felt like Shyamalan was trying to write the skeletal basis for a videogame, a RPG in the vein of `Final Fantasy', which would have been ideal had this actually been a videogame, but it's not; it's a movie (and a horribly bad one at that).For those of you interested, here is a quick synopsis:A sea-nymph (also called a narf) must return to the blue world via `The Great Etlon' only after inspiring a man to write something that will change the face of the world while she contends with creatures called skrunt's who will stop at nothing to kill her, even risking their own lives at the hands of three monkey like guardians.  This narf is aided in her escape from the skrunt's by a group of humans. Each of these humans has a specific title or job. There has to be a translator, a guardian, a healer and a guild or group of people.  These characters are so convoluted that they make NO SENSE whatsoever and so while your brain is on overload trying to process the ridiculous storyline you are disappointed in the fact that nothing is strung together well enough to make it all valid.In a film that defies logic by bombarding the viewer with an `original' script (that's a stretch of the term), the film is bathed in clich&eacute;s that strip it of any true originality.It's `originally' stupid, if that helps at all.I had so much hope for Shyamalan.

1027899,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000JLTR8Q,Anton Ilinski,"[10, 19]","First off I'd like to say I'm M. Night Shyamalan's fan. I love all of his works although I haven't met a person yet who'd like them all. Some prefer ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"", but don't like ""The Village"", others adore ""Unbreakable"" while being sceptical about ""The Sixth Sense""... I love them all. And I never had prejudice about this ""twist thing"" - when I knew ""Lady in the Water"" would be a totally different picture, without usual Shyamalan's tricks, I was OK with it. A director doesn't need to repeat himself all the time and stay in the framework of the genre he created (may I suppose so) to be successful hereafter. And when I heard annoyed exclamations ""A film about a mermaid? That must be crap!"" I told those people to wait till they see the new work of almighty genius. And boy - did I make a joke on myself...You know the story, I think, so there's no need to repeat it. But I must say when I was leaving a theater I was thinking: ""So what did he want to tell us with this?"" And what's worse I still didn't come up with any answer. If ""Lady in the Water"" was supposed to be a fairy-tale for kids, it's so dull, motionless and deprived of any action that kids would be falling asleep in theaters. Besides there's a couple of really scary and jumpy moments apparently not suitable for kids. And if this is for adults... Well, what was this that I saw?! We got an unsophisticated and plain story that goes nowhere with practically nothing going on, and almost with no sense. I read multiple reviews and articles to catch this sense, to find some interpretation. And I found nothing. Just idle and void sentences about how people unlearned to see good things in life and how ""Lady in the Water"" is not about fairy-tale itself but about how people tend to percept fairy-tales. So what? Actually I didn't have a chance to see that in the film. And even if I did - what an absurd idea of a movie.When I said about the genre Shyamalan created I was talking about his pictures meant for wide audiences, his films are still pop culture but shaped to bear some higher meaning, some idea. Like ""The Sixth Sense"" was about how a person can absolutely not see what's happening around him and how a boy with seemingly big problems helped main character to discover his own, much bigger problems. ""Unbreakable"" was about how our life may not be exactly what it seems to be at first glance and about some personal overcoming. ""Signs"" was about that nothing in life is accidental, that everything has its reason and finally - that there is God. ""The Village"" was about how good intentions and seemingly right choices sometimes lead us to what we try to avoid so much. It's about life itself which has its own rules and which is doing everything its way.All Shyamalan's thoughts were always wrapped in a glittering thriller paper and it worked just fine. Shyamalan who until this moment had made only four big pictures became one of those directors who are capable to attract audience to the theaters with just his name in the credits. With all my respect I think people didn't come to see his movies because of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Mel Gibson and Adrien Brody. People were coming to see M. Night Shyamalan's films. ""Lady in the Water"" also has a great cast. So what? It just perishes in a mediocre movie with no sense, no sparkle and no life. ""Lady in the Water"" has great cinematography and music. So what? It has a lot of cinephile jokes and allusions e.g. the episodes with the critic. So what, so what, so what?There was a moment when I started thinking that maybe I'm just stupid and don't understand anything. But then I thought that usually I understand movies besides I couldn't find any intelligible opinions about ""Lady in the Water"". I'm far from thinking Shyamalan was a big soap bubble that just bursted with a thunderous bang.

1027900,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B000JLTR8Q,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[5, 10]","In a Hollywood world where no idea is original, M. Night Shyamalan captures his creativity in a bottle, putting it into words, images, and emotions. Many critics pan his movies. Why? Do they ever lack originality? No. Do they ever lack emotion? Certainly not. Though the plot of Lady in the Water may be unfathomable in terms of ""reality,"" it's original. No one knocked J.K. Rowling for creating a crazy world of wizards and muggles: M. Night deserves the same respect. So perhaps the critical dismissal of his work is something that needs to be reconsidered. This is visually and emotionally stunning film. Each frame in the film is a delicate picture, and Shyamalan's eye for detail reveals his genius.Paul Giamatti stars as Cleveland, a stuttering apartment super who dutifully does his job, never complaining and always willing to help. One night, he slips and is knocked unconscious by the pool, only to awake in his apartment with a half-naked girl sitting on the couch opposite him. The girl's name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and she tells him that she comes from the Blue World. She needs help. She must look into the eyes of ""the vessel,"" a person living in our world because this fateful meeting will awaken something inside this person, something that will be the seeds of positive change in the world. But there are evils looking to stop her. Scrunts are red-eyed creatures that live in the grass, and they'll kill Story if they get the chance.It's no secret that ""the vessel"" is a writer played by M. Night himself. And the book his character is working on is one that will not be appreciated in his time because everyone is a critic. (And the critic who lives in the apartment complex is appropriately dealt with near the end of the movie.) And everyone has something negative to say. I refuse to say anything negative about this movie. Because I can't find anything negative to say.

Night Shyamalan in Wikipedia before I started this review. I found he has done some other films, only a couple were at all successful: The Sixth Sense, Signs and The Village. Apparently his style is not all that Hollywood (and especially Disney Studios, from which he has broken away) would want. But he's an Indian-American brought up in the Philadelphia Main Line, a wealthy suburban region I know something about from my life in Pennsylvania. Most of his films have been made in and around Philadelphia.The Lady in the story is a water sprite, not a mermaid. She has legs. Very pretty ones, in fact. As the opening legend (even ahead of the title credits) tells us, the water people have tried for years to contact humans, with whom they were once in close harmony, to help us with our spiritual development. They do this at great personal risk, but they feel it is essential.Our particular Lady, whose name is Story, shows up in the swimming pool of a rather odd apartment building, populated by a truly unique cast of characters. They are of different races, different temperaments, religions and lack of same, and so on. The manager stutters terribly except when he's in the presence of Story. Story's purpose is to be seen by a writer who has an important destiny. This writer is played by Shyamalan himself, who is a very charming young man. He has been writing a book which has not come together yet, but which is a series of fragments about life and philosophy and politics and such. When he sees Story, he is able to see clearly how to put the book together. She tells him about the future of the book, and his own personal future as well.It turns out Story's story corresponds to a traditional bed-time story remembered by the old Chinese lady who lives in the building with her extremely modern daughter. Using the daughter as interpreter, the traditional tale is told, with enough clues to realize that the inhabitants of this building did not come together by accident, but specifically because they are destined to help Story to get back home.How they figure out their individual roles in the drama needed to get Story safely back to her home, and what they each discover about themselves and each other in the process, makes a charming tale that makes a very important point. We all have a role to play, a purpose to being alive, and the people around us in our lifetime are there for a reason. We come together in order to support one another's spiritual development.As I was thinking about this, I got a message from one of my favorite people on the Internet, telling me she had just been thinking about the value of the circle of friends she has made through the Internet, and sounding very much like she had just been listening to my brain, or I to hers.Perhaps in the modern world these circles exist in hyperspace as well as locally, eh?I have to give this movie three stars. I'd like to give it four, but it does seem just a little too precious at times, and a wee bit contrived.

I'm a big fan of fairy tales and have long thought that there's a lot of mileage in updating fairy tales to the modern day and attempting to tell new stories in the vein of a modern fairy tale.Unfortunately, while ""Lady in the Water"" makes a run at it, M. Night Shyamalan's (perhaps understandable) insistence on clinging to the original bedtime story he made up for his children hurts the film. For starters, Shyamalan's clearly not one of those rare people who can come up with a clever nonsense word off the top of their head, so we're stuck with ""narf,"" ""skrunt"" and ""The Great Etlon,"" the silliness of which undercut the sort of magical tone he's trying to create, although their depictions in the film undercut the silliness almost (but not quite) enough not to overcome their awful names.Secondly, things that can be taken as read in a bedtime story -- ""and the neighbors all agreed to help Cleveland Heep protect Story until she could be lifted up by the Great Etlon"" -- are jarring on the screen. Some of these cuts are restored in the deleted scenes, but there are still several outstanding instances of characters referring to bits that didn't make it to the DVD or into the final version of the script.Ultimately, the whole thing comes off like a very talented auteur not having someone around he can trust to tell him ""no."" It's the sort of thing that undoes lots of auteurs, but hopefully Shyamalan will be able to get back up after this stumble.There's a lot to like in ""Lady in the Water,"" including solid acting, otherworldly special effects, beautiful cinematography and a magical tone throughout. Unfortunately, it's done in by the very mundane problem of a Swiss cheese script.A recommended rental for fans of M.

Therefore, despite my hearing bad things about The Lady in the Water, I paid little attention and obtained the new release anyway. I regret to say that conventional wisdom was right in this instance because this production is terrible. The plot is contrived and it moves far too quickly to register as being compelling or believable. I found myself incapable of suspending disbelief due to tale's inherent ridiculousness.

1027914,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000JLTR8Q,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[6, 13]","What makes a movie watchable? Mostly it's good acting, a good screenplay, and a story that has emotional weight. So it is most strange to see the many harsh reviews of this film which I'm sure kept ticket-buyers away from the theater when professionals started pummeling LADY IN THE WATER.Entertainment Weekly said, ""[It is] Shyamalan's most alienating and self-absorbed project to date"" (as if that has anything to do with the story being told). The Philadelphia Enquirer called it, ""...extremely silly."" And the New York Observer said, ""Hollywood cannot pollute the ozone with anything more idiotic, contrived, amateurish or sub-mental than Lady in the Water.""Ouch.No wonder so few went to see it after reading things like that. I know I shied away specifically because of them. But I'd also seen a few positive reviews. Nothing big, really. I attributed most of these to Shyamalan die-hards who'd love anything put out by him regardless of subject matter. That wasn't the only thing that kept me away from the theater, though. Having fell in love with The Sixth Sense (like 99% of the rest of you), I sludged through Unbreakable, Signs, and then The Village. None of them were stellar and they lacked that umpf! we'd come to expect from M. Night. So having invested money and time in many of his previous works, I was extremely hesitant to spend more of either on something that many ""respected"" reviewers found, to say the least, tepid.So when I plopped in the DVD this week and started watching Lady in the Water, I was prepared for the worst. Surprisingly, that's not what I found.If films are supposed to be about entertainment, then Lady in the Water most certainly meets that challenge. Not only that, but I found Paul Giamati's performance to be outstanding. Not since Sideways had I enjoyed a Giamati film so much. He, in fact, carried most of the movie with his excellent portrayal of Cleveland Heep, an apartment manager who one night finds a narf (a water creature) swimming in the compound's pool. The narf is named Story and is played by Bryce Dallas Howard (the blind girl from M. Night's The Village). The movie delves deep into Fairytale-Land and plants the audience firmly in its belief structure. The fact that Story has shown herself to Cleveland is very important in the film, and it shows us that this is something special. Cleveland is given the opportunity to heal himself through Story's visit, and in the process bring together everyone in the apartment complex. All of the people within the apartment building have been drawn here for this one event: to see a narf safely on her way to becoming a segue between the blue world (i.e., the narfs) and the human one.The quirky, quaint, and scarey intermingle here as we see a movie reviewer monologuing during a funny yet frightening scene, watch Cleveland come to terms with the death of his family from years before, and witness the battle between humps of grass that come to life with razor sharp teeth and threaten to destroy Story.The heart-wrenching scene between Cleveland, the apartment building's occupants, and the mortally wounded Story has such impact as to cause most watchers to reach for the tissue box.The ending is extremely satisfying and filmed perfectly. When Story has to leave, she does so in fairytale fashion.This is a great story. My only regret now is that I didn't see it in the theater. I'm sure the sound and scenery were even better on the big screen.I also have to wonder about Warner Brothers and the ""falling out"" that they had with M. Night over the film during production. Budget, screenplay and time constraints weighed heavy on all of the parties involved and I think this may have had an impact on reviewers and how the film was marketed. Are some reviewers leery of praising a film from a large studio when that studio has problems with a director/writer? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But the negative reviews of the film seem far out of proportion with what I watched.Lady in the Water was well acted, had a decent screenplay, and told a great story.

1027918,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000JLTR8Q,Boss Fan,"[4, 11]","This is a movie that is likely to, and judging by the reviews from both movie-goers and the mainstream critics, has, polarized audiences and critics alike.  It is not as bad as what some will lead you to believe, but I can't see too many people expecting another ""Sixth Sense,"" or a scary movie of any kind, coming away very happy.  If you are one of the people left feeling unimpressed, or worse, by ""The Village"" and were hoping this movie was going to go back to the type of films Night did early in his career, ""Lady in the Water"" plays like a big middle finger aimed right at you.  It goes even further away from the type of films that put Night on the map, and more towards the mythical and spiritual anecdotes incorporated in ""Signs"" and ""The Village.""  Only this time they do not bubble beneath the surface, easy for those who want them to pick up on, but easier for those who don't to ignore; as they were in the past.  Now they are front, center and in your face.  If you thought ""swing away"" was corny, you ain't seen nothin' yet.Of course, if people just expect a redux of ""The Sixth Sense"" time after time, then that is their problem and their loss.  You should not go see a movie just because you are hoping it will be like the last movie the director made.  However, when a director has painted himself into a corner by making a career out of delivering twisty and scary fare, you have to warn your audience that this time things will be different.  The marketing for this one certainly didn't do that.  Warner Bros., eager to cash in on the M. Night's name and mystique, promoted this as another film like his others (creepy and with a secret of some kind).  Night himself did a little spin-control in his press appearances hinting not to expect a big twist ending and such, but you would have to be the kind of movie-goer that makes sure to read up on such things, or just happened to tune into Letterman or something the night M. is there talking about the film.  The average movie-goer who sees the misleading previews and/or Night's name attached would be forgiven for expecting something different than what this film delivers.I remember seeing a teaser poster months and months ago with water footprints on a wooden floor, the title of the film, and the tagline, ""A Bedtime Story from M. Night Shymalan.""  I was giddy with excitement that, after the disappointment that was ""The Village,"" Night was going to be back with a vengeance with, based on the eerily  foreboding poster, what might be his most accomplished and haunting work yet.  I didn't necessarily need the twist ending, but I was looking forward to a masterfully demented bedtime story.  Let's face it; bedtime stories are pretty creepy anyway.  Can you imagine what a director like Night could do with ""Hansel and Gretel?""  The possibilities seemed endless.But months passed and here and there I would hear new things about the project and I eventually realized that my creepy nightmare of a bedtime story was not where this film was going.  I accepted that and was still eager to see what Night had in store.  Others were probably not as fortunate; blindly walking in to this film, ready to jump, jolt, and hide their eyes and cover their ears as they have done so many times before at one of Night's movies.  These are the people who will hate this movie.  Night's loyalist fans will say he has a right to try something else.  They are correct:  he has a right.  But then the question becomes, just as it was for his spookier fare, is this a good movie?I've read lot of negative reviews, and I can see where they are coming from, but the best way to look at ""Lady in the Water"" is as a fantasy - NOT a scary movie (though there are quite a few of Night's trademark eerie shots and images).  Think something like ""E.T.""  I'm not saying it is as good as ""E.T."" or bears any plot resemblance to it, but that is the sortta place you need to put your mind in order to enjoy this.  Anyone going in thinking that this movie is bound in any kind of reality will find everything here laughable.I will dispense with the plot outline in this review since it has been written in many ways in all the reviews here, but the cliff notes version  is:  Am apartment complex superintendent named Cleveland (Paul Giamatti, seemingly incapable of giving a bad performance) discovers a narf (a mythical water creature played by ""The Village's"" Bryce Dallas Howard - daughter of director Ron) in the swimming pool and soon learns, through an ancient story, what she is, why she may be important to all of humanity, and why he, and a large group of caricatures that are the other tenants in the complex, must help her before she can save us all.That is an interesting hook for what could still be a creepy, or at least somewhat twisted, fantasy.  The movie seems to be half-heartedly trying to be just that.  There are creatures out to stop the lady in the water from returning home that are well conceived:  fun to look at and with interesting traits.  And there are other creatures that are the lady's protectors which the same compliments can be said about.  All of this; the plot summary I gave and these creatures and their motivations, are well-conceived, interesting, and have potential to make for a great story (the bedtime story ala M. Night that had been playing in my head since seeing that great poster).  And for awhile the film seems to be off and running in that direction.  But then a funny thing happens.  The movie gets so bogged down in its own plot and mysticism and messages that some of the suspense starts to drain away.  And as it goes still further along, the plot keeps unraveling adding on characters and explanations and red herrings until it all becomes so convoluted that you're left thinking less would have been so much more in this case.It's to Night and his talented cast's credits that movie still manages to be rather intriguing and done with an effective sense of style, even as you feel it spiraling out of control.  As we start to realize all of Night's metaphors in the script for our own lives and what we could/should do to make ourselves and the world better, much of this starts to get pretty heavy-handed.  But the script has plenty of levity throughout and plenty of reminders that this is indeed a fantasy and a bedtime story.  The characters keep saying things like 'what happens next in the story,' and 'it's just a story;' although it is pretty easy for the building super to convince all the tenants that this bedtime story has come to life and, furthermore, helping this supposed sea creature is indeed something that is important for our very existence.  Almost no one even raises an eyebrow and not one of the people laugh in his face.  Perhaps that is another metaphor from Night on how we should all love thy neighbor and help a friend in need.  We would all do better to have neighbors such as these.  Again, it is in these moments one needs to remember ""Lady in the Water is a fairytale and not say things like, ""yeah, right, that would never happen,"" or ""who does/says that?""Such points are moot here, but even though you shouldn't expect reality from this story, but you should expect the rules of what makes a good movie to apply.  It's up to you if you think it is or isn't, but besides the performances and a potential-filled premise that had me for more than half the film, ""Lady in the Water"" just gets too muddled, talky and ultimately ends a little unsatisfyingly.  What about this waterworld the creature comes from?  We never see it, nor is it really described in any detail.  How does she get from there to a concrete pool?  Even ""E.T."" had a spaceship to explain how he got around.This is also Night's most self-serving film to date.  Casting himself (in a fairly large part) as a writer who will one day save the world isn't exactly subtle (even Mel Gibson didn't cast himself as Jesus).  And having a film critic character act mostly like a jerk and be the only character that does not have an apostle-like destiny or any part in helping the water nymph is rather transparent too.  But even with these ham-fisted choices, Night manages to give the critic character good dialogue and he himself does a fine job in the role he has written as his own.  Too bad it's such an obvious bit of self gratification.I don't want to be cynical here.  Night's intentions and metaphors are good, often moving.  But I think most of that has to do with the conviction of the cast and their solid performances, more than the script itself.  You care about them despite some of the sillier stuff Night has come up with to have them do and say.  Night is a terrific director, but I think he should maybe start thinking about directing other people's scripts from time to time.  Anyone who can turn out scripts like those for ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" is definitely a sturdy writer, but he hasn't delivered on the promises of those scripts since.  Hopefully he has said what he feels he needs to for a while and will direct some different types of things from some different writers the next few times out (imagine giving a film in a tired franchise to rework).  As a director, Night is as sharp as he ever was, but as a writer, with ""Lady in the Water,"" his heart is in the right place, but his head is all over the place.And I hate to keep going back to what would have made this movie scarier, because defenders of this will say that is not what Night wanted to do this time.  But less face it; if you're going to fill the script and screen with stalking monsters, mythical creatures, eerie music, shots and locations, at least three gotcha! moments that are intended to make the audience jump and hang a consistent feeling of dread over everything, you pretty much are trying to make a scary movie.  But what do you get when you try to make a scary movie yet, at the same time, not make a scary movie?You can't have it both ways, M.",3,"I'm torn here.  M.

1027919,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B000JLTR8Q,Brad Baker,"[7, 13]","One boring Wednesday afternoon, I drifted into the brand new local movie theater. I got my hot-dog, and looked for a good flick. Maybe any flick.  Down at the end of the corridor, nobody was going in to see ""Lady in the Water"".  I was. M. Night Shyamalan became famous for directing the classic ""Sixth Sense"".  He seemed to stumble with the still interesting ""The Village"".  Now, he has parted ways with Disney Studios. So what.  With a clearly reduced budget, Shyamalan has soared to new hights with the mystical ""Lady in the Water"".  Cleveland Heep(""Sideways""' Paul Giamatti) is a former practising doctor, hiding-out as a the landlord of a multi-level, crumbling, seedy apartment complex. A stranger killed his wife(and his life?), and to find closure, he has down-sized to become the complex's fix-it man and manager.  Rotating from apartment to apartment, Heep repairs light-bulbs, and berates lazy teenagers.  ""Don't just sit around and smoke cigarettes(and pot)!"" he warns.  He introduces himself to a mysterious new tenant, a quiet, retrospective movie-critic(Bob Balaban). Finally, Heep returns to his sloppy, dingy bachelor room, turning on the TV. He flops down on the ratty sofa. Then he notices the blonde, teen-age girl in his bed.  She seems to be only half-dressed. The girl only mumbles to Heep, grasping his arm, and asking for help. ""Where are you from?"" Heep asks. ""The Blue World"" she answers. This is the opening to ""Lady in the Water"", an unheralded instant minor classic.  Bordering on the absurd, ""Lady"" is the admitted fairy-tale of Story(Bryce Dallas), a young waif deposited on Earth to complete a nebulous task, and achieve admission back to her former dimension.  She must avoid the skulking, slivering wolf-dogs lurking in the apartment grasses(conveniently over-grown), and enlist a Reader, a Healer, and other appointed helpers to define her role(and their's), and somehow overcome cosmic forces trying to kill her.  The whole 90-minute-movie unfolds in the complex, a grainy, apparently authentic building; all too familiar to those of us who once could afford nothing else. Heep tries desperately to un-ravel Story's mesmerizing problem, as he clearly is drawn closer to the pretty blonde just half his age.  In many scenes of apartment life, a black-and-white TV blares Middle-East battle reports from off in the distance. Bombs explode on the screen, providing an unsettling reminder of our precarious times. Perhaps this is the real ""horror"" of ""Lady in the Water"".  After saving Story, Heep tearfully holds her in his arms, and says: ""You gave me purpose!  You saved my life.."" Pot-bellied, bald, middle-aged Paul Giamatti is stunning as Heep. Here is our Every-Man, confused and unsure, stung by new direction in his life. M. Night Shyamalan has given us a superb modern children's fable; one all of us children will understand.  The small part of the Writer(Vick) is played by M.

1027920,A8PP8NPRJSAKO,B000JLTR8Q,Brazilian Jazzaholic!,"[6, 11]","M. Night Shyamalan's movies tend to trigger one of 3 knee-jerk reactions in viewers: (1) you love them; (2) you hate them; or (3) you don't understand them.  After seeing some abysmal critics' reviews for LITW, I honestly went into the theater with pretty low expectations, and was pleasantly, and impressively, surprised by this movie.  LITW is truly a modern fairy tale / bedtime story for grown-ups.  It is a cerebral fantasy movie that demands equal parts thinking-cap and imagination from the viewer, but if you are willing to let Shyamalan lead you through the story, the rewards are well worth it.  On the other hand, if you are not prepared to follow the abundant nuances, metaphors, symbolism, and subtle character developments in LITW, and are looking for a cut-and-dry thriller or light weekend fare, then this is not your movie.  I think that some viewers (and critics) didn't really understand LITW, because they wouldn't let themselves take in all of the stylistic originality and artistry that the movie has to offer.I won't spoil the movie (for those who haven't seen it), by describing the plot/character details here.  But, suffice it to say that you are so busy becoming engrossed in the characters and the story, and trying to figure out the riddles in this movie, that it is only at the end that you realize the LITW has left you with a lesson that makes you think well after leaving the movie theater.  The movie's subtle, but powerful messages about true leadership, catharsis through altruism, the power of human togetherness, and self-discovery resonated with me and other viewers who were willing to open their minds enough to see them. LITW is not a movie that can be enjoyed ""on the surface.""  You have to either totally immerse yourself in the movie, or not watch it at all.  Otherwise, you're left with a sense of dissatisfaction that some viewers have reported feeling at the end of the movie.  On a related side-note, I can't help but think that the way many negative movie critics reacted to LITW had, at least, something to do with Shyamalan's tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the movie-critic character in the movie.  [*MINOR SPOILER BEGINS HERE*] After all, the movie critic is a know-it-all who almost derails the other characters' efforts with his high-and-mighty (and ultimately WRONG) advice.[*MINOR SPOILER ENDS HERE*]  Shyamalan had the guts to slyly thumb his nose at the movie-critic establishment, and was, of course rewarded with excessively bitter reviews from some of the targets of his fun-poking.  Mere coincidence?  I think not.I am typically not one for fairy tale or fantasy movies, because the plots and characters seem so far removed from reality that I can't relate to them.  For that reason, neither the Lord of the Rings nor the Harry Potter films moved me much.  I think it says alot about LITW and Shyamalan's unique style that I actually came to CARE about the characters and the outcome of their story.  Balancing suspension of disbelief with elements of reality is a difficult and delicate task; one which I think Shyamalan pulls off very well with LITW.  The characters all seem so real (like people you might find in your neighborhood), but yet you don't find it odd that they all participate so whole-heartedly in a scenario that goes far beyond the logical and explainable.  If J.K. Rowling can invent ""muggles,"" why shouldn't Shyamalan have his ""narfs"" and ""scrunts,"" especially when he uses them to such wonderful effect?At the end of this movie, the kid in me wanted to cheer.  Shyamalan achieves a fairly-tale ending without melodrama or sensationalism, while still leaving the viewer feeling positive and uplifted.  After all, isn't that the whole point of a fairy tale?  ;-)",4,"An imaginative, cerebral fantasy!

1027921,A3H4TIVTTA5IBB,B000JLTR8Q,Brian A. Wolters,"[2, 7]","I would first like to say that I am a huge M. Night Shyamalan fan. I didn't see Sixth Sense until it was on DVD and once I did, I was hooked. I've enjoyed each film he has directed since then, including the much maligned ""The Village."" I've been eagerly awaiting Lady in the Water ever since I heard about it. The teaser last winter made me even more curious and I couldn't wait for this movie with a sense of wonder. After finally viewing the movie, I have to say that M.Night has a major mess on his hands.The movie is about an apartment maintenance man named Cleveland Heep whom seems to have a very dull life. He is good at what he does but you can't help but feel that he wants more. One night, when looking for people swimming after hours, he discovers a girl in the pool. Startled and clumsy, he falls into the pool and nearly drowns until he discovers himself back in bed with the girl in his house. She is a Narf from the Blue World who wants to return to her world and avoid the Scrunts (wolf like monster) as she tries to get back via the great eagle. She is to assist Cleveland in assembling a Guild to help her return. Little does Cleveland know that she is also there to help him overcome his grief of losing his family and quitting his job as a doctor. I have a good imagination and I was ready to see how all of this plays out. The child inside me was waiting for a payoff. I am sad to say, I never get it.The movie is a complete, convoluted mess and a huge failure of execution. Let me begin with the characters. The supporting characters in the movie were annoying stereotypes of all kinds of ethnic backgrounds. The young Asian woman, who conveniently told the story of the Narf's by interpreting for her mother was incredibly annoying. It would seem like if the story needed more explanation, she conveniently shows up to tell us more, even being available while at a dance club. Then we have the guy who is only working out one side of his body. He serves no real purpose until the end and when he does, it is completely laughable and not worth the moment of ""awe"" as the movie makes it. Then we have the movie critic, who seems to be there to serve as M.Nights poke at critics at his past movies. M.Night is also playing a supporting role but because he is the director who makes clever appearances, I kept waiting for something magical to happen with his character and we don't get it. He needs to stick with Hitchcock like appearances.The story itself unfolds slowly but when it should be getting more involving and interesting, it simply gets messier. You meet all of the characters in the film and you notice they have certain traits to their personality. Those traits are to be put to use in the Guild that Cleveland is trying to assemble. When it comes time to put it all together, you are waiting for something meaningful to happen and it just doesn't come together. Take the pool party scene. Has there been any scene in the past several years in movies as confusing and perplexing as this? They were there to protect the Lady yet stupid things happen. A girl drops her mirror who is to be watching for the Scrunt. The movie critic shows up and is given horrible dialogue. A band is to be playing inside but doesn't start on time. As a result of the confusion, the Lady is taken by the Scrunt and nearly killed. Then they realize the Guild is not correct and between a kid reading things in cereal boxes and his Dad finding clues in crosswords to shifting people and roles in Guild, I was simply confused because of the poor execution. We finally get one good scene when Cleveland has his catharsis and it was able to induce tears in audience members. But it simply comes back to the standard M.Night protagonist whom is trying to deal with personal tragedies. We saw this in Signs, The Village and again in this film. While that is a good thing to build a movie around, third time around is one too many. Finally, when things do play out as they should, we are scratching our heads and thinking ""Are we too stupid to understand this film, or is the film too stupid to understand.""I've noticed many fan reviews of this film and many liked it but I do tend to think they are way to kind to allow M.Night to have a folly. Lady in the Water is his first folly and I hope he will recover and wow us with his next film.",1,Shyamalan's First Mistake,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,4344,"['would', 'first', 'like', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'DVD', 'once', 'did', 'was', 'hooked', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'film', 'directed', 'then', 'including', 'much', 'maligned', 'Village', ""'ve"", 'been', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'Lady', 'Water', 'ever', 'heard', 'teaser', 'last', 'winter', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'curious', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'sense', 'wonder', 'finally', 'viewing', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'M.Night', 'major', 'mess', 'hands.The', 'movie', 'apartment', 'maintenance', 'man', 'named', 'Cleveland', 'Heep', 'whom', 'have', 'very', 'dull', 'life', 'good', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'more', 'One', 'night', 'when', 'looking', 'people', 'swimming', 'hours', 'girl', 'pool', 'Startled', 'clumsy', 'pool', 'nearly', 'drowns', 'back', 'bed', 'girl', 'house', 'Narf', 'Blue', 'World', 'who', 'return', 'world', 'avoid', 'Scrunts', 'wolf', 'monster', 'get', 'back', 'great', 'eagle', 'assist', 'Cleveland', 'assembling', 'Guild', 'help', 'return', 'Little', 'Cleveland', 'know', 'also', 'there', 'help', 'overcome', 'grief', 'losing', 'family', 'quitting', 'job', 'doctor', 'have', 'good', 'imagination', 'was', 'ready', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'child', 'was', 'waiting', 'payoff', 'am', 'sad', 'say', 'never', 'get', 'it.The', 'movie', 'complete', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'huge', 'failure', 'execution', 'Let', 'begin', 'characters', 'supporting', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'annoying', 'stereotypes', 'kinds', 'ethnic', 'backgrounds', 'young', 'Asian', 'woman', 'who', 'conveniently', 'told', 'story', 'Narf', 'interpreting', 'mother', 'was', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'would', 'seem', 'story', 'needed', 'more', 'explanation', 'conveniently', 'up', 'tell', 'more', 'even', 'being', 'available', 'while', 'dance', 'club', 'Then', 'have', 'guy', 'who', 'only', 'working', 'out', 'one', 'side', 'body', 'real', 'purpose', 'end', 'when', 'completely', 'laughable', 'not', 'moment', 'awe', 'movie', 'Then', 'have', 'movie', 'critic', 'who', 'be', 'there', 'serve', 'M.Nights', 'poke', 'critics', 'past', 'movies', 'M.Night', 'also', 'playing', 'supporting', 'role', 'director', 'who', 'clever', 'appearances', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'magical', 'happen', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'stick', 'Hitchcock', 'appearances.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'slowly', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'getting', 'more', 'involving', 'interesting', 'simply', 'messier', 'meet', 'characters', 'film', 'notice', 'have', 'certain', 'traits', 'personality', 'traits', 'are', 'be', 'put', 'use', 'Guild', 'Cleveland', 'trying', 'assemble', 'When', 'time', 'put', 'together', 'are', 'waiting', 'something', 'meaningful', 'happen', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'Take', 'pool', 'party', 'scene', 'Has', 'there', 'been', 'scene', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'movies', 'confusing', 'perplexing', 'were', 'there', 'protect', 'Lady', 'yet', 'stupid', 'things', 'happen', 'girl', 'mirror', 'who', 'be', 'watching', 'Scrunt', 'movie', 'critic', 'up', 'given', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'band', 'be', 'playing', ""n't"", 'start', 'time', 'result', 'confusion', 'Lady', 'taken', 'Scrunt', 'nearly', 'killed', 'Then', 'realize', 'Guild', 'not', 'correct', 'kid', 'reading', 'things', 'cereal', 'boxes', 'Dad', 'finding', 'clues', 'crosswords', 'shifting', 'people', 'roles', 'Guild', 'was', 'simply', 'confused', 'poor', 'execution', 'finally', 'get', 'one', 'good', 'scene', 'when', 'Cleveland', 'catharsis', 'was', 'able', 'induce', 'tears', 'audience', 'members', 'simply', 'back', 'standard', 'M.Night', 'protagonist', 'whom', 'trying', 'deal', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'saw', 'Signs', 'Village', 'again', 'film', 'good', 'thing', 'build', 'movie', 'around', 'third', 'time', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'Finally', 'when', 'things', 'do', 'play', 'out', 'should', 'are', 'scratching', 'heads', 'thinking', 'Are', 'too', 'stupid', 'understand', 'film', 'film', 'too', 'stupid', 'understand', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'many', 'fan', 'reviews', 'film', 'many', 'liked', 'do', 'tend', 'think', 'are', 'way', 'kind', 'allow', 'M.Night', 'have', 'folly', 'Lady', 'Water', 'first', 'folly', 'hope', 'will', 'recover', 'wow', 'next', 'film']",N/A

1027923,A26GI8N3ADWGZ5,B000JLTR8Q,"bsy ""bern""","[3, 6]","Expecting the worst often leaves you pleasantly surprised. Was ready for a dreary few hours watching a mercilessly slammed film but actually felt a little inspired by the end.Premise-wise, quite enticing. Humans need guidance from those of the Blue World (sea nymphs) to effect a beneficial change in society, to provide hope for a more peaceful, benevolent world. However, it's been thousands of years since humans have closed their minds to the Blue World so they need to renew their efforts by sending young ones to the world of humans, each to find their `chosen ones'. Once found, the encounter will elicit a profound change in the human chosen one, leading humans down a path of profound change. Of course they are enemies who seek to destroy the young sea nymphs. This fable unfolds in a modern day apartment complex with Giamatti as the concierge and Howard as Story, the sea nymph.This film has more than its share of weaknesses. For me it was the process of how the bedtime story unfolds (piecemeal to say the least) through the Korean mother in the building. Rather erratic and at times unconvincing as no one else seems to know of it as it is presented as an Asian bedtime story. Yet based on the opening narration, one would expect it to be more archetypical in nature. Another complaint; the names used in the story. Narfs? Scrunts? Odd for an Asian bedtime story. This also took away credibility. Surely, Shyamalan could have come up with something better than that. The sworn enemies of the Narfs, the Scrunts, looked kind of cheap and were hardly frightening. Last complaint, the process in which the tenants determine who and how to help Story return home. Disjointed.While I didn't like the way the bedtime story unfolded from the Korean mother, her and her daughter provided the comic relief. A little irritating but quite funny. The daughter's manner of speech and her lines were hilarious. Looks like Shyamalan has had first hand experience with Korean interaction. The other tenants who play a pivotal role are the brother and sister. Quite cute together like most of the other tenants: the Italian family, the body builder, movie critic, the animal lover, the wordsmith, etc.However, what produced the strongest reaction was the premise of the chosen one's book whose encounter with the Narf will enable him to finish the book and ultimately lead to profound change. The idea that a messiah, who upon reading the chosen one's book as a child will lead humanity to a brighter future, provides hope to the tenants, namely Mr, Heep, the concierge played well by Giamatti who for reasons I won't disclose here, is a shell of his former self, lost and disillusioned like so many of the tenants. Shyamalan is well familiar with the themes of redemption and profound change.Like Giamatti, Howard and the rest of the cast, while providing no mind-blowing performances, all turn in solid efforts that ultimately make this worth watching. Howard as a lot of potential, it's easy to see that and I think she has a great future ahead of her. Nice to see Jeffrey Wright and Mary Beth Hurt as well though in minimal roles.Let's keep in mind that this is essentially a children's movie so using terms like Narfs and Scrunts is understandable. It is after all based on a children's bedtime story. And while I would've liked to have known more about the Blue World, the focus is on our world not theirs. Ordinary people who it turns out are the main protagonists in a battle between the dark and the light. A good message for youngsters; that though ordinary we may appear, we are all capable of heroic efforts when called upon, that we carry within us an innate potential to do great things even if we are initially oblivious. When we are called upon to act, it ultimately leads to redemption and a renewed purpose in life. Perhaps not Shyamalan's best but still a nice fantasy for children and yes, even some adults.",3,The Road to Humanity's Salvation but with some Waves,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,3925,"['Expecting', 'worst', 'often', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Was', 'ready', 'dreary', 'few', 'hours', 'watching', 'mercilessly', 'slammed', 'film', 'actually', 'felt', 'little', 'inspired', 'end.Premise-wise', 'quite', 'enticing', 'Humans', 'need', 'guidance', 'Blue', 'World', 'sea', 'nymphs', 'effect', 'beneficial', 'change', 'society', 'provide', 'hope', 'more', 'peaceful', 'benevolent', 'world', 'However', 'been', 'thousands', 'years', 'humans', 'have', 'closed', 'minds', 'Blue', 'World', 'need', 'renew', 'efforts', 'sending', 'young', 'ones', 'world', 'humans', 'find', 'chosen', 'ones', 'Once', 'found', 'encounter', 'will', 'elicit', 'profound', 'change', 'human', 'chosen', 'one', 'leading', 'humans', 'down', 'path', 'profound', 'change', 'course', 'are', 'enemies', 'who', 'seek', 'destroy', 'young', 'sea', 'nymphs', 'fable', 'unfolds', 'modern', 'day', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Giamatti', 'concierge', 'Howard', 'Story', 'sea', 'nymph.This', 'film', 'more', 'share', 'weaknesses', 'was', 'process', 'how', 'bedtime', 'story', 'unfolds', 'piecemeal', 'say', 'least', 'Korean', 'mother', 'building', 'erratic', 'times', 'unconvincing', 'one', 'else', 'know', 'presented', 'Asian', 'bedtime', 'story', 'based', 'opening', 'narration', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'more', 'archetypical', 'nature', 'complaint', 'names', 'used', 'story', 'Narfs', 'Scrunts', 'Odd', 'Asian', 'bedtime', 'story', 'also', 'took', 'away', 'credibility', 'Surely', 'Shyamalan', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'better', 'sworn', 'enemies', 'Narfs', 'Scrunts', 'looked', 'kind', 'cheap', 'were', 'hardly', 'frightening', 'Last', 'complaint', 'process', 'tenants', 'determine', 'who', 'how', 'help', 'Story', 'return', 'home', 'Disjointed.While', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'bedtime', 'story', 'unfolded', 'Korean', 'mother', 'daughter', 'provided', 'comic', 'relief', 'little', 'irritating', 'quite', 'funny', 'daughter', 'manner', 'speech', 'lines', 'were', 'hilarious', 'Shyamalan', 'had', 'first', 'hand', 'experience', 'Korean', 'interaction', 'other', 'tenants', 'who', 'play', 'pivotal', 'role', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'Quite', 'cute', 'together', 'most', 'other', 'tenants', 'Italian', 'family', 'body', 'builder', 'movie', 'critic', 'animal', 'lover', 'wordsmith', 'etc.However', 'what', 'produced', 'strongest', 'reaction', 'was', 'premise', 'chosen', 'one', 'book', 'encounter', 'Narf', 'will', 'enable', 'finish', 'book', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'profound', 'change', 'idea', 'messiah', 'who', 'reading', 'chosen', 'one', 'book', 'child', 'will', 'lead', 'humanity', 'brighter', 'future', 'hope', 'tenants', 'namely', 'Mr', 'Heep', 'concierge', 'played', 'well', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'reasons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disclose', 'here', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'lost', 'disillusioned', 'so', 'many', 'tenants', 'Shyamalan', 'well', 'familiar', 'themes', 'redemption', 'profound', 'change.Like', 'Giamatti', 'Howard', 'rest', 'cast', 'providing', 'mind-blowing', 'performances', 'turn', 'solid', 'efforts', 'ultimately', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'Howard', 'lot', 'potential', 'easy', 'see', 'think', 'great', 'future', 'ahead', 'Nice', 'see', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt', 'as', 'well', 'minimal', 'roles.Let', 'keep', 'mind', 'essentially', 'children', 'movie', 'so', 'using', 'terms', 'Narfs', 'Scrunts', 'understandable', 'based', 'children', 'bedtime', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'more', 'Blue', 'World', 'focus', 'world', 'not', 'theirs', 'Ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'out', 'are', 'main', 'protagonists', 'battle', 'dark', 'light', 'good', 'message', 'youngsters', 'ordinary', 'may', 'appear', 'are', 'capable', 'heroic', 'efforts', 'when', 'called', 'upon', 'carry', 'innate', 'potential', 'do', 'great', 'things', 'even', 'are', 'initially', 'oblivious', 'When', 'are', 'called', 'act', 'ultimately', 'redemption', 'renewed', 'purpose', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'Shyamalan', 'best', 'still', 'nice', 'fantasy', 'children', 'yes', 'even', 'adults']",N/A

1027926,A388ZDFVK72VCA,B000JLTR8Q,"Cale E. Reneau ""Mound of Wires""","[3, 7]","M. Night Shyamalan has never really been my favorite writer/director. Don't get me wrong, he's a pretty genius guy, and incredibly imaginative (minus ""Signs""), but it has always seemed to me like his movies have focused a little too hard on the horror genre to be classics in my book. Yes, I have a book. However, I can honestly say that I am a huge fan of his storytelling. This is where M. Night Shyamalan shines. ""Lady in the Water"" is the writer/director/actor's latest attempt at greatness, and, next to ""The Sixth Sense,"" it just may be his best.The story revolves around a man by the name of Cleveland Heep, a maintenance man at a Philedelphia apartment complex filled with all sorts of eccentric characters. There's the single father with his son, a seemingly caffiene-addicted Asian and her overbearing mother, a movie critic who thinks he's a genius, and of course a ridiculous 20-something who insists on only working out one side of his body. While these characters may seem unnecessary in the beginning, they eventually all play a somewhat vital role in the story.Heep, however, is a truly engaging character right from the start. A single, middle-aged, man with a terrible stutter, he is portrayed as a man who is respected by the people he serves, yet also rejected by them. In his small apartment, he spends his nights alone until one night he encounters a, as the title hints, lady in the water. Her name is ""Story,"" and her character is very mysterious to Cleveland who can't seem to comprehend who she is and why she has suddenly appeared in his life.As the story progresses, secrets are revealed and the people of the apartments come together to help Story, who is apparently a mythological creature who has lost her way from home. Paul Giamatti's performance is Oscar-worthy, and he does a phenominal job of portraying all of the different layers of his character.Shyamalan branches out a bit this time around, as ""Lady in the Water"" tends to focus much more on fantasy and true storytelling than horror or thrills. However, it seems as if ""Lady in the Water"" is a film that doesn't quite know what it wants to be. There are times when you swear you were watching a thriller, and other times when the movie trys too hard (WAY too hard) to be a comedy. While some of these scenes are okay, at other times they are entirely distracting and unnecessary to the plot as a whole. This is really my only big complaint about the movie. It is a beautiful film, yes, but it can also be a bit deterring at times, and many Shyamalan fans might be turned off from this.Overall, ""Lady in the Water"" is a fairly well put-together film about finding a place and a role in this crazy world. In that, the film does a fantastic job. Despite minor annoyances along the way, the sheer imagination of the story, and the lovable characters that fill it, make it a tough movie to not enjoy. This is one of the most creative movies I've ever seen, and I'd love to see it again.Acting: 5 out of 5 StarsDirecting: 4 out of 5 StarsWriting: 3 out of 5 StarsOverall: 4 out of 5 Stars",4,"Unique, engaging, and beautiful!",1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,3074,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'favorite', 'writer/director', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'pretty', 'genius', 'guy', 'incredibly', 'imaginative', 'Signs', 'always', 'seemed', 'movies', 'have', 'focused', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'horror', 'genre', 'be', 'classics', 'book', 'Yes', 'have', 'book', 'However', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'storytelling', 'where', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Lady', 'Water', 'writer/director/actor', 'latest', 'attempt', 'greatness', 'next', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'best.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'man', 'name', 'Cleveland', 'Heep', 'maintenance', 'man', 'Philedelphia', 'apartment', 'complex', 'filled', 'sorts', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'single', 'father', 'son', 'seemingly', 'caffiene-addicted', 'Asian', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'movie', 'critic', 'who', 'genius', 'course', 'ridiculous', '20-something', 'who', 'only', 'working', 'out', 'one', 'side', 'body', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', 'unnecessary', 'beginning', 'eventually', 'play', 'somewhat', 'vital', 'role', 'story.Heep', 'however', 'truly', 'engaging', 'character', 'right', 'start', 'single', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'terrible', 'stutter', 'portrayed', 'man', 'who', 'respected', 'people', 'yet', 'also', 'rejected', 'small', 'apartment', 'nights', 'alone', 'one', 'night', 'title', 'hints', 'lady', 'water', 'name', 'Story', 'character', 'very', 'mysterious', 'Cleveland', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'comprehend', 'who', 'why', 'suddenly', 'appeared', 'life.As', 'story', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'people', 'apartments', 'come', 'together', 'help', 'Story', 'who', 'apparently', 'mythological', 'creature', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'home', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'performance', 'Oscar-worthy', 'phenominal', 'job', 'portraying', 'different', 'layers', 'character.Shyamalan', 'out', 'bit', 'time', 'around', 'Lady', 'Water', 'focus', 'much', 'more', 'fantasy', 'true', 'storytelling', 'horror', 'thrills', 'However', 'Lady', 'Water', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'swear', 'were', 'watching', 'thriller', 'other', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'trys', 'too', 'hard', 'WAY', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'are', 'okay', 'other', 'times', 'are', 'entirely', 'distracting', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'whole', 'really', 'only', 'big', 'complaint', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'film', 'yes', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'bit', 'deterring', 'times', 'many', 'Shyamalan', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'this.Overall', 'Lady', 'Water', 'fairly', 'well', 'put-together', 'film', 'finding', 'place', 'role', 'crazy', 'world', 'film', 'fantastic', 'job', 'minor', 'annoyances', 'way', 'sheer', 'imagination', 'story', 'lovable', 'characters', 'fill', 'make', 'tough', 'movie', 'not', 'enjoy', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'again.Acting', '5', '5', 'StarsDirecting', '4', '5', 'StarsWriting', '3', '5', 'StarsOverall', '4', '5', 'Stars']",N/A

Night Shyamalan. Even this movie has a movie critic who belches the line that there are no new stories. Personally I think that anyone that feels that way should be boiled in his Christmas pudding and have a stake of Holly put through his heart as Scrooge would say. Let's suppose for a moment that people have brains they use for new ideas and stories. Further let us imagine that imagination exist and if we are fortunate enough to have it we can see that ""Lady in the Water"" has merit. Perhaps I'm a fan of Shyamalan and a sentimentalist. But whatever I am I think I know a good story when I see one. He took a story he told his children for years and made it into a movie. Parts of it seem familiar and made me want to do research on stories. But although that would be fascinating work, I don't want to take away from what he has done.What he has done is take an apartment maintenance man that has lost his will to be a physical doctor and made him a sort of mental doctor. One that fixes things for peoples temporary homes and comforts them in a way that touches them more deeply. Enter a water nymph swimming in the pool and other odd occurences. From the beginning he is a believer in imagination and faith. He does not hold much doubt in the possibilty of things outside our tidy little logistics that must define everything infinitesimally. Fortunately he is among people that have that same need to believe in something other than all the violence and laws of man. They all feel they have a purpose, it just may not be obvious at first.

It was funny, and had great moments of fantasy and a little suspense.So, everyone who wants to see it stop trying to re-live the Sixth Sense.  It's over, and it's not coming back.  If you really want to enjoy M Night's movies then see his first one: Wide Awake. That's right, NOT THE SIXTH SENSE. Don't get me wrong I love the Sixth Sense only stop comparing all his movies to that one. This new film is what I feel all his films are about, scary or not, they are all to me about believing in something you can't always understand or even see for yourself.This Fantasy doesn't give you every answer, but it sure does make it fun to find out some of the answers along the way.  Just go with it.  Enjoy it for what it is, a fantasy about other types of beings living in our water.  With evil wolf looking dogs trying to get them while Monkey demons protect the laws.  Out there story line, sure.  But that to me is what makes this fun.  The acting was great, the character's had defined personalities that I thought gave the movie substance.  Don't go if you are looking to find The Sixth Sense here.  Go to find something new.  Something that the rest of the studios are not giving you.

1027934,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000JLTR8Q,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 7]","""Lady in the Water"" is not M. Night Shyamalan's worst movie, which unfortunately isn't saying very much. I give it credit for not being as preposterous as some of his other films, all of which have completely failed to impress me. He's a master manipulator when it comes to the way he advertises his films, using tried and true editing methods in the trailers to draw in an audience. Only when they actually see the film are they completely let down, being forced to watch half-hearted attempts at storytelling. Let's take a look back: ""The Sixth Sense"" was drawn out, moody, and implausible; ""Unbreakable"" ended before anything was resolved; ""Signs"" was just plain bad; and ""The Village"" wasn't much better, especially since it had one of the most unrealistic, unsatisfying, anticlimactic twist endings I've ever seen. With this kind of record, I didn't have much hope for this new film.And it seems I was justified. ""Lady in the Water"" tries so hard to be a modern fairy tale that it loses all sense of place or purpose. It tells the story of a mythical sea nymph--or narf--named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) who emerges one night from the swimming pool of a Philadelphia apartment building. She meets Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the building's superintendent. He's a lost, tortured man, unable to speak without stuttering and still reeling over some traumatic past experiences. Even though he doesn't understand who she is or what her purpose is, he takes her in as casually as someone who takes in an abandoned kitten. I found this a little difficult to accept, considering she speaks to him in short, monotone, cryptic sentences. Basically, she's a mysterious person who continually eludes personal inquiries. Who would want someone like that to stick around? Apparently Heep does. But if he wants to get the whole story, he has to rely on someone else. This creates a problem: who on earth would know anything about narfs, especially since they're not supposed to be real?As fate would have it, there happens to be one tenant who knows all about them. She's an old Chinese woman (June Kyoto Lu) whose grandmother told her the legend many, many years ago. Apparently, there used to be a harmonious union between those that lived on the land and those that lived in the water, a place Story calls the Blue World. As time went on, humanity got more and more greedy, claiming pieces of land that stretched further and further away from the water. Eventually the union was broken. However, the narfs still make an attempt at reconciliation, every so often sending a daughter of specific importance into the human world to reestablish a connection.Here's where the bond between Story and Heep comes in; she's but one of the many narfs sent to restore the balance between humanity and the Blue World. Why have there been so many? Because all the ones before her have failed in their objectives, never again returning home. They were hunted down and destroyed by creatures called scrunts, evil dog- and plant-like beings hell bent on keeping narfs in our world. Exactly why is never explained, which I found troubling; in fairy tales, villains always have a reason for wanting to destroy the good characters (all you have to do is read stories by the Brothers Grimm, the ""Harry Potter"" novels, and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to see what I mean). For ""Lady in the Water,"" Shyamalan created a villain just for the sake of creating a villain, never mind giving it any sense of meaning.But whatever the scrunt's beef with Story is, the fact remains that it's after her, and time is running out to get her home safely. Fortunately, the legend also tells of some important human beings who have the ability to protect her: there's a Guardian, a Healer, an Interpreter, and a Guild of Protectors. All of them are only chosen when the time is right. Since Story doesn't know who possesses the right qualities, it's up to Heep to interview specific apartment tenants. There are a number of possible candidates: the crossword puzzle-addict Mr. Dury (Jeffery Wright) and his son, Joey (Noah Gray-Cabey, whose character can look at a cereal box and find meaning); the jaded film critic Harry Farber (Bob Balaban); Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan) whose connection with Story centers on a book he's writing; his sister, Anna (Sarita Choudhury); Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung), daughter of the old Chinese woman; Reggie (Freddy Rodriguez), a young bodybuilder who, for whatever reason, is only toning the right side of his body; the morose Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin), whose tired of all the hatred and violence in the world; and the animal lover Mrs. Bell (Mary Beth Hurt). Topping off the list is a group of chain smoking slackers who live like slobs and like to party.As you can probably tell, each character has a particular quirk that in some form or another serves the story. In that regard, the film earns its billing as a bedtime story because, be it directly or indirectly, each character has a purpose. However, this creates a problem: Shyamalan's idea is a combination of fantastical elements and mundane, real world circumstances, neither of which come together in a way that's completely cohesive. Story tells Heep that her journey home can only be achieved by hitching a ride on a gigantic eagle, and in order for that to happen, the characters must come together and fulfill their destinies. How exactly does she expect such odd people to help her, especially since they supposedly live in the real world?I realize that this is a fairy tale and that I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief for a little while. But the story for ""Lady in the Water"" doesn't mesh with the fairy tale genre; despite the mythical creatures, it's actually too realistic, so rooted in the real world that the fantasy elements seem completely out of place. On top of all that, the film includes a fair number of humorous moments, all of which were incredibly inappropriate. I found myself asking ""Why?"" during much of the film. Why would a sea nymph choose to emerge from an urban swimming pool? Why not a lake, or perhaps even the ocean? Why do you have to look at a scrunt with a mirror? Why does everyone speak so cryptically? Why is it that an underwater dweller is able to breathe air and speak English?I think the most important question I had was this: why would everyone come to believe in Story so quickly? Immediately after she arrives, the events unfold as naturally as if it were an everyday occurrence. I didn't believe for a second that the reaction towards her was genuine, even for a fairy tale. There was no sense of wonder or bewilderment; there was only quiet acceptance and the vague assumption that all this was supposed to be happening. I guess this means we're supposed to assume the same thing, even though we don't know it. I don't think Shyamalan ever takes this into consideration when he's writing a movie, which is probably why I haven't liked anything he's made thus far. Yes, ""Lady in the Water"" is better than some of his other films, especially since it didn't trick the audience with a ridiculous plot twist. But it's still a ponderous, long-winded, and ultimately unsatisfying idea. As much as it may pain some of you, I can't quite recommend it; it's just not the way fairy tales were meant to be.",3,Can Fairy Tales Really Come True?,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,7305,"['Lady',

1027938,ATOS750XCC9MQ,B000JLTR8Q,Classis Genre Film Fanatic,"[4, 8]","What happens when someone takes a children's bedtime story and turns it into a movie? Well, for one, it will feel like the story was made up as it is being told, which means that certain characters will feel forced or appear out of nowhere to help the plot along when the storyteller realizes that he or she needs a plot device. Secondly, all the characters will act almost childlike, willing to believe anything they are told without much skepticism. That is what happens with director M. Night Shyamalan's latest film project, Lady in the Water...and it works, depending on how one looks at it.People will either hate this movie, or eat it all up like a porterhouse steak. I loved this movie, but it is inevitable (and understandable) why some people may not. The reason being because it is only a likable film if people are able to transport themselves back to when they were children, eager to believe anything, and willing to remember how bedtime stories are truly told. Most people cannot do this, or will not realize that this is what they have to do in order to enjoy this movie. If one goes into this film expecting the usual type of narrative (a more realistic one, catered to the dissenting, adult world), that person will not be satisfied. It kind of reminds me of the overly cynical movie critic character in this film who gets mauled by a scrunt. He did not get it.""Wait wait wait. A 'scrunt' ?"" is probably what you are asking yourself right now. Well, let us start from the beginning. As the story goes, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) plays an apartment caretaker (who stutters a lot when he talks) who finds out that someone has been swimming in the pool after hours. When he sets out to find this person, he encounters what is known in the mythical world as a ""nymph"" (or ""narf""), a humanoid creature from the ""Blue World"" (the sea). A nymph's role throughout the ages apparently has been to help mankind find purpose so that this world can move along as a much better place than before. It is a legend that has been handed down for centuries and is now manifesting itself into the roles of many quirky individuals living in the apartment complex.The problem is that the nymph, whose name is ""Story"" (played wonderfully by Bryce Dallas Howard) is being watched by other evil creatures. She cannot return to the sea unless certain individuals, each with a special purpose, help her get passed the ""scrunts"" - wolf-like creatures that camouflage perfectly into grassy areas. She must also avoid other creatures called ""Tartutics"" that hide in the trees that enforce laws that the nymphs and scrunts must obey in relation to our world and theirs. Anyone who disobeys these rules will be killed. If the humans find their purpose in this tale, and also successfully help Story, a giant eagle will whisk her away back to the sea where she belongs.Does this story seem a little disjointed yet? A little childlike? Alas, that is the point of this film. Shyamalan has already proven himself worthy of telling interesting storylines with proper narrative, as we have seen with The Sixth Sense or Signs. So he feels he has the liberty to use a different approach to storytelling - that of bedtime storytelling. It feels as if it was made up as he went along, and certain aspects of the characters or plot feel a bit unbelievable or forced. This is just fine, however, as it is done on purpose. Is it a poor excuse to not have to write properly? Perhaps. But at least Shyamalan accomplishes what he set out to do. When I watched this film, I felt like a kid again, shining a flashlight underneath my face and telling creepy and exciting tales at night in the dark.These are the types of stories that are not scripted, or thoroughly plotted out. They are simply meant to capture the imagination of a child. Children do not need explanations. They believe what they are told. Cynicism has not infiltrated their psyches yet, which is why the adult characters in this film are so easily susceptible to the tales they are told about the nymph and why they need to help her get back to the sea. They are not offered much explanation as to why they should even believe she lives in the sea, or if there really are scrunts and other creatures that exist. They just believe, just as a child would - which is how we are meant to approach this film. There are even scenes within the film which indicate that this is how we are supposed to think, including Mr. Heep purposefully behaving childish so that he can hear the rest of the sea nymph story from someone who will not tell it to him if he thinks and behaves like an adult.This film makes it easy to have a childlike mind again, with every character being incredibly funny and likable, and so innocently trusting and unskeptical the whole way. Shyamalan really does a great job portraying a diverse group of people who live in this apartment complex through witty dialogue and humor. We have a character that only lifts a dumbbell with one arm, leaving the other arm scrawny. We have a flighty, Asian party girl and her mom who does not speak English. There is even a group of pot-smoking hippies, a man who is incredibly talented with crossword puzzles, and, of course, the film critic (Bob Balaban) who gets mauled by a scrunt (being a film critic myself, I found this rather hilarious).There are many others as well, which may be too many. There are quite a few characters that play a part, but we do not have much of a chance to get to know most of them like we should. Even with this type of narrative, there needs to be a line drawn somewhere that says, ""Hey, this film is too crowded."" It is the same as when a filmmaker sets out to adapt a book into a movie; he cannot write the film the exact same way as the book. He can only capture the spirit of it. Saying that, however, at least every single character is entertaining - and they all have a ""purpose.""This is definitely a different movie for Shyamalan. There is no twist ending this time around (although that fact in and of itself could be argued as being the twist), there are more special effects (of which Industrial Light and Magic did a tremendous job on), and even M. Night Shyamalan himself plays a main role this time, whereas in his other pictures he played more minor roles. He plays the role of a writer whose purpose is to write a book that will influence someone to be a great leader one day. This may come off as very egotistical and preachy, since in real life Shyamalan is a writer himself. But he does play the role well, as do all of the other cast members.I, for one, understand this movie. I was a kid once, and this movie took me back to when I used to have stories told to me or when I used to tell them. So Shyamalan, thank you for making a great bedtime story!DVD Feature:I found the 6-part documentary very interesting, and fun as well. You could see that the cast and crew had fun making this movie. I was, however, let down that Shyamalan did not put one of his home movies on there from when he was a kid, because he did that for all the rest of his movies. And it would be even more appropriate for this film's bonus features, because of the movie's childlike qualities.",4,This really is like a bedtime story.,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,7213,"['What',

1027939,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000JLTR8Q,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 5]","Going into Lady in the Water was a lot different than going into the Village. While with that film, it came after the hugely successful Signs so there was no need for concern until people saw it. Now mind you, the Village wasn't terrible but it was a case of a huge missed opportunity. With this film it was more like ""oh boy, here we go"" as if we knew it would be just like the Village. Now regardless of his faults and strengths as a filmmaker, he always told stories that I liked seeing: paranormal stories that were not just simply mob movies or officers turning rogue to take down a criminal. Well Lady in the Water certainly has an intriguing premise, but maybe somebody should've helped out with the story too.Cleveland is a superintendent working at an apartment complex called the Cove. One night, he spots someone in the pool when no one should be there and he accidentally slips and falls in. He's saved by a woman named Story and turns out she's a ""narf"" from a place called the Blue World and her coming will promote great change. Like any Eastern legend come to life, they must have enemies and in a narf's case it's a ""scrunt"": a big wolf that looks like vines and grass. Cleveland with a handful of tenants have to somehow get Story to the Blue World before the scrunt gets her.Now, I'm an RPG player like Final Fantasy and an anime watcher like Escaflowne so a story like that to me doesn't illicit unintentional laughter. But they are certain points where it got kind of not really silly but you know people would see it like so. An example is a character who gets wisdom from cereal boxes (seriously) and you almost wish someone was there near Shyamalan's shoulder going ""um, might want to change that"". But then when you think things are fine, then comes trouble spots. A snooty, humorless film and book critic in one scene actually deconstructs the situation he's in typically found in movies and probably worst of all: the director himself has a bigger role than before who's writing promotes great change. I don't mind director cameos or roles in film and I don't find him a bad actor but when his character gets that kind of importance it's like ""heh heh, you wish buddy."" Whether it is ego or just simply a wink to the audience though, who knows.One thing that Shyamalan always had a knack for though is casting and atmosphere. Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard both are great and the rest, while not given much to do, at least don't feel disposable. Directing is not as overtly flashy and he certainly knows how to frame a scene and the scrunt, while not given the more ""less is more"" approach like Signs, is downright cool and even scary. The only thing that kind of derails the film is the pacing is not as forwarding as it should be. It's not a slow moving film but it doesn't have that huge sense of urgency or dynamics that it should. It's only when that big dog shows up that things start ramping up.Some people own all his films since Sixth Sense as a ""collection"" while some own just some. Lady in the Water is in the grey area: you might like it, you probably will hate it but don't think you're going to see an outright terrible movie like Glitter, Battlefield Earth or a Uwe Boll movie.",3,Not the serious misstep everyone thinks it is,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,3227,"['Going', 'Lady', 'Water', 'was', 'lot', 'different', 'going', 'Village', 'film', 'came', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Signs', 'was', 'need', 'concern', 'people', 'saw', 'Now', 'Village', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'was', 'case', 'huge', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'oh', 'boy', 'here', 'go', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'Village', 'Now', 'regardless', 'faults', 'strengths', 'filmmaker', 'always', 'told', 'stories', 'liked', 'seeing', 'paranormal', 'stories', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'simply', 'mob', 'movies', 'officers', 'turning', 'rogue', 'take', 'down', 'criminal', 'Well', 'Lady', 'Water', 'certainly', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'maybe', 'somebody', 'should', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'out', 'story', 'too.Cleveland', 'superintendent', 'working', 'apartment', 'complex', 'called', 'Cove', 'One', 'night', 'spots', 'someone', 'pool', 'when', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'there', 'accidentally', 'saved', 'woman', 'named', 'Story', 'out', 'narf', 'place', 'called', 'Blue', 'World', 'coming', 'will', 'promote', 'great', 'change', 'Eastern', 'legend', 'come', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'enemies', 'narf', 'case', 'scrunt', 'big', 'wolf', 'vines', 'grass', 'Cleveland', 'handful', 'tenants', 'have', 'somehow', 'get', 'Story', 'Blue', 'World', 'scrunt', 'her.Now', ""'m"", 'RPG', 'player', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'anime', 'watcher', 'Escaflowne', 'story', ""n't"", 'illicit', 'unintentional', 'laughter', 'are', 'certain', 'points', 'where', 'got', 'kind', 'not', 'really', 'silly', 'know', 'people', 'would', 'see', 'so', 'example', 'character', 'who', 'wisdom', 'cereal', 'boxes', 'seriously', 'almost', 'wish', 'someone', 'was', 'there', 'Shyamalan', 'shoulder', 'going', 'um', 'might', 'want', 'change', 'then', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'fine', 'then', 'trouble', 'spots', 'snooty', 'humorless', 'film', 'book', 'critic', 'one', 'scene', 'actually', 'situation', 'typically', 'found', 'movies', 'probably', 'worst', 'director', 'bigger', 'role', 'who', 'writing', 'promotes', 'great', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'director', 'cameos', 'roles', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'bad', 'actor', 'when', 'character', 'kind', 'importance', 'heh', 'heh', 'wish', 'buddy', 'ego', 'just', 'simply', 'wink', 'audience', 'who', 'knows.One', 'thing', 'Shyamalan', 'always', 'had', 'knack', 'though', 'casting', 'atmosphere', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'are', 'great', 'rest', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'disposable', 'Directing', 'not', 'as', 'overtly', 'flashy', 'certainly', 'how', 'frame', 'scene', 'scrunt', 'not', 'given', 'more', 'less', 'more', 'approach', 'Signs', 'downright', 'cool', 'even', 'scary', 'only', 'thing', 'kind', 'derails', 'film', 'pacing', 'not', 'as', 'forwarding', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'slow', 'moving', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'sense', 'urgency', 'dynamics', 'should', 'only', 'when', 'big', 'dog', 'up', 'things', 'start', 'ramping', 'up.Some', 'people', 'own', 'films', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'collection', 'own', 'just', 'Lady', 'Water', 'grey', 'area', 'might', 'like', 'probably', 'will', 'hate', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'outright', 'terrible', 'movie', 'Glitter', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'movie']",N/A
1027940,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000JLTR8Q,C. Middleton,"[5, 8]","Shyamalan's Lady in the Water is the most (in my opinion) unusual and creative film of his career. It should go without saying that all his films are unusual leaning towards the supernatural and fantastic, touching upon subject matter such as earthbound spirits, alien invasions, an indestructible super-man, the notion of fear itself controlling us and in Lady in the Water, a bed time story turned adult fantasy about the necessity of the human being to become more aware and change for the better.Paul Giamatti (Sideways) plays the leading role of Mr. Heaps, the landlord of a large apartment complex, a caring man who has made it his sole purpose to take good care of his tenants though later in the film, we discover his true purpose and why he is off his true path. Giamatti is an excellent actor, able to do comic roles and true pathos with utter believability.Bryce Dallas Howard (The Village) as Story, the Narf who arrives from the world of water to the land of the human in order to move the human on the correct path towards positive change is perfect in this role. Howard's pure innocence as the Narf came across as genuine and her vulnerability almost visceral as the evil monsters that hide in the grass stalk her and attempt to drag her away and destroy her.In fact the entire cast played their roles with enthusiasm and all seemed as actors, to really enjoy doing this film with Shyamalan.To make an observation, all of Night's films except maybe The Village, have a similar underlying theme. That theme is the individual discovering their true purpose in life and following that purpose. In this film he expands on this theme writing the purpose for the entire cast in the form of the desperate mission to enable Story to leave our world without harm. This was very clever and worked well in the film.M. Night Shyamalan is a gifted writer. He is not only a gifted writer but a hard working one with an eye on perfection.

Part of that, I guess, is that I am willing to take each film for what it presents to me rather than putting preconditions on what I want it to be.  I am willing to let Shyamalan tell me his story the way he wants to tell it.  This is especially true of this film.Apparently, it is based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan would tell his children.  It certainly has that flavor about it.  And it doesn't have anything like a driving plot or a great mystery about it.  It is flavored more like a dream.  There are elements that one isn't quite sure what they are or how they relate - even after the film is over.  However, the telling of the story provides its own satisfactions.  The real point of the film is about saving the lives of an apartment complex full of lost souls.  Well, saving at least most of them.How those lives are saved and what that will mean is partly told in the film and partly left up to you to look in yourself and supply to the story.  Which is why the story is so satisfying and why kids like bedtime stories.  It also has to do with why dreams can be so especially satisfying even though they make no logical sense.  It is about connecting things within yourself.  The stories goal is to draw certain things out of you and let you put them together.Maybe you will hate this story.  I have read some things expressing dislike to outright contempt.  It was much better than I expected, but I came to it without expectations or preconditions.The cast is terrific.  I am a huge fan of Paul Giamatti and find his acting compelling and engaging.  It is quite interesting to learn how this guy came to be a stammering and  And I fell for Bryce Dallas Howard in ""The Village"" and she is just as engaging here in an utterly different character.

1027946,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000JLTR8Q,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[6, 11]","The prose for `Lady in the Water' is an intriguing one.  I was excited to see Shyamalan tackle a fairy tale.  I mean, Night has hit a slump since `Unbreakable' and for some reason I still flock to his films crossing my fingers and praying he gets his mojo back, but `Lady in the Water' si just further proof that he tries way too hard.  What's sad is that this has so much potential, but Shyamalan was too concerned with making a point (the point being that he can do whatever he wants in this industry) and failed to give the story a solid point.  Add to that a film littered with many other faults and you have a big problem.The first problem is found in the underdeveloped, or maybe it's overdeveloped, story.  The fairy tale that this movie tells, about a sea-nymph or narf who must return to the blue world via `The Great Etlon' only after inspiring a man to write something that will change the face of the world while she contends with creatures called skrunt's who will stop at nothing to kill her, even risking their own lives at the hands of three monkey like guardians is somewhat exhausting.  But Shyamalan didn't stop there.  You have to add to that the fact that there are humans who must help this narf escape the skrunt's.  Each of these humans has a specific title or job.  There has to be a translator, a guardian, a healer and a guild or group of people.With all of this here you may wonder how so much could mean so little, but when each persons role is far from explained it makes it difficult to give it much meaning.  So, for every `overdeveloped' plotline it, in a sense, comes of `underdeveloped' because it just flat out makes no sense.  In a way I feel that this is another attempt on Night's behalf to throw one at his critics.  In the film, as all know, there is a film critic who meets an untimely end, but before that happens he makes a comment about how all films are predictable and that there is no originality in cinema today.  Well, Night is attempting to disprove that by giving us the opposite of what is expected...the only problem is that Night forgot a key element to making any film memorable...it needs to make sense!Now that you've processed all of that, we can move onto the next problem.  This is found in the characters themselves.  They all, every one of them, seem nave and childish.  It makes no sense that no one would question the reality of what is going on.  Even Cleveland (Paul Giamatti) who in the first scene of the film says that creatures don't exist, doesn't even question whether or not this girl is just plain delusional.  It baffles me that everyone wants so desperately to believe this whole thing is real, which is not the way any normal person would act...and maybe that's why this apartment building is littered with strange and abnormal people.Another problem is found in the acting.  I normally love Paul Giamatti but here he's somewhat annoying, especially his stuttering which comes off too rehearsed, unnatural and, for lack of a better word, bad.  Bryce Dallas Howard was sensational in `The Village' but here she comes off distant and stagnant.  She lacks the commanding energy she gave to her previous role but she just kind of slips away into the background.  Bob Balaban as that arrogant critic Harry Farber is ridiculously clich&eacute;d, Jeffrey Wright sounds like he's reading cue cards throughout the film and Freddy Rodriguez is pitifully used and abused in a thankless and ridiculous role.  The shock to me was M. Night Shyamalan who to me was the better actor here, and that was something I never expected.  Cindy Cheung was also fine, I mean at least she was funny, and Sarita Choudhury was decent if not underused.When you add these disappointments together it becomes harder and harder to find anything good about this film.  The visuals are stunning in comparison to the horrid makeup and effects in `The Village'.  The skrunts and tree beings look pretty cool, scary even, but even they can't rescue this film from impending disaster.  The real sad thing is that Night had so much promise.  `The Sixth Sense' was one of the best films to come out in the past decade and it gave Night the boost he needed to make a name for himself and garner enough respect to make what he wanted the way he wanted...but sadly that power has been misused.  Instead of capitalizing on his strengths and turning out smart script after smart script, in an essence becoming the go-to guy for a blockbuster he ended up becoming the go-to guy for a international flop.",2,"Fairy tales are supposed to be strange, not stupid!",1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,4535,"['prose', 'Lady', 'Water', 'intriguing', 'one', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'Shyamalan', 'tackle', 'fairy', 'tale', 'mean', 'Night', 'hit', 'slump', 'Unbreakable', 'reason', 'still', 'flock', 'films', 'crossing', 'fingers', 'praying', 'mojo', 'back', 'Lady', 'Water', 'si', 'just', 'further', 'proof', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'What', 'sad', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'too', 'concerned', 'making', 'point', 'point', 'being', 'can', 'do', 'whatever', 'industry', 'failed', 'give', 'story', 'solid', 'point', 'Add', 'film', 'littered', 'many', 'other', 'faults', 'have', 'big', 'problem.The', 'first', 'problem', 'found', 'underdeveloped', 'maybe', 'overdeveloped', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale', 'movie', 'sea-nymph', 'narf', 'who', 'must', 'return', 'blue', 'world', 'Great', 'Etlon', 'only', 'inspiring', 'man', 'write', 'something', 'will', 'change', 'face', 'world', 'creatures', 'called', 'skrunt', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'kill', 'even', 'risking', 'own', 'lives', 'hands', 'three', 'monkey', 'guardians', 'somewhat', 'exhausting', 'Shyamalan', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'have', 'add', 'fact', 'are', 'humans', 'who', 'must', 'help', 'narf', 'skrunt', 'humans', 'specific', 'title', 'job', 'be', 'translator', 'guardian', 'healer', 'guild', 'group', 'people.With', 'here', 'may', 'wonder', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'mean', 'so', 'little', 'when', 'persons', 'role', 'far', 'explained', 'difficult', 'give', 'much', 'meaning', 'So', 'overdeveloped', 'plotline', 'sense', 'underdeveloped', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'sense', 'way', 'feel', 'attempt', 'Night', 'behalf', 'throw', 'one', 'critics', 'film', 'know', 'film', 'critic', 'who', 'untimely', 'end', 'comment', 'how', 'films', 'are', 'predictable', 'originality', 'cinema', 'today', 'Well', 'Night', 'attempting', 'disprove', 'giving', 'opposite', 'what', 'expected', 'only', 'problem', 'Night', 'forgot', 'key', 'element', 'making', 'film', 'memorable', 'make', 'sense', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'processed', 'can', 'move', 'next', 'problem', 'found', 'characters', 'one', 'seem', 'nave', 'childish', 'sense', 'one', 'would', 'question', 'reality', 'what', 'going', 'Even', 'Cleveland', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'creatures', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', ""n't"", 'even', 'question', 'not', 'girl', 'just', 'plain', 'delusional', 'everyone', 'so', 'desperately', 'believe', 'whole', 'thing', 'real', 'not', 'way', 'normal', 'person', 'would', 'act', 'maybe', 'why', 'apartment', 'building', 'littered', 'strange', 'abnormal', 'people.Another', 'problem', 'found', 'acting', 'normally', 'love', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'here', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'especially', 'stuttering', 'off', 'too', 'rehearsed', 'unnatural', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'bad', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'was', 'sensational', 'Village', 'here', 'off', 'distant', 'stagnant', 'commanding', 'energy', 'gave', 'previous', 'role', 'just', 'kind', 'slips', 'away', 'background', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'arrogant', 'critic', 'Harry', 'Farber', 'ridiculously', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'reading', 'cue', 'cards', 'film', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'pitifully', 'used', 'abused', 'thankless', 'ridiculous', 'role', 'shock', 'was', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'was', 'better', 'actor', 'here', 'was', 'something', 'never', 'expected', 'Cindy', 'Cheung', 'was', 'also', 'fine', 'mean', 'least', 'was', 'funny', 'Sarita', 'Choudhury', 'was', 'decent', 'not', 'add', 'disappointments', 'together', 'harder', 'harder', 'find', 'anything', 'good', 'film', 'visuals', 'are', 'stunning', 'comparison', 'horrid', 'makeup', 'effects', 'Village', 'skrunts', 'tree', 'beings', 'look', 'pretty', 'cool', 'scary', 'even', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'film', 'impending', 'disaster', 'real', 'sad', 'thing', 'Night', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'past', 'decade', 'gave', 'Night', 'boost', 'needed', 'make', 'name', 'garner', 'enough', 'respect', 'make', 'what', 'wanted', 'way', 'wanted', 'sadly', 'power', 'been', 'misused', 'Instead', 'capitalizing', 'strengths', 'turning', 'out', 'smart', 'script', 'smart', 'script', 'essence', 'becoming', 'go-to', 'guy', 'blockbuster', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'go-to', 'guy', 'international', 'flop']",N/A
1027947,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000JLTR8Q,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 3]","This is the kind of film I typically enjoy, even if others consider it average at best.  Oddly enough, though, the tables have been turned when it comes to Lady in the Water.  Frankly, I just didn't find this to be a very good film.  The story had potential, certainly, but M. Night Shyamalan's script, which involved way too many people coming together and accepting a most extraordinary story far too easily, is decidedly weak and flimsy.  And while I certainly understand that the events that play out convey many a metaphorical meaning, too much of what I saw seemed to be made up as things went along.  And for something that supposedly originated with a bedtime story for Shyamalan's kids, it's so bloated with characters and plays so fast and loose with the few rules most fairy tales actually follow that it loses its appeal pretty quickly.So, basically, what you have here is a sea nymph (Bryce Dallas Howard) named Story showing up in the dirty swimming pool of a seedy motel housing a really diverse range of tenants, from a grumpy, generally silent old man to Chinese immigrants to a film critic to a bodybuilder who only works out on one side of his body, etc.  Story is discovered by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the building superintendent, a good-natured soul and just about the only sympathetic character anywhere in the vicinity of this film.  He takes Story in and slowly learns her story: she's a Narf who has left the Great Ocean temporarily on an important mission to change man's destiny, and she has to avoid some nasty Scrunts who want to stop her and prevent the Great Eatlon from carrying her back home - and, by the way, there's another creature called the Tartutic who scares the heck out of Scrunts.  And what is this grand mission?  She has to communicate a silent message to a young writer, played by none other than Shyamalan himself, whose book will basically save the world some day.  It's not hard to see why some critics point to Shyamalan's ego having run totally amuck, especially given the fact he included in the story an unlikable film critic mouthing only clich&eacute;s for no plot-related reason (but obviously for personal - not to mention childish - reasons).  One must remember that Shyamalan threw a hissy fit and took his fairy tale elsewhere when the perceptive folks at Disney pointed out that the story needed some serious revising.In the end, I'm afraid I have to agree with those who see Lady in the Water as a misguided product of Shyamalan's ego and filmmaking arrogance.  Talk about metaphors all you like, but the film's plot is basically nonsense.

Thus, the 3 star review.  There were definitely some good parts to ""Lady In The Water,"" and there were some stinker parts to it.  Good parts included cool camera shots (although there were a few odd shots that didn't work for me).  There was alos good acting.  Some parts were funny and I jumped a few times at the scary parts.  And most of all, the plot was very intricate and definitely ORIGINAL.  There aren't any movies like this one.However, there were some stinker parts.  Someone mentioned stereotypical characters and this movie is chocked full of them.  And I felt bad when the whole audience laughed at a voice-over of Young Soon, not because she said something funny, but because of the way she sounded.  There were also other parts where people (including myself) laughed aloud, although it wasn't supposed to be funny.  There were also parts of the movie that were confusing.  There was A LOT of talking, especially about narfs and scrunts, and tartufics, and an eatlon that made you go ""Huh?""  But the movie repeats what these are several times in case you missed it the first four times.  I also thought the death of one of the characters (who delivers a soliloquy about how unlikable characters die in horror movies) was way over the top and unneccessary and should have been edited out of the movie.  And the ending, which I predicted, seemed a little forced and wasn't satisfying.All in all, this movie is okay, and you should probably wait for video to watch (and put on the Subtitles!).  Paul Giamatti is definitely the highlight of this movie, although I miss Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, or Joaquin Phoenix.

1027952,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B000JLTR8Q,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[7, 12]","Has M. Knight Shyamalan lost his mind?  Is he a mad genius or just loopy?  Has he created a masterpiece or a mess?  These are the questions I'm still grappling with after watching THE LADY IN THE WATER.  This is most interestingly beautiful, confusing, and downright strange films I've have ever seen.  Wow, trying to come up with words to explain what's going on in my mind after watching this film is impossible.  I'm not sure if I've seen the future of the cinema or the end of a popular director's career.  But I do know that THE LADY IN THE WATER cannot be ignored.I think walking into this film, I had many preconceived notions.  I know what an M. Knight Shyamalan film is, or at least what it's supposed to be.  But  THE LADY IN THE WATER challenges every one of those notions.  There's no surprise ending, there are very few scares, and the film feels sloppy, half-hearted, overly confusing, and I understand why most will dismiss it.  This is a movie that can't quite be nailed down and since the film bucks any and all convention.  It's easy to find the conventional  flaws everywhere.The acting is disjointed, the plot is a mess, the dialogue is overly simple, the story is far too complicated and it all combines into something that seems pieced together on the fly.It feels almost as if Shyamalan has drawn a line in the sand.  This line is all logic. This line is how far he expects us to go, and then out of nowhere the line suddenly falls apart.  Shyamalan pushes us so past the line, it's easy to just give up.  I think the line comes at a different point for each of us.  The  line disappeared to me when the little boy begins to read cereal boxes.  It is so weird, so out of left field. This was at that point in which I had to decide if  I should give up any semblance of logic and just give in to the sheer absurdity of it, or whether I should give up and pan it.  Where that lines falls with you, may decide if you have a positive reaction to the film or not.The plot is simple, or maybe not.  A ""Narf"" named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) shows up in a pool at The Cove, and apartment community in Philadelphia.  What's a ""Narf?"" Well it's kind of like a mermaid with human feet, or maybe more like an angel or a muse that lives underwater, both would be appropriate.  Anyway Story is rescued by The Cove's resident superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Story is looking for a writer who's written work will cause a positive change in the world forever.  On that trail Cleveland must protect Story from an evil creature bent on destroying her.But what is this movie exactly?  It is a bedtime story come to life. It's a  fanciful yarn, a child's story and a wild imagination run amok.  Like how MULLHOLLAND DRIVE was dream realized on film, THE LADY IN THE WATER is a campfire tale, it's not a terribly cohesive, and demands that the audience put the pieces together.  I liken it to the weird tales I created with my action figures as a kid, or a nonsense story that a first grader may try to write.  It's not designed to be pulled apart, just experienced at that moment.  None of the pieces  quite fit, a lot of times if feels as if the film is grasping for straws.  Sensing that it's lost most of the audience it gives into its oddness, and it revels in it. But is that by design?The other side of the coin is that this is a badly made movie.  It's the wild ranting of an over zealous personality.  The first credit you see as the film comes to a close is ""Written, Produced, and Directed by M. Knight Shyamalan"" and since he's been so successful maybe this film is an example of what happens when you allow a director too much room, and no editorial comment from the studio.  Maybe this is a self-indulgent vanity piece, a sloppy mess of a movie that would have been easily dismissed had it not been created by Shyamalan himself.Honestly, I don't know where I fall.  I think I want to see the movie again.  But I like the notion that this could be a step in the right direction for film as a whole. That Shayamalan has crafted a film that way ahead of its time.  I'd hate to realize that there is nothing there because it would rob that odd sense of madcap joy I experienced with the film.THE LADY IN THE WATER is the perfect remedy for what's wrong in Hollywood.  Even if you hate every single moment of it, it encourages strong reactions. Whether that reaction is confusion, anger, or awe, this film cannot be easily ignored.  So at this moment I think I will argue that THE LADY IN  THE WATER is a brilliant film.  That Shyamalan will get ribbed for it now, but will later be rewarded with a strong cult following.  It's easily the best film I've seen all year.",5,"Whether your reaction is confusion, anger, or awe, this film cannot be easily ignored.",1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,4695,"['Has', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shyamalan', 'lost', 'mind', 'mad', 'genius', 'just', 'loopy', 'Has', 'created', 'masterpiece', 'mess', 'are', 'questions', ""'m"", 'still', 'grappling', 'watching', 'THE', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', 'most', 'interestingly', 'beautiful', 'confusing', 'downright', 'strange', 'films', ""'ve"", 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Wow', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'words', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'mind', 'watching', 'film', 'impossible', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'future', 'cinema', 'end', 'popular', 'director', 'career', 'do', 'know', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored.I', 'think', 'walking', 'film', 'had', 'many', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'know', 'what', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'least', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'THE', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', 'one', 'notions', 'surprise', 'ending', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'scares', 'film', 'feels', 'sloppy', 'half-hearted', 'overly', 'confusing', 'understand', 'why', 'most', 'will', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'be', 'nailed', 'down', 'film', 'convention', 'easy', 'find', 'conventional', 'flaws', 'everywhere.The', 'acting', 'disjointed', 'plot', 'mess', 'dialogue', 'overly', 'simple', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'complicated', 'combines', 'something', 'pieced', 'together', 'fly.It', 'almost', 'Shyamalan', 'drawn', 'line', 'sand', 'line', 'logic', 'line', 'how', 'far', 'go', 'then', 'nowhere', 'line', 'suddenly', 'apart', 'Shyamalan', 'line', 'easy', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'think', 'line', 'different', 'point', 'line', 'disappeared', 'when', 'little', 'boy', 'read', 'cereal', 'boxes', 'so', 'weird', 'so', 'left', 'field', 'was', 'point', 'had', 'decide', 'should', 'give', 'up', 'semblance', 'logic', 'just', 'give', 'sheer', 'absurdity', 'should', 'give', 'up', 'pan', 'Where', 'lines', 'may', 'decide', 'have', 'positive', 'reaction', 'film', 'not.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'maybe', 'not', 'A', 'Narf', 'named', 'Story', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'up', 'pool', 'Cove', 'apartment', 'community', 'Philadelphia', 'What', 'Narf', 'kind', 'mermaid', 'human', 'feet', 'maybe', 'more', 'angel', 'muse', 'underwater', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'Anyway', 'Story', 'rescued', 'Cove', 'resident', 'superintendent', 'Cleveland', 'Heep', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Story', 'looking', 'writer', 'who', 'written', 'work', 'will', 'cause', 'positive', 'change', 'world', 'forever', 'trail', 'Cleveland', 'must', 'protect', 'Story', 'evil', 'creature', 'bent', 'destroying', 'her.But', 'what', 'movie', 'exactly', 'bedtime', 'story', 'come', 'life', 'fanciful', 'yarn', 'child', 'story', 'wild', 'imagination', 'run', 'amok', 'how', 'MULLHOLLAND', 'DRIVE', 'was', 'dream', 'realized', 'film', 'THE', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', 'campfire', 'tale', 'not', 'terribly', 'cohesive', 'audience', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'liken', 'weird', 'tales', 'created', 'action', 'figures', 'kid', 'nonsense', 'story', 'first', 'grader', 'may', 'try', 'write', 'not', 'designed', 'be', 'pulled', 'apart', 'just', 'experienced', 'moment', 'None', 'pieces', 'quite', 'fit', 'lot', 'times', 'feels', 'film', 'grasping', 'straws', 'Sensing', 'lost', 'most', 'audience', 'oddness', 'design', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'badly', 'made', 'movie', 'wild', 'ranting', 'zealous', 'personality', 'first', 'credit', 'see', 'film', 'close', 'Written', 'Produced', 'Directed', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shyamalan', 'been', 'so', 'successful', 'maybe', 'film', 'example', 'what', 'when', 'allow', 'director', 'too', 'much', 'room', 'editorial', 'comment', 'studio', 'Maybe', 'self-indulgent', 'vanity', 'piece', 'sloppy', 'mess', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'created', 'Shyamalan', 'himself.Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'fall', 'think', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'like', 'notion', 'could', 'be', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'film', 'whole', 'Shayamalan', 'crafted', 'film', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', ""'d"", 'hate', 'realize', 'nothing', 'there', 'would', 'rob', 'odd', 'sense', 'madcap', 'joy', 'experienced', 'film.THE', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', 'perfect', 'remedy', 'what', 'wrong', 'Hollywood', 'Even', 'hate', 'single', 'moment', 'strong', 'reactions', 'reaction', 'confusion', 'anger', 'awe', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'easily', 'ignored', 'So', 'moment', 'think', 'will', 'argue', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Shyamalan', 'will', 'get', 'ribbed', 'now', 'will', 'later', 'be', 'rewarded', 'strong', 'cult', 'following', 'easily', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year']",N/A

1027955,A3V5YEY65T37UL,B000JLTR8Q,David Butler,"[6, 10]","First, let me say that I remain a fan of Shyamalan.  He is an expert story teller and has an obvious passion for making films come alive as few directors can.  I have adored each movie he has made including the very underrated The Village...until now.  No director has a flawless body of work, no matter how talented they are, and Night is no exception.Lady in the Water is the tale of a lonely hotel superintendent (Paul Giamatti) in Philadelphia whose life is miraculously saved by a water nymph named Story, who comes from the ocean, or, ""The Blue World"".  Supposedly this fits with an old Japanese bedtime story and soon begins to prove true.  Piece by piece, Giamatti tries to put it all together and help Story return home by finding all of the necessary people in his hotel who apparently represent characters from the bedtime story.  The problem with this premise is that it is too far removed from reality.  While perhaps interesting to imagine, somehow it just doen't translate to the screen.The acting by leads Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard as well as most of the supporting cast is great.  The disappointment comes directly from Night himself.  While this departure from his trademark ""shock ending"" movies may well have been a personal story or statement he just had to tell, it simply doesn't live up to what audiences have come to expect.  There are numerous lame moments and some pretty stupid characters (like the guy who only lifts weights with one side of his body and a cliche film critic).  Plus there is little to keep the viewers attention, save the hope that the story will improve.  It doesn't. Even with the addtion of the other storybook creatures, something fails to connect.There is nothing wrong with going against expectations, and I believe Night's decision to make Lady in the Water does reveal yet another dimension of his depth as a person.  The bottom line then is that although his intentions were good, the deliverance was ultimately foggy.

Night Shyamalan walks with this audacious 2006 fantasy is a precarious one at best, and I was hopeful that his risky undertaking would yield dividends despite his recent track record. While there are some compelling elements, the film is ultimately done in by its contrived execution and lugubrious pacing. Much of the basic problem comes down to the insistent way that Shyamalan applies the brooding atmosphere of his previous films to what is essentially a whimsical fable about maintaining community and believing in one's own potential. These are worthy themes to pursue but not in the convoluted quagmire of faux-spirituality that he presents here.Based on an elaborate bedtime story concocted by Shyamalan, the plot centers around Cleveland Heep, a pensive, stuttering apartment superintendent who obviously has more on the ball than his job would indicate. After hearing splashing in the complex pool over several nights, he discovers a sea nymph named Story, who comes from the Blue World. The rest of the movie focuses on how Cleveland learns the detail of the myth behind Story (apparently a Chinese-based fairy tale) and enlists various apartment dwellers to help him find her way home. At the same time, Story inspires a tortured writer to find his way toward greatness as grass-tufted wild creatures lie in wake to do her harm.Unfortunately, Shyamalan chose to populate the apartment building with stock characters meant to represent a societal microcosm, hiring and then wasting several fine actors to play them including Jeffrey Wright as a crossword puzzle expert, Bill Irwin as an agoraphobic bookworm, and Bob Balaban as a cynical film critic. Easily the most self-indulgent move comes from the filmmaker casting himself as the writer. Rising above it all, however, is Paul Giamatti who leverages his well-grounded, self-deprecating humanism to give Cleveland more gravitas than the screenplay warrants. In the impossible role of Story, Bryce Dallas Howard has the right opaque look and plaintive manner, but she is given little latitude beyond that.Production values are top-notch, especially the otherworldly cinematography by Wong Kar-wai's favorite cameraman, Christopher Doyle. It appears all this talent has been directed toward a film that tries fervently to be uplifting but ends up inert. Given the coincidence of Howard's appearance, one cannot help but look back fondly on her father's satisfying film, ""Splash"", which took a similar premise but added warmth and laughs. The 2006 DVD has plenty of extras though surprisingly no commentary track from Shyamalan. Instead, there is a multi-part, 34-minute making-of feature, ""Reflections of Lady in the Water"", as well as a brief short, ""Lady in the Water: A Bedtime Story"" in which the director discusses his children's book tie-in. Less worthy are a few deleted scenes, a useless gag reel and a rather odd audition tape of various actors retching.",2,Shyamalan's Elaborate Bedtime Story Plods Along Under the Weight of Dashed Expectations,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,2957,"['tightrope', 'filmmaker', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'audacious', '2006', 'fantasy', 'precarious', 'one', 'best', 'was', 'hopeful', 'risky', 'undertaking', 'would', 'yield', 'dividends', 'recent', 'track', 'record', 'are', 'compelling', 'elements', 'film', 'ultimately', 'done', 'contrived', 'execution', 'lugubrious', 'pacing', 'Much', 'basic', 'problem', 'down', 'insistent', 'way', 'Shyamalan', 'brooding', 'atmosphere', 'previous', 'films', 'what', 'essentially', 'whimsical', 'fable', 'maintaining', 'community', 'believing', 'one', 'own', 'potential', 'are', 'worthy', 'themes', 'pursue', 'not', 'convoluted', 'quagmire', 'faux-spirituality', 'here.Based', 'elaborate', 'bedtime', 'story', 'concocted', 'Shyamalan', 'plot', 'centers', 'Cleveland', 'Heep', 'pensive', 'stuttering', 'apartment', 'superintendent', 'who', 'obviously', 'more', 'ball', 'job', 'would', 'indicate', 'hearing', 'splashing', 'complex', 'pool', 'several', 'nights', 'sea', 'nymph', 'named', 'Story', 'who', 'Blue', 'World', 'rest', 'movie', 'how', 'Cleveland', 'detail', 'myth', 'Story', 'apparently', 'Chinese-based', 'fairy', 'tale', 'various', 'apartment', 'dwellers', 'help', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'same', 'time', 'Story', 'tortured', 'writer', 'find', 'way', 'greatness', 'grass-tufted', 'wild', 'creatures', 'lie', 'wake', 'do', 'harm.Unfortunately', 'Shyamalan', 'chose', 'populate', 'apartment', 'building', 'stock', 'characters', 'meant', 'represent', 'societal', 'microcosm', 'hiring', 'then', 'wasting', 'several', 'fine', 'actors', 'play', 'including', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'crossword', 'puzzle', 'expert', 'Bill', 'Irwin', 'agoraphobic', 'bookworm', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'cynical', 'film', 'critic', 'Easily', 'most', 'self-indulgent', 'move', 'filmmaker', 'casting', 'writer', 'Rising', 'however', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'well-grounded', 'self-deprecating', 'humanism', 'give', 'Cleveland', 'more', 'gravitas', 'screenplay', 'warrants', 'impossible', 'role', 'Story', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'right', 'opaque', 'look', 'plaintive', 'manner', 'given', 'little', 'latitude', 'that.Production', 'values', 'are', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'otherworldly', 'cinematography', 'Wong', 'Kar-wai', 'favorite', 'cameraman', 'Christopher', 'Doyle', 'talent', 'been', 'directed', 'film', 'fervently', 'be', 'uplifting', 'up', 'inert', 'Given', 'coincidence', 'Howard', 'appearance', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'look', 'back', 'fondly', 'father', 'satisfying', 'film', 'Splash', 'took', 'similar', 'premise', 'added', 'warmth', '2006', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'extras', 'surprisingly', 'commentary', 'track', 'Shyamalan', 'Instead', 'multi-part', '34-minute', 'making-of', 'feature', 'Reflections', 'Lady', 'Water', 'as', 'well', 'brief', 'short', 'Lady', 'Water', 'Bedtime', 'Story', 'director', 'children', 'book', 'tie-in', 'Less', 'worthy', 'are', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'useless', 'gag', 'reel', 'rather', 'odd', 'audition', 'tape', 'various', 'actors', 'retching']",N/A
1027967,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B000JLTR8Q,elena maria vidal,"[0, 2]","M. Night Shyamalan's film ""Lady in the Water"" (2006) received some pretty harsh reviews. I had decided not to see it, but my brother happened to have the DVD on hand; he prevailed upon me to watch it over the holidays. I was enchanted. It reminded me of the old Irish songs and fairy tales. Fairy-tales traditionally were not only for the entertainment of children but helped people of past times to confront their fears and face their realities. The Irish novel I am working on has led me to explore Celtic folklore; so many fairy-tales have a pattern similar to the story of Lady in the Water. A mortal man encounters an entity from the fairy realm, usually a bewitching maiden, falls in love with her, and his life is transformed forever. Instead of the characters being from an ancient Celtic clan, they are the motley denizens of a Philadelphia apartment house. Each person has a gift, even the faults and annoying habits can be turned to a useful purpose. There is the unkown hero of high destiny whom the fairy-maiden inspires by a single glance. One can apply many of the incidents to spiritual truths; each person has a purpose from God, and it is the mission of the angels to help and inspire. Evil lies in wait, however, but it can be overcome, like the beast in the film who stalks the fairy/narth. It recalls a passage from ""The Sea-Maiden,"" in which a hero kills a terrible beast.""But here was rejoicing, that she should come home alive and whole, and this great captain with the beast's head full of blood in his hand. On the morrow they went away, and there was no question at all but that this hero would save the king's daughter.""It also reminded me of the song, ""Castle of Dromore.""""Bring no ill wind to hinder us, my helpless babe and meDread spirits all of black water, Clan Owen's wild bansheeAnd Holy Mary pitying us to Heaven for grace doth sue.""Usually the hero goes off with the fairy, as in the story ""Connla and the fairy-maid.""""When the maiden heard this, she answered and said 'The ocean is not so strong as the waves of thy longing.

Night Shyamalan movie going by the trailer. ""Lady in the Water"" falls into the exact same category. Simply put, if you liked ""The Village"" you will like this one. And if you didn't like ""The Village"" you won't. Because there are many similarities in both movies. But having said that, ""Lady in the Water"" is a lot more eerier and ""out there."" This is by far Shyamalan's least commercial film, as if by now he knows that he's established his fanbase and can therefore make any type of film he wants without concerns of whether it will do well at the box office or not.I'm not going to go into the plot of ""Lady in the Water"" but I will say that this movie definitely has Shyamalan's trademark suspence and creepy atmosphere, up until the very end. The creatures aren't seen often but when they are the special effects are quite convincing. As with ""The Village,"" the entire movie takes place within a confined space. This only adds to the tension, something I'm sure Shyamalan fully intended.I did not like everything about this movie though. The moments of humor seemed awkward to me, way out of place in the context of the film. Same goes for a few characters who were completely absurd (ie: the guy who worked out only half his body). I'm not sure what Shyamalan was trying to convey with these scenes and characters. I found Bryce Dallas Howard's performance rather phoned-in, having only one single expression and talking in a monotone. I know, that's what her role called for. Still, I liked her a lot more in ""The Village."" And then there's the signature plot twist at the end, which of course I won't reveal. I can't put my finger on it, but it felt lacking to me.I really give ""Lady in the Water"" 3.5 stars but will round up to 4 because I believe M. Night Shyamalan makes movies that have a lot more substance than the trash that's passed as movies these days. ""Lady in the Water"" is sure to divide reviewers here...I don't foresee many 3-star reviews. You will either like it or not like it. And maybe this movie will grow on me even more with repeated viewings. In any case, I haven't stopped thinking about ""Lady in the Water"" after seeing it today, and that to me is a sign of a successful movie.",4,"Some flaws, but highly original and intriguing.

Night Shyamalan's earlier films (despite some flaws), so I'm disappointed to report this one is not in the same league as his previous work.  I was aware of his bitter parting of the ways with Disney over this film (which actually increased my interest in seeing it).  Despite some bad buzz, I came in wanting to like the film.  Now I see why Disney baulked at this.The story is promising but in serious need of further refinement.  Only two characters--the lead (an apartment superintendent played by Paul Giamatti) and the tenant who is a film critic--add anything worthwhile to the movie (the critic's lines in the hallway scene get a chuckle).  The sea nymph (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is a bland and ultimately uninteresting creature.  The complete absence of incredulity in every one of the human characters when told what was going on is a major give-me-a-break factor.  Finally, Shyamalan should avoid the temptation to cast himself in his own movies.  The man needs to have the humility to recognize he is not a gifted actor and lacks the chops for even minor roles in major productions.  It's especially apparent when he puts himself next to people who are gifted, like Paul Giamatti, Mel Gibson (Signs) and Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense).  It really breaks the fourth wall to see him on the screen.In a nutshell, this film is a somewhat confusing children's story someone decided to give professional-film-production treatment for which it was not worthy.  At its worst moments, it takes on the appearance of a train wreck in progress, with the train being Shyamalan's reputation for delivering hit films.  It only narrowly avoids total disaster.  The film even lacks Shyamalan's trademark plot twist at the end.  The few saving graces here are the acting of Paul Giamatti, some nice creature effects and a small amount of fairytale magic the film manages to conjure up.Shyamalan says this film grew out of a bedtime story he made up for his children.  Perhaps it was the praise his young audience heaped upon it that led him to overlook its shortcomings.  Or maybe his string of uninterrupted successes overinflated his self confidence and led him to disregard what proved to be legitimate concerns at Disney.  Whatever the reasons for this misfire, he now has a strike against his record.  As a fan of his earlier work, I hope he is able to rekindle the old magic and redeem himself in his next film.",2,A swing . . . and a miss,1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,2434,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'earlier', 'films', 'flaws', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'report', 'one', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'previous', 'work', 'was', 'aware', 'bitter', 'parting', 'ways', 'Disney', 'film', 'actually', 'increased', 'interest', 'seeing', 'bad', 'buzz', 'came', 'wanting', 'like', 'film', 'Now', 'see', 'why', 'Disney', 'baulked', 'this.The', 'story', 'promising', 'serious', 'need', 'further', 'refinement', 'Only', 'two', 'characters', 'lead', 'apartment', 'superintendent', 'played', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'tenant', 'who', 'film', 'critic', 'add', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'critic', 'lines', 'hallway', 'scene', 'get', 'chuckle', 'sea', 'nymph', 'played', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'bland', 'ultimately', 'uninteresting', 'creature', 'complete', 'absence', 'incredulity', 'one', 'human', 'characters', 'when', 'told', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'major', 'give-me-a-break', 'factor', 'Finally', 'Shyamalan', 'should', 'avoid', 'temptation', 'cast', 'own', 'movies', 'man', 'have', 'humility', 'recognize', 'not', 'gifted', 'actor', 'chops', 'even', 'minor', 'roles', 'major', 'productions', 'especially', 'apparent', 'when', 'next', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'gifted', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Signs', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'really', 'fourth', 'wall', 'see', 'screen.In', 'nutshell', 'film', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'children', 'story', 'someone', 'decided', 'give', 'professional-film-production', 'treatment', 'was', 'not', 'worthy', 'worst', 'moments', 'appearance', 'train', 'wreck', 'progress', 'train', 'being', 'Shyamalan', 'reputation', 'delivering', 'hit', 'films', 'only', 'narrowly', 'avoids', 'total', 'disaster', 'film', 'even', 'Shyamalan', 'trademark', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'few', 'saving', 'graces', 'here', 'are', 'acting', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'nice', 'creature', 'effects', 'small', 'amount', 'fairytale', 'magic', 'film', 'conjure', 'up.Shyamalan', 'film', 'grew', 'bedtime', 'story', 'made', 'up', 'children', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'praise', 'young', 'audience', 'heaped', 'led', 'overlook', 'shortcomings', 'maybe', 'string', 'uninterrupted', 'successes', 'overinflated', 'self', 'confidence', 'led', 'disregard', 'what', 'proved', 'be', 'legitimate', 'concerns', 'Disney', 'reasons', 'misfire', 'now', 'strike', 'record', 'fan', 'earlier', 'work', 'hope', 'able', 'rekindle', 'old', 'magic', 'redeem', 'next', 'film']",N/A

It was a great movie with a great story and a not entirely predictable ""surprise"" ending.  I also enjoyed his follow-up film, Unbreakable (yet it wasn't too well received.)  Each of his later films, however, have left me disappointed.  Lady in the Water is no different.  He keep trying to  string insane story ideas together, only to cap them off with a ""surprise"" ending.  A surprise ending is only a surprise if you're not expecting it!  Another problem I have is how his characters always seem to just accept whatever's going on in the movie.This film is about a water nymph that's trying to save the world from humanity.  Or maybe it's to save humanity from themselves...  Anyway.  She shows up in the swimming pool of an apartment complex filled with very eccentric tenants.  The landlord of the complex is the man who finds her, and immediately clings to this nymph.  He's not quite too sure what to do with her, but conveniently there's an Asian family (Japanese, I think) that just happens to know the legend.  So, to appease the elder lady of the household (who is the expert of the legend,) he goes through some rather silly exercises.  Once he knows this legend, he goes to all the other tenants for help.  They all immediately buy into his tale and pitch in right away.  As the movie progresses, things become more and more convoluted.  Eventually everyone figures out what to do, and the ""surprise"" happens.  Seriously...  I wasn't surprised in any fashion.

If part of his goal was to piss off the exclusive world of film critics, well, he's done it and then some. I don't believe for a nanosecond that any of the critics actually hated the movie the way they claim. I mean, what I've read was so biting it's hard not to think that something about this movie was taken personally. Like, I dunno, the arrogant critic who serves little purpose other than to be a laughable cariciature waiting to be shark bait. Or, rather, Scrunt bait. The humorless critic in this movie was almost prophetic of our real world ""experts"" who apparently aren't capable of having a good laugh -- especially at themselves.Humor, Childlike Magic and Suspense are the primary ingredients of what's cooking in this movie -- and in that order. From the very beginning, Giamatti's character goes through a comedic process of killing a kitchen bug that takes so much effort and energy you'd think he was killing a Scrunt. The movie hadn't yet reached the 10 minute mark and I already had a smile on my face. You never actually see this bug that is so hideous. It's left to the imagination, like any good bedtime story for children.But that's not to imply that this movie is a comedy. It isn't. It really is a bedtime story for adults -- a brave concept alone, since most adults I know, including myself, could easily slip into a Dilbert comic unnoticed. M. Night Shyamalan knows that adults are sort of like an inverted Alice in Woderland where you're stuck in ol' fashion reality everyday with two weeks vacation time to retreat to Disneyworld. Movies used to be a good release from that, but after being hijacked by the criteria's of marketing we don't get motion pictures anymore. We get demographics in motion.Shyamalan not only dumps cold water all over the Hollywood formula, he also gives our ""inner child"" a story we can smile with at some moments, cringe from suspense at others and finally, like all good children's books, have some thoughtful view about a world that really could use a Narf or two.So, no, I don't have a problem with Shyamalan asking me to become a kid again and suspend not just my disbelief but my cynicism as well. And I had a good time. A guy with only one Hulk Hogan arm? Sounds like something I'd find in a Maira Kalman kids book (which I happen to love). A little boy finding mysterious clues on the back of cereal boxes? What's not to believe about that? When I was a kid they DID have clues on the back of cereal boxes! And there was a decoder that came inside the box, which was helpful. A Woman living under a swimming pool? Hey, I used to think Jaws was in the freekin' bathtub! And I thought my mom was trying to cash in on some insurance policy everytime she made me take a bath.It was nice to go back to a moment where the the things that threatened me were just my mother, my older brothers and my imagination.

1027980,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000JLTR8Q,Grady Harp,"[3, 6]","LADY IN THE WATER is a very tough film to review.  M. Night Shyamalan is doubtless a new thinker and has produced some original and interesting films (none of which equal the promise of his first one THE SIXTH SENSE) and LADY IN THE WATER has some very good aspects.  It is just such a mixed bag, full of holes and hints of personal vendettas that it ultimately fails to achieve what it sets out to do.The opening sequence tells a tale in charming line drawings about how we all used to be water people but how man gradually went on land, gained money and power, and became estranged from the purity of the water people: the ladies of the water will try to return reason to the land people but the journey will be fraught with danger.Transfer that tale to real time and we find the disconsolate manager of an apartment house Cleveland Heep (a brilliant, stammering Paul Giammati) whose rules for the building dwellers include no smoking and no swimming in the pool after seven evening.  He discovers a swimmer in the night pool, rescues her, learns her name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and gives her a Gilead in his meager room.  He discovers with the help of one of his tenant's Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) hesitant mother that Story is a narf, a creature from a bedtime story who is sent from the Blue World to imbue reason to a certain man (One who will return 'civilization' to mankind) and then return to her world on the wings of an eagle.  Heep takes it upon himself to find the One who will allow Story to complete her mission, protecting her from the monsters in the night that would destroy her plight.In seeking the One, we meet the buildings tenants: Reggie (Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez) bent on working out only one side of his body (!); Mr. Dury (the always fine Jeffrey Wright) who is committed to solving crossword puzzles with his son Joey (Noah Gray-Cabey); a Mrs. Hill (Mary Beth Hurt) who seems to have spiritual affinities; the odd Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin) who foresees things; a newspaper critic (Bob Balaban); a writer Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan himself), who appears to be the One who will answer the goal of Story, and his sister Anna (Sarita Choudhury): and a bizarre group of smokers and a family of Hispanic immigrant sisters.  All of these characters are woven into the conclusion of the bedtime story as we watch the intial tale come to resolution.It plays better on paper than on film as there are so many loops and problems with the plot that it becomes silly.  But the film is saved by the actors, Giamatti especially, who makes us love him and his very troubled past shrouded in secrets, and Howard who truly does allow us to suspend disbelief in her otherworldly portrayal of the lonely and needy water nymph.  You simply have to be in the mood for this kind of film and forgive Shyamalan his oversights and vanity, and if you can do that it is a pleasant little diversion.

1027981,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000JLTR8Q,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 7]","There is something strange going on at an apartment complex in Philadelphia. Sprinklers keep getting set off and building super Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) hears splashing noises from the pool at night. One evening, he finds that these noises are being caused by a sea nymph (Bryce Dallas Howard) residing in the water. He befriends her and comes to learn that she is a narf, a fragile fairy tale creature from the Blue World, trying desperately to return home. But, first, she has a purpose she must carry out here in the ""real"" world. She must locate the Chosen One, a writer who will someday change the world (guess who plays that role?). A nightmarish monster called a scrunt is after her, intent on keeping her trapped in this world. The stuttering, unassuming Cleveland Heep and several apartment tenants band together and attempt to help the despairing damsel in distress. But things get even weirder and more frightening when they realize that they, too, are part of a bedtime story. According to storytime lore, the narf can summon to her aid a Protector, a Guide, a Healer, and the Guild. Somewhere in the building are these people, somehow having been drawn to the narf. Cleveland must find them before time runs out.Paul Giamatti (Sideways) is perfectly good as the everyman lead character and he carries the movie as best he can. His Cleveland Heep is no macho hero; he is very self-effacing. He's the kind of guy who passes you by on the streets without eliciting a second of your thoughts. And he has a secret. The willowy Bryce Dallas Howard (The Village, Book of Love) imbues her character Story (yes, Story) with a sense of otherwordly presence. In regarding Story, adjectives such as ""waiflike,"" ""gossamery,"" and ""ethereal"" inevitably pop up. The third character to make an impact on me is Bill Irwin as Mr. Leeds, the pompous movie critic who delivers a humorous monologue before getting his come-uppance.Writer/Director/BooMaster M. Night Shyamalan has had his share of cinematic homeruns (The 6th Sense, Signs) and strike outs (Unbreakable, The Village), so I didn't know what to expect walking into The Lady in the Water. After two hours, I walked out with a perplexed feeling of ""Huh! Is that it?"" This definitely is a beautifully crafted movie in terms of how it looks on the screen. But it's a mess. Shyamalan clearly has things of deep meaning he wants to convey but his story comes off as stilted, contrived, and a bit self-serving.I found myself drowning in the writer/director's feel-good formula of destiny and belief in one's sense of purpose. Done right, I would've welcomed his message. As it is, it comes off as pretentious. Shyamalan's world building (fairy tale building?) here is poorly done, with storybook details coming abruptly out of left field. Cleveland has a question about something? Boom, just go to the disgruntled Asian mother in the building, who has extensive knowledge of the narf fairy tale. The pace of the movie is plodding. There are too many onerous, drawn out sequences wherein Cleveland just knocks on doors and has conversations with tenants. These talks do pay off in the end, but c'mon...some editing, please. Too much time is spent on Cleveland trying to riddle out who exactly are the archetypal characters who will save Story. I also found it astounding that everyone in the film instantly took the fairy tale premise in stride. In the last half hour or so, the film becomes even more unfocused as people who, before, only had fleeting  moments of camera time now all of a sudden become key to the storyline. And don't tell me you didn't see the identity of the Healer coming a mile away.Shyamalan, fortunately, still has the ability to take you on a creepy excursion in his spook house. He still knows how to mesh musical score, camera angles and built-in viewer anticipation to set up a good scare. There were a few times when I almost jumped in my seat. But, sadly, these moments are not enough to tide the movie over. Also, the ending felt a bit too abrupt. Instead of being a clarion call to the imagination, Lady in the Lake muddles up the pool and leaves you treading water in the dark.Do I recommend it? Well, yes, actually I do. As I've said, it's still a beautiful movie and its heart is in the right place. And it's worth watching for Paul Giamatti's riveting, masterful performance alone. But, yeah, it could've been better.

1027982,A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD,B000JLTR8Q,"Heath Buckmaster ""_heath_""","[1, 4]","Once again I had really high hopes for this movie for no other reason than Bryce Dallas Howard. Although I do NOT agree with using the same actor in back-to-back films from the same director, I adored her in The Village and hoped that she could salvage any problems that Lady in the Water might have. I was wrong.The premise of this movie is a bedtime story that M. Night told his children. He turned it into a picture book, and then decided to make the movie to kick it off (though hoping that the book would live on well beyond the movie - you learn this in one of the featurettes on the disc). A note to viewers who might be expecting this movie to have one of his signature 'twists' in the last five minutes - you won't get it...it's not that kind of movie.This is a children's story brought to life at a local apartment complex, where a woman from the Blue World arrives to help man find his way again. Only one person in the entire movie finds their way, and it happens to be M. Night's character - he has a lot more than just a cameo in this movie and turns out to be the only character who actually changes because of his experience with the Lady.The lead male, Paul Giamatti, seems to have some deep rooted motivation that we learn about but he never acts upon. He believes the story of the narf so completely with absolutely no reason to do so. It's almost as if he's become a little child who believes anything someone tells him - no matter how far fetched it might be. He must protect the Lady until this great eagle comes to take her away for no reason. She's there for about 2 days, then gone. I'm not sure how she expects to teach man to get back on the right path in two days, but I'm not the writer/producer/director.There are exactly three special effects that I counted in the movie - one is a doglike creature made of grass, two are the monkeylike creatures made of trees, and three is an eagle that we can barely see but is massively big.The only thing that got me through this were the peripheral characters - a film critic (Bob Balaban) who comes to an untimely end, an asian girl and her grandmother who provide endless comic relief, five hispanic sisters who steal the opening sequence of the movie (which actually had me laughing out loud for several minutes), and M. Night's character and said character's sister.But again, no motivation.

1027984,A39VKDG484JXXA,B000JLTR8Q,H. E. Paul,"[1, 2]","Somehow I missed this movie when it came out. I recently had the opportunity to view the movie and I was very impressed. I have a couple of famous storytellers in my family tree, so I always enjoy a good story. This movie is exactly that, it is the big-screen version of a good story.Part of the wonder of the story is in the mystery. I think the less said about the plot the better, because the characters in the movie learn about the story as the plot unfolds. The story is told briefly in the beginning of the movie, so you have to pay close attention so the rest of the plot will make sense. It can be very easy to get lost and not know what is going on if you don't pay close attention throughout the movie.The only reason I knock off a star is because there is a point where I think one of the director's signature plot twists is attempted. I say attempted because up until that point I was staying with the story closely. I got completely lost about the time the twist was executed, because I felt the pace picked up a bit and the telling of the story seemed a bit rushed. By the time I figured out what was happening again, the magic of the plot twist was lost on me.I think this is a very interesting movie overall. It definitely requires viewing more than once to really take it all in.I think the main problem where people have trouble with these movies is the material for the trailers advertising them is very misleading. I originally thought from the ads that this was supposed to be a horror movie of some kind. While there are moments of intense action and frightening scenes, they are few and far between.Watching this movie made me feel like a kid again and brought to my rememberence the times when my mom would tell me stories at bedtime.

The whole purpose of the boring Village was to try to throw you a tweest, but it did not prepare me for the cinematic train-wreck that is Lady in the Water.In the opening scene we see M. Night flaunting his camera style where we see a bunch of people reacting to Paul Giammati squashing some bug, ok so they can act, let's see them act out a fairy tale pinched out of M. Night himself. So Paul Giammati's the maintainence guy of this apartment complex that's main/only attraction seems to be this gigantic pool in the middle, where he finds some nymph who claims she's from the 'blue world' or some dumb crap like that.Eventually she meets all of the apartment residents and finds M. Night Shymalan playing himself in his most humble role yet: the savior of mankind through his stories. The story is so stupid and jumbled that I got the impression that Dingdong made up the story as it went along, and speaking of which the lady is named 'Story', I can just picture Shyamalan thinking ""this is genius, like me"" to himself when he thought that dumb name up. 'Stor-f*** this I'm calling her lady' is apparently motivating, she convinces Giammati not to kill himself and reveals the other tenants true purpose, but all you really see her do is hug her knees in the shower and stared blankly, wow real motivating.So later when the characters are going on their adventure trying to figure out who's role is who (instead of working like normal people) they get a film critic to help, and he ends up screwing it up because he thinks he knows how to choose the roles by movies. Oh yeah, and one person dies in this movie, guess who? That's right, the wormy, snobby critic who hates everything, just like in real life! That's right Shymalan, keep rubbing your, *ehem* 'ego' while writing this self-congratulatory s***. When the critic is confronted by a monster he says to himself ""I'm going to narrowly escape, almost getting killed but not quite"", then BAM! He dies! TAKE THAT CRITICS, YOU THINK MY MOVIES ARE S***, I'LL WIPE OUT A PLANET-LOAD OF CRITICS IF YOU DON'T STOP CRITICIZING MY MOVIES! OH GOD I'M CUMM-anyways no one seems to care that the critic has died, and they're all going through some weird impromptu formula for the lady to get picked up by a giant eagle (lord of the rings anyone? oh wait, it's name was Eagatron or whatever so I guess it's suddenly original).M. Night Shyamalan's character is an amazing brilliant writer that's way ahead of his time apparently. He's going to write a novel that will one day inspire peace and end war, however his book is controversial and leads up to him inevitably getting assassinated, and he knows this and writes the book anyways. Wow, now DingDong is drawing comparisons of himself to Christ, never in the history of movies have I seen such an egotistical little man write himself as the voice of God, I think at the end of the initial screening only one person was still in the theater standing in applause, M. Night Shyamalan of course. Maybe one day we can all come to recognize his genius, because his scripts are definately going to change the world one day, just look at the Happening's brilliant script of killer plants.",1,One Expensive Masturbatory Fantasy,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,3402,"['Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'Signs', 'were', 'masterpieces', 'can', 'argue', 'better', 'what', 'kinda', 'saw', 'downfall', 'Signs', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'manifest', 'got', '2004', 'snooze-fest', 'Village', 'whole', 'purpose', 'boring', 'Village', 'was', 'try', 'throw', 'tweest', 'did', 'not', 'prepare', 'cinematic', 'train-wreck', 'Lady', 'Water.In', 'opening', 'scene', 'see', 'M.', 'Night', 'flaunting', 'camera', 'style', 'where', 'see', 'bunch', 'people', 'reacting', 'Paul', 'Giammati', 'squashing', 'bug', 'ok', 'so', 'can', 'act', 'let', 'see', 'act', 'out', 'fairy', 'tale', 'pinched', 'M.', 'Night', 'So', 'Paul', 'Giammati', 'maintainence', 'guy', 'apartment', 'main/only', 'attraction', 'be', 'gigantic', 'pool', 'middle', 'where', 'nymph', 'who', ""'blue"", 'world', 'dumb', 'crap', 'that.Eventually', 'apartment', 'residents', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shymalan', 'playing', 'most', 'humble', 'role', 'yet', 'savior', 'mankind', 'stories', 'story', 'so', 'stupid', 'jumbled', 'got', 'impression', 'Dingdong', 'made', 'up', 'story', 'went', 'along', 'speaking', 'lady', 'named', ""'Story"", 'can', 'just', 'picture', 'Shyamalan', 'thinking', 'genius', 'when', 'thought', 'dumb', 'name', 'up', ""'Stor-f***"", ""'m"", 'calling', 'lady', 'apparently', 'motivating', 'Giammati', 'not', 'kill', 'reveals', 'other', 'tenants', 'true', 'purpose', 'really', 'see', 'do', 'hug', 'knees', 'shower', 'stared', 'blankly', 'wow', 'real', 'motivating.So', 'later', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'adventure', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'role', 'who', 'instead', 'working', 'normal', 'people', 'get', 'film', 'critic', 'help', 'up', 'screwing', 'up', 'how', 'choose', 'roles', 'movies', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'one', 'person', 'movie', 'guess', 'who', 'right', 'wormy', 'snobby', 'critic', 'who', 'everything', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'right', 'Shymalan', 'keep', 'rubbing', '*ehem*', 'writing', 'self-congratulatory', 's***', 'When', 'critic', 'confronted', 'monster', ""'m"", 'going', 'narrowly', 'escape', 'almost', 'getting', 'killed', 'not', 'quite', 'then', 'BAM', 'TAKE', 'CRITICS', 'YOU', 'THINK', 'MY', 'MOVIES', 'ARE', 'S***', ""'LL"", 'OUT', 'PLANET-LOAD', 'CRITICS', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'STOP', 'CRITICIZING', 'MY', 'MOVIES', 'OH', 'GOD', ""'M"", 'CUMM-anyways', 'one', 'care', 'critic', 'died', ""'re"", 'going', 'weird', 'impromptu', 'formula', 'lady', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'giant', 'eagle', 'lord', 'rings', 'anyone', 'oh', 'wait', 'name', 'was', 'Eagatron', 'so', 'guess', 'suddenly', 'original', '.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'character', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'apparently', 'going', 'write', 'novel', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'inspire', 'peace', 'end', 'war', 'however', 'book', 'controversial', 'up', 'inevitably', 'getting', 'assassinated', 'book', 'Wow', 'now', 'DingDong', 'drawing', 'comparisons', 'Christ', 'never', 'history', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'egotistical', 'little', 'man', 'write', 'voice', 'God', 'think', 'end', 'initial', 'screening', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'was', 'still', 'theater', 'standing', 'applause', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'course', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'can', 'come', 'recognize', 'genius', 'scripts', 'are', 'definately', 'going', 'change', 'world', 'one', 'day', 'just', 'look', 'Happening', 'brilliant', 'script', 'killer', 'plants']",N/A

Prior to seeing the film, I read a number of critical appraisals.  Some were positive, some not.  One critic rated it shamelessly in the middle, saying it was a painfully bad script - but one that worked.  In short, many critics are seeing the film with different eyes than their colleagues.  Two review excerpts:First, a positive one from Desson Thomson of the Washington Post: ""Until now, Shyamalan's work has been one of masterful trickery, designed to keep audiences spellbound until the end credits. But for the first time, the filmmaker illuminates a world beyond scheme, beyond the shell games of his earlier films. In ""Lady in the Water,"" we no longer think of his characters as mere slaves of the narrative but mazes unto themselves. The eventual outcome of their lives is something we contemplate long after the movie has ended. That's the mark of an artist who makes it his business to push the boundaries of storytelling in Hollywood. And that's exciting.""Second, a negative one from Rick Warner of Bloomberg News: ""M. Night Shyamalan made a movie about ominous signs, so he probably should have detected one when Walt Disney Co. executives told him they couldn't understand his script for Lady in the Water.  Instead, he pitched the story to Warner Bros., which agreed to make the film about a grief-stricken apartment manager who discovers a nymph-like woman in the community swimming pool.  The result is one of the most preposterous and pretentious movies I've ever seen, a waterlogged disaster from its solemn start to its hokey finish.""Me?  I've seen hundreds and hundreds of films (I managed theaters for 12 years).  And based on what I saw at my theater today, I would have to agree with Mr. Thomson of the Washington Post.  At the same time, I can understand why Warner and other critics quickly pounced on Shyamalan.  To many critics, his first film, The Sixth Sense, is used as a yardstick against which his subsequent films are measured.  And, having seen his earlier films, I must say this is a departure for Shyamalan.  But, as Thomson said, ""...we no longer think of his characters as mere slaves of the narrative but mazes unto themselves.""Thomson was merely open-minded enough to watch the movie with different eyes than he watched Shyamalan's previous films ... a talent many film critics lack.

1027994,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B000JLTR8Q,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[15, 24]","I am a HUGE M. Night fan, and eagerly anticipated the release of Lady in the Water. I've just returned from seeing the movie with my husband, and have several thoughts to share with you.Whether a person will love or hate this movie will depend on several factors, in my opinion. Those who will love the movie will likely be:*Those with a strong Magical Child archetype in their psyche*The hopeful and optimistic*Those who believe in the goodness of humanity (or, at least, believe humanity is worth/capable of redemption*Those who enjoy pondering personal meaning and how everything fits together*Those who think M. Night ""gets it"" (if you don't know what ""it"" is, then you're not ""one of those""...so don't worry about it)*Those who enjoy character driven storiesThose who will NOT like the movie are those who:*Did not like The Village*Are fans of mindless horror/slashers*Those who don't like to think about the meaning of life or what their purpose in life may be (or if, indeed, they have one)*Those who like to be spoonfed*Those who need dazzling special effects in order to feel that they were ""entertained""*The cynicalNow, I have to say that my husband is as rabid an M. Night fan as I am...but he was disappointed in The Lady in the Water. I knew it as soon as I looked over at him after the movie ended.We had our usual post-movie discussion, and here are some of our thoughts and observations.First off, ya gotta give M. Night credit for taking the risk of breaking with Disney. When Disney saw the script for this movie, they balked. So Night stormed off to WB to make The Lady in the Water. I respect anyone who stands by his/her creation even in spite of opposition.My husband felt that this story wasn't tight like Night's other movies, and he's right. Everything is ""just so"" in Signs and The Village, for example, showing what a brilliant story engineer Night can be. This movie, though, is a bit more loose--abstract. It's as if Night has a message to get out--and he provides several ways to highlight this message in the film. These ""messages"" include:1. All people are connected2. Every action affects the whole3. Everyone has a purposeThere are hints of these themes in Night's other films, but they are much more obvious in Lady in the Water--especially via character dialogue. I very much appreciate the fact that Night ""sees"" these themes and wishes to convey them, perhaps because they are a part of my own worldview.This film reminded me of the them of The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom, which proposes that no life is insignificant. (In other words, there are no ""losers""). And when you watch the unlikey ""heroes"" of Lady in the Water, I think you'll get that vibe, too.I have a hard time being purely critical/cerebral when it comes to M. Night's work, because it touches me on such a deep level. Profoundly and powerfully, in fact. However, if I were to go ""left brain"" only, I will say that the ending is anti-climatic. This is because Night builds the suspense earlier (""Is he the Guardian? No, wait...is it her? Who is The Guild? Who is the Healer? Who is the Symbolist that interprets the message of what everyone needs to do?""), and when you realize individuals aren't who you thought--well, the ""replacements"" become anti-climatic.So purely analyzing the script--yeah, it may seem untidy in the telling. In fact, I was surprised at the simplistic opening that told the mythos behind the movie. I know that although ""show, don't tell"" is the cardinal rule of storytelling, it is sometimes necessary to to do some backstory to bring viewers up to speed. But the cartoonish hieroglyph seemed so--I dunno...stripped down?--and the narration was sometimes hard to catch. In fact, if I hadn't read a review of the movie before I saw it (something I usually NEVER do!), I may not have heard/understood what a narf or scrunt was based on the brief introduction.The entire movie takes place within an enclosed housing complex, so the atmosphere is a bit claustrophobic. Perhaps this is the mood Night intended to evoke. If one of his commentaries was, in fact, that every individual has a purpose--and that greatness can rise from bleak circumstances (or just the realm of ""quiet desperation"" of mundane purposeless that so many seem to abide in)--then the setting was perfect.Paul Giamatti was brilliant. He's an amazing actor as it is, but I think Cleveland Heep is his best role yet. He is so darn believable as an ""everyman"" building supervisor.Bryce Dallas Howard was amazing in The Village, but unfortunately, she doesn't have much to do in this film other than look like a bewildered narf out of water.Another point my husband made, and with which I concur: would all of the tenants jump on board so quicky to Cleveland's fantastical (or even schizophrenic?) scheme? Heck, the way most of humanity is so distrustful and cynical (even with familiar others), they'd likely slam the door in his face. (Or worse, call the cops.) So it's a big stretch that all these tenants would not only believe Cleveland's story, but jump right in to help. (Except maybe the pot smoking ""guild"".)Sure, on one level, there may be quite a bit to pick apart and criticize. But one thing that holds true for this film is that, if you can see beyond your nose (or at least wish to but for a moment), there is a lot to ponder. Although M. Night's message was clear, he didn't spoon feed it to us. That is, one may come away with the spark of hope that one's life does, indeed, have a purpose--and that no act (or person) is isolated. Because scenes of American troops in war was on the TV early in the movie, it makes this message even more relevant...offering the unspoken question ""How do I contribute to war? How do I contribute to peace? Can I--do I--really make a difference?""One of the characters in the movie mentions that finding one's purpose is no small thing--and that it is a matter of finding one's voice. What does that mean? M. Night doesn't tell you, because the journey is 9/10ths of the process of finding voice/purpose.There's an unique character in the movie that only works out one side of his body. He considers it a ""science experiment"". One would probably think ""loser"" when passing him. Yet, I was struck by the fact he only exercised the RIGHT part of his body. The right hemisphere of the brain deals with thinking/processing that is:RandomIntuitiveHolisticSynthesizingSubjectiveLooks at wholesPerhaps Night is echoing what authors like Dr. Jean Shinoda-Bolen (Urgent Messages from Mother) have been saying: it's time to tap into the creative, innovative, problem solving and often NEGLECTED side of our brain (the right hemisphere) in order to not only end war, but also to realize our own magnificence and potential.I feel that The Lady in the Water offers us a glimpse of M. Night, the man--moreso than any of his movies thus far. While Night retains the belief in hope and goodness, there's an underlying vibe that he's disenchanted with ""the machine"" (which is pretty darn left-brain/bottom line). Maybe the fact that the book/movie critic in The Lady sees an *ahem* interesting treatment contributed to this sense.No one ""steals the show"" in this movie--really, they're all ""everyman"" (even the narf that doesn't realize she's ""something special"" to her people)--and so one can take away from this movie what they will. There is no Superman flying out of the CGI sky, nor is there a swashbuckling pirate to save the day. No--by gazing into the somewhat bland, non-descript plot of The Lady in the Water we are actually being prodded to look within.Maybe it's time that humanity started looking within for the answer--instead of without. Maybe individuals need to start looking within to see what the contribute to the world--for good or ill. Maybe humanity does, indeed, need a savior...and that savior is ""I"".I'll leave you with one last thing: with Lady in the Water, M. Night proves he has some serious comedic chops. There were SEVERAL laugh out loud moments in this film. It was surprising--and delightful! It was good to see this side of storyteller Night.Oh, and rather than do a short cameo like Night does in his other films, he has a pretty significant part in this one. It's actually a bit sad, especially with the martyr archetype element. My husband thinks Night should stick to ""behind the camera"" work, but I think Night was just fine in this role as a writer.It would be nice if there was, indeed, a ""Cookbook"" that would stir the masses and provoke change. Heck, the last time that happened on a significant level was 2,000 years ago.Here's hoping, though...",5,Cookbook (For Those Who Have Ears to Hear),1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,8633,"['am', 'HUGE',

His earlier works have been very cynical, and sometimes dark which I had fun watching. This film, in the other hand, ventures away from that and the characters are in a dissimilar light. M. Night somehow made a movie that is compatible with children, and just as compatible with the adult. The humor doesn't lose its touch halfway through the movie, and in some respects the humor adds to the sadness.  The opening tells us that this is a children's story, pretty much about good vs. evil and visually suggests that the people from the water are like angels.The whole plot is laid out right there; the depiction of it in character, in dialog, in camera shots, is compelling to the very end. The casts, mostly whom are less character-driven but are caricatures on the screen, gave good performances. The acting by Paul Giamati and Bryce Dallas Howard were true to their roles. M. Night Shyamalan appearances are always appealing to me. I even like how he summarily dealt with critics but after watching this I have clearly seen that this wasn't his best efforts.The soundtrack explodes when it needs to and whispers when it doesn't. Night is wise to employ Christopher Doyle (2046, Infernal Affairs, In The Mood For Love) as the cinematographer. Doyle is a genuine architect of angles, mood and atmosphere when it comes to hand-held cameras. For me, this movie is a painting and Night is the painter. We, as viewers, can never understand an artist. So did the people at Disney, who rejected his sixth drafted script.

Everything seemed right; A modern fairlytale with an allegorical tale to tell, a great cast including the always entertaining Paul Giamatti, a wonderful score by James Newton Howard and M. Night Shyamalan writing and directing.  Seems like everything is in it's right place.  Unfortunately the story doesn't quite work.  Even with its slow pace, the narrative seems rushed.  Key story points unfold and we know its supposed to be meaningful and important - the music tells us this, the actors expressions tell us this and even the camera work tells us this.  But we never quite grasp what it is we're supposed to be moved by.  By the time we reach the climactic final scene the pieces don't seem to add up.  The film maintains a nice mood even with the broad comic bits in between.  In fact Bob Balaban has the best scene in the film. His film critic cynicism does him in and as an audience we can relate.  We were expecting one thing and got another.  There are no twists and turns in this one as most audiences have come to expect from Shyamalan...and that's just fine.  But with such direct story telling the story better be a good one.  Casting himself as the writer/martyr/vissionary is a bit annoying as well.

1028002,A2JXM2910HL9FY,B000JLTR8Q,"JG ""Jake""","[7, 13]","With this ""Bedtime Story"", M. Night Shyamalan appears to be trying to move into new territory and new genres, having hit a dead-end with The Village. From the creepy and powerful ""The Sixth Sense"", through to the underwhelming ""Unbreakable"", to the almost powerful ""Signs"" and finally the ultimately unsatisfying and self-parodying ""The Village"", it seemed that M. Night Shyamalan had begun recycle his Auteurist and stylistic conventions, and now has continued to do so with Lady In The Water. Although M. Night Shyamalan has moved into the fantasy genre with this one, he brings along all the baggage from what has come before.Aiming for the movie to be a ""bedtime story"" and so a fantasy film that kids can be amazed by, and also mature enough for adult audiences, Shyamalan is successful. Using his unique visual style which prefers the long-take over the rapid-fire shot-reverse-shot style used for sequences of dialogue and action, Shyamalan creates a believable environment with slowly creeping tense pace. Colorful characters populate the apartments of the complex where Cleveland Heep (an awesome performance by Giammati) acts as the groundskeeper and handy-man. And with the real-time pacing of the film and the subtle editing, we feel right at home in ""The Cove"" where we spend the next couple hours residing in. Stylistically, Shyamalan succeeds at taking his unique set of stylistic conventions and applied them to another genre of film.Where Shyamalan takes a fall however is the unimpressive plot. Granted though, Shyamalan is taking baby-steps here, writing a plot that is not horror related at-all, and calls less for suspense and tension. There is no massive third-act plot twist here, although Shyamalan throws in quite small ones here and there. And so, what unfolds is somewhat monotonous. Keep in mind though that Shyamalan is making a transition. The back-story for the characters is very well-developed, it's just what's onscreen that needs fine-tuning.Though the film itself is kind of a let down, it's only fair that we give Shyamalan a break, after all he's trying to make a new start, which is the only right choice for him to make. If Shyamalan proceeded to make variations of suspense and horror films I feel it would have had bad results. There is lots of potential in this film, and there is promise for great things to come from Shyamalan.

1028003,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000JLTR8Q,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[6, 11]","I'd basically give Lady in the Water ** 1/2. It's well acted even if everyone just talks as if they're reading the script that exact same moment. I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies but he has actors act so emotionless in his movies where they basically just talk like robots through most the movie.  It's like he's after getting wooden performances from his actors. I'm surprised he hasn't worked with Keanu Reeves yet.  His only movie that wasn't like that was probably the Sixth Sense. I also loved the under-rated and unappreciated Unbreakable and Signs as well. I never minded the slow paces of his films because they always led to something good. Here we just get a lot of talented actors talking and trying to help the  Lady in the Water (Bryce Dallas Howard) but without them or us even knowing why they wanna help her. The talented  Paul Giamatti just trys to figure out how a story book goes and what it has to do with her. It's like he just found her in his pool yet he knows she has something to do with that book. Well that's how it seemed to me anyway, like everyone just decides to help her the second they meet her.Giamatti is good in every role he's in and is good here too but his performance is the best thing about the movie. It's him that really has your attention the whole time in the movie. Everyone else isn't bad but they aren't as captivating as Giamatti. I guess Dallas Howard is a little too but all she really gets to do is make a blank stare with a scared look on her face through the whole thing. M. Night Shyamalan has to make an acting appearance in the film as well of course but he needs to give that a break already even if he is a decent actor. I mean Alfred Hitchcock just made small appearances in his movies, he didn't cast himself in supporting roles.Plus his movie critic character seems to be actually talking about M. Night Shyamalan movies. I mean he knocks a movie that has nothing but people just speaking their minds unrealistically through-out the movie. That sounds a lot like this movie..... I have to admit that when his films come to life at the end they always manage to get me teared up but I think that's just the power of James Newtown Howard's musical score abilities. The scene that his score gets pumped up is when it's reveiled who the guardian of the Lady in the Water is and that scene's what got my tears going lol. It's the most lively and well done scene in the movie even if it is a little silly. But it probably wouldn't of had that effect on me if it wasn't for the musical score.  M. Night Shyamalan should just make those Unbreakable sequels that he had planned. I mean he didn't make them due to bad reviews but the Village and Lady in the Water probably got worse reviews. So he might as well make Unbreakable sequels because at least that was very well liked by some people like myself.",2,Not  Shyamalan's best,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,2860,"[""'d"", 'basically', 'give', 'Lady', 'Water', '**', '1/2', 'well', 'acted', 'even', 'everyone', 'just', 'talks', ""'re"", 'reading', 'script', 'exact', 'same', 'moment', 'like', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'movies', 'actors', 'act', 'so', 'emotionless', 'movies', 'where', 'basically', 'just', 'talk', 'robots', 'most', 'movie', 'getting', 'wooden', 'performances', 'actors', ""'m"", 'surprised', ""n't"", 'worked', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'yet', 'only', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'probably', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'also', 'loved', 'under-rated', 'unappreciated', 'Unbreakable', 'Signs', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'minded', 'slow', 'paces', 'films', 'always', 'led', 'something', 'good', 'Here', 'just', 'get', 'lot', 'talented', 'actors', 'talking', 'trying', 'help', 'Lady', 'Water', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'even', 'knowing', 'why', 'wan', 'help', 'talented', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'just', 'trys', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'story', 'book', 'what', 'do', 'just', 'found', 'pool', 'yet', 'something', 'do', 'book', 'Well', 'how', 'seemed', 'anyway', 'everyone', 'just', 'help', 'second', 'meet', 'her.Giamatti', 'good', 'role', 'good', 'here', 'too', 'performance', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'really', 'attention', 'whole', 'time', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'else', ""n't"", 'bad', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'captivating', 'Giamatti', 'guess', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'little', 'too', 'really', 'do', 'make', 'blank', 'stare', 'scared', 'look', 'face', 'whole', 'thing', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'make', 'acting', 'appearance', 'film', 'well', 'course', 'give', 'break', 'already', 'even', 'decent', 'actor', 'mean', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'just', 'made', 'small', 'appearances', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'cast', 'supporting', 'roles.Plus', 'movie', 'critic', 'character', 'be', 'actually', 'talking', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'movies', 'mean', 'movie', 'nothing', 'people', 'just', 'speaking', 'minds', 'unrealistically', 'through-out', 'movie', 'lot', 'movie', '..', 'have', 'admit', 'when', 'films', 'come', 'life', 'end', 'always', 'manage', 'get', 'teared', 'up', 'think', 'just', 'power', 'James', 'Newtown', 'Howard', 'musical', 'score', 'abilities', 'scene', 'score', 'pumped', 'up', 'when', 'reveiled', 'who', 'guardian', 'Lady', 'Water', 'scene', 'what', 'got', 'tears', 'going', 'lol', 'most', 'lively', 'well', 'done', 'scene', 'movie', 'even', 'little', 'silly', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'had', 'effect', 'was', ""n't"", 'musical', 'score', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'should', 'just', 'make', 'Unbreakable', 'sequels', 'had', 'planned', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'due', 'bad', 'reviews', 'Village', 'Lady', 'Water', 'probably', 'got', 'worse', 'reviews', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'Unbreakable', 'sequels', 'least', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'liked', 'people']",N/A
1028004,A3OFB18116P6RM,B000JLTR8Q,J. L. Reimer,"[4, 10]","I wanted to love M. Night Shyamalan's film, Lady in the Water. Moving in a different direction from his trademark style as evidenced by films like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and The Village, Shyamalan delivers a fairytale about an apartment superintendent who rescues a young woman in the complex's swimming pool. With the help of some of the other tenants, he must uncover information about her and her world in order to help her return home. While based on his book of the same name, the movie is wholly original introducing a world of characters not in the book.Paul Giamatti, who does a wonderful job as the superintendent who is more than he seems, leads the cast. Tragedy has led his character to distance himself from others, observing the tenants of his world without involvement. Discovering the young woman, revealed to be a character from a fairytale called a Narf, reasserts his confidence and starts a process of reconnection to others beginning with the tenants he recruits to help him with his charge.Bryce Dallas Howard plays the titular role of the Lady in the Water. She does a good job with the role but is given very little to do and even less dialogue. I left the film feeling I knew as little about her and her world as I came in with. However, the film isn't so much about her as it is about her effect on the people championed to help her with her journey home.It's a unique and interesting cast of characters who inhabit the world of the apartment complex. There is a critic who foreshadows events by his knowledge of movies, a man obsessed with crossword puzzles, a Korean woman and her granddaughter who know the legend of the young woman's world, a man who is conducting an experiment of building up his musculature on only one side of his body among others. Somewhat distracting is M. Night Shyamalan narcissistically casting himself as a writer whose work is so profound it will change the world.Because the characters and their actions were written so broadly and stereotypically, it was often difficult to tell if these were supposed to be real people mystically brought together to mirror the fairytale or if they were part of the fairytale being told. Always quirky, the characters interactions are frequently funny while the creatures trying to prevent the young woman from returning home are often frightening. The computer-generated presentation of the creatures is interesting and adds to the atmosphere because they are never clearly seen. They are seen mostly through darkness and in shadows with lights, sound and description used for enhanced effect.While I enjoyed the movie, I left feeling something was missing and wanting more. The ending felt abrupt and incomplete, adding to the confusion. If these were supposed to be real people drawn together to help a young woman only known because of a fairytale, the potential for growth existed for all of the tenants in this journey but the film stops short of showing how any of them are changed for their experience.

I've seen ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" and found them moderately interesting, especially the latter. Not so for this movie. This was the most incoherent, inane, soporific piece of trash that's every put me to sleep and had me wake up wishing the movie was all just a bad dream. Does the fact that Mr. Shyamalan has made a few big time movies give him the right to effectively defecate unto a film reel and market it to the public as entertainment? I just thank God I rented this movie from the library and avoided putting a single dime into the pockets of Mr. M. Night. I literally felt insulted after viewing ""Lady in the Water.""

So when the Lady in the Water's trailer began to show in theatres, I was giddy with delight. But then I saw the film. I enjoyed it, and was entertained, but I found myself wanting more. I was used to getting sucked into his films, and this, although coming close, simply fell short.That being said, I truly believe M. Night is paying homage to three of the greatest fantasy writers of all time in this film: Stephen King, L. Frank Baum (Wizard of Oz), and J.R.R. Tolkien. I deduced this from three sets of characters in the film - we have a lawn wolf that is literally made of grass and hedge (see the monsters from The Shining), we have an evil group of flying monkeys (see Wizard of Oz), and there is also the eagle that represents safety and closure (see the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings).The plots involves a group of apartment dwellers who discover a mysterious women who may possess knowledge that will help heal the world. Of course, there are forces of evil that wish to keep her from doing this, and the neighbors rally around her to ensure her safety.All-in-all, Lady in the Water is an entertaining film with an original plot. The film is doing okay at the box office right now (it's brough in 22 million and cost 55 million) but this is not your typical Shyamalan. Rather, this film appears to be his little pet project, one conjured up from those nights he told this tale to his own children.

Virtually everyone I know who'd seen the film warned me against a viewing. Critics used the movie as target practice. The flick even managed to pick up two ignominious ""Razzie"" Awards (the opposite of the Oscars, to put it kindly), both of which went to M. Night as ""worst director"" and ""worst supporting actor"" of 2006. But how bad could a movie be directed by the guy who made ""Unbreakable,"" an underrated masterpiece?So see it I did, and (to quote P.G. Wodehouse) I'm not disgruntled, but I'm far from gruntled. ""Lady in the Water"" is silly, incoherent, unsatisfying, self-indulgent...and thoroughly watchable. Even entertaining. Because Shyamalan's movies are distinctively his own, and he believes in his own vision. The man's self-faith borders on lunacy, but the predominantly bland, marketing-driven world of modern movies could use a few more eccentric visionaries (even if that eccentric visionary believes WAY too much of his own hype).Speaking of that, M. Night definitely laid an egg when he cast himself in the film as a writer whose words will change the world. Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) prophecies of a ""great orator"" who will one day read his (I mean his character's) book, and ""your book will be the seeds of many of his great thoughts."" Most viewers will consider this offensively hubristic. And so it is, but it's also strangely endearing. Shyamalan actually wants to change the world. When Cleveland, the lovable shlub hero (who else but Paul Giamatti?), is asked by a hermitic tenant whether he believes mankind is worth saving, he answers ""Yes"" without batting an eyelash. I appreciate a filmmaker who dares to invest his stories with an almost desperate need for the transcendent.Maybe that quality is why I can't help but like his movies (haven't seen ""The Happening"" yet... heard it was even worse than this one!), even when they so clearly misfire, as in this case. ""Lady in the Water"" is so un-cynical, it's virtually begging for snide remarks. Shyamalan didn't help himself by trading in his trademark tight storytelling for something sloppy and ill-conceived. But his follies are on a grand scale -- here he aims to make a modern myth and falls precipitously short -- but he's trying, God bless him.

That's all fine a good, and it was a decent idea to being with,but perhaps M. Night Shamalan should not make films of his rough drafts and actually edit and re-write the screenplays a few times before just thinking,""hey,this is a cool idea"" and just make a film based on a catchy title or a page of notes that look like chicken scratch.Whatever it was he was trying to do with Lady in the water, it somehow got lost and just turned out to be a very poorly executed film and it shows terribly.

You can bet Shyamalan's days of studio subsidizing are over now.I knew the critics were dreadful to ""Lady"", but their story descriptions nevertheless intrigued me, and by this time, I've grown used to disliking Shyamalan's films, so I went with no expectations but a lot of hope.  I never, ever expected it to be as ridiculous as it was.  The audience was actually groaning and cat-calling towards the end!Shyamalan's films have wonderful camera work and lighting, but his writing grows more preposterous with each successive movie.  The original premise of ""Lady in the Water"" could easily have worked, but it is so badly thought out and acted that's it's truly astounding anyone with an IQ higher than 50 could have created it.  It is a fairytale, but a child would not be remotely interested in it, because it's so obscure and heavy-handed.  That leaves us adults to wonder.  Why is an Oriental fable-come-to-life loaded with such un-Eastern names as ""narf"" and ""scrunt""?  Why are we waiting for a bird of flight to take our dim-witted heroine back to her water-home?  The plot is loaded with gigantic black holes.I particlarly hated the beginning, where chalk cave drawings come to life and start moving, Paul Giamatti stuttering like he's coughing up a fur ball, and utterly clueless Bryce Howard hiding in the shower for the entire last hour of the movie.  And it made EVERYONE extremely uncomfortable to see a very young woman sitting on an older man's lap, wearing nothing but a shirt!!!I could go on and on.

1028017,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B000JLTR8Q,kacunnin,"[1, 1]","M. Night Shyamalan's LADY IN THE WATER is often cited as the film that changed his career.  While he hoped the film would place him irrevocably among the pantheon of greats (he had been compared to Alfred Hitchcock since his first major film, THE SIXTH SENSE, won critical acclaim in 1999), it ended up as the start of his slide into mediocrity.  The critics were ruthless when LADY was released, and audiences agreed that the film was a muddled mess.  But for some reason I like it.  And I'm not totally sure why.At its heart, LADY IN THE WATER is a fable based on a bedtime story Shyamalan made up for his own children.  The plot centers on a sea nymph named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) who mysteriously appears in the swimming pool of a run-down apartment complex in Philadelphia.  The manager of the complex, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), tries to figure out who Story is, where she came from, and what her mission is.  She tells Heep that she's a ""Narf"" from the ""Blue World"" who has come in search of a writer whose words are destined to change the future.  After she finds him, she can return to the Blue World . . . that is, if she can elude the vicious ""Scrunts"" that are determined to stop her.  To help Story, Cleveland must identify certain people from among the apartment complex's oddball residents to play the roles of ""Healer,"" ""Guardian,"" ""Symbolist,"" and ""Guild.""  Only they can help her get home.There are some really good things about LADY IN THE WATER.  First, Paul Giamatti is phenomenal as beleaguered apartment manager Cleveland Heep.  This is a guy who was once a doctor, with a wife and children . . . but now he's alone and depressed and without an apparent purpose in life.  He is onscreen for almost all of the film's 110 minutes, and he's wonderfully watchable.  Some of the other actors are also quite good, including Bryce Dallas Howard as Story (she comes across as sort of a mermaid with legs), Cindy Cheung as Korean student Young-Soon Choi (who helps Cleveland unravel the strands of the fairy tale), and Bob Balaban has some of the film's funniest moments as a self-absorbed film critic (more on him later).Also, the juxtaposition of the fantastical fairy tale and the very down-to-earth reality of the apartment complex and its residents can be quite charming.  There's something very satisfying in watching Giamatti's character struggle with absurd terms like ""Narf"" and ""Scrunt"" as he tries to figure out whether the guy who spends his days doing crossword puzzles could be the ""Symbolist.""  Is the group of over-the-hill hippies (who smoke and philosophize all day) the ""Guild""?  And is Clevelend himself Story's ""Guardian""?  And does it matter than none of this makes one bit of logical sense?Not really.  But other things do matter.  The fairy tale (or bedtime story, as Shyamalan calls it) is so convoluted, and so difficult to explain, that too much has to be told through exposition.  Heep asks Young-Soon about the story, and she asks her mother (who speaks only Korean) - the conversations between the three of them are meant to inform the viewers, but it loses its charm fairly quickly.  Additionally, it's not at all clear why only these two Korean women have heard this particular fairy tale . . . and why couldn't Heep have just checked on the Internet?  More egregious are the dreadful special effects, which look like something out of the old ""Power Rangers"" TV show.  The Scrunt, which is supposed to be a creature with grass-like fur, looks like a cartoon wolf draped in AstroTurf.  The ""Tarturic"" (described as horrifying creatures sent to stop the Scrunts) look like funny monkeys covered in twigs.  And the supposedly majestic ""Great Eatlon"" (the giant eagle meant to carry Story home to the Blue World at the end of the film) is not really shown at all.  For this film to work, the creatures need to be as real as Story is -- and they are not.But the most difficult problem with LADY IN THE WATER is Shyamalan's insistence on using the film not only for shameless self-promotion (after all, he casts himself as visionary writer Vick Ran, whose words are destined to change the world) but to get revenge against the critics who had the audacity to criticize THE VILLAGE (released the year before LADY).  Bob Balaban's character is a smug, arrogant film critic who mocks the films he's paid to review - his is the only character to die in this film, and it's clear that he is a product of Shyamalan's rage.  These things make the film seem uncomfortably personal, as if we're all watching a Shyamalan home movie, or somehow wading around inside Shyamalan's murky brain.  And the story itself gets lost somewhere along the way.Why do I still like this movie?  I honestly don't know.  I like the idea that myths and fables carry within them a grain of truth.  As Young-Soon tells Heep, ""It's time to prove some stories are real.""  I also like the idea that we all have a purpose in life, but it's not always easy to discover what that purpose is.  In this film, Heep is lost.  He no longer has hope in the future, and at its core LADY is expressing his longing ""to believe in more than this dreadful world.""  That's a longing I share.I see glimpses in this film of what it could have been, had Shyamalan been able to step away from the production enough to see it without his own very personal blinders.  Heep's journey is deeply meaningful, as revealed in the climactic scene when he and the others are finally coming together to help Story.  Through his experiences with her and with those pledged to help her, he finds not only his true purpose but a real understanding of what it means to live.  This is so much more important, and so much more engaging, than the silly side-plot about a writer whose words will save the world.  Shyamalan's films will not save the world.  That is not his purpose, whether he realizes this or not.  LADY IN THE WATER should have been a beautiful little film about one man's spiritual journey.  Even as it is, it's a charming parable worth watching.  See it for what it could have been, rather than for what it is.",3,Charming parable suffers from Shyamalan's self-serving nonsense,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,6108,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan',

1028018,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B000JLTR8Q,- Kasia S.,"[143, 186]","M. Night Shyamalan doesn't do plain movies. As an artists he has his own unique approach of seeing extraordinary tales in mundane things whether its aliens, mythical beasts, ghosts or a mysterious azure pool. This tale is like no other, perhaps can be thought of as a tale of good and evil, of human purpose, common ground and understanding. When a mysterious pale woman with red hair saves an apartment superintendent, who looked like he gave up upon falling into the pool, simply because he didn't see a purpose to living, she brings hope and a sense of purpose to him and other tenants. Together they try to figure out who she is and why she came into their lives.Story, is the name of the woman, perhaps those who save the Village, recognize her as the blind brave daughter Ivy Walker, takes on another roles this time as a narf, a word that does not really exist in an English dictionary but a word that takes on meaning by the time the movie ends. She is a fairy like creature that is on a mission and needs help from Cleveland Heep the stuttering superintendent who loses his stutter and finds his true calling. She needs to find a safe passage back to her own world, which is guarded by an evil wolf like beast, invisible to all but those who know how to find it. Together all the characters have to decipher the answers behind what she says and in all reality they have to save the modern world. She tells one of them that he will be a great orator and his book will change the world, cease wars and bring peace, she tells another that he can heal; others learn that they will have profound impact on the feuding life and who will improve life around them if they take the risks and do what she says.This was a visually stunning and memorable movie, with hair rising music and some really jumpy special effects, especially with the wolf. Yes there are monsters and there are casualties but then there is a sense of purpose, of a mystery coming together brought upon this mysterious creature, who in my interpretation is an angel. She brings hope and love and unites those who sulk and lose their touch. It's a beautiful story that leaves one thinking long after leaving the theater, a story that feeds the soul and feeds a hungry mind ready for something different. It's a fairy tale that leaves one feeling good and light, with hope and understanding of the future. M.

1028020,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000JLTR8Q,Kaya Savas,"[3, 12]","MOVIE: M. Night Shyamalan quietly entered his next film into theaters pretty much unoticed. There was a whole feud between him and Disney (his former distributor) when he presented the script. In fact, Disney basically laughed him off because they thought the script was complete garbage. So in a rage Shyamalan dumped Disney and started selling his script to other companies. Warner Brothers snatched up the script and distributed the film, and guess what? It flopped! BIG TIME! Let me tell you why. The film itself is not contrived or bad, it just has no logic or purpose. The entire theme of the film is finding one's purpose within, but the plot really doesn't lead anywhere. I can't talk that much about it without ruining the mystery of the movie, but let's just say that it doesn't have that piece of Shyamalan magic that made his other films captivating. The atmosphere, the acting, and the characters are all well developed and perfect. However when the movie comes to the end it feels like we went nowhere. Also, the story that takes place in the movie is actually based on a fairy tale, so our main character learns what is supposed to happen by hearing the story. We see him getting more info from the story, and then it happens in reality. So whatever mystery and suspense the movie has is lost. We know what's supposed to happen before it ever takes place. It was very so-so and I was kind of dissapointed because I found The Village to be extremely brilliant.ACTING: Paul Giammati is Shyamalan's next choice for central main character, and he fits the bill like all of Shyamalan's movies. If you look at Bruce Willis's character in The Sixth Sense and Mel Gibbson's character in Signs you will see that they are all male characters who have lost their wives and are now facing some sort of obstacle that in the end changes their understanding on life. Paul Giammati is a superb actor, and he really creates a character with this role. Bryce Dallas Howard gives her character elegance, beauty, and mystery.

Night Shyamalan movie and like most people I have also had my share of problems with them as well. No matter what you think of him or his films he will no doubt always give an interesting story and he does so with Lady in the Water. Like one of the characters say in this film ""the world no longer has any originality"" I definitely agree. With Lady in the Water you get complete originality with a weird array of characters. Paul Giamatti (Cleveland Heep) plays a building manager of an apartment complex that unexpectedly becomes part of a living fairytale.Only thing is you truly don't know if there will be a happy ending or not. While patrolling the swimming pool on a late night Cleveland slips on the wet cement and falls into the pool. He wakes up on his couch to a pale woman with red hair (Bryce Dallas Howard) sitting across from him. She tells him her name is story and that she is scared so he lets her stay for a while. After a bit he carries the sleeping story outside so she can return home but Cleveland is chased back into his home by a wolf like creature. Story won't tell Cleveland too much as she doesn't truly know everything herself. Cleveland finds out from one of the tenants a story that sounds similar to what's been happening around him. He realizes that Story is just trying to go home and that the creature does not want her to go and will kill her before she can get the chance.Unlike the trailer for ""The Village"" what you see in the trailer for ""Lady in the Water"" is what you get in the film. No real big plot twist, Shyamalan left the movie the way it was without the crazy twist. He even has a bigger role in this film and it was a lot better than his past appearances that he's known for. The story itself is what you'll truly appreciate this movie for. Shyamalan put everything together so well that you start to forget that it's totally unreal for these events to happen. It's a type of story that has been done plenty of times in films like ""Kate and Leopold"" or even for kids something like ""A Kid in King Arthur's Court"". ""Lady in the Water"" is done in such a serious manner that you can't really compare it to those other films. The film gets more exciting and interesting as it goes on and more characters start to participate.The apartment complex gave Shyamalan a plethora of characters to work with and he added them very well. Somehow he gave each of them a purpose in the movie and it didn't feel overcrowded in any way. This movie was done with great style that makes it very entertaining. The score and pacing were done in a way that made it feel serene but still got you into the film enough to keep watching. The cinematography is very well done, perfect colors to make the feeling of it complete. This is a movie I would definitely recommend to some but not all as not everyone will be able to let their imaginations go to truly enjoy it.",5,Depends On How Far You Let Your Imagination Go,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,2912,"['have', 'seen', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'also', 'had', 'share', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'films', 'will', 'no', 'doubt', 'always', 'give', 'interesting', 'story', 'so', 'Lady', 'Water', 'one', 'characters', 'say', 'film', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'originality', 'definitely', 'agree', 'Lady', 'Water', 'get', 'complete', 'originality', 'weird', 'array', 'characters', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Cleveland', 'Heep', 'building', 'manager', 'apartment', 'complex', 'unexpectedly', 'part', 'living', 'fairytale.Only', 'thing', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'patrolling', 'swimming', 'pool', 'late', 'night', 'Cleveland', 'wet', 'cement', 'pool', 'up', 'couch', 'pale', 'woman', 'red', 'hair', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'sitting', 'name', 'story', 'scared', 'so', 'stay', 'while', 'bit', 'sleeping', 'story', 'can', 'return', 'home', 'Cleveland', 'chased', 'back', 'home', 'wolf', 'creature', 'Story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Cleveland', 'too', 'much', ""n't"", 'truly', 'know', 'everything', 'Cleveland', 'out', 'one', 'tenants', 'story', 'similar', 'what', 'been', 'happening', 'Story', 'just', 'trying', 'go', 'home', 'creature', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'will', 'kill', 'can', 'get', 'chance.Unlike', 'trailer', 'Village', 'what', 'see', 'trailer', 'Lady', 'Water', 'what', 'get', 'film', 'real', 'big', 'plot', 'twist', 'Shyamalan', 'left', 'movie', 'way', 'was', 'crazy', 'twist', 'even', 'bigger', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'past', 'appearances', 'known', 'story', 'what', ""'ll"", 'truly', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'Shyamalan', 'put', 'everything', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'start', 'forget', 'totally', 'unreal', 'events', 'happen', 'type', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'plenty', 'times', 'films', 'Kate', 'Leopold', 'even', 'kids', 'something', 'A', 'Kid', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Court', 'Lady', 'Water', 'done', 'such', 'serious', 'manner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'other', 'films', 'film', 'more', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'more', 'characters', 'start', 'participate.The', 'apartment', 'complex', 'gave', 'Shyamalan', 'plethora', 'characters', 'work', 'added', 'very', 'well', 'gave', 'purpose', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'overcrowded', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'great', 'style', 'very', 'entertaining', 'score', 'pacing', 'were', 'done', 'way', 'made', 'feel', 'serene', 'still', 'got', 'film', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'cinematography', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'perfect', 'colors', 'make', 'feeling', 'complete', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'not', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'let', 'imaginations', 'go', 'truly', 'enjoy']",N/A

What film critics say about movies became irrelevant to my family long, long ago. What do these folks know about the ""ordinary guy""? Not every movie appeals to everyone. What about those of us who like a slower, insightful film like ""The Village"" or ""Enchanted April"" (not an M. Night film, of course).A writer/director like M. Night is definitely free to take what some call a ""risk"" on a film a little different than his others. That's the benefit of having produced other widely successful pieces. Some folks also just wait for people to ""fail"" in their estimation. I think this piece is better than some of his other films simply by virtue of its simplicity in its primary plot to help one ""ordinary"" man change the world. Isn't that how many men and women of extraordinary ideas are perceived during their lifetime? In M's new film many other ""ordinary"" people are changed by simply working together for a common goal? That is definitely a message that is promoted in today's world (and in the past). When we come to think that only a ""special"" few can make real differences in the world, we lose much of the reason for our existence. Besides, who says that making a ""small"" difference, such as encouraging a child to dream, giving an senior citizen hope in sorrow, or helping a friend get back on track, is any less important. As our film shows us, we cannot see the future or the impact our lives or actions will produce in the future.Take the time to think. Most of us really do so little of it. Just ask those around you.

Usually I'm a fan of Shyamalan's work; SIGNS was good, THE VILLAGE was great, and THE SIXTH SENSE is one of my favorite movies that I've seen to date, but this movie has just proven that he has, at least temporarily, completely lost his mind.The movie begins with an almost completely nonsensical pictograph sequence that muddles the story up from the very beginning, which, we later learn, is a story about narfs, scrunts, and tartutics.  A story with some very odd plot holes.  Madness ensues, as Paul Giamatti (playing an incredibly impassioned yet doomed role) discovers a water nymph (or a ""narf"", as this story would have it), in the apartment swimming pool.  He then commences to try and save the narf from a beast hailed as a ""scrunt"", a wolf-creature made of grass.  I only wish that were the extent of the bizarrity of this film, so that I could have sat back and enjoyed the movie.  But the movie also employs numerous faux pas, possibly intentionally, to prove his point, such as having characters talk to the camera for humerous effect, or showing a person vomiting into a pool for no particular reason.Amidst all the fuss, the scatter-brained characters employ methods such as reading the daily crossword puzzle in the newspaper and interpreting cereal boxes in order to save the narf.  At some points, such as when they're trying to use the crossword puzzle to save her, the movie is almost redeemed by sparks of unintentional wit.  I say almost because it really isn't redeemed at all, it's just a very, very bad movie.  This movie also contains Shyamalan's infamous revenge on the critics who hated THE VILLAGE: he inserts a movie critic, makes him into a complete jerk of a character, has the critic, out of stupidity, steer the main characters in the complete wrong direction, and then kills him off for no particular reason.  Strange.In any case, this is a movie that, even with the acting and directing being as good as it is, I cannot recommend to anybody for any reason other than comedic value.  But what do I know?  Since I'm critiquing this movie so harshly I'm probably going to become the scrunt-bait in Shyamalan's next film.  I just sincerely hope it's better than this one.

However, I still have hope that he will one day duplicate that brilliance in another movie--which is why I saw ""The Lady in the Water"" on opening night.This movie certainly was no Sixth Sense.  It didn't have the heart or the depth.  On the other hand, it was much more interesting a movie than were ""The Village"" and ""Unbreakable.""There were some tense and jumpy moments...some unmistakably funny moments...some deep moments that made me think.  But in the end, it all felt a bit hollow and even a bit hokey.  I mean, after all, everyone in the story automatically bought into the idea that the Lady in the Water was indeed someone special, someone who needed to be saved--and they were willing to sacrifice themselves for this as well.Furthermore, this movie seemed just a tad too much like all his earlier films.  How many times have we heard from Shyamalan that (although we may not know exactly what it is) we each have a destiny that we need to fulfill?  And even after this obvious message is hit home, I still felt at the end like the movie was without true purpose--I never understood why the Lady was there, exactly, or what she was trying to do, or why there were beings who opposed to what she was doing.Bottom line:  it's a relatively entertaining film.

I decided to watch the movie in its entirity, hoping that there would be some saving element. If I had seen this in the theater, I would have walked out. There are too many flaws to count.This is one of my biggest complaints:If this was supposed to be a child's fantasy, why were the previews making it out to be a horror movie? I understand this may not have been Shymalan's idea, so I will pose another question. Why, if this was a children's movie, did he have scenes where Story (the 2nd main character) was naked, adding an awkward sense of sexuality to the film. No wonder Disney didn't want to be involved with this.The whole movie Giamatti is taking us along on a scavenger hunt of ridiculousness.

1028038,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B000JLTR8Q,"Maine Writer ""David""","[15, 26]","Lady in the Water is a very quirky movie. Something's afoot, and I left the theater more puzzled than opinionated. I felt as if I'd walked out of someone else's surreal dream. (My children, 14 and 16, strongly disliked the movie. One of them poked me in the arm and said, ""Lazy writing."" Maybe we've talked about one too many films at my house.)So here's the multi-part deal.First, it's as if M. Night Shyamalan reviewed every book on screenwriting (actually, story writing generally), came up with a consolidated list of all the rules, and then consciously and studiously broke most (if not all) of them. Many of them are basic, and some of his approaches are genuinely cringe-worthy. For example, serendipity plays a huge role in this movie. The main character hears an otherworldly young woman mention that she's a ""narf,"" happens to go to a Korean woman (who happens to live right upstairs) and asks her to look up a narf, she coincidentally recalls that her mother told her a bedtime story about narfs, and then we're off to the races. It turns out that her mother knows EVERYTHING about narfs -- and that this bedtime story she recalls becomes increasingly complicated to accomodate the movie's plot. Paul Giamatti's character (played with great earnestness) keeps going back to this Korean lady -- again and again and again -- to get more and more information about ""narfs,"" ""scrunts"" (sheesh, my kids couldn't stop laughing over that word), a ""Great Eatlon"" (just a big eagle), and the ""tartufics"" (evil monkeys made of branches).Second, the movie depends on a fictional mythology that isn't terribly consistent -- with more than its share of contradictions and confusion. That's annoying, especially so, I think, for kids. My normally ""quiet in the theater kids"" kept nudging me with stuff like, ""Hey! I thought they couldn't do that!"" or ""I thought anyone who sees those dies!"" Frankly, after the exquisite and seamless logic of The Sixth Sense (which ranks among my favorite movies), Shyamalan's been on a downhill slide (although Signs was even more inconsistent and illogical than Lady in the Water).Third, the dialogue for some of the characters is either wooden (the Village-like lines of Bryce Dallas Howard are a good example) or mockingly stereotypical (Cindy Cheung, as a young Korean woman). I couldn't help but think of a Calgon commercial whenever the Korean characters spoke or interacted. That's bad.Fourth, Shyamalan's presence in the movie as a significant character (a writer whose work is so profound it will change the world, no less) was disturbing to me as a viewer.  First, his acting leaves much to be desired. Second, it breaks the plane of the story as an ever present reminder of the authorship, and as a personalization of the drama that seems especially out-of-context in a story full of symbols, metaphors, and mystical themes. It makes the movie feel more like Shyamalan giving a speech than telling us a bedtime story (which, apparently, was the genesis of the film). I expect that, for this very reason, few directors and writers ever appear as more than momentary cameos in their films. It puts them ahead of the story and the art, and that's rarely, if ever, a good thing. This, coupled with a thinly-veiled swipe at movie critics (""Cads! How could they know what's in someone's heart??? How arrogant!"" or words not far off from that) suggest an author who is so mad he can't restrain himself, and had to jump into the movie to add punch to the attack.Okay, so why did I give this a three?Well, there's a sentimental side of me to which this movie appealed. The theme of this movie is that there is more to this world than is spoken of in science and secular philosophy (to paraphrase the Bard), and that each of us are part of a grand morality play (of sorts) in which each person's role has meaning. In other words, our lives have meaning of some kind. That theme appeals to a middle-aged guy.In addition, there is something interesting about the ""form"" of this movie. Although it has a splash of Matrix-sequel-style obtuseness and Terry Gilliam-esque oddness, Lady in the Water is a pretty original animal as far as films are concerned. It's odd, ideosyncratic, dream-like (as if a straight feed from the subconscious) and very personal. In fact, it's downright voyeuristic in tone -- as if we're listening in on some dad (who is a colorful, but not great spinner of yarns) telling his beloved children a load of nonsense at bedtime. And, in that nonsense, there is a grain of unspoken truth: that the world is weird, strange, and full of the ""mystery of the ordinary"" as one of the characters puts it in an ""on the nose"" line they warn you about in screenwriting books. In a ""reality"" of thugs, terrorists, and mothers drowning their kids, among other horrors, Shyamalan's odd world of vicious monkeys that keep the peace, delicate young women full of strange and wonderful knowledge, ordinary people with extraordinary skills, and giant eagles is a welcome respite. For all of its failures, and if we take off the armor of cynicism and sarcasm that we all seem to be wearing of late, it's pleasant fare.In the end, Lady in the Water has, for me, the feeling of a solo effort in which the writer/director/star made very little effort to consider or incorporate the thoughts and opinions of others.  There are, obviously, both good and bad points to such an approach, but few people possess a sufficiently wide range of talents, abilities, training, and life experiences to take on three such critical roles in one project and create something well-crafted, immersive, and accessible to the audience. Shyamalan isn't there yet, but I'm glad he's trying -- pushing the studio envelope and our expectations.",3,Odd World.,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,5752,"['Lady', 'Water', 'very', 'quirky', 'movie',

I would have simplified the story, and would have found a way to tell it all at once. A simple change like that would have made it more concise and enjoyable to watch.As an M.

1028052,A2RBG714BIN15V,B000JLTR8Q,Michael F. Burdick,"[4, 8]","This movie is something different from the director known for serious, dark movies such as Signs and Unbreakable.  From the very beginning of this movie, one can tell that symbols and legends will play a large part, as will HUMOR--something that this director is not noted for.  Also, the questions of (1) man's individual purpose in life, and (2) the lack of predictability in our lives, play key roles in the ""plot"" of this movie.  This is NOT an action movie requiring no brains.  Rather, the viewer must listen carefully (often, to the low-volume whispering that characterizes Shyamalan's movies) to follow the ""clues"" that are constantly being presented.  Anyone who has seen M. Night Shyamalan's other movies knows that this director wants you to THINK throughout his movies, not just sit back and watch the screen between conversations or trips to the refrigerator.

1028055,AA0Y6M1TKHNHN,B000JLTR8Q,Michael Walter,"[3, 6]","Lady in the Water fuses claustrophobic environment with the possibility of spiritual release and knowledge. It has a central internal conflict--dark atmosphere vs. spiritual hopefulness-- that jangles and intrigues. Atmosphere unsettles attempted cheerfulness; there's subversive creepiness at work.The film is set in a Rear Window-esque apartment complex. The complex seems omnipotent, total, engulfing. It's a lot like Stepford Village; as viewers, we're in it and we can't get out. The icky, thick summer heat, continual throughout the movie, adds to our sense of constriction. The heat covers everything with layers of sweat and grime; even at night, the heat is a force that the characters must reckon with.A sense of dreaminess and otherworldliness shift through the film's claustrophobic environs. Chalk those alluring, mirage-like qualities up to the editing and to the murky, heavily shadowed lighting. Chalk them up to the disorienting narrative, in which events happen quickly but cover only a few days. The dreaminess and claustrophobia make us feel drunk, elated.The characters are strongly, sometimes irritatingly, stereotypical--but maybe director M. Night Shyamalan is playing with stereotypes. The characters' good-heartedness just needs to be brought out--and thank goodness for the lady from the water, who can do exactly that. She depends on the kindness of strangers. She's a dreary sprite who at any moment could turn into something from The Exorcist, Kill Bill, or The Sound of Music. When is she gonna turn into a tough girl?None of the spiritual progress that the characters make feels right. In fact, it almost feels downright wrong. There's something leaden and very off about how well that nice neighbor lady over there, and that eccentric body builder here, and the others come together. These characters seem to be reaching for Protestant ideas in a heathen, mythology-laden environment. Their earnestness is incongruous with the creepy atmosphere, the inescapable apartment complex, and the elusive dreaminess of narrative.I love the frank fantasy of the film. Shyamalan makes no attempts to defend the existence of these creatures, either human or aquatic. The world here is self-contained, much like the world of Shyamalan's The Village... and that's what makes it so amazingly claustrophobic and creepy; that's what makes it seem so unnervingly playful, both funny and serious.

One night, he discovers a stranger swimming in the apartment's pool.  Her name is Story (Howard), and she is a narf.  It seems that she has come from the Blue World to provide enlightenment to one man before returning home.  Making things difficult is the Scrunt, a grass-covered wolf creature that wants to stop her.  According to an Asian fairy tale, there are others who will help her, and Cleveland attempts to locate them in the apartment complex.  But, when the Scrunt attacks, it may be too late, and Story might not accomplish her task.""Lady in the Water"" was a bit of a disappointment for me.  I found it to be a bit on the silly side, with its narfs, scrunts, and even tartutics.  It tries to have a point, but it is somewhat lost amonst the goofiness of the story.

1028059,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B000JLTR8Q,Mir,"[1, 6]","I put off watching this film after all those demolishing reviews. I figured, ""Oh, well. M. Knight dropped the ball.""But, I was in the mood for a fantasy flick and this one was available ON DEMAND, so I went for it. And I was surprised at how much I managed to NOT be bored and to ENJOY it.Lots of reviewers and other places synopsize the story of building superintendent Cleveland Heep and his efforts to aid a stranded visitor from another, watery world get home safely, so I don't need to do that.I do have some thoughts/opinions:Yes, Lady in the Water has problems: The terms don't seem to fit the mythological origin. Story won't talk about who's who, but she blabs on about the future (that was kind of annoying). The scrunt wasn't as terrifying as he ought to have been. The secondary cast was terribly wasted--I mean, geesh, you cast actors like Jeffrey Wright, Mary Beth Hurt, and Jared Harris, and then you sort of ignore their own individual stories? And then you have that whole blabbering gang (of which Harris is part) and that big Latin family (who are shown in the first scene) or the kid with the half-developed body, and we never, ever find out who they are or what they're like or what they fear or anything about them. They're utterly cardboard. And convenient.On the plus side: Paul Giamatti rules. He absolutely makes you care about his character and he's so watchable, even when he's doing something really stupid, like acting like a kid. (Which fits in with the themes, but still, silly.) And Bryce Howard has an otherworldly look here that is perfect, and her presence fits the character. Bob Balaban is a joy whenever he shows up in any film, the man is THAT good, and he is terrific here with the small bit he's given to do. Pitch perfect. And I like that little introductory story done with primitive artwork in the beginning. It sets the stage for a fairy tale in an urban setting.Now, I understand that this is, in fact, a bedtime story, a fairy tale, an urban fantastical allegory. Naming the narf ""Story"" sort of gives that up fast. But when you're going to set up a complicated team of players that must cooperate to achieve the happy ending, well, I think it's incumbent on the writer to develop the story in such a way that the cast is fully fleshed, not simply, ""Oh, here's the piece I need in this instant, and I'll move it here now, even though I've ignored it for an hour plus. Voila. Surprise."" Bad, bad plotting/writing. A bit more time with all the players would have done the trick. Or, one simply pares down the cast and makes do with the brilliance of a Giamatti, a Balaban, a Wright, a Howard, a Harris and a Hurt, perhaps, and call it a day.Still, I'd recommend that lovers of allegory or fairy tales or urban fantasy give this a go, and especially those who can forgive weaknesses simply because there are luminous moments. This movie has luminous moments, and for those moments, I say try hard to overlook the weaknesses and let yourself be carried away with the wonder of a child. For a spell.Unlike another reviewer who criticized the ""watery bird"", I think that particular shot was lovely. I think what Cleveland Heep says, the very last line, speaks strongly to the power of Story.A story, if you believe it, if you have faith like a child, can save your life.If Shyamalan indulges a bit petulantly and a tad arrogantly, even perhaps somewhat self-aggrandizingly, well, he may come to regret that later.  Or not. And maybe he's just misunderstood. Perhaps.As a viewer, I say thank you for the lovely bits that are in LADY IN THE WATER, and too bad that it wasn't the better film it could have been with more time spent developing the story and characters.

I see action, romantic comedies, dramas, sci-fi, movies of all kinds while waiting for a movie that has a unique story and great message.  And when I've just about given up on finding this ""one of a kind"" story, a movie like Lady in the Water comes out and surprises me.I didn't know what to expect from this movie when I was standing in line to buy my popcorn...the trailers made it out to be scary (and I'm not a scary movie person), yet I had also seen M. Night Shyamalan (the writer/director/co-star) on an interview indicating this was a bedtime story he told his children.  Well, a bedtime story can't be that scary, and Shyamalan's movies are never what they appear to be (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, The Village), so I took the plunge and entered the theatre.In the simplest of terms, this movie is fantastic; a must see.  It is a story about Cleveland Heeps (Paul Giamatti), the superintendent of an apartment building (the man who knows everyone), who finds a Narf (or sea nymph) named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) living in the community pool.  He begins asking around, and discovers that Narfs are characters from long-forgotten bedtime stories in which nymphs come to help mankind.  But, there are wolf-like creatures, called Scrunts, who hunt and kill the Narfs.  One of these scrunts is stalking Story, making it impossible for her to return home after fulfilling the task she was sent to do.  As Cleveland begins to learn about Story, he decides to help her return to her world.  He also discovers, from the bedtime stories, that other people have been placed in the complex, or drawn there for just this time, to also assist Story in her return home.  Now he just has to figure out who in the apartment complex is there to fulfill specific roles in her return.  In a sense, they are all characters in her story.As M. Night Shyamalan appears in all his movies, I was not surprised to see him as one of the characters, but was interested as to the extent of his role. This isn't just a one-line, walk-on character, but one of the main roles in the story, and he plays it quite well.  Night plays Vick Ran, an aspiring writer who shares an apartment with his sister, Anna (Sarita Choudhury).  They also befriend Story and assist Cleveland in finding the others who are to protect and help her return home.So, was this a scary movie, as the trailer indicates?  No, not scary, but it is suspenseful.  Shyamalan has also spattered humor throughout, and it never feels forced or unnatural. Instead, it draws the viewer into the characters.  This quirky group of apartment dwellers are fun to watch.While the story itself is unique, I found the message of the movie to be uplifting.  Shyamalan makes it very clear that this movie is about one's purpose in life and one's worth as a person.  Most characters in the movie have some reason to believe they are not worthy of having a greater purpose in life beyond what they are currently doing, or they don't feel worthy of being used to impact other lives.  Yet, the movie makes it clear: no matter your talents (or lack thereof), past, or intellect, there is a purpose for your life.  It might not look the way you imagine, and it will probably sneak up on you, by your life does have a significant purpose.SPECIAL FEATURES:This disk includes about an hour's worth of sometimes-interesting extras. Unfortunately, the usually-reliable ""Gag Reel"" was a disappointing montage (after all, is it really funny just to watch actors repeatedly laughing at themselves for an extended period of time?) However, the six-part ""Reflections of Lady in the Water"" definitely makes up for the lame gag reel, offering interesting and insightful snippets into the making of this film. (For instance, in order to attain a sense of realism in the movie, Shyamalan actually had workers construct the entire apartment complex featured in the film - steel, concrete, electricity, swimming pool and all. And afterward? They tore it the whole structure down and left an empty lot.) Deleted scenes don't add much to the story, and are easily overlooked.DVDBLOG RECOMMENDS:This is a wonderful movie to start dialogue about life purpose, goals, and worth.  Take your spouse and/or older children to see this movie, and then plan some time for good conversation.AFTER THE SHOW:* Was this movie what you expected it to be?  Explain* In this film, no one was aware of their purpose until they were needed.  Do you think we can know our purpose before God uses us in specific ways? Defend your answer.* Did you relate to any character in the story, and his or her particular weakness?

1028067,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000JLTR8Q,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 0]","Shyamalan's films are somewhat quirky and offbeat and very much draw upon his own idiosyncratic (but neither entirely original or totally out there) sense of what kinds of stories ought to be told. They usually don't conform to the standard Hollywood storytelling model, which means there are gaps and inconsistencies and odd duck characters and miscues that aren't entirely justified or the structure of the films is slanted without a clear &#34;beginning&#34; &#34;middle&#34; and &#34;end&#34; or where a &#34;twist&#34; takes the place of a genuinely motivated character arc -- in general in his case this is not a good thing but every once in a while it gives a fresh and unique edge to his films. &#34;Lady in the Water&#34; was no exception -- and it was clear from the beginning that Shyamalan didn't want to make concessions: he set up a cast of &#34;misfits&#34; and contrived a story that would bring them together under a common cause, and wasn't worried about mixing genres or stretching the limits of plausibility or giving his characters enough evidence for us to believe that they would believe in and embrace this cause at the peril of their lives. This is a story about abandoning oneself to believe in the power of stories, about suspending disbelief and letting the storyteller tell her story however ludicrous its implications become. (What is odd is that he seems to want to say that if we can just abandon ourselves to stories we will be better people and there will be less war, etc. -- but of course it is often the willingness to accept stories about &#34;good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; without fact that gets us so riled up about going to war in the first place). In any case there is something obviously self-serving and a bit naive about the premise of the story -- and the self-reference is as blatant as it can get in this film, since Shyamalan himself acted the part of the writer who was going to write a lot of strange things that would not be accepted at first but eventually would change the world through the power of belief (not to mention the one person who gets &#34;eaten&#34; in this film is a film critic who can't write anything himself but likes to criticize films for lacking neat plots and stories, i.e. one who wouldn't have liked &#34;The Village&#34; or this film). Still, as stories tinged with the fantastic go I enjoyed this one (it's a better film than &#34;Signs,&#34; which did much better at the box office). It worked even better for me on the small screen when I watched it again with a couple of my children on dvd. There I wasn't so bothered by the obviously grandiose delusions of the film (and its filmmaker) -- but just enjoyed, most of all, the undeniably fascinating and powerful performance at the heart of this film by Paul Giamatti, one of the most consistently strong supporting actors in Hollywood, here given center stage. Three stars for the film, and five stars for Giamatti give this film my four star rating.The way I think of M. Night Shyamalan's films is that he is like a small budget independent filmmaker who happens to have big budgets. This is sometimes good and sometimes bad. He tells small stories that appeal to a niche audience -- but luckily for him that niche has coincided with a fairly large number of Americans: mostly sci-fi/fantasy lovers and &#34;believers&#34; who like their fantasy movies to hint at transcendence (the afterlife, etc.) Where this is a drawback is that weaknesses in plot or limitations in scope or unconventional stories that you could forgive (or even celebrate as an alternative) in a small budget independent film are hard to accept in a glossy big budget feature put out by Disney or another major studio. Watching &#34;Signs,&#34; for example, it struck me that I would have liked it much better if it hadn't had such big name actors and hadn't obviously had such a large budget. It feels like a &#34;small film&#34; about a crisis of faith and an identity crisis, but its science fiction premise overwhelmed this rather than working seamlessly with it. (Unlike, say, Spielberg's &#34;Close Encounters&#34; -- a film that was able to manage both intimacy with the characters and a global science fiction premise). Shyamalan obviously has visual talent and the ability to coax exceptional performances from his actors and has been lucky enough to hit upon a few stories that resonated enough at the box office that he has been given free range for quite a few films. Plus, the studios he has worked for have had the good sense to market his films as being different and as expressing his unique vision. I don't know how much longer that is going to work for him, though -- with films like this one and his previous one that have had diminishing returns in the box office he may have to turn to creating the kinds of independent and low budget but high concept films that he would have been making if he hadn't had the good luck to have the right actors and the right kind of buzz that made &#34;Sixth Sense&#34; a smashing success.",3,"Not nearly as bad as some say, with an excellent performance by Paul Giamatti",1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,5049,"['Shyamalan', 'films', 'are', 'somewhat',

Well seriously folks, what is the point of trying to let your imagination run wild when the film itself is abysmal and crafted by an ego-maniac?  Contrary to many, I didn't hate his last film, the Village, like everyone else did, and as far as his previous films go, ranged from decent to excellent.  Which is why I'm scratching my head at Lady in the Water, because while it still features his stylish touch (somewhat), the story is ridiculously inane and non-sensical (I don't care if this is supposed to be a fairy tale or an homage to fairy tales, there are so many plot holes and leaps in logic that it just gets inexcusable), poor Paul Giamatti gets saddled with the hapless lead role and his talent is wasted to boot, and the rest of the cast, including Bryce Dallas Howard as the mythical creature and rising star Jeffrey Wright, range from wasted to annoying in their roles.  Not to mention that Shyamalan himself gives himself the most screen time he's had in any of his films, with the ego-mania just smoking off the screen.  Although the offing of a film critic offers some chuckles, Lady in the Water is an incredibly bad film that even the most die hard of Shyamalan fans will find hard to enjoy.

1028072,A1129LM24YWSZV,B000JLTR8Q,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[1, 3]","Kind-of a modern fairy tale, Lady in the Water is about Story (the title character) and her interactions with all of the film's other characters. Story (played by Bryce Dallas Howard), a ""water-being,"" is found in the pool of an apartment complex by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the complex's repairman. Heep, who has his own secrets/backstory, becomes involved in trying to aid Story in accomplishing her mission (to inspire a human who will go on to do something great) and then returning to her own world.The film is much about connectedness. Heep discovers that many of the apartment complex residents have a special role to play in Story's mission (with M. Night Shamalayan himself playing one of the largest roles I've seen him take on in one of his own films), and all the residents must work together to help the strange water creature that has stumbled into their midst.The film also has alot to say about the purpose of the individual - i.e. how we are all searching for our purpose, how we make mistakes, how we sometimes don't realize who we are until the fit hits the shan, how each person has a special importance.So, in a way, the film is about the critical nature of both knowing who we are as an individual and realizing that we are all interdependent - an indivisible group. The film's characters cannot achieve success unless they all work together.Giamatti, as usual, gives a great performance. There were a couple of strained moments (which is uncharacteristic of him, I think. He usually makes it look sooooo easy.), but overall, he was fabulous. Howard was good, too, and the quiet, restrained quality she has served her very well in this role (as did her very chiseled face - positively haunting).While, like most of Shamalayan's films, this one has strong elements of fantasy, I thought it was worth watching. I would not call this my favorite Shamalayan film (That would probably be either The Sixth Sense or Signs.), but this movie is in keeping with the types of films he produces. To wit, if you like his other films, you'll probably like this one.

Night Shyamalan, especially after The Village, which I thought was a dud. When I went to see this one I was skeptical, but I figured it was worth the gamble of $2.50. Overall I can't say I was impressed, but I must admit that the storyline was intriguing and the characters, if generally shallow, were entertaining. I particularly liked Reggie, the guy who works out only one side of his body ""as a scientific experiment"". Shyamalan himself, who normally puts in only cameo appearances in his films, played a surprisingly large role in this one, but he should stick to writing and producing, not acting.On the plus side, I thought Shyamalan did a good job of developing the character of Cleveland Heep, played by Paul Giamatti, who in turn did excellent work bringing this character to life. I also enjoyed some of the special effects, such as the scrunt lying in the grass with its red eyes aglow. Finally, the little plot twist at the end, such as it was, gave this film that little nudge over the top from being a total snoozer to being worth seeing.Is this supposed to be some great allegory? Maybe Shyamalan meant it that way, and I certainly see how some viewers can interpret it as such.

So all right, all right, I let him in.""So he tells me he's got this broad downstairs, and I'm thinkin', hey, all right, gettin' a little, huh?  I mean I seen this broad, she's kinda young and she doesn't like to wear clothes a lot of the time and hey hey hey, you know what I mean?  But then he tells me--and you ain't gonna believe this--that she's a sea nymph, like from the sea, only now she's livin' at the bottom of the pool.  In the complex.  This broad--this sea nymph--is living at the bottom of a swimming pool!  In Philadelphia, fer Chrissake!  Philadelphia, pee ayy!""Yeah, yeah, I know, it's completely cracked, but you ain't heard nothin' yet.  Oh, and she ain't called a sea nymph, she's called a narf.  Yeah, like barf.  So, get this, the broad's here to save humanity or somethin'--yeah, right--and in order to save humanity she's gotta go back to the sea.  All right, so get outta here already!  But she can't.  You know why?  'Cause there's some kind of an animal that looks like grass and that's trying to kill her.  Only it ain't grass, it's like a big dog.  Er, a giant dog, with red eyes.  This thing is called a Scrack or a Grunt or a oh yeah, a Scrunt.  A scrunt, yeah, that's it!  And this thing, this dog-scrunt thing, is trying to kill her.""So what the heck do I care?  I ask the guy.  Well, it turns out that the guardian, which is what I am, see, is supposed to guard this scrunt thing while the broad escapes.  And get this, she's gonna escape by standin' around by the pool at night and getting picked up by--you ain't gonna believe this--a giant eagle.  Yeah!  An eagle!  Naw, I don't know if the eagle's got a name.  But this eagle thing, which is, you know, a bird, is going to pick up this sea nymph thing and take it back to Atlantic City and drop it in the ocean.  No, I don't know how he picks her up.  With his claws, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, that'd hurt!  But the eagle thing is going to drop this Narf thing back into the ocean, see--which by doing so is going to save humanity--and while all this is going on I'm supposed to be standing there staring like some moron at this goddamned scrunt!  'Cause I'm the guardian, see?  Oh yeah, and I'm just one of 'em.  I'm just one of the characters in this Shakespeare production.  There's also supposed to be like a teacher and a healer and for all I know a strip-tease dancer and a mariachi band, and they're all supposed to take part in this idiocy!""Jay-sus, ya ever hearda anything so crazy?

The script wavers and folds back on itself.  There isn't a likable or interesting character in the whole thing.  The acting is amateurish.  And the special effects are neither special nor effective. (Just what in hell ARE those creatures dropping out of the air at the conclusion?  They look like the flying monkeys from WIZARD OF OZ on crystal meth or something.)

Translucent Bryce Dallas Howard, brings to us a mythical lady whose unusual appearance in the apartment complex wakes up its tenants from their mundane if not unhappy lives.  Her presence gives them all new purpose - which while not clear to any one of them at first - still keeps them together in their efforts to help an enigmatic stranger.  They all find talents and purpose they could not see in themselves before and they act as ""band of brother"" -just trying to do the right thing.  Paul Giamatti brings wonderful performance that is both delightful and hillarious at times.  Writer/director Shyamalan is expressing himself as an artist of wide range, not just a capable director.

Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water is a place where myth and reality intertwine in a spellbinding story of a sea nymph who holds the future of the world in her eyes. With one look, she will become a muse to a struggling writer played by M. Night Shyamalan himself, who is an amazing actor and I hope he will appear in more of his movies. He has a magical radiating presence that infuses the movie with light.This is a story of humor and heart and the unlikely hero brings a subtle beauty and kindness to this terror-laced fairytale. The soundtrack keeps you riveted and the wild darkness of the rabid scrunt/hyena is only equaled by the fright you experience as the sprinklers keep going off at odd times.The misty surroundings, wet grass and evening rain gives the story atmosphere and keeps you wondering about the creatures lurking in the darkness. If you are expecting dark horror with gratuitous gore, you will be disappointed. This is a much more finely crafted movie with elements so beautiful they are difficult to describe. The human drama intertwines with the sea nymph's purposeful intent and as the community works together to solve an overwhelming task, she becomes weaker as the humans must show their best qualities and emotional strength.If you love movies like Big Fish, the pool in this movie is also center stage. This is where the sea nymph lives in a room below the pool with cracking walls. While Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti - who is a natural at physical comedy) fixes garbage disposals and changes light bulbs for tenants, he tries to figure out the fairytale that is about to come true.For the most part, I found myself laughing at the start and then completely lost in the magic of the story right until the last second.

1028099,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000JLTR8Q,Roland E. Zwick,"[12, 23]","**1/2Anyone who has ever taken a course in basic fiction writing knows that the first thing you learn is the old ""show don't tell"" rule of storytelling.  It's ironic, then, that this is the very thing that M Night Shyamalan - hitherto one of the most innovative and imaginative of modern day storytellers - seems to have forgotten in his latest film, ""Lady in the Water,"" the first truly disappointing movie the young writer/director has made to date (and, no, I'm not forgetting ""The Village,"" which I liked much more than most people did).  Unlike, say, the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy or the ""Star Wars"" films, in which the filmmakers allow us to see and enter into the fantastical and mythological worlds they've created, in ""Lady in the Water"" the characters spend most of their time DESCRIBING rather than showing us the imaginary world of their story, resulting in a static, talky film that fails to engage the viewer in any truly meaningful way.The wonderful Paul Giamatti stars as Cleveland, the sweet-natured, milquetoast-y manager of a multi-storied apartment building on the outskirts of Philadelphia.  One night Cleveland discovers a strange woman swimming in the pool after dark, an intruder he soon discovers to be a sea nymph (called a ""narf"") who has come from the mysterious ""blue world"" to bring a message of hope to mankind.  Unfortunately, this creature, who calls herself Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, who played a similar emissary-to-a-strange-world role in ""The Village""), has also inadvertently brought with her a menacing wolf-like monster which threatens to destroy her before she can make it successfully back to her own world.  With the help of a number of other, amazingly credulous residents of the complex, Cleveland is able to piece together elements of the mystery in the hope of helping Story to do what she came to do and then return safely home.As with his earlier films, Shyamalan is far more interested in mood and imagery than in easy melodrama and cheap thrills.  However, in this case, the film gets so bogged down in explanations and exposition that it winds up talking itself and us to a standstill.  The screenplay cheats right off the bat by relying on an outsider's knowledge of the tale to relate the key elements rather than letting those elements reveal themselves naturally and organically.  As a consequence, the film is never able to convince us of its authenticity, while the plot points begin to feel increasingly arbitrary and silly the longer the movie drones on.Unfortunately, the film's visual style is every bit as incoherent as the storyline.  For some reason, as a director, Shyamalan proves unable to establish or maintain spatial unity in his misc-en-scene.  He never gives us a clear view of the entire courtyard, so that we are unable to tell where the woods are in relation to the building or even if the woods are real at all (that would certainly be an intriguing concept, though I honestly don't think that was Shyamalan's intention).  For long stretches of the film, we expend our energies trying to orient ourselves in the film's geography, something even the least competent director should be able to do for his audience.  At times we seem to be trapped in some type of concrete fortress, while, at other times and from other angles, the setting seems positively bucolic, overrun with thick vegetation and with Cleveland living in what appears to be a quaint little cottage nestled cozily in some nearby woods (but which is somehow supposed to be only a stone`s-throw from the apartment`s pool).  The film looks as if it were shot at two entirely different locales, and that Shyamalan was unable to meld them into anything even remotely approximating a seamless whole.And that seems to be the biggest problem with ""Lady in the Water.""  It always feels incompletely formed and half-baked, a thing of bits and pieces rather than a wholly rounded and fully developed work of art.  Shyamalan has struck out in his own ballpark.",2,regrettable failure,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,3995,"['**1/2Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'taken', 'course', 'basic', 'fiction', 'writing', 'knows', 'first', 'thing', 'learn', 'old', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'rule', 'storytelling', 'ironic', 'then', 'very', 'thing', 'M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'hitherto', 'one', 'most', 'innovative', 'imaginative', 'modern', 'day', 'storytellers', 'have', 'forgotten', 'latest', 'film', 'Lady', 'Water', 'first', 'truly', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'young', 'writer/director', 'made', 'date', ""'m"", 'not', 'forgetting', 'Village', 'liked', 'much', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'did', 'say', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films', 'filmmakers', 'allow', 'see', 'enter', 'fantastical', 'mythological', 'worlds', ""'ve"", 'created', 'Lady', 'Water', 'characters', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'rather', 'showing', 'imaginary', 'world', 'story', 'resulting', 'static', 'talky', 'film', 'engage', 'viewer', 'truly', 'meaningful', 'way.The', 'wonderful', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Cleveland', 'sweet-natured', 'milquetoast-y', 'manager', 'multi-storied', 'apartment', 'building', 'outskirts', 'Philadelphia', 'One', 'night', 'Cleveland', 'strange', 'woman', 'swimming', 'pool', 'dark', 'intruder', 'soon', 'be', 'sea', 'nymph', 'called', 'narf', 'who', 'come', 'mysterious', 'blue', 'world', 'bring', 'message', 'hope', 'mankind', 'Unfortunately', 'creature', 'who', 'Story', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'who', 'played', 'similar', 'emissary-to-a-strange-world', 'role', 'Village', 'also', 'inadvertently', 'brought', 'menacing', 'wolf-like', 'monster', 'destroy', 'can', 'make', 'successfully', 'back', 'own', 'world', 'help', 'number', 'other', 'amazingly', 'credulous', 'residents', 'complex', 'Cleveland', 'able', 'piece', 'together', 'elements', 'mystery', 'hope', 'helping', 'Story', 'do', 'what', 'came', 'do', 'then', 'return', 'safely', 'home.As', 'earlier', 'films', 'Shyamalan', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'mood', 'imagery', 'easy', 'melodrama', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'However', 'case', 'film', 'so', 'bogged', 'down', 'explanations', 'exposition', 'up', 'talking', 'standstill', 'screenplay', 'cheats', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'relying', 'outsider', 'knowledge', 'tale', 'relate', 'key', 'elements', 'rather', 'letting', 'elements', 'reveal', 'naturally', 'organically', 'consequence', 'film', 'never', 'able', 'convince', 'authenticity', 'plot', 'points', 'begin', 'feel', 'increasingly', 'arbitrary', 'silly', 'longer', 'movie', 'on.Unfortunately', 'film', 'visual', 'style', 'bit', 'as', 'incoherent', 'storyline', 'reason', 'director', 'Shyamalan', 'unable', 'establish', 'maintain', 'spatial', 'unity', 'misc-en-scene', 'never', 'clear', 'view', 'entire', 'courtyard', 'are', 'unable', 'tell', 'where', 'woods', 'are', 'relation', 'building', 'even', 'woods', 'are', 'real', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'Shyamalan', 'intention', 'long', 'stretches', 'film', 'expend', 'energies', 'trying', 'orient', 'film', 'geography', 'something', 'even', 'least', 'competent', 'director', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'audience', 'times', 'seem', 'be', 'trapped', 'type', 'concrete', 'fortress', 'other', 'times', 'other', 'angles', 'setting', 'positively', 'bucolic', 'overrun', 'thick', 'vegetation', 'Cleveland', 'living', 'what', 'be', 'quaint', 'little', 'cottage', 'nestled', 'cozily', 'nearby', 'woods', 'somehow', 'supposed', 'be', 'only', 'stone', 's-throw', 'apartment', 's', 'pool', 'film', 'were', 'shot', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'locales', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'unable', 'meld', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'approximating', 'seamless', 'whole.And', 'be', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Lady', 'Water', 'always', 'feels', 'incompletely', 'formed', 'half-baked', 'thing', 'bits', 'pieces', 'rather', 'wholly', 'rounded', 'fully', 'developed', 'work', 'art', 'Shyamalan', 'struck', 'out', 'own', 'ballpark']",N/A

I'm not sure how Shyamalan could have come up with such a soggy mess.In his DVD commentary, he tells us that the plot was taken from a fairytale that his children enjoyed hearing him tell over and over. Either something got lost in the translation to a screenplay, or else Shyamalan's children have very strange taste in fairytales. Because really, there is no tale here at all - except maybe a fish tail. It's a hodgepodge of mismatched elements.The Queen of the Sea pops up out of a swimming pool - languishes in a faint in Paul Giamatti's apartment - while some great clawed beasts lurk on land acting as (what is it?) sentries or predators - and some great clawed birds in the air wait to carry the Queen back to the Sea. All these clumps of plotline snarl together like matted seaweed. There's only one elderly Asian woman in the apartment complex who knows the whole truth of this Oriental myth, and she metes out incoherent pieces of it to Giamatti when she feels in the mood.Even the setting of this movie is vexing. The courtyard apartment building where Giamatti works as manager/maintenance man is an uneasy combination of the stage set for ""Rear Window"" and an open-back doll's house.The only thing that was done right here was to cast Bryce Howard as the sea maiden.

I also enjoyed, to a lesser extent, ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs.""  ""The Village,"" however, was a bit of a disappointment.  While the cinematography and music were great, the atmosphere felt fake and the token surprise ending didn't deliver.  But even then, ""Lady in the Water"" makes that film look like ""Citizn Kane.""**Spoilers** I think what maddens me the most about this film is how the story unfolds as if it was being written while filming; as if Shyamalan was making it up as he went along.  Things like the little boy suddenly being able to see encrypted messages on cereal boxes, the man in the bathroom who supposedly has some part in the myth but whose part is never really explained or shown in action, the way Cleveland's emotional breakdown over his briefly mentioned murdered family somehow heals the nymph -- it's all so ridiculous.Furthermore, the myth itself coming from Korean ancestry is also ludicrous.  It would be more believable coming from, say, Norse mythology.

Also, one of the deleted scenes is so useful for explaining one sequence in the film ( Paul Giamatti's exploration of the Cave beneath the pool) that I find the deletion totally inexplicable.The Gag reel and the Reflections in the Water extras are very good watch, and explainmany parts of the film if you need them explained.",5,First Class Splash,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,1130,"['stayed', 'away', 'film', 'while', 'mainly', 'basis', 'comments', 'critics', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'normally', 'trust', 'incorrect', 'summaries', 'bad', 'promo', 'clips', 'front', 'must', 'say', 'love', 'surreal', 'element', 'entire', 'film', 'made', 'things', 'superb.The', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'was', 'course', 'first', 'classcast', 'actors', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'fulfilled', 'supernatural', 'drive', 'film', 'VILLAGE', 'promised', 'never', 'delivered', 'film', 'being', 'superbly', 'crafted', '.The', 'film', 'Journey', 'supernatural', 'being', 'how', 'being', 'human', 'fulfill', 'greatness.The', 'humans', 'group', 'flats', 'discover', 'higher', 'roles', 'so', 'work', 'beat', 'forces', 'darkness.THE', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'One', 'missing', 'element', 'commentary', 'Also', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'so', 'useful', 'explaining', 'one', 'sequence', 'film', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'exploration', 'Cave', 'beneath', 'pool', 'find', 'deletion', 'totally', 'inexplicable.The', 'Gag', 'reel', 'Reflections', 'Water', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'watch', 'explainmany', 'parts', 'film', 'need', 'explained']",N/A

No question, Paul Giamatti as Cleveland delivered an excellent performance and his character was the cause of most of the laughter. The story itself is about a bedtime story that becomes reality for a particular group of people. The message of the film is very good, namely that every individual has a purpose in life and in the universe, and that each person is of value -- a message that is not subtle, but communicated rather obviously.The problem that I have with the film is that there's no real surprise factor that takes your breath away like e.g. in the Sixth Sense or in The Village. Still, M. Night is a top-notch director who communicates and translates his vision very well unto the screen, and in this flick he also shows a bit more of his acting skills which have improved a lot and are actually very good. Cindy Cheung is also doing a fine job - I have to mention her. Let's put it this way: it is a completely different film from what's out there and also the expectations for this film might be different of what this film really is. Did this film deliver? I would have lived my life just fine without ever seeing this film. Will I buy the DVD?

The Village was adequate, but hardly worthy of the public flogging it got.  Nonetheless, when his second critical flop hit theaters, I didn't rush out to see it.  Then yesterday, it was on cable, and I thought... what the heck, it's free.I really enjoyed this film.  Was it great?  No.  Was it the kind of movie I'd watch over and over?  No.  But Giamatti did a very good job, and all the characters were pretty enjoyable.Here's my 2 cents:  in a time when so much of Hollywood is focused on remakes or sequels, when the thriller has become a cliche, predictable because most of the entertainment industry is OUT of new ideas, I'm willing to bend a little when something different comes along.Were there big battle scenes in this film?  Or car chases?  No.  But not every story is that kind of story.So what should a viewer expect from this film, without giving everything away?  Did I expect some kind of misdirection in a film by M. Night Shyamalan?  You bet I did.  Do I expect the lead to  be a decent person with his own flaws?  Yes.  Do I expect to come out of it feeling like good people can make a difference?  Yes.Why should Hollywood not put a decent human being as a lead?  Not a bulletproof superhero (although I enjoy those, as well) but a man who is not seeking glory, just trying to be good to people and do his job.  One who looks out for others.Bruce Willis (twice) and Mel Gibson did credible jobs of being good-hearted men who find redemption.  Why not the less dashing Paul Giamatti?I recommend this movie in an age in which everything from restaurants to movies beings to blur together and become homogenized and indistinct.

1028112,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B000JLTR8Q,Sky,"[7, 10]","What a winning streak (perhaps if you exclude The Village [2004]) M. Night Shyamalan has been on since The Sixth Sense (1999). And the streak solidly continues with Lady In The Water.According to an interview that I heard Shyamalan do on The Howard Stern Show last summer, Lady In The Water was actually planned as a Disney Touchstone studio release and also shunned by other big Hollywood studios. It was a film that Shyamalan had wanted to make, but kept getting brickwalled by the studios. Finally, Warner Brother embraced the idea.Perhaps Touchstone thought that Shyamalan was on a downward spiral after the disappointing box office result of The Village two years ago. And The Village was indeed a mediocre-at-best movie. Ultimately, Touchstone doesn't look bad for passing on Lady In The Water based on the film's budget to its box office take. The bad press, bad blood, mediocre previous release all hanging over The Lady In The Water really hurt the box office success of the film.So the question is: what constitutes success?...A very good movie or a very good box office take? Well, one thing's for sure: Lady In The Water is definitely the former.The movie is well acted. Paul Giamatti is stellar; no one can say that this guy is just a character actor...he's without doubt as A-list as it gets. And his performance in Lady just reinforces my opinion.The movie is scary. I hate movies that rely on a lot of ""jumps out of the dark accompanied by a loud bong"" to scare the viewer, and Lady indeed does that a few times. But redemption is served in a thrilling, suspenseful, creepy overtone to the whole movie. And the movie is full of deliberate comic relief that works perfectly.Shyamalan says that this was a bedtime story (and is portrayed as such in the movie, albeit a come-to-life bedtime story) that he used to tell or was told as a young child (can't remember which). No wonder all his movies are so creepy.I'm sorry that I rented this instead of adding to my library. I was clearly caught up in the ""Shyamalan downward spiral"" unjustified hype.

1028113,AJ6XR403WY88M,B000JLTR8Q,"Sniff Code ""www.sniffcode.com""","[0, 0]","Lady in the Water is easily an old school Steven Spielberg-esque film. Shyamalan has given us Cleveland Heap, who in true ET style,  is going to help a young woman make her way back home. There are, of course, enemies that stand in there way, but that is nothing compared to the lack of self-confidence in their ability to carry out this mission. Thankfully, they have an eclectic cast of supporting characters that will each in their own colorful way help these two do what they are meant to do.As a child of the 80s who grew up on these types of movies, I enjoyed Lady in the Water more than most. Mostly because I recognized what it was. I understood it. This is a story where leading male characters can be emotionally vulnerable. It's a story where being ""rescued"" is not only not a bad thing, but maybe even the mutual purpose of two or more people who encounter each other, presumably, by chance.Had I been a child of the cynical years that came after the 80s, I probably would have written Lady off as wide-eyed, corny fluff. Many of my friends did. The critics had their own reasons for panning this one: most likely because  Night's critic character, whose purpose seems to dampen the more creative moments, managed to get under their skin. But that's kind of the point. The Lady in this film has the not so subtle name of ""Story"" -- and she's surrounded by a host of colorful characters that usually help along a good story. Also in her peripheral is the inevitable critic, who lingers in the back of the mind of every story (and story teller).  Lady in the Water is ultimately Shyamalan's metaphor for the storytelling process.Or maybe just HIS storytelling process. Consequently, he uses this movie to expose himself. And this might be where some of the objections against the movie become valid -- if you miss the metaphor...This story is supposed to feel like the first draft, where rediculous ideas have not yet been removed. So, yes, the rediculous happens in the movie. Like a kid who reads synchronistic messages on the back of cereal boxes (which I used to do when I was that age), and a guy who has a hulk-hogan half body. Apparently, Disney, who was the intended distributor for this film nearly pitched a turd when they read the script. They didn't ""get it.""Not all of these absurdities work, either. In a few areas you almost get the feeling that Shyamalan is embarrassed by what he's trying to pull off. Like casting himself as a writer who is going to write a ""Cookbook"" that will give the long awaited recipe for changing the world.  M. Night follows through with this delicious delusion of grandeur, but chickens out that last minute by using a half-hearted joke to laugh it all away.But if that was the worst of his crimes in Lady, then it's a misdemeanor at best. Every writer secretly suffers such delusions of grandeur. Night just admits it, albeit, he retracts immediately after.Despite the intentional disjointed narrative, it is still possible to simply enjoy Lady in the Water as an inspiring and uplifting story.

The story revolves around a sad disillusioned man, Cleveland Heep, who has given up everything after the loss of his family.  Heep discovers a mystical creature, a narf, in the pool of the apartment complex he manages.  Malevolent forces lurk in the gardens around the pool which she must be protected against.  Ultimately this magical creature must be restored from whence she came.  This quest to save the narf ends up involving many of the oddball yet normal apartment dwellers Heep has come to know over time.  In the process of saving this creature, he find his own redemption and possibly hope for the future of our world.This move has an enchanting storyline with intricate plot twists.  The main stars, Paul Giamatti and Bryce Howard, are perfectly cast. Shyamalan plays a small, yet compelling role in the film. The look of the film is unadorned-these are ordinary people pursuing ordinary lives.  There is humor and pathos in the lives of these people.  Yet, when galvanized by the hope of something out of the ordinary and an opportunity to do good, these ""normal"" people gather around and give their all.  In essence this film shows the magic of the everday.This is a  fairy tale on film-with all the strangeness and skewed logic of the fairy tale world.

1028119,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000JLTR8Q,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 2]","Although it's another genre-bender, writer/director M. Night Shymalan's ""Lady In The Water"" represents a significant departure from his other movies.  While films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village"" were dramatic horror-thrillers, ""Lady"" pulls back the reigns on the frightening and 'traditional drama' elements, and adds in fantasy and a soft humor to its thriller core as the other main ingredients.  Of course, like the director's other movies, it also adds in dashes and undercurrents of other styles, but in essence it's the shift from darker territory into something more fairy tale-like that gives this one its unique identity.The manager of an apartment building (Paul Giametti) finds, in the swimming pool of the building, a water nymph in human form (Bryce Dalls Howard).  Coming from an alternate world called 'The Blue', the nymph (named Story) has been sent to our world at this crucial time in human history to deliver a message to someone who's destined to play a pivotal role in the near future.  Story doesn't know who this man or woman is, but is supposed to be able to sense it when she encounters them.  And the quest to find this person is the basis of the movie.  Complicatinng the mission is that the nymph hasn't come into our world alone, but has been followed by malevolent predatory creatures (I think they were called Narfs, but I'm not certain) that can perfectly blend into grass and other greenery and emerge either stealthily or explosively.  These beasts were comvincing and highly original, and could have been used to greater horror effect, but ""Lady In The Water"" went subtle on the darker elements so as to open the movie up for little kids to see too.  Not a bad decision at all, although it would still be cool to see the Narfs turn up in another, more horror-oriented movie - not a sequel necesarily, just something that shares the same mythology.  The building that most of the movie centers around is populated by an interesting ensemble of characters, most of whom have some eccentricity or other to them.  These players are drawn in, first as Giametti and Howard 'scout' different people to see if they're the one, and later as a number of them are recruited into the quest.When this came out last year, an awful lot of the pre-release talk focused on the lack of big marquee-name stars, and on the fact that Shymalan himself was cast in a significant role.  Interestingly, relatively few people seemed to want to discuss whether the performers who were cast did good jobs (which they all did, Shymalan included), just whether the abscence of household-name performers would hurt the movie's box office (uh, that one was an affirmative too, unfortunately)  Kind of indicative of how the peripherals surrounding a movie (who got payed what; what the studio's marketing strategy is going to be, etc.) seem to be getting bigger than the movies themselves at least in the eyes of a lot of the media outlets.  But I digress.""Lady In The Water"" is a great, original fable, drawing elements from enough different styles of moviemaking and storytelling that it should be pleasing to a wide range of tastes.

We didn't hate it, but we were certainly disappointed considering our high expectation of M. Night Shyamalan.  I thought ""The Sixth Sense"" was riviting entertainment that both scared and moved me.  ""Unbreakable"" was interesting, but not a great follow-up to his previous success.  ""Signs"" was no less than brilliant and had everything going for it like the acting, script, music, and so forth.  I think it's Shyamalan's best work.  ""The Village"" was better than ""Unbreakable"", but that is not necessarily a compliment.  I had hoped that ""Lady in the Water"" would be better than the critics treated it and although it is, it is still a disappointment.Then why the three stars, Steve?  Well, it is clever in some areas.  The casting is terrific.  Bryce Howard, The Village, is a young star on the rise who holds your attention and was a great choice for the leading role, and Paul Giamatti is turning out to be an acting find after numerous low-key, but terrric roles in such films as Cinderella Man, The Illusionist, and Sideways.  I love this guy's unobtrusive acting style.  You just believe anything about him in a role that he asks of you.  I have to admit that I also got a kick out of how Shyamalan gets back at his critics with the character Bob Babalon plays in the film, a deadbeat critic who is on the skids, but gives what appears to be insightful info to Giamatti's character.Lastly, the spotlight review by Kasia really made me think twice about the film.  It is rare when one reviewer, whom you might disagree with, can make you re-examine your position on something.

The author's constant fawning (as well as injecting endless and unrelated references to Bob Dylan) and Shyamalan's monstrously childish ego make for an entertaining read.The movie itself is a weird misfire that defies logic: why would you make a children's bedtime story without any children in it?Worse, how could you expect any children to sit through the harsh, real-world despair and isolated misfit adults that populate this movie?A good cast and interesting special effects has so little to work with.

1028128,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B000JLTR8Q,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[11, 18]","It's no revelation that director M. Night Shyamalan knows how to make suspenseful, often creepy movies.  Bursting on the scene in 1999 with the commercial and critical hit, ""The Sixth Sense,"" he parlayed that success into follow-up films ""Unbreakable,"" ""Signs,"" and ""The Village.""  None, however, lived up to ""The Sixth Sense.""  Shyamalan's trademark is the Big Secret -- some well-kept plot point that is supposed to blow the audience away.  Though these later films have their share of eeriness, palpable atmosphere, and first-rate performances, they never set the screen on fire.Now Shyamalan is back with ""Lady in the Water,"" based on a tale he made up for his daughters as a bedtime story.  There are strange doings in and around the pool of an apartment complex called The Cove.  Late one night, apartment superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) sees a young woman emerge from the pool.  She reveals that she is a water nymph named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) and has come from the Blue World beneath the swimming pool.  Story's unique powers of perception predict the fates of Cleveland's tenants, whose destinies are tied directly to her own. They must work together to decipher a series of codes that will unlock a pathway to her freedom.Getting Story home is not easy.  The feat involves following the blow-by-blow plot points of an ancient myth, provided by an elderly Korean woman as interpreted by her daughter (Cindy Cheung).The tenants are an odd collection of colorful, quirky characters.  Shyamalan himself plays author Vick Ran in a role much bigger than the director's cameo appearances in his earlier films.  He's not a bad actor and does a credible job, but his  considerable screen time eventually becomes distracting.  Alfred Hitchcock, whose trademark was popping up in his movies, had the sense to make a brief appearance early on and then disappear, allowing his actors to unfold the story.But the primary problem with ""Lady in the Water"" is Shyamalan's screenplay, which never stops providing new nomenclature and new information even three-quarters of the way through.  There are narfs, scrunts, tartutic, and the great eatlon to keep track of as well as volumes of mythological lore.  Keeping track of all this mythology-in-the-making, revealed piecemeal, becomes tedious early on.  Seeing how intent and stone-cold serious everyone at The Cove is about getting Story back home, one wonders why there are no skeptics among the tenants.""Lady in the Water"" is derivative of so many other, better films, it would take forever to list them all.  Let's just say that ""E.T.,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Batteries Not Included,"" ""Splash"" and even ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" come to mind immediately.  Shyamalan tries to be original, but becomes bogged down in these iconic references, his own complex mythology, and a desperation to have the audience ""get it"".""Lady in the Water"" is ultimately a very silly movie.  For a director who prides himself on the Big Secret, Shyamalan has turned out a surprise-free clunker this time around.  For a fantasy, there is no sense of wonderment, no childlike awe, no magic.  It's an ambitious but badly flawed movie.There's a sad waste of talent.  Giamatti is excellent as usual, but even he comes to look dopey as he gets involved in a convoluted scheme to get Story back to where she belongs.  Howard has little to do but look ethereal and shiver a bit, and she does both well, but she never conveys the magical nature of her character.  She's merely an actress wearing little and brooding much.Supporting performances are provided by Bill Irwin as a gloomy guy who spouts philosophical aphorisms at crucial intervals, Freddy Rodriguez as a bodybuilder exercising only one side of his body, Jeffrey Wright as a crossword puzzle expert, and Bob Balaban as an unfeeling film and book critic.I am totally perplexed as to the intended demographic for this film.  Little kids will find it scary (the scrunts are loathsome CGI-rendered creatures that lurk in the shadows and occasionally pounce), older kids will be bored, teenagers will find it not worth the effort to follow a constantly evolving, tortuous plot, and adults will simply dismiss it as what it is -- a bad movie.

1028130,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000JLTR8Q,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 14]","It is sad to watch a filmmaker who has peaked so early. M. Night Shyamalan is such an example. ""The Sixth Sense"", his first film, is a hard act to follow. Great performances, an engaging story, great technical work and an incredible `aha' moment combine to create an incredible experience. Shyamalan followed with ""Unbreakable"", an exploration of the myth of superheroes. While not as great as ""Sixth"", it is an overlooked film. I consider it to be one of my favorite films, but I am in the minority. ""Signs"" was good, but a lot of people were turned off by the sight of the aliens. ""The Village"" was a mess, a huge disappointment. Now, we have ""Lady in the Water"". It falls somewhere between ""The Village"" and ""Signs""; not as bad as ""The Village"" or as good as ""Signs"".Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the superintendent of a large apartment complex called The Cove, suspects a tenant might be swimming in the pool at night. Startled out of his sleep, he spots the figure but ends up falling into the pool. Waking up a bit later, he finds he has been rescued by Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, ""The Village"") who he later learns is a Sea Nymph sent to our world on a special mission. He also learns creatures from her world, Scrats, dog/ wolf like creatures that can dissolve into and hide in the grass, have followed her back to prevent the mission. Soon, Cleveland realizes he will need some help, so he recruits a number of the apartment building tenants.Shyamalan begins the film with a brief introduction of the legend, using primitive cave drawings to illustrate the narrator's words. Then, we meet Cleveland as he shows a new tenant, Mr. Farber (Bob Balaban) around the building. As they make their way to the new tenant's apartment, they meet a number of the `colorful' tenants living at The Cove. They meet Mr. Dury (Jeffrey Wright, ""Syriana"") and his son (Noah Gary-Cabey). Dury `likes words' and spends his time working crossword puzzles. Reggie (Freddy Rodriguez, ""Poseidon"") is doing an experiment and working out only one half of his body, the right side. Vick Ran (Shyamalan), a writer experiencing writer's block, is working on a new book about politics and current affairs, that ""no one will like to read"", while he lives with his sister, Anna (Sarita Choudhury). Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin), the oldest tenant in the building, sits silently in front of his television all day, watching coverage of wars and carnage. And Young Soon (Cindy Cheung) walks around scantily clad while trying to do her college homework. Young Soon's mother reluctantly provides her daughter with a version of the fable, which Young Soon passes on to the building superintendent. Each of these people will play a part in helping Cleveland return Story safely to her world. But will they play a part in her mission?There are some significant problems with ""Lady"", detracting from the overall experience and making this one of Shyamalan's less successful films. But it's still better than ""The Village"".Let's start with the good. Paul Giamatti is, as always, very good. Cleveland is a meek, unassuming man who exerts authority only when necessary. Giamatti's slumped shoulders and stooped posture help him make this character real. Yet, when he sees a bunch of pot heads smoking in their apartment, he quickly becomes an authority figure and orders them to stop smoking. As soon as he leaves, his stutter returns and he becomes a man most would never give a second glance. He goes about his job in a measured way, completing it with pride because it is all he has, but also trying hard to hide the loathing.As soon as Story enters his life, he is incredulous about her existence, but quickly comes to believe her. The Scrats make a quick appearance, providing him with all the evidence he needs. Then, he finds he has something new to care about, to live for. He devotes his life to helping her, to understanding the rules of her world, and to helping her return home.At one point, late in the film, Farber (Bob Balaban), a movie and media critic, finds himself cornered by a Scrat and begins describing how most movies would handle such a situation. This is an amusing method for the filmmaker to take a playful dig at the industry he works in.Also, Shyamalan is good at placing his camera in places to help build a little suspense. As the Scrats track various people, he frequently places the camera at their eye level, giving us their vantage point, as we stalk the victims sharing the experience with these strange creatures. Shyamalan also reveals many things just after they have happened. For instance, we might see a swinging door at the end of an empty hallway. What went through that door? Often our imagination is more effective than an image.But there are also problems with the three most prevalent elements of the film.Story is a difficult character to make fully believable; a good portion of the film depicts her sleeping or curled in a fetal position in someone else's arms. Bryce Dallas Howard spends a lot of time staring blankly ahead and speaking in very general terms. It would be difficult for most actresses to make this character interesting and Howard simply doesn't have enough experience to pull it off.It is interesting to see such a diverse group of actors in the same film, but few go beyond their initial introduction. Because there are so many, it is difficult to make each of them seem real, to give them more than one human quality. Because of this, many seem like stereotypes. There is an elderly woman who is always telling people about her husband's bowel movements, you might say she is `kvetching' about them. There is another middle aged woman who cares for stray cats, nursing them to health while she talks about healing properties. She comes off as an aging hippie.Finally, because so much emphasis is placed on the legend of the Sea Nymph and Story's journey, it becomes problematic when it doesn't have a strong tie to the rest of the story. From almost the moment she arrives, Cleveland is searching for ways to get her safely back home. She never even seems to have an opportunity to fulfill her journey. I realize that some of the effects of her presence are meant to be subtle, but for this to `payoff', we need to see the effects of this. The effects are very subtle as well. Cleveland doesn't stutter around her. Vick finishes his book. But what is the big cosmic thing she was sent to fix? Her presence is supposed to elicit change on an epic scale. Instead, she makes vague references to some of the characters which will presumably lead to this change. But we feel cheated because we are taking this journey with these characters and we don't see the final impact.There are a couple of vague references to `current events' and `the war', our current way of life. As soon as these pop up, you might expect them to play a significant part in Story's journey; you might expect Shyamalan to make some sort of statement. The connection starts out vague and remains so throughout the film. The idea is never fully integrated leaving another loose end for us to ponder.""Lady in the Water"" is similar to other Shyamalan films in one regard. Shyamalan likes to build suspense. Suspense does not require blood or gore and Shyamalan knows this. His films are generally scary because of the atmosphere he evokes in our minds. They aren't scary because of excessive amounts of blood or gore. This is a lesson many filmmakers would benefit from.""Lady in the Water"" is not a very good film. But there are a couple of things making it worthy of a DVD rental.",2,Where O' Where Has Shyamalan Gone?,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,7580,"['sad', 'watch', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'peaked', 'so',

1028135,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000JLTR8Q,Tsuyoshi,"[9, 22]","The most brilliant thing in `Lady in the Water' is its stars - Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard. They did a fantastic job; the chemistry between them is real, and the latter's `The Lady in the Water' has ethereal beauty that makes us believe the presence of the nymphs.But I didn't like the film, not because the story is unbelievable or contrived. A narf from a bedtime story might rise from a small swimming pool in an apartment complex at night, and she might be saved by a lonely superintendent. I really like that part, and again I say, both Bryce Dallas Howard and Paul Giamatti playing these roles respectively are just wonderful.But the film is saddled with too many things - the meaning of `Story' or the narf is too obvious; the idea of `symbolist' `guardian' etc is interesting, but poorly handled (what is he reading, and how?); and one character played by Bob Balaban, which is also director M. Night Shyamalan's personal letter, is simply an unnecessary addition. A good story doesn't need any self-reference. It keeps telling something about itself, but M. Night Shyamalan is tempted to say something more.But what is most annoying to me is M. Night Shymalan himself, not as director, but as actor. He plays a pivotal role in `Lady in the Water,' but to be honest, he is no professional actor, and it is painfully clear when he is seen beside Paul Giamatti or Bryce Dallas Howard. What is worse is the nature of the role he assigned to himself - a misunderstood author whose works will be appreciated rightly in the future. I don't deny his talent as director, but this kind of personal reaction, if understandable itself, need necessarily not to be revealed on screen.M. Night Shyamalan, it is said, first thought of this film's plot as a bed-time story. A good bed-time story is always simple and, if it has a hidden meaning, it has to be to the point. A very good bed-time story is actually there, in the story about a narf and a super, just like `The Beauty and the Beast,' but we are not allowed to know about them very much.",2,A Bed-time Story That Should Have Been Simpler,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,2050,"['most', 'brilliant', 'thing', 'Lady', 'Water', 'stars', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'chemistry', 'real', 'latter', 'Lady', 'Water', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'believe', 'presence', 'nymphs.But', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'not', 'story', 'unbelievable', 'contrived', 'narf', 'bedtime', 'story', 'might', 'rise', 'small', 'swimming', 'pool', 'apartment', 'complex', 'night', 'might', 'be', 'saved', 'lonely', 'superintendent', 'really', 'part', 'again', 'say', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'playing', 'roles', 'respectively', 'are', 'just', 'film', 'saddled', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'meaning', 'Story', 'narf', 'too', 'obvious', 'idea', 'symbolist', 'guardian', 'etc', 'interesting', 'poorly', 'handled', 'what', 'reading', 'how', 'one', 'character', 'played', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'also', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'personal', 'letter', 'simply', 'unnecessary', 'addition', 'good', 'story', ""n't"", 'need', 'self-reference', 'telling', 'something', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'tempted', 'say', 'something', 'more.But', 'what', 'most', 'annoying', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shymalan', 'not', 'director', 'actor', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Lady', 'Water', 'be', 'honest', 'professional', 'actor', 'painfully', 'clear', 'when', 'seen', 'beside', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'What', 'worse', 'nature', 'role', 'assigned', 'misunderstood', 'author', 'works', 'will', 'be', 'appreciated', 'rightly', 'future', 'do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'talent', 'director', 'kind', 'personal', 'reaction', 'understandable', 'need', 'necessarily', 'not', 'be', 'revealed', 'screen.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'said', 'first', 'thought', 'film', 'plot', 'bed-time', 'story', 'good', 'bed-time', 'story', 'always', 'simple', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'be', 'point', 'very', 'good', 'bed-time', 'story', 'actually', 'there', 'story', 'narf', 'super', 'just', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'know', 'very', 'much']",N/A
1028136,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000JLTR8Q,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 8]","Breaking away from the suspense movies with a twist that have made him famous, M. Night Shyamalan's latest picture is a charming picture full of hopeful yearning and powerful cinematography.  Most simply put, the film is a fairy tale set in a modern day setting.  That makes sense since the film is based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan told his own children.The movie revolves around Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) a janitor of a local apartment complex.  Something happened to Heep's family several years ago and it's left him a humble, but broken man who stutters.  While trying to catch who is messing around in the swimming pool at nigh, Heep falls in and discovers he has been saved by the lady in the water.  Her name is Story and she is a sea-nyph, or narf, sent from the Blue World to deliver a message.  She has to find a writer and Cleveland agrees to assist her.  But, things aren't that simple.  An evil creature from the Blue World, a snark (a creature that looks like a giant wolf, but with a covering that looks like grass), has followed Story and tries to kill her when she's supposed to return home.  Story only has one last chance to get home, but she can't do it alone.Paul Giamatti is perfect as Cleveland Heep.  I might be mistaken, but Giamatti has now become one of those actors who makes every movie he is in better just because he's acting in it.  Bryce Dallas Howard seems a little old for the role of Story, but the mysterious gaze behind her eyes captures the innocence suggested in the part.  Shyamalan himself plays a large supporting role as the writer Story is seeking to meet, Vick.  In the past, Shyamalan has put himself in his own films, but only as a minor character.  In this film his role is central to the story and he does a good job of portraying the struggling actor who will write a book that will change the world.Shyamalan uses a lot of great cinematographic techniques to support the fine acting performances and wonderful plot.  For instance, there is a scene where Cleveland and Vick attempt to talk to Story in the bathroom, but through an interpreter (Vick's sister). In this scene the camera pans above the room from Story to Cleveland and it's an amazing shot.  There are also a lot of interesting shots done underwater.THE LADY IN THE WATER is a departure from the type of films that Shyamalan has made before.  I also know that he received a lot of criticism for this film because of his tight artistic control over the project.  Therefore, there was a lot of negative criticism about the movie even before it arrived in theatres.  People wanted to pan the picture even before seeing it.  Nevertheless, the film succeeds.  It is a fairy tale set in a modern setting.  Since the death of Jim Henson, there has never been a director who has been able to make a fairy tale movie and do it right (Terry Gilliam could have, but he's never tried).  Shyamalan has finally done that.  He has done it and done it well.  All the elements of a fairy tale are there as well as many of the themes that Shyamalan delved into before in SIGNS and THE VILLAGE.  This movie is about faith; about how things have a purpose.  This movie is about love and hope.  It is about living a life to the utmost, even though everything around you seems to tell you otherwise.THE LADY IN THE WATER is a great movie.  It might not have done very well at the box office, but I predict that it will gain a huge cult following in the next few years.  Next to SIGNS, it is my favorite Shyamalan film.",5,Inspiring Fairy Tale.,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,3522,"['Breaking', 'away', 'suspense', 'movies', 'twist', 'have', 'made', 'famous', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'latest', 'picture', 'charming', 'picture', 'full', 'hopeful', 'yearning', 'powerful', 'cinematography', 'Most', 'simply', 'put', 'film', 'fairy', 'tale', 'set', 'modern', 'day', 'setting', 'sense', 'film', 'based', 'bedtime', 'story', 'Shyamalan', 'told', 'own', 'children.The', 'movie', 'Cleveland', 'Heep', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'janitor', 'local', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Something', 'happened', 'Heep', 'family', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'left', 'humble', 'broken', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'catch', 'who', 'messing', 'around', 'swimming', 'pool', 'nigh', 'Heep', 'discovers', 'been', 'saved', 'lady', 'water', 'name', 'Story', 'sea-nyph', 'narf', 'sent', 'Blue', 'World', 'deliver', 'message', 'find', 'writer', 'Cleveland', 'assist', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'simple', 'evil', 'creature', 'Blue', 'World', 'snark', 'creature', 'giant', 'wolf', 'covering', 'grass', 'followed', 'Story', 'tries', 'kill', 'when', 'supposed', 'return', 'home', 'Story', 'only', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'get', 'home', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'alone.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'perfect', 'Cleveland', 'Heep', 'might', 'be', 'mistaken', 'Giamatti', 'now', 'become', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'movie', 'better', 'just', 'acting', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'little', 'old', 'role', 'Story', 'mysterious', 'gaze', 'eyes', 'innocence', 'suggested', 'part', 'Shyamalan', 'large', 'supporting', 'role', 'writer', 'Story', 'seeking', 'meet', 'Vick', 'past', 'Shyamalan', 'put', 'own', 'films', 'only', 'minor', 'character', 'film', 'role', 'central', 'story', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'struggling', 'actor', 'who', 'will', 'write', 'book', 'will', 'change', 'world.Shyamalan', 'lot', 'great', 'cinematographic', 'techniques', 'support', 'fine', 'acting', 'performances', 'wonderful', 'plot', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'Cleveland', 'Vick', 'attempt', 'talk', 'Story', 'bathroom', 'interpreter', 'Vick', 'sister', 'scene', 'camera', 'room', 'Story', 'Cleveland', 'amazing', 'shot', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'interesting', 'shots', 'done', 'underwater.THE', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', 'departure', 'type', 'films', 'Shyamalan', 'made', 'also', 'know', 'received', 'lot', 'criticism', 'film', 'tight', 'artistic', 'control', 'project', 'Therefore', 'was', 'lot', 'negative', 'criticism', 'movie', 'even', 'arrived', 'theatres', 'People', 'wanted', 'pan', 'picture', 'even', 'seeing', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'fairy', 'tale', 'set', 'modern', 'setting', 'death', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'never', 'been', 'director', 'who', 'been', 'able', 'make', 'fairy', 'tale', 'movie', 'do', 'right', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'tried', 'Shyamalan', 'finally', 'done', 'done', 'done', 'well', 'elements', 'fairy', 'tale', 'are', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'themes', 'Shyamalan', 'delved', 'SIGNS', 'THE', 'VILLAGE', 'movie', 'faith', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'purpose', 'movie', 'love', 'hope', 'living', 'life', 'utmost', 'even', 'everything', 'tell', 'otherwise.THE', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', 'great', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'predict', 'will', 'gain', 'huge', 'cult', 'following', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'Next', 'SIGNS', 'favorite', 'Shyamalan', 'film']",N/A

I had not heard anything very good about this film and frankly just rented it out of curiosity!This is a very sensitive and touching film.  The little story told in very childish sketches at the beginning about the people in the water trying to get along with and help humans was very mythical and good as a setup and if you paid attention to it.The story begins as Mr. Heeb is showing a new tenant, a grouchy film critic, to his apartment.  Mr. Heeb is the apartment manager and is beset with many problems from his tenants from the group of ""hippies"" who smoke and drink and seem to just sit around doing nothing to the husband whose wife has to call Mr. Heeb to fix the toilet, plumbing, etc.  On top of that, a tenant complains that the last few nights someone has been using the pool after hours.  Mr. Heeb is a very sad, depressed individual but he knows his job as apartment manager and decides to keep watch.He finds a young red haired woman swimming in the buff and picking up things that people have left by the side of the pool.  He brings her inside his place to talk to her and soon finds she is not what she seems.As Mr. Heeb works to find out more about the young woman named, Story, he learns more about the other tenants, about himself.  While the necessary evil monsters were scary more on a kid's level, the idea of evil was there and the wonderful things that happen to the tenants and Mr. Heeb are a delightful sequence of events!Of course, there are some obvious flaws in the story but nevertheless for a bit of fantasy and if you enjoy Mr. Shyamalan's movies, a tender movie to watch.

Lady in the Water is not really a horror or fantasy film like Sixth Sense and Signs, it's more of a supernatural thriller. There is a lot of good humorous moments delivered by the impeccable Paul Giamatti who finally gets a starring vehicle in a big budget show. The film is not very lavish in terms of sets and special effets, and the duration of the film is set inside and outside of a residential building. Very interesting swimming pool shape. The film has a good story-telling process, but it's not scary. It's funny and suspenseful, more than half of the film is dialogue driven. The creature makes a few brief mements, and didn't have the effect of a scene like the alien appearance in Signs. The supporting cast all turned in pretty good performance. Shymalan has writen quite a bit screentime of for himself. Cindy Cheung who plays the Korean neighbor has some stealing moments, but a few of the scenes of her opposite Giamatti is over her shoulder only without a reverse! Bryce Dallas Howard may appear on the poster exclusively, but her role has limited screentime compare to Giamatti, and it's not even as challenging as her blind girl character in The Village. I wished they had done more underwater scenes or give the viewers images of the ""Blue World"" where Story(The Lady) came from. Afterall, I don't see how this film costed $75 million to make.

But you would think that if there were ever water nymphs in the Northeastern part of the US, there would be local stories revolving around them. Nope, the only way that Paul Giamatti's character can figure out what is going on is by repeatedly trying to get a tenant to translate tidbits of an old Korean bedtime story from her non-English-speaking mother. This leads to perhaps one of the most cringe-inducing scenes in recent cinema, the Paul Giamatti milk-dribbling scene.Then there is this grass beastie that is trying to kill the water nymph, but it can easily hide in the 3 foot grass around the swimming pool. Umm... was the lawnmower not invented in this particular reality?The M. Night scenes were egotistical and tedious.There is also a lot of running around trying to find out which of the tenants fill which of the roles from the children's story (and ""Story"" also happens to be the name of the water nymph...wow, I bet it took weeks to come up with that imaginative moniker).There is a ludicrous scene in which a child tells the future looking at a shelf of cereal boxes and a group of men hanging around watching him buying into it. And let's not forget the deus ex machina evil tree monkeys!Overall the movie was meandering and failed in generating a suspension of disbelief.I wonder if M. knew this flick was a dog and shot the film-critic-in-the-hallway scene as a pre-emptive jab at the reviewers who would eviscerate this particular film.

In this one he has a major part, a writer, a messianic figure who is doomed to die no less.  A touch of ego?  His stars try hard, and to give them credit they read their awful lines with as much heart as can be expected.  Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor, but even he could not save this film.

Night Shyamalan's next masterpiece following ""The Village"".  After viewing it at that time, I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen in my life.  Six years later, after watching the film again with a younger sibling, I finally was able to understand the overall concept and thoroughly enjoy the experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Lady In The Water"" takes place in ""The Cove"", an apartment complex (complete with swimming pool) owned by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti).  When a mermaid-like being named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) suddenly turns up in Heep's pool, an entirely new world (with completely new beings) is discovered, one that Story must get back to at all costs.If you try to compare ""Lady in the Water"" to M. Night's earlier fare, you will be severely disappointed.  This is not a ""surprise ending"" film, nor is it a psychological thriller.  Comparing it to movies like ""Signs"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", & ""The Village"" is like comparing apples to oranges.  When I originally watched the film, I was expecting the past and missed what this movie really is all about.The real genius of this movie?  It is essentially a modern-day fairy tale.  Based on a bedtime story M. Night told his children that later took on epic proportions, Shyamalan adapted the story into a major motion picture.  As such, the story is incredibly original and quite fantastical, filled with imaginative characters and quirky real-life individuals.  This project is a labor of love for M. Night, and I respect him for making it and making it well.The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars is because some of the plot points do not exactly line up.  Yes, it is a fairy tale, but it is quite a bit fractured at that.  It contains nothing ""worthy"" of the multiple Razzy Awards it ended up winning, but a few points in the film are a bit confusing/nonsensical.Overall, upon second viewing (with a completely different frame of mind), ""Lady In The Water"" is inches shy of a truly classic film.  Once you understand WHY M. Night made the movie, you'll respect it in a completely different light.",4,Absolutely CANNOT Be Judged Against Its M.

Night Shyamalan, so I'm not writing a bad review because I'm disappointed in this film compared to his previous endeavors, although his other films are clearly more critically appreciated and arguably better written and executed.The acting on all fronts is superb - Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard stand out in their respective roles as a depressed apartment manager and some kind of mermaid fairy tale figure.The cinematography of the entire film has a kind of greenish-blue hue around it which makes the film beautiful visually, but stunningly disappointing story-wise. A mermaid appears one day in the pool of the apartment complex, and the apartment manager sets out to try to get her home.What follows is an inanely repetitive story line in which Paul Giamatti repeatedly asks an old woman about an ancient myth. Each time he learns something new it then happens in real life. In trying to move away from his secret twist endings, it seems Shyamalan moved so far away that he  decided to spell out every step of the film without a surprise to be found.This leaves the viewer as bored as Shyamalan must have been writing the script. After over two hours of watching what you've just been told is about to happen, viewers will find themselves ready for the film to end in its predictable way so they can get on with their lives.Unless you're really interested in M.
