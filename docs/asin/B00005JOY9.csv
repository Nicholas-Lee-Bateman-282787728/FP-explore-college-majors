643790,A34VV92TSLC37R,B00005JOY9,Adam Craig,"[0, 2]","Scary Movie 4 continues on in the path of number 3, which took more of a spoof, slapstick route of comedy than the first two films.  While some of the jokes do fail miserably, there are a few genuinely funny, clever moments, and that is more than can be said for a lot of comedies these days.When looking back on the movie, there are 4 parts that I distinctly remember as being absolutely hilarious.  The film opens with a Saw parody featuring Dr. Phil and Shaq.  The only way they can get the saws to hack of their foots is for Shaq to make a free throw, and it is great to see another star who isn't afraid to make fun of themselves.  This scene was definitely one of the funniest of the film.  Secondly, the brief Brokeback Mountain spoof is absolutely hilarious.  Anthony Anderson and his sidekick as two black, gay cowboys could not be any funnier.  Million Dollar Baby is also royally spoofed, with a scene that is shockingly funny.  Let's just say that the horrible event that happened in Million Dollar Baby happens about 10 more times in about 30 seconds.  Finally, in what was probably the funniest part of the movie, the last part of the film is the ""Tom Cruise on Oprah"" parody.  And it is so hilarious because no matter how much they try to spoof that scene, it all pretty much actually happened because of Cruise's absolute insanity.  Hilarious stuff.Other than those 4 specific scenes, though, the humor in the film is simply average, recycled humor that we have all seen many times before.  While the movie didn't quite live up to my expectations, I did get a few good laughs out of it, and that is all that can be asked of a comedy.  I still hope they do a Scary Movie 5, considering they will have a lot more material due to the outbreak of horror films at the box office recently.""Enjoy your purple nurple, Tom""",3,"Doesn't live up to 3, but still funny",1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,1830,"['Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'path', 'number', '3', 'took', 'more', 'spoof', 'slapstick', 'route', 'comedy', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'jokes', 'do', 'fail', 'miserably', 'are', 'few', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'clever', 'moments', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'lot', 'comedies', 'days.When', 'looking', 'back', 'movie', 'are', '4', 'parts', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'being', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'film', 'Saw', 'parody', 'featuring', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'Shaq', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'saws', 'hack', 'foots', 'Shaq', 'make', 'free', 'throw', 'great', 'see', 'star', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'make', 'fun', 'scene', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'funniest', 'film', 'Secondly', 'brief', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'spoof', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'sidekick', 'two', 'black', 'gay', 'cowboys', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'funnier', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'also', 'royally', 'spoofed', 'scene', 'shockingly', 'funny', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'horrible', 'event', 'happened', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', '10', 'more', 'times', '30', 'seconds', 'Finally', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Oprah', 'parody', 'so', 'hilarious', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'try', 'spoof', 'scene', 'pretty', 'much', 'actually', 'happened', 'Cruise', 'absolute', 'insanity', 'Hilarious', 'stuff.Other', '4', 'specific', 'scenes', 'though', 'humor', 'film', 'simply', 'average', 'recycled', 'humor', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'did', 'get', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'can', 'be', 'asked', 'comedy', 'still', 'hope', 'do', 'Scary', 'Movie', '5', 'considering', 'will', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'material', 'due', 'outbreak', 'horror', 'films', 'box', 'office', 'recently', 'Enjoy', 'purple', 'nurple', 'Tom']",N/A

643793,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B00005JOY9,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[3, 6]","Scary Movie 4 is a lot like Zucker's other films in the fact that the comedy is so stupid that it's funny, the acting is over done purposely, and the great Leslie Nielson was cast in a role. And also like much of Zucker's work, the film fails to have enough substance to hold any water with other classic comedies. Ok...let's be honest...no body was expecting a masterpiece for the fourth installment of the Scary Movie franchise, which is gradually losing it's flare that it once had. But what is the film missing? Or is there to much added? Well never fear fellow movie fans, Andrew is here.In an ever present goal of pushing the envelope, Zucker mixes toilet and physical humor with parody poking fun at everything from War Of The Worlds and Saw, to Brokeback Mountain and Million Dollar Baby. But the question arises. How far can you push the envelope until it fails to be funny and begins to be nauseating. Watch Scary Movie 4 for the answer. Take this as an example. What is funnier? Confusing a water bowl for a bed pan or actually confusing the bowl for the pan, and bathing a catotonic woman with the contents of the pan? Yeah...I thought the same thing. The latter of the two is what occurs, and it paints a plain line of what is pushing the envelope, and what is burning the envelope to ashes.Poor David Zucker. He tries so hard to please everyone. He wants a little bit of everything so that everyone can laugh and be entertained. The result is a movie full of unfunny comedy. There is so much going on, and so many jokes being cracked, in so many different ways, that the film has no comedic focus. There is a hilarious beginning, a humorous end, and a few laughs in between, but the majority of the meat and potatoes of the movie was the type of physical comedy that everyone else has seen and expects from a screwball comedy.So what does all of that mean, you ask? Let's put it this way. Stupid comedy's are not reliant on good acting or masterful direction, but on a expertly written scripts and good comedic timing. Which really is a shame because Scary Movie 4 does not have a good script or good timing, as can be seen from the good beginning/good end format. The acting was pretty much what I expected from my experience of watching the other Scary Movie films. Though there are some good cameos! Shaq and Dr. Phil in one scene, Chingy in another. And one of these cameos is my favorite part of the movie.Sometimes a movie like this is a good thing. When your just chilling out with a bunch of friends, or having a slumber party or something like that, this movie would come to good use at times like that. But I don't recommend sitting down with your grandmother and watching it. This is definitely a movie to wait for on DVD. It's not worth the money or the effort to run off to the theater to see it. If you liked the other three Scary Movie's, then you will most likely like this one. And if you haven't seen one of the films yet, then give it a go! Even if you don't like it, you won't be left out of any Scary Movie conversations.2.5/5",3,War Of The Saw And The Grudge of Brokeback Mountain,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,3061,"['Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'lot', 'Zucker', 'other', 'films', 'fact', 'comedy', 'so', 'stupid', 'funny', 'acting', 'done', 'purposely', 'great', 'Leslie', 'Nielson', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'also', 'much', 'Zucker', 'work', 'film', 'have', 'enough', 'substance', 'hold', 'water', 'other', 'classic', 'comedies', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'body', 'was', 'expecting', 'masterpiece', 'fourth', 'installment', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'gradually', 'losing', 'flare', 'once', 'had', 'what', 'film', 'missing', 'there', 'much', 'added', 'Well', 'never', 'fear', 'fellow', 'movie', 'fans', 'Andrew', 'ever', 'present', 'goal', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'Zucker', 'mixes', 'toilet', 'physical', 'humor', 'parody', 'poking', 'fun', 'everything', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Saw', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'question', 'How', 'far', 'can', 'push', 'envelope', 'be', 'funny', 'be', 'nauseating', 'Watch', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'answer', 'Take', 'example', 'What', 'funnier', 'Confusing', 'water', 'bowl', 'bed', 'pan', 'actually', 'confusing', 'bowl', 'pan', 'bathing', 'catotonic', 'woman', 'contents', 'pan', 'Yeah', 'thought', 'same', 'thing', 'latter', 'two', 'what', 'plain', 'line', 'what', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'what', 'burning', 'envelope', 'ashes.Poor', 'David', 'Zucker', 'so', 'hard', 'please', 'everyone', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'everyone', 'can', 'laugh', 'be', 'entertained', 'result', 'movie', 'full', 'unfunny', 'comedy', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'so', 'many', 'jokes', 'being', 'cracked', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'film', 'comedic', 'focus', 'hilarious', 'beginning', 'humorous', 'end', 'few', 'laughs', 'majority', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'movie', 'was', 'type', 'physical', 'comedy', 'everyone', 'else', 'seen', 'screwball', 'comedy.So', 'what', 'mean', 'ask', 'Let', 'put', 'way', 'Stupid', 'comedy', 'are', 'not', 'reliant', 'good', 'acting', 'masterful', 'direction', 'expertly', 'written', 'scripts', 'good', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Which', 'really', 'shame', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'timing', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'good', 'beginning/good', 'end', 'format', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected', 'experience', 'watching', 'other', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'cameos', 'Shaq', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'one', 'scene', 'Chingy', 'one', 'cameos', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie.Sometimes', 'movie', 'good', 'thing', 'When', 'just', 'chilling', 'out', 'bunch', 'friends', 'having', 'slumber', 'party', 'something', 'movie', 'would', 'come', 'good', 'use', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'sitting', 'down', 'grandmother', 'watching', 'definitely', 'movie', 'wait', 'DVD', 'not', 'worth', 'money', 'effort', 'run', 'off', 'theater', 'see', 'liked', 'other', 'three', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'then', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'films', 'yet', 'then', 'give', 'go', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'conversations.2.5/5']",N/A

I remember being pushed to the brink of giving up when I was writing the review for Part 3 some time ago. As my title says, how do I review this?. It's not really a movie to delve into deeply and critique the acting and writing when the movie is the kind of movie where none of that really matters. The best thing I can say about this latest chapter in the neverending series is that at least it's better than the other recent spoof ""Date Movie"". Scary Movie 4 was an improvement over part 2, but this one isn't over 3. This time around, our hopeless heroine Cindy Campbell(the still game Anna Faris)is battling two different situations that blend into each other. She is house sitting in a house with a creepy ghost(spoofing ""The Grudge""), while her neighbor Tom Ryan(Craig Bierko)is trying to keep his kids alive when an alien invasion hits(spoofing ""War Of The Worlds""). Cindy and Tom fall for each other, and the two storylines, well, does it matter?. Not really. Regina Hall returns as Brenda, who keeps taking a lickin' but keeps on tickin'. She is always fun, really. Other films getting the spoof treatment here include ""The Village"", ""Saw"", and not surprisingly, ""Brokeback Mountain"". I do have to say that this film is a bit more consistent than the last film in that it's big storylines merge together better instead of being an endless parade of unconnected scenes just to spoof something. Leslie Nielsen returns from part 3 as the president, as does Charlie Sheen, who appears in an uncredited cameo. Carmen Electra, Chris Elliot, Bill Pullman, Simon Rex, James Earl Jones, and Molly Shannon all appear as well. Dr. Phil pops up in the amusing opening minutes. And who hasn't wanted to hear Dr. Phil curse and reveal he's a fraud?. Scary Movie 4 is stupid, of course, but there's a few good laughs here. I especially enjoyed the ribbing of Tom Cruise's recent behavior in the end. Mad TV's Debra Wilson plays Oprah, and her Oprah was always the best. A lot falls flat, but I wasn't ever bored. I guess the biggest disappointment about this movie is that it turned out the way it did even with the pedigree it has behind it. Director David Zucker(Airplane, The Naked Gun), and the writing talents of Zucker alums Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft. It should of been better. SM 4 is innocent, stupid, and watchable. It made money, again, and a 5th one is no doubt a go picture. One wonders how much longer this series will go on.

I really like the Scary Movie series, they are funny & entertaining. I think Scary Movie 4 is the weakest one in the series, but I still enjoyed the movie. I recommend that you buy the Unrated version of the movie because the Rated version is not as good. The movie was the first Scary Movie to be filmed in HD, so I think the blu-ray will look really good. I think Scary Movie 4 is a fun & enjoyable movie! :)*Review on Blu-Ray*The Blu-Ray is (kind of) a step up from the DVD except for the fact that the blu-ray does not have a main menu which I find annoying. The movie just plays in repeat. To access the menu, you must press the pop-up menu. It will give you a list of special features which they call ""Original DVD Features"" but if they are they have different titles, well atleast a couple. If you own the DVD, there is no reason to own the blu-ray unless you are a fan of Anna Faris (like me) or love the Scary Movie series. I just want 2 and 3 to be released.

I love spoofs and parodies, and the Scary Movie films are my favorite...but I must say I was disappointed.Scary Movie 4 spoofed several films, among them: War of the Worlds, Saw, The Village, The Grudge, Brokeback Mountain, Million Dollar Baby, Dr. Phil, and many more.I was disappointed in this film mainly due to...the writing. The film didn't have a good flow, and the scenes seemed to be too jumbled together. The movie also seemed like it was a little forced. Although there has been a recent upswing in the Horror movie trend, which should provide plenty of extra material for the Scary Movie franchise to parody...it still seemed as if they were scraping the bottom of the barrel.I didn't like how ""War of the Worlds"" was the main ""storyline"" the film follows. I kind of feel like they've already done the 'alien invasion' thing when they spoofed ""Signs"" in Scary Movie 3. They probably should have gone a different route, but they didn't.The unrated DVD edition does have some fun features. It contains director commentary, deleted/extended scenes, a blooper reel, and numerous behind-the-scenes type featurettes. These are all great things to have on a DVD disc, but they don't necessarily save the film from falling short of it's predecessors.All in all, the film was mildly entertaining, but did not live up to the standards that Scary Movies 1 & 2 set.

643802,A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B00005JOY9,"Chandler ""Infamous""","[2, 4]","Scary Movie, has brought us some humorous movies as paroodies of real movies, such as Scream, The Ring, Signs, and many more has hit us with a fourth part of their series. The fourth part of the Scary Movie series has to be the worst one ever made, to me. To me, there were barely any funny parts in the movie. Infact, I was borderline asleep about 45 minutes into it. Maybe they just took their series one part too far, running out of gas when it came to paroodies, causing this movie's concept to fail.There were a few ""heh, heh"" moments here and there, but none were rememberable. The only few parts that were funny was the imitation of ""Brokeback Mountain"" involving the person Anthony Anderson played, but that part of the movie was played out as a highlight of it's trailer and the previews, causing me to see it about 50 times before I saw the movie. And the first half of Cindy's boxing match with a female looking Mike Tyson, but soon that got old.Now if you're familiar with the Scary Movie series, you'd know they make one huge paroody of a certain movie and base theirs around that (the first was Scream, second was Signs, third was The Ring). This one they use War Of The World's, and that isn't as funny (think of the origonal movie, they use the same exact plot but some pointless additions to it, trying to make it funny).As for acting, the actors are good. Anna Faris plays the Cindy Campbell role perfectly. So does Anthony Anderson, and Craig Bierko with their roles. The screen play was just horrible in my opinion.There are some pointless guest appearances in the movie. Basketball star Shaq is on the cover of the DVD, but he and Dr. Phil only appear in the fist 5 minutes of the movie and thats it. And Chingy and Lil Jon makes a short appearance, mostly in the deleated scenes.Speaking of deleated scenes, some of them should have stayed deleated, because they made no sense (especially the ones with the Tri-pod...and Brenda And The H-500, what the hell was that about???). As for the Bloopers, I managed to keep a staight face through out the them. Some of them I laughed at, managing to struggule to earn the extra half-star in my review along with somemore of the bonus features.Unfortunatly, this isn't a good Scary Movie. For me, it was just too bad to be anything much. If you're seriously obsessed with the Scary Movie series and you want to complete your collection, then buy this. I'm pretty sure that those people will dislike my review, but I have to give my honest opinion and call it one of the worst movies I've seen in 2006. If they ever decide (and I say ""decide"" very loosely) to make a Scary Movie 5, hopefully it will be more thoughtout than this one. Go ahead and bring on some unhelpful votes because you can't accept the fact that this was a bad movie -point blank.",1,Scary Movie 4??

643803,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JOY9,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","I don't know whether it's funny or appalling that ""Scary Movie 4"" opens with Dr. Phil in a comedic send up of ""Saw."" On the one hand, I praised him for his willingness to poke fun at himself; only those who are secure with themselves would have the guts to laugh at their own shortcomings. On the other hand, it makes me wonder how someone with such a dignified title as Doctor would actually want to stoop to this level of entertainment. Even if you find the jokes hysterical, that still doesn't change the fact that this is a mindless movie, free from any notions of complexity, depth, or meaning. If he expects America to take him seriously after participating in a parody film, he has a lot of work ahead of him.I suppose it helped that Shaquille O'Neal was also in that scene; for whatever reason, I find it easier to accept him in a parody role than Dr. Phil. Maybe that's because Shaq has made fun of himself plenty of times already, and because of that, we know what to expect of him. You might say that he delivers what he promises. The same can be said for ""Scary Movie 4"": it promises and delivers comedic reinterpretations of various horror films. It also delivers a host of gags that would only appeal to immature thirteen-year-olds. Some would find that awful, but if you stop and think about it, don't we all have an immature side that's just begging to be let loose every once in a while? It's easy to see that the writers knew this perfectly well. They definitely made use of their own immature sides; why else would they include Charlie Sheen downing a bottle of Viagra and getting a comically over-exaggerated erection (and I really do mean comically over-exaggerated)? Furthermore, why else would they include Leslie Nielsen, whose resume is so loaded with parody films that his casting in and of itself is a clich??In all honesty, I'm torn over my feelings for this movie. For something that was intentionally made to be juvenile, it still comes off as something we've already seen a thousand times before. The only new aspects are the borrowed films that receive the comedic touch. If I remember correctly, they include: ""War of the Worlds,"" ""Saw,"" ""The Village,"" ""The Grudge,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" and ""Million Dollar Baby."" (I feel obliged to point out that the last two are not scary movies. But I guess that's just me nitpicking.) The filmmakers even went as far as to mock Tom Cruise's ridiculous appearance on ""Oprah"" (which was a parody to begin with). They all come together in an absolute mishmash of a plot, one that primarily concerns the developing love between Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) and Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko).Cindy has been assigned as the caregiver for Mrs. Norris (Cloris Leachman), an elderly catatonic living in a house haunted by the pasty-faced ghost of a Japanese boy. Almost at the same time this is established, Tom and his bitter children are caught in the middle of an alien attack, a whirlwind of destruction led by a group of aliens called Tr-iPods (who emerge from a gigantic iPod). There is a connection between these events, and the only ones who can discover it are Cindy and her friend Brenda (Regina Hall). The search for the truth will lead them through many comedic misadventures, including a visit to an isolated village that time forgot and their imprisonment at the hands of malevolent, puppet-like aliens (ones who only let their captives escape by means of extreme, murderous methods).I suppose this plot description may have been unnecessary. For a film like ""Scary Movie 4,"" no one really cares about plot; the only thing the audience is interested in is the humor. Take, for example, a group of teenagers: would they really bother with describing the story to their friends in school, explaining just how the sequence of events unfolded? Probably not. But I guarantee you that they will crack up over Cloris Leachman accidentally getting washed with her own urine, or how a blind girl named Holly (Carmen Electra) mistakes a church for her home and uses a pew for a toilet (a scene made funnier by the fact that the church was full of people at the time). The filmmakers knew exactly what age group they were aiming for, and that alone shows they have their fingers on the pulse of the adolescent scene.Unfortunately, that's only impressive if you enjoy mindless entertainment. The reality of the situation is that this movie is by no means necessary or enlightening. I think it's getting to the point where we need to take a break from parodies--or at the very least, these kinds of parodies. The first two ""Scary Movie"" films, directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, were somewhat original in their approach, considering their emphasis on teenage promiscuity and the Slasher Film genre. But by the time the third movie came along, the standards were considerably lowered. And now we have this fourth installment, which is just silliness for the sake of being silly. It's the same concept behind many of Hollywood's tamer parodies, like those of the ""Hot Shots!"" or ""Naked Gun"" series. I'm not saying these are bad films; what I am saying is that ""Scary Movie 4"" isn't any better than they are. If you liked the humor presented in the ""Hot Shots!"" or ""Naked Gun"" films, you'd be just as satisfied renting one of them as you would be seeing this in theaters. True, you'd be robbed of a night out with your friends, but at least you'd be saving a couple of bucks on theater tickets.",3,"It's My Parody, and I'll Cry if I Want to",1144972800,"04 14,

643804,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B00005JOY9,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[10, 12]","For all of you purists out there who insist, year after year, that all movie franchises be put out of their misery I present to you the Scary Movie series. After a ho hum first go round and a disastrous second try the series suddenly got. . .well. . Good. 3 was worth the price of admission and so is 4. Not all sequels are stale, and once is a blue moon they get better as they go along. Anna Farris once again plays the dumbest girl ever to be trapped in a Hollywood hall of mirrors. This particular film follows the basic plot of ""War of the Worlds"" with lots of sidetracking along the way. The Scary Movies have been used as an indictment against the cinema and the culture of the time. So in this installment we get an infestation of creepy looking Asian kids with bad complexions and Dr. Phil. I was a big fan of ""War of the Worlds"" so I honestly believe that ""Scary Movie 4"" could have been improved by going with a crappier movie (say ""Van Helsing"") but I'll happily look upon it as a tribute as opposed to a slap in the face. After playing around with ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Ring Two"" for a while the Tripods finally attacks and our heroes are driven into a certain ""Village"" where the film stalls and nearly sinks.Luckily the final third is hilarious and saves everything that came before it. I laughed the hardest at the split second Chingy cameo which was comedic gold. From there it rolls into a ""Saw II"" parody which delivers big time on the belly laughs. The best scene overall, however, takes place early on and is a vicious take on ""Million Dollar Baby."" Their version re-imagines the fateful fight with Mike Tyson playing an ear chomping, muscle bound female whose rear end sets off a stinging string of neck snappings. I also liked the way that the actors themselves were lampooned by the director, David Zucker. Shaq's inability to hit free throws and Charlie Sheen's inability to control his male urges are both used as fodder. Also, when a less than attractive woman reports to the President (played by Leslie Nielsen) that she was not one of those stripped naked by the aliens he replies by saying, ""Finally, some good news.""The strategy employed by those who make these films is to take a million jokes and throw them against the screen. The audience can take what they want and leave what they want. None of the jokes could really be considered obscure so there is little danger in going over the audiences head. You will have to put up with the usual animated violence and bathroom humor, and until this genre sheds that skin they will be just as cliched as the cliche riddled films they are ridiculing. At the very end we get a near perfect take on the water cooler moment of the past few years: Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah's couch. The scene is outrageous and stupid, but also funny, and that is all that matters. I once had a friend tell me that the couch jumping scared her (which in turn scared me that somebody could be scared so easily). But what she doesn't understand is that without that extreme moment of glee from Cruise we wouldn't be able to laugh ourselves senseless over it, now that's scary. ***1/4",3,Enjoy Your Purple Nurple,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,3143,"['who', 'insist', 'year', 'year', 'movie', 'be', 'put', 'misery', 'present', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'series', 'ho', 'hum', 'first', 'go', 'round', 'disastrous', 'second', 'try', 'series', 'suddenly', 'got', '.well', 'Good', '3', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'so', '4', 'Not', 'sequels', 'are', 'stale', 'once', 'blue', 'moon', 'get', 'better', 'go', 'along', 'Anna', 'Farris', 'once', 'again', 'dumbest', 'girl', 'ever', 'be', 'trapped', 'Hollywood', 'hall', 'mirrors', 'particular', 'film', 'basic', 'plot', 'War', 'Worlds', 'lots', 'sidetracking', 'way', 'Scary', 'Movies', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'indictment', 'cinema', 'culture', 'time', 'So', 'installment', 'get', 'infestation', 'creepy', 'looking', 'Asian', 'kids', 'bad', 'complexions', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'War', 'Worlds', 'honestly', 'believe', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'going', 'crappier', 'movie', 'say', 'Van', 'Helsing', ""'ll"", 'happily', 'look', 'upon', 'tribute', 'opposed', 'slap', 'face', 'playing', 'around', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Ring', 'Two', 'Tripods', 'finally', 'attacks', 'heroes', 'are', 'driven', 'certain', 'Village', 'where', 'film', 'stalls', 'nearly', 'sinks.Luckily', 'final', 'third', 'hilarious', 'everything', 'came', 'laughed', 'hardest', 'split', 'second', 'Chingy', 'cameo', 'was', 'comedic', 'gold', 'Saw', 'II', 'parody', 'big', 'time', 'belly', 'best', 'scene', 'overall', 'however', 'place', 'early', 'vicious', 'take', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'version', 'fateful', 'fight', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'playing', 'ear', 'chomping', 'muscle', 'female', 'rear', 'end', 'off', 'stinging', 'string', 'neck', 'snappings', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'actors', 'were', 'lampooned', 'director', 'David', 'Zucker', 'Shaq', 'inability', 'hit', 'free', 'throws', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'inability', 'control', 'male', 'urges', 'are', 'used', 'fodder', 'Also', 'when', 'less', 'attractive', 'woman', 'reports', 'President', 'played', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'stripped', 'naked', 'aliens', 'saying', 'Finally', 'good', 'news', 'strategy', 'employed', 'who', 'make', 'films', 'take', 'million', 'jokes', 'throw', 'screen', 'audience', 'can', 'take', 'what', 'want', 'leave', 'what', 'want', 'None', 'jokes', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'considered', 'obscure', 'so', 'little', 'danger', 'going', 'audiences', 'head', 'will', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'usual', 'animated', 'violence', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'genre', 'skin', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'cliched', 'cliche', 'riddled', 'films', 'are', 'ridiculing', 'very', 'end', 'get', 'near', 'perfect', 'take', 'water', 'cooler', 'moment', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'jumping', 'Oprah', 'couch', 'scene', 'outrageous', 'stupid', 'also', 'funny', 'matters', 'once', 'had', 'friend', 'tell', 'couch', 'jumping', 'scared', 'turn', 'scared', 'somebody', 'could', 'be', 'scared', 'so', 'easily', 'what', ""n't"", 'understand', 'extreme', 'moment', 'glee', 'Cruise', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'laugh', 'senseless', 'now', 'scary', '***1/4']",N/A
643805,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JOY9,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 3]","While I tend to enjoy satirical comedies on occasion, parody/gross-out movies now and then can still entertain. The problem though with these kind of movies is that the jokes seem to come rapid fire as if the comedy writers weren't sure their jokes would actually make people laugh so they toss in a whole slew of them just to make sure you actually laughed. What started out as a gross-out comedy series became halfway a parody movie similar to Wrongfully Accused or Mafia. And the film's quite funny on occasion, just don't expect to laugh at everything.Scary Movie repeat Anna Faris reprises her role as Cindy Campbell, the lovable blonde who's taking care of an old woman in a house similar to the Grudge. Living next door to her is a potential man in her life, whose living the War of the Worlds angle. Aliens start attacking and they're on the run with many spoofs coming their way.One of the oft-repeated jokes of these movies is people getting smacked with something whether it's a car door, an actual car, a suitcase etc. It's funny on occasion but after awhile, it feels like a clone with a different coat on. However, there's many jokes that do work: a parody of that jerky coming down the stairs from the Grudge ends in a humorous(if predictable) way while cameo Michael Madsen has a line about wolves and maggots that was very funny. The parodies keep going as they lampoon Saw, the aforementioned Grudge and War of the Worlds, Brokeback Mountain, the Village and Tom Cruise's infamous appearance on Oprah Winfrey(probably the funniest one here).You've got lots of cameos from Dr. Phil to Shaq to Carmen Electra to Bill Pullman to Charlie Sheen and even Mike Tyson shows up. You would think after awhile it would simply be not funny but it does elicit some laughs. Of course Anna Faris is perfect and Craig Bierko does a dead-on Tom Cruise throughout the whole movie.There's not a whole lot to say about these kind of movies, either you found it funny or it fell flat on its face.

Additional characters such as Shaq, Chingy, ""Dr."" Phil, Bill Pullman (Henry Hale), Leslie Nielson (Mr. President), and Craig Bierko (as tom ryan) adds fresh perspectives at the comedy.  At one time or another, something will make you laugh in this movie.The movies spoofed are The Grudge, SAW and SAW II, War of the Worlds, The Villiage, Brokeback Mountain, and Million Dollar Baby.

Rossi,"[0, 0]","Much as we hate to admit, we want to be scared, that's why we watch the horror genre, and it's because of the high suspension of disbelief factor that we end up also seeing comic send-ups of the genre. The good news is that grand-master of comedy Zucker seems to be trying to get back more of the feeling of dead-on hits from earlier in his spoof career like the Airplane movies, Hot Shots, and Naked Gun. It's just too bad that elements from earlier in the scary movie franchise still haven't been entirely excised from the scary movie formula. In 4, the jokes that are arguably 'on', are more 'on' than in any of the scary movie series. And there are definitely a huge amount of 'on' jokes. But there's still also too much that makes it feel like just as scary movie 4 is  hitting it's stride toward comedic greatness, it's reigned back down a few notches. Plus, unlike the previous Scary Movies, there just wasn't enough spoofing going on. In earlier iterations, you could pick out jokes from literally a dozen or more sources, in 4 it seemed to just be spoofing three movies continuously, with an occasional pop culture reference thrown in. Come on, there have been TONS of scare-fests both good and bad that easily could have been targeted for pokes in the ribs. Scary Movie 5 has been a long time in speculation and I hope that the extra time means more of a comedic blood bath for horror fans to chuckle at.

643813,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B00005JOY9,David R. Eastwood,"[0, 0]","SCARY MOVIE 4 (2006) is a 90-minute spoof of such films as THE GRUDGE, SAW, THE VILLAGE, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, and WAR OF THE WORLDS, with adolescent jokes of all sorts firing and misfiring almost nonstop. It is, for the most part, aimed at teenager males and young men in their early twenties, and it is probably funniest when viewed with five or more friends and (if one is old enough) a couple cases of beer. Most other viewers probably will tend to find it far less funny.The large cast includes Shaquille O'Neil and Dr. Phil (playing themselves), Charlie Sheen (apparently uncredited), Anna Faris and Craig Bierko (as the two central characters, ""Cindy"" and ""Tom""), Leslie Nielsen (as ""President Baxter Harris""), Carmen Electra, Bill Pullman, and James Earl Jones.The main ""plot"" chiefly parallels that of WAR OF THE WORLDS (including a scene parodying Tom Cruise operating a crane), although some extra footage spoofing BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was shot after the rest of the movie was done and was spliced in near the beginning to pad out the length of this film. In the closing scene, a second Tom Cruise tie-in appears, with Craig Bierko (""Tom"") mocking Cruise's insanely-in-love antics on Oprah's TV show.To my taste as an older person, the funniest two scenes showed Craig Bierko splitting logs in his yard (not from trees but Duraflame logs from a grocery or hardware store, still wrapped in yellow paper) and Leslie Nielsen as an inept president visiting a school and being unwilling to make any decisions about the alien invasion because he wants to hear how a story about a lost pet duck ends. The best line, I thought, was when Nielsen is finally ready to take action and says, ""Get me Homer Landsquiddy"" instead of Homeland Security.The DVD version contains extra material that was deleted from the theatrical release due to its explicit sexual nature. One bonus feature is a full-length audio commentary by the filmmakers (which is often pretty lame, as they stumble around, forgetting actors' names and what happened during production). Other bonuses are alternate versions of some scenes, a few bloopers, and a kind of valentine from some cast members to director David Zucker, telling us how great it was to work with a comic genius like him.",2,SUFFERS FROM A COMIC QUALITY-CONTROL PROBLEM,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,2256,"['SCARY', 'MOVIE', '4', '2006', '90-minute', 'spoof', 'such', 'films', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'SAW', 'THE', 'VILLAGE', 'MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'BABY', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'adolescent', 'jokes', 'sorts', 'firing', 'misfiring', 'almost', 'nonstop', 'most', 'part', 'aimed', 'teenager', 'males', 'young', 'men', 'early', 'twenties', 'probably', 'funniest', 'when', 'viewed', 'five', 'more', 'friends', 'one', 'old', 'enough', 'couple', 'cases', 'beer', 'Most', 'other', 'viewers', 'probably', 'will', 'tend', 'find', 'far', 'less', 'funny.The', 'large', 'cast', 'Shaquille', ""O'Neil"", 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'playing', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'apparently', 'uncredited', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Craig', 'Bierko', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'Cindy', 'Tom', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'President', 'Baxter', 'Harris', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones.The', 'main', 'plot', 'chiefly', 'parallels', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'including', 'scene', 'parodying', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'operating', 'crane', 'extra', 'footage', 'spoofing', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'was', 'shot', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'spliced', 'beginning', 'pad', 'out', 'length', 'film', 'closing', 'scene', 'second', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'tie-in', 'Craig', 'Bierko', 'Tom', 'mocking', 'Cruise', 'insanely-in-love', 'antics', 'Oprah', 'TV', 'show.To', 'taste', 'older', 'person', 'funniest', 'two', 'scenes', 'showed', 'Craig', 'Bierko', 'splitting', 'logs', 'yard', 'not', 'trees', 'Duraflame', 'logs', 'grocery', 'hardware', 'store', 'still', 'wrapped', 'yellow', 'paper', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'inept', 'president', 'visiting', 'school', 'being', 'unwilling', 'make', 'decisions', 'alien', 'invasion', 'hear', 'how', 'story', 'lost', 'pet', 'duck', 'best', 'line', 'thought', 'was', 'when', 'Nielsen', 'finally', 'ready', 'take', 'action', 'Get', 'Homer', 'Landsquiddy', 'instead', 'Homeland', 'Security.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'extra', 'material', 'was', 'deleted', 'theatrical', 'release', 'due', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'nature', 'One', 'bonus', 'feature', 'full-length', 'audio', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'often', 'pretty', 'lame', 'stumble', 'around', 'forgetting', 'actors', 'names', 'what', 'happened', 'production', 'Other', 'bonuses', 'are', 'alternate', 'versions', 'scenes', 'few', 'bloopers', 'kind', 'valentine', 'cast', 'members', 'director', 'David', 'Zucker', 'telling', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'work', 'comic', 'genius']",N/A

It's still kind of funny in some scenes but it lacks the quality of the first two. Here's the breakdown.1.  Directing--The directing from David Zucker is just okay. I personally preferred Keenen Ivory Wayans who directed the first two.2.  Script--Face it, the script sucked. It's not very funny, and sometimes it's just plain stupid. Yeah, some of it is okay, but that's it. It's just okay, unlike the first two, which were excellent.3.  Acting--This is something that has never improved in the Scary Movie series. It's just okay. You've still got Anna Faris and the late Leslie Neilsen.Now for the content review.Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor throughout, some comic violence and language/UNRATED.1.  Sex/Nudity=5/10. There are still a lot of sexual jokes, but they're not funny, unlike the first two.2.  Violence/Gore=2/10. There is some violence, but it's played for laughs.3.  Language=6/10. It's far different from the first two. 2 F-words and other profanities.Final thoughts...Overall 3/5. I'm not a big fan of this movie. There are maybe ONE or TWO funny parts unlike the first two, which had you laughing throughout the entire movie. I personally think that it would have been better if it had an ""R"" rating but the people who made it were trying to reach a younger audience, which I think is pretty stupid.

We just happen to have a great appreciation for both horror films [we recently saw Wolf Creek, and George Romero is my favorite writer/director] and for slapstick comedy.Please don't see this film if you are expecting great cinematic art.  It is not meant to make a statement, or teach any lessons, or anything else socially redeeming. It is a comedy for comedy's sake.  And it will not scare you out of your wits.  Scariest thing in the whole theater that night was the price of a bucket of popcorn.

Nielsen was the only truly scary part in the film, because it is so realistic.Unlike most sequels [Jaws, Halloween, Friday the 13th, all of which go on ad nauseum] Scary Movies has improved with each incarnation.

To my surprise I was pleasantly impressed with part 4. It won't win any awards mind you, but the director/actors hit it right on the head with this installment. The one thing if nothing else keeping this film afloat is the guy spoofing Tom Cruise, he's absolutely hilarious.  ""SM4"" pokes fun at such films as ""The Grudge"", ""War Of The Worlds"", ""Brokeback Mountain""(about the only good thing to come outta that movie was this & the Oscar's parody), ""Dawn Of The Dead"", ""The Village"" & ""Saw"" to name a few.  Leslie Nielson also does a GREAT bUSH impression, honestly I think I'd feel more safe with Leslie's bush running the country rather than the real thing.  An ape apearing to be ""King Kong"" graces the cover of the DVD yet is no where to be found in the actual movie(there could maybe be something after the credits, I didn't watch that far). I watched the ""Unrated"" version & once again it's really nothing more than a marketing ploy, because there's nothing racey about this version. The cover also boasts about ""2 Hours Of Bloopers, outtakes & Deleted Scenes"", however unless there're some serious easter eggs thats just another blatent lie. So to sum it all up, this is the best ""Scary Movie"" since the first one. The movie itself is great, the rest of the DVD package, not so much, and that's why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.P.S.  I've read a couple other reveiws complaining about plot.  Honestly, if you're looking for plot or substance, you've come to the wrong place.  Anyone trying to use their brain while watching this movie obviously doesn't have one.  Just so people know this is stupid, spoof comedy, anyone looking for more should look elsewhere.

643834,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JOY9,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","First off, I have to mention how excited I was to see the 4th film of scary movie!!!! I was looking forward to seeing it, but I have to say- at the end of the movie I found myself feeling slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's an OK film, but it sadly lacked the comedy of the other 3 films. I was very pleased to see Brenda back; however, not even she could bring this up to the standards of the others.It felt as if each scene was rushed and just randomly placed together- for some reason, it didn't all seem to fit well with each other, it was like ""OK, we've done one spoof- quickly we have to do the next one"" and everything seems so rushed and unfinished.Two good aspects of this movie are the USE of parody and cameos. The parodies are done so well that you can keep track even if you haven't watched the 'original' movies yet. And the makers of this movie aren't too shy having half their cast existing out of cameos. In most movies this would fail, but for Scary Movie it does the trick. Scary Movie guarantees lots of familiar faces from movies, sports, and music industry.Some actors, who haven't had the most success in recent years, like Leslie Nielsen for example, are enjoyable in this movie. They show that with a good direction they are still funny and capable of doing comedies. The writers and producers need to ensure that the next movie (if there is to be another) is not rushed, and endeavour to produce a film that is as funny as the original and its 2 sequels. If they fail, the Scary Movie franchise may end up a parody of that other great such as Police Academy.Scary Movie 4 marks itself as a decent comedy.  There were some funny moments in here that save it from complete boredom. This movie will help you pass a few hours and serves up some slight laughs every now and then.",3,Something defiantly fell off on this one,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,1813,"['First', 'have', 'mention', 'how', 'excited', 'was', 'see', '4th', 'film', 'scary', 'movie', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'have', 'say-', 'end', 'movie', 'found', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'OK', 'film', 'sadly', 'lacked', 'comedy', 'other', '3', 'films', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'Brenda', 'back', 'however', 'not', 'even', 'could', 'bring', 'up', 'standards', 'others.It', 'felt', 'scene', 'was', 'rushed', 'just', 'randomly', 'placed', 'together-', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'all', 'seem', 'fit', 'well', 'other', 'was', 'OK', ""'ve"", 'done', 'one', 'spoof-', 'quickly', 'have', 'do', 'next', 'one', 'everything', 'so', 'rushed', 'unfinished.Two', 'good', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'USE', 'parody', 'cameos', 'parodies', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'keep', 'track', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', ""'original"", 'movies', 'yet', 'makers', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'shy', 'having', 'cast', 'existing', 'cameos', 'most', 'movies', 'would', 'fail', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'trick', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'guarantees', 'lots', 'familiar', 'movies', 'sports', 'music', 'industry.Some', 'actors', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'most', 'success', 'recent', 'years', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'example', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'show', 'good', 'direction', 'are', 'still', 'funny', 'capable', 'doing', 'comedies', 'writers', 'producers', 'need', 'ensure', 'next', 'movie', 'be', 'not', 'rushed', 'endeavour', 'produce', 'film', 'as', 'funny', 'original', '2', 'sequels', 'fail', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'parody', 'other', 'great', 'such', 'Police', 'Academy.Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'marks', 'decent', 'comedy', 'were', 'funny', 'moments', 'here', 'save', 'complete', 'boredom', 'movie', 'will', 'help', 'pass', 'few', 'hours', 'up', 'slight', 'laughs', 'now', 'then']",N/A

Scary Movie 4 still offers a laugh here and there though. The cast isn't bad too. You have Bill Pullman who is the only person who's actually in one of the movies being made fun of. I guess he even knows that the Grudge sucked lol. Still the guy deserves better, ID4 2 anyone ? lol. He gets a laugh or two. While the brief Brokeback Mountain scene with Anthony Anderson is funny too. Regina Hall who dies in every one except the even numbered films is back yet again and gets some laughs too. Especially in the scenes that are like Saw and the Village.Plus Michael Madsen isn't bad in a brief appearance as the Tim Robbins character in War of  the Worlds as well. I admit I expected more laughs from the reliably funny Leslie Nielson though. Here his President character just rambles on and on about a duck in a story little kids were reading him. Chris Elliot and even Carmen Electra get some laughs in the Village scenes though as the crazy retarded guy and the blind woman.While Anna Faris is a good sport as always and is great at poking fun at herself. She's adorable and one of the funniest women in comedies today. Still though I think she got more laughs in the other films because she had better material. Here the script is the biggest mess of all and is just all over the place. Plus the other films had better horror films to make fun. I mean the Village and Grudge weren't even that good in the first place. I'd like to see a Scary Movie film make fun of a Final Destination film for once. That might actually be funny. I'm sure they could have fun with Cindy having a vision of deaths plan and Anna Faris could probably pull it off pretty funny too.

643849,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JOY9,Kaya Savas,"[12, 16]","MOVIE:  The Scary Movie franchise has been a huge money maker ever since the Wayans brothers started it. David Zucker took over the series after the Wayans left and made Scary Movie 3. He returns to the series with Scary Movie 4, and while it misses the mark it still is pretty enjoyable. For those who don't know David Zucker, he is the king of spoofs.  He made Airplane, The Naked Gun series, Top Secret, and other great spoofs. He consistantly works with Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft, who have brought us other great spoofs such as Hot Shots, Wrongfully Accused, Jane Austen's Mafia, and others. His brother Jerry Zucker who has done a few serious movies is also the man behind Rat Race. So between these guys we have some hilarious and brilliant movie spoofs. Scary Movie is the perfect franchise for these guys, but in a way it's too much for them to handle. What makes a spoof work is all about the timing, the jokes have to be placed in the right places and have to hit at the right moment. Scary Movie 3 was really funny because it had somewhat of a plot. This movie is just joke after joke, with no plot at all.  Sure, you don't see these movies for the plot, but in order to have a spoof you need one.  The problem with these movies is that they tackle every single film in the genre, while previous spoof movies they made focused on one movie alone. Hot Shots spoofed Top Gun, the second Hot Shots spoofed Rambo, Airplane spoofed Airport, Wrongfully Accused spoofed The Fugitive, Naked Gun spoofed police dramas, and Mafia spoofed The Godfather and Casino. All those movies were very focused. With Scary Movie 4 we jump from tons of different horror movies, some not even horror. This particular installment sends up Brokeback Mountain, Million Dollar Baby, Saw, War Of The Worlds, The Grudge, and a bunch of pop culture thrown into the mix. There are a few jokes that hit the right spot, but it feels disorganized, and when that happens things aren't funny. Comedy is the hardest thing to write, but I've come to expect more from these veterans. Good for a laugh, but will never stand with the other great spoofs they have done. This Scary Movie rarely hits the mark when it needs to, not as sharp as the last one.ACTING:  Anna Faris continues her role as Cindy Campbell and she is just perfect for the role. By taking everything seriously she makes the jokes work. We lose Charlie Sheen as a main character, which is a shame (even though he's in here as a cameo). Charlie Sheen was the funniest part of Scary Movie 3, instead we have Tom Ryan played by Craig Bierko. His Tom Cruise impersonation is spot on, and he's pretty good. There are plenty of cameos for the whole family, one of which is Bill Pullman. I found it incredibly hilarious that he is in this movie spoofing The Grude since he was actually in The Grudge. Of course you have Leslie Nielson, who is probably one of the greatest comedic actors ever. The whole cast is great, but the film's structure doesn't allow them to really be funny.BOTTOM LINE: The movie is funny, you will laugh. You won't laugh as much or as hard as you did with the previous Scary Movies, but still it's funny. The crazy plot is where the problem lies, and that results in bad timing for the jokes. It's not as clever as it should be considering it comes from Zucker and Abrahams.",3,"Some Funny Stuff From Zucker & The Gang, But A Lot Of It Falls Flat",1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,3331,"['MOVIE', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'been', 'huge', 'money', 'maker', 'ever', 'Wayans', 'brothers', 'started', 'David', 'Zucker', 'took', 'over', 'series', 'Wayans', 'left', 'made', 'Scary', 'Movie', '3', 'series', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'mark', 'still', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'David', 'Zucker', 'king', 'spoofs', 'made', 'Airplane', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'series', 'Top', 'Secret', 'other', 'great', 'spoofs', 'consistantly', 'Jim', 'Abrahams', 'Pat', 'Proft', 'who', 'have', 'brought', 'other', 'great', 'spoofs', 'such', 'Hot', 'Shots', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Mafia', 'others', 'brother', 'Jerry', 'Zucker', 'who', 'done', 'few', 'serious', 'movies', 'also', 'man', 'Rat', 'Race', 'So', 'guys', 'have', 'hilarious', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'spoofs', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'perfect', 'franchise', 'guys', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'What', 'spoof', 'work', 'timing', 'jokes', 'have', 'be', 'placed', 'right', 'places', 'have', 'hit', 'right', 'moment', 'Scary', 'Movie', '3', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'had', 'somewhat', 'plot', 'movie', 'just', 'joke', 'joke', 'plot', 'Sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movies', 'plot', 'order', 'have', 'spoof', 'need', 'one', 'problem', 'movies', 'tackle', 'single', 'film', 'genre', 'previous', 'spoof', 'movies', 'made', 'focused', 'one', 'movie', 'alone', 'Hot', 'Shots', 'spoofed', 'Top', 'Gun', 'second', 'Hot', 'Shots', 'spoofed', 'Rambo', 'Airplane', 'spoofed', 'Airport', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'spoofed', 'Fugitive', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'spoofed', 'police', 'dramas', 'Mafia', 'spoofed', 'Godfather', 'Casino', 'movies', 'were', 'very', 'focused', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'jump', 'tons', 'different', 'horror', 'movies', 'not', 'even', 'horror', 'particular', 'installment', 'up', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Saw', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Grudge', 'bunch', 'pop', 'culture', 'thrown', 'mix', 'are', 'few', 'jokes', 'hit', 'right', 'spot', 'disorganized', 'when', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Comedy', 'hardest', 'thing', 'write', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'more', 'veterans', 'Good', 'laugh', 'will', 'never', 'stand', 'other', 'great', 'spoofs', 'have', 'done', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'rarely', 'mark', 'when', 'not', 'as', 'sharp', 'last', 'one.ACTING', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'role', 'Cindy', 'Campbell', 'just', 'perfect', 'role', 'taking', 'everything', 'seriously', 'jokes', 'work', 'lose', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'main', 'character', 'shame', 'even', 'here', 'cameo', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'was', 'funniest', 'part', 'Scary', 'Movie', '3', 'instead', 'have', 'Tom', 'Ryan', 'played', 'Craig', 'Bierko', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'impersonation', 'spot', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'plenty', 'cameos', 'whole', 'family', 'one', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'found', 'incredibly', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'spoofing', 'Grude', 'was', 'actually', 'Grudge', 'course', 'have', 'Leslie', 'Nielson', 'who', 'probably', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedic', 'actors', 'ever', 'whole', 'cast', 'great', 'film', 'structure', ""n't"", 'allow', 'really', 'be', 'funny.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'movie', 'funny', 'will', 'laugh', 'wo', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'hard', 'did', 'previous', 'Scary', 'Movies', 'still', 'funny', 'crazy', 'plot', 'where', 'problem', 'results', 'bad', 'timing', 'jokes', 'not', 'as', 'clever', 'should', 'be', 'considering', 'Zucker', 'Abrahams']",N/A

The SCARY MOVIE franchise (named after the real working title for SCREAM) delivers the same MAD Magazine-style spoof , again and again. Now proving how successful this horror-satire genre is by exceeding the 3-film mark, this one maybe the best of the lot (so far).David Zucker directs this one with story by Craig Mazin, who co-wrote on previous films.Although conspicuously absent are Shawn and Marlon Wayans (as writers and characters), but on the plus side, Leslie Nielsen returns as President Harris, Y-E-S! (Don't spell in front of me!) Other returning survivor/regulars are: Anna Faris (Cindy), Regina Hall (Brenda), Simon Rex (George) and Anthony Anderson (Mahalik).

643856,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JOY9,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","""Scary Movie 4"" is getting dangerously close to that dreaded territory where if you have seen the trailer you have seen all of the good parts of the movie.  Just as the trailer indicates, this 2006 comedy brings together parodies of ""Saw,"" ""The War of the Worlds,"" ""The Grudge,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""The Village,"" and ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" and one of the things I actually liked about the film was how there is an actual narrative framework provided from the way these are put together.  But then we get around to doing the parodies of the films and that is where the proceedings begin to loose steam, go down hill, jump the shark, and otherwise start stinking up the place.We begin with Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil playing out the ""Saw"" game, the abridged version of which is in the trailer and commercials, and then get to Craig Bierko as Tom Ryan in ""The War of the Worlds"" storyline and Anna Faris back again as Cindy Campbell in ""The Grudge"" part of the proceedings.  From her time in ""The War of the Worlds"" she hooks up again with Brenda (Regina Hall) and they get sidetracked in ""The Village.""  But when you are playing with a Steven Spielberg movie that gets to be your template and we are back for that at the end with ""Oprah"" providing the epilogue.  ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a brief seque for Anthony Anderson as Mahalik and Kevin Hart as CJ, although their bit in the bar that is a parody of nothing as near as I can tell is a whole lot funnier.  Aye, there's the rub.If you have not seen all of the movies in question then our ability to identify, let alone appreciate, the parodies in question is clearly in doubt.  Too many of the jokes are funny only in the context of these parodies and not on their own merit.  This comedy is directed by David Zucker, which simply underscores why this movies is not as funny as you would think that it should be.  The first film that Zucker directed was ""Airplane!"", which remains for my limited amount of money the funniest movie of all-time (defined operationally by how many times it made me laugh).  That was a take-off on airplane disaster movies without engaging in wall-to-wall parodies of specific films.  Yes, there are moments that remind us of ""Airport"" and ""The High and the Mighty,"" not to mention ""Saturday Night Fever,"" but Barbara Billingsley speaking jive, Peter Graves discussing gladiator movies with the young boy in the cockpit, and whatever Stephen Stucker is up to throughout the film, have nothing to do with parodies and they are all hysterical moments.Watching Carmen Electra as the blind Holly have an extremely noisy bowel movement in public is not something I would consider hysterical, but actually she has a better part in the movie than Chris Elliott, who is totally wasted as Ezekiel in this film.  The same can be said for the character played by Michael Madsen, from whom I would expect a lot more than what the screenplay by Craig Mazin, Jim Abrahams, and Pat Proft, not from the main movies that are the targets here but some of Madsen's choice roles from the likes of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Kill Bill, Volume 2.""

The third one was kind of funny, but for the most part, they are pretty useless pieces of film.  Good for a few cheap laughs, I grant you, but otherwise forgettable.  The fourth one is of about the same quality of the third one (although notably lacking the Jenny Mcarthy factor) and starts off well, with Dr. Phil and Shaquille O'Neil (is he Irish?) chained to one another in a deathtrap, ala ""Saw.""  Humour ensues, as Dr. Phil makes fun of his television persona and Shaq makes fun of the fact that he is not very good at making free throws.  The movie quickly turns its focus to two main characters which I would normally say the names of except for the fact that their names are so unimportant that it doesn't matter.  Suffice to say, the lady is the same lady that has been in every Scary Movie so far except that now she is blonde and the guy is some jabroni who you've never seen before and will probably never see again.  Blonde Lady is involved in a parody of ""The Grudge"", a very decent Japanese Horror film that got the US remake treatment last year.  Forgettable guy is involved in a parody of ""War of the Worlds"", another recent remake.  It's pretty predictable from there--aliens invade, people die, and people hit themselves in the head.  Just for good measure, Blonde Lady goes off with her rather randy female friend into a parody of ""The Village"" and more hilarity results.  At the end, Forgettable Guy makes like Tom Cruise and jumps on Oprah Winfrey's couch.The important question--is it funny?  Well, there is a bit of inspired casting with Leslie Nielsen as a G.W. Bush-esque president and I always like to see people make fun of ""The Village"", but ultimately it is pretty much like a Mad Magazine article.  If you are willing to pay $10 to see people say wacky things and get hit in the testicular region, this movie is for you.  Otherwise, it is probably safe for a video rental or, best yet--skip it.In honor of Joe Bob Briggs, here are the drive-in movie totals: innumerable dead bodies, one nude Lesley Nielsen (covered) and multiple nude ambassadors to the United Nations (also, thankfully covered), two monsters (fake).

Handfield ""madcartoonist""","[2, 3]","Those of you hoping for big laughs like scary movie 3 gave will be greatly disappointed, the gags are stale, the delivery of jokes is off and leslie neilson just isn't funny anymore. Some of the actual films scary movie 4 spoofs are the obvious War of the Worlds, Saw and the Grudge plus other films The Village, Brokeback Mountain and even Million Dollar Baby.  I think that Proft, Zucker and Abrahams dropped the ball there with the original idea that the Wayans brothers had to spoof just horror or thriller films. Even in Scary Movie Three they spoofed 8 Mile, The Matrix although funny, inconsistant with the original formula.  Some of the Dialogue was tired as well, especially when anna faris says she saw some Pictures of Bill Pullmans character in which he replies, 'I was young I needed the work' same dialogue used in the Naked gun between Priscilla Presley and Leslie Neilson.However the biggest jab in the film was at President Bush when leslie Neilson as the President learns that the world is under attack by aliens, he is seated in front of a grade school class and just sits there more concerned about the story being read aloud by one of the students.  Well done.  When I say some of the gags are stale they're really stale, Like Carmen Electra as the blind girl from the Village sitting on an open storage bench Going to the bathroom, with about twenty seconds of gratuitious Flatulance, done better in other films like Not another Teen Movie and Harold and Kumar go to WhiteCastle. Scary Movie 4 also seems to capitolize on  something they did in Scary Movie 3...accidental clumsy personal injury. People bumping their heads repeatedly in the same place. Various objects falling on people, People getting hit by cars and doors.  All that is repeated in SM4 and goes overboard.  This Movie does have some laughs, like the opening sequence with Shaquille O'neal and Dr. Phil...thats funny. But the rest of the film the laughs are few and far between.Anna Faris reprises her role as Cindy Campbell..always a pleasure. and Regina Hall is back as Brenda even though her character keeps dying in each film. I just hope this writing team doesn't have any plans for a fifth installment.Bottom Line.......Frankly I was bored with it, the laughs didn't come fast enough or at all.

This time around, it was The Grudge, Saw, The Village, War of the Worlds (even though it's more sci-fi than horror), etc...The formula is wearing a bit thin by now. There are some decent laughs sprinkled in there, but for the most part the movie falls flat. Some of the scenes that were intended to be funny end up being dragged out for too long and basically just not being all that funny to begin with. Leslie Nielson is a bright spot in the cast with his role as the US President, but it does little to lift the status of the movie, overall.

I think the only one that I remember being pretty obvious were the tentacles, but I didn't really care since the movie is just about the humor and not the CG shots.The sound track adds to the parody of the movie, and gets some laughs and does its job. Sound effects are just as funny as the other films. The acting is great, and you know these people like doing humor and are good at it.

The opening, a parody of Saw with Dr. Phil and Shaq, is the funniest bit - and probably one of the funniest things Zucker's done in years.  From there, the film is a little light on laughs.  Parodies are mostly of Saw, War of the Worlds, the Grudge, and the Village.  SM4s greatest asset is the casting.  Leslie Nielson has a great moment as the bumbling president and Craig Bierko is almost more convincing as Tom Cruise than the real Tom Cruise is.  Kudos are also in order for Chris Elliot as the Village Idiot (Isn't it obvious?).  It's stated on the disc that Zucker has rules for spoofing.  Unfortunately, the rules are probalby a little dusty, as the formula is getting old, and most of the gags are too dated, obvious, or knee deep in vulgarity.  If the franchise is to continue (and as long as Hollywood keeps churning out horror movies of the week, it will), then there needs to be a better formula.

Either that's 100% percent made up, or the person who said it is the biggest schmuck of a film critic working today.  I had a very difficult time getting through this film, which is strange considering we're dealing with Zucker/Abrahms/Proft, who were a big part of the team that gave us The Naked Gun.  They must really be out of ideas or the standards of the comedygoing audience have gone wayyyyyyy down.  When Zucker took over on Scary Movie 3, he made a pretty clever and often very funny spoof.  This time it's obvious it was strictly a case of a film being needed, quickly done and delivered without any care put into it at all.  And don't be fooled by the whole ""Unrated and Uncensored"" b.s. on the box.  Like any movie nowdays that carries that label, it's all a lousy ploy to sell the film, coz there is absolutely nothing in this film that doesn't qualify for a PG-13 and couldn't have been shown in theaters.  About 90% of the attempts at humor in this film consist of the Looney Tunes school of flying objects hitting someone in the head, people running into walls, bumping their heads, getting punched, getting hit by cars, doors, lightning, etc.  This works well in the Looney Tunes world, but translates to extremely unfunny in the live action world, especially when it's done over and over and over and over and over and over and over.  I really wanted to throw in the towel at about 40 minutes, but I stuck with it merely coz I had to kill time before 4am when McDonalds started serving breakfast.  Now, when dealing with a spoof film that's rapid fire gag-a-second type pace, you'd expect a few laughs.  After all, with a movie jammed packed with gags, it's only logical a few will hit home.  With Scary Movie 4, it's a chuckle at best, and the chuckles are provided mainly from Leslie Nielsen(of course), Michael Madsen and Bill Pullman.  I can't recall one laugh-out-loud moment in this film.  I recall alot of groans though.  And that actress who playes the leading lady, as she tends to in all these films(I don't even bother myself with finding out what her name is) is probably the most grating, annoying and untalented actress I have ever seen.  Why do they keep putting her in these films?  She only exists as the recipient of the jokes/abuse in the films and she can't even do that right.  Anyhow, I really gotta say this series is dead, dead, DEAD!  Go ahead and watch at your own risk, coz everyone's idea of what's funny and what's not is different, but I do think most folks are on the same page when it comes to what a turd smells like.",1,About Time To Hang It Up,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2625,"['quote', 'box', 'best', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'yet', '100', '%', 'percent', 'made', 'up', 'person', 'who', 'said', 'biggest', 'schmuck', 'film', 'critic', 'working', 'today', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'getting', 'film', 'strange', 'considering', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'Zucker/Abrahms/Proft', 'who', 'were', 'big', 'part', 'team', 'gave', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'must', 'really', 'be', 'ideas', 'standards', 'comedygoing', 'audience', 'have', 'gone', 'wayyyyyyy', 'down', 'When', 'Zucker', 'took', 'over', 'Scary', 'Movie', '3', 'made', 'pretty', 'clever', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'spoof', 'time', 'obvious', 'was', 'strictly', 'case', 'film', 'being', 'needed', 'quickly', 'done', 'delivered', 'care', 'put', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'whole', 'Unrated', 'Uncensored', 'b.s', 'box', 'movie', 'label', 'lousy', 'ploy', 'sell', 'film', 'coz', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'PG-13', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'theaters', '90', '%', 'attempts', 'humor', 'film', 'consist', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'school', 'flying', 'objects', 'hitting', 'someone', 'head', 'people', 'running', 'walls', 'bumping', 'heads', 'getting', 'punched', 'getting', 'hit', 'cars', 'doors', 'lightning', 'etc', 'well', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'world', 'extremely', 'unfunny', 'live', 'action', 'world', 'especially', 'when', 'done', 'really', 'wanted', 'throw', 'towel', '40', 'minutes', 'stuck', 'merely', 'coz', 'had', 'kill', 'time', '4am', 'when', 'McDonalds', 'started', 'serving', 'breakfast', 'Now', 'when', 'dealing', 'spoof', 'film', 'rapid', 'fire', 'gag-a-second', 'type', 'pace', ""'d"", 'expect', 'few', 'laughs', 'movie', 'jammed', 'packed', 'gags', 'only', 'logical', 'few', 'will', 'hit', 'home', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'chuckle', 'best', 'chuckles', 'are', 'provided', 'mainly', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'course', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'one', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moment', 'film', 'recall', 'alot', 'groans', 'actress', 'who', 'leading', 'lady', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'name', 'probably', 'most', 'grating', 'annoying', 'untalented', 'actress', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Why', 'do', 'keep', 'putting', 'films', 'only', 'recipient', 'jokes/abuse', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'right', 'Anyhow', 'really', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'series', 'dead', 'dead', 'DEAD', 'Go', 'ahead', 'watch', 'own', 'risk', 'coz', 'everyone', 'idea', 'what', 'funny', 'what', 'not', 'different', 'do', 'think', 'most', 'folks', 'are', 'same', 'page', 'when', 'what', 'turd', 'smells']",N/A

643893,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00005JOY9,Terry Mesnard,"[2, 2]","Scary Movie has always been a series that's easy to criticise.  The first one basically took the plot and, at times, the dialogue from Scream and made a parody of it.  However, created by the Wayan family, it was generally funny.  The sequel wasn't quite as good.  When Zucker came along for the third one, the whole tone and feeling for the movie changed.  It became an Airplane! or Hot Shots movie, rated at PG-13.  Great for marketing, but for those of us who want more than pratfalls, it fell a bit short.So now we have Scary Movie 4.  I really liked some of the movies they were lampooning so I figured I would get at least some enjoyment out of it.  There are maybe three truly inspired scenes in the movie.  By far the best is Leslie Nielson's scene as the president being read to by elementary children.  That scene is priceless.  The opening scene involving the first Saw was also quite humorous.  Also, some of the sequences involving The Grudge at the beginning were humorous as well.For me, there were two large problems.  The first is that the movie felt like a bunch of skits, loosely tied together with a semblance of a plot.  What worked structurally for the first two scary movies was that they mostly had one movie as their basis.  Scary Movie 4 felt as if they were trying to lampoon everything and it became really disjointed.  I hate to use this example because it's been used in countless reviews, but if the shoe fits...the movie felt like a Saturday Night Live episode with skits of varying humor.  Didn't feel like a movie.The other problem was that Zucker doesn't know when to stop a joke.  An instance is when Tom Ryan shoots the gun into the sky and a hang-glider crashes and says ""Why?""  It was a very funny non sequitar.  Then, it gets smashed into the ground as he is then shot with a crossbow as he's getting up.  Similar jokes abound and then are pushed into the ground to the point that they aren't funny anymore.In the end, Scary Movie 4 felt a lot longer than the supposed 83 minutes time.  It was a better effort than the third movie, however the reliance on pratfalls and [...] jokes and jokes that had been done many times before in he 80s when these types of movies reigned holds it back.  Instead of making a comment on the horror films of today, Zucker is more interested in having Dr. Phill hit over the head three times with various lamps and pipes.  Funny in small doses, as a feature film I was disappointed.",3,"Better than the third one, still not great",1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,2454,"['Scary', 'Movie', 'always', 'been', 'series', 'easy', 'criticise', 'first', 'one', 'basically', 'took', 'plot', 'times', 'dialogue', 'Scream', 'made', 'parody', 'However', 'created', 'Wayan', 'family', 'was', 'generally', 'funny', 'sequel', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'When', 'Zucker', 'came', 'along', 'third', 'one', 'whole', 'tone', 'feeling', 'movie', 'changed', 'became', 'Airplane', 'Hot', 'Shots', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Great', 'marketing', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'pratfalls', 'fell', 'bit', 'short.So', 'now', 'have', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'really', 'liked', 'movies', 'were', 'lampooning', 'so', 'figured', 'would', 'get', 'least', 'enjoyment', 'are', 'maybe', 'three', 'truly', 'inspired', 'scenes', 'movie', 'far', 'best', 'Leslie', 'Nielson', 'scene', 'president', 'being', 'read', 'elementary', 'children', 'scene', 'priceless', 'opening', 'scene', 'involving', 'first', 'Saw', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'humorous', 'Also', 'sequences', 'involving', 'Grudge', 'beginning', 'were', 'humorous', 'well.For', 'were', 'two', 'large', 'problems', 'first', 'movie', 'felt', 'bunch', 'skits', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'semblance', 'plot', 'What', 'worked', 'structurally', 'first', 'two', 'scary', 'movies', 'was', 'mostly', 'had', 'one', 'movie', 'basis', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'felt', 'were', 'trying', 'lampoon', 'everything', 'became', 'really', 'disjointed', 'hate', 'use', 'example', 'been', 'used', 'countless', 'reviews', 'shoe', 'fits', 'movie', 'felt', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'episode', 'skits', 'varying', 'humor', 'Did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie.The', 'other', 'problem', 'was', 'Zucker', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'joke', 'instance', 'when', 'Tom', 'Ryan', 'shoots', 'gun', 'sky', 'hang-glider', 'crashes', 'Why', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'non', 'sequitar', 'Then', 'smashed', 'ground', 'then', 'shot', 'crossbow', 'getting', 'up', 'Similar', 'jokes', 'abound', 'then', 'are', 'pushed', 'ground', 'point', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'anymore.In', 'end', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'felt', 'lot', 'longer', 'supposed', '83', 'minutes', 'time', 'was', 'better', 'effort', 'third', 'movie', 'however', 'reliance', 'pratfalls', '[', ']', 'jokes', 'jokes', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'before', '80s', 'when', 'types', 'movies', 'reigned', 'back', 'Instead', 'making', 'comment', 'horror', 'films', 'today', 'Zucker', 'more', 'interested', 'having', 'Dr.', 'Phill', 'hit', 'head', 'three', 'times', 'various', 'lamps', 'pipes', 'Funny', 'small', 'doses', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'disappointed']",N/A

With each installment, creativity diminishes, box office falls and returning actors salaries increase. So why do the studios continue to make them? A ""2"" or ""3"" will attract a certain number of people, guaranteeing a predictable amount of box office, therefore sequels are safer bets. And that is a sad, sad truth preventing a lot of potentially great films from an audience. Yes, there are sequels that are better than the original, but they are few and far between.Then there is the ""Scary Movie"" franchise. Remarkably consistent at the box office, and no doubt fairly inexpensive to produce, Dimension Films has just released ""4"".A little history before we begin: ""Scary Movie"", directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, starring Anna Faris, Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans is basically an excuse for a series of gags and parodies based on popular horror films. ""Scary Movie"" is also a parody of the same studios ""Scream"" franchise, which is fairly brilliant in a way. Capture the same audience twice, once for screams, the second for laughs. ""Movie"" made a lot of money and caused the inevitable sequel. ""2"" was not as funny, but still made a lot of money. Either Keenan Ivory Wayans wanted a lot of money or the studio realized ""2"" was lacking (I suspect the former) because David Zucker (part of the ""Airplane"" and ""Police Squad"" team) was brought in to helm ""3"". Ready to give up on the series, I gave ""3"" a try because of Zucker and I was pleasantly surprised. It was funny. Expanding the scope to include sci-fi (""Signs"") and superheroes (""X-Men"") and adding Leslie Nielsen to the cast proved to be the right move. Now, we have ""4"", directed by David Zucker and starring Anna Faris and Leslie Nielsen, with cameos by Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Bill Pullman and others.The ""Scary Movie"" series exists for no other reason than to make the audience laugh. Using the same formula, a series of gags and parodies are held together by the smallest thread of a plot. The success of these films is determined by how much and how often we laugh. ""4"" caused me to chuckle a bit, but the outrageous belly laughs weren't there. Some of the parodies fall completely flat, which is to be expected, but when there are no great laughs to compensate, the problems really stand out. Many of the parodies also take the safe route, leading to easy, expected laughs. In short, ""4"" doesn't deliver.Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) takes a job caring for an elderly, catatonic woman (Cloris Leachman). She soon believes the house to be haunted by a little Japanese boy who makes cat-like sounds. She meets the next door neighbor, Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) and there is an instant attraction. Tom is a dockworker who has his two kids for the weekend and they are none too happy to be stuck in their dad's dingy one-bedroom apartment. This is also the same weekend Aliens attack. Cindy sets off to find out who killed the little boy and Tom begins a journey to get his kids to safety. They promise to meet up and live the rest of their lives happily together.If the description you have just read sounds a lot like ""War of The Worlds"" combined with ""The Grudge"", you are correct. The two stories combined provide the backdrop for all of the parodies and jokes. A prologue featuring Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil McGraw outwitting the villain from ""Saw"" provides an amusing tone to start the film. But as the film continues, the humor becomes much more hit and miss. The funniest bit involves Carmen Electra playing the blind girl from ""The Village"". Because this bit is based on scatological humor, you begin to get an idea of the level of laughs you should expect. Not that there is anything wrong with a little gross out humor. But when it is all there is, something is wrong. Clouds look like they are farting lightning, a sponge bath is given from a dirty bed pan. You get the idea.These films owe a lot to director M. Night Shyamalan. All of his films have been made fun of in one or more of the installments. I guess ""5"" will have a parody of Shyamalan's new film about mermaids, ""Lady in the Water"".They even manage to work in jokes about ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" (amusing) and ""Hustle and Flow"". The ""Hustle"" reference is so quick it leads me to believe even the filmmakers knew it wasn't going to work. When you see what they left in, you will realize just how bad this parody is and imagine how bad something must have been to be cut. Boggles the mind. Where was the take-off on ""King Kong""? He is clearly featured in the newspaper ads, yet I didn't see him.Many of the jokes also take the safe route. A parody of Tom Cruise's appearance on ""Oprah"" could have been brilliant, but doesn't really do anything new with the joke except to recreate the appearance in an exaggerated way. The ""Brokeback Mountain"" gag plays it safe as well. There is so much they could've done, so many possibilities.One of the best things about the ""Movie"" series is how good the actual parodies look. Each joke seems as though it was shot on the same set as the actual film, using the same props, special effects, production design. The tripods and Tom Cruise's neighborhood from ""War of the Worlds"" appear to have been teleported into the new comedy. The little boy from ""The Grudge"" made a wrong turn in a closet somewhere and ended up here. Throughout the series, this is the one area which remains consistent. Either the filmmakers spent a lot of time copying the look and feel of the other film, or the original filmmakers provided assistance to the ""Scary Movie"" teams, helping them to get everything very close. I imagine it was a combination of both.",2,Hang It Up!,1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,5694,"['Sequels', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'case', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'installment', 'creativity',

643898,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JOY9,Tom Benton,"[2, 3]","I'll be frank: I love David Zucker's films.  He's the guy responsible for such contemporary comedy classics as AIRPLANE! and THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD!.  When I learned that he was taking over the SCARY MOVIE franchise from the Wayans brothers, and bringing over his writing crew (Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft), I was overjoyed.  And, apparently, not without reason.  The SCARY MOVIE trilogy has become overrun by the silly slapstick humor and deadpan jokes which made THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE! so very enjoyable.SCARY MOVIE 4 spoofs everything and everyone.  There's a very funny opening sequence with Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil (as themselves), which parodies SAW.  The plot is a send-up of WAR OF THE WORLDS.  There's countless other films spoofed as well, including THE VILLAGE and THE GRUDGE.  But there's more than that - SCARY MOVIE 4 has its share of satire as well.  For example, the U.S. president (portrayed by the great Leslie Nielsen) hangs around to hear a children's story while the world becomes overrun by alien invaders.  In reality, our president did the same during the 9/11 attacks.  In the over-the-top closing, Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) demonstrates that he is truly head-over-heels in love with Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris); this spoofs the now-famous incident in which Tom Cruise announced his love for Katie Holmes on Oprah Winfrey's show.Zucker hasn't lost his touch.  As in his aforementioned films, Zucker manages to get every member of the cast to deliver perfectly straight-faced performances, even when their lines or actions are outrageously silly.  The script is, for the most part, quite funny, although the jokes are hit or miss.  I'm inclined to believe that the failed jokes came from Craig Mazin, whose comedy writing resume is hardly as impressive as that of co-writers Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft.The cast is wonderful.  Anna Faris is still as funny as ever.  Craig Bierko, a newcomer to the series, is quite funny as well.  Leslie Nielsen is, as always, extremely funny.  There's also appearances from Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart, reprising their roles from SCARY MOVIE 3; Regina Hall, reprising her role from SCARY MOVIE 2; James Earl Jones, who narrates the WAR OF THE WORLDS sequences and makes a brief on-screen appearance; Michael Madsen, sending up Tim Robbins' character from WAR OF THE WORLDS; Bill Pullman; Charlie Sheen; Carmen Electra; and numerous others.  They're all great.  The cast really brings the film to life and makes it as funny as it is.I went into the theater expecting to see a silly, brainless, but fun film, and that's what I got.

643899,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JOY9,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Scary Movie"" franchise still goes on, with lots of parodies about the recent hit movies such as ""War of the Worlds"" ""SAW"" ""The Village"" and ""The Grudge."" David Zucker who also helmed the second sequel ""Scary Movie 3"" throws in lots of gags with his trademark zany humor. He just cannot sit still behind the camera. He is always trying to find something to joke about and the results are hit-and-miss.Each gag or parody should be seen for yourself. Some are very funny, some unfunny and misguided, and all in all, well, just good. One sad thing for me is that the glorious days of comedies in the 1980s like ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" are gone. Funny as they are, the gags of ""Scary Movie 4"" still look repetitious and predictable for the fans like me who have seen these classics 20 years ago.Maybe the filmmakers should have chosen some other materials for parody. The combined story of sci-fi big budget ""War of the Worlds"" and Japanese horror remake ""The Grudge"" is not likely to work, so are the occasional flashbacks that are inserted for the sole purpose of introducing another parody of ""Million Dollar Baby"" and others. Or maybe some jokes are not just funny when a little girl (spoof of Dakota Fanning's screaming girl in ""WOTW"") is forced to suffer numerous painful experiences repeatedly. Or just maybe, Charlie Sheen (who appears as cameo here) should be in the lead instead of Craig Bierko, who is, I think, miscast as ""Tom Ryan.""The film makes fun of at least three internationally famous people - Michael Jackson, Tom Cruise, and President of the United States of America (the last one done by Leslie Nielsen). I don't say it's not funny - yes, I laughed, I admit - but the targets are too familiar and the jokes are too obvious. The many cameos (including James Earl Jones, Doctor Phil McGraw and many others) are surely interesting to see, but some originality in the plot or humor would not hurt.I really like comedies of David Zucker and Jim Abrahams, and lovely Anna Faris who has returned to the film as ""Cindy."" She shows her comedic talent again, and the film is benefited from its surprisingly good (and costly) production designs and special effects for this genre. What it needs is the laughs up to the standard of the past masterpieces.",3,"Hit and Miss Comedy, Just Average",1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,2269,"['Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'still', 'lots', 'parodies', 'recent', 'hit', 'movies', 'such', 'War', 'Worlds', 'SAW', 'Village', 'Grudge', 'David', 'Zucker', 'who', 'also', 'helmed', 'second', 'sequel', 'Scary', 'Movie', '3', 'throws', 'lots', 'gags', 'trademark', 'zany', 'humor', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'sit', 'still', 'camera', 'always', 'trying', 'find', 'something', 'joke', 'results', 'are', 'hit-and-miss.Each', 'gag', 'parody', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'unfunny', 'misguided', 'well', 'just', 'good', 'One', 'sad', 'thing', 'glorious', 'days', 'comedies', '1980s', 'Airplane', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'are', 'gone', 'Funny', 'are', 'gags', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'still', 'look', 'repetitious', 'predictable', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'classics', '20', 'years', 'ago.Maybe', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'other', 'materials', 'parody', 'combined', 'story', 'sci-fi', 'big', 'budget', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'remake', 'Grudge', 'not', 'likely', 'work', 'so', 'are', 'occasional', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'inserted', 'sole', 'purpose', 'introducing', 'parody', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'others', 'maybe', 'jokes', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'funny', 'when', 'little', 'girl', 'spoof', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'screaming', 'girl', 'WOTW', 'forced', 'suffer', 'numerous', 'painful', 'experiences', 'repeatedly', 'just', 'maybe', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'who', 'cameo', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'lead', 'instead', 'Craig', 'Bierko', 'who', 'think', 'miscast', 'Tom', 'Ryan', 'film', 'fun', 'least', 'three', 'internationally', 'famous', 'people', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'last', 'one', 'done', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'funny', 'yes', 'laughed', 'admit', 'targets', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'jokes', 'are', 'too', 'obvious', 'many', 'cameos', 'including', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Doctor', 'Phil', 'McGraw', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'surely', 'interesting', 'see', 'originality', 'plot', 'humor', 'would', 'not', 'hurt.I', 'really', 'like', 'comedies', 'David', 'Zucker', 'Jim', 'Abrahams', 'lovely', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'who', 'returned', 'film', 'Cindy', 'comedic', 'talent', 'again', 'film', 'benefited', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'costly', 'production', 'designs', 'special', 'effects', 'genre', 'What', 'laughs', 'up', 'standard', 'past', 'masterpieces']",N/A
