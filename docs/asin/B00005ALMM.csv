It is just way to long. The pace is so slow it almost feels that you could live through the time periods sooner than finsh this film.  It could have been alot better and shorter.

It's really three stories in one as the film deals with the events of 4 generations of a high middle class family of Jewish Hungarians as they live through the Hapsburg empire, its fall in WW1, the Nazi perios, the Communist period and beyond the 1956 soviet Invasion.  fiennes plays the first born heir in each generation.  There are plenty of history lessons and even a well built sequence of scenes involving fencing. As the film becomes engrossed in the Nazi era - as well as other parts - the film deals with anti-semitism; however, it's not the Speolberg shove down your throat kind of depoction.  It's more subtle and far more effective as it emphasises the common humanity that this family shared with the rest of the world.  Underscorimng the beauty of the film and the story is the poignant music of Schubert's Fantasia for 2 pianos which is amsot a family songs as its members all play the piano.  I advise it's not a happy film, but it is ultimately optimistic.

They look a bit simplistic now but remain intense and entertaining. His new offering, Sunshine could not be called entertaining, it's rarely intense and the level of idiosyncrasy is too high for any European. Maybe it helps someone outside of our historical tradition to understand the basic outline of the Hungary's 20th century, but we, the Europeans, were told so many times before that communism is bad, fascism is bad, secret police are bad, betrayal is bad, we hardly heed this reminder.The film is very similar in attitude to Nikita Mikhalkov's Oscar winner Burnt By The Sun - the export variant of a gloomy period in Russian history.Sunshine is shot like an oversized educational reel in The People's History style, with lyrical insertions and human dramas to wash down the message more easily. The tone is very didactic and it's a bit annoying to hear the things we already know being told in such revelatory and self-important manner.The actors are adequate but I was not struck by anyone's artistic breakthrough. Good, but not particularly memorable.

577390,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00005ALMM,Anyechka,"[5, 5]","Even though this film is three hours long, it was so powerful and engrossing that the time flew by in the blink of an eye.  Instead of wasting time setting up characters and a premise before really launching into the meat of the story, it pretty much begins immediately, drawing the viewer in right away as opposed to gradually building up more and more of an interest level.  It also drew me in right away because I'm very interested in Hungarian history, and just love long epic films, particularly if they're also family sagas.  I actually wish the film had been even longer, to tell even more of the story of the Sonnenschein/Sors family.The film follows the lives of three generations of one family (actually four if you count the parents of the original three characters, Gustave, Valerie, and Ignatz) living in Hungary, over the course of about a hundred years.  The historical authenticity, in areas such as costumes, archive film footage, and the household furnishings, is really good, though it's far more than just a mere costume picture.  Through the generations, each of the three main characters (all played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes) has to deal with his Jewishness, the changing world, his relationships with women, family ties, self-identity, and the constant presence of anti-Semitism, always in a new form.  Ignatz, the first generation, deals by exceeding in school, becoming a high-profile judge, and changing his name, while feeling that he's safe under the supposed tolerant liberal rule of the monarchy; Adam, the second generation, deals by becoming a champion fencer as a means of fighting back against anti-Semitic schoolyard bullies, and becomes a Catholic in order to fully assimilate and be accepted by a society he believes would never betray him; and Ivan, the third generation, believes that becoming a Communist officer after WWII, helping to bring to justice the fascists who murdered almost all of his family, is the solution to anti-Semitism and a way in to wider society.  In each generation, each character sees the system he believed in fail and eventually betray him, giving way to an entirely new system.  Through it all, Ivan's grandmother Valerie is the rock holding it all together.  She's the surviving witness left to so many decades of history, and, as she tells him, each time the new form of government promises to liberate the people and castigates the previous system as criminal, only to turn into such criminals themselves.  The performance of the older Valerie (Rosemary Harris) is perhaps the most standout one in the film, even more powerful than Fiennes's triple role.  And in the end, the lessons and ideals of all the previous generations come together in a final powerful lesson and message.Overall, this is one fine amazing film that I'd highly recommend to anyone interested in history or who isn't scared away by any film that's more than two hours long.  It's more than just an ordinary family saga, and who wouldn't benefit from a message like being true to yourself?",5,What an experience!,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,3036,"['Even', 'film', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'engrossing', 'time', 'flew', 'blink', 'eye', 'Instead', 'wasting', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'characters', 'premise', 'really', 'launching', 'meat', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'begins', 'immediately', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'right', 'away', 'opposed', 'gradually', 'building', 'up', 'more', 'more', 'interest', 'level', 'also', 'drew', 'right', 'away', ""'m"", 'very', 'interested', 'Hungarian', 'history', 'just', 'love', 'long', 'epic', 'films', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'also', 'family', 'sagas', 'actually', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'even', 'longer', 'tell', 'even', 'more', 'story', 'Sonnenschein/Sors', 'family.The', 'film', 'lives', 'three', 'generations', 'one', 'family', 'actually', 'four', 'count', 'parents', 'original', 'three', 'characters', 'Gustave', 'Valerie', 'Ignatz', 'living', 'Hungary', 'course', 'hundred', 'years', 'historical', 'authenticity', 'areas', 'such', 'costumes', 'archive', 'film', 'footage', 'household', 'furnishings', 'really', 'good', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'mere', 'costume', 'picture', 'generations', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'deal', 'Jewishness', 'changing', 'world', 'relationships', 'women', 'family', 'ties', 'self-identity', 'constant', 'presence', 'anti-Semitism', 'always', 'new', 'form', 'Ignatz', 'first', 'generation', 'deals', 'exceeding', 'school', 'becoming', 'high-profile', 'judge', 'changing', 'name', 'feeling', 'safe', 'supposed', 'tolerant', 'liberal', 'rule', 'monarchy', 'Adam', 'second', 'generation', 'deals', 'becoming', 'champion', 'fencer', 'means', 'fighting', 'back', 'anti-Semitic', 'schoolyard', 'bullies', 'Catholic', 'order', 'fully', 'assimilate', 'be', 'accepted', 'society', 'would', 'never', 'betray', 'Ivan', 'third', 'generation', 'becoming', 'Communist', 'officer', 'WWII', 'helping', 'bring', 'justice', 'fascists', 'who', 'murdered', 'almost', 'family', 'solution', 'anti-Semitism', 'way', 'wider', 'society', 'generation', 'character', 'system', 'believed', 'fail', 'eventually', 'betray', 'giving', 'way', 'entirely', 'new', 'system', 'Ivan', 'grandmother', 'Valerie', 'rock', 'holding', 'together', 'surviving', 'witness', 'left', 'so', 'many', 'decades', 'history', 'time', 'new', 'form', 'government', 'promises', 'liberate', 'people', 'previous', 'system', 'criminal', 'only', 'turn', 'such', 'criminals', 'performance', 'older', 'Valerie', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'perhaps', 'most', 'standout', 'one', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'Fiennes', 'triple', 'role', 'end', 'lessons', 'ideals', 'previous', 'generations', 'come', 'together', 'final', 'powerful', 'lesson', 'message.Overall', 'one', 'fine', 'amazing', 'film', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'who', ""n't"", 'scared', 'away', 'film', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'more', 'just', 'ordinary', 'family', 'saga', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'benefit', 'message', 'being', 'true', 'yourself']",N/A

Smith,"[3, 4]","At three hours, this covers nothing less than the entire last 100 years of Hungarian history in the guise of a family sage spanning three generations. Ralph Fiennes does a bang-up job of playing three roles, managing to look just a bit different each time as he morphs from the 19th century as a judge, to a WWII fencing champion and finally as a Nazi hunting Communist. All the roles in the film are well played. I have no idea how anyone could sit through this in a theater.

I've adored the vast majority of the films he's been in too.  &quot;The Avengers&quot; was probably his worst film but this may be his most disappointing.  Fiennes plays three characters in an Eastern European Jewish family as the grandfather, father and son, each at the prime moments of their respective adulthoods.  Each lives in tumultuous times to be a Jew in Europe and suffers considerably as a result. The film doesn't quite work and by the time we got to that third and final male in this family, I was almost dreading Fiennes' reappearance.  The film is also very slow and at 3 hours that is a problem. Usually home DVD viewing makes long movies easier to watch but that wasn't true in this case.  Fiennes also is usually wonderful to watch in romantic and love scenes but these were almost embarrassing as they were so similar and perfunctory from generation to generation. Director Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute; is being compared by many to the late David Lean but I believe that Lean was far more able to sustain a viewer's interest in such long sagas, such as he did in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Passage To India.&quot;",3,My Great Expectations Not Met By This Film,993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,1242,"['approach', 'seeing', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'film', 'great', 'expectations', 'such', 'superb', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'adored', 'vast', 'majority', 'films', 'been', 'too', 'quot', 'Avengers', 'quot', 'was', 'probably', 'worst', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'disappointing', 'Fiennes', 'plays', 'three', 'characters', 'Eastern', 'European', 'Jewish', 'family', 'grandfather', 'father', 'son', 'prime', 'moments', 'respective', 'adulthoods', 'lives', 'tumultuous', 'times', 'be', 'Jew', 'Europe', 'suffers', 'considerably', 'result', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'time', 'got', 'third', 'final', 'male', 'family', 'was', 'almost', 'dreading', 'Fiennes', 'reappearance', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'slow', '3', 'hours', 'problem', 'Usually', 'home', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'long', 'movies', 'easier', 'watch', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', 'case', 'Fiennes', 'also', 'usually', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'romantic', 'love', 'scenes', 'were', 'almost', 'embarrassing', 'were', 'so', 'similar', 'perfunctory', 'generation', 'generation', 'Director', 'Istv', 'aacute', 'Szab', 'oacute', 'being', 'compared', 'many', 'late', 'David', 'Lean', 'believe', 'Lean', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'able', 'sustain', 'viewer', 'interest', 'such', 'long', 'sagas', 'such', 'did', 'quot', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'quot', 'quot', 'Passage', 'India.', 'quot']",N/A

Hungary is atypical of Europe.  Its language, history, and culture are derivative from sources other than all the rest of eastern Europe.  They are unique and the film is excellent at pointing this out.The criticism that the communist were portrayed as worse than the Nazi is correct, however, for anyone who has been to Budapest, you know this to be true.  The Hungarians were not defeated by the Nazi's, they chose Germany.  They've watch their country parceled out to other nations for twice choosing the German side in thr two world wars.  The communists allowed the country and most notably Budapest to decay slowly over time.  The proud Hungarians are only beginning to restore the their heritage.  Sunshine poignantly shows the neglect and the price the Hungarians (all Hungarians) paid.This was a character piece, not a history lesson, suspense, or mystery.  The acting was superb on all levels.  Fiennes clearly provdes his best performance since The English Patient. Szabo can't be faulted for injecting a certain amount of passion for Hungary into the film.Finally, the cinematagraphy keeps perfect tune with the tempo of the film.

577395,A3N94LNED0IF0R,B00005ALMM,Charles S. Tashiro,"[6, 16]","I wanted &quot;Sunshine&quot; to be the sophisticated epic its publicity suggested, but my heart sank in the first five minutes when the narrator Ivan's great great grandfather is killed in an explosion worthy of John Woo or a Bond film. Such a gratuitously spectactular opening is an insult, as if we couldn't be moved by a serious examination of history without this visual cymbal crash. It also points to &quot;Sunshine's&quot; fundamental problem: Money, the need to make it and the need to show it being spent.Director Istvan Szabo's most famous work (&quot;Mephisto,&quot; &quot;Colonel Redl&quot;) was made during the Communist era. Whatever might be said against it, Communism didn't worry too much about making a profit. Both of those films, at least, are serious examinations of the relationship between individuals and history. Here, the need to look elsewhere for funds to help blow up that farmhouse, clothe the actors in period-correct attire and gather the extras for the crowd scenes turns &quot;Sunshine&quot; into an international (Hungarian, Austrian, German, French, Canadian) production with no shared language. English was probably settled upon for its guarantee of a wider audience. And in quite justifiable fear that contemporary audiences might take offense at anything without a mushy feel, the irony and bite of Szabo's other work gives way to a sentimental soppiness only occasionally relieved by insight.The language issue is particularly crippling because &quot;Sunshine&quot; is so obsessed with national and personal identity. No number of shots of the Hungarian countryside or the Budapest opera house can make us forget that everyone is speaking in the wrong language. Indeed, the presence of &quot;real&quot; Hungary makes us all that more aware of the oddity of everyone speaking English. As a result, the tone is desperate and off throughout. The first third is particularly declarative and familiar, especially if you've seen &quot;Colonel Redl,&quot; which covered similar thematic territory.Things pick up when the film dramatizes the period leading up to the Second World War and the death of Ivan's father. There's real suspense as the Sonnenschein family repeatedly and quite believably convinces itself it has nothing to fear. (Incidentally, although Hungary was allied with Germany, the Nazis did not, in fact, rule there until the declining days of World War II. That makes the anti-Semitism shown in the film an expression of traditional European prejudices, not the product of a pathological state--which really makes it worse.)The final third about the Communist era starts promisingly, with a sharp performance from William Hurt as a Party official who befriends Ivan. Once Ivan discovers his political conscience, though, our prejudices are affirmed.

Miller ""Knitter and bookworm""","[11, 12]","&quot;Sunshine&quot; is a three-hour lesson in modern Hungarian history, portraying the country as it goes from Empire to Fascist to Communist rule, all seen from the perspective of the Sonnenschein family (&quot;sunshine&quot; in Hungarian).  Granted, some purists may take issue with the historical accuracy, but I am not a purist when it comes to this, so I can comment upon the film's other merits.Sprawling over three hours, this film is not for the short of attention.  But for those more accustomed to films of this genre and length, &quot;Sunshine&quot; offers many golden moments that may pass you by if you aren't prepared to notice.Ralph Fiennes takes on not two but three roles, playing grandfather, father, and son.  Other actors are more noted for their ability to transform themselves physically for a role, but Fiennes' talent in this category should not be underrated.  Although his red-haired beauty endures, he manifests the melancholy of Ignatz Sors (the grandfather), the dashing athleticism of fencer Adam Sors (the father), and the awkwardness and conflict of Ivan Sors (the son) masterfully, making each character a physically different person.However, Fiennes' ability to morph is overshadowed by the subtle, emotionally resonant performance by the fine Rosemary Harris as the elder Valerie (Sors) Sonnenschein.  In the midst of political turbulence, religious persecution, and the rise and fall of empires and regimes (as well as Fiennes' role-switching), Valerie remains the only constant, due to her unflinching sense of self.  In a country that struggles to find its identity, Valerie always knows who she is, and for this reason, she endures.Jennifer Ehle (Harris's own daughter) is competent as the younger Valerie.  She gets all of the highly emotional outbursts and confrontations with other characters, and gives Valerie an endearing vitality.  But it is Harris's quiet dignity and sly confidence that makes her the more memorable.  Just as Valerie is the pillar of the Sonnenschein family, Harris is the central pillar of the film itself.",3,"Fiennes shines, but Harris steals the show",992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,2073,"['quot', 'Sunshine', 'quot', 'three-hour', 'lesson', 'modern', 'Hungarian', 'history', 'portraying', 'country', 'Empire', 'Fascist', 'Communist', 'rule', 'seen', 'perspective', 'Sonnenschein', 'family', 'quot', 'sunshine', 'quot', 'Hungarian', 'Granted', 'purists', 'may', 'take', 'issue', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'am', 'not', 'purist', 'when', 'can', 'comment', 'film', 'other', 'merits.Sprawling', 'three', 'hours', 'film', 'not', 'short', 'attention', 'more', 'accustomed', 'films', 'genre', 'length', 'quot', 'Sunshine', 'quot', 'many', 'golden', 'moments', 'may', 'pass', 'are', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'notice.Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'not', 'two', 'three', 'roles', 'playing', 'grandfather', 'father', 'son', 'Other', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'noted', 'ability', 'transform', 'physically', 'role', 'Fiennes', 'talent', 'category', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'underrated', 'red-haired', 'beauty', 'endures', 'melancholy', 'Ignatz', 'Sors', 'grandfather', 'dashing', 'athleticism', 'fencer', 'Adam', 'Sors', 'father', 'awkwardness', 'conflict', 'Ivan', 'Sors', 'son', 'masterfully', 'making', 'character', 'physically', 'different', 'person.However', 'Fiennes', 'ability', 'morph', 'overshadowed', 'subtle', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'performance', 'fine', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'elder', 'Valerie', 'Sors', 'Sonnenschein', 'midst', 'political', 'turbulence', 'religious', 'persecution', 'rise', 'fall', 'empires', 'regimes', 'as', 'well', 'Fiennes', 'role-switching', 'Valerie', 'only', 'constant', 'due', 'unflinching', 'sense', 'self', 'country', 'find', 'identity', 'Valerie', 'always', 'who', 'reason', 'endures.Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Harris', 'own', 'daughter', 'competent', 'younger', 'Valerie', 'highly', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'confrontations', 'other', 'characters', 'Valerie', 'endearing', 'vitality', 'Harris', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'sly', 'confidence', 'more', 'memorable', 'Just', 'Valerie', 'pillar', 'Sonnenschein', 'family', 'Harris', 'central', 'pillar', 'film']",N/A

A three hour movie is simply too long to enjoy at a theater.  It works much better as a DVD which can be turned on and off as one so desires.  Still, I have no hesitation in giving it five stars.  This film is worthy of your patience.  We follow the trails and tribulations of the Sonnenschein family in Hungary from the very beginnings of the Twentieth Century to the late 1980s.  Initially, this is a Jewish family trying to make the best of things as citizens of the now extinct Austro-Hungarian empire.  Anti-Semitism is pervasive but a Jew, paying a very high cost, is permitted to assimilate into the larger Christian community.  What is the price tag required for acceptance?  It is the abandonment of one's Jewish religious and cultural heritage.  All three Sonnenschein youths even opt to forsake the family name.  Things are obviously not great.  Still, the situation is improving.  And then World War I breaks out and their world collapses.  One of the brothers is foolishly seduced into embracing Communism while the other wisely understands that a viable society must be committed to the rule of law.  The present system might not be perfect, but the royal family is benevolent and willing to continue relinquishing its power.  Regrettably, the destruction caused by the Great War eventually brings about the collapse of the empire.  By the mid 1930s the Nazis are rapidly dominating the political landscape.  Adolph Hitler could care less about a Jew's assimilation. Only genetics matter and Jews are deemed biologically evil.  Their planned eradication is the logical conclusion of the nonnegotiable ideological premises of Hitler's thugs.  Even military heroes, Olympic fencing champions, and practicing Catholics are scheduled to be butchered.  The members of the Sonnenschein family realize too late the precariousness of their situation.Finally, the Communists take over.  These totalitarians allege to embrace universal brotherhood, radical egalitarianism, and despise anti-Semitism.  This turns out, sadly, not to be entirely accurate.  I was amazed how honestly the creators of Sunshine dealt with the Jew hatred during the Stalin era.  The only Jews tolerated by the Soviets were those of the self-hating variety.  All others were persecuted---often to the point of execution.  Sometimes even the self-haters found themselves taking a bullet in the back of the head.  Disgustingly, the leftist intellectual establishment prefers to ignore this vile chapter in the history of the Communist movement.  Yes, you must see this movie.

577405,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005ALMM,"""flickjunkie""","[9, 11]","&#65533;Sunshine&#65533; is a forceful and wonderful film that follows four generations of a Jewish Hungarian family through seventy tumultuous years of Hungarian history.  The story is extremely well done with rich, finely etched characters.  The screenplay is better suited for a miniseries than a three hour film simply because there is so much material to cover.  Three hours is both too long and too short; the story is emotionally exhausting making it too long for one sitting, yet the total length is not long enough to do the subject matter justice.Hungarian Writer/Director Istvan Szabo captures Hungary&#65533;s turbulent transition from empire to fascist state to soviet satellite weaving the history of the times into the lives of this extraordinary family.  He puts a human face on the historical facts giving us a disturbingly real look at what it might have been like to live through it, especially from the Jewish perspective.Despite a whirlwind pace that requires years to be spanned in minutes, Szabo manages to conjure deep and insightful character studies of the members of each generation.  His period renderings are exquisite from costumes to props to locations.  This is a wonderfully textured presentation with history layered over the human stories, addressing the many indignities suffered by Jews in Hungary during the period, and the many concessions made to merely stay alive.  It is a story that contains both triumph and tragedy, presented with amazing candor.Ralph Fiennes gives three incredible performances as the grandfather, father and son of the patriarchy.  Szabo has endured criticism for casting the same actor in three roles, but in this case it is an excellent choice.  Fiennes is a versatile artist and personalizes three radically different characters, slipping on each personality like a custom fitted glove.  He loses himself in each, rendering them all passionately but appropriately based on the motivations established in Szabo's careful character development.  With Szabo&#65533;s guidance, it is clear that Fiennes has an inherent understanding of the psyche of his three characters and plays them with believable nuance.Two different actresses play Valerie and each is splendid.  Jennifer Ehle plays the young Valerie and endows her with ardor and vivacity.  She establishes Valerie as the strongest continuing character in the film, providing linkage between the past and the present.  In another stroke of casting brilliance, Szabo selects Ehle&#65533;s real life mother, Rosemary Harris as the elder Valerie.  The clear resemblance linked with Harris&#65533; magnetic performance adds fullness to Valerie&#65533;s later years.

577407,A1NT3HJYYHYCA5,B00005ALMM,Govindan Nair,"[10, 10]","By taking a slice of Hungarian history spanning roughly the last century, this movie chooses a historical setting which provides a concentrated message of human frailty and idealism amidst social and political change. In this microcosmic world of a century of Hungarian history, we encounter some broader familiar themes of social mobility (both economically and politically) of a religious minority in a country with its own conflicted sense of national identity through different political regimes. Ralph Fiennes (of the more familiar movie ""The English Patient"") superbly plays multiple roles, as a male member of three successive generations of a Hungarian Jewish family, spanning the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the two World Wards to (briefly) modern post-communist Hungary.  Fiennes' presence throughout this movie in multiple roles lends a curious continuity to several recurrent themes in this tale of political and family loyalty and betrayal. Haunted by the image of his impotence at watching his father being tortured and killed in front of several hundred Jewish prisoners, the leading male character struggles to expiate his guilt and avenge the shadowy forces of anti-Semitism. But his own ideals are dashed as his police interrogator role in communist Hungary leads him to confront the hypocrisy of yet another regime in which ideological purity and political expediency are hard to distinguish. With his own fanatical commitment to pursue the fascist elements in post World War Two communist Hungary, the leading character shares much in common with his grandfather's loyalty, as a high level magistrate, to the monarchy of a crumbling empire of which Hungary was a part, and with his father's blind faith in the willingness of the newly recreated Hungary to assimilate a Jew who converts to Catholicism as he also becomes a national Olympics fencing hero. In the end, all three characters of three generations of the same family become victims of different political regimes, all of which learn to use their willing victims as pawns who become betrayed with their blind loyalty. Oddly, it is the several women characters who invariably become amorously entangled with different male characters, who seem most skeptical of the promises of different regimes.  Unfortunately, it is not often we find this kind of epic movie which personalizes large swathes of history through the saga of several generations of a single family - and it is often compared to Dr. Zhivago.

Set in Hungary the movie covers three generations of a Hungarian Jewish family, the Sonnenscheins. In the late 19th Century, Ignatz; his brother Gustave and his adopted sister Hannah; who is his natural cousin and whom he marries, change their names to ""Sors"" in order to ""assimilate"" into Hungarian society. Ignatz's son Adam even converts to Roman Catholicism and wins a medal in fencing in the 1936 Olympics. After silently witnessing his father die at the hands of the Nazis,  the third generation Sonnenschein/Sors son Ivan attempts to avenge his father's death by joining Stalin's Communist Party.Ralph Fiennes (lately in ""The Constant Gardener"") plays all three of the Ignantz/Adam/Ivan characters through three generations and does it admirably. The young Hannah is played by Jennifer Ehle; the older Hannah by Rosemary Harris, the mother of Ehle in real life. William Hurt plays Ivan's friend Knorr. Both the score and filming are beautifully done. Many of the war and concentration camp scenes are shot in black and white.The sad theme is easily stated. In the eyes of oppressors it matters not if you change your name or not. If you choose to hate a whole nation of people because of who they are, nothing will stop you. Even though the film is all about the awfulness of anti-Semitism, there is sunshine here in the resiliant character Hannah who ""breathed freely"" and always looked for the beautiful to photograph.Even through three hours long, this film is well worth your time, both for the all-to-relevant theme and the fine acting.",4,What's In A Name?,1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,1640,"['1999', 'film', 'directed', 'Istvan', 'Szabo', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'lot', 'going', 'Set', 'Hungary', 'movie', 'three', 'generations', 'Hungarian', 'Jewish', 'family', 'Sonnenscheins', 'late', '19th', 'Century', 'Ignatz', 'brother', 'Gustave', 'adopted', 'sister', 'Hannah', 'who', 'natural', 'cousin', 'whom', 'change', 'names', 'Sors', 'order', 'assimilate', 'Hungarian', 'society', 'Ignatz', 'son', 'Adam', 'even', 'Roman', 'Catholicism', 'medal', 'fencing', '1936', 'Olympics', 'silently', 'witnessing', 'father', 'die', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'third', 'generation', 'Sonnenschein/Sors', 'son', 'Ivan', 'avenge', 'father', 'death', 'joining', 'Stalin', 'Communist', 'Party.Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'lately', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'three', 'Ignantz/Adam/Ivan', 'characters', 'three', 'generations', 'admirably', 'young', 'Hannah', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'older', 'Hannah', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'mother', 'Ehle', 'real', 'life', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Ivan', 'friend', 'Knorr', 'score', 'filming', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Many', 'war', 'concentration', 'camp', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'black', 'white.The', 'sad', 'theme', 'easily', 'stated', 'eyes', 'oppressors', 'not', 'change', 'name', 'not', 'choose', 'hate', 'whole', 'nation', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'nothing', 'will', 'stop', 'Even', 'film', 'awfulness', 'anti-Semitism', 'sunshine', 'here', 'resiliant', 'character', 'Hannah', 'who', 'breathed', 'freely', 'always', 'looked', 'beautiful', 'photograph.Even', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'film', 'well', 'time', 'all-to-relevant', 'theme', 'fine', 'acting']",N/A

This maybe one of the most enchanting visual film experiences I've had in a long time. The landscape is amazing and is filmed to perfection, especially in the first of the three vignettes. The photography crew and the director all have amazing artistic eyes; they make the imagery carry the flick. In addition to its mesmerizing visual qualities, Sunshine is very well performed. While Fiennes is clearly the star and the person the movie successfully relies on, the supporting cast does more than hold its own. The dialogue, for the most part, is well written, though some of the voice overs are a little choppy.The most impressive part about both the direction and the writing is how well and seamlessly they deal with some very difficult themes. Sunshine includes commentary on anti-seminitism, assimilation, individuality and political upheaval,  amongst some other more minor themes. These are all clearly difficult topics for any artist to work on without ending heavy handed. Sunshine does just that; I never felt assaulted or preached to. That is a true testiment to the film makers.But despite all of the this, the film's character development is quite flawed. All of the characters in the first third of the movie feel real, like human beings, like people with true personalities and motivations. But as the film progresses, the characters begin to fade, perhaps in the interests of the plot and perhaps to keep a slow-paced movie moving. Either way, this is a mistake. The female characters in particular begin to feel like stereotypes; the love affairs stop being developed until the final third when Fiennes' romance with Deborah Unger (Highlander 3) is completely unexplained. Even Fiennes' characters (especially in the final third--until the last couple of scenes) start to seem a little less real, a little harder to accept. (This is why I will say that Fiennes' performance was brilliant; despite underdeveloped characters, he left me believing in his actions.) This left me questioning the plot as well as the characters. In a film written from character and dominated by its performers that is a difficult flaw to overcome.With that said, in the end Sunshine succeeds and is worth viewing.

They did a brilliant job of bringing European history to the screen as well as exploring complex ethical and moral issues dealing with the corruption of power, national and ethnic identity, and love and lust.  The film is titled &quot;Sunshine&quot; because that is the translation of the family name, &quot;Sonnenschein&quot;, originally distillers of a beverage called &quot;A Taste of Sunshine&quot;.  As time moves on, the family assimilates and the name changes.Ralph Fiennes plays three roles and does a magnificent job.  We meet him at the turn of the century as he falls in love, becomes a judge, and serves the Emperor in WW1.  Later, we see him in the role of an Olympic fencing champion as the Nazi menace comes to his land.  Still later still we see him as a Communist.  He's a fine actor and these three different characters are all very different and yet the same.  Each makes choices that demonstrate human strength as well as frailty with no clear cut lines in between.  Jennifer Ehle plays the role of Valerie, the forbidden love of the first generation of the family.  Later, the role is taken over by her real-life mother, Rosemary Harris, as the aging matriarch.  Other fine performances in smaller, but excellent roles were that of William Hurt and John Neville.The film took a full three hours, but as far as I was concerned it could have gone on for another hour.  Never once did I feel bored or look at my watch.  The story itself was captivating, moved quickly and was full of turns and twists and unexpected happenings.  All this was set against a background that put its events into historical perspective.  The cinematography, which includes archival news footage and views of the natural countryside as well as the city of Budapest add to the sense of time and place.  And the nuanced performances of a fine set of high-level actors whose roles demanded complexity as real as life itself, left me with a feeling of knowing each of these people on a personal level.  The themes later haunted me.  What kind of choices would I have made given the different circumstances?  There are no easy answers.  Winner of awards in both Europe and Canada, this film is destined to become a classic.  I give it my highest recommendation.

For a movie that so obviously aspires to be another ""Schindler's List"", this was the final nail in the coffin. I cannot believe the glowing reviews here - at best, this was like a two star TV Movie that started off as a miniseries but ended up becoming a full fledged motion picture. This may have worked for ""Mulholland Drive"" but it does not work here.Ralph Fiennes is normally a great actor, but put him in a triple role here and watch a tragedy unfold. He does NOT come across as coherent or talented here - in fact the poor thing looks a little lost in the mess. I especially hated the WWII scenes where they had to torture the naked lead actor and till the very end he does not give up his dignity or honor (should be seen to be believed - this was unintentionally hilarious and I was laughing through it). When a poignant story in fact reduces you to giggles, I'm sorry, but its not worth watching.Many people over the years have compared this to ""Sophie's Choice"", ""Schindler's List"", and ""The English Patient"". I have to ask them - have you been watching the same movie? Everyone has a very put-on fake accent in this film (remember Angelina Jolie's over the top accent in ""Alexander""?) and go through the motions. I also had a problem with the tragic twists and turns every ten minutes through these movies, as if the director was begging us to empathize with these sad people and their tragic lives.At best, this is like one of those History Channel specials about unsung war heroes and world figures. They should have made this three one-hour documentaries instead of a meaningless feature film, plus they should have cut out all the gory gag inducing sex scenes that had absolutely no place in a film of this 'stature'.Two Stars.

577422,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005ALMM,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[4, 5]","A weighty picture, Sunshine passes over three generations of the Sonnenshine family over the troubled war period in Hungary.  Originally the family set themselves up selling Sunshine beer, bearing three children, one of them being Fiennes, who does well as a judge.  His son, Adam (Fiennes again) then goes on to win the gold medal in fencing at the Olympics, before being stripped, beaten and murdered in a concentration camp during World War II.  Enraged by his father's death and consumed by guilt at not doing anything, Adam's son (played by Fiennes again) joins the Communist party, prepared to do anything he can against the fascist regime.  Along the way Fiennes clocks up four women who are passionately in love with him and moves in between politics, family and love.Whilst at many times feeling like a lavish TV production that could have been serialised in three parts, each one telling the tale of one generation, there is a lot more to Sunshine than may at first meet the eye.  Rather than being something that merely prides itself in period detail or the chronicling of history, the movie holds several themes that only truly come together at the very end.  The natures of love and of the self are constantly questioned, as well as the question of how can we as humans define ourselves - through our family?  Our religion?  Our history and what we inherit?  For a movie that is so firmly based in politics (and, indeed, has a lot to say on the subject), Sunshine is very focused on the individual.  It's almost as if Fiennes' character is improving through each of his forefathers, realising their mistakes as well as his own and therefore true realisation of the movie's `point' as it were can only truly be found by Fiennes, and the audience, in the film's conclusion.Fiennes gives an absolutely stunning performance, making subtle character changes as well as simultaneously drawing parallels between each of the generations of the family.  Beginning as proud and emotionless, he changes to someone who is capable of but ultimately fears emotion and finally into someone who is driven by and embraces it, something that certainly holds several parallels to the history that serves not just as a backdrop to the characters but also as something that may define them.  Of course, it would be unfair to only mention Fiennes when so many other good actors, many who should be recognisable to a British audience, surround him.  Jennifer Ehle proves that there is more to her than Pride and Prejudice and puts in another great performance, as does Rosemary Harris who plays her older self.  James Fraine is also fantastic as Fienne's rebellious brother in the first story, and Rachel Weissz is again a joy in another sparkling supporting role.  And perhaps it is this that makes Sunshine so special, the fact that rather than giving it to us straight, that family and women constantly impinge on the lives of the Sonneshines.  This may not be something that you would necessarily watch again in a hurry (purely due to its three hour running time), but it's an experience unto itself and several lines are very moving indeed.  Plus, for a story that ends in the 1950's, it feels remarkably universal.",4,Worthwhile and ultimately completely compelling epic,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,3210,"['weighty', 'picture', 'Sunshine', 'three', 'generations', 'Sonnenshine', 'family', 'troubled', 'war', 'period', 'Hungary', 'Originally', 'family', 'set', 'up', 'selling', 'Sunshine', 'beer', 'bearing', 'three', 'children', 'one', 'being', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'well', 'judge', 'son', 'Adam', 'Fiennes', 'again', 'then', 'win', 'gold', 'medal', 'fencing', 'Olympics', 'being', 'stripped', 'beaten', 'murdered', 'concentration', 'camp', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Enraged', 'father', 'death', 'consumed', 'guilt', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'Adam', 'son', 'played', 'Fiennes', 'again', 'Communist', 'party', 'prepared', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'fascist', 'regime', 'way', 'Fiennes', 'up', 'four', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'passionately', 'love', 'moves', 'politics', 'family', 'love.Whilst', 'many', 'times', 'feeling', 'lavish', 'TV', 'production', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'serialised', 'three', 'parts', 'one', 'telling', 'tale', 'one', 'generation', 'lot', 'more', 'Sunshine', 'may', 'first', 'meet', 'eye', 'Rather', 'being', 'something', 'merely', 'period', 'detail', 'chronicling', 'history', 'movie', 'several', 'themes', 'only', 'truly', 'come', 'together', 'very', 'end', 'natures', 'love', 'self', 'are', 'constantly', 'questioned', 'as', 'well', 'question', 'how', 'can', 'humans', 'define', 'family', 'religion', 'history', 'what', 'inherit', 'movie', 'so', 'firmly', 'based', 'politics', 'indeed', 'lot', 'say', 'subject', 'Sunshine', 'very', 'focused', 'individual', 'almost', 'Fiennes', 'character', 'improving', 'forefathers', 'realising', 'mistakes', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'therefore', 'true', 'realisation', 'movie', 'point', 'were', 'can', 'only', 'truly', 'be', 'found', 'Fiennes', 'audience', 'film', 'conclusion.Fiennes', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'performance', 'making', 'subtle', 'character', 'changes', 'as', 'well', 'simultaneously', 'drawing', 'parallels', 'generations', 'family', 'Beginning', 'proud', 'emotionless', 'someone', 'who', 'capable', 'ultimately', 'fears', 'emotion', 'finally', 'someone', 'who', 'driven', 'embraces', 'something', 'certainly', 'several', 'parallels', 'history', 'not', 'just', 'backdrop', 'characters', 'also', 'something', 'may', 'define', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'only', 'mention', 'Fiennes', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'good', 'actors', 'many', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'recognisable', 'British', 'audience', 'surround', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'more', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'great', 'performance', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'who', 'older', 'self', 'James', 'Fraine', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Fienne', 'rebellious', 'brother', 'first', 'story', 'Rachel', 'Weissz', 'again', 'joy', 'sparkling', 'supporting', 'role', 'perhaps', 'Sunshine', 'special', 'fact', 'rather', 'giving', 'straight', 'family', 'women', 'constantly', 'impinge', 'lives', 'Sonneshines', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'something', 'would', 'necessarily', 'watch', 'again', 'hurry', 'purely', 'due', 'three', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'experience', 'unto', 'several', 'lines', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'indeed', 'story', '1950', 'remarkably', 'universal']",N/A

I suppose that's a message that strikes a chord among some jaded Europeans.  It's a message that deflates the movie for those of us who think that democracy and freedom are political ideas worth defending.The movie also provides a jaded, European view of Jews.  The movie contains some strong scenes about the ugliness of anti-Semitism.  Yet, the movie seems at pains to suggest that Jews were not exactly innocent victims -- there's a major character who converts to Christianity and starts to make ethnic slurs of his own against Jews; there's his son who goes from being an inmate in a concentration camp to working for the secret police and hunting down participants in the ""Zionist conspiracy""; there's a protracted scene accusing the Jews of failing to fight back against the Nazis.

577428,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,B00005ALMM,Robert Amsel,"[16, 18]","&quot;Sunshine&quot; is mainly about four generations of a Jewish family in Hungary who try to assimilate into the Christian world around them in order to find social acceptance.  Most of the characters -- except for Valerie (Jennifer Ehle/Rosemary Harris), an &quot;adopted&quot; daughter and thus an outsider -- are deluded into believing that such an assimilation is workable.  Each generation finds out the hard way that Anti-Semitism is a core societal belief and whatever political faction is in power -- a liberal aristocracy, Naziism, or Communism -- Jews will continue to be outsiders and outcasts IF the country where they live regards them as scapegoats and pariahs.As the personal stories unfold in each generation, there is a wonderful progression that holds the tale together, as well as does Ralph Fiennes' three performances as a grandfather, father, and son.  The great-grandfather (David De Peyser) is proud of his Jewish heritage, of his family name, Sonnenschein, and of his family business, that produces a wonderful liqueur called &quot;Sunshine,&quot; which is what Sonnenschein means.His son (played by Ralph Fiennes in his first role), is a lawyer and judge, who changes his last name to something less Jewish and more Hungarian.  He finds neither love, acceptance, or fullfillment personally or professionally as a result, and his life ends rather lonely and miserably.His son (Fiennes again) takes the assimilation a step further and becomes a Roman Catholic so that he can join the right club and pursue his career as a fencing master, ultimately winning an Olympic gold medal.  The temporary adulation he receives makes him forget his heritage and his original religion completely.  He is sadistically murdered at Auschwitz, sadly denying his Jewishness to the bitter end.It is the grandson, again played by Fiennes, who not only watches helplessly as his father is murdered, but ultimately, after the war is ended, embraces communism as a solution.  But as Stalinist-type communism yet again focuses on Jews as a Zionist enemy, the grandson is forced to take part in the interrogation of an innocent Jewish communist, accused of Zionism (played by William Hurt), who is ultimately beaten to death.With the help and wisdom of his great-aunt Valerie, who nearing death reclaims the original family name, the grandson at last frees himself from the politics around him and willfully becomes an outcast.  As a result, he achieves spiritual freedom.  He also regains his pride and his Jewishness and legally changes his name back to Sonnenschein.  Communism ends, and the sun does indeed shine once more.In most films, a central character grows and changes as the result of varied experiences.  &quot;Sunshine&quot; just presents a wider canvas in which Ralph Fiennes must be reincarnated several times over in order to get his act together.  It's no accident that the same actor plays three roles.  It's intrinsic to the whole piece as we watch what is initially a spiritual regression -- with the first name change -- become a spiritual progression with the name change back again.  Symbolism abounds as the actual recipe for the liqueur gets lost (just as the characters get lost), but by the end, the recipe is no longer needed.",5,Anti-Semitism Illustrated Against a Backdrop of Assimilation,1006041600,"11 18, 2001",2001,3257,"['quot', 'Sunshine', 'quot', 'mainly', 'four', 'generations', 'Jewish', 'family', 'Hungary', 'who', 'try', 'assimilate', 'Christian', 'world', 'order', 'find', 'social', 'acceptance', 'Most', 'characters', 'Valerie', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle/Rosemary', 'Harris', 'quot', 'adopted', 'quot', 'daughter', 'thus', 'outsider', 'are', 'deluded', 'believing', 'assimilation', 'workable', 'generation', 'out', 'hard', 'way', 'Anti-Semitism', 'core', 'societal', 'belief', 'political', 'faction', 'power', 'liberal', 'aristocracy', 'Naziism', 'Communism', 'Jews', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'outsiders', 'outcasts', 'IF', 'country', 'where', 'live', 'regards', 'scapegoats', 'pariahs.As', 'personal', 'stories', 'unfold', 'generation', 'wonderful', 'progression', 'tale', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'three', 'performances', 'grandfather', 'father', 'son', 'great-grandfather', 'David', 'De', 'Peyser', 'proud', 'Jewish', 'heritage', 'family', 'name', 'Sonnenschein', 'family', 'business', 'wonderful', 'liqueur', 'called', 'quot', 'Sunshine', 'quot', 'what', 'Sonnenschein', 'son', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'first', 'role', 'lawyer', 'judge', 'who', 'last', 'name', 'something', 'less', 'Jewish', 'more', 'Hungarian', 'love', 'acceptance', 'fullfillment', 'personally', 'professionally', 'result', 'life', 'rather', 'lonely', 'miserably.His', 'son', 'Fiennes', 'again', 'assimilation', 'step', 'further', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'so', 'can', 'join', 'right', 'club', 'pursue', 'career', 'fencing', 'master', 'ultimately', 'winning', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medal', 'temporary', 'adulation', 'forget', 'heritage', 'original', 'religion', 'completely', 'sadistically', 'murdered', 'Auschwitz', 'sadly', 'denying', 'Jewishness', 'bitter', 'end.It', 'grandson', 'again', 'played', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'helplessly', 'father', 'murdered', 'ultimately', 'war', 'ended', 'communism', 'solution', 'Stalinist-type', 'communism', 'yet', 'again', 'Jews', 'Zionist', 'enemy', 'grandson', 'forced', 'take', 'part', 'interrogation', 'innocent', 'Jewish', 'communist', 'accused', 'Zionism', 'played', 'William', 'Hurt', 'who', 'ultimately', 'beaten', 'death.With', 'help', 'wisdom', 'great-aunt', 'Valerie', 'who', 'nearing', 'death', 'original', 'family', 'name', 'grandson', 'last', 'frees', 'politics', 'willfully', 'outcast', 'result', 'spiritual', 'freedom', 'also', 'pride', 'Jewishness', 'legally', 'name', 'back', 'Sonnenschein', 'Communism', 'sun', 'indeed', 'shine', 'once', 'more.In', 'most', 'films', 'central', 'character', 'grows', 'changes', 'result', 'varied', 'experiences', 'quot', 'Sunshine', 'quot', 'just', 'wider', 'canvas', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'must', 'be', 'reincarnated', 'several', 'times', 'order', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'accident', 'same', 'actor', 'plays', 'three', 'roles', 'intrinsic', 'whole', 'piece', 'watch', 'what', 'initially', 'spiritual', 'regression', 'first', 'name', 'change', 'become', 'spiritual', 'progression', 'name', 'change', 'back', 'again', 'Symbolism', 'actual', 'recipe', 'liqueur', 'lost', 'just', 'characters', 'get', 'lost', 'end', 'recipe', 'no', 'longer', 'needed']",N/A
577429,A39Y2IQ99V7CC9,B00005ALMM,"SEP ""sepowe""","[4, 5]","SUNSHINE is a film about 3 generations of Hungarian-Jewish family and the trials and tribulations that consume them during some of Europe's darkest years--two world wars and more political and social upheavel than I can begin to imagine.  SUNSHINE is an historically ambitious film; sadly, however, the character development was the main sacrifice.Ralph Fiennes portrays 3 different generations of the Sonnenschein family--Ignatz, Adam, and Ivan.  The film's distinct partion into 3 different generations is one reason the great length of this film needn't hinder viewers--it's easy to take a break as soon as one sees Ralph morph into a different character.Beginning with Ignatz, the family's strong Jewish name (Sonnenschein, translated to ""sunshine"") causes problems.  As a young lawyer, Ignatz convinces the family to adopt the name Sors to better their chances of assimilating into the upper echelon of Hungarian society.  What follows is a very rapid peek into more than 50 years of Hungarian history as experienced by the Sors family.  Though the film is narrated by Ivan, the third and final Sors man we meet, it is Valerie who is the only constant, and whose character is strongest.  Raised by her aunt and uncle, the parents of Ignatz and his brother Gustav, she causes much family controversy when she seduces Ignatz, becomes pregnant, and entices him to marry her.  Nonetheless, she remains the backbone of the family while the men get carried away with various personal and political ambitions--she is also the only woman in the family to survive the Holocaust.  My advice to to watch Valerie closely, because her saga, though not a focus of the film, is every bit as compelling and perhaps more indicative of the suffering endured by real people.The acting in this film is acceptable. Fiennes is merely good; the one truly spectacular performance was certainly Rosemary Harris' portrayal of the aging Valerie.This isn't a bad film.  It's very audience-friendly in spite of its great length--the storyline is never difficult to follow.  But it's nothing life-altering or profound.

What a glorious message of love and joy subordinating almost every other pursuit in our lives.We follow the travails of a Hungarian family through three generations -- and three political/ideological regimes. The first forty minutes are replete with their own elaborate costume sets and gorgeous locales of Budapest. The second and the third generations depicted find themselves smack in the middle of the Holocaust and the follow-up Stalinisque regime. As the Sonnenchiens (the Sunshine family) live through these times with a great loss of life and blood, there're also invaluable lessons to be learnt.I felt the movie did not sufficiently capitalize on the emotions between men and women except for the first Sonnenchiens. Instead, there's a lot of unnecessary nudity. I'd be stupid to mind seeing Rachel Weisz (The Mummy) and Deborah Kara Unger (Crash) in ecstasy but it got to be almost redundant because the man was the same, Ralph Fiennes playing a different generation. The music for such an epic could have and probably should have been much more memorable, it was just any generic symphony you'd expect from a romanticized epic-mode film.But these are petty quibbles. Like other movies of its kind, e.g., &quot;House of Spirits&quot; or &quot;American History X&quot;, Sunshine certainly has its faults, but its messages about tolerance, humanity, and redemption are absolutely glorious.For a 3 hour film, the DVD could surely have done a lot better by breaking the movie into Sors I, Sors II and Sors III sections.

577432,AX5M99FZN281B,B00005ALMM,Thomas A. DiMaggio,"[15, 17]","Istvan Szabo's &quot;Sunshine&quot; is a treasure, in the form of an old-fashioned film in the best possible sense of that term: a sweeping epic in the tradition of Marcel Carne's &quot;The Children of Paradise&quot; and David Lean's &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Szabo is clearly the sort of man who sees life itself as a never-ending panorama of light and shadow, to be twice savored (and suffered): once by those who experience it, and again by the spectator, who reaffirms his own humanity by sharing vicariously in the history of others, opening his heart and mind to their reality.(Why else was drama itself ever created?) This portrayal of Jewish life in Hungary from the Franz Josef epoch to the aftermath of the 1956 revolt against Communism highlights the oft-overlooked fact that the condition of the Jews of Europe, while always different in both kind and degree from the situation faced by Gentiles, invariably served as a barometer for the health, or lack of it, in the world at large. The Sonnenschein family, through the four generations of their life that we see, make one sacrifice after another in order to accomodate themselves to what their society demands of them: first their name, and then their faith. They come to learn that, in the uniquely savage world of the last century, no concessions to prejudice, and no attempts to be &quot;good Hungarians&quot; (which they have always been)can appease the monster of totalitarianism, which is either bent on their outright extermination (as with the Nazis)or on the annihilation of all moral reference points that make life worth living (as with the Communists).Having Ralph Fiennes play the narrator, his father, and his grandfather is much more than a stunt; one eventually comes to feel that there is some sort of guardian spirit of &quot;Sonnenscheinness&quot; that accompanies the family through all of their grand,terrible years. (This hits one like a blow in the stomach when the narrator Ivan, played by Fiennes, returns home after the Holocaust -- in which he watched helplessly as his father, also played by Fiennes, was tortured to death in a Nazi camp). There are scenes in &quot;Sunshine&quot; that will linger in one's mind as long as one retains memory of any film. The aforementioned torture-murder (of one man whom we have by then come to know intimately)is a dramatization of barbarity that freezes the blood, even after decades of Holocaust dramas. Equally chilling is the scene in which the family sits listening to the radio announcement of the new anti-Semitic laws, ticking off one after another of their members who will supposedly be protected because of their status as war widows, gold-medal athletes, etc. &quot;Baba is exempt&quot; &quot;Papa is exempt&quot; -- while we the audience, occupying the position of the gods who know all, are hideously aware that, at the last, no one will be exempt. The cast is beyond praise -- but a special note of grace to the incomparable Rosemary Harris as the indomitable Valeria. The sight and sound of her telling her grandson, imprisoned for his role in the 1956 revolution &quot;You may be locked up, but it is they who are in prison&quot;, and then winking lovingly at him, is not something I will ever forget.My only reservation about &quot;Sunshine&quot; is that Szabo is a bit too fond of recurrent motifs; there is perhaps one too many New Year's Eve parties, and the use of breaking cups to foreshadow catastrophe is reminiscent of the more obvious silent-film techniques. (Also, the view near the end of the trash-compactor which devours the family's treasures, including its most precious legacy,is a fairly blatant echo of the incinerator at the close of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;).But these are minor blemishes on a glorious visage.

577433,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005ALMM,Tsuyoshi,"[29, 32]","""Sunshine"" is a fast-paced choronicle of a Jewish family for three generations, who had to live amid the stormy history of Hungary.  Ralph Fiennes (known for his role in ""English Patient"") plays three roles here: Ignatz, an elite judge under the Hungarian empire; Adam, his son and an Olympic gold medalist for fencing; and Ivan, Adam's son and an officer under Stalinism.The impressive cast include the following: Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth of ""Pride and Prejudice""); Rosemary Harris (""Tom and Viv"" ""Spider-man"" and known as Jennifer's real-life mother); Rachel Weisz (""The Mummy""); Deborah Kara Unger (""Crush""); James Frain (""Count of Monte Cristo""); John Neville (TV's ""X-Files""); and always good William Hurt and Molly Parker.The film starts with the origin of the prospering family Sonnenschein when the great-great grandfather of the narrator Ivan Sonnenschein finds a secret recipe for medicine, which becomes an instant hit, and the family make a fortune.  But a  terrible accident kills him, leaving behind the money and the recipe.  Until here, it takes only about five minutes.  Then, you must realize that ""Sunshine"" does not use an ordinary, traditional storytelling.Sure, as I said, Ralph Fiennes plays three roles in this three-hour film, which means, you are going to see three one-hour sections that cover three generations; first, our hero under Hungarian monarchy; second, him before and during the Nazi occupation; last, him under the totalitarian government during Stalinism.  The film reflects three eras of Hungary, none of which are stable or peaceful.  Of course, the film is about the Sonnenscheins, but at the same time it is about the turbulent history of the country.So, at first sight, ""Sunshine"" looks overcrowded with characters, and many of them are given too short time to be really rounded and lively.  It is also true that ""Sunshine"" sometimes heavily relies on its melodramatic plot device, which literally flies faster than any TV soap operas.  When you see the three heroes played by Fiennes always fall in love with the wrong women, causing conflicts within and without himself, you may think that the script is too repetitious and self-indulgent.  Perhaps, it should be so.  The film goes  intentionally fast, tracing the ups and downs of the family.  But the real hero must be the time or history itself, which relentlessly influences the fate of each family member, and even the apparently solid systems of Hungarian governments.After watching the three-hour chronicle, which actually seems like flying, you may feel something is missing; or the story itself looks too trite and obvious.  But, remember, so is the history of any nation, which looks as if repeating itself  countless times, never learning anything from the past.  But how can we get out of this karma?  By the time you come to the touching ending, where you realize that the most stable and level-headed character turns out NOT the hero, but someone else; then you know that the history of Hungary, or any other countries, is ultimately supported by women.Final verdict.  ""Sunshine"" may scare some people with its running time (nearly 3 hours), but its fast pace and keen eye for history will attract those who love epic-scale stories.  Some may complain that it is too fast, but by the time you reach the final segment when Rosemary Harris with her moving performance appears, everything should be forgiven.",4,History of Jewish Family for Three Generations in Hungary,1039737600,"12 13, 2002",2002,3415,"['Sunshine', 'fast-paced', 'choronicle', 'Jewish', 'family', 'three', 'generations', 'who', 'had', 'live', 'stormy', 'history', 'Hungary', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'known', 'role', 'English', 'Patient', 'three', 'roles', 'here', 'Ignatz', 'elite', 'judge', 'Hungarian', 'empire', 'Adam', 'son', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medalist', 'fencing', 'Ivan', 'Adam', 'son', 'officer', 'Stalinism.The', 'impressive', 'cast', 'include', 'following', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Elizabeth', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Tom', 'Viv', 'Spider-man', 'known', 'Jennifer', 'real-life', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Mummy', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'Crush', 'James', 'Frain', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'John', 'Neville', 'TV', 'X-Files', 'always', 'good', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Molly', 'Parker.The', 'film', 'origin', 'prospering', 'family', 'Sonnenschein', 'when', 'great-great', 'grandfather', 'narrator', 'Ivan', 'Sonnenschein', 'secret', 'recipe', 'medicine', 'instant', 'hit', 'family', 'make', 'fortune', 'terrible', 'accident', 'leaving', 'money', 'recipe', 'here', 'only', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'Then', 'must', 'realize', 'Sunshine', 'not', 'use', 'ordinary', 'traditional', 'storytelling.Sure', 'said', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'three', 'roles', 'three-hour', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'three', 'one-hour', 'sections', 'cover', 'three', 'generations', 'first', 'hero', 'Hungarian', 'monarchy', 'second', 'before', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'last', 'totalitarian', 'government', 'Stalinism', 'film', 'three', 'eras', 'Hungary', 'none', 'are', 'stable', 'peaceful', 'course', 'film', 'Sonnenscheins', 'same', 'time', 'turbulent', 'history', 'country.So', 'first', 'sight', 'Sunshine', 'overcrowded', 'characters', 'many', 'are', 'given', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'be', 'really', 'rounded', 'lively', 'also', 'true', 'Sunshine', 'sometimes', 'heavily', 'melodramatic', 'plot', 'device', 'literally', 'faster', 'TV', 'soap', 'operas', 'When', 'see', 'three', 'heroes', 'played', 'Fiennes', 'always', 'fall', 'love', 'wrong', 'women', 'causing', 'conflicts', 'may', 'think', 'script', 'too', 'repetitious', 'self-indulgent', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'film', 'intentionally', 'fast', 'tracing', 'ups', 'downs', 'family', 'real', 'hero', 'must', 'be', 'time', 'history', 'relentlessly', 'fate', 'family', 'member', 'even', 'apparently', 'solid', 'systems', 'Hungarian', 'governments.After', 'watching', 'three-hour', 'chronicle', 'actually', 'flying', 'may', 'feel', 'something', 'missing', 'story', 'too', 'trite', 'obvious', 'remember', 'so', 'history', 'nation', 'repeating', 'countless', 'times', 'never', 'learning', 'anything', 'past', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'karma', 'time', 'come', 'touching', 'ending', 'where', 'realize', 'most', 'stable', 'level-headed', 'character', 'out', 'NOT', 'hero', 'someone', 'else', 'then', 'know', 'history', 'Hungary', 'other', 'countries', 'ultimately', 'supported', 'women.Final', 'verdict', 'Sunshine', 'may', 'scare', 'people', 'running', 'time', 'nearly', '3', 'hours', 'fast', 'pace', 'keen', 'eye', 'history', 'will', 'attract', 'who', 'love', 'epic-scale', 'stories', 'may', 'complain', 'too', 'fast', 'time', 'reach', 'final', 'segment', 'when', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'moving', 'performance', 'everything', 'should', 'be', 'forgiven']",N/A

577436,A36NF437WZLQ9E,B00005ALMM,W. Powell,"[2, 3]","The movie Sunshine follows three generations of a Jewish family in the first half of 20th century Hungary. It tracks the family's loves, successes, secrets and tragedies as they struggle to continue living traditionally as their jewish forefathers did in a place and time of mounting dislike anddistrust of the jews.Sunshine is a story that needed to be told. It seems to be part fact and part fiction in telling the struggle of Hungary as a nation through the eyes of one family. It highlights the see-saw relationship of the Hungarian government with their Jewish citizens through both world wars and a revolution.For any people who's national government has been reluctant to impart equal citizenship to them based on religious and cultural reasons or institutes laws that limit their freedom and protection, this movie is a reminder that others have shared and continue to suffer the same injustice. At a time when Hungary was in bed with Hitler's Germany, Hungarian jews suffered.I believe the final message in Sunshine is to love and cherish family. To appreciate the family sacrifices of past generations that helped mold you into a righteously loving individual and hold strong to whatever faith you practice so that in the end you can die knowing you lived a truthful and fear-free life.
