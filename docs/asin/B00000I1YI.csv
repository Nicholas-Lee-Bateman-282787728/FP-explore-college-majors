502025,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,B00000I1YI,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","This review is for the video I taped from cable many years ago.This movie held its own until the very last scene. Until that time however, the movie certainly packs a real punch. Jack Hammond (Charles Sheen) kidnaps Natalie Voss (Kristy Swanson) and the two are involved in a chase from Newport Beach to San Diego where Jack is captured and then rescued by his one time ""hostage"" from which they abscond to Mexico and live life ""happily ever after"" (Yeah, Right!).This movie has always struck a cord with me. I can't and won't denigrate it. I identify with Charlie Sheen; and what red-blooded male would not desire Kristy Swanson, a gorgeous woman that could drive any man wild with desire. It also helps that I once dated a girl with that name. But I digress. Leonard Maltin in his review book gave the movie a paltry One and a Half Stars. That is too low. Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli gave it Two and a Half Stars out of Four. They at least acknowledge the satire the film aims at the news media in how they always want to one up themselves in the coverage of a major breaking story; this includes sensationalist tag lines which may well be outright lies. maltin did not see this and as a result, underrated the film.Cameos abound in this movie. Note The Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea and Anthony Kiedis and of course the Hall of Fame super stud himself, Ron Jeremy (Credited As Ron Hyatt) along with a few other notables. This movie hit the spot for me and I will look forward to buying the DVD at some point. I'm proud to be the 35th person to review this motion picture. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.A.

502026,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000I1YI,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Before Charlie Sheen's... problems (once upon a time a long, long time ago!) he starred in his share of ""okay"" movies.  Eh, he was never one of my favorites to be completely honest.The Chase however, is a really good car chase action/comedy flick.  In fact, the entire storyline is nothing BUT a lengthy car chase making me wonder if this movie sets the record for the longest segment involving a car chase ever!  Just over 60 minutes total.Of course that comes with a minor problem- do you think you can sit there and be entertained with not much else happening?  After Charlie kidnaps a hot young lady at a gas station, they both spend the entire movie riding down highways, avoiding the police and eventually becoming close once they get to know each other really well, hence the comedy segments.Some of these segments are really funny, others... well, to give one example, after the two become close, we witness a romantic scene involving the girl sitting on Charlie's lap as they make out, and Charlie's apparently loving it to the point that he's floating to the sky and not paying the least bit attention to the road or the cops... and that's just crazy, haha.I also really like before the whole car chase got underway, and Charlie was holding the girl hostage at the gas station, he held her up with, not a gun, but a butterfinger candy bar, lol.  When Charlie's character demanded that the skinny teenager working the cash register kick the police guns over to him but instead the guns went flying way across the floor... that was another hilarious segment.I really enjoy this movie.  It's short perhaps, but I was entertained.",5,"it's funny, it's action-packed, it's classic Charlie Sheen",1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,1636,"['Charlie', 'Sheen', 'problems', 'once', 'time', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'starred', 'share', 'okay', 'movies', 'Eh', 'was', 'never', 'one', 'favorites', 'be', 'completely', 'honest.The', 'Chase', 'however', 'really', 'good', 'car', 'chase', 'action/comedy', 'flick', 'fact', 'entire', 'storyline', 'nothing', 'BUT', 'lengthy', 'car', 'chase', 'making', 'wonder', 'movie', 'record', 'longest', 'segment', 'involving', 'car', 'chase', 'ever', 'Just', '60', 'minutes', 'total.Of', 'course', 'minor', 'problem-', 'do', 'think', 'can', 'sit', 'be', 'entertained', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'happening', 'Charlie', 'kidnaps', 'hot', 'young', 'lady', 'gas', 'station', 'spend', 'entire', 'movie', 'riding', 'down', 'highways', 'avoiding', 'police', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'close', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'really', 'well', 'hence', 'comedy', 'segments.Some', 'segments', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'others', 'well', 'give', 'one', 'example', 'two', 'become', 'close', 'witness', 'romantic', 'scene', 'involving', 'girl', 'sitting', 'Charlie', 'lap', 'make', 'out', 'Charlie', 'apparently', 'loving', 'point', 'floating', 'sky', 'not', 'paying', 'least', 'bit', 'attention', 'road', 'cops', 'just', 'crazy', 'haha.I', 'also', 'really', 'whole', 'car', 'chase', 'got', 'underway', 'Charlie', 'was', 'holding', 'girl', 'hostage', 'gas', 'station', 'held', 'up', 'not', 'gun', 'butterfinger', 'candy', 'bar', 'lol', 'When', 'Charlie', 'character', 'demanded', 'skinny', 'teenager', 'working', 'cash', 'register', 'kick', 'police', 'instead', 'guns', 'went', 'flying', 'way', 'floor', 'was', 'hilarious', 'segment.I', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'short', 'perhaps', 'was', 'entertained']",N/A
502027,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00000I1YI,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[2, 3]","This film has often been the subject of negative criticism, and my response is that they are not seeing the whole picture for what it is worth. The truth is that this movie not only has comedy, suspense, and drama, but it avoids making anyone totally unlikable. This is one case where 'the car chase' allows us to gradually get to know everyone and understand their view of the situation. (Not unlike the great Shakespeare's ""Comedy of Errors."")It's basically this. Charlie Sheen was arrested for robbery, but he has escaped from prison. In desperation, he kidnaps Kristy Swanson, takes her car, and heads for Mexico. Later, we learn that he was arrested for a crime he did not commit, and that he is in fact a kind, gentle, vulnerable, and frightened man. (Later, we see just how much he cares about Kristy Swanson when he doesn't want her to ruin her life on his behalf.)The officer Henry Rollins may appear to be over zealous. And we may be tempted to see him as a villain. BUT REMEMBER, he did NOT get to know Charlie Sheen the way we did. All his character knows is that Sheen was arrested for armed robbery, that he escaped from prison, that he supposedly fired on 2 officers, that he kidnapped a woman and stole her car, and that he caused a wreck on the highway.Dalton Voss (Swanson's father) is not exactly the father of the year, but despite his faults, all he knows is that Charlie Sheen kidnapped his daughter and stole her car.What makes this movie so great is that we are obviously lead into sympathy the most for Sheen and Swanson. But if we are honest with ourselves, we know we can't hate the other characters with a clear conscience.Also worth mentioning is Charlie Sheen's benevolent and honorable lawyer, who handles his small role with dignity and talent. He wants to help everyone, but obviously, he can do little more than make a few desperate telephone calls and explain the truth of Sheen's innocence to everyone. (Probably also for the benefit of the audience as well.)Another character worth mentioning is Rocky Caroll. He narrates some of the story quite nicely for us. And the zealous television program worker is great in his own way. He offers funny (but realistic) directions about what to film, and even when a gun is being held to his head, he can only think that it's great for his program: ""Ned! Get a shot of this!"" He sure is loyal to his profession!Overall, there really is nothing to dislike about this movie. It has great convincing characters, a story that unfolds, interesting and different views of the same situation, and comedy, suspense, and some tragedy.

Just from reading the story, you might think it's boring watching a a police chase that lasts the entire length of the movie.  It's definitely not boring.

502037,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00000I1YI,JRP,"[0, 0]","Hello & welcome to this, this is another review in 20 years 2004 in film review series this is 20 years ago The Chase The Chase is a forgotten movie I won't say it's underrated. But The Chase is 1 of those movies that can be a time passer not a great comedy but I had fun with this movie. Now I am not the best at reviewing comedies but here's my review for The Chase made for $26 million only made $8 million which is pretty much a box office bomb. Directed by Adam Rifkin his only other movie I have seen was Detroit Rock City I remember having a lot of fun with that movie. It stars Charlie Sheen as Jackson Hammond, Kristy Swanson as Natalie Voss, Henry Rollins as Officer Dobbs, Josh Mostel as Officer Figus, Ray Wise as Dalton Voss, Claudia Christian as Yavonne Voss, Natalia Nogulich as Frances Voss & Marshall Bell as Ari. Story is about this man named Jackson Hammond he's escaped prison for robbery he didn't commit. He's in this stolen Volkswagon he goes to fill up at this gas station & 1 thing I have to say can we set prices back to 1994. So there's this Cashier is having trouble breaking a seal on a roll of Quarters & when he manages open them they fly everywhere & he says ""There she blows!"" 2 Cops show up which makes Jackson nervous he notices this girl & he tells The Cashier to keep the change The Cops get a call about a stolen VW The Cops ask Jackson about he says he was just out jogging The Cashier says here's you change for $5 on number 5 Jackson grabs this girl named Natalie Voss he makes it look like he has a gun behind her back which in reality is a Butterfinger Candy Bar. He makes the guy behind the counter take The Cops guns & kick them towards him only he kicks them down an aisle he makes him go & kick him to him again but then he kicks them right back to The Cops then he makes that guy just hand the guns to him 1 of the guns fall out of his coat & falls on the ground & goes off. He takes that girl & takes her car he needs her as hostage his whole plan is to get to Mexico. Then your introduced to 2 Cops Officer Dobbs & Figus who have a camera crew with them cause they're filming a type of show like Cops. Henry Rollins having fun with this role. They go in pursuit after Jackson which starts the high speed chase. Rollins says ""Let's go get us a bad guy."" The girl tells Jackson that he just have the car she tells him her Father gave her the car & you find out her Father is Dalton Voss sort of a knock off of Donald Trump. So then just about every cop is chasing after him. While he's lighting up a cigarette she takes the car lighter & burns his neck he has her stop & she drops it in the car seat between his legs which is a pretty funny reaction by Charlie Sheen. Then she throws the lighter out of the car. Charlie Sheen's reaction is ""How theh  3  l l am I suppose to smoke!?"" There's a scene where Henry Rollins is asked what it's like being a Cop he says ""It's the respect & power that the position commands. I mean I feel like a combination of Bruce Springsteen & Sylvester Stallone I don't know whether to be busting bad guys or signing autographs. It's kind of like being a star."" There's a scene where Kristy Swanson throws up he makes her put her head out the window. Jackson tells her to chew some gum afterwards & her mouth smells like her Grandmother's feet. Jackson finds out the girl he took is Natalie Voss you have a lot of news coverage. Jackson gets on The Freeway. You have this Traffic Reporter in this Helicopter get involved this guy was kind of funny I'll admit. There's a part that's really funny while Jackson is trying to evade The Cops you have this Semi that says Pacific Medical School P  M  S on it & it starts bobbing everywhere these corpses start to fly out 1 of them lands on The Cop Car Henry Rollins is driving he has his partner try to get it off so he takes his Baton & starts hitting the corpse with it. I love the way Kristy Swanson yells ""GROSS!"" She just sold it. Jackson tells Natalie he's a likable guy. She calls him a terrorist he tells her ""A terrorist has a rat  ty beard & blows up ai  r p  or  ts."" That's what I love about a lot of these old 90's movies they could be as UN PC they could be they didn't even try to be safe & clean. When Jackson finds out she is Dalton Voss's Daughter & he asks her if she knows how rich he is. I was like wtf. He says a line ""Why me why me I go in for a pack of cigarettes & a tank of gas & I wind up kidnapping The Daughter of Dalton Voss."" He says ""This whole thing has gotten way too violent I hate violence."" You have that Traffic Reporter say that this kidnapping was no happenstance. There's a scene where some Cops are trying to box Jackson in he shoots out 1 of the tires & causes a few wrecks & that Traffic Reporter says ""Those cars are coming across The Freeway like Match Box Cars!"" He says that this guy must be a Sharpshooter possibly an ex Marine. Jackson tells Natalie he didn't mean to do that.  Dalton Voss gets a hold of Jackson on the car phone. this back & forth is funny where Dalton offers $50,000 to bring his Daughter back he's like ""50,000 is all your Daughter is worth you're a billionaire that's pathetic."" You also find out in this scene there's friction between  Natalie & her Dad & her Step Mom that she wants freedom & her real Mom just wants to be her friend. She starts arguing with her Dad & Jackson interrupts & says ""Hey, hey HEY! What's a matter with you people! Your Daughter is going through a crisis & does not need to be berated like this!"" Dalton yells back ""You listen to me Hammond!"" Jackson: ""No you listen to me Dalton! Who talks to their Daughter that way!? You oughta be ashamed of yourself she's obviously fallen into an unfortunate situation here & would like just a little bit of compassion! Think about a  *  *hole."" You know I enjoy this character this was when Charlie Sheen was actually winning he uses this attitude against the media when this News Station calls in. He tells them they're just doing it for ratings. You know like in real life when a story is breaking FOX & CNN are out for the ratings & it doesn't matter what miss truths get passed around. Jackson & Natalie start to connect & she believes Jackson is innocent especially after Jackson talks to his Attorney over the phone. She wants to go with him to Mexico cause she doesn't like her life dealing with her Father & Step Mom she doesn't care for. The love story between Charlie Sheen & Kristy Swanson is a little far fetched but not as bad as the forced bad romance between Joel ""Full Performance"" Kinnaman & Abbie Cornish in Rubberman. OUCH! Then you have a News Station have an opening like it's a horror movie you're going to watch I thought that was funny. I did have fun with this movie I might like it more than I do now if I see it again cause I thought this was a pretty good movie. You have Cameos by Anthony Kiedis & Flea who cause a wreck they were some fun characters. Jackson opens up to Natalie on how he was arrested he worked as a Clown at Kids Birthday Parties & the guy who robbed the bank happened to use a clown costume as a disguise a neighbor called called the cops on him & he was arrested. There's few fun moments like when Charlie Sheen & Kristy Swanson were singing Macho Man & Henry Rollins is asked if he's ever killed anyone & he says no his partner says ""I did & I felt$****y."" You have this Reporter & Camera Man hanging on a Van they catch up to the car Jackson is driving they try try to ask Natalie if she can give them a thumbs up if she ok some kind of sign Jackson yells right here! & he flips them off. The Anchor Man in The Studio says that's the risk we take with live TV. Jackson ends up telling her back at The Gas Station he didn't hold a gun behind her back it was a Butterfinger Candy Bar. Natalie tells Jackson that her Father is probably going to use all this to try to make a run for Governor. There's a really funny scene where Anthony Kiedis & Flea are arrested. You have an interesting make out scene while Jackson is trying to drive Natalie wants to get it on. The song used in this scene isn't bad either. Jackson gets to The Mexican Border it's blocked & then you have Jackson use some moves he goes through a field leads the cops in a circle but he ends up being surrounded he gives Natalie the gun he tells her to go. He ends up thinking he thinks of about if he's gunned down so he just gives up Natalie takes the gun puts up to the head of that host of The Cops knock off. They end up taking the news chopper to escape & Jackson's Attorney is just laughing. It shows Jackson & Natalie later on a Beach in Mexico & that's pretty much the movie. Now am I saying this is a great or even a solid movie now however it's pretty good it has plenty of humor & some escapist fun to it. Adam Rifkin did a decent job directing. Charlie Sheen seemed to have it together during this time. He's better in this than anything he's done in 20 years. Kristy Swanson is decent. Henry Rollins is good. Josh Mostek is ok. Marshall Bell is nothing great. Ray Wise was ok. Cludia Christian is there as is Natalia Noglich. So it's a fun way to pass the time it's only 88 minutes so I guess give it a watch.

I know it's difficult to believe after seeing his... I'm not even sure what adjective can accurately describe the meltdown? 'Massive' doesn't cover the intensity. 'Insane' is redundant. 'Amazing' seems ghoulish, like we enjoyed it. 'Incredible' while accurate also connotes pleasure, which it most certainly wasn't.Well, whatever and however you want to describe his implosion, there was a time he was really fun to watch because of his on-screen performances.This comedy/action flick was among his best. A few years back I paid good money for a laserdisc version of this film - just so I could enjoy screening it in its original widescreen glory. That's how much fun one can have watching 'Chase'.Following the basic wrong-guy-wrong-place theme, has Charlie as an ex-convict innocently jailed for a string of robberies as the hilarious clown-costumed 'Red-Nosed Bandit'. Having being paroled, he's just trying to put his life back in order. And at the top of the list of to-do's: Stay out of trouble.Unfortunately for him, he's about to intersect with his worst nightmare in the form of beautiful Kristy Swanson. Self-absorbed, self-satisfied, and typically Northern Californian - she plays Natalie Voss, a socialite who finds herself caught in the middle of Charlie's on-going cursed life.The meeting of these two misfits begins a hilarious high speed race across California. Charile attempting to get to the Mexican border and Natalie trying to escape her suffocating ultra-wealthy father, said pater who is also running for governor. Throw in the usual stock of off-beat and nutty exaggerated characters, including a fun cameo by The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and mix well. Best served with a chilled mug, soft recliner, and a bowl of popcorn on the side.Obviously this isn't meant to be a serious film of any sort. That it is pure silliness should automatically remove criticism based on acting or storytelling. It's a fluff piece. But, and this is important, it's a FUN fluff piece. With a bounty of kooky characters and inventive gags to give this reliable formula some edged silliness. And a true sign of cult creation: Gags that were later scarped by less-creative filmmakers so that they later became Hollywood clich&eacute;s - and THAT is a feat that few films and filmmakers can claim.Had such a good time kicking back and having a few laughs with this production. There are more than enough gloomy, dark, angry and unrepentantly twisted movies out there to choke out the sun.

502042,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B00000I1YI,Poor Napoleon,"[1, 1]","Perhaps the strangest thing about the Chase is that no one paid any attention to it, yet events would unfold months later that should've had Adam Rifkin laughing as the very thing he was slighting unfolded on the television.The Chase bounces between action and comedy.  Yet the action-comedy is not in the vein of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" type humor.  It's more of a satirical slight of the justice system and the media.  Charlie Sheen plays Jack Hammond, a man on the run after a false conviction due to mishandling of evidence.  That such cases are true makes the film very poignant.  Yet after Hammond is forced to take a hostage who, unbeknownst to him, has a little bit of celebrity, cops chase after him for the duration of the film, prompting a media circuis of his every move.Rifkins characters may take thesmelves a little too seriously at times, which may have caused confusion among audience.  Hammond seems serious while the cops, swansons parents, and the media personalities seem like caricatures, which is appropriate for the satirical tone of the film.  Again, viewers didn't get this.  Perhaps the funniest bit of satire comes in the form of the two officers filming a C.O.P.S. like show.  Henry Rollins and Josh Mostel ham it up for the cameras.  Rollins, who's had many run-ins with cops he didn't particularly like, has a lot of fun with his role and gets the point across perfectly.So a little event unfolded on the news a few months later involving a police chase and a certain celebrity and the media exploded.  I remember seeing the news and thinking of this film.  While the film was supposed to be an exaggeration, it was eerily prophetic about how the media would behave in such an event.  Adam Rifkin's films usually seem a little half baked, but this was one of his fully realized films that never got the credit it deserved.  Aside from a rather predictable and lackluster ending, the film is great all around.",4,"Obviously, few people got it",1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,1935,"['Perhaps', 'strangest', 'thing', 'Chase', 'one', 'paid', 'attention', 'events', 'would', 'unfold', 'months', 'later', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Adam', 'Rifkin', 'laughing', 'very', 'thing', 'was', 'slighting', 'unfolded', 'television.The', 'Chase', 'action', 'comedy', 'action-comedy', 'not', 'vein', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'type', 'humor', 'more', 'satirical', 'slight', 'justice', 'system', 'media', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Jack', 'Hammond', 'man', 'run', 'false', 'conviction', 'due', 'mishandling', 'evidence', 'such', 'cases', 'are', 'true', 'film', 'very', 'poignant', 'Hammond', 'forced', 'take', 'hostage', 'who', 'unbeknownst', 'little', 'bit', 'celebrity', 'cops', 'chase', 'duration', 'film', 'prompting', 'media', 'circuis', 'characters', 'may', 'take', 'thesmelves', 'little', 'too', 'seriously', 'times', 'may', 'have', 'caused', 'confusion', 'audience', 'Hammond', 'serious', 'cops', 'swansons', 'parents', 'media', 'personalities', 'seem', 'caricatures', 'appropriate', 'satirical', 'tone', 'film', 'Again', 'viewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Perhaps', 'funniest', 'bit', 'satire', 'form', 'two', 'officers', 'filming', 'C.O.P.S', 'show', 'Henry', 'Rollins', 'Josh', 'Mostel', 'ham', 'up', 'cameras', 'Rollins', 'who', 'had', 'many', 'run-ins', 'cops', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'lot', 'fun', 'role', 'point', 'perfectly.So', 'little', 'event', 'unfolded', 'news', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'involving', 'police', 'chase', 'certain', 'celebrity', 'media', 'exploded', 'remember', 'seeing', 'news', 'thinking', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'exaggeration', 'was', 'eerily', 'prophetic', 'how', 'media', 'would', 'behave', 'such', 'event', 'Adam', 'Rifkin', 'films', 'usually', 'seem', 'little', 'half', 'baked', 'was', 'one', 'fully', 'realized', 'films', 'never', 'got', 'credit', 'deserved', 'Aside', 'rather', 'predictable', 'lackluster', 'ending', 'film', 'great', 'around']",N/A

Doozy premise, but semi-cleverly executed. And if you think it's too unrealistic, how about the live videos we see in TV numbers such as ""Cops""?The movie squarely points a caustic finger at news-hungry media folks perpetually on the prowl for that next sensational carrion.

For a couple weeks we have been blessed with some of the greatest dialogue in Charlie Sheen's career. This of course coming from his insane rants on every possible radio and news station possible. The guys is either totally insane or pure genius, at this point the line is blurred. As far as were concerned Charlie Sheen is operating in another realm of consciousness that demands a review from the worlds greatest B enthusiasts. ""I came out of the womb dead, the Doctor kept slapping me until finally a cry rang out. Once it did I looked at the doctor and said bring it!""-this is an actual quote.In 1994 Charlie Sheen was a more sane version if his present self, and gave one top notch performance in the action/comedy The Chase. We were physced to get our first Sheen B in and further more were able to add another 90's flick to the library. Charlie plays a man sentenced to life in prison named Jack Hamond, who managed to escape from the long d*** of the law. To attempt to keep his temporary freedom, he takes a smoking hot chick hostage by using her BMW for a high speed chase. The entire movie really takes place in this car, and somehow turns into a love story in a bizarre twist. A nice touch was having Henry Rolling as the main cop. This brought us back to when Beavis and Butthead watched his ""liar"" video forcing plenty of laughs.So in the end we were very pleased with The Chase, but feel his best work came from his recent 20/20 interview where we learned of his bitchin' rock star lifestyle. This guy had never really appeared on Sid's radar, even though it was foretold by a little elf from our past who insisted that Charlie Sheen was B. Somehow he turned out to be right. Charlie Sheen really is B, who would have guessed. Obviously we knew Uncle Joe Estevez is a B legend but never considered Charlie to contest the crown. What's great about this factor is the Charlie Sheen market of B has just become a major interest of Sid the Elf. I guess B really does run in the family.",4,I've got tiger blood flowing through me and the genes of an adonis,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,2182,"['Sid', 'typically', ""n't"", 'one', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'involved', 'flavor', 'month', 'when', 'flavor', 'be', 'man', 'making', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'look', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'really', 'have', 'choice', 'couple', 'weeks', 'have', 'been', 'blessed', 'greatest', 'dialogue', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'career', 'course', 'coming', 'insane', 'rants', 'possible', 'radio', 'news', 'station', 'possible', 'guys', 'totally', 'insane', 'pure', 'genius', 'point', 'line', 'blurred', 'As', 'far', 'were', 'concerned', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'operating', 'realm', 'consciousness', 'review', 'worlds', 'greatest', 'B', 'enthusiasts', 'came', 'out', 'womb', 'dead', 'Doctor', 'kept', 'slapping', 'finally', 'cry', 'rang', 'did', 'looked', 'doctor', 'said', 'bring', '-this', 'actual', 'quote.In', '1994', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'was', 'more', 'sane', 'version', 'present', 'self', 'gave', 'one', 'top', 'notch', 'performance', 'action/comedy', 'Chase', 'were', 'physced', 'get', 'first', 'Sheen', 'B', 'further', 'more', 'were', 'able', 'add', '90', 'flick', 'library', 'Charlie', 'man', 'sentenced', 'life', 'prison', 'named', 'Jack', 'Hamond', 'who', 'managed', 'escape', 'long', 'd***', 'law', 'attempt', 'keep', 'temporary', 'freedom', 'smoking', 'hot', 'chick', 'hostage', 'using', 'BMW', 'high', 'speed', 'chase', 'entire', 'movie', 'really', 'place', 'car', 'somehow', 'love', 'story', 'bizarre', 'twist', 'nice', 'touch', 'was', 'having', 'Henry', 'Rolling', 'main', 'cop', 'brought', 'back', 'when', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'watched', 'liar', 'video', 'forcing', 'plenty', 'laughs.So', 'end', 'were', 'very', 'pleased', 'Chase', 'feel', 'best', 'work', 'came', 'recent', '20/20', 'interview', 'where', 'learned', 'bitchin', 'rock', 'star', 'lifestyle', 'guy', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'appeared', 'Sid', 'radar', 'even', 'was', 'foretold', 'little', 'elf', 'past', 'who', 'insisted', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'was', 'B', 'Somehow', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'right', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'really', 'B', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'Obviously', 'knew', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'Estevez', 'B', 'legend', 'never', 'considered', 'Charlie', 'contest', 'crown', 'What', 'great', 'factor', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'market', 'B', 'just', 'become', 'major', 'interest', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'guess', 'B', 'really', 'run', 'family']",N/A

502049,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00000I1YI,wellwellwell,"[4, 6]","This movie may be one of those movies you'll hate to love.  The plot of the movie is simple and unoriginal, yet you'll find yourself really getting into it.  The movie begins with the introduction of Jack Hammond (Charlie Sheen), who's background we know little about.  But we do know he is a criminal of some sort; on the run.  And as he stops for gas (with a stolen car) he is noticed by two cops.  He panics and kidnaps the girl standing next to him (Kristy Swanson, the original 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'), and takes off.As it turns out, midway through the freeway car chase, Hammond was found guilty of a crime that he didn't commit.  And he does anything and everything to keep from getting caught.  The movie does provide for a few satisfactory surprises, but for the most part you'll know what's going to happen.  And while all this is going on--the fighting between Hammond and Natalie Voss (Swanson)--they begin to fall in love.  And if you think that sounds impractical or just plain stupid, you're right.  But you have to realize: without the cheap love you really have no movie.  So you must look beyond the sometimes too-fake plot in order to enjoy the movie.As you can imagine, you'll find yourself saying ""yeah right"" during certain parts of the movie.  And the 'sex' scene (if you want to call it that) is so horrible you will laugh out loud.  I won't spoil the fun for you, though.  All in all, 'The Chase' is a pretty average film with no plotline.  But on a brighter note, the cast is very diverse.  Aside from Sheen and Swanson, you have Henry Rollins (singer of Rollins' Band) and Josh Mostel (who you may remember from smaller parts in 'Big Daddy' and 'Billy Madison'); both of which who play the cops following the car.  Also, there's Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea and Anthony Kiedis.'The Chase' is a decent movie, one that may go overlooked.  But if you enjoy Charlie Sheen's work, or have always been intrigued by those infamous high-speed chases, you will enjoy this movie.  It got 3 stars from me because there's really no plot and it's mostly unoriginal.
