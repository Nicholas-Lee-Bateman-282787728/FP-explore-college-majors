If it had been made by a cast of high-school kids still cutting their comedy teeth, it might be noteworthy, but the only thing remarkable about it is the extent to which the production team went to fool the mentally-challenged Caravello.  The actual material isn't creative, isn't imaginative, and isn't entertaining.

1003752,A17E28QEX42YU0,B000GG4Y2S,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[11, 12]","If one had to rate something merely on ambition, 'Windy City Heat' would, without question, deserve five stars.  It is perhaps both the best and worst example of cinematic exploitation I've ever seen, and because I've become so desensitized over the course of my life, I commend the film far more for the former than the latter.Now the question of whether this is 'real' or a [...] has come up, and frankly here's my thoughts on it: it's real, or at least, most of it is.  If anyone is doubtful of this, they need but to watch the extra features on the DVD.  Perry Caravello, the real-life 'actor' and the film's focal point for mockery, is indeed a real person.  In 'Windy City Heat', he plays the role of himself, to us, the audience; to his deluded mind, he plays the role of 'Stone Fury', the star of a Hollywood action film in the making.  Questions inevitably arise because, naturally, anyone with half a brain watches with utmost skepticism.  Surely nobody in Caravello's position could be so ignorant of the events that take place?  But, yes, somebody could -- Caravello himself. The story, as one becomes familiar with through the extra features, goes a bit like this:The two guys who play Caravello's sidekicks in 'Windy City Heat' (the absurd, fake film) -- Tony Barbieri as ""Mole"" and Don Barris as ""Big Lou"" -- have actually been screwing around with him for like, a decade. This becomes apparent as one views the extra footage on the dvd, which demonstrates short clips of Barbieri and Barris harassing Caravello, all the way back to 1996. And it's not staged... completely real.  Barbieri and Barris -- who I might add are ...awesome... here -- are the type of guys who transcend shame and empathy for outrageous, condescending comedy at the sake of a mentally challenged 'entertainer', in this case Caravello.  They had basically mastered this circus act over many years, and that it all comes together so perfectly in this film isn't quite as perplexing when you're able to understand this.  And, again -- especially after viewing the films numerous times; I have seen it four -- one ultimately realizes that Caravello is, in many respects, retarded; his obviously demented behavior lends credibility to the whole 'it's real' thing.  If, in fact, Caravello 'was' performing all of this as an act, I'd personally think him to be the next Pacino, because no Human being can emulate a persona like his so utterly convincing.And so, the joke goes on from there.  Everyone in the film takes stabs at the situation, and while it's usually hit and miss, it's always entertaining if only for the premise.  Take, for example, Perry getting thrown into a dumpster of manurer for a 'more realistic approach'.  Or Perry chugging a blended pizza, donut, and beer not once, but twice for a scene.  And these are just the most obvious examples of how they mentally screw with the guy; subtle gags literally run through the entire thing, rarely letting up.  My favorite, personally, is when they get to the ""merchandising"" of the film, and each of the three leads are shown their action figures.  Mole and Big Lou's are presented first, completely normal and visually representative of themselves; Perry, on the other hand -- after a drum role by the crew, to add effect -- is shown his figure... the most grotesque little doll imaginable, with a green face, huge gut, his face gawking sideways, seemingly ready to hurl.  The figure is ""so"" impeccably perfect that just the thought gets me rolling.  Perry's reaction is cut quickly but obvious -- he doesn't know what to make of it, but is somewhat sure that something isn't right.The film needs to be seen to be respected, though it's definitely not for everyone.  The bottom line is most of us 'DO' find this stuff hilarious, even if it's in bad taste. There are a variety of human beings on this Earth, some smart, some not so smart.  It's part of the ever-progressing humor we seem to take on as a whole collective these days; cynical mockery of the bizarre circumstances found within the reality we live in.  And hey, if a guy like Caravello can make it through this impossible set of circumstances shown in the film, I'm pretty confident that, at whatever point he found out the trick was on him, he didn't sink into an everlasting state of psychological despair.If 'Windy City Heat' were more consistent through its run, I'd be honored to award it five stars.  Due to its sheer originality and its stunning ability to ACTUALLY PULL IT OFF, I really want to give it a perfect rating, but alas it is slow at times without much laughs for often minutes at a time.  But when it strikes, oh lord how it strikes the most radiant of gold.Update: I was just reading about Perry's life, and I don't know if this information is correct, but it's been said that he was actually an intelligent, suave, good guy, but was in an automobile accident in late high school. This really makes me sad, actually, and I'm really interested in this weird guy now. Anyway, I just found it strangely profound, that he's possibly this way because of horrible circumstances early in his life, pondering the thought of how his 'previous' being -- before the brain damage -- would look upon all of this.

This is ""Scary"" Perry Caravello.Perry stars as Stone Fury in the production of ""Windy City Heat,"" and he thinks it's going to be huge.  In fact, he mentions the Oscar's and thinks he beat out Brad Pitt, Schwarzenegger, and Harrison Ford for the role.

It's completely hilarious how he thinks he's a megastar upon his first day on set, yet everyone involved treats him like garbage.  The set assistants put him in a raggedy trailer.  The costume design people mistakenly dress him in The merchandising people make his doll look morbidly obese.  The director has Perry thrown in a dumpster filled with manure.  The abuse this guy mindlessly takes is brilliant, and he deserves every bit of it.

Congratulations goes out to everyone involved in setting this guy up like the Sissy Spacek inCarrie.Extras: Make sure you watch the extra of Perry and his two friends reviewing the DVD - called ""The Reveal"" - for the first time.

As mind-boggling as it is hilarious.The real movie does not exist, yet in his commentary (done two years later), Perry talks about 'getting the role' genuinely as if it was all for real.  Though he does also make reference to it being like a reality show, he still thinks most of the situations were for real (BTW, you have to check out Burt Ward's appearance in the commentary).At least I don't have to feel bad for Perry about what they did to him.  Hell, they gave him a wonderful ride.  In an extra, we see him watch the film with Mole and Barris (this film, not the 'real' one), and he has a glimmer in his eye every time he his honored (i.e. 'getting the role' and being given an award by the 'President of Show Business'--in fact, he gets choked up seeing the 'President's' award in the commentary).Knowing him so well for so long, I believe Don and 'Mole' knew what they could get away with without Perry either catching on or being crushed in the end.  Which is apparantly ANYTHING.He does seem to get a few things ('Roman Polanski,' Charlton Heston being fake, some of the pranks they played on him), but his thought to this day is that it was overall mostly genuine.I am just glad to see that at the end of the commentary he feels his dreams were fulfilled.

As the fake movie is being made, many pranks are played on Perry, such as making him be thrown into a dumpster full of manure to add `realism', making him think the movie wont be finished because he wasn't able to guard a table of doughnuts, to him getting an award from the president of show business. He never catches on. The movie is filled with laughs and shocks. My roommate made me buy this so I'd watch it. While I was starting to watch it, I had no clue what I was in for, but after a few minutes in, I could tell this was a masterpiece. I almost feel bad for laughing at Perry, but, the way he acts, I just couldn't help myself. And good god, don't make him mad. When he screams, he sounds like a 13 year old girl not getting her way. His voice gets so high it's hilarious. I honestly don't see how he stays friends with Tony and Don. But it seems like he doesn't even remember the stuff they do to him after a few minutes. Many cameos are in here such as Dane Cook being a casting director, Bobcat Goldthwait (directing the movie we watch and the movie Perry is in), Adam Carolla, Jimmy Kimmel, Carson Daily (which provokes a great line I can't type here from Perry), and even ex-NFL lineman Refrigerator Perry.I don't think this is for everyone, but man I found it hilarious. I definitely recommend a must rent. Make sure you watch the extras too for more laughs. Also, while I'm sure this is funny alone, this movie is perfect for viewing with friends... and beer.P.S. - Perry says one of the funniest and most shocking things I think I've ever heard on camera. Seriously, who says that when they know they are being filmed? If you want me to say it I'll say it in my comments, but otherwise, it's close to end, and you will DEFINITELY know what I'm talking about when he says it. I rewound it three times to hear him say it.
