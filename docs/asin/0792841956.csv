147295,A3TLY1A7NGVCQM,0792841956,"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP""","[20, 24]","I saw this in the theater when it came out and anxiously awaited the sequels. This is one movie where the sequel would have probably been a much better movie if for no other reason than actors and director would get into The Destroyer legend.I loved the books at least up until Richard Sapir passed away. The books were fun, funny and contained much social satire. They were gems of wit and wisdom.Basically it is about a cop recruited to be a supersecret agent for the government for an agency called CURE. The theory being that the President needed a tool to combat evil that could be fought only by violating the Constitution. Of course Presidents now boast about violating the constitution but these stories are from a more innocent age.In the movie Fred Ward is perfectly cast as Remo Williams named in a very amusing way - ""We put a lot of thought into it.""Joel Gray does a marvelous job of Chiun the Master of Sinanju the latest in a line of assasins dating back a millenia or two. Sinanju being the ""sun source of all martial arts"".Wilford Brimly is probably the biggest departure from the books cast as Harold Smith. In the series Smith was a much more interesting character and the interplay between him and Remo is always entertaining.Overall the plot was weak. Iw ould have rather had them adapt one of the many stories from the book series. I just never felt that Grove was that evil a guy worthy of accelerating Remo's mission. Patrick Kilpatrick was a great villan - muscle man ""Stone"". I particularly enjoyed the scene where Remo uses Stone's special feature to escape from a gas chamber.The film was well structured I thought with equal amounts of Remo's training and mission, Joel Gray doing a wonderful Chiun, soap operas and all.I thought it was a good first effort. Had they kept it up I am sure they would have gotten the hang of it and the movies gotten better and better.I downrated the DVD mainly because of the format. so-called ""fullscreen"" is really only a half a screen. I did not buy the DVD just for that reason. I have an old copy on Betamax that I still watch twice a year or so.There are no significant bonus features on the disk as was pointed out by a previous reviewer. This is just about inexcusable these days.If my Beta tape ever weasr out I may be forced to buy a disk, but until then maybe MGM will get their heads out of you know where and re-release this movie properly.",4,I loved it,1058400000,"07 17, 2003",2003,2414,"['saw', 'theater', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'sequels', 'one', 'movie', 'where', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'other', 'reason', 'actors', 'director', 'would', 'get', 'Destroyer', 'legend.I', 'loved', 'books', 'least', 'up', 'Richard', 'Sapir', 'passed', 'away', 'books', 'were', 'fun', 'funny', 'contained', 'much', 'social', 'satire', 'were', 'gems', 'wit', 'wisdom.Basically', 'cop', 'recruited', 'be', 'supersecret', 'agent', 'government', 'agency', 'called', 'CURE', 'theory', 'being', 'President', 'needed', 'tool', 'combat', 'evil', 'could', 'be', 'fought', 'only', 'violating', 'Constitution', 'course', 'Presidents', 'now', 'boast', 'violating', 'constitution', 'stories', 'are', 'more', 'innocent', 'movie', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Remo', 'Williams', 'named', 'very', 'amusing', 'way', 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'Joel', 'Gray', 'marvelous', 'job', 'Chiun', 'Master', 'Sinanju', 'latest', 'line', 'assasins', 'dating', 'back', 'millenia', 'two', 'being', 'sun', 'source', 'martial', 'arts', '.Wilford', 'Brimly', 'probably', 'biggest', 'departure', 'books', 'cast', 'Harold', 'Smith', 'series', 'Smith', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'interplay', 'Remo', 'always', 'entertaining.Overall', 'plot', 'was', 'weak', 'Iw', 'ould', 'have', 'rather', 'had', 'adapt', 'one', 'many', 'stories', 'book', 'series', 'just', 'never', 'felt', 'Grove', 'was', 'guy', 'worthy', 'accelerating', 'Remo', 'mission', 'Patrick', 'Kilpatrick', 'was', 'great', 'villan', 'muscle', 'man', 'Stone', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'where', 'Remo', 'Stone', 'special', 'feature', 'escape', 'gas', 'chamber.The', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'structured', 'thought', 'equal', 'amounts', 'Remo', 'training', 'mission', 'Joel', 'Gray', 'doing', 'wonderful', 'Chiun', 'soap', 'operas', 'all.I', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'first', 'effort', 'Had', 'kept', 'up', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'hang', 'movies', 'gotten', 'better', 'better.I', 'downrated', 'DVD', 'mainly', 'format', 'so-called', 'fullscreen', 'really', 'only', 'half', 'screen', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', 'just', 'reason', 'have', 'old', 'copy', 'Betamax', 'still', 'watch', 'twice', 'year', 'are', 'significant', 'bonus', 'features', 'disk', 'was', 'pointed', 'out', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'just', 'about', 'inexcusable', 'days.If', 'Beta', 'tape', 'ever', 'weasr', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'forced', 'buy', 'disk', 'then', 'maybe', 'MGM', 'will', 'get', 'heads', 'know', 'where', 're-release', 'movie', 'properly']",N/A
147296,AI37X1O7K72FZ,0792841956,Anti-Hipster,"[0, 0]","""Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"" is an action/comedy with meager helpings of action and comedy. It is not very funny, and there isn't a whole lot of action. There is some excellent stuntwork - particularly the scene where Remo has to dodge cars on a Ferris wheel - but not much else to recommend it.The movie fails to strike a balance between action and comedy. This works in Arnold Schwartzenegger's movies, which are first and foremost action pictures with little quips thrown in for levity. It doesn't work here because the movie can't decide what it wants to be. Half of the movie is slapstick comedy, while the other half is action oriented.After a goofy apprenticeship with an Oriental martial arts instructor, Remo goes after a corrupt military official in some very tepid action scenes. They're not all bad - there is one exciting scene where he escapes from some Doberman Pinschers. But thrilling scenes are sparse in Remo Williams. Chuck Norris movies, as bad as they were, delivered more action, with more pizazz, than this movie.It is hard to see what audience this was made for. It's not an ""edge-of-your-seat, white-knuckle thrill-ride"" of the sort Stallone and Schwartzenegger routinely starred in. It's even worse as a comedy.

I have had it on my shelf for years and regularly someone picks it up and watches it. My stepsons that were young teens when they first viewed it and are now grown men enjoy it as well. Even my wife and other women find it entertaining. So much so we decided to name our new Tonkinese ""Chiun, Master of Sinaju"". Although I was never crazy about Kate Mulgrews performance it does by no means kill the movie. What killed this movie is the time in which it was released. The public didn't want a fantasy film as much then. It came across that way with the dodging bullets and walking on water. Over the years it has developed a following from fans of the book series, and people like myself that find it entertaining. This movie never takes itself very serious so critics, especially the one they have as the opening review, needs to lighten up. They obviously take themselves way to serious. I continue to hope they will bring this out on DVD since my VHS copy is showing it's age, not to mention DVD sound and picture quality are always better than VHS. If you somehow have missed this one, rent it and you will see an 80s movie that may be a bit dated but will still entertain like the older James Bond movies.

147302,A2OSERGXBYMPJ0,0792841956,C. T. Mikesell,"[0, 0]","First off, this isn't a great movie - it's a B-movie. It's not even a great B-movie, like Tremors (also starring Fred Ward), but it still gets a B for effort.The film's plot centers around a Star Chamber-esque group and their new hit-man recruit, Remo Williams (Ward), who they set on the trail of a corrupt government contractor (Charles ""Section Chief Blevins on the X-Files"" Cioffi). Williams receives training from a nationalistic, misogynistic and heavily made-up Chiun (Joel Grey). Kate Mulgrew plays Army Major Fleming, who is conducting a separate investigation of the government contractor and, after a moment's hesitation, teams up with Remo.None of the actors in this movie are quite brand-name, but nobody phones in their performance, either. As is the case with Charles Cioffi, you'll spend a lot of time picking out familiar faces and asking ""Where have I seen him before?"" Sure you can frequently see Ward's harness rig during his stuntwork, but that's not his fault: I certainly wouldn't get on that ferris wheel without a wire, so it's unfortunate that a little more time and money weren't spent in post-production (the stuntwork throughout the movie suffers from inadequate post-production work).Problems aside, this is a good rainy-day, kill-two-hours popcorn movie. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end; there's character development; and plenty of things explode. If you approach it with the viewpoint of ""this is a school play of a film that others have done better,"" you'll find this movie enjoyable, because really that's what it is.",4,Veteran Character Actors in a Journeyman Effort,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,1561,"['First', 'off', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'B-movie', 'not', 'even', 'great', 'B-movie', 'Tremors', 'also', 'starring', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'still', 'B', 'effort.The', 'film', 'plot', 'centers', 'Star', 'Chamber-esque', 'group', 'new', 'hit-man', 'recruit', 'Remo', 'Williams', 'Ward', 'who', 'set', 'trail', 'corrupt', 'government', 'contractor', 'Charles', 'Section', 'Chief', 'Blevins', 'X-Files', 'Cioffi', 'Williams', 'training', 'nationalistic', 'misogynistic', 'heavily', 'made-up', 'Chiun', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Army', 'Major', 'Fleming', 'who', 'conducting', 'separate', 'investigation', 'government', 'contractor', 'moment', 'hesitation', 'up', 'Remo.None', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'brand-name', 'nobody', 'phones', 'performance', 'either', 'case', 'Charles', 'Cioffi', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'picking', 'out', 'familiar', 'asking', 'Where', 'have', 'seen', 'can', 'frequently', 'see', 'Ward', 'harness', 'rig', 'stuntwork', 'not', 'fault', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'ferris', 'wheel', 'wire', 'unfortunate', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'money', 'were', ""n't"", 'spent', 'post-production', 'stuntwork', 'movie', 'suffers', 'inadequate', 'post-production', 'work', 'aside', 'good', 'rainy-day', 'kill-two-hours', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'character', 'development', 'plenty', 'things', 'explode', 'approach', 'viewpoint', 'school', 'play', 'film', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'better', ""'ll"", 'find', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'really', 'what']",N/A
147303,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,0792841956,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[9, 11]","When this movie was released in the UK they wisely dropped the subhead ""The Adventure begins..."" because it was clear by the time the movie had made it across the Atlantic that the movie series began and ended here...and that's a shame.In the directors chair for this movie was Guy Hamilton, who was undoubtedly the perfect choice to direct having several of the best James Bond movies (including the classic ""Goldfinger"" from 1964) under his belt. However, by the time the camera's rolled on REMO Hamilton had been out of the 007 business for over 10 years, with his last James Bond movie being 1974's ""The Man With the Golden Gun,"" and here he was trying to launch a lesser known literary hero (from The Destroyer series by Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir) onto the big screen. Still, he does manage to do a serviceable job.Fred Ward does a good job too, fresh from his role in the fantastic ""The Right Stuff"" and Joel Grey is his usual wonderful self as Chiun, the Korean master who puts Remo through his paces in the martial art Sinanju (which includes the rather useful skill of being able to dodge bullets.)And this, ironically, is where the movie really falters. For much the same reason why the initial book in the series this character is based on (Created, the Destroyer) it's an origin story and so it spends too much time introducing the characters and covering the training. There are some spectacular scenes (including a fight atop the Statue of Liberty) but they feel a little muted, tame and underwhelming amid the action spectacles of Indiana Jones. In fact the lackluster pace seems at times more fitting for a weekly television series instead of the big-screen extravaganza it should have been.The plot involves the ""death"" of one character and his rebirth as the title character. Following his death at the hands of some hoods a New York police officer awakens in a hospital bed with a new name and a new face. Initially reluctant to accept the situation he finds himself in he is eventually coerced into working for the secret government agency CURE. Headed by Smith (whom Chiun insists on calling ""Emperor Smith"") who is played by Wilford Brimley, the agency is one of those ultra-secret mechanisms of the United States government that answers only to the President. Here, they are involved in investigating a crooked defense contractor (played with relish by Charles Cioffi), a mission which brings Remo into contact with Maj. Rayner Fleming (playedby  pre-Voyager Kate Mulgrew) as an Army officer who is suspicious of the defense contractor. It is in the final moments of the movie that it finally picks up as Remo battles an entire army base in his quest to uncover the truth and bring the contractor to justice.It's a shame there was no sequel made to this movie as the literary series really did not take off until the third novel ""Chinese Puzzle."" And given the fact that there is so much talent behind and in front of the camera it's a surprise that it ended up the way it did. Perhaps now, with the movie theater's screens full of origin stories, from ""Batman Begins"" to the granddaddy of fictional secret agents James Bond in his first mission (""Casino Royale""), the time is right to attempt to launch this series again - it would certainly get my vote.Unfortunately we get a bare-bones DVD release. It would be nice if we could at some point get a more deluxe release, but this will do for now.Recommended.",4,"The adventure begins....and ends, with this entertaining movie",1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,3438,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'UK', 'wisely', 'dropped', 'subhead', 'Adventure', 'was', 'clear', 'time', 'movie', 'had', 'made', 'Atlantic', 'movie', 'series', 'began', 'ended', 'here', 'shame.In', 'directors', 'chair', 'movie', 'was', 'Guy', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'perfect', 'choice', 'direct', 'having', 'several', 'best', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'including', 'classic', 'Goldfinger', '1964', 'belt', 'However', 'time', 'camera', 'rolled', 'REMO', 'Hamilton', 'had', 'been', '007', 'business', '10', 'years', 'last', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'being', '1974', 'Man', 'Golden', 'Gun', 'here', 'was', 'trying', 'launch', 'lesser', 'known', 'literary', 'hero', 'Destroyer', 'series', 'Warren', 'Murphy', 'Richard', 'Sapir', 'big', 'screen', 'Still', 'manage', 'do', 'serviceable', 'job.Fred', 'Ward', 'good', 'job', 'too', 'fresh', 'role', 'fantastic', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'usual', 'wonderful', 'self', 'Chiun', 'Korean', 'master', 'who', 'Remo', 'paces', 'martial', 'art', 'Sinanju', 'rather', 'useful', 'skill', 'being', 'able', 'dodge', 'bullets', 'ironically', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'falters', 'much', 'same', 'reason', 'why', 'initial', 'book', 'series', 'character', 'based', 'Created', 'Destroyer', 'origin', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'introducing', 'characters', 'covering', 'training', 'are', 'spectacular', 'scenes', 'including', 'fight', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'feel', 'little', 'muted', 'tame', 'underwhelming', 'action', 'spectacles', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'fact', 'lackluster', 'pace', 'times', 'more', 'fitting', 'weekly', 'television', 'series', 'instead', 'big-screen', 'extravaganza', 'should', 'have', 'been.The', 'plot', 'death', 'one', 'character', 'rebirth', 'title', 'character', 'Following', 'death', 'hands', 'hoods', 'New', 'York', 'police', 'officer', 'awakens', 'hospital', 'bed', 'new', 'name', 'new', 'face', 'Initially', 'reluctant', 'accept', 'situation', 'eventually', 'coerced', 'working', 'secret', 'government', 'agency', 'CURE', 'Headed', 'Smith', 'whom', 'Chiun', 'calling', 'Emperor', 'Smith', 'who', 'played', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'agency', 'one', 'ultra-secret', 'mechanisms', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'only', 'President', 'Here', 'are', 'involved', 'investigating', 'crooked', 'defense', 'contractor', 'played', 'relish', 'Charles', 'Cioffi', 'mission', 'Remo', 'contact', 'Maj.', 'Rayner', 'Fleming', 'playedby', 'pre-Voyager', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Army', 'officer', 'who', 'suspicious', 'defense', 'contractor', 'final', 'moments', 'movie', 'finally', 'up', 'Remo', 'entire', 'army', 'base', 'quest', 'uncover', 'truth', 'bring', 'contractor', 'justice.It', 'shame', 'was', 'sequel', 'made', 'movie', 'literary', 'series', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'off', 'third', 'novel', 'Chinese', 'Puzzle', 'given', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'surprise', 'ended', 'up', 'way', 'did', 'Perhaps', 'now', 'movie', 'theater', 'screens', 'full', 'origin', 'stories', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'granddaddy', 'fictional', 'secret', 'agents', 'James', 'Bond', 'first', 'mission', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'time', 'right', 'attempt', 'launch', 'series', 'again', 'would', 'certainly', 'get', 'vote.Unfortunately', 'get', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', 'release', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'could', 'point', 'get', 'more', 'deluxe', 'release', 'will', 'do', 'now.Recommended']",N/A

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","Enough has been written here about this typical action film, but an ignored beauty is Joel Grey's deft performance of an old Korean master. Though in heavy makeup (Grey is not as ancient as the character Master Chuun) Grey was commended for the most sensitive and accurate performance of an Asian character by a white actor. Sounds racist, but the critics at the time really meant it. Yellowface was still in vogue. Very true to the culture, from his accent to the attitude that women are fairly worthless, from his love of soaps to his love of assassination, Grey nails this character. I doubt that the great Keye Luke himself could have done it better. Since America had only cheap Chinese ""kung-fu"" films, and samurai films were limited to Kurosawa's output, ""Remo Williams"" is not so bad. Jackie Chan had a small cult following then, and his films were a delight, but I was there when ""Remo"" was newly released, and I was jaded by all there was to see from Asia. Yet ""Remo"" moved me. It showed me a good time, and didn't kill me at the box office or when I originally bought it on VHS. Few youngsters today realize the impact it had on the martial arts genre American-style.

Whereas lesser films would have thrown in a training montage across three minutes of film, Remo's lasts ninety. And it's not even over. Never &quot;ready&quot; to be unleashed as the assassin he's meant to be, Remo Williams spends the entirety of the film under Chiun's tutelage, forced into action only by circumstance. Only in the final minutes does he seem ready to begin the life he has been designed for.How does this affect the film? Well, it will feel downright slow for the Fast and Furious generation weaned on quick-cut, shallow films like XXX which speed along from one explosion to the next. For those of us who used to read way back when and enjoyed seeing these pulpy characters fleshed out onscreen - as well as those of us who dug Kung Fu Theatre on Sunday afternoons (check out KILL BILL Vol 2's &quot;Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mai&quot; sequence for the heavy influence of Chiun), it means this is a simultaneous delight and letdown (the latter only because, realistically, we know there will never be a sequel to continue this story).My only other minor criticism of REMO WILLIAMS is its relatively bloodless onscreen presentation. Not that I'm looking for gore, but for an assassination film, this one is very tame. On the upside, one could feel very comfortable sharing this film with pre-teen action enthusiasts.The REMO WILLIAMS DVD is a bare bones, full-screen affair, but at its bargain price, who can really complain?

147312,A2D0CM6EQ9N59J,0792841956,Jake Phillips,"[0, 0]","Okay . . . when I was a kid, I loved this movie.  Then, completely by accident, I chanced upon the 'Destroyer' series of action novels (Think 'Mack Bolan, the Executioner', only written by smart people) and I came to love this movie so much more.  Nowadays, when superpowerful martial artists are uncommonly common in the cinema, this movie may seem like old news.  But consider this: since the 1960's the characters and situations adapted for this flick have inspired more ripoffs than anything else EVER, and when this movie was made, these ideas were still fresh.  The Destroyer novels have concepts that have later been seen in 'Terminator',  'Matrix', Japanimation, 'Karate Kid', and many spy flicks, just to name a few.  The movie takes major liberties with the basics of Remo's origins, but the essential characters and situations remain unaltered, especially the dysfunctional father-son dynamic between Remo and his mentor, the gifted but insensitive and arrogant Chiun, masterfully portrayed by dancer Joel Grey.If this movie had been made today, the special effects would finally have caught up with the ideas and storyline.  As it is, they do the best they can with the limited techniques, budget, and imagination of action movies of the time.Bottom line: this movie has heart.  You can't help but love Remo, and especially Chiun, as they bicker their way thru events that could shatter the nation (and by extension, the world).  The action could be better by today's standards, but the faithfulness to a pop cultural icon must be applauded.  This film is funny, frisky, and just plain entertaining from start to finish.Oh, and just to cover some questions raised by other reviews: even if you have an all-powerful septuagenarian, Korean killer on your hands, if you want an effective SECRET agant, you'd need an 'Everyman'.  You know, a guy who can blend in to a crowd (don't think I'm sexist by saying 'guy'.  Sinanju is sexist by only training men.  In the film, Chiun suggests that ""Women should stay home and make babies.  Preferably manchild."")  Remo is that Everyman, and so much more.  Check this one out.  The DVD itself could be better, but considering how old this flick is, it's understood that there would be a limit to what could be put together for it.  The film's a B+, the DVD is a C, but only because this is a film from the decline of cinema, before CGI and a burgeoning home video market revitalized the action genre.FLAWS: they don't kill enough.  I'm not one for gratuitous violence, but this is a film about an ancient society of superpowerful assassins, and you'd expect more deaths.  In fact, there are scenes depicting what are OBVIOUSLY deaths that then have extraneous footage afterwards to show that no one has died (Watch the scene on the industrial elevator, Statue of Liberty footage, and tell me if that guy was HUNG, or just hung UP).WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3,Ahead of it's time . . . and then some,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,2944,"['Okay', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'loved', 'movie', 'Then', 'completely', 'accident', 'chanced', ""'Destroyer"", 'series', 'action', 'novels', 'Think', ""'Mack"", 'Bolan', 'Executioner', 'only', 'written', 'smart', 'people', 'came', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Nowadays', 'when', 'superpowerful', 'martial', 'artists', 'are', 'uncommonly', 'common', 'cinema', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'old', 'news', 'consider', '1960', 'characters', 'situations', 'adapted', 'flick', 'have', 'inspired', 'more', 'ripoffs', 'anything', 'else', 'EVER', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'ideas', 'were', 'still', 'fresh', 'Destroyer', 'novels', 'have', 'concepts', 'have', 'later', 'been', 'seen', ""'Terminator"", ""'Matrix"", 'Japanimation', ""'Karate"", 'Kid', 'many', 'spy', 'flicks', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'movie', 'major', 'liberties', 'basics', 'Remo', 'origins', 'essential', 'characters', 'situations', 'remain', 'unaltered', 'especially', 'dysfunctional', 'father-son', 'dynamic', 'Remo', 'mentor', 'gifted', 'insensitive', 'arrogant', 'Chiun', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'dancer', 'Joel', 'Grey.If', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'today', 'special', 'effects', 'would', 'finally', 'have', 'caught', 'up', 'ideas', 'storyline', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'limited', 'techniques', 'budget', 'imagination', 'action', 'movies', 'time.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'heart', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'Remo', 'especially', 'Chiun', 'bicker', 'way', 'events', 'could', 'shatter', 'nation', 'extension', 'world', 'action', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'today', 'standards', 'faithfulness', 'pop', 'cultural', 'icon', 'must', 'be', 'applauded', 'film', 'funny', 'frisky', 'just', 'plain', 'entertaining', 'start', 'finish.Oh', 'just', 'cover', 'questions', 'raised', 'other', 'reviews', 'even', 'have', 'all-powerful', 'septuagenarian', 'Korean', 'killer', 'hands', 'want', 'effective', 'SECRET', 'agant', ""'d"", 'need', ""'Everyman"", 'know', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'blend', 'crowd', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'sexist', 'saying', ""'guy"", 'Sinanju', 'sexist', 'only', 'training', 'men', 'film', 'Chiun', 'Women', 'should', 'stay', 'home', 'make', 'babies', 'Preferably', 'manchild', 'Remo', 'Everyman', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Check', 'one', 'out', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'considering', 'how', 'old', 'flick', 'understood', 'would', 'be', 'limit', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'B+', 'DVD', 'C', 'only', 'film', 'decline', 'cinema', 'CGI', 'burgeoning', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'revitalized', 'action', 'genre.FLAWS', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'enough', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'film', 'ancient', 'society', 'superpowerful', 'assassins', ""'d"", 'expect', 'more', 'deaths', 'fact', 'are', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'what', 'are', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'deaths', 'then', 'have', 'extraneous', 'footage', 'afterwards', 'show', 'one', 'died', 'Watch', 'scene', 'industrial', 'elevator', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'footage', 'tell', 'guy', 'was', 'HUNG', 'just', 'hung', 'UP', 'THIS', 'MOVIE']",N/A

147315,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0792841956,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 1]","Ah, I would give anything to return to the halcyon days when movies like &quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot; played on cable. It seemed movies like this one played on a perpetual loop back in the comforting days of Reagan, the Cold War, the Iran-Contra Affair, and nuclear winter. Things were simpler when you faced the seemingly real possibility of dying in an atomic conflagration at any moment, didn't they? Heck, the year when &quot;Remo Williams&quot; opened on movie screens across the country, Bill Clinton was just some hick wannabe rambling around the backwoods of Arkansas. Apparently, this movie's inspiration is a series of books called &quot;The Destroyer,&quot; but I don't know anything about that. What I do know is &quot;Remo Williams&quot; is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. The best thing going for the film is the presence of Fred Ward in the title role. Remember Fred Ward? We don't get to see him as much as we would like to nowadays. He's probably best remembered not for this movie but for his turn as a creature fighting hero in &quot;Tremors,&quot; a movie that came out a few years after this one. I have always liked Ward in nearly any role he decides to take on, and &quot;Remo Williams&quot; only confirms that opinion.Ward plays a beefy but lazy cop who runs into a world of hurt when he witnesses a couple of thugs beating up some guy along a deserted riverfront property. A very bloody fistfight breaks out as Ward's character steps in to make the arrest, as both the two thugs and the victim turn on the cop with a vengeance. Our hero beats all three ruffians senseless, climbs into his car to lick his wounds, and promptly finds himself dumped into the river by some nut driving a bulldozer. When Ward's character wakes up, he is in a hospital room with a rather witty chap named Conn MacCleary. This guy tells the recovering police officer he is no longer on the force. In fact, he is no longer considered among the living since a government agency named CURE has recruited Ward's character as an agent. An incredulous Ward cannot believe such nonsense, and is even more shocked to discover he now has a new name and face thanks to this enigmatic government agency. Rechristened Remo Williams, an inspired choice on the part of Conn with the help of a bedpan, our hero will soon discover what CURE does and what part the agency expects him to play.Crime stinks, especially in a country like America with its Carter appointed judges and sleazy defense lawyers always willing to help turn the criminals loose. The government decided to do something about these constitutional failings by creating CURE, an agency led by Harold Smith (Wilford Brimley). CURE has access to massive supercomputers that monitor events around the globe, fields a couple of highly trained operatives, and helps take out the trash when things get too crazy. Williams will play the role of one of these garbage men once his training is complete. Unfortunately for Remo, a big shot corporate criminal named Grove needs attention from CURE immediately, so the training must necessarily be a rushed affair. This is where Chiun (Joel Grey) comes in, a most remarkable Korean gentleman who possesses intimate knowledge of every martial art known to mankind along with a few that aren't. After a highly amusing initial encounter between Chiun and Remo, the training begins in earnest. Within a period of a month or so (yeah, right), Williams can run on wet cement without leaving footprints, burrow through a mound of sand with his bare hands, dodge bullets, and do a whole host of other astonishing feats thanks to the inimitable Chiun. What follows is a series of fancy stunt heavy scenes, with Remo fighting some goons on the scaffolding surrounding the Statue of Liberty (remember the restoration project in the 1980s?), chasing down Grove on an army base, and generally wiping out the baddies left and right.&quot;Remo Williams&quot; is a B-movie extravaganza with lots of explosions, gunfire, a guy with a diamond in his tooth, and witty dialogue to spare. The performances, unlike many films of this caliber, are rock solid. It goes without saying Fred Ward always does a good job. Wilford Brimley is believable as the heartless bureaucrat with both eyes firmly on the mission at hand. It is Joel Grey, however, who steals the movie with his incredible portrayal of the brutal yet humorous martial arts prodigy Chiun. I've seen a few reviews knocking this character as politically incorrect, but that's just anachronistic grumbling. Grey completely disappears into his character in a believable and respectful way. There aren't any gags about ancient Chinese secrets or similar nonsense seen anywhere. Grey and Ward possess great onscreen chemistry; thankfully, the script calls for the two to interact quite frequently.I did have a few problems with the movie. I think it runs slightly longer than it should have, especially as the pace slows to a crawl towards the end. Moreover, Kate Mulgrew as Army Major Rayner Fleming is largely wasted in the movie, reduced to looking confused and slightly more womanish than an Army officer is likely to be in real life. More difficulties emerge with the DVD edition of the film. Releasing the movie in a fullscreen only option is a big mistake considering the expansive stunt work in the movie. Couple this failing with a trailer as the only extra and you have a mediocre disc at best. Don't get me wrong; it is still great to see this film again after all these years; I just wish it had a better DVD release.

Fortunately, our super heroes have time to hear the villans trigger finger clinch before firing.  I guess they'd be out of luck if they unloaded the whole clip in a few seconds.

Don't watch the scene at the Statue of Liberty if you're afraid of heights.  I sure hope no Doberman Pinchers were hurt during the making of this movie.  They were extremely talented.  Any dog that can walk across cable is quite extraordinary.  But Fred Ward is good in this movie. His cynical attitude towards being recruiting by &quot;an organization that doesn't exist&quot; quickly wears off and he becomes the understudy of Chin (Joel Grey) who teaches him some nifty tricks.

Movie posters even featured four slightly different working titles;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins...Remo: The Adventure Begins...Remo: The First AdventureRemo: Unarmed and Dangerous (Title in the UK)Remo Williams is a very entertaining film that unfortunately never found an audience. While the film does suffer from a few script and directing related issues, one cannot deny that casting was perfect. Fred Ward isn't your typical action star, and that's why he's PERFECT in the title role of Remo Williams. Oscar and Golden Globe winner Joel Grey turns in another stellar performance as Chiun, a role that would bring him another Golden Globe nomination. The chemistry between these two actors, along with perfectly scripted, and often quite funny dialogue, is the real heart of this film.Yes, there are plenty of stunts, and veteran James Bond director Guy Hamilton was at the helm. Still, you shouldn't expect an ""American James Bond"". You should also not expect a traditional action film, or martial arts epic. Remo Williams never takes itself too seriously, and that's why I've always found it easy to forgive any imperfections.A few notes;Although the DVD has been released in ""standard"" format (modified to fit your screen), it is my understanding that the theatrical release was a matted presentation. So, you're actually seeing MORE than was originally intended because the matting has been removed. If the DVD was released as Widescreen, the top and bottom would be cropped (covered) to allow the widescreen aspect.Kate Mulgrew (Star Trek Voyager) has a fairly substantial supporting role, but her character isn't as developed as it should have been.Remo Willaims received an OSCAR nomination (Best Makeup - Carl Fullerton), which it truly deserved. Also, a Golden Globe and Saturn nomination (Joel Grey - Best Supporting actor), which he should have won!There WAS in fact another Remo Williams adventure, in the form of a 1988 TV pilot. It starred Jeffrey Meek as Remo, and Roddy McDowall as Chiun. It was not picked up as a series.To sum up;The late Gene Siskel had it right, when he said ""spectacular and funny adventure film"". That's exactly what this is.

That is not his real name. It is the name chosen for him by his ""recruiter"" who takes it from the bottom of a bedpan. That's how serious this show is.Remo was recruited to be part of a super secret government agency who goes after bad guys to work outside the law but who are adept at using the legal system for their own purposes and defense. The bad guy in this movie is a crooked defense contractor; all who have challenged him in the past have wound up dead or corrupted. The ""agency"" decides he has to go.The adventure is purely second rate stuff. The technology is laughable; this one was made right before the computer came into its prime. The martial arts ate done in a mediocre fashion. With such observations, one might well ask why bother watching. The answer is Joel Grey.Grey plays an elderly Korean man who's job is to train Remo in the mysterious martial arts of his country. His performance is a delight both in terms of characterization and in terms of humor. He plays a bigoted, chauvinistic but utterly likeable mentor and his acting superb. My wife is Korean and she was fooled into thinking that Grey was at least an Asian, if not a Korean.

My review may be biased insofar as I just can't see Fred Ward in the role. I am too poisoned by Tremors, a movie I really enjoyed and I thought he was perfect for. Here is the problem: you have to make up your mind making one of these guy action flics. Either you are campy (Buckaroo Banzai, Airplane) or serious (Rambo, Commando). The latter choice is just as hard as the first, because it is really easy to look ridiculous. Treading the line between the two is almost impossible, and takes the likes of Albert Broccolli who did the Bond films. In this one Fred tries to be a serious hero but carries too much baggage from prior roles to look like more than a fool. So his heroic tricks, like dodging (literally) bullets and outrunning explosions look like they were designed to amuse rather than impress. The low-budget production does little to dazzle the eyes. The script doesn't capture the political un-correctness of the books, written at a time when guys got off on booze, sleazy babes and violent death, and it was still OK to do so. The original Remo was bitter, isolated and detached. He was also indifferent to sex, except as a tool for domination, homophobic and elitist - and we loved him for it. Fred is just a toughguy, so he just looks like a bully. Chiun was the humor in the series for his neverending contempt for whites and Chinese and on and on. Because he was the toughest-ass old guy you ever met, it was OK too. Sorry, Chiun deserves to be elitist, but here is just a caricature of himself.

The movie only comes in FULL SCREEN.  I am so disappointed.  One of the best reasons to own a feature in DVD is to see it in widescreen, without the sides of the movie cut off to fit TVs with a 4:3 aspect ratio.  But for some ungodly reason the studio has released Remo Williams in full screen.  This is a very entertaining flick I want to see again in all it's silly, nostalgic, widescreen glory.

The 80s is still the peak as far as I'm concerned for American action cinema on a big budget, and part of the reason is the humor and the lack of self-conscious grandeur.  Take the early Arnold Schwarzenegger films, the low-budget martial arts films from that period; even the Indiana Jones films and, later, ""Die Hard"" weren't as full of themselves and bloated with budgets and excessive running time as what you see now.  ""Remo"" fit right in there, with some great action sequences, notably the very real-looking Statue of Liberty chase, and an abundance of humor in the interactions between streetwise cop Remo and venerable-but-deadly Korean martial arts master Chiun.  Why it was such a flop at the time, given how well it fit in with the decade's other action films and that the Destroyer book series it was based on was still fairly popular at the time, will always remain a mystery.  I guess it was hard to market given the odd buddy pairing and the fact that neither Fred Ward nor Joel Grey was exactly a box office phenomenon.At any rate, the story of the ""one honest cop"" character getting recruited into a secret organization dedicated to stopping the above-the-law criminal was probably not a new idea when the books first started coming out in the early 70s or when this film showed up in 1985, but what was different was that particular buddy relationship.  And what makes it work is Ward's tough everyman no-nonsense persona, and Grey's hilarious mixture of sarcasm and deadliness wrapped up in a tiny, frail-looking old body.  The direction by veteran James Bond helmer Guy Hamilton never falters, though the last sequence isn't really as exciting or climactic as it could be.  Craig Safan's score, particularly the rousing main title, also deserves mention - amazingly enough I've heard it quite a few times on Muzak stations, and in movie theaters before the previews in recent years.  I guess Remo is still alive in a few hearts.  And when it comes to quotes, Chiun is right up there with Arnold, Bruce or Sly.""You move like a pregnant yak.""""The trained mind does not need a watch. Watches are a confidence trick invented by the Swiss.""""It is called fast food because it speeds you to the grave.""I have a friend who loves the old Charlie Chan ""ancient Chinese secret"" stuff; he loves the proverbs and the goofy speech in films from that earlier, non-PC era.  Perhaps ""Remo"" also suffered from being in an era where having a white American like Joel Grey play a Korean would not be considered so acceptable, and at the very least it's hard not to notice it.  But Grey invests Chiun with a wonderful humanity, humor, grace, and above all utter competence; and let's face it, Chiun is more superhero than real man, American or Korean.Sadly the DVD is not super.  I'm giving this 4 stars because I do think the film deserves to be remembered and the cult needs to be kept alive - and because I don't foresee a better release any time soon.  Not only is this not anamorphic and not in the proper 1.85: 1 aspect ratio, it's dark and fuzzy at times - the night break-in scene with Remo and MacCleary is particularly atrocious - though usually at least ""watchable"".  Subtitles in English/French/Spanish and the trailer are all you get for extras.  Five stars for the film, two for the transfer, and as I said, a little bump up because the film deserves to be remembered and deserves better.",4,Sinanju is the sun...this DVD is but a shadow,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,3504,"['must', 'be', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'folks', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'cinema', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'twice', '80s', 'still', 'peak', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'American', 'action', 'cinema', 'big', 'budget', 'part', 'reason', 'humor', 'lack', 'self-conscious', 'grandeur', 'Take', 'early', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'films', 'low-budget', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'period', 'even', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'films', 'later', 'Die', 'Hard', 'were', ""n't"", 'full', 'bloated', 'budgets', 'excessive', 'running', 'time', 'what', 'see', 'now', 'Remo', 'fit', 'right', 'there', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'notably', 'very', 'real-looking', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'chase', 'abundance', 'humor', 'interactions', 'streetwise', 'cop', 'Remo', 'venerable-but-deadly', 'Korean', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'Chiun', 'Why', 'was', 'such', 'flop', 'time', 'given', 'how', 'well', 'decade', 'other', 'action', 'films', 'Destroyer', 'book', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'still', 'fairly', 'popular', 'time', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'mystery', 'guess', 'was', 'hard', 'market', 'given', 'odd', 'buddy', 'pairing', 'fact', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'was', 'exactly', 'box', 'office', 'rate', 'story', 'one', 'honest', 'cop', 'character', 'getting', 'recruited', 'secret', 'organization', 'dedicated', 'stopping', 'above-the-law', 'criminal', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'new', 'idea', 'when', 'books', 'first', 'started', 'coming', 'out', 'early', '70s', 'when', 'film', 'showed', 'up', '1985', 'what', 'was', 'different', 'was', 'particular', 'buddy', 'relationship', 'what', 'work', 'Ward', 'tough', 'everyman', 'no-nonsense', 'persona', 'Grey', 'hilarious', 'mixture', 'sarcasm', 'deadliness', 'wrapped', 'up', 'tiny', 'frail-looking', 'old', 'body', 'direction', 'veteran', 'James', 'Bond', 'helmer', 'Guy', 'Hamilton', 'never', 'last', 'sequence', ""n't"", 'really', 'exciting', 'climactic', 'could', 'be', 'Craig', 'Safan', 'score', 'particularly', 'rousing', 'main', 'title', 'also', 'mention', 'amazingly', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'Muzak', 'stations', 'movie', 'theaters', 'previews', 'recent', 'years', 'guess', 'Remo', 'still', 'alive', 'few', 'hearts', 'when', 'quotes', 'Chiun', 'right', 'there', 'Arnold', 'Bruce', 'Sly', 'move', 'pregnant', 'yak', 'trained', 'mind', 'not', 'need', 'watch', 'Watches', 'are', 'confidence', 'trick', 'invented', 'Swiss', 'called', 'fast', 'food', 'grave', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'old', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'ancient', 'Chinese', 'secret', 'stuff', 'proverbs', 'goofy', 'speech', 'films', 'earlier', 'non-PC', 'era', 'Perhaps', 'Remo', 'also', 'suffered', 'being', 'era', 'where', 'having', 'white', 'American', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'play', 'Korean', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'so', 'acceptable', 'very', 'least', 'hard', 'not', 'notice', 'Grey', 'Chiun', 'wonderful', 'humanity', 'humor', 'grace', 'utter', 'competence', 'let', 'face', 'Chiun', 'more', 'superhero', 'real', 'man', 'American', 'Korean.Sadly', 'DVD', 'not', 'super', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'be', 'remembered', 'cult', 'be', 'kept', 'alive', 'do', ""n't"", 'foresee', 'better', 'release', 'time', 'soon', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'anamorphic', 'not', 'proper', '1.85', '1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'dark', 'fuzzy', 'times', 'night', 'break-in', 'scene', 'Remo', 'MacCleary', 'particularly', 'atrocious', 'usually', 'least', 'watchable', 'Subtitles', 'English/French/Spanish', 'trailer', 'are', 'get', 'extras', 'Five', 'stars', 'film', 'two', 'transfer', 'said', 'little', 'bump', 'up', 'film', 'be', 'remembered', 'better']",N/A

I first saw this film when I was 14, in the theater, and couldn't wait for the sequel that, sadly, never came.  After seeing the film, I became a fan of the novels on which it was based.  Coming as it did at the height of Reagan-era paranoia and secretiveness (is that a word?), it has a great new, and maybe even more prescient, value in today's Bush-Ashcroft shadow government/civil liberty strangling shenanigans.As a film, regardless of culteral context, it is very entertaining.  Fred Ward is superb as the cop whose life is taken and transformed into the secret killing machine under the tutelage of Sinanju master Chuin, played by a sublime Joel Grey (the make-up is so convincing my parents, fans of Grey since ""Cabaret!"", didn't recognize him.  At the end of the film, they asked, ""Where was Joel Grey?"")  I fell in love with Kate Mulgrew as Major Fleming and have been a fan ever since.  There are great action sequences and tender moments between the characters that elevate this above the usual bump and grind (then explosion and gunplay) fare of the time.It's a pity this didn't make it as a film series (an attempt at a TV series was also made).  It would have made a great antidote to the high testosterone foolishness that passed as action films in the late '80's.

I have a good memory too, for movies and toons. I would remember if I had EVER seen something better. First, note that it is based on a series of novels called &quot;The Destroyer&quot; by Sapir and Murphy. It has an active website, [...] (I believe... I may have misspelled it). This movie may be 20 years old and the first destroyer books older, but they are STILL MAKING THEM! Over 130 books, each one averaging maybe 200 or 250 pages... the story of Remo may in fact be the longest story ever told.Now, that said, you will either agree or disagree with me. You may or may not be impressed with the special effects, or the story, or the humor. The ending is the greatest, though. Sure, you can see the 6 or 8 foot wide platform under the water and make out its edges also from the way the waves ricochet along the surface of the water, but the IDEA is brilliant and terribly funny. Here are these military guys who have lived their whole lives in the real world, shooting with real guns and understanding power on those terms, and suddenly, out of the blue, they bear witness to something that maybe... no ordinary mortal is meant to see. I also like the bullet dodging. It's really irritating how they slow things down and make it look fake like in The Matrix and other recent things. This is REAL bullet dodging, dagnammit.The character Chiun surely inspired so many other characters from other movies (Pat Morita's character in Karate kid, for instance), Japanese animation (Kamesennin from Dragonball for instance), and well, all sorts of other things (well, plenty of video games for sure), it is hard to even imagine. He is the very-old-man-invincible-martial-arts-master who says arcane, silly all the time, that has almost become a stereotype over the years. Joel Grey does an amazing job as this humorous, incredibly arrogant and insulting old man who one would say to have a superiority complex if he were not in fact superior, and you just know that things will turn out all right when he's around.Some may say this movie oozes with testosterone, and to that I say, YES! But in a good way.The DVD's only special feature, unfortunately, is the preview to the movie.

A group of individuals fed up with how America has ended up, recruits a cop into the organization by faking his death, plastic surgery, changing his name, and brutal training in the secret art of assassination called ""shinanju"". Not Just another James Bond or American ninja, Remo learns balance, dodging bullets, killing with his fingers, and much more from old korean master Chiun (Joel Grey) a non PC choice but his is the most brilliant performance. Down and dirty villians including Michael Pataki, and Patrick Kilpatrick you'll love to hate. This is the most unpredictable movie I've ever seen and to tell what else happens would ruin how the movie expertly builds up and nails it. A rare t.v. version with Roddy Mcdowell as Chiun was made around the same time. A timeless movie, with a wonderful soundtrack and the guts to tell the truth about who the real life bad guys are.

147354,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,0792841956,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[0, 0]","Remo Williams was an attempt to start a movie franchise, and well.... it didn't work.  These days a franchise, trilogy or sequel seems to be a safe bet(Hunger Games, Lord of the Rings, Kill Bill, Harry Potter, etc,), and the sequels seem to get made before the first film even hits theaters.  They're probably a safe bet because these series' usually already have heavy fan bases and the success is pretty much a guarantee, especially if a ton of money is thrown at it.The 70s and 80s were a tad different though.  Sure we had Stars Wars and Indiana Jones, which were conceived as multiple films from the get go, but there were a few attempts that didn't go anywhere.  Some of these films ended with a message before the closing credits that promised ""(Hero's name) will return in...."".  Off the top of my head I think of two immediately-Doc Savage-The Man of Bronze and The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai.Then of course we have Remo Williams, a movie that the producers felt so assured of it's success that the very title of the film implies that it's the first of a series.  I suppose that the logic was that since the director of Goldfinger was directing this film, how couldn't it be a smash?  For franchises, it's hard to beat Bond in the success department!  So, this movie is based on a series of men's adventure novels called The Destroyer, and though I have not read any of them, I hear that the film only gets it about half right.  But from just the movie standpoint, I personally really like it.Remo Williams is a cop who-unbeknownst to him-is ""killed"" and recruited to be a kind of government funded vigilante.  Why was Williams selected?  Who knows?  It never really says.  And considering he's kind of a schmuck, it's a mystery why a more badazz guy wasn't selected.  He's trained in the art of ""Sinanju"" by a Korean named Chiun.  The idea is for Williams to be some kind of human weapon who needs no firearms to take out the baddies.  So Remo spends half of the film in training with Chiun, and soon finds himself able to perform almost supernatural feats which include dodging bullets and running while hovering slightly off of the  ground.  He also gains the agility of a trapeze artist and frequently runs along suspended wires and ledges of buildings.His primary target in this film is a sinister weapons manufacturer, and quite frankly, he's not the most engaging villain.  But it does allow for some cool action sequences and great stunts.The movie's trying to walk a fine line between campy and serious action, which is a bit jarring.  But the movie is never at any point taking itself totally serious.  It's definitely pulpy, comic book material through and through-the kind of stuff you never see anymore.  Today a movie like this would have to be more like a Jason Bourne movie or something.I've always loved Fred Ward, and this is a real showcase for him.  Joel Grey is passable enough as a Korean, but seriously, couldn't they just find a Korean actor instead of going through all the trouble to make up a white guy to look Asian?  Wilford ""Die-Beetus"" Brimley has a few funny moments as Remo's superior.So, why did movies like this, Buckaroo Banzai and Doc Savage get major studios behind them and fall flat on their faces?  There's probably a ton of reasons, but I have my own guesses.  Basically, the 70s and 80s were a time when studios still had that approach to throw everything at the wall to see what stuck.  Lots of crazy ideas had studio backing that would never happen now.  How else do you explain films like Krull, Flash Gordon, The Ice Pirates or The Last Starfighter coming out of Hollywood?I think Remo, Doc and Buckaroo were just a bit too quirky, odd and cultish from the get go to catch on with mainstream audiences(especially Buckaroo!).  Your Harry Potters and Twilights and Hunger Games are relatively safe bets, and follow a more established Hollywood formula than films like Remo Williams do.  Too bad coz I really would have liked to have seen more crazy adventures with these characters.",4,....But It Didn't End!,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,4039,"['Remo', 'Williams', 'was', 'attempt', 'start', 'movie', 'franchise', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'days', 'franchise', 'trilogy', 'sequel', 'be', 'safe', 'bet', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'etc', 'sequels', 'seem', 'get', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'even', 'theaters', ""'re"", 'probably', 'safe', 'bet', 'series', 'usually', 'already', 'have', 'heavy', 'fan', 'bases', 'success', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', 'especially', 'ton', 'money', 'thrown', 'it.The', '70s', '80s', 'were', 'tad', 'different', 'Sure', 'had', 'Stars', 'Wars', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'were', 'conceived', 'multiple', 'films', 'get', 'go', 'were', 'few', 'attempts', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'films', 'ended', 'message', 'closing', 'credits', 'promised', 'Hero', 'name', 'will', 'return', 'top', 'head', 'think', 'two', 'immediately-Doc', 'Savage-The', 'Man', 'Bronze', 'Adventures', 'Buckaroo', 'Banzai.Then', 'course', 'have', 'Remo', 'Williams', 'movie', 'producers', 'felt', 'so', 'assured', 'success', 'very', 'title', 'film', 'first', 'series', 'suppose', 'logic', 'was', 'director', 'Goldfinger', 'was', 'directing', 'film', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'smash', 'franchises', 'hard', 'beat', 'Bond', 'success', 'department', 'So', 'movie', 'based', 'series', 'men', 'adventure', 'novels', 'called', 'Destroyer', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'hear', 'film', 'only', 'half', 'right', 'just', 'movie', 'standpoint', 'personally', 'really', 'like', 'it.Remo', 'Williams', 'cop', 'who-unbeknownst', 'him-is', 'killed', 'recruited', 'be', 'kind', 'government', 'funded', 'vigilante', 'Why', 'was', 'Williams', 'selected', 'Who', 'never', 'really', 'considering', 'kind', 'schmuck', 'mystery', 'why', 'more', 'badazz', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'selected', 'trained', 'art', 'Sinanju', 'Korean', 'named', 'Chiun', 'idea', 'Williams', 'be', 'kind', 'human', 'weapon', 'who', 'firearms', 'take', 'out', 'baddies', 'So', 'Remo', 'half', 'film', 'training', 'Chiun', 'soon', 'able', 'perform', 'almost', 'supernatural', 'feats', 'include', 'dodging', 'bullets', 'running', 'hovering', 'slightly', 'ground', 'also', 'gains', 'agility', 'trapeze', 'artist', 'frequently', 'along', 'suspended', 'wires', 'ledges', 'buildings.His', 'primary', 'target', 'film', 'sinister', 'weapons', 'manufacturer', 'quite', 'frankly', 'not', 'most', 'engaging', 'villain', 'allow', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'great', 'stunts.The', 'movie', 'trying', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'campy', 'serious', 'action', 'bit', 'jarring', 'movie', 'never', 'point', 'taking', 'totally', 'serious', 'definitely', 'pulpy', 'comic', 'book', 'material', 'through-the', 'kind', 'stuff', 'never', 'see', 'anymore', 'Today', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'more', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'something.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'real', 'showcase', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'passable', 'enough', 'Korean', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'find', 'Korean', 'actor', 'instead', 'going', 'trouble', 'make', 'up', 'white', 'guy', 'look', 'Asian', 'Wilford', 'Die-Beetus', 'Brimley', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'Remo', 'superior.So', 'why', 'did', 'movies', 'Buckaroo', 'Banzai', 'Doc', 'Savage', 'get', 'major', 'studios', 'fall', 'flat', 'probably', 'ton', 'reasons', 'have', 'own', 'guesses', 'Basically', '70s', '80s', 'were', 'time', 'when', 'studios', 'still', 'had', 'approach', 'throw', 'everything', 'wall', 'see', 'what', 'stuck', 'Lots', 'crazy', 'ideas', 'had', 'studio', 'backing', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'now', 'How', 'else', 'do', 'explain', 'films', 'Krull', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'Ice', 'Pirates', 'Last', 'Starfighter', 'coming', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'Remo', 'Doc', 'Buckaroo', 'were', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'quirky', 'odd', 'cultish', 'get', 'go', 'catch', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'especially', 'Buckaroo', 'Harry', 'Potters', 'Twilights', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'are', 'relatively', 'safe', 'bets', 'follow', 'more', 'established', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'films', 'Remo', 'Williams', 'do', 'Too', 'bad', 'coz', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'crazy', 'adventures', 'characters']",N/A

Fred Ward, one of our finest character actors, plays the title role.  He had been a NYC cop until he was set-up, and his death faked by a super-secret government organization known as CURE.  CURE's head is Harold Smith (Wilford Brimley) who explains to Remo that he's been recruited to become a government assassin.  Remo is placed under the tutelage of Chiun (Joel Grey), the Korean Master of the martial art known as Sinanju.  Sinanju is explained as the original martial art from which every other form sprang from.  Both parties are reluctant...Chiun thinks Remo smells like hamburgers and Remo hates the fact that this little old Korean fellow keeps beating the tar out of him.Some of the best moments of the film are between Remo and Chiun as they talk about food (""I can say rat droppings, that does not mean I want to eat them!), Sex, and Chiun's affinity for soap operas which he considers America's only contribution to world culture.  Hilarious!  The learning of Sinanju teaches Remo a number of useful skills such as superhuman reflexes that he can use to dodge bullets, as well as the ability to run on air or across water.  However when asked when Remo will be ready for assignment, Chiun replies 15 years, or 14  if he cuts a few corners.  That's too long too wait as CURE needs Remo to check out Grove Industries, a company that makes weapons for the military including a ""star wars"" type weapon known as Harp.  The weapons from the company have been failing and they are being investigated by Major Fleming of the Army (Kate Mulgrew).Remo's first demonstration of his skills comes in a harrowing battle with a group of hired thugs high atop the Statue of Liberty during her 1980's makeover when it was surrounded by scaffolding.  The thugs are fired by a Grove enforcer known as Stone played by frequent film heavy Patrick Kilpatrick.  This all leads to an eventual showdown at a military weapons testing ground as Remo is finally sent to take down George Grove and his cronies.No matter how many times I've seen the film I'll always watch it if it is on TV.  Ward and Grey were wonderful together and Grey really steals the show under a ton of makeup as the frail-looking, but superhumanly powerful Master of Sinanju.  Ward is perfect as Remo as the tough, and smart alecky assassin.  Perhaps the only weakness would be the rather mundane plot and villains.  Those who read the books know that Chiun and Remo faced off against some truly fantastic villains that the movie just didn't live up to.  I'd love to see someone take another crack at remaking the film with some more modern day effects and a stronger villain.Great Film!",5,"IN KOREA, DOOR HANDLES DO NOT BREAK!",1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,2815,"['actually', 'saw', 'movie', 'ever', 'knew', 'Destroyer', 'series', 'made', 'instant', 'fan', 'collector', 'long-running', 'action/adventure', 'novel', 'series', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'one', 'finest', 'character', 'actors', 'title', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'NYC', 'cop', 'was', 'set-up', 'death', 'faked', 'super-secret', 'government', 'organization', 'known', 'CURE', 'CURE', 'head', 'Harold', 'Smith', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'who', 'Remo', 'been', 'recruited', 'become', 'government', 'assassin', 'Remo', 'placed', 'tutelage', 'Chiun', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Korean', 'Master', 'martial', 'art', 'known', 'Sinanju', 'Sinanju', 'explained', 'original', 'martial', 'art', 'other', 'form', 'sprang', 'parties', 'are', 'reluctant', 'Chiun', 'Remo', 'smells', 'hamburgers', 'Remo', 'fact', 'little', 'old', 'Korean', 'fellow', 'keeps', 'beating', 'tar', 'him.Some', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'Remo', 'Chiun', 'talk', 'food', 'can', 'say', 'rat', 'droppings', 'not', 'mean', 'want', 'eat', 'Sex', 'Chiun', 'affinity', 'soap', 'operas', 'America', 'only', 'contribution', 'world', 'culture', 'Hilarious', 'learning', 'Sinanju', 'teaches', 'Remo', 'number', 'useful', 'skills', 'such', 'superhuman', 'reflexes', 'can', 'use', 'dodge', 'bullets', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'run', 'air', 'water', 'However', 'when', 'asked', 'when', 'Remo', 'will', 'be', 'ready', 'assignment', 'Chiun', '15', 'years', '14', 'few', 'corners', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'wait', 'CURE', 'Remo', 'check', 'out', 'Grove', 'Industries', 'company', 'weapons', 'military', 'including', 'star', 'wars', 'type', 'weapon', 'known', 'Harp', 'weapons', 'company', 'have', 'been', 'failing', 'are', 'being', 'investigated', 'Major', 'Fleming', 'Army', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', '.Remo', 'first', 'demonstration', 'skills', 'harrowing', 'battle', 'group', 'hired', 'thugs', 'high', 'Statue', 'Liberty', '1980', 'makeover', 'when', 'was', 'surrounded', 'scaffolding', 'thugs', 'are', 'fired', 'Grove', 'enforcer', 'known', 'Stone', 'played', 'frequent', 'film', 'heavy', 'Patrick', 'Kilpatrick', 'eventual', 'showdown', 'military', 'weapons', 'testing', 'ground', 'Remo', 'finally', 'sent', 'take', 'down', 'George', 'Grove', 'cronies.No', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', ""'ll"", 'always', 'watch', 'TV', 'Ward', 'Grey', 'were', 'wonderful', 'together', 'Grey', 'really', 'show', 'ton', 'makeup', 'frail-looking', 'superhumanly', 'powerful', 'Master', 'Sinanju', 'Ward', 'perfect', 'as', 'Remo', 'tough', 'smart', 'alecky', 'assassin', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'weakness', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'mundane', 'plot', 'villains', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'know', 'Chiun', 'Remo', 'faced', 'off', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'villains', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'someone', 'take', 'crack', 'remaking', 'film', 'more', 'modern', 'day', 'effects', 'stronger', 'villain.Great', 'Film']",N/A

147358,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0792841956,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","I remember my Dad reading The Destroyer novels as a kid. I often wondered what the appeal was in this series about a former cop/Bond wannabe named after a bedpan. While it isn't completely faithful to the source material, Guy Hamilton's Remo Williams captures some of the absurdity that made these novels so memorable as pulp fiction. Hamilton's tone as director (and the script)are an extension of the tongue in cheek Bond thrillers starring Roger Moore. Although this might seem a stretch, if you enjoyed films like Buckaroo Banzai, Big Trouble in Little China and the stronger Moore based Bond films (what an interesting cross section!), you'll enjoy Remo Williams.The plot is pretty straight forward: Fred Ward plays a police officer who &quot;reborn&quot; to play the role of action hero. The performances capture much of the original characters from the novels. I suppose the best way to view this film is as a 70's and 80's variation on the Doc Savage pulp novels. The exception is that Doc here is an oafish fool part of the time.MGM has done an exceptional job lately with its two for one Midnite Matinee DVDs and reissues. Sadly, Remo Williams is botched from the first frame; MGM chose to release this full frame vs. widescreen. Now it's entirely possible that Hamilton shot this in standard aspect ratio and matted it afterwards for theater exhibition (which is what Kubrick did with many of his films after Barry Lyndon--he was unhappy with the cropping of his films for television so shot them in standard aspect ratio, i.e., framed for t.v., then matted them for the theater. That way he had control over both versions of the film). Regardless, it should have been noted on the box (a flaw with the Kubrick films The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut as well).There aren't any extras and, given the market for this film, that's not a surprise. Still, the least MGM could have done was include a running commentary from stars Fred Ward and Joel Grey. Perhaps neither one was available or interested. Still, with Hamitlon deceased, I would have been interested in hearing their take on the film. The reason this is lacking in extras is the same reason that films like Horror of Dracula is lacking extras--it's not cost effective for MGM to do it. A pity as Anchor &amp; Bay could have done a bang up job (like they did with The Three Musketeers DVD although that one was also missing a commentary track).Fans of Remo Williams will just have to be happy that the film is finally available on DVD. I've only seen the film on TNT (also in full screen format)a couple times over the past years. While it's not the perfect package, I am thankful that MGM chose to release this and not just let it languish in their film vault. Somewhere there has to be outtakes, interviews, press interviews, etc. We'll have to wait another day for those I suppose.",3,"A mix of spoof, serious action for film out of its time",1057881600,"07 11, 2003",2003,2850,"['remember', 'Dad', 'reading', 'Destroyer', 'novels', 'kid', 'often', 'wondered', 'what', 'appeal', 'was', 'series', 'former', 'cop/Bond', 'wannabe', 'named', 'bedpan', ""n't"", 'completely', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'Guy', 'Hamilton', 'Remo', 'Williams', 'absurdity', 'made', 'novels', 'so', 'memorable', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'Hamilton', 'tone', 'director', 'script', 'are', 'extension', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'Bond', 'thrillers', 'starring', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'might', 'seem', 'stretch', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'Buckaroo', 'Banzai', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Little', 'China', 'stronger', 'Moore', 'based', 'Bond', 'films', 'what', 'interesting', 'cross', 'section', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Remo', 'Williams.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'quot', 'quot', 'play', 'role', 'action', 'hero', 'performances', 'capture', 'much', 'original', 'characters', 'novels', 'suppose', 'best', 'way', 'view', 'film', '70', '80', 'variation', 'Doc', 'Savage', 'pulp', 'novels', 'exception', 'Doc', 'here', 'oafish', 'fool', 'part', 'time.MGM', 'done', 'exceptional', 'job', 'lately', 'two', 'one', 'Midnite', 'Matinee', 'DVDs', 'reissues', 'Sadly', 'Remo', 'Williams', 'botched', 'first', 'frame', 'MGM', 'chose', 'release', 'full', 'frame', 'vs.', 'widescreen', 'Now', 'entirely', 'possible', 'Hamilton', 'shot', 'standard', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'matted', 'theater', 'exhibition', 'what', 'Kubrick', 'did', 'many', 'films', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'was', 'unhappy', 'cropping', 'films', 'television', 'so', 'shot', 'standard', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'i.e.', 'framed', 't.v.', 'then', 'matted', 'theater', 'way', 'had', 'control', 'versions', 'film', 'Regardless', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'noted', 'box', 'flaw', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'Shining', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'extras', 'given', 'market', 'film', 'not', 'surprise', 'Still', 'least', 'MGM', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'include', 'running', 'commentary', 'stars', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'was', 'available', 'interested', 'Still', 'Hamitlon', 'deceased', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'hearing', 'take', 'film', 'reason', 'lacking', 'extras', 'same', 'reason', 'films', 'Horror', 'Dracula', 'lacking', 'extras', 'not', 'cost', 'effective', 'MGM', 'do', 'pity', 'Anchor', 'amp', 'Bay', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bang', 'up', 'job', 'did', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'DVD', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'missing', 'commentary', 'track', '.Fans', 'Remo', 'Williams', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'be', 'happy', 'film', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'film', 'TNT', 'also', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'couple', 'times', 'past', 'years', 'not', 'perfect', 'package', 'am', 'thankful', 'MGM', 'chose', 'release', 'not', 'just', 'let', 'languish', 'film', 'vault', 'Somewhere', 'there', 'be', 'outtakes', 'interviews', 'press', 'interviews', 'etc', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'day', 'suppose']",N/A

That summer, all I wanted to do was walk on water like the little Korean Man.  Looking at the film today, wow, the effects are rough. Camea angles are not the greatest, zip lines are seen, and good greif the Computers and ""secret Camera"", what a joke. But hey, the story is still pretty cool.  Where else do you see a man dodge bullets.  This was also based on a series of books, ""the destroyer""series I believe, so I think it was an attempt to try and start another James bond like series of films from a book series.  Unfortunately, it never caught on, so this film series died as quietly as it was received. One final note, Katheryn Magrew, Captain Janeway in Star Trek Voyager, was the female star of this film, of course it was one of her first bigger roles.  Obviously, this film never made her a big star either, so ten years later Voyager was her break.  Wilford Brimely was also in this flick as the man behind the scenes, the information running the big computer.  Interesting choice. Anyhow. Read some of the other reviews, but I think its still a good film despite some flaws.  I agree, a sequel or remake currently could make it a big series.",4,"Great cheasy action film meant to have sequels, but never achieved its potential",1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,1325,"['one', 'first', 'movies', 'remember', 'seeing', 'theater', 'kid', 'other', 'ones', 'stick', 'out', 'are', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'Star', 'trek', 'III', 'search', 'Spock', 'summer', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'walk', 'water', 'little', 'Korean', 'Man', 'Looking', 'film', 'today', 'wow', 'effects', 'are', 'rough', 'Camea', 'angles', 'are', 'not', 'greatest', 'zip', 'lines', 'are', 'seen', 'good', 'greif', 'Computers', 'secret', 'Camera', 'what', 'joke', 'hey', 'story', 'still', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Where', 'else', 'do', 'see', 'man', 'dodge', 'bullets', 'was', 'also', 'based', 'series', 'books', 'destroyer', 'series', 'believe', 'think', 'was', 'attempt', 'try', 'start', 'James', 'bond', 'series', 'films', 'book', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'caught', 'film', 'series', 'died', 'as', 'quietly', 'was', 'received', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'Katheryn', 'Magrew', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'was', 'female', 'star', 'film', 'course', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'bigger', 'roles', 'Obviously', 'film', 'never', 'made', 'big', 'star', 'so', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Voyager', 'was', 'break', 'Wilford', 'Brimely', 'was', 'also', 'flick', 'man', 'scenes', 'information', 'running', 'big', 'computer', 'Interesting', 'choice', 'Anyhow', 'Read', 'other', 'reviews', 'think', 'still', 'good', 'film', 'flaws', 'agree', 'sequel', 'remake', 'currently', 'could', 'make', 'big', 'series']",N/A
