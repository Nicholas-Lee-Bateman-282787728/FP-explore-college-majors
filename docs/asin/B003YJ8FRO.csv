Though the movie doesn't quite live up to its jacket-- particularly the part about saving mankind from its own destruction-- it was otherwise pretty good. Very nice, in fact. I watched it on a whim. In general, given his previous offerings, I've learned to just skip Rob Schneider movies due to their absolute lack of any redeeming value-- or any other kind of value.

1376357,A5N992ESD6UHW,B003YJ8FRO,"Jonny Lee ""Boothill Gunslinger""","[9, 12]","What a great movie!Down-on-his-luck Paul (Rob Schneider) has nothing to live for...his wife left him, his boss hates him, his father committed suicide, his mother (Holland Taylor) and brother (a strange but fairly amiable Steve Buscemi) are nothing more than nuisances, and alcohol consumes him.  But when a beautiful South American woman and three shaman arrive on his doorstep, his life takes a drastic turn.Advertised as a comedy, ""The Chosen One"" shouldn't be labeled solely as such. There are heartfelt moments, times of trial, instances of soul searching, and life lessons to be had throughout. It is more of a character study than a comedy and one in the vein of subtle drama with light-hearted humor sprinkled in for relief.Rob Schneider has always been number one in my book. His approach isn't for everybody, but his heart is always in the right place, and his humor, while sometimes silly, is very palatable.  ""The Chosen One,"" which Rob also co-wrote and co-produced, is an exceptional movie with great acting and a very touching and moving story.
