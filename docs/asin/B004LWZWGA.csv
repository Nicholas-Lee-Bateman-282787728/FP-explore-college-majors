1418271,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B004LWZWGA,,"[0, 0]","A flawed ending and some heavy-handed storytelling mars the follow-up to the stellar &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; and this opening criticism comes first in my review because this is what the final moments of this grand film leave us with.Christopher Nolan's fine Batman trilogy comes to a close simultaneously mythologizing and de-mythologizing the hero who would be the everyman.  Following the catastrophic events of &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; Bruce Wayne is but a shell of his former self, going the route of Howard Hughes, as he keeps his cape and cowl off the grid so that Gotham can have a patsy while venerating Harvey Dent's memory and stand against crime.  And it's working, except that Ra's al Ghul's daughter is working to keep her father's dream alive by excising the world's evil and corruption as epitomized by Gotham by blowing the city up.  The League of Shadows remains in play.Here it's necessary to remind potential viewers that they really would do well to watch the first two Nolan Batman entries and have them fresh in their minds in order to get the most out of &#34;Rises&#34;.  The movie's plot has a lot of strings and strands that it's working toward tying up and it builds, mostly externally from the previous two films, though at it's heart it allows itself to be about a man (or woman) of vision and dedication and with the ability to face and conquer their fears being able to overcome the odds and the obstacles that are put in front of them.  At least if they're the good guys.One of the striking things about this movie is that there is little difference between the Bats and the Bane (and other main villain) characters: the dividing line that separates them is not the fabric of their personality but their moral framework, their moral choices.  That's one of the key and pivotal posits that this movie makes in its philosophy and psychology, and it's an important one at that, one that will likely be missed but that should be well heeded.As it is, though, as the movie plays out that in the end the path that Bruce Wayne (for this is about him moreso than Batman) follows is a rising one from the depths of despair of inconsequence to the heights of fulfillment in sacrifice.  The important moralities that are embraced, though, are overshadowed by the heavy weight of direction: the film strives so hard to show this tonal triumph that it spends too short a time on his rising from the pit and too long a time on his rallying the troupes and overcoming the threats.  This drawn out eventual passion play also has its moments of outright ridiculosity that threaten to take the viewer out of the movie such as when the swells of the city's police force run down the narrow street channel into a choke-point of crossfire death.  This perhaps is meant to show heart but the stupidity of the move takes the moviegoer momentarily out of the movie.  IMO much more appealing, even though the end still wraps itself in some mystery, would be to have allowed the Batman's apparent demise with nothing (emphasis on that word) but firm doubts in the mind of the fan.  I know that you can interpret whether Wayne is alive or not one way or the other based on how the movie ends, but to interpret him as living feels Hollywood and negates to a degree the effect of the apparent sacrifice that he made.So while Nolan's tale takes care to close much of what it opened it takes a couple of missteps especially at film's end that leaves a slightly befuddled taste to the picture.  A grand scheme, a grand scale to be sure though and well worth watching especially from trilogy beginning to end.  4.5 (but just not quite 5) stars.",4,"Moral choice separates and defines us, says TDKR, not our general personality and individual psychologies.",1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,3646,"['flawed', 'ending', 'heavy-handed', 'storytelling', 'follow-up', 'stellar', '34', 'Dark', 'Knight', '34', 'opening', 'criticism', 'first', 'review', 'what', 'final', 'moments', 'grand', 'film', 'leave', 'Nolan', 'fine', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'close', 'simultaneously', 'mythologizing', 'de-mythologizing', 'hero', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'everyman', 'Following', 'catastrophic', 'events', '34', 'Dark', 'Knight', '34', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'going', 'route', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'cape', 'cowl', 'off', 'grid', 'Gotham', 'can', 'have', 'patsy', 'venerating', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'memory', 'stand', 'crime', 'working', 'Ra', 'al', 'Ghul', 'daughter', 'working', 'keep', 'father', 'dream', 'alive', 'excising', 'world', 'evil', 'corruption', 'epitomized', 'Gotham', 'blowing', 'city', 'up', 'League', 'Shadows', 'play.Here', 'necessary', 'remind', 'potential', 'viewers', 'really', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'entries', 'have', 'fresh', 'minds', 'order', 'get', 'most', '34', 'Rises', '34', 'movie', 'plot', 'lot', 'strings', 'working', 'tying', 'up', 'mostly', 'externally', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'though', 'heart', 'be', 'man', 'woman', 'vision', 'dedication', 'ability', 'face', 'conquer', 'fears', 'being', 'able', 'overcome', 'odds', 'obstacles', 'are', 'put', 'front', 'least', ""'re"", 'good', 'guys.One', 'striking', 'things', 'movie', 'little', 'difference', 'Bats', 'Bane', 'other', 'main', 'villain', 'characters', 'dividing', 'line', 'not', 'fabric', 'personality', 'moral', 'framework', 'moral', 'choices', 'one', 'key', 'pivotal', 'posits', 'movie', 'philosophy', 'psychology', 'important', 'one', 'one', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'missed', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'heeded.As', 'though', 'movie', 'out', 'end', 'path', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'moreso', 'Batman', 'rising', 'one', 'depths', 'despair', 'inconsequence', 'heights', 'fulfillment', 'sacrifice', 'important', 'moralities', 'are', 'embraced', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'heavy', 'weight', 'direction', 'film', 'strives', 'so', 'hard', 'show', 'tonal', 'triumph', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'rising', 'pit', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'rallying', 'troupes', 'overcoming', 'threats', 'drawn', 'out', 'eventual', 'passion', 'play', 'also', 'moments', 'outright', 'ridiculosity', 'take', 'viewer', 'movie', 'such', 'when', 'swells', 'city', 'police', 'force', 'run', 'down', 'narrow', 'street', 'channel', 'choke-point', 'crossfire', 'death', 'perhaps', 'meant', 'show', 'heart', 'stupidity', 'move', 'moviegoer', 'momentarily', 'movie', 'IMO', 'much', 'more', 'appealing', 'even', 'end', 'still', 'mystery', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'allowed', 'Batman', 'apparent', 'demise', 'nothing', 'emphasis', 'word', 'firm', 'doubts', 'mind', 'fan', 'know', 'can', 'interpret', 'Wayne', 'alive', 'not', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'based', 'how', 'movie', 'interpret', 'living', 'feels', 'Hollywood', 'negates', 'degree', 'effect', 'apparent', 'sacrifice', 'Nolan', 'tale', 'care', 'close', 'much', 'what', 'opened', 'couple', 'missteps', 'especially', 'film', 'end', 'slightly', 'befuddled', 'taste', 'picture', 'grand', 'scheme', 'grand', 'scale', 'be', 'sure', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'trilogy', 'beginning', 'end', '4.5', 'just', 'not', 'quite', '5', 'stars']",N/A

1418303,A2DDBYKXF1N0D5,B004LWZWGA,,"[0, 0]","I am a huge Batman fan and thought ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" were some awesome movies. That's why I couldn't wait to see this one, especially since ""The Dark Knight"" ended with Batman going on the run. I've got to admit, I have mixed feelings for this one. In some ways it's an awesome movie, and in others it's crap.First let me say that the length of the movie is far too long (at least ten minutes too long). It's 2 hours 45 minutes long and could have easily been 2 hours 35 minutes long. Alfred argues with Bruce Wayne a lot, in three scenes, and in the third scene (which is about 4 minutes long) he decides to leave, refusing to help Batman at all. I don't know about you, but I perfer Batman's and Alfred's relationship better in the previous Batmans as opposed to this one. Plus it's one of the main reasons that makes this film so long and slow moving. Take away those scenes and you take away 7 minutes of the movie. They could have also done without the love scene between Batman and Miranda. That's another 3 minutes.It's also funny how director Christopher Nolan didn't want to use the Riddler in this film because he thought the Riddler was too simular to the Joker, and yet Bane's character in this film is characterized very much like Heath Ledger's Joker by preying on people's fears and gullibility to manipulate them into doing his dirty work just like the Joker did in ""The Dark Knight"".Not to mention the ridiculous ending which could have been tweaked just a little bit to make a much better ending.This film does have some good things about it though. Bane is portrayed a lot more realistically and scarier than in other Batmans, performances are pretty good for the most part, the film does have a good plot, and the action scenes (when they finally get to them) are pretty exciting (especially when Batman and the city's cops attempt to retake the city from Bane and stop the bomb from going off).All in all, it's worth checking out, but I wouldn't waste my money on buying it. But in the end it's all up to you. If it turns out you like, then buy it, but it wasn't for me. And it's a shame too because I think with a little bit of tweaking, it could have been the best Batman movie of them all.",3,It could have been better...,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,2233,"['am', 'huge', 'Batman', 'fan', 'thought', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'were', 'awesome', 'movies', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'one', 'especially', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'ended', 'Batman', 'going', 'run', ""'ve"", 'got', 'admit', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'one', 'ways', 'awesome', 'movie', 'others', 'crap.First', 'let', 'say', 'length', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'least', 'ten', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', '2', 'hours', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', '2', 'hours', '35', 'minutes', 'long', 'Alfred', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'lot', 'three', 'scenes', 'third', 'scene', '4', 'minutes', 'long', 'leave', 'refusing', 'help', 'Batman', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'perfer', 'Batman', 'Alfred', 'relationship', 'better', 'previous', 'Batmans', 'opposed', 'one', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'long', 'slow', 'moving', 'Take', 'away', 'scenes', 'take', 'away', '7', 'minutes', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'done', 'love', 'scene', 'Batman', 'Miranda', '3', 'minutes.It', 'also', 'funny', 'how', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'use', 'Riddler', 'film', 'thought', 'Riddler', 'was', 'too', 'simular', 'Joker', 'yet', 'Bane', 'character', 'film', 'characterized', 'very', 'much', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'preying', 'people', 'fears', 'gullibility', 'manipulate', 'doing', 'dirty', 'work', 'just', 'Joker', 'did', 'Dark', 'Knight', '.Not', 'mention', 'ridiculous', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tweaked', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'make', 'much', 'better', 'ending.This', 'film', 'have', 'good', 'things', 'Bane', 'portrayed', 'lot', 'more', 'realistically', 'scarier', 'other', 'Batmans', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'have', 'good', 'plot', 'action', 'scenes', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'are', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'especially', 'when', 'Batman', 'city', 'cops', 'attempt', 'retake', 'city', 'Bane', 'stop', 'bomb', 'going', 'off', '.All', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying', 'end', 'up', 'out', 'then', 'buy', 'was', ""n't"", 'shame', 'too', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'tweaking', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'Batman', 'movie']",N/A

1418351,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B004LWZWGA,,"[0, 0]","""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the conclusion of director Christopher Nolan's superb ""Batman"" trilogy, with Christian Bale as the Batman.  This is no ordinary superhero movie, even by the high standards of Nolan's two previous Batman features.  This is movie-making on an epic scale, with a large and capable cast, tons of special effects, and a narrative that appears to draw heavily from Charles Dicken's novel ""A Tale of Two Cities.""The scale of an evil plot by the League of Shadows against Gotham City is so vast and complicated that fully two thirds of the movie is expended getting it on screen.  Bruce Wayne and Batman are reduced to a supporting role for long stretches, while the narrative focuses on an especially nasty villain named Bain, a police commissioner with a bad conscience, a cat burgler with more conscience than she can admit to, an ambitious but cowardly senior cop, a young cop with too much conscience, the violent mob that overruns Gotham, and the people who betray Gotham from within.The theme of the movie is redemption, especially but not only for Bruce Wayne.  Bruce and Batman will be humiliated, beaten nearly to death, and finally consigned to a place called Hell, before the story calls for his heroic return and even more heoric act of sacrifice.  It isn't pleasant to watch in places, but the ending should make it all worthwhile.  There are plenty of action sequences and lots of excellent special effects along the way.Anne Hathaway was probably not the obvious choice for Catwoman, but she can act.  She does an excellent job portraying the complex and conflicted cat burglar Selina Kyle, a woman in search of a clean start.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt almost steals the movie as the honest cop John Blake.  Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles from the earlier movies.

1418428,A304GUEPCPYM3Z,B004LWZWGA,,"[1, 2]","In my opinion, this is the best of the Batman movies.  And not just of the Christian Bale movies, but out of all of the movies dating back to Michael Keaton's.  What a way to finish the story began in ""Batman Begins""!As I have stated in my movie reviews, the best stories are those driven both by plot and by character.  To some extent, this particular one is more character-driven than its predecessors.  But, do not assume that the plot is secondary.  Both are given equal attention here.  And what a masterful job from director Christopher Nolan, who also co-wrote the screenplay.  Obviously, this is a high-budget movie, and as such, the production quality, and the stuff that make you think ""wow"" are all beyond reproach.  The special effects and the sets are the best that money can buy.  The Batman's toys and high-tech support are all here.  But this movie is really about Bruce Wayne, much more so than the Batman or his high-tech arsenal.  The story that began in the first movie has now come full-circle, and builds up to an awe-inspiring, surprising, and fitting finale.The story picks up eight years after the second movie.  Batman, with the help of Gordon, has taken the blame for the death of Harvey Dent.  The death of Harvey Dent spurred the people of Gotham to pull together to enact some rather draconian laws in order to fight the criminal elements.  Eight years of very, very aggressive tactics have cleaned up the city.  Gotham is a safe and a peaceful place to live in.  Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has been living a very reclusive life, holed up in his mansion.  Detached from Gotham society and his company, the billionaire has allowed his business adversaries to gain a foothold within the board rooms of Wayne Enterprises.Meanwhile, beneath the city streets, in the sewers, Bane has been putting plans together to take over the city.  This Bane has a mysterious connection to Bruce Wayne's past.  As Bane's power starts to grow, Bruce realizes that he is now a  threat to Gotham and must be stopped.  Alfred, ever mindful of Bruce's broken body, pleads with him not to don the cape again.  The loyal Alfred frankly tells Bruce that he is now past his prime and tells him that he can not hope to beat Bane in a fight.  Alfred tells him not to confront Bane.  Bruce stubbornly decides to get back in physical shape so that Batman could rise once again and save the city.  Unwilling to have to be the one to bury Bruce, Alfred decides to quit his job and leave the mansion.Now alone, Bruce meets up with the mysterious burglar, Selina Kyle.  Gordon is in the hospital, recovering from a run-in with Bane's thugs.  A young policeman named Blake has managed to work out the true identity of Batman and pays Bruce a visit.  At Wayne Enterprises, the ambitious board member Daggett has worked out a plan with Bane that would give him control of the company and all of Bruce's assets.As the plot unfolds, we see Bruce Wayne brought down to as low as a man could go.  Without his wealth, health, and gadgets, he must find a way to rescue Gotham from Bane and his thugs.  Yes, I agree with one of my fellow reviewers who said that this one has a slower pace than the previous two movies.  And that is primarily because the attention here is on Bruce and what happens to him.  This is the character-driven part of the story.  Watching this, you cannot help but feel sorry for him.  This movie will make you care about this character and will make you really root for him as he brings himself back up from the pit of despair.Nolan really gave Christian Bale an opportunity to shine as an actor in this movie.  We know Bale is good.  We've watched him since he was a teenager in ""Empire of the Sun"".  But now, with this movie, he has established himself as one of the best actors out there.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt played Blake.  Anne Hathaway plays Selina Kyle.  Michael Caine and Gary Oldman are both back for their respective parts, along with Morgan Freeman.  And Tom Hardy plays the very scary Bane.Ok, yes this is a movie about a superhero.  But this is not anything like Ironman.  Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark are as different as two people can be.  And this movie is dark and weighty, not light-hearted like the Ironman movies.  Both franchises are good, both of the lead actors are terrific.  But the tone of the films are as different as night and day.This is easily one of the best movies this year, perhaps second only to ""Prometheus"", in the humble opinion of your reviewer.  I rented this movie from XBox, but you can also rent it from Playstation and from here.  If there is a movie worth having on your Blu-Ray library collection though, this would be near the top of the list.  This is one of those movies that would make a great addition to any respectable Blu-Ray or DVD collection.",5,The Best of the Batman Movies,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,4806,"['opinion', 'best', 'Batman', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'movies', 'movies', 'dating', 'back', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'What', 'way', 'finish', 'story', 'began', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'have', 'stated', 'movie', 'reviews', 'best', 'stories', 'are', 'driven', 'plot', 'character', 'extent', 'particular', 'one', 'more', 'character-driven', 'predecessors', 'do', 'not', 'assume', 'plot', 'secondary', 'are', 'given', 'equal', 'attention', 'here', 'what', 'masterful', 'job', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Obviously', 'high-budget', 'movie', 'such', 'production', 'quality', 'stuff', 'make', 'think', 'wow', 'are', 'reproach', 'special', 'effects', 'sets', 'are', 'best', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'Batman', 'toys', 'high-tech', 'support', 'are', 'here', 'movie', 'really', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'Batman', 'high-tech', 'arsenal', 'story', 'began', 'first', 'movie', 'now', 'come', 'full-circle', 'up', 'awe-inspiring', 'surprising', 'fitting', 'finale.The', 'story', 'up', 'eight', 'years', 'second', 'movie', 'Batman', 'help', 'Gordon', 'taken', 'blame', 'death', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'death', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'spurred', 'people', 'Gotham', 'pull', 'together', 'enact', 'rather', 'draconian', 'laws', 'order', 'fight', 'criminal', 'elements', 'Eight', 'years', 'very', 'very', 'aggressive', 'tactics', 'have', 'cleaned', 'up', 'city', 'Gotham', 'safe', 'peaceful', 'place', 'live', 'Meanwhile', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'been', 'living', 'very', 'reclusive', 'life', 'holed', 'up', 'mansion', 'Detached', 'Gotham', 'society', 'company', 'billionaire', 'allowed', 'business', 'adversaries', 'gain', 'foothold', 'board', 'rooms', 'Wayne', 'Enterprises.Meanwhile', 'city', 'streets', 'sewers', 'Bane', 'been', 'putting', 'plans', 'together', 'take', 'over', 'city', 'Bane', 'mysterious', 'connection', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'past', 'Bane', 'power', 'grow', 'Bruce', 'now', 'threat', 'Gotham', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'Alfred', 'ever', 'mindful', 'Bruce', 'broken', 'body', 'pleads', 'not', 'don', 'cape', 'again', 'loyal', 'Alfred', 'frankly', 'Bruce', 'now', 'prime', 'can', 'not', 'hope', 'beat', 'Bane', 'fight', 'Alfred', 'not', 'confront', 'Bane', 'Bruce', 'stubbornly', 'get', 'back', 'physical', 'shape', 'Batman', 'could', 'rise', 'once', 'again', 'save', 'city', 'Unwilling', 'have', 'be', 'one', 'bury', 'Bruce', 'Alfred', 'quit', 'job', 'leave', 'mansion.Now', 'alone', 'Bruce', 'up', 'mysterious', 'burglar', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'Gordon', 'hospital', 'recovering', 'run-in', 'Bane', 'thugs', 'young', 'policeman', 'named', 'Blake', 'managed', 'work', 'out', 'true', 'identity', 'Batman', 'Bruce', 'visit', 'Wayne', 'Enterprises', 'ambitious', 'board', 'member', 'Daggett', 'worked', 'out', 'plan', 'Bane', 'would', 'give', 'control', 'company', 'Bruce', 'assets.As', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'brought', 'down', 'as', 'low', 'man', 'could', 'go', 'wealth', 'health', 'gadgets', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'rescue', 'Gotham', 'Bane', 'thugs', 'Yes', 'agree', 'one', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'one', 'slower', 'pace', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'primarily', 'attention', 'here', 'Bruce', 'what', 'character-driven', 'part', 'story', 'Watching', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'care', 'character', 'will', 'make', 'really', 'root', 'back', 'up', 'pit', 'despair.Nolan', 'really', 'gave', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'actor', 'movie', 'know', 'Bale', 'good', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'was', 'teenager', 'Empire', 'Sun', 'now', 'movie', 'established', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'out', 'there', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'played', 'Blake', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'are', 'back', 'respective', 'parts', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'very', 'scary', 'Bane.Ok', 'yes', 'movie', 'superhero', 'not', 'anything', 'Ironman', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'movie', 'dark', 'weighty', 'not', 'light-hearted', 'Ironman', 'movies', 'franchises', 'are', 'good', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'terrific', 'tone', 'films', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day.This', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'perhaps', 'second', 'only', 'Prometheus', 'humble', 'opinion', 'reviewer', 'rented', 'movie', 'XBox', 'can', 'also', 'rent', 'Playstation', 'here', 'movie', 'worth', 'having', 'Blu-Ray', 'library', 'collection', 'would', 'be', 'top', 'list', 'one', 'movies', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'addition', 'respectable', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

1418432,AEL6AD2AL2UX8,B004LWZWGA,,"[1, 2]","The Dark Knight Rises is an entertaining movie, although much different than the other Dark Knight movies.  This one is still an action movie, but there is also a ton of drama involved.  The movie was technically well done, but I wonder if some might be put off by the direction the story went in.  (Possible spoilers up ahead)  There is hardly any Batman in this.  He comes in quick little spurts, but then doesn't really show up until the last half hour, by then some may say `too little - too late'.  Batman and Bruce Wayne have never been played as great as Christian Bale plays him.  He has a charismatic presence on screen.  The filmmakers decided to make Bruce Wayne a recluse who has been hiding out in his mansion for a couple of years after taking the blame for Harvey Dent's death in the previous movie, even though he had nothing to do with it.  The public naturally ostracizes him as they typically do without knowing the facts.  It was unclear as to why Bruce Wayne is limping with a bad knee and body for half the film.  It was uncharacteristically like Bruce Wayne who has always been into taking care of himself.Bruce Wayne and finally Batman do come out from hiding when a new villain more destructive than any other surfaces.  The villain in this movie is a character called ""Bane"" played by Tom Hardy.  The character is evil personified, but he is a big man with a muzzle over his mouth and nose, which is assumed that it helps him to breathe.  The villain is probably the least interesting villain in all Batman and Dark Knight movies, however a lot of uncomfortable deaths happen at his hand or  by the thugs that work for him who are happy to die without question.There was a lot of talk and hype about Anne Hathaway playing Catwoman, but after the movie came out I never heard another thing about it.  I wondered why and after seeing this it was because she was barely in it and when she was on the screen, it was an understated performance.  She was more of a regular person who was also a jewel thief as opposed to the version that Michelle Pfeiffer mastered in Batman Returns as a deranged soul who comes back from the dead.  Pfeiffer's Catwoman is still and will always be iconic, but Anne Hathaway did a great job portraying a different type of Catwoman.  She also had visible emotion and sympathy over the things going on, when Pfeiffer's Catwoman never batted an eye lash, but this is of course due to the script.

1418433,A3OHB78Y7L7ZK,B004LWZWGA,,"[1, 2]","The Dark Knight Rises is the 3rd and final film in the ""Dark Knight Trilogy."" It ties up all the loose ends quite nicely but like the 2008 effort, it runs too long. Great things about this film are the narrative, the characters, the appearance of the bat cave and Tom Hardy's performance as Bane. That's it! The rest falls flat.This film is best described as an exercise in self-indulgence. Christopher Nolan fans have worshipped the man for years, exalting his modus operandi of gritty self-seriousness and faux gravitas without providing Nolan with the constructive criticism that he needs to grow and mature as a filmmaker. Due to the overzealous praise, Nolan's movies have been growing increasingly overlong and ponderous, and his ego has now reached critical mass with this third Batman adventure. Thus, instead of working to improve his directorial technique, Nolan stuck by his usual filmmaking chestnuts here, hoping to get away with bad pacing and pedestrian action scenes by smothering everything in relentless dramatic music and over-complicating a simple narrative to make people believe they're smart for understanding it. This is not to imply that The Dark Knight Rises is a terrible movie, however - it's just a severely flawed, tediously long-winded effort in need of discipline.

1418434,A3I8APG47OVZ1W,B004LWZWGA,,"[1, 2]","This is a very good movie. All of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies have been not just really great comic book movies, they have been really good movies in general, discussing subjects like crime, definitions of justice and heroism, and the nature Batman and (in some cases more importantly) his villains. Batman Begins was a really good movie, and The Dark Knight was such a great movie that it was almost perfect, both as a Batman movie and as an adult crime drama. From the increase in quality between the first two movies, you would expect that the final Nolan movie would be the greatest of them all, building upon the first two movies and bringing it all to a satisfying conclusion in a really grand, climactic fashion, and while this is a very good movie, it doesn't really reach any of its goals. As good as it is, it unfortunately has a few problems that drag it down a bit. Firstly, the hand-to-hand fight scenes are, for the most part, pretty lackluster and boring considering that Batman is supposed to be one of the most highly trained martial artists in the world. Never even got the tiniest sense of that in any of Nolan's movies: the fights are shot too close, the costumes make movement next to impossible, and the editing is so choppy that it is hard to follow. Secondly, I get the impression that Nolan is taking too much advantage of how well known the source material is and not explaining several small but important plot points in the movie: How did Batman get out of whatever country that prison was in so quickly? How did he get back into Gotham without anyone noticing? How did Batman recover from a BROKEN SPINE in a matter of weeks?! I have other questions but they get in to heavy spoiler territory which I am trying to avoid. Some of these are probably at least partially a result of Cristopher Nolan trying too hard to appeal to the fans by setting up situations from well-known Batman stories (Knightfall, No Man's Land, Dark Knight Returns, etc.) when in the context of this movie they don't really help the narrative flow properly. Finally, the ending was not quite as climactic as I was hoping for. Not enough action, and a little too much predictability in the story progression. Finally, this is the worst the Christian Bale Batman voice has ever been. It's over the top, ridiculous, and it makes it really hard to understand what he's saying. Last two are minor complaints overall. But, with all of that said, there is still a lot to like in this movie. Anne Hatheway is a great Catwoman, and Tom Hardy is a really intimidating presence as Bane. The action scenes that are light on fist fighting are pretty damn awesome, and the Batplane is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Like I said, it's a very very GOOD Batman movie, but seeing as its a follow-up to THE DARK KNIGHT, I was just expecting a little bit more. Still, I can easily recommend this for purchase because it's still a Cristopher Nolan Batman movie, and it's the last one we're gonna get.

1418436,A1FOXDQ37C4ITI,B004LWZWGA,,"[1, 2]","This review contains spoiilers. I understand that this movie is trying to be portrayed in the real world, yet there is so much that is unrealistic. Bruce Wayne would never abandon Gotham even if his work was done, and if he did he would always leave a replacment. We will then have to believe that he knew Robin/Blake would find his batcave. But I believe for sure that the real batman would never be so petty as to leave his lifelong father figure Alfred over a woman he never even dated once. Other then that the movie has great action. Bane is truly a bad ass who hammers Gotham into submission. He is truly a force of nature in this movie. That brings me to another problem. I dont believe that Bane would ever be a slave to the wims of anyone wheather it be Talia, or Ra's Al Ghoul. Ra's and Talia are stonch believers in saving the planet also. They would never destroy a city using a atomic weapon. It would have made more sense if he had done it on his own, since he was thrown out of the League of Shadows. But to repeat, Bane is nobody's toy. Talia Al Ghoul was a worthless addition in other words in my opinion.The fight scene between Bane was good, Batman meets a man who can stand up to him face to face. The end result is Batmans near destruction. One more problem is Batmans silly trust in Catwoman. She not only is a thief, takes him to Bane to be killed, but she also leaves him to die in a hole in the ground. Yet he goes and gives her a program, and also still trusts her to save the city.So to repeat. The story has alot of holes, from Bane turning into some simplering love slave, to Batman trusting Catman. There is also alot of great stuff. Bane is a great villain, and there is alot of good action.",4,"Good movie, with some problems.

1418439,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B004LWZWGA,,"[1, 2]","While Christopher Nolan's series of Batman flicks could likely have gone on forever -- earning fistfuls of cash for its producers while forever cluttering shelves with an endless barrage of merchandise -- the director does what any visionary worth his salt would do: He returns to his franchise to put it to rest, effectively quitting while he's ahead. No doubt, Warner Bros. will re-team with DC in a not-too-distant future, inevitably re-booting the series yet again for a new audience and a new profit margin, but in the meantime Nolan's closing chapter, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" provides satisfying closure to a series that has been as brief as it has been remarkable.Re-teaming with his screenwriter/brother Jonathan as well as mythology-maestro David S. Goyer, Nolan laces his final Bat saga with enough character torment, thinly-veiled political musings and crowd-pleasing, fist-pumping action to flood the Bat Cave. In the eight years since the events of ""The Dark Knight,"" Gotham City is a little safer, even if its protectors are a little bitter. Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) lives with a dirty little secret that stands between a peaceful city and total anarchy. Meanwhile, on the other side of the town and taking it harder than anyone else is Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), who limps around the shadows of his mansion while his alter-ego lays dormant. It's only when a mercenary hell-bent on bringing Gotham to its knees (isn't that always the case with these guys?) emerges that The Dark Knight snaps out of his funk and busts out some new gadgets to once again save his broken city from itself. This new threat to Gotham, known only as Bane (Tom Hardy), literally pushes Batman to his breaking point, leaving a rookie detective (Joseph Gordon Levitt) to defend his hero and manipulative jewel-thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) to claw away at whatever is left.While the film admittedly lacks the magnetism of Heath Ledger's performance of The Joker in the previous film, Tom Hardy's formidable Bane does his best to compensate. From the opening scene, Bane's presence is a force to be reckoned with and a far-cry from the hulking, dumb-as-a-brick, WWE-rejected (WWF in those days) mutant he was presented as in 1997's franchise-killing ""Batman & Robin."" Hardy's physical presence as well as his deliciously creepy voice leave a similar impression to Ledger, lending credence to the school of thought that says Batman's villains are just as interesting as the title character himself. Hathaway's take on Catwoman is smart and sleek and true to form, if a bit underdeveloped. Thankfully her presence is a plus, providing a bit of sweetness to Bane's saltiness. Joseph Gordon Levitt, meanwhile, emerges as a new kind of hero who has Bruce Wayne pegged from the get-go and who insists on doing the right thing even as the world crumbles around him. Levitt, who himself has emerged as one of his generations greatest talents in recent years, is another asset to a film that threatens to be over-crowded but thankfully makes room for just about everyone. It's not surprising then that Michael Caine's Alfred and Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox are pushed into the background a bit.Not only is this the longest of Nolan's Bat flicks, it is also perhaps the most dense and ambitious of them all. With so many subplots and so much subtext to juggle, it's a wonder Nolan doesn't drop the ball. It's a testament to the director's vision, as well as that of his collaborators, that the film doesn't falter. Tension escalates from the opening frames and doesn't let up until the film's mind-blowing and thoroughly satisfying conclusion. In many ways, the film will leave you wanting more and more and that's what makes it work so well. While another reboot and perhaps a spinoff (or two) will likely be in order, the fact of the matter is that what Nolan set out to say and do has been effectively said and done by the time the credits roll. The Dark Knight truly rises above and beyond the average superhero fodder, and when all is said and done, Nolan's legacy will stand in limited company. All hype and heroics aside, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a film that lives up to its own promise.",5,The End Is The Beginning Is The End,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,4191,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'series', 'Batman', 'flicks', 'could', 'likely', 'have', 'gone', 'forever', 'earning', 'fistfuls', 'cash', 'producers', 'forever', 'cluttering', 'shelves', 'endless', 'barrage', 'merchandise', 'director', 'what', 'visionary', 'worth', 'salt', 'would', 'do', 'franchise', 'put', 'rest', 'effectively', 'quitting', 'ahead', 'doubt', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'will', 're-team', 'DC', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'inevitably', 're-booting', 'series', 'yet', 'again', 'new', 'audience', 'new', 'profit', 'margin', 'meantime', 'Nolan', 'closing', 'chapter', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'satisfying', 'closure', 'series', 'been', 'as', 'brief', 'been', 'remarkable.Re-teaming', 'screenwriter/brother', 'Jonathan', 'as', 'well', 'mythology-maestro', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'Nolan', 'final', 'Bat', 'saga', 'enough', 'character', 'torment', 'thinly-veiled', 'political', 'musings', 'crowd-pleasing', 'fist-pumping', 'action', 'flood', 'Bat', 'Cave', 'eight', 'years', 'events', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Gotham', 'City', 'little', 'safer', 'even', 'protectors', 'are', 'little', 'bitter', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'dirty', 'little', 'secret', 'peaceful', 'city', 'total', 'anarchy', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'side', 'town', 'taking', 'harder', 'anyone', 'else', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'limps', 'shadows', 'mansion', 'alter-ego', 'lays', 'dormant', 'only', 'when', 'mercenary', 'hell-bent', 'bringing', 'Gotham', 'knees', ""n't"", 'always', 'case', 'guys', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'funk', 'out', 'new', 'gadgets', 'once', 'again', 'save', 'broken', 'city', 'new', 'threat', 'Gotham', 'known', 'only', 'Bane', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'literally', 'Batman', 'breaking', 'point', 'leaving', 'rookie', 'detective', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'defend', 'hero', 'manipulative', 'jewel-thief', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'claw', 'away', 'film', 'admittedly', 'magnetism', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Joker', 'previous', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'formidable', 'Bane', 'best', 'compensate', 'opening', 'scene', 'Bane', 'presence', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'far-cry', 'hulking', 'dumb-as-a-brick', 'WWE-rejected', 'WWF', 'days', 'mutant', 'was', 'presented', '1997', 'franchise-killing', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Hardy', 'physical', 'presence', 'as', 'well', 'deliciously', 'creepy', 'voice', 'leave', 'similar', 'impression', 'Ledger', 'lending', 'credence', 'school', 'thought', 'Batman', 'villains', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'title', 'character', 'Hathaway', 'take', 'Catwoman', 'smart', 'sleek', 'true', 'form', 'bit', 'underdeveloped', 'Thankfully', 'presence', 'plus', 'providing', 'bit', 'sweetness', 'Bane', 'saltiness', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'meanwhile', 'new', 'kind', 'hero', 'who', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'pegged', 'get-go', 'who', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'even', 'world', 'Levitt', 'who', 'emerged', 'one', 'generations', 'greatest', 'talents', 'recent', 'years', 'asset', 'film', 'be', 'over-crowded', 'thankfully', 'room', 'just', 'everyone', 'not', 'surprising', 'then', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'are', 'pushed', 'background', 'bit.Not', 'only', 'longest', 'Nolan', 'Bat', 'flicks', 'also', 'perhaps', 'most', 'dense', 'ambitious', 'so', 'many', 'subplots', 'so', 'much', 'subtext', 'juggle', 'wonder', 'Nolan', ""n't"", 'drop', 'ball', 'testament', 'director', 'vision', 'as', 'well', 'collaborators', 'film', ""n't"", 'falter', 'Tension', 'opening', 'frames', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'film', 'mind-blowing', 'thoroughly', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'more', 'what', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'reboot', 'perhaps', 'spinoff', 'two', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'order', 'fact', 'matter', 'what', 'Nolan', 'set', 'out', 'say', 'do', 'been', 'effectively', 'said', 'done', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'truly', 'average', 'superhero', 'fodder', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Nolan', 'legacy', 'will', 'stand', 'limited', 'company', 'hype', 'heroics', 'aside', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'film', 'up', 'own', 'promise']",N/A

They were re-assembled, and survived the fire that destroyed Wayne Manor?Every single policeman went underground for go after Bane?  This is NOT practical.  Then, they become trapped for months, during winter, and then emerge still looking healthy and clean, as if no time had passed.Bane was able to hold the city hostage for 5 months without any outside intervention?  What was the point of waiting so long?  If his plan was to destroy the city, why not do it sooner?Why would Bane go through all the trouble of sending Bruce Wayne to the desert prison that he was formerly in?  Why not just kill him?  What was the point of keeping your greatest threat alive?  And how did a broke Bruce Wayne get home from the prison so fast?  And how did he enter the city undetected?  This part of the film was nonsensical.How did Bane know that Bruce Wayne was Batman?  During the months that Bane was in Control of Gotham, why didn't he seize Wayne Manor and destroy the Batcave?How did Batman survive the stabbing from Miranda Tate/Talia al Ghul?  She sunk the knife fully into him and twisted the blade to leave the wound open.  He seemed quite immobilized and would surely have lost a significant amount of blood.  Somehow it didn't seem to bother him at all.How did Batman survive the blast radius from the bomb when it clearly showed he was still in the cockpit with less than 5 seconds to go?  I doubt he could have safely ejected and escaped the 6-mile blast radius with such little time.  The fixed autopilot explanation doesn't make sense.It was very convenient to have a wise old man that was also a doctor to help out Bruce Wayne while he was in the desert prison.Apparently the ol' Rocky Balboa formula worked for Bruce Wayne.  A few pushups and pull-ups and he's all back to normal.  Ready for the big fight.Gary Oldman, Michael Cane, and Morgan Freeman are very important to this franchise.  All 3 were extremely under-utilized.  Their characters were absent throughout most of the film.What was the point of Catwoman?  Her character seemed mysterious, but didn't offer anything relevant to the story.  I don't believe anyone truly cared that she was in this movie, aside from the meat-heads that just want a pretty girl to look at.The relationship between Bane and Talia al Ghul seemed like it could have had a greater backstory.  We barely understood how Bane came-to-be, and there was some great potential for those 2 characters to have a deeper relationship.The greatest scene of the movie is the first fight scene between Bane and Batman.  No music, just the fight.  A slow and weak Batman facing a monster and rightfully getting brutally beaten was excellent.  Unfortunately, everything after this moment seemed to get worse and worse.This movie just didn't have the same feel as the first 2 did.  The unbelievable storylines and unrealistic sequence of events made this movie bad.  The pace seemed rushed and slapped-together without anyone questioning why these plot elements are the way they are.  It is definitely the weakest of the 3 films.  Please ask yourself these same questions when watching the film, and hopefully you'll realize:  this doesn't make any sense.",3,Holy Plot Holes Batman!,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,3849,"['what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'finish', 'greatest', 'rendition', 'Batman', 'movie', 'sure', 'left', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'unsatisfied.Right', 'away', '8', 'year', 'gap', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'Everyone', 'still', 'acted', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'death', 'had', 'just', 'happened', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'had', 'passed', 'anyone', 'still', 'feel', 'strongly', 'Batman', 'being', 'responsible', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'death', '8', 'years', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'still', 'be', 'grieving', 'lost', 'love', 'also', 'seemed', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'death', 'had', 'just', 'happened.On', 'head', 'scratchers', 'Bruce', 'mother', 'pearls', 'had', 'tracking', 'system', 'Really', 'necklace', 'was', 'broken', 'night', 'mother', 'murder', 'were', 're-assembled', 'survived', 'fire', 'destroyed', 'Wayne', 'Manor', 'Every', 'single', 'policeman', 'went', 'underground', 'go', 'Bane', 'NOT', 'practical', 'Then', 'become', 'trapped', 'months', 'winter', 'then', 'emerge', 'still', 'looking', 'healthy', 'clean', 'time', 'had', 'passed.Bane', 'was', 'able', 'hold', 'city', 'hostage', '5', 'months', 'outside', 'intervention', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'waiting', 'so', 'long', 'plan', 'was', 'destroy', 'city', 'why', 'not', 'do', 'sooner', 'Why', 'would', 'Bane', 'go', 'trouble', 'sending', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'desert', 'prison', 'was', 'formerly', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'kill', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'keeping', 'greatest', 'threat', 'alive', 'how', 'did', 'broke', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'get', 'home', 'prison', 'fast', 'how', 'did', 'enter', 'city', 'undetected', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'nonsensical.How', 'did', 'Bane', 'know', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'was', 'Batman', 'months', 'Bane', 'was', 'Control', 'Gotham', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'seize', 'Wayne', 'Manor', 'destroy', 'Batcave', 'How', 'did', 'Batman', 'survive', 'stabbing', 'Miranda', 'Tate/Talia', 'al', 'Ghul', 'sunk', 'knife', 'fully', 'twisted', 'blade', 'leave', 'wound', 'open', 'seemed', 'quite', 'immobilized', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'lost', 'significant', 'amount', 'blood', 'Somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'all.How', 'did', 'Batman', 'survive', 'blast', 'radius', 'bomb', 'when', 'clearly', 'showed', 'was', 'still', 'cockpit', 'less', '5', 'seconds', 'go', 'doubt', 'could', 'have', 'safely', 'ejected', 'escaped', '6-mile', 'blast', 'radius', 'such', 'little', 'time', 'fixed', 'autopilot', 'explanation', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.It', 'was', 'very', 'convenient', 'have', 'wise', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'also', 'doctor', 'help', 'out', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'was', 'desert', 'prison.Apparently', 'ol', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'formula', 'worked', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'A', 'few', 'pushups', 'pull-ups', 'back', 'normal', 'Ready', 'big', 'fight.Gary', 'Oldman', 'Michael', 'Cane', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'franchise', '3', 'were', 'extremely', 'under-utilized', 'characters', 'were', 'absent', 'most', 'film.What', 'was', 'point', 'Catwoman', 'character', 'seemed', 'mysterious', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'relevant', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'truly', 'cared', 'was', 'movie', 'aside', 'meat-heads', 'just', 'want', 'pretty', 'girl', 'look', 'at.The', 'relationship', 'Bane', 'Talia', 'al', 'Ghul', 'seemed', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'greater', 'backstory', 'barely', 'understood', 'how', 'Bane', 'came-to-be', 'was', 'great', 'potential', '2', 'characters', 'have', 'deeper', 'relationship.The', 'greatest', 'scene', 'movie', 'first', 'fight', 'scene', 'Bane', 'Batman', 'No', 'music', 'just', 'fight', 'slow', 'weak', 'Batman', 'facing', 'monster', 'rightfully', 'getting', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'was', 'excellent', 'Unfortunately', 'everything', 'moment', 'seemed', 'get', 'worse', 'worse.This', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'feel', 'first', '2', 'did', 'unbelievable', 'storylines', 'unrealistic', 'sequence', 'events', 'made', 'movie', 'bad', 'pace', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'slapped-together', 'anyone', 'questioning', 'why', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'definitely', 'weakest', '3', 'films', 'Please', 'ask', 'same', 'questions', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'realize', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense']",N/A
1418441,AH64XXZBL1T6Z,B004LWZWGA,,"[1, 3]","Christopher Nolan puts the human element front and center, taking the cartoonish out of super heroes and making ""The Dark Night Rises"" seem a lot shorter than 2  hours. The aches and pains of being a super hero or super villain one wouldn't think compelling but in the hands of Nolan and an all-star cast it's riveting. Nolan is producing Superman ""Man of Steel"" for 2013 release. I can't wait.Erstwhile political commentator Rush Limbaugh saw something nefarious in a ""Dark Night"" villain being named Bane in the same year that the Republican presidential nominee is a Bain Capital alumnus. Leaving aside that Bane dates back in the comic books to 1993 and that Nolan and Daniel Goyer wrote their script in 2010, Rush is right that the film may do damage to neoconservatives/establishment Republicans but not in the way that he thinks. The fact that Bane's act of love and protection is the reason for his damaged face/mask does damage to the neocons' simplistic view of evil. That Batman, too, wears a mask because of love and acts of protection and factoring out megalomania and unconcern for collateral damage that he's very much like Bane (they both had the same mentor) is more firepower directed at the unthinking neocon intellectual edifice. Yes, Rush, be afraid, be very afraid.Perhaps Rush can relax because ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the third in Dolan's trilogy although I got the sense that this excellent movie will be seen historically as the end of the beginning. At film's end Detective Blake is ready to pick up the mantle as Robin/Nightwing. Nobody calls him either name until five minutes before closing credits but those with soul to see can tell early on that Blake is on his way to Robinhood.Gary Oldman (""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"") is at his usual tortured excellence as Commissioner Gordon, hiding the terrible secret of District Attorney Harvey Dent's descent into Two-Face madness for the good of Gotham City. Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) goes along to his own psychological detriment/physical endangerment.Dent's legacy reminds us of the double-sidedness of the law - essential for social order yet an instrument of oppression when taken too far (as rigorous enforcement of drug laws today falling disproportionately on the poor demonstrates). Glory-seeking by some police is given respectful, honest treatment.Conservatives will appreciate the treatment Nolan and Goyer give Bane's ""power-to-the people"" revolution. That thievery and kangaroo courts are the main offspring of ""people's"" movements is not something that should surprise any serious student of history although these tendencies are neatly camouflaged by the ""civilization"" we take for granted. Bravo to the script writers for their astuteness about the human psyche.Additional kudos for leaving off the super hero titles which further displays the brokenness of the people. Bruce Wayne doesn't don the Batman suit until at least 30 minutes into the movie. At his heels is Alfred (Michael Caine) pleading for Bruce to help Gotham in a different, more lasting way. Alfred issues a Clubber Lang-type (see ""Rocky III"") warning about Bane that is ignored and their friendship isn't the only thing that gets broken as a result. Selina Kyle is a cynical, reluctant heroine as Catwoman. The fact that she isn't labeled Catwoman makes us listen to her heart.That Noland and Goyer didn't just retell the DC Comics classic ""Knightfall"" tale (available in graphic novel and hardcover book) is in keeping with The New 52 movement launched by DC last year. Both endeavors take pieces from the classical canon and arrange them in new and compelling ways. As the folks at Bain Capital might say, this adds value.Nolan hits it out of the park with a late plot twist revealing that Bane is not the central villain and that the central villain has been hiding in plain sight. Backs are important in this movie - I urge you to study them. The body language communicates itself subtly but assuredly - a pretty face or a mask can hide an evil mind and the key to combating wickedness is to understand what's gone before (or at your back as some might say) and stand boldly for your truth.",5,The human touch,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,4170,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'human', 'element', 'front', 'center', 'taking', 'cartoonish', 'super', 'heroes', 'making', 'Dark', 'Night', 'Rises', 'seem', 'lot', 'shorter', '2', 'hours', 'aches', 'pains', 'being', 'super', 'hero', 'super', 'villain', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'compelling', 'hands', 'Nolan', 'all-star', 'cast', 'riveting', 'Nolan', 'producing', 'Superman', 'Man', 'Steel', '2013', 'release', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait.Erstwhile', 'political', 'commentator', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'saw', 'something', 'nefarious', 'Dark', 'Night', 'villain', 'being', 'named', 'Bane', 'same', 'year', 'Republican', 'presidential', 'nominee', 'Bain', 'Capital', 'alumnus', 'Leaving', 'aside', 'Bane', 'back', 'comic', 'books', '1993', 'Nolan', 'Daniel', 'Goyer', 'wrote', 'script', '2010', 'Rush', 'right', 'film', 'may', 'do', 'damage', 'neoconservatives/establishment', 'Republicans', 'not', 'way', 'fact', 'Bane', 'act', 'love', 'protection', 'reason', 'damaged', 'face/mask', 'damage', 'neocons', 'simplistic', 'view', 'evil', 'Batman', 'too', 'mask', 'love', 'acts', 'protection', 'factoring', 'out', 'megalomania', 'unconcern', 'collateral', 'damage', 'very', 'much', 'Bane', 'had', 'same', 'mentor', 'more', 'firepower', 'directed', 'unthinking', 'neocon', 'intellectual', 'edifice', 'Yes', 'Rush', 'be', 'afraid', 'be', 'very', 'afraid.Perhaps', 'Rush', 'can', 'relax', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'third', 'Dolan', 'trilogy', 'got', 'sense', 'excellent', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'historically', 'end', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'Detective', 'Blake', 'ready', 'pick', 'up', 'mantle', 'Robin/Nightwing', 'Nobody', 'name', 'five', 'minutes', 'closing', 'credits', 'soul', 'see', 'can', 'tell', 'early', 'Blake', 'way', 'Robinhood.Gary', 'Oldman', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'usual', 'tortured', 'excellence', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'hiding', 'terrible', 'secret', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'descent', 'Two-Face', 'madness', 'good', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'along', 'own', 'psychological', 'detriment/physical', 'endangerment.Dent', 'legacy', 'double-sidedness', 'law', 'essential', 'social', 'order', 'yet', 'instrument', 'oppression', 'when', 'taken', 'too', 'far', 'rigorous', 'enforcement', 'drug', 'laws', 'today', 'falling', 'disproportionately', 'poor', 'demonstrates', 'Glory-seeking', 'police', 'given', 'respectful', 'honest', 'treatment.Conservatives', 'will', 'appreciate', 'treatment', 'Nolan', 'Goyer', 'give', 'Bane', 'power-to-the', 'people', 'revolution', 'thievery', 'kangaroo', 'courts', 'are', 'main', 'offspring', 'people', 'movements', 'not', 'something', 'should', 'surprise', 'serious', 'student', 'history', 'tendencies', 'are', 'neatly', 'camouflaged', 'civilization', 'take', 'granted', 'Bravo', 'script', 'writers', 'astuteness', 'human', 'psyche.Additional', 'kudos', 'leaving', 'off', 'super', 'hero', 'titles', 'further', 'brokenness', 'people', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', ""n't"", 'don', 'Batman', 'suit', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'heels', 'Alfred', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'pleading', 'Bruce', 'help', 'Gotham', 'different', 'more', 'lasting', 'way', 'Alfred', 'issues', 'Clubber', 'Lang-type', 'see', 'Rocky', 'III', 'warning', 'Bane', 'ignored', 'friendship', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'broken', 'result', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'cynical', 'reluctant', 'heroine', 'Catwoman', 'fact', ""n't"", 'labeled', 'Catwoman', 'listen', 'heart.That', 'Noland', 'Goyer', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'retell', 'DC', 'Comics', 'classic', 'Knightfall', 'tale', 'available', 'graphic', 'novel', 'hardcover', 'book', 'keeping', 'New', '52', 'movement', 'launched', 'DC', 'last', 'year', 'endeavors', 'take', 'pieces', 'classical', 'canon', 'arrange', 'new', 'compelling', 'ways', 'folks', 'Bain', 'Capital', 'might', 'say', 'value.Nolan', 'park', 'late', 'plot', 'twist', 'revealing', 'Bane', 'not', 'central', 'villain', 'central', 'villain', 'been', 'hiding', 'plain', 'sight', 'Backs', 'are', 'important', 'movie', 'urge', 'study', 'body', 'language', 'subtly', 'assuredly', 'pretty', 'face', 'mask', 'can', 'hide', 'evil', 'mind', 'key', 'combating', 'wickedness', 'understand', 'what', 'gone', 'before', 'back', 'might', 'say', 'stand', 'boldly', 'truth']",N/A

1418444,AIEKMVNA4SBVA,B004LWZWGA,,"[1, 4]","Probably one of the most anticipated releases with all knowing this would be Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale's last go with the Batman series. Being a fan of the 1989 movie with Keaton and watching the next 3 get cluttered with too many plots/sub-plots/villains and special effects sadly, Dark Knight Rises is just cluttered with artsy/fartsy crap. What made the 1989 Batman film great was it was a story one could follow. Batman=good guy / Joker=bad guy! We see how the Joker comes to be and, while Batman already is the story goes through to show how The Joker when young, killed Brice Wayne's parents thus giving genesis to Wayne's destiny to become Batman. A simple story with just the right amount of cast and effects to support and tell it.After the 1989 film grew to silly with shift in directors and stars I appreciated the first of this series --- though the whole going off for to the far East for ninja training and all could have been shortened in my opinion --- because it went back to that dark look and basics. The Dark Knight had moments of excess I could do without and, unlike the rest of the planet, I didn't care for the portrayal of The Joker as some dirty Manson-like thing in make-up. I preferred Nicholson's portrayal as a more classy villain yet just as psychotic and ruthless.Like some have mentioned the whole Robin deal was bad. Plus, the whole deal of having Bruce/Batman incapacitated only to retire, with Batman believed to be a murderer throughout was also bad. I would've preferred Batman had risen, had experimental surgery, whatever to be 100% whole and, at the end, to have stood atop a building in silhouette of the Bat Signal having the movie end with Batman's reputation and strength intact to fight on.No doubt another actor/director will come along and regurgitate the series again with the rampant lack of imagination in Hollywood these days. We have another rebirth of Spiderman, why? they did 2 Hulk's less than 4 years apart...again why? I wish (1) the Hollywood morons would know when to quit beating a dead horse and (2) for the same morons to understand less is more, explosions and special effects are to go with the telling of the story not make up for LACK of one!As Stallone, vocally and publicly disappointed with Rocky V did by basically doing Rocky VI....to right the wrong and allow the franchise a proper conclusion I feel Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale almost OWE THE PUBLIC that added many millions to their bank accounts a 4th. One in which The Joker returns and a repaired, 100% Batman returns.....as would his alter Bruce Wayne from the dead. They could include Robin or not. Stop yanking around with so much ambiguity and work within the confines of simple bad guy against good guy and plausible reason without mystic nonsense.

So many ridiculous things happened that I lost count. I KNOW it is based on a comic book, but if you are going for modern times believeability, at least try to make sense. There was no comedy at all in this which could have helped some of the huge plot holes. Some of my ""favorite"" things were...All the ""poor"" people of Gotham just decide to destroy the no crime peace and take down anyone who has any money. Yeah, that's a good idea because somebody with a face mask and a few guns thinks it's a good idea. Maybe they couldn't understand what country his accent was from because it kept moving from country to country.The 3000 cops just rush the automatic weapons and manage to subdue them with fists while Batman and Bane duke it out. Can't one of the cops manage to use a gun and shot him while this is going on? Millions of lives are at stake-wouldn't want to be a hero and do the right thing.And what is with Batman not using a gun? Gee, you think he might WANT to after thousands get killed because he doesn't and millions could die later? Where is the Bat Logic?

1418446,A2ZFHK015YXP6U,B004LWZWGA,,"[1, 5]","Me: ""you don't NEED to make another Batman film! You have given us everything!""Nolan: ""Not everything, not yet.""The Dark Knight Rises borrows many elements from The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Knightfall, but DO NOT think this is a straight forward adaptation of those storys. This just borrows some key plot elements, and becomes a stand alone movie. It's alot like what Nolan did with Batman Begins, as that one was heavily inspired by Batman: Year one, but became its own story.WARNING: I may SPOIL The SECOND installment, The DARK KNIGHT, in DETAIL.So at the end of The Dark Knight, Batman took the blame for Harvey Dents fall, now becoming enemy number 1 of the police. The Dark Knight Rises takes place 8 years after the Dark Knight, and as it turns out, Bruce Wayne gave up Batman and is now retired. Meanwhile, Gotham City is currently celebrating a time of peace. The Joker was captured at the end of The Dark Knight (and although his fate is uncertain in this film, all you need to know is that he's gone) and the police have cleaned up the rest of Gotham. Although peace has been achieved in Gotham, our heros have pretty much been eaten alive by this lie. Bruce Wayne hung up the Batman symbol, but never moved on. He is a recluse in Wayne Manor, not knowing what to really do with is life. As for Jim Gordan, lets just say he has been messed up the most mentally after Dark Knight. His wife has left him, and he has been speeking this lie for 8 years, PRAISING Dent going ""oh, Harvey Dent, truth, justice, and the american way!"" while thinking ""yeah, Harvey Dent, the jerk that tried to kill my own son!"". So in a way, Jim Gordan is on his own, having nothing but this lie he has to live with.Things change, however, when our terrorist Bane steps in Gotham. He has one purpose: take control of Gotham. He starts a series of attacks in Gotham, forcing Bruce Wayne to pick up the mantle of Batman again to reclaim his city. Of course, there is much more to Banes plan, as he wants to break Batman both mentally and physically. Why? Because Bane is associated with a previous villain in this series, and seeks revenge. This all leeds to a number of sub plots and character arcs (along with the introduction of several new characters) all leading up to an ending where everything is tied together.The POSITIVES:-The writing is great (not as great as Begins and The Dark Knight, but still great).-The action and effects are sensational! 90 percent of the action of this film is done with practical effects and death defying stunt work. There isn't really an iconic ""money shot"" scene like the truck flip in the Dark Knight, but the action is still really good. Also, the fist fights between Batman and Bane aren't as good as they should be, but are still alright, and improved over Begins and Dark knight. But, the dialogue between Batman and Bane makes up for it.-The acting is incredible. The characters are written and portrayed well, and are all great. There are probably too many characters to take in one film, but, they are all still done well, and you don't want any of them to have been cut out of the film.-There are some great moralls too. Plenty of emotion, and some good character analysis.-The ending: there are no words to describe but EPIC. It's written great, filmed great, and acted great. Somehow, Chris Nolan wraped everything up PERFECTLY, and I am shocked he was able to do so. Trust me, he MEANT IT when he said this would be the final Batman film of this series.SURPRISES:-One of the main charcters in this film was Anne Hathaway as Catwoman. Her role isn't EXTREMELY pivotal to the plot, but important to Bruce Waynes story, and she has plenty of screen time. I didn't think Hathaway would be a good Catwoman, at all, but I was wrong! She was cast PERFECTLY, and gave a great performance. Tom Hardy I already new would be a great Bane (and he was).-In The Dark Knight Rises, ALOT of new characters are introduced, but thankfully, almost every character gets enough screentime, and they all give great performances.-Another newcomer particularly is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who gives a great performance as Officer John Blake. Although an original character by Nolan, he has several chatracteristics of a few charcters from the comics. He was acted and written so well, that I WANT to see this John Blake character in the comics.-And lets not forget the plot twists. There are moments of BRILLIANCE in this film. Obiously I won't spoil the plot twists for anyone though. Sure, I saw 1 or 2 of them coming, but there were a few I DID NOT expect.The NEGATIVES:-one nitpick I have is how Batman immediatly retired after Dents cover up. Instead, I would have stated Bruce continued  to be Batman for 2 or 3 years (as a fugitive being hunted by the police) and slowly faded away, and by the point of this film, he has only been retired for a couple years. This is only a nitpick, since the starting off point of the film would stay the same, and this change wouldn't have made much difference to the plot. And it would still take place 8 years later, the only difference being he has just been retired for a couple years, instead of all 8.-Banes voice is an issue for alot of people. Trust me, you can understand him... 97 percent of them time. There are a few lines of dialogue that you can't quite understand, but overall, the voice was fine. BUT, in the opening, Banes voice was TERRIBLE! Yeah, I could understand him, but you couldn't help but laugh whenever he talked. After the opening act, however, they got the tone right, and Bane started to sound cool later, just bad in the opening.-editing was alright, but felt kind of ""choppy"" at times.-The pacing was good for the length, but still not that great.-alot of people think the film was too long. I disagree, I thought it was to SHORT!-The movie is 2 and a half hours long, but, this movie is the definition of a 3 hour movie. If it was just 15 minutes longer, almost all of my problems would be fixed.. The pacing would have been better, and the film just would have ""flowed"" better, instead of feeling clutered with information. And considering that some of our most successful films (Titanic, Lord of the Rings, and a few others) are well OVER 3 hours, I doubt extra length would have been a negative effect on this film in any way.-Despite the large amount of characters cramed into 2 and a half hours, most of the characters get enough screen time, except for one. Marion Cotillard as Wayne interprise member Miranda Tate. She gets a good amount of screentime, but still needed more. If the film was 10 to 15 minutes longer, 5 extra minutes JUST with her would have given her character more time. She was the one character that just didn't get enough development.-I have a few other nitpicks, but only a few are worth mentioning. There is a scene with a bank robbery in broad daylight, but 8 minutes later, it's pitch black! And when it comes to the plot midway through, it may seem a little illogical, but no more than Batman Begins or Dark Knight, so you can't question what is realistic and what isn't WITHOUT questioning the others. You can't ask one question without asking another.Overall, The Dark Knight Rises is, whether you like it or not, a good film, and an incredible ending to Chris Nolans trilogy. And alot of people complain about the ending, saying ""MY Batman wouldn't do this!"" well, it's not anyone elses Batman in this series, it's Chris Nolans Batman. We all have out own interpretation of the Batman character, and Chris Nolan gives us his. And personally, I don't think Chris Nolan could have ended his take any better. So, if you ignore the comics, forget your personal opinion on the Batman mythology, and view The Dark Knight Rises as a STAND ALONE MOVIE, you should be fine. The main reason why the ending works is BECAUSE it's forshadowed in the previous 2 films (if you payed attention, of course). ""if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, you will become something else entirely. A legend."" As a man he can be destroyed, but as a symbol, he can live forever. THAT is a comman theme illustrated in this entire trilogy. If you can accept that, then you should know that The Dark Knight Rises has a very fitting end.If you liked Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, there is no good reason to NOT like this one. If you liked Begins (but didn't care for The Dark Knight) this should be a pleasant surprise, as this movie ties in ALOT to Begins, and I would even reccomend everyone to rewatch Begins before viewing Rises. But, if you DIDN'T care for Begins or Dark Knight, this film probably won't win you over, but everyone should still check this out. For me, this film gave me everything: Suspense, action, genius writing, great performances, 2 great cameos, plot twists, and an incredible ending, Nolan book ends everything as a trilogy should.Another word of warning: If you are looking for a nonstop ""Batman"" film, well, this may not be for you. This movie features less screentime for Bruce Wayne in the Batsuit than any other Batman movie. But that's the point. We got plenty of Batman in The Dark Knight, so now, we have Bruce Waynes story being completed.If you don't like Chris Nolans take on Batman, that's fine, but don't HATE on these movies just because they aren't for you. Sure, it is pretty illogical at times, but just as much as every other movie in existance. And if someone is going to tear this film apart over nitpicks or small plotholes, trust me, if I tried I could EASILY do that to any other movie. Just acknowledge that these ARE good films, instead of complaining about what you DON'T like. It's not that I ignore the problems in this movie, it's because there is MUCH more good than bad, so I can still give it 5 stars.Also, some people were dissapointed with The Dark Knight Rises because the expectations were SO overwhelmingly high. PLEASE, do NOT let your expectations get the best of you! Think logically (like me) before viewing this movie. Sure, this film isn't 10 times better than Dark Knight as that was to Begins, but, it's still great! I still love all 3 chapters of this trilogy (something alot of trilogys fail at).So, if you enjoyed Batman Begins and Dark Knight (and payed attention to the themes illustrated in them) you should enjoy this. Is this the PERFECT everything a fanboy could want Batman film? Well, no. But heck it'll do! It's still a great Batman movie, and succeeds in doing what was most important: giving the trilogy a fitting ending. Sure, the movie isn't perfect, but quite frankly, a perfect film just doesn't exist.And if there is anything else that anyone is confused or scratching their head about, please comment. After seeing this film 3 times, I have been able to explain nearly every plothole or problem I had when I watched it the first time. If you were confused in any way, feel free to ask questions :)Everyone should check this out, as it is a truly incredible ending to this amazing trilogy.Me: ""I never said thank you.""Nolan: ""and you will never have to.""",5,The epic finale to the dark knight legend...,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,11090,"['Me', 'do', ""n't"", 'NEED', 'make', 'Batman', 'film', 'have', 'given', 'everything',

Starts off 8 years after Batman has become public enemy number 1 in Gotham to avoid tarnishing the mage of Two Face Harvey Dent and in that time Bruce has become a recluse who has nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises with some nuclear power project. Then one day arch criminal Bane comes along and steals this nuclear device and turns it into a bomb to hold Gotham to ransom. Agains the wishes of Alfred who leaves him in objection Bruce once again dons the bat suit. He goes has his first encounter with Bane and the result is he has his back broken bones sticking out and all and then taken to a far off land by Bane and thrown into some prison in a deep pit. Well after a couple of months in the pit with no medical attention Bruce's broken back heals, he is fitter than he has ever been and manages to climb out of this pit which it turns out Bane was the only one before him whoever managed. Well Bruce somehow gets back to Gotham gets himself a new bat suit goes to have another showdown with Bane but this time he kicks his ass but just as he is on the verge of finishing him off Bruce gets literally stabbed in the back by his new love interest who turns out is the brains behind the whole plan of Bane's and is the daughter of the late Rhas Al Ghul. Cat Woman ( now Batman's ally ) and with a good old fashioned shotgun kills Mr super strong Bane who has had his trigger on a nuclear weapon and creating mayhem in the city for months. ( If only Bruce had thought of that first time round ). Well Rhas Al Ghul's daughter steals the nuke and arms it oh no it looks like Gothem is about to go up un a mushroom cloud until Batman gets out his flying machine and flies the nuke out tosea where it detonates away from Gotham.  Result is the people of Gotham now see Batman as a hero and build him a statue, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, a rookie cop John Blake who has been helping Batman and Gordon who now both know his secret identity along with Alfred hold a funeral for Bruce at Wayne Manor which has been left to the orphans, turns out Blake's real name is Robin and he quits the police to go work with the orphans and he discovers the bat cave. It finishes with Alfred taking a holiday abroad and he is sitting in a restaurant and he sees sitting at a table across the room Bruce Wayne having a romantic dinner with Cat Woman. They acknowledge each other but say nothing. So looks like Batman can even survive nuclear bombs Between all this there are lots of plots and sub plots which seem to fizzle out before they reach a conclusion. All in all this film was to long and the story was lousy & unbelievable. Its just a shame that such a good series of films was concluded by this rubbish.",1,"160 minutes of movie, 15 minutes of Batman and no real plot",1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,2913,"['film', 'really', 'was', 'awful', 'other', 'fact', 'much', 'long', 'Batman', '15', 'minutes', 'when', 'more', 'supporting', 'character', 'Bane', 'story', 'story', 'just', 'wacky', '8', 'years', 'Batman', 'become', 'public', 'enemy', 'number', '1', 'Gotham', 'avoid', 'tarnishing', 'mage', 'Two', 'Face', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'time', 'Bruce', 'become', 'recluse', 'who', 'nearly', 'bankrupted', 'Wayne', 'Enterprises', 'nuclear', 'power', 'project', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'criminal', 'Bane', 'along', 'steals', 'nuclear', 'device', 'bomb', 'hold', 'Gotham', 'ransom', 'wishes', 'Alfred', 'who', 'objection', 'Bruce', 'once', 'again', 'bat', 'suit', 'first', 'encounter', 'Bane', 'result', 'back', 'broken', 'bones', 'sticking', 'out', 'then', 'taken', 'far', 'land', 'Bane', 'thrown', 'prison', 'deep', 'pit', 'Well', 'couple', 'months', 'pit', 'medical', 'attention', 'Bruce', 'broken', 'back', 'heals', 'fitter', 'ever', 'been', 'climb', 'pit', 'out', 'Bane', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'whoever', 'managed', 'Well', 'Bruce', 'somehow', 'back', 'Gotham', 'new', 'bat', 'suit', 'have', 'showdown', 'Bane', 'time', 'ass', 'just', 'verge', 'finishing', 'off', 'Bruce', 'literally', 'stabbed', 'back', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'out', 'brains', 'whole', 'plan', 'Bane', 'daughter', 'late', 'Rhas', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'Cat', 'Woman', 'now', 'Batman', 'ally', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'shotgun', 'kills', 'Mr', 'super', 'strong', 'Bane', 'who', 'had', 'trigger', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'creating', 'mayhem', 'city', 'months', 'only', 'Bruce', 'had', 'thought', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'Well', 'Rhas', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'daughter', 'nuke', 'arms', 'Gothem', 'go', 'up', 'un', 'mushroom', 'cloud', 'Batman', 'out', 'flying', 'machine', 'nuke', 'out', 'tosea', 'where', 'away', 'Gotham', 'Result', 'people', 'Gotham', 'now', 'see', 'Batman', 'hero', 'build', 'statue', 'Alfred', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'rookie', 'cop', 'John', 'Blake', 'who', 'been', 'helping', 'Batman', 'Gordon', 'who', 'now', 'know', 'secret', 'identity', 'Alfred', 'hold', 'funeral', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Manor', 'been', 'left', 'orphans', 'out', 'Blake', 'real', 'name', 'Robin', 'police', 'go', 'work', 'orphans', 'bat', 'cave', 'Alfred', 'taking', 'holiday', 'abroad', 'sitting', 'restaurant', 'sitting', 'table', 'room', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'having', 'romantic', 'dinner', 'Cat', 'Woman', 'acknowledge', 'other', 'say', 'nothing', 'So', 'Batman', 'can', 'even', 'survive', 'nuclear', 'bombs', 'are', 'lots', 'plots', 'sub', 'plots', 'seem', 'fizzle', 'out', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'film', 'was', 'long', 'story', 'was', 'lousy', 'unbelievable', 'just', 'shame', 'good', 'series', 'films', 'was', 'concluded', 'rubbish']",N/A
1418450,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B004LWZWGA,,"[18, 46]","Let's start with the only big positive from this movie - Ann Hathaway as Selina Kyle (the name of Catwoman never appears in the movie) was just terrific - lithe, athletic, slinky, sexy, cool, empowered, and better at fighting than Batman.  She's probably the best and most dynamic Catwoman ever, displacing Michelle Pfeiffer's more neurotic version from first place at last.And she is the only reason not to give this movie zero stars.Some terrific actors are in this movie, which drags back characters from the previous two movies, either freshly on camera or in photos or flashbacks (e.g., Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul, Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow).  Curious, only Heath Ledger's Joker did not re-appear in any form or even in a brief mention.Unfortunately most of the characters get wasted in this tedious, overly long and complicated plot which absolutely makes no sense at all.Yes, I like plot and logical character development and there was none of that here in this movie.****SPOILERS*****Worst of all, for an action movie, the action scenes were poorly done.  OK, the opening sequence with the air to air hijacking was mildly interesting, but I got distracted because during the scene I kept wondering, hey why is that agent torturing the prisoners to find out which one of them is Bane, when one of the prisoners with a hood on turns out to be Bane, mask and all?  Presumably his captors saw him that way BEFORE THEY PUT THE HOOD ON.  And Bane is massively bigger than anybody else, so it's not like he's hard to pick out from a crowd, right?Lots of gigantic plot holes like that in this movie.Two really cheesy fight scenes - one where Batman flies in with his Batplane, shoots off the cannon of one of the stolen Batmobiles, and then GETS OUT OF THE BATPLANE to fight Bane mano a mano.  Huh?  Why not just stay in the Batplane and mow him down?And then the charge of the blue brigade fight at the end - ahem - one does not charge en mass down a street packed shoulder to shoulder when your opponents have automatic AK-47s and you are armed only with pistols.  Human wave attacks against machine guns went out of fashion in the Western world at the Somme, 96 years ago.  Even more stupifying, the crooks armed with automatic weapons don't just take cover and mow down the charging cops, THEY STOP FIRING AND CHARGE OUT TO FIGHT HAND-TO-HAND WITH THE COPS.A seriously cheesy CGI moment in this film - I wish filmmakers could figure out how to do a nuclear blast properly.  Try doing some research for starters.  There are archival films of scores of nuclear explosions over water that are more terrifying than the one in this movie, which looked like it was part of a beginner art student's matte painting of a stereotypical mushroom cloud.Alfred is reduced to a blubbering nag, Commissioner Gordon is reduced to fumbling and stumbling around, and the two main new characters introduced - Joseph Gorden-Levitt and Marion Cotillard undergo way too many plot twists that again leave me asking, Huh?Bruce Wayne's story arc here in this movie is just a total mess.  Can you spell Deus ex machina?  Miraculous to have somebody paraplegic from massive spine trauma suddenly get up and start walking, much less regain full form fighting skills.And Bane, poor Tom Hardy - did he really bulk himself up with 40 pound of muscle only to show this muscle in just a few seconds of film footage?  The rest of the time, Bane could have been played by an extra like David Prowse, behind that mask and that bulky clothing, and nobody would have been wiser.  What a waste of talent and muscle.  Bane's story arc needless to say is also all twisty and barely makes sense.  And his ending ... wow, the very definition of anti-climax ....One of the final scenes, with Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a cafe in France, now that was touching, and reflected well the sexual tension between the two that flashed only occasionally in this movie.Too bad, this could have been a terrific movie if it had just focused more on those two.",2,"Bloated, tedious movie, awful action sequences.

1418455,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B004LWZWGA,,"[2, 4]","Something has always bugged me about Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. Not their tightly plotted stories or gritty urban-realist design, which make the Burton/Schumacher films look dated and primitive. Nor the justification for vigilantism, which I couldn't criticize better than comics writer Alan Moore already has. But watching The Dark Knight Rises, I finally realized: Nolan has turned Batman into a fascist tract.Batman has long represented mighty justice, emerging from shadows to deal swift comeuppance to criminals. But unlike blindfolded, scales-bearing Themis, Batman makes no pretence of impartiality. He maintains hip-pocket alliances with cops, dispenses summary justice that any judge would discard, and openly disdains due process. He's every frazzled parent's ultimate Hail Mary pass: stay in line, or some black-clad bogeyman will serve physical comeuppance.This makes sense in the Depression-era milieu that first birthed Batman. In an age of rampant official corruption, seeing a rich socialite use his wealth for eleemosynary ends must have gratified countless teens. Even today, when sensational crime stories lead nightly newscasts, Batman seems like a bastion against tides of urban lawlessness. Christian Bale conveys this raspy-throated image of bootleg vengeance with understated elegance.But that description, which accurately embodies Nolan's first two Batman films, rings hollow here. Once decaying, Gotham has enjoyed eight years of peace, defined herein as ""order."" Sharp-suited tycoons feel safe walking the streets. Where contract murder once ruled Gotham, the city has turned a skilled jewel thief into their local celebrity. Gotham has achieved a pre-9/11 state of decadent complacence.Note that the situation for common Gothamites hasn't improved. Selena Kyle and her partner live in squalor equal to any number of windows Batman peeped through during crime's heyday. But the ""Dent Act"" prevents bottom-feeders from threatening the hierarchy. After eight years, Gotham maintains the same mayor and police commissioner, suggesting that city governance is decided on high; elections occur to ratify decisions over which citizens have no power.Into this environment of bread and circuses--that is, parties and football--rides Tom Hardy as Bane, who begins as a mercenary but adopts the stylings of populism, repeatedly offering to return Gotham to ""you, the people."" By this he doesn't mean Jeffersonian ideals of an informed, engaged citizenry; instead, Bane constructs an army of riff-raff to enforce his Maoist social design. His first act is to open the jails and establish a convict-run kangaroo court.Thus Nolan presents Gotham an unpalatable choice: either comply with the hierarchy, or give command of their city to its lowest members. Nolan lards the narrative with allusions to Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. His inescapable moral: we choose which form of manifest social injustice to accept. Do we prefer peaceful subservience under the hierarchy, or chaotic Reign-of-Terror rule by the commune's foulest denizens?Batman, with his wealth and technology, could use this opportunity to reject both choices. But with his hovercraft, pulleys, and access to vantage points, he literally stands on high, fighting to restore the old order. It's like if, amid Cold War desperation, an avenging angel chose to reinvest feudal domains and divinely anointed kings. Batman chooses the tyranny of peaceful mediocrity over the tyranny of an uprising he cannot control.Importantly, when Batman dispenses justice from on high, he doesn't represent the Christian God. When Bane dynamites the prison gates, he says: ""the powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests, and cast out into the cold world that we know and endure."" Compare the Virgin Mary's praise in Luke 1:52-53: God ""has brought down rulers from their thrones, but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things, but has sent the rich away empty.""Like Nietzsche, Batman rejects Christian and Platonist ideals of justice, favoring something older and more savage. Forced to choose between Bane's Bolshevik militia and Batman leading a phalanx of uniformed cops, Gotham itself has no choice. The city's champion chooses for them, throwing his support and physical strength behind a legal superstructure which even Commissioner Gordon admits he built on a lie. Gotham's citizens have but one choice: to submit.Early in the film, Bane calls himself ""necessary evil."" Commissioner Gordon might describe Batman as equally necessary. But social theorist Jacques Ellul wrote: ""necessity never establishes legitimacy; the world of necessity is a world of weakness, a world that denies man."" If Batman simply embodies the form of injustice Gotham can accept, perhaps Ra's al Ghul was right. Time has come to burn it down and start over.",2,The Day the Batman Surrendered,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,4844,"['Something', 'always', 'bugged', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'movies', 'Not',

1418456,A380H0RPMMOG3E,B004LWZWGA,,"[2, 4]","The Dark Knight Rises suffers from about two too many characters. I will start with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He is on the screen quite frequently and is about as interesting as watching rocks dry. Sorry, but he is. I won't spoil what happens with him but suffice to say I wanted to put my fist through my tv.Next up? Matthew Modine. Another character we could have done completely without. Adds nothing to the film. And yet he is seen a lot, too. This film is nearly 3 hours long. I could have cut a dozen scenes and it would have been a better film.The good? Well, the good is very good. Bale is back and, to me, this is his best performance. He has been good in all three. Maybe great, but here he is at his very best, which surprised me.Anne Hathaway. She makes the most of every moment she is on screen. Which isn't often enough for me. But she is compelling at Catwoman. She is really very good, in or out of the suit. She makes a much better companion to Batman than any Robin.Caine, Oldman and Freeman? All back and great.Tom Hardy as Bane? Good, but not great and maybe it's unfair because he is inevitably going to be compared to Ledger and that is an impossible standard. But I thought Hardy was certainly better than most Batman villains on the big screen.Marion Cotillard as Miranda? Good and bad. I won't go into why because it could spoil some of the fun.It is most certainly the most spectacular of the Batman films with an array of effects and images that rise well above the rest.

In recent years, storytelling in movies seems to become a dying art.Like our culture is too busy to deal with a mature plot and a good story.Not so in Batman. The plot is layered and each character gets an interesting back story.You don't have to have seen the last movie with the Joker to get what is going on because they do flashbacks. But it helps if you saw the very first Batman. It is three hours long  and I noticed most of the kids and some tweens looked either very scared  or really bored and miserable. Although one very little boy who looked about 6 or 7 seemed to be having a blast.Their are so many amazing actors in this movie, but I will only highlight two.Watching Joseph Gordon Levitt in  a juicy meaty role as a young but tough beat cop was a joy for me. I used to love him in different Disney movies when I was a kid. Even then you could tell he was more than just a cute kid.The scene in which Batman ends up in a pit like prison was beyond tedious. It was forty five minutes to a hour of him trying trying to get out of there. It should of been 15 20 minutes tops. Also, I didn't need to see Batman getting his vertebrae cracked back into place. I know it is a part of life, and I am too sensitive but, it was freaky for me and for the eleven year olds sitting next to me. Also too much time of Batman moping around in the beginning.Loved Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, she usually plays the same goody goody character over and over again. Although they should stop making her wear super red lipstick. It is not her color. There was no cheese to her part whatsoever, unlike some of the previous cat woman. There are no cats hanging around whatsoever, she acts like your typical tempermental cat. It was nice to see her branch and try something else.

Miss Cotillard has whole sentences that are key to an understanding of her character that are barely intelligible at a crucial plot point. Surely, whoever designed the audio mix has some explaining to do.Otherwise, fans will get their money's worth of action and thrills despite a lumbering plot that takes far too long to unwind after a breathtaking opening shot involving mid-air hostages.And the performances are uniformly fine from the large cast--Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Matthew Modine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine. But the flaws are there in the script which has too many strands of sub-plots to cover and too many humiliating fights between Bane and Batman before the man of steel redeems himself again.Nevertheless, there are moments where it kicks into high gear between some dull stretches. Christopher Nolan sees to it that the action sequences are given top priority to any other values inherent in the script. All of the gadgets are as slick as ever.Personally, I still prefer the first and second ""Batman"" films to this one which is sometimes too muddled in content.

I don't want to give too much away, but here is what bugged me the most. First of all, I've watched ""The Dark Knight"" about 20 times. Am I missing something crucial here? Because I do not remember Batman getting so messed up at the end of that movie that he is left a decrepit cripple. Secondly, Bane was the worst villain we've seen in these films. Yeah, he's a big bad guy. I get that. But he looks like Brian Urlacher in a Hannibal Lecter mask with a pair of man boobs. That's more laughable than intimidating. Also, I have complained about Christian Bale's muffled Batman voice throughout this entire series, which gets harder to understand with every film. However, Bane's mumbles make Batman sound like the Enunciation King. Bane sounds like he has marbles in his mouth the entire time. I am not a comic book reader, but I am also confused about how a certain person could have his back broken in a movie, and then be up chasing people around again in just a couple of scenes. Hmm.There were a couple of good things about the film. I adore Marion Cotillard in everything she does and thought her performance was amazing in this film. I enjoyed the twist with her character at the end, which I did not anticipate. I also liked this new interpretation of the Catwoman character. Anne Hathaway is usually a very overrated actress, in my opinion, but I thought she delivered a solid performance this time around (although I still wish someone else had been cast in that role, because AH just really bugs me). Still, the twist at the end involving what becomes of Selina Kyle was a disappointment. It was unexpected and unbelievable, in my opinion. What a lame way to end a trilogy that had been so exciting up to this point.I waited a long time to see this movie, and I really expected it to be better than it was.

It's a Christopher Nolan-directed Christian Bale-staring Batman film which brought back Catwoman/Selina Kyle. So nothing could go wrong?Umm...The Selina Kyle/Catwoman in this film is not as likeable as Michelle Pffeifer's role. She's a con-artist who's not that smart despite already having hung around the less desirable elements of society. Sheesh!Selina believes that corrupt businessman John Daggett will help her expunge the record if she delivers stolen Wayne Enterprises merchandise. Unlike Wayne, Daggett represents capitalism-industrialism gone corrupt. He's only using money to benefit himself and does not care about improving the human condition. This is an especially interesting parallel to make against today's economy.Selina comes around to realizing what to actually do, that prior consciousness raising just did not add any 'good' tension to the screenplay. Her earlier role is not as wholly likeable for audiences.I liked the movie, but the screenplay would have been fantastic if it did re-establish just the right kind of characters and character relationships.

1418469,ACYGH6TENYS76,B004LWZWGA,,"[3, 5]","As far as trilogy enders go (Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Santa Clause) this is hands down awesome...but that's only because the bar has been set so low. I'd rate The Dark Knight Rises slightly ahead of Star Wars III, but it doesn't hold up to the standards of quality set in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.The pacing was forced, the story illogical, and a sense that this was Batman you were seeing, but that everything was trying to be wrapped up prematurely, like half the development team was doing their job and the other half just wanted to get it over with and get paid.*Spoilers*Bruce Wayne losing Wayne Corporation: between his wits and Lucius Fox that would never happen, nor would they build a fusion reactor without realizing beforehand that the technology could be converted into a bomb. That's an oversight neither man would make. Second, Bruce's personal fortune would not be tied up in a single location for someone to steal with a thumb print at the stock exchange. He would have bank accounts, etc that would be uneffected, so the idea of him being broke is ridiculous. Still, the way the movie is filmed it seems plausible if you don't think too hard and just go along for the ride, as most people seem to do with movies.Catwoman: pleasant surprise to see Anne Hathaway fit the roll so well. Her acting saved a badly written part, for her betraying Batman to his death then falling in love with him makes no sense, nor does Batman's telling her she's making a serious mistake and then is all 'forgive and forget' later. He didn't even punch her once for that, even though he nearly died.The Bat Plane: Fox says it's just another Wayne prototype...so where's it been the past 8 years? If it had been something Fox had been working on in the interim, fine, but he doesn't say that, so why didn't he give this to Bruce in Batman Begins? That said, the design and function is awesome. Good tech work, bad writing.Bruce the Hermit: The knee leg injury was said to have been from the fall that killed Dent, but we see Batman running away afterwards...so no serious injury. He's had 8 years of 'retirement' to heal up, get reconstructive surgery, whatever. No excuse for him to be in anything but perfect health. As for being a recluse, he should be a fit recluse, otherwise all the lessons he learned in the first two movies are tossed aside. Batman was supposed to be on the run, every night patroling the city looking for bad guys and having to run from the police at the same time, not retire and live in the east wing of Wayne manor pining over Rachel.Ras's daughter: Why wasn't she there when Bruce was trained? Was she already on the board of Wayne Enterprises? She and Bane pop out of thin air into the league of Shadows storyline.Bane: Supposed to get stronger from the drugs, not use them as painkillers for an injury that we never get to see. He is clunky, slow, and strong. Batman's fighting knowledge should have him dancing around the man with hit and run attacks, not going at him fist to fist. Bane's victory was forced. As for his line about having grown up in the dark...he lived in a prison with a giant sunroof!Gotham held hostage for 5 months: no point in this save to give Bruce time to heal and escape. If they planned on nuking the city they'd do it. If they planned on taking over and staging a revolution, they'd do it. Both didn't fit. Ras's manipulation was designed to destroy the city, not play with them. This was not a true league of shadows operation.Alfred leaves: not true to character, nor his revealing the note he'd burnt. His absence seemed to be written in to get Bruce alone and poor. Having a Butler sticking around would be counter productive. Again, the storyline was forced here.Bridge blown to stop bus: All the bridges were blown in the beginning...save one??? Supposedly to get supplies in, you assume, but then you see barricades and fencing put up to keep people from getting out. Again, written in just to have something to blow up at the end for dramatic purposes.Robin discovers Batman: Apparently happens due to a look on Bruce Wayne's face, showing him the same pain at having lost his parents. But wait a second...Bruce Wayne lost his parents, so Bruce Wayne should look like that. Batman didn't lose his parents, as far as everyone knows, so where's the link between Bruce and Batman? Total bomb here. Makes zero sense.Training Robin: a few conversations, a bad of goodies, nothing more.Gordon's speach: Conveniently ends up in Bane's hands. He says 'search him' and the first thing the goons grab out of his pockets is a bunch of paper? They then find a gun...shouldn't they have got his gun when they knocked him out in the first place? Bad writing here, all to get the speach into Bane's hands.Clean Slate: Very convenient technology. Daggot's little speach points that out well.Fighting: Not enough effort put into this. Batman Begins level of choreography was not replicated. Bummer. You can see bad guys waiting around waiting their turn to get hit.Police mob at end: So cliche it doesn't deserve to be in Batman. Walk up at tanks held by criminals? Seriously? Bad writing again.Batman's armory: How did Bane find it? How did he know where to look for it? It was supposed to be a secret, so where was the security breach? Never explained.Batman getting owned: Little things like Catwoman disappearing when his back is turned...Batman doesn't turn his back. He's the badass, and the writing waters down the character to trump up catwoman. This was much more a Bruce Wayne movie than a Batman movie, and they didn't do Bruce Wayne well either. His intelligence disappears at convenient times.Bruce running away with Catwoman: nice ending after thinking he's dead, but totally out of character. Both them hooking up and him quitting being Batman. Gothan is a mess, Gordon needs help, and he leaves an untrained newbie to take care of everything and even a brand new bat signal on the roof? No, totally not right. Bruce Wayne leaving Gotham behind permanently and running off(supposedly broke)just doesn't fit. Batman/Bruce is not supposed to be happy. He is a tragic figure turned hero...not a lover/family man. Him being happy is not the objective, him keeping other people from avoiding the loss that plagues him is. That is Batman.A lot of good things in this movie, but the writing was subpar and contradictory with the previous two films. In the end it's worth watching a few times, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't live up to Batman Begins, at all.",4,"Good, but a bit of a let down.",1356825600,"12 30,

Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman were both equally as great as they have been in the previous two movies. Anne Hathaway portrayed Selina Kyle very memorably; I think she and Christian Bale have good chemistry. NOW, my complaint with The Dark Knight Rises is Marion Cotillard.

1418473,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004LWZWGA,,"[3, 5]","To state that Christopher Nolan's crescendo-building finale to the Dark Knight trilogy is richly plotted is a gross understatement. There is so much going on in the intricately detailed screenplay co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan that it's a wonder that he pulls it off with not only cinematic gusto but with surprising clarity. In fact, the artistic success of this epic 2012 adventure has primarily to do with Nolan's virtuosic filmmaking style which reflects an uncompromising level of commitment that stubbornly doesn't translate into the level of Cameron-level hubris you would expect from such a surefire studio rainmaker. In fact, as he showed most effectively in 2008'sThe Dark Knight, Nolan can take the most ludicrous material and invest it with so much belief and inflate it with unbounded imagination and intelligence, so much so that he can overcome any lingering skepticism (if not endless critical feedback) that belabors the incredulousness of the venture. Unlike 2010'sInception, where he does get carried away with the blinking creativity of its mind-altering concept, the well-grounded myth of Batman tethers him irrevocably to the fastidious demands of an established fan base of not only the 73-year-old comic books but of the movies themselves from the serials in the 1940's to the Tim Burton pictures to ""The Dark Knight"". He also has a firm grasp on the narrative from an emotional standpoint and can still stage a sharp albeit often far-fetched action scene.Although it's only been four years since the release of ""The Dark Knight"", the story has moved forward eight years since the pivotal moment when Batman disappeared after taking the blame for D.A. Harvey Dent's crimes in order to salvage the hope he represented to the populace in the wake of the Joker's rampage.  Those intervening years have been an extended period of quiet for Gotham City, but it's all based on a deception of misplaced heroism. Bruce Wayne's lifelong love Rachel Dawes was killed in a fiery explosion, and he has become a recluse in his manor under the delusion that she was leaving Dent for him. A clever jewel thief named Selina Kyle unexpectedly enters his life stealing his mother's pearls just as Wayne Enterprises begins to crumble due to Wayne's long-standing absence from the board.  He retreats from his decision to invest in board member Miranda Tate's clean energy, fusion power project after he learns that the core could be modified to become a nuclear weapon. At the same time, a brutalizing terrorist named Bane makes his debut in Gotham City attacking the stock exchange and forcing Wayne to liquidate his assets. Although the act appears initiated by the Machiavellian impulses of a rival board member, the ensuing revolution turns out to cut much deeper as a war against the wealthy with the entire city being held hostage and a deeply personal vendetta against Wayne that inevitably goes back to the story in the first film, 2005'sBatman Begins.To give away any more would be sacrilegious. Suffice it to say the circumstances become dire leading to powerful images of devastation and visceral showdowns that don't disappoint. If anything, Nolan eschews much of the expected violence in favor of genuine suspense probably due to the pre-release speculation of rabid bloggers who were trying to guess how Nolan would wrap up all the storylines. Obviously if you have some idea of the original comic book storylines, you'll know where the plot is going. Regardless, Nolan has really figured out how to provide the film a climax that is ultimately satisfying. As both Wayne and Batman, Christian Bale proves that he is the actor who best understands the dichotomy of the mythically contrarian role, and in this film, reveals the vulnerability of a fallen public figure with the appropriate gravitas. Several other veteran actors are back for their third round and reveal more depth to their characters - Michael Caine conveying the burdensome weight of Alfred's melancholy while witnessing Wayne as he tortuously resuscitates his secret identity, Morgan Freeman erudite as ever as Wayne's armorer Lucius Fox, and an especially effective Gary Oldman, who as the world-weary Commissioner Gordon, agonizes over the guilt of his long-held secret about Batman and Dent. Even Cillian Murphy and Liam Neeson show up to reprise their previous roles as Dr. Jonathan Crane and Ra's al Ghul, respectively, in memorable cameos.Nolan also scooped up members of his ""Inception"" ensemble for key roles - a comparatively pallid Marion Cotillard as Wayne's benefactress and burgeoning love interest Tate, Joseph Gordon-Levitt showing more grit than before as police officer John Blake whose idealism remains unabated despite the grim circumstances, and Tom Hardy virtually unrecognizable as the menacing Bane, a deliberate contrast to the chaotic anarchy of Heath Ledger's well-missed Joker. In particular, Hardy sharply conveys the imposing physicality and florid pontification of a relentless terrorist leader, and he and Bale engage in a couple of hand-to-hand combat sequences that viscerally epitomize the good-versus-evil conundrum at the center of the story. The biggest surprise of the cast turns out to be Anne Hathaway who eschews her usually sunny screen persona with infectious abandon as Catwoman (although she is never referred by this moniker in the film). She not only captures her character's slinky amorality and acrobatic moves but also provides clear insight into Selina's nihilistic behavior with welcome economy. It's also her character who acts as a touchstone in announcing to Wayne the coming revolution, which has obvious parallels to the Occupy movement that has monopolized recent headlines. In fact, the one storytelling misstep may be an underlying presumption that an anti-Wall Street screed would automatically establish the moral tone of the film when I think more widespread evidence of such villainy is warranted versus the greed-driven acts of a single company's board.But let's not forget this is all based on a comic book, and on that level, it enthralls with impressive set pieces, state-of-the-art gadgetry (the high-flying ""Bat"" is cool), and thrilling action sequences beginning with an airplane dismantling sequence worthy of James Bond. I applaud Nolan for not being afraid to stage the group fight scenes with the deliberately superficial expedience of the original TV series. He also doesn't harp on any particular political agenda (despite what professional critics and rhetoric-crazed pundits may claim) and never forgets that balance in his cerebrally meticulous approach all the way through its 145-minute running time. Granted there are some moments of forced humor I could have done without. Regardless, this is one of the few occasions when I felt the movie was actually not long enough. As you would expect, the film's production values are superb from Wally Pfister's dark-hued cinematography (he also lensed the first two films) to Hans Zimmer's appropriately stentorian score to the outstanding production design by Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh (Gotham City never looked more realistically like Manhattan) to the multitudes responsible for the special effects (the football game scene is a stunner even from the trailer). Despite my misgivings about the overly expository nature of the first film which comes back somewhat in this one, this is a genuinely spectacular finale to a great trilogy.",5,Nolan Delivers the

1418474,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B004LWZWGA,,"[3, 6]","I saw this film to complete the Nolan trilogy.Nolan has realized a large vision with solid,definable characters,who anchor the wild and less plausible aspects of a comic book transferred to screen. So you look for Gary Oldman's Police Commisioner,Jim Gordan,you look for Michael Caine's Alfred,you look for Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox,you especially look for Christian Bale's definitive Batman.His dark growl is less pronounced and it was a pleasure to hear him speak,better,more vulnerable.Bale is the only actor who has come to own the role.These films(and Inception) court a mass audience,but unlike other blockbuster franchises,he treats his audience with a measure of respect for their intelligence.His Batman attempts to connect with the zeitgeist,here it's the Occupy movement and the resentment against the bankers and the rich.He also picks up plot strands from the earlier films,Batman Begins,The Dark Knight.Christian Bale's limping Bruce Wayne,is scarred from the effort and has drawn down the guilt of Harvey Dent's death.Nolan wiped away the kitsch debacles of Joel Schumacher's Batman films by turning to the character's origins as created in Frank Miller's graphic Batman:Year One & The Dark Knight Returns. The nourish elements mean women are treated as archetypes,the femme fatale,the victim or ing&eacute;nue, often in parts that are underwritten and don't allow development, to be distrusted,longed for or mourned.Hathaway provides the spark of fun and sexuality,the catburglar coopted by Wayne in the battle for Gotham's soul.Cotillard is a mystery philanthropist with a twist.In this film we get a recycling of the Liam Neeson Ra's al Ghu'sl League of Shadows.Tom Hardy's Bane is little more than an anarchist in a sheepskin jacket,inflated to physically menacing,broody and mean proportions,revenge offspring for the death of the villain in Begins.He offers liberation to the people but as in the French Revolution there is the aftermath:terror.His mask occludes his face, Lecter-like,but what he says can be heard.The fight with Batman provides one of the film's centre- pieces,putting Wayne in a hole from which he has to rise out of to rebuild his heroic identity.Bruce's other fight is with his inner demons.There's no central character of the order of Ledger's Joker.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Officer Blakeis the honest cop who you look for,a guide in the chaotic frenzy that breaks out.There are chases with new Bat vehicles(a flier and an attack bike),street battles between armies of cops and mercenaries.The soundtrack pounding score by Hans Zimmer soars,but at times occludes some of the dialogue.Nolan seems like Shakespeare and Dickens(Two Cities) to have a fear of large mobs.Again he's largely free of CGI,preferring pure film stock and action freshness.This is a worthy end to a fantastic trilogy,with an opening for another director.Nolan the guru of escapism.",4,A dark storm is coming,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,2896,"['saw', 'film', 'complete', 'Nolan', 'trilogy.Nolan', 'realized', 'large', 'vision', 'solid', 'definable', 'characters', 'who', 'anchor', 'wild', 'less', 'plausible', 'aspects', 'comic', 'book', 'transferred', 'screen', 'look', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Police', 'Commisioner', 'Jim', 'Gordan', 'look', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'look', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'especially', 'look', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'definitive', 'Batman.His', 'dark', 'growl', 'less', 'pronounced', 'was', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'speak', 'better', 'more', 'vulnerable.Bale', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'come', 'own', 'role.These', 'films', 'Inception', 'court', 'mass', 'audience', 'other', 'blockbuster', 'franchises', 'audience', 'measure', 'respect', 'intelligence.His', 'Batman', 'attempts', 'connect', 'zeitgeist', 'here', 'Occupy', 'movement', 'resentment', 'bankers', 'rich.He', 'also', 'up', 'plot', 'strands', 'earlier', 'films', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight.Christian', 'Bale', 'limping', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'scarred', 'effort', 'drawn', 'down', 'guilt', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'death.Nolan', 'wiped', 'away', 'kitsch', 'debacles', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Batman', 'films', 'turning', 'character', 'origins', 'created', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'graphic', 'Batman', 'Year', 'One', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'nourish', 'elements', 'mean', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'archetypes', 'femme', 'fatale', 'victim', 'ing', 'eacute', 'often', 'parts', 'are', 'underwritten', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'development', 'be', 'distrusted', 'longed', 'mourned.Hathaway', 'spark', 'fun', 'sexuality', 'catburglar', 'coopted', 'Wayne', 'battle', 'Gotham', 'soul.Cotillard', 'mystery', 'philanthropist', 'twist.In', 'film', 'get', 'recycling', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Ra', 'al', ""Ghu'sl"", 'League', 'Shadows.Tom', 'Hardy', 'Bane', 'little', 'more', 'anarchist', 'sheepskin', 'jacket', 'inflated', 'physically', 'menacing', 'broody', 'mean', 'proportions', 'revenge', 'offspring', 'death', 'villain', 'Begins.He', 'offers', 'liberation', 'people', 'French', 'Revolution', 'aftermath', 'terror.His', 'mask', 'face', 'Lecter-like', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'heard.The', 'fight', 'Batman', 'one', 'film', 'centre-', 'pieces', 'putting', 'Wayne', 'hole', 'rise', 'out', 'rebuild', 'heroic', 'identity.Bruce', 'other', 'fight', 'inner', 'central', 'character', 'order', 'Ledger', 'Joker.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Officer', 'Blakeis', 'honest', 'cop', 'who', 'look', 'guide', 'chaotic', 'frenzy', 'breaks', 'are', 'chases', 'new', 'Bat', 'vehicles', 'flier', 'attack', 'bike', 'street', 'battles', 'armies', 'cops', 'mercenaries.The', 'soundtrack', 'pounding', 'score', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'soars', 'times', 'occludes', 'dialogue.Nolan', 'Shakespeare', 'Dickens', 'Two', 'Cities', 'have', 'fear', 'large', 'mobs.Again', 'largely', 'free', 'CGI', 'preferring', 'pure', 'film', 'stock', 'action', 'freshness.This', 'worthy', 'end', 'fantastic', 'trilogy', 'opening', 'director.Nolan', 'guru', 'escapism']",N/A
1418475,AN9J46667D80O,B004LWZWGA,,"[3, 6]","Well, here's what I'm going to say at the outset: this isn't a perfect film. It has a few flaws and a few plot elements that don't make much sense. But while it isn't a perfect film, it is, in fact, a perfect ending to the Chris Nolan Batman film series.The movie also does an excellent job of avoiding the three film problem that many super-hero film series seem to have. I'm thinking of works of ""art"" like X-Men 3, Superman III, Spider-Man 3 and, of course, Batman Forever.The movie shows us a version of Bruce Wayne who has holed up in his mansion, unseen by the public. Life in Gotham has moved on, and Harvey Dent is held up as a paragon of virtue to the people of Gotham (something that greatly troubles Commissioner Gordon). Aside from a cat burglar named Selina Kyle, all appears to be reasonably well.And then Bane arrives.What to say about Bane? His master plan is...well, something I can't reveal here, as it would really spoil things. It makes sense for him, his past and his character, at least as established in the movie. What follows once his plan starts is a series of crushing defeats for Batman, the city of Gotham under siege and a great many twists and turns that I didn't even remotely expect. I also didn't expect that the movie is really more of a sequel to Batman Begins than to The Dark Knight.Tom Hardy gives an excellent performance as the man with the plan. Also excellent are the returning cast of Christian Bale, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman, as well as newcomers to the series Joseph Gordon-Leavitt and Marion Cotillard. Nolan does his usual excellent job as a director, and despite some minor plot holes, I really did enjoy this film. I wish that I had more to say about it, but it's hard to do so without venturing into spoiler territory.

1418476,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B004LWZWGA,,"[3, 7]","I have little to say about this film because it is a good film by its special effects and by the various components it contains, from the strong and barbarous terroristic emotions to the powerful and human passions and to the political meaning it conveys.Starting with the last point the dark knight that rises is a direct allusion to the rising of Jesus after his crucifixion and to his rising some time later to heaven. The next film will be the second coming with some self-appointed successor. That will be hard to renew the genre but I am sure they can find some authors to write the next episode.As for the political discourse the film also presents terrorists as people who have suffered some injustice and who come back for a vengeance. They are manipulated by a slice of the top society who thinks they are going to fill up their pockets and their bags. Of course they end up manipulated by the terrorists and dead because the terrorists only have one thing in mind, their vengeance. That's the extreme right alluding to the Tea Party movement and the Tea Party Patriots with Paul Ryan who is coming from that section of society, the presentable faade of this extreme right violence.On the other hand the extreme left and the Occupy Wall Street movement is not very far and the discourse about a revolution to give power back to the people and to get rid of the rich, the powerful, the exploiters and the profiteers and then to redistribute the recuperated riches is common in our countries where it is easier to be unrealistic than to be sober and clean-minded. Ask Hollande how he was elected and look at what he is doing. Brilliant hypocritical demagogy.Both movements bring armies of volunteers whose objective is looting, killing, destroying and torturing. You can have a lot of volunteers in our society. Marx called them the lumpen-proletariat, those who have nothing to lose except their chains, but not their souls because they have none. You have to add to these the anarchists who consider society has to be destroyed to liberate the collective mind and the small delinquents who find in the opportunity the possibility to steal a computer here or a telephone in some pocket or whatever can have some value or can be a trophy. In both cases these movements start with opening the prison to liberate all the prisoners who are obvious social and political prisoners. Havoc comes in both cases anyway.Then you have the strong and barbarous emotions of the injustice suffered by those who are going to become terrorists. They are sent to prison on a whim or for some vengeance. Children can be born in prisons that are nothing but dying hospices. Then some escape. Then some are tortured to the extreme of their possibility to resist and they die during that barbaric treatment, or should I say processing, like raw meat in a butcher's shop. And you end up with a daughter and a protector and a father and a dead mother and a lot of sad horror.On the side of human and powerful passions there are plenty too with Batman of course, an orphanage and the children there, the blind violence and fake justice imposed to anyone who is not favored by the new masters. The suspense of the bomb and the count down. The constant choice of being killed when resisting, or being given the choice by some revolutionary tribunal to die by hanging or to die by drowning when going out into exile. And some amorous passion comes up too, and the valet Alfred betrays his master.A film to see if you like strong action. If you prefer comedies, author's films, manifesto films or hefty social and cultural stuff, abstain from this one that is none of these. But it is entertaining enough to even make you think.

1418477,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B004LWZWGA,,"[3, 7]","I went to see the midnight showing that had the longest line for a film I've ever seen, and The Dark Knight Rises was beyond well worth the time I waited in line which was nearly three hours. The Dark Knight Rises is an achievement of film that hasn't been done in well in film in years and you will be reminded of great films like back to films like Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Seven Samurai in their story, message, grandeur and scope. It's a rarity to see a film attempt it now days let alone be successful, and The Dark Knight Rises it that kind of film that everyone should see. The film is more than an event film or summer movie. The Dark Knight Rises is simply one of the best movies of all time.I've never been a big fan of DC comics never really getting into or finding a connection with their characters, but Batman was the exception. I loved the dark tone of the comic and the villains along with the more adult story lines it became one of my favorite comics outside of Spiderman, and the X-Men. Since Batman's conception in 1939 Batman has become one of the oldest comic book characters and one of the most popular, and there have been many TV and film adaptations, and most of them I've seen have been surprisingly good. From Adam West's fun but campy late 1960's version to Super Friends, to the best television Batman in Batman: The Animated Series, to Batman and Batman Begins and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. There have been many different takes on Batman, but Christopher Nolan's is the best surpassing my favorite Batman film Mask of the Phantasm. What Nolan has achieved here with the Dark Knight Rises and his trilogy of films is truly something special, but I get to that and the director later.As for The Dark Knight Rises let me get to what I like first, which was everything. I'll address some of the issues some of the critics had later. The story I can't go into too much detail, because it will give away some plot points and there are a few brilliant twists in the movie including the amazing and satisfying ending. The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The crime in Gotham has gone way done, because of the Dent Act, which gave more power to the police. Bruce Wayne has disappeared from the public eye hiding in his mansion as a recluse living in his self-pity. He's brought out of his hiding by Selina Kyle and a mysterious Bane who brings death and destruction everywhere he goes. There really isn't much mention to The Dark Knight in the plot of the film or the Joker, and you won't notice that. The Dark Knight Rises does have many connections to Batman begins as Batman's story comes full circle. I'll stop here before I give anything away. I will say that the plot written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan is well written in story, pace and tone.Michael Caine is truly a superb actor and he truly wait he had better get a supporting Oscar for this film and he should win it. He is superb as Alfred and has been in the previous two films. Bring such emotion and humor as Bruce's butler, father figure and friend. He wants the best for Bruce just like any parent wants the best for their children. Another old timer who steals many of the scenes of the film is the great Gary Oldman as James Gordon. I again think he should at very least be nominated for supporting actor. Christian Bale again does great job as Bruce Wayne and a good job as Batman. Unlike the other actors who've taken on the role I think he's done the best job getting into the mind of Bruce Wayne and totally embodying the character. There are many new comers to the film. I like I think many people were a little worried about Bain played by Tom Hardy. Tom did a great job. I know people want to compare Bane to the Joker and Heath Ledger, so I will. Tom Hardy made a more vicious bad guy, but is less charismatic, which Ledger embodied in the Joker. They are two different types of villains. I wasn't as upset like most after seeing the Catwoman suit months ago. I was more upset that Anne Hathaway was cast for the part. I thought she was an overrated actress, plus I was honestly hoping for a hotter actress. My doubts were alleviated as the film drew closer and I saw that she could fill out a cat suit. Out of all the new comers to this film series I think she might have done the best job. She brought sexiness and emotion to the character and to be honest I thought she's a better Catwoman then Michelle Pheiffer. Next is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake. It honestly took a while to get used to the character who is important to the plot, but Joseph does a really good job. Finally we have Miranda Tate played by Marion Cotillard who I thought was the weakest addition to the film even though she plays an important role. Still she isn't perfect but Marion does a good job with the character and time on screen. The only real problems I had with the cast were the supporting cast. Matthew Modine was I thought miscast in the role of Deputy Commissioner Foley. He just never seemed to get into the role or do it justice. Nestor Carbonell the mayor of Gotham who I loved from his days on LOST is barely in the film. I wish they had given him a little more screen time.I know people may think that at nearly three hours long that it will be boring, but Nolan doesn't let the pace slow down for too long before it quickly picks up again. The special effects and action is spectacular. I like that Nolan tries to avoid using effects unless he has to instead using live actors and vehicles instead of digital renderings. It adds for realism to the action especially the climax in the streets of Gotham. The score done by Hans Zimmer was the best of his job on the series.To be honest I had never heard of Christopher Nolan until Batman Begins. I had heard of, but had never seen Memento or Insomnia and I question how he got the job for director of Batman Begins. He proved me wrong with the film, and I'll never doubt him again until he forces me to. After Batman Begins I've seen every film of his, and he hasn't made a bad film yet. Insomnia was the worst and it is still a pretty good film. Nolan does a masterful job of bringing his visions to life creating captivating stories and memorable characters. Through his eight feature length films Nolan truly has become a master film maker. The best in the last decade and if he continues the excellent work will go down as truly one of the greatest. What he achieved with The Dark Knight Rises and his Batman trilogy is truly something special. He's created the best comic book film trilogy and the best trilogy every. Yes even better than the Lord of the Rings. I know people would like Nolan to come back, but I don't think he should. Nolan had a vision he admitted to thinking of years ago and brought it to an end with The Dark Knight Rises. Sure he could go on, but like George from Seinfeld said always leave on a high note, and there is no higher note for Nolan then The Dark Knight Rises. Sure he continues making Batman films, but I honestly don't think he could surpass what he's done with The Dark Knight and this film. It's best to leave people wanting more, and I'm sure everyone will. Let Nolan go he's created and done something special with these films. It's time for him to create his own vision, which I'm sure he will in a few years.Now as I said earlier I was going to address some of the criticism critics have of the film. First some people are saying the films to dark that it's not comic booky enough. First Batman has always been dark. If you don't think so you haven't read the comics or seen the cartoons. The only Batman adaptation was Adam West versions. Even the bad Batman and Robin was a dark film. It was only funny because of how bad the film was, and now as to the general dark tone of the film. Hello almost all of the best films of all time are dark films. The Seven Samurai, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, A Clockwork Orange, Das Boot, All Quiet on the Western Front and Jaws. I could go on, but I won't. All of these films had a dark theme to their films, and these are truly great films. Dark themed films make some of the best films, because the feature adult stories with flawed and damaged characters trying to survive in a chaotic world as the seek peace and redemption. They don't always win or survive nor do they always get their redemption. That's what makes them great characters, which makes great films. The next criticism I read that the story was incoherent or hard to follow. I had no problem following what was going on. Maybe the people complaining should go see the film again and this time pay attention. Sure there is a lot going on, but the story isn't hard to follow.Why do people keep wanting to compare The Dark Knight Rises to The Avengers? Is it a better film? Will it make more money? Fine I will answer those questions for you. Is the Dark Knight Rises a better film? Without question The Dark Knight Rises is a better film. The Avengers is a true summer film. With lots of glitz and glamor, and explosions, but if isn't rememberable outside of it being cool to see all the hero's in one film. If you dig deeper into the film there isn't much there. The Avengers could have with Hawkeye becoming free of Loki. I know these are tuff men, but they could have delved deeper. The same could be said for Coulson's death. I thought it was good, but they could have done more. As for the money I don't think The Dark Knight Rises will make more money. The Avengers had a few advantages. First is 3D. Then there is the running time, which I think is about twenty minutes shorter than The Dark Knight Rises, which means it can be shown more often. Then there is the tone and themes of The Avengers, which is more lighthearted. That attracted the tween kids and the parents who will likely allow the children to see the film. The Dark Knight Rises has darker tones and themes along with more violence. That will keep away parents with kids who might be wanting to see the film, which in all honesty I think, is a good thing it's too dark and violent for the tween crowd, or at least that is in my opinion. Finally there are the Olympics, which start next week. That will hurt The Dark Knight a little. All of that combined will keep The Dark Knight Rises from beating The Avengers. I think it might have a chance if the word of mouth gets out about how great the film is and people keep going weeks and months from now, along with people going to see the film multiple times. Though no matter what The Dark Knight Rises is going to make a ton of money.The Dark Knight Rises is Nolan's Batman trilogy, and his best film in the series along with being one of the best films of all time with a special story, great acting, and amazing action and special effects. Everyone needs to go see the best filmmaker at the moment in his culmination of his work with Batman. It will leave you amazed and satisfied. The ending to the series the film, which I won't give away, is truly something special. Go see The Dark Knight Rises. I will be seeing it multiple times.",5,A Materpiece By The Master Director Christoper Nolan.,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,11142,"['went', 'see', 'midnight', 'showing', 'had', 'longest', 'line',

1418478,A157X0K195JJOZ,B004LWZWGA,,"[3, 8]","I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of the three in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 89-97 series.Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good ""Catwoman"" (I say ""surprisingly"" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when the story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although The Dark Knight Rises is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great, which explains the 4 stars rather than five.But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest.

Except for those on every page of the script, of course...Anne Hathaway shoots to the top of my Sheldon-o-meter as the best of Batman's cat-burglars. Christian Bales' performance seems phoned in from The Machinist, for an actor of his calibre and considering the journey Nolan's Batman has taken, he's given very little actual acting to do. Bain is successfully intimidating but the mask does reduce him somewhat to comic book villain whereas Ledgers Joker, despite the face paint, was scarily real.And finally, where the first two films were true in a great many ways to the revamped vision of Batman as a real hero in a real world torn between justice and revenge, love and duty, in DKRises we're given a CGI'd fairy tale full of crammed in flashbacks, wide scope storytelling, and over reaching set pieces that dissolve any sense of atmosphere, threat and danger and continuity with the previous two movies.So Batman Begins was great, The Dark Knight was a classic, DKRises is...

I've seen some not so good reviews written about the third Dark knight film and well...I don't see it, much less agree with the over analyzation of the story and characters. Folks, you have to remember. This is a film series based on a comic book universe and characters within that universe. Picking it apart and over analyzing the script, story and characters is well...really kind of pointless in my opinion. It's made for entertainment and well...the third film not only delivers that promise, but it also adds closure to ""Bruce Wayne"", and the first two stories as well.Without giving much away about the film for those of you who haven't seen it, Bruce Wayne has turned himself into a recluse. Battered and crippled, he hung up his cape and went into hiding for eight years. On the horizon a new evil and threat to Gotham emerge. Bane, a hulk of a man with not only the physical strength, ferocity, cruelty and willingness to use it, he also bears an incredible mind and intelligence that others before him lacked. While The Joker just wanted to screw with Wayne's mind attempting to bring about anarchy and chaos to Gotham, Bane's intentions on the other hand are far more sinister. To not only finish what his predecessor Raz Algoul and the League of Shadows plan in the beginning, but to burn Gotham to the ground, turn its people on each other and immerse society into chaos. More importantly, to not only destroy the city, but to destroy Wayne's soul, but to break him. Wayne answers to this threat, but is it too much for him to handle or too late?Seeing is believing my friends and I urge you to not take the negative reviews to heart or word for word. They are opinions spouted out by a few who are hard to please. This isn't Saving Private Ryan, Shindler's List or ""The King's Voice, it's a film based on a comic book and comic book characters. The Dark Knight Rises is well worth the wait in line, the evening ticket price and you will be greatly disappointed if you miss seeing it in the theater. More so, you will be utterly amazed of Tom Hardy's physical transformation. Bale has been known to go through incredible physical extremes for film roles and Tom Hardy has proven himself equally time and time again. He is utterly unrecognizable and is something to see.

What do you do? Come out of hiding or run?Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) has abandoned the cape and mask so that Batman could never be arrested and prosecuted for the crimes committed by Harvey Dent that he took the fall for. He's been living like a recluse for eight years while Commissioner James Gordon (played by Gary Oldman) has all but extinguished violent crime in Gotham. Gordon wants to reveal the truth during a celebration honoring Harvey Dent but decides the city isn't ready for it. At that same celebration, a congressman is abducted and, while investigating the crime, Gordon is shot. The patrolman who rescues him, John Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is promoted to detective and told he's to report directly the Commissioner. Blake (Gordon-Levitt) knows Batman's true identity and pleads with Wayne to once again don the cape and mask. Commissioner Gordon echoes those sentiments when Wayne, incognito, visits him in the hospital. The kidnapper, a terrorist and mercenary intent on destroying the city, is Bane. Bane (played by Tom Hardy) was once a member of the League of Shadows before being expelled by his and Bruce Wayne's mentor, Ra's al Ghul. Bane was hired by a competitor of Wayne Enterprises, John Daggett (played by Ben Mendelsohn). We're also introduced to a master thief working with Bane, Selina Kyle (played by Anne Hathaway) who is, of course, Catwoman, though she's never addressed by that name.I was a latecomer to Nolan's new take on the Batman story. I saw The Dark Knight in theaters, but I didn't catch Batman Begins, the first film in the series, until it began airing on cable. Once I did, I bought the DVD. I bought The Dark Knight on DVD the day of its release. Bale as Batman was amazing in the first two films and he is just as good, if not better, in the third. Hardy as Bane is nowhere near as mesmerizing as Heath Ledger's interpretation of The Joker, but he is far more intimidating. Hathaway as Catwoman is the best version of this character that I have seen to date. Of course, the other versions, portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry, were beautiful but one-dimensional. I was hoping this film would be better than its predecessor. Perhaps it's the notion that this means the story is over, but I thought The Dark Knight was the best in the series.

Then the movie theater massacre happened in Colorado and my second viewing got post-poned... indefinitely.After a Black Friday shopping spree led to the purchase of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" DVD for $13, my chance arrived yet again. And yet again, I've been let down. ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" like ""Spider-Man 3,"" is a trilogy clunker that coasts on the belief that bigger is better.The problems are still there, two viewings in: Christopher Nolan expands the cast to include characters that are too quickly introduced and too focused on for us to care. Peter Foley (played by weakest link, Matthew Modine), Miranda Tate (the ""written strictly for the third act character"" played by Marion Cotillard), and John Blake (a Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose assumption that Bruce Wayne is Batman is so ludicrous it lingers for the remaining two hours and causes us to wonder if he knows that Batman is actually Christian Bale) are generally unwelcomed additions to a story that's thinner than what its weaver hopes we think it isn't. This is ""Batman Begins"" all over again, only it attempts a loftier reach for epicness that inadvertently causes it to be the most cartoonish in Nolan's desperate-to-be- realistic franchise.The only new character given justice is Selina Kyle, who, as played by Anne Hathaway, is too underused for how good she is.Even at 165 minutes, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels like a rushed effort. Scenes transition into others like a contestant at a hot dog eating contest waits to digest his next wiener. The pacing is fast, but the result is not edge-of-your-seat inducing. It's messy. And rarely anything more.On top of the bloated pretentiousness, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" sound-editing is atrocious. Between Howard Shore's score and Bane's Sean Connery impersonation, the mute dialogue featured in ""The Artist"" resounds as more audible. Not only does ""Rises"" adopt the motif that bigger is better, but also louder, and it's all to its disadvantage.As the conclusion to a trilogy, ""Rises"" should have been more intimate than special-effects ridden. Scenes showing ""The Bat"" dodging missiles lack suspense, compared to the ones wherein Bruce Wayne encounters Selina Kyle at a charity ball. And while the level of talent involved cannot be denied, their use can. I thought ""The Dark Knight"" was a comic book masterpiece and I think a lot of others are confusing its affiliation with this picture to mean the same. Not so. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is smoke and mirrors.

1418483,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B004LWZWGA,,"[4, 9]","The third and (supposedly) final of Christopher Nolan's Batman films ends on a rising note.  This film is quite long at two hours and forty-four minutes, but is hardly lethargic; it takes that length of time to address the many plot threads left dangling from ""The Dark Knight,"" as well as introduce a number of new characters.These new characters are culled from the comic book's past; for the uninitiated, they work quite well on their own, whereas Batman devotees will feverishly compare them to their preconceptions of the way they remember them.  This film avoids most of the pitfalls found in other third acts; while addressing previous installments, this film is not a mere repetition of them.  It develops and expands on established themes, and reaches a strong conclusion.Set eight years after ""The Dark Knight,"" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" finds Bruce Wayne a hobbled recluse, shut off from the world due to regrets about his past.  The appearance of the cunning thug Bane, as well as the cynical thief Selina Kyle forces Wayne out of retirement and into a final reckoning with events established in the past two films.Like Selina Kyle, director Christopher Nolan steals from the best - in this case, the Charles Dickens classic ""A Tale of Two Cities.""  ""Rises"" even copies the convoluted moral about class struggle in Dickens book: the working class is oppressed, and does have legitimate grievances, but for Pete's sake don't let them take over.  Pretty clever; both the ninety-nine percent and the one will feel vindicated.  The ending borrows from Dickens' novel, and if there's any doubt, the ending of the book is read aloud.One humorous problem with the film is Bane's muffled voice.  Speaking behind a tangled breath mask, wheezing like Darth Vader's love-child, Bane is often incomprehensible.  Arguments between Bane and the Dark Knight will have everyone turning up their hearing aid's.  Perhaps it is Nolan's act of defiance against viewers who complained about Batman's gruffly-garbled verbiage.And what's a trilogy without completion of a thematic circle?  Wayne/Batman must escape a pit which is strongly reminiscent of the well he fell into as a child in ""Batman Begins.""  Schmaltzy perhaps, but it works.

His selflessness knows no bounds.Unfortunately his selflessness grates on his long-time friend and butler, Alfred.  The dynamic between the two was quite emotional and powerful.Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon really takes a beating in this film.  The guy is barely out of the hospital and is running not only the remnants of the police force, but pushing for a ""hot head"" cop to head his detective division.  This young guy plays a few twists and harrowing experiences especially towards the end, which foreshadows (for me at least) a possible fourth film?  Sure, Gordon jumping onto trucks and tracing a nuclear bomb may be unreal, but it was a lot of fun!Best characterization goes to Anne Hathaway as the Catwoman.  Unlike other versions of this character, Selina Kyle is a cat burglar with no superhuman powers other than her extreme athleticism, sly wit and martial arts moves as she dances with the devil and flirts with the Bat.Bane was an OK character.  Clearly Nolan paints this guy to be the ultimate in terrorists.  Shooting up the stock exchange, blowing up a few bridges and terrorizing the populace was a bit overwhelming.  The fight scenes with the Bat and Bane were great, but I did not expect the Bat to lose so quickly!Themes:Some of the themes of the film were old, but they were warmly familiar.  The father figure of Gordon, his personality and strength coming from several places: wanting to protect reputations, taking a hot-headed cop under his wing, and finally some flashbacks to Batman Begins where he comforts a boy who just lost both his parents in a mugging.  The Gordon character was over the top by the way.  Let's get past that!Loyalty to a vow, betrayal and trust run throughout the film.  Ms. Tate plays a strong role in this as well as the continuing vow from the League of Shadows (introduced in Batman Begins), all play well and to the hilt!Bottom Line:  Catwoman takes the film to a whole new level; more humor and struggle than the other characters.  Bruce Wayne's ""Howard Hughes"" move was hard to take, breaking his vow and helping Gotham one more time.  The betrayals from the Board of Wayne Corp and from friends who are enemies and enemies who are friends, may be hard to follow in the first viewing.  Just enough explosions and firefights to satisfy the fanboy as well as the casual viewer of these Batman films.RecommendedOf course see the other films too:Batman BeginsThe Dark KnightThe Dark Knight Trilogy: The Complete Screenplays with Storyboards",5,"Epic Crime Drama, Masterful Nolan Piece",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2838,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'RisesGreat', 'film', 'action', 'packed', 'drama', 'conclusion', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'get', 'fully', 'developed', 'view', 'Wayne', 'state', 'company', 'empire', 'more', 'importantly', 'own', 'personal', 'struggle', 'reputation', 'Wayne', 'ego', 'Batman', 'persona', 'help', 'Gotham', 'City', 'selflessness', 'bounds.Unfortunately', 'selflessness', 'grates', 'long-time', 'friend', 'butler', 'Alfred', 'dynamic', 'two', 'was', 'quite', 'emotional', 'powerful.Gary', 'Oldman', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'really', 'beating', 'film', 'guy', 'barely', 'hospital', 'running', 'not', 'only', 'remnants', 'police', 'force', 'pushing', 'hot', 'head', 'cop', 'head', 'detective', 'division', 'young', 'guy', 'few', 'twists', 'harrowing', 'experiences', 'especially', 'end', 'least', 'possible', 'fourth', 'film', 'Sure', 'Gordon', 'jumping', 'trucks', 'tracing', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'may', 'be', 'unreal', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'Best', 'characterization', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Catwoman', 'other', 'versions', 'character', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'cat', 'burglar', 'superhuman', 'other', 'extreme', 'athleticism', 'sly', 'wit', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'devil', 'flirts', 'Bat.Bane', 'was', 'OK', 'character', 'Clearly', 'Nolan', 'paints', 'guy', 'be', 'ultimate', 'terrorists', 'Shooting', 'up', 'stock', 'exchange', 'blowing', 'up', 'few', 'bridges', 'terrorizing', 'populace', 'was', 'bit', 'overwhelming', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Bat', 'Bane', 'were', 'great', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'Bat', 'lose', 'so', 'quickly', 'Themes', 'themes', 'film', 'were', 'old', 'were', 'warmly', 'familiar', 'father', 'figure', 'Gordon', 'personality', 'strength', 'coming', 'several', 'places', 'wanting', 'protect', 'reputations', 'taking', 'hot-headed', 'cop', 'wing', 'finally', 'flashbacks', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'where', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'parents', 'mugging', 'Gordon', 'character', 'was', 'top', 'way', 'Let', 'get', 'Loyalty', 'vow', 'betrayal', 'trust', 'run', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Tate', 'strong', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'continuing', 'vow', 'League', 'Shadows', 'introduced', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'play', 'well', 'hilt', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Catwoman', 'film', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'more', 'humor', 'struggle', 'other', 'characters', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'move', 'was', 'hard', 'take', 'breaking', 'vow', 'helping', 'Gotham', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'betrayals', 'Board', 'Wayne', 'Corp', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'enemies', 'enemies', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'follow', 'first', 'viewing', 'Just', 'enough', 'explosions', 'firefights', 'satisfy', 'fanboy', 'as', 'well', 'casual', 'viewer', 'Batman', 'films.RecommendedOf', 'course', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'too', 'Batman', 'BeginsThe', 'Dark', 'KnightThe', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Trilogy', 'Complete', 'Screenplays', 'Storyboards']",N/A

Now that I've had the opportunity to watch the DVD with sub-titles, I've upped my rating considerably.  I missed so many subtleties of the film in the theater.  Major themes and plot developments were incomprehensible to me due to several characters' slurred speech and the rapid editing of some parts of the film.  Now, I see The Dark Knight Rises is a complex work that requires multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.  I still find the depictions of physical pain endured by several characters excessive, and it's not the perfect work that The Dark Knight is.

1418486,AX53DA3FTILL0,B004LWZWGA,,"[5, 22]","Alright, this is by no means a 'bad' movie, but when following up a classic like 'The Dark Knight' it will make a sequel look worse if it does not come close to matching up with its predecessor.  And the 'Dark Knight Rises' does not come close.  This movie had a plethora of problems.  For one, a jabbering story line about identity theft which disappears mid-way through the film.  It merely served as a plot device so it would justify the catwoman being in the film.  Also, the complete lack of build-up to Batman's first confrontation with Bane.  It reminded me of George Clooney's Batman fighting Mr. Freeze with no build up whatsoever.  In the movie, Bane does not rely on the venom to give him super strength, which means he beats Batman without the aid of anything.  This means that some guy who grew up in a prison can defeat a man who has mastered every form of martial arts? eh,no. They should have done their homework on that one.Another unforgivable flaw is the fact that Joseph-Gordon Levitt has more screen time than Batman. What? (Meaning more screen time than Christian Bale in the Batman costume).  The run time is a bloated 2hr and 45 mintues, filled with too many philosophical conversations.  Basically, this movie takes the plot from the Arkham City video game (Gotham becoming an isolated island with roving criminals) and the Dark Knight Returns (where batman has taken an eight-year hiatus from crimefighting).  So much for original ideas.  By doing this, Chris Nolan cuts off the cliffhanger from the last movie at the legs.  Weren't the cops supposed to be chasing batman around as a fugitive?  They just fast-forwarded that and that is how the storyline is resolved.....awful.  The puzzling romance between Bruce Wayne and Talia, one moment their talking business, the next their doing business in bed.  Again, no build-up, it just sort of happened. Awful.  The action sequences are few and far between. To make matters worse their not exciting, they come across as flat and bland.  Listen to the music during the movie, it's just the main theme over and over again.  The variety for the themes from the last movie is gone.I think the momentum from the last movie has carried over to this one, making people believe its better than it really is.  On the plus side, Christian Bale does a more palpable Batman voice, gone is the growl.  Tom Hardy steals the show as Bane. And the first fight between Batman/Bane was easily the best scene in the movie (despite no build-up).  As a stand alone movie, this is a decent action film.  When compared to the 'Dark Knight'.....not even close.

1418487,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B004LWZWGA,,"[5, 8]","Back in 2005, when I first heard of this new reinvention of Batman courtesy of Christopher Nolan, I didn't know what to think. I had not known of Nolan's previous work, and just didn't know if this new take on the superhero legend would do it for me. Now, 7 years and 3 movies later, I can safely say that, oh yeah, it worked! And now, here we are at the end of Nolan's trilogy, which will no doubt go down as one of the greatest film trilogies of all time.I won't go into too great of detail, as it's stuff to discover as you watch, but these are the basics. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" takes place eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight'. Batman no longer exists as we learned he took the fall for the murder of Harvey Dent at the end of the last movie. Commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) is the only one to know the truth. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse and getting a Howard Hughes reputation among the citizens of Gotham City. But when a new evil strikes the city in the form of the hulking, mask wearing Bane (Tom Hardy, who sounds like an evil Sean Connery), and the sneaky cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) also appears on the scene, Bruce is pushed back into action and Batman returns to save his beloved city from utter destruction.Obviously, there is a lot more to it and a lot more to say, but part of the fun is watching this movie unfold with your own two eyes. Actually, it's hard to put into words what I think of this movie. It's really one of those ""just go see it for yourself right now!"" kind of movies. Timely and relevant, TDKR is a superhero movie that will be talked about decades from now. I don't know if I loved it more than TDK, but I loved it just as much. No one will ever be able to touch Heath Ledger's Joker, but the epicness of this movie is just unmatched. Director Christopher Nolan is a man with fierce talent. He films a Batman movie like no other. The movie is just large and epic in scope. Thankfully, Nolan also uses real, practical in camera effects and stunts when so many others would do everything in CGI. CGI probably is in use here, but it's completely seamless, and Nolan's use of doing practical effects is something more should get back to doing.Then there is the cast. This is the movie's strongest point. All of the returning regulars give the best performances of the entire trilogy, and that's saying something. We've known this Bruce Wayne for a few years and movies now, and you feel for him. You feel his pain, his sadness, etc. It's testament to Bale's acting and interpretation of the character. Michael Caine as Alfred has never been better. In fact, there will be a moment or two where he might have you in tears. Anne Hathaway holds her ground as well. She's confident in the role and has a way with delivering a humorous line. Her costume may not be as memorable as Michelle Pfeiffer, but she just may give Pfeiffer competition as the sexiest Catwoman ever. Tom Hardy as Bane is a hulking presence. I am not overly familiar with the character, but he is absolutely chilling. Hearing his Sean Connery meets Darth Vader voice come out of nowhere actually sends chills down your spine.Honestly, there is so much to say about TDKR, and so much more praise I can lay on it. But as I mentioned before, it's a movie that is best left to experience and see for oneself. Throwing in a few words here isn't really going to do it justice. The movie is just an amazing piece of work in what has been a phenomenal string of movies. Everything and everyone is top notch and in the finest form possible. TDKR is thrilling, chilling, emotional, epic and you just aren't quite sure how it's going to end. It's one of the best superhero movies ever.",5,There Are Just No Words....,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,3727,"['Back', '2005', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'new', 'reinvention', 'Batman', 'courtesy', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'Nolan', 'previous', 'work', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'new', 'take', 'superhero', 'legend', 'would', 'do', 'Now', '7', 'years', '3', 'movies', 'later', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'oh', 'yeah', 'worked', 'now', 'here', 'are', 'end', 'Nolan', 'trilogy', 'will', 'doubt', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'greatest', 'film', 'trilogies', 'time.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'great', 'detail', 'stuff', 'discover', 'watch', 'are', 'basics', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'place', 'eight', 'years', 'events', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Batman', 'no', 'longer', 'learned', 'took', 'fall', 'murder', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'end', 'last', 'movie', 'Commissioner', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'only', 'one', 'know', 'truth', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'become', 'recluse', 'getting', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'reputation', 'citizens', 'Gotham', 'City', 'when', 'new', 'evil', 'city', 'form', 'hulking', 'mask', 'wearing', 'Bane', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'who', 'evil', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'sneaky', 'cat', 'burglar', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'also', 'scene', 'Bruce', 'pushed', 'back', 'action', 'Batman', 'save', 'beloved', 'city', 'utter', 'destruction.Obviously', 'lot', 'more', 'lot', 'more', 'say', 'part', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'unfold', 'own', 'two', 'eyes', 'Actually', 'hard', 'put', 'words', 'what', 'think', 'movie', 'really', 'one', 'just', 'go', 'see', 'right', 'now', 'kind', 'movies', 'Timely', 'relevant', 'TDKR', 'superhero', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'talked', 'decades', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'loved', 'more', 'TDK', 'loved', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'touch', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'epicness', 'movie', 'just', 'unmatched', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'man', 'fierce', 'talent', 'films', 'Batman', 'movie', 'other', 'movie', 'just', 'large', 'epic', 'scope', 'Thankfully', 'Nolan', 'also', 'real', 'practical', 'camera', 'effects', 'stunts', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'would', 'do', 'everything', 'CGI', 'CGI', 'probably', 'use', 'here', 'completely', 'seamless', 'Nolan', 'use', 'doing', 'practical', 'effects', 'something', 'more', 'should', 'get', 'back', 'doing.Then', 'cast', 'movie', 'strongest', 'point', 'returning', 'regulars', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'entire', 'trilogy', 'saying', 'something', ""'ve"", 'known', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'few', 'years', 'movies', 'now', 'feel', 'feel', 'pain', 'sadness', 'etc', 'testament', 'Bale', 'acting', 'interpretation', 'character', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'fact', 'will', 'be', 'moment', 'two', 'where', 'might', 'have', 'tears', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'ground', 'well', 'confident', 'role', 'way', 'delivering', 'humorous', 'line', 'costume', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'memorable', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'just', 'may', 'give', 'Pfeiffer', 'competition', 'sexiest', 'Catwoman', 'ever', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Bane', 'hulking', 'presence', 'am', 'not', 'overly', 'familiar', 'character', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'Hearing', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'meets', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'voice', 'come', 'nowhere', 'actually', 'chills', 'down', 'spine.Honestly', 'so', 'much', 'say', 'TDKR', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'praise', 'can', 'lay', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'best', 'left', 'experience', 'see', 'Throwing', 'few', 'words', 'here', ""n't"", 'really', 'going', 'do', 'justice', 'movie', 'just', 'amazing', 'piece', 'work', 'what', 'been', 'phenomenal', 'string', 'movies', 'Everything', 'everyone', 'top', 'notch', 'finest', 'form', 'possible', 'TDKR', 'thrilling', 'chilling', 'emotional', 'epic', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'one', 'best', 'superhero', 'movies', 'ever']",N/A
1418488,A3BOH0F7V12H7O,B004LWZWGA,,"[5, 8]","The Dark Knight returns one more time in the finale to director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises, and like the first two films in the set, the movie does not disappoint. It transcends the comic book adaptation, as more than an action thriller. It's a cerebral film, taking on big themes and psychological issues, and it succeeds in every way.It's been eight years since the events of the previous film, since Batman (Christian Bale) took the blame for the actions of the fallen District Attorney Harvey Dent (not to mention his death). Bruce Wayne has given up the mantle of the Bat and withdrawn into himself, worn down physically and emotionally. He spends much of his time holed up in his manor, while the city he once protected has rejected him. His company has seen better days, and is now steeply on a decline. All he has left for company is his butler and father figure Alfred (Michael Caine), who worries about how deeply Bruce has been battered by the events of the last few years.Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) knows the truth of his innocence, but is obliged to maintain the facade of Batman as an outlaw, and he has his own issues to deal with, from political concerns and senior officers jockeying for his post to an arrogant belief in the city that major crime is a problem of the past.Into the mix come two wild cards. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) is a cat burglar with an agenda all her own. And Bane (Tom Hardy) is a ruthless anarchist who unleashes hell on the city, in a series of attacks meant to draw out and destroy the Dark Knight, which is only the beginning of what he has in mind.The finale of the series is a harrowing journey into darkness. The film, scripted by Nolan, his brother Jonathan Nolan, and David S. Goyer, takes on themes that are very prevalent today: the conflict between rampant capitalism and rights of the people, the fear of terrorism, the role of justice in the world. It follows a hero who's just a man, at his lowest point, and asks the question of what can bring him back. There are influences from some of the biggest Batman stories of the comics: The Dark Knight Returns, Knightfall, and No Man's Land are obvious ones. There are also shades of the storming of the Bastille and the French Revolution underlying the story.The production values of the film are, as before, well worth it. The cinematography is spectacular; there are camera shots throughout the film that will leave you breathless. The special effects serve the story, and not the other way around; explosions for instance, in this film, are done properly, unlike the wildly over-exaggerated garbage we'd see out of a hack like Michael Bay (yes, Michael Bay, you are a hack of the first order. You are a hack in a hack class all of your own). And the score by Hans Zimmer (this time on his own, without his collaborator for the first two films, James Newton Howard) brings back some of the previous themes but goes off in other strong directions. Nolan has chosen his crew well, once again.The cast itself is splendid in their roles. Marion Cotillard is a newcomer as Miranda Tate, a tycoon with an energy device that may be the salvation of Wayne Enterprises. Cotillard is a gifted French actress who you might recall from Inception, another Nolan film. She plays the role with sublety and nuance, and fits very well into the tapestry of the film. Another Inception veteran is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, playing John Blake, an inherently decent Gotham Police officer. There is a curious quality to his nature, and a basic integrity to him. He becomes the audience point of view character, the everyman we can relate to, who steps up to do right just because it's the right thing.The returning veteran players inhabit their roles once more perfectly. Gary Oldman as Gordon is as good as ever; Oldman is one of the great character actors of our time, and as Batman's one time ally, we see a man who's deeply unhappy at having to publicly be against the Batman early on, and then finds himself confronting the worst possible crisis of his life. Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, the Wayne executive and father figure to Bruce who's provided much of the Bat tech in the past. There continues to be a wise strength in his portrayal of the character. And Michael Caine is very much the heart of the film, a foster father to Bruce Wayne, the guiding conscience, the Horatio to Bruce's Hamlet.Tom Hardy is another Inception veteran, and in that film, he completely stole the movie from the star, Leonardo DiCaprio (admittedly not that hard to do). He plays the monstrous Bane just as I'd expect him to be: a clever and brutal man, hidden behind a strange mask, a ferocious force of nature, and utterly nihilistic. Bane first appeared in the comics in the aforementioned Knightfall story, and has appeared in film, in the cinematic abomination that was Batman & Robin, where the character was a brainless idiot who happened to be nothing more than muscle for the two primary villains. For that and many other Bat-reasons, Joel Schumacher has more than earned his place in the seventh circle of Hell. This Bane is a decisive, bold leader, intelligent and sadistic, willing to do anything to achieve his objectives.Anne Hathaway plays Catwoman, though she's never once called that through the film. It's probably impossible to outdo Michelle Pfeiffer's take on the character, so Hathaway doesn't even try, instead playing the character closer to the comic book version, a woman who's straddling the line between hero and villain. She brings a strong energy to the role, and her character draws Bruce out of the darkness he has descended into. She's got the look of the character just right, and gives the character just the right dramatic touches in terms of personality.Christian Bale gives arguably his best performance of the trilogy in this film. His Batman has become brooding and withdrawn, consumed by losses in his life and the rejection of the people he once vowed to protect. The character is at the lowest ebb, and has to find his way out of despair and back to himself; he has to reinvest himself in his mission, to once again be the hero to a city that doesn't deserve him. Bale has an intensity and a drive as an actor that makes him fascinating to watch, and he inhabits the dual role of Bruce Wayne the tycoon and Batman the driven vigilante perfectly. In each of these films he's understood the basic truth: the real man is the one driven by his own tragedy to wage war on crime, to seek justice, and the facade or mask is the carefree socialite.Nolan has given us three outstanding, spectacular adaptations in this trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises is exhilarating, demanding, and rewarding, and not only is it a great comic adaptation and thrilling action film, it's also one of the best films of the year. It makes us care about the characters, surprises us in unexpected ways, and makes us ask ourselves questions. It makes us think, because it's a film with depth.Something that can never be suggested of Joel Schumacher, who, rumour has it, still wants to make his (self described) masterpiece Batman & Robin &

1418489,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B004LWZWGA,,"[5, 9]","""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a most fitting conclusion to ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy of Batman films directed by Christopher F. Nolan. (When you see this film, you will understand why Christopher F. Nolan has said he has no interest in directing another ""Batman"" movie.) It is the most emotionally satisfying of the three films, drawing upon both of its predecessors to provide a rich back-story for the cataclysmic events that unfold within. Nolan and his brother Jonathan have written such an intricate script rich in both emotion and action that will leave viewers in suspense until the very end; not a minute is wasted in a film more than two and a half hours long, but one that will seem much shorter in length due to its ample psychological and physical action. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" may be the best acted of the three films, with excellent performances by Michael Caine (""Alfred""), Morgan Freeman (""Lucius Fox"") and especially, Gary Oldman (""Police Commissioner Jim Gordon"") that emphasize more than ever, the gravitas and emotional weight displayed by their characters. Viewers will also find commendable, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portrayal as devoted, heroic Gotham cop (""John Blake"") who symbolizes all that is still good within the corrupt Gotham police department. Marion Cotillard gives an emotionally and psychologically riveting performance as a wealthy green-energy advocate (""Miranda Tate""). Anne Hathaway's ""Selina Kyle"" is a fun-loving, sexually charged hustler and thief who becomes the catalyst for all of the film's plot threads. Though he's encased in his facial mask throughout the film, Tom Hardy (""Bane"") is ""The Dark Knight"" franchise's most intelligent and diabolical villain, in a performance nearly as memorable as Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" from ""The Dark Knight"".Eight years after the events of ""The Dark Knight"", Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is a reclusive millionaire, suffering from its psychological and emotional toll, retired from his crime-fighting duties as the Batman. Harvey Dent is celebrated as a crime-fighting hero murdered by Batman; only Gotham Police Commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) knows the truth, but is afraid to speak it.  Neither one knows that a ""storm"" is about to burst upon the city of Gotham; a storm orchestrated by the mysterious ""Bane"" and his terrorist militia army; one where they will have the city's inhabitants seeking justice and retribution from Gotham's wealthiest elite. Wayne will wage an intense, emotionally-charged, psychological battle within himself, wondering whether he can defeat Bane and rescue Gotham from its ""date"" with an unspeakable calamity that will reduce the city into ruins. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is indeed a most impressive cinematic achievement and one destined to be remembered as among this year's finest films.",5,An Epic Conclusion to The Dark Knight,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,2808,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'most', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'trilogy', 'Batman', 'films', 'directed', 'Christopher', 'F.', 'Nolan', 'When', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'Christopher', 'F.', 'Nolan', 'said', 'interest', 'directing', 'Batman', 'movie', 'most', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'three', 'films', 'drawing', 'predecessors', 'provide', 'rich', 'back-story', 'cataclysmic', 'events', 'unfold', 'Nolan', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'have', 'written', 'intricate', 'script', 'rich', 'emotion', 'action', 'will', 'leave', 'viewers', 'suspense', 'very', 'end', 'not', 'minute', 'wasted', 'film', 'more', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'one', 'will', 'seem', 'much', 'shorter', 'length', 'due', 'ample', 'psychological', 'physical', 'action', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'acted', 'three', 'films', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'especially', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Police', 'Commissioner', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'more', 'ever', 'gravitas', 'emotional', 'weight', 'displayed', 'characters', 'Viewers', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'commendable', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'portrayal', 'devoted', 'heroic', 'Gotham', 'cop', 'John', 'Blake', 'who', 'still', 'good', 'corrupt', 'Gotham', 'police', 'department', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'emotionally', 'psychologically', 'riveting', 'performance', 'wealthy', 'green-energy', 'advocate', 'Miranda', 'Tate', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'fun-loving', 'sexually', 'charged', 'hustler', 'thief', 'who', 'catalyst', 'film', 'plot', 'threads', 'encased', 'facial', 'mask', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Bane', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'franchise', 'most', 'intelligent', 'diabolical', 'villain', 'performance', 'nearly', 'as', 'memorable', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'Dark', 'Knight', '.Eight', 'years', 'events', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'reclusive', 'millionaire', 'suffering', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'toll', 'retired', 'crime-fighting', 'duties', 'Batman', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'celebrated', 'crime-fighting', 'hero', 'murdered', 'Batman', 'only', 'Gotham', 'Police', 'Commissioner', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'truth', 'afraid', 'speak', 'one', 'storm', 'burst', 'city', 'Gotham', 'storm', 'orchestrated', 'mysterious', 'Bane', 'terrorist', 'militia', 'army', 'one', 'where', 'will', 'have', 'city', 'inhabitants', 'seeking', 'justice', 'retribution', 'Gotham', 'wealthiest', 'elite', 'Wayne', 'will', 'wage', 'intense', 'emotionally-charged', 'psychological', 'battle', 'wondering', 'can', 'defeat', 'Bane', 'rescue', 'Gotham', 'date', 'unspeakable', 'calamity', 'will', 'reduce', 'city', 'ruins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'indeed', 'most', 'impressive', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'one', 'destined', 'be', 'remembered', 'year', 'finest', 'films']",N/A

It sure shows!I normally only comment on the technical and presentation aspects of DVD's.""The Dark Knight Rises"" has a horrible soundtrack (2.0, 5.1 - I listened to both).  I could not understand most of the dialogue and NOTHING of whatever the character Bane was saying.  My experience was that of listening to a movie with mostly incomprehensible speech and gibberish.The picture is spectacular but I prefer to understand what is said when the characters talk, not guess.  Christopher Nolan should have made this a silent movie; then at least I could use my imagination, fill in the words myself, and I would not be distracted by dialogue I cannot understand.  I should mention that this is almost a flawless DVD with one, maybe two pauses during play.What will amaze you is the one extra feature on this DVD:  ""The Journey of Bruce Wayne"".  I played that and it was thoroughly refreshing to hear people actually speaking clearly!  Hah!  Why could such clarity not be achieved for the feature film?2-stars for high-quality DVD [play] and picture.  Sorry, sound is important to me.  I couldn't understand what people were saying sometimes even when I was looking at their lips.  Very weird sound mixing and shortfalls for such a big-budget motion picture.  Bad experience.ADDENDUM 2013-02-18:This is the crappiest modern DVD I've ever heard, sound-wise.  I first watched this DVD December 07, 2012 and I had no further interest whatsoever in it ~ but decided to give it another try February 18, 2013.  I have listened to both Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 tracks, with the latter surprisingly being a little better.The director and writer introduce this very powerful and threatening criminal character, and you cannot understand a word that he is saying!  Of course, most of the other dialogue comes across as gibberish, too.It boggles my mind that in 2012 a movie would be made with such poor sound.  Save your money, and save 3 hours of your life -- buy some older DVD's and cheaper ones that have superior sound -- most will, trust me.It's not even entertainment.  I would say classify this DVD as ""frustration"".  Very, very poor product.  This Batman series would be dead anyway based on this DVD.  It's just... junk.  What a waste of time for the actors to be immortalized in trash.I am also going to reduce this to one star.  I hope to never sit through these 3-hours of garbage again.  And since the main characters wear masks, good luck reading lips!

1418491,AWG2O9C42XW5G,B004LWZWGA,,"[6, 10]","Well folks this is the last Batman movie for a while. i thought that this final conclusion to the dark knight was awesome. i really loved this movie. i will say this it was not as good as the dark knight, but it was still awesome. i was glad to see that they put Bane in this movie, that was a good toch. i thought that tom hardy was a great bane, he was not what i expected Bane to be i was looking for the bane who pumped venom into his veins to become huge and destroy batman. but this version of bane was really good. i thought that they could of done without catwoman. she really didn't need to be in this film. Catwoman was done well enough in batman returns. i mean an hathaway did a good job. but they didn't have the batman/catwoman flirtation like it is in the comics and tv show. and they nevfer fought once and she wasn't even called catwoman in the whole movie. so far that is two villians christopher nolan messed up with. two-face and catwoman. don't get me wrong his movies are good. but you do not put two major supervillians in one movie if you can't concentrate on them. Batman returns is a great example on having two major bad guys and concetrating on both. But i'm glad that they did the whole break batman down and have him rise feel in it. i;m not going to lie i loved this movie that was just some of my little quricks. i was happy with it and with the ending now maybe dc can do justice league since they had the ending the way they did. if you have not seen this movie i recommend you do",5,The Dark Night Ends,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,1514,"['Well', 'folks', 'last', 'Batman', 'movie', 'while', 'i', 'thought', 'final', 'conclusion', 'dark', 'knight', 'was', 'awesome', 'i', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'i', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'dark', 'knight', 'was', 'still', 'awesome', 'i', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'put', 'Bane', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'toch', 'i', 'thought', 'tom', 'hardy', 'was', 'great', 'bane', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'i', 'expected', 'Bane', 'be', 'i', 'was', 'looking', 'bane', 'who', 'pumped', 'venom', 'veins', 'become', 'huge', 'destroy', 'batman', 'version', 'bane', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'i', 'thought', 'could', 'done', 'catwoman', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'film', 'Catwoman', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'batman', 'returns', 'i', 'mean', 'hathaway', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'batman/catwoman', 'flirtation', 'comics', 'tv', 'show', 'nevfer', 'fought', 'once', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'called', 'catwoman', 'whole', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'two', 'villians', 'christopher', 'nolan', 'messed', 'up', 'two-face', 'catwoman', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'do', 'not', 'put', 'two', 'major', 'supervillians', 'one', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'concentrate', 'Batman', 'great', 'example', 'having', 'two', 'major', 'bad', 'guys', 'concetrating', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'whole', 'break', 'batman', 'have', 'rise', 'feel', 'i', 'not', 'going', 'lie', 'i', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'quricks', 'i', 'was', 'happy', 'ending', 'now', 'maybe', 'dc', 'can', 'do', 'justice', 'league', 'had', 'ending', 'way', 'did', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'recommend', 'do']",N/A
1418492,AHRQOLXJE4CBV,B004LWZWGA,,"[6, 15]","SEE MY FANBOY REVIEW BELOW.  There are times when I really hate being obligated to a star rating system, because some parts of the movie were 5 star caliber and other times it was 1 star caliber, and everthing else in between. The pacing was relatively good, but still could have done with out a few scenes here and there. The main villian's presence did offer that ominous impending doom that was absent from The Avengers movie, but TDKR hero payoff was somewhat shallow. And after a while it got pretty old watching the same method Bane would rid his helpless victims. As I was watching this I was wondering "" Is this movie a bit too apocalyptic for a Batman movie?"" For many people the greatness of a movie is measured in the number of explosions, how big they are, and how fast and long chase scenes are. So for those people this movie will rate very high. But for people like me who place story, intense drama, and great scripting first, and action and great visual effects to move the story along second, Batman Begins is by far the superior of the trilogy and the best Batman movie ever made. Watch it again, for the first time.FANBOY REVIEW:***** 5 stars. I wish it could be 20 stars. This is the greatest movie ever made. It's equal to The Dark Knight, only better. But The Dark Knight is better. Bane was just as awesome as the Joker, but he wasn't as awesome as the joker. The Joker wasn't as awesome as Bane. I can't believe how awesome this movie is. I'm going to throw away all my other dvds , and only keep my Dark Knight. Then when The Dark Knight Rises comes to dvd I'm going to buy two TV sets another dvd player and play both movies side by side all day everyday for the rest of my life, because after seeing these movies I simply can't make up my mind which one is awesomer. Or is that awesomest. Oh I simply can't get over how perfect these movies are. Especially this one and especially the other one. You know what I'm going to do I'm going to take as many days off from work while the TDKR is in the theatres and watch it over and over all day long. Then I'll go home and watch TDK on dvd all night long until TDKR comes to dvd. Then I can watch both at the same time like I mentioned before. : END OF REVIEW. There.

1418494,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B004LWZWGA,,"[7, 13]","I read the reviews for ""The Dark Knight Rises"" saying there were a lot of plot holes and I wasn't expecting much, I should know better, I thought the ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was the best Batman movie, period.Christian Bale back as Bruce Wayne/Batman, who has been a recluse for eight years because Batman is wanted for the murder of Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne is mourning the death of Rachael Dawes, his only companion and confidant Alfred, once again portrayed by Michael Caine, who has been urging Bruce to get back into life and move on, Bruce can't. While Lucius Fox played by Morgan Freeman tries to lure Bruce back to Batman by showing him some cool new weapons, including one called ""The Bat.""During a fundraiser at Wayne Manor, Bruce is staying in his private quarters and discovers a cat burglar, Anne Hathaway, the first catwoman (although she's never called that in the movie) that has some real claws, stealing his mother's pearl necklace, but taking an acrobatic leap out of a window, evades the hobbled Bruce Wayne.And emerging from the sewers of Gotham is Bane, a muscle bound mercenary bent on the destruction of Gotham city by nuclear bomb, he cuts off Gotham from the mainland by blowing the bridges and instituting a sort of French Revolution cum ""Escape From New York"" scenario.One of the most frequently mentioned drawbacks of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is that Batman doesn't make an appearance in the film until 45 minutes into the film, but in that time the story, the plot and characters are being developed so Batman's physical presence doesn't leave a hole in the film or a sense of emptiness at his absence until he appears, as we know he will. The other plot holes are minor and while you may notice one it is soon overwhelmed by the story and the progress it makes.Director and writer Christopher Nolan (along with brother Jonathon Nolan) wrote an elegantly plotted thriller that has eliminated some of the clunkiness of ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" that has enough misdirection in it to keep viewers guessing as to what will happen next and who the real villain is. It's obvious the Nolan's were bringing their Dark Knight saga full circle, there are references and cameos to the other two movies including one by Liam Neeson that almost detracts from the film because it almost seems like he's a force ghost from ""Star Wars."" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a violent movie but it also has some real emotional depth at the end brought to you by Michael Caine's Alfred.",5,"Best Batman, Period",1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,2502,"['read', 'reviews', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'saying', 'were', 'lot', 'plot', 'holes', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'thought', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'was', 'best', 'Batman', 'movie', 'period.Christian', 'Bale', 'back', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'who', 'been', 'recluse', 'eight', 'years', 'Batman', 'wanted', 'murder', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'mourning', 'death', 'Rachael', 'Dawes', 'only', 'companion', 'confidant', 'Alfred', 'once', 'again', 'portrayed', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'been', 'urging', 'Bruce', 'get', 'back', 'life', 'move', 'Bruce', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'lure', 'Bruce', 'back', 'Batman', 'showing', 'cool', 'new', 'weapons', 'including', 'one', 'called', 'Bat', 'fundraiser', 'Wayne', 'Manor', 'Bruce', 'staying', 'private', 'quarters', 'cat', 'burglar', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'first', 'catwoman', 'never', 'called', 'movie', 'real', 'claws', 'stealing', 'mother', 'pearl', 'necklace', 'taking', 'acrobatic', 'leap', 'window', 'hobbled', 'Bruce', 'Wayne.And', 'emerging', 'sewers', 'Gotham', 'Bane', 'muscle', 'mercenary', 'bent', 'destruction', 'Gotham', 'city', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'off', 'Gotham', 'mainland', 'blowing', 'bridges', 'instituting', 'sort', 'French', 'Revolution', 'cum', 'Escape', 'From', 'New', 'York', 'scenario.One', 'most', 'frequently', 'mentioned', 'drawbacks', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'make', 'appearance', 'film', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'time', 'story', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'being', 'developed', 'Batman', 'physical', 'presence', ""n't"", 'leave', 'hole', 'film', 'sense', 'emptiness', 'absence', 'know', 'will', 'other', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'minor', 'may', 'notice', 'one', 'soon', 'overwhelmed', 'story', 'progress', 'makes.Director', 'writer', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'brother', 'Jonathon', 'Nolan', 'wrote', 'elegantly', 'plotted', 'thriller', 'eliminated', 'clunkiness', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'enough', 'misdirection', 'keep', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'who', 'real', 'villain', 'obvious', 'Nolan', 'were', 'bringing', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'full', 'circle', 'are', 'references', 'cameos', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'including', 'one', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'almost', 'detracts', 'film', 'almost', 'force', 'ghost', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'violent', 'movie', 'also', 'real', 'emotional', 'depth', 'end', 'brought', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred']",N/A

1418497,A140XH16IKR4B0,B004LWZWGA,,"[8, 22]","Half a loaf rising.The first two installments of the Dark Knight series - ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" - provided plenty of cerebral fodder to chew on when not regaling us with vertiginous fist fights, wild villains and novel weapons. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" has ditched the brain food for an occasionally dreary pate of mass boxing, an obnoxiously booming soundtrack and smaller-than life heroes. Not that this is a bad movie. It is plenty entertaining. But it fails to complete the brains-and-brawn arc drawn by the first two installments.Telling the entire story would spoil the plot twists in this film. Suffice it to say that after his long-ago encounter with the Joker, Bruce Wayne has hung up his cape and cowl and retreated into self-pity and isolation. The Wayne empire, source of his wealth and philanthropy, has been ignored and is on the verge of collapse. Wayne needs a major kick in the cape to propel him out of the doldrums and back into the fray. The kick comes in the form of a nasty bad guy - Bain - a brawny psychopath who wears a Darth-Vader-ish mouthpiece. Bain and his henchmen have focused their attention on Gotham City, and plan the beginning of some global-sized hijinks.What the film lacks in depth, it gains in length. At two and three-quarters hours long, no viewer can say they didn't get their money's worth. The film's pace, just a hair above languid, gives the director plenty of time to spin out his series-ending plot. It's hardly a spoiler to tell that the League of Shadows, the bud guys from Batman Begins, have not taken their sights off Gotham City. Like avenging angels with a fixation on sin, the League still wants to destroy Gotham for its crimes. The convoluted plot involves boardroom attempts to save the Wayne empire, stories from a mysterious Middle Eastern prison, a distraught Alfred, a talented cat burglar and Bruce Wayne's battered and aging frame.My criticism is that the film only hinted at themes that could have made it a killer film. The bad guys are given a ridiculously long time to harry Gotham, giving their enemies plenty of time to regroup. Good thing, because Bruce Wayne is aging, depressed and out of shape. A doctor confirms that his knees have no remaining cartilage. But a few pushups, pull-ups (and in one case, a punch in the spine) later, and all is well, infirmities forgotten. An inexplicable conflict with Alfred manages only to be mawkish and embarrassing. The fight scenes, especially one in which Batman and a few thousand cops engage in a ridiculous and dull street brawl with the bad guys, make Batman look small. And, people, we must never, never see Batman *walk* anywhere! The bat drops in unexpectedly or is silhouetted against the moon - not taking an evening stroll in that goofy getup.Sure, there are plenty of explosions, peril, close calls and coolish gadgets in the film. But how cool are they when an extraneous character jumps on the Bat bike for the first time and rides it as well as  Batman? How neat is the Batmobile when a police chopper shadows it without difficulty? How bad is a boss when a mere fistfight can take him out. How deep can a movie be when it cheats the audience of a challenging ending?

1418500,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B004LWZWGA,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 6]","One question remains after viewing the last epic installment of Christopher Nolan's `Dark Knight Trilogy,' `The Dark Knight Rises,' ""What more could we expect?""  Surely the final chapter is as much a visual masterpiece as its predecessors.  The action scenes are ample; the wide angle chases still fill one with vertigo; and in every way the special effects are stunning.  Expect plenty of Oscar nominations (and some wins) for `The Dark Knight Rises' for its technical achievements.There's no lack of acting ability in the film, either.  Besides old staples like Christian Bale (Batman), Michael Caine (Alfred), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) and Gary Oldman (Commissioner Gordon), there are fresh characters fully fleshed out, especially  Detective Burke, a Harvey Dent successor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a Bruce Wayne laisson (Marion Cotillard) a chief, new super enemy in Bane (Tom Hardy), and Batman's new frenemy in crime, Cat Woman (Anne Hathaway) stand out especially.  (Note that Gordon-Levitt, Murphy, Hardy, and Cotillard join the talent pool as alumni from `Inception.')The plot is not simple, but most of the movie surely reflects the themes with a post 9-11, Great Recession resonance.  Newly minted misfit Bane takes over Gotham City--first with a stock exchange takeover and later with a planted neutron bomb.  He looks like a WWF character with a muzzle, and sounds and talks like a second cousin to Darth Vader.  (He even has some dialogue with Batman more than reminiscent of the former trilogy.)  In the background is Bruce Wayne/Batman convalescing over the bruises to his image as well as to his body.  There are many side-plots that crossover, but much of the movie spends time--almost too much--revealing the background, the identity, and the motivations of Bane and several other criminals who have brought new chaos to Gotham.  In the midst of pandemonium, is a vigilante group of law enforcers (or wreckers), including a rogue court held by a self-appointed judge (Cillian Murphy).  One of the movie's problems is it goes from exposition, action, to exposition, action until we get exposition past the first half of the movie, and the movie is not short by any measure.As a roller-coaster entertainment `The Dark Knight Rises' wins.  It takes the threads of `The Dark Knight' and neatly picks up where it left off.  The points made, the resolution brought does bring closure in a satisfying way.  It keeps to the premise that to build suspense the central hero has to be on the ropes for as long as possible.  The biggest drawback to the finale' is that it takes on too much.  Surely chaos in the real world is complicated--one with many subplots and strings attached--but in a movie, the story needs to be told in a simpler way.  (The first two movies had several plot points, but they were more finely honed.)  While `Batman Begins' hit the refresh button on the franchise, and `The Dark Knight' took comic book movies to heights unseen before or since, the final installment sometimes bites off much more than it can chew.",4,"Grand Finale,' Great Closure with Few Exceptions",1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,3048,"['One', 'question', 'viewing', 'last', 'epic', 'installment', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Trilogy', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'expect', 'Surely', 'final', 'chapter', 'as', 'much', 'visual', 'masterpiece', 'predecessors', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'ample', 'wide', 'angle', 'chases', 'still', 'fill', 'one', 'vertigo', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'stunning', 'Expect', 'plenty', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'wins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'technical', 'achievements.There', 'lack', 'acting', 'ability', 'film', 'either', 'old', 'staples', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'are', 'fresh', 'characters', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'especially', 'Detective', 'Burke', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'successor', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'laisson', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'chief', 'new', 'super', 'enemy', 'Bane', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Batman', 'new', 'frenemy', 'crime', 'Cat', 'Woman', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'stand', 'out', 'especially', 'Note', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Murphy', 'Hardy', 'Cotillard', 'join', 'talent', 'pool', 'alumni', 'Inception', 'plot', 'not', 'simple', 'most', 'movie', 'surely', 'themes', 'post', '9-11', 'Great', 'Recession', 'resonance', 'Newly', 'minted', 'misfit', 'Bane', 'Gotham', 'City', 'first', 'stock', 'exchange', 'takeover', 'later', 'planted', 'neutron', 'bomb', 'WWF', 'character', 'muzzle', 'sounds', 'talks', 'second', 'cousin', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'even', 'dialogue', 'Batman', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'former', 'trilogy', 'background', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'convalescing', 'bruises', 'image', 'as', 'well', 'body', 'are', 'many', 'side-plots', 'crossover', 'much', 'movie', 'time', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'revealing', 'background', 'identity', 'motivations', 'Bane', 'several', 'other', 'criminals', 'who', 'have', 'brought', 'new', 'chaos', 'Gotham', 'midst', 'pandemonium', 'vigilante', 'group', 'law', 'enforcers', 'wreckers', 'including', 'rogue', 'court', 'held', 'self-appointed', 'judge', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'One', 'movie', 'problems', 'exposition', 'action', 'exposition', 'action', 'get', 'exposition', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'short', 'measure.As', 'roller-coaster', 'entertainment', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'wins', 'threads', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'neatly', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'points', 'made', 'resolution', 'brought', 'bring', 'closure', 'satisfying', 'way', 'premise', 'build', 'central', 'hero', 'be', 'ropes', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'finale', 'too', 'much', 'Surely', 'chaos', 'real', 'world', 'complicated', 'one', 'many', 'subplots', 'strings', 'attached', 'movie', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'simpler', 'way', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'had', 'several', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'more', 'finely', 'honed', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'hit', 'refresh', 'button', 'franchise', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'took', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'heights', 'unseen', 'before', 'final', 'installment', 'sometimes', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'chew']",N/A

So, apparently Bane gets together a group of terrorists to first cut off Gotham from the rest of the world so they can let all the criminals out, trap the cops underground, kill all rich people and ultimately nuke the place?  Umm okay.The saving grace here is Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Joseph Gordon Levitt as good guy John Blake.  I found Batman whiny and annoying through most of this film, when he wasn't flat on his back shrieking in pain.I am of the opinion that a hero needs to ""Rise"" and stalk hoity-toity directors like Christopher Nolan.  I call this dastardly foe THE EDITOR who will swoop in and slice extraneous plot developments and entire characters.  THIS FILM WAS TOO LONG.  Any impact it may have had was completely destroyed by the number of times I rolled my eyes and checked my watch.  Sometimes, shorter is better.The way it all wrapped up in the end was kinda neat, with the important people being clued in to the truth and Gotham getting an immortal, infallible hero to worship and the whole John Blake / Robin thing.

1418503,AVAHA06K08ZKK,B004LWZWGA,Alwyn Lau,"[11, 16]","Bruce Wayne: ""You're afraid that if I go back out there, I'll fail.""Alfred Pennyworth: ""No. I'm afraid that you want to.""The Dark Knight Rises (2012) was without doubt one of the most realistically spectacular movies around. No mere CGI extravaganza, it presented audiences with a vision of total anarchy and the complete upheaval of society. One could even say that Dark Knight Rises is the logical realization and completion of the nightmare presented in The Dark Knight (2008).What follows is less a 'product review' than a politico-philosophical re-viewing of the movie. From a filmographic perspective, I didn't feel this movie was ALL that much to shout about. A good sound-track, a grand plot and complex characters was, IMO, partially deflated by over-length and insufficient action. Bane and Batman boxing each other towards the end simply didn't ""fit"" a grand finale. Nevertheless, I've given the movie 4 stars for the political questions it taunts sensitive viewers with, especially in an era of 'OCCUPY' movement, growing global inequality and so on. A good movie interacts with its socio-political context. If nothing else, Dark Knight Rises does exactly this.a) Gotham, Batman & Unknown KnownsWe can begin by contrasting the two villains. Bane is most unlike the Joker. Yet in a powerful way Bane is the fulfillment of the Joker's being and agenda. In the earlier movie, the identity of Batman was one of the central riddles the Joker was trying to resolve i.e. it was a known un-known (something we realise we don't yet know and hence want to find out). In DK-Rises, however, Batman himself was fighting to defeat a trauma (of identity, of purpose, of possibility) he had locked away for eight years i.e. it's a unknown known (something we REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE we know and hence have to undergo some crisis in order to re-know this `thing').For the Joker, Batman was the obstacle to chaos in the city; for Bane, Batman and the city are synonymous. Bruce Wayne's reclusive behavior mirrored the `eyes wide shut' condition of Gotham which kept on singing the praises of Harvey Dent (an insane murderer), encouraged by of all people its chief of police. Wayne's problem from the start was that, as per Alfred's words, he wanted to fail but didn't know it. Likewise, Gotham, like any modern-day metropolis or Capitalism as a whole, seems all too determined to succeed whilst secretly or unconsciously being hell bent on destroying itself. This is why Bane treated Batman (or Bruce Wayne) in virtually the same way he treated the city: bring him to his knees, let him suffer slowly, with death coming only after a prolonged period. Bane needed Wayne and Gotham to see clearly and without any doubt whatsoever the disavowed rot at the kernel of their being.If there is one thing more frightful than a terrifying truth that has remained concealed from the public, it's the publicly known truth that has remained unspoken. So a big question for societies is: What else do we ALL know full well yet cannot bear to hear repeated out loud?b) The Good, The Bad & The RealBane, in many senses, was a clear `improvement' over the Joker. The Joker threatened anarchy; Bane delivered it. The Joker tried (and failed) to demonstrate that individuals were at heart completely selfish; Bane successfully revealed that at the heart of society was an impossible trauma (even as he managed to bring Batman to his lowest depths). The Joker sought to show that inside a good man, there is only bad; Bane made it clear that what we understand as Good (e.g. the justice system) is really the Bad (e.g. the unjust political `carving up' of the city) in another form. Thus, DK-Rises shows us what we choose everyday to half-ignore : the hypocrisy of the rule of law in outlawing everything except its own transgressions.The Joker transformed the city's White Knight (i.e. Harvey Dent) into its traitor; Bane showed that the city itself, Gotham, was an intra-social betrayal on a massive scale. The betrayal of the people (in the form of community-wide lies, political corruption and so on), far from being a threat to the city, in fact, constituted it and sustained its being.The Joker manipulated the police; Bane tore up the very idea of the police. The Joker tried to rope in the city's criminals; Bane made it a crime not to be a criminal and thus exposed the biggest crime of all: society itself. The scene in DK-Rises where a psychopathic doctor presides over a kangaroo court and sentences all the former VIPs' and public officials to death (or exile) is striking, for is it not simply the fantasmatic inverse of actual court proceedings? Don't we urgently require a ""Bane event"" for the very criminals who at present use the law to justify their crimes?And can't the scene where Bane released all the prisoners, far from suggesting the terror of a society overrun by convicted criminals, hint at redemptive Biblical notions of `setting prisoners free'? Simply imagine the words `GTMO' in the background. To the extent that political change relies on the Law, is it not apparent that no true change can happen without the death and rebirth of the Law itself?The Dark Knight Rises hints that true transformation may need more than sincere politicians, better police, more integrated technology, cleaner elections or even a masked vigilante. True change requires a deep glimpse of the destruction that's forthcoming. True change requires a broken body and prolonged suffering in loneliness and hopelessness. True change may even mean that our bridges to the outside world (or practical escape route out of a pit-prison) are destroyed so we're forced to look inwards and face the truth we've chosen to un-know over time. A real rising requires a real death.In short, the movie ultimately provokes us to question what's good, what's bad, what isn't real and what it takes to make all things Real again. Most of all, it reminds us of the consequences of sticking to the status quo. What happens if we persist in lying to ourselves? What's the future like if the truly bad guys are venerated as good and vice-versa? Christopher Nolan's answer seems clear: We either continue living like a prisoner - or we face a nuclear winter.",4,Dark Politics Rising,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,6217,"['Bruce', 'Wayne', ""'re"",

1418506,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B004LWZWGA,Andre Dursin,"[16, 22]","Christopher Nolan's triumphant, apparently final installment in his Batman saga, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, is a compelling, exciting piece of modern filmmaking - more of a direct sequel to its initial entry, ""Batman Begins,"" than its immediate predecessor, the repetitive ""The Dark Knight.""Set several years after the events of TDK, Gotham City finds itself once again under siege - this time from a mercenary named Bane (Tom Hardy) who wears a mask and talks like a muffled version of Darth Vader by way of Christopher Plummer in ""Star Trek VI."" Nobody has seen The Batman since the night of Harvey Dent's death, with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, seeming less uptight this time around) hiding out as a recluse in Wayne Manor, much to the chagrin of Alfred (Michael Caine), who just wants to see his master join the ranks of the living again. Bruce's world is initially perked up by a cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), who's gotten herself wrapped up in the new world order that Bane's ""Occupy Gotham"" army represents - but it's just a teaser for the resurrection of Batman himself, who's desperately needed by its residents and a beleaguered Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), who finds a new ally in crusading young cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).""The Dark Knight Rises"" is confident, visually compelling and just a bit overlong. The script, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is better balanced than the redundant structure of ""The Dark Knight,"" which found Batman continuously trying to save Gotham, only to be thwarted by a psychotic act from The Joker. This picture is less sadistic as well, with more of a redemptive finale that proves to be enormously satisfying as Nolan at last breaks out of the constant doom and gloom that the last picture was dominated by.Most of the additions to the cast help enormously, from Hathaway's fetching turn as Catwoman and Gordon-Levitt's tireless police detective, to welcome on-screen appearances by veteran actors Matthew Modine and William Devane, and a few surprise cameos from veterans of Nolan's earlier Batman pictures. Bane himself is a little goofy, but Hardy packs a muscular presence, and series veterans Caine and Oldman have several fine scenes as well. Less effective is Marion Cotillard's red herring role as the new head of Wayne Enterprises and Bruce's latest love conquest - given where the story ultimately concludes, there should have been more of the relationship between Bruce and Selina, though romanticism has never been one of Nolan's strong suits.A few elements also fall short - a somewhat bloated stretch where Bruce finds himself in Bane's prison drags the film down with Batman sidelined for too long a duration (ironic that, no matter if it's Burton, Schumacher or Nolan, the focus always seems to drift off the Caped Crusader in every one of these pictures). There's a bit too much Bane and several pretentious, accompanying monologues, while Hans Zimmer's ridiculously over-scored soundtrack feels the need to punctuate every scene - even the quieter dramatic beats - like a sledgehammer.Still, it's hard to envision fans and casual viewers alike not being satisfied with this rousing third installment.

How in the world was Nolan going to compete with himself?  When you have a film that not only became a boxoffice smash hit but also managed to layer topical themes, contain breaking edge visuals and deliver one of the most iconic comic book performances of all time it is hard to do anything but disappoint.Nolan doesn't; at least not entirely.Sure, if you want into this expecting to compare this frame for frame with `The Dark Knight', you're going to be let down.  The second installment in this beloved trilogy is by far the best of the best, but that isn't to say that `The Dark Knight Rises' doesn't rise to the occasion (pun intended) and deliver something breathtaking in the process.  Making the most of its lengthy running time, we are treated to a visceral feast (the lighting, the effects, the skin tight catsuit) that may regurgitate a few tricks (if I were a citizen of Gotham City, I'd move FAR AWAY) but that ultimately stands up as a monumental feat in the comic book movie world.Bale, Caine, Gordon-Levitt, Oldman, Hardy and Hathaway are all fantastic in their roles, with Hathaway being sensationally layered and delivering a very different performance than her Oscar winning role in `Les Miserables' (both were worthy of the gold, making her one of the most deserved Oscar winners in recent history).  Nolan works wonders behind the camera, setting up his epic journey in a way that spellbinds the audience.  He is a master of his craft, a true showman who understands who to develop action scenes with class.

After Christopher Nolan finished The Dark Knight in 2008 he said he would not be interested in making another film, unless he had a story to tell and was compelling enough. He would go on to create his third entry in the Dark Knight saga with focus on Bruce Wayne. The majority of this film delves into dark, depressing circumstances that not only is affecting Bruce Wayne but with the city of Gotham. The relationship between Bruce and the city is shown through characters such as John Blake and the Wayne Foundation; Commissioner Gordon and how a lie weights down his life and the fear that everything will be undone. There may be little Batman shown in TDKR but when you do it shows how little time he has left physically and mentally.Bane is a great character choice to insert by Christopher Nolan cause it showcases the trials and tribulations both he and Bruce Wayne have gone through. There is more to Bane than mere destruction and brutality. Both characters were portrayed to have risen and fight with determination no matter what.Hans Zimmer's score for The Dark Knight Rises is amazing and fits with the tone of the movie. Probably the best score out of the three.Overall, The Dark Knight Rises Successfully concludes the trilogy with a deep and heavy revelation that even heroes have despair and that there can be no true despair without hope.",5,"Fear, Chaos, and Pain",1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,1488,"['How', 'describe', 'excitement', 'watching', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'tenth', 'time', 'once', 'theaters', '9', 'times', 'home', 'WOW', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'finished', 'Dark', 'Knight', '2008', 'said', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'making', 'film', 'had', 'story', 'tell', 'was', 'compelling', 'enough', 'would', 'go', 'create', 'third', 'entry', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'saga', 'focus', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'majority', 'film', 'dark', 'depressing', 'circumstances', 'not', 'only', 'affecting', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'city', 'Gotham', 'relationship', 'Bruce', 'city', 'shown', 'characters', 'such', 'John', 'Blake', 'Wayne', 'Foundation', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'how', 'lie', 'weights', 'down', 'life', 'fear', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'undone', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'Batman', 'shown', 'TDKR', 'when', 'do', 'how', 'little', 'time', 'left', 'physically', 'mentally.Bane', 'great', 'character', 'choice', 'insert', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'cause', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'have', 'gone', 'more', 'Bane', 'mere', 'destruction', 'brutality', 'characters', 'were', 'portrayed', 'have', 'risen', 'fight', 'determination', 'matter', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'amazing', 'tone', 'movie', 'Probably', 'best', 'score', 'three.Overall', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'Successfully', 'trilogy', 'deep', 'heavy', 'revelation', 'even', 'heroes', 'have', 'despair', 'can', 'be', 'true', 'despair', 'hope']",N/A

Harvey Dent, he sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was for a greater good. For a time, it worked.  Criminal activity in Gotham City was stopped by the Dent Act. Everything changes with the arrival of a cat burglar with a mysterious agenda.  Then, the emergence of Bane comes. Bane, a masked terrorist who has ruthless plans for Gotham City. It is then, and only then, that Bruce comes out of retirement as The Batman.Honestly, I didn't know how I'd come out of this movie...loving it or hating it. After The Dark Knight, there were alot of high expectations set on this film. However, after watching the movie, I'll admit..this is a satisfying conclusion to Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Does it outdo the previous movie? No..but, taken on its' own merits, The Dark Knight Rises is an outstanding Batman film. There's lots of relentless action, a deep(scratch that)...an extremely deep storyline and plenty of eye candy. Tom Hardy doesn't make Bane quite as memorable a villain as Heath Ledger did as The Joker but he's quite an imposing force in the movie. To be honest, I never really cared for Tom Hardy as an actor but, after seeing him play Bane, I'm more confident in his acting chops and will start picking up his movies more. Christian Bale does an outstanding job as Bruce Wayne & Batman, like always. Anne Hathaway does a wonderful job as Selina Kyle/Catwoman and she provides some much needed comic relief in a movie that'd be exhausting emotionally otherwise. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine all did great jobs as their respective characters.Out of all the superhero movies that were out this year, I'd have to give this one the absolute top billing as the one I liked most. Even though The Avengers got the most credit and The Amazing Spider Man was the most fun, The Dark Knight Rise was the most compelling one out of them all.

1418518,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B004LWZWGA,Brian C.,"[2, 3]","I just finished watching this for the second time (the first time was in the theater) so I thought I would write my review now. I was eagerly awaiting the release of this movie. I have been a huge fan of the franchise ever since the originalBatman Begins [Blu-ray]. Whenever I am really excited about a new movie, I tend to feel a little disappointed the first time I see it. That is why I watched this movie a second time, and I definitely enjoyed it more the second time around. I am not going to give an overview of the plot. Other reviewers have done that. I am going to simply list what I liked about the movie (and one thing, at the end of my review, that I did not like). There are some spoilers in my review so if you have not seen the movie yet you probably should not read my review. This is also a very long review. Once I start writing I usually find it difficult to stop. Alright, enough preface, onto the review!I have always liked the idea of super hero movies, but there are actually very few super hero movies that I really enjoy. In fact, I do not even watch very many of them, because in my experience I am almost always disappointed with them. The three Nolan Batman movies are really the only super hero movies that I think get it right. There are a number of reasons I think these films work so well. Here are some of the reasons I think this particular film works so well.First, it is set in the real world, and not some cartoonish world. I realize that some super heroes can only exist in a cartoonish world. Batman is one of the only super heroes that is, ultimately, just a guy in a suit. When you start talking about actual super powers you have obviously left the real world. Still, I am amazed at how few super hero movies attempt to create realistic characters, with understandable human motivations. Christopher Nolan has done a great job in this film, and the other Batman movies, creating a whole host of interesting and realistic characters. Ra's Al Ghoul, The Scarecrow, The Joker, and Bane are, in my opinion, the most interesting villains I have ever seen on screen. Each one is different, they have different motivations, and, most importantly, they are each unique. Most movie villains are essentially interchangeable with one another, you cannot tell them apart. The villains in these movies are real, full blooded and fully realized, characters, and so are all the other characters. That, on its own, is a real achievement.Second, the writing is very good. I did not think that the writing in this third movie was quite as good as in the first two. There were some lines, which I did not write down and cannot remember off the top of my head, where I thought ""I have heard that before"". But mostly the writing is quite good. I have been noticing lately how many cliched scenes tend to show up in films and television. I am starting to get the feeling that there are ten or twelve scenes that literally get passed from writing room to writing room, implanted directly from one movie right into the next (how many times have you seen the ""it's not your fault"" scene?) I did not get the feeling that any of the scenes in this movie were stock scenes that I had seen in half a dozen other movies. The writers put some thought into what they were attempting to say. I especially liked the underground prison which, I thought, was a particularly good metaphor for a kind of Chekhovian despair, and the solution (climb without the rope) was a good piece of writing. I had a few minor quibbles with the overall plot, holding the city to ransom with a nuclear device, but ultimately I think it worked.Third, it is more complex than the standard super hero flick. For example, is Cat Woman a hero or a villain? I love the way that they decided to make her both. All of the Batman movies tend to move past the simplistic good guy/bad guy dichotomy. The world itself is more complex than that. Everything is not all black and white. It is rare to see any kind of moral complexity in a super hero movie.Fourth, the acting is superb all around. Christopher Nolan has a knack for picking really good actors. The repeat characters, or the characters that appear in all three movies, are all excellent of course. Some of the best actors in the world. And all the new characters in this movie were equally excellent. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane, Anne Hathaway made an excellent Cat Woman, I have always been a big Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan, and Marion Cotillard, who I have had a minor crush on for years, was also excellent as Miranda Tate.Fifth, I love everything about Bane as a villain. Super hero movies are, in my opinion, more about the villain than the hero. If you have a really interesting villain then you are on your way to a really good movie, if you have a lackluster, or overly cartoonish, villain, then the movie is already ruined. Evil, for some reason, is just more interesting than good. The super hero is almost like the straight man. You need a good straight man. A bad straight man, or hero, can ruin a movie as well. But the hero represents us, the viewers, and our values. That is not where the true interest lies. The true interest lies in the villain. Bane is a very interesting and compelling villain. You feel his presence as soon as he enters the screen. Just the way he walks is enough to mesmerize. There is a scene where Cat Woman and Batman are fleeing from Daggett's, and there is a moment where Cat Woman turns around, there are probably a dozen henchman firing guns at her, and then there is Bane, just silently walking, and somehow Bane walking is far more interesting, and menacing, than all the henchman firing guns. He draws the eye, his presence is so much more powerful. It is only a split second, but it is one of my favorite scenes in the movie.Sixth, super hero movies need to be visceral and stir up emotions. I am a philosophy student, and I have actually spent quite a bit of time thinking about why people enjoy super hero movies. I do not really know the answer, but I have a theory. I think that super hero movies empower people. I think most people probably walk around with some unconscious fear or anxiety in their everyday lives. Bad things happen in the world. Even those of us who have never been the victim of a violent crime, know that they happen, and we have all probably been in situations where we were unsure of the outcome, where we felt things could go either way, or where we thought ""If things go badly here I am going to be in a lot of trouble."" I think that super hero movies are cathartic in the sense that they temporarily purge us of our fears. This movie does a good job tapping into that. There were a lot of ""goosebump"" moments in the movie for me, and when Batman finally starts to get the upper hand with Bane, you can feel it viscerally, in your body. That is what movies do, I think. They make you feel helpless (which is why you need a strong villain) and then they empower. This movie does that exceptionally well.Seventh, I know some people have complained about what they perceived to be the political message of the movie. It seems as if Bane represents the Occupy Wall Street movement. I do not know what Nolan's politics are, but I saw an interview where he said that they were just trying to show the cracks of society that people would try to wedge open. I actually think that was a good device. It made the movie more realistic, and it tapped into emotions that are already there. That is part of what made the movie visceral. Movies cannot create emotions in people out of thin air, they have to tap into emotions that are already there. I think the movie did a good job tapping into emotions that already exist in our society, complains that people already have, without becoming an overt political statement one way or the other. I think it made it a more powerful movie.There is one minor complaint I had with the movie. I know there were some plot holes, but plot holes, unless they are particularly gaping, do not usually bother me that much. I try to look at things from the writer's perspective. Movies are not meant to be carbon copies of real life, so it makes no sense to demand absolute realism from a movie. If you want absolute realism just live your life. Life itself is very realistic. So I am not going to go through the movie and pick apart the plot holes I thought I saw.There was, however, one place where I felt like the writer's made a real mistake, and that is the way that Bane was killed. Now, it makes total sense that Batman would have a ""no gun"" policy. When I say ""it makes total sense"" I do not mean that it makes sense from a moral standpoint, or from the standpoint of realism. No one has any moral objections to cops carrying guns, so they should not have any moral objections to Batman carrying a gun, and I am not sure it is really realistic to assume that a vigilante would adopt a ""no guns"" policy, for the same reasons that police officers do not have a no guns policy. When I say it makes sense I mean that it makes sense from a movie maker's perspective because Batman is a super hero. No one wants to watch Batman have gun battles. People want to see Batman fight, hand to hand, up close and personal. A hand to hand battle between Bane and Batman is way more interesting and engaging than a gun battle would be. However, it is not a good idea, in my opinion, to constantly remind the audience of the fact that Batman has that ""no gun"" policy. Particularly when a nuclear bomb is involved.The notion that Batman would still object to using guns when the city is being threatened with a nuclear device is obviously ridiculous. Now, I am not saying that the writer's should have given Batman a gun. Like I said, the audience wants to see Batman fighting, or using his bat stars, not shooting. What the writer's should not have done, in my opinion, is remind the audience over and over that Batman is not using guns. By having Cat Woman ride in on the bike and just shoot Bane the writer's are just reminding the audience that Batman could have killed Bane at any time if he had just been willing to use a gun, and just in case there are any audience members who do not make that connection immediately, they have Cat Woman make a ""humorous"" quip about Batman's no gun policy right after she does it! Why would you remind the audience that Batman could have killed Bane at any time? Perhaps they were trying to ""own it"" by getting out ahead of the criticism, but it tends, in my opinion, to undercut the whole movie.Bane took over an entire city because people were afraid of him. Why was everyone so afraid of him when anyone could have just shot him at any time? You do not want the audience to be thinking about such things, which is why I think they should have found another way to have Bane killed, and they should not have highlighted Batman's no gun policy (like the fight scene with Cat Woman). The no gun policy was already established in the prior movies, it should have gone unspoken in this one. That is a minor issue, and it certainly did not ruin the movie for me. All in all, I felt like this movie met my expectations, which were extremely high after the first two movies. Alright, that is the end of my review. Sorry it is so short. I just could not really think of much to say...",5,A visceral experience...,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,11351,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'theater',

I loved the Iron Man movies, the X-men were OK. I never liked any of the pre-Christian Bale Batman movies. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney. I like all these actors but they just weren't given a good script or director in this series.This movie was far superior than any that have come before. 2:45 is a long movie to sit through but I was never bored. The story, the action, effects, were all good. If I have any complaints it was with the Bane character's ridiculous mask and voice. And then the 'oh so obvious' surprise betrayal of Miranda. I saw that coming the moment Bruce got cozy with her.Other than those two things it was still the best of all the Batman movies.Well worth the rental price and well worth watching, but I feel no desire to see it again.I wish amazon would realize most of us feel that way about most movies. We just want to rent them, not buy them. Give us the option of just watching them once for $3.99 and not having to buy them.My wife really got onto me about how stupid I was to be buying movies from amazon, when I could buy the DVD for the same price and never have to rely on internet access to watch them again.

It's one of those movies you feel more than you necessarily comprehend.The movie very much mirrored it's villain; it's a beast. Massive, overwhelming, and unrelenting. The various subplots and character arcs of the film all intertwine and come together in an incredibly satisfying way ultimately - and pretty much every single cast member turns in a memorable performance with great emotional resonance.If it has one downfall, it may be that it's a little TOO big and monstrous to fathom at times, and I'm guessing many fans will come to enjoy TDK more purely because it's a bit simpler, less emotionally taxing film. But TDKR is very much the summer extravaganza done right. It's what Transformers 3, or The Matrix 2&3 or POTC 2&3 SHOULD have been, it improves upon what's already been done in HP and the Deathly Hollows and, most strangely, it both compliments and contrasts Avengers in every sense of the word - It's the ting to TA's yang, it's the night to TA's day, and thats really cool to see; for one superhero movie to elevate another to even greater success.I need to see it again. I need explore Bruce's character arc and journey a little bit more in depth. I need to let the shocking power and viciousness of Bane sink into my skull a little bit more. I need to gain a better grasp on the plot structure and exactly how each subplot ties into each other, and most importantly, I need to really explore what TDKR is trying to say socially, individually, and about the superheroes in general.Overall though, I'd say at least a 9/10 or 10/10. If its not the best movie of the year, it's the second best (I do love Moonrise Kingdom), and it will most assuredly go down as one of best movies - and possibly best superhero movie - ever made.",5,"Massive, overwhelming, and unrelenting.",1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,1994,"['do', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', ""'m"", 'capable', 'writing', 'review', 'having', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'so', 'hard', 'hitting', 'emotional', 'sense', 'Was', 'hard', 'even', 'grasp', 'more', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'film', 'one', 'movies', 'feel', 'more', 'necessarily', 'comprehend.The', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'mirrored', 'villain', 'beast', 'Massive', 'overwhelming', 'unrelenting', 'various', 'subplots', 'character', 'arcs', 'film', 'intertwine', 'come', 'together', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'way', 'ultimately', 'pretty', 'much', 'single', 'cast', 'member', 'memorable', 'performance', 'great', 'emotional', 'resonance.If', 'one', 'downfall', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'TOO', 'big', 'monstrous', 'fathom', 'times', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'come', 'enjoy', 'TDK', 'more', 'purely', 'bit', 'simpler', 'less', 'emotionally', 'taxing', 'film', 'TDKR', 'very', 'much', 'summer', 'extravaganza', 'done', 'right', 'what', '3', 'Matrix', '2', '3', 'POTC', '2', '3', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'HP', 'Deathly', 'Hollows', 'most', 'strangely', 'compliments', 'Avengers', 'sense', 'word', 'ting', 'TA', 'yang', 'night', 'TA', 'day', 'thats', 'really', 'cool', 'see', 'one', 'superhero', 'movie', 'elevate', 'even', 'greater', 'success.I', 'need', 'see', 'again', 'need', 'explore', 'Bruce', 'character', 'arc', 'journey', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'need', 'let', 'shocking', 'power', 'viciousness', 'Bane', 'sink', 'skull', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'need', 'gain', 'better', 'grasp', 'plot', 'structure', 'exactly', 'how', 'subplot', 'ties', 'other', 'most', 'importantly', 'need', 'really', 'explore', 'what', 'TDKR', 'trying', 'say', 'socially', 'individually', 'superheroes', 'general.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'least', '9/10', '10/10', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'second', 'best', 'do', 'love', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'will', 'most', 'assuredly', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'possibly', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'made']",N/A
1418524,A1PCESNDC808ZM,B004LWZWGA,Charles Griffin,"[9, 13]","Somehow he did it. Christopher Nolan has completed, for me, the ultimate Batman series. Ever since I was a child reading Batman and Detective Comics in the late 70's I've always wanted to see Batman on the big screen. But the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher films didn't quite satisfy me. No, I wanted a grittier Batman, not necessarily the darker Frank Miller style, but still somewhat grounded in reality. A Batman, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon and Rogue's Gallery that bares resemblance to that of the Denny O'Neil era, or possibly the later Jeph Loeb years.Then, in 2005, BATMAN BEGINS is released into theaters. Compared to Bat-movies of the past, it arrived with surprisingly modest hype. I guess we were all weary and cautious from the BATMAN & ROBIN debacle that came before it. Still, I had fairly high hopes as I sat in the theater. And before my eyes I saw the greatest Batman film ever...well, at the time anyway. Here was the ideal incarnation of Bruce Wayne/Batman as played by the intense young Christian Bale. Gary Oldman was a happy surprise as a Jim Gordon not that far removed from the depiction out of the graphic novel ""Batman: Year One"". Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, a character from the Denny O'Neil comics, which was wonderful to see. Also included from the O'Neil years is the character Ra's al Ghul, and who better to portray an older yet sufficiently intimidating warrior than Liam Neeson? Finally, they cast Michael Caine, my favorite actor, as Wayne's loyal Butler Alfred. Add a fantastic version of the Scarecrow (aka Jonathon Crane) and my dream was realized. The movie was well filmed. The screenplay was intelligent and the source material taken seriously. By the end, I felt like I was watching the Batman onscreen for the very first time.Three years later The Dark Knight is released and presented probably Batman's greatest crime thriller put to film. Featuring a fully formed, terrifying Joker. I always thought Batman's arch enemy should not be so much ""funny"" as he should be scary as hell. And, as we all know by now, Heath Ledger succeeded beyond all expectations. He created one of the all time great movie villains. Factor in the central character of Harvey Dent (and a personal favorite villain Two-Face) and we have what many consider the greatest Comic Book movie of all time.Which is why Nolan's follow up had such high expectations. Everyone wondered how THE DARK KNIGHT RISES could top THE DARK KNIGHT. That was never a question for me. I never expect a sequel to top a prior film in order to be good, or even great. I expect it to be a good story. If Nolan had one more good Batman story left in him, I'd be one happy Bat fan!And did he ever!Nolan and the screenwriters decided the only way to make a third film was to conclude Batman's story. It's a stroke of genius. Whenever I review movies on Amazon I usually stray from synopses and plot points. This is primarily out of laziness and because I'm more excited about my general feelings regarding the film. I'll just say that eight years after the final moments of THE DARK KNIGHT, Bruce Wayne's body and spirit have been damaged. He's a recluse, leaving Alfred to take care of Wayne Manor and Fox to run Wayne Enterprises. Batman and Gordon have seemingly made Gotham City a better place, with less organized crime, yet it's only a facade. There's evil brewing underneath the streets of Gotham with a grand scheme to turn the city on it's head. This evil is led by an international terrorist known only as Bane. And caught in the middle is cat burglar Selina Kyle. Anne Hathaway is a thief alright as she steals every scene she's in. Sometimes Nolan's Batman films have been called too dark and serious, but I have to say Hathaway's Selina (let's call her what she is, Catwoman!) is one of the most fun characters to grace any Batman film. I admit I've never appreciated the character Bane in the comics. He seemed like such a conveniently brainy yet brawny bad guy. Plus Bane looks like a Mexican wrestler...which is just weird. So, while I don't want to say I was worried, I was curious why the filmmakers chose Bane of all characters to pit against Batman. Now I know. Given the story, the villain could only be Bane (well, perhaps not only, wink). Instead of tights and a wrestler's mask, Bane sports a military uniform, hulking muscles and a contraption on his face that allows him to breath painlessly. His mask intimidates and conjures slight recollections of Darth Vader. And Tom Hardy's Bane is an absolute force of nature. He is smart. He is strong. He's a field general and a soldier all his own......and the initial confrontation between he and Batman is one of the greatest moments of any Batman film, certainly the most horrifying. I think it will be as classic as the Batman/Joker interrogation scene from THE DARK KNIGHT.As I've already given away, Bruce comes out of ""retirement"" to save Gotham once more. There's a heck of a lot to discuss regarding this film. There's all kinds of subtext and plot points and twists which I will leave alone. I will simply say that Bruce Wayne's journey in this film is (and perhaps has always been) about tragedy, triumph and sacrifice. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is epic. It's large scale. It covers a lot of ground. I've heard a few say there's not enough Batman and not enough fights. I must respectfully disagree. There's plenty of Batman and plenty of incredible action, with refreshingly few digital effects. There's also a lot of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne. And why shouldn't there be? This is Bruce Wayne's story. And while Wayne and Batman were always considered different personas in the previous Nolan films, both are closer than ever here. Batman and Bruce Wayne are almost one and the same this time around. This is not a continuity error. This is an indication that Wayne is no longer interested in carrying on the rich playboy public image. It seems he's long since taken off that mask and has no intention of putting it back on. That's my take anyway. My point being while watching THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, I no longer felt I was only watching Bruce in some scenes or only watching Batman in others...it was always the same guy. Although the Batsuit is still really, really cool!While Bale has been excellent in the trilogy, he gives his best performance of the character in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. Freeman is solid, as always. Oldman is an older Gordon, also scarred emotionally from the events of the last film. Consequently, Oldman gives perhaps his best performance in a Batman film. Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are new additions to the series yet are critical to the plot and certainly leave a lasting impression. And, as you might expect, Michael Caine's Alfred provides the heart of this story. There is an emotional impact to THE DARK KNIGHT RISES that I've never experienced in a comic book movie. Caine is one of the reasons why. There is a heartbreaking speech by Alfred that feels so genuine one could have heard a pin drop between sniffles from the audiences around me.That's what makes this Bat film unique. I have nothing against the other fine comic book films out there. This year alone provided a couple of incredibly fun, fantastic superhero movies that I enjoyed tremendously. But when it's all said and done, they feel like sweet dessert to THE DARK KNIGHT RISES' steak dinner. Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy has given us substance, thrills, scares, twists and, with this final film, tears.People want to compare THE DARK KNIGHT RISES to it's predecessors. That's just not how I view Nolan's trilogy. All three films are critical by themselves. BATMAN BEGINS is the perfect Batman origin film. THE DARK KNIGHT is the perfect Batman crime drama. And THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is Batman's perfect finale. Together they make a phenomenal series and one of the greatest trilogies of all time.So...I can't tell you THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the best of the Batman films, but I can tell you it's my favorite. Maybe that will change one day and I'll decide it's THE DARK KNIGHT or BATMAN BEGINS. That's how much they mean to me. That's how thankful I am that Chris Nolan brought my Batman to life.",5,A Big Bat Finale!,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,8182,"['Somehow', 'did', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'completed', 'ultimate',

1418532,A39YOBV3KK480S,B004LWZWGA,C. Lambeth,"[2, 3]","This latest batman movie seems to have been written from a standard action-hero formula. I called almost every plot ""twist"" before it happened. The one glowing exception was who the real villain was (not Bane). Even so, Bane was completely unbelievable as was his little face-mask thing. How did he eat, anyway, if it could not be removed without causing him excruciating pain?And Batman's displaced vertebre being realigned with a punch to the spine? Does it get any more ridiculous? Bruce Wayne would have been paralyzed permanently, and certainly not in butt-kicking mode with the big bad guy (Bane) who had just handed Batman his butt in a previous scene. Similarly, falling 40 feet on a static rope (prison chimney) would snap a person in half. Furthermore, the Batman roto-copter was lame, and the Bat-cycle was perhaps the most unbelievable machine in the movie. Rolling over the wheel-mounted guns to go sideways without so much as a bump, and then they continue to fire? Really? Its physics simply would not work, and this was more like watching a high-def cartoon. I understand that Batman movies are not ""realistic"" by nature, but this film's ""physics"" were so bad that they screamed out ""stupid"" to viewers and were so blatant as to be impossible to ignore.Also, consider the Gotham prison scene. There would have been no way for the prisoners to hear Bane's little motivational speech outside. The prison surely would not have had only one metal garage door keeping all the prisoners from the street, and finally, it should be pointed out that not all prison inmates want to get an AK-47 and shoot up the place, raping and pillaging as they go. Most real inmates deserve a better characterization. And please, could we have a Batman movie that didn't lean on prison or insane asylum inmates for once? Tiresome.Finally, that so many cops and innocent Gotham City residents were murdered and gunned down in general was troubling, especially given how much gun-related violence our nation continues to feed on (mass shootings) and promote (NRA). This Batman installment was a slight improvement over the previous movie, but not enough to warrant a favorable review.

1418534,A6UW2KEO5UOSA,B004LWZWGA,"Corey Turner ""The Musician""","[3, 4]","Christopher Nolan's iteration of the Dark Knight began in 2005 with Batman Begins, redeeming the franchise after Joel Schumacher's campy affair with Batman and Robin. The Dark Knight Rises is the third film of the series and serves as the finale, without a doubt it's of the largest scale. A terrifying villain stirred with a militia against an altruistic hero despised by the city he yearns to save. Thousands of people trampling through war ravished streets, an aerially high jacking of a plane, the things of a blockbuster, but with soul. The film carefully caresses deeper plot points; viewers may find the emotional scenes left burning in their mind while explosions continue to spread on screen.The Dark Knight Rises does not pick up right after the events of The Dark Knight, in fact, it has been eight years without The Batman and Gotham is doing just fine. Following the departure of Gotham's White Knight Harvey Dent, the Dent act was established, coinciding a honorary holiday founded on a little white lie about his demise. Commissioner Gordon holds attendance at the event, painfully recollecting what happened that night eight years ago, debating whether or not it's time to reveal the truth.Seems detective Blake, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has a hunch on what happened that night. Hot headed as he may be, his time on screen is not wasted, and he helps the audience get to the bottom of many character arcs. He is one of the few to still see Batman as an icon, a symbol of hope. This is a key point in the film as themes throughout deal with pain, false hope, and redemption.Bruce Wayne is now a limping Hughes imbued figure that quickly permeates back to the social scene taking on his juggled persona of well Bruce Wayne ""eccentric billionaire"". Christian Bale has received a lot of flak for his role as Batman, especially for the `voice', but as Bruce he is pretty sympathetic. New comer Miranda Tate attempts to bring Bruce back to room temp, feeling he has become a recluse due to a failed project. In many ways this film stretches its history back to the first film of the trilogy while acknowledging what made the Dark Knight so enticing to watch.Bruce is dealing with a dilemma, is Batman truly needed again? This not the same energetic Bruce, he dons a Ra's Al Ghul like beard, and only sparks to the Batcave when personal interest is at foot. He contemplates folding, he is brash, and as Alfred, Bruce's butler and all in one family, believes any attempts to wear the cape and cowl are an excuse, a far cry for help, and a death wish. Their complex relationship while briefly touched upon in this film is still deeply felt. Michael Caine could not have made for a better Alfred, displaying real concern, the wisdom of a father, and the sympathy of mother.On the other side, better yet, the underside of Gotham resides Bane. Bane is menacing, bronze only bested by hi wit. His hulking physique would have one misidentify his voice and choice of words with a tooth pick scholar, creating a unique villain. Nolan's Bane is not a grunting leather suited goober; Nolan's Bane is a terrorist who leads mercenaries that are willing to take a punch for him before even thinking about punching off the clock. Tom Hardy nailed his performance, Bane's face may be shrouded in mystery due to the metallic contraption on his face, but what little you can see, especially the intensity in his eyes, let you know doom waits.Anne Hathaway's slinky stature as Selina Kyle is mesmerizing. No she is not Catwoman per say but the idea is addressed in fashion, literally goggles that when pulled up resemble cat ears. Hathaway is seductive, quick to respond...and is also a jewel thief. Her role is vital in the beginning and is then seen less and less, as if her charm was too potent, and the cast elsewhere needed to be shown. Her chemistry with Christian Bale may be a hit or miss with some audience, I for one wanted to see more. A hurt and numbed Bruce talking to a callous and careful Selina had me reeling. Selina Kyle has her own agenda and perceives Bruce to be a typical playboy, which is fair considering he too plays into it for the media.Batman now has a pet bat, one that weighs a few tons and seats two. Thank Luscious Fox and his team for always inventing the latest gadgetry. The military outfitted tumbler can be seen with a new paint job, and the batpod looks as though it was made for Selina. An emp like device makes its way into the film and one new device that would be too much of a plot device to reveal in a review.The films audio is outstanding. Hans Zimmer's percussive elements really bring out the flare of the fire starting, the chanting inside the pit, echo and raise with such intensity the tempo increases, everything increases one might even pass out... and at times the pulse stops after the barbaric beats. Batmans theme is still epic, motivating, and triumphant. Banes voice was dubbed to be clearer, it's infectious, expect to walk out and perform a Bane impersonation or two, no worries it subsides. Cop ambiance is absorbed by the Bat taking off with its frighteningly loud entrance. Gun shots heat cold midnight air, rounds clang and rattle. Banes punches provide a impact and the audio is there to pick up the remains.All coolness aside, the film is truly about Bruce rising, about the people of Gotham rising, about the ascendancy needed to live in a world without the need for a constant savior. The movie is not a full throttle action film, but it has enough action to pass as one. When Bane and Batman meet, it is both disturbing and alarming. This is the end game for Nolan's trilogy and it literally goes out with a bang.Have fun, so many get caught up on `plot holes' they as might as well pigeon hole themselves in criticizing whatever new film is received with high regards. Nothing wrong with not enjoying this film, Batman is hardly in the film, it does throw a few hard to hit curve balls, Blake's all knowingness is a bit cheap.Enjoy the 70mm film, take in the audio, know what you are viewing is not completely all cgi. Those guys dangling on a plane, the football stadium rupture, Wall street rundown, not cgi. Say it was though, it would still make for an enjoyable film. My favorite album is fine as is whether it's analog vinyl or digital mp3. This is where Nolan succeeds, he made a good movie independent on the notion of explosions and effects are everything. There is a storm coming, be prepared to pop this into your dvd or bluray player and let it pass.",5,Nobody Cared Who I Was Until I Put on the Mask,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,6530,"['Christopher',

1418538,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004LWZWGA,DanD,"[9, 13]","Much has been said about THE DARK KNIGHT RISES; I won't pretend that anyone reading this is coming into it without some level of bias.  After all, films as popular and polarizing as Nolan's BATMAN trilogy tend to leave a serious impression, be it positive or negative.  And naturally, no one is ever going to be satisfied with the conclusion of such a series; we must contend ourselves with the fact that Nolan ends things HIS way, if not the way each of us would have wanted.That being said, here is an obligatory recap of the plot: it's been several years since Batman took the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes.  Batman is no more, and Bruce Wayne has become a social recluse.  Commissioner Gordon lives every day with the guilt; he's become a ""dinosaur,"" a relic of an older Gotham.  The city finally knows a sense of peace...enter Bane: a ruthless criminal mastermind who seizes on Gotham's false sense of security, taking the city hostage.  The action forces Batman out of retirement, to face not only an old evil, but the understanding that even our greatest heroes must ultimately meet their end.RISES is not on par with THE DARK KNIGHT; suffice it to say, DARK KNIGHT is a near-impossible film to top.  If we can get beyond that, we can examine and judge this film on its own merits.  While we lack a villain as truly engaging as the Joker, we get Tom Hardy's Bane: a truly hulking, menacing, unpredictable rogue, guided by his own sense of justice. With only his eyes and his physicality, Hardy pretty much out-acts everyone here, which is saying something when you're opposite Christian Bale, giving us his best Bruce Wayne to date.  We've also got Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine returning from earlier films (the latter deserves an Oscar nomination); making welcome, if not entirely fleshed-out additions are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew Modine.  Aside from Hardy, the true standout of the new arrivals is Anne Hathaway's Selina Kyle, a revisionist take on Catwoman (the name is never used); Hathaway steals every scene she's in, chewing her way through the material and oozing a sense of intrigue and sensuality.  While we're never really in doubt about where her heart lies, the character is still perfectly drawn; anyone who had doubts about how Nolan would incorporate Catwoman into his world can rest easy.THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is not without its flaws.  As with all of Chris Nolan's blockbusters, pacing is an issue, with time changes coming swiftly and with little notification; also, the final climactic scene is filmed in ""real time,"" but this is only possible due to many cuts (it's basically the longest two minutes ever), and as such doesn't come off as very realistic.  Realism was what made DARK KNIGHT so suspenseful; here, realism is in shorter supply, and viewers are forced to suspend their disbelief a little longer.  Similarly, the political ideology here (it's subtextual; don't worry, Nolan isn't browbeating anyone) is at odds with the film's predecessor, making for a slightly uneven transition.  Still, all of this aside, this is a fantastic film.  Nolan's Batman saga has its ups and downs, but he ends the trilogy with a (literal) bang.  Perhaps a tad overlong, and maybe a bit too epic (following its intimately personal predecessor), THE DARK KNIGHT RISES swings for the fences and, if it doesn't hit a home run, it's at least a standing triple.

Christian Bale gives, in my opinion, his best performance as the title hero, and while Tom Hardy's Bane may not have the unpredictability and chaotic nature seen by the Joker, he does a great job at coming off terrifying and menacing, all with a mask covering most of his face. The film doesn't quite meet the standard set so impossibly high by it's predecessor, but it doesn't need to. While it may not stand quite as tall on it's own, it concludes the trilogy in a spectacular and satisfying fashion. It's a remarkable feat to string together three movies so seamlessly, which only increases by respect and love of Nolan's films.The BD set itself has a lot of great extras, including a bunch of featurettes on the making of the film. I've always been a fan of Nolan's work because of his insistency to do as much as possible without CGI. The making of the plane scene is astounding and it's remarkable that only a few shots within that scene include the use of CGI. I also enjoyed getting an inside look into how Hans Zimmer created the score for the film.This is a great set if you're looking to finish your collection of the Dark Knight trilogy.

Director Christopher Nolan has conceived a brilliant trilogy that reimagined an American archetype and created an epic of monumental proportions.  After the debacle of the Joel Schumacher entries Nolan started from scratch and it feels as though he envisioned this as an open and shut trilogy.  Regardless, considering the film's huge appeal I imagine there will be a few thousand weighing in on its merits so I'll get to my point.  With the Nolan films and its TV and big screen predecessors there has always been opinions about certain qualities probably none more than the role of the Boy Wonder, Robin.  However, one constant there can be no argument about is the role of Alfred the Butler.  The casting of this role has been impeccable from the dapper Alan Napier to the urbane Michael Gough to the more working class Michael Caine.  Alfred has always served as a conduit for the audience as Bruce Wayne/Batman's loyal aide who assists uncomplainingly even if he has reservations about is employer's crimefighting activities.  What I like about Alfred in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is he gets to vent his frustrations after years of personal heartache.  It would be less than appropriate that Nolan did not give a smiling Alfred the last image to close out the trilogy.

The addition of Catwoman was okay but nothing really extraordinary. There was very little screen time for Bale which he probably wasn't happy about so this really came off more like 'Bane and Robin' rather than 'Batman and Robin'. The biggest problem though is the first act.It really drags and they could have lost about 10 or 15 minutes to tighten up the pace. Once the second act kicks in though, that's when the whole story becomes really engaging. It's awesome how Bane unintentionally 'recreates' Batman without knowing it. There is definitely some repetition of ideas from the first two which is probably why this is the last one but overall it is probably the darkest of the three. This is definitely better than the latest Spiderman.The criticism about this third chapter not fitting in with the whole series could not be further from the truth. This one really represents the bookending of the entire series. In the first chapter Batman does NOT exist until he escapes from the League of Shadows and the same is true when he escapes from the prison in this one. The great irony of both these movies is that the antagonist in each case actually creates Batman, the only person that can stop them. This is why the first fight with Bane is dismal. It is not because of a lack of physical conditioning, it is because this is not Batman fighting Bane but Bane fighting Bruce Wayne doing the best he can. So in reality it is the second chapter that does 'fit' because Batman already exists from start to finish.This is really the genius of Nolan in full effect. If you can overlook the flaws in directing you will be in a perfect position to see the brilliant story arc and also the spirit of Kane's creation represented accurately in all three films. In other words, Batman is not a suit or gadgets or cars and bikes etc., but a belief and mindset. When Alfred tries to explain this to Bruce, that he has not been 'Batman' for years, it does not register. No amount of physical training or gadgetry would give him the mindset of the Batman.If you keep this in perspective that Batman is an internal mindset when watching all 3 chapters and not about discrepancies between page and screen that are really the external details, you can see that the essence of Batman has been presented here perfectly.",4,Very good but the first two are both better.,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,2440,"['4', 'Stars', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'definitely', 'had', 'problems', 'Bane', 'voice', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'make', 'out', 'most', 'time', 'addition', 'Catwoman', 'was', 'okay', 'nothing', 'really', 'extraordinary', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'Bale', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'so', 'really', 'came', 'off', 'more', ""'Bane"", 'Robin', 'rather', ""'Batman"", 'Robin', 'biggest', 'problem', 'though', 'first', 'act.It', 'really', 'drags', 'could', 'have', 'lost', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'tighten', 'up', 'pace', 'second', 'act', 'kicks', 'though', 'when', 'whole', 'story', 'really', 'engaging', 'awesome', 'how', 'Bane', 'unintentionally', 'Batman', 'knowing', 'definitely', 'repetition', 'ideas', 'first', 'two', 'probably', 'why', 'last', 'one', 'overall', 'probably', 'darkest', 'three', 'definitely', 'better', 'latest', 'Spiderman.The', 'criticism', 'third', 'chapter', 'not', 'fitting', 'whole', 'series', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'one', 'really', 'bookending', 'entire', 'series', 'first', 'chapter', 'Batman', 'NOT', 'exist', 'League', 'Shadows', 'same', 'true', 'when', 'prison', 'one', 'great', 'irony', 'movies', 'antagonist', 'case', 'actually', 'Batman', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'stop', 'why', 'first', 'fight', 'Bane', 'dismal', 'not', 'lack', 'physical', 'conditioning', 'not', 'Batman', 'fighting', 'Bane', 'Bane', 'fighting', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'So', 'reality', 'second', 'chapter', ""'fit"", 'Batman', 'already', 'start', 'finish.This', 'really', 'genius', 'Nolan', 'full', 'effect', 'can', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'directing', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'position', 'see', 'brilliant', 'story', 'arc', 'also', 'spirit', 'Kane', 'creation', 'represented', 'accurately', 'three', 'films', 'other', 'words', 'Batman', 'not', 'suit', 'gadgets', 'cars', 'bikes', 'etc.', 'belief', 'mindset', 'When', 'Alfred', 'explain', 'Bruce', 'not', 'been', ""'Batman"", 'years', 'not', 'register', 'amount', 'physical', 'training', 'gadgetry', 'would', 'give', 'mindset', 'Batman.If', 'keep', 'perspective', 'Batman', 'internal', 'mindset', 'when', 'watching', '3', 'chapters', 'not', 'discrepancies', 'page', 'screen', 'are', 'really', 'external', 'details', 'can', 'see', 'essence', 'Batman', 'been', 'presented', 'here', 'perfectly']",N/A

And The Dark Knight Rises didn't disappoint. The conclusion to the trilogy is fitting for the franchise, for Batman, and for Bruce Wayne (though I have read rumors that Nolan might come back for another film in the series or maybe a Batman/Superman film - hope some of this is true!).The film starts with a frail Bruce Wayne having pretty much retired and living a private life eight years after he eliminated the Joker. The peaceful Gotham City where police officers feel they will soon be ""chasing overdue library books"" is rocked by a series of events orchestrated by the ferocious and calculating villain, Bane.The pace of this film is slightly slower (and heavier) compared to the previous two films, partly because there are a lot more characters in this film, and Nolan being the master storyteller that he is, gives each character enough time in the film. It could seem a bit lengthy at 3 hours of thereabout because of this. Lucius Fox and Alfred return in their usual roles of being Batman's brains and soul respectively. Michael Caine's performance as Alfred is simply remarkable even though his screen time is somewhat limited in the film. Christian Bale, as usual, has done a great job portraying the battles within Bruce Wayne - overcoming his hears and rising from being as good as dead to come back to save his beloved city. His character comes a full circle from the first film as Thomas Wayne's words ""why do we fall down Bruce"" echo through this film and Bruce seemingly understands their meaning here as he prepares to pick himself up and ""rise"".New characters added a refreshing touch to the series. Anne Hathaway is brilliant in her role as Selina Kyle. She lightens up the serious macho overdose of the film with her flair and flamboyant ways. Bane, with links to the League of Shadows, brings a dark element unlike any Gotham has witnessed before. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays John (Robin) Blake perhaps a younger version of Jim Gordon. He seems to be set to take over the reins from Commissioner Gordon, but eventually chooses to stay free of the shackles imposed by structure and protocols by the GCPD. Marion Cotillard (I thought she was brilliant in Inception) plays a convincing partner and love interest of Bruce Wayne.The conclusion is definitely a lot heavier in terms of content and pace compared to the previous two films. This film requires focused attention to the dialogue and sequence of events, previous 2 films seem somewhat lighter compared to this one. The fact that Bane's voice was muffled with his mask doesn't help in this regard, it only increases the level of focus one needs to have which watching the film. In addition, the film has more characters with their place in the film. Chris Nolan has spent a fair amount of time with each character to fully bring out their roles and let the audiences savor the nuances of their personalities, inner conflicts, and goals. I personally think the editing room could have shaved off a good 15 to 20 minutes from the film, but this is Nolan's signature style of storytelling. Also some scenes make Batman seem too human, like the street fight scene with Bane towards the end. Batman is a superhero and it feels somewhat strange to see him battle his enemy bare hands in the middle of a street-fight. That being said, there are plenty of new toys in his arsenal and the Bat, in particular, is awesome!Yes, the performance of Heath Ledger and the compelling storytelling of The Dark Knight are hard to match, but TDKR is an appropriate and epic conclusion to what I think is one of the best series of super-hero films made to date.",5,Epic conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,3734,"['Having', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'previous', 'two', 'Batman', 'films', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'conclusion', 'trilogy', 'fitting', 'franchise', 'Batman', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'have', 'read', 'rumors', 'Nolan', 'might', 'come', 'back', 'film', 'series', 'maybe', 'Batman/Superman', 'film', 'hope', 'true', '.The', 'film', 'frail', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'having', 'pretty', 'much', 'retired', 'living', 'private', 'life', 'eight', 'years', 'eliminated', 'Joker', 'peaceful', 'Gotham', 'City', 'where', 'police', 'officers', 'feel', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'chasing', 'overdue', 'library', 'books', 'rocked', 'series', 'events', 'orchestrated', 'ferocious', 'calculating', 'villain', 'Bane.The', 'pace', 'film', 'slightly', 'slower', 'heavier', 'compared', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'partly', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'characters', 'film', 'Nolan', 'being', 'master', 'storyteller', 'character', 'enough', 'time', 'film', 'could', 'seem', 'bit', 'lengthy', '3', 'hours', 'thereabout', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'Alfred', 'return', 'usual', 'roles', 'being', 'Batman', 'brains', 'soul', 'respectively', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'performance', 'Alfred', 'simply', 'remarkable', 'even', 'screen', 'time', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'film', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'usual', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'battles', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'overcoming', 'hears', 'rising', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'dead', 'come', 'back', 'save', 'beloved', 'city', 'character', 'full', 'circle', 'first', 'film', 'Thomas', 'Wayne', 'words', 'why', 'do', 'fall', 'down', 'Bruce', 'echo', 'film', 'Bruce', 'seemingly', 'meaning', 'here', 'pick', 'up', 'rise', '.New', 'characters', 'added', 'refreshing', 'touch', 'series', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'up', 'serious', 'macho', 'overdose', 'film', 'flair', 'flamboyant', 'ways', 'Bane', 'links', 'League', 'Shadows', 'dark', 'element', 'Gotham', 'witnessed', 'before', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'John', 'Robin', 'Blake', 'perhaps', 'younger', 'version', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'be', 'set', 'take', 'over', 'reins', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'eventually', 'stay', 'free', 'shackles', 'imposed', 'structure', 'protocols', 'GCPD', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Inception', 'convincing', 'partner', 'love', 'interest', 'Bruce', 'Wayne.The', 'conclusion', 'definitely', 'lot', 'heavier', 'terms', 'content', 'pace', 'compared', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'film', 'focused', 'attention', 'dialogue', 'sequence', 'events', 'previous', '2', 'films', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'lighter', 'compared', 'one', 'fact', 'Bane', 'voice', 'was', 'muffled', 'mask', ""n't"", 'help', 'regard', 'only', 'level', 'focus', 'one', 'have', 'watching', 'film', 'addition', 'film', 'more', 'characters', 'place', 'film', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'spent', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'character', 'fully', 'bring', 'out', 'roles', 'let', 'audiences', 'savor', 'nuances', 'personalities', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'goals', 'personally', 'think', 'editing', 'room', 'could', 'have', 'shaved', 'off', 'good', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'Nolan', 'signature', 'style', 'storytelling', 'Also', 'scenes', 'make', 'Batman', 'seem', 'too', 'human', 'street', 'fight', 'scene', 'Bane', 'end', 'Batman', 'superhero', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'see', 'battle', 'enemy', 'bare', 'middle', 'street-fight', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'plenty', 'new', 'toys', 'arsenal', 'Bat', 'particular', 'awesome', 'Yes', 'performance', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'compelling', 'storytelling', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'are', 'hard', 'match', 'TDKR', 'appropriate', 'epic', 'conclusion', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'super-hero', 'films', 'made', 'date']",N/A
1418555,A3GE4NWFDCATHG,B004LWZWGA,frost822712,"[4, 6]","The final film in Christopher Nolan's Batman vision, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, is a worthy conclusion.Perhaps more than the Batman mythology I was fascinated by how current-day real-life themes made their way into this movie. The most prescient was that of the 99% vs. the 1%, Wall Street vs. Main Street, rich vs. the poor, embodied by Selina Kyle vs. Bruce Wayne/Batman and Bane's attack on the stock exchange.Anne Hathaway again stole the show, this time with her portrayal of Catwoman (though that name is never used in the film), and Nolan decided to go back to her roots as a ""cat-burglar"" for his rendition of the character.Bane, totally mangled in BATMAN AND ROBIN, this time is believable, terrifying, and the perfect villain. The sequence that leads to and includes his and Batman's first fight was thrilling; easily the best fight in all three films.Another real-life theme is that of the search for a clean, realistic, renewable energy source in order to sustain life with the obvious paradox being that such an energy source can also lead to great destruction. On this end, the finale to the film requires a suspension of disbelief (maybe beyond all belief) and may have been drawn out about a half hour-plus too long.As is invevitable in such an epic as Batman (especially with Nolan's final two installments earnings over $1 billion in box office receipts worldwide) we movie fans are going to rate it among the all-time great trilogies. As I think about some the classic conclusions--RETURN OF THE JEDI, RETURN OF THE KING, THE GODFATHER: PART III, ALIEN III, THE LAST CRUSADE, BACK TO THE FUTURE: PART III and MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS, among others--I put it well ahead of Revolutions, Back to the Future III, and Alien III, but not quite as satisfying as Jedi, Godfather, Crusade, or LOTR.Which begs the question as to why I'd give it 5-stars if it didn't quite meet the all-time great conclusions. And I suppose the answer is that I thought the character arc ended as I would have desired for Bruce Wayne/Batman (with the hint of a successor); the villains (Bane and Catwoman) were potrayed uniquely and interwoven with real-life themes in a very believable and disturbing way; the special-effects were top notch; and Hans Zimmer did his usual outstanding work as composer.The bottom line is that if you are prepared for a movie that goes on a touch too long (by about thirty minutes or so) but includes top-notch special effects, music, acting, and storyline within the Batman mythology, this is a must-own movie in your library.",5,A Worthy Conclusion,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,2541,"['final', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'vision', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'RISES', 'worthy', 'conclusion.Perhaps', 'more', 'Batman', 'mythology', 'was', 'fascinated', 'how', 'current-day', 'real-life', 'themes', 'made', 'way', 'movie', 'most', 'prescient', 'was', '99', '%', '1', '%', 'Wall', 'Street', 'vs.', 'Main', 'Street', 'rich', 'poor', 'embodied', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'Bane', 'attack', 'stock', 'exchange.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'again', 'stole', 'show', 'time', 'portrayal', 'Catwoman', 'name', 'never', 'used', 'film', 'Nolan', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'roots', 'cat-burglar', 'rendition', 'character.Bane', 'totally', 'mangled', 'BATMAN', 'AND', 'ROBIN', 'time', 'believable', 'terrifying', 'perfect', 'villain', 'sequence', 'Batman', 'first', 'fight', 'was', 'thrilling', 'easily', 'best', 'fight', 'three', 'films.Another', 'real-life', 'theme', 'search', 'clean', 'realistic', 'renewable', 'energy', 'source', 'order', 'sustain', 'life', 'obvious', 'paradox', 'being', 'energy', 'source', 'can', 'also', 'lead', 'great', 'destruction', 'end', 'finale', 'film', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'maybe', 'belief', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'out', 'half', 'hour-plus', 'too', 'long.As', 'invevitable', 'such', 'epic', 'Batman', 'especially', 'Nolan', 'final', 'two', 'installments', 'earnings', '1', 'billion', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'worldwide', 'movie', 'fans', 'are', 'going', 'rate', 'all-time', 'great', 'trilogies', 'think', 'classic', 'conclusions', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'JEDI', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'KING', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'III', 'ALIEN', 'III', 'THE', 'LAST', 'CRUSADE', 'BACK', 'TO', 'THE', 'FUTURE', 'PART', 'III', 'MATRIX', 'REVOLUTIONS', 'others', 'put', 'well', 'ahead', 'Revolutions', 'Back', 'Future', 'III', 'Alien', 'III', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'satisfying', 'Jedi', 'Godfather', 'Crusade', 'LOTR.Which', 'question', 'why', ""'d"", 'give', '5-stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'meet', 'all-time', 'great', 'conclusions', 'suppose', 'answer', 'thought', 'character', 'arc', 'ended', 'would', 'have', 'desired', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'hint', 'successor', 'villains', 'Bane', 'Catwoman', 'were', 'potrayed', 'uniquely', 'interwoven', 'real-life', 'themes', 'very', 'believable', 'disturbing', 'way', 'special-effects', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'did', 'usual', 'outstanding', 'work', 'composer.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'prepared', 'movie', 'touch', 'too', 'long', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'top-notch', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'acting', 'storyline', 'Batman', 'mythology', 'must-own', 'movie', 'library']",N/A

I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but it turned out to be quite compelling, much more than I expected, though no where in the league of the terrifyingly good performances previously with the Joker (Ledger), which would be hard to beat.  Still, this movie is wonderfully filmed, the special effects are spectacular, and the action is heart-pounding.  As ever, we are also introduced to more of Batman's ""toys,"" but the heart of the movie remains his dark soul and his sense of injustice that needs to be righted...even if he starts off lost at the beginning of this edition.Some spoilers:Batman has disappeared, blamed for the death of the ""hero,"" Harvey Dent.  Gotham used this death to change laws to lock up the worst criminals in Gotham, making the city safe enough that Batman no longer seems to even be needed.  Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, locked away in his mansion, uncaring of what his foundation has gotten up to, and has lost his edge as he lost his rage that actually fueled his being Batman.  He seems washed up, beaten up, and uncaring.  A bad guy named Bane comes to town and first takes over the stock market, then the city with the threat of a bomb, all seemingly in the name of the people fighting against the wealthy of Gotham (very 99% versus the 1%).  Of course, this is really a lie.  Bane and his crew have other agendas in mind than the poor versus the rich.  As a result, Batman comes out of retirement but still seems lost and not up to his usual fighting skills.  Can he rediscover the inner strength and rage for justice that made him such a powerful figure of the night?  And what does this have to do with the League of Darkness that Batman had long thought defeated?In many ways, Bane represents Batman as he used to be--filled with a strength born of darkness--and Bruce Wayne must undergo his own journey out of the Pit in order to be able to defeat him.  Wayne says he is unafraid of death, but seems unwilling to embrace life either.  His death wish has played out in previous movies and now he must find another reason to go on.  I really enjoyed the subtext of this in the movie.  As well as Alfred's struggle to save him and his urging him to find something to live for.But the best bits in the movie I think have to do with Catwomen, wonderfully played by Hathaway, and I love how her goggles flipped up to look like little cat's ears.  There is, as ever, the push and pull of attraction between her and Batman that we saw even in the original tv show.The movie ends with a possible lead into another movie.  I say...go for it!

The film lasts around 2 1/2 long hours but is packed with action and a continuing storyline that basically stays on line for the most part.  The special effects are fine and the cast is huge.Without summarizing the plot, we meet a physically and emotionally broken Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Christian Bale who despite his apparent physical limitations still maintains a hunky buff body - that is, the little bit that we see of him in this incarnation), grieving over his lost love form the previous episode, and disappearing form the public spotlight.  Even his trusty allies Alfred (Michael Caine) and Fox (Morgan Freeman) fear for his welfare.  But trouble arrives in the personage of Bane (Tom Hardy, completely unrecognizable in a funky mask) who is out to destroy all Gotham policemen and Batman. The good guys are Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and officer Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who stay in the fray despite the appearance of the vicious Selina (Anne Hathaway, who practically steals the show) and her associate Jen (Juno Temple). The supposed savior of the mess Wayne that has allowed to disintegrate as his foundation is a society dame named Miranda (Marion Cotillard), but of course she has other plans. The plan to destroy Gotham is planned by Bane and his associates and the rest is the long long long finale.The cast includes many bit parts for some fine actors such as Matthew Modine, Alon Aboutboul, Ben Mendelsohn , Daniel Sunjata, Nestor Carbonell, William Devane, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, Tom Conti, and Desmond Harrington among MANY  others.  The writing is fairly well done and does leave the end as either a farewell or a jumping off for yet another installment.  Entertaining but a bit long and oblique.

1418560,A3G7W5O2OX8MTC,B004LWZWGA,"Grey ""b09boy""","[33, 46]","I wanted to like this movie.  Truly, I did.  With the production values and people behind it, everything on paper said this movie should be an absolute joy.  And I suppose if you ignore the previous films, and franchise as a whole, turn your mind off, and just watch these pretty scenes cut together then it can be enjoyed just fine.  Delve any deeper, however, and you might find a story that does not mesh with the series, the franchise, or reality, and one that becomes heavy-handed in its drama.  Warning, this review does contain spoilers.The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after The Dark Knight, and Batman hasn't shown his face since the climactic events of that movie.  Wait, what?  The previous movie establishes a continued need for Batman, of how this is supposed to be a hero that can accomplish things a normal man cannot, yet directly after establishing that and the credits roll we are expected to believe Bruce Wayne hung up his cowl and sat in his room mourning for eight years...when the death of someone close to him is what set him off to begin with.  The idea of a Batman just giving up is...unfathomable.  Yet that is the basis this film hinges uponSo we get into 45 minutes of slogging through this plotline, of Bruce Wayne being a crippled hermit slowly brought out of retirement by a thief linked to a greater plot.  45 minutes before we see anything of the Batman.  We get things like the Harvey Dent Act, in which criminals are able to be held indefinitely without parole.  We get a character knowing the connection between Bruce and Batman...all due to the pain he recognized in Bruce's eyes over the loss of his parents.  We get Alfred telling us in exacting detail the ending of the movie two hours before the ending of the movie.  We get the great dossier of Bane, of how he escaped from a hellish pit to be trained by Ra's al Ghul, a person whose entire organization was a massive secret yet somehow now has a former members listing.  Then there's a great stock exchange robbery, where clearly illegal transfers are somehow allowed to stand, followed by one of the poorest moments of editing I've ever seen, where a daytime chase scene switches very suddenly to night as finally, dun dun dun! the Batman makes his anticipated appearance......and fails to do anything impressive.  Remember in Batman Begins, the sequence of taking out Falcone's men one by one?  Or crashing in on the Scarecrow?  Remember in The Dark Knight how he managed to smuggle a money launderer our of Hong Kong?  Or managed to subdue an entire SWAT team before they mistakenly killed a bunch of hostages while taking out numerous armed criminals?  Or flipping the semi truck?  There's none of that here.  Batman's grand entrance consists of a bunch of people getting all excited watching a guy ride a motorcycle.  Oh sure he punches a guy or two and o hai!  Flying Bat vehicle.  But none of this accomplishes anything.  These things are just there to be there without any of the jaw-dropping set pieces.  But wait, Batman's not done yet!  He also...punches a bunch of guys.  Lots and lots of guys, in an open space, who don't realize they have guns, or how to attack more than one at a time.  Exciting.  And how about that fantastic fight midway through the film against Bane, where Batman turns into a full out brawler who suddenly forgot about all the equipment he's shown off the past two films.And this is supposed to be the better half of the film.From there the plot is finally unveiled to us and everyone goes full retard.  See, the League of Shadows wants to get revenge on Bruce Wayne for his destruction of their base and killing of Ra's, as well as to fulfill Ra's legacy to cripple Gotham.  To do so they do things such as seduce and comfort Bruce during his time of need and take months to set off an explosive which could wipe out Gotham instead of blowing the thing and being done with it.  To stop this nefarious plot the police send their entire force into a sewer system where they suspect Bane is hidden, with predictable results.  Then, to complete his embarrassment of the police, Bane reads a letter from Commissioner Gordon detailing the truth about Harvey Dent and Gordon's lie about Batman's supposed murder of him...and people just believe Bane.  But do the trapped police forces die?  Nah, of course not.  Over the following months Bane's forces keep them well-fed, despite all intention to just blow the city up.  Do I really need to explain the problems with all this?  So the film takes a turn and focuses on good cop Blake and his stay in a broken city, trying to restore order without any success to speak of.  His story is a long wait for no payoff.  Meanwhile, we spend another 45 minutes of film without any Batman where he must slowly build himself to recover and don the cowl.  Again.  For the second time in this film alone.Then when Batman makes his (second) triumphant return?  He appears back in the city.  Which is locked down under threat of extreme violence.  From the other side of the world.  When he has no money or equipment.  With no explanation.  There's big, epic fights, (obvious) plot twists (Talia al Ghul?! no wai) and a great, climactic battle in which weaponless cops (apparently all lost in the sewers)take on vastly superior numbers of criminals armed with automatic weapons in a gigantic...fist brawl?  In which Bane's plot is resolved out of nowhere.  In which the true villain dies in terribly acted fashion moments after being formally introduced. And in which Batman can escape a nuclear blast in five seconds and Gotham has never heard the words ""nuclear fallout"" used together.But it's ok.  In the end it all works out.  Bruce runs away with Catwoman, having given up the cowl for good (ironically when the city might need Batman most, considering the state of chaos it happens to be in and all the escaped criminals which happen to be free, not to mention repealed Harvey Dent Act releasing all mobsters back into the world and thus negating everything he accomplished in the first two films) and nobody recognizes the famous billionaire playboy who drunkenly burned down his home, lost all his money and mysteriously died at the same time as Batman.  Meanwhile good cop Blake (real name: Robin) takes on the cowl...without any of the training.  After having not accomplished a single thing of note during the entirety of this nearly three hour epic film.When everything's said and done, this does not feel like a part of anything.  It uses familiar names and faces, but they don't line up with anything we've ever known, they don't act in any logical manner, the film follows no rules of the series or reality, and it follows none of the established themes.  It's as if the writer never read the comics or understood the happenings of the previous film.  Remember that chilling moment when Joker said, ""I think you and I are destined to do this forever,"" and you just had to wonder when he might escape and who the next villain might be to show their face?  There was an understanding there about the characters and franchise which went completely unrecognized in this story and the movie collapses in on itself because of it.",2,The Dark Knight

My then-15-year-old daughter went to see it with her friends. She saw parts of ""The Dark Knight"" and never saw ""Batman Begins"", so I'm sure many parts didn't make sense in this movie. Yet, she still loved it and thought it was excellent.The Dark Knight was my favorite of the first two, but I think this HAS to be the best one. What a way to end it. Definitely the best of the three movies.I don't want to rehash the story, but let it be known that Batman does NOT make a lot of showing in this movie. It's more of Bruce Wayne and his struggles as a ""retired"" superhero. But when Bruce dons the Caped Crusader's costume, the excitement is still there. This isn't just about Batman. It's about a city and it's people, as well as many of the characters we know and love, that has lived under a lie for 8 years. A lie that was meant to help the city that eventually comes back to haunt it and the people who perpetuated that lie. Old friends and nemesis are revealed and come full circle to bring closure to the trilogy. And new characters are revealed that leave possibilities for new story lines for possible future movies. Just not sure if Mr. Nolan would be involved. But, this final movie of the trilogy does SO much justice for the entire Batman franchise.Mr. Nolan must be commended on an awesome job well done. He pulled Batman out of the steaming pile of junk that Joel Schumacher created (never saw Batman and Robin when it came out and just last year, I TRIED to watch it and had to stop after the first 15 minutes. Just plain awful) and saved him.

1418566,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B004LWZWGA,Jason Bean,"[168, 232]","As someone of the unpopular minority who didn't like Christopher Nolan's previous Batman film 'The Dark Knight' (but really liked 'Batman Begins') I find 'The Dark Knight Rises' a pleasant surprise. It carries a lot of the elements of the first two films, especially TDK's darker tone but manages to off-set it's self-seriousness with a strong story, terrific action-scenes and characters I wanted to root for!The story of 'The Dark Knight Rises' takes place eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight' Gotham Ciy is seemingly crime free and the Batman hasn't been seen since (still wanted as a fugitive after the events of TDK). In steps Bane: a super-strong, methodical terrorist leader intent on destroying Gotham and ends up forcing Batman/Bruce Wayne out of retirement. There's a lot of elements at work in this dynamic story (taking obvious influences from the Batman comics Knightfall, No Man's Land and Dark Knight Returns) and the movie's almost 3-hour length is felt, but Nolan's strong directing and script manage to bring it all together and he keeps things moving at a brisk pace.As much as I like the story in 'The Dark Knight Rises' it's the characters I found myself most vested in. Regular greats Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return as Jim Gordan and Lucius Fox, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays honest cop John Blake and Anne Hathaway the thief Selina Kyle (each giving the film both an every-person to follow and moments of comic-relief). Marion Cotillard gives protagonist Bruce Wayne a business partner as well as a love-interest in Miranda Tate. Tom Hardy doesn't make Bane as memorable as Heath Ledger's Joker (no one could) but he's an imposing presence and a terrific foil to Batman in terms of strength and ingenuity.All the characters in 'The Dark Knight Rises' have a chance to shine, especially in their personal journey's and relationships but the one holding it all together is Bruce Wayne/Batman himself. It's fun seeing Batman  drive through the dark in the Bat-Pod, stealthily take down criminals from ceilings and dodge gun-fire between muzzle-flashes. Watching a middle-aged and physically impaired Bruce Wayne build himself back up (especially after a nasty beat-down from Bane) is almost as awesome as watching him become Batman for the first time! Christian Bale's amazing performance sells this character in every scene and I especially liked how his relationship with his Butler Alfred played out (an equally compelling Michael Caine with much more screen time). This is the hero I wanted in the first two films!While the direction is sharp and the story exciting, 'The Dark Knight Rises' does have some obvious faults. Hans Zimmer's musical-score is strong as ever but the film's sound kept drowning-out character's dialogue, even during some key moments; Bane's voice-box really didn't help matters either. Nolan's usual self-seriousness is also most apparent in this film, and while the dialogue is less artificial this time around (with much more humor) the movie still got a bit heavy-handed.Even with it's short-comings 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an original and exciting superhero epic. Most fans will probably still favor 'The Dark Knight' as the best of Nolan's trilogy but I'm just glad TDKR is such a great conclusion.",5,A unique and engaging superhero epic,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,3278,"['someone', 'unpopular', 'minority', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'previous', 'Batman', 'film', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'really', 'liked', ""'Batman"", 'Begins', 'find', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'lot', 'elements', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'especially', 'TDK', 'darker', 'tone', 'off-set', 'self-seriousness', 'strong', 'story', 'terrific', 'action-scenes', 'characters', 'wanted', 'root', 'story', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'place', 'eight', 'years', 'events', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Gotham', 'Ciy', 'seemingly', 'crime', 'free', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'still', 'wanted', 'fugitive', 'events', 'TDK', 'steps', 'Bane', 'super-strong', 'methodical', 'terrorist', 'leader', 'intent', 'destroying', 'Gotham', 'up', 'forcing', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'retirement', 'lot', 'elements', 'work', 'dynamic', 'story', 'taking', 'obvious', 'influences', 'Batman', 'comics', 'Knightfall', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'movie', 'almost', '3-hour', 'length', 'felt', 'Nolan', 'strong', 'directing', 'script', 'manage', 'bring', 'together', 'things', 'moving', 'brisk', 'pace.As', 'much', 'like', 'story', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'characters', 'found', 'most', 'vested', 'Regular', 'greats', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'return', 'Jim', 'Gordan', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'honest', 'cop', 'John', 'Blake', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'thief', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'giving', 'film', 'every-person', 'follow', 'moments', 'comic-relief', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'protagonist', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'business', 'partner', 'as', 'well', 'love-interest', 'Miranda', 'Tate', 'Tom', 'Hardy', ""n't"", 'make', 'Bane', 'as', 'memorable', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'one', 'could', 'imposing', 'presence', 'terrific', 'foil', 'Batman', 'terms', 'strength', 'ingenuity.All', 'characters', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'have', 'chance', 'shine', 'especially', 'personal', 'journey', 'relationships', 'one', 'holding', 'together', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Batman', 'drive', 'dark', 'Bat-Pod', 'stealthily', 'take', 'down', 'criminals', 'ceilings', 'dodge', 'gun-fire', 'muzzle-flashes', 'Watching', 'middle-aged', 'physically', 'impaired', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'build', 'back', 'especially', 'nasty', 'beat-down', 'Bane', 'almost', 'as', 'awesome', 'watching', 'become', 'Batman', 'first', 'time', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'amazing', 'performance', 'character', 'scene', 'especially', 'liked', 'how', 'relationship', 'Butler', 'Alfred', 'played', 'out', 'equally', 'compelling', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'much', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'hero', 'wanted', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'direction', 'sharp', 'story', 'exciting', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'have', 'obvious', 'faults', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'musical-score', 'strong', 'ever', 'film', 'sound', 'kept', 'drowning-out', 'character', 'dialogue', 'even', 'key', 'moments', 'Bane', 'voice-box', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'Nolan', 'usual', 'self-seriousness', 'also', 'most', 'apparent', 'film', 'dialogue', 'less', 'artificial', 'time', 'much', 'more', 'humor', 'movie', 'still', 'got', 'bit', 'heavy-handed.Even', 'short-comings', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'original', 'exciting', 'superhero', 'epic', 'Most', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'still', 'favor', ""'The"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'best', 'Nolan', 'trilogy', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'TDKR', 'such', 'great', 'conclusion']",N/A

It's fair to say that I'm a fan, And against that backdrop, I'd say that I find particular incarnation of Batman as something of a disappointment.Batman is a different kind of superhero.  He's the caped crusader, whose abilities rest not in super powers but on cunning and intellect. Sure, he has some gadgets.  But he's not Superman.  He's a real human being whose biggest advantage is his brain.  In the same way that James Bond is supposed to be cool, Batman is supposed to be stealthy and smart.Without Heath Ledger to add excitement to the script, I find Christian Bale kind of dull.  He tries to be mysterious and cool but can't quite pull it off.  For instance, there is that absurd guttural voice he uses, like some kind of scary Muppet.  And then there is the fact, if I'm honest, that Christian Bale just doesn't strike me as a particularly smart Batman.  You almost cringe watching him.And it's not just Bale.  It's the way the whole movie is cast.  Bane is supposed to be the heavy in the movie but the character is confused.  They give him this British accent, to make him sophisticated, and he spouts off a lot of philosophic stuff.

For Christ's sake, if Bruce Wayne goes into hiding from the entire world we would expect the person who eventually lures him out to be much meaner than Bane who is nothing but a huge hunk of lumber with the strength of 10 Hulk Hogans.

Batman(Christian Bale) and Catwoman(Anne Hathaway) have to stop Bane(Tom Hardy) from destroying Gotham City with a nuclear weapon. Batman, Jim Gordon and Gotham City are still suffering from the damage The Joker caused in The Dark Knight(2008). The tone of The Dark Knight Rises is dark and depressing, but the pacing is very fast. The film borrows story material from the Knightfall comic book. Hans Zimmer composed a loud, tribal, energetic music score for the film. The action scenes are thrilling. Batman uses an aircraft called ""The Bat"". People complained about Bane's ""garbled, Sean Connery voice"".The terrorist attack at the football game felt like Two Minute Warning(1976) or Black Sunday(1977). There's a sight gag with a football player turning his head to see a giant hole in the stadium. There was the real life, tragic, midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in the Summer of 2012. Several people were killed and dozens more were injured by a gunman. These innocent people were just trying to watch a Batman movie. Officer Blake is one of the more heroic and humane characters in the story. Anne Hathaway was very good as Catwoman. In the film, she's simply called ""Selina Kyle"".

1418584,A1ZXYVYPOEDGTV,B004LWZWGA,Jus B. Cuz,"[1, 1]","To conclude the Dark Knight trilogy with ""The Dark Knight Rises"", Chris Nolan has offered us a perfectly gritty view of who Batman has become. Through the previous two films, Christian Bale/Bruce Wayne, has become overwhelmingly isolated and secluded. He has chosen to live in a self-imposed sheltered life behind mansion walls. The Batman, his alter-ego, which once was a symbol, has become his demon. Michael Caine/Alfred, nails the role of Bruce's trusted confidant and friend to perfection. Over the years between ""The Dark Knight"" until now, he has played the role of father figure to Bruce, in attempts to have Bruce regain a ""normal"" life. To no avail. Through the entirety of the three films, the cast of incredibly fine actors have found their marks on their respective roles. Fully 3 dimensional and completely believable.As the years have worn on both men, Batman and Bruce, the physical toll on Bruce's body has been tremendous. The years have taken a much more staid affect on his emotional stability. Not to mention the lack of cognizance as to Wayne Enterprises functionality any longer. Bruce has simply fallen out of touch with reality. Feeling that the Batman is no longer needed or wanted, Bruce is lost. Bale portrays both Wayne and Batman as brooding men. A bit too far, but the Dark Knight, as told in the Frank Miller stories, is a confident, stoic and sometimes apathetic man. Although Bruce has had a love and lost her, he knows he cannot afford to get to close again. Much like any superhero. Said superhero or anti-hero, must remain hyper-vigilant to protect the love interest from any manner of horrors from the villainous activities they fight. Batman is doomed to be lonely and accept his fate. That is until Anne Hathaway/Selina/Catwoman makes her appearance!Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is a sleek, sharp minded and sexy role. Unlike any previous attempts. Hathaway comes off as if she is a bit modest, but knows exactly what she wants. And how to get it. The kick-ass way! She is glamorous in her black leather. A cutting edge Catwoman who isn't sure which side of the line to walk. Jumping from side to side at whim. Scowling her prey with night-vision glasses, (doubles for Cat ears), she moves with stealth. I find it greatly appealing that Hathaway's Catwoman is a strong female character. Strong-willed but unsure of herself. She has techniques of fighting skills that match Batman, mechanics of martial arts and the grace of a ballet dancer. A true match for Bruce, Batman/Catwoman. Now that's a dynamic duo! As the film progresses, Batman and Bruce both begin to see Selina/Catwoman as an interesting female with a seductive beauty. Or just a jewel thief?A definite plus, is the introduction of the ""Bat."" The newest toy in Batman's arsenal. A flying hover-type craft. One that can also move through the streets and between buildings with ease. With Batman in the air now, Catwoman on the ""Bat-Pod"" in the streets, they both pursue the ""Tumbler's"". The very Tumblers that saved the day in the ""Dark Knight"", Bane has captured them for his own means of destruction. There are some very cool CG scenes with ALL of Batman's vehicles in use. A very compelling notion to ponder here, just how deadly Batman's arsenal really is when it is used against him and Gotham City! Batman has upped the ante with the new ""Bat"" and the havoc that it and the Tumbler's make, is truly awesome! Culminating in the last few minutes of the film!Chris Nolan has given some freedoms to the actors that have built their roles over the previous films. The character arcs are developed and pulled from the Frank Miller story, ""Year One"" and others. Done with honor! Of course, with the help of CG, only so much breadth can be splashed on the screen. In the comics, Bane is a hulking character. He is one of the only foes that has actually beaten Batman. In the comics, graphic novels or animated series, Bane is an enormous, raging freak. About twice the size of Batman and capable of super-human feats of strength. Tom Hardy was a good pick for the role of Bane. As he tries to evince Batman and the citizens of Gotham, his adamancy of fulfilling Ras' Al Guhl's.destiny, the annihilation of Gotham City.Hardy's acting was more out of ""eye expressions."" Wearing that tightly fitted mask for the film, he relied on only eye movements to visually express his mouthed words. Quite inventive and talented. Difficult yet proficient. For the viewer who is not familiar with the Bane character, Tom Hardy made him fairly plausible, even if his physical stature completely missed the comic version. Whenever Bane was on-screen, the mood was palpable. His voice through the mask was taunting the viewers and those he intended to terrorize. Or kill. Hans Zimmer's scores throughout all three films are some of the best I've ever heard! The Bane score was dark and seething with impending doom. As the inevitable fight scenes with Batman approached, the tension would build under the musical score, heightening the volume of physical and emotional pressure. Even if Hardy was unable to display the physical comic sight of Bane, he put such raw power into every punch his fists could pound. Utilizing camera trickery, certain size differentials were used to desirous effects. All-in-all, the Bane character was rather convincing. Wearing various military gear and clothing he acquired from years on the prowl. Scavenging whatever Bane was able to, kept any necessary items for later purposes. The character arc for Bane was right out of the pages from MANY stories. Long before ""Year One."" I personally enjoy Bane because he is one that can take on Batman, physically, one-on-one, and win. Batman isn't the strongest on Bane's block!As Bane was found, trained and eventually excommunicated by ""The League of Shadows"", there was another found with him in the Pit of Hell. A young girl. She had climbed out of the pit, (the only one so far), found her Mercenary father,  thus saving Bane too. Bane's cohort, friend and whatever else, Marrion Cotillard/Miranda/Talia. She enters the film unobtrusively. Having no real origin story into Wayne Enterprises, we find her making several attempts to gain Bruce's attention. She tries to spark a conversation with him at a function in his own mansion, but still nothing. Not until things begin to go south for Bruce, does Miranda begin her journey into Bruce's wealth and mind. Finally, into his heart. For Bruce, this the one place a woman can no longer enter. His heart has been broken, betrayed and blackened. Yet savvy Miranda has ulterior motives. She swoops in like a bat. Unlike Catwoman who is surreptitious. Miranda makes quick work of undoing Bruce Wayne's life and wealth.Her character is little more than 2 dimensional. She is not very congenial throughout 2/3 of the film. While we see her as a loathing woman with dark plans. Cotillard doesn't try to portray her role an ounce of affability. On screen, she is plainly, just there. In the final scenes, her ""coming-out"" as Talia, still misses its mark. As she is sliding the knife into Batman's side, explaining why using a knife is so much more pleasurable, (slowly killing a victim), Bane has a tear rolling down his cheek. In this heavy dramatic moment, I still couldn't define ""evil"" in her. Yet to make big, bad Bane cry? Sorry. This was the only miscast role in the entire Batman trilogy Nolan made!As for the remaining cast, well, Joseph Gordon-Levitt/Blake Robinson/(Robin) was a perfect ""hot-head"" cop that was so desperately needed in Gotham. Much to Gary Oldman/Commissioner Gordon's playbook! Gordon-Levitt would be an excellent Robin or NightWing in the upcoming ""Superman vs. Batman"" movie! He played a tough, determined and unafraid rookie cop. Ready to mix-it-up with some good, old-fashioned brawling. The beginnings of a hero. Gary Oldman IS Commissioner Gordon. I couldn't imagine anyone else filling his shoes. Last, but never least,  is Morgan Freeman/Lucius Fox. He is by far, one of the greatest actors of this generation!""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the end of a trilogy that is more than the sum of it's parts. It has created a template for other comic-to-screen adaptations to live up to. A new standard. Be they from DC, CapCom or Marvel. When things are done with perfection, you follow it. Mr. Nolan has delivered three films that developed into history now. Any and all films in the future will not only have to match, but try to surpass these achievement's with excellence.Many have spoken that Bale's Batman was too brooding and depressing. I think of it this way. Were anyone to carry such a burden of being the Batman, keep it a secret, unable to love or be loved, that is fertile grounds for depression. Sure, having immense wealth is wonderful! But if you are alone, cannot share it with a loved one, there's depression. Dressing up in a cape and Cowl, hiding ones identity to fight injustice, there's depression. Watching your parents murdered as a youth, having Night Terrors from it your entire life, you would be brooding too!So, Mr. Bale has done justice to the Dark Knight after all! It shall be very interesting to see if Ben Afflek can carry the torch, and become the next Batman in the upcoming movie?I wrote this---Jus B.

1418585,AVLW8Y8D3WJLT,B004LWZWGA,"Justin Ordonez ""foodmart""","[31, 45]","On my first day of third grade, my teacher delighted every school boy or girl present, including myself, when she said, ""Class, as of today, everyone has an A."" The smiles were huge, but they were soon followed by grumbles. Could it really be so easy? Of course, it wasn't. My teacher explained, ""Everyone has an A, but from this point on, each grade beneath it takes away from that A."" In short, it was a trick--a way to make students prone to thinking they were starting with nothing and working towards greatness as thinking they were starting with greatness and they only had to sustain. In regards to Christopher Nolan, who is one of the greatest living writers period, this scale is no trick. It's a requirement. You must judge Nolan on a scale of greatness, then determine if he sustained it, and while Christopher Nolan has never made a bad movie, he got dangerously close in The Dark Knight Rises (DRK).So, what's wrong with the DKR? How can the third movie of a successful franchise, using the same creators, the same cast, and one of the biggest budgets in movie history fall short? It's the same thing that sinks most movies in its position, the writing wasn't there. Post DK, Christopher Nolan has been extremely busy, including making his dream movie, the mega-successful and mentally-titillating Inception, and he (I'm including his brother in ""he"") never got the opportunity to finish the DKR script, which is the script's largest problem--it's not bad, it's incomplete. Nolan is one of the most technically sound writers in Hollywood. This guy never makes a mistake, his every line of dialogue pushes the story forward, he follows storytelling theory to its core, focusing on building familiar settings, strong antagonists, helpers who have clearly defined roles, breaks his scripts into three clear acts, and always pays off in the ""final battle,"" and upon its conclusion, the protagonist always become ""the master of two worlds."" These aren't talents Christopher Nolan was blessed with, they're signs of a precise, obsessive, and brilliant writer, someone who's entire existence is devoted to the page, and to top it off, Nolan frequently flaunts his flare for non-chronological timelines, which are nearly Shakespearian in their careful balance and meticulous execution.All of this is missing from the DKR.Is it the result of a bad script? Or was the story anemic?First off, there were signs that Nolan's Batman franchise was fatigued. (Many noticed that DK was a rewritten version of The Prestige). In DKR, these signs became reality.Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred, played by Michael Caine, is Bruce's wiseman and trusted source of perspective. In BB, after Bruce returns from saving Rachel from Scarecrow, Alfred shares needed insight to Bruce by saying, ""You're getting lost inside this monster of yours."" This comment returns the story to one of identity before Ra's re-enters the plot (like one minute later). Alfred's informing the audience that only by being Bruce Wayne and Batman in unity will Bruce defeat Ra's al Ghul, or else Bruce is ""just a vigilante."" It seems heady and unnecessary to analyze the film this deeply, but man does it ever pay off, especially during the final battle, when Bruce fights Ra's al Ghul on a train, which Bruce's father built, that's on a collision course with Wayne Tower, a destiny Bruce has long feared, in a fight where Ra's al Ghul tells Bruce, ""You were just an ordinary man in a cape, that's why you can't fight injustice."" In the end, Bruce does become more than himself or Batman, finding a superior identity, he defeats Ra's and preserves the Wayne legacy despite his father's home and train being destroyed. In DK, Alfred offers needed insight into Joker when he shares the story of a crazed man stealing jewels in the jungle, which informs Bruce that Joker is not a ""common criminal,"" and it informs the audience that Bruce is underestimating the Joker. By doing so, Alfred is also sharing with us how, should Bruce choose to gain this sacred knowledge, he will eventually triumph.In DKR, Alfred does not deliver a story of immense insight, he's asked to simply set up the ending, where we see Bruce Wayne living a new life away from Gotham. To complicate things, this scene also sets the tone of what is DKR's worst flaw, indulgence. For a writer who's known for his restraint, Nolan packed DKR with little needed side-scenes. Here you have Michael Caine, one of the greatest actors of all time at his rare specialty, the actor who makes boring but necessary dialogue interesting, an under-appreciated day laborer working for bosses making huge bonuses off his sweat, and all you really have to do, in Nolan's position, is not over think it. Do what you did in BB and DK and let Michael Caine tell the story, let the camera watch him stoically, and do absolutely nothing else. However, Nolan chose to cutaway to a depiction of Alfred's story, which was heart-wrenching as it gave away the final twist. It was an unfortunate risk that didn't pay off for Nolan, and that happens, but it's an indulgence because (I feel) it's likely the audience would've remembered Alfred's story without the cutaway. It's doubtful that Michael Caine is anyone's favorite actor, yet we all know one thing: When Caine speaks, we listen.Before I stray too far from my premise, I will concede that my argument thus far begs the question. If Alfred always has insight to offer on the antagonist, why does Alfred have none to offer in DKR? Alfred has none because, technically, DKR has no antagonist. In any good story, the antagonist is the character who represents all the protagonist's fear, guilt and denial. (This is why the Joker is Batman's ultimate villain). Or to be brief, it's the character who wants to prevent the protagonist from reaching his/her goal. So who is the antagonist of DRK? Is it Bane? No, it's not. We find out at the end that Bane isn't doing what he's doing to stop Batman from fixing Gotham. He's doing it because of an immense, and subsequently pathetic, love for Talia al Ghul. But, wait... It's obviously Talia al Ghul, isn't it? Wrong again! Talia claims that her motivation is finishing her father's work. If her father's dream was to blow up Miami Beach, she'd have done so. It's a powerful motivator for her character, but it also means she's not Batman's nemesis.So who is the antagonist of DKR? It's Ra's al Ghul.It turns out that DKR is a bigger version of BB, which might've worked, except it ends up being hollow, we don't get a pay off, because Ra's al Ghul was defeated two movies ago. We know he cannot beat Bruce, and we know Bruce has already gained all the ""sacred knowledge"" necessary to defeat Ra's, and so Bruce is already the ""master of two worlds"" in this challenge. He's just, you know, older. Sometimes Alfred pointed out at nauseum.At the end of BB, Bruce tries to tell Rachel that Batman is just a symbol, and Rachel tells him it's untrue, that Batman is no longer a mask. In DK, she writes Bruce a letter telling him that he'll always need Batman. Both of these stories confirm Alfred's insight in BB, which was that Bruce had to become something more than Batman or Bruce. By having Bruce face Ra's al Ghul again in DKR, we draw Bruce into another identity crisis, but this one is harder to maneuver without Rachel. There're few characters who know both Bruce and Batman equally, so it falls on Alfred to do it, and he proceeds to abandon Bruce, essentially equating Bruce's drive to save Gotham to that of a deranged and suicidal alcoholic.Using Talia and Bane worsens the identity crisis plotline. As the saying goes, the protagonist is only as strong as the antagonist, and as Christopher Nolan knows, and temporarily forgot for DKR, all antagonists should be fanatical in their pursuits. Consider BB, where Ra's knows no limit in his view of justice, and then DK, where Joker so radically subscribes to anarchy that he mocks ""cause and effect"" theory by changing the origin story of his scars on his every recollection. In essence, despite being the most radical of the three movies, DKR is not a story of fanaticism, it's a story of love---it's the tragedy of Bane's love for Talia, and Talia's love for her father, and since neither pursuit represents fanaticism, we know our antagonists don't actually believe in their actions, which means they lack identity, as well.For plenty of DKR, we listen to unintelligible speeches about how Gotham's being ""returned to the people,"" which feels engineered since none of Gotham's citizens are actual planners or participators in this revolution, except for maybe a few hundred people in the sewers and 1,000 released prisoners. (BTW, in DK, didn't Nolan show us that even prisoners have morality? Why are they so willing, in DKR, to supplant an entire society? If it's true that these prisoners are locked up by Dent's law, then they're locals and they have families who're going to die.) Because of this, when Batman arrives at the final battle, beating down Bane, shouting, ""Where is the trigger? I know you wouldn't give it to an average citizen"" it feels anti-climatic. As an audience, we've known this data for hours, but Batman's only now catching up? Where is the journey we take with one of the world's greatest detectives? (Answer: We can't take it! He was stuck in a hole on the other side of the world...FOREVER.) Sure, Bane's claims of giving the button to an ""average citizen"" is, I suppose, a nice play on what the Joker did in DK, but I don't see why it was necessary in DKR.As if the final battle in DKR wasn't flawed enough, it's felt like Batman says more than he does in all of BB and DK combined. We're talking about a dark, mysterious figure so powerful that his nemesis's often speak for him. In DK, when hung off the edge of the building, mobster Salvatore Maroni surmises the situation for Batman, saying, ""From one professional to another, if you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot. From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me,"" which of course leaves Batman to say in his cold as ice manner, ""I'm counting on it."" When confronting Bane in DKR, on the steps of Gotham's City Hall (I believe), in response to Bane's taunt, Batman blandly says, ""I came here to stop you."" (If Nolan had been on his game, Bane would have said, ""Have you come here to stop me, Batman?"" and Batman would've said, ""[enter comeback here]."")All these elements in DKR are tied together by the classic movie convention, a time bomb, which is, in actuality, a writers way of saying, ""Since the entire universe is going to end simultaneously, all these plotlines must be related, right?"" But, in this is where Nolan becomes the victim. How could he have anticipated the Japanese tsunami and pursuant reactor crisis? When he wrote the script, he had to feel comfortable with it, yet when his audience sees it now, things like ""blast radius,"" ""radioactive decay,"" and, ""weaponized,"" are not terms we let graze past us. We know nuclear reactors can't detonate like a bomb, they need to be designed specifically as a bomb, and that weapons grade materials aren't safe for day-in and day-out power generation. Had Nolan known that we'd know this, Lucius Fox would've given a sentence or two to dismiss it, or invented a reason why fusion generation can explode catastrophically. Regardless, when we learn that it takes months for the radioactive decay to reach a critical point of instability (which I think is backwards, but I'm not a nuclear physicist, so what do I know), it feels eerily similiar to Japan's reactor meltdowns, which took weeks to be stabilized, yet because of the Japan crisis, we know it's ridiculous to even contemplate that the process, the decay or the meltdown, can be bolted down to an exact second five months in advance.The science of the bomb plot bit Nolan in the butt, but where Nolan owns fault is in his story application of the bomb, which is problematic. Supposedly, Batman flies out over the bay, sacrificing his life to save the city (something which would resolve his identity crisis and confirm that, yes, the merged identities in BB did happen). Though, because of the DKR's beginning, I was expecting Alfred to go on vacation, stop for a drink, and look for Bruce, so the fake funeral beforehand was tedious, cause I was 2hrs 30mins in and I still hadn't gotten a pay-off, I was still waiting for Bruce to become the master of two worlds for DKR, and I knew that was impossible if he was dead. Of course, DKR does cut to Alfred drinking and looking up at Bruce with Selina Kyle, which offers its own closure. If Bruce needed Batman to come to terms with his parent's death, perhaps ridding himself of Batman, and using the ""Clean Slate"" program to give both him and his new love a chance at happiness, represents becoming a master of two worlds, but that is also problematic since, if it's true, then Bruce was his own antagonist in DKR, and if he was his own antagonist, why bring back Ra's al Ghul? And if Bruce was his own antagonist, and Ra's was just a symbol of that antagonist, and if Bruce didn't actually die on his helicopter flight, and he always knew he wouldn't die on it, then what exactly was the final battle, who won it, and does it even matter?In the end, Nolan created a meaning paradox. Everything about this movie begs the question.These contradictions in DKR null and void more than just the antagonist question. Most of the plot is built on the political and judicial reforms enacted after Harvey Dent's death, and it ties the deception involved in Harvey Dent's death to the failure of these protocols (crime goes down, but it's only because they've pushed all the poor and downtrodden into the sewers). Lots of time is spent in DKR talking about the ""truth"" and bringing it forward. Indeed, Bane does read Commissioner Gordon's unread speech, spilling the truth about Harvey's demise, which I guess every Gothamite wholly believed since no one questioned it. In fact, after Bane said this great secret, it was barely mentioned again. At the conclusion, Harvey Dent is outed as Two Face, and Batman is recognized as the true white knight of Gotham, but this in itself represents another contradiction. When Bruce decided to fake his death, or Batman's, he may have metaphorically killed Batman, but in reality, Batman becomes just another Harvey Dent, another fallen martyr who didn't actually die for Gotham.Wasn't that what caused the conditions for the third movie?In the end, I guess, Bruce's identity crisis between himself and Batman gets resolved when defeating his mentor, a man talented at multiple identities and deception in Ra's al Ghul (BB), goes onto to create a lie about Harvey Dent's death to stimulate collective action in Gotham and squash the Joker's plans for anarchy (DK), yet in DKR, we find out that Bruce didn't really resolve any identity crisis in BB, he never really needed to become Batman, and while it was a mistake to tell the lie he told in DK, it's okay to tell it again so that he can move to Europe and hook-up constantly with Selina Kyle.(Not that I blame him!!!!)So what could've given DKR a puncher's chance?Two movies.What Christopher Nolan tried to create, he is more than capable of doing, but he needed an extra ninety minutes to balance it in the special way only he can. Being such a traditionalist, Nolan might despise the idea that Harry Potter, Twilight, and the Hobbit are being turned into multiple movies from singular sources, but DKR would have done well to have a Part I and Part II, six months apart from each other, a la Harry Potter. The first movie ends when Batman gets his back broken. The second opens on a montage of him healing. It saves us the twenty minutes where he lays around immobilized on a mat, and it provides time to fill story holes and develop a proper antagonist. Ra's al Ghul can easily be a big part of this story, but he needs to be an inspiration to Talia, a catalyst for bigger things.All that said, you can fall too far down the rabbit hole in regards to Christopher Nolan. He still gets top notch performances out of Christian Bale, Jason Gordon-Levitt, and a bit to my surprise, Anne Hathaway, who's an understated master at facial expressions (who knew?). The script, while flawed philosophically, has all the witty banter one expects from the likes of Nolan, including a few good jokes between Alfred and Bruce, a few good love-jabs between Selina and Bruce, and I think even Bane managed to turn a phrase or two. To paraphrase what I said earlier, it's not that this movie is bad, it's not that the script is bad, it's just not finished. Nolan could've done better with these pieces, and I think in time, he will say, ""If I could do it again, I'd have given myself another 2 years to finish Batman."" Who knows if that extra time could've have taken DKR to the level of BB and DK, aren't all the third movies in trilogies awful? In the end, the standards and protocols, ""the way things have always been done,"" states that no series is complete unless it's a trilogy at the minimum, but perhaps in Nolan's Bat trilogy, two movies were more than enough.",3,The Dark Knight Flounders,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,17160,"['first', 'day', 'third', 'grade', 'teacher', 'delighted', 'school', 'boy', 'girl', 'present',

This is not the personality I recall from the comic books I loved. These heroes had compelling reasons to do what they do; they had drive and energy to develop and master super abilities and invent whizbang new devices. They mastered themselves, controlled their environment, and defeated their criminal adversaries. They knew who they were, what they had available, and how to get the job done, and they kicked ass. ESPECIALLY BATMAN! He's a normal guy (no special powers) spurred by the brutal murder of his family in his presence leaving nightmares and loneliness in it's wake. With the help of Alfred, who nurtured, supported and assisted him; he trained his body,honed special skills, invented special tools and weapons; and when he was ready, he became the Batman. The Batman in this series is a lovelorn whiner and self-doubter with a crumbling sense of self - where'd that come from! Now they even have Alfred abandoning his commitments to Bruce/Batman. They've even got Alfred whining and whimpering about his failed expectations and he quits! I am disappointed and ashamed of Alfred. I don't like this Batman and I don't appreciate this change in this character. Stan Lee should have his ASS KICKED (Whap! Bing! Bang! Wop!)!!!

Since then, Batman has been absent, Bruce Wayne has been hold up in his home, and things have been relatively peaceful in Gotham City. That is until a mercenary called Bane shows up and starts causing trouble. He begins by stealing Bruce's fingerprints and bankrupting him. Apparently he knows his secret. He then steals a nuclear fusion reactor core, cut Gotham off from the world and lets chaos run rampant. Batman was no match for Bane, and he has been thrown into a prison in a far away land. To save Gotham, Bruce must escape from the prison, dispose of the nuclear bomb, defeat Bane and come to terms with his own insecurities. He isn't alone. There is a clever girl named Selena Kyle, that will put on a mask and fight with Batman to save the city.This is a great sequel. All of the actors do a great job. There is considerably less action in this movie than the previous 2. Much of this film is focused on Bruce Wayne's depression, despair, and fragile mental state.

1418591,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B004LWZWGA,K.T. May,"[4, 6]","Christopher Nolan's latest and last installment of his revamped Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises, is arguably the film with the most heart of the trio. This is more of a cerebral film than its predecessors. You will not see as much of Batman as before, however you will see more Bruce Wayne. You will not see the level of gritty violence or drawn-out brawling that The Dark Knight. delivered. You will also, sadly, not see Heath Ledger. You will, however, see the Dark Knight rise.Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale or, as some websites like to call him, ""BatBale"") is a broken man, both mentally and physically. He is recovering from his injuries endured at the end of The Dark Knight, as well as his broken heart. When Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) takes him by surprise by robbing his ""uncrackable"" safe and stealing his mother's necklace, along with reports of Bane (Tom Hardy) causing some serious trouble in Gotham City, Bruce is inspired to once again don the mask and become the Batman.Alfred (Michael Caine) fears for Bruce, so he leaves Wayne Manor in an attempt to provide Bruce with some clarity. This act of tough love is immediately swallowed up in the simmering peril lurking quite literally beneath the city. Bane is about to rain more terror and brutality on the city of Gotham than we have seen it encounter thus far and, for the first time, Batman might not be enough to stop him.Hathaway makes an excellent Catwoman, and thankfully, because Nolan is a master of subtlety, she is never actually titled as such, nor is she dressed like a fool. She is quick, both in wit and fight, and she reinvents a character that seemed beyond saving after the crap-fest that was Halle Berry's Catwoman. Best of all, she is believable.Hardy's Bane is a magnetic villain. I never had much interest in the character, yet I found myself anticipating his next scene. A major theme in this film is that we should not let our emotions control us, particularly our anger. While Bruce Wayne fights his own stubborn will to accomplish this task, we can see why, like the Joker, Bane is the polar opposite of Batman. Although while the Joker may have had no other motive than to ""watch the world burn"", Bane's motivation is more rational and understandable. While we both loved Ledger's Joker and anticipated his demise, we find ourselves caught off-guard in that we can honestly sympathize with Bane.Gary Oldman is respectable once again as Commissioner Gordon, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, an actor whose work I would always gladly watch twice, was excellent as John Blake. Gordon-Levitt is an actor who rarely, if ever, lets me down. His presence in a film is almost a guarantee that it will not suck.Marion Cotillard was satisfying as Miranda, although I couldn't seem to separate her from her role alongside Gordon-Levitt in Inception. The female leads in these Batman films always fall flat for me. Keep an eye out for a cameo from a character we have seen in previous films who may or may not surprise you in presence alone, but who delivers one of the funnier lines of the film.Oldman and Gordon-Levitt (like Bale, Morgan Freeman, Hathaway, heck every actor in this film), never fail to capture your belief in their performances. These actors don't just act; they become the characters they play. This is appreciable when a film wants to transport you to a different world and actually takes you there.Some have complained that The Dark Knight Rises suffers from being stretched too thin, and that it did not need to be a two hour and forty-four minute film. I will argue that this film is akin to the television series ""Mad Men"": it simmers for a while at a slow boil, but when it finally comes to a head, you will not regret one minute of your time spent. Much of the film is spent sitting at the edge of a seat, knowing something explosive is coming yet unsure of when.One of the selling points for me to see this film, as if I needed one, was that since I had not seen it on opening weekend, everyone I knew had already seen it and told me that the last few scenes made the movie. They were correct. I never thought I'd cry at a Batman film, and that is not only a testament to how solidly Nolan can build a foundation, but how he can also properly finish what he started. Nolan was able to finish his opus with the same levels of grace and closure that we have come to expect from such a master filmmaker.",3,"Deshey Basara: ""The Dark Knight Rises"" has heart",1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,4405,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'latest', 'last', 'installment', 'revamped', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'arguably', 'film', 'most', 'heart', 'trio', 'more', 'cerebral', 'film', 'predecessors', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'Batman', 'before', 'however', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'level', 'gritty', 'violence', 'drawn-out', 'brawling', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'delivered', 'will', 'also', 'sadly', 'not', 'see', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'will', 'however', 'see', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'rise.Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'websites', 'call', 'BatBale', 'broken', 'man', 'mentally', 'physically', 'recovering', 'injuries', 'endured', 'end', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'as', 'well', 'broken', 'heart', 'When', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'surprise', 'robbing', 'uncrackable', 'safe', 'stealing', 'mother', 'necklace', 'reports', 'Bane', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'causing', 'serious', 'trouble', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Bruce', 'inspired', 'once', 'again', 'don', 'mask', 'become', 'Batman.Alfred', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'fears', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Manor', 'attempt', 'provide', 'Bruce', 'clarity', 'act', 'tough', 'love', 'immediately', 'swallowed', 'up', 'simmering', 'peril', 'lurking', 'quite', 'literally', 'city', 'Bane', 'rain', 'more', 'terror', 'brutality', 'city', 'Gotham', 'have', 'seen', 'encounter', 'thus', 'far', 'first', 'time', 'Batman', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'stop', 'him.Hathaway', 'excellent', 'Catwoman', 'thankfully', 'Nolan', 'master', 'subtlety', 'never', 'actually', 'titled', 'such', 'dressed', 'fool', 'quick', 'wit', 'fight', 'character', 'seemed', 'saving', 'crap-fest', 'was', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Catwoman', 'Best', 'believable.Hardy', 'Bane', 'magnetic', 'villain', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'interest', 'character', 'yet', 'found', 'anticipating', 'next', 'scene', 'major', 'theme', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'let', 'emotions', 'control', 'particularly', 'anger', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'own', 'stubborn', 'will', 'accomplish', 'task', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Joker', 'Bane', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'other', 'motive', 'watch', 'world', 'burn', 'Bane', 'motivation', 'more', 'rational', 'understandable', 'loved', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'anticipated', 'demise', 'find', 'caught', 'off-guard', 'can', 'honestly', 'sympathize', 'Bane.Gary', 'Oldman', 'respectable', 'once', 'again', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'actor', 'work', 'would', 'always', 'gladly', 'watch', 'twice', 'was', 'excellent', 'John', 'Blake', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'actor', 'who', 'rarely', 'ever', 'down', 'presence', 'film', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'will', 'not', 'suck.Marion', 'Cotillard', 'was', 'satisfying', 'Miranda', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'separate', 'role', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Inception', 'female', 'leads', 'Batman', 'films', 'always', 'fall', 'flat', 'Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'cameo', 'character', 'have', 'seen', 'previous', 'films', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'surprise', 'presence', 'alone', 'who', 'one', 'funnier', 'lines', 'film.Oldman', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Bale', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Hathaway', 'heck', 'actor', 'film', 'never', 'fail', 'capture', 'belief', 'performances', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'act', 'become', 'characters', 'play', 'appreciable', 'when', 'film', 'transport', 'different', 'world', 'actually', 'there.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'suffers', 'being', 'stretched', 'too', 'thin', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'two', 'hour', 'forty-four', 'minute', 'film', 'will', 'argue', 'film', 'akin', 'television', 'series', 'Mad', 'Men', 'while', 'slow', 'boil', 'when', 'finally', 'head', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'one', 'minute', 'time', 'spent', 'Much', 'film', 'spent', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'knowing', 'something', 'explosive', 'coming', 'yet', 'unsure', 'when.One', 'selling', 'points', 'see', 'film', 'needed', 'one', 'was', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'opening', 'weekend', 'everyone', 'knew', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'told', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'made', 'movie', 'were', 'correct', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'cry', 'Batman', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'testament', 'how', 'solidly', 'Nolan', 'can', 'build', 'foundation', 'how', 'can', 'also', 'properly', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'Nolan', 'was', 'able', 'finish', 'opus', 'same', 'levels', 'grace', 'closure', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'such', 'master', 'filmmaker']",N/A

Two Face is dead and The Joker, a character who should've been mentioned if not given a cameo appearance, is in prison. Enter Bane, a strong vicious beast of a man with a gas mask stuck to his face.

1418604,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B004LWZWGA,maskedgamer,"[5, 7]","I love the entire Batman series matter of fact he's my favorite comic book character. I liked Batman for the fact that he's a normal guy who knows the odds are always against him but he still carries on the battle anyway. Just about everything Batman does is about him overcoming and conquering something. What makes him work is that he's human with no super powers, no special abilities, he's just a normal trying to do something extraordinary and at times it takes away from his personal life and mostly he doesn't know who he is as a person and gets lost behind his mask as a protector of the city. In this film you don't really see any of those things that make Batman... well Batman. The movie starts out with him having Abandoned the City as a superhero and for what? This series is about the birth of Batman and him becoming a superhero. How is that possible with in movie 1 he establishes Batman, Movie 2 he is establishing his role and value in the city and movie 3 he has basically abandoned everything he did and stood for in movies 1&2.""The Dark Knight Rises"" isn't exactly a fitting title for this movie, it's more like ""The Dark Night Falls"". You would assume that this movie would be about Batman once again rising over the villains and connecting deeper with his purpose of being a crime fighter. You really don't get that with this film it's more like the feeling of Rocky coming back from retirement for his last fight. This was actually a very depressing Batman film and there wasn't much about it that made him feel like a ""superhero"". Throughout the movie he is always one step behind the villain and seems to be in great distress. This isn't at all what Batman/Bruce Wayne are about. Batman is overly cautious about protecting his identity and his ""belongings"". You would never find his vehicles so easily and you would never just be able to walk into the Batcave like that. Hence why he goes to the trouble of secluding all his equipment in an isolated cave. It just seems highly unlikely that anyone would ever get their hands on any of his technology by such simple means. Of course that's all just part of the plot for the movie but the comic version of Batman isn't so naive.What I'm really just trying to get at about the movie is that it's depressing because it always feels like Batman just wants to give up and not really be Batman anymore. The more he sees a challenge in the movie the less he wants to put on his cape. His girlfriend was killed and his 2 face was killed and now he's fallen into depression again although he became Batman because his loved ones were killed to begin with, it just really contradicts the first 2 movies. To see Batman defeated and not comeback even harder and even worse without a plan is just kind of sad. For example, When Batman takes a hit he usually goes back to the cave, heals, comes up with a plan, and takes it to action to defeat his foe. In this movie THAT NEVER HAPPENS! He never actually follows what Batman would do. For example in Batman Vs. The Predator (great comic book btw) Batman is literally almost beaten to death by the Predator. He has absolutely no chance against him and barely escapes with his life. While Batman is healing he puts his mind to work and starts to figure out a way to beat the Predator so he designs the unbelievable suit of Bat armor that puts him on the same level as the Predator and gives him a fighting chance. THAT is how Batman should play out. If he loses a battle he uses his logic and abilities to figure out a way to win or at least increase the odds. There is absolutely none of that in the film and the ending plays out on a note that is very unBatman like.For a majority portion of the movie you hardly see Batman at all. He's maybe in it for about 45 minutes total out of the almost 3 hours of this movie. This movie mostly stars the supporting actors and the Batman makes his appearance. There is Catwoman in this film but this version I don't know. Michelle Pfeiffer's version was Purrrffffeccct and probably would have been a better fit in this movie as her character in Batman Returns was already Dark and seductive. The new Catwoman kind of seemed over the top and cartoonish plus I don't remember her ever calling herself ""Catwoman"". The actor that played her wasn't seductive and alluring enough to really pull you into her character and therefore it didn't make sense to see Batman falling for her. In the Batman Returns it makes sense because she is mysterious and seductive to Batman and they have an odd romantic chemistry and that's exactly how their romantic story is. They work as a couple because she's just as weird as he is. In this movie you never see that chemistry.But getting back to the movie it's just really depressing and not a very uplifting Super Hero movie. I was actually hoping at some point maybe Wonder Woman or Superman or maybe all the Justice league would come in and help him. Batman just seemed so lonely and depressed in the film it made you feel depressed watching him, and that's pretty much how I felt about it.3/5 for a good but movie but not a good super hero movie. I'm kind of disappointed the trilogy ended this way as 1&2 were completely amazing beyond belief.",3,The Dark Night Rises Co Starring Batman,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,5229,"['love', 'entire',

Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 9]","""The Dark Knight Rises"" concludes the Batman trilogy that Christopher Nolan started seven years ago with ""Batman Begins,"" an epic installment that builds on its past while providing a cracked lens view of the rising social inequality of the present. It's a testament to Nolan's team that he was able to pull off three superhero movies that are tightly integrated yet excellent films in their own right.""Rises"" takes place eight years after ""The Dark Knight,"" with Gotham City in a state of peace under the Dent Act (named after district attorney turned psychopath Harvey Dent/Two-Face). Like the beginning of Frank Miller's seminal work,The Dark Knight Returns, Batman (Christian Bale) has retired from crime fighting after the death of those closest to him. Like the end of that same graphic novel, Gotham's peace is merely a patch over a festering corruption. On the anniversary of the Dent Act, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) plans to tell the world the truth: that Batman took the fall for murders committed by Dent and the Joker (nowhere to be seen). When his courage falters, Gordon's investigation into a congressional representative puts him squarely in the path of Bane (Tom Hardy), a guy so villainous he was thrown out of the League of Shadows.I was unhappy with the changes to Bane, who was stripped of his ethnic heritage and his steroid-like Venom. But having seen the movie, I now understand -- the plot requires Bane to be a white guy. He's been transformed into a sort of anti-Batman, second guessing everything Batman does. Less forgivable is his Sean Connery impersonation, a Scottish burr muffled behind a mask that makes Bane sound like a jovial Santa Claus. It's disorienting to say the least, and at times almost indecipherable, particularly in a THX theater where the soundtrack rattles your ribcage.Meanwhile, Wayne Enterprises is in disarray. Having already lost control of the company because Bruce Wayne shelved his weapons division, business rival John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) strikes a fatal blow by bankrolling Bane's attack on the Gotham Stock Exchange. Like so many Americans who have lost their wealth, Wayne is now bankrupt as the rest of us.After being badgered into returning to the outside world by father-figure Alfred (Michael Caine), Wayne is torn between two love interests: board member and global do-gooder Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard, stilted) and jewel thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathway, better than expected). They are both more than they appear, a duality that shadows every character except Alfred, which becomes an irreconcilable difference between he and Wayne.Batman finally rouses to action to take on Bane, only to discover that his false reputation as a murder causes more harm than good, just like it did when the Joker framed Batman for his own murder in The Dark Knight Returns. When Bane's plan goes into full swing, the plot diverges into two story lines: the breaking of Batman's city (No Man's Land) and his body (Knightfall).What ensues is an all out war that veers from the unbelievable to comic book levels of audaciousness. Nolan's grim and gritty take on the universe doesn't always make sense (3,000 cops for millions of citizens and enough food ferried in to feed them all?), but it makes up for it with spectacle and the chilling parallels to American society today.That's what makes ""The Dark Knight Rises"" so good. A villain rises from the Lazarus Pit. The police rise from the ruins of Gotham. Batman rises from the wreckage of his ruined body. Wayne Enterprises rises from fiscal ruin. And, Nolan warns, if we don't do something about social injustice in America, the people will rise too.",4,'The Dark Knight Rises': Knightfalls in No Man's Land,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,3668,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'started', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'epic', 'installment', 'past', 'providing', 'cracked', 'lens', 'view', 'rising', 'social', 'inequality', 'present', 'testament', 'Nolan', 'team', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'three', 'superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'tightly', 'integrated', 'yet', 'excellent', 'films', 'own', 'right', 'Rises', 'place', 'eight', 'years', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Gotham', 'City', 'state', 'peace', 'Dent', 'Act', 'named', 'district', 'attorney', 'turned', 'psychopath', 'Harvey', 'Dent/Two-Face', 'beginning', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'seminal', 'work', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'Batman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'retired', 'crime', 'fighting', 'death', 'closest', 'end', 'same', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Gotham', 'peace', 'merely', 'patch', 'festering', 'corruption', 'anniversary', 'Dent', 'Act', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'tell', 'world', 'truth', 'Batman', 'took', 'fall', 'murders', 'committed', 'Dent', 'Joker', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'When', 'courage', 'falters', 'Gordon', 'investigation', 'congressional', 'representative', 'squarely', 'path', 'Bane', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'guy', 'so', 'villainous', 'was', 'thrown', 'League', 'Shadows.I', 'was', 'unhappy', 'changes', 'Bane', 'who', 'was', 'stripped', 'ethnic', 'heritage', 'steroid-like', 'Venom', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'now', 'understand', 'plot', 'Bane', 'be', 'white', 'guy', 'been', 'transformed', 'sort', 'anti-Batman', 'second', 'guessing', 'everything', 'Batman', 'Less', 'forgivable', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'impersonation', 'Scottish', 'burr', 'muffled', 'mask', 'Bane', 'sound', 'jovial', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'disorienting', 'say', 'least', 'times', 'almost', 'indecipherable', 'particularly', 'THX', 'theater', 'where', 'soundtrack', 'ribcage.Meanwhile', 'Wayne', 'Enterprises', 'disarray', 'Having', 'already', 'lost', 'control', 'company', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'shelved', 'weapons', 'division', 'business', 'rival', 'John', 'Daggett', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'fatal', 'blow', 'bankrolling', 'Bane', 'attack', 'Gotham', 'Stock', 'Exchange', 'so', 'many', 'Americans', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'wealth', 'Wayne', 'now', 'bankrupt', 'rest', 'us.After', 'being', 'badgered', 'returning', 'outside', 'world', 'father-figure', 'Alfred', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Wayne', 'torn', 'two', 'love', 'interests', 'board', 'member', 'global', 'do-gooder', 'Miranda', 'Tate', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'stilted', 'jewel', 'thief', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'Anne', 'Hathway', 'better', 'expected', 'are', 'more', 'appear', 'duality', 'character', 'Alfred', 'irreconcilable', 'difference', 'Wayne.Batman', 'finally', 'action', 'take', 'Bane', 'only', 'discover', 'false', 'reputation', 'murder', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'just', 'did', 'when', 'Joker', 'framed', 'Batman', 'own', 'murder', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'When', 'Bane', 'plan', 'full', 'swing', 'plot', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'breaking', 'Batman', 'city', 'Man', 'Land', 'body', 'Knightfall', '.What', 'out', 'war', 'veers', 'unbelievable', 'comic', 'book', 'levels', 'audaciousness', 'Nolan', 'grim', 'gritty', 'take', 'universe', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', '3,000', 'cops', 'millions', 'citizens', 'enough', 'food', 'ferried', 'feed', 'up', 'spectacle', 'chilling', 'parallels', 'American', 'society', 'today.That', 'what', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'so', 'good', 'villain', 'Lazarus', 'Pit', 'police', 'rise', 'ruins', 'Gotham', 'Batman', 'wreckage', 'ruined', 'body', 'Wayne', 'Enterprises', 'fiscal', 'ruin', 'Nolan', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'social', 'injustice', 'America', 'people', 'will', 'rise', 'too']",N/A
1418609,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B004LWZWGA,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""The Dark Knight Rises"" is, mercifully, the third and final installment of Christopher Nolan's contribution to the Batman franchise. The potential of ""Batman Begins"" (2005) has degenerated into thematic and narrative incoherence, sheathed in overlong spectacle. Despairing over the loss of Rachel Dawes in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), having assumed the blame for District Attorney Arthur Dent's crimes, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has spent the last 8 years as a semi-invalid recluse in his family's palatial home. He is spurred into action by his company's financial difficulties and a new menace in Gotham. Bane (Tom Hardy), a big bald villain who speaks through a voice-distorting mask, has shot Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), raided the stock exchange, and seems to have a personal vendetta against Bruce Wayne and Batman.This is just a bad screenplay by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. The movie runs 2 hours and 45 minutes, inexcusably long for an action film, but I have to give Christopher Nolan credit for keeping me watching. He has stretched this thing out with so many useless, nonsensical plot points that it runs an hour longer than it should and makes no sense. To Nolan's credit, the visual incoherence of the action sequences that plagued ""The Dark Knight"" has improved. Unfortunately, this may have been at the cost of the action sequences themselves, as there are not as many as the audience will expect, and the numerous hand-to-hand combat scenes are lame. There are many instances of the actors punching air, people falling down without cause, and generally weak choreography.Batman's voice gets deeper and raspier with every new movie. Bane's voice sounds like something pranksters might play at while drunk, and he's sometimes difficult to understand. He doesn't say anything important, so I wasn't bothered by this. But, you know, two superhumans making monster voices does not make for edge-of-your-seat suspense. Bane is a kind of Robespierre character. The film takes more than a little inspiration from the French Revolution. This could be interesting if Bane were more fully developed. He is scary in the inventive opening sequence but seems like decoration for the rest of the film. Anne Hathaway is the new Catwoman, a streetwise cat burglar named Selina Kyle. She is suited to the character but totally unconvincing in the fight scenes. Selina is a bad girl who wants to be a good girl if only she could get a clean record. That's her goal. Ugh.Nolan has chosen to have Bruce Wayne crippled from Batman's many injuries. He can barely walk. Then, unbelievably, with no cartilage in his joints, he gets back in fighting shape, while in an African prison. This makes no sense. Why make him crippled in the first place? It serves no purpose except to elicit disbelief. Similarly, Bruce Wayne loses all of his money through fraud. Not only is that not credible, but it is completely unnecessary in the narrative. The whole movie is like this. It is overplotted and incoherent. Stuff just happens. Thematically, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" suffers from the same problems as its predecessor: It vacillates between advocating freedom or fascism, seemingly with the wind, whenever the screenwriters can't think of anything else to do. It has never occurred to Christopher Nolan to present some kind of coherent world view.As a whole, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" does not work at all. Taken as a bunch of disjointed scenes, it has its moments and, remarkably, manages to entertain often enough to keep the audience on board for nearly 3 hours. Christopher Nolan gets the credit for that, but the Batman franchise could not withstand any more of his contributions.",3,It's Remarkable That Such a Terrible Script Can Entertain for Nearly 3 Hours.,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,3681,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'mercifully', 'third', 'final', 'installment', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'contribution', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'potential', 'Batman', 'Begins', '2005', 'degenerated', 'thematic', 'narrative', 'incoherence', 'sheathed', 'overlong', 'spectacle', 'Despairing', 'loss', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'Dark', 'Knight', '2008', 'having', 'assumed', 'blame', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Arthur', 'Dent', 'crimes', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'spent', 'last', '8', 'years', 'semi-invalid', 'recluse', 'family', 'palatial', 'home', 'spurred', 'action', 'company', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'new', 'menace', 'Gotham', 'Bane', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'big', 'bald', 'villain', 'who', 'voice-distorting', 'mask', 'shot', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'raided', 'stock', 'exchange', 'have', 'personal', 'vendetta', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Batman.This', 'just', 'bad', 'screenplay', 'Christopher', 'Jonathan', 'Nolan', 'movie', '2', 'hours', '45', 'minutes', 'inexcusably', 'long', 'action', 'film', 'have', 'give', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'credit', 'keeping', 'watching', 'stretched', 'thing', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'useless', 'nonsensical', 'plot', 'points', 'hour', 'longer', 'should', 'sense', 'Nolan', 'credit', 'visual', 'incoherence', 'action', 'plagued', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'improved', 'Unfortunately', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cost', 'action', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'audience', 'will', 'expect', 'numerous', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'lame', 'are', 'many', 'instances', 'actors', 'punching', 'air', 'people', 'falling', 'down', 'cause', 'generally', 'weak', 'choreography.Batman', 'voice', 'deeper', 'raspier', 'new', 'movie', 'Bane', 'voice', 'sounds', 'something', 'pranksters', 'might', 'play', 'drunk', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'understand', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'important', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'know', 'two', 'superhumans', 'making', 'monster', 'voices', 'not', 'make', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'suspense', 'Bane', 'kind', 'Robespierre', 'character', 'film', 'more', 'little', 'inspiration', 'French', 'Revolution', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'Bane', 'were', 'more', 'fully', 'developed', 'scary', 'inventive', 'opening', 'sequence', 'decoration', 'rest', 'film', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'new', 'Catwoman', 'streetwise', 'cat', 'burglar', 'named', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'suited', 'character', 'totally', 'unconvincing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Selina', 'bad', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'good', 'girl', 'only', 'could', 'get', 'clean', 'record', 'goal', 'Ugh.Nolan', 'chosen', 'have', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'crippled', 'Batman', 'many', 'injuries', 'can', 'barely', 'walk', 'Then', 'unbelievably', 'cartilage', 'joints', 'back', 'fighting', 'shape', 'African', 'prison', 'sense', 'Why', 'make', 'crippled', 'first', 'place', 'purpose', 'elicit', 'disbelief', 'Similarly', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'money', 'fraud', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'credible', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'narrative', 'whole', 'movie', 'overplotted', 'incoherent', 'Stuff', 'just', 'Thematically', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'suffers', 'same', 'problems', 'predecessor', 'advocating', 'freedom', 'fascism', 'seemingly', 'wind', 'whenever', 'screenwriters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'never', 'occurred', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'present', 'kind', 'coherent', 'world', 'view.As', 'whole', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'not', 'work', 'Taken', 'bunch', 'disjointed', 'scenes', 'moments', 'remarkably', 'entertain', 'often', 'enough', 'keep', 'audience', 'board', 'nearly', '3', 'hours', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'credit', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'could', 'not', 'withstand', 'more', 'contributions']",N/A
1418610,AU0Q6LA3WY65B,B004LWZWGA,M. Joy,"[2, 3]","A very tasteful amendment to the trilogy. Like a good cup of coffee after desert. The movie continually provides a constant level of entertainment with all the right qualities. It perfectly exercises a good HT system. With its DTS-MA audio mixed very well, each channel is pronounced with perfect staging, including the sub channel which consistently provides the appropriate room-rumble when awakened. No dynamic volume compression from the viewer is required either.  This film brings its thrill of surprise to the audience without rude ""volume hikes"" but instead with a story line of well-designed and often unexpected twists in plot. The whole A/V experience truly is ""mastered"" and pleasantly assembled.The video is of course also up to its par, with rich deep color dripping from multiple pallets; rendering discernible shades of purple and black, even during the dimmest of low light scenes.The acting - like the action - is simply excellent - with even the over-the-top portions remaining within the realm of ""believable"", yet ""stretching"" the fringes of ones imagination, considering state-of-the-art technologies.The actors themselves were pure perfection, as thankfully expected - considering the larger-than-life individual talents automatically on tap with Cain, Freeman, and Bale. But the others of perhaps lesser film experience were no less brilliant and notable, namely both of the heroine beauties Hathaway and Cotillard - who will no doubt continue to amaze viewers for decades.Bale's depiction of the Batman is likely to be scored second to none.

1418613,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B004LWZWGA,Moviedude,"[2, 3]","Years after thwarting the Joker, Bruce Wayne sits alone in his mansion, his body derelict from abuse and neglect, his days as a crime fighter spent after taking the blame for Harvey Dent's crimes and death. Life in Gotham has gone on, safe and prosperous without the Batman. All of this is shattered by the arrival of Bane, a new leader in the League of Shadows. Young, determined, and unbelievably strong, Bane is more than a match for Batman, and aims to succeed where Bruce Wayne refused to act: in destroying Gotham City painfully and absolutely. Beaten, bankrupted, and betrayed, Batman will face his greatest challenge: saving a city ruled by his enemies from itself.Let's get the obvious question out of the way first. Rises is not as good as The Dark Knight. In fact Heath Ledger owned the Joker so thoroughly it's hard to imagine ANY Batman film topping it. But in a way, Dark Knight's success was also a shortcoming: so dominated was it by its villian that Batman himself felt like a supporting character. Rises, by contrast, is soundly a Batman film, and its dives into the hero's psyche (and his bone-crunching fights) are as exciting and compelling here as they were in Batman Begins, if not more so. This is supported by excellent development of characters like Commissioner Gordon and newcomer Catwoman (who is not CALLED Catwoman in the film, since one silly animal-person name is already pushing it in these dark masterpieces).Rises also feels like a move between the Nolan cinematic universe and the comic books. All the Hitchcockian darkness of the past two films remains firmly in place, but the action is a bit more over the top, as armies of criminals with futuristic weapons war openly against the police. Nolan's Batman films have always presented themselves as the building of the Batman mythos and this movie does a fine job showing the ultimate outcome of that movement. The resulting film is tense, exciting, and menacingly larger than life- the best way to describe it is as a combination of the climax of Avengers and the siege of Stalingrad, the second component being pretty obviously intentional.So Rises succeeds at being a great Batman film and a solidly tense action thriller as well. However, if it has any failing it is that it leans on the comic books and other Nolan films far more than its predecessors. Still, this only means that to best enjoy it you should watch the whole trilogy- by no means a bad thing. It is also less solid than its forebearers: why does Batman waste his time erecting a flaming bat-symbol atop a bridge? Why does a city full of criminals willingly follow Bane? And yes, Tom Hardy is very hard to hear through (the audio filter of) his mask. But these weak points do not ruin the film- it starts at such a high tier that at its worst it still stands with the best releases of the year.PROS-Excellent performances from a great cast; Anne Hathaway in particular nails Catwoman to a tee-Builds the Nolan Batman franchise to an insane crescendo befitting its epic earlier episodes-Brings Batman back to the fore in a solid way-Brilliant set design, costumes, and soundtrack create an innovative and eerie world that befits the grim, terse story-Surprisingly affordable for a new release of a major hollywood picture in high defCONS-Convoluted plot has more than a few holes-About half of Bane's lines are really hard to hear since his voice blends into background noise easily-Lacks the panic and rough psychological hit of The Dark KnightSTUFF TO WATCH FOR-Batman's final battle to dispose of a huge spherical bomb with an obvious timing mechanism is more than a little reminiscent of Adam West's similar quest in the 60s film, so much so that it almost must be deliberate-One of Bane's League enforcers is played by Chris Judge, formerly of Stargate.

While I do not believe it to be a better film than the 2nd film in the trilogy, ""The Dark Knight"", I do believe it to be better than the amazing ""Batman Begins"".  This film is very dark, violent, well acted, and very intense; it will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film.  The movie opens with an amazing introduction to the film's main villain, Bane, and continues from there where the last movie left off.Batman is now a fugitive, believed to be a murderer, and has now been in hiding for 8 years.  Eventually, Bruce once again dons the cape and cowl to become the dark knight, and from then on, the action and suspense does NOT let up in the slightest! The acting by the A-list cast of actors is very well done! Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Michael Cane once again do amazing in their roles.  New notable actors to the cast are: Tom Hardy, Ann Hathaway, and Joseph Gordon Levit; all of which do an amazing job in their roles!Even though this film is amazing and engaging, it is not perfect.  There are some plot holes and some very noticeable editing flaws (most likely due to the PG-13 rating).  There is even a scene where a hallucinating Bruce Wayne sees an image (or ghost?) of someone from his past; this scene was poorly done and fairly confusing.Obviously the film is not released yet, not until December 4th, but I will be buying the blu-ray combo pack the day it is released!

1418626,A1JWJPTMS50UK7,B004LWZWGA,Ravenhawk,"[4, 6]","First, I'd like to express my sorrow for the tragedy in Aurora. This is a shame and another disgraceful, cowardly act. Thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims.Now, the movie. Stunning. I had to see this movie twice in order to make a proper review. Like Inception, this was so complex I had to see it again to fully appreciate what I'd just seen. It is simply brilliant. A perfect, satisfying conclusion to one of the very few great trilogies ever. And simply the greatest superhero/comic book trilogy. In fact, I don't know if that feat will be accomplished again.This movie collects its parts and puts them together well. Christian Bale was great as Bruce Wayne and Batman. This series showed us the hardship of being a human who decides through grief to take on really an impossible mission against all odds. And somehow, he actually succeeds to a certain extent. This wasn't so much a story of a superhero but of a man and his extraordinary journey to find closure to a trauma in his life and at the same time sacrifice himself for others in duress or without hope, showing what a true hero is. Compelling.There's so much going on that easily this film could've been lost. Few have the talent to hold it together and Christopher Nolan did it like a master. What a storyteller. He is the leader of the new breed of master storytellers with the likes of Joss Whedon, JJ Abrams and Matthew Vaughn. These guys control their worlds with great crews and casts.Everyone brought their A game. Gary Oldman, JGL, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy. Great character portrayals.Catwoman was cool and very relevant. No camp here. Good job.Bane. This villain was great. Now, people keep comparing him to Joker. Not similar whatsoever.  And that's what makes these villains great. They're not the same. Ra's Al Ghul, Scarecrow, Joker, Two Face, Bane. All their own person. I love that. Let me say, out of them all, Joker does stand out the most. Not because he's a better villain but because of the type of villain he is. He was so unpredictable in his actions. However, for the type of villain Bane is, he was even more dangerous. I love those differences. That way I don't feel like I'm watching a repeat. Bane was cool, cold, calculated, powerful, confident evil. He and Batman's brawls were intense. I loved his voice. It had class at the same time with ferocity. And, unlike some who must blast loud music in their ears causing hearing loss, I understood everything Bane said, and it wasn't that hard. You definitely couldn't be a passive listener though. You have to focus.I loved the twists in the story and, not to give anything away, the comic nod and conclusion left me completely satisfied. I love this trilogy. No superhero film has captured the humanity of its characters the way Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and now, The Dark Knight Rises did. The closest ones that did are Iron Man, X-Men First Class and Watchmen. As far as realism is concerned I mean. There are other comic films, like The Avengers, I love. In fact, The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises are my favorite movies this year. And both so different.This movie has its critics, but like each film in this series, it garners far more praise than negatives. So negative reviews will be nothing but a whisper in the wind.I tie this with The Dark Knight. This trilogy is spectacular.

1418634,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B004LWZWGA,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 10]","As ""The Dark Knight Rises"" opens - picking up eight years after the events chronicled in ""The Dark Knight"" - we find eccentric billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind.  He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer.  Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life.  All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.Though Christopher Nolan`s latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).And, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy`s Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison.  On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.Thanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together. A case in point: while Anne Hathaway brings a degree of flirtatious charm to the role of cat burglar-turned-Cat Woman, the character as a whole seems like an afterthought, tacked onto the story to provide some counter-balancing romantic interludes for the sullen, all but monastic Wayne.The cast is rounded out by Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart and others, but, more so than in the two previous entries in the series, the real stars of ""The Dark Night Rises"" turn out to be the visual pyrotechnics and special effects.",3,noticeable drop in quality from previous two,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,2794,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'picking', 'up', 'eight', 'years', 'events', 'chronicled', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'find', 'eccentric', 'billionaire', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'rather', 'depressed', 'state', 'mind', 'essentially', 'withdrawn', 'world', 'given', 'up', 'crime-fighting', 'ways', 'hung', 'up', 'Batman', 'cape', 'having', 'largely', 'fallen', 'favor', 'citizens', 'Gotham', 'City', 'who', 'see', 'hero', 'more', 'out-of-control', 'killer', 'Only', 'loyal', 'servant/father-figure', 'Albert', 'venerable', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'enough', 'give', 'swift', 'kick', 'rear-end', 'now', 'again', 'try', 'get', 'move', 'life', 'changes', 'however', 'when', 'fascistic', 'Bane', 'town', 'figure', 'so', 'consummate', 'villainy', 'willing', 'blow', 'up', 'whole', 'blasted', 'metropolis', 'atomic', 'bomb', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'wants.Though', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 's', 'latest', 'entry', 'series', 'nowhere', 'near', 'engaging', 'as', 'gripping', 'previous', 'two', 'especially', 'second', 'movie', 'certain', 'historical', 'contemporary', 'significance', 'echoes', 'French', 'Revolution', 'Occupy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'though', 'oddly', 'movie', 'intent', 'putting', 'wrong', 'side', 'history', 'cases', 'rooting', 'corrupt', 'status', 'quo', 'grass-roots', 'uprising', 'corruption', '.And', 'let', 'face', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'one', 'richest', 'villains', 'movie', 'history', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'act', 'anyone', 'follow', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 's', 'Bane', 'even', 'mask', 'amplified', 'voice', 'mite', 'tame', 'comparison', 'own', 'terms', 'however', 'Bane', 'reasonably', 'effective', 'only', 'implacable', 'nature', 'evil', 'willingness', 'sacrifice', 'masses', 'innocent', 'people', 'enrich', 'own', 'power.Thanks', 'partly', 'muddled', 'politics', 'partly', 'overstuffed', 'nature', 'storytelling', 'movie', 'never', 'way', 'fully', 'engage', 'audience', 'world', 'created', 'fact', 'comparison', 'narrative', 'sturdiness', 'two', 'predecessors', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'across', 'bit', 'messy', 'affair', 'overall', 'subplots', 'spinning', 'off', 'directions', 'little', 'gravity', 'core', 'bind', 'together', 'case', 'point', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'degree', 'flirtatious', 'charm', 'role', 'cat', 'burglar-turned-Cat', 'Woman', 'character', 'whole', 'afterthought', 'tacked', 'story', 'provide', 'counter-balancing', 'romantic', 'interludes', 'sullen', 'monastic', 'Wayne.The', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'others', 'more', 'so', 'two', 'previous', 'entries', 'series', 'real', 'stars', 'Dark', 'Night', 'Rises', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'visual', 'pyrotechnics', 'special', 'effects']",N/A

1418637,A2AYNSEH2GSP3L,B004LWZWGA,Samurai Soldier,"[0, 0]","""The Dark Knight Rises"" at least in my humble opinion, is my favorite of the Christian Bale- Chrisopher Nolan trilogy.  The Bane character is fierce and awesome, and all though the Catwoman character brought little to the story in terms of depth (& the romance seems implausible) she still came off as very sexy and quite dynamic.Amazon.com Commenter ""Superhiro"" makes a number of very valid points in his criticism of this film, including the question of why Batman-Bruce Wayne is in such a terrible physical state eight years after his battle against the Joker and Harvey Dent.  The very reason why the plot and situations in ""TDKR"" are all because of the Joker (the late Heath ledger) but as ""Superhiro"" mentioned he isn't even referenced nor looked back upon at all in this film.Bane's sudden appearance, and ""Terrorist Group"" plot make an excellent villain angle, but why after 8 years since the night Batman-Bruce fought Harvey Dent is Bane making his appearance?The ""League of Shadows"" Ninja Clan theme was very much like the original comic book, so unlike the Michael Keaton - Jack Nicolson 1980's version we get to see the character's more detailed origins.And I for one unlike others who may have very much enjoyed this film also, felt the police officer ""Robin"" character was totally useless and not needed in this film at all.  The fact that he alone figured out after a brief encounter with Bruce Wayne as a boy, that Bruce was indeed Batman was completely ubsurd and not believable.  Is everyone in Gotham City an idiot except this character?What I also enjoyed about this film is how Nolan uses real life and modern world issues, and places the positives and negatives of the out comes of certain beliefs or political policies in these movies.  The Harvey Dent Act is clearly art copying life, with the ""Patriot Act"", and the complex problems of dealing with Terrorism in a 21st Century America.The martial arts action, and stunts in this film are first rate, and the performences of actors such as Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and the brilliantly great Michael Caine are amazing.Five stars for the ""The Dark Knight Rises"".",5,Christopher Nolan's vision is the late Bob Cain's vision- Batman is the greatest Superhero,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,2141,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'least', 'humble', 'opinion', 'favorite', 'Christian', 'Bale-', 'Chrisopher', 'Nolan', 'trilogy', 'Bane', 'character', 'fierce', 'awesome', 'Catwoman', 'character', 'brought', 'little', 'story', 'terms', 'depth', 'romance', 'implausible', 'still', 'came', 'off', 'very', 'sexy', 'quite', 'dynamic.Amazon.com', 'Commenter', 'Superhiro', 'number', 'very', 'valid', 'points', 'criticism', 'film', 'including', 'question', 'why', 'Batman-Bruce', 'Wayne', 'such', 'terrible', 'physical', 'state', 'eight', 'years', 'battle', 'Joker', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'very', 'reason', 'why', 'plot', 'situations', 'TDKR', 'are', 'Joker', 'late', 'Heath', 'ledger', 'Superhiro', 'mentioned', ""n't"", 'even', 'referenced', 'looked', 'back', 'upon', 'film.Bane', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'Terrorist', 'Group', 'plot', 'make', 'excellent', 'villain', 'angle', 'why', '8', 'years', 'night', 'Batman-Bruce', 'fought', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Bane', 'making', 'appearance', 'League', 'Shadows', 'Ninja', 'Clan', 'theme', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'so', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Jack', 'Nicolson', '1980', 'version', 'get', 'see', 'character', 'more', 'detailed', 'origins.And', 'one', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'also', 'felt', 'police', 'officer', 'Robin', 'character', 'was', 'totally', 'useless', 'not', 'needed', 'film', 'fact', 'alone', 'figured', 'out', 'brief', 'encounter', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'boy', 'Bruce', 'was', 'indeed', 'Batman', 'was', 'completely', 'ubsurd', 'not', 'believable', 'everyone', 'Gotham', 'City', 'idiot', 'character', 'What', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'how', 'Nolan', 'real', 'life', 'modern', 'world', 'issues', 'positives', 'negatives', 'out', 'certain', 'beliefs', 'political', 'policies', 'movies', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Act', 'clearly', 'art', 'copying', 'life', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'complex', 'problems', 'dealing', 'Terrorism', '21st', 'Century', 'America.The', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'stunts', 'film', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'performences', 'actors', 'such', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'brilliantly', 'great', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'are', 'amazing.Five', 'stars', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises']",N/A

1418653,A1J8KB62EV2B0X,B004LWZWGA,The Chad,"[3, 4]","I was exceptionally impressed by this trilogy as a whole. The Dark Knight blew most people away and set an extremely high standard for this one to meet. I don't think this film met the standard for pure intrigue set almost single-handedly by Heath Ledger in his role as the Joker. I was however very impressed by Tom Hardy's performance as Bane and loved the character. I have heard many complaints about Bane from random people, but he is well constructed and developed, and highly formidable. He is a completely different animal from the Joker, and as the original story told, was meant to be Batman's arch-nemesis. I loved this movie for many reasons, including the depth of plot and for the story itself. Like most great movies, I think that it takes multiple viewings to pick up on all of the subtleties woven into the plot. (Study it closely naysayers, depth is there.) Many people complain of gaps and plot holes, but I don't give those complaints as much credence due to the subtle points woven in. Nolan does a good job of succinctly referencing most of those issues to move the story along quickly, you just have to pay closer attention. So purely as entertainment, I think this movie is incredible and well worth multiple viewings.~plot spoiler alert from this point on~This movie is very important, culturally, in my opinion. Nolan clearly draws a lot of inspiration from our society today, and writes a lot of cultural parallels into the movie. Much of what I am referencing here is the class warfare instigated by the cries of Bane for the citizenry to take back their city. A certain portion of the population is fooled into following a certain number of Bane's henchmen (not to mention the criminals set free) under the pretenses of rights to other people's property. This may seem like a digression, but Catwoman's character is a huge part of this side of the story. She is the caught between the two sides throughout much of the movie. She begins as one who sympathizes with movement of the [storm that is coming]. As the movie progresses however, she transforms from one who agrees with the deluded occupiers, to someone actively (however unwilling and detached she tries to be) engaged in fighting alongside the rational opposition to Bane. Catwoman's character is necessary for Nolan because I believe he wanted to show the line of logic that a fence sitter could follow to go from one side to the other. The tipping point for Catwoman was after a family was unceremoniously ripped from their home and Catwoman stood looking at a photo of the family and said ""This was someone's home..."" to which her friend replied, ""No, this is everyone's home."" She failed to buy into the propaganda machine controlled by Bane, and subsequently began to oppose those she once stood with.There are many more details showing cultural and societal parallels written into the movie.

He is a seemingly impossible foe for ailing Batman who kept reminding me of Rocky V.Anne Hathaway makes for an interesting Catwoman who freely walks the line between good and evil.

1418657,A1DV6NTPQRWZE3,B004LWZWGA,thepete8,"[63, 96]","After the game of chess that was 'The Dark Knight', this bloated, corny, and plain idiotic movie slaps you in the face with how hard it sucks. While nothing could be as campy as Tim Burton's take on Batman, this movie certainly gives 'The Phantom Menace' a run for its money as the biggest franchise flop in recent memory. The 5-star reviews here can only be from teenage boys and/or franchise groupies who uncritically gobble down any output squeezed out by money-grubbing studios.The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is onscreen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villians are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess.And the plot holes! How any partially educated person could watch this film and not reject it outright is beyond me. We made a game out of coming up with things that made no sense:- If the room with the nuke could be flooded, why didn't Morgan Freeman do so when Bane was in the room stealing it?- Why's it hard for Bruce Wayne to prove he'd been set-up financially when all trades were shut down and he lost everything while a terrorist was controlling the stock exchange?- Why did the creepy businessman want Wayne Enterprises if it was falling apart? Why work with Bane? Hmmmm....&#34;Plan A: Try to buy Wayne out. Plan B: Hire a terrorist with a freaky mask to help me out.&#34; LOL!- In what universe is a fingerprint at the exchange enough ID to buy 5 shares of Microsoft stock, let alone lose billions?- How does low-level theif Catwoman hop onto a high-tech Batcycle and instantly know how to operate it?- If the chick with the accent wanted to kill Bruce Wayne or destroy Gotham, why not just do it? Why wait a month?- If she hates Bruce Wayne so much, why sleep with him? She gained nothing by doing that.- Liam 'League of Shadows' Neeson doesn't find out his babymama is sent to prison, nor that she was pregnant and had a kid. But he DOES hear that she was killed there? How? The only people who would have known she was killed...were in prison!- I totally believe that Bane could protect a little girl from being gang raped and killed in an Arab prison full of crazies.- Did anyone ever find this 'League of Shadows' nonsense anything less than inane and hilarious?- Why would the cops attack Bane and his men with billy clubs? Why not wait to see if the bomb is disarmed? If it's not, everyone is dead anyway. If it is, the army will be moving in.- How exactly does a nuke powered device provide endless clean energy for a whole city? Oh, don't ask that...we need a nuke in the city so Bane can use it to take control.- Where did Commissioner Gordon learn to deactivate a high tech, unstable nuke?- A technology that can wipe your record clean? Um...&#34;So, Miss Kyle, show me your work history for the last ten years? Oh you have any? Thank you for your interest, we'll let you know.&#34; Technology of this kind isn't possible.- It's nice to know if you have a broken back, chest, and whatever that you can recover in a few weeks by being punched in the back, strung up with rope overnight, and eating nothing but prison food while living in a hole in the desert. Pushups and situps work wonders too.- A hole/prison wired for TV? And you can get channels from the US.- After Batman is stabbed so that he is helpless, how does he suddenly recover enough to chase down the nuke?- After the sewers were blown up, the football field just couldn't take it. But streets with skyscrapers are AOK.- If you can just knock down sewer walls, you can access the most secret caches of technology held by rich corporations.- If the autopilot was fixed, why did Batman lie and say it wasn't? And since he knew it had been fixed, why not just haul the bomb off thirty minutes earlier and get it somewhere really far away? Why waste time in a chase to reinstall it into the sci-fi, Morgan Freeman gadget?- Exactly what medical condition related to Bane's mouth is controlled by a silly looking mask?- Really? In a big city like Gotham, every cop in the city is sent into the sewers. Every single one?I don't want to give the impression with this list that we thought deeply about this at all. We didn't. This is just what we came up with while making fun of this stupid movie. I'm sure if we applied some considered thinking, this non-script would yield a dozen more idiotic gems.

""Thomas S.""","[2, 3]","The Chris Nolan Batman trilogy has been one of the best film interpretations of a comic book character...EVER.That being said I do not really review movies as it's been said and done many times already here and elsewhere by people far more qualified than myself.  All I can say is that if I buy it on blu-ray, it's safe to say that I've already seen it on dvd or in the theater or in some other manner, and liked it enough to shell out the money for a blu-ray copy.  I'm an avid movie watcher and collector but my critiques of a movie shouldn't really matter much to you.  I've enjoyed many movies that critics have bashed and disliked many they have praised and often times agree with them.  it's all subjective, so watch it for yourself and if you like it enough, then you should buy it.  If my opinion really matters to you then I'll say it's an excellent movie and franchise and all 3 movies should be watched.  Great action.  Great acting.  Great story.I do have a gripe with the cost of new blu ray movies though.  There is no reason that blu rays should cost more than a dvd and no reason they should be at their current prices.  As far as I know, it doesn't cost much more, if at all, to produce and manufacture blu ray discs.  I understand it's a newer format...that will undoubtedly be replaced in the near future...but is that reason enough to gouge us with insane prices?  Again, blu ray DOES NOT COST MORE to produce or manufacture compared to DVDs.  The price for a completely packaged blu ray movie probably costs less than $2 and we have been charged upwards of $50...or more...for a single movie.  Ridiculous and they dare complain about losing profits to pirates.  We've all seen them market anti-piracy at the beginning of every movie.  They seem to be the biggest pirates of them all with them robbing us blind.

I've always felt there was so much more then meets the eye when it came to that character, but even I didn't see Batman's full potential until Christopher Nolan took the reigns. In all 3 of his Batman films, Nolan made the Dark Knight as realistic as possible, with characters we can relate to, real situations, and real dialogue, that's free of all the ridiculous puns it's predecessors loved so much. The third installment takes places eight years after the events of the Dark Knight, when Gotham has been safe, and the Batman wasn't needed. That is until the powerful Bane shows up. Unlike the first two, this script does not follow the original comic story and skews off in several different ways. Unless you're a longtime fan of the series, you won't realize it, but for us fans, there are some very unexpected developments, which I assume were thrown in to throw off even the most die-hard fans. As for the film, it was amazing in every way possible and was everything I expect from Christopher Nolan, but still, it lacked something and that something was an extraordinary villain. We were all spoiled in The Dark Knight with one of the best performances of all time, and while this film is remarkable, it's lacking a stand out performance from one of it's stars.

Eight years after Batman defeated the Joker and Harvey Dent's anti-crime bills became law Gotham is almost crime free. Bruce Wayne has become a shut-in and the Batman hasn't been seen in as long. When a psychotic ex-prisoner named Bane appears in Gotham and threatens to destroy Batman and the city Bruce is left to make a difficult choice. I have liked every Batman movie that has been made (except Batman & Robin) and this most recent trilogy has been amazing. They have all been really rich in story and they feel like movies and not just comic-book movies. I said when THE DARK NIGHT came out that no movie can live up to the hype of that movie but that came as close as you could. That movie set the bar for the franchise to an almost unreachable height and no sequel can really compete with that movie...but this one came as close as you could. While not as psychotic as the Joker, Bane is a great companion villain to him and is more calculating then the Joker was. There are many sub-plots going on but the movie doesn't feel jumbled at all. I have to say for Nolan to end this the way he did shows huge guts and if the studio was smart this would be the end of the franchise. While the Tim Burton movies were fun and good the Nolan trilogy had much more substance and I really don't think that the Batman character can benefit from a new director and style. He said this is his final Batman and as much as I hate to say it this should be the final movie in the franchise as well. In Hollywood though its the money and not the quality that dictates what is made. Overall, a perfect conclusion to the trilogy. I give it an A.",5,No sequel can compete with the DARK NIGHT but this is as close as you can get. Perfect ending to the trilogy.

Eight years have passed since the conclusion of the previous entry, and now Bruce Wayne is seen hiding in his room, despite concerned Alfred advising him to move on. But, when a terrorist group led by Bane arrives in Gotham City, Bruce knows what he has to do. As Commissioner Gordon tells Bruce, ""Batman has to come back.""And he does, though it takes some time. Once it happens, however, the story gets faster with more action set-pieces and some surprises. The character of Bane may not be as interesting as Heath Ledger's Joker, but he is convincing as a brutal and dangerous villain, thanks to Tom Hardy's effective performance, especially his voice.Christian Bale comes back as Bruce Wayne / Batman. There are many new characters introduced here - Anne Hathaway's martial arts fighting thief Selina Kyle and Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate - as well as some of the familiar faces like Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox and Michael Caine's Alfred Pennyworth. But to me the most impressive is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Officer Blake, who sometimes seems more heroic than Batman himself.The Christopher Nolan-directed new Batman franchise started out as the origin story of Batman, and now ends in a fitting way.",4,Fitting End to the Trilogy,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,1274,"['story', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'slowly', 'be', 'patient', 'Eight', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'conclusion', 'previous', 'entry', 'now', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'seen', 'hiding', 'room', 'concerned', 'Alfred', 'advising', 'move', 'when', 'terrorist', 'group', 'led', 'Bane', 'arrives', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Bruce', 'what', 'do', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Bruce', 'Batman', 'come', 'back', 'time', 'however', 'story', 'faster', 'more', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'surprises', 'character', 'Bane', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'interesting', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'convincing', 'brutal', 'dangerous', 'villain', 'thanks', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'effective', 'performance', 'especially', 'voice.Christian', 'Bale', 'back', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', '/', 'Batman', 'are', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'here', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighting', 'thief', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Miranda', 'Tate', 'as', 'well', 'familiar', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'Pennyworth', 'most', 'impressive', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Officer', 'Blake', 'who', 'sometimes', 'more', 'heroic', 'Batman', 'himself.The', 'Christopher', 'Nolan-directed', 'new', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'started', 'out', 'origin', 'story', 'Batman', 'now', 'fitting', 'way']",N/A
