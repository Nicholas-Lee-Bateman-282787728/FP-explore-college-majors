The pause inbetween songs was the longest of all the DVD's I have collected. It was lacking of his humor and comical spurts from both he and his musicians.The one I was most displeased with was the DVD with clips from previous presentations copied and pasted onto one and to delete the introductions and humerous comments from Andre was a mistake.Next one I purchase I will view the music presented.,3,More words spoken than music played,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,512,"['have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'only', 'two', 'Andre', 'Rieu', 'DVD', 'one', 'was', 'second', 'line', ""'not"", 'pleased', 'pause', 'inbetween', 'songs', 'was', 'longest', 'DVD', 'have', 'collected', 'was', 'lacking', 'humor', 'comical', 'spurts', 'musicians.The', 'one', 'was', 'most', 'displeased', 'was', 'DVD', 'clips', 'previous', 'presentations', 'copied', 'pasted', 'one', 'delete', 'introductions', 'humerous', 'comments', 'Andre', 'was', 'mistake.Next', 'one', 'purchase', 'will', 'view', 'music', 'presented']",N/A

Like ALL Rieu' productions, he brings the authenticity of the location/country through the costumes, songs and music, and the scenery that is edited into the DVD. His wicked sense of humor with his audience, which is prevalent in EVERY DVD HE HAS EVER MADE, is woven through the program and will draw you into the midst of the reverie. His ability to speak the main language of the country he is performing in is nothing short of genius. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT EVERY DVD HE PRODUCES HAS SUBTITLES IN WHICH EVER LANGUAGE YOU PREFER.
