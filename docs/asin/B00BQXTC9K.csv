They are not presenting opinions but using the Qu'ran to validate their statements. The film presents a very different view on the &#34;The Prophet,&#34; some may say &#34;sanitized,&#34; but the facts to stand on their own. The documentary does note where the evidence is sparce. The only point I find exception to is pointed out by another reviewer (who gave a &#34;1&#34;) that the massacre of one of the Jewish groups settled in Medina violated the treatise which had been signed and that the Jews were going along with their valued system, which denounced robbery. According to the film, Mohammed didn't give the execution order but asked the group who they would select to impart judgement; so the issue is a bit muddled. You will have to see the documentary to draw your own conclusion. One of the interviewers asserts that Muhammed is one, of the top three, greatest leaders of all times; and the film shows how the radical Islam of suicide bombers and hateful Jihad, have nothing to do, and in fact and totally opposite to what the Qu'ran teaches, and how carried out his life by example, as is has been documented.

1637685,A3Q1V16S35BSGE,B00BQXTC9K,jtrolla,"[2, 4]","This is an Islamist propaganda piece that would impress Goebbels. It is a near perfect whitewash of a totalitarian ideology which masquerades as an &#34;Abrahamic religion.&#34; It achieves its ends through a selective presentation of the facts as well as outright deception. It completely ignores Islam's triumphalist nature and that Islam, since the 7th century, has been spread through violent conquest and the brutal subjugation of the conquered populations. Islam's fundamentally violent nature is addressed only peripherally with a couple of references to contemporary out breaks of Muslim violence such as the bloody world-wide riots precipitated by a cartoon of Muhammad in a Danish newspaper. The documentary implies that Muslims are justified in resorting to violence anytime their religious sensibilities are offended.  Muhammad is presented, without any question, as an Abrahamic prophet, ignoring the almost complete disconnect between the theology of the Koran and that of the Judeo-Christian Bible. What this documentary exploits is the West's general ignorance of the Koran's barbaric contents and Islam's absolute intolerance of non Muslims, and its animus to freedom and democratic government. It also lies about the true status of women under Islam--it falsely claims that women share equality with men in all spheres when the direct opposite is the case. Women are third class citizens, behind camels, in Islamic societies. If I were to list all of the deceptions, omissions, and plain lies contained in this documentary, I'd need a book. Suffice to say, do not waste your time watching this propaganda piece if you want to learn anything of Islam's true nature.
