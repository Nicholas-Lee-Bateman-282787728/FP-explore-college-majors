It is based on a true story, and true stories always make for good movies.  It is about this basketball coach who thinks he's getting hired to train boys and instead gets the women's team.  Being a former military  man that is rather insulting.  But with the excellent advice of his insightful wife, he turns the team around and becomes a hero to the young ladies on his team.

Coach tries to get what he wants, fails, and accepts his place.  Coach bonds with team, and eventually he no longer feels lost.That said, this is a deeply touching film.  Become one with the main character as he is transformed through a series of life-altering experiences after moving to a new town as the new head basketball coach.The catch?When he arrives he finds out he wasn't promised a boys coaching position, and instead he's stuck with the girls. He knows the joke is that they can't play basketball, and now he is just waiting out the year until the boys coaching position is available.What he doesn't know, is that the joke was really on him. Follow along as he bonds with the team, as he learns to believe in the girls he coaches, and ultimately he learns to believe in himself in ways he never thought possible.""Believe In Me"" is a movie that is both deeply heartwarming and very inspirational.

I found this film to be very entertaining and heartwarming especially for the young women who got pregnant. Of course the main reason I bought this was because it starred Jeffrey Donovan who is one of my favorite actors and the star of the hit TV series ""BURN NOTICE"" along side the great Bruce Campbell. But I really should have wanted this for the story instead of just the actor. After watching it and seeing the special features it is very obvious that these girls loved Clay with all of their heart and genuinely appreciate him.This true event is about a man named Clay Driscoll who was a long time assistant basketball couch and was getting his chance at head coach for another school. So he packed his bags and his wife up and moved to the little town and was ready to coach the boys to a championship. It turns out he was not hired to coach the boys but instead was there for the girls, of course he was not fond of this turn of events, at first. So after trying to get out of it he had to at least stay on there for a year and then try a move to another school. It was during this first year that the girls grew on him and not only did he teach them the game and life basically but he learned to over come his own predigest about female athletes.The girls were horrible the first year but did every thing the were told and really tried for him, in their eyes he was the only person that ever believed in them. At the end of the year they promised him that they would be better next year for him, and they were. Still I believe the big turning point was when a girl who was kicked off of the team by her father [she then ran away with her boyfriend] became pregnant and when the baby was coming it was Clay that she wanted there. By the time his wife arrived with all of the other mothers in the town to and the doctor he had all ready delivered the baby. You best believe he was a big hit with the ladies all over the area, but it is here that his love for these girls really starts to show. Of course the film goes on to be one of the best I have seen recently especially for independent films. The fact that he had to fight an entire town and the people tat ran it to even get decent shorts for these girls is amazing. In small town America and this is still true for the most part today all that is really cared about as far as school athletics is the boys.Writer/director Robert Collector did a great job on this film and I believe that the version of this film that is now available is his director's cut. And of course you know that Donovan is excellent in this film as is the excellent Bob Gunton. Bruce Dern the dude that runs every thing was excellent as well but it is the girls they cast in this film that surprised me. I was expecting those three and Samantha Mathis who played Donovan's wife to do well in this but the girls really were great and believable in this. All from the production side to the acting side did great jobs on this.This may not be the best movie ever but it truly is one of the most entertaining films of its kind. I recommend buying this one and just skipping the rental, if for nothing else but to support films like this. We need more of them in this time, great uplifting true stories about the human spirit.",4,JEFFREY DONOVAN,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,3426,"['BELIEVE', 'IN', 'METhis', 'excellent', 'inspirational', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'Clay', 'Driscoll', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'hope', 'small', 'town', 'women', 'who', 'lived', 'there', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'heartwarming', 'especially', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'got', 'pregnant', 'course', 'main', 'reason', 'bought', 'was', 'starred', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'who', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'star', 'hit', 'TV', 'series', 'BURN', 'NOTICE', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'wanted', 'story', 'instead', 'just', 'actor', 'watching', 'seeing', 'special', 'features', 'very', 'obvious', 'girls', 'loved', 'Clay', 'heart', 'genuinely', 'appreciate', 'him.This', 'true', 'event', 'man', 'named', 'Clay', 'Driscoll', 'who', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'assistant', 'basketball', 'couch', 'was', 'getting', 'chance', 'head', 'coach', 'school', 'packed', 'bags', 'wife', 'up', 'moved', 'little', 'town', 'was', 'ready', 'coach', 'boys', 'championship', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'hired', 'coach', 'boys', 'instead', 'was', 'girls', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'fond', 'turn', 'events', 'first', 'So', 'trying', 'get', 'had', 'least', 'stay', 'year', 'then', 'try', 'move', 'school', 'was', 'first', 'year', 'girls', 'grew', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'teach', 'game', 'life', 'basically', 'learned', 'come', 'own', 'predigest', 'female', 'athletes.The', 'girls', 'were', 'horrible', 'first', 'year', 'did', 'thing', 'were', 'told', 'really', 'tried', 'eyes', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'ever', 'believed', 'end', 'year', 'promised', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'next', 'year', 'were', 'Still', 'believe', 'big', 'turning', 'point', 'was', 'when', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'kicked', 'team', 'father', '[', 'then', 'ran', 'away', 'boyfriend', ']', 'became', 'pregnant', 'when', 'baby', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'Clay', 'wanted', 'there', 'time', 'wife', 'arrived', 'other', 'mothers', 'town', 'doctor', 'had', 'ready', 'delivered', 'baby', 'best', 'believe', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'ladies', 'area', 'here', 'love', 'girls', 'really', 'show', 'course', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'especially', 'independent', 'films', 'fact', 'had', 'fight', 'entire', 'town', 'people', 'tat', 'ran', 'even', 'get', 'decent', 'shorts', 'girls', 'amazing', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'still', 'true', 'most', 'part', 'today', 'really', 'cared', 'as', 'far', 'school', 'athletics', 'boys.Writer/director', 'Robert', 'Collector', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'believe', 'version', 'film', 'now', 'available', 'director', 'cut', 'course', 'know', 'Donovan', 'excellent', 'film', 'excellent', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'dude', 'thing', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'girls', 'cast', 'film', 'surprised', 'was', 'expecting', 'three', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'who', 'played', 'Donovan', 'wife', 'do', 'well', 'girls', 'really', 'were', 'great', 'believable', 'production', 'side', 'acting', 'side', 'did', 'great', 'jobs', 'this.This', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', 'kind', 'recommend', 'buying', 'one', 'just', 'skipping', 'rental', 'nothing', 'else', 'support', 'films', 'need', 'more', 'time', 'great', 'uplifting', 'true', 'stories', 'human', 'spirit']",N/A

Nightmare #2 is that it is a consistently loosing girl's team.  Girl's basketball isn't taken seriously till Driscoll decides to give it a try.  You know he'll make a difference.You will fall into being a fan of the small Oklahoma town team.  You will cheer the team and boo the villain heading the school board.  It is a story well written and acted, so well, in fact, that it seems a true story.  Perhaps that's because it is based on the real story of Jim Keith and the Lady Cyclones (Oklahoma famous.)  And the older, real, original team and coach, gets to play as extras in the movie.  The coach is a true-to-life basketball hero.  Nobody can write realistic stories like true life.  This coach's life and his teams will take you on an emotional spiral--UPWARD.""Believe In Me"" Coach Driscoll and his wife have no children even though they want one so adoption is considered.  The story sounds a bit like a girl's basketball answer to the boy's football story of ""Facing the Giants.""  Both are great and recommended.Being a Hoosier, and growing up in what the Indiana state calls ""Hoosier Hysteria,"" I find this a story very rewarding.Bonuses:  Violence equals only a donnybrook on the court.  The nudes in the shower scene show nothing.  Druggies are nonexistent.  Bottom line--it's a family film--and the girl's acting can play a pretty mean game of basketball, more like the girls of the 21st century.One goofy highlight to watch for: see girl's basketball being played by one team in dresses.  Now that's shocking!  You'll have to remote in reverse and see it again, not believing your eyes.

When he found out he'd be coaching girls he wasn't happy about it at all. It was a challenge for him in the beginning because he never coached girls, nor did he want to, and it didn't help that most of these players had no skills.Driscoll and his wife had moved to a town where most of the people did not support girl's sports. Very few took the girls team seriously and the Lady Cyclones certainly didn't get the respect or support the boys basketball team received. Ellis Brawley had something against Clay (a strong-willed man with a mind of his own) from the day Clay showed up and Brawley had others on his side; even the Pastor of the church, which was sad to see. It was a good thing Clay was totally supported by some and especially his wife, who was there to lift him up when he was down and to give him wise counsel when he needed it. The longer Clay coached these teen players the closer they all became and the more confidence these girls had. Thanks to selfless acts, hard work and speaking up for change, things got better in time with the Lady Cyclones - they went from a losing team few people had heard of to a team that made it to the state finals. And Coach Driscoll was also blessed in his personal life.This entertaining and touching movie is based on the young adult novel, Brief Garland, written by Newbury award-winning author, Harold Keith. It is the true story of his nephew Jim Keith who is shown during the end credits.

It's basketball but he's been hired to coach the girls, not the boys. Based on the true story of Jim Owens, one of the greatest high school coaches in Oklahoma history, this was back when girls were truly considered second class by most in the sports world and the Middleton community barely gave them that much recognition. Clay Driscoll fights the school board, the parents and the man who runs the community with an iron fist to gain equality and respect for the girls' program. A terrific, family friendly film about the difference one person can make in a school, in a community, and in the lives of young people. It's the female version of HOOSIERS. It's well done and will grab your heart watching these young athletes fight back to gain the respect of their community and eventually, the entire state.

1079331,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000R7G6H2,Roland E. Zwick,"[11, 17]","Sort of a distaff version of ""Glory Road,"" ""Believe in Me"" tells the true life story of a girls' high school basketball coach in 1960's Oklahoma who, by instilling the values of hard work, perseverance and teamwork into his players, leads his underdog team to victory in the state championships.  In this case, it is not the girls who give the coach the majority of his headaches but rather the town leaders, who don't believe that girls' sports should be accorded the same level of respect and financial support that has always been given, without question, to the boys.As conceived by writer/director Robert Collector, ""Believe in Me"" floats along quite contentedly on a sea of inspirational-sports-movie cliches.  Yet, despite its overall predictability and corniness, the movie contains enough genuinely touching moments to make it worth recommending.  Moreover, Jeffrey Donovan is so earnest and appealing and brings such a self-effacing modesty to the role of the coach that he draws us into the character and the story almost against our will.  Samantha Mathis is also effective as the wife whose words of wisdom and support sustain him in his most difficult hours.  Bruce Dern is stuck playing what is probably the most one-dimensional character in the movie - the grumpy town leader who does everything in his power to undercut Coach Driscoll's efforts on behalf of his team.  The girls are pleasant enough as a group, but none steps out of the background long enough to make herself a compelling individual.This is definitely a minor addition to the list of memorable movies about team sports, but given its limitations and modest ambitions, it makes for passable viewing.",3,derivative but sometimes touching sports story,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,1682,"['Sort', 'distaff', 'version', 'Glory', 'Road', 'Believe', 'Me', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'girls', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'coach', '1960', 'Oklahoma', 'who', 'instilling', 'values', 'hard', 'work', 'perseverance', 'teamwork', 'players', 'underdog', 'team', 'victory', 'state', 'championships', 'case', 'not', 'girls', 'who', 'give', 'coach', 'majority', 'headaches', 'rather', 'town', 'leaders', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'girls', 'sports', 'should', 'be', 'accorded', 'same', 'level', 'respect', 'financial', 'support', 'always', 'been', 'given', 'question', 'boys.As', 'conceived', 'writer/director', 'Robert', 'Collector', 'Believe', 'Me', 'floats', 'quite', 'contentedly', 'sea', 'inspirational-sports-movie', 'cliches', 'overall', 'predictability', 'corniness', 'movie', 'enough', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments', 'make', 'worth', 'recommending', 'Moreover', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'so', 'earnest', 'appealing', 'brings', 'such', 'self-effacing', 'modesty', 'role', 'coach', 'character', 'story', 'almost', 'will', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'also', 'effective', 'wife', 'words', 'wisdom', 'support', 'sustain', 'most', 'difficult', 'hours', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'stuck', 'playing', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'movie', 'grumpy', 'town', 'leader', 'who', 'everything', 'power', 'undercut', 'Coach', 'Driscoll', 'efforts', 'behalf', 'team', 'girls', 'are', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'group', 'none', 'steps', 'background', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'compelling', 'individual.This', 'definitely', 'minor', 'addition', 'list', 'memorable', 'movies', 'team', 'sports', 'given', 'limitations', 'modest', 'ambitions', 'passable', 'viewing']",N/A
1079332,ADLN37B0153N,B000R7G6H2,Silmarwen,"[16, 16]","This is a charming, feel-good sports film based on the real life of Coach Jim Keith. I believe that the movie is loosely based on Coach Keith's first coaching position in the 1960s. He showed up to coach boys' basketball and was assigned to coach girls' basketball instead. To add insult to injury, the girls were one of the worst teams in the state of Oklahoma and were not used to having a regular training regimen. I am not sure how many of the subplots in the film were based on fact or were entirely fabricated, but these secondary stories really added to the main story of the girls' struggle to win the state championships against all odds. This, like so many good sports drama films, is a movie that uses a sports team to tell a story about a place and a time and is really about so much more than basketball. It also tells the story of girls' sports not being as important as boys' sports, school district power struggles, domineering parents refusing to let their girls play sports, young marriages & pregnancies, adopting children and more. I felt that the director did a fine job setting the scene for this film and everything seemed very believable.The movie has a very mellow, easygoing pace, which I felt represented the 1960s setting well. The beginning was a little slow for me, but it picked up not too far in as I got involved in the characters lives. I wish that there had been a little bit more distinction between the players as I had a hard time keeping them straight. This was difficult as there was not real superstar player on the team so there wasn't even a few players that I could keep track of. Still, the girls all seemed to do a decent job and really got into their roles with the costumes, hair and make-up. The music was lovely and it was fun to hear some of the older songs again. I wish that they had incorporated the music better, though, as it always seemed that a song started playing out of the blue and that is what I would focus on and then it would stop rather abruptly. There is so much good music from the time period that I feel they could have woven it in and out of the story a bit better.If you like feel-good dramas, sports dramas or biopics, then give this little charmer a chance. There are not many girls' sports movies out there, especially ones where they start from such lowly beginnings and are able to achieve so much. A great empowering film for families to watch together.",3,"3.5 Stars - Surprisingly Enjoyable, ""Feel Good"" Sports Drama",1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,2432,"['charming', 'feel-good', 'sports', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'Coach', 'Jim', 'Keith', 'believe', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'Coach', 'Keith', 'first', 'coaching', 'position', '1960s', 'showed', 'up', 'coach', 'boys', 'basketball', 'was', 'assigned', 'coach', 'girls', 'basketball', 'instead', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'girls', 'were', 'one', 'worst', 'teams', 'state', 'Oklahoma', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'having', 'regular', 'training', 'regimen', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'subplots', 'film', 'were', 'based', 'fact', 'were', 'entirely', 'fabricated', 'secondary', 'stories', 'really', 'added', 'main', 'story', 'girls', 'struggle', 'win', 'state', 'championships', 'odds', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'sports', 'drama', 'films', 'movie', 'sports', 'team', 'tell', 'story', 'place', 'time', 'really', 'about', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'basketball', 'also', 'story', 'girls', 'sports', 'not', 'being', 'as', 'important', 'boys', 'sports', 'school', 'district', 'power', 'struggles', 'domineering', 'parents', 'refusing', 'let', 'girls', 'play', 'sports', 'young', 'marriages', 'pregnancies', 'adopting', 'children', 'more', 'felt', 'director', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'setting', 'scene', 'film', 'everything', 'seemed', 'very', 'believable.The', 'movie', 'very', 'mellow', 'easygoing', 'pace', 'felt', 'represented', '1960s', 'setting', 'well', 'beginning', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'picked', 'up', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'got', 'involved', 'characters', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'distinction', 'players', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'keeping', 'straight', 'was', 'difficult', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'superstar', 'player', 'team', 'so', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'few', 'players', 'could', 'keep', 'track', 'Still', 'girls', 'seemed', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'really', 'got', 'roles', 'costumes', 'hair', 'make-up', 'music', 'was', 'lovely', 'was', 'fun', 'hear', 'older', 'songs', 'again', 'wish', 'had', 'incorporated', 'music', 'better', 'though', 'always', 'seemed', 'song', 'started', 'playing', 'blue', 'what', 'would', 'focus', 'then', 'would', 'stop', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'music', 'time', 'period', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'woven', 'story', 'bit', 'feel-good', 'dramas', 'sports', 'dramas', 'biopics', 'then', 'give', 'little', 'charmer', 'chance', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'girls', 'sports', 'movies', 'there', 'especially', 'ones', 'where', 'start', 'such', 'lowly', 'beginnings', 'are', 'able', 'achieve', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'empowering', 'film', 'families', 'watch', 'together']",N/A
