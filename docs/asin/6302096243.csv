I think what also made this work was that the director knew what to cut to give the essence of the play to film without some of the extraneous elements. Yes, Fortenbras is gone and we don't see as much extra chasing around of the ghost, but all the great parts of Hamlet are there.

Gates ""Christian, Mother, Daughter,...","[68, 71]","Once again, I'd like to give a half-star rating, but alas . . .As my by-line indicates, I am a former high school teacher.  Without exception, this is the version of Hamlet that is a class-room favorite.  (I show 2 others: Branaugh (2nd place) and the film starring Ethan Hawke (everyone hates it).)  It is accessible to younger viewers and is just a beautiful film all around.The filming, camera work and sets are impeccable.  One is instantly transported into the world these characters inhabit.  As to the script, it IS heavily edited; however, most of what is omitted (see note below) is ""shown"" to the audience through visual media.  This isn't a ""filmed version of the play""; it is a film based on the play.  In that framework, it is quite well done.  I particularly like the beginning scenes that make Hamlet's description of his mother - ""Like Niobe, all tears"" - come to life.The acting, to my thinking, is superb.  The emphasis here is on Hamlet's relationship to his mother, Gertrude. That comes through quite clearly.  Gibson's Hamlet comes across as a soldier - a man of action - who agonizes over the eternal consequences of his acts.  He is believable in the role, masterful in some ways.  Likewise the supporting cast.  Helena Bonham-Carter and Glenn Close provide particularly vibrant portrayals of their characters.So, why not 5 stars?  Without the ""Fortinbras"" subplot, some of the urgency in the play seems missing.  While definitely a secondary story-line, it provides a framework that adds tension to the play as a whole as the war is waged both outside the castle walls and within.Overall, this production gets an A.

295329,A1S26JXPQKFVPI,6302096243,Alexander Arsov,"[2, 2]","Zeffirelli's ""Hamlet"" is nowhere near as good as his fantastic ""Romeo and Juliet"" but it is nonetheless fine a movie for that. The screenplay, significantly, is ''based on the play by William Shakespeare'', which should prepare one for considerable liberties with the original text. These are judiciously done. The numerous cuts, almost but not quite as extensive as in the Olivier's version, detract little from the power of the original. There are some imaginative new scenes and redistributions of lines. For instance, the movie opens, not on the platform with Barnardo and Francisco trying not to die of cold and fear, but with the funeral of the old Hamlet. The sets and the costumes are in Zeffirelli's typical style, sumptuous and historically accurate, and there is little to complain about his imaginative direction. Choosing a crypt for ''To be, or not to be'' is a brilliant idea: it finely evokes the preoccupation with death in the words.Even today, after such towering performances as in ""Brave Heart"" and ""The Patriot"", Mel Gibson, leaving aside matters of age, is not a very likely choice for Hamlet. Franco must have created quite a scandal in 1990, for then the most profound work of Mel Gibson still was Lethal Weapon. Shaking off several tons of silly prejudices, Mel does a great job. He is quite a bit more passionate than Olivier but generally very convincingly so. He seldom resorts to histrionics. The most notable examples are the two places where overacting is essential: the Closet Scene and the confrontation with Ophelia. All in all, a remarkable performance that exceeded my expectations by far.The supporting cast is top-notch. Alan Bates is a crafty Claudius, if a little stilted in his soliloquies. Glenn Close manages well the ungrateful part of Gertrude; her death scene is superbly done. Helena Bonham Carter as a suitably innocent Ophelia and Ian Holm as a buffoonish Polonius complete the list of actors who have no reason to be ashamed of their performances. It was a pleasure to see again John McEnery as a very serious, even sinister, Osrik; 22 years earlier he was a fantastic Mercutio in Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet.One last note about Zeffirelli's version. If your DVD contains the documentary ''Mel Gibson: To be, or not to be'', don't miss it. Such fun! It is Mel himself who is the narrator and he is very witty. They went to Scotland for some outdoor shooting and everything was great, except the weather: they looked for something dark and angry but it was like Miami. Together with many similar jokes, Mel has some extremely perceptive things to say. In addition to his perfect description of the character quoted above, I liked best his casual remark during rehearsals that he would like to try this on the stage, night after night, constantly making it better. He ended laughing: ''You know, I wouldn't mind shooting the whole thing again.''There are also many charming outtakes and behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast and the director. You just have to see, to take but one example, Franco's hilarious parody of hammy acting in ''To be, or not to be''. It is indeed seldom that I find among the additional materials on a DVD something that is so entertaining and so worth watching.",4,Fine adaptation of complex and multilayered tragedy,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,3244,"['Zeffirelli', 'Hamlet', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'fantastic', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'nonetheless', 'fine', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'significantly', 'based', 'play', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'should', 'prepare', 'one', 'considerable', 'liberties', 'original', 'text', 'are', 'judiciously', 'done', 'numerous', 'cuts', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'extensive', 'Olivier', 'version', 'detract', 'little', 'power', 'original', 'are', 'imaginative', 'new', 'scenes', 'redistributions', 'lines', 'instance', 'movie', 'not', 'platform', 'Barnardo', 'Francisco', 'trying', 'not', 'die', 'cold', 'fear', 'funeral', 'old', 'Hamlet', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'Zeffirelli', 'typical', 'style', 'sumptuous', 'historically', 'accurate', 'little', 'complain', 'imaginative', 'direction', 'Choosing', 'crypt', 'be', 'not', 'be', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'finely', 'preoccupation', 'death', 'words.Even', 'today', 'such', 'towering', 'performances', 'Brave', 'Heart', 'Patriot', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'leaving', 'aside', 'matters', 'age', 'not', 'very', 'likely', 'choice', 'Hamlet', 'Franco', 'must', 'have', 'created', 'scandal', '1990', 'then', 'most', 'profound', 'work', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'still', 'was', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Shaking', 'off', 'several', 'tons', 'silly', 'prejudices', 'Mel', 'great', 'job', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'passionate', 'Olivier', 'generally', 'very', 'convincingly', 'so', 'seldom', 'histrionics', 'most', 'notable', 'examples', 'are', 'two', 'places', 'where', 'overacting', 'essential', 'Closet', 'Scene', 'confrontation', 'Ophelia', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'far.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'top-notch', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'crafty', 'Claudius', 'little', 'stilted', 'soliloquies', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'well', 'ungrateful', 'part', 'Gertrude', 'death', 'scene', 'superbly', 'done', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'suitably', 'innocent', 'Ophelia', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'buffoonish', 'Polonius', 'complete', 'list', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'ashamed', 'performances', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'again', 'John', 'McEnery', 'very', 'serious', 'even', 'sinister', 'Osrik', '22', 'years', 'earlier', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Mercutio', 'Zeffirelli', 'Romeo', 'Juliet.One', 'last', 'note', 'Zeffirelli', 'version', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'be', 'not', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Such', 'fun', 'Mel', 'who', 'narrator', 'very', 'witty', 'went', 'Scotland', 'outdoor', 'shooting', 'everything', 'was', 'great', 'weather', 'looked', 'something', 'dark', 'angry', 'was', 'Miami', 'Together', 'many', 'similar', 'jokes', 'Mel', 'extremely', 'perceptive', 'things', 'say', 'addition', 'perfect', 'description', 'character', 'quoted', 'liked', 'best', 'casual', 'remark', 'rehearsals', 'would', 'like', 'try', 'stage', 'night', 'night', 'constantly', 'making', 'better', 'ended', 'laughing', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'shooting', 'whole', 'thing', 'again', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'charming', 'outtakes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'interviews', 'cast', 'director', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'take', 'one', 'example', 'Franco', 'hilarious', 'parody', 'hammy', 'acting', 'be', 'not', 'be', 'indeed', 'seldom', 'find', 'additional', 'materials', 'DVD', 'something', 'so', 'entertaining', 'so', 'worth', 'watching']",Hamlet VHS

Compared to the superb Kenneth Branaugh version, Gibson's Hamlet seems dazed, drugged, and lackluster. His lines are spoken with no particular emphasis - everything sounds flat and dull. Initially, I felt this was an attempt to portray Hamlet as dazed and overwhelmed by his father's death, but even his descent into madness seems dull and lifeless and pales strongly in comparison to the manic babbling and hyper antics of Branaugh's Hamlet. I appreciate an attempt at a numb, grief-stricken performance, but it just doesn't work dramatically, and Hamlet requires more energy than Gibson displays here.I will also add that Glenn Close, whom I usually respect, seems overly campy and bubbly here, with very little attempt at any facade of widowhood. This contrasts, too, with the Branaugh version, where Gertrude is superbly displayed as a politic queen, with a perfect facade of mourning, overlaying an underlying joy. This duplicity is more intriguing than the dancing, giggling child-queen we get from Close, and I found it strikingly simplistic.Also very annoying is that several scenes are cut out of place, lines are spoken out of order, and soliloquies are cut short. This chops the drama badly and while I understand that some people feel that Shakespeare must be made more brief in order to be more accessible, there must be a better way with this.This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing.

295334,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6302096243,Andrew Raker,"[4, 4]","Overall, the acting is pretty good (and not quite as over-the-top as in the Branagh adaptation). Also, unlike the Branagh adaptation, this film is shown in its time-appropriate setting. However, in this film, Fortinbras and all references to Norway are excluded. In fact, this 1991 film condenses the play considerably (almost by 1/2). In my opinion, eliminating the Fortinbras subplot was particularly disappointing, even though one can understand the reasons for doing so.Below, I have listed most of the changes (as well as some other staging comments). [What follows assumes a considerable understanding of the text of Shakespeare's Hamlet.]Act 1, Scene 1 is excluded.- Film begins with Hamlet's father being laid to rest in the crypt, with Gertrude crying over King Hamlet's body.Act 1, Scene 2 is considerably condensed.Act 1, Scene 3 is slightly condensed.- In the conversation between Polonius and Laertes, Polonius speaks only the most a few of the most famous lines such as ""to thine own self be true.""- When Polonius tells Ophelia not to speak with Hamlet, Hamlet overhears the conversation.Act 1, Scene 4 is slightly condensed.Act 1, Scene 5 is slightly condensed.- Hamlet actually appears somewhat afraid of his father's ghost.- Hamlet speaks with his father's ghost on the battlements of the castle.- Hamlet only insists that Horatio and Marcellus swear on his sword 1 time.Act 2, Scene 1 is excluded.Act 2, Scene 2 begins around line 80 and is slightly condensed.- When Polonius talks with Hamlet, Hamlet, in his madness, has one shoe on and one shoe off.After Act 2, Scene 2 line 215, adaptation shifts to Act 3, Scene 1, which is slightly condensed.- Hamlet, when he meets with Ophelia in the lobby, spies the shadows of someone. Hamlet assumes that he is being spied upon and begins speaking louder to insure that those spying on him hear him.- Hamlet grabs Ophelia's face rather violently when he accuses her of using cosmetics.- Hamlet speaks his ""to be or not to be"" speech alone in the crypt near his father's coffin after his meeting with Ophelia. [In other words, Ophelia, Claudius, and Polonius do not hear Hamlet's ""to be or not to be"" speech.]Act 2, Scene 2, after line 215 is slightly condensed until line 305, at which point the scene is greatly condensed.- Hamlet behaves violently toward R & G when R & G remain silent after Hamlet asks them whether the King or Queen sent for them.- Hamlet does not learn the players have been displaced by a younger troop.- The players do not present speech to Hamlet at lines 448 to 498.- Hamlet's ""O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I"" speech is considerably condensed.Act 3, Scene 2 is considerably condensed.- Hamlet does not tell the players not to overact.- Male actors play the female roles.- Many of the less important lines of dialogue are cut from the play within the play.- Claudius is very distraught and disoriented after he witnesses the poisoning in the play within the play.- Hamlet forces the flute up against [G's] neck when he accuses R & G or trying to play him like a flute.- Lines 342 and after are eliminated (i.e. Polonius does not appear telling Hamlet to see his mother).Act 3, Scene 3 is considerably condensed.- First 70 lines are excluded.- Most of Claudius' lines as he prays are excluded.Act 3, Scene 4 is slightly condensed.- Hamlet appears unhappy that he has murdered Polonius, mistaking him for Claudius.- Even though Hamlet stabs Polonius, Polonius does not bleed much.- Hamlet behaves rather violently towards his mother, in this scene.Act 4, Scene 1 is considerably condensed.Act 4, Scene 2 is eliminated.Act 4, Scene 3 is slightly condensed.Act 4, Scene 4 is eliminated.- That is, Hamlet does not meet Fortinbras or his soldiers because they are not part of this adaptation.Act 4, Scene 5 is slightly condensed.- Once Hamlet has left for England, Ophelia begins to go mad. [As in the Folio text, it is difficult to know whether Ophelia's madness is the result of her father's murder or Hamlet's rejection of her love.]* However, a scene is added that shows Hamlet replacing R&G;' letters with 2 of his own. Then, the film shifts to a short scene in which R&G; get their heads chopped off.- Laertes angry return is left largely intact, although Laertes does not appear to have a mob of angry citizens behind him.Act 4, Scene 6 is excluded.Act 4, Scene 7 is moved until after Act 5, Scene 1.- The only scene that is included before this point is Gertrude's telling Claudius and Laertes that Ophelia has drowned.Act 5, Scene 1 is slightly condensed.- Lines are excluded in which gravediggers say that if Laertes did not have friends in high places, she would not have received a Christian burial.- Lines are excluded in which gravediggers talk about how a gravedigger's house lasts until doomsday.Act 4, Scene 7 is considerably condensed.- Claudius and Laertes' plot against Hamlet is shown after Ophelia's burial because at Ophelia's burial is the first time Claudius learns that Hamlet was not murdered in England. [In other words, Act 4, Scene 6 is excluded - no evidence that Hamlet was captured by pirates.]Act 5, Scene 2 is considerably condensed especially before line 162. After line 162, the scene is only slightly condensed.- Osric's speech is very short and to the point.- Before the dueling match, Claudius openly drops a pearl-shaped pill into the wine glass. [Why? I do not know. It seems to defeat the purpose of a secret murder.]- Laertes only switches to the poisoned sword after Gertrude drinks the poisoned wine.- Horatio does not offer to kill himself by drinking some of the poisoned wine.* Film ends with an aerial shot of Hamlet dead on the ground and Horatio lying over Hamlet's body while the crowd looks on stunned at the events that occurred. [Note: We never know who gains the crowd of Denmark since Fortinbras is not a part of the film.]",3,Good adaptation but too condensed; recommend Branagh adaptaton,1287273600,"10 17,

In retrospect, Braveheart and Gibson's own masterpiece, The Passion, should have alerted me that Mel was a serious artist with extensive vision far before his later achievements came along. Here, more venturesome viewers than I, discovered that Gibson was not a bubblegum actor but a figure worthy of association with the bard. With this film we see a rather early glimpse of what Mel Gibson would become. There is a boyous impetuousity and energy to his performance that makes him infinitely believable. Helena Bonham-Carter is her princessularly beautiful self. As a feminine figure of wonder she has few peers. Ian Holm, as always, is first class. The same can be said of Glenn Close.

295338,A48THA5X4OUAB,6302096243,Billyjack D'Urberville,"[2, 2]","This is a fresh and vivid version of Hamlet, and merits repeated viewing despite some eccentricities.  The strengths are its solid core, with Gibson's excellent embodiment of the hero and the best Ophelia in modern productions, Helen Bonham Carter.  Alan Bates' scruffy, dissolute Claudius is also both soundly conceived and executed.  The sets are highly realistic and there is a grand amount of outdoor photography making it spectacular to behold again and again.The chief weakness is a way, way overplayed Freudian interpretation of Hamlet and his mother, which almost spoils the movie.  Otherwise Glenn Close as Gertrude is at her professional best.The 2 hour rush through the play is breath taking, but sacrifices some fine points such as Rozencrantz and Gildenstern, and the ghost of Hamlet's father which sadly misuses an earnest Paul Schofield.  These are minor arguments; there is always room for experimenting with the play.  It is funny however that Zeffereli, usually a first rate Shakespearean interpreter, shoots so finally wide of target here.  But with a play of this nature you have to take what you can get, and I have never seen the funeral of Ophelia better done, and Hamlet's defining leap into her grave.

295339,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6302096243,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[5, 6]","When Director Franco Zeffirelli is at the director's helm, the  results are nothing short of phenomenal. Along with the Sir Laurence Oliver version, this is the one I watch the most. As usual, Franco Zeffirelli adds his phenomenal, but dignified scenery, his music that flatters the content, and a great cast that actually become the characters. For those of you who don't know the story, it revolves around Hamlet. I really don't like Mel Gibson, but there is no denying the fact that he handles the role of Hamlet very well. (His sorrow, his contemplation, his sudden rages, his seeming madness, etc.) He suspects his uncle Claudius murdered his brother (Hamlet's father) to steal the crown and the elder Hamlet's widow. His beliefs are confirmed when he meets the ghost of his father who tells that story. (The ghost by the way is portrayed phenomenally by Paul Scofield who portrays human sorrow and dignity.) However, Hamlet can not just kill Claudius. (He has no evidence, and Claudius is an EFFECTIVE AND LIKABLE  king. The murder of Claudius will not be accepted on some ghost story.) We also meet the bumbling, but good hearted Polonius played well by Ian Holm. His son Laertes is played well by Parker. (Parker has Laertes's love for his father and sister down as well as his sudden rages.) Helena Boham Carter gives beauty and dignity to Ophelia. Glenn Close does a fairly good job as Hamlet's mother. A big extra kudos goes to Alan Bates for his phenomenal portrayal of Claudius. This is a complex character that many people don't fully understand. He is the villain who murdered his brother and stole the crown. But like Macbeth, he DOES have a conscience, and he does feel sorrow and regret. (Richard III could have easily sat through a play of what he had done without even flinching! Claudius IS NOT that sort of person!) He is also a good king except for what he did to get the crown. (He is especially likable when he quells Laertes's raid with pure courage and intelligence. And he IS being honest when he says he was guiltless of Polonius's death!) As Hamlet begins plotting his moves, even at the point of appearing mad, Claudius is NOT fooled. He sees the madness exactly for what it is. (An element in a plot against him.) Except for Hamlet, Claudius is by far the most intelligent character in the story, and just as Hamlet is waiting for his chance, Claudius is waiting for his chance. (But he can't just kill Hamlet either. Like himself, Hamlet is too well liked.) So, it is a race as to whether Hamlet can prove that Claudius killed the elder Hamlet or if Claudius can prove that Hamlet is plotting treason first. To be sure, this movie cuts a little under 2 hours from this 4 hour play. But Director Franco Zeffirelli was really careful about what he deleted.  (Even the Sir Laurence Olivier version was 2 hours and change.) But despite the missing material, nothing is obviously missing. In fact, it would seem that rather than trying to memorize 4 hours of script, the actors concentrated on what was essential, and they BECAME the characters for 2 hours. Whether it is Hamlet, Claudius, The Ghost of Hamlet's Father, Gertrude, Polonius, Laertes, Ophelia, Horatio, Guildenstern, Rosencratz, the players, or even the grave digger, can any one person be accused of not having the role down? In all honesty, there is not a dull moment in this production. Finally, to Director Franco Zeffirelli's credit, he juggled the scenes around to make more sense. (One example is that he deletes the first scene with the ghost of Hamlet's father. We just see his funeral. This makes it all the more frightening when Hamlet's friends tell him that they have seen his father.) Overall, this follows Sir Laurence Olivier's ""Hamlet"" very well. The dvd has 2 nice extras.

The film version is one-half the time the play normally takes, yet is well paced, the vital lines kept, and the diction clear and excellent.

Miss the words and you may as well not watch.  The other big problem with Shakespeare films: they tend to be too theatrical, which makes the words wooden, sterilizes the plot.  That problem is avoided, here.  Here we see Hamlet traditional, even curtailed: yet lively, real.  Good momentum, not tedium.  You identify with the characters, even if you know the lines by heart.

295350,AAE2DUEMTR30I,6302096243,DAVID BRYSON,"[4, 4]","It was about twenty years ago that I turned on my television idly one evening to find that a showing of Hamlet had just started. I was instantly transfixed and not just because this is my favourite play of all plays, but because I was looking at my absolute idea of what a Prince Hamlet should look like. It was another two hours before I found who was in the title role, but throughout that two hours I watched the action and listened to the dialogue and monologues acted and spoken by as perfect a piece of casting as I think I have ever yet seen.Let me say that I have seen Olivier's Hamlet and I have seen Branagh's Hamlet and that I hugely enjoyed them both. I am not greatly concerned in this notice to weigh up niceties of interpretation and direction, because there are enough subtleties and possibilities in this great play to allow full scope for the individual style of every great actor for another thousand years. The literary criticism trade, profession or industry, though it has not yet talked Hamlet to death, has been trying hard to do that, and I would not like to be, without intending it, the straw that broke that camel's back. What puts this production in a class of its own for me is simply that for me Gibson IS Hamlet whereas Olivier and Branagh are acting Hamlet, albeit superbly. The blond fringe and the smallish physique are right for a start, in my mind. Then there is the understated style, the diction quiet, the mood brooding and smouldering. That is my idea of how to do the great soliloquies, not declaiming them, and when the repressed tension is abruptly released as, say, when Hamlet runs his sword through the arras, the contrast is all the more effective and does not require histrionics. Does Olivier perhaps over-act a bit? To my way of thinking he nearly always does, and in Hamlet his final `then venom to thy weh-eh-eh-eh-eh-rk!' definitely goes over the top even if nothing else does.The supporting cast have won high praise, and I shall join in that too. Perhaps no other play by Shakespeare, unless maybe Coriolanus, is quite so dominated by its lead role as is Hamlet. Nevertheless the best Hamlet in the world could be undone if Claudius or Gertrude or Polonius or Ophelia or Laertes were not up to scratch, whereas if he has the kind of `support' provided here a performance that is already superb seems better than ever. One feature of the production, attributable to both the acting and the directing, struck me forcibly this time in a way it had not struck me before, and it relates to the character of Claudius. Up until the play-within-the-play his sang-froid is remarkable considering the primal crime he has committed, and even though his guilty conscience comes to the surface in the chapel, he carries his burden lightly, to all appearances. The play-within drives him to further desperate stratagems, but what came across to me was just how cool and inventive he remained. He tries to have Hamlet executed in England, and when that fails he arranges for not one but two types of poison to ensure the outcome of Hamlet's duel. Most strikingly of all, when Gertrude drinks the poisoned goblet he still controls his reaction to avoid giving himself away. Iago impressed Goethe enough to serve as the prototype of Goethe's Mephistopheles, but Iago's actions were small beer compared with this, and his planning was nowhere near as clever. Iago has had more attention from the commentators because he shares more of the limelight, but at the end of Othello he runs away as if Shakespeare did not even think him worth killing. Claudius may have deserved everything that Hamlet called him, but his defects did not include lack of quick thinking or want of nerve.The production, but for the fact that this is a slightly abridged Hamlet, suits me admirably. The camera work and lighting are superb, and there are some excellent little vignettes, such as the terror of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern being brought to their executioner. In keeping with Gibson's reading of the title role, the `effects' are less highlighted here than from Branagh, and much less than from Olivier. The ghost is not melodramatic, and significantly the background music is kept within bounds of tolerance. It is a sad pity that William Walton, whose music accompanies the Olivier production, had on the one hand exceptional talent for such music but lacked the experience to know when he was overdoing things. I did not manage to spot what castle was used. It may have been in Scotland, and certainly the scene at the graveside could almost have been from Braveheart. As some will know, the real castle of the real Amled does not beetle o'er any crags, and the Bard's Elsinore is much more imposing than real-life Helsingor, but the Bard's is the concept that we need, and it is what we are offered.Right at the start we are told that what we are about to see is `based on the play by William Shakespeare'. There are no major liberties, and what we are given is a bit of an abridgement. Hamlet is not a tightly-plotted drama, and I am not unduly upset by what Zeffirelli has done. The opening scene with the night-watchmen is skipped, and at the end Fortinbras is dispensed with. Neither of these acts of pruning bothered me, although I regretted the loss of occasional bits of dialogue from this most quotation-replete of plays. Of all plays that I have ever seen or read it remains my favourite, indeed this production reinforces its primacy. I can't say, as Mr Clive James has said, that it is the best play in the world because I don't know all the plays in the world, but surely it must be a candidate for that honour.",5,WHAT A PIECE OF

295351,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6302096243,Deborah Earle,"[0, 1]","Franco Zeffirelli takes another shot at directing Shakespeare--a hobby of his since the 1960s--in this solemn 1991 production with his characteristically abridged text.Gibson joins an intriguing fraternity of the onscreen portrayers  of Literature's Princely Procrastinator. Laurence Olivier had the classically dramatic Hamlet(1948), Nicol Williamson had the staid Hamlet (although in that 1969 production, Marianne Faithfull's Ophelia made more of an impression on me), and Kenneth Branaugh, clad in 19th century costumes, had the intensely sinewy and thorough Hamlet(1996).But Mel Gibson strikes me as the intensely cool Hamlet. In a drafty-looking Elsinore Castle situated by the sea, the drama begins, and the modernity Gibson lends to the role of the melancholy Dane as he mourns his father (the venerable Paul Scofield) is confronted by his ghost, disturbed by the sudden remarriage of his mother Queen Gertrude(a most Scandinavian-looking Glenn Close) to his Uncle Claudius (a conniving Alan Bates)who succeeds his brother to the Danish throne, emanates.Gibson makes this role a carry-over from his roles in ""Mad Max"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" as he plays another character on a quest for vengeance (and perhaps he also draws on earlier training as a Shakespearan actor, having played Romeo onstage in Australia years before). Feigning  madness, he has the melancholy air displayed in so many of his films and the close-ups of his very expressive  trademark cornflower blue eyes encapsulates that.He has the opportunity to kill his Uncle after learning of his responsibility  for his father's death as Claudius kneels at prayer with a troubled conscience after watching a play with an all-too-familiar theme. Worrying that Claudius' soul may go to Heaven if he is killed while at prayer, Hamlet decides to wait for a more appropriate moment--a decison that leads to a mounting array of carnage.The tragedy of Polonius(Ian Holm)the King's Chamberlain, falls fast on the heels of Hamlet's unfortunate decision, which soon has its bearing on Ophelia(a well-cast Helena Bonham Carter), Polonius' daughter, as well as  well as his son, Laertes (a sharp-eyed Nathaniel Parker who is relatively calm in his treachery).Amid an array of seemingly accurate Danish Medieval era costumes, and an environment of mostly cold solemnity, we watch Hamlet outwit two fellow students, noblemen Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Michael Maloney and Sean Murray), with the fatal consequences for the duo; another lugubrious moment is briefly assuaged by Hamlet's chat with a gravedigger (Trevor Peacock).Later John McEnery, two decades removed from his memorable performances as Zeffirelli's Mercutio, appears as the nobleman Osiric.Stephen Dillane's Horatio bears witness to these calamitous events, and after Gibson gives the most soberly forceful  delivery of Hamlet's denunciation of his Uncle that I've witnessed to date, is charged with telling the tale. No invasion of foreign troops. No seizure of the Danish throne by the Norwegian Prince Fontainbras in this production.

Gibson, whose resume was based on the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon franchises at that time, is surprisingly effective in a role thought be a stretch.  Director Franco Zeffirelli had the good sense to let Gibson's energetic performance drive the pacing of a very brisk two-hour version of the story.  The result is a very accessible production about murder and revenge in the Danish Royal Family, and a vigorous portrayal of the normally languid and moody Hamlet.Zeffirelli's movie features beautiful location shooting, excellent costumes, and an extremely talented supporting cast, lead by Glenn Close as Hamlet's mother Gertrude, Alan Bates as the treacherous step-father, and Helena Bonham-Carter as the doomed Ophelia.  At the center is Hamlet, as played by Gibson, visibly disturbed in his madness over his father's death, and movingly emotional in his approach to his mother and to Ophelia.This movie is highly recommended as a different but highly entertaining version of Hamlet.

Gibson, Close, Bates, Holm, Bonham Carter, and Scofield play their parts very well (though I do believe that Gibson doesn't really look the part sometimes).

He does not display the level of anger that Kenneth Branagh did, and in my opinion this is good.

Joining the ""Lethal Weapon"" star are Glenn Close (""The Big Chill""), Paul Scofield (""A Man For All Seasons""), Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Maloney (who would be cast as Roderigo opposite Kenneth Branagh and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's ""Othello"" [see my review of Olivier's ""stage"" version of the tragedy, though he only starred in it] and who Branagh would cast as Laertes in HIS 3-hour version of ""Hamlet"" [a proper homage to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play; see my review on that one as well] 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who would be cast as Cassio in his brother's version of ""Othello"" 4 years later) and Helena Bonham-Carter.Zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to Sir Laurence Olivier (who had died 2 years prior to this movie) and it works pretty well, for the most part. What I was slightly uncomfortable with was Zeffirelli's misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene, he gives one of Hamlet's lines to the Ghost. Also, Helena Bonham-Carter DID NOT convince me as Ophelia. She was too dull and unreal, whereas Jean Simmons (who had immortalized the role in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who did an acceptable job in Kenneth Branagh's uncut, epic revisionist reworking of ""Hamlet"") were good in the role, with Jean Simmons being the BEST Ophelia ever, that's why she was nominated for Best Actress in 1948 (she didn't win-what a shame). Ian Holm said his lines too quickly, not slowly as I expected him to, in  a scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But then again, I'm more used to Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers' interpretations of the role and I think that they did better jobs than Holm in their respective versions of ""Hamlet"" (both done by great directors, actors, text-editors, producers AND stars of all their versions of the Bard's work) as Polonius.The rest of the cast, however, was excellent. The scene where Hamlet confronts his mother was very well done, but Olivier and Branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required.I recommend this version just to pass the time, but it's ideal as a teaching tool for 12th-grade English teachers (I recommend showing Olivier's version first, then Branagh's and finally this version). Despite the film's ""PG"" rating, there was really nothing objectionable in the movie. Only what the play called for.The Best Versions Of ""Hamlet"" Are:#1 Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I can't decide which one was the best. See my reviews on these versions for more information.#2 Franco Zeffirelli. This one was alright. It started out alright with a scene not in the play, but should've then progressed to the actual beginning of the play, where a guard cries out ""Who's there?"" ""Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself!!"" That scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting quietly and then-bam!!, you almost jump out of your skin. In short, that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play. HUGE blunder on Zeffirelli's part to omit that scene. It also misplaced a lot of lines (and cut others that I think should've been put in), such as the line where Hamlet says to Ophelia ""Get thee to a nunnery, why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?""; that line was supposed to have occurred in THAT scene, NOT where it was placed in the film. This version struggles between cutting out too much or too little. Kenneth Branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy, making HIS version a more fitting homage to Sir Laurence Olivier, as several of the actors (aside from him) had performed ""Hamlet"" on stage/or on film many times on different occasions. However, Zeffirelli's take on ""Hamlet"" IS faithful to the play and THAT's what I was looking for. The setup for the final act duel was the same as in Olivier and Branagh's versions, only that the denouement in Branagh's version was more violent than the denoument of the previous two faithful versions and stuck more closely to the play, with Branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own...to very good effect.This version is Not Rated.",4,"Homage To Sir Laurence Olivier Works, But

295368,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6302096243,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","This Play is one of the most important pieces of drama and poetry in Shakespeare's complete works. A cycle of peace and quiet is disturbed by an incestuous crime, both the murder of a brother and the hasty and sensuous marriage of the murderer with the victim's wife, a marriage which is totally against the normal Christian and feudal rules of the time : you are not supposed to covet the wife of your brother. Then havoc falls onto the kingdom of Denmark. Hamlet is forced to play deranged and crazy to save his life and to cover up his violent defense against dangers around him. Ophelia will get deranged to the point of drowning herself. Then the cycle of disturbances will go on to its utter end which means the destruction of all the protagonists. Shakespeare's vision does not stop there : equilibrium is reintroduced in this disturbed kingdom by the arrival of a distant cousin, Fortinbras, who seizes power by force though he represents the last touch of legitimacy available. But this film takes two interesting options. The first one is the will to be as realistic as possible about the real living conditions of the time in the Elsinore Castle in Denmark. Gloomy, dark, shadowy, life is nothing but a shady dream accompanied by ambitious social climbers who are ready to do anything to have power and privileges. The film insists on the fate of some of these smiling hypocrites, like Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern who are shown in their last living instant just before the axe of the executioner falls on their necks in London. The film also insists on the filth of such a life and concentrates this dirt onto Ophelia. This realistic choice gives to the play a dramatic density that it deserves entirely. At times it verges onto a melodramatic dimension, especially when dealing with the mother who is an unsensitive ambitious woman who does not want to lose the status of Queen and is ready to do anything to keep that crown. In fact she cannot love Hamlet because he represents a danger to her queenhood. Zeffirelli shows her nearly as being repentant. The second option is the cutting off of the last scene, the arrival of Fortinbras to seize power by force and legitimize the return to equilibrium since he is the only surviving relative of this blood line and he had been banned out of Denmark because he was against the strange crowning of the brother of the dead King due to his marrying the dead king's wife, which is incestuous as we have seen. This change in ending cuts off any historical and political meaning in the play, and that is a shame because Shakespeare is a great historian in a way, definitely a historical playwright who has a full vision of fate and time. Why did Zeffirelli do that ? We can hardly know. Maybe he wanted to balance his Romeo and Juliet with a second drama of the same type. Maybe it is his vision of Shakespeare, even if it is a reduction.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne",4,"Without its natural end, it is endless",1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2986,"['Play', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'pieces', 'drama', 'poetry', 'Shakespeare', 'complete', 'works', 'cycle', 'peace', 'quiet', 'disturbed', 'incestuous', 'crime', 'murder', 'brother', 'hasty', 'sensuous', 'marriage', 'murderer', 'victim', 'wife', 'marriage', 'totally', 'normal', 'Christian', 'feudal', 'rules', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'covet', 'wife', 'brother', 'Then', 'falls', 'kingdom', 'Denmark', 'Hamlet', 'forced', 'play', 'deranged', 'crazy', 'save', 'life', 'cover', 'up', 'violent', 'defense', 'dangers', 'Ophelia', 'will', 'get', 'deranged', 'point', 'drowning', 'Then', 'cycle', 'disturbances', 'will', 'go', 'utter', 'end', 'destruction', 'protagonists', 'Shakespeare', 'vision', 'not', 'stop', 'there', 'equilibrium', 'reintroduced', 'disturbed', 'kingdom', 'arrival', 'distant', 'cousin', 'Fortinbras', 'who', 'power', 'force', 'last', 'touch', 'legitimacy', 'available', 'film', 'two', 'interesting', 'options', 'first', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'real', 'living', 'conditions', 'time', 'Elsinore', 'Castle', 'Denmark', 'Gloomy', 'dark', 'shadowy', 'life', 'nothing', 'shady', 'dream', 'accompanied', 'ambitious', 'social', 'climbers', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'have', 'power', 'privileges', 'film', 'fate', 'smiling', 'hypocrites', 'Rosenkrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'who', 'are', 'shown', 'last', 'living', 'instant', 'just', 'axe', 'executioner', 'necks', 'London', 'film', 'also', 'filth', 'life', 'dirt', 'Ophelia', 'realistic', 'choice', 'play', 'dramatic', 'density', 'entirely', 'times', 'melodramatic', 'dimension', 'especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'mother', 'who', 'unsensitive', 'ambitious', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'lose', 'status', 'Queen', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'keep', 'crown', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'Hamlet', 'danger', 'queenhood', 'Zeffirelli', 'nearly', 'being', 'repentant', 'second', 'option', 'cutting', 'last', 'scene', 'arrival', 'Fortinbras', 'seize', 'power', 'force', 'legitimize', 'return', 'equilibrium', 'only', 'surviving', 'relative', 'blood', 'line', 'had', 'been', 'banned', 'Denmark', 'was', 'strange', 'crowning', 'brother', 'dead', 'King', 'due', 'marrying', 'dead', 'king', 'wife', 'incestuous', 'have', 'seen', 'change', 'ending', 'cuts', 'historical', 'political', 'meaning', 'play', 'shame', 'Shakespeare', 'great', 'historian', 'way', 'definitely', 'historical', 'playwright', 'who', 'full', 'vision', 'fate', 'time', 'Why', 'did', 'Zeffirelli', 'do', 'can', 'hardly', 'know', 'Maybe', 'wanted', 'balance', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'second', 'drama', 'same', 'type', 'Maybe', 'vision', 'Shakespeare', 'even', 'reduction.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', 'Pantheon-Sorbonne']",Hamlet VHS

295376,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,6302096243,J. O. Booker,"[2, 2]","After seeing Olivier's version of Hamlet, I was interested in seeing this version of Hamlet. Admittedly, Mel Gibson was one-hundred percent of my impulse to see this film. I don't usually follow actors when choosing movies; I trust directors more than I trust actors in choosing movies. But Mel Gibson is an exception to this rule: when was the last time the man made a bad movie?-- I can't even think of one.With this said, I rented this movie and watched it with growing delight and amazement. As always, Mel was Mel--great. Glen Close--great. The actors and actresses, from Mel Gibson, to Glen Close,to Alan Bates, to Ian Holmes, etc., delivered the complicated verses of the Bard's epic tragedy as though those words were their very own words. And those words, though fast and often ferocious, were nevertheless so clearly defined and nuanced that at no point during the film did I feel any inclination to switch on the subtitles. As Adrian Lynne's Lolita to Stanley Kubrick's Lolita, this version of Hamlet was so well made as to defy every comparison with its former. The gargantuan and rough-hewn sets of Zeffirelli's Hamlet sharply contrasts against the tiny, but well-organized sets of Olivier's Hamlet. Precision, economy, and bourgeoisie ethos marked Olivier's Hamlet; though equally articulate, Mel's Hamlet is scruffy and coarse as if to blend in with the harsh interior and exterior sets of the movie.Hamlet is a proverb centered around the murder of King Hamlet, Hamlet's father. The murder of King Hamlet at the hands of his brother, Claudius--who subsequently assumes both Hamlet's crown and queen--is the outrage that inflames young Hamlet (Gibson)against his mother's--Glen Close-- new husband. Despite all signs pointing to the affirmative--that Claudius murdered his father, young Hamlet cannot act decisively and his wavering establishes a chain of terrible and tragic incidents.This Hamlet is a great movie, equally so to Olivier's Hamlet.

This &quot;Hamlet&quot; is no exception.  Repeat Shakespeare director Franco Zeffirelli creates a comprehensible, straightforward presentation that is excellent for newcomers to the Tragedy, but will lack a great deal for purists.Many object to the casting of professional heartthrob Mel Gibson as the doomed Dane, yet he acquits himself very well.  In a remarkably difficult role, he creates an accessible character without sacrificing the depth of inner turmoil we've come to expect from our Hamlet.  He also plays well against his two female leads.  Glenn Close as Gertrude creates a character who paradoxically is the opposite of and a complement to her star-making role in &quot;Fatal Attraction.&quot;  Helena Bonham Carter, princess of the costume dramas, carries off the varied subtlety of Ophelia, a difficult role on which many very skillful actresses have fallen down.Some of the other characters simply fail to make an impression.  It's hard to even place anything done by Alan Bates' Claudius.  Iam Holm as Polonius seems like it ought to be a casting master stroke, but the potential of the master actor in the role just isn't exploited as it should be.  Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are abridged to the point of inconsequence, as are Horatio, Bernardo, and Pete Postelthwaite's intriguing but uninvestigated Player King.Screenwriters Zeffirelli and Christopher De Vore recut the scenes and action to make use of the potential of the camera.  Moving locations allow private speeches to be more private and the public events to be more public.  The flow isn't necessarily improved, but it is much more compatible with the nature of film, which is wildly different than the stage.  Not everyone will like the way the classic scenes have been resequenced, but the structure will satisfy those weaned on movies over theatre much better than a straight line-for-line reading would do.All in all, like any other Shakespeare film, this will thrill some and bore others.  Purists are warned that this is a movie, not a film of a staging; neophytes are warned that this is not light fare, and will require more than one viewing to gloss.

The result is a staggeringly ordinary production, but a serviceable primer for those who want to familiarize themselves with the text.The virtues of the film are many, with fine performances turned in by Helena Bonham Carter as Ophelia, Paul Scofield as the Ghost, and an especially memorable one by Glenn Close as an unusually dense Gertrude. Zefferelli also serves himself well by providing a brilliant and concisely edited screenplay; paring down the length and complications of the text for the masses, while retaining all the key characters and points of the story with the precision of a surgeon.But the name of the play is ""Hamlet,"" and this production is bogged down by Mel Gibson's lack of imagination or sustained sensitivity in the role. Gibson does not embarrass himself in the manner of Keanu Reeves or Michael Keaton in Kenneth Branaugh's ""Much Ado About Nothing""; indeed in some scenes such as Hamlet's aborted attempt to return to Wittenberg or in his surprisingly touching reading of the ""Alas, Poor Yorick"" speech he is very effective. But this is the first film Hamlet not played by an actor who had already distinguished himself in the role on stage. If Gibson had been serious about wanting to invest himself in the part, he would have challenged himself in a theater production where his movie star clout might have been more easily cast aside. But by throwing himself into a big budget film of the play without any real idea of how to play the role is simply an act of arrogance, and by the time Gibson is seen in the Act V duel grotesquely whooping and stomping like in one of the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, the film has degenerated into a tiresome Vanity Production.Zefferelli obviously wanted Gibson because his presence in the role meant that he could raise the money to satisfy his affinity for lavishly ornate sets and costumes. But while this sumptuous rendering served his films of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and the memorable Burton/Taylor ""Taming of the Shrew"" well, ""Hamlet"" is another matter. The most effective films of ""Hamlet"" had simple settings, such as the stark and cold stone Elsinore of Olivier's film or the generic castle set of the magnificent BBC Television production starring Derek Jacobi and Patrick Stewart; unpretentious surroundings that makes the viewer focus on the very human drama that is unfolding in front of them. By overdressing his production, Zefferelli tries to draw attention away from his less than compelling leading man. But, like Cyrano de Bergerac, Hamlet wears his adornments on his soul; and in this production the soul is sadly lacking.",2,A Vanity Production,1019779200,"04 26, 2002",2002,3062,"['When', 'Franco', 'Zefferelli', 'directed', '1968', 'film', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'first', 'person', 'approached', 'play', 'male', 'lead', 'was', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Beatle', 'turned', 'down', 'offer', 'Zefferelli', 'enjoyed', 'phenomenal', 'success', 'casting', 'two', 'unknowns', 'Shakespearean', 'experience', 'title', 'roles', 'director', 'doubtless', 'hoped', 'lightning', 'would', 'strike', 'twice', 'casting', 'screen', 'reigning', 'action', 'star', 'one', 'most', 'demanding', 'roles', 'Shakespearean', 'canon', 'result', 'staggeringly', 'ordinary', 'production', 'serviceable', 'primer', 'who', 'want', 'familiarize', 'text.The', 'virtues', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'fine', 'performances', 'turned', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Ophelia', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'Ghost', 'especially', 'memorable', 'one', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'unusually', 'dense', 'Gertrude', 'Zefferelli', 'also', 'well', 'providing', 'brilliant', 'concisely', 'edited', 'screenplay', 'paring', 'down', 'length', 'complications', 'text', 'masses', 'retaining', 'key', 'characters', 'points', 'story', 'precision', 'surgeon.But', 'name', 'play', 'Hamlet', 'production', 'bogged', 'down', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'lack', 'imagination', 'sustained', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'Gibson', 'not', 'embarrass', 'manner', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'indeed', 'scenes', 'such', 'Hamlet', 'aborted', 'attempt', 'return', 'Wittenberg', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'reading', 'Alas', 'Poor', 'Yorick', 'speech', 'very', 'effective', 'first', 'film', 'Hamlet', 'not', 'played', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'distinguished', 'role', 'stage', 'Gibson', 'had', 'been', 'serious', 'wanting', 'invest', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'challenged', 'theater', 'production', 'where', 'movie', 'star', 'clout', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'easily', 'cast', 'aside', 'throwing', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'play', 'real', 'idea', 'how', 'play', 'role', 'simply', 'act', 'arrogance', 'time', 'Gibson', 'seen', 'Act', 'V', 'duel', 'grotesquely', 'whooping', 'stomping', 'one', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'movies', 'film', 'degenerated', 'tiresome', 'Vanity', 'Production.Zefferelli', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'Gibson', 'presence', 'role', 'meant', 'could', 'raise', 'money', 'satisfy', 'affinity', 'lavishly', 'ornate', 'sets', 'costumes', 'sumptuous', 'rendering', 'served', 'films', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'memorable', 'Burton/Taylor', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'well', 'Hamlet', 'matter', 'most', 'effective', 'films', 'Hamlet', 'had', 'simple', 'settings', 'such', 'stark', 'cold', 'stone', 'Elsinore', 'Olivier', 'film', 'generic', 'castle', 'set', 'magnificent', 'BBC', 'Television', 'production', 'starring', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'unpretentious', 'surroundings', 'viewer', 'focus', 'very', 'human', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'front', 'overdressing', 'production', 'Zefferelli', 'draw', 'attention', 'away', 'less', 'compelling', 'leading', 'man', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'Hamlet', 'adornments', 'soul', 'production', 'soul', 'sadly', 'lacking']",Hamlet VHS

If you've read the play ( &amp; this is the reason I give it 5 stars ), Gibson's version is great beause you can fill in the blanks quite easily &amp; nothing is lost. The Ghost is by far better in Gibson's version ( remember, this is not a ghost in the modern sense, so it's important not to judge by appearences ), &amp; the interplay between them in their first meeting is just amazing. However, the politics of the play suffers badly, in my opinion, becuase many of the characters in the sub-plots are missing, especially Polonius' machinations....however, he certainly DIES better in Gibson's version.

295394,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6302096243,Martin Asiner,"[10, 12]","The decision to watch a filmed version of HAMLET is roughly comparable to choosing whether to vacation in the Bahamas or Aruba.  You'll get a tan from both but the ambience will surely vary.  Olivier's HAMLET is classic, introspective, and hesitant.  Branagh's is fully texted and purposefully allegorical.  But,if one wishes to see a more decisive Dane, who combines this sense of deliberation with charm, humor, and exaggerated violence, then one would do well to turn to Mel Gibson's Hamlet.  Director Franco Zeffirelli has lopped off much of the original text, excising those scenes that were of more import to Shakespeare's audience but retaining the rest.The viewer who knows the play well can tell from the opening scene that Zeffirelli chooses not to begin with the conversation between Marcellus and Bernardo, whose dialogue about the ghost of Hamlet's father foreshadows the imminent appearance of a ghost whose 'reality' in the context of both contemporary and modern audiences has been endlessly debated. Such divergences between the original text and this filmed version do not detract from the visual and visceral power of Zeffirelli's vision. Hamlet, as Gibson plays him, is not the meek and indecisive Olivier, who seems unsure until the closing scenes as to what lengths he will go to eliminate the rottenness that is now Denmark.  Gibson's Hamlet is more closely attuned to the printed version who can seem indecisive in one breath but violently purposeful in the next.  One of the most enduring enigmas in a play that is riddled with them is the enduring controversy as to whether Hamlet is seeking to cleanse Denmark's rottenness under the claim that he is a legitimate avenger of Heaven as the ghost seems to imply or he is simply seeking a personal vendetta against the man who killed his father and bedded his mother.  Gibson makes it clear in the scene when he encounters his uncle, the now king, engrossed in prayer, and has the long-awaited opportunity to kill him with impunity.  Hamlet decides not to since death while praying might still admit King Claudius to Heaven.  For Hamlet, such a death and pleasant afterlife, is not punishment enough.  Hamlet will wait to dispatch the King in a manner that will surely doom his soul to eternal torment in Hell. Thus, Gibson is fixed in his interpretation of a prince who resists being a pawn in a game of political chess, while all the while transforming himself from pawn to chess king as he masterfully moves the rooks, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to their undeserved deaths in England.Glenn Close, as Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, has been unfairly pilloried as being too youthful and attractive to be convincing as a woman who ought not have remarried quite so soon after her husband's death.  Her performance is, nevertheless, quite riveting and is probably closer to the dilemma that Shakespeare envisioned as he wrote of a woman who chose to overlook the obvious in favor or re-establishing a moral center for a country that was in turmoil and could not turn to a moody, brooding prince for salvation.  With each heart-rending word from Hamlet that pushes her nose in the slime of real world grubby politics, Gertrude stands revealed as a woman who was more simple in her life and philosophy than simple-minded in her acumen.  It is no fault of her own, as Hamlet so viciously accuses, that she has failed to see what to him is so painfully obvious.Since this HAMLET is a truncated version of the text, much of the grist for the scholarly mill has been thankfully eliminated. Shakespeare's contemporaries might have exulted in and commiserated with the long dramatic advice that Hamlet gives to the passing troupe of actors, the purpose of which was to present on a microcosmic scale within the play-in-a-play what Hamlet was to accomplish on the macrocosmic.  For modern audiences, such digressions would surely have diluted their interest.  What Zeffirelli and Gibson do manage is to present a two hour howl of pain of a man who is caught in a box, locked with a key that can double as a self-immolating sword. For many of Shakespeares' heroes--as well as his villains--the choice of their use of a life-saving key or a life-ending samurai dagger is what continually drags audiences to eternally reenact the angst of his best and worst.  This HAMLET does that as well as any other of Shakespeare's plays.",5,"""A hit.

295397,ALV4TW6SWHDUF,6302096243,"Me ""Me""","[14, 23]","Now I think Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"" was the finest put on film. Similarly, I think his production of ""Hamlet"" could have been a daring reinterpretation of the play, since portions were removed and the chronological order of events was changed. It is a gutsy attempt to make changes in The Bard's work that could have shown a different side to the work. Truly a risky and difficult undertaking that requires fine judgment and sensitivity to the original work. Now all that being said, I find this work to be singularly unimpressive. In fact, I believe this production falls flat as Evel Knevel's Snake River Canyon motorcycle jump.Why?The whole presentation was *riddled* with mispronounciations and weird errors. They needed to read the script more. An actor must do three basic things: 1) Know the script, 2) Know what the script means, and 3) Mean it when he/she speaks the script. In this movie, they often failed the first two...which means the third will be misguided.Thank Goodness for Kenneth Brannagh!The original play sets up key moments that have powerful meaning, but the disjointed editing of the work removes those moments and creates no others. We are left with the original build-ups with unsatisfactory resolutions because they were either moved or removed. As Einstein once said, ""Things should be made as simple as possible, and no simpler.""A funny aside about the stage combat(for sticklers only): The climax of the production is made even more nonsensical when one considers that at Shakespeare's time, thrusting swords were used. With such a sword, it is possible to put a ball on the tip to blunt it enough for fencing, as done today, and more importantly, as done in the play. The climax of the play depends on this issue because Ophelia's brother tries to cheat and kill Hamlet with an unblunted and envenomed sword during a fencing match. Gibson's production, however, takes place during the *middle ages*. Medieval swords are designed to penetrate *armor*.Who cares whether the sword is blunted or envenomed when it can hack and thrust through *armor* to make kills? Would a ""fencer"" hacked with such a weapon even *notice* whether there is a blunting ball on the tip?It's like ""fencing"" with guns and complaining that someone's bullets are not blunted at the tip...Who cares!? They are *bullets*! They kill by sheer brute force! It makes Shakespeare's script denouncing the treacherous use of an ""unbated and envenomed sword"" ridiculous because of its ill-considered stage context. Again, they didn't understand the script.How could it have been more true to the script? Apparently ""safe"" fencing-type swords, such as rapiers, could have been used. *Then* there could be a true *betrayal* of the ""safe"" conditions of the fencing match...a treacherous betrayal of trust as intended in the play.Kenneth Brannagh's version is better, even in this detail.Anyway, I don't mean to be picky, but there are so many deficiencies in this production, it is almost laughable.

295399,A3M2O06MCHJG18,6302096243,"MiddleAgedReviewer ""M_A_R""","[19, 22]","Mel Gibson's 1990 version of argueably the greatest of William Shakespeare's works unquestionably has its flaws, but certainly holds it own among myriad other versions of the play.  Please, don't pay too much attention to those who would attempt to compare Gibson's Hamlet to any of his action roles; Hamlet is perhaps the most complex intellectual character in all of the English language.  It is unfair to compare him to a futuristic road warrior or a Three Stooges-loving, suicidal cop.The reason why Gibson was cast as Hamlet in this version is simple: he helped cast himself.  Why?  For the opportunity to establish himself as an actor with serious talent, not just serious sex appeal.  His Hamlet possessed more than enough of the emotional depth and range necessary for the role, and Gibson also brought an intangible element: his own charisma.  As we do with Jack and Rose in the movie _Titanic_, we truly rooted for this Hamlet, despite knowledge of the inevitable conclusion.Gibson looks uncomfortable at first (nervous?) and starts out slowly; tentatively.  He finds his acting feet soon thereafter, and by the end of the film, his presence seems to upstage that of the other actors.  So while it is a somewhat unbalanced performance in that regard, Gibson's physical communication of his torment was both dynamic and convincing.  The explication of information during his monologues was far superior to Derek Jacobi's BBC version in the late '70's, and in my opinion, over the decades and the evolution of acting methods and styles, almost supercedes Olivier's 1948 version.  If you can overlook the fact that Mel Gibson is a very grown-up version of Hamlet, then his rendition, while flawed, is still an effort worthy of The Bard.His supporting cast was very well chosen, with the exception perhaps of Glenn Close as Hamlet's mother, Gertrude, who must have been eight years old when Hamlet was born!  Helena Bonham Carter was simply outstanding as Ophelia... the madness of Shakespeare's characters is a difficult state to emulate, and the heartrending sadness she bears is palpable.Franco Zeffirelli is a longtime Shakespeare veteran, most memorably for directing the 1968 version of _Romeo and Juliet_, considered by many to be the best film adaptation of any of Shakespeare's works.  He paints an atmosphere in Elsinore as cold as the tension between Hamlet and his uncle, but perhaps tries a little too hard to make things fresh by infusing awkward new camera angles and an unbalanced (and sometimes nonexistant) complimentary music score.If you're thinking about buying Gibson's Hamlet simply because you are a big Mel fan, then by all means, you should do so.  You'll see a side of Mel that you hadn't seen prior to 1990, and in many ways, haven't seen since (_Braveheart_ was a triumph, but it's simply a different genre than Shakespeare).  But if you're looking for the best version of Hamlet, and you have to choose between this version and Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version, I would strongly suggest Branagh's.  It is a full-text version (excellent for students) while Gibson's has cut scenes, re-organized scenes, and missing characters.  Branagh's moves much more swiftly, vividly, and energetically, and although it is set in the 19th century rather than the 15th/16th century, the language still fits snugly in that timeline and in no way affects the plot.  But if you don't have to choose, don't count out Gibson's version one way or the other.  It is definitely worth viewing, and perhaps you'll consider renting both versions before buying.",3,A Very Respectable Version,1042416000,"01 13, 2003",2003,3568,"['Mel', 'Gibson', '1990', 'version', 'argueably', 'greatest', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'works', 'unquestionably', 'flaws', 'certainly', 'own', 'myriad', 'other', 'versions', 'play', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'who', 'would', 'attempt', 'compare', 'Gibson', 'Hamlet', 'action', 'roles', 'Hamlet', 'perhaps', 'most', 'complex', 'intellectual', 'character', 'English', 'language', 'unfair', 'compare', 'futuristic', 'road', 'warrior', 'Three', 'Stooges-loving', 'suicidal', 'cop.The', 'reason', 'why', 'Gibson', 'was', 'cast', 'Hamlet', 'version', 'simple', 'helped', 'cast', 'Why', 'opportunity', 'establish', 'actor', 'serious', 'talent', 'not', 'just', 'serious', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Hamlet', 'possessed', 'more', 'enough', 'emotional', 'depth', 'range', 'necessary', 'role', 'Gibson', 'also', 'brought', 'intangible', 'element', 'own', 'charisma', 'do', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'movie', '_Titanic_', 'truly', 'rooted', 'Hamlet', 'knowledge', 'inevitable', 'conclusion.Gibson', 'uncomfortable', 'first', 'nervous', 'out', 'slowly', 'tentatively', 'acting', 'feet', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'end', 'film', 'presence', 'upstage', 'other', 'actors', 'So', 'somewhat', 'unbalanced', 'performance', 'regard', 'Gibson', 'physical', 'communication', 'torment', 'was', 'dynamic', 'convincing', 'explication', 'information', 'monologues', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'BBC', 'version', 'late', ""'70"", 'opinion', 'decades', 'evolution', 'acting', 'methods', 'styles', 'almost', 'Olivier', '1948', 'version', 'can', 'overlook', 'fact', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'very', 'grown-up', 'version', 'Hamlet', 'then', 'rendition', 'flawed', 'still', 'effort', 'worthy', 'Bard.His', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'chosen', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Hamlet', 'mother', 'Gertrude', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Hamlet', 'was', 'born', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'was', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'Ophelia', 'madness', 'Shakespeare', 'characters', 'difficult', 'state', 'emulate', 'heartrending', 'sadness', 'palpable.Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'longtime', 'Shakespeare', 'veteran', 'most', 'memorably', 'directing', '1968', 'version', '_Romeo', 'Juliet_', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Shakespeare', 'works', 'atmosphere', 'Elsinore', 'as', 'cold', 'tension', 'Hamlet', 'uncle', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'things', 'fresh', 'infusing', 'awkward', 'new', 'camera', 'angles', 'unbalanced', 'sometimes', 'nonexistant', 'complimentary', 'music', 'score.If', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'buying', 'Gibson', 'Hamlet', 'simply', 'are', 'big', 'Mel', 'fan', 'then', 'means', 'should', 'do', 'so', ""'ll"", 'see', 'side', 'Mel', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'prior', '1990', 'many', 'ways', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '_Braveheart_', 'was', 'triumph', 'simply', 'different', 'genre', 'Shakespeare', ""'re"", 'looking', 'best', 'version', 'Hamlet', 'have', 'choose', 'version', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', '1996', 'version', 'would', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'Branagh', 'full-text', 'version', 'excellent', 'students', 'Gibson', 'cut', 'scenes', 're-organized', 'scenes', 'missing', 'characters', 'Branagh', 'moves', 'much', 'more', 'swiftly', 'vividly', 'energetically', 'set', '19th', 'century', 'rather', '15th/16th', 'century', 'language', 'still', 'snugly', 'timeline', 'way', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'choose', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'out', 'Gibson', 'version', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'consider', 'renting', 'versions', 'buying']",Hamlet VHS

This is an exception, and a surprising one, since I figured the part of Hamlet would be too much of a stretch for The Mel, but in fact he does fine by the role, certainly much more watchable than Laurence Olivier's overrated (and frankly boring) 1948 movie version.  One beef is that he and Glenn Close are way too close (sorry!) in age to be playing son and mother (couldn't they have solved that with makeup?), but she does fine as the somewhat befuddled Gertrude, and Alan Bates is fine as Hamlet's murderous uncle Claudius.  (Bates, as he got into middle age, ceased exposing his arse in films - good!)Franco Zefirelli did some lush color movies of Romeo and Juliet and Taming of the Shrew. Here his color is a little more restrained (would anyone expect lavish color in medieval Denmark?), but suits the story perfectly.  And, considering he's Italian, he does well with his mixed cast of Brits and Americans.After this movie's release, Kenneth Branagh came out with his version, when he filmed the FULL (meaning LONG) version of Hamlet, and I simply never made it through that version.  Shakespeare has almost always been cut for stage or film versions, and rightly so, because even the greatest writer of all time needed some judicious ""pruning"" here and there, and cuts usually make for a more comfortable running time as well as eliminating some non-essential scenes and speeches.  Zeffirelli's version is just about perfect (probably just one bathroom break for any viewer over 40).

In contrast, Gibson's performance conveyed much more effectively the internal dialogue that both pacified and plagued Hamlet.Helena Bonham-Carter's performance as Ophelia was exquisite and ranks up there with her performance as Lucy Honeychurch in ""A Room With a View"".  I can't imagine anyone else better suited to play this most tragic character of the entire play.Alan Bates, Glenn Close, and Nathaniel Parker were perfectly cast, as well.

295404,A2VMS83X8EJYBD,6302096243,"Paul E. Doniger ""Free Thinker""","[8, 13]","First, let me clarify that I sometimes like Mel Gibson as an actor, even sometimes as a director. Also, let me say that Franco Zefferelli has a very fine eye for color and composition, fine enough to make all his films interesting to look at. However, the problems of this film are many-fold, so many that in spite of its being pleasant to look at, it is unpleasant to watch and hear. The biggest problem is the director's lack of depth. Viewing this movie, I have the distinct impression that Zefferilli's first thoughts were about the length of the picture (keeping it from exceeding ""two hours traffic"") and making interesting-looking pictures. This surface-oriented approach to Shakespeare indicates that the director placed little emphasis or made nearly no effort at what constitutes the heart of his work: Making the most of the language.Among other errors, Zefferelli makes unfortunate cuts and emendations. For example, he guts much of Claudius's soliloquy in the prayer scene, leaving the character almost a stock villain (this in spite of an excellent actor, Alan Bates, in the role). He also seems to be unconcerned with temporal logic: Hamlet and Laertes cannot duel properly with bated or unbated rapiers because of the medieval setting. It is absurd that they use broad swords rather than rapiers in the duel scene, swords which are meant to hack, rather than stab, contradicting the whole point of the unbated and poisoned tip of the foil. The medieval story always, in Shakespeare, has to be consistent with the Elizabethan context in which it was composed.Finally, Mel Gibson, ordinarily a decent film actor, is hung out to dry and unable to negotiate this, the most challenging male role in English theatre, alone. He needs a director who is both a deep thinker and who knows how to challenge his actors to find the spine of their character and bring it to the surface. Zefferelli just didn't (or couldn't) make his leading actor dive deeply enough into the character - especially not THIS character. And Mel Gibson is an actor who himself lacks the depth needed to investigate Hamlet thoroughly, and his is surely an actor who needs a very different type of director for this kind of role.I give the film its two stars, however, for a couple of reasons: First, the supporting cast has two gems in it -- Helena Bonham-Carter is, in spite of some very odd choices from her director, a wonderful Ophelia, and Ian Holm is one of the very best Poloniuses I have ever seen. Second, as bad as this film is, it is far less painful than Kenneth Brannagh's so-called ""uncut"" Hamlet.",2,Shakespeare badly served,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,2592,"['First', 'let', 'clarify', 'sometimes', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'actor', 'even', 'sometimes', 'director', 'Also', 'let', 'say', 'Franco', 'Zefferelli', 'very', 'fine', 'eye', 'color', 'composition', 'fine', 'enough', 'make', 'films', 'interesting', 'look', 'However', 'problems', 'film', 'are', 'many-fold', 'so', 'many', 'spite', 'being', 'pleasant', 'look', 'unpleasant', 'watch', 'hear', 'biggest', 'problem', 'director', 'lack', 'depth', 'Viewing', 'movie', 'have', 'distinct', 'impression', 'Zefferilli', 'first', 'thoughts', 'were', 'length', 'picture', 'keeping', 'exceeding', 'two', 'hours', 'traffic', 'making', 'interesting-looking', 'pictures', 'surface-oriented', 'approach', 'Shakespeare', 'director', 'placed', 'little', 'emphasis', 'made', 'nearly', 'effort', 'what', 'heart', 'work', 'Making', 'most', 'language.Among', 'other', 'errors', 'Zefferelli', 'unfortunate', 'cuts', 'emendations', 'example', 'much', 'Claudius', 'soliloquy', 'prayer', 'scene', 'leaving', 'character', 'almost', 'stock', 'villain', 'spite', 'excellent', 'actor', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'role', 'also', 'be', 'unconcerned', 'temporal', 'logic', 'Hamlet', 'Laertes', 'can', 'not', 'duel', 'properly', 'bated', 'unbated', 'rapiers', 'medieval', 'setting', 'absurd', 'use', 'broad', 'swords', 'rather', 'rapiers', 'duel', 'scene', 'swords', 'are', 'meant', 'hack', 'rather', 'stab', 'contradicting', 'whole', 'point', 'unbated', 'poisoned', 'tip', 'foil', 'medieval', 'story', 'always', 'Shakespeare', 'be', 'consistent', 'Elizabethan', 'context', 'was', 'composed.Finally', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'ordinarily', 'decent', 'film', 'actor', 'hung', 'dry', 'unable', 'negotiate', 'most', 'challenging', 'male', 'role', 'English', 'theatre', 'alone', 'director', 'who', 'deep', 'thinker', 'who', 'how', 'challenge', 'actors', 'find', 'spine', 'character', 'bring', 'surface', 'Zefferelli', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'leading', 'actor', 'dive', 'deeply', 'enough', 'character', 'especially', 'not', 'THIS', 'character', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'actor', 'who', 'depth', 'needed', 'investigate', 'Hamlet', 'thoroughly', 'surely', 'actor', 'who', 'very', 'different', 'type', 'director', 'kind', 'role.I', 'give', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'however', 'couple', 'reasons', 'First', 'supporting', 'cast', 'two', 'gems', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'spite', 'very', 'odd', 'choices', 'director', 'wonderful', 'Ophelia', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'Poloniuses', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Second', 'as', 'bad', 'film', 'far', 'less', 'painful', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'so-called', 'uncut', 'Hamlet']",Hamlet VHS

295406,ALXZ64A9OAPJ8,6302096243,"Phrodoe ""Child Of The Kindly Midwest""","[2, 3]","If Olivier's version is too stodgy and stagy for you, and Kenneth Branagh's version either too &quot;Hollywood&quot; or just too blamed long, then you may want to try Franco Zeffirelli's version, which is a pleasant surprise in just about every way.Zeffirelli has a history with Shakespeare, having directed gems like Romeo and Juliet, and a somewhat overheated (but very funny) version of The Taming of the Shrew -- in which we are treated to a pickled Richard Burton trading barbs with an overripe Liz Taylor. Zeffirelli and Shakespeare go hand-in-hand with one another; the director seems to know just how to adapt the Bard's plays for film. So when I heard he was filming Hamlet, I was overjoyed -- until I found out who was being cast in the lead:&quot;Mel GIBSON?! Is he NUTS!?!&quot;I figured it was a vanity thing for Gibson, one of those &quot;PLEASE take me seriously!&quot; ventures that would fall flat, and that Zeffirelli was sullying his own reputation by involving himself with it. I'm pleased to say I was wrong. This verson, while not the best I've seen, acquits itself honorably -- and Gibson is equal to the task of this very challenging role.It helps that he's surrounded with a stellar supporting cast, such as Paul Scofield, Ian Holm, and Glenn Close (more on whom in a minute), but even on his own, Gibson makes for an impressive Prince. He's done his homework, and makes some intelligent decisions. Hamlet in this film is not brooding/depressed so much as he is ticked off, a cauldron of boiling rage (as in the moment when Gibson attacks Elsinore itself with his sword); physical actor that he is, Gibson wouldn't have played it any other way, and so doing brought a human element to the role absent in other interpretations, including, sorry to say, Olivier's -- who looks, for all his  ability, like an actor playing a role. Not so Gibson; his Hamlet is torn between royal obligations and those to his father, and  looks as if he's been driven more than a little mad in his attempt to reconcile them. One feels that his antic dispotition  is something far more than put-on -- Gibson looks quite literally like he's about to go nuts, especially during his cathartic scene with Gertrude -- and as long as I'm on that subject ...There are several ways to approach the role of Gerturde: unknowing dupe, dotty but loving mother, and willing conspirator are just a few. Not many actresses would choose Close's daring, electrifyingly Oedipal/Freudian route, if only because it's A)the hardest to play accurately, and B)probably closest to the psychological truth, and the one actresses with less chutzpah than Close would shy away from. Close said she saw Gertrude as a &quot;trophy wife,&quot; who married Hamlet Sr. and bore his son when she was little more than a teenager. This accounts for her, ah, physical affection towards her son (I'm being euphemistic here), and is a big reason Hamlet's so messed up  to begin with. In this context Denmark's royals can be seen as just another dysfunctional family; small wonder things turn out as they do. Shakespeare knew the human condition intimately; this becomes more obvious as centuries pass, and he remains as relevant today as he was in his own time, if not moreso.Zeffirelli's direction is as impressive as the acting (Ian Holm as Polonius is another delight!); he imbues the setting with the brooding qualities Gibson chooses to leave out of his acting. (Several different castles were used in bringing Elsinore to life; it's a testament to Zeffirelli that he's able to make a seamless whole of them.) Elsinore here becomes a grim, oppressive place; it's no wonder the people there are going mad or power-mad. Zeffirelli uses few tricks to tell his story -- a few crossfades here and there, and a Scorceseish tracking shot during Hamlet's confrontation with Ophelia, are it. This speaks of a director confident in his abilities to tell a story without having to dazzle the viewer.And speaking of Ophelia, I think this would be an opportune moment to address the issue of &quot;cuts&quot; -- the process of making a four-hour play into something platable to filmgoers. Many have tried to cut Hamlet and made a conditional success of it, or botched the process entirely. For a primer, I refer you to the film adaptation of Tom Stoppard's brilliant The Fifteen-Minute Hamlet, which'll tell you everything you want to know. Cutting Hamlet can leave actors with little to say or do and unfortunately, this is what has been done to poor Ophelia. While some of her scenes remain (such as the abovementioned confrontation), others are lost to the fabled red pen, and Carter is reduced to making her role (perhaps the most tragic in the play, as she's the only real victim) into a series of mannerisms. She does well by what's left of the part -- but she doesn't have much to work with.Still, that's my only complaint about this lovely abridgement.  I think it's a great movie, better than it had any right to be -- and for that I'm glad.",4,"For Look, Where My Abridgement Has Come!",1006128000,"11 19, 2001",2001,5006,"['Olivier', 'version', 'too',

It is beautifully acted out in a gorgeous castle filled with tapestries and everything you would imagine a castle to be from the candlelight to the dimly lit spiral staircases.The most enjoyable scenes are when Hamlet expresses his thoughts in soliloquies and gives insight into what his character is feeling. Mel Gibson becomes Hamlet and I thought this was perhaps some of his best acting ever! Glenn Close is exceptional as Gertrude, the incestuous mother. The uneasiness and distrust in Denmark since King Hamlet's death and Queen Gertrude's remarriage sets the mood for the rest of the movie.The story begins on the outer ramparts of Elsinore castle. A ghost appears and Hamlet, speaks to his deceased father. The ghost asks Hamlet to revenge his ""most foul, strange, and unnatural murder."" Hamlet then deviously plots a psychological revenge by putting on a play in which a scene portrays the actual murder of his father.""I'll have groundsMore relative than this-the play's the thingWherein I'll catch the conscience of the King."" -Hamlet, Act 2, 603-605Once guilt takes hold of the King, the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together and you realize that one immoral action only makes another wrong even more probable.Throughout the play, Hamlet shows his intellectual superiority and states his case by saying: ""Do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?"" While he desires to have the upper hand until the end, he cannot of course know all the intentions of those around him nor can he escape his own fate.An Unforgettable story that made an impression on me in school and still holds a certain fascination for me.

295408,A1BRXLFWILNICE,6302096243,Robin McDonald,"[3, 4]","This is an interesting and serviceable Hamlet both different and the same as other Hamlets done in the past. Its abbreviated by half. And unfortunately by necessity characters are altered pretty drastically and you'll never get a feel for the really fascinating and motivations of the lesser characters that are really make the play a great experience when seen in full.  But if you haven't seen the entire version I doubt you will feel deprived.  I guess what makes this version distinctive is Mel Gibson plays Hamlet driven with a measure of rage and aggressiveness that is probably refreshing to people who are used to seeing him as the &quot;melancholy Dane&quot;.  So this is a pretty good version that tries to retell Hamlet in an original way. This is directed by Franco Zefferelli who in my opinion did the &quot;definitive&quot; version of Romeo and Juliet that I doubt will ever be topped. I think he also directed the best of the Jesus movies.  I can't say this is the best Hamlet, the new modern version is pretty good and the Kenneth Branaugh version is really awesome because he really understands every minute of the play. He plays Hamlet as incredibly intelligent and cunning. Hopefully this version will whet your appetite for his full version coming to DVD later this year. Unfortunately B's Hamlet is a very (panoramic) widescreen title that must be just awful in pan and scan and is going to look quite small on a 27 inch tv screen.  This version of Hamlet plays alright on the tv screen because it pretty much stays focused on Hamlet himself and the periphral characters are not nearly as important to this retelling as they are in the full version. The only negative thing I have to say about this version is that everyone is a little bit too crazy. Ophelia becomes totally mad in this version. Hamlet is supposed to be feigning madness and in the real play he plays mad when it serves his purposes. Gibson's Hamlet actually is a little crazy. Sometimes I think this waters down the motivations a little too much. I always have to remind myself watching this that there is only half the time to tell the story so its a pretty competant job.If you like this, definitely check out Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet. And if you have a big big screen TV, Branaugh's Hamlet later in the year when it comes out.",3,Such Variety,1019952000,"04 28, 2002",2002,2323,"['interesting', 'serviceable', 'Hamlet', 'different', 'same', 'other', 'Hamlets', 'done', 'past', 'abbreviated', 'half', 'unfortunately', 'necessity', 'characters', 'are', 'altered', 'pretty', 'drastically', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'feel', 'really', 'fascinating', 'motivations', 'lesser', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'make', 'play', 'great', 'experience', 'when', 'seen', 'full', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'entire', 'version', 'doubt', 'will', 'feel', 'deprived', 'guess', 'what', 'version', 'distinctive', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Hamlet', 'driven', 'measure', 'rage', 'aggressiveness', 'probably', 'refreshing', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Dane', 'quot', 'pretty', 'good', 'version', 'retell', 'Hamlet', 'original', 'way', 'directed', 'Franco', 'Zefferelli', 'who', 'opinion', 'did', 'quot', 'definitive', 'quot', 'version', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'topped', 'think', 'also', 'directed', 'best', 'Jesus', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'best', 'Hamlet', 'new', 'modern', 'version', 'pretty', 'good', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'version', 'really', 'awesome', 'really', 'minute', 'play', 'Hamlet', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'cunning', 'Hopefully', 'version', 'will', 'whet', 'appetite', 'full', 'version', 'coming', 'DVD', 'later', 'year', 'Unfortunately', 'B', 'Hamlet', 'very', 'panoramic', 'widescreen', 'title', 'must', 'be', 'just', 'awful', 'pan', 'scan', 'going', 'look', 'quite', 'small', '27', 'inch', 'tv', 'screen', 'version', 'Hamlet', 'plays', 'alright', 'tv', 'screen', 'pretty', 'much', 'stays', 'focused', 'Hamlet', 'periphral', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'important', 'retelling', 'are', 'full', 'version', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'version', 'everyone', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'crazy', 'Ophelia', 'totally', 'mad', 'version', 'Hamlet', 'supposed', 'be', 'feigning', 'madness', 'real', 'play', 'mad', 'when', 'purposes', 'Gibson', 'Hamlet', 'actually', 'little', 'crazy', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'waters', 'down', 'motivations', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'always', 'have', 'remind', 'watching', 'only', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'so', 'pretty', 'competant', 'job.If', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'Zefferelli', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'have', 'big', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', 'Branaugh', 'Hamlet', 'later', 'year', 'when', 'out']",Hamlet VHS
295409,A2GVX3VN6XR9OA,6302096243,Roman,"[0, 0]","In most movie adaptations of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays, it is necessary to cut some scenes or entire subplots. And this is a great challenge for the directors, who have to decide which parts to be cut and what parts to be invented. The problem is that Shakespeare&#8217;s plays are incredibly precise; there are no scenes and no episodes that are not needed.In the case of &#8220;Hamlet&#8221; it is necessary to recognize that the play is the sequel to &#8220;Measure for Measure&#8221;. The events that led to the current situation in Elsinore are presented in &#8220;The Murder of Gonzago&#8221;, i.e., the play-within-the play presented by a travelling troupe of actors. Upon Hamlet&#8217;s request, the actors staged &#8220;The Murder of Gonzago&#8221;, which supposedly was based on the story he heard from the Ghost. In this story the murderer of the king married the king&#8217;s wife.The actors, however, presented their own adaptation of &#8220;The Murder of Gonzago&#8221;. They included the Ghost&#8217;s story as dumb show, i.e., in the first episode of their performance. And then they added the second episode that took place in Vienna after the conclusion of &#8220;Measure for Measure&#8221;. The second episode illustrates the story of the Duke of Vienna, i.e., the events that took place prior to the murder in Elsinore. The Duke of Vienna is presented as a sick and elderly man. The Duke&#8217;s wife, Baptista, is devotedly attached to her husband. There is no indication that she is deceiving him. The audience will recognize that Gonzago and Baptista represent Duke Vincentio and Isabella 30 years after the conclusion of &#8220;Measure for Measure&#8221;. Lucianus, the Duke&#8217;s nephew, is the murderer. Lucianus represents Hamlet&#8217;s father.However, the players are not able to finish their story, because irritated Hamlet disturbs the performance. He abruptly interrupts the performance by delivering his own line:&#8220;you shall see anon how the murderergets the love of Gonzago&#8217;s wife.&#8221;This is not the Duke&#8217;s killer&#8217;s line. This line belongs to the murderer in the first episode of &#8220;The Murder of Gonzago&#8221;. Hamlet&#8217;s interruption does not allow the actors to finish the second episode.In Zeffirelli&#8217;s production the first episode of &#8220;The Murder of Gonzago&#8221;, i.e., the dumb show is cut off. And this makes impossible for the audience to figure out what is going on. As long as the audience does not realize that Hamlet&#8217;s father was a murderer, so long the Hamlet&#8217;s story will remain incomprehensible.",4,"As long as the audience does not realize that Hamlet&#8217;s father was a murderer, so long the play will remain incomprehensible",1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,2607,"['most', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'Shakespeare', '8217', 'plays', 'necessary', 'cut', 'scenes', 'entire', 'subplots', 'great', 'challenge', 'directors', 'who', 'have', 'decide', 'parts', 'be', 'cut', 'what', 'parts', 'be', 'invented', 'problem', 'Shakespeare', '8217', 'plays', 'are', 'incredibly', 'precise', 'are', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'case', '8220', 'Hamlet', '8221', 'necessary', 'recognize', 'play', 'sequel', '8220', 'Measure', 'Measure', '8221', 'events', 'led', 'current', 'situation', 'Elsinore', 'are', 'presented', '8220', 'Murder', 'Gonzago', '8221', 'i.e.', 'play-within-the', 'play', 'presented', 'travelling', 'troupe', 'actors', 'Hamlet', '8217', 'request', 'actors', 'staged', '8220', 'Murder', 'Gonzago', '8221', 'supposedly', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'heard', 'Ghost', 'story', 'murderer', 'king', 'married', 'king', '8217', 'wife.The', 'actors', 'however', 'presented', 'own', 'adaptation', '8220', 'Murder', 'Gonzago', '8221', 'included', 'Ghost', '8217', 's', 'story', 'dumb', 'show', 'i.e.', 'first', 'episode', 'performance', 'then', 'added', 'second', 'episode', 'took', 'place', 'Vienna', 'conclusion', '8220', 'Measure', 'Measure', '8221', 'second', 'episode', 'story', 'Duke', 'Vienna', 'i.e.', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'prior', 'murder', 'Elsinore', 'Duke', 'Vienna', 'presented', 'sick', 'elderly', 'man', 'Duke', '8217', 's', 'wife', 'Baptista', 'devotedly', 'attached', 'husband', 'indication', 'deceiving', 'audience', 'will', 'recognize', 'Gonzago', 'Baptista', 'represent', 'Duke', 'Vincentio', 'Isabella', '30', 'years', 'conclusion', '8220', 'Measure', 'Measure', '8221', 'Lucianus', 'Duke', '8217', 'nephew', 'murderer', 'Lucianus', 'Hamlet', '8217', 'father.However', 'players', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'finish', 'story', 'irritated', 'Hamlet', 'performance', 'abruptly', 'performance', 'delivering', 'own', 'line', '8220', 'shall', 'see', 'anon', 'how', 'murderergets', 'love', 'Gonzago', '8217', 'wife.', '8221', 'not', 'Duke', '8217', 'killer', '8217', 's', 'line', 'line', 'murderer', 'first', 'episode', '8220', 'Murder', 'Gonzago', '8221', 'Hamlet', '8217', 's', 'interruption', 'not', 'allow', 'actors', 'finish', 'second', 'episode.In', 'Zeffirelli', '8217', 'production', 'first', 'episode', '8220', 'Murder', 'Gonzago', '8221', 'i.e.', 'dumb', 'show', 'cut', 'off', 'impossible', 'audience', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'As', 'long', 'audience', 'not', 'realize', 'Hamlet', '8217', 'father', 'was', 'murderer', 'so', 'long', 'Hamlet', '8217', 'story', 'will', 'remain', 'incomprehensible']",Hamlet VHS

295411,A12O41YU3TZVZA,6302096243,Rudy Avila,"[14, 18]","Of course, the best version is Olivier's 1948 version. No one could master Shakespeare as well as he did, with an ease of voice and command of language and drama. But this modern version is excellent. Fine performances, great cinematography as is always the case under the direction of Franco Zefferelli. He had done of course the 1968 Romeo and Juliet and when his name along with Mel Gibson came out... it was sure to be a great film. And it is. There is not much emphasis on the ghost, nevertheless, only appearing once when he is originally supposed to come out twice, second time in the bedroom scene between Hamlet and his mother. That scene in particular is very distorted in this version. Mel Gibson and Glen Close actually have an incestuous intimate moment that any audience may find disturbing. The tragic endings are well performed. Helena Bohham Carter is a great Ophelia gone mad and Glen Close a pretentious, hypocritical queen. Mel Gibson.. for an actor who has done roles in the Lethal Weapon movies is quite good. Most of the Hamlets in the past, Olivier (though the best) and others are elderly and do not truly fit the original Hamlet the Bard envisioned- a young man out for revenge and that is what we see with Mel Gibson's performace.. a younger and more  vigorous character.. not the &quot;depressed, weak &quot; Hamlet many have recreated in Romanticism.

The images are done with rare delicacy and beauty. The symphony music flatters the images. Gibson is phenomenal as Hamlet. He portrays the many dimensions of Hamlet (his sorrow, his fury, his feigned madness, and his sharpness) quite well. Alan Bates is by far the best Claudius I have ever seen. Claudius is a difficult character to perform because of his many dimensions. He killed his brother, and stole his wife and crown. Yet, he is a reasonable monarch. He is VERY likable when he quells Laertes' raid with pure courage and intelligence. Also, he clearly regrets his murder and suffers for it. I tip my hat to Alan Bates. Scofield is superb as Hamlet's father. He displays pure human sorrow. Laertes is outstanding in his display of his character's multiple dimensions. (A loving son and brother, a revenge driven monster, and a penitent victim.) Ophelia is fine as the helpless pawn, and Gertrude and Polonius are fine as the characters who never see the plainest point. One thing the director avoids is the common mistake that Hamlet is simply stalking Claudius. It is clear in this movie that Hamlet and Claudius are stalking EACH OTHER. Also, this movie outdoes the book in that the filler is eliminated, and the scenes are juggled to make more sense. (Ex. Rather than seeing Hamlet's father's ghost first thing, we see the funeral of Hamlet's father. This makes it more frightening when Hamlet's friends tell him that they have seen his father.)

If I hadn't watched those dumb movies all those years ago, I probably wouldn't have been expecting Mel's Hamlet to suddenly dislocate/relocate his shoulder.Anyway, Mel was pretty good. And Helena Bonham-Carter was REALLY good. After Hamlet stabbed Polonius behind the tapestry, Ophelia came unglued in a really spooky and satisfying way. Her big crazy scene was full of energy from every actor on the set - you could FEEL their ""Ew! Keep away from me!"" emotions jarring around with their terrible grief and pity for what poor, pretty Ophelia had descended into. It was very spine-tingly.I liked Glenn Close a lot as Gertrude. That was definitely a different spin on the role I'd ever seen before, with the guilty queen swanning around with wide, innocent eyes, so happy with her big, strapping new hubby (ick) and so pleased when her darling boy makes the effort to cast off his gloominess and embrace his new daddy (ick more.) Hamlet's ""gotcha"" scene with Gertrude was also very good.Because so much has been cut, this is a great version for kids to watch.

At the time they were looked at like Adam Sandler movies are today.  What's wrong with making his greatest work more accessible to contemporary audiences and possibly setting off a few sparks of interest in folks who may have otherwise been content to spend their $10 on a Happy Gilmore sequel instead?I was an English major in college and spent a lot of time that first semester `decoding the bard'.  It wasn't until my sophomore year that I was able to truly immerse myself in the language and enjoy Shakespeare for what it is.  Had Gibson's Hamlet been around I may have been able to get into the waters a bit quicker.  His performance was riveting and the rest of the cast was simply amazing.  I fell in love with Helena Bonham Carter's Ophelia and nearly cried when she...  Wait!  Spoiler there.  (Yes, Shakespeare can be spoiled for the uninitiated.)One last thing I would like to point out to those who complained about Mel being far too animated and crazed as Hamlet.  Melancholia was considered a medical term in Shakespeare's time.  It was a generic term used to describe a variety of psychological maladies, which included mood swings and possibly even schizophrenia.  Just because Gibson chose to go in a different direction from more traditional interpretations doesn't make him wrong.  He may have been closer to The Bard's vision of the character than Olivier or Richard Burton.  (Maybe.)Regardless, this is at the very least a very entertaining interpretation of a great classic.

295422,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,6302096243,Steven Hancock,"[4, 8]","This is a pretty decent version of my favorite play Shakespeare ever did. Even though I say it is good, it is very soundly beaten by Branagh's version. Mel Gibson, although a great actor, could not pull it off as good as Kenneth Branagh. In this version, Gibson seemed to underact in scenes that I think should have deserved more drama into it (like the &quot;Too, too solid flesh,&quot; and the &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; speeches, and the scene in where Hamlet dies). He also overacted in scenes that shouldn't have been that dramatic (like in the scenes were he first talks to his Father/Uncle, and in his mother's closet). Branagh, on the other hand, pulled it off the way it was meant to be, as Gibson's way was not to be. Was it just me, or did it look like Hamlet was trying to make love to his mother (olayed somewhat well by Glenn Close) in the closet scene, after he had murdered Polonius? In my words, UUUUGGGHHH! The mood was dark, darker than Branagh's version. This version did have some good moments: The fight scene at the end, and Hamlet's confrontation with is father. If there was anything that even trys to make this film be as good or better than Branagh's version is the locations in where they filmed. The castle that they filmed this in was absolutely stunning, and some of the sets were neat looking. But they still couldn't rival the beautiful manor, or the dazzling rooms, in which Branagh's version was filmed. This version also had edited out some very important scenes, like the Norewegian army movements, the scene where the Norwegian prince and the British ambassador arrive, and, might I ad, that changing scenes around, and adding several unimportant scenes, was not great. Branagh's additions did not mess up the storyline. If you wish to see this version, do it only if you do not wish to sit through the four hours that Branagh's version uses to tell the story.

Probably because the play has so many universal themes it is the most popular of his plays.  When I first saw Sir Lawrence Olivier's adaptation I thought there could be no equal.  Mr. Gibson has challenged that thought with a moving and  passionate portrayal.  Mr. Gibson has created nothing short of a new standard for this old favorite.  Ms. Close as the doting but fickle mother sets an equal standard for her part.

I'm also glad to see that they're including some extras.This was the first Shakespeare film to really bring one of his plays to life for me.  Stripped down, but accessible.  If I talk to anyone about checking out one of the Bard's plays, I always point them this way.  Snobs may sniff away, but this is a HAMLET for an audience looking for drama--the same folks who stood in the pit of the Globe 400 years ago.Mel Gibson is one of those rare actors who brings an emotional intensity to a role that can overwhelm his considerable physical presence.  That's definitely on display in HAMLET.  His grief and rage and confusion threaten to push him over the edge, even as he plots to expose his father's murderer, Hamlet's own uncle.The rest of the cast is wonderful: Glenn Close, the late Alan Bates, Helena Bonham Carter.  It was a thrill to see the great Shakespearean actor Paul Scofield as the ghost of Hamlet's father.Hollywood and the Theatre both owe Franco Zefferilli a debt of gratitude: he introduced Shakespeare to new generations of fans (who didn't watch his ROMEO AND JULIET in high school?) and connected the Bard to modern events (casting Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton during Le Scandal in THE TAMING OF THE SHREW was inspired).If you're curious about watching one of Shakespeare's plays and you never have, try this one.",5,Been Waitin' for This,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,1458,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'version', 'HAMLET', 'hit', 'DVD', 'years', 'now', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'first', 'line', 'buy', ""'m"", 'also', 'glad', 'see', ""'re"", 'including', 'extras.This', 'was', 'first', 'Shakespeare', 'film', 'really', 'bring', 'one', 'plays', 'life', 'Stripped', 'down', 'accessible', 'talk', 'anyone', 'checking', 'out', 'one', 'Bard', 'plays', 'always', 'point', 'way', 'Snobs', 'may', 'sniff', 'away', 'HAMLET', 'audience', 'looking', 'drama', 'same', 'folks', 'who', 'stood', 'pit', 'Globe', '400', 'years', 'ago.Mel', 'Gibson', 'one', 'rare', 'actors', 'who', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'role', 'can', 'overwhelm', 'considerable', 'physical', 'presence', 'definitely', 'display', 'HAMLET', 'grief', 'rage', 'confusion', 'threaten', 'push', 'edge', 'even', 'expose', 'father', 'murderer', 'Hamlet', 'own', 'uncle.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'late', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'was', 'thrill', 'see', 'great', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'ghost', 'Hamlet', 'father.Hollywood', 'Theatre', 'owe', 'Franco', 'Zefferilli', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'introduced', 'Shakespeare', 'new', 'generations', 'fans', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'ROMEO', 'AND', 'JULIET', 'high', 'school', 'connected', 'Bard', 'modern', 'events', 'casting', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Le', 'Scandal', 'THE', 'TAMING', 'THE', 'SHREW', 'was', 'inspired', '.If', ""'re"", 'curious', 'watching', 'one', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'never', 'have', 'try', 'one']",Hamlet VHS
295428,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6302096243,Themis-Athena,"[43, 60]","I will be brief; though whether witty, too, as this production is ... why, I know not.For 'tis not a trifle thing to take a play like Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" and cut its lengthAlmost in half, without thus giving up half of its meaning.  Yet, SignorFranco Zeffirelli: even he, who aught already did for ""RomeoAnd Juliet,"" hath made his mark again here in most splendid fashion.The Prince of Denmark's been portrayed by Thespian royalty near and far,First among these the great Sir Laurence.  Yet here now comes Mel Gibson: a mostUnusual choice, 'tis true; and better known for other roles.  But althoughAction star and ladies' favourite, this venture made him humble; justly so:""The play's the thing,"" he says as Hamlet, and as himself, he adds: ""Hamlet belongsOn stage."" And he deplores that merely one of his enactments of each sceneShould be preserved on film forever, and that he never had the chanceTo delve into the role anew from night to night. - Fear not, good Sir: I thinkYou did great honour to the Bard's intent; well understood unhappy Hamlet'sScorn, his rage, his doubts, his terrible paralysis, all his tormented soul.I also do agree that although ten years older than the prince when youTook on the part, those extra years provided further insight of the kindThat's needed for this complex role.  Hadst but maintained you this same sense ofHamlet's gravitas until the end, of my full'st praise you wouldst have been assured.Alas, the levity that you let creep into the final duel with LaertesIn my view ill becomes that scene, and although Hamlet on its eve hath hadA premonition of his death; hath spoke of providence and sparrows,And looking at the sunset sighed, I doubt that when he meets Ophelia's brother,He's so far gone beyond all caring that he'd make light of their encounter.(""The rest is silence,"" too, would have impressed me more without the lisp.)But let that be.  For I do join you in applauding those whoWith you hearkened the appeal of Signor Zeffirelli; and whoMost heartily deserve to share this feature's laurels.  Princes ofBritish theatre: the late, great Alan Bates - usurper Claudius -All ruthless power, cunning, even carnal, brushing away his pangs of guilt;Yet, reck'ning he doth not escape.  Paul Scofield, next, th' ill-fated ghost;Not bearing arms, as Shakespeare wrote, but verily a perturbed spirit,As Hamlet calls him, in his pain.  And Ian Holm as counsellorPolonius: not ponderous, nor slow of tongue and eye but quick, and yetSlain by the prince, in Claudius's place.  They all have stood on stage a hundred times,And brought to life the Bard's great plays, so well doth it behove one new, as Master GibsonIs, to Shakespeare's world to credit them for lessons learned; and not just for their acting.Also permit me, pray, to speak about the ladies in this male-dictated play:Glenn Close's Gertrude, youthful queen, who gives the lie to Hamlet's chideAnd his unmerciful reminder of her flesh's humbleness, and of herAge.  A bit too Freudian, perchance, her and her son's relationship(That's an approach I've never liked).  But a commanding presence, all be told.Yet, even more praiseworthy is Miss Hel'na Bonham-Carter; herOphelia well-neigh impossible to replicate, she's *that* convincing.Now rose in bloom, in love; now in distress, now finally in lunacy; she wails,Her hair is tangled, clothes in rags, prophetic words she speaks disguised asSongs and flower talk, before she drowns and thus propels this drama's end.What else?  Oh aye, of course: Kudos must also go to David Watkin,In charge of camera, and Signors Ennio Morricone and Feretti- by first name Dante - for this film's score and the design of its production.Faithful reporting, too, would be amiss without a word on Hamlet's foils:Horatio, his school fellow, in Stephen Dillane's able hands, as isLaertes in Nathaniel Parker's; and Trevor Peacock as the gravedigger,Spot-on: a diamond in the rough.  As player king, moreover, have aLook out for Pete Postlethwaite; and unlike the movie by OlivierThis one includes both Rosencrantz and Guildenstern - Michael Maloney andSean Murray.  Fortinbras, though, you'll search in vain in this production, too.The words, of course, are those of Shakespeare, though moved around a bit, but not inWays that by and large, methinks, the Bard would take exception to.  Save, that is,""Get thee to a nunnery,"" which doth assume a diff'rent connotation here:A kinder, gentler Hamlet, who still contrives to show some care about Ophelia.(But would he really?  Nay, I think not.)  ""To be or not to be"" not in theCourtyard but the crypt, however, that is amazingly intense: bothThe performance and the imagery.  As generally ZeffirelliIn troth well uses film's ability to convey meaning visually, asIn the burial of Hamlet Senior, the prince's wordless visit toOphelia, and in the punishment of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.But let me close now.  Brief I would be, that was my promise - well, there goes that.Such is reviewing!  Yet, what I wish, in faith, dear reader, thou hadst foundWithin these lines is that I recommend this film.

The soliloques are terrible compared to the Branagh version. The best one is from the Olivier one though that one was done in 1948, it won the best picture and best actor. Gibson does not have the polish and his interactions with Ophelia are not well done. He should stick to the type of roles that he is best suited for and leave these to better actors.The sad part is that he has an image now and people see this version as the Olivier version is not easily available.

295432,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,6302096243,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[1, 1]","I liked this movie the first time I saw it. Hamlet gets the dour treatment so often, that it's kind of novel to see him as an action hero. Unfortunately, it does not hold up to repeat viewings. Zeferelli is not a great director and his versions of classic texts tend to be both stupid and pretty. Besides Mel Gibson, he gives us the most standard version of these characters. Ian Holm plays Polonius with a pompous air. Helena Bonham Carter is innocent and then she's crazy (but not nearly as crazy as she got to be in later movies likeFight Club- one can imagine her full blown crazy Ophelia stopping when introduced to Marla and going ""geez lady, get a grip"") and the other characters follow their preconceived notions. These are good actors trapped in the Cliff Notes.The one character that isn't the traditional version is Gibson's Hamlet and that's not necessarily a good thing. As much as it's a novelty watching Mel Gibson gives us a manly bullying version of Hamlet (whose crazy scenes are simply for the sake of making people believe that he's crazy so he can make out with his mom), there's a certain point where the action movie version of Gibson takes over and he can't stop being the ""whacky but loveable"" hero of the movie. For me, the moment when he flails around with the sword in the duel scene and then winks at Glenn Close was the nauseating culmination of the unease that I felt with this acting from the beginning. This is a man who cannot stop playing Mel Gibson and as much as that kind of works for Hamlet, it does not work all the way.

Gibson brings a physical sense to the lead role that I've never seen before, and it works. He's always done well playing unstable, potentially explosive characters - face it, that's Hamlet.Ophelia worked well, too. She seemed to struggle, in the play scene, placed in a grown-up situation and not quite sure how to act grown up. She later fell back into over-dramatic snits and weepy romanticism. That sure looked like a teenage girl to me. I was interested by Ophelia's choices in clothing - gray, in many scenes, and the least colorful of all the costumes on stage. I felt that, if she'd hold still for a moment, she'd simply vanish against the gray stone of Elsinore's walls. Perhaps she wasn't so different from a modern girl affecting a black-on-black wardrobe - both trying to attract attention and to avoid it at the same time.Elsinore and it surrounding country-side were wonderful, and almost became characters themselves. Brooding, stark, and solid, it seemed almost to ignore the player's doings inside, as if it were above such transient events. I was a bit disappointed, however, that the castle was so bare. Castles were cold and echoic - any king that could afford the labor involved in building a castle could also afford carpets, wall hangings, and other furnishings to make it look lived in. Elsinore didn't look like a working structure, more like a near-ruin with strangers wandering around inside.I was careful to say that I like the acting - vivid physicality really brought the characters to life for me. I wasn't so thrilled with the recitation of the script, though. Elizabethan English is very nearly a foreign language, with a rhythm and flow of its own. Gibson, in particular, sounded as if he had learned the lines without learning the language. Lacking the cues of meter and sound, I sometimes found the listening hard.There are lots of good renderings of Hamlet, and this is another good one.

This version of ""Hamlet""-- directed by Franco Zeffirelli and starring Helena Bonham Carter as Ophelia-- is head and shoulders above Kenneth Branagh's pompous, pretentious, self-indulgent four-hour take on the classic. Zeffirelli sticks to what matters most in the story, including (obviously) Hamlet's revenge saga, Ophelia's not-so-happy journey, and a very touching take on the philosophical subtext. The movie is set in gorgeous medieval locations (unlike Branagh's overly bright and opulent 19th-century sets) and employs a dandy music score by the legendary Ennio Morricone (""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""). This version draws a lot of criticism from people who have either never seen it or are the disciples of Branagh. Mel Gibson's performance is not a masterpiece, but it is pretty far ahead of most of his other work both as an actor and director. Helena Bonham Carter gives the performance of a lifetime, though, and Glenn Close (Gertrude), Alan Bates (Claudius), and Paul Scofield (the Ghost) are superb.

The film was shot entirely on location in real castles, it has amazing photography by David Watkin and a great score by Ennio Morricone...",5,THE BEST FILM ADAPTATION OF HAMLET,1059523200,"07 30, 2003",2003,639,"['Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'Hamlet', 'definitive', 'film', 'adaptation', 'most', 'famous', 'play', 'ever', 'written', 'brilliant', 'film', 'genius', 'filmmaker', 'version', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'overblown', 'version', 'even', 'better', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'film.This', 'very', 'realistic', 'natural', 'version', 'set', '13th', 'Century', 'period', 'Shakespeare', 'set', 'play', 'acting', 'amazing', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Glen', 'Close', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'careers', 'everyone', 'else', 'also', 'fantastic', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'location', 'real', 'castles', 'amazing', 'photography', 'David', 'Watkin', 'great', 'score', 'Ennio', 'Morricone']",Hamlet VHS
