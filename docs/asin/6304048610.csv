398229,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,6304048610,CGScammell,"[0, 0]","This documentary is one of Ken Burns' earliest works (in cooperation with Buddy Squires).  Renowned for his great dramatic shooting angles, usage of local musicians (in this case Paul Simon's American Tune, a famed New Yorker), archival photography and old video/movie clips and talking heads, any Ken Burns fan like myself will see how his craft has matured over the last 25 years: there is more drama in his later works, and wordless scenes are often the lengths of entire songs.This is only an hour long, and if you take away the music and the many beautiful fly-overs of the statue or the long silent replays of black/white photographs of proud, scared and relieved new immigrants arriving at Ellis Island and looking over the statue, this could easily be a fast 30-minute documentary.  But why rush?Narrated by David McCullough who has narrated many of Burn's earlier works, the other half of this production is peoples' renditions of their idea of liberty.  It's nice to see the late James Baldwin or Barbara Jordan speak of their rendition of liberty as so many black slaves lived never to experience true liberty.The idea of this sculptor derived from Frederic Auguste Bartholi who had been inspired by the freedoms of black slaves in 1865.  Bartholdi came to this country to select the location, but left this country ""not sure if he really liked the United States"" says McCullough.  The statue's full name is ""Liberty Enlightening the World.""Covering the idea of the construction of this statue, we see old photographs of French sculptors building this by hand, seeing it shipped to this country, and then erected off an island belonging to New Jersey and facing New York Harbor.This is a nice addition to something so connected to this country, and goes well with another Burns' work, ""The Brooklyn Bridge"" and or the documentary ""Forgotten Ellis Island"" directed by Lorie Conway.",4,A loving tribute,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,1891,"['documentary', 'one', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'earliest', 'works', 'cooperation', 'Buddy', 'Squires', 'Renowned', 'great', 'dramatic', 'shooting', 'angles', 'usage', 'local', 'musicians', 'case', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'American', 'Tune', 'famed', 'New', 'Yorker', 'archival', 'photography', 'old', 'video/movie', 'clips', 'talking', 'heads', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'fan', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'craft', 'matured', 'last', '25', 'years', 'more', 'drama', 'later', 'works', 'wordless', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'lengths', 'entire', 'songs.This', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'take', 'away', 'music', 'many', 'beautiful', 'fly-overs', 'statue', 'long', 'silent', 'replays', 'black/white', 'photographs', 'proud', 'scared', 'relieved', 'new', 'immigrants', 'arriving', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'looking', 'statue', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'fast', '30-minute', 'documentary', 'why', 'rush', 'Narrated', 'David', 'McCullough', 'who', 'narrated', 'many', 'Burn', 'earlier', 'works', 'other', 'half', 'production', 'peoples', 'renditions', 'idea', 'liberty', 'nice', 'see', 'late', 'James', 'Baldwin', 'Barbara', 'Jordan', 'speak', 'rendition', 'liberty', 'so', 'many', 'black', 'slaves', 'lived', 'never', 'experience', 'true', 'liberty.The', 'idea', 'sculptor', 'derived', 'Frederic', 'Auguste', 'Bartholi', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'inspired', 'freedoms', 'black', 'slaves', '1865', 'Bartholdi', 'came', 'country', 'select', 'location', 'left', 'country', 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'liked', 'United', 'States', 'McCullough', 'statue', 'full', 'name', 'Liberty', 'Enlightening', 'World', 'Covering', 'idea', 'construction', 'statue', 'see', 'old', 'photographs', 'French', 'sculptors', 'building', 'hand', 'seeing', 'shipped', 'country', 'then', 'erected', 'off', 'island', 'belonging', 'New', 'Jersey', 'facing', 'New', 'York', 'Harbor.This', 'nice', 'addition', 'something', 'so', 'connected', 'country', 'well', 'Burns', 'work', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'documentary', 'Forgotten', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'directed', 'Lorie', 'Conway']",N/A

It is an honest portrayal of the beautiful ideal of liberty, but also political challenges and problems associated with its application.

Initially, the statue was supposed to be set up in Egypt - to be a modern counterpart to the majestic pieces such as the ""Sphinx.""  Only later did the French decide to give it as a gift to America.  The extraordinary challenges of its engineering  (before the skyscraper was born) needed the genius of Eiffel of France. Then, the problem was that America was supposed to pay for the pedestal...and the wealthy elite would not put up the money.  Pulitzer asked for donations from all Americans in his paper, ""The New York World""...and that is how the pedestal was funded...with contributions usually ranging from one dollar or even twenty five cents.One issue I had with the film is that so little is given of the history of Emma Lazarus who wrote the poem that celebrated the Statue of Liberty.  ""Her"" story should be as important as the copper statue itself.  One of the strengths is that Ken Burns presents many images from magazines, papers, political cartoons, that have used the Statue of Liberty as a symbol of America...both good and bad.Overall, a very interesting essay.

398242,A16QODENBJVUI1,6304048610,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","I remembered watching this on PBS when it was first shown. I did not know who Ken Burns was, even after seeing this. It was only after THE CIVIL WAR (when I was dating a woman who was a friend of Burns at Hampshire College) that I really became conscious of him. I then learned that he had also done THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, HUEY LONG, and THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE, all of which confirmed to me that he was someone whose work I needed to follow. Given the excellence of his many projects since then, I needn't have worried about keeping track of him. Watching his most recent series, on the National Park system, has caused me to go back and watch many of his earlier documentaries. Burns is still a relatively young man and when he has finished the entire body of his work could well be used to introduce an alien from another planet to the United States. It is absolutely astonishing how much of American life he has chronicled in his films. I can't wait to see what he will do next.Americans really hate the French today. I do not, even though I don't eat French cuisine (I'm vegetarian and it isn't, unlike Italian cuisine, vegetarian friendly). I don't drink wine. I unfortunately do not speak French. But I've never understood the hatred of the French. So many things that we love in modern life originated in France, and the country has generated an astonishing literature and film industry. I love French painting and much French music. And I love things French from many different periods, such as Montaigne and Rabelais from the 16th century to Racine in the 17th century to Montesquieu and Rousseau in the 18th century to Tocqueville, Flaubert, and Balzac in the 19th century to Proust, Sartre, Foucault, and countless others in the 20th. And the help that the French rendered to the colonies in the Revolutionary War and the joint efforts in the two world wars shows a long record of cooperation. I know that many today hate the French because of the opposition of the French to the invasion of Iraq. But most Americans today take pretty much the same position that the French did and probably wish that they'd been more successful in opposing us. But we ought to think more about how this was a gift to America from France.And what a great gift it was! In fact, have we ever received a finer one? Try to think of New York or America or even the world without it. We would be impoverished without it. I vividly remember going up into it at a time when you could go into the crown. My lone regret was that there were so many people that we could only stay for a few seconds before having to rush off. My boss's boss has an office in Jersey City. If he turns in his chair slightly to his left he can gaze out both on Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. What a great view!The best thing about this documentary is the amazing photos used throughout. It is fascinating to see the bits and pieces of the Statue of Liberty, many of them quite familiar. one shot, for instance, of the arm holding the torch standing on a French boulevard is striking, and there is a haunting photo of the face with scaffolding around it is especially memorable. There is another with the dissembled torch sitting beside the head.I loved learning about how the engineer Eifel, who would later build the famous tower, build the internal scaffolding that held the various bits of the statue together. Frankly, there wasn't as much content in this film as much as in Burns's other films, but the great archival footage made up for that. I would have loved to see more photos of the statue being assembled in New York. Surely there are some photos. But that is one of the things that Burns's best films do: they make you want to learn more. In fact, I think I'm going to check right now to see if there are some good photo books on the building and assembling of the Statue.",4,A wonderful early Ken Burns documentary,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,3853,"['remembered', 'watching', 'PBS', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'was', 'even', 'seeing', 'was', 'only', 'THE', 'CIVIL', 'WAR', 'when', 'was', 'dating', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'friend', 'Burns', 'Hampshire', 'College', 'really', 'became', 'conscious', 'then', 'learned', 'had', 'also', 'done', 'THE', 'STATUE', 'OF', 'LIBERTY', 'HUEY', 'LONG', 'THE', 'BROOKLYN', 'BRIDGE', 'confirmed', 'was', 'someone', 'work', 'needed', 'follow', 'Given', 'excellence', 'many', 'projects', 'then', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'keeping', 'track', 'Watching', 'most', 'recent', 'series', 'National', 'Park', 'system', 'caused', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'many', 'earlier', 'documentaries', 'Burns', 'still', 'relatively', 'young', 'man', 'when', 'finished', 'entire', 'body', 'work', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'used', 'introduce', 'alien', 'planet', 'United', 'States', 'absolutely', 'astonishing', 'how', 'much', 'American', 'life', 'chronicled', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'next.Americans', 'really', 'hate', 'French', 'today', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'French', 'cuisine', ""'m"", 'vegetarian', ""n't"", 'Italian', 'cuisine', 'vegetarian', 'friendly', 'do', ""n't"", 'drink', 'wine', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'French', ""'ve"", 'never', 'understood', 'hatred', 'French', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'love', 'modern', 'life', 'originated', 'France', 'country', 'generated', 'astonishing', 'literature', 'film', 'industry', 'love', 'French', 'painting', 'much', 'French', 'music', 'love', 'things', 'French', 'many', 'different', 'periods', 'such', 'Montaigne', 'Rabelais', '16th', 'century', 'Racine', '17th', 'century', 'Montesquieu', 'Rousseau', '18th', 'century', 'Tocqueville', 'Flaubert', 'Balzac', '19th', 'century', 'Proust', 'Sartre', 'Foucault', 'countless', 'others', '20th', 'help', 'French', 'rendered', 'colonies', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'joint', 'efforts', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'long', 'record', 'cooperation', 'know', 'many', 'today', 'hate', 'French', 'opposition', 'French', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'most', 'Americans', 'today', 'take', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'position', 'French', 'did', 'probably', 'wish', ""'d"", 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'opposing', 'ought', 'think', 'more', 'how', 'was', 'gift', 'America', 'France.And', 'what', 'great', 'gift', 'was', 'fact', 'have', 'ever', 'received', 'finer', 'one', 'Try', 'think', 'New', 'York', 'America', 'even', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'impoverished', 'vividly', 'remember', 'going', 'up', 'time', 'when', 'could', 'go', 'crown', 'lone', 'regret', 'was', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'only', 'stay', 'few', 'seconds', 'having', 'rush', 'off', 'boss', 'boss', 'office', 'Jersey', 'City', 'chair', 'slightly', 'left', 'can', 'gaze', 'out', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'What', 'great', 'view', 'best', 'thing', 'documentary', 'amazing', 'photos', 'used', 'fascinating', 'see', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'many', 'quite', 'familiar', 'one', 'shot', 'instance', 'arm', 'holding', 'torch', 'standing', 'French', 'boulevard', 'striking', 'haunting', 'photo', 'face', 'scaffolding', 'especially', 'memorable', 'dissembled', 'torch', 'sitting', 'head.I', 'loved', 'learning', 'how', 'engineer', 'Eifel', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'build', 'famous', 'tower', 'build', 'internal', 'scaffolding', 'held', 'various', 'bits', 'statue', 'together', 'Frankly', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'content', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Burns', 'other', 'films', 'great', 'archival', 'footage', 'made', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'photos', 'statue', 'being', 'assembled', 'New', 'York', 'Surely', 'are', 'photos', 'one', 'things', 'Burns', 'best', 'films', 'do', 'make', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'fact', 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'check', 'right', 'now', 'see', 'are', 'good', 'photo', 'books', 'building', 'assembling', 'Statue']",N/A

I get it and I agree. Burns' shows are also about racial predudice & exclusion. I get it. Maybe I'm the wrong one to evaluate this documentary because I'm fully aware - ad nauseum - of our country's failings. Perhaps Mr. Burns isn't speaking to me. As much as I enjoy the subject matter - by title - of his documentaries (Baseball, Jazz, WWII, etc.)(his Civil War series being the exception for why slavery is intregal to the story), I am tired of the unrelenting drum beat of how inhumane our American ancestors were to African-Americans. I GET IT. I've already acknowledged that it was horrible. Why does he weave this theme into every documentary? How much guilt-blood does he want to extract from me?Look, the abhorrance of slavery goes back to before the ancient Egyptians. They did it. So did the Romans. So did countries in Africa. And none of those actions and policies were humane or right. But why the singular and constant drumbeat into perpetuity about that horrible part of OUR history? Try as I might, searching through 100's of TV stations on a weekly basis (including international stations), can I find 'Egyptian guilt' or 'Roman guilt' about slavery. In fact, even present-day slavery in Africa is difficult to find on TV. But not in the U.S. when it comes to us. There seems to be an agenda amongst the Hollywood entertainment crowd that wants us to be singled out - to stand alone in unrelenting shame about our American past. Mr. Burns has ridden that horse to where I just can't watch anymore of his crusade to promote guilt.We are also the country that produced Abraham Lincoln; and Eisnhower who sent troops to Little Rock to enforce desegragation; we are the country of JFK and LBJ who focused on and championed civil rights and liberties; we are the country that strives to undo our wrongs.
