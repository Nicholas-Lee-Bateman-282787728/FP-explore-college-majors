471264,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6305617791,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Mary Pickford (1892-1979) is generally considered the first mass media star.  Although she trained for and worked on the stage, about 1910 she began to work in silent films, and soon emerged as an audience favorite.  Over the course of her career she made over fifty feature films and countless shorts.  Throughout most of her career, Pickford specialized in playing children and teenage girls,a nd she would remain popular in these roles well into her thirties.  Her divorce from husband Douglas Fairbanks, the arrival of sound, and alcoholism put an end to her career by 1933--but her sharp business dealings not only paved the way for actor-producers, but left her extraordinarily wealthy to the end of her life.WHAT THE DAISY SAID is a fifteen minute short dating from Pickford's earliest work around 1910.  Directed by D.W. Griffith, the simple story finds two rather silly girls (Mary Pickford and Gertrude Robinson) playing ""he loves me, he loves me not"" with daisies plucked from a field and rejecting the local boys in favor of an exotic gypsy, who romances first one and then the other.  When his perfidy is uncovered, the gypsy is run out of town, and Mary decides that a local boy may not be as exotic but he is certainly more dependable.  The short is a flyweight, interesting only because Griffith directed it and Pickford appeared in it, amusing but not really indicative of the powers of either artist.DADDY-LONG-LEGS, however, is a feature film, and it dates from 1919, when Pickford was easily one of the greatest stars on the screen.  The film is directed by Marshall Neiland, who had previously directed Pickford in several extremely successful films, including REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM and THE LITTLE PRINCESS.  Although Pickford was actually about twenty-seven years old when the film was made, it presents her as a much-abused child who keeps her sense of humor and love for others even as she suffers through considerable cruelty at a harsh orphanage.  She is eventually recognized as particularly intelligent, and an unknown benefactor sends her to college.  Although the benefactor wishes to remain anonymous, she writes to him frequently, addressing him as ""Daddy Long Legs"" due to the brief, long-legged shadow she saw of him while still at the orphanage.  Over the years he becomes enchanted with her letters and, although both must endure the usual complications, they eventually meet, his true identity is revealed, and in spite of the difference in their years they fall in love.DADDY-LONG-LEGS is in some ways an unusual Pickford film, for although it first presents her as a child it also allows her to mature into a young woman.  But the film is inconsistent in these two parts: as a child at the orphanage, Pickford is distinctly bumptious and ill-educated, more good humored and kind than intelligent; as a teenager and young woman in college, however, she is suddenly presented as smart and talented, and she becomes the author of a popular book.  The division is more than a little jolting, but Pickford carries both well, in spite of the fact that the second half drags a bit.  The prints on this DVD are very good instead of flawless--few silent films are.  If you are interested in Mary Pickford, this is not a bad place to start; established fans, however, will no doubt favor other titles such as POLLYANNA, LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY, and perhaps most famous in quality, SPARROWS.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Webster Armstrong",4,Flawed But Entertaining Pickford Vehicle with Additional Griffith Short,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,3473,"['Mary', 'Pickford', '1892-1979', 'generally', 'considered', 'first', 'mass', 'media', 'star', 'trained', 'worked', 'stage', '1910', 'began', 'work', 'silent', 'films', 'soon', 'emerged', 'audience', 'favorite', 'course', 'career', 'made', 'over', 'fifty', 'feature', 'films', 'countless', 'shorts', 'most', 'career', 'Pickford', 'specialized', 'playing', 'children', 'teenage', 'girls', 'nd', 'would', 'remain', 'popular', 'roles', 'well', 'thirties', 'divorce', 'husband', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'arrival', 'sound', 'alcoholism', 'put', 'end', 'career', '1933', 'sharp', 'business', 'dealings', 'not', 'only', 'paved', 'way', 'actor-producers', 'left', 'extraordinarily', 'wealthy', 'end', 'life.WHAT', 'THE', 'DAISY', 'SAID', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'short', 'dating', 'Pickford', 'earliest', 'work', 'around', '1910', 'Directed', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'simple', 'story', 'two', 'rather', 'silly', 'girls', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'Gertrude', 'Robinson', 'playing', 'not', 'daisies', 'plucked', 'field', 'rejecting', 'local', 'boys', 'favor', 'exotic', 'gypsy', 'who', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'other', 'When', 'perfidy', 'uncovered', 'gypsy', 'run', 'town', 'Mary', 'local', 'boy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'exotic', 'certainly', 'more', 'dependable', 'short', 'flyweight', 'interesting', 'only', 'Griffith', 'directed', 'Pickford', 'appeared', 'amusing', 'not', 'really', 'indicative', 'powers', 'artist.DADDY-LONG-LEGS', 'however', 'feature', 'film', '1919', 'when', 'Pickford', 'was', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'stars', 'screen', 'film', 'directed', 'Marshall', 'Neiland', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'directed', 'Pickford', 'several', 'extremely', 'successful', 'films', 'including', 'REBECCA', 'OF', 'SUNNYBROOK', 'FARM', 'THE', 'LITTLE', 'PRINCESS', 'Pickford', 'was', 'actually', 'twenty-seven', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'much-abused', 'child', 'who', 'sense', 'humor', 'love', 'others', 'even', 'considerable', 'cruelty', 'harsh', 'orphanage', 'eventually', 'recognized', 'particularly', 'intelligent', 'unknown', 'benefactor', 'college', 'benefactor', 'remain', 'anonymous', 'frequently', 'addressing', 'Daddy', 'Long', 'Legs', 'due', 'brief', 'long-legged', 'shadow', 'saw', 'still', 'orphanage', 'years', 'enchanted', 'letters', 'must', 'endure', 'usual', 'complications', 'eventually', 'meet', 'true', 'identity', 'revealed', 'spite', 'difference', 'years', 'fall', 'love.DADDY-LONG-LEGS', 'ways', 'unusual', 'Pickford', 'film', 'first', 'child', 'also', 'mature', 'young', 'woman', 'film', 'inconsistent', 'two', 'parts', 'child', 'orphanage', 'Pickford', 'distinctly', 'bumptious', 'ill-educated', 'more', 'good', 'humored', 'kind', 'intelligent', 'teenager', 'young', 'woman', 'college', 'however', 'suddenly', 'presented', 'smart', 'talented', 'author', 'popular', 'book', 'division', 'more', 'little', 'jolting', 'Pickford', 'well', 'spite', 'fact', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'prints', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'instead', 'flawless', 'few', 'silent', 'films', 'are', 'are', 'interested', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'not', 'bad', 'place', 'start', 'established', 'fans', 'however', 'will', 'doubt', 'favor', 'other', 'titles', 'such', 'POLLYANNA', 'LITTLE', 'LORD', 'FAUNTLEROY', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'quality', 'SPARROWS.GFT', 'Amazon', 'ReviewerIn', 'Memory', 'Webster', 'Armstrong']",N/A

471266,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,6305617791,Mr Peter G George,"[15, 15]","Daddy Long Legs is a wonderful example of Mary Pickford's talent for portraying adolescent girls even when she herself was much older. She was 26 when the film was made in 1919, but she is convincing even when she plays a 12-year-old orphan and is quite captivating when she grows up to go to college. Pickford may have gone on playing the teenager a little too long. Some of her later films stretch credibility too much, but this is not the case here. Interestingly this DVD includes a Biograph short from 1910, What the Daisy Said, where 17-year-old Mary appears to be older than in many of her later roles. Ironically, at this time she wanted to appear older than she was and it has been said that one of the reasons why she left Biograph was that Griffith would not allow her to develop into full adult roles.Daddy Long Legs starts as a sort of expos&eacute; of an orphanage. There is one particularly gruesome scene of Mary being deliberately burned on a stove as a punishment. The picture gets redder and redder to emphasise the pain and the heat. But the story also has moments of fine comedy to counterbalance the more serious elements. Pickford makes a fine comic drunk and a scene where she pretends to be strangled with her own arm is as good a piece of comic ingenuity as I have seen. When she leaves the orphanage the film becomes a delightful romance. This love story keeps the viewer guessing, and shows the many faces of love, the joy as well as the despair. It is wholly believable.The picture quality of this film is almost perfect. There is some occasional fading of the image and brief moments of apparent damage, but overall the restoration is extremely good. The picture is tinted and uses a number of colours to accompany the variations in the settings and the moods of the scenes. The titles are especially noteworthy as many of them include drawings which along with the words comment on the action. The chamber music for this film fits in well with the action. It is well played and includes some fine themes.As I mentioned this DVD contains a Biograph short. It is about 12 minutes long and is very welcome as an additional feature. I've only seen about 10 of the hundreds of films Griffith made at Biograph and on the whole find them difficult to appreciate. These early shorts are possibly the hardest of films for the modern viewer to grasp. Nevertheless, a film like What the Daisy Said is intriguing and in a curious way entertaining. It makes me want to find out more about this period of filmmaking. Someone should bring out a series of DVD's featuring Biograph shorts.",5,A Film of Pain and Romance,983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,2603,"['Daddy', 'Long', 'Legs', 'wonderful', 'example', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'talent', 'portraying', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'older', 'was', '26', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1919', 'convincing', 'even', 'when', '12-year-old', 'orphan', 'quite', 'captivating', 'when', 'up', 'go', 'college', 'Pickford', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'playing', 'teenager', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'later', 'films', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Interestingly', 'DVD', 'Biograph', 'short', '1910', 'What', 'Daisy', 'Said', 'where', '17-year-old', 'Mary', 'be', 'older', 'many', 'later', 'roles', 'Ironically', 'time', 'wanted', 'appear', 'older', 'was', 'been', 'said', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'left', 'Biograph', 'was', 'Griffith', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'develop', 'full', 'adult', 'roles.Daddy', 'Long', 'Legs', 'sort', 'expos', 'eacute', 'orphanage', 'one', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'Mary', 'being', 'deliberately', 'burned', 'stove', 'punishment', 'picture', 'redder', 'redder', 'emphasise', 'pain', 'heat', 'story', 'also', 'moments', 'fine', 'comedy', 'counterbalance', 'more', 'serious', 'elements', 'Pickford', 'fine', 'comic', 'drunk', 'scene', 'where', 'be', 'strangled', 'own', 'arm', 'as', 'good', 'piece', 'comic', 'ingenuity', 'have', 'seen', 'When', 'orphanage', 'film', 'delightful', 'romance', 'love', 'story', 'viewer', 'guessing', 'many', 'love', 'joy', 'as', 'well', 'despair', 'wholly', 'believable.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'film', 'almost', 'perfect', 'occasional', 'fading', 'image', 'brief', 'moments', 'apparent', 'damage', 'restoration', 'extremely', 'good', 'picture', 'tinted', 'number', 'colours', 'accompany', 'variations', 'settings', 'moods', 'scenes', 'titles', 'are', 'especially', 'noteworthy', 'many', 'include', 'drawings', 'along', 'words', 'comment', 'action', 'chamber', 'music', 'film', 'well', 'action', 'well', 'played', 'fine', 'themes.As', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'Biograph', 'short', '12', 'minutes', 'long', 'very', 'welcome', 'additional', 'feature', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', '10', 'hundreds', 'films', 'Griffith', 'made', 'Biograph', 'whole', 'find', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'early', 'shorts', 'are', 'possibly', 'hardest', 'films', 'modern', 'viewer', 'grasp', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'What', 'Daisy', 'Said', 'intriguing', 'curious', 'way', 'entertaining', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'period', 'filmmaking', 'Someone', 'should', 'bring', 'out', 'series', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'Biograph', 'shorts']",N/A
471267,AK61LQI92GTCH,6305617791,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[4, 5]","A baby is found in a trashcan, wrapped in newspapers, and grows up to be Mary Pickford.The baby, as was probably common for all post-Oliver Twist melodramas, is haphazardly named by the stern mistress of the orphanage after riffling through a phone books and surveying a clump of headstones.The silent DADDY-LONG-LEGS is two movies delicately joined.  The first follows the fortunes of young Jerusha `Judy' Abbott (Pickford) in the orphanage.  From the second half comes the title of the film.  A wealthy benefactor wishes to send Pickford to college, and, importantly, maintain his anonymity.  The only glimpse she catches of him is his tall shadow.  Hence Daddy-Long-Legs.There's a welcome dose of comedy in the first half.  Melodramas set in orphanages, especially silent ones, can be pretty rough going.  Fortunately this one only kills one child and burns one thieving hand.  It could be worse. The movie offsets the heavy stuff with an amusing scene with an inebriated dog and a cute look at the headquarters of Dan Cupid, un-LTD, replete with a gaggle of winged and diaper-clad toddlers intent on throwing or two at pretty Miss Pickford.  The second half is a tale of love finding the delicate heroine with a terrible secret.I enjoyed DADDY-LONG-LEGS quite a bit.  Whatever made Mary Pickford ""America's Sweetheart"" almost a hundred years ago still works today.  Watching the movie took a little bit of adjustment, though.  The orphanage melodrama was about as thick as Queen Victoria's girdle, and title cards saying ""Why did she raise her hair and lengthen her skirts?"" confused a bit more than they enlightened.  The social stigma associated with being an orphan seems dated, as well.The other film on this disk also features Mary Pickford.  WHAT THE DAISY SAID was directed by D.W. Griffith in 1910 and is a very short take on two sisters (Pickford and Gertrude Robinson) being seduced by a gigolo of a palm-reading Gypsy.  The moral seems to be to trust flowers more than men who wrap their heads in handkerchiefs.",4,Daddy Long Legs,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,2026,"['baby', 'found', 'trashcan', 'wrapped', 'newspapers', 'up', 'be', 'Mary', 'Pickford.The', 'baby', 'was', 'probably', 'common', 'post-Oliver', 'Twist', 'melodramas', 'haphazardly', 'named', 'stern', 'mistress', 'orphanage', 'riffling', 'phone', 'books', 'surveying', 'clump', 'headstones.The', 'silent', 'DADDY-LONG-LEGS', 'two', 'movies', 'delicately', 'joined', 'first', 'fortunes', 'young', 'Jerusha', 'Judy', 'Abbott', 'Pickford', 'orphanage', 'second', 'half', 'title', 'film', 'wealthy', 'benefactor', 'wishes', 'send', 'Pickford', 'college', 'importantly', 'maintain', 'anonymity', 'only', 'glimpse', 'tall', 'shadow', 'Hence', 'Daddy-Long-Legs.There', 'welcome', 'dose', 'comedy', 'first', 'half', 'Melodramas', 'set', 'orphanages', 'especially', 'silent', 'ones', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'rough', 'going', 'Fortunately', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'child', 'one', 'thieving', 'hand', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'movie', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'amusing', 'scene', 'inebriated', 'dog', 'cute', 'look', 'headquarters', 'Dan', 'Cupid', 'un-LTD', 'replete', 'gaggle', 'winged', 'diaper-clad', 'toddlers', 'intent', 'throwing', 'two', 'pretty', 'Miss', 'Pickford', 'second', 'half', 'tale', 'love', 'finding', 'delicate', 'heroine', 'terrible', 'secret.I', 'enjoyed', 'DADDY-LONG-LEGS', 'quite', 'bit', 'made', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'almost', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'today', 'Watching', 'movie', 'took', 'little', 'bit', 'adjustment', 'though', 'orphanage', 'melodrama', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'thick', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'girdle', 'title', 'cards', 'saying', 'Why', 'did', 'raise', 'hair', 'skirts', 'confused', 'bit', 'more', 'enlightened', 'social', 'stigma', 'associated', 'being', 'orphan', 'dated', 'well.The', 'other', 'film', 'disk', 'also', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'WHAT', 'THE', 'DAISY', 'SAID', 'was', 'directed', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', '1910', 'very', 'short', 'take', 'two', 'sisters', 'Pickford', 'Gertrude', 'Robinson', 'being', 'seduced', 'gigolo', 'palm-reading', 'Gypsy', 'moral', 'be', 'trust', 'flowers', 'more', 'men', 'who', 'wrap', 'heads', 'handkerchiefs']",N/A
