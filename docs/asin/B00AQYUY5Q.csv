Don't get me wrong: it is good. But in my opinion, it isn't five-stars great. It has action in abundance and Philip Glenister plays the likable 'tough-guy"" with his usual aplomb,  He's a slightly shabby private investigator who gets embroiled in a situation he doesn't understand by a beautiful and mysterious woman he cannot resist. (Kind of a cliche, yes? But no matter . . . .) Before he knows it, his own life is in danger -- but by whom? And more to the point, why? How does his own past have a bearing on this case?  Having sat through all the episodes (and having enjoyed them to some extent) I still am unsure of the plot details. The action tends to obscure the limitations of the plot line and carries the viewer along in the swiftness of its wake. It is entertaining to be sure, but it is not a deeply satisfying or finely-crafted mystery.",4,Lots of action,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,981,"['Given', 'acting', 'prowess', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Philip', 'Glenister', 'thought', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'hands-down', 'winner', 'front', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'five-stars', 'great', 'action', 'abundance', 'Philip', 'Glenister', 'likable', ""'tough-guy"", 'usual', 'aplomb', 'slightly', 'shabby', 'private', 'investigator', 'who', 'embroiled', 'situation', ""n't"", 'understand', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'Kind', 'cliche', 'yes', 'matter', 'own', 'life', 'danger', 'whom', 'more', 'point', 'why', 'How', 'own', 'past', 'have', 'bearing', 'case', 'Having', 'sat', 'episodes', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'extent', 'still', 'am', 'unsure', 'plot', 'details', 'action', 'obscure', 'limitations', 'plot', 'line', 'viewer', 'swiftness', 'wake', 'entertaining', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'finely-crafted', 'mystery']",Hidden

1616169,A1TPW86OHXTXFC,B00AQYUY5Q,"prisrob ""pris,""","[10, 11]","'Hidden' is a TV series that aired on BBCOne in 2011. It made it's way to the states, and now we are in possession of the mystery.The series has at it's base a lawyer or soliciter, Harry Venn, played by Philip Glenister, who starts looking for a man from his past, at the request of a beautiful soliciter, Gina Hawkes , played by Thekla Reuten.  Hawkes is searching for a missing alibi witness for her client. Philip finds that he is now going back 20 years to a crime committed by his brother, Mark. Mark died in that crime, and Harry has been looked at as the driver in the get away car. Harry is not without sin, as he was in prison as a teen, he has a son who is a teen, and he has not been a good father. Harry seems to have many women and several exes. He has had success as a small town soliciter in the big murky city of London. Harry has the unshaved and unkempt look that is so popular. He has several colleagues, all hoods of some sort or another, but are good at cracking codes in computers and getting info that is needed.Into this mess, we find David Suchet who plays Sir Nigel Fountain, a judge who seems to be politically motivated. He is the caretaker to Gina Hawkes, who went to live with him after her parents were killed. This quickly becomes a political thriller with murders amongst the daily activities. We are not sure what is going on as the tension increases, Harry and Gina start working together, but all remains murky and mysterious.This thriller could have been so much more mysterious if it did not keep going back to the flashback of Harry, his brother killing two policemen and the drive away. This series has four episodes and there were at least five of these flashbacks, all the same per episode. Very tiring and seems to be a filler. The series was well acted and for the most part well written.  I just wish I knew what was going on. If this is not renewed, we may never know.Recommended. prisrob 11-1--13",4,What Really Went On,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,1943,"['TV', 'series', 'aired', 'BBCOne', '2011', 'made', 'way', 'states', 'now', 'are', 'possession', 'mystery.The', 'series', 'base', 'lawyer', 'soliciter', 'Harry', 'Venn', 'played', 'Philip', 'Glenister', 'who', 'looking', 'man', 'past', 'request', 'beautiful', 'soliciter', 'Gina', 'Hawkes', 'played', 'Thekla', 'Reuten', 'Hawkes', 'searching', 'missing', 'alibi', 'witness', 'client', 'Philip', 'now', 'going', 'back', '20', 'years', 'crime', 'committed', 'brother', 'Mark', 'Mark', 'died', 'crime', 'Harry', 'been', 'looked', 'driver', 'get', 'away', 'car', 'Harry', 'not', 'sin', 'was', 'prison', 'teen', 'son', 'who', 'teen', 'not', 'been', 'good', 'father', 'Harry', 'have', 'many', 'women', 'several', 'exes', 'had', 'success', 'small', 'town', 'soliciter', 'big', 'murky', 'city', 'London', 'Harry', 'unshaved', 'unkempt', 'look', 'so', 'popular', 'several', 'colleagues', 'hoods', 'sort', 'are', 'good', 'cracking', 'codes', 'computers', 'getting', 'info', 'mess', 'find', 'David', 'Suchet', 'who', 'Sir', 'Nigel', 'Fountain', 'judge', 'who', 'be', 'politically', 'motivated', 'caretaker', 'Gina', 'Hawkes', 'who', 'went', 'live', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'quickly', 'political', 'thriller', 'murders', 'amongst', 'daily', 'activities', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'tension', 'increases', 'Harry', 'Gina', 'start', 'working', 'together', 'murky', 'mysterious.This', 'thriller', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'mysterious', 'did', 'not', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'flashback', 'Harry', 'brother', 'killing', 'two', 'policemen', 'drive', 'away', 'series', 'four', 'episodes', 'were', 'least', 'five', 'flashbacks', 'same', 'episode', 'Very', 'tiring', 'be', 'filler', 'series', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'written', 'just', 'wish', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'not', 'renewed', 'may', 'never', 'know.Recommended', 'prisrob', '11-1', '13']",Hidden
