725101,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B000078UJV,A Customer,"[1, 1]","Summary:The movie opens with a bunch of scenes introducing the main characters and their powers.  Magneto/Erik Magnus Lehnsherr (Ian McKellen) is separated from his parents during World War II.  Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is trying to convince the U.S. congress not to force mutants to be registered so they can be monitored.The movie actually begins when Rogue (Anna Paquin) kisses her first boyfriend and nearly kills him by taking his life force.  She then runs away and ends up in Alaska where she meets Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman).  Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) attempts to abduct them but they are saved by Cyclops/Scott Summers (James Marsden) and Storm/Ororo Munroe (Halle Berry).  We are then introduced to the X-Men and their school at Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart).  The rest of the movie is the X-Men pitted in a battle against Magneto and his henchmen to save the world from Magneto's plan to make the 'normal' humans into mutants.My Comments:As I said at the beginning, I have always loved superheroes (mutants or not) and for that reason I really enjoyed the movie.  Of course, there are some plot holes - why was Rogue headed to Alaska; how did Mystique get into the school; how did the senator get abducted; etc. - but they are not so significant that they detract from the movie.  Understandably, I guess, special effects involving the mutants powers are expensive and not easy to pull off, which explains why there are so few and so little confrontation between the mutants.  Especially lacking in exhibitions of their powers were Storm and Jean Grey, likely the most difficult powers to replicate in a movie.Overall, the movie was very entertaining and definitely left room for a sequel - a sequel that I will be waiting for.  Not perfect, but fun.",4,I have always loved superheroes.,1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,1784,"['Summary', 'movie', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'introducing', 'main', 'characters', 'powers', 'Magneto/Erik', 'Magnus', 'Lehnsherr', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'separated', 'parents', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Dr.', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'trying', 'convince', 'U.S.', 'congress', 'not', 'force', 'mutants', 'be', 'registered', 'can', 'be', 'monitored.The', 'movie', 'actually', 'when', 'Rogue', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'nearly', 'kills', 'taking', 'life', 'force', 'then', 'away', 'up', 'Alaska', 'where', 'Wolverine/Logan', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Sabretooth', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'abduct', 'are', 'saved', 'Cyclops/Scott', 'Summers', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Storm/Ororo', 'Munroe', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'are', 'then', 'introduced', 'X-Men', 'school', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'rest', 'movie', 'X-Men', 'pitted', 'battle', 'Magneto', 'henchmen', 'save', 'world', 'Magneto', 'plan', 'make', ""'normal"", 'humans', 'mutants.My', 'Comments', 'said', 'beginning', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'superheroes', 'mutants', 'not', 'reason', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'course', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'why', 'was', 'Rogue', 'headed', 'Alaska', 'how', 'did', 'Mystique', 'get', 'school', 'how', 'did', 'senator', 'get', 'abducted', 'etc', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'significant', 'detract', 'movie', 'Understandably', 'guess', 'special', 'effects', 'involving', 'mutants', 'powers', 'are', 'expensive', 'not', 'easy', 'pull', 'off', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'so', 'little', 'confrontation', 'mutants', 'Especially', 'lacking', 'exhibitions', 'powers', 'were', 'Storm', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'likely', 'most', 'difficult', 'powers', 'replicate', 'movie.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'left', 'room', 'sequel', 'sequel', 'will', 'be', 'waiting', 'Not', 'perfect', 'fun']",N/A

725103,A2S166WSCFIFP5,B000078UJV,"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com""","[101, 115]","First I have to say I love X-Men the movie, and this is a great dvd. But I cannot give it the five stars I would like to (or that I gave the first X-Men dvd) because I feel that they have cheated the fans. Much like the comic books themselves, they've devised a way to take more money from the fans. Why wasn't all these extras on the original dvd? Even Bryan Singer himself says in the introduction to the dvd that he hates to do it, and that he hopes a group of people are sitting around watching the 1 dvd they bought (then why did you do it Bryan? whay didn't you just put all this good stuff on the original dvd?)First of all, the menus aren't as cool as the original dvd. Sort of cheesy in fact. Now, both the original and 1.5 come in slipcover cases, but the original has a nice design, with a metallic type sheen to it--very x-meny. 1.5 has much less of the sheen, horrid red letters, and instead of a small tasteful cover art, a large picture of Wolverine, flanked by Mystique and Storm. It looks all right, if you haven't seen the original slip case design. And inside is almost good. it has a nice red and black design (not the vulgar read of the outer cover, but a more tasteful and subdued red), and only loses it when you see a cast lineup. From a design perspective, 1.5 is definitely weaker.Disc OneThe X-Men movie is on this disc. I won't go into a review of the movie, because I already did that in my review of X-Men. I will say that it is a great movie, Singer does a great job, and the casting is inspired. There is a commentary track on this dvd, something that was missng from the original. Singer does a great job talking about the film and the filmmaking process. I just have to ask, why wasn't this on the original dvd? There is also an Enhanced Viewing Mode on this cd. It contains extended/deleted scenes, where they would have been placed in the film (also on the original dvd). The problem is that you can't go to them seperately, you can only access them in their place in the Enhanced Viewing Mode (a definite weakness, and not a problem on the original dvd). The Enhanced Viewing Mode also has 17 different behind the scenes footage, at various locations in the film (these you also can only access through this mode and not in a seperate menu. a minus).Disc TwoHere is where Singer's introduction and apology is located. ""It's not my nature to be putting out multiple dvds of a film"" --then why Bryan, why did you do it? But the orchestra is nice (you'll see what I mean). There are two menus here. One is X-Men 2, which has a Daredevil teaser (there's a movie I won't go see) and has an X-Men 2 sneak preview (I understand why this isn't on the original dvd, and it is a great addition, but not worth buying a whole new dvd). The other menu is titled Evolution X. Under it you'll find all sorts of goodies, which can all be played in sequence, or accessed one at a time (which I recommend), and there is branching her as well, but I'm not sure if you have to go at it all together or not, but I suspect you can only get it if you choose the 'Play All With Branching' option, which really isn't such a bad way to go. There's a 'Production Documentary Scrapbook' where you can watch the train sequence from all different camera angles, and without the post-production and multi-angle fight rehearsals. 'X-Factor' which contains costume tests, toad's makeup test, and an image gallery. 'The Uncanny Suspects' (my that's witty) which has a character gallery and Hugh Jackman's first reading and screen test. 'Special Effects of the X-Men' contains all sorts of effects featurettes and extras. 'Marketing the X-Men' which has trailers, tv spots, and internet spots. And finally 'Reflection of the X-Men"" which has footage from the Ellis Island Premier and premier's around the world. And don't forget all the xtras found in the branching option. Overall you do get a lot of good stuff that you won't find on the original dvd. But what you will find on the original dvd that you won't find on 1.5 is the easter egg Spider-Man gag, which is great (but you will get something similar where a Wolverine appears in the original yellow costume), nor will you find the Fox Special ""The Mutant Watch"", which isn't esential to the film (actually, it doesn't fit great continuity-wise), but it is entertaining, and should be on the 1.5.Now, should you buy X-Men 1.5? I did, but that's because I'm a huge fan of the X-Men (in film, cartoon, comics, toys, and fiction), and the huge X-Fans will end up doing this. Also, I'm a student of film theory and criticism, and this dvd has things I couldn't pass up. But if you have the original dvd, then I'd either rent 1.5 or borrow it from a friend. If you don't have either, I'd say go ahead and pick up 1.5 (borrow the original dvd from a friend, you've got to see the Spider-Man gag). 1.5 does give you the better value, it's just that this stuff should have been on the original dvd.

I heard that iw as plagued with production problems and had the release date moved up a few months.  but with the previews and some of the actors involved, I couldn't resist.I wasn't dissapointed.Patrick Stewart was great as professor X, he took the character seriously and made him believable as the benevolent leader of the X-men.  Ian McKellan was wonderful as the anti-hero Magneto.  Making him no a butcher or a raving lunatic, but an idealist that wasn't afraid to spill some blood in order to achieve his goals.  As well as the psychopathic Wolverine, whom Hugh Jackman makes himself look almost born to play.  He looks as though he has depth, but is still abrasive and looks like he loves beating the hell out of people.The FX were impressive, but didn't take away from the movie like Spawn.  A good example was when Magneto was tossing cars around in front of the bus station.  They also didn't go too far into the technobabble trying to explain everything that was going on.The X-men were very similar to their comic counterparts, but modernized for a 2000 feel.  But didn't delve into the Scream like self awareness.  They did a good job to show the double edged blad of how it could be like if you had super powers, being feared and outright hated.  It was also fairly well paced, a bit short, but felt like a complete movie with no dead areas.In short one of the best comic book movies out there, and an impressive show by cast and crew.",4,great,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,1501,"['was', 'hesitant', 'when', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'heard', 'iw', 'plagued', 'production', 'problems', 'had', 'release', 'date', 'moved', 'up', 'few', 'months', 'previews', 'actors', 'involved', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'dissapointed.Patrick', 'Stewart', 'was', 'great', 'professor', 'X', 'took', 'character', 'seriously', 'made', 'believable', 'benevolent', 'leader', 'X-men', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'was', 'wonderful', 'anti-hero', 'Magneto', 'Making', 'butcher', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'idealist', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'spill', 'blood', 'order', 'achieve', 'goals', 'As', 'well', 'psychopathic', 'Wolverine', 'whom', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'look', 'almost', 'born', 'play', 'depth', 'still', 'abrasive', 'beating', 'hell', 'people.The', 'FX', 'were', 'impressive', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'movie', 'Spawn', 'good', 'example', 'was', 'when', 'Magneto', 'was', 'tossing', 'cars', 'front', 'bus', 'station', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'technobabble', 'trying', 'explain', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'on.The', 'X-men', 'were', 'very', 'similar', 'comic', 'counterparts', 'modernized', '2000', 'feel', 'did', ""n't"", 'delve', 'Scream', 'self', 'awareness', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'show', 'double', 'edged', 'blad', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'had', 'super', 'powers', 'being', 'feared', 'outright', 'hated', 'was', 'also', 'fairly', 'well', 'paced', 'bit', 'short', 'felt', 'complete', 'movie', 'dead', 'areas.In', 'short', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'there', 'impressive', 'show', 'cast', 'crew']",N/A

Where are these characters that are being developed?  The whole movie practically revolves around Wolverine.  Wolverine wasn't even one of the original X-Men yet he gets more screen time than all the original X-Men put together, some of whom aren't even in the movie (Angel, Beast)Not only does this movie ignore the other X-Men's origins,  it doesn't even follow the original plot.  Yes, most movie adaptations tend to make a few plot adjustments here and there but this movie is what the X-Men would look like if you took the entire comic collection, shredded them into microscopic pieces, and then scotch taped the pieces together at random.The casting is also horrible, Halle Berry plays the worst Storm possible.  She seems to be stuck in the cast based on name recognition alone.  James Marsden makes Cyclops seems lifeless,  which I'm not sure I can blame due to the amount of screen time he gets.  Hugh Jackman, the tallest cast member, ironically stars as Wolverine.  The comic book character is named Wolverine because he is short and ferocious like the animal.  For those of you who watch WWE, this is the same reason why Chris Benoit is nicked &quot;The Rabid Wolverine&quot;.During the special features when the cast each explain their character's powers, the guy who plays Sabretooth says something along the lines of &quot;Durr, Sabretooth is really strong&quot;. Obviously, there wasn't much homework done before this movie went into production.  No homework from this poor sap who landed the monotonous role of Sabretooth, none from whoever did the casting, none from even Singer himself.

Foregoing the somewhat cheesy yellow and blue spandex, the movie takes on leather and moves the X-Men into the next generation.  The movie is an excellent adaptation, with superb choices for the characters (Hugh Jackman was born to play Logan).  It carries it's story very well and keeps a very comic book feel to it without going into the utter circus that was Batman and Robin or Batman Forever.  With X2 being released in three months, this is an excellent way of celebrating.  Since the first DVD was rather lackluster (no DTS, no commentary, only one featurette), this is the DVD fans have been waiting for.  If you're merely a casual fan of the movie and already own the first movie, then there's no need to buy this one.  Although, if you love the movie, then definitely purchase this.  It contains an excellent Bryan Singer commentary, several featurettes, and a couple of much appreciated extras- a Daredevil trailer and an X2 preview featurette along with a trailer for it as well.  It also has a DTS track for sound buffs.  The introduction to the movie was slightly altered.  With all these new features, X-Men still keeps the old, so there's no need to buy both DVDs.  With this DVD you get all the deleted scenes on the first release and the other extras from the disc as well.  Don't miss this excellent 2-Disc set.

725114,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000078UJV,Cubist,"[3, 3]","X-Men is one of those rare examples of a comic book that Hollywood *didn't* screw up royally (see League of Extraordinary Gentlemen -- ugh!). In fact, they did the comic book series justice by not trying to do a faithful adaptation (which would have been impossible considering the countless variations that the characters have gone through over the years) but instead maintained the essence of what makes the X-Men work so well.The filmmakers also, wisely, centered the film around the most popular character, Wolverine. I remember when the casting choices for this movie were leaked out and the uproar caused by the casting of then-unknown Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Who was this guy? He doesn't even look like the character, etc. However, all fears were swept aside once the film opened and Jackman made his first appearance on-screen in what has to be one of *the* coolest introductions to a character in a comic book movie. Jackman commands the screen and owns the role -- he *is* Wolverine. He captures the character's ferociousness and his stand-offish attitude to those around him (his exchanges with Cyclops are priceless). Jackman would go on to improve on the character with X2 but it is interesting to go back and watch the first movie and see a star in the making.This 2-DVD set is a vast improvement over the rushed single-disc version. This one has it all: commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes, featurettes, etc. Hours and hours of extras but the best of the bunch has to be the detailed Making-Of documentary by the folks who worked on the awesome The Usual Suspects special edition DVD. I've read that they wanted to include more of the friction between director Bryan Singer and the studio but, of course, that stuff was nixed by the powers that be. Still, what you have on the DVD is a fascinating look at the sheer amount of work and drive it takes to make one of these big budget blockbusters.This is the blueprint for how you do a comic book film adaptation the right way.",5,The movie that made Hugh Jackman a star...,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,2001,"['X-Men', 'one', 'rare', 'examples', 'comic', 'book', 'Hollywood', ""*didn't*"", 'screw', 'up', 'royally', 'see', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'fact', 'did', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'justice', 'not', 'trying', 'do', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'considering', 'countless', 'variations', 'characters', 'have', 'gone', 'years', 'instead', 'maintained', 'essence', 'what', 'X-Men', 'work', 'so', 'well.The', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'wisely', 'centered', 'film', 'most', 'popular', 'character', 'Wolverine', 'remember', 'when', 'casting', 'choices', 'movie', 'were', 'leaked', 'out', 'uproar', 'caused', 'casting', 'then-unknown', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'Who', 'was', 'guy', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'character', 'etc', 'However', 'fears', 'were', 'swept', 'aside', 'film', 'opened', 'Jackman', 'made', 'first', 'appearance', 'on-screen', 'what', 'be', 'one', '*the*', 'coolest', 'introductions', 'character', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'Jackman', 'screen', 'role', 'Wolverine', 'character', 'ferociousness', 'stand-offish', 'attitude', 'exchanges', 'Cyclops', 'are', 'priceless', 'Jackman', 'would', 'go', 'improve', 'character', 'X2', 'interesting', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'first', 'movie', 'see', 'star', 'making.This', '2-DVD', 'set', 'vast', 'improvement', 'rushed', 'single-disc', 'version', 'one', 'commentaries', 'documentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'etc', 'Hours', 'hours', 'extras', 'best', 'bunch', 'be', 'detailed', 'Making-Of', 'documentary', 'folks', 'who', 'worked', 'awesome', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'read', 'wanted', 'include', 'more', 'friction', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'studio', 'course', 'stuff', 'was', 'nixed', 'powers', 'be', 'Still', 'what', 'have', 'DVD', 'fascinating', 'look', 'sheer', 'amount', 'work', 'drive', 'make', 'one', 'big', 'budget', 'blockbusters.This', 'blueprint', 'how', 'do', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'adaptation', 'right', 'way']",N/A
725115,A3A7CBLO6JGY4F,B000078UJV,"Daniel Garris ""YoSoyTylerDurden""","[2, 4]","Have yourself interesting characters and you have yourself an interesting film. It almost always works no matter the type of film at hand. Bryan Singer's X-Men is no exception to this rule as at the end of the day it is the characters themselves that make X-Men work. The film, which is based on the long-running comic book of the same name, stars Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, a mutant with unmatched telepathic abilities and the leader of a small group of fellow mutants known as the X-Men. After some very impressive introductions to a few of the film's main characters two of Xavier's X-Men are sent out to find the mutants known as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) before they can be captured by Magneto (Ian McKellen), another fellow mutant who is no longer willing to take the treatment of humans towards mutants (think of the Red Scare in the 1950s).Cyclops (James Marsden) and Storm (Halle Berry) are successful in their mission and in turn Wolverine and Rogue are brought back to Xaiver's school for gifted mutants. The two get introduced to the setting, and although they have their doubts about it (especially Wolverine), they both decide to give it a try with neither having any place else to turn. It is in the two new additions to the team that the film really shines. Both Jackman and Paquin give wonderful performances and really do steal the show, especially in their scenes together. They not only have the characters down pact to their comic book counterparts, but more importantly bring a level of humanness to the film when together, a trait which just hasn't been seen in recent comic book adaptations nor for that matter most action films as of late. They may be super-heroes but at the same time are still human enough that we can sympathize with the feelings of both. It is this that really sets apart X-Men from past comic book adaptations such as Superman, Batman and to some extent even Blade and Spawn. Whereas those super-heroes were put on platforms above society by the society they protected, the X-Men aren't appreciated for their services as most of the society protected by them are unaware of their existence, and the few who do know of it, only hate them out of fear. They may have superhuman strengths, but because their society doesn't see them as heroes, we are better able to identify with them as humans. This can even be said about the film's main villain (thanks in some part to the film's opening scene), Magneto, as in addition to understanding the reasons for his cause, we are also challenged as to whether or not we agree with those reasons.The film isn't perfect as it does have a few subtle problems. The most obvious is the underdevelopment of the other three X-Men: Storm, Cyclops, and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). While we get a decent look into Jean Grey and Cyclops through their very different relationships with Wolverine, the film fails to play on the relationship between the two despite their being romantically evolved. Storm is almost a non-factor in the film in terms of the plot, which was likely due to some last minute cutting of the film. Also coming into play in this area is the film's final showdown. It starts out impressively between the X-Men and Magneto's brotherhood of mutants, but fails to hit a high when it comes down to just the X-Men and Magneto. The score is also pretty weak when considering the classic themes that have accompanied both the Superman and Batman films and the techno score that accompanied Blade. But again, neither of these problems is earth shattering in light of the entire film.Other than that the film accomplishes everything else that could be expected from it. Both the special effects and action sequences are impressive, but at the same time never take over the story as they are instead molded to fit into just what the story requires at a given time. Nothing more, nothing less. The same can also be said about the supporting villains, Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), Toad (Ray Park), and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). Neither of the three are given the chance to take over the film, a la the Batman franchise, but all three move the plot along and are impressive to watch as well. Even the catch phrases and humor are kept to a minimal, and because of that they too carry a much more realistic feeling to them.In the end X-Men is different because it is about the imagined set in the real world, rather than the imagined set in an imagined world. By approaching nearly everything outside of the characters in a realistic manner and by presenting the characters as more human than supernatural the film is both easy to believe in and even easier to identify with. While it doesn't make X-Men the best film of the summer, it does make it one of the better films of the summer, and more importantly, one of the better films to have ever come out of the super-hero genre as it will please both fans and non-fans of the comic book. With the film also playing primarily as an introduction to the series things are bound to only get better.*** 1/2 (8.5/10)",4,An X-cellent Start to the Franchise,1108598400,"02 17,

So I'm giving this five-star movie one star because it's two years too late!Studios should only be allowed to release a film on DVD once...that way, they'll get it right the first time!  Fox dropped the ball when they came out with the first DVD by including very few extras, and now they're trying to make up for it by releasing a version that includes all of stuff the first disc lacked!This disturbing rerelease trend is happening with increased regularity (SEE ALSO: The Mummy Ultimate Edition, Lord of the Rings) as the DVD phenomenon continues to explode.  Now, I can understand a rerelease for a movie that originally came out a long time ago when deleted scenes and similar extras were relatively rare...but, c'mon, X-Men is a recent movie!So the fans are ... yet again...while Fox laughs all the way to the bank!",1,Two years ago this DVD would have gotten 5 stars!,1044835200,"02 10, 2003",2003,1353,"['fact', 'DVD', 'even', 'testament', 'extent', 'movie', 'studios', 'will', 'go', 'make', 'extra', 'profit', 'X-Men', '1.5', 'THE', 'EXACT', 'SAME', 'MOVIE', 'was', 'released', 'original', 'X-Men', 'DVD', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'great', 'film', 'way', 'difference', 'attempt', 'additional', 'coin', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'included', 'version', 'additional', 'bells', 'whistles', 'such', 'director', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'not', 'included', 'including', 'sneak', 'peek', 'sequel', ""'m"", 'giving', 'five-star', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'two', 'years', 'too', 'late', 'Studios', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'allowed', 'release', 'film', 'DVD', 'once', 'way', ""'ll"", 'get', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'Fox', 'dropped', 'ball', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'DVD', 'including', 'very', 'few', 'extras', 'now', ""'re"", 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'releasing', 'version', 'stuff', 'first', 'disc', 'lacked', 'disturbing', 'rerelease', 'trend', 'happening', 'increased', 'regularity', 'SEE', 'ALSO', 'Mummy', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'DVD', 'phenomenon', 'explode', 'Now', 'can', 'understand', 'rerelease', 'movie', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'when', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'similar', 'extras', 'were', 'relatively', 'rare', ""c'mon"", 'X-Men', 'recent', 'movie', 'fans', 'are', 'yet', 'again', 'Fox', 'way', 'bank']",N/A
725117,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B000078UJV,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[2, 4]","""X-Men"" takes place in the not-so-distant future when random genetic mutations have created a sub-race of human species with special powers.  Not surprisingly, the non-mutated population fears the power and motives of this largely hidden subculture, and Congress is divided about the laws it needs to enact in a not-so-subtle allusion to the McCarthy Era hearings.  Two powerful mutants and former friends, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) face this threat in opposing manners.  Xavier runs a  secret school to nurture young mutants and their talents, to give them a place to fit in, while Magneto seeks to jumpstart the evolutionary process in an attempt to mutate all humans.  Xavier's X-Men - Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry), Dr. Grey (Famke Janssen), and newly outed Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) - set out to stop Magneto and rescue perhaps one of the most powerful newcomers to the school, Rogue (Anna Paquin), who has the mutant ability to temporarily absorb the life force of others.The comic book and therefore the film asks the viewer to swallow much disbelief.  If you can ignore the plot holes (such as why each mutant has an individualized superhuman power), then this film is lots of fun.  The special effects are good, and the action is high-intensity.  The chemistry between Stewart and McKellan is compelling, as it is between Jackman and Paquin.  Marsden and Jackman share some humorous exchanges, but Marsden does not bring enough to his role, though the thin script is partly to blame.  Much of the story focuses on Wolverine and, to a lesser extent, on Rogue instead of on the other characters.  Watch this film in surround sound for maximum effect.While all the elements of this film should make it a five-star action movie, director Bryan Singer fails to give it heart.  Sometimes it seems as though the film is going through the motions of trying to thrill the audience without making sure we are emotionally invested in its outcome.  Issues of prejudice, persecution, and responsibility run underneath the action, a welcome addition.  Really, though, this film is about fighting the bad guys, and it's here where it succeeds most.",4,The first battle of the mutants,1092528000,"08 15, 2004",2004,2190,"['X-Men', 'place', 'not-so-distant', 'future', 'when', 'random', 'genetic', 'mutations', 'have', 'created', 'sub-race', 'human', 'species', 'special', 'powers', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'non-mutated', 'population', 'power', 'motives', 'largely', 'hidden', 'subculture', 'Congress', 'divided', 'laws', 'enact', 'not-so-subtle', 'allusion', 'McCarthy', 'Era', 'hearings', 'Two', 'powerful', 'mutants', 'former', 'friends', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Magneto', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'face', 'threat', 'opposing', 'manners', 'Xavier', 'secret', 'school', 'nurture', 'young', 'mutants', 'talents', 'give', 'place', 'fit', 'Magneto', 'jumpstart', 'evolutionary', 'process', 'attempt', 'mutate', 'humans', 'Xavier', 'X-Men', 'Cyclops', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Storm', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Dr.', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'newly', 'outed', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'set', 'out', 'stop', 'Magneto', 'rescue', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'newcomers', 'school', 'Rogue', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'mutant', 'ability', 'temporarily', 'absorb', 'life', 'force', 'others.The', 'comic', 'book', 'therefore', 'film', 'viewer', 'swallow', 'much', 'disbelief', 'can', 'ignore', 'plot', 'holes', 'such', 'why', 'mutant', 'individualized', 'superhuman', 'power', 'then', 'film', 'lots', 'fun', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'action', 'high-intensity', 'chemistry', 'Stewart', 'McKellan', 'compelling', 'Jackman', 'Paquin', 'Marsden', 'Jackman', 'share', 'humorous', 'exchanges', 'Marsden', 'not', 'bring', 'enough', 'role', 'thin', 'script', 'partly', 'blame', 'Much', 'story', 'Wolverine', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Rogue', 'instead', 'other', 'characters', 'Watch', 'film', 'surround', 'sound', 'maximum', 'effect.While', 'elements', 'film', 'should', 'make', 'five-star', 'action', 'movie', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'give', 'heart', 'film', 'going', 'motions', 'trying', 'thrill', 'audience', 'making', 'sure', 'are', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'outcome', 'Issues', 'prejudice', 'persecution', 'responsibility', 'run', 'action', 'welcome', 'addition', 'Really', 'though', 'film', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guys', 'here', 'where', 'most']",N/A

Director Bryan Singer gave this comic book adventure a very serious and believable tone which was complemented by the special effects designed to further the story rather than to give us headaches. This comic-book-derived epic literally appeals to people of all ages and backgrounds. It speaks to the sense of estrangement within us all, that part that wishes for a place where acceptance and caring can be found and depended on. In this case that place is exemplified by the ""Xavier School for Gifted Children"". On this basis, the film touches a broad audience and the resultant enthusiasm is no fluke.ABOUT THE DVD:SPECIFIC FEATURES OF PURCHASING X-MEN 1.5 - If you already have this on DVD you need not go to the extra expense of adding this edition to your collection. However, if you have it on video only, the difference in picture and sound quality is striking and worth the purchase price to have this movie on DVD. The specific features that require this separate release are basically very interesting fillers, but it does have interviews with most of the principal cast and Stan Lee. Historical material put into featurettes and thematically organized is of some value if you are really interested or were a fan in the 1960s or 70s [like me] and need a refresher course on the X-Men without re-reading the comics.Probably my favorite DVD feature on the 1.5 version is the ""Enhanced Viewing Mode"", which provides a seamless and convenient way to see the deleted or edited scenes as well as 17 featurettes without stopping the film and at a relevant point in the movie. Of course if you don't want to be distracted from the normal playing of the film you need not engage this feature or you can choose which detours you wish to take. This is very nicely done. It can, however, be distracting if it is your first viewing.BOTTOM LINE:All-in-all I am very impressed with the quality of this DVD and its features. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the genre as this movie is the best of its class.",5,BEST EDITION OF THE FIRST X-MEN EPIC IS LOADED WITH SPECIAL FEATURES,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,2228,"['IN', 'A', 'NUTSHELL', 'EDITION', 'YOU', 'WANT', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'GOTTEN', 'IT', 'YETI', 'bought', 'DVD', 'teenage', 'children', 'found', 'caught', 'up', 'were', 'very', 'tight', 'character-driven', 'action', 'thriller', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'gave', 'comic', 'book', 'adventure', 'very', 'serious', 'believable', 'tone', 'was', 'complemented', 'special', 'effects', 'designed', 'further', 'story', 'rather', 'give', 'headaches', 'comic-book-derived', 'epic', 'literally', 'appeals', 'people', 'ages', 'backgrounds', 'sense', 'estrangement', 'part', 'place', 'where', 'acceptance', 'caring', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'depended', 'case', 'place', 'exemplified', 'Xavier', 'School', 'Gifted', 'Children', 'basis', 'film', 'broad', 'audience', 'resultant', 'enthusiasm', 'fluke.ABOUT', 'THE', 'DVD', 'SPECIFIC', 'FEATURES', 'OF', 'PURCHASING', 'X-MEN', '1.5', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'need', 'not', 'go', 'extra', 'expense', 'adding', 'edition', 'collection', 'However', 'have', 'video', 'only', 'difference', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'striking', 'purchase', 'price', 'have', 'movie', 'DVD', 'specific', 'features', 'require', 'separate', 'release', 'are', 'basically', 'very', 'interesting', 'fillers', 'have', 'interviews', 'most', 'principal', 'cast', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Historical', 'material', 'put', 'featurettes', 'thematically', 'organized', 'value', 'are', 'really', 'interested', 'were', 'fan', '1960s', '70s', '[', ']', 'need', 'refresher', 'course', 'X-Men', 're-reading', 'comics.Probably', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'feature', '1.5', 'version', 'Enhanced', 'Viewing', 'Mode', 'seamless', 'convenient', 'way', 'see', 'deleted', 'edited', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', '17', 'featurettes', 'stopping', 'film', 'relevant', 'point', 'movie', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'distracted', 'normal', 'playing', 'film', 'need', 'not', 'engage', 'feature', 'can', 'choose', 'detours', 'wish', 'take', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'can', 'however', 'be', 'distracting', 'first', 'viewing.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'All-in-all', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'quality', 'DVD', 'features', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'genre', 'movie', 'best', 'class']",N/A
725120,A9CKMSQ6ZEWLB,B000078UJV,D. Rodgers,"[5, 7]","When I look back at the summer of 2000 there's really only two films that come to mind; Ridley Scott's Gladiator (which I loved), and Bryan Singer's X-Men. Which in my opinion, was the best comic book movie adaptation (at least at that time), even beating out Batman for the top spot. X-Men seemed to deliver just the right amount of big-scale action, humor and sci-fi imaginings that made the film accessible to anyone, whether they were die-hard comic book fans, or not. And at that particular time, I was not, but now I am a huge comic book fan.When I was really young (around four or five) I used to be into Superman and Batman, so I was more of the D.C. Comics type of kid. I watched those old 40's Max & Dave Fleischer Superman cartoons, the George Reeves 50's black and white Superman TV show, and of course the Christopher Reeves films, and both the Batman and Superman animated TV series of the early-mid 90's (which I still love), heck I even watched the 60's Batman TV show with Adam West (remember back before he was the Mayor of Quahog?). I didn't really get into Batman until Tim Burton came out with his film in '89. But despite all of these things I still wasn't a ""comic book kid"". I never went out and bought, or read comic books, but it wasn't until I saw Bryan Singer's X-Men, and to a greater extent Sam Raimi's Spider-Man that I became a real comic book fan. So for me X-Men is kind of a turning point in my interest with comic books and superheroes.X-Men has a number of things working for it. First off, the film is under a hundred minutes, and is very quick paced; never slow, or dull. Second, the casting is, well... excellent. Hugh Jackman is spot-on perfect for the character of Wolverine, who was always my favorite X-Men even before I saw the film. He's a tough character whose rough around the edges, but with a tender heart, but don't mess with him, because he'll tear you a new one, literally! Then there's Professor X (for Xavier), played by none other than Patrick Stewart. Honestly though, could you even image for a second for anyone else in this role? Because I certainly know I couldn't. Then there's ""the bad guy""; Magneto, played by the great Sir Ian McKellan, needless to say he's great as well; a villain evoking both cold-blooded menace and intelligence. Then there's the rest of the cast which includes James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Halle Barry, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn (insert drooling sound here), Tyler Mane and Ray Park. All of them were great, well all except Halle Barry's wig and fake accent, but other than that it's hard to see anything wrong with this cast. And I for one am glad they decided to change the costumes a bit, because Wolverine just wouldn't have looked as kick-ass as he did if he was wearing yellow spandex, like in the comic books, but I thought the X-Men looked great in the black leather costumes.The plot of X-Men, in case you've been living under a rock, or just haven't seen the movie before is about two mutants (Wolverine and Rouge) who are rescued by two X-Men (Storm and Cyclops) and brought to a ""school for the gifted"" run by Professor X. It seems as if they are on the edge of a war between humans and mutants. Magneto has an evil, secret plan to...well, I ain't gonna spoil it for ya, you'll just have to see the movie. But X-Men isn't just a big summer action flick, filled with computer effects, no, X-Men is also well-acted and well-written. Any ""popcorn"" flick can have special effects, but not all of them deliver the solid performances and smart dialogue like X-Men does, and on top of that the film is also dark, stylish, exciting, and at times surprisingly funny. I couldn't have asked for a better comic book movie, and it still holds up after many viewings, many years later. This is excellent summer fun that's not dumbed down, and people of all ages, young and old, and both male and female alike and both fans and non-fans can enjoy.",4,X-Men is X-cellent!,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,3934,"['When', 'look', 'back', 'summer', '2000', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'films', 'come', 'mind', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Gladiator', 'loved', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'X-Men', 'Which', 'opinion', 'was', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'least', 'time', 'even', 'beating', 'out', 'Batman', 'top', 'spot', 'X-Men', 'seemed', 'deliver', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'big-scale', 'action', 'humor', 'sci-fi', 'imaginings', 'made', 'film', 'accessible', 'anyone', 'were', 'die-hard', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'not', 'particular', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'now', 'am', 'huge', 'comic', 'book', 'fan.When', 'was', 'really', 'young', 'four', 'five', 'used', 'be', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'was', 'more', 'D.C.', 'Comics', 'type', 'kid', 'watched', 'old', '40', 'Max', 'Dave', 'Fleischer', 'Superman', 'cartoons', 'George', 'Reeves', '50', 'black', 'white', 'Superman', 'TV', 'show', 'course', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'films', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'early-mid', '90', 'still', 'love', 'heck', 'even', 'watched', '60', 'Batman', 'TV', 'show', 'Adam', 'West', 'remember', 'back', 'was', 'Mayor', 'Quahog', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'Batman', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'came', 'out', 'film', ""'89"", 'things', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'comic', 'book', 'kid', 'never', 'went', 'bought', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'was', ""n't"", 'saw', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'X-Men', 'greater', 'extent', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'became', 'real', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'So', 'X-Men', 'kind', 'turning', 'point', 'interest', 'comic', 'books', 'superheroes.X-Men', 'number', 'things', 'working', 'First', 'film', 'hundred', 'minutes', 'very', 'quick', 'paced', 'never', 'slow', 'dull', 'Second', 'casting', 'well', 'excellent', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'spot-on', 'perfect', 'character', 'Wolverine', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'X-Men', 'even', 'saw', 'film', 'tough', 'character', 'rough', 'edges', 'tender', 'heart', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', ""'ll"", 'tear', 'new', 'one', 'literally', 'Then', 'Professor', 'X', 'Xavier', 'played', 'none', 'other', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Honestly', 'could', 'even', 'image', 'second', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'certainly', 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'Then', 'bad', 'guy', 'Magneto', 'played', 'great', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'needless', 'say', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'villain', 'evoking', 'cold-blooded', 'menace', 'intelligence', 'Then', 'rest', 'cast', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Halle', 'Barry', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'insert', 'drooling', 'sound', 'here', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'Ray', 'Park', 'were', 'great', 'well', 'Halle', 'Barry', 'wig', 'fake', 'accent', 'other', 'hard', 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'cast', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'decided', 'change', 'costumes', 'bit', 'Wolverine', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'looked', 'as', 'kick-ass', 'did', 'was', 'wearing', 'yellow', 'spandex', 'comic', 'books', 'thought', 'X-Men', 'looked', 'great', 'black', 'leather', 'costumes.The', 'plot', 'X-Men', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'about', 'two', 'mutants', 'Wolverine', 'Rouge', 'who', 'are', 'rescued', 'two', 'X-Men', 'Storm', 'Cyclops', 'brought', 'school', 'gifted', 'run', 'Professor', 'X', 'are', 'edge', 'war', 'humans', 'mutants', 'Magneto', 'evil', 'secret', 'plan', 'well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'spoil', 'ya', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'X-Men', ""n't"", 'just', 'big', 'summer', 'action', 'flick', 'filled', 'computer', 'effects', 'X-Men', 'also', 'well-acted', 'well-written', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'can', 'have', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'deliver', 'solid', 'performances', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'X-Men', 'top', 'film', 'also', 'dark', 'stylish', 'exciting', 'times', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'asked', 'better', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'still', 'up', 'many', 'viewings', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'excellent', 'summer', 'fun', 'not', 'dumbed', 'down', 'people', 'ages', 'young', 'old', 'male', 'female', 'alike', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A

The sneak peek of X2 was thrilling, and the featurettes and interviews were very entertaining.  My only complaint has to be that both discs hung up at one point, shutting down the player and necessitating starting all over again (not such a big deal with scene selection on the feature, but the extras disc is not so easily navigated).

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[7, 8]","I bought this DVD for my teenage children but I found myself as caught up as they were with this very tight, character-driven action thriller. Director Bryan Singer gave this comic book adventure a very serious and believable tone which was complemented by the special effects designed to further the story rather than to give us headaches. This comic-book-derived epic literally appeals to people of all ages and backgrounds. It speaks to the sense of estrangement within us all, that part that wishes for a place where acceptance and caring can be found and depended on. In this case that place is exemplified by the ""Xavier School for Gifted Children"". On this basis, the film touches a broad audience and the resultant enthusiasm is no fluke.SPECIFIC FEATURES OF PURCHASING X-MEN 1.5 - If you already have this on DVD you need not go to the extra expense of adding this edition to your collection. However, if you have it on video only, the difference in picture and sound quality is striking and worth the purchase price to have this movie on DVD. The specific features that require this separate release are basically very interesting fillers, but it does have interviews with most of the principal cast and Stan Lee. Historical material put into featurettes and thematically organized is of some value if you are really interested or were a fan in the 1960s or 70s [like me] and need a refresher course on the X-Men without re-reading the comics.Probably my favorite DVD feature on the 1.5 version is the ""Enhanced Viewing Mode"", which provides a seamless and convenient way to see the deleted or edited scenes as well as 17 featurettes without stopping the film and at a relevant point in the movie. Of course if you don't want to be distracted from the normal playing of the film you need not engage this feature or you can choose which detours you wish to take. This is very nicely done. It can, however, be distracting if it is your first viewing.All-in-all I am very impressed with the quality of this DVD and its features.

As Wolverine and Rogue join up with this team of mutants known as the X-Men, who led by Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) believe that humans and mutants can co-exist peacefully, a group of renegade mutants led by Magneto (Ian McKellan), who don't feel the same way towards humans, are attempting to mutate everyone on Earth into mutants so Magneto may lead the world into a mutant utopian society.

Not only do you get a great action/adventure film, you get a lot of extras that you don't normally get with DVDs.  I won't go into a lot of detail on the special features, just know that each featurette is unique in its own way.  I'd rather talk about the film.&quot;X-Men&quot; is a brilliant movie considering that the majority of the cast and the director knew little or nothing about the comic book and its cast of mutants.  Perhaps that is what makes it so good.  &quot;Spiderman&quot; was directed by Sam Raimi, who admitted to loving Spidey.  He presented that film as a comic book on the big screen and pulled it off with near perfection.  Mr. Singer, however, seems to delve more into the complexities of the individual characters in &quot;X-Men.&quot;  This film seems more like a fresh, new idea instead of an homage to the &quot;uncanny&quot; heroes and heroines I enjoyed reading about as a child and teenager.If you know nothing of the &quot;X-Men,&quot; you will not be lost in this film.  Sure, you'll miss a couple of inside jokes that only comic bookies laughed at in the theater, but overall you'll be able to understand the situation and resolution of this movie rather easily.  Hugh Jackman delivered a surprising performance as the hugely popular &quot;Wolverine.&quot;  He probably had the hardest character to portray considering that most &quot;X-Men&quot; fans felt that no one person could do ol' Wolverine justice.  James Marsden gives a subtle delivery as &quot;Cyclops.&quot;  He exuded the leadership qualities you come to expect from that character.  The rest of the cast did a brilliant job.  Sir Ian McKellan was in rare form as &quot;Magneto,&quot; and Patrick Stewart seemed to be born to play &quot;Professor Xavier.&quot;One crucial theme of this movie was that of discrimination.  Consider that these characters were hated and feared because they were mutants.  Then, look at how our society today discriminates against people because of their race, religion, political standing, etc.  Funny how a movie(and the comic book) can seem like child's play to many adults but have such an important message as its primary theme.  Who'da thought that a bunch of comic characters could teach us all a lesson in life.Watch this movie whether you like the comic or not.  It's a good story with a great message.

This is something that Professor Charles Xavier sees and decides to prevent with the help of the X-men Storm, Cyclops, Dr. Jean Grey, and the newly arrived Wolverine.  X-Men is an entertaining event that holds valuable moral lessons within the film, which is based on the comic book with the same name.

There are some terrific action scenes and great characters. Veterans Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) are terrific, as are Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Tyler Mane as Sabertooth. The Special Effects in the film are inventive and amazing. My favourite SFX moment: Where Magneto is walking across a pathway created by moving metallic planks across a chasm, the pinnacle of cool. Brian Singer's take on the classic X Men comic is a fun, action-filled film with great characters and eye-popping SFX. Director Singer (The Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil) has created a film which is inventive and exciting while staying true to the comic's origins.The main star of the film is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, a rouge mutant who joins Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)'s team of mutants including Cyclops, Storm and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who are pitted against metal-moving menace Magneto (Ian McKellen), the head honcho of bad guys with a plan to turn the world's population into mutants.Wolverine is the main guy here, as Jackman proves to be perfect for the role of the hairy guy with some nasty claws. The star power of McKellen and Patrick Stewart gives the film it's gravitas, and the supporting cast of Tyler Mane as the imposing Sabertooth and Ray Park as Toad combine to create a great ensamble cast abbeted with a great script to work with.Seamless CG combined with impressive live-action stunts is awesome, and the film's strong point, action, is well-paced and exciting, with a string of set-pices building up to the huge and amazing finale. The score, by Michael Kamen is a pulse-driven soundtrack that fits the film's style and tone well. Michael Kamen's futuristic score (one of his best) adds to the mysterious tone. There are problems; the film does centre around Wolverine too much, making you want a bit more exposition on the other charcters and their backgrounds, and the film's running time makes the viewer want more, but hey, that's what sequels are for, and the next instalment will no doubt be worth the wait...One of the most eagerly-awaited DVDs does not dissapoint, with plenty of extra 'making of's and on-set footage. The highlight is 'The Evolution', six featurettes played as one long journey from the film's begginings to the release and box office success. Other interesting segments include X-Factor: The Look of the X-Men, Special Effects of the X-Men and reflections of the X-Men. For the film itself, you can watch it in 5 different modes: Theatrical Version, Director's Commentary, and 3 enhanced viewing modes with re-incorperated deleted scenes put back in and 17 Behind the Scenes segments.

Cinematically it is amazing in every aspect.  You don't even have to have been a fan of the comic books, as I am not, to enjoy this silver screen wonder.  Given all the possibilities for this movie to have been done poorly or on the cheesy side, this movie could've flopped all over the box office.  Director Bryan Singer proved with X-Men that it is possible to take a comic series and put it on the silver screen with taste and yet still somewhat true to its original intent!  He and the producers deserve high praise for their efforts and their ability to gather up some very big names to take up the starring roles!  In many ways this film is about oppression, but extends its theme with subtlety.The premise:X-Men the first movie was and is meant only to have been the first of what is hoped to be many of these fine films.  In this, the first movie we're introduced to many of the key players of this and future films.  Director Bryan Singer deftly sets the stage for the conflict between the two warring sides of the mutants as Professor Xavier is profoundly hoping to bring understanding to mutants and non mutants alike.  Magneto on the other hand, having suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime and now watching non mutants lean towards oppressing mutants sets himself on course for conflict between his mutants and the rest of humanity or mutants that get in his way!What follows from there is one of the most explosive and enthralling ""superhero"" films to have ever been made.  The battles between the X-Men are nothing short of stunning, especially the climatic battle between Wolverine and Mystique.  Patrick Stewart ""is"" Professor Xavier, Hugh Jackman is perfect in the role of Wolverine and all the other outstanding actors perform superbly in their respective roles.  A respectful nod to Rebecca Romijn-Stamos for performing so well as Mystique and the lengthy make up process she had to go through in order to bring her character to life!X-Men 1.5 - The DVDTaken as a whole, this particular second DVD release contains what should've been on the first DVD release.

The deleted scenes are more like just rough edits of scenes which eventually changed for the final release.  There is not really a lot of new footage, just lots of different dialogue and different ideas being tried out.  It is fairly cool to see the actors in their own trailers meeting each other and trying on their tight leather costumes, but not worth buying another copy of x-men just for that.  I wish more directors would learn from new line cinema and peter jackson's Lord of the Rings, and release 2 versions of the film.  Theatrical and extended version.  Peter jackson filmed and finished many so-so scenes then decided later whether to keep them or cut them.  In the extended version dvd the scenes are reinserted into the movie making it 30 minutes longer than the theatrical version.  This makes it so much more exciting to watch and really worth the extra money.  WHY Couldn't they do this with x-men.  It isn't like the money hasn't been out for a few years already.  It seems to me like just another way to make money, and not really give the fans anything.

725138,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B000078UJV,"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True""","[3, 14]","I was a big X-men fan as a kid. I was a marverl-head. I was completely obsessed with the X-men cartoon series on Fox in the 90's, which was GREAT. I was sort of intrigued when I heard about this movie coming out, but then I was also a bit aprehensive of the ""curse of the superhero movies"". Let's face it, movies and comics don't aways transition well, and the legacy of comic titles migrating to live action films is a poor one. With the exception of ""The Punisher"" which came out in the 80's most other cmoic book movies were awful. ""The Fantastic Four"" is just one example of just HOW bad it can get. Of course, they didnt have the special effects to realistically portray many superheroes back in the day, but the movies were horrible in terms of dialogue, directing, acting and many other aspects as well. So you can see why I was hesitent to get myself excited when one of my favorite comic titles was being turned into a movie.Just like with superhero video games, the legacy of ... superhero movies continues with ""X-men"". I must say it's gotten a little better now that they have the special effects to accuractley depict cyclops' eye blast, Mystique's shape-shifting or magneto's control of magnetism. And that's really the only good point of the movie, the special effects are good, and it might make for a fun rental or a good party flick. Other than that... this movie just can't get my props... sorry guys.First they changed too much. Rogue isn't supposed to be a young girl, in the comics and the cartoon she is a HOT, fully-grown woman full of southern charm. They also tweaked the character of magneto to be merely a slight similarity to what he really is in the actual series. And what can I say, the list goes on and on.My major complain is the commercialization of the movie and all the hype. The CORNY lines... I mean Storm's line to toad at the end was stupid with a captial S. And why toad??? Who the heck likes toad?? Why not put some cooler bad guys in there. Anyhow, the movie was just all fluff. I mean they dont put any real drama in or any attention to the issues that X-men as a comic and cartoon tried to deal with. Also, Halle Berry might be hot, but she made a really poor performance as storm, and though the acting wasnt that BAD, it wasn't exactly award winning either.Finally, I think we must ask ourselves if we really WANT our comic memories brought into live action... I mean having a bunch of wierdo looking guys in tights, odd costumes and what not running around with horrible lines makes the movie just plain corny and silly. What is up with Cyclops's visor? Im sorry... I just couldnt get with it on this one. over-hyped, and a lac of true quality. Id rather watch the original cartoon. That said it's not a totally horrible movie, it is satisfying to some extent to see the characters and themes we greww to love being brought to us in a new form, but that joy is tempered by the many negative points and the butchery of the real story of X-men.Bottom line: possibly a decent rental, or party movie but not much more. Not something I would run out and buy or be in a rush to see.",2,Cant rate this one high,1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,3125,"['was', 'big', 'X-men', 'fan', 'kid', 'was', 'marverl-head', 'was', 'completely', 'obsessed', 'X-men', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Fox', '90', 'was', 'GREAT', 'was', 'sort', 'intrigued', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'then', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'aprehensive', 'curse', 'superhero', 'movies', 'Let', 'face', 'movies', 'comics', 'do', ""n't"", 'aways', 'transition', 'well', 'legacy', 'comic', 'titles', 'migrating', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'poor', 'one', 'exception', 'Punisher', 'came', 'out', '80', 'most', 'other', 'cmoic', 'book', 'movies', 'were', 'awful', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'just', 'HOW', 'bad', 'can', 'get', 'course', 'didnt', 'have', 'special', 'effects', 'realistically', 'portray', 'many', 'superheroes', 'back', 'day', 'movies', 'were', 'horrible', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'directing', 'acting', 'many', 'other', 'aspects', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'hesitent', 'get', 'excited', 'when', 'one', 'favorite', 'comic', 'titles', 'was', 'being', 'turned', 'movie.Just', 'superhero', 'video', 'games', 'legacy', 'superhero', 'movies', 'X-men', 'must', 'say', 'gotten', 'little', 'better', 'now', 'have', 'special', 'effects', 'accuractley', 'depict', 'cyclops', 'eye', 'blast', 'Mystique', 'shape-shifting', 'magneto', 'control', 'magnetism', 'really', 'only', 'good', 'point', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'might', 'make', 'fun', 'rental', 'good', 'party', 'flick', 'Other', 'movie', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'props', 'sorry', 'guys.First', 'changed', 'too', 'much', 'Rogue', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'young', 'girl', 'comics', 'cartoon', 'HOT', 'fully-grown', 'woman', 'full', 'southern', 'charm', 'also', 'tweaked', 'character', 'magneto', 'be', 'merely', 'slight', 'similarity', 'what', 'really', 'actual', 'series', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'list', 'on.My', 'major', 'complain', 'commercialization', 'movie', 'hype', 'CORNY', 'lines', 'mean', 'Storm', 'line', 'toad', 'end', 'was', 'stupid', 'captial', 'S.', 'why', 'toad', 'Who', 'heck', 'toad', 'Why', 'not', 'put', 'cooler', 'bad', 'guys', 'there', 'Anyhow', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'fluff', 'mean', 'dont', 'put', 'real', 'drama', 'attention', 'issues', 'X-men', 'comic', 'cartoon', 'tried', 'deal', 'Also', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'might', 'be', 'hot', 'made', 'really', 'poor', 'performance', 'storm', 'acting', 'wasnt', 'BAD', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'award', 'winning', 'either.Finally', 'think', 'must', 'ask', 'really', 'WANT', 'comic', 'memories', 'brought', 'live', 'action', 'mean', 'having', 'bunch', 'wierdo', 'looking', 'guys', 'tights', 'odd', 'costumes', 'what', 'not', 'running', 'around', 'horrible', 'lines', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'corny', 'silly', 'What', 'up', 'Cyclops', 'visor', 'Im', 'sorry', 'just', 'couldnt', 'get', 'one', 'over-hyped', 'lac', 'true', 'quality', 'Id', 'rather', 'watch', 'original', 'cartoon', 'said', 'not', 'totally', 'horrible', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'extent', 'see', 'characters', 'themes', 'greww', 'love', 'being', 'brought', 'new', 'form', 'joy', 'tempered', 'many', 'negative', 'points', 'butchery', 'real', 'story', 'X-men.Bottom', 'line', 'possibly', 'decent', 'rental', 'party', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'Not', 'something', 'would', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'be', 'rush', 'see']",N/A

It simply never appealed to me, and the front cover of the DVD, plus the posters, doesn't really do the film justice.  But I thought maybe that I'd give it a go. I was slightly disappointed by the whole film. I was expecting it to be a lot more violent, but there were very few fight scenes. As I've never read the comic books, I didn't know any of the characters, although I was quite surprised to figure out who they were for some strange reason!X-Men starts off really strangely - it starts off in a concentration camp, in Poland, in 1944. None of this seems to relate to the rest of the film, nor does it get picked up on at all. Maybe it will in the sequel, but it seems kind of puzzling to use a scene that doesn't really relate to the rest of the movie. Unless you notice that the little boy at the start uses his ""powers"" to bend the gates back - but then again, it's never really explained who the little boy was. I thought it was Wolverine, but it seems more likely to be Magneto, Patrick Stewart's enemy.I was quite impressed with the cast members in this. The names that always get batted about were Patrick Stewart and Halle Berry. But also featuring was Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin - the latter is a fantastic actress. It was bugging me when she first appeared, as I knew the face, and finally figured out that she starred as Mac in She's All That. I wasn't expecting her to be one of the main characters, as she hasn't had many big starring roles (except in Fly Away Home, but she was only young then), and was quite surprised when she appeared continually throughout. She's not really that big a name I suppose, and hasn't had a great many big roles, but I'm sure her role in this and the sequel will have boosted her name in Hollywood.Another name who will certainly get a big boost in Hollywood is Hugh Jackman. Never heard of him before this, but he's certainly quite nice looking! (Hubba hubba ding-a-ling!) He's previously starred in little-known Australia productions, and he was plucked from obscurity to become the lead actor. He appears topless in a couple of scenes, and although the chest rug didn't do much for me, the rest of him did!Most of the characters didn't really appeal to me, and really, the first film is all about introducing them to the audience, and what their powers are, etc. What I really enjoyed about this movie was the seeming parallel between X-Men and Labyrinth. How did you think I made that connection? Well, if you've seen Labyrinth, then you'll know that the relationship between David Bowie (his tights) and a young Jennifer Connolly seems almost wrong for a child's fairytale movie. If Labyrinth hadn't been directly aimed at children (although I still enjoy it as an adult, particularly the contents of David Bowie's tights!), then maybe they could have developed that relationship. The same can be said for the relationship between Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin - although he seems to be more of a mentor than anything else. But it's the connection between the two, and I hope this gets developed in the sequel.I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel, but I definitely suggest if you are watching this movie for the first time, you do NOT make the same mistake I made, and watch it complete with the extended scenes! It really interrupts the flow of the film, and is almost distracting at times - and then I couldn't find an `obvious' option to switch the extended scenes off!

Usually, you can understand why scenes were exiled. In this case, it makes you wonder what director Brian Singer was thinking. Most of the material that was cut helps explain the character motivations beyond anything that had previously been seen. The relationship between Jean Grey and Wolverine actually gets some meaning to it. It helps delve into Rogue's mind a bit more as well.The movie itself is curiously involving despite it's shortcomings. Is it great, no. The special effects are though. The performances, for the most part, are very good. And, it rarely falls below good. Best of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Now, if only Anna Paquin could decide if she's going to actually have an accent through the whole movie (No Kevin Costner jokes.)This DVD was released to capitalize on the pending success of &quot;X-2: X-Men United&quot; and as such only adds a slight bit to the canon of the film itself.

I used to read the comics when I was younger and loved them, but I didn't pick up on that theme. Perhaps, it was stronger in the very beginnings of the comics or I was just to young to pick up on it. Either way, it has been presented brilliantly here. Second, I enjoy how the story is built on the characters themselves and not just flashy special effects. I think that there is a very strong &quot;human&quot; element to the movie. An excellent example of this is the decision not to mask Wolverine. While Wolverine is a compelling character in the comics, in this medium he is noticably more engaging and real. Hugh Jackman is a National treasure (yes I know he's not American, but whatever!).Now, the features. I only have one problem with this set. The enhanced viewing mode. I don't like how you can play a deleted scene and then the version of that scene that made it into the movie plays as soon as you return to the movie. Other than that, I absolutely love the extras. Disc two is packed with documentary footage of the making of every detail of the movie. Of particular note is Hugh's first reading with Bryan Singer. Definitely interesting to watch for the large amount of dialogue cut out of the Wolverine's scene with Rogue on the train. Don't miss it. Also watch for a couple of clips of Sabretooth wearing sunglasses. Surreal and Hilarious.So in short, funny, interesting, fascinating, and moving.

725143,A2PZFKRMQ1VDM3,B000078UJV,Mikey,"[25, 29]","I had relatively low expectations for the adaptation of the X-Men comic books. This movie though blew them away by a longshot. The movie begins with a young Eric Lensherr being taken prisoner at a Nazi concentration camp and his powers to control magnetism manifesting. He would become the main villain Magneto in this movie's plot, using mutant energy to power a machine that emits some sort of radiation that alters normal human's cells and ultimately causing them to perish from the effects of the radiation. Wolverine is introduced to Professor Charles Xavier and gradually form the superhero action team The X-Men. Patrick Stewert was absolutely perfect for the role of Charles Xavier. I couldn't have come up with a better choice than Stewert. Ian McKellan IS Magneto! The others don't fare as well. Halle Berry as Storm falls flat on her face, showing almost none of the leadership of the comics character. Hugh Jackman though was great for Wolverine, showing the expressions of the comic book character. This movie overall is quite good for something that did blow some potential but it works out fine. Go and see this movie. It's really good.On another note, the 1.5 edition though is jsut a cash-in on the movie fan base. It's mostly added deleted scenes and I'm no fan of deleted scenes so if you already have the older edition, don't waste your time. I see no reason to buy the same thing over again just for some useless deleted scenes.

725144,A2UL0A8GJB4318,B000078UJV,mljkb,"[2, 2]","This cinematic adaption of the legendary Marvel Comicbook series accomplishes the near impossible:  it does the legacy of the comic books justice while still fleshing out in its own right.  Director Briyan Singer crafts compelling action sequences while still giving room for the characters to develop and interact, and quite nuancedly too.  The characters gel almost immediately, and the actors give textured performances.  The best is Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine.  His performance is vital to the appeal of the film, since the film focuses the majority of the time on his character.Plot: While Logan is etching out a living as a bar fighter in Rural Canada, the U.S. congress is considering a bill to register all mutants, humans who have altered DNA that give them special powers.  Think of it as racial profiling but on a genetic level.  Out of this, two old friends, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) are at odds about how they should deal with the attitudes that normal people have towards them.  Xavier belives in giving the people time to be more accepting, while Magneto has run out patience and wants to make the general population of humans Mutants.In the mean time, a girl from Mississippi, nicknamed Rouge (Anna Paquin) flees home for Canada when she finds her power is putting people in a coma while taking their special talents and memories for a time.  In Canada she meets Logan, and together the make their way to Xavier, and become part of the intrique that is brewing between Xavier and Magneto.And that tension leads to some spectacular action sequences between the X-Men and Magneto's hoardes, especially the train station encounter and the finale in the Statue of Liberty.  The fights in this scene rival that of the Matrix in terms of Martial Arts type stunts and quick, confident camera work from Director Singer.But what lifts this film above so many other action films is the well-developed relationships between the characters and a smart script that deals with the issues of human segreation via genetic mutations, and the warring opinions on either side of the issue, even if those warring stances turn into violence.",4,"Fun, Deep and Intelligent",1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,2176,"['cinematic', 'adaption', 'legendary', 'Marvel', 'Comicbook', 'series', 'near', 'impossible', 'legacy', 'comic', 'books', 'justice', 'still', 'fleshing', 'out', 'own', 'right', 'Director', 'Briyan', 'Singer', 'crafts', 'compelling', 'action', 'sequences', 'still', 'giving', 'room', 'characters', 'develop', 'interact', 'quite', 'nuancedly', 'too', 'characters', 'gel', 'almost', 'immediately', 'actors', 'give', 'textured', 'performances', 'best', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Logan/Wolverine', 'performance', 'vital', 'appeal', 'film', 'film', 'majority', 'time', 'character.Plot', 'Logan', 'etching', 'out', 'living', 'bar', 'fighter', 'Rural', 'Canada', 'U.S.', 'congress', 'considering', 'bill', 'register', 'mutants', 'humans', 'who', 'have', 'altered', 'DNA', 'give', 'special', 'powers', 'Think', 'racial', 'profiling', 'genetic', 'level', 'two', 'old', 'friends', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Magneto', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'are', 'odds', 'how', 'should', 'deal', 'attitudes', 'normal', 'people', 'have', 'towards', 'Xavier', 'belives', 'giving', 'people', 'time', 'be', 'more', 'accepting', 'Magneto', 'run', 'out', 'patience', 'make', 'general', 'population', 'humans', 'Mutants.In', 'mean', 'time', 'girl', 'Mississippi', 'nicknamed', 'Rouge', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'home', 'Canada', 'when', 'power', 'putting', 'people', 'coma', 'taking', 'special', 'talents', 'memories', 'time', 'Canada', 'Logan', 'together', 'make', 'way', 'Xavier', 'become', 'part', 'intrique', 'brewing', 'Xavier', 'Magneto.And', 'tension', 'spectacular', 'action', 'sequences', 'X-Men', 'Magneto', 'hoardes', 'especially', 'train', 'station', 'encounter', 'finale', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'fights', 'scene', 'rival', 'Matrix', 'terms', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'type', 'stunts', 'quick', 'confident', 'camera', 'work', 'Director', 'Singer.But', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'action', 'films', 'well-developed', 'relationships', 'characters', 'smart', 'script', 'deals', 'issues', 'human', 'segreation', 'genetic', 'mutations', 'warring', 'opinions', 'side', 'issue', 'even', 'warring', 'stances', 'turn', 'violence']",N/A
725145,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B000078UJV,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[10, 11]","The X FactorAs most of the world knows by now, X-Men is the live-action version of the of the Marvel comic strip, directed by Bryan Singer (of the Usual Suspects fame). Set in the not too distant future the X-Men are humans who thanks to genetic mutation have inherited special powers. A box office hit back in 2000 taking in over $157m at the US box office alone, 2003 sees the sequel imaginatively titled X-Men 2 hit our cinema screens and as something of a pre-cursor the X-Men DVD has been repackaged and re-released complete with a host of new extras. But is it worth buying?The ExtrasDisc 1 contains seven behind-the-scenes featurettes and six scenes deleted from the final cut of the theatrical release. Director Bryan Singer also provides an audio commentary (previously unavailable on the original DVD release) in which he discusses the movie, the difficulties filming it and provides the odd insight into the sequel. Plus Disc 1 also includes six extended scenes which can be incorporated into the main feature although these are not new, having been previously available on the original DVD version.Disc 2's main feature is a (making of) documentary Evolution X, which pretty much covers the complete process of making the movie from pre-production meetings, costume fittings, through to the Ellis Island premiere. This, for many, will be a very interesting insight into the process of how a movie of this scale is brought together and exactly what goes on behind the scenes, with plenty of stress and gnashing of teeth from the film-makers.Additional disc 2 also includes Hugh Jackman's screen test and a promo for the sequel. Whether you feel this enough to tempt you into buying X-Men 1.5 will depend on whether you already own X-Men on DVD, whether you buy DVDs for the extras (personally I don't) and how big an X-fan you are. The choice is yours!The MovieHaving special powers sounds great (you might think) but in X-Men the mutant race is an oppressed and persecuted minority, due to the bigotry, ignorance and fears of much of the non-mutant population. To make matters worse an ambitious and influential Senator (Bruce Davison) wants to introduce a registration policy for mutants in an attempt to further restrict their civil rights. Divided in how best to respond to this, the mutant community is split into two camps led by Professor X, aka Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto, aka Erik Mangus Lensherr (Sir Ian McKellen). Magneto believes in the supremacy of the mutant population, which he is willing to use force to prove, whilst Professor X merely wants, equality, integration and peace. With fundamentally opposing views the two camps are set on a collision course with the future of the human race at stake.X-Men is an entertaining action movie and it has some great fight scenes but it is pitched at its intended mass audience and carefully falls short explicit violence making it pretty much suitable for all but young children. However, although the X Men movie comes from a comic book background and is definitely aimed at a mass audience it also has a message and is a lot more highbrow than most super hero adaptations. X Men for example opens with a scene in a Nazi concentration camp with a young Magneto witnessing his mother being shepherded off to the gas chamber and from this it is pretty clear that Director Bryan Singer is deliberately making a point and drawing a comparison. It is also worth noting that at the time of the X-Men's creation, back in 1963, among the major political figures in pre civil rights America were Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and it is easy to draw comparisons with Professor X and Magneto. Comparisons can also be drawn between X-Men character Senator Robert Kelly and a certain Senator McCarthy. What is more, X-Men is particularly pertinent at a time when there is so much tabloid speculation and scare mongering with regard to genetic engineering.With X-Men Director Bryan Singer, a self-confessed fan, has stayed remarkably loyal to the comic books and has served up a commercial but extremely enjoyable film with impressive special effects, which has inevitably spawned a sequel and (in all likelihood) a franchise, which makes me for one very happy. Full of great characters and great performances from the likes of Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine), Anna Pacquin (as Rogue) and Famke Janssen (as Dr Jean Grey) and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (as Mystique). However, it is the excellent pairing of the Royal Shakespeare company's McKellen and Stewart opposite each other that really adds gravitas to the proceedings and my only real dissapointments were seeing the excellent and beautiful Halle Berry (as Storm) being under-used and the relatively short running length of 97 minutes.X Men 2 opened this weekend, with the pre-release hype promising it will be bigger, better and more exciting. With several new X-Men, including Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and Brian Cox as new nasty bad guy, General Stryker, if this one lives up to the hype it will be something special.Four stars

Back in 2000, Fox released X-Men on a sub-par DVD that had a great menu design but so-so extras.  Now with Fox's latest big budget comic property, Daredevil raking in the cash, it seemed like a good time to re-release X-Men on DVD with all the extras that it should have gotten the first time.  Even though it is spread out on two discs, the extras themselves really don't add anything worth owning, so if you allready own the older X-Men DVD than there is no reason to rush out and buy this.  However, if you don't own the older DVD, then this is a good buy mainly because X-Men is one of the best comic to film adaptions ever.  It was a forgone conclusion that Patrick Stewart would be a perfect fit for Professor X, and Hugh Jackman came out of nowhere (he was a virtual unknown before he starred in this) and played Wolverine to perfection.  Ian McKellen seems a bit too frail to be the mighty Magneto, and a pre-Oscar winning Halle Berry is actually a bit bad as Storm (although her role in the upcoming X-Men 2 is said to do her more justice).  The special effects are great, and director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) knew what he was doing as a director because he himself is a fan of the comic.  All in all, the long awaited big screen take of X-Men is five stars in itself, but thanks to the sloppy DVD (and timing of release) this gets a four.

When I saw it in 2000 at the theater, I didn't tought much of it, but when I saw it on DVD, it changed my opinion. The movie doesn't have that much visual effetcs, but it is based on characters and the movie is really to make us understand what are the X-Men. Hugh Jackman is a very good new actor and probably the new superstar actor. The movie starts with Magneto when he was young in Germany and how he discoverd he had the power to create magnetic fields. Then, we meet Rogue who discovers that she is rather dangerous when touched by someone. There is also Charles A.Xavier who is the head of the college for mutants and the creator of the X-Men. He goes to Washington to attend a meeting at the senate where a senator fights against the mutants. The next X-Men we meet, is Wolverine, who is a mutant that has the ability to heal himself of everything. He also has a skeleton made out of metal and claws comes out of his hands when he needs to use them. He fights in a club in Canada and that's where he meets Rogue who ran away from home. She follows him until he meets Sabertooth on the highway and is forced to fight with. He is captured by good mutants and they take him to Xavier's college. Meanwhile, Magneto captures the senator and transform him into a mutant. When Magneto kidnaps Rogue, Wolverine and the other X-Men and forced to go and save her. The movie is very good, but the DVD is awesome, you parcticaly see the whole making of the movie and you a load of extras like other documentaries about visual effects and the premiere of the movie, it also have the screen test of Hugh Jackman and other actors.

Witness the Director's Edition of &quot;Star Trek II,&quot; or the amazing second release of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; which was loaded with hours and hours' worth of exciting AND informative extras about the making of the movie while simultaneously providing an entirely new cut of the movie itself which is worth viewing over and over again!On that note, we return to &quot;X-Men.&quot;  While this is mostly a tremendously entertaining movie (which is the sole reason I gave this specific DVD three stars), it is one of the very few films I've seen which I can honestly say IS NOT LONG ENOUGH.  It rushes the expositional material too much, ultimately devoting a mere 90 minutes to an expansive movie that could EASILY have sustained itself for a full 2 hours.  What's amazing to me is that the deleted scenes (as made initially viewable on the original &quot;X-Men&quot; DVD release) are not particularly extraneous; they're actually very nice moments that give us further insights into the characters, which would've helped to make this very good movie GREAT.  And that, quite honestly, is what I was expecting to get when I purchased this new &quot;X-Men 1.5&quot;... an expanded director's cut that would actually WARRANT a re-release like this (as opposed to that shoddy branching feature on the original DVD that allows you to watch the deleted scenes in sequence with the movie, but in a VERY jolting and awkward way that makes them unbearable).  The new features on this re-release aren't really exciting enough to warrant a purchase if you already own the original &quot;X-Men&quot; DVD (heck, most of them are branched into the movie AND the featurettes as &quot;interactive&quot; features, which means that you can't just sit back and enjoy... you've got to watch the TV with a hair-trigger finger on the remote!  Believe you me, it's VERY obnoxious).However, if you're a collector or if you're specifically interested in behind-the-scenes material, then I'm sure you'll find this to be a worthwhile addition to your collection.

725152,A319YRDK8Y39N,B000078UJV,"""qmlhcb""","[6, 9]","""X-Men"" is a fun comic book film that despite its flaws, serves as a good start to a new comic movie franchise.When I first saw it in the theater I enjoyed it but walked out kind of cold from the experience. Sure it was fun, it presented great characterizations of the X-men and had several great moments, but on a whole it felt rather empty. Granted director Bryan Singer had to introduce many mutant characters and the whole X-men world in one movie while introducing a manageable plot, as well as dealing with major studio and monetary problems. However, that doesn't make a decent movie great by default.The most apparent fault is how the introductions of characters (with most emphasis on Rogue and Wolverine as they become X-men) doesn't balance well with the emerging plot of Magneto (Ian McKellen) planning to turn the world's leaders into mutants. Honestly, if an additional 20 minutes were added to flush this out, it would work much better. The film only clocks in at 104 minutes and as a result feels as though it's short changed a bit (again most likely do to the studio and budget problems). Also, the climax isn't as big and exciting as it could have been.Despite these problems, the film has many things to admire. First off, the acting and characterization of the mutants are for the most part excellant. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart (as Prof. X) both are perfectly cast as the differing ideology heads of two mutant groups. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine also does a great job in carrying this movie as one of the primary characters. His quest to find out who he is begins here, and represents the isolation and confusion that many mutants feel when they realize they have powers which society frown on.Also, the analogy the film version of X-men provides a great social commentary on the issue of homophobia. When the comics came out, it was during the civil rights movement and the X-men's struggle for acceptance mirrored prejudice against African Americans.Still, the faults of ""X-Men"" are too apparent to make it a great film. But it does serve to be a stepping stone to the second film in the series: X2, which is by all means a great film with none of the first one's faults.

The solid and creative storyline and some realistic human tension sets this movie higher than previous campy superhero action films. Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin not only look the part but also act out their heroic characters perfectly. Hugh Jackman's performance as rugged Wolverine is just one of the movie's highlights.With the upcoming sequel just a few months away, Fox re-release the original comic book blockbuster in a surprising 2-disc special edition DVD.

His mistakes begin at the tone: he places the cartoon heroes into a hyper-realistic setting, and it suffocates them.  Stripped of its fantasy, the film tries to tell the most story with the least possible activity, and the result is forced, hurried, and often difficult to swallow (the newscasters always drop major plot points at the perfect moments).  The cast is lost without Hugh Jackman: he's wound tight enough to snap, yet his eyes convey a sensitivity he tries to repress.  The rest of the cast is mostly scenery, particularly the curiously silent villains, and Halle Berry's Storm is a testament to bad casting.

725158,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000078UJV,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","I put off seeing this movie for a long time.  I'm one of those fans that when I read a book I really, really love - whether a novel or comic book series - I usually hesitate to see the movie for fear of having it conflict with the way I already perceive the material in my mind's eye.  Plus, comic book adaptations in particular have a rather spotty record in my opinion.  The 80s/90s ""Batman"" live-actions were alright (except for the last one, which I only decided to break down and chance watching after being wowed by ""X-Men"" & ""X2"" and "" Spider-Man"") but weren't really true to the comics, and couldn't touch their level of quality.  The Batman animated material, on the other hand, was a rare high mark for comic adaptations, they were very good, and though toned down and simplified for a younger audience, were overall true to the books.  The Marvel adaptations - the early 90s ""Captain America"" movie, what I saw of the 90s animated ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" stuff...well, let's just say I found all the Marvel adptations prior to the last few years to be very unsatisfactory.  To top it off, the ads for this movie made it look like it was going to be about as close to the comics as ""The New Adventures Of Lois And Clark"" was to the ""Superman"" comics, based on what I saw of it.  Mystique and Toad way, way altered, the X-costumes gone and replaced by the black leather that for a while it looked like All the comics-derived characters were going to don (when I heard they were making ""Spider-Man"" I honestly expected them to stick him in some black leather get-up, with maybe a red mask or something) and so on...But eventually, I capitulated and decided to take a chance, and just view this as an alternate vision of the X-Men concept, without expecting it to match up too closely.  Lo and behold!  I couldn't believe my eyes as the movie started unfolding - they were actually getting it right!  In spirit, only a couple of the characters - the aforementioned Mystique and Toad - were markedly different from their comic book selves, while the rest of them - Wolverine, Xavier, Jean Grey, Magneto (for the most part), Cyclops, Storm, Rogue - they got the heart and soul right; and they got the whole Feel of the x-Men concept pretty close to dead-on.  With so much matching up right, things like getting the costumes all wrong no longer seemed so unbearable.Granted, there were a few things toned down or altered; Magneto's true origins, while tragic here, are presented less graphically for a wider audience.  When you read enough of the actual comics you realize why it would have been a miracle for him to turn out any way other than how he eventually did.  As for how he did turn out, while the filmmakers got his depth and drive, he came off as a bit more of a pure villain here than he usually does when handled right in the comics - he tends to waver closer to the cusp between hero and villain, and occasionally straddle or even cross it in the comics.  And with Wolverine, it was a mistake the way they had his blood just magically evaporate or seep back into his body or however it disappeared when his wounds healed.  His wounds do heal at a phenomenal rate, but the blood already spilled doesn't just 'go away'.  I guess they figured it was the only way to show his healing power and make sure everyone understood what was going on.But these are minor quibbles when put against the movie as a whole; you could be picky and deduct a half point for this and a tenth of a point for that, or you could add up everything they did right and find you've got a ten out of ten before you're halfway down the list.  Even the casting turned out to be brilliant.  Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellan, for example are definately Not who I would have picked for Wolverine and Magneto, but they proved me wrong and made the parts their own.If you see this movie and like it (or love it) I'd also recommend X2 (naturally), Spider-Man (haven't seen the 2nd one yet so can't comment but it looks great), the animated Batman stuff, Darkman (not based on a comic but, made in 1990, it captured the spirit and feel of modern comics far better than any movie up to that point had), the X-Men comics (they've had a few rough periods over the decades but have usually been excellent, like they are currently), numerous other comic series (Spider-Man, Batman, Hawkman, Hulk, Superman, etc. - there's lots of trade paperback compilations of these right here on Amazon) and the Byron Preiss/Boulevard Books paperback (not comic book; it's all in prose) ""The Ultimate Silver Surfer"", featuring short stories by an array of authors, with ""On The Beach"" by John J. Ordover and ""The Broken Land"" by Pierce Askegren being among the best.",5,I Can't Belive They Did This Right!,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,4724,"['put', 'off', 'seeing', 'movie', 'long', 'time',

Although I never read the X-Men comics as a boy, I had a sense of the main characters and some idea of what to expect going into the film.  After watching the film, however, I was dazzled not only by the dazzling special effects, but also how well the ensemble cast of theatrical heavy hitters (Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, to name a few) blended their performances.  Like the X-Men themselves, the whole of the cast is significantly greater than the sum of its parts.Even people who may have been turned off by other ""superhero"" movies that require a bit more suspension of disbelief have commented that not only was X-Men interesting, it also conveys an obvious message of tolerance for those who are different, which was Stan Lee's original intent when he created the characters.I waited for version 1.5 to be released before I actually purchased this DVD, and although 1.5 does provide a second disc of extra features, I didn't find them all that interesting except for the preview of X2, which by now, of course is already also on DVD.

It's one of the few films where you can sympathize with both the lead protaganist (Xavier) as well as its antagonist (Magneto). Growing up with the X-men I was not dissapointed and clearly could see the reasons behind the changes that they made. Director Bryan Singer juggles the ensemble with little difficulty and manages to introduce newcomers to a thirtysomething year history while sating the diehard zealots by treating the material with respect. That being said, when watching the behind the scenes documentaries, I found it dissapointing that not a single cast/crew member was an X-men fan before the film. Screenwriter Desanto being the only exception.A feature on the DVD is the &quot;enhanced&quot; version of the film. Similar to Spider-Man and Moulin Rouge when the symbol pops up on the screen in the lower corner it takes you to a three to five minute behind-the-scenes vignette. But the similarity ends there. These snippets are uninformative and really have no point. The camera just rolls and no one explains why they are showing you what they are showing you, save for an exception on the costumes. The same with the &quot;Video Scrapbook&quot; segment.The flipside to that is the commentary is very good. Singer is modestly proud of his work and loves to share interesting tidbits that you may not know and may have missed. There is also another guy on there who never really clarifies who he is, but the two play off of each other well making this fun to listen to.Since I don't have the first offering of this DVD, I really can't say if you should buy this movie again.
