An intrepid time tumbler, Pack (Ian Michaels) tumbles back to the now to obtain an air sample that can be replicated and save the world. But wait a minute; why do these people know him? Has he been here before?In Packs 11 minute sojourns into the present he finds himself returning to the same wedding reception for some inexplicable reason. Will he accomplish his mission and in the process will there be time enough for love?I've always been a fan of time travel movies but not particularly those where you go before and after yourself and I've seen quite a few of those. However this presentation captures your imagination and does a fairly good job of it. Don't expect popular places or popular people or even a slick presentation; it's that style of an independent movie that gives you the feeling it has been made just for you.The Sticky Fingers of Time",5,"""Falling into this laughter...

Of course, you will do that anyway. Then you get to spend days, tying all the treads together. Enjoy it.

1234731,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B001S2Q5W6,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","11 Minutes Ago has a simple concept: a mysterious man appears at a wedding reception claiming he's a time traveler.  Is he telling the truth?  And why is a camera crew who seems to know everything about him following him around?What ensues is an ultra low-budget foray into time travel mechanics, wedding politics, and true love. Pack (Ian Michaels) appears in the bathroom of an indoor reception for a rained-out wedding. A videography crew, led by Jeffrey (Bob Gebert), tracks his every move and knows everything about him.  We discover why shortly after Pack's appearance: he is indeed a ""time tumbler"" traveling backward (and sometimes forward) in time.  The crew already knows quite a bit about Pack because they've met him before, even though the audience that Pack is introduced to is ignorant of his circumstances.It seems Pack is a scientist concerned about collecting air samples; the future is a polluted place and it is diminishing civilization's libido. Only an air sample from a certain place and time will do, and so Pack travels back in the midst of a party that boils over with intrigue.  All of these events are recorded by the videographers and a mysterious other camera. Between them, multiple stories unfold.All this time travel can be confusing so Pack helpfully provides a chalk drawing of his 11-minute increment time tumbles and how they interact with each other.  In Pack's future considerably more time passes between tumbles, and we learn about his feelings as the plot progresses.Oh right, his feelings.  Pack is in love with Cynthia (Christina Mauro), a gentle soul whose personality is revealed as she navigates the political and emotional minefield that is her boss' wedding party.  She deftly juggles lascivious bridesmaids, lascivious fathers, a drunk groom, and enough drama to launch its own soap opera.11 Minutes Ago gets a lot of things right.  Pack manages to be both, awkward, and idealistic without being too cloying.  The videography trick cleverly provides an audience perspective without being too gimmicky.  And the various plot points are interesting, if sometimes unlikely.The problem is that in a film like this with almost no budget to speak of, the actors carry the entire movie.  Some, like the loose bridesmaid, are mere stereotypes who are curiously ignorant about the presence of a videographer that is routinely referenced by the other characters.  Others are simply too stupid to be believable.The biggest problem is Mauro herself.  The camera lovingly focuses on her every emotion, as if willing us to fall in love with her.  But the reality is that Mauro is just not a very good actress.  Her wooden delivery, endless whispering monotone, and one emotion (a slight smirk) makes it difficult to see Pack's infatuation with her. She doesn't seem to have enough charisma to justify Pack's considerable efforts to romance her in such a short timeframe.Although 11 Minutes Ago's heart is in the right place -- time is meaningless when it comes to true love - it tries to pack too much in with an uneven cast.  It's cute, but with the right actress it could have been great.",3,Packs a lot in,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,3126,"['11', 'Minutes', 'Ago', 'simple', 'concept', 'mysterious', 'man', 'wedding', 'reception', 'claiming', 'time', 'traveler', 'telling', 'truth', 'why', 'camera', 'crew', 'who', 'know', 'everything', 'following', 'around', 'What', 'ultra', 'low-budget', 'foray', 'time', 'travel', 'mechanics', 'wedding', 'politics', 'true', 'love', 'Pack', 'Ian', 'Michaels', 'bathroom', 'indoor', 'reception', 'rained-out', 'wedding', 'videography', 'crew', 'led', 'Jeffrey', 'Bob', 'Gebert', 'move', 'everything', 'discover', 'why', 'shortly', 'Pack', 'appearance', 'indeed', 'time', 'tumbler', 'traveling', 'backward', 'sometimes', 'forward', 'time', 'crew', 'already', 'quite', 'bit', 'Pack', ""'ve"", 'met', 'even', 'audience', 'Pack', 'introduced', 'ignorant', 'circumstances.It', 'Pack', 'scientist', 'concerned', 'collecting', 'air', 'samples', 'future', 'polluted', 'place', 'diminishing', 'civilization', 'libido', 'Only', 'air', 'sample', 'certain', 'place', 'time', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'Pack', 'back', 'midst', 'party', 'intrigue', 'events', 'are', 'recorded', 'videographers', 'mysterious', 'other', 'camera', 'Between', 'multiple', 'stories', 'time', 'travel', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'so', 'Pack', 'helpfully', 'chalk', 'drawing', '11-minute', 'increment', 'time', 'tumbles', 'how', 'interact', 'other', 'Pack', 'future', 'considerably', 'more', 'time', 'passes', 'tumbles', 'learn', 'feelings', 'plot', 'progresses.Oh', 'right', 'feelings', 'Pack', 'love', 'Cynthia', 'Christina', 'Mauro', 'gentle', 'soul', 'personality', 'revealed', 'political', 'emotional', 'minefield', 'boss', 'wedding', 'party', 'deftly', 'lascivious', 'bridesmaids', 'lascivious', 'fathers', 'drunk', 'groom', 'enough', 'drama', 'launch', 'own', 'soap', 'opera.11', 'Minutes', 'Ago', 'lot', 'things', 'right', 'Pack', 'manages', 'be', 'awkward', 'idealistic', 'being', 'too', 'cloying', 'videography', 'trick', 'cleverly', 'audience', 'perspective', 'being', 'too', 'gimmicky', 'various', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'unlikely.The', 'problem', 'film', 'almost', 'budget', 'speak', 'actors', 'carry', 'entire', 'movie', 'loose', 'bridesmaid', 'are', 'mere', 'stereotypes', 'who', 'are', 'curiously', 'ignorant', 'presence', 'videographer', 'routinely', 'referenced', 'other', 'characters', 'Others', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'stupid', 'be', 'believable.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Mauro', 'camera', 'lovingly', 'emotion', 'willing', 'fall', 'love', 'reality', 'Mauro', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'wooden', 'delivery', 'endless', 'whispering', 'monotone', 'one', 'emotion', 'slight', 'smirk', 'difficult', 'see', 'Pack', 'infatuation', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'enough', 'charisma', 'justify', 'Pack', 'considerable', 'efforts', 'romance', 'such', 'short', 'timeframe.Although', '11', 'Minutes', 'Ago', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'time', 'meaningless', 'when', 'true', 'love', 'pack', 'too', 'much', 'uneven', 'cast', 'cute', 'right', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great']",11 Minutes Ago
