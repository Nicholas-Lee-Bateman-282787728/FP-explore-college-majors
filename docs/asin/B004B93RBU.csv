1394202,AJZ05YTL63CQK,B004B93RBU,Richard B,"[6, 6]","National Geographic has produced some excellent DVD's on various subject matter. This is a good example of their work. However, for the most part if you have studied ancient Rome or other films on the subject of Rome you will pick up little in the way of new material. For example, we all know that Caligula was a mad emperor, what caused him to go mad or speculation on the type of disease he had is not that exciting.There is a pull out flyer inside the box with the DVD's that I found to contain some interesting facts it's worth the read. Over all if you have seen other films on Rome you can pass on this one. If you are just starting to look at Rome in its past glory you might want to add this one to your collection of past empires.",4,This was ok just not great,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,740,"['National', 'Geographic', 'produced', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'various', 'subject', 'matter', 'good', 'example', 'work', 'However', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'studied', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'other', 'films', 'subject', 'Rome', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'little', 'way', 'new', 'material', 'example', 'know', 'Caligula', 'was', 'mad', 'emperor', 'what', 'caused', 'go', 'mad', 'speculation', 'type', 'disease', 'had', 'not', 'pull', 'out', 'flyer', 'box', 'DVD', 'found', 'contain', 'interesting', 'facts', 'read', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'Rome', 'can', 'pass', 'one', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'look', 'Rome', 'past', 'glory', 'might', 'want', 'add', 'one', 'collection', 'past', 'empires']",When Rome Ruled
1394203,A2V92F5R7MLCVI,B004B93RBU,wogan,"[36, 37]","`When Rome Ruled' is a 3 disc set with 2 episodes on each. They include; Secrets of the Gladiators, the Real Caligula, Doomsday Pompeii, Killing Caesar, Birth of Rome, and Ancient Superpower. Each has English subtitles.The first, Secrets of Rome is more about the coliseum and some little known facts, such as, Rome was one of the last cities to build a stone structure to house their games because they didn't trust their citizens to gather in large groups, also how the coliseum would have been filled with water. On the other hand, they tell about the wonderful emergency evacuation system, but never even hint at how it would have worked.Doomsday Pompeii purports itself to be the never before told story of the common people, which is a bit of an exaggeration.Birth of Rome is also a slight misnomer, it really tells how Caesar constructed many of Rome `s structures (the city was already built) and how the city was controlled by Caesar Augustus after Caesar is murdered, the building of the aqueducts and turning a city of brick into marble. Hadrian's rule is mentioned, but nothing of his most famous work Hadrian's Wall.There are extras and a bonus program' Treasure Seekers' much of which consists of close ups of carvings and a montage of information that it seems couldn't have been fitted in elsewhere.`In the Shadow of Ancient Romeis not captioned and the volume is much softer than the rest of the programs.For all of these episodes they have the usual talking heads - historians giving their opinions and facts; however all of them had the extremely irritating habit of looking off to the side of the camera, as if they are staring at someone to the left or right. Some scenes, such as people strolling through villas, adjusting their tunics, eating and reclining in their villas are used  multiple times in every episode.This is, in total though is a very good lesson on Rome.",4,"Veni, Vidi, Vici",1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,1893,"['When', 'Rome', 'Ruled', '3', 'disc', 'set', '2', 'episodes', 'include', 'Secrets', 'Gladiators', 'Real', 'Caligula', 'Doomsday', 'Pompeii', 'Killing', 'Caesar', 'Birth', 'Rome', 'Ancient', 'Superpower', 'English', 'subtitles.The', 'first', 'Secrets', 'Rome', 'more', 'coliseum', 'little', 'known', 'facts', 'such', 'Rome', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'cities', 'build', 'stone', 'structure', 'house', 'games', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'citizens', 'gather', 'large', 'groups', 'also', 'how', 'coliseum', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'water', 'other', 'hand', 'tell', 'wonderful', 'emergency', 'evacuation', 'system', 'never', 'even', 'hint', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'worked.Doomsday', 'Pompeii', 'be', 'never', 'told', 'story', 'common', 'people', 'bit', 'exaggeration.Birth', 'Rome', 'also', 'slight', 'misnomer', 'really', 'how', 'Caesar', 'constructed', 'many', 'Rome', 's', 'structures', 'city', 'was', 'already', 'built', 'how', 'city', 'was', 'controlled', 'Caesar', 'Augustus', 'Caesar', 'murdered', 'building', 'aqueducts', 'turning', 'city', 'brick', 'marble', 'Hadrian', 'rule', 'mentioned', 'nothing', 'most', 'famous', 'work', 'Hadrian', 'Wall.There', 'are', 'extras', 'bonus', 'program', 'Treasure', 'Seekers', 'much', 'close', 'ups', 'carvings', 'montage', 'information', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'fitted', 'elsewhere.', 'Shadow', 'Ancient', 'Romeis', 'not', 'captioned', 'volume', 'much', 'softer', 'rest', 'programs.For', 'episodes', 'have', 'usual', 'talking', 'heads', 'historians', 'giving', 'opinions', 'facts', 'however', 'had', 'extremely', 'irritating', 'habit', 'looking', 'off', 'side', 'camera', 'are', 'staring', 'someone', 'left', 'right', 'scenes', 'such', 'people', 'strolling', 'villas', 'adjusting', 'tunics', 'eating', 'reclining', 'villas', 'are', 'used', 'multiple', 'times', 'episode.This', 'total', 'though', 'very', 'good', 'lesson', 'Rome']",When Rome Ruled
1394204,A1DSOF0EK9G06C,B004B93RBU,Zarathustra,"[1, 3]","I have National Geographic documentaries that I like and some I don't like, but When Rome Ruled is the worst. My main complaint is the lack of organization. We see hundreds of so-called &#34;experts&#34;, some of whom are just labeled  &#34;Historian&#34; or from the famous University of Cincinnati or the great University of Southern Maine. Maybe I could find someone from Sacramento City College who could give another opinion.  There is no expert who summarizes what the others are saying. Too many cooks spoil the broth.There is no apparent order to the documentary. It begins with Secrets of the Gladiators, then goes to The Real Caligula, then Doomsday Pompei. On disc two we get Birth of Rome. Why not put that one on disc one?I learned more about Rome in the Ridley Scott movie Gladiator and Woody Allen's movie To Rome With Love.Finally, this is a blu-ray. It is the worst looking blu-ray I have seen. I have seen DVDs that look better. I have been spoiled by watching History Channel blu-rays: e.g. The Universe and How The Earth Was Made, which are well organized and look great.",1,I Thought This Documentary Would Never End,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,1091,"['have', 'National', 'Geographic', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'When', 'Rome', 'Ruled', 'worst', 'main', 'complaint', 'lack', 'organization', 'see', 'hundreds', 'so-called', '34', 'experts', '34', 'whom', 'are', 'just', 'labeled', '34', 'Historian', '34', 'famous', 'University', 'Cincinnati', 'great', 'University', 'Southern', 'Maine', 'Maybe', 'could', 'find', 'someone', 'Sacramento', 'City', 'College', 'who', 'could', 'give', 'opinion', 'expert', 'who', 'what', 'others', 'are', 'saying', 'Too', 'many', 'cooks', 'spoil', 'broth.There', 'apparent', 'order', 'documentary', 'Secrets', 'Gladiators', 'then', 'Real', 'Caligula', 'then', 'Doomsday', 'Pompei', 'disc', 'two', 'get', 'Birth', 'Rome', 'Why', 'not', 'put', 'one', 'disc', 'one', 'learned', 'more', 'Rome', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'movie', 'Gladiator', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'Rome', 'Love.Finally', 'blu-ray', 'worst', 'looking', 'blu-ray', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'seen', 'DVDs', 'look', 'better', 'have', 'been', 'spoiled', 'watching', 'History', 'Channel', 'blu-rays', 'e.g', 'Universe', 'How', 'Earth', 'Was', 'Made', 'are', 'well', 'organized', 'look', 'great']",When Rome Ruled
