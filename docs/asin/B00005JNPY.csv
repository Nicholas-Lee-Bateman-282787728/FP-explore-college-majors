633661,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JNPY,Alex Udvary,"[2, 4]","Dan Harris' ""Imaginary Heroes"" owes a lot to suburban movies such as ""Ordinary People"", ""The Ice Storm"", ""American Beauty"" and the recent ""The Upside of Anger"". ""Heroes"" is actually better than ""Anger"" but lacks the raw emotional engery of the other three movies.Harris is only 26 years old and was 23 when he made this film. That is quite an impressive feat. The kid's got talent. Already at 23 he seems to understand people and knows how to make characters real. He gives us something to relate to. That may not impress many of you, but let me tell you, there are plenty of ""adults"" working in the business whom are unable to do just that. So give the kid his due credit.Harris has made some short films, and they actually seem similar to this film. It seems Harris took some of the ideas he had from these short films and turned them into one feature lenght film. ""Dancing with Agnes"" was a movie dealing with suicide and ""The Killing of Candice Klein"" was about the relationship between a mother and son. These are two of the subjects ""Imaginary Heroes"" deals with.""Imaginary Heroes"" starts off with a voice-over done by Tim Travis (Emile Hirsch) talking about his ""hero"" bother Matt (Kip Pardue) who was a swimming champ and seemed to have a great future ahead of him. The only problem in Tim's life was the simple fact he absolutely hated swimming. Very early on, Matt committs suicide. Now it seems the movie is going to be about the ways these family members cope with the loss. And if you're not thinking about ""Ordinary People"", you should be. ""Imaginary Heroes"" tries to duplicate that movie's tone. And it does a pretty good job.After Matt's death his father Ben Travis (Jeff Daniels) blames himself for pushing Tim into swimming. It seems no one knew how unhappy Tim was. His mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) has a special bond with her son Tim (Hirsch). The two openly speak about sex and other taboo subjects. Then there is their daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) who goes to college and lives on campus.There is a sub-plot going on between Sandy and their neighbor, Marge (Deirdre O' Connell) who don't get along. Despite Marge's frequent attempts to strike up a conversation.""Imaginary Heroes"" was a movie I was really looking forward to seeing. I like suburban stories like this one. I feel I can relate to the crumbling family we see on-screen. Movies that deal with families are usually my favorites and Harris takes only a few wrong steps.The movie's biggest flaws is the surprise ending which I felt isn't dealt with the way it should be. It is just sprung on us as the movie doesn't devote enough time to this revelation. It is a pretty big shock and really required more of an explanation I thought. I also didn't care for the movie's happy ending. Here is a movie that I thought went out of its way to create a sober atmostphere and then turns on itself to offer something bright and hopeful. I don't mind if the movie wanted to suggest hope for this family but did it have to do it so cheerfully? Couldn't it restrain itself?But in the end ""Imaginary Heroes"" is worth seeing for the performances alone. Weaver, whom I feel has been appearing in some entertaining films lately ""The Ice Storm"", ""Heartbreakers"" should get an Oscar nomination for ""Best Supporting Actress"". But will the Academy remember this movie? Probably not. And Jeff Daniels really needed this movie to come along. I can't think of the last worthwhile film he appeared in.The movie may not have the power of ""American Beauty"" or ""The Ice Storm"" but it's still a pretty darn good movie.  *** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Debut film of Dan Harris is an effcetive movie. Harris seems to know how to create characters an audience can relate to. This has to be one of the most impressive debut films of recent times.",3,"""Heroes"" Are ""Ordinary People""",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,3806,"['Dan', 'Harris', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'lot', 'suburban', 'movies', 'such', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'American', 'Beauty', 'recent', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'Heroes', 'actually', 'better', 'Anger', 'raw', 'emotional', 'engery', 'other', 'three', 'movies.Harris', 'only', '26', 'years', 'old', 'was', '23', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'quite', 'impressive', 'feat', 'kid', 'got', 'talent', 'Already', '23', 'understand', 'people', 'how', 'make', 'characters', 'real', 'something', 'relate', 'may', 'not', 'impress', 'many', 'let', 'tell', 'are', 'plenty', 'adults', 'working', 'business', 'whom', 'are', 'unable', 'do', 'just', 'So', 'give', 'kid', 'due', 'credit.Harris', 'made', 'short', 'films', 'actually', 'seem', 'similar', 'film', 'Harris', 'took', 'ideas', 'had', 'short', 'films', 'turned', 'one', 'feature', 'lenght', 'film', 'Dancing', 'Agnes', 'was', 'movie', 'dealing', 'suicide', 'Killing', 'Candice', 'Klein', 'was', 'relationship', 'mother', 'son', 'are', 'two', 'subjects', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'deals', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'voice-over', 'done', 'Tim', 'Travis', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'talking', 'hero', 'Matt', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'who', 'was', 'swimming', 'champ', 'seemed', 'have', 'great', 'future', 'ahead', 'only', 'problem', 'Tim', 'life', 'was', 'simple', 'fact', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'swimming', 'Very', 'early', 'Matt', 'committs', 'suicide', 'Now', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'ways', 'family', 'members', 'cope', 'loss', ""'re"", 'not', 'thinking', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'should', 'be', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'duplicate', 'movie', 'tone', 'pretty', 'good', 'job.After', 'Matt', 'death', 'father', 'Ben', 'Travis', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'pushing', 'Tim', 'swimming', 'one', 'knew', 'how', 'unhappy', 'Tim', 'was', 'mother', 'Sandy', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'special', 'bond', 'son', 'Tim', 'Hirsch', 'two', 'openly', 'speak', 'sex', 'other', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'Then', 'daughter', 'Penny', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'college', 'campus.There', 'sub-plot', 'going', 'Sandy', 'neighbor', 'Marge', 'Deirdre', 'O', 'Connell', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'Marge', 'frequent', 'attempts', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'like', 'suburban', 'stories', 'one', 'feel', 'can', 'relate', 'crumbling', 'family', 'see', 'on-screen', 'Movies', 'deal', 'families', 'are', 'usually', 'favorites', 'Harris', 'only', 'few', 'wrong', 'steps.The', 'movie', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'surprise', 'ending', 'felt', ""n't"", 'dealt', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'sprung', 'movie', ""n't"", 'devote', 'enough', 'time', 'revelation', 'pretty', 'big', 'shock', 'really', 'required', 'more', 'explanation', 'thought', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'Here', 'movie', 'thought', 'went', 'way', 'create', 'sober', 'atmostphere', 'then', 'offer', 'something', 'bright', 'hopeful', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movie', 'wanted', 'suggest', 'hope', 'family', 'did', 'have', 'do', 'so', 'cheerfully', 'Could', ""n't"", 'restrain', 'end', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'worth', 'seeing', 'performances', 'alone', 'Weaver', 'whom', 'feel', 'been', 'appearing', 'entertaining', 'films', 'lately', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'Heartbreakers', 'should', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'will', 'Academy', 'remember', 'movie', 'Probably', 'not', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'really', 'needed', 'movie', 'come', 'along', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'last', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'appeared', 'in.The', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'power', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'still', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'movie', '***', '1\\2', '*****Bottom-line', 'Debut', 'film', 'Dan', 'Harris', 'effcetive', 'movie', 'Harris', 'know', 'how', 'create', 'characters', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'debut', 'films', 'recent', 'times']",N/A
633662,AXGZIUUVTKWEK,B00005JNPY,"A. Minutella ""mystery buff""","[6, 7]","A touching drama about the delicate intracacies a dysfunctional family goes through when a crisis occurs, ""Imaginary Heroes"" is, first and foremost, another high point in the career of Sigourney Weaver. She gives a brave, compelling performance as Sandy, who, along with the rest of her family, goes through a series of emotional challenges following the suicide of their eldest son, Matt. The movie works well for 3 main reasons: Weaver's strong performance, the relationship between Sandy and her other son, Tim (it was refreshingly original to see a  mother and son so open and honest with each other), and Sandy's feelings of ""not quite fitting into the world,"" something we can all personally relate to at one time or another. On the downside, the movie gets mired down in a convulated series of dramas and subplots. In the course of the film's running time, we get the aftermath of a beating, an arrest for pot smoking, a father's leave of absence and emotional downfall, a scene of gay experimenation, not one but two suicides, drugs and pill popping, a hospitalization and threat of disease, characters facing feelings of alienation, loneliness, and animosity, a secret affair, and hostility toward a mysterious neighbor. Wheew! Talk about putting every last egg in the basket...in fact, it gets impossible to keep track of all the mini-dramas, which lessens the impact of an otherwise startling ending.But when the film focuses on Tim and especially Sandy, the film scores a homerun...one wishes the entire film was built around their relationship, which is fresh, original and provocative. And why Weaver was ignored for any Oscar consideration is an eternal mystery.All in all, ""Imaginary Heroes"" is worth seeing, it was its compelling moments and is never boring, the acting is above average and some sequences are very well written.",4,Sigourney scores again in this touching drama,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,1845,"['touching', 'drama', 'delicate', 'intracacies', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'when', 'crisis', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'first', 'foremost', 'high', 'point', 'career', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'brave', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Sandy', 'who', 'rest', 'family', 'series', 'emotional', 'challenges', 'following', 'suicide', 'eldest', 'son', 'Matt', 'movie', 'well', '3', 'main', 'reasons', 'Weaver', 'strong', 'performance', 'relationship', 'Sandy', 'other', 'son', 'Tim', 'was', 'refreshingly', 'original', 'see', 'mother', 'son', 'so', 'open', 'honest', 'other', 'Sandy', 'feelings', 'not', 'quite', 'fitting', 'world', 'something', 'can', 'personally', 'relate', 'one', 'time', 'downside', 'movie', 'mired', 'down', 'convulated', 'series', 'dramas', 'subplots', 'course', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'get', 'aftermath', 'beating', 'arrest', 'pot', 'smoking', 'father', 'leave', 'absence', 'emotional', 'downfall', 'scene', 'gay', 'experimenation', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'suicides', 'drugs', 'pill', 'popping', 'hospitalization', 'threat', 'disease', 'characters', 'facing', 'feelings', 'alienation', 'loneliness', 'animosity', 'secret', 'affair', 'hostility', 'mysterious', 'neighbor', 'Wheew', 'Talk', 'putting', 'last', 'egg', 'basket', 'fact', 'impossible', 'keep', 'track', 'mini-dramas', 'impact', 'otherwise', 'startling', 'ending.But', 'when', 'film', 'Tim', 'especially', 'Sandy', 'film', 'homerun', 'one', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'built', 'relationship', 'fresh', 'original', 'provocative', 'why', 'Weaver', 'was', 'ignored', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'eternal', 'mystery.All', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'worth', 'seeing', 'was', 'compelling', 'moments', 'never', 'boring', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'sequences', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'written']",N/A

633664,A38F6UBQJI9QG1,B00005JNPY,"C. Copeland ""Film Fanatic""","[10, 12]","Genre: Indie Drama, Mild Dark ComedyGenre Grade: AFinal Grade: A-This was director Dan Harris' first film. He wrote the screenplay for X-Men 2 and is writing the screenplays for Superman Returns and Ender's Game. But I hope that in the near future he ventures back into the world of drama, because he knows how to do it well. I would definitely compare this film to American Beauty, as it has just as dark of subplots running throughout it, even if it gets a tad too much into melodrama in some parts of the film. There is some pretty controversial subject matter in this movie, but it's nothing contrived. Real American families deal with these kinds of things and I applaud Dan Harris for not caring what conservative America thinks and just being honest. The reason I gave this movie the ""A-"" was only because Harris didn't explore some of the darkest parts of the movie that he presented us with. Much like Closer, We Don't Live Here Anymore, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, this movie explored some dark human emotions that no one really wants to see in a movie, but serve a purpose nonetheless.On the acting side, Sigourney Weaver was great (and should have been nominated for more than just a Golden Satellite Award). Another great performance came from Emile Hirsch. I think he's a great actor (check out his roles in The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys and The Emperor's Club), but he definitely showed his true ability in this movie. Though this movie was not a mainstream one, it is one you all need to check out at your local art-house theatre (or wait until DVD if you aren't blessed with such a relic).",4,Great indie film,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,1625,"['Genre', 'Indie', 'Drama', 'Mild', 'Dark', 'ComedyGenre', 'Grade', 'AFinal', 'Grade', 'A-This', 'was', 'director', 'Dan', 'Harris', 'first', 'film', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'X-Men', '2', 'writing', 'screenplays', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Ender', 'Game', 'hope', 'near', 'future', 'ventures', 'back', 'world', 'drama', 'how', 'do', 'well', 'would', 'definitely', 'compare', 'film', 'American', 'Beauty', 'just', 'dark', 'subplots', 'running', 'even', 'tad', 'too', 'much', 'melodrama', 'parts', 'film', 'pretty', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'nothing', 'contrived', 'Real', 'American', 'families', 'deal', 'kinds', 'things', 'applaud', 'Dan', 'Harris', 'not', 'caring', 'what', 'conservative', 'America', 'thinks', 'just', 'being', 'honest', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', 'A-', 'was', 'only', 'Harris', 'did', ""n't"", 'explore', 'darkest', 'parts', 'movie', 'presented', 'Much', 'Closer', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'movie', 'explored', 'dark', 'human', 'emotions', 'one', 'really', 'see', 'movie', 'serve', 'purpose', 'acting', 'side', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'was', 'great', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'more', 'just', 'Golden', 'Satellite', 'Award', 'great', 'performance', 'came', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'think', 'great', 'actor', 'check', 'out', 'roles', 'Dangerous', 'Lives', 'Altar', 'Boys', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'definitely', 'showed', 'true', 'ability', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'mainstream', 'one', 'one', 'need', 'check', 'out', 'local', 'art-house', 'theatre', 'wait', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'blessed', 'relic']",N/A

Written and directed by Dan Harris this story is classic theater, weaving comedy and tragedy together so tightly that the climax of the film takes your breath away.The Travis family is an odd bunch: no member is who each appears to be.  Beginning with a suicide of the reluctant 'hero' child swimming champion Matt (Kip Pardue), the father Ben (Jeff Daniels) falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself while the mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) turns to pot and rage and sarcasm, the daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) returns from school repulsed by her family's behavior, and the remaining son Tim (Emile Hirsch) takes the brunt of all of the above by avoiding his classmates, girlfriend, and teams with his neighbor Kyle (Ryan Donowho) to leap into drugs and sexual experimentation.  Throughout the film Tim tries to hide bruises on his body that have a secret all their own yet lead his girlfriend to feel rejection, his mother to rage against the trailer park trash bully she believes is the cause, and finally open the window to the deep scars this family has suffered for years.  Secrets and lies, here, and the resolution of them is painfully dramatic.This may be Sigourney Weaver's finest role, although Emile Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho, and Kip Pardue (despite the brevity of his role) all contribute top-notch performances.  The story begins slowly and seems to meander and that fact may lose some viewers' attention, but stay with this little powerhouse film and the impact of the work will stun you.  Highly Recommended.

633669,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00005JNPY,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[8, 17]","""Imaginary Heroes"" delivers Big Time on teen suicide, teen sex (heterosexual & homosexual), dysfunctional family life, neurotic neighbors, depression, rage, extreme mid-life crises, mega-drug use, (or is it just me?), and alcohol abuse by both teens and adults, violence, adultery, skeletons in every closet, along with some wit, (quirky humor?), cool music and surface sunshine to compensate for the darkness of life in 21st century suburbia. Let me tell you, whatever humor this movie contains does not lighten up the storyline one bit! But, hey...what do I know? I live in the Big Apple, raised my daughter here and consider myself a progressive. Yet with all the big city ""depravity,"" I never saw or experienced anything like this morose display of self-indulgent despair. And no one seeks help! Are there no shrinks in suburbia? I will say that the cast is superb, as is the acting. Sigourney Weaver, as usual, shines.Sigourney plays Sandy Travis, a 40ish housewife, with no obvious hobbies, volunteer work, or career history. What does she do with her time? She has 3 almost grown children. The oldest son, Matt, (Kip Pardue), commits suicide during the 1st five minutes of the film. He was a world-class swimmer who hated the sport. His father, (Jeff Daniels), pushed him beyond reason to go for the gold at the Olympics, and the kid had enough. One also wonders what kind of hang-ups he acquired growing up in the amazing Travis household. I find it incredible that Sandy never intervened on behalf of her son. Perhaps she didn't pick up on his hatred for swimming, nor his intense dislike for all the attention he received because of his stardom. Is this possible? Younger son and brother Tim, (Emile Hirsch, who gives a superb performance), was aware of his brother's anger and pain, but did nothing - said nothing. At least there is an explanation for this behavior, which is revealed at the movie's conclusion. Daughter Penny, (Michelle Williams), is away at college and stays away as much as possible. I don't blame her. She seems oblivious to what's going on at home, and she parties, does drugs and drinks when she is around.Most of the film deals with the ways egocentric mom, dad and big sis cope with their grief and guilt. No one really pays attention to the difficulties Tim is experiencing. Sandy is into Sandy, smoking marijuana to kill the pain. (How she attempts to acquire her stash is also not believable). And Dad is so far removed from his family's life that he sometimes sleeps in the car! He demands that a place be set at the dinner table every evening, with a full plate of food, for his absent son. He continously pops a variety of pills - that's his escape. ""People are so stupid I can't bear to live around them anymore,"" Sandy tells Tim - just what he needs to hear after his brother shot himself for possessing similar sentiments. There is little compassion, tenderness, empathy or dignity here, with the exception of a few scenes between Sandy and her youngest son, whom she considers a soul mate - part of the problem.Twenty-five year-old writer/director Dan Harris fails to move me with all this contrived angst. One or two tragedies would have sufficed. Certainly Matt's suicide is devastating enough to make a convincing drama. The movie's excesses, in fact, diminish Matthew's death. I also had a feeling of deja vu. Didn't I see something similar, and far superior to ""Imaginary Heroes"" in ""Ordinary People,"" and ""The Ice Storm?"" Many of this movie's convoluted situations are just not credible. And the revelations at the end of the film are totally inappropriate given the recent tragedy. I wondered after the first hour how many more crises Harris would add. He is quite young and obviously talented. Hopefully his next effort will be an improvement. As I wrote, the performances are excellent.

633670,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNPY,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 7]","The dysfunctional family displays a number of different traits, however, the major key factor in a dysfunctional family is abuse.  When people hear the word abuse they either think of physical, sexual, and sometimes even emotional abuse.  The abuse can also come in form of monetary control, where the parent demands that the child conform to the rules set for the child.  The rules within a dysfunctional family can present a strong authoritarian character, which does not provide much room for error, or flexibility.  It is also common that these families with a dysfunctional pattern to treat the children like possessions that should adhere to and provide emotional and physical support to the parents.  However, one of the abuses that frequently seems to slip the mind of people is neglect, as parents should also provide an emotionally and physically safe environment for the child where the child can learn self-worth.  Imaginary Heroes captures one dysfunctional family where neglect and subtle emotional abuse culminates in a tragic family disaster.The opening of Imaginary Heroes displays Matt Travis (Kip Pardue) preparing for the start in a swim event while the voice of his little brother Tim (Emile Hirsch) says, ""Matt Travis was a great simmer.""  The camera continues to display Matt competing with the voiceover of Tim informing the audience that his brother's greatness in swimming was unmatched to any skill.  Everywhere where Matt went to compete from the age of 10 to 20 his dad, Ben (Jeff Daniels), kept pushing him to do better and it proved to be successful, as he become a local legend.  Yet, Matt hated the attention he received, but he hated swimming more than anything on earth.  Consequently, Matt committed suicide and Tim is the one who finds his dead brother.The outwardly perfect family had a nice house and all the commodities for a life without problems.  Understandably, the death of Matt places the family in deep grief, but the absence of Matt also brings out the family issues into the open.  The story begins with Matt's suicide, but the father refuses to accept the son's death and demands that everyone at home continue to live as if Matt was still alive.  Sandy (Sigourney Weaver), Tim's mother, is even told to continue to cook and serve food for Matt.  Tim withdraws from the family life when his father only seems to be capable of insulting him in various ways while all his friends display sympathy for him regarding his dead brother.  All of the turmoil after Matt's death upsets Tim, and he seeks various ways of escaping such as drugs and comfort from his girlfriend, as his parents are not available for him.Imaginary Heroes follows the Travis family for a whole year, as the family's dysfunctional development intensifies over this time.  The parental neglect of Tim is obvious.  He does not want to entrust his girlfriend who loves him, as he does not reciprocate her feelings.  His sister Penny (Michelle Williams) tries to be there for him, but she is in college and only returns on holidays.  The only person that seems to be there for Tim is his neighbor and best friend Kyle (Ryan Donowho), and his answer to loneliness and abandonment is getting high.  There is a hilarious scene where he is working while being high on ecstasy.  Drugs are a prevalent part of the film, as the characters either self-medicate with various recreational drugs, or receive prescriptions by doctors to help people them with their unhappiness.  Nonetheless, Kyle does not judge him, but he does not know everything either.  Thus, Tim only entrusts his diary where he often writes down how he feels, which will provide an interesting conclusion to the film.What makes Imaginary Heroes so good, is the approach to the problem.  Dan Harris, who still has not turned 30 both wrote and directed the film, which displays a great deal of understanding of this issue, as he unveils all angles of the problems within the family.  It is apparent that open and honest communication could only solve their problems, where all involved have an equal right in say.  Maybe it is Harris' youthful perspective that makes the film feel authentic, and not overly analytical, which only helps the story move along into a terrific cinematic experience.  One cannot forget to mention the excellent cast with two brilliant performances by both Emile Hirsch and Sigourney Weaver.  Some might have seen Sigourney Weaver in the brilliant Ice Storm (1997), which provides a similar experience, but over a shorter time frame.  After having seen Imaginary Heroes, one cannot help to become very curious about Harris' four future projects including Superman Returns.  I will bet on that he will have a several interesting projects that will continue to keep the audience both pondering and entertained.",5,Poignant Story of Loss in Dysfunctional Family...,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,4808,"['dysfunctional', 'family', 'number', 'different', 'traits', 'however', 'major', 'key', 'factor', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'abuse', 'When', 'people', 'hear', 'word', 'think', 'physical', 'sexual', 'sometimes', 'even', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'abuse', 'can', 'also', 'come', 'form', 'monetary', 'control', 'where', 'parent', 'child', 'conform', 'rules', 'set', 'child', 'rules', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'can', 'present', 'strong', 'authoritarian', 'character', 'not', 'provide', 'much', 'room', 'error', 'flexibility', 'also', 'common', 'families', 'dysfunctional', 'pattern', 'treat', 'children', 'possessions', 'should', 'adhere', 'provide', 'emotional', 'physical', 'support', 'parents', 'However', 'one', 'abuses', 'frequently', 'slip', 'mind', 'people', 'neglect', 'parents', 'should', 'also', 'provide', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'safe', 'environment', 'child', 'where', 'child', 'can', 'learn', 'self-worth', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'one', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'where', 'neglect', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'culminates', 'tragic', 'family', 'disaster.The', 'opening', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'displays', 'Matt', 'Travis', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'preparing', 'start', 'swim', 'event', 'voice', 'little', 'brother', 'Tim', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Matt', 'Travis', 'was', 'great', 'simmer', 'camera', 'display', 'Matt', 'competing', 'voiceover', 'Tim', 'informing', 'audience', 'brother', 'greatness', 'swimming', 'was', 'unmatched', 'skill', 'Everywhere', 'where', 'Matt', 'went', 'compete', 'age', '10', '20', 'dad', 'Ben', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'kept', 'pushing', 'do', 'better', 'proved', 'be', 'successful', 'local', 'legend', 'Matt', 'hated', 'attention', 'received', 'hated', 'swimming', 'more', 'anything', 'earth', 'Consequently', 'Matt', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Tim', 'one', 'who', 'dead', 'brother.The', 'outwardly', 'perfect', 'family', 'had', 'nice', 'house', 'commodities', 'life', 'problems', 'Understandably', 'death', 'Matt', 'family', 'deep', 'grief', 'absence', 'Matt', 'also', 'out', 'family', 'issues', 'open', 'story', 'Matt', 'suicide', 'father', 'accept', 'son', 'death', 'demands', 'everyone', 'home', 'continue', 'live', 'Matt', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'Sandy', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Tim', 'mother', 'even', 'told', 'continue', 'cook', 'serve', 'food', 'Matt', 'Tim', 'withdraws', 'family', 'life', 'when', 'father', 'only', 'be', 'capable', 'insulting', 'various', 'ways', 'friends', 'display', 'sympathy', 'regarding', 'dead', 'brother', 'turmoil', 'Matt', 'death', 'upsets', 'Tim', 'various', 'ways', 'escaping', 'such', 'drugs', 'comfort', 'girlfriend', 'parents', 'are', 'not', 'available', 'him.Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'Travis', 'family', 'whole', 'year', 'family', 'dysfunctional', 'development', 'intensifies', 'time', 'parental', 'neglect', 'Tim', 'obvious', 'not', 'want', 'entrust', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'not', 'reciprocate', 'feelings', 'sister', 'Penny', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'be', 'there', 'college', 'only', 'returns', 'holidays', 'only', 'person', 'be', 'there', 'Tim', 'neighbor', 'best', 'friend', 'Kyle', 'Ryan', 'Donowho', 'answer', 'loneliness', 'abandonment', 'getting', 'high', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'where', 'working', 'being', 'high', 'ecstasy', 'Drugs', 'are', 'prevalent', 'part', 'film', 'characters', 'self-medicate', 'various', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'receive', 'prescriptions', 'doctors', 'help', 'people', 'unhappiness', 'Nonetheless', 'Kyle', 'not', 'judge', 'not', 'know', 'everything', 'either', 'Thus', 'Tim', 'only', 'diary', 'where', 'often', 'down', 'how', 'will', 'provide', 'interesting', 'conclusion', 'film.What', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'so', 'good', 'approach', 'problem', 'Dan', 'Harris', 'who', 'still', 'not', 'turned', '30', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'understanding', 'issue', 'angles', 'problems', 'family', 'apparent', 'open', 'honest', 'communication', 'could', 'only', 'solve', 'problems', 'where', 'involved', 'have', 'equal', 'right', 'say', 'Maybe', 'Harris', 'youthful', 'perspective', 'film', 'feel', 'authentic', 'not', 'overly', 'analytical', 'only', 'story', 'move', 'along', 'terrific', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'mention', 'excellent', 'cast', 'two', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'brilliant', 'Ice', 'Storm', '1997', 'similar', 'experience', 'shorter', 'time', 'frame', 'having', 'seen', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'very', 'curious', 'Harris', 'four', 'future', 'projects', 'including', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'will', 'bet', 'will', 'have', 'several', 'interesting', 'projects', 'will', 'continue', 'keep', 'audience', 'pondering', 'entertained']",N/A

Imaginary Heroes is a must-see and (in my case) a must-own movie gem.Sigourney Weaver flat-out shines throughout the entire picture as does the rest of the terrific cast including Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch and Michelle Williams.The story? True. There's nothing false about it. Don't mistake this for some horrific Hollywood mess where the characters are wooden, the plot is unrealistic and the acting is unconvincing. No, this is the real deal.There is a website that I like to check out sometimes called Rotten Tomatoes. It's a little place where all the critics like to gather and tear apart movies as they release. They were alot less than kind with Imaginary Heroes. A movie has to be 60% or higher to recieve a fresh label. Heroes recieved a 34%, earning a rotten label. I was in shock. I even read some of the reasons the critics gave. One read ""just too damn depressing."" Here's my response: SHOVE IT. This person must obviously loves all the hollywood trash that takes up 99% of the room on the shelves at the local Hollywood or Blockbuster video. All the trash there today that paints pictures of perfect families, sending out messages that say things will always work out perfectly and everyone always goes home happy in the end. Life is not like that and that is what Imaginary Heroes is trying to say. Don't get me wrong, though. You can watch those other films for pleasure and enjoyment, but don't try and actually believe them. I really don't like critics. Being a critic shouldn't be a job, it should be a hobby.Oh yeah, here's a note to all those who are looking for a good film, but can't find any. I began to realize this after I kept watching more and more films over the years (by the way, I'm 18):MOVIES THAT ARE NOT WIDE-RELEASE FILMS, AND I REPEAT, MOVIES THAT ARE NOT WIDE-RELEASE FILMS USUALLY ARE THE MUCH BETTER FILMS.

633672,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNPY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","The suicide of a child can rock a family to its foundation, and that is what happens to the Travis family in ""Imaginary Heroes.""  The death of Matt Travis (Kip Pardue) happens at the start of the film and his suicide is explained by younger brother, Tim (Emile Hirsch).  Matt was a world class swimmer, heading for the Olympics, whose deep, dark secret is that he hates swimming.  But he is clearly driven by his father, Ben (Jeff Daniels), who is not so egotistical that it does not dawn on him that driving his son may well be the cause of Matt's suicide.  The same thought occurs to Matt's mother, Sandy (Sigourney Weaver), only she is able to articulate that horrific question and her husband is not.  There is an older sister, Penny (Michelle Williams), who is off to college and seems to be safe from incriminations for reasons of distance and/or gender we can only surmise.The Travis family has been pained to the core by Matt's death, and the question in this 2004 film written and directed by Dan Harris (""The Killing of Candice Klein"") is which member of the family will be the next to fall, with the attendant questions being how far and how hard.  It could be Ben, who has withdrawn from the rest of his family while insisting that there still be a place for Matt at the table.  It could be Sandy, who finds comfort in rediscovering the joys of pot smoking, but who has been tempting fate by avoiding doctors for too many years.  The focus of the film is on Tim, who does not want to talk about the bruises on his body and who does not know if he loves his girl friend.  ""Then you don't,"" his mother assures him and while Ben is the driving force that warped the dynamics of this family it is clear that Sandy is the rock underneath it all.That is why my major complaint about this film is that the focus is primarily on Tim when I want it to be on Sandy.  All of the performances are fine, but Weaver's is the best in the film and her character the most compelling (which explains to me why the actress is so prominent on the cover).  The fact that Penny is so well adjusted and that Sandy can talk with such ease to Tim makes you stop and wonder why she did not have the same rapport with Matt, and then you remember that Matt was clearly Ben's son, whether he wanted to be or not. There is something clearly unspoken in this family, and when we get to the point that it finally is spoken a lot of what has happened ends up making a lot more sense.  The revelation might be too little too late, and there is a sense in which it forces the conclusion to the story, but ""Imaginary Heroes"" does end on a grace note that makes for a nice pay off of the manic scribblings in Tim's notebooks.This is one of those films that most people will think runs too long at 112-minutes.  The reason is that Harris is trying to give each of these three survivors enough time on screen that none of them are reduced to minor characters (in contrast to, say, ""Ordinary People"").  I had just watched ""Swimming Upstream"" last week, the Australian movie about Tony Fingleton, a champion backstroke swimmer who was driven by an even more horrific father, so I can see where that would skew my perspective of Ben.  But he really is in third place to Sandy and Tim, and there is actually a why and a wherefore to explain this, so it makes sense.  Still, if this had been Sandy's film there would have been serious talk about Weaver earning an Oscar nomination.",4,Sigourney Weaver shines in this film of a shattered family,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,3449,"['suicide', 'child', 'can', 'rock', 'family', 'foundation', 'what', 'Travis', 'family', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'death', 'Matt', 'Travis', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'start', 'film', 'suicide', 'explained', 'younger', 'brother', 'Tim', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Matt', 'was', 'world', 'class', 'swimmer', 'heading', 'Olympics', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'swimming', 'clearly', 'driven', 'father', 'Ben', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'egotistical', 'not', 'dawn', 'driving', 'son', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'cause', 'Matt', 'suicide', 'same', 'thought', 'Matt', 'mother', 'Sandy', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'only', 'able', 'articulate', 'horrific', 'question', 'husband', 'not', 'older', 'sister', 'Penny', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'college', 'be', 'safe', 'incriminations', 'reasons', 'distance', 'and/or', 'gender', 'can', 'only', 'surmise.The', 'Travis', 'family', 'been', 'pained', 'core', 'Matt', 'death', 'question', '2004', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Dan', 'Harris', 'Killing', 'Candice', 'Klein', 'member', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'fall', 'attendant', 'questions', 'being', 'how', 'far', 'how', 'hard', 'could', 'be', 'Ben', 'who', 'withdrawn', 'rest', 'family', 'insisting', 'still', 'be', 'place', 'Matt', 'table', 'could', 'be', 'Sandy', 'who', 'comfort', 'rediscovering', 'joys', 'pot', 'smoking', 'who', 'been', 'tempting', 'fate', 'avoiding', 'doctors', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'focus', 'film', 'Tim', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'talk', 'bruises', 'body', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'girl', 'friend', 'Then', 'do', ""n't"", 'mother', 'Ben', 'driving', 'force', 'warped', 'dynamics', 'family', 'clear', 'Sandy', 'rock', 'why', 'major', 'complaint', 'film', 'focus', 'primarily', 'Tim', 'when', 'want', 'be', 'Sandy', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'Weaver', 'best', 'film', 'character', 'most', 'compelling', 'why', 'actress', 'so', 'prominent', 'cover', 'fact', 'Penny', 'so', 'well', 'adjusted', 'Sandy', 'can', 'talk', 'such', 'ease', 'Tim', 'stop', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'rapport', 'Matt', 'then', 'remember', 'Matt', 'was', 'clearly', 'Ben', 'son', 'wanted', 'be', 'not', 'something', 'clearly', 'unspoken', 'family', 'when', 'get', 'point', 'finally', 'spoken', 'lot', 'what', 'happened', 'up', 'making', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'revelation', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'sense', 'conclusion', 'story', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'end', 'grace', 'note', 'nice', 'pay', 'manic', 'scribblings', 'Tim', 'notebooks.This', 'one', 'films', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'think', 'runs', 'too', 'long', '112-minutes', 'reason', 'Harris', 'trying', 'give', 'three', 'survivors', 'enough', 'time', 'screen', 'none', 'are', 'reduced', 'minor', 'characters', 'contrast', 'say', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', 'last', 'week', 'Australian', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Fingleton', 'champion', 'backstroke', 'swimmer', 'who', 'was', 'driven', 'even', 'more', 'horrific', 'father', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'would', 'skew', 'perspective', 'Ben', 'really', 'third', 'place', 'Sandy', 'Tim', 'actually', 'why', 'wherefore', 'explain', 'sense', 'Still', 'had', 'been', 'Sandy', 'film', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'talk', 'Weaver', 'earning', 'Oscar', 'nomination']",N/A
633673,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JNPY,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 3]","""Imaginary Heroes"" is an unusual domestic drama that hangs together most of the time.  Jeff Daniels plays Ben Travis, a father whose son embodies his dreams for athletic awards in swimming.  When son Matt decides to shoot himself, it ruins his father's dreams.  Jeff Daniels becomes so depressed that he is almost immobilized.  Sigourney Weaver plays his mischievious wife who tries to bury the blues by smoking illegal substances.  I recently watched Kip Pardue inLoggerheads.  His brief appearance as Matt is impressive.  Emile Hirsch was nominated for Best Actor by the Screen Actors Guild for ""Into the Wild"" last year.  Here, he plays Matt's brother Tim who is not athletic and cannot embody his father's dreams.  Tim's buddy Kyle, played by Ryan Donowho, lives next door.  One night the friends become more than friends, which leads to quite a bit of self-examination on Tim's part.  Michelle Williams who had an Oscar nomination forBrokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)plays sister Penny Travis who pops home from college periodically.  Director Dan Harris seems very young in the DVD extra interviews, but with a vision for this film.

Some people dislike it's slow pace and some seem bothered that it's theme, the disintegrating American family, has been portrayed before by better known and more glamorous films.  That's no surprise.  All of those points are valid to a degree, but they do not take into account the main audience for this movie: actors or lovers of acting.Yes, the pacing is rather slow, yet there are movies that are made where this is intentional.  The end result is that you have no fanfare, no quick plot progressions.  You are just left with the mundane feelings of everyday life.  And really, for most people, isn't that what life is?Yes it's true, suicide is a common theme, and the movie gives away the main plot element right in the beginning, so no spoiler there.  Yet how do people deal with losing a brother, a son, a friend?  Each character's reaction is a testament to great writing and great acting as well.  And it takes great directing to bring those two things together.This movie is hard to watch because it's supposed to be.  While it's not a great ""film-watching"" experience, it is an excellent study of various acting techniques.  Therefore, students of acting or actors will find a lot to admire here.Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Michelle Williams and Emile Hirsh all show tremendous range here, and each does it using very distinct and different techniques.  We have method acting, sense memory, character acting and some plain old amazing acting. Some of those differences are subtle but if you watch this a few times the effect is impressive.Yes, the slow pacing and lack of groundbreaking themes perhaps make this a 3 star movie at best, yet the incredible performances and well written material deserve a 4 star rating.Don't watch this movie with any other movie in mind.  Let this movie stand on it's own.  If you are able to reflect and enjoy studying how actors work, then this movie is for you.  If you're looking for a fun Friday night movie, you may want to check out something else.Enjoy.",4,"Imaginary Heroes - A Movie Of Character Studies, A Movie For Actors",1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,2091,"['Imaginary', 'HeroesIt', 'amazing', 'contrasting', 'reactions', 'movie', 'illicited', 'people', 'dislike', 'slow', 'pace', 'seem', 'bothered', 'theme', 'disintegrating', 'American', 'family', 'been', 'portrayed', 'better', 'known', 'more', 'glamorous', 'films', 'surprise', 'points', 'are', 'valid', 'degree', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'account', 'main', 'audience', 'movie', 'actors', 'lovers', 'acting.Yes', 'pacing', 'rather', 'slow', 'yet', 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'where', 'intentional', 'end', 'result', 'have', 'fanfare', 'quick', 'plot', 'progressions', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'mundane', 'feelings', 'everyday', 'life', 'really', 'most', 'people', ""n't"", 'what', 'life', 'Yes', 'true', 'suicide', 'common', 'theme', 'movie', 'away', 'main', 'plot', 'element', 'right', 'beginning', 'spoiler', 'there', 'how', 'do', 'people', 'deal', 'losing', 'brother', 'son', 'friend', 'character', 'reaction', 'testament', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'directing', 'bring', 'two', 'things', 'together.This', 'movie', 'hard', 'watch', 'supposed', 'be', 'not', 'great', 'film-watching', 'experience', 'excellent', 'study', 'various', 'acting', 'techniques', 'Therefore', 'students', 'acting', 'actors', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'admire', 'here.Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Emile', 'Hirsh', 'show', 'tremendous', 'range', 'here', 'using', 'very', 'distinct', 'different', 'techniques', 'have', 'method', 'acting', 'sense', 'memory', 'character', 'acting', 'plain', 'old', 'amazing', 'acting', 'differences', 'are', 'subtle', 'watch', 'few', 'times', 'effect', 'impressive.Yes', 'slow', 'pacing', 'lack', 'groundbreaking', 'themes', 'perhaps', 'make', '3', 'star', 'movie', 'best', 'yet', 'incredible', 'performances', 'well', 'written', 'material', 'deserve', '4', 'star', 'rating.Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'other', 'movie', 'mind', 'Let', 'movie', 'stand', 'own', 'are', 'able', 'reflect', 'enjoy', 'studying', 'how', 'actors', 'work', 'then', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fun', 'Friday', 'night', 'movie', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'something', 'else.Enjoy']",N/A

633678,A3UZJJ86N23JOZ,B00005JNPY,P. T. J.,"[10, 10]","The words ""suburban family dramady"" sends up red flares in my personal taste for movies.  As a rule, movies dealing solely with a single, suburban household and the various ins and outs, overblown turmoil and melodrama that innevitably surrounds them, almost always fall short of their mark.  Not only are most of these films boring, but in an attempt to build them up to something remotely interesting or meaningful, they're filled with melodramatic subplots involving the kinds of things that seem particularly devastating to suburban families - but hardly anyone else.  In short, it's hard to find a good quality about most of the films in this vein.  ""Imaginary Heroes"" however pulls a one-two punch to the gut, and manages to strike a certain chord, using realism as a strong right-jab, and strong character development as its follow-up left hook.  The single most impressive element of this movie, however, that if for no other reason, makes it worth watching, is the chemistry between Emile Hirsch and Sigourney Weaver, who play mother and son in the film.  For romance films, actors who play lovers occasionally stumble across a counterpart whom they have genuine chemistry, and more often than not, can forge a certain feeling for a person strong enough to carry the film.  This is not a romance movie, nor do these actors play lovers.  These two seemed to have genuinely stumbled upon a rare bond, at least as far as the screen can show.  They genuinely connect in a mother/son sort of way, with an uncanny bond and affection for one another.  Mother's close with their sons - suburban or otherwise - will validate that there is a certain element of unspoken connection between one another.  This is genuinely displayed in this movie, not in a forced kind of way, nor an obvious ploy, but as a real element of the actor's relationship.  Whether this holds true outside the film reel or not, it's enough to penetrate the viewer's initial skepticism and build a powerful involvement with the characters and their outcome.Criticisms have been hurled at this movie.  ""Too many subplots.""  ""Melodramatic elements abound.""  Etc... etc...  I have to say, this is exactly the kind of thing that initially warned me away from this movie - not because I'd heard bad things about the film, but because I hold these criticisms true for every movie along similar plotlines.  I have to say though, ""Imaginary Heroes"" works beautifully, achieiving a sense of art both in movement, and as an end product.  The script is eloquent but real, which is in fact where most of the movie draws its realism from.  Despite what ""Entertainment Weekly"" has to say, ""Imaginary Heroes"" is a movie strongly routed in realism, and powerfully so.  The characters here are real portrayals of real people.  Perhaps a tad to one extreme or the other at times, but they are never overdone nor overplayed.  To those who are worried that too much is tackled in this film - let's look at it objectively.  I won't argue with people who say a lot happens, because it sure does.  It's an onslaught of tension and tragedy, one after the other, but honestly, in the wake of a serious tragedy in any family, in any walk of life, everything that may have been loose at the seams, begins to fall apart.  Bad things often spawn from bad things, because when people fail to cope, they turn to destruction, of self or otherwise, and cause increasing turmoil.  This is beautifully and truthfully exemplified in this film, and manifested superbly in the actors portrayal of their respective characters.  The movie strikes close to home, no matter where you're from, and uses powerful character development and inter-character connections, put to the test and built stronger to hit home with the viewer.  An overlooked film, lost in the gray area between art-film reviewers (looking for something more extreme or artsy,) and the mainstream critics (looking for something glossier or more flambuoyant,) ""Imaginary Heroes,"" it's eloquent characters and poignant story seems doomed not to be truly recognized, but lends it an unusual power: it makes it a rare gem, a diamond in the rough, and gives it an uncanny personal impact with the viewer, similar to the aftermath of an intimate one-on-one conversation.",5,"Rare for its genre- effecting, moving, and involved",1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,4263,"['words', 'suburban', 'family', 'dramady', 'up', 'red', 'flares', 'personal', 'taste', 'movies', 'rule', 'movies', 'dealing', 'solely', 'single', 'suburban', 'household', 'various', 'ins', 'outs', 'overblown', 'turmoil', 'melodrama', 'innevitably', 'almost', 'always', 'fall', 'short', 'mark', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'most', 'films', 'boring', 'attempt', 'build', 'up', 'something', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'meaningful', ""'re"", 'filled', 'melodramatic', 'subplots', 'involving', 'kinds', 'things', 'seem', 'particularly', 'devastating', 'suburban', 'families', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'else', 'short', 'hard', 'find', 'good', 'quality', 'most', 'films', 'vein', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'however', 'one-two', 'punch', 'gut', 'strike', 'certain', 'chord', 'using', 'realism', 'strong', 'right-jab', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'follow-up', 'left', 'hook', 'single', 'most', 'impressive', 'element', 'movie', 'however', 'other', 'reason', 'worth', 'watching', 'chemistry', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'who', 'play', 'mother', 'son', 'film', 'romance', 'films', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'lovers', 'occasionally', 'stumble', 'counterpart', 'whom', 'have', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'can', 'forge', 'certain', 'feeling', 'person', 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'not', 'romance', 'movie', 'do', 'actors', 'play', 'lovers', 'two', 'seemed', 'have', 'genuinely', 'stumbled', 'rare', 'bond', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'screen', 'can', 'show', 'genuinely', 'connect', 'mother/son', 'sort', 'way', 'uncanny', 'bond', 'affection', 'one', 'Mother', 'close', 'sons', 'suburban', 'otherwise', 'will', 'validate', 'certain', 'element', 'unspoken', 'connection', 'one', 'genuinely', 'displayed', 'movie', 'not', 'forced', 'kind', 'way', 'obvious', 'ploy', 'real', 'element', 'actor', 'relationship', 'true', 'film', 'reel', 'not', 'enough', 'penetrate', 'viewer', 'initial', 'skepticism', 'build', 'powerful', 'involvement', 'characters', 'outcome.Criticisms', 'have', 'been', 'hurled', 'movie', 'Too', 'many', 'subplots', 'Melodramatic', 'elements', 'abound', 'Etc', 'etc', 'have', 'say', 'exactly', 'kind', 'thing', 'initially', 'warned', 'away', 'movie', 'not', ""'d"", 'heard', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'hold', 'criticisms', 'true', 'movie', 'similar', 'plotlines', 'have', 'say', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'beautifully', 'achieiving', 'sense', 'art', 'movement', 'end', 'product', 'script', 'eloquent', 'real', 'fact', 'where', 'most', 'movie', 'realism', 'what', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'say', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'movie', 'strongly', 'routed', 'realism', 'powerfully', 'so', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'real', 'portrayals', 'real', 'people', 'Perhaps', 'tad', 'one', 'extreme', 'other', 'times', 'are', 'never', 'overdone', 'overplayed', 'who', 'are', 'worried', 'too', 'much', 'tackled', 'film', 'let', 'look', 'objectively', 'wo', ""n't"", 'argue', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'lot', 'sure', 'onslaught', 'tension', 'tragedy', 'one', 'other', 'honestly', 'wake', 'serious', 'tragedy', 'family', 'walk', 'life', 'everything', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'loose', 'seams', 'fall', 'apart', 'Bad', 'things', 'often', 'spawn', 'bad', 'things', 'when', 'people', 'fail', 'cope', 'turn', 'destruction', 'self', 'otherwise', 'cause', 'increasing', 'turmoil', 'beautifully', 'truthfully', 'exemplified', 'film', 'manifested', 'superbly', 'actors', 'portrayal', 'respective', 'characters', 'movie', 'close', 'home', 'matter', 'where', ""'re"", 'powerful', 'character', 'development', 'inter-character', 'connections', 'put', 'test', 'built', 'stronger', 'hit', 'home', 'viewer', 'overlooked', 'film', 'lost', 'gray', 'area', 'art-film', 'reviewers', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'extreme', 'artsy', 'mainstream', 'critics', 'looking', 'something', 'glossier', 'more', 'flambuoyant', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'eloquent', 'characters', 'poignant', 'story', 'doomed', 'not', 'be', 'truly', 'recognized', 'unusual', 'power', 'rare', 'gem', 'diamond', 'rough', 'uncanny', 'personal', 'impact', 'viewer', 'similar', 'aftermath', 'intimate', 'one-on-one', 'conversation']",N/A

633681,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNPY,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 10]","***1/2It occurred to me while watching ""Imaginary Heroes"" that any screenwriter attempting to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing off a kid or two in the opening reel as a way of getting his characters to open up and reveal themselves.  There must be something to this storyline, for it seems as if every other family drama that comes down the pike uses this device in one form or another (""Paradise"" and ""Moonlight Mile"" are just two of the more recent examples that spring immediately to mind, although one could reach back to a golden oldie like ""Who`s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" to make the point as well).  It's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore.  Far from it.  It's just that, like any topic, it can be so overused that it becomes just another movie clich&eacute;, a convenient bit of narrative shorthand to get the ball rolling and to give the characters something to grapple with for the remainder of the time we get to spend with them.The latest such work is ""Imaginary Heroes,"" a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and, perhaps, best known examples of the ""family coping with the death of a child"" genre, the Academy Award winning ""Ordinary People.""  Like the characters in that earlier film, the Travises seem, on the surface, to be the ideal suburban family, until, one fateful day, their oldest son, Matt, who is the ""golden boy"" athlete and, thus, the apple of his father's eye, kills himself with no explanation (one minor difference is that the son in ""Ordinary People"" dies as a result of an accident, not a suicide).  It is Matt's younger brother, Tim, who winds up finding the body, and who assumes the role of protagonist in the film.  Each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way.  Matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, becomes more and more estranged from the father who has virtually ignored him all his life and begins to turn to drugs for surcease.  Ben, the father, becomes swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt, turning away from both his job and his family.  His wife, Sandy, is the most complex character in the film, a free-spirited child of the `60's who feels oddly adrift in the role of mother and wife as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbia.  She spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her pot-smoking past.As written and directed by Dan Harris, ""Imaginary Heroes"" emerges as a wildly uneven film.  For every scene that feels real and authentic, there is another that comes across as arbitrary and inauthentic.  One sometimes has the sense that Harris would like to cram every possible life situation he can think of into his screenplay, an admirable goal, perhaps, but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process.  Instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their plight, we often find ourselves thinking, ""Oh, come now...what next?""  For teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot-button topics covered in this film; the screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illness, even inadvertent gay incest.  It is this ""everything but the kitchen sink"" mentality in the writing that robs the movie of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care.That is not to say that ""Imaginary Heroes"" is a bad or unrewarding film.  Much of what it has to say about familial relationships and values in the 21st Century is insightful, original, pointed and profound.  Prime credit for its success goes to the actors, Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who deliver incisive, sensitive performances in their respective roles.  It is they who triumph over the narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts.

Cameron,"[11, 11]","IMAGINARY HEROES plays a faded concept very well, your basic ""quiet suburban family starts to unravel and buried secrets come to light"" plot (AMERICAN BEAUTY, anyone?). Key players Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsch drag you by the hand through a story about suicide, betrayal, and love as it hides behind the prim lawns and clean windows of the two-story houses in America. You're probably getting bored already, but the story isn't what's captivating about this movie - it's the way the characters are drawn, how they connect with each other and the strong emotions they all have inside them.When swimmer Matt Travis (Kip Pardue, who has little screen time but still manages to make an impact) shoots himself, the entire Travis family begins to disintegrate into its parts - emotionally detached office dad (Jeff Daniels), bored housewife experimenting with pot, the remaining son (around whom the story is centered), hiding some secrets about the late brother - who in his death is now exalted within the family, even so much that Jeff Daniels's character insists they set out a plate of dinner for him every night - and the independent college daughter (Michelle Williams). Sigourney Weaver's Sandy is battled against next-door-neighbor housewife Marge in a sixteen-year-old grudge that is important to the plot, though Marge's delinquent drug-running son Kyle bridges the enmity as the best friend of Sandy's son Tim.The story mostly follows Tim's exploits as he tries new things to deal with his brother's death, to ignore the things his brother did to him, through casual drugs, a pushy girlfriend, and a brief, ecstasy-induced one night stand with best friend Kyle. When Sandy drops a bomb of a revelation on his head towards the end of the movie, Tim finally manages to confront the deep-seated resentment he feels for his dad and his brother, which brings the movie to a satisfying conclusion after a lot of tension and confusion.It's worth a watch, at least once - and it throws a monkey wrench in the cogs of the suburban profile a few times, giving the viewer a few interesting surprises to digest - but it isn't going on my favorites list, it just isn't original enough.",4,"Uh-oh, something is amiss in suburbia - again",1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,2183,"['IMAGINARY', 'HEROES', 'faded', 'concept', 'very', 'well', 'basic', 'quiet', 'suburban', 'family', 'unravel', 'buried', 'secrets', 'come', 'light', 'plot', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'anyone', 'Key', 'players', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'drag', 'hand', 'story', 'suicide', 'betrayal', 'love', 'prim', 'lawns', 'clean', 'windows', 'two-story', 'houses', 'America', ""'re"", 'probably', 'getting', 'bored', 'already', 'story', ""n't"", 'what', 'captivating', 'movie', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'how', 'connect', 'other', 'strong', 'emotions', 'have', 'inside', 'them.When', 'swimmer', 'Matt', 'Travis', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'who', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'still', 'make', 'impact', 'entire', 'Travis', 'family', 'disintegrate', 'parts', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'office', 'dad', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'bored', 'housewife', 'experimenting', 'pot', 'remaining', 'son', 'whom', 'story', 'centered', 'hiding', 'secrets', 'late', 'brother', 'who', 'death', 'now', 'exalted', 'family', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'character', 'set', 'out', 'plate', 'dinner', 'night', 'independent', 'college', 'daughter', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Sandy', 'battled', 'next-door-neighbor', 'housewife', 'Marge', 'sixteen-year-old', 'grudge', 'important', 'plot', 'Marge', 'delinquent', 'drug-running', 'son', 'Kyle', 'enmity', 'best', 'friend', 'Sandy', 'son', 'Tim.The', 'story', 'mostly', 'Tim', 'exploits', 'new', 'things', 'deal', 'brother', 'death', 'ignore', 'things', 'brother', 'did', 'casual', 'drugs', 'pushy', 'girlfriend', 'brief', 'ecstasy-induced', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'best', 'friend', 'Kyle', 'When', 'Sandy', 'bomb', 'revelation', 'head', 'end', 'movie', 'Tim', 'finally', 'confront', 'deep-seated', 'resentment', 'dad', 'brother', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'lot', 'tension', 'confusion.It', 'worth', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'cogs', 'suburban', 'profile', 'few', 'times', 'giving', 'viewer', 'few', 'interesting', 'surprises', 'digest', ""n't"", 'going', 'favorites', 'list', 'just', ""n't"", 'original', 'enough']",N/A

In this story, we have the parents, the two brothers, the sister, and a big secret. Everyone knows that one of the boys committed suicide because of his good looks, fame, athletic disposition (more specifically a swimming champion), and having everything else a middle upper class suburban family has: money and a comfortable life. Nevertheless, inexplicably, he hated it all and kills himself.Obviously, the entire family is devastated by the tragedy of his untimely death and try their best to cope with it each in their own way. I won't tell you ""the secret"" because it will be a spoiler and ruin your own experience in watching this movie. Yes, I highly recommend that you do your best to watch this movie.The plot is cleverly devised with an exceptional acting and script, and by my own personal background and opinion, based on real life. How many families out there, I wonder, share a similar experience?The movie ""Imaginary Heroes"" plays to Aristotle's precept about a tragedy.

She's been one of my favorite actresses for twenty-five years and has always delivered.IMAGINARY HEROES is a good movie about a family falling apart and trying to put itself back together, but I wouldn't say it's a great one.  It keeps moving and the performances are well done, but overall I think the film lacked focus.  There's suicide, drugs, bullies, affairs, family secrets, alcohol, hospitals, gay confusion.AMERICAN BEAUTY appears to be the one movie about the unraveling of the American family that all these films are compared to.  A recent Premiere magazine article also picked it as one of the most overrated films of all time.  I enjoyed most of it but, if you remember much about the time it came out, it was wildly overpraised (Kevin Spacey really did make a name for himself with that one, though).I caught a big chunk of THE ICE STORM (also with Sigourney) and also wondered if too much was being made of that one as well.Actually, IMAGINARY HEROES plays like a blend of two other movies: it has the drama and seriousness of 1980's ORDINARY PEOPLE and the humor of the more recent THE SQUID AND THE WHALE (also with Jeff Daniels, who was outstanding in that one).If you haven't seen either one of those, definitely check them out.",3,Piling On the American Family,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1321,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'so', 'have', 'nothing', 'praise', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'always', 'delivered.IMAGINARY', 'HEROES', 'good', 'movie', 'family', 'falling', 'apart', 'trying', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'great', 'one', 'moving', 'performances', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'overall', 'think', 'film', 'lacked', 'focus', 'suicide', 'drugs', 'bullies', 'affairs', 'family', 'secrets', 'alcohol', 'hospitals', 'gay', 'confusion.AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'be', 'one', 'movie', 'unraveling', 'American', 'family', 'films', 'are', 'compared', 'recent', 'Premiere', 'magazine', 'article', 'also', 'picked', 'one', 'most', 'overrated', 'films', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'remember', 'much', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'wildly', 'overpraised', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'really', 'did', 'make', 'name', 'one', 'though', '.I', 'caught', 'big', 'chunk', 'THE', 'ICE', 'STORM', 'also', 'Sigourney', 'also', 'wondered', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'one', 'well.Actually', 'IMAGINARY', 'HEROES', 'blend', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'drama', 'seriousness', '1980', 'ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'humor', 'more', 'recent', 'THE', 'SQUID', 'AND', 'THE', 'WHALE', 'also', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'who', 'was', 'outstanding', 'one', '.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'definitely', 'check', 'out']",N/A
633685,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00005JNPY,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[5, 5]","Imaginary Heroes is a variation of movies like The Door In The Floor, American Beauty, Ordinary People, and In The Bedroom. It excels as a dark dramedy, because it's full of wit, satire, and moving. In this fairly low-budget film, Sigourney Weaver certainly struck gold, because it's a star showcase role for her, and it's very different from most of her previous works. Her character is the center piece, and she gets to endure quite an emotional rollercoaster ride.This film deals with suicide, high school bully, isolation, infidelity, sex, drugs, and family ties. In a way, it can be looked at as a coming of age movie as well. I really didn't find this film to be as depressing as I had imagined, and it was actually a very entertaining and heartfelt experience.Sandy Travis(Sigourney Weaver) is a ""wild cat"" kind of woman, because she's fearless and fierce, very outspoken, and she never goes to see a doctor, because she thinks she's strong. When her older son committed suicide, she started to unravel, and her husband Ben(Jeff Daniel) started to isolate from the family while the second son Tim(Emile Hirsch) started to do drugs, drink, party, and gets bullied at school by a trailer park junkie. All alone at home, Sandy found some of Tim's hidden marajuana and she gets high on it while being watched by her neighbours. She loved ""the good stuff"" so much that she went to a junkie store to buy more of it, ane ended up getting arrested by the cops. When she realized that Tim had been bullied, she instantly went to the bullier's trailer and gave the kid one hell of a lecture session.The Travis family has other secrets and lies that haven't been laid out on the table, and it was upto the parents to come together and face the real issues before the family completely falls apart.Emile Hirsch held his own opposite two great veteran actors, and he did a great job at portraying his role, since it's a very complex one to tackle. Jeff Daniel has less screentime, and his character has a few touching moments near the end of the film. There was plenty opportunity for Weaver to display a wide range of emotions in this film, since her character had to go from sad to mad, and crazy to mellow. Her performance is truly captivating, because she was funny and touching throughout the film.",4,The Chaotic Times of a Traumatized Dysfunctional Family.,1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,2297,"['Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'variation', 'movies', 'Door', 'Floor', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Bedroom', 'dark', 'dramedy', 'full', 'wit', 'satire', 'moving', 'fairly', 'low-budget', 'film', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'certainly', 'struck', 'gold', 'star', 'showcase', 'role', 'very', 'different', 'most', 'previous', 'works', 'character', 'center', 'piece', 'endure', 'quite', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'ride.This', 'film', 'deals', 'suicide', 'high', 'school', 'bully', 'isolation', 'infidelity', 'sex', 'drugs', 'family', 'ties', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'looked', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'be', 'as', 'depressing', 'had', 'imagined', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'entertaining', 'heartfelt', 'experience.Sandy', 'Travis', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'wild', 'cat', 'kind', 'woman', 'fearless', 'fierce', 'very', 'outspoken', 'never', 'see', 'doctor', 'strong', 'When', 'older', 'son', 'committed', 'suicide', 'started', 'unravel', 'husband', 'Ben', 'Jeff', 'Daniel', 'started', 'isolate', 'family', 'second', 'son', 'Tim', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'started', 'do', 'drugs', 'drink', 'party', 'bullied', 'school', 'trailer', 'park', 'junkie', 'alone', 'home', 'Sandy', 'found', 'Tim', 'hidden', 'marajuana', 'high', 'being', 'watched', 'neighbours', 'loved', 'good', 'stuff', 'so', 'much', 'went', 'junkie', 'store', 'buy', 'more', 'ane', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'arrested', 'cops', 'When', 'realized', 'Tim', 'had', 'been', 'bullied', 'instantly', 'went', 'bullier', 'trailer', 'gave', 'kid', 'one', 'hell', 'lecture', 'session.The', 'Travis', 'family', 'other', 'secrets', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'laid', 'out', 'table', 'was', 'upto', 'parents', 'come', 'together', 'face', 'real', 'issues', 'family', 'completely', 'apart.Emile', 'Hirsch', 'held', 'own', 'opposite', 'two', 'great', 'veteran', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'role', 'very', 'complex', 'one', 'tackle', 'Jeff', 'Daniel', 'less', 'screentime', 'character', 'few', 'touching', 'moments', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'Weaver', 'display', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'film', 'character', 'had', 'go', 'sad', 'mad', 'crazy', 'mellow', 'performance', 'truly', 'captivating', 'was', 'funny', 'touching', 'film']",N/A
