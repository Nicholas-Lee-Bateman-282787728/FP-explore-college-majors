706468,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0000694WG,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[3, 4]","Audiences' fascination with the occult, along with relaxed production codes, led to a slew of Satanic themed films produced in the late 1960s thru the 1970s, including such movies as Rosemary's Baby (1968), Satan's Skin (1971) aka The Blood on Satan's Claw, The Exorcist (1973), Race with the Devil (1975), The Devil's Rain (1975), The Omen (1976), and this early entry titled The Brotherhood of Satan (1971), featuring L.Q. Jones (Major Dundee, Hang 'Em High, The Wild Bunch), who shared writing and producing credits.  Directed by Bernard McEveety, who worked on any number of television series including ""Rawhide"", ""Branded"", and ""Hawaii Five-O"" to name a few, the film also features Strother Martin (Cool Hand Luke, The Wild Bunch, Slap Shot), Alvy Moore (""Green Acres""), who co-produced with Jones, Charles Bateman (""Manhunt""), Ahna Capri (The Girls on the Beach), Charles Robinson (Sugar Hill), and Geri Reischl (I Dismember Mama), probably best known for replacing Eve Plumb as her character Jan Brady on the spin-off series ""The Brady Bunch Hour"" (1977).As the film begins we witness (sort of) a family in a car being crushed by a tank, followed by a children's birthday party.  After this we see three people, a man, woman, and a little girl, having a picnic, one that's effectively spoiled once it starts raining (I don't know what they're freaking out about, especially since they're all wearing bathing suits).  Anyway, the man, named Ben (Bateman), his daughter K.T. (Reischl), and his girlfriend Nicky (Capri), whose got some of the biggest fake eyelashes I've ever seen, make a beeline for the car leading to a ridiculously lengthy driving sequence.  As the trio approaches a nearby town, they see the crushed car from the beginning of the film (and its bloody contents), rush into town for help, only to find much craziness (the townsfolk don't seem all that receptive to outsiders).  They take off, and soon after Ben crashes the car, forcing the trio to hoof it back to Nuttyville, only to discover some nastiness in the form of a pair of recently murdered people in a farmhouse.  Ben eventually finds help in the form of the local sheriff (Jones) and his goober deputy Tobey (Moore) and discovers the town is essentially cut off, meaning few get in, and no one gets out (alive, that is).  As the film progresses we learn the town has, in fact, been invaded by a coven of elderly witches with some sort of agenda that involves killing parents and stealing children...for what purpose?  Well, you'll just have to watch to find that out.  Anyway, some more children are taken (including K.T.), the witches deal with one of their own who has strayed (seems the `Master' isn't very forgiving...go figure), and those not yet dead by some odd fashion struggle to comprehend just what exactly is going on...things eventually come to a head as the witches perform a black mass ceremony as Ben, Nicky, the sheriff, Tobey, and the local minister begin to unravel the sinister plot which has taken hold of the small town.While I did enjoy this film, it does have a few serious flaws, the main one being for the first twenty minutes or so there doesn't seem to be much of a story as we spend the time witnessing a series of seemingly unrelated events (I've watched this film twice now, and it makes a hell of a lot more sense the 2nd time around).  Things do clear up at some later point in the movie, but by that time I suspect a number of viewers will have probably lost some amount of interest.  Another aspect I thought lacking was the presence of a true lead character.  I thought the character of Ben was meant to fill this position, but he never really stepped up as either Charles Bateman just wasn't leading man material, or the role wasn't written in such a way to make his character stand out (I'm leaning more towards the latter).  As a result, we're left to glom onto the various recognizable performers, namely Jones, Martin, and Moore, to fill the void, which they do somewhat, but it just felt odd given they were all supporting characters (I will say this movie's worth seeing for Strother Martin's over the top performance).  About a third of the way through the film I figured out most of what was going on (the proverbial beans are spilt) in terms of the children, so it was kind of downhill after that point as there weren't any real shocking surprises left.  I would have preferred the story to have been structured slightly differently as to have saved some of the juice for the end, but there you go (the ending is of the downbeat type as was common throughout the late 1960s into the 1970s)...there were some interesting attempts at the surreal, one of which included a children's birthday party with a Satanic twist (I've never seen a cake with black frosting before...it doesn't look all that tasty), some of which worked, some of which didn't, but all were entertaining regardless.  There are some uneasy sequences (the use of the children's toys as tools of murder, the various rituals, the robed acolytes, etc.) that defiantly added a creepy, sinister, and slightly funky tone to the film, but given the viewer has to sort of fill gaps numerous times throughout the film, any momentum derived from these parts sort of dribbles away.  There was a good amount of violence in the film, but much of it isn't shown, probably due to budgetary constraints.  I did feel there was a real effort put forth by most involved in the film, and while the end product might be lacking, I still found it entertaining and worth a look, especially if you enjoy oddball, offbeat, unconventional horror features from the 1970s (I know I do).The picture quality on this DVD release, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks surprisingly sharp and clean, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono, comes through very well.  As far as extras, there's not a lot except for subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Thai, along with a few trailers including a Creature Features promo, Hollow Man (2000), and The Craft (1996).Cookieman108",3,"""Degenerate creature...weakling soul...is this the result of our master's teaching?

Things are not right here and as the story progresses you find out why. No one else has been able to either leave or enter the town, and a bunch of kids have gone missing. I won't divulge any spoilers here so let's leave it at that.This movie gets your curiosity up right from the get go.

It's very tight with no real filler added. There is also outstanding use of leitmotif. Tiny things repeat throughout but often with subtle changes.This movie has more going for it than most in this genre. The main sufferings are due mostly to budget.

This strange outing has a suspenseful, creepy plot without the gratuitous gore, foul language and sex that plagues today's theatres.  Think ""Village of the Damned"" meets ""Rosemary's Baby.""  Instead of aliens, it is a coven of Satan worshippers that are terrorizing a small, southwestern town.  For three days, it has been isolated from the rest of the world.  No one has been able to get in or out.  It's like an episode of Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone.""  Entire families are being murdered and their children whisked away to a secret location.  The Satanists use war toys, dolls, and other seemingly harmless objects to slaughter parents before luring their children away for their own hellish purposes.  One couple, with their little girl, manages to enter the town.  Will they be able to stop the Satan worshippers' diabolical scheme before it is too late?Strother Martin gives a realistic, disturbing performance as the evil, two-faced Doc Duncan.  (He also played a mad professor in the successful science fiction horror film ""Sssssss""; he was transforming his young lab assistants into cobras.)  The ending is wonderfully downbeat and left open for the imagination - the type of ending that will haunt and chill you long after the credits have finished.If you like occult classics such as ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Race with the Devil,"" and ""The Devil's Rain,"" then you will want to add ""The Brotherhood of Satan"" to your collection.  It is highly recommended for fans of classic horror.  Also, if you enjoyed the modern ""Skeleton Key,"" starring Kate Hudson and Gena Rowlands, you will want to see ""The Brotherhood of Satan.""  Both films involve body snatching through witchcraft.It is a shame that, at the time of this writing, ""The Brotherhood of Satan"" is no longer in print.

A simple yet entertaining plot, ok acting and a wicked ending.  For a movie which is plotted on the worship of Satan, there is no nudity for a change, cool design sets, and Strother Martin portrays the Devilish high priest and his coven of witches and warlocks hang on his every word, which in some instances is quite articulate.  The plot is just like most plots, family get lost in some backwoods town and then get caught up in all the action, but in this movie the protagonist does not come out unscathed.  The sherrif, priest and deputy seem lost in space when trying to solve the mystery which provides some comic relief.  The ending is excellent so I will not spill the beans in that regard.

The movie pretty much lost me from the begining, with its 5 minute sequence where our lead faimly is driving in a car, with absolutely no dialogue and the worst elevator music possibly imaginably playing in the background. Then we witness a strange and confusing tank death that seems to come out of nowhere and essentially offer no real point other than a less than average death sequence. As I said before, the idea behind the movie sounded promising, a vacationing faimly gets stranded near a small town where all the children seem to be under the influence of a dark power,leading all the adults to react frantically to outsiders and the law. I like the whole idea about a town going all evil and murderous, but the pacing and confusing and long sequences really ruined the experience for me. There are some scenes that seem to just drag on and on. Like this pointless dream sequence that seemed to have no significance other than to confuse the audience. Then towards the end we get another strange and mind boggling climax that makes you scratch your head and shrug your shoulders, before you realize that you just wasted an hour and a half of your life. Overall an intresting idea that failed due to horrible directing, slow pacing ,and pointless and confusing sequences.

It looks like it was made yesterday, except of course for the early 70's vehicles used in it.  Brotherhood of Satan accomplishes what most horror films don't -- truly spooky atmospherics that creep into most of the moments of tension building.  The cult itself is humorous with ""I have nothing which isn't thine"" over and over, but the unintended humor only adds to the enjoyment of the film.  The DVD is a bit pricey but worth it for the movie itself which is beautifully photographed.  It has no extras in terms of the film itself, oddly there are trailers for other films on the disc, but none for this film.  The DVD is remastered in High Definition and it shows!!!

706481,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B0000694WG,William Amazzini,"[2, 3]","I first saw this film when it was first released.  The movie theater gave out packages of Satan seeds as a promo  which had grown into some cool looking wildflowers which I still have to this day in my backyard.  Out of all the films on the subject of Witchcraft and the Occult which sprouted out of the major studios and low budget filmmakers in the late sixties and early seventies, this is the one which chilled me to the bone and I still think its the best of its type to this day.  The subject of soul transference was dealt with here and there throughout horror film history probably reaching its apex with Paul Wendko's 'THE MEPHISTO WALTZ' but this chiller dealt with it through the possession of children. To this day, I have never seen a film which has the classic paranoia of the original 'INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS' but this film comes close. No one can be trusted as slowly we see that each member of the town is involved with the coven of satanists.  The films motif of a married couple who are allowed to enter the town because they have a child and not allowed to leave builds to a chilling climax and the ending is a true stunner.  Old western stalwarts Strother Martin and LQ Jones are included in the mix giving Martin one of his best over the top rolls.  I do not want to spoil it for first time viewers but showing the meetings of the coven and the rituals they perform  are extremely impressive and  director Bernard McEvetty gives the films set pieces just the right amount of atmosphere lacking even in the high tech direct to video dreck being released to this day. All moviegoers interested in horror films owe it to themselves to purchase this gem.
