Al Qasim,"[0, 0]","Ever since the emergence of Davey Jones in the series, I have been wondering whether the infamous Black Bear would be making an appearance in any of the series! I WAS RIGHT!One of my other thoughts was how could they show the Kraken without showing mermaids? Guess what? I WAS RIGHT AGAIN!I really believe that this movie takes nothing away from the series and is a very riveting continuation of the saga... in no way falling short to the rest of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The movie was as interesting to follow from start to finish... some points were slightly obvious, but not everything can be a mystery... you need to be guided along with the plot.Jack Sparrow continues to be the same quirky and eccentric hero (if he can be called that) that he has always been the past movies. Penelope Cruze was a good addition and she played the role well... she is rather fitting in her role, even when her character shifts gears dramatically she is able to convincingly play the two. I have no issue with a number of the old characters not showing up in this sequel as I think they have done their part and have been played out. Then there is Black Beard... Even though the actor had the face, the voice, and overall intimidating demeanour about him, I couldn't get over the fact that he was on the tubby side and HAD NO NECK!!! That was very irritating to me for some reason, not sure why.Now I have to say this because I couldn't help myself from blurting it out in during the movie and being shushed as a result... The scene where Jack ties a coconut to a rope and he rocks the palm tree and also where he swings from the palm tree using a rope to ties some villains up while he swings... WAS RIPPED OFF FROM A VERY OLD CARTOON I SAW AS A KID ABOUT THE ADVENTURES OF SINBAD AND ALI BABA!! IT HAD THE EXACT SAME MOVE IN THE EXACT SAME ORDER!!! RIPOFF!!!

1390855,A1ITCVZ46MUB3A,B004A8ZWUQ,A Hot Whizzer Summer...,"[42, 59]","On stranger tides follows the continuing story of Jack Sparrow after the end of At World's End. Taking place several years later, after Jack's map lead him to a dead end, he continues the search for the fountain of youth. I could say that the movie was OK, but suffered from several issues that just did not put it on par with any of the previous movies.The first issue was the antagonist, Blackbeard. Although he had a dramatic intro, after that, his character just waned. He was not intimidating, scary, or even particularly piraty. At no point could they decide what supernatural powers to give him, so they toss him a giant hodgepodge of whatever was convenient at the time. As a result, one minute he has the mystical power to control rope, another moment he can shrink ships into bottles, another moment he can resurrect the dead, no, he can make voodoo dolls, wait, he can control the wind? His ship has... a flamethrower? They claim him to be evil, and spend the entire movie declaring how evil he is... but he doesn't perform a single evil act in the entire movie. He kills a mutineer and captures and leaves to die a vicious mermaid who murders people... that's it. Other than that, for a pirate, he was actually a pretty decent guy.This leads to the next problem, they make all the other characters ""good"" so that Blackbeard seems evil in comparison. Pirates and thieves are suddenly altruistic and noble. Blackbeard's evil deed is being the only character in the movie that actually acted like a pirate, and not even a good one. This comes nowhere near the backstabbing, thieving, and traitorousness of the pirates of the first three movies. Suddenly Jack and Barbossa are best chums, this new girl which people keep saying added ""much needed sex appeal"" Angelica looks like a Latino stunt double of Swan. Her motivations, once again, despite being allegedly corrupted in evil, are completely altruistic and unpirate like.The final issue is how every scene was done. I swear the directors and writers sat down with the scripts of the first three movies and said, what is your favorite scenes from each movie and how can we shove them all into one? Oh, I loved the scene where the Kraken grabs all those people up. Ok, let's have that scene with magical ropes instead. Oh, I love that scene where will and jack fight on the roof planks in the blacksmith shop. Sounds good, let's do that again with Jack and that Angelica. How about that scene where Davy Jones pulls out the long cannons. Great! We'll make it a flamethrower instead! What about the scene where Jack escapes the soldiers. Sure, but we'll have him escape from the middle of the estate now! What about the turner/swan love interest. Yeah, we can throw some altruistic guy in their so he can sloppily be corrupted by pirates while falling in love with an ""unattainable"" woman outside his station.So yeah. That was the story. We have the antiheroes who have just turned into heroes, the bad guy that is little worse than any of the good guys, ""needed"" sex appeal that looks no different than the last 3 movies, except latin now. We have almost scene for scene grabs from the original trilogy, more poorly done and in the case of the relationship, was so out of place it could have just been left out.I give it 3 stars, because it was an OK watch, had it's fun moments with Jack Sparrow, and there was occasionally some witty dialogue or interesting scenes. However, ultimately completely unnecessary and anyone who love the trilogy could completely go without watching this.Edit: I figured I should add that Angelica, the latin girl, played by Penelope Cruz, an established actor, acts like, dresses like, and functions like swan from the second two movies. I am not comparing the actors... but that she was clearly a shoed in replacement for the swan character (scriptwise) and never really developed a personality of her own, I hope that solves the confusion.",3,Not a great movie,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,3933,"['stranger', 'tides', 'continuing', 'story', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'end', 'World', 'End', 'Taking', 'place', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'Jack', 'map', 'lead', 'dead', 'end', 'search', 'fountain', 'youth', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'OK', 'suffered', 'several', 'issues', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'par', 'previous', 'movies.The', 'first', 'issue', 'was', 'antagonist', 'Blackbeard', 'had', 'dramatic', 'intro', 'character', 'just', 'waned', 'was', 'not', 'intimidating', 'scary', 'even', 'particularly', 'piraty', 'point', 'could', 'decide', 'what', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'give', 'toss', 'giant', 'hodgepodge', 'was', 'convenient', 'time', 'result', 'one', 'minute', 'mystical', 'power', 'control', 'rope', 'moment', 'can', 'shrink', 'ships', 'bottles', 'moment', 'can', 'resurrect', 'dead', 'can', 'make', 'voodoo', 'dolls', 'wait', 'can', 'control', 'wind', 'ship', 'flamethrower', 'claim', 'be', 'evil', 'spend', 'entire', 'movie', 'declaring', 'how', 'evil', ""n't"", 'perform', 'single', 'evil', 'act', 'entire', 'movie', 'mutineer', 'captures', 'die', 'vicious', 'mermaid', 'who', 'people', 'Other', 'pirate', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'guy.This', 'next', 'problem', 'make', 'other', 'characters', 'good', 'Blackbeard', 'evil', 'comparison', 'Pirates', 'thieves', 'are', 'suddenly', 'altruistic', 'noble', 'Blackbeard', 'evil', 'deed', 'being', 'only', 'character', 'movie', 'actually', 'acted', 'pirate', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'one', 'nowhere', 'backstabbing', 'thieving', 'traitorousness', 'pirates', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'Suddenly', 'Jack', 'Barbossa', 'are', 'best', 'chums', 'new', 'girl', 'people', 'keep', 'saying', 'added', 'much', 'needed', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Angelica', 'Latino', 'stunt', 'double', 'Swan', 'motivations', 'once', 'again', 'being', 'allegedly', 'corrupted', 'evil', 'are', 'completely', 'altruistic', 'unpirate', 'like.The', 'final', 'issue', 'how', 'scene', 'was', 'done', 'swear', 'directors', 'writers', 'sat', 'down', 'scripts', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'said', 'what', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'how', 'can', 'shove', 'one', 'Oh', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'Kraken', 'grabs', 'people', 'up', 'Ok', 'let', 'have', 'scene', 'magical', 'ropes', 'instead', 'Oh', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'will', 'jack', 'fight', 'roof', 'planks', 'blacksmith', 'shop', 'good', 'let', 'do', 'again', 'Jack', 'Angelica', 'How', 'scene', 'where', 'Davy', 'Jones', 'out', 'long', 'cannons', 'Great', ""'ll"", 'make', 'flamethrower', 'instead', 'What', 'scene', 'where', 'Jack', 'soldiers', 'Sure', ""'ll"", 'have', 'escape', 'middle', 'estate', 'now', 'What', 'turner/swan', 'love', 'interest', 'Yeah', 'can', 'throw', 'altruistic', 'guy', 'can', 'sloppily', 'be', 'corrupted', 'pirates', 'falling', 'love', 'unattainable', 'woman', 'station.So', 'yeah', 'was', 'story', 'have', 'antiheroes', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'turned', 'heroes', 'bad', 'guy', 'little', 'worse', 'good', 'guys', 'needed', 'sex', 'appeal', 'different', 'last', '3', 'movies', 'latin', 'now', 'have', 'almost', 'scene', 'scene', 'grabs', 'original', 'trilogy', 'more', 'poorly', 'done', 'case', 'relationship', 'was', 'so', 'place', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'left', 'out.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'was', 'OK', 'watch', 'had', 'fun', 'moments', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'there', 'was', 'occasionally', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'However', 'ultimately', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'anyone', 'who', 'love', 'trilogy', 'could', 'completely', 'go', 'watching', 'this.Edit', 'figured', 'should', 'add', 'Angelica', 'latin', 'girl', 'played', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'established', 'actor', 'dresses', 'functions', 'swan', 'second', 'two', 'movies', 'am', 'not', 'comparing', 'actors', 'was', 'clearly', 'shoed', 'replacement', 'swan', 'character', 'scriptwise', 'never', 'really', 'developed', 'personality', 'own', 'hope', 'confusion']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

1390857,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004A8ZWUQ,A kids review,"[4, 13]","Disney has gotten a whole lot of mileage out of the Pirates franchise, considering it's based on one of its amusement park rides, and this fourth installment would test the true star power of not only its lead actor, Johnny Depp, but the saucy, wisecracking Jack Sparrow. How so? Well, with On Stranger Tides, Depp would have to make a go of it without three-time co-stars Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, as well as director Gore Verbinski, who had also helmed all three previous films. No, this time around, Jack Sparrow would have to contend with Angelica, a woman from his past who may be out to con him, and the fearsome pirate Blackbeard in a Rob Marshall-directed quest to discover the Fountain of Youth. As it turns out, On Stranger Tides is the worst of all the Pirates films, and it made the least amount of money at the box office, but when you consider the performance of the first three installments, which all had diminishing box office returns and got progressively worse, it's not quite so bad. Despite its jumbled plot and overabundance of noisy action sequences, Pirates 4 still earned a worldwide sum of over $1 billion, so if all you needed was a little more Jack Sparrow, this will suit you just fine.",1,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,1224,"['Disney', 'gotten', 'whole', 'lot', 'mileage', 'Pirates', 'franchise', 'considering', 'based', 'one', 'amusement', 'park', 'rides', 'fourth', 'installment', 'would', 'test', 'true', 'star', 'power', 'not', 'only', 'lead', 'actor', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'saucy', 'wisecracking', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'How', 'so', 'Well', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'Depp', 'would', 'have', 'make', 'go', 'three-time', 'co-stars', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'who', 'had', 'also', 'helmed', 'three', 'previous', 'films', 'No', 'time', 'around', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'would', 'have', 'contend', 'Angelica', 'woman', 'past', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'out', 'con', 'fearsome', 'pirate', 'Blackbeard', 'Rob', 'Marshall-directed', 'quest', 'discover', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'out', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'worst', 'Pirates', 'films', 'made', 'least', 'amount', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'consider', 'performance', 'first', 'three', 'installments', 'had', 'diminishing', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'got', 'progressively', 'worse', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'bad', 'jumbled', 'plot', 'overabundance', 'noisy', 'action', 'sequences', '4', 'still', 'earned', 'worldwide', 'sum', '1', 'billion', 'so', 'needed', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'will', 'suit', 'just', 'fine']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

When Pirates 4 came out, there seemed to be a lot of that.  It was either the worst thing Johnny Depp has ever pranced across, or, at least, so much better than the last couple of sequels.  Well friends, I come to make a declaration: It was okay.  As a big budget blockbuster with a some laughs and derring do, the movie works just fine.Is it amazing?  Not really.  I really dig Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.  He clearly has a lot of fun with the role and is a great character to watch.  That said, Captain Jack is not the sort of character that needs to carry the movie.  Sure, he can carry it based soley on his charisma, but as far as how big a role he plays, he works a little better in smaller doses.Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley aren't around for this adventure, so Captain Jack is the man.  A missionary named Phillip is there to presumably take on the Will Turner-esque role, but other than simply to shoe-horn a romance between him and the mermaid; he doesn't add much to the proceedings.  Yes, a movie like this full of scalawags and scoundrels needs a character that provides a moral center to the movie, but Phillip could be removed from the flick and it would not change anything.The action itself is fine and full of swashbuckling fun. Yet I just couldn't help but notice a lack of sizzle and panache to the set pieces that Gore Verbinski brought to the original three Pirate movies.  They are exciting, but not quite as inventive as some of those great sequences.All that said, I did enjoy the movie.  The one problem I had with the original Pirate movies was that there's a bit of bloatedness about them.  Especially the third one.  This one is way more straightforward and I really appreciated that it felt like more of a self-contained adventure that's not tripping over itself to set up sequels.The storyline is interesting enough.  I always enjoy the search for lost treasures and artifacts and the search for the Fountain of Youth is always good for this type of genre. They have a lot of fun with it and the twists and turns are clever, as is a good deal of the dialogue.I really like the cast of these movies.  Captain Jack, as always, is a pleasure, even if he shouldn't be carrying the film.  It's always good to see master Gibbs and Captain Barbossa is always a blast.  These movies would not be the same without him.  As for the newcomers, Penelope Cruz I can take or leave.  I've never quite gotten the love for her, but whatever.  She's fine here.  Blackbeard is a nice addition to this motley cast of misfits and is adequately intimidating and evil; thought not quite as to the level of Davy Jones in Dead Man's Chest.It's not great, but it's not horrible either.  It's a perfectly fine adventure film that's perfect for a lazy Saturday afternoon.  There's enough fun and interesting ideas in the movie to keep it afloat (so to speak), but it just doesn't quite reach the heights of something more memorable.  The blu-ray looks and sounds great and I don't regret having a copy sitting on the shelf to throw in when I'm in the mood for some Captain Jack.",3,"Entertaining, if a tad uninspired, entry into the series.",1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,3222,"['world', 'one', 'extreme', 'opinion', 'extreme', 'opposite', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'lot', 'patience', 'middle', 'road', 'When', '4', 'came', 'out', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'was', 'worst', 'thing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'ever', 'pranced', 'least', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'last', 'couple', 'sequels', 'Well', 'come', 'make', 'declaration', 'was', 'okay', 'big', 'budget', 'blockbuster', 'laughs', 'derring', 'do', 'movie', 'just', 'fine.Is', 'amazing', 'Not', 'really', 'really', 'dig', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'clearly', 'lot', 'fun', 'role', 'great', 'character', 'watch', 'said', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'not', 'sort', 'character', 'carry', 'movie', 'Sure', 'can', 'carry', 'based', 'soley', 'charisma', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'big', 'role', 'little', 'better', 'smaller', 'doses.Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'are', ""n't"", 'around', 'adventure', 'so', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'man', 'missionary', 'named', 'Phillip', 'there', 'presumably', 'take', 'Will', 'Turner-esque', 'role', 'other', 'simply', 'shoe-horn', 'romance', 'mermaid', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'proceedings', 'Yes', 'movie', 'full', 'scalawags', 'scoundrels', 'character', 'moral', 'center', 'movie', 'Phillip', 'could', 'be', 'removed', 'flick', 'would', 'not', 'change', 'anything.The', 'action', 'fine', 'full', 'swashbuckling', 'fun', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'lack', 'sizzle', 'panache', 'set', 'pieces', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'brought', 'original', 'three', 'Pirate', 'movies', 'are', 'exciting', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'inventive', 'great', 'sequences.All', 'said', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'one', 'problem', 'had', 'original', 'Pirate', 'movies', 'was', 'bit', 'bloatedness', 'Especially', 'third', 'one', 'one', 'way', 'more', 'straightforward', 'really', 'appreciated', 'felt', 'more', 'self-contained', 'adventure', 'not', 'tripping', 'set', 'up', 'sequels.The', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'enough', 'always', 'enjoy', 'search', 'lost', 'treasures', 'artifacts', 'search', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'always', 'good', 'type', 'genre', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'clever', 'good', 'deal', 'dialogue.I', 'really', 'cast', 'movies', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'always', 'pleasure', 'even', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'carrying', 'film', 'always', 'good', 'see', 'master', 'Gibbs', 'Captain', 'Barbossa', 'always', 'blast', 'movies', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'newcomers', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'can', 'take', 'leave', ""'ve"", 'never', 'quite', 'love', 'whatever', 'fine', 'here', 'Blackbeard', 'nice', 'addition', 'motley', 'cast', 'misfits', 'adequately', 'intimidating', 'evil', 'thought', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'Davy', 'Jones', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Chest.It', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'horrible', 'either', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'adventure', 'film', 'perfect', 'lazy', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'enough', 'fun', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'movie', 'keep', 'afloat', 'so', 'speak', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'heights', 'something', 'more', 'memorable', 'blu-ray', 'looks', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'having', 'copy', 'sitting', 'shelf', 'throw', 'when', ""'m"", 'mood', 'Captain', 'Jack']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

A critics dream this is not, but of course it will still wow plenty of summer audiences, and no doubt be a financial success.So to my ""muddled"" comment. Well the story (which was probably conceived as a good idea somewhere) revolves around Jack Sparrow searching for the fountain of youth.Tagging along are the ever pleasing Jeffrey Rush as Barbossa chewing scenery as he goes, and arch nemesis Ian McShane as Blackbeard, complete with beautiful daughter Cruz.Secret silver chalices, CGI mermaids that change from beauty to beast while attacking, and an ever present need for the cast to explain what is going on, just makes the whole thing look muddled.Depp's antics stretch credulity even more than usual, as does most of the story, from an initial escape (again) to the plot twisting quest. Another criticism for me would be that Cruz and Depp do not have the spark or chemistry they should, probably safer to say that Depp and Rush have more.Of course it's a PG-13 so the action and eye candy abound. That's probably what saves the movie somewhat, it's less plodding than the previous movies, and as long as you can suspend disbelief enough, you'll enjoy the action sequences that seem to bombard most of the film.No spoilers here, just accept it for what it is. 3 Stars",3,In a word...........muddled,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,2075,"['review', 'movie', 'seen', 'theater', 'NOT', 'BD', 'release', 'planned', 'future.Chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'reading', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Pirates', 'franchise', 'and/or', 'Depp', 'company', 'so', 'are', 'willing', 'overlook', 'fact', 'money', 'spinning', 'exercise', 'set', 'squarely', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'genre', 'summer', 'blockbusters.Much', 'been', 'made', 'absence', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'so', 'far', 'thought', 'ridiculous', 'unnecessary', '4th', 'outing', 'not', 'be', 'involved', 'inclusion', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'anyway', 'opinion', '.This', 'latest', 'somewhat', 'shorter', 'installment', 'treads', 'much', 'same', 'ground', 'previous', '3', 'surprise', 'hate', 'have', 'agree', 'part', 'continuing', 'winning', 'formula', 'critics', 'dream', 'not', 'course', 'will', 'still', 'wow', 'plenty', 'summer', 'audiences', 'doubt', 'be', 'financial', 'success.So', 'muddled', 'comment', 'Well', 'story', 'was', 'probably', 'conceived', 'good', 'idea', 'somewhere', 'around', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'searching', 'fountain', 'youth.Tagging', 'along', 'are', 'ever', 'pleasing', 'Jeffrey', 'Rush', 'Barbossa', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Blackbeard', 'complete', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Cruz.Secret', 'silver', 'chalices', 'CGI', 'change', 'beauty', 'beast', 'attacking', 'ever', 'present', 'need', 'cast', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'just', 'whole', 'thing', 'look', 'muddled.Depp', 'antics', 'stretch', 'credulity', 'even', 'more', 'usual', 'most', 'story', 'initial', 'escape', 'again', 'plot', 'twisting', 'quest', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'Cruz', 'Depp', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'spark', 'chemistry', 'should', 'probably', 'safer', 'say', 'Depp', 'Rush', 'have', 'more.Of', 'course', 'PG-13', 'action', 'eye', 'candy', 'abound', 'probably', 'what', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'less', 'plodding', 'previous', 'movies', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'action', 'seem', 'bombard', 'most', 'film.No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'just', 'accept', 'what', '3', 'Stars']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

Even though the romantic history and sexual tension was there between her and Jack, I still didn't really believe it. She seemed more like just another enemy in disguise, almost Jack's equal.

The story this time around is that the Spanish, the English and Captain Blackbeard all want the fountain of youth so three ships set sail. Jack Sparrow get involved with this and the race in on, who will get to the fountain first. Now this is not a bad movie, it is entertaining but the plot lack the twists and turns that made the first three movies so fun.This movie suffer from the beating a dead horse for money syndrome. The first trilogy rounds of and ends the story nicely, however as a result of that both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner was taken out of the picture, now I am glad those that made this film did not decide to ruin that ending and bring those two back, however them missing from the character list give Jack Sparrow very few balancing points and also drives the number of sub plots and plot twists down to almost nothing. Yes they do bring in some new characters but the chemistry just is not there. The fact of the matter is, this movie never needed to be made, the original trilogy have one, contained storyline, that ends. This movie is just made so Disney can milk a few more bucks out of their franchise.Now as for the humor, a big part of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are the humor, and yes this movie to was funny, but while I in the first trilogy would laugh so hard my eyes would water up, this one was humerus at times but they tried to hard, with over acting and very contrived situations, many of which just where not funny, several times I could not suspend my disbelief because the acting was just bad, not the entire movie mind you bit in some of the scenes, it was like if Disney just said, ah people will buy this film anyway, it is a best selling franchise let us just not give a *beep* about if a scene turns out bad, let us just churn it out anyway, the movie is sloppy.Now I am not saying that Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides is a bad movie, it have many good scenes, the action is entraining, the story is good and the special effects is often very well done, especially during the mermaid battle. (it is like Disney got tired of hearing how sweet and innocent their mermaids are, for these will rip your face of an enjoy it.) If you like the first three movies in the series I am sure you will enjoy this, it is not bad, it is just that when watching the first three movies I looked down when it was over and saw my popcorn untouched in my hand, the movies had sucked me into it's story making me forget everything else from the first scene until the credits rolled, this movie is merely ok. It is a ok fantasy movie but it is sub par to the rest of the series and it also feels very tacked on.I recommend this movie to fantasy, swashbuckling and action fans, but if you expect it to be of the same caliber as the original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, then prepare to be disappointed. If you just want two hours of entertainment of the fantastical sort then this movie will provide that and do so fairly well.",3,Entetaining Pirate romp but not as good as the first three.,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,3186,"['Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'same', 'formula', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'monsters', 'treasure', 'swashbuckling', 'do', 'not', 'manage', 'live', 'up', 'awesomeness', 'first', 'trilogy', 'story', 'time', 'around', 'Spanish', 'English', 'Captain', 'Blackbeard', 'want', 'fountain', 'youth', 'three', 'ships', 'set', 'sail', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'get', 'involved', 'race', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'fountain', 'first', 'Now', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'lack', 'twists', 'made', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'so', 'fun.This', 'movie', 'suffer', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'money', 'syndrome', 'first', 'trilogy', 'rounds', 'story', 'nicely', 'however', 'result', 'Elizabeth', 'Swann', 'Will', 'Turner', 'was', 'taken', 'picture', 'now', 'am', 'glad', 'made', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'decide', 'ruin', 'ending', 'bring', 'two', 'back', 'however', 'missing', 'character', 'list', 'give', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'very', 'few', 'balancing', 'points', 'also', 'number', 'sub', 'plots', 'plot', 'twists', 'down', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Yes', 'do', 'bring', 'new', 'characters', 'chemistry', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'fact', 'matter', 'movie', 'never', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'original', 'trilogy', 'have', 'one', 'contained', 'storyline', 'movie', 'just', 'made', 'so', 'Disney', 'can', 'milk', 'few', 'more', 'bucks', 'franchise.Now', 'humor', 'big', 'part', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'movies', 'are', 'humor', 'yes', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'trilogy', 'would', 'laugh', 'so', 'hard', 'eyes', 'would', 'water', 'up', 'one', 'was', 'humerus', 'times', 'tried', 'hard', 'acting', 'very', 'contrived', 'situations', 'many', 'just', 'where', 'not', 'funny', 'several', 'times', 'could', 'not', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'not', 'entire', 'movie', 'mind', 'bit', 'scenes', 'was', 'Disney', 'just', 'said', 'ah', 'people', 'will', 'buy', 'film', 'anyway', 'best', 'selling', 'franchise', 'let', 'just', 'not', 'give', '*beep*', 'scene', 'out', 'bad', 'let', 'just', 'churn', 'out', 'anyway', 'movie', 'sloppy.Now', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'bad', 'movie', 'have', 'many', 'good', 'scenes', 'action', 'entraining', 'story', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'often', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'mermaid', 'battle', 'Disney', 'got', 'tired', 'hearing', 'how', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'mermaids', 'are', 'will', 'rip', 'face', 'enjoy', 'like', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'series', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'when', 'watching', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'looked', 'down', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'saw', 'popcorn', 'untouched', 'hand', 'movies', 'had', 'sucked', 'story', 'making', 'forget', 'everything', 'else', 'first', 'scene', 'credits', 'rolled', 'movie', 'merely', 'ok', 'ok', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'sub', 'par', 'rest', 'series', 'also', 'very', 'tacked', 'on.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'swashbuckling', 'action', 'fans', 'expect', 'be', 'same', 'caliber', 'original', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'trilogy', 'then', 'prepare', 'be', 'disappointed', 'just', 'want', 'two', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'fantastical', 'sort', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'provide', 'do', 'so', 'fairly', 'well']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

All of varying worth. Many critics say that these long running franchises returning for a 4th film never live up to the hype or to the series they are a part of. Well, 'Pirates 4' comes along to change all that. It is a sequel, coming 4 years after the last one(which is like 10 years in this generation where last week is old), it is a part 4, and it's wonderful. Critics say otherwise, but this is one movie where the audience has spoken, and they are loving it.I could go into the story, but why bother? By now, everyone should know that Capt. Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp)is back, and he is journeying to the famed fountain of youth, along with old foe Barbarossa(the great Geoffrey Rush), evil Pirate Blackbeard(the even better Ian McShane), and old flame Angelica(Penelope Cruz) who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter. Along the way, our characters run across exciting adventures and scary mermaids.First of all, people and critics were quite vocal on how the two sequels were too complicated, over-stuffed, and confusing. Thankfully, this latest adventure simplifies the material in a way that harkens back to the wonderful, and now classic, original 2003 film. There is now B and C storylines to dampen down the festivities. Everything is pretty simple and crystal clear and easy to follow along. In fact, the whole movie has such a refreshing air to it, that it really does go back to the original. The immense charm of the original film with Depp's Sparrow and humor is here in full force. The magic is there. The fun time, popcorn blockbuster is there. Part 3 was disappointing and was missing most of this, but it's here in spades with part 4. Also in abundance is the action. Part 3 was so long that the action felt few and far between. Here, there is plenty of action. The movie never slows down and is never boring. Ever. New director Rob Marshall keeps things moving at a fun and brisk pace. It's continuously watchable and gorgeous, like all the others, to look at. It is, without a doubt, the most fun and entertaining movie in the franchise since the first one.The cast is great. Johnny Depp is these movies. People come to see him in this role and he doesn't disappoint in this one. He seems more alive, lively, refrshed, and as amusing as ever. Elsewhere, you will be wondering ""Orlando and Keira who?"" You won't miss them. Penelope Cruz holds her own as Angelica. Rush is as great as he always is in the other films. And then there is Ian McShane. He is just cool. Blackbeard is a character to be reckoned with, and McShane is so evil and icy cool, that he owns every scene he is in. There are new characters littered throughout the film, but none of them really bring much. I will say though, that the actrss who plays Serena the mermaid, and I don't remember her name, may be one of the loveliest beauties I have seen on the silver screen in some time.The critics have not been kind. Some have been downright savage, and I cannot understand why. The audienc I saw it with clapped at the end. ""On Stranger Tides"" may not be so strange, but it delivers what everyone wants and hopes for in a Pirate's movie. Easily the best of the sequels, the movie is great fun. It has a new zest of life and has a sharp script filled with rousing action, some great dialogue, and some great humor.  What more can you ask for? I am a huge fan of the franchise. Part 3 was not what everyone wanted, but ""On Stranger Tides"" does a great job of steering this mighty franchise back on course.

This is the part I don't understand.  I must have purchased a different movie that had been mislabeled with the same title.  The version that I bought was completely different.True there was action enough to sate the action lovers among us but my version was heavy on dialog in the first half.  The dialog, in fact, was so prevalent and convoluted that I said to myself several times that I was going to have to watch this movie several times to understand exactly what was going on.  Maybe that says something about my level of intelligence - I hope not.I read Mr. Nallick's review before I purchased the movie and was expecting 75 to 90 percent action.  I was dreading watching the movie because my favorite of the three original POTC movies was the third. (At World's End)  I know, this is not a very popular opinion because most critics seem to dislike the amount of dialog.But how about the fourth movie (On Stranger Tides) for which this review is being written?  Was it good enough for a lover of the series (as I am) to enjoy it?  Did it fall flat on it's face like most sequels seem to do?  Was it worth the price of admission?I loved it!  Hands down, no hesitation, no argument.  I'll admit that I was, at first, a little disappointed that some of the characters from the other three movies were not present but like some of the other reviewers I forgot them completely soon after the first few minutes.  No, I'm not talking about Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley but some of the more colorful characters like Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Cook as Pintel and Ragetti.  As far as I am concerned these two stole the show every time they appeared on screen.  Also. I absolutely loved Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and Martin Klebba as Marty was great for making me laugh many times.As far as the dialog/action ratio, I feel that this movie was done right.  I was never bored and always had my intellect stroked.  I got caught up in the story and was glued to the screen throughout the movie.I always judge a movie by the way it makes me feel when it is over.  When the credits started I immediately checked my feeling and emotions and gave this movie a thumbs up.  I wanted it to continue.  I had not had enough.  If you are reading this review in order to make a decision about purchasing this movie let me admonish you to buy it.  You will not be disappointed.Well, I'm going to go and put this DVD in the player right now and watch it again tonight.

Being an armchair maritime archeologist makes these movies especially painful. Why? Simply because the real stories of the pirates (especially Henry Morgan and Blackbeard/aka. Edward Teach) are far more interesting than these fake, made up Hollywood plots can and could ever hope to be. The plot is tedious, confusing and dull in this installment. The props look like they where taken from the shelves of Home Depot and ""weathered"" to look old. The actors teeth,hair, skin are clean as a whistle. Their style of talking sounds like they are fresh from  the 21st century. I could go on and on. Since when do these directors feel the need to abandon the important events of History and make a mockery out of the period and subject? It was a brutal, hard life back then, but these films portray people as happy-go lucky and carefree to the point of making the viewer (ironically)sick to their stomachs. After publisher's found Michael Crichton's novel ""Pirate Latitudes"" on his computer, i became very worried that the whole Pirate theme would be taken as a joke, and the only thing serious about the genre was making money. With this movie, my worst fears have been realized. When will we ever get a solid film like Heston's ""Treasure Island"" adaptation?

Part four of the Pirates franchise spends a little too long idling in the doldrums but excursions into fresh waters keep this latest installment afloat. Watch out though, that hull is springing leaks and it's unlikely she'll last any further voyages. Much like a trans-Atlantic crossing, you'd better be sure you're up to the lengthy challenge before ye board this wooden vessel.The good: part four has lost the incessant pouting of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom; there's an awesomely spooky sequence where some nasty mermaids move in for the kill; there's Blackbeard's fearsome black magic; there's some very nifty action, lavish production design (director Rob Marshall has a background in musical theatre) and the effects are all top notch. And Geoffrey Rush has a peg leg.The not so good: 130 minutes is too long for a pirate movie; Ian McShane is surprisingly underpowered as the villain; Johnny Depp's Captain Jack is just along for the ride without much to do; the film lacks both the narrative drive and freshness of the first.Benefiting from the decision to begin anew after the existing trilogy is a good idea.

It also marks the return of many a memorable character such as Geoffrey Rush as the newly-maimed privateer Hector Barbossa and ever-lovable Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs. Introduction of new characters such as Black Beard (Ian McShane) and Angelica (Penelope Cruz) are a most welcome change.From sweeping Carribean landscapes to the civilised world of London, this journey takes us across many rivers, streams and canyons in search for the Fountain of Youth, with different groups all searching for it for their own reasons and purposes. Although there are many things to praise about the look and execution of the movie and the level of escapism it provides to the viewer, I find it more conducive at this juncture to comment on the main failings of this fourth venture of the franchise.There, now that the bad stuff is out of the way, time to explore the exciting parts. No sense in repeating it, but Johnny Depp delivers. Every scene that he is in is a blast, though I was expecting a better entrance. Sparrow's clever ways to get into and out of trouble are hilarious to the point of amazement and his incredulous habit of making things up as he goes along is extended here and to great effect.Penelope gives a refreshing change of pace as the leading woman, and it is interesting to know about Sparrow's foggy past life. Barring a few missteps, Cruz does a pretty good job, coming off as a good contender for Sparrow's better half.Ian Mcshane steals the show. It is clear he took this job seriously and did his homework, because Black Beard actually comes off as the Pirate All Pirates Fear. Honestly, I never believed anyone could pull that role off, but Ian does and fills the viewers with a sense of respect and fear for the character.Geoffrey Rush has brushed up his act, but with an Oscar nomination in his wake, I expected him to deliver more. It is clear that he is meant to stay in this franchise, but honestly, his gravitas and cruel sense of humor in the first movie can never be matched, and apparently not by his own self.Hopefully in the sequel we will see a grand return of Barbossa to his older days of Pirate glory. And why was the monkey actually not there?The 3D is always great and a few scenes actually give you a sense of satisfaction for money-well-spent.This is a minor gripe. Although they re-hired Hans Zimmer as the music director for this movie, I felt he re-used most of his formerly loved cues and music themes. We have come to expect a lot more from you, Hans, now that you have proved yourself a master music director.Go watch it anyway. It is fun for the entire family.

This one has a rather strange love story between a mermaid and a missionary.  But I like this Pirates movie as much as the first one because of Jack Sparrow.  For the first time, he is THE good guy--as selfish as ever, but a character you like because his enemies are even worse and because of his random, unpredictable, silly personality.  Johnny Depp has a real genius for playing him.  This Pirates movie also has the advantage of Penelope Cruz as Angelica, a much more interesting character than the snobbish Elizabeth Swan.  She is somewhat devout but somewhat treacherous.  This one's also much better than the 2nd and 3rd ones because it has a story that actually makes sense, whereas the 3rd was like the Twilight Zone, in effect ruining the 2nd which was building up to it.  The ending on this, unlike the 2nd, is satisfying even though unresolved.  Most of all, this Pirates impressed me after my disgust with #'s 2 and 3 because of its clever dialogue between Jack Sparrow and other people, and with the originality and humor of his escapades.  The director is effective and uses close-ups of Jack to the maximum comic effect.

1390944,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004A8ZWUQ,C. Sawin,"[5, 9]","The Pirates of the Caribbean films have never pretended to be anything that they're not. Their inspiration was an amusement park ride after all. The films seem to be more of a vehicle for Johnny Depp to step inside of a character he has a little too much fun playing and are aimed toward women (and men, in some cases) who like to oggle him more than anything. The sequels just felt like an already thin premise was stretched beyond its means, which resulted in lackluster sequels that came off as being too similar to the original film. They were still entertaining on some level and people really seem to love the franchise. But you can't expect a new sequel to come along and break the mold, especially when the previous films have made over $2.5 billion at the worldwide box office. On Stranger Tides pretty much offers more of the same for its fans.The Pirates films have never shied away from action, but On Stranger Tides seems to have even more than the films before it. It's Jack Sparrow's first film away from Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, so some over the top antics can probably be expected. Most of the film felt like an episode of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" except it was centered around Jack Sparrow instead of the Duke boys and revolved around the open sea and The Black Pearl instead of Hazzard county and General Lee. Most of the scenes could basically be described in that voice over that'd say something along the lines of, ""Jack's sure gotten himself into one heck of a pickle this time. How in the world will he swashbuckle his way out of this one?""With Jack worming his way out of several crazy situations and nearly non-stop swordplay and action, the film's cast could probably be considered better than decent. Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally are the only returning cast members from the previous films other than Depp and they slide back into the Barbossa and Gibbs characters just as easily as Depp channels Jack Sparrow. Angelica, played by Penelope Cruz, was a little too convenient of a character. A former love interest of Jack's who hasn't forgiven or forgotten the way things ended between them. Their relationship and the way things pan out between them just seemed rather predictable in the long run. Ian McShane was pretty disappointing, as well. He's given this incredibly cool character in Blackbeard. All pirates fear him; he has this awesome pirate ship, and can bring men back from the dead. He even has a few memorable one liners, but the guy couldn't have looked more bored during the entire film. Johnny Depp looks to be the only guy actually having fun in this film while everyone else just sees it as another job. On Stranger Tides still has an entertaining vibe to it, but also feels like a film we've seen three times before.Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is familiar territory. By now you should have a good idea of whether or not you'll enjoy the film or not. It follows the same formula as the previous three films, but is the shortest of the films and seems to be lacking a story that really reels you in. Audiences love Johnny Depp, so there's no doubt it'll be a success. The action does seem to be amped up a bit, but Jack Sparrow seems goofier than ever. It's humorous at times, but similar to Homer getting dumber in every new season of ""The Simpsons.""

The first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movie introduced Johnny Depp to a much, much wider audience; as Captain Jack Sparrow, he was a wonder, cracking wise and kicking butt (often at the same time).  CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL remains a family-friendly action/adventure classic.  It's sequels...eh.ON STRANGER TIDES makes no sense.  Okay?  Should this surprise you...you're in the wrong genre, my friend.  It's big and bold (though not nearly as much as its two predecessors, thank God), features some mediocre acting (Depp and Geoffrey Rush remain strong, and Ian McShane is fantastic even though his character is crudely drawn), a few genuine laughs, a few false laughs, a few failed bits of choreography, and a whole lot of fun.  Maybe not as much fun as back at the beginning, when all of this was new, but you'll still enjoy yourself...probably.The plot?  Something to do with Blackbeard (McShane), his daughter (Penelope Cruz; finally, a strong female character, or at least a strong female actress); Captain Barbosa (Rush) as a British emissary; a shirtless priest who falls in love with a mermaid (you think I'm joking, but I'm not); the fountain of youth; and a bunch of good pirates and evil British guys.  Oh, and Keith Richards.  Rock on.If I sound sarcastic, it's because you just can't take this movie seriously, not even on its own terms.  But trust me: ON STRANGER TIDES is, at the very least, a fun movie (note the three stars).  Jack Sparrow is getting rather tired (I would much rather watch the first film on repeat), but Depp still has enough charisma to breathe a little bit more life into him.  If nothing else, the visuals remain spectacular, the plot interesting enough for us to forgive the fact that it is so full of holes an elephant could waltz right through it, and the pirates still delightfully funny (I'd love to see the ""realistic"" version of this film...well, maybe not).

1390952,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B004A8ZWUQ,David A. Wend,"[2, 4]","After reading several negative reviews about Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, I had small expectations when I went to see the film.  In my point-of-view, the critics are dead wrong.  One of the critical objections that I looked for was a lack of ""chemistry"" between Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz. I don't know what the critic thought was missing but considering that neither Jack Sparrow nor Angelica can afford to trust the other, their performances were spot on.  I also cannot agree that Johnny Depp's performance was lacking anything; his performance had the freshness of the first film in the series.On Stranger Tides is an entertaining movie with an excellent story that has several interesting twists and turns (some minor spoilers follow). The opening of the film finds Gibbs (perfectly played once again by Kevin McNally) on trial for being mistaken as Captain Jack Sparrow only to be saved by Sparrow impersonating a judge.  The elaborate escape that follows, with plenty of excellent stunt work (including a cameo by Dame Judi Dench), is beautifully carried out.  Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has joined the Royal Navy in this installment and is seeking to be the first to find the Fountain of Youth for King George II (nicely played by Richard Griffiths of Harry Potter fame).  Barbossa is as slippery as usual but is never as ruthless as Blackbeard (Ian McShane) is.  It has been predicted that Blackbeard (who has an array of black magic powers) will meet his death soon so he will stop at nothing to be the first to the Fountain. The mermaids were a marvelous addition to the story.  I don't buy the comparisons to vampires just because the mermaids show fangs.  I also liked the role of Philip (the preacher, sensitively played by Sam Claflin) who falls in love with the captured mermaid Syrena (end of spoilers)Altogether, On Stranger Shores is an entertaining action film. There is plenty to like from the special effects, to the verbal sparing between Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp to the malevolent evil of Blackbeard.  This film is more a true successor to the original film in spirit and story than the second and third installments.",5,An Excellent Sequel,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,2171,"['reading', 'several', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'had', 'small', 'expectations', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'point-of-view', 'critics', 'are', 'dead', 'wrong', 'One', 'critical', 'objections', 'looked', 'was', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'critic', 'thought', 'was', 'missing', 'considering', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Angelica', 'can', 'afford', 'trust', 'other', 'performances', 'were', 'spot', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'was', 'lacking', 'anything', 'performance', 'had', 'freshness', 'first', 'film', 'series.On', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'excellent', 'story', 'several', 'interesting', 'twists', 'turns', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'opening', 'film', 'Gibbs', 'perfectly', 'played', 'once', 'again', 'Kevin', 'McNally', 'trial', 'being', 'mistaken', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'only', 'be', 'saved', 'Sparrow', 'impersonating', 'judge', 'elaborate', 'escape', 'plenty', 'excellent', 'stunt', 'work', 'including', 'cameo', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'beautifully', 'carried', 'out', 'Captain', 'Barbossa', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'joined', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'installment', 'seeking', 'be', 'first', 'find', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'King', 'George', 'II', 'nicely', 'played', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'Barbossa', 'as', 'slippery', 'usual', 'never', 'as', 'ruthless', 'Blackbeard', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'been', 'predicted', 'Blackbeard', 'who', 'array', 'black', 'magic', 'powers', 'will', 'meet', 'death', 'soon', 'so', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'be', 'first', 'Fountain', 'mermaids', 'were', 'marvelous', 'addition', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'comparisons', 'vampires', 'just', 'mermaids', 'show', 'fangs', 'also', 'liked', 'role', 'Philip', 'preacher', 'sensitively', 'played', 'Sam', 'Claflin', 'who', 'love', 'captured', 'mermaid', 'Syrena', 'end', 'spoilers', 'Altogether', 'Stranger', 'Shores', 'entertaining', 'action', 'film', 'plenty', 'like', 'special', 'effects', 'verbal', 'sparing', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'malevolent', 'evil', 'Blackbeard', 'film', 'more', 'true', 'successor', 'original', 'film', 'spirit', 'story', 'second', 'third', 'installments']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

There's enough in this package to satisfy almost anyone who has an interest in the franchise.The 3D effects are rather modest but provide an interesting alternative for those who have taken the step into 3D. The picture and the sound are both first class; the movie features dts HD Master Audio 7.1 and the surround speakers are given a serious workout as is the subwoofer. There is an interesting surprise awaiting those who decided to watch all the way to the end of the credits; don't miss out on this one.Another very gratifying plus is the use of dts HD Master Audio 5.1 on the Bonus Disc; not only is the picture 1080P but it features an aggressive sound package which gives all of the speakers a good workout.

1390956,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B004A8ZWUQ,David J. Brown,"[5, 10]","Firstly, to clarify, this is really a *** and 1/2 movie and not quite a four star.The first Pirates movie came out of left field for most viewers and especially serious critics.  How could a film based on a ride really be anything good?  Then the film came out and blew all away.  Sure, it's too long and gets a bit repetitive towards the third act but it mostly works and could very well be a future classic.  The most surprising thing was that Johnny Depp created an iconic character that ranks up their with James Bond or Indiana Jones.  I wasn't surprised but mostly because I feel that Depp is the modern Brando, but without the career slumps up and down.  Then of course we get our sequels, like the 80's being rehashed, EVERYTHING gets a sequel, spin-off or prequel these days.  It's fairly boring, but has its pleasures.  The sequels were written with a trilogy in mind.  Basically events in the first film were now made more important to connect it with the second and third film with mixed results.  I loved Dead Man's Chest.  It was fun, bombastic, and had tons of original and cool visuals to go along with an inventive new villain Davey Jones.  What is this you say?  You liked part 2 better than 3?!?!?!  But part 2 was basically a long trailer for the third film!  Yeah, and I say sometimes the trailers for movies are better than the actual movies.  The problem with the sequels were that they made their plots waaaaaaaay too convoluted and overly stuffed.  While the second was a huge fun set up, the third film's pay off wasn't that great or exciting or rewarding.  On top of that it seemed to meander for no real reason towards the middle, with very little action, and finally gave us an epic third act battle to veg out on.  While I think the first film was great, the second good, and the third okay, I'm still a pretty big fan of the series, but especially of the Depp created Jack Sparrow.  I didn't understand why they didn't just create a series called The Adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow and drop the rest.  Well, this fourth film is the closes thing to that so far.....Firstly, the strained Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom stories truly have been ended as the third film suggested.  Thank you.  It was getting hard to figure out why their characters were even in the sequels after a while.  Hell, Knightly's Elizabeth Swan got shoehorned into playing a plot point as a Pirate lord at the end of the third film and it became laughable, not only because she wasn't believable but because it was obvious that her character had no plot function anymore and the writer's could only come up with that.  Here Jack Sparrow finally gets front and center.  His character drives the action and the film is being told through his character's eyes and not Elizabeth Swan's.  This is a Jack adventure.  Which is right.  Jack should be like James Bond and Indiana Jones.  The film's don't need continuity.  Just give us more Jack adventures.  I always found it funny that people referred to the Indiana Jones films as a trilogy before the fourth film came out.  All three, now four, films are disconnected.  They're just serialized adventures with a main character, and some side characters, in common.  I like this and Pirates looks like it's headed there.I don't do plot synopsis, Amazon has been goodly enough to do it for us all, but I'll give a quick overview.  Basically, Jack, Barbosa(a returning Geoffrey Rush, who is now working for King George in the Royal Navy), Spanish Conquisidors, and Blackbeard(Ian Mcshane) with his first mate daughter Angelica(A very sassy and fun Penelope Cruz) by his side are all on a race to find and use the Fountain of Youth.  They all have their purposes.  They all cross paths. Some of their relationships have intertwined in the past.  They all come together in the third act.  That's it.  Jack leads the way and gets in the way of all.Cast additions of Ian Mchshane and Penelope Cruz are great.  Cruz and Depp are so over the top in their scenes together that you can see right away why they were lovers.  Mcshane plays a straight up villain, more so than Rush did in the first, and about on the same level as Nighy in the second and third.  Blackbeard's ship is a great addition the usually murky gobbledy-gook superantural junk of the Pirates universe.  It's a living ship that does the will of whoever is holding a special sword.  It's creates some great ominous visuals and one great FX sequence in particular.We also get some mermaids.  They play a vital part to the plot due to our character needing a single mermaid tear, along with two cups, to activate the fountain of youth.  They are built up as such terrors at the top of the film not only are you amped up to finally see them, but you are also a little terrified.  When they show up they don't disappoint.  Sure, when their fangs drop and they attack, it's far less scar then the docile, beautiful versions that greet our sailors, but that's the way it always goes with monsters in movies.While this film is loaded with big visuals and tons of visual effects, all good BTW, it doesn't seem to go as far over the top as the previous two sequels.  It is not trying to top or outdo the previous films.  It all stays in tone and characters witht he particular story being told in this film.  Although, I have to admit, the new villainous characters are not as awe-inspiring or interesting as the ones presented in the previous installments.  As cool as the mermaids are they don't hold a candle to undead skeletal pirates or monster fishmen.  Oh well.My only complaints come down to the fact that the film is a four and the routine is wearing mildy thin.  It's not as weird as I would want, as the character of Jack Sparrow warrants.  I want more and weirder.  This is a safer film than the last two films, but not as adventureous in the right measure as the first.  Also, the editing is somewhat annoying.  It's loaded with swashbuckling but it's not played out in an exciting way.  It's all created with fast editing, basically showing great acts but without ever making it believable or grand.  We can FEEL the edits and how they are the stars of the action and not the acts themselves.  This is an annoying and common trait of action movies today.  If you're going to do sword fight then study Errol Flynn or, for a more modern example, the great(probably the greatest on film) finale sword fight between Liam Neeson and Tim Roth in Rob Roy.  Less obvious tech and more actual technique would be great!Rob Marshall does a fine job stepping up to the director's chair for series stalwart Gore Verbinski.  His sword fights, while annoyingly edited, do have a dancer's rhythm to them that I enjoyed.  Writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio also return and their simplified and more in line with the first film's storytelling is good and as usual witty.  I was happy, but hunger for more.  It's worth checking out.PS: I saw this in 2-D not 3-d.  This trend is boring and pointless.  I want my movies to suck me in with character and story not with gimmicks.  Plus, most modern 3-D with exceptions(Avatar and How to Train your Dragon spring to mind) makes the picture darker and murky for some reason, and I don't like viewing my films like it's being watched through a dirty eye glass lense covered in vasoline.  If you dig 3-D then good for you, but I get the feeling that you're not much older than 12 or maybe even 13.....",4,"Simplified, scaled back, and FINALLY makes Jack Sparrow the star of the

1390965,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004A8ZWUQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 7]","If there is one thing that is consistent with ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", you know that this film will make a ton of money in the box office.And while many thought that the ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" was finished with the third film in the trilogy, ""At World's End"" would be the last we would see of Jack Sparrow.  But the truth is, that no matter how film critics have shown their declining interest in the film, the audience have not.And with the release of the fourth film ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", once again, the audience have shown their love for this film as it became the 8th highest grossing film of all time (worldwide), the third highest grossing film of 2011 and following ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""Toy Story 3', the third highest grossing film for Disney.  The film  which cost anywhere between $150-$250 million to make, earned over $1 billion in the box office.VIDEO:""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  And as one can expect from Disney, the picture quality is fantastic.  The majority of the film is shot outdoors, at sea or during day or night and for the most part, detail is high, skin tones are natural and blacks are deep and inky.And once again, cinematographer Dariusz Wolski should receive credit for his spectacular cinematography, from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films to ""Alice in Wonderland"", Wolski is an expert in shooting in the darkest of scenes, underwater, in smoke and chaotic sequences and there is no artifacts, banding or any problematic situations in the picture quality at all.Overall, ""On Stranger Tides"" is a fantastic looking film and looks absolutely wonderful on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:What best than to present this film with a lossless English, French and Spanish 7.1 DTS-HD HR presentation.  The surround channels are heavily used in Hans Zimmer's wonderful score to the swordfights, the sound of boots walking on the deck, the sound of blasts, the growl of the mermaids and scenery ambiance, and throughout all this immersive sound, dialogue is crystal clear and understandable.The LFE for the film is wonderful and like the wonderful picture quality of the film, the lossless audio soundtrack is also fantastic!Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" comes with the following special features:Disney Second Screen - Viewers can watch the film simultaneously through their iPad or computer.Disney Second Screen Bloopers of the Caribbean - (3:25) Outtakes rom the making of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"".Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca discuss the cast members, the making of the film and its challenges during production and more.LEGO Animated Shorts: Captain Jack's Brick Tales - (5:19) Featuring five Lego animated shorts for ""Captain Jack's Brick Tales"".EXTRAS:""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" comes with a slip cover case. The Blu-ray release comes with the DVD presented in widescreen 2:40:1 - Enhanced for 169 televisions, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to popcorn action films ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" manages to incorporate the fun, swashbuckling action of Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp does a wonderful job of playing Jack Sparrow.  But one's enjoyment is subjective, especially whether or not you have felt that your passion for the film series is starting to wane a bit.After the third ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film, I have to say that ""At World's End"" left me feeling bitter because it was not a great film to end the trilogy.  But because these films make a tremendous amount of money, there is no way that we are going to see an end to this film series.  In fact, a fifth film is being planned and Johnny Depp is returning, so as long as the audience continues to come out to see the films, I don't see why Disney should stop.  People still love ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".Personally, I enjoyed the film but unlike previous ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, it felt a bit light when it came to Jack Sparrow because there is so much emphasis on other characters.  In fact, I found myself enjoying scenes with the Christian Philip  (played by Sam Claflin)and the mermaid Syrena (played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey), which for me was the replacement characters for Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters for the previous films).  But unfortunately, where Turner and Swann had staying power for three films, not sure if we are going to see Philip or Syrena ever again.While ""On Stranger Tides"" continues to be a fun, adventurous popcorn action film, I did enjoy seeing Penelope Cruz playing the character of Angelica Teach, a compassionate/cutthroat ex-lover of Jack Sparrow and Ian McShane as the legendary dark pirate Blackbeard was quite fun to watch as well.  And seeing Barbosa, it was no surprise to see his return to the film as well.But ""On Stranger Tides"" tries to showcase many other characters as well and truth be told, aside from Gibbs who has a place in the PotC films, everyone else didn't.  For example, in the first film, there was a sympathetic feeling towards Sparrow and his crew, but this time around, you really had no sympathy for anyone's crew.  If anything, you just wondered when will Jack Sparrow be back on his ship instead of being Indiana Jones/Blackbeard's grunt.  This is one side of Jack Sparrow that we have not seen in previous films and I'm not sure if I like him in such a non-commanding role.But however one feels about ""On Stranger Tides"", similar to films like ""Transformers"", these are popcorn action films that people come to see and have a good time, not for anything deep or mind-blowing.  You get action and a ton of special effects and in that sense, ""On Stranger Tides"" does not disappoint.But when it comes to this Blu-ray release, one thing that does disappoint is the fact that we are getting far less than the five disc version when it comes to special features.  Picture and lossless audio is fantastic but I was surprised to see only three special features including the audio commentary included with this release.  But it appears that Disney really is pushing for the 3D 5-disc version which has nine special features over its 2-disc counterpart which has only three minus the second screen.Overall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a fun film and from the crew fight on the Queen Anne's Revenge, Jack Sparrow's escape from British custody to the encounter with the mermaids, there are many fun action scenes in this film.  But in terms of story, I still prefer the first original film, but there is no doubt that the visuals and overall production design is much improved in this latest film.If you are a fan of the series and own the trilogy on Blu-ray, or you are just a big fan of the film or its talent, you're definitely going to want this film in your collection.  But if you are wanting the best version of this film released on Blu-ray, you may want to look into the 5-disc version over this 2-disc combo pack as Disney chose to include most of the bonus features on the 5-disc release.",4,"Blu-ray: Not the best PotC film, but still entertaining and looks great on Blu!",1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,7393,"['one', 'thing', 'consistent', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean',

There are four or five partial stories in this movie, yet not one stirs any real emotional resonance or captures that ""adventurous spirit"" these films are known for. Meanwhile, all of the various plot threads align perfectly when the action sequences need connecting. It was nearly impossible for me to ""feel"" anything for any of these characters because I couldn't grasp any of their motives. C'mon, I know it's a Summer Blockbuster, but you have to like the characters a little bit, right?Johnny Depp is so gifted, and Penelope Cruz is awesome, too! In fact, I'm sure most of the people involved with this project are extremely talented. That's what makes it so difficult to accept that they horribly misfired here. Rob Marshall's direction seems ill fitted, and too superficial. No suspense! But the two main turds here are the writers. I don't write movies. I have no clue how to do that, and yet I got an hour into this movie and started to imagine what it would have been like to focus on any one of the many subplots racing across the screen...or to focus on any one of the umpteenth relationships that were set up, and thusly tossed aside later on. My 9 year old son was bored with this film...even he had more interesting ways to get Jack Sparrow, Hector Barbossa, and Blackbeard tangled up with the infamous Fountain of Youth. How can such accomplished artists, writers, actors, and film makers, sit in an editing room, finish watching this, and then say, ""Okay...that's it! This movie is a winner!""?????It simply blows my mind.This is how my nine year old felt about Pirates-4: ""It's too complex. I liked most of it a little, but none of it a lot. Plus...they kept saying 'the fountain of youth' every five seconds. Oh...and shouldn't that Blackbeard guy have been WAY scarier?""Yep.

1390980,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B004A8ZWUQ,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","The movie opens with Mr. Gibbs from the first three movies on trial for the crime of being Captain Jack Sparrow. In a surprising twist the judge turns out to be Jack himself in a thinly veiled disguise. So how is it that nobody knows what the actual judge looks like including the other magistrates sitting around him and the dozens of people in the courtroom? This scene really sums up the movie for me. The first three films by Gore Verbinski were silly and over the top but generally fun. On Stranger Tide is often just dumb.That is in no way meant to say the Verbinski films were perfect. They most assuredly were not. In particular I felt the series ruined the Elizabeth Swann character by making her the toughest pirate captain sailing the seas. Verbinski, however, was able to keep the action fun and inventive and he was helped enormously by the great cast. It felt like the new director Rob Marshall was desperately trying to emulate Verbinski with much weaker results. The first escape sequence by Jack Sparrow may be the worst in the whole series. The fight between Jack and and his  doppleganger in the kitchen (???) seemed like a direct rip off of the first fight between Jack and Will Turner in the smithy house except not nearly as well done. There was a fight between the captive crew and Blackbeards zombies on the Queen Anne&#8217;s Revenge that felt like it was a replay of the fight on the Pearl in the first movie. And I didn&#8217;t like either fight. The great irony is that this weak imitation, which stands as easily the most poorly rated in the series, was the second highest grossing of the four films and 12th highest grossing film of all time.The action is often quite daft. In one scene Jack Sparrow is tied to a coconut tree with about thirty yards of thick rope and manages to shimmy his body up to the top of the tree. He&#8217;s show rising from the top of the tree which wouldn&#8217;t work because he would have gotten caught up in the branches being tied up and all, He then ties the rope around a coconut and gets it to wrap around another coconut tree about 50 feet away and begins bending the tree with an inhuman level of strength. When the tree snaps back Sparrow is sent flying through the air like a Loony Tunes cartoon and for all the effort it only gained him about 30 yards which he could have just walked. There were a lot of silly over the top action sequences in the previous 3 movies but Verbinski managed to keep them fun whereas in this film they&#8217;re either poor copies of better actions sequences of just dimwitted.Perhaps the biggest problem in the film is how ill defined the characters are. Philip Swift seems like the replacement for Will Turner but with none of Turner&#8217;s charm. Swift&#8217;s love interest is a mermaid who we&#8217;re supposed to feel sorry for having been abducted by Blackbeard except the film already established that mermaids true appearances are hideous and they drag men to their deaths, The movie can&#8217;t seem to decide whether Angelica, played by Penelope Cruz&#8217;s, is a master manipulator or kind hearted soul. Ian McShane is a fine actor and his initial introduction in the film is done well but his modest height hurts his physical presence and at 68 when the film came out he has a rather old and sleepy appearance. I&#8217;m a big fan of Geoffrey Rush but his Captain Barbossa just seems tired and they piled on pancake make for no apparent reason.The flim ends as nonsensically as the rest of the film. Characters act with seemingly random motivation as if the writers just decided it would be cool if a character did something regardless if it made any sense. Despite the astronomical box office take the series simply has not set itself up for future success. I have a feeling the next flim will feel the brunt of this one and if Johnny Depp were to leave the series would be dead. There are some beautiful scenes in the movie. This is one of the most expensive movies of all times and it looks good but to spend so much money around such a dumb plot is painful. I didn&#8217;t hate this movie and I watched it twice for this review but it is by far the weakest of the four Pirates movies.",3,The Quadrilogy's Weakest Entry,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,4200,"['movie', 'Mr.', 'Gibbs', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'trial', 'crime', 'being', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'surprising', 'twist', 'judge', 'out', 'be', 'Jack', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'disguise', 'So', 'how', 'nobody', 'what', 'actual', 'judge', 'looks', 'including', 'other', 'magistrates', 'sitting', 'dozens', 'people', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'really', 'up', 'movie', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'were', 'silly', 'top', 'generally', 'fun', 'Stranger', 'Tide', 'often', 'just', 'dumb.That', 'way', 'meant', 'say', 'Verbinski', 'films', 'were', 'perfect', 'most', 'assuredly', 'were', 'not', 'particular', 'felt', 'series', 'ruined', 'Elizabeth', 'Swann', 'character', 'making', 'toughest', 'pirate', 'captain', 'sailing', 'seas', 'Verbinski', 'however', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'action', 'fun', 'inventive', 'was', 'helped', 'enormously', 'great', 'cast', 'felt', 'new', 'director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'was', 'desperately', 'trying', 'emulate', 'Verbinski', 'much', 'weaker', 'results', 'first', 'escape', 'sequence', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'whole', 'series', 'fight', 'Jack', 'doppleganger', 'kitchen', 'seemed', 'direct', 'rip', 'first', 'fight', 'Jack', 'Will', 'Turner', 'smithy', 'house', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'fight', 'captive', 'crew', 'Blackbeards', 'zombies', 'Queen', 'Anne', '8217', 'Revenge', 'felt', 'was', 'replay', 'fight', 'Pearl', 'first', 'movie', 'didn', '8217', 'fight', 'great', 'irony', 'weak', 'imitation', 'easily', 'most', 'poorly', 'rated', 'series', 'was', 'second', 'highest', 'grossing', 'four', 'films', '12th', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'time.The', 'action', 'often', 'quite', 'daft', 'one', 'scene', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'tied', 'coconut', 'tree', 'thirty', 'yards', 'thick', 'rope', 'manages', 'shimmy', 'body', 'up', 'top', 'tree', '8217', 'show', 'rising', 'top', 'tree', 'wouldn', '8217', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'caught', 'up', 'branches', 'being', 'tied', 'up', 'then', 'rope', 'coconut', 'wrap', 'around', 'coconut', 'tree', '50', 'feet', 'away', 'bending', 'tree', 'inhuman', 'level', 'strength', 'When', 'tree', 'back', 'Sparrow', 'sent', 'flying', 'air', 'Loony', 'Tunes', 'cartoon', 'effort', 'only', 'gained', '30', 'yards', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'walked', 'were', 'lot', 'silly', 'top', 'action', 'sequences', 'previous', '3', 'movies', 'Verbinski', 'managed', 'keep', 'fun', 'whereas', 'film', '8217', 're', 'poor', 'copies', 'better', 'actions', 'sequences', 'just', 'dimwitted.Perhaps', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'how', 'ill', 'defined', 'characters', 'are', 'Philip', 'Swift', 'replacement', 'Will', 'Turner', 'none', 'Turner', '8217', 's', 'charm', 'Swift', '8217', 'love', 'interest', 'mermaid', 'who', '8217', 're', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'having', 'been', 'abducted', 'Blackbeard', 'film', 'already', 'established', 'mermaids', 'true', 'appearances', 'are', 'hideous', 'drag', 'men', 'deaths', 'movie', 'can', '8217', 'seem', 'decide', 'Angelica', 'played', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', '8217', 's', 'master', 'manipulator', 'kind', 'hearted', 'soul', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'fine', 'actor', 'initial', 'introduction', 'film', 'done', 'well', 'modest', 'height', 'physical', 'presence', '68', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'rather', 'old', 'sleepy', 'appearance', '8217', 'big', 'fan', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Captain', 'Barbossa', 'just', 'tired', 'piled', 'pancake', 'make', 'apparent', 'reason.The', 'flim', 'as', 'nonsensically', 'rest', 'film', 'Characters', 'act', 'seemingly', 'random', 'motivation', 'writers', 'just', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'character', 'did', 'something', 'regardless', 'made', 'sense', 'astronomical', 'box', 'office', 'take', 'series', 'simply', 'not', 'set', 'up', 'future', 'success', 'have', 'feeling', 'next', 'flim', 'will', 'feel', 'brunt', 'one', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'were', 'leave', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'are', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'expensive', 'movies', 'times', 'good', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'dumb', 'plot', 'painful', 'didn', '8217', 'hate', 'movie', 'watched', 'twice', 'review', 'far', 'weakest', 'four', 'Pirates', 'movies']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

It's hard to say where I'd rate this compared to 2-3 because I've only viewed it twice, and it might end up being a movie that is stronger with more viewings.  Part 3 to me is a bit weaker with subsequent viewings because I can't stand the lame, uninspired ""me too"" speech Elizabeth gives.  Not every damn movie has to have a speech before battle, and if it is lame it makes it all the worse.  And I can't help but feel there was so much potential for the final battle, ruined by the fact that there were 100s of ships and only 2 get stuck in some maelstrom in the worst waste of potential I have ever seen.Anyway let's get to some strong points about this movie-Filmed in 3D, 3D is strong and has incredible depth, a high quality 3D experience-Depp and Rush are great in this film.-Astrid Berg&egrave;s-Frisbey is a cutie and the sweet yet small love story was so cute.-seemed slow at first but after about half way it actually started to feel like a good ol Pirate movie again.-Pretty satisfying endingLow points-Pen&eacute;lope Cruz is not attractive, can't play any character other than a Brazilian since she can't act past her own natural accent.-Ian McShane's character isn't all that interesting, sure he's ok.  But it's hard to top such magical characters as Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa.  I found Astrid Berg&egrave;s-Frisbey's Serena a more interesting character, and would have preffered more of that story arc.  Too bad they focused on the wrong characters I think.-Rageti and Pintel were such a funny duo, they are sorely missed here.Overall the positives outweigh the negatives.  And if you have a 3D set up, it's deffinatly an enjoyable movie with high quality 3D for you to check out.

The continuation of Capt Barbossa (Rush) in the series and the addition of Blackbeard (McShane) were wonderful, even though I must say that Blackbeard came across far less evil and interesting than the previous bad guys in Dead Man's Chest and At World's End--the East India Co man and Davey Jones.  Instead, Blackbeard came across as a cardboard cutout of a bad guy and I know (from Deadwood) that McShane is a way better actor than that.I think that's part of the problem.  The new characters simply weren't up to snuff.  It would have been so much better to have brought along more of the secondary characters from the previous movies, and not just Mr Gibbs.  The main secondary character from Blackbeard's ship who provided a few funny scenes came the closest, but I couldn't even remember the name of the preacher-guy during the movie, let alone after the movie.  The love interest between him (spoilers ahead!) and the mermaid fell flat...as flat as the love interest between Capt. Jack and Angelica (Cruz).  Honestly, there seemed to be no spark there at all.  I know that Penelope Cruz is also a better actress than this.In fact, the whole movie suffered from a lack of the ol' sparkle and magic that I've come to expect from the Pirates movies.  I don't know who to blame--the scriptwriters and the new director spring to mind.  There were too many scenes that served little to no purpose plotwise and the climax of the movie was anything but.  Sure, there were some great scenes and one-liners, but the script seemed to suffer from a lack of general cohesion and the effort to be ""simpler"" than At World's End.  The story sometimes seemed to get lost and, honestly, came across amateurish at times.  The scene with the guns at the edge of the gorge really was a waste of time--yeah, it showed that Blackbeard really didn't care about his daughter, but we already knew that.  It would have been far better not knowing which way he might go up until the end than having it spelled out for us almost from the beginning.  Again, no sparks, little surprise.  It almost felt ""dumbed down"" at times.Basically, the movie galloped along from action scene to action scene and Jack displayed his wonderful wayward roguish charm and the scenery and special effects were great...but at the end, all of it felt a bit too forced and flat.  The scriptwriters should have taken another whack at it before letting it out the door.I will buy this movie when it comes out on BR, for sure, but not because it was my favorite Pirates movie.  I can only hope that the next one will be better.  Perhaps, they need to bring back the original director?  Clearly, they need to do something.

I watched the second and third films with a kind of glaze, not really following the storylines at all, but just drifting from set piece to set piece, enjoying the ride but not really keeping track of what was going on.Remedying this was among the marching orders of new-to-Pirates director Rob Marshall, a virtuoso musical film director in an era in which such craftsmen are few and far between. He's perhaps the only director capable in recent years of making good, solid musicals that even the non-fan can enjoy - among them the acclaimed TV version of Annie and the Oscar winning Chicago.Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is, in effect, a musical without songs. And it works perfectly (unlike 1972's Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, which was supposed to be a musical, and 1961's Fanny, which should have been but had its song torn out). Like a classic Hollywood or British musical film, it's lavishly mounted with magnificent sets and grand costumes. Even the dirty, filthy settings are meticulously detailed (and all look amazing in Blu-ray). The characters are larger than life, the action scenes are inventively choreographed and the story stays simple to allow for all the elements to take the forefront.On Stranger Tides has a refreshingly linear plot -- the search for the Fountain of Youth, and it has a staple element of musicals: the dual couples. Oklahoma! had Laurie, Curly, Ado Annie and Will, The Sound of Music had Maria, the Captain, Liesl and Rolf -- and this film has Jack, Angelica, Philip and Syrena. All the elements fall beautifully into place.On the Blu-ray audio commentary (thank you, bonus feature people!), director Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca express their (and Johnny Depp's) fondness for movies, expressing their excitement of using the very same beach made famous by Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster in From Here to Eternity, the remains of a hotel where Elvis appeared in Blue Hawaii and more. It's nice when the movie makers are fond of the genre and the project to which they are assigned. It shows.Penelope Cruz makes her Pirates debut with panache, power, beauty and even some warmth (deep, expressive eyes), though I would have liked to see her given more humor. She proved to be capable of sparring with Sparrow -- and gets in quite a few good lines -- but for some reason, there is a tendency for modern films to confuse feminine strength with dourness. Behold the perfect combination Diana Rigg in the 60's series The Avengers and you'll see what I mean.Love to have the commentary included, but otherwise not a ton of extras, which is a bit of a surprise. Overall though, one of the series' best.",5,"The musical that isn't, but works very well in its own way",1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,2860,"['Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'movies', 'are', 'lots', 'fun', 'kind', 'creepy', 'very', 'funny', 'mostly', 'due', 'Captain', 'Johnny/Jack', 'Depp/Sparrow', 'late', ""'ve"", 'become', 'convoluted', 'serpentine', 'watched', 'second', 'third', 'films', 'kind', 'glaze', 'not', 'really', 'following', 'storylines', 'just', 'drifting', 'set', 'piece', 'set', 'piece', 'enjoying', 'ride', 'not', 'really', 'keeping', 'track', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'on.Remedying', 'was', 'marching', 'orders', 'new-to-Pirates', 'director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'virtuoso', 'musical', 'film', 'director', 'era', 'such', 'craftsmen', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'perhaps', 'only', 'director', 'capable', 'recent', 'years', 'making', 'good', 'solid', 'musicals', 'even', 'non-fan', 'can', 'enjoy', 'acclaimed', 'TV', 'version', 'Annie', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Chicago.Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'effect', 'musical', 'songs', 'perfectly', '1972', 'Private', 'Life', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'musical', '1961', 'Fanny', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'song', 'torn', 'out', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'British', 'musical', 'film', 'lavishly', 'mounted', 'magnificent', 'sets', 'grand', 'costumes', 'Even', 'dirty', 'filthy', 'settings', 'are', 'meticulously', 'detailed', 'look', 'amazing', 'Blu-ray', 'characters', 'are', 'larger', 'life', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'inventively', 'choreographed', 'story', 'simple', 'allow', 'elements', 'take', 'forefront.On', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'refreshingly', 'linear', 'plot', 'search', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'staple', 'element', 'musicals', 'dual', 'couples', 'Oklahoma', 'had', 'Laurie', 'Curly', 'Ado', 'Annie', 'Will', 'Sound', 'Music', 'had', 'Maria', 'Captain', 'Liesl', 'Rolf', 'film', 'Jack', 'Angelica', 'Philip', 'Syrena', 'elements', 'fall', 'beautifully', 'place.On', 'Blu-ray', 'audio', 'commentary', 'bonus', 'feature', 'people', 'director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'executive', 'producer', 'John', 'DeLuca', 'express', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fondness', 'movies', 'expressing', 'excitement', 'using', 'very', 'same', 'beach', 'made', 'famous', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'remains', 'hotel', 'where', 'Elvis', 'appeared', 'Blue', 'Hawaii', 'more', 'nice', 'when', 'movie', 'makers', 'are', 'fond', 'genre', 'project', 'are', 'assigned', 'shows.Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Pirates', 'debut', 'panache', 'power', 'beauty', 'even', 'warmth', 'deep', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'given', 'more', 'humor', 'proved', 'be', 'capable', 'sparring', 'Sparrow', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'lines', 'reason', 'tendency', 'modern', 'films', 'confuse', 'feminine', 'strength', 'dourness', 'Behold', 'perfect', 'combination', 'Diana', 'Rigg', '60', 'series', 'Avengers', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean.Love', 'have', 'commentary', 'included', 'otherwise', 'not', 'ton', 'extras', 'bit', 'surprise', 'Overall', 'one', 'series', 'best']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

It lacked imagination, energy and fantasy. One example, was his hanging on to a banner and running/riding on horse drawn carts and platforms. Besides being an old and tired routine it seemded added just to inject some energy into what was a pretty tiresome movie. Other than her physical appearance Cruz added little to the movie.Second, part of that can be attributed to the script which lacked imagination and the dark, foreboding comedy and fantasy we've come to expect. The Cruz as daughter, the mermaids and the fountain-of-youth subplots seemed to be something borrowed as a shortcut through a lack of creative effort; to show us something truly fantastical. The mermaid graphics besides being cheap looking seemed more appropriate for showcasing a Victoria's Secret modeling exhibition. The sword fighting scenes looked like a high school stage revue. And, of course, the same old tavern look. Thus the hackneyed flow to the story.

So, when the opportunity arose for me to set sail once again On Stranger Tides, how could I resist? Personally, I enjoy all three previous entries in the series, with my only complaint being that there are no deleted scenes on the DVD of Dead Man's Chest (some scenes were filmed, but ultimately cut; I think it's always nice to include deleted scenes from a movie and know why they were excised, as some think the scenes were absolutely neccessary whlle others might might not, but enjoy seeing them nonetheless), and only two deleted scenes were included on the DVD of At World's End (I know that twenty minutes worth of footage was cut from the film, including a scene where Admiral Norrington tries to persuade Governor Swann from killing Davy Jones, and for some reason, those twenty minutes were not included on the DVD as deleted or extended scenes). But I digress.This latest voyage with the Pirates Of The Caribbean is another gold mine for Walt Disney Pictures. The twists keep on coming, there's still action & romance a-plenty, and of course, a dash of rougish charm. Captain Jack is back, and this time, he's joined by yet another lovely young lady who is easy on the eyes (as well as a good actress), and Barbossa has apparently switched sides. As with the previous films, the plot is very engaging, and you're never bored for a moment. The score is excellent, remeniscent of the first three movies while incorporating new themes as well.Biblically speaking, there is barely any offensive content, as is usual with Disney films, and consistent with the previous three movies. There is violence, but as expected, it is never graphic and mostly bloodless. There's one moderate imprecation used (during the film's climax), but it's appropriate, given the situation. And of course, there is the innuendo, but given that it's a pirate film, but a Disney movie at heart, it's always light and humorous. I admit, I had my reservations about the mermaids when I saw the trailer (I thought, ""Do they HAVE to be topless? This is a DISNEY movie."") As it turns out, my reservations were unnecessary, as the screenwriters and director were discreet in filming the scenes with the mermaids. Nothing is shown. There is a Christian missionary in the film, and he is portrayed in a positive light, unusual for a non-Christian movie, but of course very commendable. Though he IS on the receiving end of some light-hearted quips, his calling is never disrespected, and as per the previous movies, God's name is never taken in vain. (It's a Disney film, and with the disappointing exception of the recently released John Carter, which I have not seen, Disney has respected the Name of God, at least when it comes to their movies; in television, that's another story).

1391029,A39LOCOS6YYP0A,B004A8ZWUQ,"Hazel West ""highlandwriter15 (Author of 'Free...","[1, 8]","So I wrote these for my blog originally, but I decided to put them up here as well. If you liked this, read the others because they're meant to play off each other.Pirates of the Caribbean IV: On Stranger TidesI actually had some better hopes for this one than the others when I saw the trailers. Why, I don't know, maybe because I was simply glad they had FINALLY managed to ditch Elizabeth! But no, in getting rid of her, they had to recruit ANOTHER really annoying and pointless female character...but I'll get to that later.At first glance, this plot line at least seems more normal than the last two. They're trying to find the Fountain of Youth and that's a good adventure plot line, very cliche, and not so bad for a swashbuckler. But do not be deceived. This one ended up being even more weird than the others, if that can be possible.The opening in this movie where Jack Sparrow is with the king and all, was so very typical of him. Just random stuff he does. The only thing this scene did for me was make me REALLY want a cream puff...badly. I LOVE cream puffs and they don't sell the blasted things in theater concession stands so in the long run, it just made me angry. I liked the carriage chase through London, that was cool, but it would have been cooler if it had been a Dick Turpin highwayman movie or something. Zorro pulled this kind of scene off better anyway.And so the crew gets back together and get their plan together to go and find the fountain of youth. However... and here is a huge rant coming...This movie, above all the others, made me want to hit my head against the wall because of the fact that they HAD to use Black Beard as their main villain. They could have easily taken the character they created and given him a different name and no one would have cared. Whoever this character was, he was certainly not Black Beard as in Edward Teach. They did ZERO research for this movie. I mean, seriously, if you're going to use an historical character, then at least TRY to do a little bit of research. All they even needed to do was listen to the Horrible Histories song about Black Beard. The only thing they got right was his ship's name, Queen Anne's Revenge.(And here's a point I would like to make. Black Beard was around during the reign of Queen Anne. But guess who was the king during this movie? George II!) But they gave him a 'magic sword' and a-- wait for it--zombie crew!!! The worst part about the zombie crew was the fact that they weren't even a huge plot. They never did anything! Why bother with zombies when they have no point? They never did anything zombie-ish, they didn't even try to turn anyone into zombies. And his tiny ship in a bottle collection was just weird. I can see Poseidon having a collection like this, but Black Beard?And that's not even the worst part. He has a daughter. Yep, a daughter. Like one of those teenage girl books that are always the same (""Black Beard's Daughter"") Would you read it if it was a book? Then why would we want to watch it? And even worse (yes it even gets worse) she had some far-off fling with Jack Sparrow apparently. Seriously he's too old for her and by the fourth movie, I think we can all assume that Jack Sparrow is not physically or mentally capable of actually being in a relationship with anyone. And she's almost worse than Elizabeth because she has more angst. I think I groaned audibly when I saw her come onto scene for the first time. She was actually dressed as Jack Sparrow...Okay, I'll take this chance to introduce another character in this movie: Philip whats-his name. Congratulations, Philip, you won the award for being the most pointless character in the history of story telling! *applause* Seriously, this guy had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The only thing he even managed to do was get the blasted mermaid--who he had a brief love affair with--to cry (I'll get to the mermaids later) and then he dies right afterward for no reason at all! I do know why they cast him though, and that was for the ladies, because, let's face it, he was the only remotely handsome guy in this movie since we got rid of Will and Norrington. Yes, I'm onto them...Okay, so the mermaids... Frankly I don't know much about traditional mermaids, but if you think of them kind of like silkies, I guess this could go over. I did not approve of the scene where they push the poor men out as bait for the mermaids. Very mean, that! They don't want to be pieces of meat for evil female beasties! And this scene could have been half as long as it was. We got the picture after the third guy was drowned, and then they finally caught a mermaid who was awkwardly half naked through the whole movie. Philip was a gentleman though and gave her his shirt. This was another thing he was good for; a walking armoire.Oh yes, and the only part I liked about this movie was Barbosa. Seriously, this guy should have been the star because he was just as great in this movie as he was in the rest. I did enjoy all the parts he was in, especially since he didn't care for Jack Sparrow any more than I did. Watching them work together was funny because we all know Barbosa is the better pirate. And of course it was Jack who got them captured by the Spanish who were also looking for the Fountain. The escape scene with the palm trees? I'm not even going to go there. But I think it almost surpassed the water wheel. Actually, yes it did.So back to the reason why this movie was even weirder than the others. The way they get to the Fountain of Youth, was just plain odd. Why on earth is the whole place upside-down? I didn't get this at all, and the whole kind of weird whatever that was going on was just...weird. I can't describe it. So you can guess that a battle ensues. Barbosa was awesome; his fight with Black Beard was the best part of this movie, and amazingly the only fight scene in the whole series that looked like a real fight scene, but then the ones with Barbosa usually did. So Black Beard is killed, obviously, because he's bad. Barbosa gets the Black Pearl back (it's his ship, not Jack's!) from the bottles where Black Beard had been keeping them, and in the end he maroons Jack and Black Beard's daughter on an island. That was the worst part of the whole movie. Why? Because it foretold tales of doom that there would be YET ANOTHER SEQUEL!

1391031,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004A8ZWUQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[23, 32]","It's not easy to impersonate Captain Jack Sparrow. For one thing, he's got that mincing walk. Still, someone's going around passing himself off as our favorite pirate, recruiting sea hands for a run at Ponce de Leon's mythical Fountain of Youth. And this poser isn't the only one after the key to life eternal. The Spanish are curious. The British are curious because the Spanish are curious. Edward Teach, a.k.a. the notorious pirate and dark sorcerer Blackbeard, is another buttinski. And, the honest-to-gosh real Captain Jack Sparrow, who had just about given up his own quest for the Fountain of Youth, reinvigorates himself to the cause. He has a map and all.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is a hell of a long title, and it's a fairly long movie. I liked it enough that I'm recommending it. But I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous three films (including the way over-the-top AT WORLD'S END). Turns out, I missed Kiera Knightley and Legolas something fierce. Turns out, Jack Sparrow is better served when he's coming at you sideways, when he's not featured as so obviously the central character. Partly, it's that, at this stage, we know that Jack Sparrow is a good guy, no matter that he walks like a silly ponce and that he sports sinister gold teeth and heavy eyeliner. By now, it's difficult for the film to employ trickeration on a savvy audience. And Jack Sparrow loses a bit of something when you know without a doubt that he's an honorable scoundrel. Even if he's still peculiar in his habits and methods.Saving the ever reliable Geoffrey Rush, Johnny Depp has no actor with enough of a presence for him to effectively bounce off from, and right there I guess I just elevated Orlando Bloom's acting chops. The new characters don't resonate for me, not Penelope Cruz's winsome pirate's daughter (and Sparrow's old flame), not Ian McShane's cursed Blackbeard, and certainly not that actor who plays the uncharismatic missionary/clerk/all around boredom-on-legs.Hell, I even miss that short, bald pirate and his mate with the wooden eye.No surprise, the film is visually stunning; it looks very good. It's loud, bombastic, and drawn out. The f/x and stunts are rather spectacular. As ever, Jack Sparrow's antics are to be appreciated. I particularly liked the scene in the British king's palace, in which the movie audience sees a captive Jack, in delightful off-the-cuff fashion, plan and stage his eventual escape, a key component of which is that chandeliered dessert.The film tries to distract you with plot candy such as lost magical chalices and mermaid's tears, and zombies and a Keith Richards cameo. But it all feels like filler. There's something missing from the core of the story. And Jack Sparrow, unruffled and odd and improvisational, is still best when utilized as misdirection. But, for that to be, you need someone else to also focus on. That missionary dullard sure can't cut the mustard or capture big screen interest. Which leaves Jack shouldering the hero tropes. Here, he's clearly the hero and central protagonist and even the lead in the love story. Jack, you've gone all domesticated, yo. It doesn't quite suit you.I will say that Astrid Berges-Frisbey, who plays the mermaid Syrena, is a stunner. I do challenge the laws of gravity which always seemed to place her hair in such a strategic way that Disney is able to maintain its PG-13 rating.",3,Has the ship sailed?,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,3398,"['not', 'easy', 'impersonate', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'one', 'thing', 'got', 'mincing', 'walk', 'Still', 'someone', 'going', 'passing', 'off', 'favorite', 'pirate', 'recruiting', 'sea', 'hands', 'run', 'Ponce', 'de', 'Leon', 'mythical', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'poser', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'key', 'life', 'eternal', 'Spanish', 'are', 'curious', 'British', 'are', 'curious', 'Spanish', 'are', 'curious', 'Edward', 'Teach', 'a.k.a', 'notorious', 'pirate', 'dark', 'sorcerer', 'Blackbeard', 'buttinski', 'honest-to-gosh', 'real', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'about', 'given', 'up', 'own', 'quest', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'cause', 'map', 'all.PIRATES', 'THE', 'CARIBBEAN', 'ON', 'STRANGER', 'TIDES', 'hell', 'long', 'title', 'fairly', 'long', 'movie', 'liked', ""'m"", 'recommending', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'previous', 'three', 'films', 'including', 'way', 'over-the-top', 'AT', 'WORLD', 'END', 'out', 'missed', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'Legolas', 'something', 'fierce', 'out', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'better', 'served', 'when', 'coming', 'sideways', 'when', 'not', 'featured', 'so', 'obviously', 'central', 'character', 'Partly', 'stage', 'know', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'good', 'guy', 'matter', 'silly', 'ponce', 'sports', 'sinister', 'gold', 'teeth', 'heavy', 'eyeliner', 'now', 'difficult', 'film', 'employ', 'trickeration', 'savvy', 'audience', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'bit', 'something', 'when', 'know', 'doubt', 'honorable', 'scoundrel', 'Even', 'still', 'peculiar', 'habits', 'methods.Saving', 'ever', 'reliable', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'actor', 'enough', 'presence', 'effectively', 'bounce', 'off', 'right', 'guess', 'just', 'elevated', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'acting', 'chops', 'new', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'not', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'winsome', 'pirate', 'daughter', 'Sparrow', 'old', 'flame', 'not', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'cursed', 'Blackbeard', 'certainly', 'not', 'actor', 'who', 'uncharismatic', 'missionary/clerk/all', 'boredom-on-legs.Hell', 'even', 'miss', 'short', 'bald', 'pirate', 'mate', 'wooden', 'eye.No', 'surprise', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'very', 'good', 'loud', 'bombastic', 'out', 'f/x', 'stunts', 'are', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'ever', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'antics', 'are', 'be', 'appreciated', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scene', 'British', 'king', 'palace', 'movie', 'audience', 'captive', 'Jack', 'delightful', 'off-the-cuff', 'fashion', 'plan', 'stage', 'eventual', 'escape', 'key', 'component', 'chandeliered', 'dessert.The', 'film', 'tries', 'distract', 'plot', 'candy', 'such', 'lost', 'magical', 'chalices', 'mermaid', 'tears', 'zombies', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'cameo', 'feels', 'filler', 'something', 'missing', 'core', 'story', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'unruffled', 'odd', 'improvisational', 'still', 'best', 'when', 'utilized', 'misdirection', 'be', 'need', 'someone', 'else', 'also', 'focus', 'missionary', 'dullard', 'sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cut', 'mustard', 'capture', 'big', 'screen', 'interest', 'Which', 'Jack', 'shouldering', 'hero', 'tropes', 'Here', 'clearly', 'hero', 'central', 'protagonist', 'even', 'lead', 'love', 'story', 'Jack', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'domesticated', ""n't"", 'quite', 'suit', 'you.I', 'will', 'say', 'Astrid', 'Berges-Frisbey', 'who', 'mermaid', 'Syrena', 'stunner', 'do', 'challenge', 'laws', 'gravity', 'always', 'seemed', 'place', 'hair', 'such', 'strategic', 'way', 'Disney', 'able', 'maintain', 'PG-13', 'rating']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

1391036,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B004A8ZWUQ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 3]","The saga is going on and will never stop. The pirates are eternal and Jack Sparrow's fame is eternal since he discovered the Fountain of Youth. It is not a master piece but it is very well done and highly entertaining.We expect and we get all the battles, fights, struggles, duels or whatever with the pirates on one side, the English on the other side and the Spaniards on the third side. That coin is definitely magical with its three sides. The interest in these battles is the sites, the costumes and the details. The English king, the German George, the one who brought Handel to England, I guess, is a fat slob and I am amazed they still can find actors to play such roles. They must be highly handicapped in real life.The treasure chase is original again and this time we have to go up more often than down and the fountain of youth is higher than its source. But this time there are no monsters, monkeys, spiders, hardly one snake, no crocodiles, no sharks or whatever. The only exotic beings are mermaids. They must have mobilized the whole Olympic swim team to take care of the flotilla of mermaids that attack the poor sailors. I must admit the love affair between the Catholic missionary and the mermaid is sentimental enough to be dramatic.On another hand they always use some family connections which are both false and true, just like all the sworn promises are both truthful and fakes, and the promises are always respected and yet always turned around and broken, not directly, as if it were an accident. Here it is very useful to get rid of a couple of old pirates that will no longer be there next time and that will be a good thing. They deserve to retire or be marooned on some desert island.So enjoy this long film the way it has to be enjoyed, like a beautiful piece of entertainment and a very well performed and acted piece of cinema.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,I would have liked to be mesmerized.,1308528000,"06 20, 2011",2011,1880,"['saga', 'going', 'will', 'never', 'stop', 'pirates', 'are', 'eternal', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'fame', 'eternal', 'discovered', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'not', 'master', 'piece', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'highly', 'entertaining.We', 'expect', 'get', 'battles', 'fights', 'struggles', 'duels', 'pirates', 'one', 'side', 'English', 'other', 'side', 'Spaniards', 'third', 'side', 'coin', 'definitely', 'magical', 'three', 'sides', 'interest', 'battles', 'sites', 'costumes', 'details', 'English', 'king', 'German', 'George', 'one', 'who', 'brought', 'Handel', 'England', 'guess', 'fat', 'slob', 'am', 'amazed', 'still', 'can', 'find', 'actors', 'play', 'such', 'roles', 'must', 'be', 'highly', 'handicapped', 'real', 'life.The', 'treasure', 'chase', 'original', 'again', 'time', 'have', 'go', 'up', 'more', 'often', 'down', 'fountain', 'youth', 'higher', 'source', 'time', 'are', 'monsters', 'monkeys', 'spiders', 'hardly', 'one', 'snake', 'crocodiles', 'sharks', 'only', 'exotic', 'beings', 'are', 'mermaids', 'must', 'have', 'mobilized', 'whole', 'Olympic', 'swim', 'team', 'take', 'care', 'flotilla', 'mermaids', 'attack', 'poor', 'sailors', 'must', 'admit', 'love', 'affair', 'Catholic', 'missionary', 'mermaid', 'sentimental', 'enough', 'be', 'dramatic.On', 'hand', 'always', 'use', 'family', 'connections', 'are', 'false', 'true', 'just', 'sworn', 'promises', 'are', 'truthful', 'fakes', 'promises', 'are', 'always', 'respected', 'yet', 'always', 'turned', 'around', 'broken', 'not', 'directly', 'were', 'accident', 'Here', 'very', 'useful', 'get', 'rid', 'couple', 'old', 'pirates', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'there', 'next', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'deserve', 'retire', 'be', 'marooned', 'desert', 'island.So', 'enjoy', 'long', 'film', 'way', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'very', 'well', 'performed', 'acted', 'piece', 'cinema.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

1391042,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B004A8ZWUQ,Jason,"[3, 4]","To be honest, the movie bored me.  Sure, there is ""action"" in nearly every other scene, but it's all incredibly predictable from beginning to end.  On top of that, Johnny Depp's mannerisms as Capt. Jack Sparrow have grown old, and Penelope Cruz is not a suitable replacement for Keira Knightley.  Not by a long shot.  Aside from Cruz, the usually cast is there: Geoffrey Rush as Barbarossa, Ian McShane as Blackbeard, the monkey as the monkey.Did I mention this film is roughly 43 hours long?  Well, maybe not that long, but that's how long it feels.  Honestly, how many sword fights, ridiculously complex escape plans, and identical score accompaniment can there be?  It's a revolving door of POTC, with only minor additions - some of which are subtraction by addition.  For instance, there is a mannequin missionary portrayed with concrete-settling zeal by Sam Claflin, and let's not forget Oscar Jaenada as ""The Spaniard,"" a character so stiff it made Barbarossa's wooden run (hop) a mile.The plot revolves around Sparrow and an imposter Sparrow, who is rounding up a crew, meeting up and butting heads while mutually racing, along with the Spaniards, for the legendary Fountain of Youth.  The aforementioned paths' also cross with a British ship captained by a semi-reformed Barbarossa, and Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by Blackbeard and Sparrow's former lover Angelica - who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter.Long title, long film.  Nothing terribly new for the series, and only fans will like it a lot.  Fans of the purely aesthetic will appreciate the filming.  Some very majestic scenes on open water.  Fans of the series will probably love it.  Pirate fans will hang the movie posters in their spare rooms.

That does not appear to be the case with the present film however. It approaches the first film in the quality of script and tight story telling.All the elements that make the Pirates movies so enjoyable are present. There is a ton of madcap action, supernatural thrills, and wonderfully likeable characters. The mermaid hunt/attack scene is the highlight here with the contrast between the beauty and ferocity of the mermaids being delightfully creepy. On the other hand I'm not really sure I understood what was going on with that whole mermaid Spider-Man webbing thing. Only a handful of the characters from the original trilogy return. Of course, you can't have a Pirates movie without Johnny Depp playing Jack Sparrow. The new characters did not entirely come up to the level set by the originals.

Sparrow isn't alone on that journey though, because Black Beard (Ian McShane) and Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) are also looking for the fountain. Jack finds himself, a prisoner of Black Beard and the former love of his life Angelica Malon (Penelope Cruz), who just might be Black Beard's long lost daughter.Depp has already signed on for more sequels, that's how much he loves playing Jack Sparrow, but before he puts on the eye liner again, he needs a script that's worthy to him and the character. The last 2 sequels would have been better if they were a lot shorter and if the stories weren't so confusing with too many double crosses.On Stranger Tides has a story you can wrap your brain around and makes a good adventure/fantasy due to having zombies and dangerous mermaids and etc, but Jack Sparrow is too heroic this time around, which is pretty out of character. Despite being the main star, Sparrow also feels as if he's just on the outside looking in through a lot of the film as well. While Ian McShane, is well cast as Black Beard but is the weakest villain of the films due to being pretty under-used and not as threatening as Davy Jones or Barbosa.While the film would have felt more alive and memorable if the original director, Gore Verbinski came back. Rob Mashall tried hard with this film, but Verbinksi's films were at least great to look at with well shot sword fights and ship battles. After the first film blew me away, I never felt as if any of the sequels lived up to their potential though and On Stranger Tides is no exception. It kind of just floats along until it's time to get to the fountain of youth, so thank god it wasn't almost 3 hours. I really hope, they at least try harder to give us a film as good as the first with part 5.",3,"A decent fantasy/adventure, but not the best of the series",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,1836,"['Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'back', 'now', 'looking', 'fountain', 'youth', 'Sparrow', ""n't"", 'alone', 'journey', 'Black', 'Beard', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Barbosa', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'are', 'also', 'looking', 'fountain', 'Jack', 'prisoner', 'Black', 'Beard', 'former', 'love', 'life', 'Angelica', 'Malon', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'Black', 'Beard', 'long', 'lost', 'daughter.Depp', 'already', 'signed', 'more', 'sequels', 'how', 'much', 'playing', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'eye', 'liner', 'again', 'script', 'worthy', 'character', 'last', '2', 'sequels', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'were', 'lot', 'shorter', 'stories', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'confusing', 'too', 'many', 'double', 'crosses.On', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'story', 'can', 'wrap', 'brain', 'good', 'adventure/fantasy', 'due', 'having', 'zombies', 'dangerous', 'mermaids', 'etc', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'too', 'heroic', 'time', 'pretty', 'character', 'being', 'main', 'star', 'Sparrow', 'also', 'just', 'outside', 'looking', 'lot', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'well', 'cast', 'Black', 'Beard', 'weakest', 'villain', 'films', 'due', 'being', 'pretty', 'under-used', 'not', 'as', 'threatening', 'Davy', 'Jones', 'Barbosa.While', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'more', 'alive', 'memorable', 'original', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'came', 'back', 'Rob', 'Mashall', 'tried', 'hard', 'film', 'Verbinksi', 'films', 'were', 'least', 'great', 'look', 'well', 'shot', 'sword', 'fights', 'ship', 'battles', 'first', 'film', 'away', 'never', 'felt', 'sequels', 'lived', 'up', 'potential', 'though', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'exception', 'kind', 'just', 'floats', 'along', 'time', 'get', 'fountain', 'youth', 'so', 'thank', 'god', 'was', ""n't"", 'almost', '3', 'hours', 'really', 'hope', 'least', 'try', 'harder', 'give', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'part', '5']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

They take him to the king of Spain and the man talks of the Fountain of Youth and Ponce De Leon.  Meanwhile Captain Jack Sparrow is on trial and he escapes and is captured again and taken to the king of England who wants to know the secrets and location of the Fountain of Youth. At the same time, an imposter Jack Sparrow is recruiting for a crew to go look for the Fountain of Youth but the real captain is Blackbeard and his daughter.  So now we have three competing groups of people searching for and seeking the benefits of the same prize.While this movie had some good spots and lots of action I actually found it boring at times.  Too many scenes were just dark and foggy and walking through the forest or swamp at night.  I also found the dialog to be too overdone and frankly not interesting.  The action scenes were great but they were separated with dull script and dark scenes.  Only Captain Jack Sparrow is the star in this movie and Penelope Cruz as Angelica just didn't do a great job.  Geoffrey Rush playing Captain Hector Barbossa was the pirate leading the English expedition in this movie and his role was fairly good as well as Ian McShane who played Blackbeard.Over all the movie was Jack escapes, Jack is captured, Jack changes teams, Jack escapes, Jack is captured, Jack changes teams, over and over and over!  For the limited plot the movie just seemed too long.  I would rate this 5 stars as the special effects were good and Jack's escape scenes were funny but this edition of the movie series just doesn't expand the characters and the story was to repetitious of the first three movies.

Thrills, laughs, scares, they're all there. However, it didn't have anywhere near the ambition and scope of the last couple of Pirates movies, ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World's End"", nor the variety of characters.On that last point, there aren't many ""normal"" characters this time, like the previous films' Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) or Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), for the larger-than-life characters to contrast with and stand out against. Here, nearly everyone is a big, eccentric character... Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa, Ian McShane's Blackbeard, among others, which eventually makes everything feel somewhat over the top. Making these characters seem even more eccentric is the fact that there isn't a big, ambitious story for them to fill this time, just a fairly modest one about different interests racing to reach the Fountain of Youth.Despite the smaller, less epic story, there are some high points in the movie, however, including a terrific set piece involving Blackbeard and his crew, with a conscripted Jack Sparrow along for the ride, trying to lure a school of mermaids into a trap, in order to secure the tears of one of the lovely but deadly creatures (the tears being needed to activate the Fountain of Youth once it's found). The whole mermaid sequence starts out bad for the hunters then gets worse, eventually resembling the ""Pirates"" version of a fire fight with the Vietcong. It's something to see.I could tell you a few more things, some good and some less so, about the movie. But in the end, if you liked the other ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, you'll probably enjoy this one enough to justify a trip to the theater.

The majority of the effects are after the first half hour of the film.Honorable mention effects included swords being thrust through a door (20%) or being pointed towards you (30% 3 times), a boney hand (30%), flakes falling from an explosion (25%), and the grumpy monkey (25%). There is also a real nice 10% sequence involving a water drop.The 3D in itself is very good but Disney did struggle with scene framing, focusing and lighting, to best benefit a 3D film. I should clarify that the focusing issue is just the blurring of foreground objects to draw the viewers' attention to where the director wants it. This tactic has been used a lot in recent years for normal movies but it is just not conducive to a good 3D viewing experience.Don't get me wrong, this is a worthy addition to any 3D collection. 3D cartoons are easy to produce but for real life 3D, there is a definite learning curve.***  Jack and the gang are great in 3D  ***MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different.

After all how much Pirates can one take?  Still I found myself being pulled into this movie.  It did what it was meant to do.  Entertain.  I wondered how this one would be without the  other two main actors from the three previous Pirate films, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, but it wasn't long into the film before I forgot that they existed.  In fact, if anything this film proved was that they're not needed at all.  Johnny Depp and exceptional new addition, Penelope Cruz carry this film on their strong shoulders without effort and for them this film is an adventure.  Those two worked together in a film called ""Blow"" many years ago.  In this Pirate film we're given Mermaids.  These aren't your innocent mythical creatures you associate Mermaids to be though.  They appear that way at first, but can be deadly fatal as well.  There is also Blackbeard making an appearance as a nasty Pirate racing the crew to capture the Fountain of Youth and killing any that get in his way.

I also loved the mermaids (the song the first one sings is beatiful and haunting) and just the overall LOOK of the film. There were some great action sequences and I thought the introduction of Blackbeard was well done. Penelope Cruz (whom I was worried about before I saw this...I mean, a love interest for Jack Sparrow? Dicey) did a great job and I liked her character.Some things I didn't like...the 'zombie' crew of Blackbeard's. They aren't explained (the rest of the crew is tricked into serving) and I can see no reason why they couldn't just have been regular pirates. The Spanish...why are they there? They aren't really a threat and their appearance at the end seems to be for no reason other than to speed up the ending by creating a bit of extra tension. They seemed more like plot devices than part of the story. And then, loathe though I am to admit it (being a pretty big fan of the first three movies) but I felt like a lot of this movie had been seen before. I mean, many characters reappear (but not Will and Elizabeth, which I thought was sad), and many of the action sequences felt that they'd been done before -- there's the 'Jack flying through the air to escape (twice!)), the ship being destroyed, the hiking through the tropical island, etc.Overall, I think it was a good movie and I'll probably buy it at some point if for nothing else than I Love Jack Sparrow and the mermaids were amazing.

The plot is basically another variation on the treasure hunt, although this time they are looking for the fountain of youth. Capt. Barbossa, played again by Geoffrey Rush, is also after it, allied with the British crown. Blackbeard, played by Ian McShane, is the third contender and he's accompanied by his daughter, played by Penelope Cruz. Although it's basically a simple plot, there are various twists and turns that are hard to follow, partly because of the strong accents. My husband couldn't follow it all, having not seen the prior film, and I'm not sure I did either. It also simply dragged on too long - it seemed a little caught up in itself, and the cast seemed a little caught up in themselves (most of the time having more fun than us I suspect.)The settings and special effects are great though, as they have been in the other films. A mermaid scene is especially impressive, and helped save this film from 1 or 2 star status for me.

I myself, maybe I might be overrating it, but I loved this movie. I thought it was much closer to the fun and surprise of the first movie, and not the bad dialogue and pacing issues of the second and third. Depp was great as usual, the new villain was awesome, and the movie was so much fun! It wasn't flawless, but it was really good.Now as for this package, I would be more than happy to buy it. However, Disney really did a good job of ripping off the buyers who don't have a 3D TV.This is not the only edition of the movie on Blu-Ray, but this is the best one to buy. The five disc set consists of The 3D Blu Ray disc of the movie, a standard Blu Ray edition, a special features disc on a REGULAR blu-ray, a DVD copy, and a Digital Copy of the film. So what's the problem? Well me myself, I do not own a 3D player, but I love special features on Blu-Ray discs and for DVD's, so I like to buy the edition where I can have all of my special features.However, what Disney did with this release is they put the standard Blu-Ray disc with all of the special features ONLY IN THIS RELEASE! In the other Blu Ray release of this film, it only includes the movie on Blu-Ray and the Movie on DVD. No special Features Disc to be found, but it is in this version.This is really scummy by Disney because not only do standard people who don't want a copy of it in 3D get ripped off of special features, but also us who like our features will have to dig out some more money to pay for it. This edition is about 5-10 dollars more expensive than the standard Blu Ray and not only because of the extra disc, but because of the 3D!It really makes me annoyed because I love special features, and I thought this movie was really good! But I am going to have a tough decision to make whether to buy this edition or not. I don't know, what do you guys think? Me myself? I might not even end up buying the movie because of this.

If the review was just for his acting, I'd give it a four star but it's not and the rest of the cast just blew it. Four things majorly wrong with this movie compared to the other three:1. No powerful water scenes. Come on, a movie based on water has Johnny running through the streets of England is just pathetic to me. There were no thrilling boat scenes at all other than to get somewhere in land.  I'm not spoiling it, I'm just saying, lame.2. No scary pirates. Black Beard was very interesting until he showed up, then it went straight down hill from there. Compared to Barbossa who was undead and Davy Jones with his tentacle thingies which were scary, this guy is a bummer.3. No Will, No Elizabeth. Come on, need I say more?4. Penelope Cruz. And last but not least, this woman.  Please don't think I'm not a fan, ok yes I'm not a fan, but please stop putting her in movies!

1391147,A1EX4410F46C8O,B004A8ZWUQ,"Matt32 ""LIGHT WEIGHT""","[1, 3]","It has been a while since a film has struck me the way Pirates 4 did. I would have to say, the best I can compare it to is Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  It was an ok movie, I liked it, although I can't really say why I did.  Its confusing, while you have soooo many complaints its just something you cannot say you disliked.The basic plot of Stranger Tides is the Fountain of Youth's existence has come to light and England, Spain, and cutthroats are all racing to find it.  Some have maps, others have Jack to lead.  Some want it for glory, some want it to destroy, and some want it to try and stop a prophecy of their own death.  A breath of fresh air as far as plot goes.  Jack actually organizes a rescue or 2 rather than planning his own (although there are plenty of his classic escapes)  All in all, A+ for whoever thought up this concept.  Mermaids actually play a huge role in Stranger Tides as well.  About time!  I think we all knew eventually they would make their way in though, come on, whats a sea story without one?!Pirates 4 had real potential to be something great.  While it wasn't a bad movie, it was by no means what it could have been.  There is a lot of action, a few drastic changes of environment, and new characters.  However, some of those attributes also contribute to the film's weak points.  There seems to be a lot of disconnection between 3 & 4.BEFORE YOU SAY I must not have watched the 3rd one because it ended with Barbossa losing a part of his chart to Sparrow, who ran off in search of the Fountain of Youth, and Barbossa was captain of the Black Pearl, yes, I do realize this.  It did set up On Stranger Tides.  However, when I say there is disconnection, I meant from some key characters.  I felt some important elements were left out and some loose ends need to be tied up.  I know if we didn't introduce new characters and get off of the Flying Dutchmen subject Pirates would just end up being a tired series of recycled material.  But still, I felt like some things could have been faded in and out better.  Possibly it was just the extreme shock of a completely new storyline that wouldn't take 3 films to finish.I won't put in any spoilers, but there are some events that have led up to Pirates 4 that we never saw or had a clue about (such as where was Black Beard when the Brethren met, he is a pirate after all and I would think with his magic he would have played a key role in imprisoning Calypso).  The absence of Bloom and Knightley is unexplained.  While they both started taking roles in 3 that would seperate them from the main idea of Pirates, Stranger Tides makes it feel like they are trying to completely erase that they ever existed.  A lot of supporting characters that made the films have been removed and that is why Jack Sparrow isn't very entertaining in my opinion.  What made Jack such a great character was his company, the way he interacted with other people and he is just lacking material to work with in Stranger Tides.Blackbeard was a welcome addition, but he was very much out of left field (much like Jack's love interest Angelica, who we had no idea even existed until now).  I know it was time for a new villian, but ease them in, don't just slap Blackbeard down with all the characters knowing who he was and fearing him worse than anything on the sea.  Surely as much sailing as they have done they would have at least mentioned him by now.  He sticks out like a sore thumb.Another complaint is the movie's production is not near as good as the first 3.  The soundtrack both in score and quality, the grunge-like appearance of the actual filming, and some of the acting is shoddy.  Giffiths' King George is so horrible I had to turn my head.  There is a lot of action in the film that builds really good suspense, but its all kind of like a play-by-play.  Jack's opening escape scene is so awkward and unbelievable until its hard to watch.  Its almost like they have ran out of ways for him to jump on and hang off of things.While I have a lot of complaints there is still something about this film I liked.  I would say its an ok addition to the series and would serve as a good time filler while they work on a Pirates that will rule all pirate movies.  I pray they make a 5th to redeem the winning streak that I felt was nearly ended by Stranger Tides.  The title does serve the movie well as you get an incredibly new and interesting story line.  If you liked the first 3, this movie will give you your pirates fix, but it won't be something you rush out to see for the 2nd time in a week.  Sparrow fans may love the extreme focus put on Jack.  Gibbs was luckily brought back as I felt he was always such a great characters.  Barbossa plays a big role in this film and has some twists and turns of his own that made me actually like him for once (he kind of got annoying to me after he came to life, seemed like they forced him back into existing).I suggest this film for Pirates fans but please lower your expectations.  You're going to get all that good action that you are used to but you're going to get a lot of confusion and boring attempts at thickening the plot to go with it.",3,An ok addition to the

(SPOILERS: Jack get a sword because a soldier who's giving him chase decides to leave it behind on a table?  We never see how Jack actually gets the chalices?)  And those little things did pull me out of the movie a bit.  But the biggest problem was the ""love story.""  Almost halfway through the film we're introduced to a young good-looking kid who's sole job is to preach the gospel and save souls.  Boring.  This is a pirate movie and the pirates are the heroes which means an uninteresting goody-goody bible-thumper suddenly showing up is not gonna cut it.  Now, if they'd set this up in the opening teaser where they show him out spreading the word and he gets attacked and beaten by pirates, then we're reintroduced to him halfway through...... I'm a little more on his side.  But then he falls in love with a mermaid who ALSO shows up halfway through?  I don't CARE about these characters!  They show up and swim away in the same fashion and we're left not caring.  It was like the script was ready and some Producer said ""We need a love story!  Here's what my kid wrote last night!  Shove that into the middle somewhere!""That being said, TIDES was far more coherent, exciting and fun than the last two PIRATES outings.  Amazing production design, great cameos, a fun plot, and great performances by Depp, Rush, Cruz and McShane.  And they even managed to fit in a set piece with a PIRATES ride location!  I thought those had all been used up!  With some terrific story points left wide open for a fifth movie (almost guaranteed to start with a more-than-usually-disoriented Jack Sparrow having no control over his body), it's another solid entry into what looks to be a six-film series.This is what KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL should have been.",4,I do not understand the critical hate this movie received,1308355200,"06 18, 2011",2011,1918,"['Look', ""'m"", 'relatively', 'tough', 'audience', 'were', 'glaring', 'things', 'STRANGER', 'TIDES', 'made', 'go', 'Oh', 'come', 'guys', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'LITTLE', 'more', 'work', 'SPOILERS', 'Jack', 'get', 'sword', 'soldier', 'who', 'giving', 'chase', 'decides', 'leave', 'table', 'never', 'see', 'how', 'Jack', 'actually', 'chalices', 'little', 'things', 'did', 'pull', 'movie', 'bit', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'Almost', 'halfway', 'film', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'young', 'good-looking', 'kid', 'who', 'sole', 'job', 'preach', 'gospel', 'save', 'souls', 'Boring', 'pirate', 'movie', 'pirates', 'are', 'heroes', 'uninteresting', 'goody-goody', 'bible-thumper', 'suddenly', 'showing', 'up', 'not', 'gon', 'cut', 'Now', ""'d"", 'set', 'up', 'opening', 'teaser', 'where', 'show', 'out', 'spreading', 'word', 'attacked', 'beaten', 'pirates', 'then', ""'re"", 'reintroduced', 'halfway', ""'m"", 'little', 'more', 'side', 'then', 'love', 'mermaid', 'who', 'up', 'halfway', 'do', ""n't"", 'CARE', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'swim', 'away', 'same', 'fashion', ""'re"", 'left', 'not', 'caring', 'was', 'script', 'was', 'ready', 'Producer', 'said', 'need', 'love', 'story', 'Here', 'what', 'kid', 'wrote', 'last', 'night', 'Shove', 'middle', 'somewhere', 'being', 'said', 'TIDES', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'coherent', 'exciting', 'fun', 'last', 'two', 'PIRATES', 'outings', 'Amazing', 'production', 'design', 'great', 'cameos', 'fun', 'plot', 'great', 'performances', 'Depp', 'Rush', 'Cruz', 'McShane', 'even', 'managed', 'fit', 'set', 'piece', 'PIRATES', 'ride', 'location', 'thought', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'up', 'terrific', 'story', 'points', 'left', 'wide', 'open', 'fifth', 'movie', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'start', 'more-than-usually-disoriented', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'having', 'control', 'body', 'solid', 'entry', 'what', 'be', 'six-film', 'series.This', 'what', 'KINGDOM', 'THE', 'CRYSTAL', 'SKULL', 'should', 'have', 'been']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

The real blackbeard was a very fearsome and bloody pirate who got his head cut off in battle with the british navy off the coast of america. He was a american pirate for sure , although americans were really mainly british at this time. But this version is a good one , he's a truly nasty piece of work and that's a good thing. THe plot is easier to understand than the third one too. The action is very good the story is acceptable. There hasn't been a bad pirates of the carribean movie yet though. People expect too much from sequels usually. THe first is always going to be the freshest. The 3d version is the one to get as that is how it was shown at the theaters. And it is a good showcase of 3d. I must say I am tired of getting dvd's and digital copies in my package though because it drives up the price. I don't NEED a dvd copy.. They are wasting money doing that. The blu ray looks stunning and the extras are nice. Obviously if you don't have a 3d tv then only need the standard blu ray. Either version looks stunning on disc and is worth owning if you like the series. This is a fun movie and the acting is as good as the other versions with penelope cruz doing a fine job as the lead actress.

But was somewhat unhappy with the second, because it felt unfinished being that it was the first of a two part.  And the third one, while having some scenes that did WOW me, also felt unfinished and unpolished.  On Stranger Tides, partly based on a very good pirate novel, had many factors that I enjoy in the movie.  First, it was a full story.  Second, adventure, action, a story without leaning too heavily on special effects.  It also had a touch of mystery and fantasy, with the search for Voodoo, the Fountain of Youth, and mermaids.Why one star gone?  Well, I had nothing against Penelope Cruz who came across as both beautiful and dangerous, Ian McShane as Blackbeard just seemed too...small for the part?  Edward Teach, good or bad, is seen as a cutlass carrying giant in Pirate lore, and here he comes across as a smooth talking con artist.I did enjoy the race between the English and the Spanish to find and claim the Fountain.  And the interaction between Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa, played by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush.

Most of the old gang is back and this time they're seeking the Fountain of Youth but lots of other parties are involved in the mad race to this mythical location. Depp is his usual Captain Jack Sparrow, Rush is a bit more refined but still a rascal underneath it all and Ian McShane gets a nice introduction. Penelope Cruz may have been the weakest of the main stars and somebody should have given her some more practice with a sword because she just didn't look right. That said, it's a romanticized version of the life of a pirate so you have to sort of take it all in good fun. The tale was well constructed and better than most blockbuster films. Believe it or not models with natural curves were brought in to play the mermaids, including Gemma Ward as their creepy leader. The latter half was a lot more interesting than the first half. Inspired by a Tim Power's novel. Apparently it was Depp's idea to have the Spanish follow the protagonists in the tale but don't worry the writers did their share of the work. As usual for a blockbuster that does well the critics mostly slammed it and once again show they aren't in touch with the masses. The cost of this film was somewhere between 150-250M but it made over $1B at the box office.

This may be the shortest of the four movies as well (around 2 hours and 15 minutes) and it's never boring, but for some reason it still seems too long. I must admit that I liked Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, but the first one, as with most movie series, will always be the best. On Stranger Tides might even be slightly better than the last two sequels. At least it's not as confusing as At World's End, but I can pretty much say that if you didn't like the last two you'll probably feel the same about this one.Johnny Depp it seems will keep playing this character until the day he dies. I read that he wants to do at least two more PotC movies. Yes he has created one of the most memorable characters in movie history, but too much of a good thing can turn annoying real quick. I think he fares quite well this time around, more so than the last two, even though Jack Sparrow gets more and more goofy with each outing. Geoffrey Rush is back as Captain Barbossa and has his moments. Ian McShane has the look suited for Blackbeard, the most feared pirate of all time, but they should have made him much taller as was the real man. Depp even towered over him in some scenes, making him less intimidating. He also didn't do as much with this villainous role as I was hoping for. Those who have seen McShane on Deadwood know what I mean. Since Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley are gone, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz tries to fill the void as the daughter of Blackbeard. She looks good of course, but there wasn't much chemistry between her and Depp. The addition of mermaids was my favorite part, and these are like no mermaids I've ever heard of. Their beauty lures you in before dragging you underwater to be drowned and devoured.I read that the budget was half of the last film (around 150 instead of 300 million), but I really didn't notice. The CGI and sets looked up to par. Of course you also will get more than enough of that loud Han Zimmer score that runs through the whole series.Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is not a great movie and it might leave you with the impression that you have already seen this before, but as a mindless piece of summer entertainment it gets the job done.Oh, the IMAX 3-D looked really clear, but I'm not sure it was worth double the price.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",4,Jack is Back,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,2550,"['been', 'four', 'years', 'last', 'saw', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'bloated', 'third', 'film', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'series', 'time', 'back', 'stand', 'alone', 'story', 'little', 'do', 'previous', 'three', 'may', 'be', 'shortest', 'four', 'movies', 'as', 'well', '2', 'hours', '15', 'minutes', 'never', 'boring', 'reason', 'still', 'too', 'long', 'must', 'admit', 'liked', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Chest', 'World', 'End', 'first', 'one', 'most', 'movie', 'series', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'best', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'slightly', 'better', 'last', 'two', 'sequels', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'confusing', 'World', 'End', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'two', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', 'same', 'one.Johnny', 'Depp', 'will', 'keep', 'playing', 'character', 'day', 'read', 'do', 'least', 'two', 'more', 'PotC', 'movies', 'Yes', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'movie', 'history', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'turn', 'annoying', 'real', 'quick', 'think', 'quite', 'well', 'time', 'around', 'more', 'so', 'last', 'two', 'even', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'more', 'more', 'goofy', 'outing', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'back', 'Captain', 'Barbossa', 'moments', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'look', 'suited', 'Blackbeard', 'most', 'feared', 'pirate', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'taller', 'was', 'real', 'man', 'Depp', 'even', 'towered', 'scenes', 'making', 'less', 'intimidating', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'much', 'villainous', 'role', 'was', 'hoping', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'McShane', 'Deadwood', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'are', 'gone', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'fill', 'void', 'daughter', 'Blackbeard', 'good', 'course', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'chemistry', 'Depp', 'addition', 'mermaids', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'are', 'mermaids', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'beauty', 'dragging', 'underwater', 'be', 'drowned', 'devoured.I', 'read', 'budget', 'was', 'half', 'last', 'film', '150', 'instead', '300', 'million', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'CGI', 'sets', 'looked', 'up', 'par', 'course', 'also', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'enough', 'loud', 'Han', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'whole', 'series.Overall', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'might', 'leave', 'impression', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'mindless', 'piece', 'summer', 'entertainment', 'job', 'done.Oh', 'IMAX', '3-D', 'looked', 'really', 'clear', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'worth', 'double', 'price.3', '1/2', '5', 'stars']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

In reply to the 'rental' or cheap version of the movie being released in November, that is because the studio wants people to buy the movie and make more money for the studio. They have lost money because people are renting movies instead of buying them. My local video store(chain version all over the place) specially bought the combo packs so they could have the movies to rent to people. They had to pay more to get them. They sold the Blue-Ray versions for $10 to try and get some of the money back. People around here don't have Blue-Ray and don't want them. It is too expensive. You have to buy the player and then the dvds. I am happy with my regular dvd player. I bought a copy for my dad who has a basic Blue-Ray and it is a pain in the neck. Disney even put a disclaimer on the start of the movie that it may take up to 3 minutes to load. The blue-rays don't save your spot in the movie-you have to restart the whole thing over again. Make some noise and refuse to buy their combo packs and Blue-rays. I was told that this was their test case to sell them this way with the cheap version a month behind the more expensive.

I never really noticed that the guy and chick from the original trilogy were missing, but as long as Jack is in the movies, it can be called a Pirated of the Caribbean.The story is pretty cool, and it could open up a new trilogy for PotC. It follows two legends this time around, Black beard and the Fountain of Youth. I really loved what they did with Black Beard with all the twists and turns along the way.The music is a bit different, some of the original theme can be heard in some of the scenes, but I am a bit disappointed they didn't have more of it in the movie, since it holds value to the series. The new music they did add wasn't too bad, but most of it was forgettable and I was waiting for more of the main theme to play instead of those.Acting is really good in this movie, and Johnny Depp is still a great Jack Sparrow. The accents the other actors were believable and I couldn't tell if that was them acting or their natural voice. Blackbeard comes off as really powerful and evil and the actor that played him made that role come to life.Overall I say this isn't a bad movie, but you should watch the originally trilogy first so you are caught up on what's happened so far.

I liked the first film in the series. No so much the following sequels. Hopefully this terrible 4th film will kill the franchise off for good. It is an example of bad filmmaking and indicative of why the Disney Corp has had so much difficulty making good movies these days.'On Stranger Tides' might have been a pleasant diversion if it were the length of a typical TV show (42 minutes), but at 132 minutes, it was painfully overlong, overly complicated, and a bore.The cast does as well as can be expected. Depp has some amusing bits but he looks tired in most of the film. Perhaps he was counting his fee and telling himself that the cash was worth the indignation of repeating the role of Capt Jack Sparrow once again. The storyline is uninteresting and convoluted and seems to have been assembled in typical Disney fashion by putting together pieces of story here and there that must have sounding good across the conference table but only look good in 30 second advertisements.The best sequence by far is the very first 15 minutes which captures some of the joy of the first Pirate's film.

Tim Powers specializes in books taking historical characters and historical events and giving them a weird spin, weaving into the fantasy and the occult elements. Blackbeard, voodoo, raising the dead, pirates doing Calculus, what was his name, Pawn Say, Kingston harbor falls into the sea, the search for the Fountain of Youth, etc.By all means, READ the BOOK FIRST.An OK movie by Disney/ Johnny Depp standards, the movie is very much watered down version of maybe 20% the book. Johnny Depp buckling swashes, fights, violence with little motivation. Summer fare.  Much of the explanation for what is going on (and why) is left out of the movie and only the action scenes are left in. If you liked the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies, this movie is very much the same and you won't be disappointed. But if you HAVE read the book, (and I loved the book), don't go to the theater expecting to see it.Ian McShane (Deadwood) plays a convincing magician Blackbeard, with burning hemp in his beard. Keith Richards (of the Rolling Stones) makes a guest appearance, as, who else, Capt Jack Sparrow's father!

As someone who absolutely idolizes Jack Sparrow, I thought a movie devoted to him would be awesome.Sadly, I was wrong.  The first 3 movies were all 5/5.  This one doesn't come close, and for one very simple reason.  Any fan of Jack Sparrow loves unpredictability.  Johnny Depp certainly wasn't at fault, he played the part exactly as before.  But the way it was written, you knew what was going to happen well before it actually happened.  In a movie featuring Jack Sparrow as your single major character, predictability is a real buzzkill.  Also, while he was something of a ""chessmaster"" in the trilogy, here, he just bumbles around.  His tactical skills are clearly still intact, though his overall strategic abilities are left out.  He's not a king, just an incredibly clever pawn.The overall impression I got from the film was that it just screamed to cash in on the POTC name.  Blackbeard is nothing compared to Davy Jones (no fault on Ian McShane, who was clearly as villainous as the script allowed), Barbossa is no Beckett, and the Spanish are no real 3rd party.

I absolutely love the first three movies, and 2. To that guy who said ""the skinny girl is not in the movie"", that skinny girl is named Kiera Knightley. OK, now moving on, sort of.The first three movies were good old fashioned fun that didn't take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed them all very much and have seen them numerous times. I thought Verbinski did a hell of a job, considering he was a punk rock video director before a filmmaker. When I heard a fourth movie was being made, I got super excited. However, I had a stirring feeling of disappointment when I found out Verbinski was not directing. I'm not down with Rob Marshall- I thought Chicago was overrated and Nine was a confusing and slow mess. But, it's a Pirates movie, so I figured it'd be fun.Since I'm kinda pressed for time, I will sum up what I liked and didn't like.FIrst, the cast were great as per usual. Visually it was entertaining and the movie moved along at a nice pace... for the first hour. That, and Penelope Cruz is hot!!! And she did a great job as Angelica. Blackbeard was a cool villain, and Ian McShane does a fantastic job. There's a creepy scene involving mermaids, and that got a good reaction from those at the theatre.The bad... is everything else. First off, Barbossa is in the movie for only 20 minutes. The last hour is boring, drags a lot, and that's not all- there's a MAJOR plot hole involving the fountain of youth which is really annoying. And the 3D sucked.Overall, this is not a bad movie, but the writers are running out of ideas and it's clear.PROS:-Great acting-Hans Zimmer's score rules-Nice after the credits codaCONS-Pointless characters including the mermaid and the religious dude-About 30 minutes too long-Jack thinks far too much in this film-Drags greatly in the second half",2,"Something ain't quite ""Savvy"" here",1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,1914,"['am', 'really', 'unsure', 'how', 'sum', 'up', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'simple', 'words', 'begin', 'review', 'let', 'state', '2', 'things', '1', 'absolutely', 'love', 'first', 'three', 'movies', '2', 'guy', 'who', 'said', 'skinny', 'girl', 'not', 'movie', 'skinny', 'girl', 'named', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'OK', 'now', 'moving', 'sort', 'of.The', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'were', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'fun', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'have', 'seen', 'numerous', 'times', 'thought', 'Verbinski', 'did', 'hell', 'job', 'considering', 'was', 'punk', 'rock', 'video', 'director', 'filmmaker', 'When', 'heard', 'fourth', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'got', 'super', 'excited', 'However', 'had', 'stirring', 'feeling', 'disappointment', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Verbinski', 'was', 'not', 'directing', ""'m"", 'not', 'down', 'Rob', 'Marshall-', 'thought', 'Chicago', 'was', 'overrated', 'Nine', 'was', 'confusing', 'slow', 'mess', 'Pirates', 'movie', 'figured', ""'d"", 'be', 'fun.Since', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'pressed', 'time', 'will', 'sum', 'up', 'what', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'like.FIrst', 'cast', 'were', 'great', 'usual', 'Visually', 'was', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'moved', 'along', 'nice', 'pace', 'first', 'hour', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'hot', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Angelica', 'Blackbeard', 'was', 'cool', 'villain', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'fantastic', 'job', 'creepy', 'scene', 'involving', 'mermaids', 'got', 'good', 'reaction', 'theatre.The', 'bad', 'everything', 'else', 'First', 'Barbossa', 'movie', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'last', 'hour', 'boring', 'lot', 'not', 'all-', 'MAJOR', 'plot', 'hole', 'involving', 'fountain', 'youth', 'really', 'annoying', '3D', 'sucked.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'writers', 'are', 'running', 'ideas', 'clear.PROS', '-Great', 'acting-Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'rules-Nice', 'credits', 'codaCONS-Pointless', 'characters', 'including', 'mermaid', 'religious', 'dude-About', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long-Jack', 'thinks', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'film-Drags', 'greatly', 'second', 'half']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

1391213,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B004A8ZWUQ,RMurray847,"[9, 18]","Alright, let's just cut to the chase.  PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is a huge disappointment.  It will make lots of money and spawn more sequels...but the spark has gone out, and frankly, I'm not sure anything will help.  As long as Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is the major character, these films just aren't going to cut it.Think back on the first film in the series POTC: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (goodness, typing all these long titles is tedious).  It starred two lovely up-and-coming performers at the height of their popularity (Keira Knightley and especially Legolas...oh, I mean Orlando Bloom).  And Johnny Depp was there too...a popular, slightly hip actor.  And the film featured state of the art effects, some juicy supporting performances (especially from always reliable Geoffrey Rush) and was a burst of fresh air.  A lush pirate adventure that was actually fun!  Knightley and Bloom were lovely to look at and feisty and witty.  And Depp was a revelation.  His Sparrow was a unique and amazing creation.  (I won't run down all his now very familiar characteristics.)  So much so that Depp was nominated for an Oscar and went from modestly successful leading man to full blown STAR.  The world was drowned in Depp and we embraced his oddball characterizations.  He went on to receive another Oscar nomination for FINDING NEVERLAND and to considerable oddball success in more and more Tim Burton films.Meanwhile, POTC: DEAD MAN'S CHEST arrived.  Packed even more full of effects, it still had lots of fun...but suffered from sequel-bloat.  More was not always more.  But I still found it quite enjoyable, with some stunt work that was fun (the big ""hamster ball"" scene is still clever).  Depp was now solidly the star, but Sparrow was still new enough that we wanted more.  But by the time POTC: AT WORLD'S END came along, the film was SO special effects laden, SO loud and SO Jack Sparrow centric that I felt the series was pretty much played out.  The movie was long and frequently boring.  Big CGI battle scenes were not enough to engage.  The characters were so familiar.  There was nothing new that Jack Sparrow could bring to the table.  His strange accent, odd mincing and fake-drunk demeanor were totally familiar.  But of course, we viewers attended dutifully and saw the series wrapped up.  The Knightley / Bloom characters had their arc more or less wrapped up (and by now, Bloom was not even remotely a movie star any more).  It was a disappointing end to a series that started so well...but it really did seem to be the end.Now a new director and a producer Jerry Bruckheimer and star Depp have ""rebooted"" the series.  And in some ways, they have listened to the criticisms of the past.  The special effects, while still impressive, are significantly dialed down.  There has been an effort to return to character and not just noise for the sake of it.  And aside from Depp & Rush, they've pretty much abandoned all the previous characters.  But Sparrow is still very much the focus, and with stripping away most other distractions, it was painfully clear to me that Sparrow has nothing left to offer us.  There is NO surprise left in this character.  Depp tries hard...but he's not really acting any more, he's recreating mannerisms that once grew organically from Depp the actor.  He's become Depp the Jack Sparrow impersonator.  He can put on the makeup and costume...but not really anything more than a characterization.  Sparrow is a cartoon now.The movie still features some clever ""chase"" scenes, including an early scene involving horses and carriages that feels like something Jackie Chan might have staged.  But there's lots of talking in the first half of the film.  Lots of exposition.  Something to do with finding the fountain of youth, and who has stolen whose ship and why is the pirate Barbossa now the captain of an English military vessel.  And who is this woman (Penelope Cruise) with a complicated past history with Depp?  They were clearly lovers once, but are now bitter rivals.  But that romantic spark remains.  (Yet Cruz and Depp have no chemistry.  Really, when was the last time Johnny Depp had any real romantic chemistry with an actress?)  And then it turns out she's working with the evil pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane)...the most evil pirate ever.  I found the first hour of this two hour fifteen minute film to be mostly quite tedious, and my eyelids frequently drooped.)Things perked up a bit when Blackbeard and his crew reach the mysterious island where mermaids live.  These mermaids are gorgeous sirens who lure men to them and then turn into some fairly vicious, fanged creatures.  The scene when Blackbeard is trying to trap one of these creatures is actually pretty impressive, and my interest in the film finally rose above lukewarm.  But that interest waned fairly soon.  And when Depp and Rush teamed up towards the end, I realized that the same ""been there, seen that"" feeling I had about Sparrow also applied to Rush's Barbossa.  Rush brings his best efforts, but the character is what it is...and so he's grown tiresome too.As always, the films are technically impeccable.  (I'd advise saving your money and passing on the 3D version.  That's what I saw, and the 3D added nothing to the film except unneeded darkness.)  But with a needlessly complicated plot, awkward exposition and a lead character who has evolved from surprisingly delightful to dishearteningly mundane...the PIRATES series has worn out its welcome.",2,Great production values do not make great entertainment.  2.5 stars,1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,5515,"['Alright', 'let', 'just', 'cut', 'chase', 'PIRATES', 'THE', 'CARIBBEAN', 'ON',

1391214,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B004A8ZWUQ,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Pirates of the Caribbean:On Stranger Tides(released May/11)is a welcome comeback for the franchise,which had bogged down in the second film,and started a slow climb up in the third;but not reaching quite up to the scale of the first film or this one.This one finds Depp firmly back in Sparrows character with all the ""isms"" he can muster,with a nicely edited and fast moving piece. .The plot finds Sparrow in London and his first mate Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally)has been mistakenly dragged into court to face charges as...Jack Sparrow.The presiding judge is none other than the real Sparrow and he sentences his first mate to life in prison.In a typical switcharoo Sparrow accompanies his first mate as they are taken to prison,but when they arrive it seems they are both sentenced to die.Sparrow is brought before King George II(Richard Griffiths),who wants him to accompany his old nemesis Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush),to find the fabled fountain of youth(remember that compass from the last film?).Sparrow will have none of it and slips away from the crowded room.During his escapes he briefly runs into his father who gives him warnings re the fountain of youth and about an imposter of him that is trying to put a crew together.Sparrow ends up at a tavern and he meets his imposter,one Angelica(Pen&eacute;lope Cruz),who he deflowered in a convent years before and had not seen since.She claims she is the daughter of the infamous pirate Blackbeard,and before you can say Black Pearl,he is waylayed and brought on board Blackbeards ship.Back at the prison Barbarossa forces Sparrows first mate into servitude aboard his ship,as Gibbs also knows the location of the magical waters.No one has seen Blackbeard,so Sparrow instigates a mutiny on his ship.He almost succeeds until Blackbeard appears before the crew and stops the mutiny in its tracks.With things settled into a manor more sided towards Blackbeard's purposes,the ship sails to find a mermaid from which its tears may be extracted,and Ponce de Leon's ship and the two chalices on board.Barbarossa is sailing also for the fountain but with a different purpose.It was Blackbeard that took the Black Pearl away from him and forced Barbarossa to cut his own leg off to save his life;so revenge,not youth,is on his mind.Add to all this the Spanish,who are also intent on finding the fountain,but again cross purposes to Blackbeard and Barbarossa;to destroy the fountain which is blasphemous to them and their Catholic beliefs.Blackbeard captures a mermaid for her tears after a drawn and bloody battle.When they reach the land of the fountain,a decided impasse in the form of a cavernous ravine appears before them,at the bottom of which is a fast flowing river.Blackbeard forces Sparrow to jump into the water to search for Ponce De Leon's ship and the chalices.Jack finds the ship and Barbarossa;who has beat him to it.The ship sits on the edge of a cliff and they must both do a balancing act to get the cups.But they find the Spanish have beaten them to the punch.Sparrow and Barbarossa raid the Spanish encampment and steal the cups.Jack and Barbarossa agree to work together to defeat Blackbeard.Sparrow returns with cups and takes Blackbeard to the fountain.Before long Barbarossa enters the picture,then the Spanish.A drawn and drag em out fight ensues with the Spanish trashing the fountain,Barabrossa getting his revenge on Blackbeard and Jack using the fountain to save Angelca's life.Sparrow however strands Angelica on a desert island,Barbarossa returns to pirating on Blackbeards ship and Jack and his first mate start looking for a way to get the Black Pearl,in glass jar from Blackbeards ship,out of its prison.The film fades out as a voodoo doll of Jack,which Blackbeard had made,floats into the possession of a smiling Angelica.Fast paced,well acted and scripted,the film is filled with Sparrow-isms and good doses of comedy.It is what made the first film so successful and I'm glad they have returned to this way of doing Pirates,once more.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extras are commentary and deleted scenes.A highly recommended fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.Its pace and sense of humour harkens back to the first one,taking most of its good,and dispensing with most of the bad.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,A return to the franchise's roots,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,4370,"['Pirates',

To be honest, I never have quite gotten it.  I like the actors very much, esp. Depp, but also the original cast of Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly, etc.  However, I find the plot, the entire concept, extremely lame, kind of an excuse for endless action sequences  that are simply tiring after a while.  The visual effects didn't carry it for me either.OK, Depp has a map of the Fountain of Youth.  Add to the intrigue an old lover of his, the amazing Penelope Cruz as well as Blackbeard, played by the wonderful Ian McShane.  Again, these are first rate actors.  So what happens?  They find it, with all sorts of sword fights, and sirens added into the mix, including Spanish Catholic fanatics who want to end all this pagan business.  It is an absolutely incoherent mess.  Nothing is believable, even my son barely laughed while maintaining that he liked it, and it fails to advance whatever the base story line is.I think this is a complete failure, merely trying to give more of the same to viewers who will pay.

Meanwhile, a British contingent, led by peg-legged ""privateer, not pirate"" Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), is on the same mission, though he claims to be doing it not for personal enrichment but for king and country.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"" with a screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rosio and direction by Rob Marshall, keeps the storyline fairly simple and streamlined this time out, avoiding the overstuffed, convoluted plotting that often made the earlier installments all but impossible to follow. Even Johnny Depp himself, in the spirit of the enterprise, seems to have toned down some of the more flamboyant qualities of his earlier performances and appears to be relishing playing a pirate who is less in charge of his own fate and more at the mercy of the other characters this time around. Yet, he's still able to land a sharp-tongued barb with the best of them, whether it be against Blackbeard, Barbossa or Angelica, the feisty love interest played by the beautiful Penelope Cruz.As is par for the course, the movie runs on far too long, padding out its length with a sappy romance between a preacher-man and a mermaid and a few too many distended swordfights for the movie's (and the audience's) good, but, overall, this turns out to be one of the less top-heavy and heavy-handed of the ""Pirates"" films.",3,Less chaotic and confusing than some of the earlier entries in the series,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,1678,"['Currently', 'captain', 'ship', 'Black', 'Pearl', 'having', 'been', 'shrunk', 'placed', 'sealed', 'bottle', 'least', 'time', 'being', 'inimitable', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'impressed', 'vessel', 'captained', 'Spanish', 'pirate', 'Blackbeard', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'hot', 'trail', 'Ponce', 'de', 'Leon', 'famed', 'ever', 'elusive', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'Meanwhile', 'British', 'contingent', 'led', 'peg-legged', 'privateer', 'not', 'pirate', 'Barbossa', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'same', 'mission', 'be', 'doing', 'not', 'personal', 'enrichment', 'king', 'country', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'screenplay', 'Ted', 'Elliott', 'Terry', 'Rosio', 'direction', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'simple', 'streamlined', 'time', 'out', 'avoiding', 'overstuffed', 'convoluted', 'plotting', 'often', 'made', 'earlier', 'installments', 'impossible', 'follow', 'Even', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'spirit', 'enterprise', 'have', 'toned', 'down', 'more', 'flamboyant', 'qualities', 'earlier', 'performances', 'be', 'relishing', 'playing', 'pirate', 'who', 'less', 'charge', 'own', 'fate', 'more', 'mercy', 'other', 'characters', 'time', 'around', 'still', 'able', 'land', 'sharp-tongued', 'barb', 'best', 'be', 'Blackbeard', 'Barbossa', 'Angelica', 'feisty', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Penelope', 'Cruz.As', 'par', 'course', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'padding', 'out', 'length', 'sappy', 'romance', 'preacher-man', 'mermaid', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'distended', 'swordfights', 'movie', 'audience', 'good', 'overall', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'less', 'top-heavy', 'heavy-handed', 'Pirates', 'films']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

1391225,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B004A8ZWUQ,Russ Nickel,"[3, 5]","So imagine you're a mermaid, right? The top half of you is insanely hot. Your hair's got that sexy, just-came-out-of-the-shower thing going on, maybe the smallest strand of it is stuck to your face. The buoyancy of the water means that your bosom's always bouncing, and somehow your skin never gets pruny. The bottom half of you is kind of fishy, but you're still fully capable of holding intelligent conversation, of making rational choices, and, most importantly, of feeling human emotion. Look, I understand that you and I are different, but do you seriously have to devour us regular folk? I mean honestly. I don't eat other people, and do you know why? Because I like talking to them! Because I empathize with them. Because they're my friends. For god's sake, there's a crapload of reasons I don't eat people. And I don't see why mermaids should be any different.Plus, when mermaids are out of the water, their somewhat-less-than-attractive fish tails magically go away and turn into alluring lady parts. On land, they're completely human! All I'm saying is instead of cannibalistically devouring us homo sapiens, they should just eat fish or something--I'm sure there's a way. I mean, one of the mermaids is even the center of the main love story. You can't have it both ways, Pirates of the Caribbean. Either they're horrible sea monsters who just use their charm to feed, or they're sexy, briny, love trout. The only way I can even begin to make sense of this, and the movie doesn't give us much to go on, mind you, is that the mermaids were the guardians of the fountain of youth, and the only reason they were killing people was because they knew these were bad men who would use the fountain for their own, evil ends.Phew. So as you may or may not have gathered, this new installment of Pirates is about the quest for the fountain of youth, which so happens to be located on an island surrounded by lovely, fangy mermaids. Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), and the Spaniards (various) are all racing to be the first to unlock the power of the fountain, and these mermaids are hell bent on stopping them. The only person they don't attempt to kill is a missionary (Sam Claflin). The reason I spent so long ranting about this is not because I disliked the mermaids. Quite the contrary. The mermaid love story was, in my opinion, the most touching and interesting part of the film. The major players were acted expertly, mind you, but they just didn't have good story arcs. Ian McShane made a menacing Blackbeard, but his character was one note and weak. Geoffrey Rush is one of the best actors of our day, and he lent a great deal of formidability to Captain Barbossa, but his story is nothing compared to his quest to free himself from the Curse of the Black Pearl. And we've already seen so much of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Sure, he's great and all, but it's the random missionary and his mermaid lover (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) who manage to capture our imaginations.Other than the love story, which feels almost tacked on, this movie is very simple, which is actually a good thing! After a great start to this series, the sequel and threequel were huge letdowns. Each became more mired in its sense of the grandiose. The plots became a tangled jumble of unrelated elements, each more confusing than the last. Impossibly hard to follow, these sequels left audiences with nothing but Johnny Depp's charm and a good deal of sword fighting. Here, though, the plot is straightforward. Three different groups are racing toward the same goal, and everything comes together nicely. Yet, for all their effort, the film lacks a certain something. The story structure is there, but there's just no magic to it. Because things are so clearly foreshadowed, there's no mystery, no surprise, and this makes it nigh impossible to become emotionally invested. I almost nodded off at the beginning, but by the end all I could say was, ""Well done, I guess. Things did sort of come together there, didn't they?""At least most of the basic plot made sense, because if you start digging a little deeper, this movie is riddled with details that do not add up to two licks of a wench's tongue on Tuesday. In fantasy, you're allowed to invent some things, but On Stranger Tides goes too far. In the first film, for example, there's a curse that causes men to live forever, but their bodies wither away, turning to skeletons. That's the one example of magic that drives the whole story. Here, however, the writers throw in an endless barrage of unexplained mysteries. Why does Blackbeard's ship have giant flamethrowers? I don't think they had that kind of technology back then. And I'll grant Blackbeard a sword that lets him magically control his rigging, but how does that translate to his being able to capture real life ships in tiny bottles? For that matter, how is Blackbeard able to create zombie deckhands that can't be killed? And why doesn't he have more of them? And why is it never important to the story?Things may not hold together completely, but there's still a lot to love. This is definitely the 2nd best Pirates movies and will provide a bit of fun for those who decide to go. Thanks to the expert acting, a reasonably well-plotted story, and some compelling missionary mermaid action, I give Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides:Score: 3.5/5Mermaids are just too hot for me to believe they're killing those poor guys.

The problem with the fountain is that you steal another's life and gain their years.  It's not a simple matter of taking a drink.Interesting myth-making here.  The tear from a mermaid, two silver goblets and a victim.  Piece of cake!The character driven story was much more involved than the special effects CGI-fest of the past films.  I was a bit surprised at the rocky Florida coast and lighthouse castle (rocky coasts in Florida??) and enjoyed the pirates Blackbeard and the one-legged pirate played by Ian McShane.  Penelope Cruz as the sexy pirate was also fun to watch - but really, I doubt women at the time were ever permitted onboard these vessels as officers, much less there at all!The life aboard ship was antiseptic as is expected from a Disney film.  The ""zombie-fied"" slavers whipping the boys into shape, the sexy but deadly mermaids and the various subplots, such as the romance between mermaid and minister - made for a well-paced film.There are a few slow points and that's why a four rather than a five star film.  The acting was well-done, the special effects were good without being overdone, and the discoveries of various creatures and activities was interesting as well as the supernatural.The Spanish explorers were into destroying what they considered pagan or supernatural, which is in conformance with their historical voyages of destruction of the native peoples' cultures in this area.Bottom Line:  More character driven than the others; recaptured for me the pacing and the art of telling a story that the first film had.  Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz make a great couple.

Yarbrough""","[0, 0]","If you ever needed proof why you shouldn't listen to critics, the Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, part 4 in the series, is it.  Part 2 and part 3 received quite a thrashing from critics despite still cashing in pretty big at the box office.  So, there's no reason why they would treat part 4 any different.  But that's just it.  It is different. Without Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, whom you won't even miss having in this film, you should expect a new storyline and new characters and that's exactly what you get.  Barbossa and Gibbs are back, but other than Captain Jack, Jack the Monkey, and even a cameo from Jack's father (Keith Richards), you have a whole new cast of characters.The film picks up with the same plot where the last one left off, with the Fountain of Youth being the focus.  Captain Jack escapes the gallows with Gibbs only to discover someone is impersonating him and getting a crew together to go find the fountain. The imposter turns out to be Angelica Teach (Penelope Cruz), the daughter of Blackbeard (Ian McShane) who wants to find the fountain to save her father from a doomed prophecy.Angelica and Jack apparently have a past love interest together and she tricks him into joining the crew because she knows he has the map and that he's been to the fountain.  But to get the spell of the fountain to work, they'll have to collect certain items that are needed, including the tear of a mermaid.  So, the movie becomes a race for Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish, and the English, to collect the items needed and get to the fountain first!Blackbeard is a colorful and well played evil pirate.  You can expect the same entertainment that you got from Davy Jones and Barbossa in the previous films.  Cruz definitely holds her own in the cast of men.  Depp is Jack through and through, prancing about and always cleverly escaping trouble.  And Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa again is up to his old conniving tricks, undercover on the English side,  despite having a peg leg now.The movie provides lots of fast paced action mainly in the form of sword fights and doesn't rely heavily on special effects like the last film. And then there are the mermaids!

They didthe first three Pirates moviesand are together again for 2011's Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Some of the key characters from the predecessors are gone and some are are back in Stranger Tides...while director Gore Verbinski is out and Rob Marshall is in. Together the cast and crew still manage to keep the franchise alive and entertainingThe special effects are great. The movies are visually spectacular with realistic looking at-sea adventure featuring legendary pirates, ghosts, sea monsters and now mermaids...I'd say the amazing effects actually contribute a full star to all of the Pirates movies in this series. There's lots of silliness in the Pirates movies, but it's deliberate. There's slapstick. There are death-defying feats. There's Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) doing his best imitation of Keith Richards (true factoid, he has publicly commented that Richards is his Jack Sparrow character persona inspiration...and by now everyone knows who notice who plays Captain Teague, right?). And all the silliness mostly works. After all, this is Disney and indeed supposed to be a movie for kids too, no?I find it amazing that On Stranger Tides alone has grossed over $1,000,000,000 (that's a BILLION dollars according to Box Office Mojo). It's a good movie that kids can watch too so that's certainly a recipe for success. But a billion dollars?!? Wow. On Stranger Tides, At World's End and Dead Man's Chest are more between a 3 and 4 star rating than the solid 4 star that Curse of the Black Pearl would earn alone. But numbers don't lie. People are drawn to this franchise. I am drawn to this franchise. So bottom line: all four movies offer like 9 hours of time that can be spent nuzzling up with your kids.No, this franchise's ship has not sailed...yet. It continues to please audiences and of course carries an ending that suggests that it has at least one more life left in it.

I feel obligated to share my thoughts. To put it bluntly, this movie is not even close in quality to any of the previous films. The loss of Will an Elizabeth is unnoticed. The best character was Jack Sparrow and everyone knew it, but should a whole movie be based off one character? His quirky mannerisms and quick witted humor were great in the other three movies, but it starts to feel stale in this one. A little goes along way. I found that those Jack quick witted mini lectures and jokes got a bit silly when that is all you hear for two hours. Unfortunately, the supporting cast is dull. A lot of the characters from the first three are back including barbossa and Jacks first mate (that one guy who I cant remember his name, the one who has those two lacky screw ups, you know the one). They add nothing here. They never have and were always decent fill in characters. This time Jack gets a lady counterpart, Penelope Cruz. Cruz is ridiculous. She is not necessarily bad, but just boring. She is there to look cute and make pouty faces. She is supposed to be the female Jack Sparrow. However, during her fight scenes, I never believed it for an instant. It just looked silly as did the rest of the action which takes place somewhere between the quick cuts in the editing room. In the first action scene, Jack escapes the King. He scurries up the wall and dives out the window, hopping on top of carriages. He lands on a sign in front of a bar. He falls down. UH OH!!! There is a bad guy. BOOM. What? Why it is Jacks father....conveniently there to kill the bad guy. They have a quick discussion in the bar. Jack turns and...........his father is gone. What? ok......Jack learns of someone of importance that is in the other room. OH NO! Its a Jack imposter. 6 minutes later....oh, its Penelepe Cruz pretending to be Jack. Where am I going with all of this? I dont know and I wish the movie did to. The film is a disjointed mess all the way to the fountain of youth which is accessed by a ceiling pool. Yes, a ceiling pool. You have to go through the ceiling. Again, yes. They must have felt foolish because the Spaniards were in there to except they didnt have to climb through the ceiling water.

1391258,A26MJME9IBNETY,B004A8ZWUQ,StrangePegs,"[10, 14]","Pirates is a long movie. Too long. And, yet, not long enough. The writers wrote this long, rambling script with lots of extra stuff in it. Stuff that, really, has nothing to do with the actual plot. I'm assuming it has an actual plot, although I'm not convinced the writers had agreed on one specific one. At some point, they realized it was too long. Cuts needed to be made. Instead of carving out the non-essential elements, they just chopped off the first third of the movie, leaving something that was still too long but without any kind of foundation. At least, that's what it felt like.For instance, the movie opens with Mr. Gibbs on trial. He's being tried as Jack Sparrow. How did he come to be on trial and why do they think he's Jack? We don't know. And we don't get to know. Of course, Jack is there to rescue him. Gibbs is surprised to see Jack, because Jack had nothing to do with why he's on trial, Jack just happened to hear about it and decided to rescue his old friend. Because, you know, Jack is prone to thinking about other people before himself. During all of the action revolving around the rescue, we find out we're already in the midst of the story, ""I hear you've been looking for the Fountain of Youth."" ""Why, yes. Yes, I am."" Something close to that, at any rate. And there we are in the middle of the story without any of the reasons for it. Of course, in the end, the ""story"" isn't even the story, because, well, as I said, the writers didn't know which story they were telling. The rescue of Gibbs and Jack's escape is the best part of the movie, though, and that, actually, has nothing to do with any story. It's just a bit of fun. Think car chase with no cars.There's also a completely non-essential sub-plot, or, maybe, it is the plot, between a missionary and a mermaid. I think they were probably trying to recapture the romance between Swan and Turner from the previous movies, but, in truth, they are who the previous movies are about, so it worked. This movie, Jack is the main character, and we have no reason to care about the missionary and the mermaid, so we don't.I could go on about the plot issues. For instance, there's the inclusion of the Spanish, who are there as no more than a deus ex machina device except not. There's Blackbeard. Why? I don't really know. Theoretically, he's important to the plot, but, unfortunately, he's also unnecessary. Anyway...The other central issue to the movie is that the actors, over all, don't give the parts any life. It felt like watching a dress rehearsal. Hmm... no, not a dress rehearsal, a last run through of the dialogue while in costume. Oh, there are moments, but not enough of them. Johnny Depp even falls flat for much of the movie, but it may just be that the script kept trying to force him out of character. Like rescuing Gibbs when he was getting nothing out of it. Geoffrey Rush almost pulls off Barbossa, but he, also, is frequently out of character because of the script. It's like the writers had a basket of characters that they plugged in whether they should have been there or not. Well, actually, they had characters they needed to put into the movie and stuck them into the best places possible even if they didn't quite fit.The biggest disappointment was Ian McShane. If I had never seen Deadwood, I probably wouldn't have given him a second thought; however, I have seen Deadwood, so I know what he's capable of. His rendition of Blackbeard was not it. Flat as a cardboard cut out. If they hadn't told us in the movie that Blackbeard was supposed to be scary and evil, I never would have known. And don't get me started on the cheesy scenes of him and his sword that they put in just for the 3d effects even though they didn't do anything for the actual story (no, I didn't see it in 3d, so they were doubly wasted on me).The biggest surprise was Penelope Cruz. That may be because I was expecting absolutely nothing more than a piece of eye candy from her, but she was actually decent. As decent as the script allowed, at any rate.Oh, and they stuck Keith Richards in just so he could be in the movie. Sort of like the random old guy that wanders through and says ""Beware...!"" the whatever and then is gone. Yeah, that was his bit.What it comes down to is that I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. At least, not for seeing it in the theater. It's probably worth a rental, but it has nothing to make it worth seeing at the theater. Not unless you just want to pay the 3d price in order to see a few swords and ropes flying out of the screen at you.",1,Full of Disappointment,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,4564,"['Pirates', 'long', 'movie', 'Too', 'long', 'yet', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'writers', 'wrote', 'long', 'rambling', 'script', 'lots', 'extra', 'stuff', 'Stuff', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'actual', 'plot', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'actual', 'plot', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'writers', 'had', 'agreed', 'one', 'specific', 'one', 'point', 'realized', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'Cuts', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'Instead', 'carving', 'out', 'non-essential', 'elements', 'just', 'chopped', 'off', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'leaving', 'something', 'was', 'still', 'too', 'long', 'kind', 'foundation', 'least', 'what', 'felt', 'like.For', 'instance', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Gibbs', 'trial', 'being', 'tried', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'How', 'did', 'come', 'be', 'trial', 'why', 'do', 'think', 'Jack', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'course', 'Jack', 'there', 'rescue', 'Gibbs', 'surprised', 'see', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'why', 'trial', 'Jack', 'just', 'happened', 'hear', 'decided', 'rescue', 'old', 'friend', 'know', 'Jack', 'prone', 'thinking', 'other', 'people', 'action', 'revolving', 'rescue', 'find', 'out', ""'re"", 'already', 'midst', 'story', 'hear', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'Why', 'yes', 'Yes', 'am', 'Something', 'close', 'rate', 'are', 'middle', 'story', 'reasons', 'course', 'end', 'story', ""n't"", 'even', 'story', 'well', 'said', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'were', 'telling', 'rescue', 'Gibbs', 'Jack', 'escape', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'though', 'actually', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'just', 'bit', 'fun', 'Think', 'car', 'chase', 'cars.There', 'also', 'completely', 'non-essential', 'sub-plot', 'maybe', 'plot', 'missionary', 'mermaid', 'think', 'were', 'probably', 'trying', 'recapture', 'romance', 'Swan', 'Turner', 'previous', 'movies', 'truth', 'are', 'who', 'previous', 'movies', 'are', 'worked', 'movie', 'Jack', 'main', 'character', 'have', 'reason', 'care', 'missionary', 'mermaid', ""don't.I"", 'could', 'go', 'plot', 'issues', 'instance', 'inclusion', 'Spanish', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'more', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'device', 'not', 'Blackbeard', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'Theoretically', 'important', 'plot', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'unnecessary', 'Anyway', 'other', 'central', 'issue', 'movie', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'parts', 'life', 'felt', 'watching', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'Hmm', 'not', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'last', 'run', 'dialogue', 'costume', 'Oh', 'are', 'moments', 'not', 'enough', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'even', 'flat', 'much', 'movie', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'script', 'kept', 'trying', 'force', 'character', 'rescuing', 'Gibbs', 'when', 'was', 'getting', 'nothing', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'almost', 'Barbossa', 'also', 'frequently', 'character', 'script', 'writers', 'had', 'basket', 'characters', 'plugged', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'not', 'Well', 'actually', 'had', 'characters', 'needed', 'put', 'movie', 'stuck', 'best', 'places', 'possible', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit.The', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Deadwood', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'second', 'thought', 'however', 'have', 'seen', 'Deadwood', 'know', 'what', 'capable', 'rendition', 'Blackbeard', 'was', 'not', 'Flat', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'out', 'had', ""n't"", 'told', 'movie', 'Blackbeard', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'scary', 'evil', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'sword', 'put', 'just', '3d', 'effects', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'actual', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', '3d', 'were', 'doubly', 'wasted', '.The', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'expecting', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'more', 'piece', 'eye', 'candy', 'was', 'actually', 'decent', 'As', 'decent', 'script', 'allowed', 'rate.Oh', 'stuck', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'just', 'could', 'be', 'movie', 'Sort', 'random', 'old', 'guy', 'Beware', 'whatever', 'then', 'gone', 'Yeah', 'was', 'bit.What', 'down', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'least', 'not', 'seeing', 'theater', 'probably', 'worth', 'rental', 'nothing', 'make', 'worth', 'seeing', 'theater', 'Not', 'just', 'want', 'pay', '3d', 'price', 'order', 'see', 'few', 'swords', 'ropes', 'flying', 'screen']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides

1391275,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004A8ZWUQ,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The film starts out with ominous music. An old sailor is discovered who was once on a ship that was looking for the Fountain of Youth...200 years ago! This sets off a frenzy to look for the Fountain. You would think without Orlando and Keira, the movie would be a bust. What I missed more than those two stars were the minor actors who played the crew. They were colorful characters who we have come to know. Alas, except for a few, they're  gone. The action is the same: sword fights, impossible escapes, humorous dialouge, and unexpected turns. We get to meet Jack's father and Angelica Malon (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) the later of which Jack supposedly deflowered right before she was getting ready to take her vowels in a Spanish convent. No surprise there.Now in order to use the Fountain of Youth, there must be a ritual. We discover early on the ritual requires two silver chalices and a mermaid's tear. We also discover that the Black Pearl has been sunk and Hector is working for the crown. Through a series of events, Jack becomes Shanghaied on Black Beard's (Ian McShane) ship. We have 3 groups after the Fountain, the Spanish, the English who have Gibbs who has memorized the map, and Blackbeard. While Jack is in the hold, Angelica is Black Beard's first mate having convinced him she is his long lost daughter. As always in these movies everyone has their own ideas, desires, and shifting alliances.The group must go on these quests to gather the items before going to the Fountain. (I see an RPG in the making.)The silver chalices are not just any 2 silver chalices but the ones that belonged to Ponce De Leon.The mermaids have the beauty and allure of a Siren, but when they attack they have super-human strength and vampire teeth, making their capture a bit tricky and deadly. I fell in love with the doll face of the first mermaid (Gemma Ward who actually plays a character called Dollface in ""The Strangers"".) I know this is a Disney movie and this should go without saying...The mermaids are indeed topless, but the camera angles, hair and arm placements prevent any kind of ""R"" view.

1391280,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B004A8ZWUQ,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 4]","Very often, the dollar signs in a studio executive's eyes prove to be too powerful a draw, leading them to offer huge sums of money to stars to reprise their roles. A director is found who can, at the least, maintain the status quo and not kill the lucrative franchise. And a sequel is born. But sequels are almost always a case of diminishing returns, both financially and creatively. Such is the case with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films I hoped the series was killed by the critically panned third installment, but it made a bounty of cash. And before you could say ""Davy Jones' Locker"", Johnny Depp was offered a huge sum of money (I heard rumors of $40 million), a new director was brought on board (Rob Marshall, director of ""Chicago"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and ""Nine"") and producer Jerry Bruckheimer was able to offer Disney an almost certain money maker for Summer, 2011. This should help make up for his recent duds ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" and ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"".The good news? ""On Stranger Tides"" is better than ""At World's End"", but that isn't saying much. It's not worth paying extra dollars to see in 3-D. It is worth, at most, the cost of a bargain matinee.Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) crosses paths with an old flame, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), who is posing as Jack to recruit a crew for a mysterious voyage. Jack is soon shanghaied and quickly learns Angelica is posing as Blackbeard's (Ian McShane) daughter in an effort to tag along as he searches for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has joined the Royal Navy and seems determined to use the new resources and power at his disposal to hunt down Blackbeard. Eventually, both groups will cross paths with a group of Spanish sailors who also seem to be looking for Ponce de Leon's treasure. Along the way, they try to collect pieces of the puzzle; legend dictates they will need the tear of a live mermaid and two of Ponce de Leon's silver chalices.Directed by Rob Marshall and written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (among others), ""On Stranger Tides"" benefits from a few changes but suffers from some big narrative problems.I'm not sure why the producers decided to leave Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley out of this adventure, but it was a good decision. Quite frankly, each looked both bored and angry at the same time throughout ""At World's End"". I really doubt they turned this installment down - if they were considered valuable enough, huge sums of money would have appeared to help entice them. It certainly worked with Depp. I have never been a fan of Bloom, but I do enjoy Knightley's work. That said, ""Stranger Tides"" seems to have more energy due to their absence. The filmmaker's still deemed it necessary to have a younger couple along for the ride so they have created a new couple, a young priest who falls in love with the mermaid they have captured. Their budding romance is sweet, but the two actors do not have the magnetism or presence of Bloom and Knightley.At this point, it would just seem odd, just seem ""straight-to-DVD"" to have a new film without Captain Jack. Depp is so memorable in the role that Captain Jack has become part of the film lexicon, much like Hannibal Lecter, Ripley, Danny Ocean and others. That said, in the new film, Depp really doesn't do anything new with the character. Everything seems rehashed or recycled, from his exaggerated flouncing about to the mannerisms borrowed from Keith Richards (who makes an improbable cameo). He also continues to shift his allegiance from moment to moment; he wants to help Angelica, then he enters into an allegiance with Barbossa, then he seems to be out to find the Fountain of Youth for his own gain. This was amusing and fun to watch in the first film. Now, in #4 (and the already announced fifth installment), its just more of the same. When you think about Johnny Depp's work, that is usually the last thing that comes to mind. Its sad when a once formidable talent, who used to do strange, unusual and exciting work, begins to do work that can be described as 'more of the same'.Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa fares about as well as Depp. From the moment he shows up dressed in Royal Navy garb, we know he is playing a game to achieve some goal. When the goal is revealed, it comes as no surprise. Rush is a very good actor who has done many very good films. But he is clearly in this film for the money. I can't fault him for wanting to collect a big paycheck, but he could've done more with the role.Penelope Cruz is fine as Angelica. She runs around with a certain sense of abandon and seems to have fun in the role. But the whole 'posing as Blackbeard's daughter' ruse is never explained or justified and just seems odd.Ian McShane is the best part of this new movie. As Blackbeard, he introduces a new character, a new menace and it is fun to see this character come to life. When we first meet the fabled pirate, he leaves his stateroom to address his crew. Upset, he barely raises his voice, but his character and figure are still alarming, still menacing. His beard, the ends braided, is on fire. Why? Who knows, but he doesn't seem to notice or care.Marshall seems to have fun breathing life into this story. The action scenes seem a little madcap and lively. In fact, I get the definite sense they are trying to shift the balance back to hand-to-hand combat away from heavy CGI work. There are a lot of personal fights and sword battles and very little heavy computer graphics. This is a nice idea, almost as though they are paying homage to the pirate and swashbuckler films of the 40s and 50s. Really, Depp's Sparrow is not that far from Burt Lancaster's ""The Crimson Pirate"". At least in temperament and tone.An early scene in London provides an excuse for Sparrow to escape from the Royal Guard by jumping from the roof of one moving carriage to the next, swinging from bunting and falling into the lap of a very surprising cameo. Later, the swordfights and a scene between Sparrow and Barbossa aboard Ponce de Leon's shipwreck, all help to recreate the sense of daring and speed we love about the first (and maybe the second) ""Pirates"" films.As Angelica is an old flame, Sparrow turns on the charm, trying to flirt his way back into her good graces. But these moments are too familiar and become boring. He tries the same moves on Keira Knightley in the first three films, with the same success rate, the same reactions and the same expressions when they don't work. Well, she isn't receptive this time, best to keep trying... And trying... And trying. The difference between Cruz's Angelica and Knightley's Elizabeth is that Angelica is allowed to flirt back every so often. Elizabeth was attached to (shudder) Will, Bloom's character. It took all of her energy to create something with that vacuum of emotion, she didn't have anything left for Depp. But seriously, because she and Will are always circling one another, and because these are Disney films, she couldn't show any interest or return Captain Jack's attentions. In ""Stranger Tides"", Angelica masquerades as Blackbeard's ""daughter"", leaving her free to flirt a little because she is romantically unattached.I found the last ""Pirates"" film to be a complete misfire. It seemed like director Gore Verbinski was trying to legitimize the success of the series and make a 'serious' pirate film. That film runs for two hours and forty five minutes and the characters stand around and talk for a good two hours. These are popcorn films. Yes, we need story, we need character development. But if the writer(s) and director have their jobs well, they have created a viable, visual, interesting universe for the characters to inhabit. If they have done their job really well, they don't need to legitimize anything and the audience will enjoy the ride. For ""At World's End"", they didn't do their jobs that well.So for ""Stranger Tides"", they made some changes. Depp is in practically every frame of the film, a big change from the last film. There is also very little exposition. If they take any time to elaborate the plot, they do so right before, during or right after some action. Marshall seems to get what this film should be. It should be fun. The amped up action and Jack's increased presence are good changes.But the film suffers from too little exposition. The opening scenes in London involve Jack posing as a judge in an attempt to free his long-suffering First Mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally). Much later, they cross paths again and this seems to remind Jack of the man's very existence. Why go to so much trouble and risk to save someone only to completely forget about them? Later, there is a pretty significant plot hole which isn't necessary. Because the writers and director are creating this universe, they are creating the rules. If you have to break your own rules, you didn't do a good enough job in the first place.""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a step in the right direction. It features a good performance by McShane, but it is still far away from the magic of the first film.",3,"Aaaar, It Be A Good Step In The Right Direction.",1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,9088,"['Very',

1391284,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B004A8ZWUQ,Tom Birkenstock,"[1, 2]","The original Pirates of the Caribbean had the element of surprise on its side.  No one suspected that a film based on an antiquated attraction at Disney World would foster much entertainment value, and certainly no one thought it would become such a cultural juggernaut that it would spawn three sequels and catapult Johnny Depp to the top of the Hollywood A-list food chain, making him an international star.  I had been a Depp fan since childhood and had enjoyed his status as an idiosyncratic outsider, content to play dress up with his friends, and when I first saw a preview for Pirates of the Caribbean, I must admit that my eyes rolled and asked myself, what the hell is Depp thinking?  And then the movie came out.  Not only was the film filled with clever conceits, thanks in part to a screenplay that felt like the intricate work of an old fashioned clockmaker, but Depp turned in a surprisingly rousing performance as the effete, possibly insane pirate, Jack Sparrow.  Here was a multi-million dollar film and in the center stood a character fueled by pure id, stabbing other characters in the back in a moments notice while never letting the audience in on whether he does so out of a sense of self preservation or as part of a grander, more heroic scheme.  If there is a Falstaff for the 21st century, then his name is Jack Sparrow.And then the sequels happened.  Weighted down by their ever expanding mythology, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End limped through their expanding running time while dragging along enough subplots for at least five more films.  At the beginning of the first film we are concerned with Depp's attempts to reclaim his ship and the romance between Will and Elizabeth, but by the end of the third movie a major plot point pivoted around the unrequited love of Calypso, a tertiary character who would have been mostly forgettable if she weren't played by the immensely talented Naomie Harris.  Where The Curse of the Black Pearl's tight plotting and clearly established supernatural rules made it seem shorter than its two hours and fifteen minutes, the two sequels felt much, much longer than their already bloated running times.  I understand that the filmmakers were trying to give us a bang for our buck, but they also needed to learn how to leave the audience wanting more.It is with these widely held critiques in mind that the filmmakers went into the fourth Pirates movie, On Stranger Tides.  And there are several elements that tell us that the movie is attempting to swing all the way back around to the original film in hopes of bottling a little of the magic that made the first film a runaway success.  First, Will and Elizabeth have been jettisoned from the film.  This is good news because these two characters seemed unnecessary in the last two movies, and it increasingly felt as if the actors had merely wandered onto the set because they had nowhere else to go.  Second, the film is only tenuously connected to the byzantine mythology of the last few films.  Sure, characters like Captain Barbossa show up, but it is not necessary to be intimately familiar with the details of his curse, death and resurrection from the other three films.  Both of these choices allow the film to focus on what really matters: the character of Jack Sparrow.So, does the film actually accomplish what it set out to do?  Is On Stranger Tides a return to form?  In a word, no.  But that doesn't mean that it's not a good time, and the film bodes well for the inevitable sequels coming our way.  Plenty of film critics have taken On Stranger Tides to task for not living up to the promises of the first film, and while their complaints are not without merit, I strongly believe the movie largely delivers.On Stranger Tides follows multiple entities as they each lie, steal and cheat in order to make their way to the elusive Fountain of Youth, first discovered and then re-lost by Ponce De Leon nearly two centuries previous.  The entries into this mad, mad chase are the Spanish government, a coldly calculating participant, the British government, lead by former pirate Barbossa, the cutthroat Blackbeard, and of course Jack Sparrow himself.  After a rousing opening escape from the clutches of the British, Jack finds himself tracking down rumors of another Jack Sparrow who's gathering a crew in London.  The Jack Sparrow impersonator happens to be an old flame, Angelica, in costume, a play on Jack's effeminate mannerisms as well as the plethora of Jack Sparrow wannabes that walk the street on Halloween.  A nun who broke her vow of chastity to Jack, Angelica doesn't quite trust the pirate, but she needs the map to the Fountain of Youth, which happens to be in Jack Sparrow's possession.Of course, there are a plethora of double and triple crosses that occur throughout the film.  Like a good magician, the film does a lot with just a little slight of hand.  Angelica can not exactly be trusted (or can she?), and Jack winds up in the forced servitude of the pirate Blackbeard, played with suave menace by Ian McShane.  Concerned about a prophecy about his impending death, Blackbeard is also searching out the Fountain of Youth, but in order to actually use the fountain, he must procure a tear drop from a mermaid.  In the world of the Pirates movies, mermaids are vicious creatures who put on a doe eyed veneer in order to, like the sirens, lure men to their death.  The mermaid segment is particularly well executed.  The director, Rob Marshall, uses beautiful underwater shots of the small boats that have gone out to lure the mermaids, while ratcheting up the tension.  We know from the reactions of the sailors that the mermaids are dangerous and they could strike at any moment, creating an air pregnant with tension.With the inclusion of the mermaids, however, comes one of the film's failings, an unnecessary subplot that often tries the audience's patience.  A young missionary character who has been captured by Blackbeard is dropped like a cannonball into the middle of the film for no particular reason.  We are told who he is thanks to some leaden exposition by Angelica, and when they do finally capture a mermaid, her and the missionary start making googly eyes at one another.  The mermaid and the missionary seem like they're replacements for Will and Elizabeth, but unlike those two characters the audience has little investment in this couple.  The movie has a few other flaws as well.  The filmmakers regularly break the show not tell rule.  Captain Barbossa, for example, explains to Jack about how he lost the ship, The Black Pearl, to Blackbeard, telling him that Blackbeard's magic turned the ship against its own men, its ropes cutting down the Pearl's crew.  While he told this story, I couldn't help but think, that would have been cool to actually see, but thanks for sharing anyway Barbossa.But despite these flaws, On Stranger Tides is a film whose desire to please is evident.  All the main actors do a fantastic job, even if McShane is elbowed out of much of the film by some unnecessary subplots.  There are also some great twists throughout the movie.  I won't spoil them for you here, but let us just say that not everyone is searching for the Fountain of Youth for eternal life.  So even when the movie stumbles, it still entertains.  On Stranger Tides is not the return to form it so desperately wants to be, but it is a nice indicator that if we are going to get at least two more of these Pirates movies, then at the very least they will serve as good summer diversions.",4,Uneven but enjoyable summer fun,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,7559,"['original', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'had', 'element', 'surprise', 'side', 'one',

1391285,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B004A8ZWUQ,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[1, 3]","It's already been four years since the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, now Jack Sparrow and his matey's are returning for a third sequel with On Strangers Tide. This fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film is of course going to be a bit different from previous Pirates movie as a result of the original trilogy concluded and some characters that are no longer present.  This time the charismatic Jack Sparrow is on a new quest this time looking for the fountain of youth, with some old acquaintances of past making an appearance.  On Strangers Tide wastes no time and goes straight into action and asks questions later. There is more dialogue and development in the second half of the film than in the first half, where the viewer is thrown into action almost right away. Pirates of the Caribbean movies always take a certain time to really get started but this one is exception to the rule. At 137 minutes, On Strangers Tide is a little shorter than the previous two POTC films, Dead Man's Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007) but its length is still over 2 hours and comparable to The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)'s 143 minutes.Will and Elisabeth are not in this fourth film but I didn't miss them or at least not as much as I thought I would. While it would have been nice to see Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley return (maybe they will in a future Pirates who knows?), this movie kept me plenty interested and those actors not being present did not hurt the movie at all. Johnny Depp remains excellent as Jack Sparrow this fourth time around, as good as ever.  Geoffrey Rush was once more terrific as Barbossa. Penelope Cruz was great as Angelica, a former lover of Sparrow and daughter of Blackbeard. Depp and Cruz had on screen chemistry and were believable and worked out well. Ian McShane delivered a solid performance as Blackbeard but I guess I somehow expected him to be a more frightening character perhaps because of the Blackbeard legend. I can understand why some fans may not enjoy this fourth entry as much as the others. Some reviewers complained that the movie has too much action and maybe that's true but I can hardly see a fan of the series hating this one, liking it less or being disappointed perhaps. The fountain of youth was a decent enough storyline and the inclusion of the mermaids was a nice one and was very fitting into this Pirate universe (I still think they don't have fangs). To me, the mermaid attack scene shown in the previews is a highlight of the movie. I was slightly worried about the zombie pirates because I thought it may have been too over the top but that turned out fine as well. I quite liked the concept for this fourth film, the chase for the fountain of youth, and I thought the inclusion of famed pirate Blackbeard and the mermaids were interesting and in a way even breathed new life into the series while still being familiar and true to the previous films.As for the 3D effect I must say it was surprisingly good, I don't mean amazing or revolutionary but I simply like how the effects didn't overshadow any event or were purely useless. What we have with On Strangers Tide is an effective 3D and that's coming from someone who's not a fan of 3D films. They didn't make the movie about 3D which some modern movies do; this one doesn't rely solely on 3D effects because it doesn't have to.I like On Strangers Tide and find it to be a very enjoyable Pirates film overall, to me this one is much better than the third film, At World's End. On Strangers Tide may not be the best POTC movie but it has an interesting story, is entertaining and watchable which as far as sequels are concerned is always a good thing. I feel OST is maybe a little less complicated than earlier Pirates film, it's easier to follow that someone who has never seen any POTC films would not be lost.

When that fails, the crown attempts to coerce him into setting sail for the fabled fountain of youth. However, while Jack is in possession of neither ship nor crew, (and the film is without former cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley who elected to pursue other projects) Sparrow's captors are under the impression that he has a ship and is presently amassing a crew. Sparrow investigates and discovers someone impersonating him for their own purposes. A woman, of all things. In fact, a woman from his past by the name of Angelica (played by Penelope Cruz).Clearly the story is complicated and the viewer is asked to make many accommodations where plausibility and time are concerned.

1391301,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004A8ZWUQ,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[7, 9]","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy... which should probably have stayed a trilogy. Gore Verbinski directed the original trilogy, but for reasons that defy understanding On Stranger Tides was put in the hands of Rob Marshall, a very talented director of musicals but one with no experience - and apparently no feel whatsoever - for action films. The differences are telling, and not in a good way.There are some good parts to On Stranger Tides, particularly an early scene where Jack Sparrow meets King George II (marvelously done by Richard Griffiths).  But for the most part, as a film it resembles a ship caught in a storm, lurching this way and that in a barely controlled manner. Compared to the Gore Verbinski films, On Stranger Tides has a disjointed feel to it, with scene after scene feeling distinctly recycled, leaving the viewer with a sense of haven't-we-been-here-before? This is also hammered home by the Hans Zimmer score, half of which sounds like it was inserted without even the slightest changes from the earlier films.In a nutshell, the basic plot is Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) ends up being shanghaied by none other than Blackbeard (Ian McShane), arguably the most infamous pirate of all time, and his daughter, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), in a search for the legendary Fountain of Youth, pursued by former-pirate-now-privateer Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). There is a somewhat interesting romantic subplot involving a missionary (Sam Claflin) and a mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), but it's almost a distraction from everything else and not enough to make up for the lack of heart in the rest of the film.That said, the film lacks smoothness, scenes often change in a jarring manner, too many chase scenes going on far too long, and quite frankly, too much of Johnny Depp having to act in a vacuum. Given the acknowledged talent of most of the cast, one can only blame the director.  Ian McShane's Blackbeard is about as terrifying as your average surly drunk in a bar. Penelope Cruz's Angelica has all the passion of a fashion plate stepping through a photo shoot.  Even Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa and Kevin McNally's Gibbs feel like they're improvising most of the time, trying to remember how they did it the first time around.The film also suffers from the changes among the minor pirate characters. The comic pirate pair Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) are completely absent from On Stranger Tides, a bizarre decision on someone's part, and their loss is keenly felt. A new character Scrum (Stephen Graham) has been added but is a pale and only mildly funny substitute. Another new character, credited only as Cabin Boy (appealingly played by fifteen-year-old Robbie Kay) had potential, but is largely wasted by being little to do except stand there and react.There are two fun cameos in the film, one by Keith Richards reprising his role as Captain Teague, Jack's father, and Judi Densch as an aristocratic lady Jack unexpectedly drops in on (literally) while making his escape from the king.

In truth, I can only recommend this for Johnny Depp/Jack Sparrow fans who want to see it all, even if the standards aren't up to the first three films.PS -- In spite of the title referencing Tim Powers' marvelous pirate fantasy novel On Stranger Tides, the film only borrows a few plot elements - Blackbeard, the Fountain of Youth, zombies, etc - from the novel and otherwise has little to do with it.

One of the ""shill"" critics said it was the best of the series -- and there's a big grain of truth in that.""PotC2"" and ""PotC3"" -- regardless of their merits as stories -- were plot-heavy. That there were three groups with differing, conflicting goals -- which were never particularly clear -- didn't help one's enjoyment.""PotC4"" has a clearer and less-baroque storyline. There are still three groups, but we know what two of them are doing, and why. (The Spaniards' motive isn't revealed until the end, and it's a real -- and highly logical -- surprise.)Johnny Depp is back to playing the (relatively) more-sober and less-overtly flamboyant Captain Jack of the first film, a major plus. (Don't forget that he got an Oscar nomination for that performance. A best-actor nomination for fantasy, sci-fi, horror, or action roles is almost unheard-of. *)The first two-thirds are extremely funny, but the story turns uncharacteristically (for this series) dark towards the end, becoming a kind of ""Splash Meets Jaws"". Also uncharacteristically, the story (semi-)seriously examines issues of morality and redemption. The ending is startlingly misogynistic -- which is not surprising behavior for pirates.If I have any generic complaint about the series as a whole, it's that there are no //really good// sword fights. This is probably for practical reasons -- none of the stories builds to a sword-fighting climax (as ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and ""Rob Roy"" do), so there's no point in training the actors. The days of Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are long gone.The PG-13 rating is justified -- this is not a film for the youngsters. (I seriously question the ethics of LEGO's marketing products based specifically on this film.)I really enjoyed ""On Stranger Tides"", when I didn't expect to. I can't guarantee anything, but if you liked the first one, you'll probably like the last.* Frederic March got an Oscar for ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"", and Anthony Hopkins got an (undeserved) Oscar for ""The Silence of the Lambs"".",4,another pleasant surprise...,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,2161,"['enjoying', 'John', 'Carter', 'was', 'equally', 'surprised', 'discover', 'PotC4', 'was', 'not', 'oven-ready', 'gobbler', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'One', 'shill', 'critics', 'said', 'was', 'best', 'series', 'big', 'grain', 'truth', 'PotC2', 'PotC3', 'regardless', 'merits', 'stories', 'were', 'plot-heavy', 'were', 'three', 'groups', 'differing', 'conflicting', 'goals', 'were', 'never', 'particularly', 'clear', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'PotC4', 'clearer', 'less-baroque', 'storyline', 'are', 'still', 'three', 'groups', 'know', 'what', 'two', 'are', 'doing', 'why', 'Spaniards', 'motive', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'end', 'real', 'highly', 'logical', 'surprise', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'back', 'playing', 'relatively', 'more-sober', 'less-overtly', 'flamboyant', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'first', 'film', 'major', 'plus', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'best-actor', 'nomination', 'fantasy', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'action', 'roles', 'almost', 'unheard-of', '*', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'are', 'extremely', 'funny', 'story', 'uncharacteristically', 'series', 'dark', 'end', 'becoming', 'kind', 'Splash', 'Meets', 'Jaws', 'Also', 'uncharacteristically', 'story', 'semi-', 'seriously', 'issues', 'morality', 'redemption', 'ending', 'startlingly', 'misogynistic', 'not', 'surprising', 'behavior', 'pirates.If', 'have', 'generic', 'complaint', 'series', 'whole', 'are', '//really', 'good//', 'sword', 'fights', 'probably', 'practical', 'reasons', 'none', 'stories', 'sword-fighting', 'climax', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Rob', 'Roy', 'do', 'point', 'training', 'actors', 'days', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'are', 'long', 'gone.The', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'justified', 'not', 'film', 'youngsters', 'seriously', 'question', 'ethics', 'LEGO', 'marketing', 'products', 'based', 'specifically', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Stranger', 'Tides', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'anything', 'liked', 'first', 'one', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'last', '*', 'Frederic', 'March', 'got', 'Oscar', 'Dr', 'Jekyll', 'Mr', 'Hyde', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'got', 'undeserved', 'Oscar', 'Silence', 'Lambs']",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
