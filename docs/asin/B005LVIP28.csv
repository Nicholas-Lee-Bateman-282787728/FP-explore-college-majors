1493750,A3UUF0T87UNS9R,B005LVIP28,argytunes,"[9, 12]","Like so many current fans of this series, I enjoyed WAGON TRAIN when it originally aired on NBC.  First in Black & White...then in color!  The 7th year when the show went 90 minutes and the final (8th) season when it returned to a 1 hour format.While there have been comments (good and bad) about the packaging...and the fact that John McIntire couldn't measure up to Ward Bond as a wagonmaster, I'd like to offer a suggestion?  Release the entire series NOW for a reasonable price!How many of you reading this are as confused as I am about the programs that are currently available?  There are 2 complete collections of Season 1 with different packaging, one complete collection of Seasons 2, 3, and 4 in a metal tin?  Add to this a Millcreek Western DVD BONANZA 4-pack which contains 3 episodes of WAGON TRAIN on DVD Disc 4...a collection of WAGON TRAIN shows that features the color episodes from season 6, and a few oddball 25 dvd sets with random WAGON TRAIN shows interspersed with other 60 and 30 minute Western TV shows.Probably the most important thing to consider is the fact that the original audience who grew up watching WAGON TRAIN in the 50s and 60s has..or will..eventually die! This is the reason why many of the big box stores like Walmart and Target won't bother offering available sets for a reasonable price!Here's my question. How difficult would it be for MILLCREEK ENTERTAINMENT to release the entire WAGON TRAIN series at an affordable price?  Would anybody else purchase all 8 seasons...aside from myself?",4,WAGON TRAIN...how about the entire series...now?,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,1531,"['so', 'many', 'current', 'fans', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'WAGON', 'TRAIN', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'NBC', 'First', 'Black', 'White', 'then', 'color', '7th', 'year', 'when', 'show', 'went', '90', 'minutes', 'final', '8th', 'season', 'when', 'returned', '1', 'hour', 'format.While', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'comments', 'good', 'bad', 'packaging', 'fact', 'John', 'McIntire', 'could', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'wagonmaster', ""'d"", 'like', 'offer', 'suggestion', 'Release', 'entire', 'series', 'NOW', 'reasonable', 'price', 'How', 'many', 'reading', 'are', 'as', 'confused', 'am', 'programs', 'are', 'currently', 'available', 'are', '2', 'complete', 'collections', 'Season', '1', 'different', 'packaging', 'one', 'complete', 'collection', 'Seasons', '2', '3', '4', 'metal', 'tin', 'Add', 'Millcreek', 'Western', 'DVD', 'BONANZA', '4-pack', '3', 'episodes', 'WAGON', 'TRAIN', 'DVD', 'Disc', '4', 'collection', 'WAGON', 'TRAIN', 'color', 'season', '6', 'few', 'oddball', '25', 'dvd', 'sets', 'random', 'WAGON', 'TRAIN', 'shows', 'interspersed', 'other', '60', '30', 'minute', 'Western', 'TV', 'shows.Probably', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'consider', 'fact', 'original', 'audience', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'WAGON', 'TRAIN', '50s', '60s', 'has..or', 'will..eventually', 'die', 'reason', 'why', 'many', 'big', 'box', 'stores', 'Walmart', 'Target', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'offering', 'available', 'sets', 'reasonable', 'price', 'Here', 'question', 'How', 'difficult', 'would', 'be', 'MILLCREEK', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'release', 'entire', 'WAGON', 'TRAIN', 'series', 'affordable', 'price', 'Would', 'anybody', 'else', 'purchase', '8', 'seasons', 'aside']",Wagon Train: Season 4
1493751,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B005LVIP28,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","New trials and a new wagonmasterThe midpoint season of one of the best of the Golden Age TV Westerns continues to offer up engaging scripts and well-known names to play in them.  Mickey Rooney reprises his 3rd-Season role as greenhorn Samuel T. Evans; George Gobel has a seriocomic part as a country cousin of Major Adams's; Charles Laughton appears as a British Army surgeon, Lee Marvin as a formidably mustached (and machete'd) Mexican bandit, Edgar Buchanan as a tough old cattle baron determined to avenge his son's murder, Leslie Nielsen (then trying to make it in serious parts) as a runaway Easterner who unexpectedly encounters the wife and son he abandoned 10 years before, Ernest Borgnine as a bounty hunter with a score to settle and (unexpectedly) a certain code of honor all his own.  Jim Davis of &#8220;Dallas&#8221; plays a widower with a young son to raise who makes up his mind to find a wife&#8212;and sets his eye on a young Irishwoman (played by Joan O'Brien, who also appeared in &#8220;The Luke Grant Story&#8221; the previous year) who is known to Adams and his boys as having a less-than-savory character.  Annual guest star Dan Duryea reappears as a superstitious farmer and tyrannical father determined to ward off the attentions of James Drury (the future Virginian) from his beaten-down daughter.  Arnold Stang, coke-bottle glasses and all, plays a slightly improbable Chinese in an episode whose story was written by Terry Wilson (Bill Hawks).  Two especially powerful episodes take place in this season: &#8220;Weight of Command,&#8221; which finds Adams fearing that the Cheyennes may attack the train and agonizing over whether he should leave three hunters behind while he tries to get the outfit through a critical pass, and also has a nice meaty part for Hawks; and &#8220;The Prairie Story,&#8221; which focuses on the mental and emotional toll the treeless prairie environment took on westering women.  &#8220;Path of the Serpent&#8221; features Noah Beery Jr. as Ruddy Blaine, the greatest of all mountain men, and Jay Silverheels as his mute Shoshoni companion, the Serpent, who are asked to help bring a young woman to her dying father even though (as Ruddy puts it) &#8220;these mountains is crawlin' with them bloody Utes!&#8221;  Another highpoint is &#8220;The Colter Craven Story,&#8221; which not only provides a large chunk of backstory about Adams and Hawks, but is (I strongly suspect) the original pilot for the series, rejoicing in several clips from the minor classic &#34;Wagonmaster&#34; (in which Bond starred), John Ford as director (he also helmed the movie), and&#8212;under the assumed name of &#8220;Michael Morris,&#8221; but there's no mistaking that voice, even in the dark!&#8212;Bond's longtime pal John Wayne in a bit part as General Sherman, a role he would later reprise in &#34;How the West Was Won.&#34;This was a pivotal season in the series history: Ward Bond died unexpectedly partway through, and it's not fully clear, despite their air dates, how many of the episodes that find Flint and Hawks leading the wagon train were filmed before or after that (a few show John McIntire in the opening credits, but he doesn't appear until &#8220;The Christopher Hale Story,&#8221; broadcast three weeks after Bond's final appearance).  A new scout also joins the wagon train: big, soft-spoken Duke Shannon, played by Scott Miller, who actually appears (without a word of explanation) in the Adams segment &#8220;Weight of Command,&#8221; but is formally introduced, and given some backstory, three months later in &#8220;The Duke Shannon Story.&#8221;",5,New trials and a new wagonmaster,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,3617,"['New', 'trials', 'new', 'wagonmasterThe', 'midpoint', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'Golden', 'Age', 'TV', 'Westerns', 'offer', 'up', 'engaging', 'scripts', 'well-known', 'names', 'play', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', '3rd-Season', 'role', 'greenhorn', 'Samuel', 'T.', 'Evans', 'George', 'Gobel', 'seriocomic', 'part', 'country', 'cousin', 'Major', 'Adams', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'British', 'Army', 'surgeon', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'formidably', 'mustached', 'machete', ""'d"", 'Mexican', 'bandit', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'tough', 'old', 'cattle', 'baron', 'determined', 'avenge', 'son', 'murder', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'then', 'trying', 'make', 'serious', 'parts', 'runaway', 'Easterner', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'wife', 'son', 'abandoned', '10', 'years', 'before', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'score', 'settle', 'unexpectedly', 'certain', 'code', 'honor', 'own', 'Jim', 'Davis', '8220', 'Dallas', '8221', 'widower', 'young', 'son', 'raise', 'who', 'up', 'mind', 'find', 'wife', '8212', 'eye', 'young', 'Irishwoman', 'played', 'Joan', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'also', 'appeared', '8220', 'Luke', 'Grant', 'Story', '8221', 'previous', 'year', 'who', 'known', 'Adams', 'boys', 'having', 'less-than-savory', 'character', 'Annual', 'guest', 'star', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'superstitious', 'farmer', 'tyrannical', 'father', 'determined', 'ward', 'off', 'attentions', 'James', 'Drury', 'future', 'Virginian', 'beaten-down', 'daughter', 'Arnold', 'Stang', 'coke-bottle', 'glasses', 'slightly', 'improbable', 'Chinese', 'episode', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'Terry', 'Wilson', 'Bill', 'Hawks', 'Two', 'especially', 'powerful', 'episodes', 'take', 'place', 'season', '8220', 'Weight', 'Command', '8221', 'Adams', 'fearing', 'Cheyennes', 'may', 'attack', 'train', 'agonizing', 'should', 'leave', 'three', 'hunters', 'get', 'outfit', 'critical', 'pass', 'also', 'nice', 'meaty', 'part', 'Hawks', '8220', 'Prairie', 'Story', '8221', 'mental', 'emotional', 'toll', 'treeless', 'prairie', 'environment', 'took', 'westering', 'women', '8220', 'Path', 'Serpent', '8221', 'features', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'Jr.', 'Ruddy', 'Blaine', 'greatest', 'mountain', 'men', 'Jay', 'Silverheels', 'mute', 'Shoshoni', 'companion', 'Serpent', 'who', 'are', 'asked', 'help', 'bring', 'young', 'woman', 'dying', 'father', 'even', 'though', 'Ruddy', '8220', 'mountains', 'crawlin', 'bloody', '8221', 'highpoint', '8220', 'Colter', 'Craven', 'Story', '8221', 'not', 'only', 'large', 'chunk', 'backstory', 'Adams', 'Hawks', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'original', 'pilot', 'series', 'rejoicing', 'several', 'clips', 'minor', 'classic', '34', 'Wagonmaster', '34', 'Bond', 'starred', 'John', 'Ford', 'director', 'also', 'helmed', 'movie', '8212', 'assumed', 'name', '8220', 'Michael', 'Morris', '8221', 'mistaking', 'voice', 'even', 'dark', '8212', 'Bond', 'longtime', 'pal', 'John', 'Wayne', 'bit', 'part', 'General', 'Sherman', 'role', 'would', 'later', 'reprise', '34', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won.', '34', 'was', 'pivotal', 'season', 'series', 'history', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'died', 'unexpectedly', 'partway', 'not', 'fully', 'clear', 'air', 'dates', 'how', 'many', 'episodes', 'find', 'Flint', 'Hawks', 'leading', 'wagon', 'train', 'were', 'filmed', 'few', 'show', 'John', 'McIntire', 'opening', 'credits', ""n't"", 'appear', '8220', 'Christopher', 'Hale', 'Story', '8221', 'broadcast', 'three', 'weeks', 'Bond', 'final', 'appearance', 'new', 'scout', 'also', 'wagon', 'train', 'big', 'soft-spoken', 'Duke', 'Shannon', 'played', 'Scott', 'Miller', 'who', 'actually', 'word', 'explanation', 'Adams', 'segment', '8220', 'Weight', 'Command', '8221', 'formally', 'introduced', 'given', 'backstory', 'three', 'months', 'later', '8220', 'Duke', 'Shannon', 'Story.', '8221']",Wagon Train: Season 4

1493753,A2KDQGKHZZN5FI,B005LVIP28,DavidJohnStock,"[4, 4]","As I now possess the first 4 seasons of Wagon Train that will be sufficient for me as that marked the passing of Ward Bond the only wagonmaster for me, I already own the 16 disc set released previously so that will be enough of the McIntire years.The last time Robert Horton spoke with Ward Bond he discussed a future script that he was concerned about the quality of, like all series Wagon Train had a few dudds amongst its many gems.One episode that I would call a dudd was the ""Amos Gibbon Story"" from season 3, Robert Horton rides into a town to drown his sorrows after an augument with Ward Bond,drugged and sentanced by a crooked town judge to work in a mine. This to me is a direct and bad copy of a ""Cheyenne"" episode called ""The TRAP"".The ""Cheyenne"" episode was far better with  more detail and the viewer got to see Clint with his shirt off,after a couple of days Ward Bond comes searching for his ex-scout to mend the fences between them. He sees Hortons Appaloosa {named ""Stormy Night"" called ""Stormy"" by Horton} still tied to the hitching rail with its saddle on  after some days, this should have been changed prior to filming- at least Clint Walkers horse was in a stable.During Ward Bond's final season there was an episode called ""The Colter Craven Story"", this reunited him again with director John Ford {even a cameo appearance from John Wayne} the final 30 seconds was vintage Ward Bond: Major Adams to Charlie Wooster- ""hav'nt you got any work to do?"" - Charlie-""yeh yeh yeh""Major Adams- ""then go do it"", Major Adams to BILL HAWKS- ""and what do you get paid for?""""so that you can yell at me""- replies Hawks"".The camera then sets on Major Adams- ""all right everybody lets get our teams hitched up, we pull out in 15 minutes.Major Adams walks toward the camera- ""come on we've got a river to cross'  Wagons Hooooo"".For me the first 4 years of Wagon Train had no betters on television because of its excellant cast of 4 leading actors,Ward Bond -Terry Wilson-Robert Horton-Frank McGrath. Season 4 had an episode called ""The Jose Moralis Story"" starring Lee Marvin, this episode ends with the great Terry Wilson {former stunt man}taking off his saddle and throwing it at Frank McGrath,that to my mind was a great episode with a fitting if unusual way of ending it.One interesting factor concerning season 4 was I feel to be a premature use of McIntires image at the beginning of a couple of episodes,numbers 131 and 133 though he does not appear-in fact no Wagonmaster appears- with 131""The Sam Elder Story"", that episode ends with Bill saying to Charlie ""I guess that is what we all have to have, a reason to go on"". Then in episode 132 the Major is back in ""Weight Of Command"" with 2 mighty scenes between he and Hawks, then in episode 133 ""The Prairie Story"" the drawing of McIntire is back again with the titles though no Wagonmaster is present. Episode 134 ""Path Of The Serpent"" the drawing of Ward Bond is back again though again no Wagonmaster is present as is the case with 135 ""The Odyssey Of Flint McCullough, It was episode 136 ""The Beth Pearson Story"" that was to be the final one for Ward Bond though his image still appears with 137 @ 138 @ 139 ,I believe the image of McIntire should have begun with episode 140.I am fortunate in having season 4 showing now on a free to air digital channel at 6:30am Australian Television on Saturdays as I type this in February 2012, it competes interestingly enough with ""Naked City"" on another channel starring John McIntire perhaps if McIntire had not taken over from the great Ward Bond he would not have had weight in his saddlebags, with the Major, Charlie and Bill playing off one another the show could not fail.",5,Farewell to Ward Bond,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,3687,"['now', 'possess', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'will', 'be', 'sufficient', 'marked', 'passing', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'only', 'wagonmaster', 'already', 'own', '16', 'disc', 'set', 'released', 'previously', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'McIntire', 'years.The', 'last', 'time', 'Robert', 'Horton', 'spoke', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'discussed', 'future', 'script', 'was', 'concerned', 'quality', 'series', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'had', 'few', 'dudds', 'amongst', 'many', 'gems.One', 'episode', 'would', 'call', 'dudd', 'was', 'Amos', 'Gibbon', 'Story', 'season', '3', 'Robert', 'Horton', 'town', 'drown', 'sorrows', 'augument', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'drugged', 'sentanced', 'crooked', 'town', 'judge', 'work', 'mine', 'direct', 'bad', 'copy', 'Cheyenne', 'episode', 'called', 'TRAP', 'Cheyenne', 'episode', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'detail', 'viewer', 'got', 'see', 'Clint', 'shirt', 'couple', 'days', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'searching', 'ex-scout', 'mend', 'fences', 'Hortons', 'Appaloosa', 'named', 'Stormy', 'Night', 'called', 'Stormy', 'Horton', 'still', 'tied', 'hitching', 'rail', 'saddle', 'days', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'prior', 'filming-', 'least', 'Clint', 'Walkers', 'horse', 'was', 'stable.During', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'episode', 'called', 'Colter', 'Craven', 'Story', 'reunited', 'again', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'even', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'John', 'Wayne', 'final', '30', 'seconds', 'was', 'vintage', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Major', 'Adams', 'Charlie', 'Wooster-', ""hav'nt"", 'got', 'work', 'do', 'Charlie-', 'yeh', 'yeh', 'yeh', 'Major', 'Adams-', 'then', 'go', 'do', 'Major', 'Adams', 'BILL', 'HAWKS-', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'paid', 'so', 'can', 'yell', 'replies', 'Hawks', '.The', 'camera', 'then', 'Major', 'Adams-', 'right', 'everybody', 'get', 'teams', 'hitched', 'up', 'pull', 'out', '15', 'minutes.Major', 'Adams', 'walks', 'camera-', 'come', ""'ve"", 'got', 'river', 'cross', 'Wagons', 'Hooooo', 'first', '4', 'years', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'had', 'betters', 'television', 'excellant', 'cast', '4', 'leading', 'actors', 'Ward', 'Bond', '-Terry', 'Wilson-Robert', 'Horton-Frank', 'McGrath', 'Season', '4', 'had', 'episode', 'called', 'Jose', 'Moralis', 'Story', 'starring', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'episode', 'great', 'Terry', 'Wilson', 'former', 'stunt', 'man', 'taking', 'off', 'saddle', 'throwing', 'Frank', 'McGrath', 'mind', 'was', 'great', 'episode', 'fitting', 'unusual', 'way', 'ending', 'it.One', 'interesting', 'factor', 'concerning', 'season', '4', 'was', 'feel', 'be', 'premature', 'use', 'McIntires', 'image', 'beginning', 'couple', 'episodes', 'numbers', '131', '133', 'not', 'appear-in', 'fact', 'Wagonmaster', 'appears-', '131', 'Sam', 'Elder', 'Story', 'episode', 'Bill', 'saying', 'Charlie', 'guess', 'what', 'have', 'have', 'reason', 'go', 'Then', 'episode', '132', 'Major', 'back', 'Weight', 'Command', '2', 'mighty', 'scenes', 'Hawks', 'then', 'episode', '133', 'Prairie', 'Story', 'drawing', 'McIntire', 'back', 'again', 'titles', 'Wagonmaster', 'present', 'Episode', '134', 'Path', 'Serpent', 'drawing', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'Wagonmaster', 'present', 'case', '135', 'Odyssey', 'Flint', 'McCullough', 'was', 'episode', '136', 'Beth', 'Pearson', 'Story', 'was', 'be', 'final', 'one', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'image', 'still', '137', '@', '138', '@', '139', 'believe', 'image', 'McIntire', 'should', 'have', 'begun', 'episode', '140.I', 'am', 'fortunate', 'having', 'season', '4', 'showing', 'now', 'free', 'air', 'digital', 'channel', '6:30am', 'Australian', 'Television', 'Saturdays', 'type', 'February', '2012', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'Naked', 'City', 'channel', 'starring', 'John', 'McIntire', 'perhaps', 'McIntire', 'had', 'not', 'taken', 'over', 'great', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'weight', 'saddlebags', 'Major', 'Charlie', 'Bill', 'playing', 'off', 'one', 'show', 'could', 'not', 'fail']",Wagon Train: Season 4

Sadly Ward Bond passed away during this season and he is replaced by John Mcintire. Mcintire was a versatile good actor but for me Ward Bond held a special magic and the series was never the same, and when Robert Horton departed a couple of years later the series lost so much of it's great characterisation. I always stayed loyal to the series throughout it's run but even several years later when it aired I still missed Bond's presence. His interplay with Horton was a joy and no one could match his jousts with Frank Mcgrath and Terry Wilson ( they were real life friends who Bond insisted had roles in Wagon Train ). For me Chris Hale was rather a lifeless character in comparison to Major Seth Adams. Bond's last episode to air is the poignant Beth Pearson Story where he meets his old true love again. You have to imagine that at the end he changed his mind and returned to her instead of the Wagon Train. I will not be purchasing any sets after this season as for me the series rolls to it's end here.I admit an interest in seeing once again the episode where Mcintire becomes wagonmaster, as said he does a good job and no doubt happily many fans will still enjoy the series, it's just not for me after Bond's death. I didn't really enjoy many of the color episodes for that reason.Whichever way you look at it Wagon Train was a landmark series and I really look forward to this release.",5,Ward Bond's final bow,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,1495,"['mixture', 'joy', 'sadness', 'anticipate', 'season', 'four', 'wonderful', 'western', 'series', 'Sadly', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'passed', 'away', 'season', 'replaced', 'John', 'Mcintire', 'Mcintire', 'was', 'versatile', 'good', 'actor', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'held', 'special', 'magic', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'when', 'Robert', 'Horton', 'departed', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'series', 'lost', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'characterisation', 'always', 'stayed', 'loyal', 'series', 'run', 'even', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'aired', 'still', 'missed', 'Bond', 'presence', 'interplay', 'Horton', 'was', 'joy', 'one', 'could', 'match', 'jousts', 'Frank', 'Mcgrath', 'Terry', 'Wilson', 'were', 'real', 'life', 'friends', 'who', 'Bond', 'insisted', 'had', 'roles', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'Chris', 'Hale', 'was', 'rather', 'lifeless', 'character', 'comparison', 'Major', 'Seth', 'Adams', 'Bond', 'last', 'episode', 'air', 'poignant', 'Beth', 'Pearson', 'Story', 'where', 'old', 'true', 'love', 'again', 'have', 'imagine', 'end', 'changed', 'mind', 'returned', 'instead', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'purchasing', 'sets', 'season', 'series', 'end', 'here.I', 'admit', 'interest', 'seeing', 'once', 'again', 'episode', 'where', 'Mcintire', 'wagonmaster', 'said', 'good', 'job', 'doubt', 'happily', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'series', 'just', 'not', 'Bond', 'death', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'many', 'color', 'reason.Whichever', 'way', 'look', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'was', 'landmark', 'series', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'release']",Wagon Train: Season 4

I say it's my last set because this is Ward Bond's last season before passing away and the show wasn't the same after he was gone.  Not only is the scene in episode 9 with John Wayne legendary, but the episode contains generous amounts of footage Ford used from his 1950 movie, ""Wagon Master"" which also starred Ward Bond as a Mormon elder heading a wagon train west. Of course, ""Wagon Master"" was the inspiration for the TV show ""Wagon Train.""  It is interesting to see how many of the movie's scenes were used and how Ford was able to 'cut' into them with interaction between Major Adams, Bill and Charlie Wooster.I still recall the sad morning my fifth grade class in 1960 learned that Ward Bond had died. The sadness was compounded by the news that country singer Johnny Horton had died within hours of Bond's passing.  For a ten-year-old, that news was hard to take after learning the truth about Santa Claus.",4,"John Wayne, John Ford and Ward Bond..All In One Episode",1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,1039,"['John', 'Ford', 'directed', 'episode', '9', 'Colter', 'Craven', 'Story', 'bought', 'set', 'last', 'set', 'series', 'say', 'last', 'set', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'last', 'season', 'passing', 'away', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'was', 'gone', 'Not', 'only', 'scene', 'episode', '9', 'John', 'Wayne', 'legendary', 'episode', 'generous', 'amounts', 'footage', 'Ford', 'used', '1950', 'movie', 'Wagon', 'Master', 'also', 'starred', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Mormon', 'elder', 'heading', 'wagon', 'train', 'west', 'course', 'Wagon', 'Master', 'was', 'inspiration', 'TV', 'show', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'movie', 'scenes', 'were', 'used', 'how', 'Ford', 'was', 'able', ""'cut"", 'interaction', 'Major', 'Adams', 'Bill', 'Charlie', 'Wooster.I', 'still', 'recall', 'sad', 'morning', 'fifth', 'grade', 'class', '1960', 'learned', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'had', 'died', 'sadness', 'was', 'compounded', 'news', 'country', 'singer', 'Johnny', 'Horton', 'had', 'died', 'hours', 'Bond', 'passing', 'ten-year-old', 'news', 'was', 'hard', 'take', 'learning', 'truth', 'Santa', 'Claus']",Wagon Train: Season 4

I wonder if anyone else has experienced these problems.In the Christopher Hale Story there appears to be two faint lines running down the middle of the screen throughout most of the episode.  They look like a ghost film strip that has been superimposed over the film.  While I realize that these things can happen, and there is a disclaimer at the beginning of each disc about possible defects that have not been able to be eliminated, I am wondering if this is just on my disc or others have experienced it.But the most egregious defect is in the Jim Bridger Story episode.  There appears to be a chunk of several minutes missing from the middle of the episode.  This makes it difficult to understand what has transpired that has led to the members of the wagon train agreeing to help the army.  The story picks up with two women in a wagon and a gun shot is heard and one comments that someone has died and a child has been born.  Am I the only one with this defect or is it in all of the discs?  The episode is shortened by at least four or five minutes shorter than the normal episode running time.Has anyone else noticed these defects?  I haven't viewed any other episodes so far, so I don't know if it is just a matter of problems with these two discs.",4,Aa few Glitches,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,1420,"['am', 'delighted', 'have', 'new', 'selection', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'was', 'little', 'dissapointing', 'find', 'few', 'problems', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'have', 'watched', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'else', 'experienced', 'Christopher', 'Hale', 'Story', 'there', 'be', 'two', 'faint', 'lines', 'running', 'down', 'middle', 'screen', 'most', 'episode', 'look', 'ghost', 'film', 'strip', 'been', 'superimposed', 'film', 'realize', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'disclaimer', 'beginning', 'disc', 'possible', 'defects', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'be', 'eliminated', 'am', 'wondering', 'just', 'disc', 'others', 'have', 'experienced', 'it.But', 'most', 'egregious', 'defect', 'Jim', 'Bridger', 'Story', 'episode', 'be', 'chunk', 'several', 'minutes', 'missing', 'middle', 'episode', 'difficult', 'understand', 'what', 'transpired', 'led', 'members', 'wagon', 'train', 'agreeing', 'help', 'army', 'story', 'up', 'two', 'women', 'wagon', 'gun', 'shot', 'heard', 'one', 'comments', 'someone', 'died', 'child', 'been', 'born', 'Am', 'only', 'one', 'defect', 'discs', 'episode', 'shortened', 'least', 'four', 'five', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'normal', 'episode', 'running', 'time.Has', 'anyone', 'else', 'noticed', 'defects', 'have', ""n't"", 'viewed', 'other', 'episodes', 'so', 'far', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'matter', 'problems', 'two', 'discs']",Wagon Train: Season 4

That means I plan to collect all the sets for seasons 1 - 5, the years Robert Horton appeared as Flint.Season 4 was an unusual year, because the management, actors, and crew had to adapt quickly following the unexpected death of Ward Bond.  They did a good job of continuing to produce new episodes on time for each weekly program, but with some mistakes.Remembering that I am a Flint fan, my favorite serious episode of this season is The River Crossing.My favorite lighter mood episode of the season is Don Alvarado  Flint as Zorro.  Actual plot is serious.)Other Flint stories of this season that I especially like are Odyssey of Flint McCullough, Allison Justis, and Earl Packer.(At film festivals, Robert Horton always has high praise for Ernest Borgnine, the guest star in Earl Packer.)Cathy Eckhart is a fine episode with Major Adams as the main regular.Ah Chong (with Arnold Stang as a Chinese cook) and Nellie Jefferson are amusing episodes featuring Charlie Wooster.Path of the Serpent is a good episode with Bill Hawks as the main regular.Wagons Ho! with all the regulars and Mickey Rooney respising his role as a Greenhorn is an enjoyable start to the season.Packaging, defects, etc. - The discs come inside a cardboard book inside a tin box, very much the same as the sets for seasons 2 and 3.  The discs come out of the cardboard book fairly easily, but I've decided to store the set I will use regularly in Tyvek sleeves.  I fast forwarded through all 38 episodes, both of my sets, on my DVD player that is most likely to freeze if there is a problem on a disc.  The discs did not freeze or hang anywhere.The labels on the discs indicate Wagon Train season 4 and the names of the episodes, but don't indicate Disc 1, Disc 2, etc. This is a minor annoyance.Disc 7 (or 60506), the one with Christopher Hale as the first episode, has a couple of minor abnormalities, identical abnormalities on both of my copies.  The Tiburcio Mendez Story has some kind of a break about a minute and a half into the story; this break causes the timer counter to reset to zero. Saul Bevins, the last episode on the same disk, has a similar break around 15 and a half minutes into the episode.  Content missing at these places seems to be small.Overall, I am quite pleased with this set and eagerly waiting for season 5.

The interaction between the Major, Wooster, Hawks, and McCulloch is down to an art by this point. It's the surviving three who hold the series together through the transistion to the Chris Hale latter part of season four. John McIntyre's Hale is very similar to his later portrayal of Clay Grainger (1967-70) on The Virginian (1962-71), where he replaced the late actor Charles Bickford, who had played John Grainger. In both cases McIntyre was brought in for stability, but was not as dynamic as his predecessors.
