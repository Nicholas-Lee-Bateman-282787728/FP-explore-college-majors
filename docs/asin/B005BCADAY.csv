Five Stars!Oh what I would give to be a student of Neil Peart's, but because he is such a great, I would assume the price of such lessons would run very high, and rightfully so. Like he even has the time to do such a thing anyhow. Next best thing is his DVD's explaining the method to the madness which is his fantastic drumming technique, and style.

1452561,A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y,B005BCADAY,"Greg ""Saganite""","[144, 153]","Peart is nothing short of a genius, and to see this iconic MASTER sit and talk eloquently in perfect paragraph after perfect paragraph about HOW MUCH HE HAS LEFT TO LEARN is...well.  It's Zen.  It's sitting at the feet of the master.Now, I've banged around on drums for about 35 years and I can do some passable percussion in really banal situations--had a great time last fall playing udu at a folk sing-a-long.  I have a small electronic trap set I take my frustrations out on many evenings.  But I don't have the slightest chance of being able to play anything like Peart, ever, no matter how hard I might be able to try.So why do I find this--what amounts to an instructional video--so mesmerizing?  The same thing that makes me watch Adrian Peterson play even when the Vikings are having a terrible season.  Just watching someone at the top of his game, knowing that I belong to the same species as the one that produced this...wonder...is uplifting.  Even if I can never do what these other people do, I can thrill vicariously at the accomplishment.And Peart is so well-read and well-spoken that little bits of philosophy often slip out even as he holds forth on the vagaries of rock drumming.  Among my favorites on this set, he said that if you make a mistake, make it again.  Presumably to make it appear more intentional.To underline my implied point: Even if you're not a drummer, just a fan of drumming, or of rock music, or hell, just excellence...this is a collection worth owning.  And if there's a young person in your life, someone you wish to encourage in any endeavor, she could do a lot worse than to have the humble and hard-working Neil Peart as a role model.I know Peart is uncomfortable being lionized, and I don't want to put him up too high on a pedestal.  That sort of thing is never good for the idol, and not much good for the idolater, either.  But I think it's good for humans to have examples of what we can become, given the proper virtues of patience, hard work, inquisitiveness, creativity, humility, and wisdom.  When we see such virtues personified, as they too seldom seem to be, I don't think it goes far amiss for those of us who notice to call it out.",5,"Inspiring, mind-bending and profound.",1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,2192,"['Peart', 'nothing', 'short', 'genius', 'see', 'iconic', 'MASTER', 'sit', 'talk', 'eloquently', 'perfect', 'paragraph', 'perfect', 'paragraph', 'HOW', 'MUCH', 'HE', 'LEFT', 'TO', 'LEARN', 'well', 'Zen', 'sitting', 'feet', 'master.Now', ""'ve"", 'banged', 'drums', '35', 'years', 'can', 'do', 'passable', 'percussion', 'really', 'banal', 'situations', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'last', 'fall', 'playing', 'udu', 'folk', 'sing-a-long', 'have', 'small', 'electronic', 'trap', 'set', 'take', 'frustrations', 'out', 'many', 'evenings', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'slightest', 'chance', 'being', 'able', 'play', 'anything', 'Peart', 'ever', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'try.So', 'why', 'do', 'find', 'what', 'instructional', 'video', 'so', 'mesmerizing', 'same', 'thing', 'watch', 'Adrian', 'Peterson', 'play', 'even', 'when', 'Vikings', 'are', 'having', 'terrible', 'season', 'Just', 'watching', 'someone', 'top', 'game', 'knowing', 'belong', 'same', 'species', 'one', 'produced', 'wonder', 'uplifting', 'Even', 'can', 'never', 'do', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'do', 'can', 'thrill', 'vicariously', 'accomplishment.And', 'Peart', 'so', 'well-read', 'well-spoken', 'little', 'bits', 'philosophy', 'often', 'out', 'even', 'forth', 'vagaries', 'rock', 'drumming', 'favorites', 'set', 'said', 'make', 'mistake', 'make', 'again', 'Presumably', 'make', 'appear', 'more', 'intentional.To', 'underline', 'implied', 'point', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'drummer', 'just', 'fan', 'drumming', 'rock', 'music', 'hell', 'just', 'excellence', 'collection', 'owning', 'young', 'person', 'life', 'someone', 'wish', 'encourage', 'endeavor', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'have', 'humble', 'hard-working', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'role', 'model.I', 'know', 'Peart', 'uncomfortable', 'being', 'lionized', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'put', 'up', 'too', 'high', 'pedestal', 'sort', 'thing', 'never', 'good', 'idol', 'not', 'much', 'good', 'idolater', 'either', 'think', 'good', 'humans', 'have', 'examples', 'what', 'can', 'become', 'given', 'proper', 'virtues', 'patience', 'hard', 'work', 'inquisitiveness', 'creativity', 'humility', 'wisdom', 'When', 'see', 'such', 'virtues', 'personified', 'too', 'seldom', 'seem', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'far', 'amiss', 'who', 'notice', 'call', 'out']",Neil Peart Taking Center Stage: Lifetime of Live Performances
1452562,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B005BCADAY,Irfan A. Alvi,"[0, 0]","I've been a Rush fan for more than three decades, and am also a recreational musician (mostly guitar and drums, dabbling with the bass), so it made sense for me to check out this DVD.  Many reviews have already been written, so I'll just highlight the things that stood out for me:- Neil is a very articulate guy.  At first, he might come across as pretentious, but no, he just possesses a serious intellect so this is how he normally is.  Once you get used to it, it's quite refreshing!- It was interesting to learn how Neil does what he does, but I have to admit that I was also slightly saddened to see his magic 'demystified'.  Of course, that doesn't mean that now I can even remotely do what Neil does, it's just that there's a certain pleasure in basking in the music without thinking about or knowing about how it's created.- I would have preferred seeing Alex and Geddy here and there, but I guess this DVD is Neil's gig.- I was a little surprised that Neil's physical posture doesn't seem all that relaxed - too me, he looks a bit tense.  Maybe it's a reflection of age, how hard he hits, and having to navigate a rather large drum kit?- OK, this comment will draw criticism, but I have to be honest: I sometimes felt that Neil's timing was a bit 'off', i.e. tending to be slightly on the sluggish side.  I can't explain it, and maybe it's just me, but I've never perceived this when listening to the albums.Not wanting to end on a negative note, let me conclude by saying that I really enjoyed this rather long DVD, in fact enjoying it more and more as I got further into it.  It was like listening to a kind, humble, intelligent, and wise friend, so I was sad when we reached the end and it was time to part company, at least for a while.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates Rush, drumming, and/or the effort involved in achieving artistic expression at a very high level.",5,Edifying,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1903,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Rush', 'fan', 'more', 'three', 'decades', 'am', 'also', 'recreational', 'musician', 'mostly', 'guitar', 'drums', 'dabbling', 'bass', 'made', 'sense', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'Many', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'written', ""'ll"", 'just', 'highlight', 'things', 'stood', 'out', 'Neil', 'very', 'articulate', 'guy', 'first', 'might', 'come', 'pretentious', 'just', 'serious', 'intellect', 'how', 'normally', 'Once', 'get', 'used', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'was', 'interesting', 'learn', 'how', 'Neil', 'what', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'also', 'slightly', 'saddened', 'see', 'magic', ""'demystified"", 'course', ""n't"", 'mean', 'now', 'can', 'even', 'remotely', 'do', 'what', 'Neil', 'just', 'certain', 'pleasure', 'basking', 'music', 'thinking', 'knowing', 'how', 'created.-', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'seeing', 'Alex', 'Geddy', 'here', 'there', 'guess', 'DVD', 'Neil', 'gig.-', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'Neil', 'physical', 'posture', ""n't"", 'seem', 'relaxed', 'too', 'bit', 'tense', 'Maybe', 'reflection', 'age', 'how', 'hard', 'having', 'navigate', 'rather', 'large', 'drum', 'kit', 'OK', 'comment', 'will', 'draw', 'criticism', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'Neil', 'timing', 'was', 'bit', 'i.e', 'tending', 'be', 'slightly', 'sluggish', 'side', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'maybe', 'just', ""'ve"", 'never', 'perceived', 'when', 'listening', 'albums.Not', 'wanting', 'end', 'negative', 'note', 'let', 'conclude', 'saying', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'rather', 'long', 'DVD', 'fact', 'enjoying', 'more', 'more', 'got', 'further', 'was', 'listening', 'kind', 'humble', 'intelligent', 'wise', 'friend', 'was', 'sad', 'when', 'reached', 'end', 'was', 'time', 'part', 'company', 'least', 'while', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'Rush', 'drumming', 'effort', 'involved', 'achieving', 'artistic', 'expression', 'very', 'high', 'level']",Neil Peart Taking Center Stage: Lifetime of Live Performances

Peart is great, for me he is a very wise man, the kind of person I would probably enjoy having a conversation with about lots of things, and I'm sure the subjects would get highly advanced and profound, not just about drums and drumming. Peart has a HUGE mind, the man is wise, almost like a master.There is so much material here, I'd advise you to watch about 1 hour at a time, tops. This is because you will of course rewind and watch some sections again several times. The interviewer presents good questions, and several of those I would probably have asked Peart myself. So kudos for not being an interview with stupid questions, those we see being made by people in the media that know absolutely nothing about Rush or Neil.So, I don't know if Neil lurks around here reading reviews on his own materials, but if you do Mr. Peart, all I can say is THANK YOU very much for making these DVDs available, I've been learning a lot with them, not only about drumming but also on many other aspects of music and life,  and your insights are of the highest value.",5,The guy is a master,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,1146,"[""'m"", 'Peart', 'Rush', 'fan', 'course', 'bought', 'My', 'goodness', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'i', 'did', 'Peart', 'great', 'very', 'wise', 'man', 'kind', 'person', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'having', 'conversation', 'lots', 'things', ""'m"", 'sure', 'subjects', 'would', 'get', 'highly', 'advanced', 'profound', 'not', 'just', 'drums', 'drumming', 'Peart', 'HUGE', 'mind', 'man', 'wise', 'almost', 'master.There', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'here', ""'d"", 'advise', 'watch', '1', 'hour', 'time', 'tops', 'will', 'course', 'rewind', 'watch', 'sections', 'again', 'several', 'times', 'interviewer', 'presents', 'good', 'questions', 'several', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'asked', 'Peart', 'So', 'kudos', 'not', 'being', 'interview', 'stupid', 'questions', 'see', 'being', 'made', 'people', 'media', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Rush', 'Neil.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Neil', 'here', 'reading', 'reviews', 'own', 'materials', 'do', 'Mr.', 'Peart', 'can', 'say', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'very', 'much', 'making', 'DVDs', 'available', ""'ve"", 'been', 'learning', 'lot', 'not', 'only', 'drumming', 'also', 'many', 'other', 'aspects', 'music', 'life', 'insights', 'are', 'highest', 'value']",Neil Peart Taking Center Stage: Lifetime of Live Performances
