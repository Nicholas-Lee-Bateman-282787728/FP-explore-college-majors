Pocsik ""Simon Revelstroke""","[1, 1]","In 1966 Warner Bros. released YOU'RE A BIG BOY NOW,directed by fledgling director Francis Ford Coppola.(In fact this was his UCLA theatrical thesis which helpedhim gain his Master of Fine Arts degree.)Those were the good old days when you could walk into a theaternot knowing anything about what you were about to see.I remember being bowled over by this quirky, delightful""coming of age"" tale, about a young man from a wealthyrestrictive New York family, cautiously attempting tofind his identity in the Big Apple.He falls for a seductive, manipulative, manic-depressivego-godancer (Elizabeth Hartman), but eventually finds truelove with sloe-eyed Karen Black (with whom at film'send he dances through a pretzel factory while the Lovin'Spoonful confirm he indeed is a big boy now).This is a delightful gentle gem, populated by a coreof top actors: Rip Torn (philandering father), GeraldinePaige (clutchsome mom), Julie Harris (repressed landladyattacked by a rambling pet rooster), and Dolph Sweet(who would later reappear as a slimy stage manager in Briande Palma's equally view-worthy PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE).Again, this is a gentle comic odyssey which explores youthfulfoibles, from self-delusion to love and life.

I can certainly understand the criticism of it from everyone else who wasn't around that age at that time or is looking at it from the perspective of a film critic today.

235947,A2ETWB58VSTXQY,6300270041,"Nick Bobraton ""The Land of the Jeff""","[4, 10]","I think this movie is one of Coppola's best, since there is no confusing drama/mystery in it(The Conversation). The plot is that a man has just moved out of his home and is going out with a girl he knew in high school. However, he also falls for a go-go dancer at a club the two go to. The movie is slightly dated, but it makes up for it with charm, espiecially the music. The acting is superb, and it's just a funny movie. I believe Coppola made this for his thesis at UCLA, I'm not quite sure.

I really enjoyed the film when I was a kid, I developed a crush on both Barbara and Amy, and I identified with Bernard.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[2, 2]","""You're a Big Boy Now"" (1966) certainly makes one appreciate Francis Ford Coppola even if you hated ""The Godfathers"" and thought ""Apocalypse Now"" NOT the best movie about Vietnam.  It is an entertaining, at times hilarious comedy that makes one happy even to think of it.  Besides the great performances by Geraldine Page (Oscar nominee), Peter Kastner, Michael Dunn, Karen Black and Rip Torn but most of all for the opportunity to allow Elizabeth Hartman break her type she perfected with an Academy Award nominated performance the year before in ""A Patch of Blue"" as a shy blind girl.  It is true she later played characters that tapped into her nervousness (she jumped from a window at Western Psychiatric in 1978 in Pittsburgh where doctors say she hadn't taken her medication), but in ""You're a Big Boy Now"" she is perfect as sexpot ""Barbara Darling.""  She was in enough good performances for us to always remember her and this film proved her range and versatility.  I am so glad Warner Archive collection has finally put this film out on DVD.  It is in many ways a momentous occasion.
