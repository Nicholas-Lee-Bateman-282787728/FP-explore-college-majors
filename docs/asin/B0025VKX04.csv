After hitting the ratings peak of # 7 in seasons 3 and 4, the show slipped in Season 5 to # 21, and then season 6 finished a disappointing # 29. It was still one of the better sitcoms on TV at the time, but some of the routines were getting a little long in the tooth.Season 6 begins where Season 5 leaves off. Dan has left to fulfill his obligation to the US Army Reserves when the gang gets word that his plane crashed in Alaska and Dan is presumed dead. Season 6, Episode 1 shows that Dan survived and is forced to operate on an Eskimo woman after he accidentally breaks the doctors' hands. By Episode 2 he is on his way back home and arrives in time for his own funeral.In later episodes, Dan runs for State Assembly, Harry dates a porn star, Bull is smitten (again?), Mac is chased by an old girlfriend, Roz is jailed after delivering toys to kids at Christmas that belonged to a Scrooge-like character, and Christine volunteers to take care of a friend's baby with hilarious results.Night Court was one of my favorite shows from the 1980s along with Remington Steele and Cheers (whatever became of NBC?), and the entire series thus far on DVD has been good.
