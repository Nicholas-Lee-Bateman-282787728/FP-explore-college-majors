775775,AZVVDOICEOMA4,B0000CE684,,"[0, 0]","Great story.  The young girl is inspired casting.  And with Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall and others, a wonderful film of tragic loss and recovery among strangers who become friends and then family.  No easy answers, but the tone of the movie is that we heal when we help each other.  Some offbeat characterizations which are real and universal.  You wonder in the beginning how can these wounded people (from wounds in their past, and recent wounds of a train bombing) go on with their lives.  There are many answers.  Highly recommended if you are interested in how people confront tough problems with life and find enough courage and solace to go on to a healed life.  I read the book (a slim novella by William Trevor) and found it terribly depressing as it does not have the resolution that this film has.  A serious story--how can this ever be put on film?  The director Richard Loncraine understood the story and the characters, and filmed a satisfying resolution.  He also directed a modern dress film Richard III starring Ian McKellen --well worth viewing as a film study of the corruption of power.  Both of these films show insight into the human condition with no pat solutions.",5,"Great human interest film, inspired casting and director",1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,1191,"['Great', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'inspired', 'casting', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'others', 'wonderful', 'film', 'tragic', 'loss', 'recovery', 'strangers', 'who', 'become', 'friends', 'then', 'family', 'easy', 'answers', 'tone', 'movie', 'heal', 'when', 'help', 'other', 'offbeat', 'characterizations', 'are', 'real', 'universal', 'wonder', 'beginning', 'how', 'can', 'wounded', 'people', 'wounds', 'past', 'recent', 'wounds', 'train', 'bombing', 'go', 'lives', 'are', 'many', 'answers', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'are', 'interested', 'how', 'people', 'confront', 'tough', 'problems', 'life', 'find', 'enough', 'courage', 'solace', 'go', 'healed', 'life', 'read', 'book', 'slim', 'novella', 'William', 'Trevor', 'found', 'terribly', 'depressing', 'not', 'have', 'resolution', 'film', 'serious', 'story', 'how', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'put', 'film', 'director', 'Richard', 'Loncraine', 'understood', 'story', 'characters', 'filmed', 'satisfying', 'resolution', 'also', 'directed', 'modern', 'dress', 'film', 'Richard', 'III', 'starring', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'film', 'study', 'corruption', 'power', 'films', 'show', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'pat', 'solutions']",My House In Umbria

Downes ""downfall4""","[83, 84]","You can read some of the other reviews to get more of the gist of the plot, but I just want to add that this movie is well worth seeing. This movie should move you. Dame Maggie Smith,portraying an aging romance novelist, is elegant, understated, and honest. She shows in her anguish the depths of her depression as she senses old age coming upon her and her appeal as a woman all but snuffed out.  The girl (I don't have her name on hand, unfortunately) who played the child who had lost both her parents in the bomb blast and was still in the early stages of recovery when her uncle wanted to uproot her from her new home in Umbria, was breathtakingly luminous.  The young actress plays the part with such sincerity. She does not have much of a speaking role, but she becomes by way of the intermingling of the characters, the focal point of the movie. Her interaction with Mrs. Delahonte (sp?)(Maggie Smith) and with Werner, the young German, is deeply moving.As Mrs. Delahonte (sp?) becomes deeply attached to the young girl and it appears that this relationship will be tragically severed, you realize that the notion of family and emotional bonding is never defined by blood ties alone. The relationship between Mrs. Delahonte and the young girl is beautifully portrayed. This movie is timeless in its message:  we all should forgive because we all have something for which we need to be forgiven.",5,We should all learn to forgive,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,1402,"['can', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'get', 'more', 'gist', 'plot', 'just', 'want', 'add', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie', 'should', 'move', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'portraying', 'aging', 'romance', 'novelist', 'elegant', 'understated', 'honest', 'anguish', 'depths', 'depression', 'old', 'age', 'coming', 'appeal', 'woman', 'snuffed', 'out', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'name', 'hand', 'unfortunately', 'who', 'played', 'child', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'parents', 'bomb', 'blast', 'was', 'still', 'early', 'stages', 'recovery', 'when', 'uncle', 'wanted', 'uproot', 'new', 'home', 'Umbria', 'was', 'breathtakingly', 'luminous', 'young', 'actress', 'part', 'such', 'sincerity', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'speaking', 'role', 'way', 'intermingling', 'characters', 'focal', 'point', 'movie', 'interaction', 'Mrs.', 'Delahonte', 'sp', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Werner', 'young', 'German', 'deeply', 'moving.As', 'Mrs.', 'Delahonte', 'sp', 'deeply', 'attached', 'young', 'girl', 'relationship', 'will', 'be', 'tragically', 'severed', 'realize', 'notion', 'family', 'emotional', 'bonding', 'never', 'defined', 'blood', 'ties', 'alone', 'relationship', 'Mrs.', 'Delahonte', 'young', 'girl', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'timeless', 'message', 'should', 'forgive', 'have', 'something', 'need', 'be', 'forgiven']",My House In Umbria

775800,A2BDN1YIEKG2OX,B0000CE684,"D. Mitchell ""dedicated romantic""","[1, 1]","Maggie Smith pulls this whole movie together.  I have loved this movie for years and finally purchased it at Amazon.  Maggie plays an older woman who lives in a beautiful old villa in Umbria, Italy. The story begins as she travels to Milan for her monthly shopping trip.  She sits in a compartment with around 9 other people until a bomb explodes and kills everyone in the compartment except a little American girl, an old Englishman, a young German man, and her.  While the police are investigating the bombing, the partially recovered travelers go to stay with Maggie's character, Mrs. De La Hanti.  The little girl arrives mute, unable to speak because of the trauma of losing her parents in the attack.  The German lost his girlfriend and the use of his right hand and the Englishman is grieving for his daughter who died.  As the film progresses, you see that Giancarlo Gianini is the investigating policeman and Mrs. De La Hanti is an ex-patriot English romance writer who has been abused in her past.  This group of strangers becomes a family of sorts in a matter of weeks and their secrets are uncovered as they begin to understand each other.I love Maggie Smith's character: vulnerable, flamboyant, abused, and yet able to see the beauty in other people.  She has an innocence and imagination that is almost child-like.  She is the author of many romance novels and sees stories in the human interactions she observes, interpreting them with an amazing understanding of human nature.  The photography is simply beautiful and Italy, of course, is magnificent.",5,Maggie Smith rocks,1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,1567,"['Maggie', 'Smith', 'whole', 'movie', 'together', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'years', 'finally', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'Maggie', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'beautiful', 'old', 'villa', 'Umbria', 'Italy', 'story', 'Milan', 'monthly', 'shopping', 'trip', 'compartment', '9', 'other', 'people', 'bomb', 'explodes', 'kills', 'everyone', 'compartment', 'little', 'American', 'girl', 'old', 'Englishman', 'young', 'German', 'man', 'police', 'are', 'investigating', 'bombing', 'partially', 'recovered', 'travelers', 'go', 'stay', 'Maggie', 'character', 'Mrs.', 'De', 'La', 'Hanti', 'little', 'girl', 'arrives', 'mute', 'unable', 'speak', 'trauma', 'losing', 'parents', 'attack', 'German', 'lost', 'girlfriend', 'use', 'right', 'hand', 'Englishman', 'grieving', 'daughter', 'who', 'died', 'film', 'see', 'Giancarlo', 'Gianini', 'investigating', 'policeman', 'Mrs.', 'De', 'La', 'Hanti', 'ex-patriot', 'English', 'romance', 'writer', 'who', 'been', 'abused', 'past', 'group', 'strangers', 'family', 'sorts', 'matter', 'weeks', 'secrets', 'are', 'uncovered', 'begin', 'understand', 'other.I', 'love', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'character', 'vulnerable', 'flamboyant', 'abused', 'yet', 'able', 'see', 'beauty', 'other', 'people', 'innocence', 'imagination', 'almost', 'child-like', 'author', 'many', 'romance', 'novels', 'sees', 'stories', 'human', 'interactions', 'interpreting', 'amazing', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'photography', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'Italy', 'course', 'magnificent']",My House In Umbria

As long as you disregard the problem then you can lose yourself in the sentimental fantasy, which is enhanced by superb acting, directing and cinematography. Maggie Smith, as the lead character Emily Delahunty, won an Emmy for her performance in this television movie.But, all the other Amazon reviewers overlook the problem with this supposedly wonderful story: the Italian police would never give an 8-year old girl to strangers especially a girl who is catatonic from an bomb which killed her parents while they were on a train in Italy.So, the entire story is nonsense. Maggie Smith plays a benevolent British expatriate romance novel writer living in Italy who is making her monthly pilgrimmage to the big city and just happens to sit in a train compartment where a bomb accidentally explodes. She offers the survivors including the bomber, refuge in her gorgeous Italian villa, which of course they all accept.Then, the big conflict develops when the uncle of Aimee, the 8-year old girl, arrives from the United States to take her to his home. He is tense, supercilious, egotistical and generally repugnant plus, repulsed by Maggie who is playing Emily Delahunty, who before before becoming a novelist was a wandering hippy.There are a bunch of subplots about the supporting characters including the young German bomber who forsakes his political cause to protect Aimee.This is a well-crafted film with many enjoyable scenes but I doubt that anyone under 35 years old will watch because most of the main characters are old people reliving their lives and seeking salvation through a young, catatonic girl. Also, the story slowly unfolds like life in Umbria. This is not an action film or trendy romantic comedy. In reality it is a story about old people seeking redemption for mistakes made earlier in life.I think it is popular because many people, especially older women, would like an opportunity to do something noble before they die. Unfortunately, the story is fantasy and this is just another feel-good film which is simply amusement and has little or no relationship to reality.",4,Sentimental Fantasy,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,2182,"['Yes', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'screenplay', 'plot', 'huge', 'problem', 'As', 'long', 'disregard', 'problem', 'then', 'can', 'lose', 'sentimental', 'fantasy', 'enhanced', 'superb', 'acting', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'lead', 'character', 'Emily', 'Delahunty', 'won', 'Emmy', 'performance', 'television', 'movie.But', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'overlook', 'problem', 'supposedly', 'wonderful', 'story', 'Italian', 'police', 'would', 'never', 'give', '8-year', 'old', 'girl', 'strangers', 'especially', 'girl', 'who', 'catatonic', 'bomb', 'killed', 'parents', 'were', 'train', 'Italy.So', 'entire', 'story', 'nonsense', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'benevolent', 'British', 'expatriate', 'romance', 'novel', 'writer', 'living', 'Italy', 'who', 'making', 'monthly', 'pilgrimmage', 'big', 'city', 'just', 'happens', 'sit', 'train', 'compartment', 'where', 'bomb', 'accidentally', 'survivors', 'including', 'bomber', 'refuge', 'gorgeous', 'Italian', 'villa', 'course', 'accept.Then', 'big', 'conflict', 'when', 'uncle', 'Aimee', '8-year', 'old', 'girl', 'United', 'States', 'take', 'home', 'tense', 'supercilious', 'egotistical', 'generally', 'repugnant', 'repulsed', 'Maggie', 'who', 'playing', 'Emily', 'Delahunty', 'who', 'becoming', 'novelist', 'was', 'wandering', 'are', 'bunch', 'subplots', 'supporting', 'characters', 'including', 'young', 'German', 'bomber', 'who', 'political', 'cause', 'protect', 'Aimee.This', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'many', 'enjoyable', 'scenes', 'doubt', 'anyone', '35', 'years', 'old', 'will', 'watch', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'old', 'people', 'reliving', 'lives', 'seeking', 'salvation', 'young', 'catatonic', 'girl', 'Also', 'story', 'slowly', 'unfolds', 'life', 'Umbria', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'trendy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'reality', 'story', 'old', 'people', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'mistakes', 'made', 'earlier', 'life.I', 'think', 'popular', 'many', 'people', 'especially', 'older', 'women', 'would', 'like', 'opportunity', 'do', 'something', 'noble', 'die', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'fantasy', 'just', 'feel-good', 'film', 'simply', 'amusement', 'little', 'relationship', 'reality']",My House In Umbria

With Thomas Riversmith, a university professor who studies the red carpenter ant, Emily is begging for jungle romance. Confiding unabashedly, she holds back nothing from her twirly past. The disgusted Tom shrinks from her almost body to body conversations and regards her love books as trash for the desperate. While she fancies that they might be courting an affair, Tom fears her boldness, looking forward to returning to America with his niece Aimee. Wickedly she smiles: ""A few weeks with the right woman and all his little irritations would soon disappear.""""What Mrs. Emily Delahunty requires is a faucet of passion. Sloshing her grappa around the old world Umbrian mansion she speaks of her memories--an obliterated childhood; of numerous, disappointing men and a vanished youth in the Cafe Rose where she was obliged to entertain sweaty gentlemen.Tom will return to America with Aimee in the morning. Needing to be a mother to the child of sunlight, Emily is in a restless fever. With two glasses and a bottle of grappa, she wakes him, her satin dressing gown flowing open.

Like many European films (it's not...it's HBO), this begins as though it may be a bit dull, then quickly shifts into intrigue, discovery, and self-reflection -- supported nicely by a lot of charm, friendship, and subtle humor.Actually, part of the charm that you may at first deem unbelievable is the quick bond of friendship and trust that develops between victims of a bombing.  It appears to be the kind of thing that might have happened 50 years ago, but not today.  But then, it DOES take place in Italy...and bombings of that nature are no longer so distant to any of us today.  So, it quickly becomes easy to overlook this slight quirk and simply enjoy the thoughts, feelings, disappointments, and quirkiness of the film's characters.  And quirky they are.At the very least, you'll enjoy quietly brilliant performances by Smith, the wonderful Giancarlo Giannini, Oscar-winner Chris Cooper, the relentless Timothy Spall, classic English comic Ronnie Barker (one of his last), and others.Yes, it's ""only"" an HBO film, but they're doing some of the best films AND television around right now.

Bernabo,"[22, 25]","I have put off watching ""My House in Umbria"" because having seen the trailers I assumed it was similar to ""A Room With a View"" or ""My House in Tuscany.""  That was because the trailers emphasized the cast and the location rather than the plot.  So when I finally watched this 2003 film made for HBO I was rather surprised to discover what ""My House in Umbria"" is all about.The film is based on William Trevor's 1991 short novel.  The house in Umbria belongs to Emily Delahunty (Maggie Smith), an aging romance novlist who boards a train for a shopping trip to Milan.  She finds a seat in a crowded compartment where she joins an American family with a young daughter who likes to ask questions, a pair of young German lovers who are busy enjoying each other, and a retired English general and his family.  Then a bomb goes off.Most of the people in the compartment are killed by the blast.  Along with Emily one member from each group surives the explosion and end up in the same hospital with varying degrees of wounds, both physical and psychological.  Eventually Emily takes the other survivors back to her house in Umbria, where she and her faithful servant Quinty (Timothy Spall) continue to minister to their needs.  But what has happened intrudes on this peaceful environment, first when an Italian police inspector (Giancarlo Giannini) shows up as part of the investigation of the bomb and then when Thomas Riversmith (Chris Cooper) arrives to claim his relative.The character of Emily Delahunty is more compelling that the story.  Played with a rather uncharacteristic restraint by Smith, she is a novelist who cannot help but see stories in the people she has taken into her home.  I do not mean this in the sense that she wants to exploit their tragedy by writing a story but rather that her writer's imagination is always filing in the gaps regarding the lives of her visitors.  A word or a look is enough for Emily to imagine the rest, spinning out the narrative in her mind.  Based on these imaginings, whose accuracy is always in question, she reacts accordingly, and the question is whether she is healing herself at the same time she is trying so hard to heal these others.Both Hugh Whitemore's script and director Richard Loncraine's do what they can to showcase Smith's performance.  This dame Dame Maggie is not puling out all the stops but showing the importance of small things, like a quick glanced or a carefully nuances word.  The police inspector and Riversmith both represent challenges to the way Emily sees the world, but out hearts if not out minds are with her efforts.",5,A mesmerizing performance by Dame Maggie Smith,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,2599,"['have', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'House', 'Umbria', 'having', 'seen', 'trailers', 'assumed', 'was', 'similar', 'A', 'Room', 'View', 'House', 'Tuscany', 'was', 'trailers', 'emphasized', 'cast', 'location', 'rather', 'plot', 'when', 'finally', 'watched', '2003', 'film', 'made', 'HBO', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'discover', 'what', 'House', 'Umbria', 'about.The', 'film', 'based', 'William', 'Trevor', '1991', 'short', 'novel', 'house', 'Umbria', 'belongs', 'Emily', 'Delahunty', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'aging', 'romance', 'novlist', 'who', 'train', 'shopping', 'trip', 'Milan', 'seat', 'crowded', 'compartment', 'where', 'American', 'family', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'ask', 'questions', 'pair', 'young', 'German', 'lovers', 'who', 'are', 'busy', 'enjoying', 'other', 'retired', 'English', 'general', 'family', 'Then', 'bomb', 'off.Most', 'people', 'compartment', 'are', 'killed', 'blast', 'Emily', 'one', 'member', 'group', 'explosion', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'hospital', 'varying', 'degrees', 'wounds', 'physical', 'psychological', 'Eventually', 'Emily', 'other', 'survivors', 'back', 'house', 'Umbria', 'where', 'faithful', 'servant', 'Quinty', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'continue', 'minister', 'needs', 'what', 'happened', 'intrudes', 'peaceful', 'environment', 'first', 'when', 'Italian', 'police', 'inspector', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'up', 'part', 'investigation', 'bomb', 'then', 'when', 'Thomas', 'Riversmith', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'claim', 'relative.The', 'character', 'Emily', 'Delahunty', 'more', 'compelling', 'story', 'Played', 'rather', 'uncharacteristic', 'restraint', 'Smith', 'novelist', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'see', 'stories', 'people', 'taken', 'home', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'sense', 'exploit', 'tragedy', 'writing', 'story', 'rather', 'writer', 'imagination', 'always', 'filing', 'gaps', 'regarding', 'lives', 'visitors', 'word', 'look', 'enough', 'Emily', 'imagine', 'rest', 'spinning', 'out', 'narrative', 'mind', 'Based', 'imaginings', 'accuracy', 'always', 'question', 'accordingly', 'question', 'healing', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'heal', 'Hugh', 'Whitemore', 'script', 'director', 'Richard', 'Loncraine', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'showcase', 'Smith', 'performance', 'dame', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'not', 'puling', 'out', 'stops', 'showing', 'importance', 'small', 'things', 'quick', 'glanced', 'carefully', 'word', 'police', 'inspector', 'Riversmith', 'represent', 'challenges', 'way', 'Emily', 'world', 'hearts', 'not', 'minds', 'are', 'efforts']",My House In Umbria

He was talking about Maggie Smith.Bennett's observation seems a tad bittersweet.  Yes, we're lucky to be living in her time because she's fabulous, but also because, unless we happen to catch her live on the West End stage, we aren't likely to see her in much of a leading part, ever.  In fact, the noteworthy films in which this two-time Oscar winner has played the principal role basically consist of this made-for-HBO endeavor and *The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie* (1969).The upshot is that *My House in Umbria* has a tremendous weight to bear--that of a legendary actress's best screen vehicle in thirty-five years.  It seems a little unfair to judge it based on whether it's worthy of such a distinction, and I can't help wondering whether this accounts for some of this rather plotless film's, shall we say, generous critical reviews.Still, the more times I see it--and it speaks volumes when I'm able to watch a movie more than once--the more I appreciate its leisurely, picturesque style, and the more uplifted I feel by its timely and refreshing theme: that of injured survivors being ""set free"" by their enjoyment of nature and each other.And, ultimately, I begin to think of this movie as a vehicle worthy of its star, and as one in the recent string of high-quality HBO films that have been so good I've almost wanted to send the company a fan letter.

Emily Delahonty, as played masterfully by Maggie Smith, is an older Englishwoman who seems to be exceptionally warm hearted, wise and generous. As the story unfolds we learn that she had a terrible childhood and her adult life seems to have been colorful but not entirely happy.  Still she has done well writing romance novels and maintains a glorious home in Umbria. She tries to avoid the unhappy side of life with her novels that have happy endings and generous amounts of grappa.When she and others are wounded in a freak train explosion she invites the survivors to her home to rest and heal.  She is obviously lonely and needs them as much as she gives them.  The chief recipient of this love is a child, played by a beautiful young actress, who wins the hearts of everyone, including the servants.  Each of the survivors has lost a close family member, apparently, and so they reconnect here, since they are prohibited to leave the country, and find a new kind of family.I found the story fascinating and the beautiful way they helped each other, most noticably by building an English country garden for Emily, was quite moving. What did bother me towards the end was the way Emily seemed to pursue the American uncle of the girl, who had come to take her back to the States.  Perhaps the novel made this aspect of Emily's character more plausible but in the film, it is strange and jarring to see her descend from being an altruistic, kind woman into something sad and pathetic.  It is understandable, given her unfortunate background, but there is nothing in the early part of the film that really hints at this weakness and makes her later actions credible.Still, the excellent performances by the whole cast and the gorgeous scenery enhance an interesting story and make this a film worth seeing.",4,Interesting story set in beautiful Umbria,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,2022,"[""'m"", 'tempted', 'rate', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'reading', 'more', 'negative', 'reviews', 'can', 'see', 'points.On', 'plus', 'side', 'interesting', 'story', 'lot', 'cliches', 'most', 'films', 'Emily', 'Delahonty', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'older', 'Englishwoman', 'who', 'be', 'exceptionally', 'warm', 'hearted', 'wise', 'generous', 'story', 'learn', 'had', 'terrible', 'childhood', 'adult', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'colorful', 'not', 'entirely', 'happy', 'Still', 'done', 'well', 'writing', 'romance', 'novels', 'glorious', 'home', 'Umbria', 'avoid', 'unhappy', 'side', 'life', 'novels', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'generous', 'amounts', 'grappa.When', 'others', 'are', 'wounded', 'freak', 'train', 'explosion', 'survivors', 'home', 'rest', 'heal', 'obviously', 'lonely', 'as', 'much', 'chief', 'recipient', 'love', 'child', 'played', 'beautiful', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'hearts', 'everyone', 'including', 'servants', 'survivors', 'lost', 'close', 'family', 'member', 'apparently', 'so', 'reconnect', 'here', 'are', 'prohibited', 'leave', 'country', 'find', 'new', 'kind', 'family.I', 'found', 'story', 'fascinating', 'beautiful', 'way', 'helped', 'other', 'most', 'noticably', 'building', 'English', 'country', 'garden', 'Emily', 'was', 'quite', 'moving', 'What', 'did', 'bother', 'end', 'was', 'way', 'Emily', 'seemed', 'pursue', 'American', 'uncle', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'take', 'back', 'States', 'Perhaps', 'novel', 'made', 'aspect', 'Emily', 'character', 'more', 'plausible', 'film', 'strange', 'jarring', 'see', 'descend', 'being', 'altruistic', 'kind', 'woman', 'something', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'understandable', 'given', 'unfortunate', 'background', 'nothing', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'weakness', 'later', 'actions', 'credible.Still', 'excellent', 'performances', 'whole', 'cast', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'enhance', 'interesting', 'story', 'make', 'film', 'seeing']",My House In Umbria

Maggie gives nobility to aging and is not ashamed to be seen under less than galmorous conditions.That aside, I expected ""My House In Umbria"" to be more light-hearted than it was. Something about the title made me think that, I guess. Anyway, it was darker than I had anticipated, but that's not a complaint.

775854,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0000CE684,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 5]","""My House in Umbria,"" released by HBO Studios in 2003 certainly walks like a chick flick and talks like a chick flick.  It's set in the beautiful Umbrian countryside of Italy, thereby strongly resembling chick flicks set in Tuscany, or Provence, or wherever.  And it stars the magnifico Dame Maggie Smith, who can carry any movie, let alone a chick flick, on her own.Smith plays Mrs. Emily Delahunty, nicely-fixed English romance novelist, passing her life in the peaceful Umbrian countryside, with an overcooked outfit for every day of the week.  However, she takes the train into Milan monthly to shop.  As the picture opens, she's just catching that train, getting acquainted with her compartment mates.  But a bomb shatters the peace, and when the smoke's cleared, each of her compartment mates has lost their nearest and dearest.  An elderly English general, played by noted comedian Ronnie Barker, has lost his only child, a daughter, and his son-in-law.  The young German, Werner, has lost his girlfriend.  And the child, Aimee, has lost her mother and father.  So, after the hospital releases them all on the same day, Mrs. Delahunty scoops them all up and takes them to her villa to recover, in mind and body.  Former heart throb Giancarlo Giannini plays the Italian police detective who comes around now and then investigating the bomb.  Timothy Spall plays Mrs. Delehunty's reliable Man Friday.  And Chris Cooper plays Aimee's uncle, estranged since before her birth from his sister: he's a puritanical academic.  (Do they really make such people?  I've sure never met one).So, aside from the fact that the movie opens with a spurt of bloody violence, how else does it differ from your average chick flick?  To begin with, it's based on a novella by William Trevor, an admired Irish author resident in England.  His work is mysterious, threatening; never soothing.  The telescript is by well-known playwright Hugh Whitemore, distinctly high-brow; doubt that he's ever written anything even slightly chicky.  And let's look at the film itself.  Mrs. Delehunty is the product of an abused childhood, nor was her young adulthood any too healthy.  She drinks quite a bit, as the English sometimes do, morning, noon and night, as it happens.  (Some of what she does might not have been done by a sober woman.) And her (always charming) drunkenness does upset Aimee's supposedly straight-laced uncle. Well, really.  But the movie does come with a happy tear-jerker of an ending.  Still, is it a chick flick?  Not entirely.",3,Not  Entirely  A Chick Flick,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,2527,"['House', 'Umbria', 'released', 'HBO', 'Studios', '2003', 'certainly', 'walks', 'chick', 'flick', 'talks', 'chick', 'flick', 'set', 'beautiful', 'Umbrian', 'countryside', 'Italy', 'thereby', 'strongly', 'resembling', 'chick', 'flicks', 'set', 'Tuscany', 'Provence', 'wherever', 'magnifico', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'who', 'can', 'carry', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'chick', 'flick', 'own.Smith', 'plays', 'Mrs.', 'Emily', 'Delahunty', 'nicely-fixed', 'English', 'romance', 'novelist', 'passing', 'life', 'peaceful', 'Umbrian', 'countryside', 'overcooked', 'outfit', 'day', 'week', 'However', 'train', 'Milan', 'monthly', 'shop', 'picture', 'just', 'catching', 'train', 'getting', 'acquainted', 'compartment', 'mates', 'bomb', 'peace', 'when', 'smoke', 'cleared', 'compartment', 'lost', 'nearest', 'dearest', 'elderly', 'English', 'general', 'played', 'noted', 'comedian', 'Ronnie', 'Barker', 'lost', 'only', 'child', 'daughter', 'son-in-law', 'young', 'German', 'Werner', 'lost', 'girlfriend', 'child', 'Aimee', 'lost', 'mother', 'father', 'So', 'hospital', 'same', 'day', 'Mrs.', 'Delahunty', 'up', 'villa', 'recover', 'mind', 'body', 'Former', 'heart', 'throb', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Italian', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'around', 'now', 'then', 'investigating', 'bomb', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Mrs.', 'Delehunty', 'reliable', 'Man', 'Friday', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Aimee', 'uncle', 'estranged', 'birth', 'sister', 'puritanical', 'academic', 'Do', 'really', 'make', 'such', 'people', ""'ve"", 'sure', 'never', 'met', 'one', '.So', 'aside', 'fact', 'movie', 'spurt', 'bloody', 'violence', 'how', 'else', 'differ', 'average', 'chick', 'flick', 'begin', 'based', 'novella', 'William', 'Trevor', 'admired', 'Irish', 'author', 'resident', 'England', 'work', 'mysterious', 'threatening', 'never', 'soothing', 'telescript', 'well-known', 'playwright', 'Hugh', 'Whitemore', 'distinctly', 'high-brow', 'doubt', 'ever', 'written', 'anything', 'even', 'slightly', 'chicky', 'let', 'look', 'film', 'Mrs.', 'Delehunty', 'product', 'abused', 'childhood', 'was', 'young', 'adulthood', 'too', 'healthy', 'quite', 'bit', 'English', 'sometimes', 'do', 'morning', 'noon', 'night', 'what', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'sober', 'woman', 'always', 'charming', 'drunkenness', 'upset', 'Aimee', 'supposedly', 'straight-laced', 'uncle', 'Well', 'really', 'movie', 'come', 'happy', 'tear-jerker', 'ending', 'Still', 'chick', 'flick', 'Not', 'entirely']",My House In Umbria

I wasn't expecting it to touch me, and I assumed it to be a light comedy like Under The Tuscan Sun Or Tea With Musolini kind of films. It's a simple story of unconditional love and dealing with ones demons and shadows from the past. Maggie Smith did a great job at revealing her character's inner layers and I was very simpathetic towards her, and understood why she was so eccentric and self-absorbing. She's misunderstood by most people except the little girl whom she had connected to in many ways. Ultimately, she uses all her life experiences and pain and the people around her as material for her novels. It's amazing to realize that her character is a real survivor of hardship and struggle. By the time Chris Cooper resent the little girl back to Maggie Smith to live with her in Umbria, the joy and happiness finally eclipsed the past. It was wonderful to see Smith in a wonderful role so opposite from her super-snob role in Gosford Park.

For them the project was obviously a labor of love.Some voiceover commentaries are rather flat and self-indulgent; but this one is, in its own way, as good as the movie itself!The movie includes some of the finest ensemble actors around.  The script is economical, lyrical and tightly-written; the casting is spot-on; and the overall mood and ambience of the film speaks movingly to the human condition.This is the kind of movie that when you're watching it you think of it as ""a-movie-that-can-just-as-easily-be-a-play.""  However, often the  pitfall with those kinds of movies is that the movie becomes too staged, too ""presentational.""  But that's not the case here at all.  Filmed, for the most part, on location in Italy, the movie takes full advantage of its naturalistic setting.The movie indicates no specific historical period; but rather springs as much from ""inside the head"" of the Maggie Smith character as it does from the objective reality of the dialogue.All this requires a clutch performance by Maggie Smith.  But, then again, Maggie Smith is *always* superb.  I think of her as the Lou Gehrig, the Iron Horse of acting wizardry.  Her presence on screen is magical.  There are few actors who guarantee that the movie they're in is worth watching. Maggie Smith is one of them.
