I probably would have turned this movie off if it wasn't for her. Aniston has charisma so even in a crummy movie like this one, she tries to make an awkward situation somewhat ok. Ben Stiller is another story, he always picks the same, stereotypical role. I guess Stiller thinks he is not worth a decent part. Oh well, Along Came Polly will not send me on a second viewing anytime soon.

622699,A3TLY1A7NGVCQM,B00005JMW7,"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP""","[0, 0]","This is billed as romantic comedy and many ways it delivers. I htink this was maybe meant to be a another ""Something about Mary"" but it comes up a little short on that score.Stiller plays Rueben whose honeymoon with Lisa is unexpectedly cut short by Claude the scube instructor hilariously played by Hank Azzaria. Ruebent han meets an old middle school friend - Polly - Played by Jennifer Anniston - the adventurer as different from Ruebens risk-avoiding personality as it is possible to get. Phillip Hoffman was a gross as ususal and was always good for a laugh or a grimace and Reub's friend Sandy.I'm usually pretty happy with Ben Stiller. He can adjust to whatver type of comedic role he is given and usually makes the character come alive. In this fim, playing a slightly neurotic ""play it safe"" kind of guy, I maybe just expected a little more from him. The timing was somehow just a little off and the jokes a little out of kilter with the scene. Stiller realy didn't seem as compfortable in the role as he was in Mary or Duplex. This movie probably would have been funnier with Danny DeVito (Duplex) directing. Devito is credited as a producer but he should have gotten more involved in the dailies and fixed the timing problem.There was also way too much ""bathroom"" humor for a romantic comedy although the scene with Ben Stiller in Pollys bathroom right after the Moroccan restaurant is priceless.Also Alec Baldwin was good for a laugh as Reuben's boss who had this aversion to washing his hands after using the restroom and loved touch Reuben. The scene were predictable but funny in their own way.This was no ""Something about Mary"" but a decent effort and well worth a watch.",4,funny - good performances,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,1687,"['billed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'many', 'ways', 'htink', 'was', 'maybe', 'meant', 'be', 'Something', 'about', 'Mary', 'up', 'little', 'short', 'score.Stiller', 'Rueben', 'honeymoon', 'Lisa', 'unexpectedly', 'cut', 'short', 'Claude', 'scube', 'instructor', 'hilariously', 'played', 'Hank', 'Azzaria', 'Ruebent', 'han', 'old', 'middle', 'school', 'friend', 'Polly', 'Played', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'adventurer', 'different', 'Ruebens', 'risk-avoiding', 'personality', 'possible', 'get', 'Phillip', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'gross', 'ususal', 'was', 'always', 'good', 'laugh', 'grimace', 'Reub', 'friend', 'Sandy.I', ""'m"", 'usually', 'pretty', 'happy', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'can', 'adjust', 'whatver', 'type', 'comedic', 'role', 'given', 'usually', 'character', 'come', 'alive', 'fim', 'playing', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'play', 'safe', 'kind', 'guy', 'maybe', 'just', 'expected', 'little', 'more', 'timing', 'was', 'somehow', 'just', 'little', 'off', 'jokes', 'little', 'kilter', 'scene', 'Stiller', 'realy', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'compfortable', 'role', 'was', 'Mary', 'Duplex', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Duplex', 'directing', 'Devito', 'credited', 'producer', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'involved', 'dailies', 'fixed', 'timing', 'problem.There', 'was', 'also', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'scene', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Pollys', 'bathroom', 'right', 'Moroccan', 'restaurant', 'priceless.Also', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'was', 'good', 'laugh', 'Reuben', 'boss', 'who', 'had', 'aversion', 'washing', 'hands', 'using', 'restroom', 'loved', 'touch', 'Reuben', 'scene', 'were', 'predictable', 'funny', 'own', 'way.This', 'was', 'Something', 'about', 'Mary', 'decent', 'effort', 'well', 'watch']",N/A
622700,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B00005JMW7,Amanda Richards,"[1, 1]","Ben Stiller is a career character actor.  The problem here is that he only has one character in his career, and it doesn't spread very far these days.  Before you can say Feffer, Focker, Stroehmann, Tenenbaum, Zoolander quickly three times, he's off to his usual shtick of funny faces, potty humor, slapstick and embarrassing situations, and it's usually up to his supporting actors to pick up the slack.Fortunately for this formulaic movie, there are some terrific supporting actors.  Jennifer Aniston is great, but doesn't stray very far from her ditsy Rachel Green character; Bryan Brown overflows with testosterone; Debra Messing plays her graceless role with a good will; Philip Seymour Hoffman and Alec Baldwin are annoyingly obnoxious; and Hank Azaria lights up the movie like a full moon.In a nutshell, it's boy marries girl, girl goes overboard for nude scuba diver, boy meets ditsy girl, boy does stupid and embarrassing things, boy does stupid and embarrassing things, boy does stupid and embarrassing things, boy does stupid and embarrassing things, ad infinitum.In case you're in the mood for a romantic comedy as light as a sponge cake on helium, I should warn you that they were a little low on romance when it was being made, but there was lots of helium available.

622701,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B00005JMW7,Andrew Desmond,"[0, 2]","On a rainy day, it's mildly amusing to watch a film such as ""Along Came Polly"".  No need to really engage the mind and it's possible to read the Sunday papers at the same time.The essence of the film is simple.  Reuben (Ben Stiller) marries Lisa (Deborah Messing) but their honey moon in St. Barths ends after one day when Lisa is found having sex with her scuba instructor.  Reuben returns to New York and then chances upon Polly (Jennifer Aniston).  The two are opposites but somehow are drawn together after several mishaps.  Lisa does eventually try to reconcile with Reuben but the attempt fails and Polly remains.  Reuben and Polly move forward together.The film is, at best, a light chick flick.  If you expect nothing more then you will be satisfied.  Simply switch off the brain and go with the flow.One final point.  The setting for part of the film is St. Barths.  I once went to this locale and was convinced that the film must have been shot elsewhere.  I was right!  The credits confirmed the location as Hawaii.

The film begins in a kind of Shakespearean joke about a respectable man looking for awoman built on conventional ideas about life and being cuckolded by a mention who just met his wife on hishoneymoon...a joke of sorts. There the marriage ends...as we find out the male lead has built up(a complex man)all kinds of theories of life..and theorizes through all the parts of his life with much disappointment and doesnt want to or seem to enjoy anything...but the theory gives such people...and the stats and computers...some satisfaction...he meeets up with the jen anniston character who romps through the movie alive and kicking with much gusto! Her character really adds life to the film and she's great...and the director senses this as the moviemoves along..as the camera seems to and scenes focus on her when she's around. There are club scenes and she educates the man on the spontaneity of life..the ideas and conventions..ideas shuttingout life she doesnt want butto enjoy life...live it like a lark...experience it to its fullest...at the end both woman appear on the scene...and he decides to settle on the Aniston character..but she wont have his 'conventions' his idea to freeze her,butthen he changes...he takes her and forgets marriage and they enjoy a romp in hawaii. A fun movie,and if you take it in that vein enjoyable,with subtle messages about a type of male character, and as the movie says 'along came polly' who really steals the film and tells us of experience and spontaneity,fun and joy, over the conventions thatsuburbia have made of modern life,those dull suburbs....fun film!!",4,unique little film..well worth your time,1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,1951,"['see', 'one', 'reviewers', 'web', 'page', 'said', 'film', 'received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'stars', 'havemade', 'better', 'films', 'interesting', 'other', 'actors', 'roles', 'may', 'not', 'remember', 'film', 'all..benstiller', 'star', 'film', 'expressionless', 'glum', 'jen', 'anniston', 'who', 'life', 'film', 'film', 'kind', 'Shakespearean', 'joke', 'respectable', 'man', 'looking', 'awoman', 'built', 'conventional', 'ideas', 'life', 'being', 'cuckolded', 'mention', 'who', 'just', 'met', 'wife', 'hishoneymoon', 'joke', 'sorts', 'marriage', 'find', 'out', 'male', 'lead', 'built', 'up', 'complex', 'man', 'kinds', 'theories', 'life..and', 'theorizes', 'parts', 'life', 'much', 'disappointment', 'doesnt', 'want', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'anything', 'theory', 'such', 'people', 'stats', 'computers', 'satisfaction', 'up', 'jen', 'anniston', 'character', 'who', 'movie', 'alive', 'kicking', 'much', 'gusto', 'character', 'really', 'life', 'film', 'great', 'director', 'moviemoves', 'along..as', 'camera', 'scenes', 'focus', 'when', 'around', 'are', 'club', 'scenes', 'man', 'spontaneity', 'life..the', 'ideas', 'conventions..ideas', 'shuttingout', 'life', 'doesnt', 'want', 'butto', 'enjoy', 'life', 'live', 'lark', 'experience', 'fullest', 'end', 'woman', 'appear', 'scene', 'settle', 'Aniston', 'character..but', 'have', ""'conventions"", 'idea', 'freeze', 'forgets', 'marriage', 'enjoy', 'romp', 'hawaii', 'fun', 'movie', 'take', 'vein', 'enjoyable', 'subtle', 'messages', 'type', 'male', 'character', 'movie', 'came', 'polly', 'who', 'really', 'film', 'experience', 'spontaneity', 'fun', 'joy', 'conventions', 'have', 'made', 'modern', 'life', 'dull', 'suburbs', '.fun', 'film']",N/A
622703,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00005JMW7,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[1, 1]","Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston have become staples of the Romantic Comedy, but for some reason it wasn't until this year that they have been cast into a movie together.  You'd think they'd be great, given their track records of successful box office.  Each one is talented in their own right.  It should be hilarious, it should be touching...it just wasn't.  The reason boils down to (drum roll please):  these two have absolutely no chemistry between them.  Zero.The plot's not bad, if a little predictable about halfway through. Ben's a risk assessor whose wife (played by the lovely Debra Messinger) cheated on him during their Hawiaiian honeymoon with the scuba instructor.  As a guy who does still have a shred of self respect left, he leaves her there and heads back to his real life to start over again, trying to forget the whole sorry mess.  He decides to forget females for a while, using his highly trained job skills to find all sorts of reasons to avoid the dating scene...then along came Polly. Flaky, flighty, laissez faire Polly....and all his carefully constructed reasons go out the door as against his better judgement he falls in love...There were a few, and I do mean a few laugh out loud moments.  Mostly though I sat through the film wondering when Stiller was going to register some emotion aside from a sort of mild bewilderment.  He gave his character very little personality outside of an insecure, Woody-Allen like neurosis about cleanliness and playing it safe.  It was a complete shock to realize that he must have been feeling an attraction for Polly,  because his acting ability certainly hid that fact from the audience until the very end.Jennifer Anniston was...okay.  Her typical role of The Girlfriend done in typical style;  cute, warm, vulnerable, but hardly memorable.  Enough said.Although Along Came Polly could have been great, neither lead lent anything remarkable to their characters either separately or together as a couple.  This is a true waste, especially when you sense that they were capable of so much more.

622711,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005JMW7,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 1]","Over the past decade, Ben Stiller has displayed a propensity for producing blockbuster comedies, and Along Came Polly is a fun and enjoyable comedy. Although not on the hilarity level of There's Something About Mary, Meet The Parents, or Zoolander - Along Came Polly is nonetheless a funny film (and it's certainly better than the horrid Duplex fiasco with Drew Barrymore). Ben Stiller again plays the role of the nice guy, but this time with a neurotic twist. As a result, the audience still likes his character, just perhaps not as much as some of Stiller's previous roles. But with some hilarious comedy sequences and good one-liners, Along Came Polly manages to keep its viewers entertained quite nicely...Ben Stiller plays the role of Reuben Feffer, an insurance man who avoids risk in every aspect of his life. Measuring everything from the probability of falling through a sidewalk grate to the odds of a piano falling on one's head, he calculates every decision he makes. Following his wedding to Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing), Reuben is devastated when (avoiding the risk of scuba diving), he catches his new bride having an affair with a scuba instructor on their honeymoon. Forced to reevaluate his life, Reuben determines that he needs to take on more risk in his life.With the help of his friend Sandy, Reuben gets out into the public arena once again, where he runs into former junior high school classmate Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston). Polly is the exact opposite of Reuben in almost every way, and he decides to pursue her so as to have more fun in his life. Everything goes well until Lisa returns hoping to win Reuben back, and Polly discovers that Reuben ran a risk analysis on their relationship, determining that Polly was a good risk to take. Now Reuben must decide what to do with his life...Jennifer Aniston, in her role as Polly Prince, turns in another great performance as a leading character's girlfriend (Office Space and Bruce Almighty). Playing a character whose attitude, demeanor, and life are the total opposite of Stiller's, the two Hollywood mainstays are able to save an otherwise adequately written screenplay. Some of the more hilarious scenes involve Reuben's has-been actor friend Sandy Lyle (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who continues to live off of his short-lived fame as ""the kid with the bagpipes"" in a 1980's movie similar to The Breakfast Club. In one scene, Sandy also ""sharts"" (a fart that's a little bit more than a fart), forcing Reuben to leave a party prematurely.Overall, Along Came Polly is a fun and entertaining film that's well worth the time spent. Although Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston have both made better films, it does have its high points. Movie-goers will find this to be a good, light-hearted romantic comedy with Jennifer Aniston and Ben Stiller stealing the show. Because of its headline talent and some good one-liners, Along Came Polly makes the cut as a highly recommended, must-see movie...The DVD Report",3,"Not Ben Stiller's best, but still a funny movie...",1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2978,"['past', 'decade', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'displayed', 'propensity', 'producing', 'blockbuster', 'comedies', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'not', 'hilarity', 'level', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Zoolander', 'Came', 'Polly', 'nonetheless', 'funny', 'film', 'certainly', 'better', 'horrid', 'Duplex', 'fiasco', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'again', 'role', 'nice', 'guy', 'time', 'neurotic', 'twist', 'result', 'audience', 'still', 'character', 'just', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Stiller', 'previous', 'roles', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'sequences', 'good', 'one-liners', 'Came', 'Polly', 'keep', 'viewers', 'entertained', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'role', 'Reuben', 'Feffer', 'insurance', 'man', 'who', 'risk', 'aspect', 'life', 'Measuring', 'everything', 'probability', 'falling', 'sidewalk', 'grate', 'odds', 'piano', 'falling', 'one', 'head', 'decision', 'Following', 'wedding', 'Lisa', 'Kramer', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Reuben', 'devastated', 'when', 'avoiding', 'risk', 'scuba', 'diving', 'new', 'bride', 'having', 'affair', 'scuba', 'instructor', 'honeymoon', 'Forced', 'reevaluate', 'life', 'Reuben', 'take', 'more', 'risk', 'life.With', 'help', 'friend', 'Sandy', 'Reuben', 'out', 'public', 'arena', 'once', 'again', 'where', 'former', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'classmate', 'Polly', 'Prince', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Polly', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Reuben', 'almost', 'way', 'pursue', 'so', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'life', 'Everything', 'well', 'Lisa', 'returns', 'hoping', 'win', 'Reuben', 'back', 'Polly', 'Reuben', 'ran', 'risk', 'analysis', 'relationship', 'determining', 'Polly', 'was', 'good', 'risk', 'take', 'Now', 'Reuben', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'role', 'Polly', 'Prince', 'great', 'performance', 'leading', 'character', 'girlfriend', 'Office', 'Space', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Playing', 'character', 'attitude', 'demeanor', 'life', 'are', 'total', 'opposite', 'Stiller', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'mainstays', 'are', 'able', 'save', 'otherwise', 'adequately', 'written', 'screenplay', 'more', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Reuben', 'has-been', 'actor', 'friend', 'Sandy', 'Lyle', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'live', 'off', 'short-lived', 'fame', 'kid', 'bagpipes', '1980', 'movie', 'similar', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'one', 'scene', 'Sandy', 'also', 'sharts', 'fart', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'fart', 'forcing', 'Reuben', 'leave', 'party', 'prematurely.Overall', 'Came', 'Polly', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'well', 'time', 'spent', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'films', 'have', 'high', 'points', 'Movie-goers', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'good', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'stealing', 'show', 'headline', 'talent', 'good', 'one-liners', 'Came', 'Polly', 'cut', 'highly', 'recommended', 'must-see', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Stiller marries some woman, they go to some tropical island for their honeymoon, he catches her having sex with some guy, and he goes back to New York depressed.  Then he meets Polly, and they have absolutely nothing in common.  They go through the usual problems (yawn), then at the end they sort of get together, I guess.If you'll laugh at absolutely anything, I mean, if you still find knock-knock jokes hilarious, then you may find this amusing.  Truthfully, it's a lousy, unfunny script, these people have absolutely no comedic sense, and the pratfalls and slapstick shenanigans all fall pretty much flat.  There's nothing worse than watching a movie where you're sitting there thinking, ""oh, that was supposed to be funny"", and not laughing.  Do you find it hilarious that a fat guy falls down on a freshly waxed floor, even though he obviously didn't slip or anything?  Do you find it amusing when someone speaks in a really, REALLY thick accent so you can barely understand him?  Are you left in stitches when someone asks their looney best friend to do a serious business presentation for them, and they act like a complete loon?  I mean, come on.

I think in the director's effort to make this movie &quot;all things to all people&quot; the end result was damaged.  Ben Stiller fans will still enjoy it.  He has a certain quirky element to his comedy that just makes him an interesting character no matter what role he is playing.Jennifer Aniston performs well in the film, but I wish her character had been a little more revealing; we learn very little about her past - at least any real specific information.  I think her character needed more depth to make the film flow better.Most of Ben Stiller's films involve him being totally &quot;out of control&quot; of the situation he finds himself in.  This is another film that adds to that list.  The movie starts off at a fast pace, but somewhere in the middle it slows down too much, and I found myself wondering if it would ever pick back up.  I think that is why the scene with the two main characters being tossed around below-deck of a sail boat was included; to try and make the film seem like it had a bit of spunk, long after the spunk had disappeared.This film is okay, but when you compare it to some of Stiller's other movies (even the recent Dodgeball) it falls a little short.Ben Stiller fans will probably still get a kick out of a few parts.

Ben Stiller plays Reuben Feffers (another odd name for Stiller), an insurance risk analyst who lives life cautiously and safely, often calculating risks and odds associated with relationships and activities. After deciding he has found the woman of his dreams, he marries a girl and they go on their honeymoon. Within the first day, however, events go awry when his wife cheats on him, having an affair with a French scuba instructor (who happens to be a nudist as well). Disillusioned, Feffers begins life anew trying to find a perfect soul mate.He eventually meets Polly (Jennifer Aniston), who is epitomizes the exact opposite personality as Feffers. She is a free-spirit, doesn't make or keep appointments, lives life spontaneously and in the moment, and doesn't overanalyze anything. Here lies Feffers' dilemma: he wants to live a ""risk-free"" relationship, but Polly, who has gained his interest, jeopardizes this ideal lifestyle.Another problem manifests itself when Feffers' cheating wife (I guess they didn't get a divorce) comes back to him pleading for a second chance. From here Stiller wavers back and forth, and most of the plot includes him going out with each and deciding who is best for him.This could have been less of a movie, but Stiller has an ability to add quirkiness to his characters, humor to moments that may not be otherwise very funny. He personifies the bad-luck individual guy looking for love, and becomes a sympathetic character as a result. His character takes the advice others give him in stride, but ultimately makes his own decisions on love.Plenty of slapstick humor is in the film; some scenes work, others do not. The ""potty"" humor was taken a little too far, and the movie could have done fine without much of it. Aniston and Stiller make an otherwise mediocre dialogue funny.Although this comedy is certainly ""far-fetched"", it works as a fun romantic comedy. This movie deals with the issue of compatibility and what it takes to find ""the one."" However, it is light hearted, and doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes it more effective.3 1/2 stars",3,"Not too bad, a fun romantic comedy",1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,2191,"['Came', 'Polly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'written', 'John', 'Hamburg', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Zoolander', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Reuben', 'Feffers', 'odd', 'name', 'Stiller', 'insurance', 'risk', 'analyst', 'who', 'life', 'cautiously', 'safely', 'often', 'calculating', 'risks', 'odds', 'associated', 'relationships', 'activities', 'deciding', 'found', 'woman', 'dreams', 'girl', 'go', 'honeymoon', 'first', 'day', 'however', 'events', 'go', 'awry', 'when', 'wife', 'cheats', 'having', 'affair', 'French', 'scuba', 'instructor', 'who', 'be', 'nudist', 'well', 'Disillusioned', 'Feffers', 'life', 'anew', 'trying', 'find', 'perfect', 'soul', 'mate.He', 'eventually', 'Polly', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'exact', 'opposite', 'personality', 'Feffers', 'free-spirit', ""n't"", 'make', 'keep', 'appointments', 'life', 'spontaneously', 'moment', ""n't"", 'overanalyze', 'anything', 'Here', 'Feffers', 'dilemma', 'live', 'risk-free', 'relationship', 'Polly', 'who', 'gained', 'interest', 'ideal', 'lifestyle.Another', 'problem', 'when', 'Feffers', 'cheating', 'wife', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'divorce', 'back', 'pleading', 'second', 'chance', 'here', 'Stiller', 'wavers', 'back', 'forth', 'most', 'plot', 'going', 'deciding', 'who', 'best', 'him.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'movie', 'Stiller', 'ability', 'add', 'quirkiness', 'characters', 'humor', 'moments', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'otherwise', 'very', 'funny', 'bad-luck', 'individual', 'guy', 'looking', 'love', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'result', 'character', 'advice', 'others', 'give', 'stride', 'ultimately', 'own', 'decisions', 'love.Plenty', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'film', 'scenes', 'work', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'potty', 'humor', 'was', 'taken', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'fine', 'much', 'Aniston', 'Stiller', 'make', 'otherwise', 'mediocre', 'dialogue', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'far-fetched', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movie', 'issue', 'compatibility', 'what', 'find', 'one', 'However', 'light', 'hearted', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'more', 'effective.3', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

I liked writer / director John Hamburg and Ben Stiller's work on Zoolander and Meet The Parents, so it was a film I was eager to see. After seeing it on DVD, I did enjoy it. It was by no means perfect, but it had more highlights than lowlights. It's kind of Something About Mary. You again have Ben Stiller's character attracted to a sweet girl. You again have him tortured in the name of love. You again have twisted humor and a bizarre cast of supporting characters. The main difference is that it isn't quite as mean spirited as MaryBen Stiller is generally in top form when he plays the everyman who goes through hell, and that's what he plays here. In fact, his character here isn't that much different than his characters in other films (if it ain't broke, don't fix it, I suppose). The main twist is that his character is a risk analyst who obsessively worries about hazards, germs, etc. It makes him a little more neurotic and a bit more fun. And what's funny is that all the statistics he points out about getting hit by a car, germs in bar nuts, and falling through subway grating are probably true and legitimate concerns, but we all tend to ignore them anyway. It's like his being worried about something makes him more prone to be afflicted by it.As for Jennifer Aniston, she's pretty good as Polly. She's cute, appropriately scatter brained, and good at inadvertently putting Reuben in awkward situations. However, she doesn't really do anything noteworthy in the film and I think her role could have been played by a lot of different actresses. The supporting characters are a lot more memorable. Philip Seymour Hoffman seems to be channeling Jack Black in his role as Sandy Lyle physical comedy is a large part of his performance. The fact that he's a washed up child star is a funny touch. And the fact that he's in a Hell's Kitchen Community Theater performance of Jesus Christ Superstar makes him all the more pathetic and amusing. Hank Azaria also has a fun cameo as Claude, the French scuba diving instructor that steals Reuben's wife. The accent, the outfit (or lack thereof), and the strange stories make him an amusing addition to the cast. Debra Messing and Alec Baldwin also have brief but fun roles.One of the funny things about Along Came Polly is the fact that it makes light of awkward moments that we've all been inAs already mentioned, Along Came Polly starts out fun with a lot of unique situations and big laughs. It tends to fizzle towards the end and becomes formulaic, but overall it's a fun movie worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

It also feels like Ben Stiller is playing an alternate version of his character Greg Focker in Meet The Parents, which weakens his character.

There really isn't much after that because the script is very weak on plot, and on original story.Overall a 3 out 5, the reason why i gave it a 7 is because the comedy from the actors i mentioned above, made this movie extremely funny and even though it does have its flaws, the comedy those actors bring make worth while.As far as DVD extras are concerned, they are extremely good.

He then meets Polly, a neat girl that's kind of the opposite of him because she's free and does whatever she wants while he's really uptight.The movie just wasn't funny and was just pointless and weird. It was very simple and predictable and after the movie I was like:""along came who?"" This isn't worth even a rent because it's not funny at all. The only funny moments that I recall are:1. Stiller's crazy white friend screams ""White Chocolate"" while going up for a layup in a basketball game where he throws the ball off the backboard.2.

I was ready for genetic gar-bhage.Being Very Wrong....is sometimes a wonderful thing.I enjoy Ben Stiller's work.  His classic self abrogating neurotic is rendered without the cerebral albatross of the characters written and played by Woody Allen....guys who are  unendearingly clumsy, vaguely misogynistic, and exude (for me) an anti erotic cacophony.Part of Mr. Stiller's appeal in playing the roles he does is a palpable sensitivity/ ingenuousness..as opposed to Mr. Allen's unemotional, non interactive cynicism which I find intensely unattractive.Jennifer Aniston,  in her usual role of adorable ditz with subtle timing who also gives us desultory peeks at something sound and clear at her core,  is, in this, Mr. Stiller's perfectly cast counterpart.It's about energy, something complex which can not be discerned/achieved on dating or social networking sites....something gifted casting directors access, and, I submit, have in this film.But the real reason I checked out this movie, was the presence of the remarkable Phillip Seymour Hoffman, arguably the most range-infinite American actor alive, and always a privilege in everything he chooses to be a part of.To my surprise and delight, the net result has a real lifeforce that is bigger than the sum of its parts...I might even say, a lifeforce thatapproaches that of  the screwball classics of the 30s.It is, at times, hilarious.  And when it comes to something generating waves of gasping giggles, I am a hard sell. This movie accomplished that and does  in retrospect as well.Not to plot spoil, but all I need do now is say the words ""I Sharted"" ---and the giggles begin.So interesting that on a foundation of subtle elegance of sorts, bathroom humor insanity really works and is never vulgar.I even Googled ""Sharting"" and had bonus giggle fits reading first hand accounts posted online, OMG.The giggle waves also begin when I use the DVD player in my head and envision Mr. Hoffman in an hilarious ad hoc shirts and skins pick up game shouting (unimaginably)  RAINDROP!!! each time he hurls the ball with wanton relish and violence and no skill whatsoever at the backboard.A whole new version of March Madness not involving The Blue Devils.

For instance Ben's character isn't honest and lies about things to try and please Polly. Sorta like he lied about things to try and please his father in law to be in Meet the Parents. In There's Something About Mary the dog kept getting hurt and in this it's a ferret that does instead. Plus Stiller humiliates himself on his first date with Polly just like he did with Mary on there for first date. His character is afraid of getting germs just like Bill Murry's character in What About Bob as well.  So not much is original but still the actors do manage to get lots of laughs from the un-original material.Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston don't have that much chemestry but they still are charming in their roles. Everybody says that the supporting characters are what make the movie but I think the whole cast is good.

Philip Seymour Hoffman who's great in everything &quot;except Twister&quot; steals the show in all his scenes as a has been movie star. Bryan Brown (Cocktail, F/X) is a riot too as a dare devil.

It is a film where some stupendously unoriginal ideas clutter the screenplay, while Ben Stiller goes into the Farrelly brothers' armoire once too often in a desperate search for a laugh.As an example, blind sweater wearing ferrets are not funny. Nor are they terribly cute for that matter and wonders what ganja toking screenwriter would think so. (John Hamburg it turns out. He actually penned the much funnier Zoolander as well as classic Meet the Parents. So he may be a victim of Executive Meddling)Strangely out of place is the bathroom humor. It is not funny at all and kills the romantic plot. The most egregious example is when Stiller uses a decorative bath towel, instead of toilet paper, on a first date with Jennifer Aniston. The fact that they have a second date pushes this movie into the realm of science fiction. I have known woman to end a ten-year marriage for less.Some ideas were funny on their own (Philip Seymour Hoffman's child actor character), but not nearly enough are done with them; and we are quickly back to the tedium of Dharma and Greg ,um excuse me, Stiller and Aniston. In reality if it was not for Hoffman, as well as Alec Baldwin's Jewish boss character, and Bryan Brown's Australian eccentric, there would not have been a laugh during the entire film.It is sad when you are wishing the leads would leave the screen so we can get back to the funny stuff; (Though, as an off-topic aside, Anniston does look quite sexy in her PG-13 sex scene.)If you do come across the DVD of this movie, be sure to watch Debra Messing's rap song located in the deleted scenes.

When would think it would a be wonderful coming together romantic comedy.In this movie Stiller plays a cautious, over protective guy given the fact he assesses risk for a living. In the opening Stiller has just married the woman of his dreams, bought the house he is always wanted, and then their honeymoon in St.Barts comes along in which his newly wedded wife runs off with a french nudist who loves scubba diving off his boat. Well, Stiller with the help of his friend- who is famous for some corny teen-flick encourages him to get back into dating. Stiller goes along for the ride running into Polly Prince a former middle school buddy (Aniston). Only Polly has changed she no longer is the same model U.N., debate, mathlete she is now unable to make the simplest of decisions and writes books in which children get mamed. But despite that there is something about Polly that Stiller enjoys maybe because she is the exact opposite and a real risk taker, salsa dancing, ferret loving person she has become.

622752,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMW7,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 15]","It would be easy to say that &quot;Along Came Polly&quot; is yet another movie where pretty much all the good parts are in the trailer, but this film has more serious problems that account for it being one of the more disappointing romantic comedies to come along in a while.  You look at the cast with Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Debra Messing, Alec Baldwin, and Hank Azaria and you have to have expectations of a decent film, but this 2004 comedy really falls short.As you know from the trailer, Stiller's character is a risk-accessor named Reuben Feiffer who has problems with keeping clean in a sweat, germ infested world.  Actually, the character is not as pathological as he appears in the trailer because he also has Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is a legitimate concern and a good reason not to eat spicy North African food.  Aniston is Polly Prince, a free spirit, who went to middle school (or junior high) with Reuben way back when and when they meet again he decides that asking her out on a date would be just the thing to get him out of the dumps.  You see, the movie opens with Reuben getting married to the girl of his dreams (and computer analysis), Lisa (Debra Messing) but the honeymoon hits a major speed bump within 48 hours.This is certainly a good year for ferrets this year, relatively speaking, with the blind ferret in this film and the dead ferrets that Hermoine feeds to the hippogryph in the new Harry Potter movie.  But at least the blind ferret has an excuse for the action of his character, which is something that is missing on Polly's part.  We understand why Reuben likes Polly.  She is cute and likes salsa dancing.  But why Polly like Reuben is never really explained, although a friend thinks that pity is a principle component.  There needs to be more going on besides being the stars of the picture to justify the romance and more than an ability to mentally count to fifty under the right circumstances.  Reuben's big moment in which he surprises Polly is not going to provide retroactive justification for her interest.Writer-director John Hamburg could fix things so that there was some reason for the relationship, but his primary objective in this film is to do things to Ben Stiller (who gets bonus points along with Hank Azaria for their buffed body work).  Meanwhile he has Jennifer Aniston running around and apparently has no significant ideas as to what do with her so that the romantic part of the film's equation is within sight of the comedy part.  The woman can do more than stand there and look cute but apparently nobody making movies in Hollywood has been able to come up with a major league idea for using her talents.  Aniston was pretty good in &quot;The Good Girl,&quot; and has some nice moments in &quot;Rock Star&quot; and &quot;Bruce Almighty,&quot; not to mention &quot;The Iron Giant,&quot; but we are still waiting for somebody to come up with a really great romantic comedy that focuses on her as the lead character.The final sign that &quot;Along Came Polly&quot; has bit time problems is when the most tender moment in the film comes between Reuben and his best friend, the forgetten child actor and bagpipe player, Sandy Lyle (Hoffman).  For that matter, when Reuben's father (Bob Dishy) suddenly breaks his silence to offer sage advice, why on earth does he not give it to his son?  Just like too many parts of this movie, it is close but no cigar.  The idea of a guy afraid to take risks who falls for a girl who is unwilling to commit is a solid enough idea (it has worked before), but it requires the romance to be as important as the comedy, and Hamburg is out of his depth in that half of the equation.",3,A very disappointing romantic comedy given the great cast,1086739200,"06 9, 2004",2004,3710,"['would', 'be', 'easy', 'say', 'quot', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', 'quot', 'yet', 'movie', 'where', 'pretty', 'much', 'good', 'parts', 'are', 'trailer', 'film', 'more', 'serious', 'problems', 'account', 'being', 'one', 'more', 'disappointing', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'come', 'along', 'while', 'look', 'cast', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'have', 'have', 'expectations', 'decent', 'film', '2004', 'comedy', 'really', 'short.As', 'know', 'trailer', 'Stiller', 'character', 'risk-accessor', 'named', 'Reuben', 'Feiffer', 'who', 'problems', 'keeping', 'clean', 'sweat', 'germ', 'infested', 'world', 'Actually', 'character', 'not', 'as', 'pathological', 'trailer', 'also', 'Irritable', 'Bowel', 'Syndrome', 'legitimate', 'concern', 'good', 'reason', 'not', 'eat', 'spicy', 'North', 'African', 'food', 'Aniston', 'Polly', 'Prince', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'went', 'middle', 'school', 'junior', 'high', 'Reuben', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'when', 'meet', 'again', 'asking', 'out', 'date', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'thing', 'get', 'dumps', 'see', 'movie', 'Reuben', 'getting', 'married', 'girl', 'dreams', 'computer', 'analysis', 'Lisa', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'honeymoon', 'major', 'speed', 'bump', '48', 'hours.This', 'certainly', 'good', 'year', 'ferrets', 'year', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'blind', 'ferret', 'film', 'dead', 'ferrets', 'Hermoine', 'feeds', 'hippogryph', 'new', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'least', 'blind', 'ferret', 'excuse', 'action', 'character', 'something', 'missing', 'Polly', 'part', 'understand', 'why', 'Reuben', 'Polly', 'cute', 'salsa', 'dancing', 'why', 'Polly', 'Reuben', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'friend', 'pity', 'principle', 'component', 'be', 'more', 'going', 'being', 'stars', 'picture', 'justify', 'romance', 'more', 'ability', 'mentally', 'count', 'fifty', 'right', 'circumstances', 'Reuben', 'big', 'moment', 'Polly', 'not', 'going', 'provide', 'retroactive', 'justification', 'interest.Writer-director', 'John', 'Hamburg', 'could', 'fix', 'things', 'so', 'was', 'reason', 'relationship', 'primary', 'objective', 'film', 'do', 'things', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'who', 'points', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'buffed', 'body', 'work', 'Meanwhile', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'running', 'around', 'apparently', 'significant', 'ideas', 'what', 'do', 'so', 'romantic', 'part', 'film', 'equation', 'sight', 'comedy', 'part', 'woman', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'stand', 'look', 'cute', 'apparently', 'nobody', 'making', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'able', 'come', 'up', 'major', 'league', 'idea', 'using', 'talents', 'Aniston', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'quot', 'Good', 'Girl', 'quot', 'nice', 'moments', 'quot', 'Rock', 'Star', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'quot', 'not', 'mention', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'quot', 'are', 'still', 'waiting', 'somebody', 'come', 'up', 'really', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'lead', 'character.The', 'final', 'sign', 'quot', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', 'quot', 'bit', 'time', 'problems', 'when', 'most', 'tender', 'moment', 'film', 'Reuben', 'best', 'friend', 'forgetten', 'child', 'actor', 'bagpipe', 'player', 'Sandy', 'Lyle', 'Hoffman', 'matter', 'when', 'Reuben', 'father', 'Bob', 'Dishy', 'suddenly', 'silence', 'offer', 'sage', 'advice', 'why', 'earth', 'not', 'give', 'son', 'Just', 'too', 'many', 'parts', 'movie', 'close', 'cigar', 'idea', 'guy', 'afraid', 'take', 'risks', 'who', 'falls', 'girl', 'who', 'unwilling', 'commit', 'solid', 'enough', 'idea', 'worked', 'romance', 'be', 'as', 'important', 'comedy', 'Hamburg', 'depth', 'half', 'equation']",N/A

It revolves around  insurance risk-assessment analyst, Reuben Feffer (Ben Siller), who marries the woman of his dreams, Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing), only to lose her on their honeymoon, when she betrays him with the very buff Claude (Hank Azaria), the scuba diving instructor with a seriously deranged French accent.Returning home from the honeymoon, alone and forlorn, he runs into an old childhood friend of his, Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), who has gone from being a math geek to being a totally free spirit. They begin dating, even though they appear to be total opposites. Let the games begin! There are a lot of jokes in the film, often scatological, and sight gags. The path of true love certainly does not seem to run smoothly when one is plagued with irritable bowel syndrome and one's girl-friend is fond of hot, spicy food.Ben Siller is funny in a hapless, hang dog sort of way. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as his best friend, Sandy Lyle, also adds to the humor, lowbrow though it be. Hank Azaria is very buff and over the top in the role of the sexy, scuba diving Frenchman, Claude, with the laughable accent. Jennifer Aniston is a terrific in the role of Polly, a total natural, playing it straight and always charming.

I laughed and laughed, and replayed especially funny parts over and over.  This is a non-sappy romantic comedies for gals AND guys.  The story is about Ben Stiller's character, Reuben, who is a risk analyst for an insurance company.  Reuben calculates his life to avoid risk and danger and ensure a careful plan.  He marries the love of his life, Lisa.  On St. Bart's, Lisa dumps him for a scuba instructor named Claude (Hank Azaria).  Wounded, Reuben goes back to New York and runs into a junior high school classmate named Polly (Jennifer Aniston).Hank Azaria as Claude is one of the highest points of the film.  Azaria is a real actor, in that he can play anyone so well as to be unrecognizable.  He is surprisingly sexy, with a surprisingly nice body!!  Stiller is wonderful, and so is Alec Baldwin, who plays his father-figure type boss, Stan.  And Rodolfo the ferret is absolutely adorable!!  Aussie actor Bryan Brown (F/X) is hilarious as a CEO who lives an extreme sports lifestyle but wants to be insured.  And last but not least is the always wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman (Magnolia, Punch-Drunk Love)as Reuben's friend.

The movie is relatively lightweight, but romantic comedies often are.  Perhaps the various talents were not stretched, but not every movie needs to be ground-breaking.Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) is an insurance risk-assessment analyst.  Because Reuben understands the risk of dying from just about everything, he avoids risky activities.  Reuben's life appears to be just about perfect (in his opinion) when he marries sweetheart Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing).  However, when Reuben avoids scuba diving and Lisa goes by herself, Reuben soon discovers Lisa in a compromising position while wearing her flippers.  Reuben is quite shocked.  He returns home, and attempts to forget Lisa.Reuben then encounters middle school acquaintance Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), who is not only unlike Lisa, but is also unlike Reuben.  Polly's life is disorganized.  Polly plans virtually nothing.  Polly does things on the spur of the moment.  Polly completely enchants Reuben.  Reuben slowly realizes that he loves Polly, and will do anything to win her.  Polly fears the commitment that Reuben wants, and tries to tell herself that she wants to keep her unplanned, disorganized life, and that there is no way her and Reuben could ever work.Unfortunately, my description does very little justice to the comedy in this movie.  Some of the comedy is pretty low.  For example, Reuben has gastric distress in Polly's apartment and runs out of toilet paper just as Polly's ferret crawls under the door.  Friend Sandy Lyle (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a former child star and is now a stereotypical obnoxious former child star that still is unable to adapt to being an adult.  I personally did not think Sandy Lyle was funny, but others might.This movie did win a BMI Film Music Award in 2004 and was nominated for eight other awards (including a Razzie Award nomination for Ben Stiller).I would watch this movie again.  I enjoyed the interplay between Reuben, Polly and Lisa and I thought it worked well.  As with most Ben Stiller movies, not every joke worked, but the ones that did work, worked well.

The entire script follows a very basic formula. Wife cheats on husband, husband sulks, meets someone new, wife comes back and husband needs to decide who he is meant for. We've seen it a hundred times before and there is nothing unique in this version. The entire film is bland, predictable, and boring. Ben Stiller has made some bad films before, but this is ridiculous. I am most disappointed in Jennifer Aniston, especially after her star-turning performance in 2002's THE GOOD GIRL. I hope for better things from her because if she makes more films like this, her career will go down the drain.

Jennifer Anniston supports his purpose and does well on her own, also.For me, the standout role was played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  From the equivocal sex and relationship advice he gives to Stiller's character - to his commentary on the basketball court (screaming out ""Let It Rain"", ""Iceman"" and ""Raindrops"" while his gut comes flying out of his shirt, for example), he is hilarious.  Hoffman also gets to speak the most memorable line of the movie when he tells Stiller's character that he just sharted and that it is indeed time to leave the party.I recommend this movie if you're a fan of most Ben Stiller movies.

Unfortunately, these rom-coms all have the same format, and are all beginning to look just slightly tired. But this was still slightly above average, because it had Jennifer Aniston. I'm sorry, but Ben Stiller reminds me a lot of a less funny Jim Carrey, and a less annoying Adam Sandler.To think, when Jen was filming this, she was also filming Friends AND Bruce Almighty at the same time. And then she would go home to Brad Pitt. I'm not jealous, I'm one of very few women who actually doesn't think he's THAT nice looking. I'll get flamed for saying I've seen better!Along Came Polly has everything. Toilet humour, blind ferrets, a homosexual love interest (could I be talking about Alex Baldwin?!), ex-wives who run off with Hank Azaria - I mean, what more could you ask for from a film?Hank Azaria is the best part of this. Plus, the fact that he's very easy on the eye while he's running about wearing little more than a smile most of the time helped! I don't know why this guy insists on doing so much voice work on The Simpsons etc, when he's got a body like that hidden away!There's various rip-offs of other movies, the most prominent ones being the toilet scene featuring Ben, is exactly the same as the one in Dumb & Dumber, only not as funny, and not as loud. Also, there's a scene where Ben's character makes a list about Jen & his ex wife's plus and negative points. Hmmm - Friends anyone?! Ross making a list about Rachel & Julie?! Season 2?!The extras are pretty average. You've got a rather pointless feature, with the 'star' of the movie, the blind ferret. There are also deleted scenes, outtakes, and not much else.

Poor Reuben (Stiller) is happily married to Lisa (played by Debra Messing) for less than twenty-four hours before she cheats on him.  Alone again, Reuben runs into Polly Prince (Aniston), a girl he went to middle school with many years ago.  Reuben is a very straight-arrow, predictable guy, and Polly is the complete opposite of him.  Somehow, though, Reuben finds himself drawn to her, and eventually has to decide which woman poses the greatest risk to his heart: his unfaithful wife or crazy, unpredictable Polly.This movie started out great (every time I think of the flipper sex scene, I start laughing).  However, after the first half hour or so, it really fell apart.  I wasn't crazy about the character of Polly and I had a very hard time finding her relationship with Reuben believable.  These characters have absolutely nothing in common, and they never establish a connection that makes the audience believe that their relationship is worth fighting for.  Also, there is some gross humor in the film that is downright unnecessary: how many bathroom scenes does any one film need?!Overall, ""Along Came Polly"" was disappointing.

At the beginning of the film he has a big wedding and goes off on his honeymoon.  On the first day, he and his wife are invited by a nude instructor to go scuba diving.  Stiller afraid to take any type of risk, tells his wife(who seems mesmorized by the nude gentleman) to go and he will catch up with her later.  When he does he catches her in bed with the instructor.  Thus ends his super brief marriage.Returning from his failed honeymoon, everyone he meets seems to know what happened (curtousy of his big-mouthed mother).  Back on the single scene with his best friend (a full of himself actor who had one successful role in a cult film) he goes to a party and meets Polly (Anniston) who he knew in middle school. He gives her his card and then uses some connections to track down where she lives.The two eventually get together but have a wierd relationship.  Anniston lives life on the edge while Stiller still looks at everything he does based on the percentage of risk.The whole thing gets complicated when Stiller's ex-wife decides she wants to get back with him.The movie seems non-sensicle from start to finish, like most Stiller films.

622766,A14B2NR2XELLQ0,B00005JMW7,Omer Belsky,"[1, 1]","Along Came Polly is a movie that does so many things wrong it should be an utter failure.  Through miracles of acting and pacing and some funny gags, the end result is a romantic comedy that although slight and flawed, is also charming, somewhat witty and very watch able.Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) is an uptight man who lives a perfectly planned life.  A shock after he catches wife cheats on him in his honey moon with his scuba diving instructor (""They still had their flippers on"" he later recounts) leads him to pursue a romance with free spirit Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) who upsets his organized, yappy life.The worst failure of the film is that it is entirely Stiller's movie.  Romantic comedies should have two protagonists, each working on their own problems, with the romance as the solution to both of their problems.  But we never get any insight into Aniston's character.  Is she dissatisfied with her life?  What does she find in Reuben's character?  There are hints of a back-story (a one line reference to Polly's father having another family) suggesting that there might have been a plotline edited out, but as it is, we know nothing.  I believe that short of two short-short scenes, Aniston never appears on screen without Stiller.The interaction between Reuben and Polly is too limited, too.  One moment they are on the verge of breaking up, the next one they (predictably) have sex for the first time.  After that, we never see their relationship change of deepens. They never get closer together.  The status quo remains till the very end.Furthermore, when the inevitable complication rise (the return of Reuben's wife) it feels mandatory and not a natural part of the plot.  It feels as if the scriptwriter put the complications in there, and did not know what to do about it.Then there is a silly sub plot about Leland Van Lew (Bryan Brown), the man whom Reuben has to insure.  Leland lives a dangerous life, and the joke is that he's uninsurable.  So we get many scenes where Leland does crazy, dangerous things, while Reuben watches.  Some of the gags are funny, but the subplot never goes anywhere - it could have ended in five minutes or continued indefinitely.Finally, there are far too many gross jokes, which are only occasionally funny, and suit better a dumb-and-dumber style movie then a cute romantic comedy.Nonetheless, the film has several advantages, which make it watch able despite the flaws.Chief among them is Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing Stiller's best friend, a has-been actor trying to outlive his fame.  His subplot get relatively a lot of attention, and is very amusing (climaxing in a scene when he insists on playing both Jesus and Judas in 'Jesus Christ Superstar').Then there are several funny and cute jokes.  Among them, everyone knows about Reuben's misfortune with his wife, funny scenes when Philip Hoffman replaces Stiller for a day in the office, and some really great gags about Polly Prince's blind ferret.  There are also cute references to Friends - Like Rachel, Aniston's alter ego in the TV show, Polly is a terrible waitress, and like Ross, Aniston's love interest in that TV show, Reuben makes comparative lists of Polly and his ex-wife on his laptop.Finally, the acting all around is solid.  Stiller and Anniston have enough (...) tension and charisma to make good romantic comedy heroes.For all the criticism, I did enjoy 'Along Came Polly', and that's what counts, right?",3,A Surprisingly Charming Mess,1081382400,"04 8, 2004",2004,3449,"['Came', 'Polly', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'should', 'be', 'utter', 'failure', 'miracles', 'acting', 'pacing', 'funny', 'gags', 'end', 'result', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'slight', 'flawed', 'also', 'charming', 'somewhat', 'witty', 'very', 'watch', 'able.Reuben', 'Feffer', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'uptight', 'man', 'who', 'perfectly', 'planned', 'life', 'shock', 'wife', 'cheats', 'honey', 'moon', 'scuba', 'diving', 'instructor', 'still', 'had', 'flippers', 'later', 'pursue', 'romance', 'free', 'spirit', 'Polly', 'Prince', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'organized', 'yappy', 'life.The', 'worst', 'failure', 'film', 'entirely', 'Stiller', 'movie', 'Romantic', 'comedies', 'should', 'have', 'two', 'protagonists', 'working', 'own', 'problems', 'romance', 'solution', 'problems', 'never', 'get', 'insight', 'Aniston', 'character', 'dissatisfied', 'life', 'What', 'find', 'Reuben', 'character', 'are', 'hints', 'back-story', 'one', 'line', 'reference', 'Polly', 'father', 'having', 'family', 'suggesting', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'plotline', 'edited', 'out', 'know', 'nothing', 'believe', 'short', 'two', 'short-short', 'scenes', 'Aniston', 'never', 'screen', 'Stiller.The', 'interaction', 'Reuben', 'Polly', 'too', 'limited', 'too', 'One', 'moment', 'are', 'verge', 'breaking', 'up', 'next', 'one', 'predictably', 'have', 'sex', 'first', 'time', 'never', 'see', 'relationship', 'change', 'deepens', 'never', 'get', 'closer', 'together', 'status', 'quo', 'very', 'end.Furthermore', 'when', 'inevitable', 'complication', 'rise', 'return', 'Reuben', 'wife', 'mandatory', 'not', 'natural', 'part', 'plot', 'scriptwriter', 'put', 'complications', 'there', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'about', 'it.Then', 'silly', 'sub', 'plot', 'Leland', 'Van', 'Lew', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'man', 'whom', 'Reuben', 'insure', 'Leland', 'dangerous', 'life', 'joke', 'uninsurable', 'get', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'Leland', 'crazy', 'dangerous', 'things', 'Reuben', 'watches', 'gags', 'are', 'funny', 'subplot', 'never', 'anywhere', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'five', 'minutes', 'continued', 'indefinitely.Finally', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'gross', 'jokes', 'are', 'only', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'suit', 'better', 'dumb-and-dumber', 'style', 'movie', 'then', 'cute', 'romantic', 'comedy.Nonetheless', 'film', 'several', 'advantages', 'make', 'watch', 'able', 'flaws.Chief', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'playing', 'Stiller', 'best', 'friend', 'has-been', 'actor', 'trying', 'outlive', 'fame', 'subplot', 'get', 'relatively', 'lot', 'attention', 'very', 'amusing', 'climaxing', 'scene', 'when', 'playing', 'Jesus', 'Judas', ""'Jesus"", 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'are', 'several', 'funny', 'cute', 'jokes', 'everyone', 'Reuben', 'misfortune', 'wife', 'funny', 'scenes', 'when', 'Philip', 'Hoffman', 'Stiller', 'day', 'office', 'really', 'great', 'gags', 'Polly', 'Prince', 'blind', 'ferret', 'are', 'also', 'cute', 'references', 'Friends', 'Rachel', 'Aniston', 'alter', 'ego', 'TV', 'show', 'Polly', 'terrible', 'waitress', 'Ross', 'Aniston', 'love', 'interest', 'TV', 'show', 'Reuben', 'comparative', 'lists', 'Polly', 'ex-wife', 'laptop.Finally', 'acting', 'around', 'solid', 'Stiller', 'Anniston', 'have', 'enough', 'tension', 'charisma', 'make', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'heroes.For', 'criticism', 'did', 'enjoy', ""'Along"", 'Came', 'Polly', 'what', 'right']",N/A

Ben Stiller isn't one of them, giving a convincing and enjoyable performance as an insurance risk assessment expert who definitely brings his work home with him, evaluating every tiny decision and weighing every option's risks against its rewards.  He separates from his newlywed wife, played by Debra Messing, after catching her cheating on him with a French scuba instructor, played by Hank Azaria, on their honeymoon.  A while later, he meets an old friend from school, Polly Prince, played by Jennifer Aniston, and the two begin to date despite her more outgoing and ""risky"" lifestyle (i.e. salsa dancing.)  This is one of those films where you can just kick back and watch what comes pretty darn close to everyday people just trying to get through life.  That is a very good kind of film to have around.  Ben Stiller definitely wasn't bad, though my favorite was Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is just an actor who will remain legendary for a long time to come.  RIP, Mr. Hoffman.  Jennifer Aniston was also good, but I think the filmmakers were sometimes trying too hard to make her character as opposite from Ben Stiller as possible...don't force it.

Whereas Adam Sandler was the sort of character that lived on the edge & quite overbearing sometimes, Ben Stiller always played the stereotype victim characters that we would vouch for.  It's commendable that he would do magic to lacklustre scripts.  Despite that Along Came Polly was a predictable movie, Ben Stiller & Jennifer Aniston pulled the movie through. They simply shined.

I will say that the supporting roles do help sustain the movie from being a comple train wreck.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great playing a role of a child actor grown up into a dissolusioned loser and Hank Azaria is absolutely funny in role Claude the French SCUBA instructor and it is worth watching this film just for these roles.But its ""tough nouggies"" for Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston.  Stiller is funny in the bathroom scene and a few others although he performs a Salsa scene that should have been an outake only available in the DVD version. He also makes these ridiculous facial expressions throughout the film that can only make one think that he wasn't trying too hard.  I am not a fan of Jenifer Anniston.  That being said she was bad in this role.  She was great in ""Office Space"" but here she looks worn out and played the role so unsympathetically (maybe she just needs to eat).Though it may sound like I didn't like the movie I will be forgiving and say that on the whole it is a fun watch.

622776,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00005JMW7,Robert J. Schneider,"[2, 5]","Witness ALONG CAME POLLY (1994), a cute comedy surrounded by scatology.It's too bad. This is a movie that could have been very good, if not for the desperate plot manipulations, fart jokes, poo jokes, pee jokes and other things that detracted from my enjoyment of what should have been a pleasant &quot;opposites-attract&quot; screwball comedy. But because of the above annoyances, we're left with a hit-and-miss PG-13 version of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (which I saw just once, several years ago, and really didn't think all that much of it). You know that it's not coincidental that Ben Stiller, the star of that seminal (ouch, maybe I shouldn't have said that) 1998 gross-out comedy, also stars in this film. Why does he always seem to be attracted to projects like this? Probably to maintain his status as Gross-Out Movie King, I guess.Oh well, in ALONG CAME POLLY, Stiller plays yet another disarming, pathetic yuppie with a weird name. Reuben Feffer marries the Jewish woman of his dreams, Linda Kramer (a throwaway Debra Messing), yet she throws herself at the hunky nudist scuba-diving instructor Claude (Hank Azaria, probably up to his one-hundredth foreign accent by now) on *the first night of their honeymoon*! Catching them en flagrante delicto (boy, I've always wanted to use this delicious Latin term in a movie review!), Reuben's carefully-laid plans (okay, I've gotta stop using expressions like these now) suddenly blow up in his face. Dejected and angry, he comes home alone wondering, how the h*ll could this have happened? You see, good ol' Reubie's a risk analyst for an insurance company, and lives his life purely according to careful and extensive analysis of the risks involved. He carries a laptop around with him that contains a specially-designed algorithmic program that assesses the risk of any given venture, including budding relationships!When suddenly, as the title says, along comes Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), a free-spirited girl he used to know in high school, Reuben thinks her sudden appearance is a definite sign that he should go against his better nature and just throw caution to the wind! That leads to a whole bunch of tasteless and not-very-funny scenes like the Mediterranean dinner date that gives Reuben a case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which winds up at Polly's apartment in a very MARY-like scene which involves the ruining of a Prince family heirloom (don't ask).Apparently John Hamburg, who both directed and wrote the screenplay, couldn't think of enough funny &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;-type episodes to fill the film's 90 minutes (and play cleverly on the film's basic &quot;opposites attract&quot; theme), so he has to resort to farts, poo and pee in order to illicit laughs. Too bad, because there was real talent available here: Ben Stiller has shown himself to be a hilarious, character-driven comedian throughout his now-approaching-20-year career (wow!), and Jennifer Aniston is extremely funny and likeable in playing the kind of role at which Ellen DeGeneres made a fortune. Australian actor Bryan Brown avails himself very well in the parallel story of a billionaire, risk-taking magnate whom Feffer's company is debating on whether or not to insure. On the other hand, we have the talented chubby actor Philip Seymour Hoffman as Reuben's strangely off-kilter, womanizing best friend Sandy Lyle. He seems kind of out-of-sorts here, and halfway through, I saw why: his role was obviously intended for Jack Black, and there's no questions that Jack Black would have been a funnier---and more believable---Sandy Lyle. We also get a badly-miscast Alec Baldwin trying (and failing miserably) to co-opt a Yiddish-New York accent as Reub's boss Stan Indursky.

Both leads utter relationship stopping comments like ""we're just not meant for each other"" and cut to the next scene in bed without motivating the transition.  I grant all that.But something is emerging here.  For generations the consensus view both in hollywood and on mainstreet was that either true attraction is impossible between the together man and the wild girl, or the gulf too wide to bridge even if it happens.  The surprise is that in the final half hour of this movie, the implausible shortcuts disppear and the characters' motivations finally come through.  You realize it was plausible all along.  It might be plausible for others.  It might be plausible for you.  At any rate, it will be easier to consider embracing ""the Polly effect"" because someone, somewhere took it seriously enough to spend big bucks and hire an all star cast, and a lot of people went to see this movie.I realize that as I've moved through life, I don't take those ""relationship stopping comments"" as seriously anymore either, sometimes laugh at them, and so does everyone else.  This movie just projects the trend out a little farther.  And if even a few wild girls find they can like a guy other than a dirtbag loser, and even a few insurance analysts or rocket scientists find they really do have better life odds with an unstructured Polly than their usual morally conflicted too-perfect dames, We just might reverse 2000 years of cultural backsliding on relationships.After all, Aphrodite the goddess of love was in ancient times married to Hephaestus, who if he were a modern deity we'd call something like the god of engineers and analysts.

Zwick,"[5, 6]","If Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston cared anything at all for their fans - let alone their own careers - they would move heaven and earth to make sure every single copy of ""Along Came Polly"" were somehow removed from public display.  This pluperfectly awful romantic comedy hits a new low for both these talented performers.Stiller is a risk-averse insurance adjuster named Reuben Feffer, whose wife dumps him for another man on the first day of their honeymoon.  Returning heartbroken to his home in New York City, Reuben runs into a ditzy childhood friend, the alliteratively named Polly Prince (why not just go all the way and call her Polly Princess?), played by a clearly - and understandably - uncomfortable Anniston.  In contrast to Reuben, Polly is a risk-taking free spirit who has yet to settle down and devise a plan for her life.  Reuben and Polly are supposed to be worlds apart in their personalities and lifestyles, but the characters are so poorly drawn that we really can't see a dime's worth of difference between them.  Polly loves spicy Indian food while Reuben spends the evening in the restroom coping with his Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  Reuben loves throw pillows while Polly finds them to be a symbol of an anal retentive, fussbudget personality.  This is the level on which this opposites-attract theme is played out.  I kid you not.Although ""Along Came Polly"" is supposed to be a cute and touching romantic comedy, most of the ""humor"" focuses on disgusting bodily functions.  Director John Hamburg's screenplay is stuffed with jokes that would be considered lame and undignified even if they were delivered in a junior high locker room.  Yet, here we have an allegedly mature adult being paid big bucks to come up with verbal, visual and auditory gags about flatulence, diarrhea, urination, overflowing toilets and hairy-backed men.  How anyone thought this film could have been even remotely funny or romantic is a complete mystery to me.Stiller and Aniston are not the only performers who fall victim to this film.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Debra Messing, Alec Baldwin, and Hank Azaria are also trapped in this mess.This may not be the worst romantic comedy of recent years, but it is certainly right down there vying for the title.  Perhaps if, in the spirit of the enterprise, someone had just taken a dose of Imodium A-D at the first hint of trouble, we might have been spared this bit of cinematic excrescence called ""Along Came Polly.""",1,a new low for its stars,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,2467,"['Ben', 'Stiller', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'cared', 'anything', 'fans', 'let', 'alone', 'own', 'careers', 'would', 'move', 'heaven', 'earth', 'make', 'sure', 'single', 'copy', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', 'were', 'somehow', 'removed', 'public', 'display', 'pluperfectly', 'awful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'new', 'low', 'talented', 'performers.Stiller', 'risk-averse', 'insurance', 'adjuster', 'named', 'Reuben', 'Feffer', 'wife', 'man', 'first', 'day', 'honeymoon', 'Returning', 'heartbroken', 'home', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Reuben', 'ditzy', 'childhood', 'friend', 'alliteratively', 'named', 'Polly', 'Prince', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'go', 'way', 'call', 'Polly', 'Princess', 'played', 'clearly', 'understandably', 'uncomfortable', 'Anniston', 'contrast', 'Reuben', 'Polly', 'risk-taking', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'yet', 'settle', 'down', 'devise', 'plan', 'life', 'Reuben', 'Polly', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'worlds', 'apart', 'personalities', 'lifestyles', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'drawn', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'dime', 'worth', 'difference', 'Polly', 'spicy', 'Indian', 'food', 'Reuben', 'evening', 'restroom', 'coping', 'Irritable', 'Bowel', 'Syndrome', 'Reuben', 'throw', 'pillows', 'Polly', 'be', 'symbol', 'anal', 'retentive', 'fussbudget', 'personality', 'level', 'opposites-attract', 'theme', 'played', 'out', 'kid', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', 'supposed', 'be', 'cute', 'touching', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'most', 'humor', 'focuses', 'disgusting', 'bodily', 'functions', 'Director', 'John', 'Hamburg', 'screenplay', 'stuffed', 'jokes', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'lame', 'undignified', 'even', 'were', 'delivered', 'junior', 'high', 'locker', 'room', 'here', 'have', 'allegedly', 'mature', 'adult', 'being', 'paid', 'big', 'bucks', 'come', 'up', 'verbal', 'visual', 'auditory', 'gags', 'flatulence', 'diarrhea', 'urination', 'overflowing', 'toilets', 'hairy-backed', 'men', 'How', 'anyone', 'thought', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'remotely', 'funny', 'romantic', 'complete', 'mystery', 'me.Stiller', 'Aniston', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'performers', 'who', 'fall', 'victim', 'film', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'are', 'also', 'trapped', 'mess.This', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'worst', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'recent', 'years', 'certainly', 'right', 'there', 'vying', 'title', 'Perhaps', 'spirit', 'enterprise', 'someone', 'had', 'just', 'taken', 'dose', 'Imodium', 'A-D', 'first', 'hint', 'trouble', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'bit', 'cinematic', 'excrescence', 'called', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly']",N/A

622781,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JMW7,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 1]","This is sort of an off-the-shelf romantic comedy in which Stiller and Anniston craft themselves according to other characters they've played.  Anniston is Polly Prince, a free spirited type with no roots.  Stiller is Ruben Feffer, a risk averse whiz in actuarial science targeted for acts of mass embarrassment - including being dumped by his wife (Debra Messing) on his honeymoon.  Emotionally devastated, Ruben connects with Polly, a girl he idolized as a kid.  However, her free ways disgust him (she happily lives a life of disarray, of unset schedules and lost keys).  Rather than the valor you'd get in epic poetry, Ruben proves his love for Polly by sticking with her through 2 months of walking her ferret, eating spicy food, repeated vomiting and ceaselessly irritated bowels.  What Ruben can't quite divorce himself of is the element of risk itself - being his bane and her reason detre.This was an especially thin story, one of those movies that can only rear its head in theaters between new-years and Memorial Day.  It works though mostly because Anniston and Stiller work up their talents (if you don't like Stiller enough to watch him sweat like a pig, or projectile vomit, then this is not your romantic comedy).  ""Polly"" also gets some surprising mileage from supporting stars - Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a former 80's brat-packer actor who doesn't know that his star has passed, Bryan Brown as a hazard magnet Feffer is reviewing for an insurance policy, Alec Baldwin as Feffer's boss, and Hank Azaria as a sun-fried SCUBA instructor who gets things rolling by breaking Feffer's heart.",4,funnier than it has the right to be,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,1604,"['sort', 'off-the-shelf', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Stiller', 'Anniston', 'craft', 'according', 'other', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'played', 'Anniston', 'Polly', 'Prince', 'free', 'spirited', 'type', 'roots', 'Stiller', 'Ruben', 'Feffer', 'risk', 'averse', 'whiz', 'actuarial', 'science', 'targeted', 'acts', 'mass', 'embarrassment', 'including', 'being', 'dumped', 'wife', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'honeymoon', 'Emotionally', 'devastated', 'Ruben', 'Polly', 'girl', 'idolized', 'kid', 'However', 'free', 'ways', 'disgust', 'happily', 'life', 'disarray', 'unset', 'schedules', 'lost', 'keys', 'Rather', 'valor', ""'d"", 'get', 'epic', 'poetry', 'Ruben', 'love', 'Polly', 'sticking', '2', 'months', 'walking', 'ferret', 'eating', 'spicy', 'food', 'repeated', 'vomiting', 'ceaselessly', 'irritated', 'bowels', 'What', 'Ruben', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'divorce', 'element', 'risk', 'being', 'bane', 'reason', 'detre.This', 'was', 'especially', 'thin', 'story', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'only', 'rear', 'head', 'theaters', 'new-years', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'though', 'mostly', 'Anniston', 'Stiller', 'work', 'up', 'talents', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Stiller', 'enough', 'watch', 'sweat', 'pig', 'projectile', 'vomit', 'then', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Polly', 'also', 'surprising', 'mileage', 'supporting', 'stars', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'former', '80', 'brat-packer', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'star', 'passed', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'hazard', 'magnet', 'Feffer', 'reviewing', 'insurance', 'policy', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Feffer', 'boss', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'sun-fried', 'SCUBA', 'instructor', 'who', 'things', 'rolling', 'breaking', 'Feffer', 'heart']",N/A

He finds himself dumped on his honeymoon by his fickle newlywed wife Lisa (Debra Messing) who runs off having an affair with Jacques, a nudist scuba instructor (Hank Azaria). A few days later, Reuben is back in New York at a pretentious gallery opening, wondering why he's bothering to test the waters so soon, when along comes Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), a quirky, worldly, adventurous soul, whose only flaw appears to be a generalised lack of commitment.The formerly germ-obsessed, controlling Reuben is transformed by Polly's free spirit, her predilection for spicy food, and her pet ferret. Her love of salsa music dancing makes him jealous and painfully uncomfortable, but his heart is aflame. Hamburg, who began his directorial career with SAFE MEN, has proven himself a reliable producer of charming realism and a brand of comedy comparable to that of the Farrelly brothers.Editor William Kerr has an extraordinary sense of comic timing, which gives ALONG CAME POLLY's funny factor a boost. Stiller's salsa solo is striking--the actor is actually an amazing dancer.

That's not to say ""Polly"" isn't beyond repair: there are several amusing sight gags involving Aniston's blind ferret and Stiller's indigestion; Aniston and her salsa instructor give Stiller several opportunities to make light of his inadequacies (something he's a master at).

I watched this movie about 10 times and I know anybody will love this movie (except for dumb critics).  This movie is really good and I would tell anyone to see this movie.  I love this movie as much as Starsky and Hutch and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is so funny in this movie and he always is in drama movies.  The jokes are great, the movie is great, the cast is great, etc.  Ben Stiller does it again and does it great.  This is just a feel-good movie that makes you laugh.  I guarntee you'll love this movie and laugh so hard during the movie.  Listen to me: DO NOT listen to the dumb critics who say this is a bad movie, I know the critcs who say it was bad had a good time, they don't want to say that a movie with Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston is good (critics are weird).  When I lended my copy of the DVD, I was going mad without it because I wanted to watch it again.  Everyone I know loved the movie and I know you will too.

622800,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMW7,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","Curiously, in 'Along Came Polly' the most unfunny characters are the stars Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston.  They are likable, and even charming in their own ways, but the good supports -- Bryan Brown, Alec Baldwin, Philip Seymore Hoffman, and Hank Azaria -- are doing much better jobs here.Still 'Along Came Polly' is no doubt a Ben Stiller film; a hapless guy in a ridiculous situation makes it more ridiculous by misjudge and ill-luck.  Ben is a risk assessment analyst, who has married a perfect wife Debra Messing.  Of course, things cannot be perfect, for he finds that she is not actually what she looks while on honeymoon.Back in town, Ben meets Polly (Jennifer Aniston) who was one of his junior high school friends.  Unlike Ben Stiller's character, she likes taking risks, unpredictable things, and ethnic dishes (that, as you know, will give several chances for Ben to show some gross-out gags).  Can these opposites be in love with each other in spite of their utter differences?The answer is no surprise (that's OK), but the process to it is no better than that, lacking the chemistry between them.  The problem is that for all the charms coming from Aniston, the romance does not look like real at all.  The gags sit uncomfortably beside the romantic story, and the sub-plot about the risk assessment about Bryan Brown's character (who looks like the head of Virgin Records) does not work.I can tell you there are some very funny moments in it -- many thanks to a lovely ferret -- but when an animal steals the show, it is usually a bad sign for humans, at least for Ben and Jennifer.  Still Hoffman's ex-child actor, Azaria's 'French' scuba diving instructer, and Baldwin's boss (and his delightful rudeness) is worth watching.",3,"Just OK Comedy: Likable, But Ben Did Better Than This",1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,1743,"['Curiously', ""'Along"", 'Came', 'Polly', 'most', 'unfunny', 'characters', 'are', 'stars', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'are', 'likable', 'even', 'charming', 'own', 'ways', 'good', 'supports', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Philip', 'Seymore', 'Hoffman', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'are', 'doing', 'much', 'better', 'jobs', 'here.Still', 'Came', 'Polly', 'doubt', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'film', 'hapless', 'guy', 'ridiculous', 'situation', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'misjudge', 'ill-luck', 'Ben', 'risk', 'assessment', 'analyst', 'who', 'married', 'perfect', 'wife', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'course', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'not', 'actually', 'what', 'honeymoon.Back', 'town', 'Ben', 'Polly', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'character', 'taking', 'risks', 'unpredictable', 'things', 'ethnic', 'dishes', 'that', 'know', 'will', 'give', 'several', 'chances', 'Ben', 'show', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'Can', 'opposites', 'be', 'love', 'other', 'spite', 'utter', 'differences', 'answer', 'surprise', 'OK', 'process', 'better', 'lacking', 'chemistry', 'problem', 'charms', 'coming', 'Aniston', 'romance', 'not', 'look', 'real', 'gags', 'sit', 'uncomfortably', 'romantic', 'story', 'sub-plot', 'risk', 'assessment', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'character', 'who', 'head', 'Virgin', 'Records', 'not', 'work.I', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'many', 'thanks', 'lovely', 'ferret', 'when', 'animal', 'show', 'usually', 'bad', 'sign', 'humans', 'least', 'Ben', 'Jennifer', 'Still', 'Hoffman', 'ex-child', 'actor', 'Azaria', ""'French"", 'scuba', 'diving', 'instructer', 'Baldwin', 'boss', 'delightful', 'rudeness', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
