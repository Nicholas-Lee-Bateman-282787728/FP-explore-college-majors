1336716,A1IHL9Y64VO1ES,B003CP1TAK,Future Watch Writer,"[42, 47]","This is probably one of  the most important documentaries of the last 20 years.  It has just been shown on public TV in America.  After World War II some people had the illusion that the German mass murder of the Jews was some sort of isolated event.  Some people even said ""never again"".  In reality the majority of the world's victims of political mass murder were slaughtered after, not before, the defeat of Nazi Germany.  The biggest center of mass murder after World War II was Mao's China.  Mao even publicly endorsed political mass murder (unlike Hitler or Stalin).  Mao even praised the idea of a nuclear war that would kill most people on the planet as a good idea since it would lead (in his warped mind) to a victory for China.  The grim record of the post World War II world spread death from Rwanda to Cambodia to Serbia in the heart of modern Europe.Official attitudes to political mass murder today are hardly encouraging.  The government of China has never been subjected to a judicial proceedings like the Nuremberg trials.  Quite the contrary, Mao's successors are now key allies of American big business in the so-called ""New World Order"".  There is a grim lesson here.  Mass murder on a vast scale can be considered acceptable if money is to be made by powerful global forces.In the Japanese war crimes trials, the greatest Japanese war criminals, the operators of Japan's biological warfare campaign in China, were able to escape justice completely because America wanted their expertise.  Saddam Hussein was assisted in the use of nerve gas against Iranian troops by America.The truly frightening aspect of all this carnage is the fact that the incentives for genocide in the coming 50 years will far higher than ever before.  The destruction and destabilization of the planet's environment is going to create a bitter competition for limited resources.  Hopefully, reform will prevent this but this is not likely since time is running out.What you see here is a warning about what's to come, not a series of unfortunate events from the past.If you want to read some more books on this subject, I would recommendDeath by GovernmentandBlood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur.",4,A very important documentary,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,2241,"['probably', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'documentaries', 'last', '20', 'years', 'just', 'been', 'shown', 'public', 'TV', 'America', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'people', 'had', 'illusion', 'German', 'mass', 'murder', 'Jews', 'was', 'sort', 'isolated', 'event', 'people', 'even', 'said', 'never', 'again', 'reality', 'majority', 'world', 'victims', 'political', 'mass', 'murder', 'were', 'slaughtered', 'not', 'defeat', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'biggest', 'center', 'mass', 'murder', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'Mao', 'China', 'Mao', 'even', 'publicly', 'endorsed', 'political', 'mass', 'murder', 'Hitler', 'Stalin', 'Mao', 'even', 'praised', 'idea', 'nuclear', 'war', 'would', 'kill', 'most', 'people', 'planet', 'good', 'idea', 'would', 'lead', 'warped', 'mind', 'victory', 'China', 'grim', 'record', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'world', 'spread', 'death', 'Rwanda', 'Cambodia', 'Serbia', 'heart', 'modern', 'Europe.Official', 'attitudes', 'political', 'mass', 'murder', 'today', 'are', 'hardly', 'encouraging', 'government', 'China', 'never', 'been', 'subjected', 'judicial', 'proceedings', 'Nuremberg', 'trials', 'contrary', 'Mao', 'successors', 'are', 'now', 'key', 'allies', 'American', 'big', 'business', 'so-called', 'New', 'World', 'Order', 'grim', 'lesson', 'here', 'Mass', 'murder', 'vast', 'scale', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'acceptable', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'powerful', 'global', 'forces.In', 'Japanese', 'war', 'crimes', 'trials', 'greatest', 'Japanese', 'war', 'criminals', 'operators', 'Japan', 'biological', 'warfare', 'campaign', 'China', 'were', 'able', 'escape', 'justice', 'completely', 'America', 'wanted', 'expertise', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'was', 'assisted', 'use', 'nerve', 'gas', 'Iranian', 'troops', 'America.The', 'truly', 'frightening', 'aspect', 'carnage', 'fact', 'incentives', 'genocide', 'coming', '50', 'years', 'will', 'far', 'higher', 'ever', 'destruction', 'destabilization', 'planet', 'environment', 'going', 'create', 'bitter', 'competition', 'limited', 'resources', 'Hopefully', 'reform', 'will', 'prevent', 'not', 'likely', 'time', 'running', 'out.What', 'see', 'here', 'warning', 'what', 'come', 'not', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'past.If', 'want', 'read', 'more', 'books', 'subject', 'would', 'recommendDeath', 'GovernmentandBlood', 'Soil', 'World', 'History', 'Genocide', 'Extermination', 'Sparta', 'Darfur']",Worse Than War

To understand his ability to write with such detachment is the essence of this documentary. Far more personal for him to travel to these places of genocide than to be in a research environment. Perhaps a more difficult concept for him to present to viewers . . . his ability as a lecturer is superior to that as a narrator. Meet his father and mentor, a survivor of 'The Holocaust.'The information and footage is well presented and must evoke the tragedy, the absolute horror of genocide . . . victim and perpetrator. It is beyond the concept of 'mans inhumanity to man.' This addresses all the issues involved that lead to genocide and the inability of the UN to act in a responsible and timely manner. It is reasonably comprehensive and offers possible solutions.This documentary may seem tedious to some viewer's but it is worth the time to try and understand the realities in life.
