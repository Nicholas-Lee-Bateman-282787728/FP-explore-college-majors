816913,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B0001Y4LDW,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[2, 3]","Learning that a movie of Harvey Milk, starring Sean Penn, is set to release November 2008, I decided to revisit this film and add it to my collection. I vaguely remember seeing THE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK documentary about five years ago when I was working on my senior thesis project on the history of the gay rights movement.Seeing it again, I'm reminded of how much Milk did to change the landscape--or at least start the ball rolling here in California--about people's attitudes and beliefs about gay men and women. Elected to one of the seats on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, Milk became the second or third openly gay person elected to a political position in America, and the first in California. He was instrumental in helping to defeat the 1978 Proposition 6 ""Briggs Initiative"" that would have made it mandatory to fire any gay teachers and anyone working in the public school system who supported gay rights.The documentary premiered in 1984 and ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Told mostly through news footage and interviews with people who knew and worked with Harvey Milk, THE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK paints a tender portrait of a man who was not just on the side of homosexuals, because he was gay himself, but on the side of people. Anyway, the documentary is very well presented and I see why it won the Oscar.Digitally restored, inspirational and moving, THE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK DVD should be part of every LGBT person's library, actually everyone's library, and is a great primer for those who want a brush up before the movie ""Milk"" opens in theaters. Sadly, many of the prejudices that Milk was fighting against in 1977 we're still fighting against today in 2008.There are two DVDs that come in this collector's edition set.

816914,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0001Y4LDW,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Originally reviewed in 2009 on the 25th Anniversary of ""The Times Of Harvey Milk"" documentary.In the recent hoopla over the commercial film ""Milk"", about the political rise and assassination (along with the Mayor,  George Moscone) of the first acknowledged openly gay politician, San Francisco Supervisor Harvey  Milk and the Oscar-worthy performance by actor Sean Penn this little film documentary has been overshadowed. This is unfortunate on two counts. First, this film won, on its own merits, an Oscar, as well, for the Best Documentary of 1984. Secondly, for those with a political perspective, especially those with a leftist perspective, this documentary is a more satisfying and instructive film about the limitations of electoral politics as a vehicle for the advancement of any oppressed sector of society.This documentary is driven by footage of the events that led up to Harvey Milk's political victory, his term of office, short as it was, the events surrounding the trial of his murderer, fellow Supervisor Dan WhiteAnd the outrage, justifiably so, of the gay community and others, over the jury verdict in the case (manslaughter). As is the nature of such efforts there are the inevitable ""talking heads""  who give their take on Milk, the meaning of his political life, some personal observations and comments by those who were influenced by, or worked politically with, Milk.Two of the commentators stick out. One, a lesbian professor from San Francisco State (I think) gives an overview of what the Milk campaign meant for the gay community and the struggle for political power in one city. The other, an old time local labor leader (important in a big labor town, at least at that time), who, seemingly kicking and screaming, came to admire Harvey Milk. One should pay careful attention to his comments even a quarter of a century later as, despite some real gains made by the gay and lesbian rights movement,  there is nevertheless still a ""culture gap"" that he expressed very well about his attitude toward gays before working with Milk and that is not uncommon, if politically  incorrect, in many neighborhoods today.Twenty five years after the release of this film how does the legacy of Harvey Milk's work stand up? I don't mean the limitations of the parliamentary (and legal) road to social reform. I have also dealt with the question in other contexts around the women's liberation struggle, the black liberation struggle and other questions of strategic importance to the struggle for a more just society. Rather I want to finish here with a little comment about Harvey Milk, the gay man. From this documentary it is clear that he was very political, very committed to the struggle for gays rights, not afraid, as in the case of Proposition 6 (the 1978 effects by some right-wingers to exclude homosexuals from the public teaching profession), to tackle the yahoos and had a certain charisma. In short, all the attributes of any politico (at least a potentially successful one). But that is neither here nor there. What I think Milk's short political life  ultimately means was caught in the speech included in the film that he made after that Proposition 6 defeat where he called on all gays and lesbians to ""come out of the closet'' ( a seemingly quaint term now but very advanced then) and fight the yahoos wherever they are and wherever you are. That, my friends, despite my differences of political strategy with the late Harvey Milk is very good advise indeed.",5,"The Other ""Milk"" Film",1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,3494,"['Originally', 'reviewed', '2009', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Times', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'recent', 'hoopla', 'commercial', 'film', 'Milk', 'political', 'rise', 'assassination', 'Mayor', 'George', 'Moscone', 'first', 'acknowledged', 'openly', 'gay', 'politician', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Supervisor', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'little', 'film', 'documentary', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'unfortunate', 'two', 'counts', 'First', 'film', 'won', 'own', 'merits', 'Oscar', 'as', 'well', 'Best', 'Documentary', '1984', 'Secondly', 'political', 'perspective', 'especially', 'leftist', 'perspective', 'documentary', 'more', 'satisfying', 'instructive', 'film', 'limitations', 'electoral', 'politics', 'vehicle', 'advancement', 'oppressed', 'sector', 'society.This', 'documentary', 'driven', 'footage', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'political', 'victory', 'term', 'office', 'short', 'was', 'events', 'surrounding', 'trial', 'murderer', 'fellow', 'Supervisor', 'Dan', 'WhiteAnd', 'outrage', 'justifiably', 'so', 'gay', 'community', 'others', 'jury', 'verdict', 'case', 'manslaughter', 'nature', 'such', 'efforts', 'are', 'inevitable', 'talking', 'heads', 'who', 'give', 'take', 'Milk', 'meaning', 'political', 'life', 'personal', 'observations', 'comments', 'who', 'were', 'influenced', 'worked', 'politically', 'Milk.Two', 'commentators', 'stick', 'out', 'One', 'lesbian', 'professor', 'San', 'Francisco', 'State', 'think', 'overview', 'what', 'Milk', 'campaign', 'meant', 'gay', 'community', 'struggle', 'political', 'power', 'one', 'city', 'other', 'old', 'time', 'local', 'labor', 'leader', 'important', 'big', 'labor', 'town', 'least', 'time', 'who', 'seemingly', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'came', 'admire', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'One', 'should', 'pay', 'careful', 'attention', 'comments', 'even', 'quarter', 'century', 'later', 'real', 'gains', 'made', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'rights', 'movement', 'nevertheless', 'still', 'culture', 'gap', 'expressed', 'very', 'well', 'attitude', 'gays', 'working', 'Milk', 'not', 'uncommon', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'many', 'neighborhoods', 'today.Twenty', 'five', 'years', 'release', 'film', 'how', 'legacy', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'work', 'stand', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'limitations', 'parliamentary', 'legal', 'road', 'social', 'reform', 'have', 'also', 'dealt', 'question', 'other', 'contexts', 'women', 'liberation', 'struggle', 'black', 'liberation', 'struggle', 'other', 'questions', 'strategic', 'importance', 'struggle', 'more', 'just', 'society', 'want', 'finish', 'here', 'little', 'comment', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'gay', 'man', 'documentary', 'clear', 'was', 'very', 'political', 'very', 'committed', 'struggle', 'gays', 'rights', 'not', 'afraid', 'case', 'Proposition', '6', '1978', 'effects', 'right-wingers', 'exclude', 'homosexuals', 'public', 'teaching', 'profession', 'tackle', 'yahoos', 'had', 'certain', 'charisma', 'short', 'attributes', 'politico', 'least', 'potentially', 'successful', 'one', 'neither', 'here', 'there', 'What', 'think', 'Milk', 'short', 'political', 'life', 'ultimately', 'was', 'caught', 'speech', 'included', 'film', 'made', 'Proposition', '6', 'defeat', 'where', 'called', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'come', 'closet', 'seemingly', 'quaint', 'term', 'now', 'very', 'advanced', 'then', 'fight', 'yahoos', 'are', 'are', 'friends', 'differences', 'political', 'strategy', 'late', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'very', 'good', 'advise', 'indeed']",N/A

816916,A1JMR6MVOIC38K,B0001Y4LDW,Charles - Music Lover,"[8, 8]","Robert Epstein and Richard Schmiechen have crafted an eloquent and touching documentary that brings to life a historically important political figure in our nation's history: Harvey Milk, the first openly gay public elected official in San Francisco. Milk, together with San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, were assassinated in November 1978.The film does not concentrate on a biographical portrait of Milk, but instead focuses on the eleven months he served as San Francisco supervisor.  It brings life to history, albeit recent history, a quality that is lacking in so many historical documentaries.  What makes this possible, in many ways, is the ample news footage that was available to trace the events that comprised those eleven months, and the personal commentary provided by witnesses and participants of the events documented.  The additional footage and audio commentary that comprises this 2-DVD set sheds more light on the Harvey Milk legacy.  Milk was a politician by nature, much in the same way as John Kennedy was, but without the money.  It shows how much a charasmatic figure can accomplish when the mission seems clear.  Milk's humor, candor, and intelligence shines through.I first saw this film in the late 1980s on public television, and saw it a few times since.  Watching it today, what shocked me the most is that Dan White, who served a little more than five years for the slayings, received no psychiatric treatment while incarcerated.  White's defense attorney stated quite clearly in news footage that White was a suicide risk the day the verdict was announced.  White killed himself less than two years after his release.  I am clearly no apologist for Dan White, but he was failed by the very system that awarded him his freedom a scant five years after killing two men.Milk was elected to public office in the few years after the notion of the ""personal is political"" became popular.  Milk exemplified and capitalized on this notion brilliantly.  What Milk's legacy shows me, today, is that personal authenticity is the most essential quality needed in our public officials.  Integrity and intelligence springs from authenticity, as does clarity of purpose.  And a sense of wit and humor is the second most essential quality.  Milk possessed both.P.S.: I thought of this after I originally posted my review.  Milk was assassinated a few short years before the AIDS epidemic emerged as a public health threat within, and outside of, the gay community.  Had Milk been on the scene at the time, I have no doubt he would have used his office and political power to the greatest extent possible to affect legislation and government accountibility in their response to the epidemic.  His death really altered the course of history.",5,Essential historical documentary,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,2758,"['Robert', 'Epstein', 'Richard', 'Schmiechen', 'have', 'crafted', 'eloquent', 'touching', 'documentary', 'life', 'historically', 'important', 'political', 'figure', 'nation', 'history', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'public', 'elected', 'official', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Milk', 'together', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Mayor', 'George', 'Moscone', 'were', 'assassinated', 'November', '1978.The', 'film', 'not', 'concentrate', 'biographical', 'portrait', 'Milk', 'instead', 'focuses', 'eleven', 'months', 'served', 'San', 'Francisco', 'supervisor', 'life', 'history', 'recent', 'history', 'quality', 'lacking', 'so', 'many', 'historical', 'documentaries', 'What', 'possible', 'many', 'ways', 'ample', 'news', 'footage', 'was', 'available', 'trace', 'events', 'comprised', 'eleven', 'months', 'personal', 'commentary', 'provided', 'witnesses', 'participants', 'events', 'documented', 'additional', 'footage', 'audio', 'commentary', '2-DVD', 'set', 'sheds', 'more', 'light', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'legacy', 'Milk', 'was', 'politician', 'nature', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'money', 'how', 'much', 'charasmatic', 'figure', 'can', 'accomplish', 'when', 'mission', 'clear', 'Milk', 'humor', 'candor', 'intelligence', 'shines', 'through.I', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'late', '1980s', 'public', 'television', 'saw', 'few', 'times', 'Watching', 'today', 'what', 'shocked', 'most', 'Dan', 'White', 'who', 'served', 'little', 'more', 'five', 'years', 'slayings', 'received', 'psychiatric', 'treatment', 'incarcerated', 'White', 'defense', 'attorney', 'stated', 'quite', 'clearly', 'news', 'footage', 'White', 'was', 'suicide', 'risk', 'day', 'verdict', 'was', 'announced', 'White', 'killed', 'less', 'two', 'years', 'release', 'am', 'clearly', 'apologist', 'Dan', 'White', 'was', 'failed', 'very', 'system', 'awarded', 'freedom', 'scant', 'five', 'years', 'killing', 'two', 'men.Milk', 'was', 'elected', 'public', 'office', 'few', 'years', 'notion', 'personal', 'political', 'became', 'popular', 'Milk', 'exemplified', 'capitalized', 'notion', 'brilliantly', 'What', 'Milk', 'legacy', 'today', 'personal', 'authenticity', 'most', 'essential', 'quality', 'needed', 'public', 'officials', 'Integrity', 'intelligence', 'springs', 'authenticity', 'clarity', 'purpose', 'sense', 'wit', 'humor', 'second', 'most', 'essential', 'quality', 'Milk', 'possessed', 'both.P.S', 'thought', 'originally', 'posted', 'review', 'Milk', 'was', 'assassinated', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'emerged', 'public', 'health', 'threat', 'gay', 'community', 'Had', 'Milk', 'been', 'scene', 'time', 'have', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'office', 'political', 'power', 'greatest', 'extent', 'possible', 'affect', 'legislation', 'government', 'accountibility', 'response', 'epidemic', 'death', 'really', 'altered', 'course', 'history']",N/A

Amith (kndy),"[5, 5]","Before the Sean Penn biopic ""Milk"" based on the life of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office, there was Robert Epstein's ""The Times of Harvey Milk"".  A documentary that showcases Harvey Milk as he would run for supervisor in San Francisco and became the voice for the gay community but also for minorities, a champion of gay and civil rights and would eventually showcase the day of his assassination and what transpired after his murder.The documentary details the life of Harvey Milk focusing less on his personal life but more on his emerging rise as a politician but how he changed the lives of many people and through this film, interviewed are those who worked on his campaign, those who worked with him professionally, those who were driven by his work and his passion to help people, those who interviewed him and those who were straight but eventually realized how unique and important he was to the community.""MILK"" gives us a glimpse of the life Harvey Milk had and learning more about his challenges running for political office (unsuccessfully) three times, being on the opposing side of Dianne Feinstein at times and also fighting against proposition 6 (The Briggs Initiative) which was on the ballot on Nov. 1978 in which conservative state legislator John Briggs of Orange County wanted to ban gays and lesbians and anyone who supported gay rights from working in California's public schools.The film would also show a juxtaposition of Supervisor Dan White, how he and Harvey Milk would work together but eventually, White would splinter off and end up resigning from his job to raise a family and then to quickly try to get it back months later, which would lead to him assassinating San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.  Showing us the amazing Candlelight Memorial featuring 45,000 people on the night of the deaths of both men and the riots that erupted when the verdict was read on Dan White's murder case.""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is an exhilarating documentary featuring archived footage showcasing Harvey Milk but also a portrait of how the city of San Francisco was at that time period.VIDEO:""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is presented in he aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  Because the film was shot in 1984 and features plenty of archived footage from a variety of cameras and sources, as expected from a documentary, you're going to have quality that is a bit mixed.  But for the most part, the picture quality is pretty good for this film and as one would expect an early '80s film to look quite aged, if anything, the fact that this film gives us a vivid portrait of Harvey Milk and the City of San Francisco in the '70s, I don't think anyone would complain.  This documentary looks good considering its age and its source material.""The Times of Harvey Milk"" was supervised and approved by director Robert Epstein. According to the Criterion Collection, the new digital transfer was created on a 4K Spirit Datacine in 2K resolution from UCLA's restored 35 mm duplicate negative, which was created from the original 16 mm color negative B rolls, 16 mm reversal preproduction elements, and the original 1-inch production master.

Ruby Rich, ""Harvey's Enduring Legacy"" by Stuart Milk and ""Restoring the Times of Harvey Milk"" by Ross Lipman.JUDGMENT CALL:The Criterion Collection is known for bringing out a series of important classic and contemporary films on Blu-ray and DVD.""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is one of those important documentaries of a man who fought for gay and civil rights in San Francisco but became an inspiration for many people all over the world.Consider the time when Harvey Milk came to San Francisco, gay men were ridiculed, beaten and treated badly by the community, including the police who protected the city as many found homosexuality as a form of deviance and unacceptable behavior.  But when a hippie who owned the Castro Camera Shop in the emerging gay Castro district became a political activist, this intelligent man knew that the barriers that existed towards homosexuality had to be broken.While the film ""Milk"" would feature the personal and political life of Harvey Milk, ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is a documentary that showcases the true Harvey Milk on camera.  Featuring archived news footage to footage shot by filmmaker Rob Epstein.From the teamsters who joined Milk to boycott Coors Beer in the Castro Area, to Milk beginning his political career in 1973 and losing each time for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and the California State Assembly.  But eventually his persistence and perseverance would win over the labor unions and now he not only became a champion for gay and civil rights, but he began winning the respect of many people in his area because he was a man of his word and eventually would lead to him being elected for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.But what made this documentary feel so real and captivating was its use of important footage of the times but also candid interviews (shot in the 1983) with people like Anne Kronenberg (an aid to Harvey Milk during his campaign), fellow San Francisco Board of Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, Executive Director of the Chinese for Affirmative Action Henry Der, newscaster Jeannine Yeomans, public school teacher Tom Ammiano and several others.There is no doubt that director Robert Epstein and producer Richard Schmiechen have created a special documentary but done quite tastefully in showcasing Harvey Milks accomplishments but also creating a historic film that shows viewers the emergence of the presence of the gay community in San Francisco.Despite winning an Academy Award, ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" will have its fair of criticism because it is biased documentary as interviews focus on those who were closest to Harvey Milk and does not show interview those who were against Harvey Milk's politics.Nor are their interviews with jurors who would talk about their reasoning for giving Dan White only eight years of prison time (he served only five years for manslaughter) which was an injustice as he killed two human beings, who happen to be the mayor of San Francisco and one of the most well-known Board of Supervisor and politicians in America but also an injustice that if the crime was created by a person of color or someone who was not a well-known conservative and also a Board of Supervisor, Dan White, they would probably be convicted and serve life in prison or electrocuted.There is so many layers to this documentary that the time went rather quickly.  I was amazed by the archived footage that was utilized for this documentary, how well it was cut but also, while showcasing Harvey Milk, how the film shows a juxtaposition of the man who murdered him and how thousands responded on the night of Milk and Mayor George Moscone's death but the violence that took place after the verdict was read.And what makes this Criterion Collection release so impressive is that it doesn't stop there.  They have included a wonderful amount of special features that compliment the film.Not only do you get wonderful audio commentary, but you also get a good number of interviews, interviews, archived video and audio interviews, the recorded will by Harvey Milk, the screening of ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" at the Castro Theatre, video from the 25th Anniversary of Milk/Moscone's death but also tying the documentary to the recent Gus Van Sant film ""Milk"".  But possibly the most significant feature that I felt was quite important to see was the panel discussion on Supervisor Dan White's trial and to hear form the defense lawyers who represented him on their strategy and their thoughts on Dan White at the time and the elimination of the California's ""diminished capacity"" law.Already an impressive collection of special features and audio commentary, if there was one interview that I would have loved to see included in this Blu-ray release of ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" was an interview with homicide Frank Falzon who came out and said in 1998 that when he met Dan White in 1984, White confessed that it was premeditated murder and that White also wanted to kill Carol Ruth Silver and Willie Brown.  Also, it would have been great to see a follow-up interview with those who were featured in the film.  People such as Tom Ammiano who was the public school teacher and later became a Board of Supervisor and also elected as a California State Assemblyman, Henry Der and possibly a few others.Granted, that's me being a little picky but with the special features that you get in this release alone, it is quite impressive and The Criterion Collection really went all out to make ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" on Blu-ray and DVD a fantastic release!Overall, if you were inspired by Harvey Milk, curious about the politics of the time or even seeing how the fight for gay and civil rights evolved from what Harvey Milk accomplished in his political life, I definitely recommend ""The Times of Harvey Milk""!  A five-star release from the Criterion Collection and is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: A Classic documentary, a wonderful Blu-ray release from the Criterion Collection!",1302652800,"04 13,

Although his time was short, he can justiably be cited as an influence in the fight for gay rights.For those of us who were not aware of him during his lifetime, Milk's charisma is apparent to the viewers of this film. One can understand why the city of San Francisco was enveloped in grief after Milk and George Moscone's murders and can only wonder what might have been had they lived. I challenge anyone to try not to tear up watching the scenes of the march after their deaths.The film is powerful enough where one even feels sorry for Dan White, an individual who was in over his head against more politically saavy opponents.Because this DVD was released during the film's 20th anniversary, my main complaint is why doesn't the special features give an update on some of the supporting characters. Rather than listen to the director and editor drone on in the commentary about how certain scenes were shot with natural light, I would have preferred updated information on people such as Jim Elliot (A seemingly unlikely supporter of someone like Milk.

Narrated by Harvey Fierstein, this is as close as you can ever get to the life, times and assassination of Harvey Milk. Having been made within just a few years of Harvey's assassination, it conveys the raw emotion, great interviews with those closest to Harvey, plus all the news/raw footage that was smoothly and expertly transferred to film.Here you will see a number of unusual, glossed-over items such as the footage of Harvey's body (fully covered, of course) being removed from his office where he was shot by Dan White; it segues to footage of the body being removed from the city hall building. A beautifully moving shot of the procession of thousands who held a candlelight march to protest the slap-on-the-wrist sentence White received is intermingled with news broadcasts that were made only a few years earlier.If you are gay, have any interest in this at all, in the work and country-shifting ideals of Milk, or even if you've only seen the slightly sillyMilk, you cannot miss this unique and complete film. It won the Oscar, and all documentaries should be at this level. No reenactments here, no doofy music and no waste. Pure information, emotion and news with the gentle narration of Fierstein.This may well be one of the finest documentaries in existence. It is stunning that is basically a PBS production and was originally shown on PBS. Note: there is a 20th anniversary edition of this documentary plus the Criterion Collection version. I'm not too sure anyone really needs more than the basic documentary - it is that good.",5,What could have been a Milk Resolution in Congress ...,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1637,"['TIMES', 'OF', 'HARVEY', 'MILK', '1984', 'all-time', 'exemplary', 'biographical', 'documentary', 'Narrated', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'ever', 'get', 'life', 'times', 'assassination', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Having', 'been', 'made', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'Harvey', 'assassination', 'raw', 'emotion', 'great', 'interviews', 'closest', 'Harvey', 'news/raw', 'footage', 'was', 'smoothly', 'expertly', 'transferred', 'film.Here', 'will', 'see', 'number', 'unusual', 'glossed-over', 'items', 'such', 'footage', 'Harvey', 'body', 'fully', 'covered', 'course', 'being', 'removed', 'office', 'where', 'was', 'shot', 'Dan', 'White', 'footage', 'body', 'being', 'removed', 'city', 'hall', 'building', 'beautifully', 'moving', 'shot', 'procession', 'thousands', 'who', 'held', 'candlelight', 'march', 'protest', 'slap-on-the-wrist', 'sentence', 'White', 'received', 'intermingled', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'were', 'made', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'are', 'gay', 'have', 'interest', 'work', 'country-shifting', 'ideals', 'Milk', 'even', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'slightly', 'sillyMilk', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'unique', 'complete', 'film', 'won', 'Oscar', 'documentaries', 'should', 'be', 'level', 'No', 'reenactments', 'here', 'doofy', 'music', 'waste', 'Pure', 'information', 'emotion', 'news', 'gentle', 'narration', 'Fierstein.This', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'documentaries', 'existence', 'stunning', 'basically', 'PBS', 'production', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'PBS', 'Note', '20th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'documentary', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'version', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'anyone', 'really', 'more', 'basic', 'documentary', 'good']",N/A

He had an ability to build bridges and unite people not unlike what we have seen in President Obama.  Second, as the film discussed the battle over Proposition 6 (which would have forced school districts to fire all gay teachers), I was shaking my head in amazement that we are still seeing the same kind of bigotry in the context of ballot initiatives.

From the beginning newsreel, of a shell-shocked Diane Feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, to the final reel of Harvey Milk's prophetic and haunting statements, the viewer is mesmerized. Though Harvey Milk was a San Francisco city supervisor, his election in the 1970's, that of an open and unrepentant gay man, made national headlines . He was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere, who at that time were unrepresented and, for the most part, still forced into the closet. This film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of Harvey Milk, but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time. Milk was a very eloquent speaker, and his sensibility, logic, and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent. This is best displayed in the footage of his  debate with then California Senator Briggs, a buffoon like character, who not only was a terrible speaker, who couldn't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears, but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis Milk. The public view at that time was about family values, with the Anita Bryants condeming homosexuals to Hell for their decadent ways (Old times come round again....). Milk's voice opposed this view openly, and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented. The notion of this martyrdom, and its romantic though fateful attraction to Milk, has been argued. Nevertheless, his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued, and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message, nor the admiration he deserves. This film unfolds as it happened, seeming like fiction, but all too real. As Milk is assassinated, along with the Mayor, by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor Dan White, whose subsequent trial, with the famous ""Twinkie Defense"", and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders, resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen. As one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation,... if only the Mayor had been killed, White would have gotten life, but the fact that Milk, a gay man, had also been killed, leaned public sympathy  towards White, an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.There are many moving, telling, historically signifigant moments in this film, but none so clearly represents those times, and Milk's loss and legacy, as the film of the nighttime march in San Francisco right after the murders. Seas of people, holding candles and standing silently, came together in a very moving moment in time. This film, which won best documentary at that years Oscars, transcends its subject matter, and is simply a great documentary. Gay rights have made much progress. And perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all, excluding those who were there, are old enough to remember , or are gay.  Nonetheless, Harvey Milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement, and his legacy, through schools named after him, organizations, and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless, lives on.",5,A Man For His Times.,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,3369,"['have', 'owned', 'copy', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'probably', 'watched', 'ten', 'times', 'always', 'tear', 'up', 'little', 'viewing', 'beginning', 'newsreel', 'shell-shocked', 'Diane', 'Feinstein', 'announcing', 'less', 'hour', 'old', 'murders', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Mayor', 'George', 'Moscone', 'final', 'reel', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'prophetic', 'haunting', 'statements', 'viewer', 'mesmerized', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'was', 'San', 'Francisco', 'city', 'supervisor', 'election', '1970', 'open', 'unrepentant', 'gay', 'man', 'made', 'national', 'headlines', 'was', 'ray', 'hope', 'gay', 'people', 'everywhere', 'who', 'time', 'were', 'unrepresented', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'forced', 'closet', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'insight', 'philosiphy', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'rare', 'document', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'seemingly', 'ancient', 'time', 'Milk', 'was', 'very', 'eloquent', 'speaker', 'sensibility', 'logic', 'unapologetic', 'viewpoint', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'made', 'mincemeat', 'verbal', 'opponent', 'best', 'displayed', 'footage', 'debate', 'then', 'California', 'Senator', 'Briggs', 'buffoon', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'terrible', 'speaker', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'clearly', 'express', 'arguably', 'irrational', 'fears', 'who', 'fact', 'seemed', 'much', 'prissier', 'nemesis', 'Milk', 'public', 'view', 'time', 'was', 'family', 'values', 'Anita', 'Bryants', 'condeming', 'homosexuals', 'Hell', 'decadent', 'ways', 'Old', 'come', 'round', 'again', 'Milk', 'voice', 'opposed', 'view', 'openly', 'seemed', 'predict', 'early', 'demise', 'hands', 'assassin', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'represented', 'notion', 'martyrdom', 'romantic', 'fateful', 'attraction', 'Milk', 'been', 'argued', 'Nevertheless', 'bravery', 'representing', 'unrepresented', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'argued', 'sordid', 'details', 'love', 'affairs', 'personal', 'life', 'should', 'not', 'diminish', 'message', 'admiration', 'film', 'happened', 'seeming', 'fiction', 'too', 'real', 'Milk', 'assassinated', 'Mayor', 'homophobic', 'disgruntled', 'resigned', 'supervisor', 'Dan', 'White', 'subsequent', 'trial', 'famous', 'Twinkie', 'Defense', 'being', 'sentenced', 'appalling', 'five', 'years', 'murders', 'resulted', 'riots', 'likes', 'city', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'interviewed', 'here', 'sad', 'resignation', 'only', 'Mayor', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'White', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'life', 'fact', 'Milk', 'gay', 'man', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'killed', 'leaned', 'public', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'White', 'absurd', 'too', 'realistic', 'conclusion.There', 'are', 'many', 'moving', 'telling', 'historically', 'signifigant', 'moments', 'film', 'none', 'so', 'clearly', 'times', 'Milk', 'loss', 'legacy', 'film', 'nighttime', 'march', 'San', 'Francisco', 'right', 'murders', 'Seas', 'people', 'holding', 'candles', 'standing', 'silently', 'came', 'together', 'very', 'moving', 'moment', 'time', 'film', 'won', 'best', 'documentary', 'years', 'Oscars', 'subject', 'matter', 'simply', 'great', 'documentary', 'Gay', 'rights', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'progress', 'perhaps', 'time', 'diminished', 'names', 'memories', 'most', 'excluding', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'are', 'gay', 'Nonetheless', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'representive', 'icon', 'early', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'legacy', 'schools', 'named', 'organizations', 'place', 'history', 'voice', 'too', 'often', 'voiceless']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 2]","As the 1970s progressed gay and lesbian community became increasingly visible and vocal and made numerous civil rights gains throughout the nation.  They also became subject to backlash from conservatives who found them threatening.  In 1977 Harvey Milk became the first openly gay man to win elected office in the United States of America, receiving a position on San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.  Less than a year later he, along with Mayor George Moscone, would be dead--assasinated by Dan White, a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who had resigned but days earlier, subsequently sought reinstatement, and who faulted Milk for Moscone's refusal to reappoint him.White possessed a distinctly ""All American Boy"" background and physical appearance.  When he stood trial less than six months later, the court refused to seat jurors who were gay or of any minority background and the case went to a jury that proved sympathetic to his claim of mitigating factors.  These factors included the notorious ""Twinkie Defense,"" so named because White claimed than an over-indulgence of sweet junk food had fueled an unstable state of mind.  The jury found White guilty of manslaughter instead of murder, a verdict that horrified most residents of the city and which sparked violent protests from local gays and lesbians.Then and now, Milk is seen as indicative of the successes the gay and lesbian community can have and of the risks they run in the process.  The subject of numerous works, in 1984 he was the subject of THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HARVEY MILK, an Oscar-winning documentary.  Seen today, the film does a very good job of documenting Milk, his death, and its aftermath; at the same time, however, it has a surprisingly slow and somewhat superficial quality.Part of this is due to Harvey Fierstein's narration, which has an unduly reverent tone and tends to drag down the pace of the film.  But is more due to the fact that the documentary never actually seems to regard Milk as more icon than actual person.  We follow his career, but not in real detail, and we actually learn less about Milk as an individual than we do of his killer, Dan White (who committed suicide in 1985, about two years after his release from prison and at about the same time this film was released.)  The film is certainly to be commended for its attempt to document a turning point in American civil rights, but at the same time the whole thing seems, well, just a little shallow.The DVD includes commentary but nothing more in the way of bonuses--and this is a subject that would benefit from them.  Recommended, but in truth you are likely to learn more about Milk, Moscone, White, and the events of the era from an hour's casual reading than you will from this film.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,"Slightly Slow, Slightly Shallow Portrait of a Turning Point In American Civil Rights",1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,2795,"['1970s', 'progressed', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'community', 'became', 'increasingly', 'visible', 'vocal', 'made', 'numerous', 'civil', 'rights', 'gains', 'nation', 'also', 'became', 'subject', 'backlash', 'conservatives', 'who', 'found', 'threatening', '1977', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'became', 'first', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'win', 'elected', 'office', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'receiving', 'position', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Board', 'Supervisors', 'Less', 'year', 'later', 'Mayor', 'George', 'Moscone', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'assasinated', 'Dan', 'White', 'former', 'member', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Board', 'Supervisors', 'who', 'had', 'resigned', 'days', 'earlier', 'subsequently', 'sought', 'reinstatement', 'who', 'faulted', 'Milk', 'Moscone', 'refusal', 'reappoint', 'him.White', 'possessed', 'distinctly', 'American', 'Boy', 'background', 'physical', 'appearance', 'When', 'stood', 'trial', 'less', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'court', 'refused', 'seat', 'jurors', 'who', 'were', 'gay', 'minority', 'background', 'case', 'went', 'jury', 'proved', 'sympathetic', 'claim', 'mitigating', 'factors', 'factors', 'included', 'notorious', 'Twinkie', 'Defense', 'so', 'named', 'White', 'claimed', 'over-indulgence', 'sweet', 'junk', 'food', 'had', 'fueled', 'unstable', 'state', 'mind', 'jury', 'found', 'White', 'guilty', 'manslaughter', 'instead', 'murder', 'verdict', 'horrified', 'most', 'residents', 'city', 'sparked', 'violent', 'protests', 'local', 'gays', 'lesbians.Then', 'now', 'Milk', 'seen', 'indicative', 'successes', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'community', 'can', 'have', 'risks', 'run', 'process', 'subject', 'numerous', 'works', '1984', 'was', 'subject', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'AND', 'TIMES', 'OF', 'HARVEY', 'MILK', 'Oscar-winning', 'documentary', 'Seen', 'today', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'documenting', 'Milk', 'death', 'aftermath', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'surprisingly', 'slow', 'somewhat', 'superficial', 'quality.Part', 'due', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'narration', 'unduly', 'reverent', 'tone', 'drag', 'down', 'pace', 'film', 'more', 'due', 'fact', 'documentary', 'never', 'actually', 'regard', 'Milk', 'more', 'icon', 'actual', 'person', 'follow', 'career', 'not', 'real', 'detail', 'actually', 'learn', 'less', 'about', 'Milk', 'individual', 'do', 'killer', 'Dan', 'White', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', '1985', 'about', 'two', 'years', 'release', 'prison', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'film', 'certainly', 'be', 'commended', 'attempt', 'document', 'turning', 'point', 'American', 'civil', 'rights', 'same', 'time', 'whole', 'thing', 'well', 'just', 'little', 'shallow.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'nothing', 'more', 'way', 'bonuses', 'subject', 'would', 'benefit', 'Recommended', 'truth', 'are', 'likely', 'learn', 'more', 'Milk', 'Moscone', 'White', 'events', 'era', 'hour', 'casual', 'reading', 'will', 'film.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

For the longest time, I've been wanting to watch this film, but for various reasons, I haven't gotten around to it.  Even when I finally sat down and watched it, I delayed it for a week or so because I had a feeling I was going to cry during part of it.  After that delay, I stopped making excuses and just popped it in and let it rip.The film is extraordinary for many reasons.  It focuses on only a few people who knew Harvey Milk very well.  Documentaries these days try to encompass too much information, and end up shortchanging their subjects because of this.  This film doesn't.  The handful of people who comprise the interview segments are quite moving and talk about Harvey in such a positive and meaningful way.  They also cry when recounting their feelings during the assassination of Harvey and the mayor of San Francisco at the tim, George Moscone.The film is also sad in that when it shows Dan White, the man who killed Harvey and George, engaging in the same tired, cliched, ""family values"" rhetoric that is still permeating our political discourse (the recent passing of Prop 8 in California is still fresh in everyone's mind), and State Senator John Briggs attempting to pass Prop 6, which would ban gay people from teaching in the public schools on the ridiculous, asinine claim that gay people are more prone to molest children (they're not, and luckily, this POS of proposition didn't pass, much to the relief of gays, lesbians, and intelligent human beings everywhere).  The scene where Milk debates Briggs is painful to watch, as Briggs is absolutely clueless about it all, preferring to deal with stupid, stock ""family values"" phrases, and Milk shreds his arguments to pieces.  It's sad that we're still debating this garbage, because gays are just as equal as anyone.It also shows the asinine defense of White by his lawyers that he ate too much junk food, and that despite having a gun and extra ammunition, didn't want to really kill White.  Dan White had resigned from the city council abruptly, then changed his mind.  He campaigned for the mayor of San Francisco to reinstate him, but the mayor said no.  White then snuck into City Hall through a window, shot the mayor, then shot Milk.  Many have commented that if White had only shot the mayor, he would have been sentenced for life.  But shooting a gay man (and a very prominent gay activist/politician) provoked ""sympathy"" from the jury, because White was a purveyor of ""family values"", so White got off easy, only serving five years for manslaughter, not murder, provoking riots in San Francisco.  But two years after White got released from prison, he killed himself.  It's hard to tell whether White really wanted to kill Milk for his sexual orientation.  The film never shows White making any overly homophobic statements.  Milk, sadly, just happened to be in the room with the mayor at the time that Dan White came in.  Ulitmately, it's kind of immaterial whether White meant to kill Milk for his homosexuality, because White killed two human beings, a mayor and an extraordinary man called Harvey Milk.  The whole town of San Francisco was shattered by this idiotic killing, and the scene with the candlelight vigil for the mayor and Harvey is one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen in a documentary/film EVER.  The people extend for literally miles and miles, and if you don't cry during this scene, you're not human.  I did.This is one of the most moving documentaries I've ever seen.  It's phenomenal that only a handful of people (only 5 people are interviewed in the film) can make you feel that you know Harvey Milk by the end of the film.  Harvey was a deeply charismatic, wonderful man who inspired people and believed that everyone deserved to be treated with respect and dignity.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[1, 1]","This glorious account of Harvey Milk's time in San Francisco-- it is not an account of his life-- won the Oscar for best documentary in 1984 and, more importantly, won the hearts of all of us who saw it in the theatres. It holds up magnificently twenty-five years later. And while the fine movie ""Milk"" makes my eyes burn three or four times when I watch it (three times now) I found myself awash with tears the last 30 minutes of this hour and a half documentary for what happened, what might have been, where would the gay movement be now if Mr. White had not done his infamous deed, etc.Directed by Rob Epstein-- who provides a running commentary on the DVD-- ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" unfolds by means of both still photos and video footage as well as interviews with 8 people: Anne Kronenberg, who managed Harvey's last, successful campaign; the very emotional Tony Ammiano, who later was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors I believe; Henry Der; Tory Hartmann; Bill Krauss; Sally Gearheat-- isn't she the sort of person you want to hug immediately-- Jannine Yeomans, a TV reporter who covered much of Milk's campaigns; and Jim Elliot, a labor representative. The gravely-voiced Harvey Fierstein of ""Torch Song Trilogy"" narratives the film, and Mark Isham wrote the original music, consisting of a synthesizer, trumpet and oboe, that will blow you away.Each one of the eight talking heads relates his or her view and relationship with Milk. Almost to a person they weep when they describe his death and the following candlelight march and funeral service. (In a touching sequence, Mr. Epstein says that he regrets not including more time on Mayor Moscone's family in the film.) As poignant as any of the commentators is Elliot, who goes from seeing Milk as just another ""fruit"" to someone he admired and respected. Harvey would have been proud since one of his mantras was that we should all come out to everyone in order that people could see who we were.

816929,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B0001Y4LDW,James Hiller,"[78, 80]","I was one of the millions who probably heard of Harvey Milk at some point in my life, but never connected any dots to his life. Then one summer day, while housesitting, I found an old VHS tape of this documentary called ""The Times of Harvey Milk"". Not having anything better to do, I popped it in the VCR and sat back to watch. Two hours later, my life, perspectives, and outlooks were dramatically transformed by meeting Supervisor Harvey Milk. So it is with great excitement that this monumental film which pays tribute to a monumental time finally comes to DVD, and warrants my attention for my 200th review.""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is a transformative documentary both in style and information, created by visionary filmmakers Rob Epstein and Richard Schmiechen. The film not only covers the life of Milk, but the times which surrounded him that allows for a broader, more in-depth story. From the opening moments of the film, we learn of Harvey's untimely death, so as not to aggrandize it. Through personal interviews, newsreel coverage, and personal film shot at certain events, everything is brought to a real, intense focus. You feel as if you are watching the events unfold as San Franscians must have done in the late 1970's.The shining stars of the film are the personal interviews given by people who knew Harvey best. Tom Ammiano, friend of Harvey, gives the film a sense of outrage of the assassinations. Jim Elliot gives a heartwarming straight man, unionist perspective to show us Harvey's universality. Henry Der allows us to see Harvey's political side. Jannine Yeoman's covering of the Milk campaign and post -assassination trial gives a sense of immediacy and urgency to the story, and a more professional viewpoint. Bill Kraus, a gay activist, soon to die of AIDS, provided a sense of Milk's activism.A couple of interviewee struck me personally. First, lesbian activist Sally Gearheart's testimony of her work with Milk on the Proposition 6 campaign is very compelling, but her comments on the candlelight vigil and riots following the verdict are particularly poignant. Anne Kronenberg, who served as Milk's campaign manager, provides the zeal and optimism of the youth who surrounded and supported Milk in his efforts. Last comes Tory Hartmann, who's warmth on the screen is only seconded by her connection with Harvey. She provides an emotional recollection of the candlelight march that will leave you in tears.Coming to DVD, this film looks rich and new, due to UCLA and its preservation processes. In addition to the film, the DVD brings you a second disk loaded with special features, from interviews with the film makers, to an 25th anniversary update of the Milk legacy by those who knew him best. I was particularly touched watching the ""Alternate ending"" section, in which Jim Elliot discloses, after describing his own journey as a straight man accepting homosexual Harvey Milk, learns his own daughter is also a lesbian, and that it was all okay, thereby completing validating Milk's thoughts on coming out.Not enough words can be said about ""The Times of Harvey Milk"", a visionary, compelling documentary that should be shown, shared with everyone across this country. Milk's legacy is not only for his homosexual brothers and sisters; it is a legacy for all of us. His legacy is that of tolerance towards all, peaceful protest, fighting for what you believe in, and above all else, just having the best time of your life.",5,"His life, his legacy; our hope",1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,3461,"['was', 'one', 'millions', 'who', 'probably', 'heard', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'point', 'life', 'never', 'connected', 'dots', 'life', 'Then', 'one', 'summer', 'day', 'housesitting', 'found', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'documentary', 'called', 'Times', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Not', 'having', 'anything', 'better', 'do', 'popped', 'VCR', 'sat', 'back', 'watch', 'Two', 'hours', 'later', 'life', 'perspectives', 'outlooks', 'were', 'dramatically', 'transformed', 'meeting', 'Supervisor', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'great', 'excitement', 'monumental', 'film', 'tribute', 'monumental', 'time', 'finally', 'DVD', 'warrants', 'attention', '200th', 'review', 'Times', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'transformative', 'documentary', 'style', 'information', 'created', 'visionary', 'filmmakers', 'Rob', 'Epstein', 'Richard', 'Schmiechen', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'Milk', 'times', 'surrounded', 'broader', 'more', 'in-depth', 'story', 'opening', 'moments', 'film', 'learn', 'Harvey', 'untimely', 'death', 'so', 'not', 'aggrandize', 'personal', 'interviews', 'newsreel', 'coverage', 'personal', 'film', 'shot', 'certain', 'events', 'everything', 'brought', 'real', 'intense', 'focus', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'events', 'unfold', 'San', 'Franscians', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'late', ""1970's.The"", 'shining', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'personal', 'interviews', 'given', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Harvey', 'best', 'Tom', 'Ammiano', 'friend', 'Harvey', 'film', 'sense', 'outrage', 'assassinations', 'Jim', 'Elliot', 'heartwarming', 'straight', 'man', 'unionist', 'perspective', 'show', 'Harvey', 'universality', 'Henry', 'Der', 'see', 'Harvey', 'political', 'side', 'Jannine', 'Yeoman', 'covering', 'Milk', 'campaign', 'post', '-assassination', 'trial', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'urgency', 'story', 'more', 'professional', 'viewpoint', 'Bill', 'Kraus', 'gay', 'activist', 'soon', 'die', 'AIDS', 'provided', 'sense', 'Milk', 'activism.A', 'couple', 'interviewee', 'struck', 'personally', 'First', 'lesbian', 'activist', 'Sally', 'Gearheart', 'testimony', 'work', 'Milk', 'Proposition', '6', 'campaign', 'very', 'compelling', 'comments', 'candlelight', 'vigil', 'riots', 'following', 'verdict', 'are', 'particularly', 'poignant', 'Anne', 'Kronenberg', 'who', 'served', 'Milk', 'campaign', 'manager', 'zeal', 'optimism', 'youth', 'who', 'surrounded', 'supported', 'Milk', 'efforts', 'Last', 'Tory', 'Hartmann', 'who', 'warmth', 'screen', 'only', 'seconded', 'connection', 'Harvey', 'emotional', 'recollection', 'candlelight', 'march', 'will', 'leave', 'tears.Coming', 'DVD', 'film', 'rich', 'new', 'due', 'UCLA', 'preservation', 'processes', 'addition', 'film', 'DVD', 'second', 'disk', 'loaded', 'special', 'features', 'interviews', 'film', 'makers', '25th', 'anniversary', 'update', 'Milk', 'legacy', 'who', 'knew', 'best', 'was', 'particularly', 'touched', 'watching', 'Alternate', 'ending', 'section', 'Jim', 'Elliot', 'discloses', 'describing', 'own', 'journey', 'straight', 'man', 'accepting', 'homosexual', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'own', 'daughter', 'also', 'lesbian', 'was', 'okay', 'thereby', 'completing', 'validating', 'Milk', 'thoughts', 'coming', 'out.Not', 'enough', 'words', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Times', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'visionary', 'compelling', 'documentary', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'shared', 'everyone', 'country', 'Milk', 'legacy', 'not', 'only', 'homosexual', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'legacy', 'legacy', 'tolerance', 'towards', 'peaceful', 'protest', 'fighting', 'what', 'believe', 'else', 'just', 'having', 'best', 'time', 'life']",N/A

Of course, this cult 1984 documentary is mainly about the epicenter of the epicenter: activist and later City Supervisor Harvey Milk, the nation's first openly gay person elected to public office.  If you've seen and were moved by the Gus Van Sant/Sean Penn film ""Milk"", you owe it to yourself to see that film's acknowledged primary source, ""The Times of Harvey Milk"".  This documentary, winner of the 1984 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, is especially valuable now, as it allows us to see- more than thirty years later- the actual people, their statements, the issues, and side-issues that were just coming to the fore during that historic time.I notice that, at this time, Amazon is limited to offering pricey copies of ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" via second-hand sellers.  If the various costs of these offerings are prohibitive to you, you might want to do what I did and just add the film to your Netflix queue and see it that way.  I think you can even see the second disc of extra features that way, though so far I've only rented the first disc featuring the main feature.

As I was graduating high school, it was a serendipitous time because the world seemed to validate who I was and what I stood for. My parents were early civil rights supporters so I was always politically aware. My first memory of an election was President Kennedy's election in 1960 being broadcast on network television. News was very clinical but focused.Brewing underneath San Francisco's welcoming of the hippie era, the Haight-Ashbury would eventually suffer negative press because of the drug culture overwhelming the political aspects of the burgeoning liberal movement. I grew up in the Richmond District and had only faint knowledge of the Castro area. In 1970, it was still very much a working class catholic-immigrant neighborhood. By 1971-72, it would become the third area of the city that drew favor from the gay community. Polk St. would remain the draw for a lot of transients. Folsom St. would reflect the dark underside of the sexual revolution. Dark in the sense of catering to any and all sorts of fetishes. Castro St. would become representative of the modern day LGBT movement.Gay men, forever plagued growing up as ""sissies"" and ""effeminate men"", the Castro would be the birthplace of the Castro clone, ultra masculine, overly butch but most decidedly gay.There amongst the burgeoning LGBT scene, arose Harvey Milk. My friends and I were new to college and though we were politically-minded, we also went our college courses in the morning, worked in the afternoon, studied in the early evening and went clubbing until the wee hours of the next morn and then repeat the cycle again as a ritual that kept us fortified. We knew of Harvey Milk, supported his policies but also felt a bit removed from some of the politics.This moving documentary is a trippy postcard back to that era. It all seemed so innocent then. Charles Pierce would play the Gold Coast, Busby's on Polk St. would be banging the new Diana Ross masterpiece, ""Love Hangover"" and San Francisco became the proud home of many ostracized gays and lesbians.I still cry though I have seen this documentary numerous times. It is hard to believe that 40 years have now passed by. In homage to that period, the long out of print documentary is now back in Blu-Ray and given the Criterion Collection treatment. There is so much truth to the passage that ""our freedoms are only a generation away from being taken from us"".........the newly emboldened sleazy rethuglican party has now gone after all of the many freedoms we fought so dearly far from the civil rights battles of the 50s/60s and 70s, women's liberation of the 70s and LGBT movement of the 70s as well.This is a must for anyone that has a remote interest in the dynamics of a great movement, almost accidentally headed by a man that partly through his politics and partly through his eventual assassination, would become its greatest symbol.",5,My Formative Years at the Dawn of the Gay Liberation Movement,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,3017,"['Growing', 'up', 'San', 'Francisco', '60s', '70s', 'city', 'was', 'always', 'open', 'door', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'personalities', 'causes', 'was', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'serendipitous', 'time', 'world', 'seemed', 'validate', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'stood', 'parents', 'were', 'early', 'civil', 'rights', 'supporters', 'so', 'was', 'always', 'politically', 'aware', 'first', 'memory', 'election', 'was', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'election', '1960', 'being', 'broadcast', 'network', 'television', 'News', 'was', 'very', 'clinical', 'focused.Brewing', 'underneath', 'San', 'Francisco', 'welcoming', 'hippie', 'era', 'Haight-Ashbury', 'would', 'eventually', 'suffer', 'negative', 'press', 'drug', 'culture', 'overwhelming', 'political', 'aspects', 'burgeoning', 'liberal', 'movement', 'grew', 'up', 'Richmond', 'District', 'had', 'only', 'faint', 'knowledge', 'Castro', 'area', '1970', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'working', 'class', 'catholic-immigrant', 'neighborhood', '1971-72', 'would', 'become', 'third', 'area', 'city', 'drew', 'favor', 'gay', 'community', 'Polk', 'St.', 'would', 'remain', 'draw', 'lot', 'transients', 'Folsom', 'St.', 'would', 'reflect', 'dark', 'underside', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'Dark', 'sense', 'catering', 'sorts', 'fetishes', 'Castro', 'St.', 'would', 'become', 'representative', 'modern', 'day', 'LGBT', 'movement.Gay', 'men', 'forever', 'plagued', 'growing', 'up', 'sissies', 'effeminate', 'men', 'Castro', 'would', 'be', 'birthplace', 'Castro', 'clone', 'ultra', 'masculine', 'overly', 'butch', 'most', 'decidedly', 'gay.There', 'amongst', 'burgeoning', 'LGBT', 'scene', 'arose', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'friends', 'were', 'new', 'college', 'were', 'politically-minded', 'also', 'went', 'college', 'courses', 'morning', 'worked', 'afternoon', 'studied', 'early', 'evening', 'went', 'clubbing', 'wee', 'hours', 'next', 'morn', 'then', 'repeat', 'cycle', 'again', 'ritual', 'kept', 'fortified', 'knew', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'supported', 'policies', 'also', 'felt', 'bit', 'removed', 'politics.This', 'moving', 'documentary', 'trippy', 'postcard', 'back', 'era', 'seemed', 'so', 'innocent', 'then', 'Charles', 'Pierce', 'would', 'play', 'Gold', 'Coast', 'Busby', 'Polk', 'St.', 'would', 'be', 'banging', 'new', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'masterpiece', 'Love', 'Hangover', 'San', 'Francisco', 'became', 'proud', 'home', 'many', 'ostracized', 'gays', 'lesbians.I', 'still', 'have', 'seen', 'documentary', 'numerous', 'times', 'hard', 'believe', '40', 'years', 'have', 'now', 'passed', 'homage', 'period', 'long', 'print', 'documentary', 'now', 'back', 'Blu-Ray', 'given', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'treatment', 'so', 'much', 'truth', 'passage', 'freedoms', 'are', 'only', 'generation', 'away', 'being', 'taken', 'newly', 'emboldened', 'sleazy', 'rethuglican', 'party', 'now', 'gone', 'many', 'freedoms', 'fought', 'so', 'dearly', 'far', 'civil', 'rights', 'battles', '50s/60s', '70s', 'women', 'liberation', '70s', 'LGBT', 'movement', '70s', 'well.This', 'must', 'anyone', 'remote', 'interest', 'dynamics', 'great', 'movement', 'almost', 'accidentally', 'headed', 'man', 'partly', 'politics', 'partly', 'eventual', 'assassination', 'would', 'become', 'greatest', 'symbol']",N/A

816936,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B0001Y4LDW,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[0, 0]","""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is an excellent documentary about the work of openly gay San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk for human rights and ""the little guy"" which ended in tragedy on November 27, 1978 when he was killed along with Mayor George Moscone by rival former Supervisor Dan White.  This documentary was released in 1984, so the events were still fresh and vivid for the people interviewed.  The interviews were drawn from a fairly diverse group of people including Milk's City Hall Aide Anne Kronenberg, Political Consultant Tory Hartmann, openly gay school teacher Tom Ammiano, auto machinist Jim Elliot (I would have liked information on the Coors Beer boycott mentioned by Elliot as one of the things that first endeared him to Milk), television reporter Jeannine Yeomans, etc.  An interview with a political rival of Milk's or, perhaps, a friend or colleague of Dan White would have rounded things out but it is understandable if no such interview was pursued or if such interview requests were declined.  White committed suicide a year after this documentary was released.The blending of vintage news footage with the interviews was very well-done.  The documentary began with a stunned Board of Supervisors President Dianne Feinstein announcing the assassinations and suspect to the press.  Other footage included news reports on the campaign trail of Milk and White (a clean-cut Vietnam vet and fireman who ran for ""old fashion values"").  These clips gave a glimpse of how gay rights were regarded at the time.  The debate over Proposition 6, which would have denied open homosexuals jobs in schools, was very telling.  In a television debate, Senator John Briggs who initiated the Proposition, said that, by cutting the homosexual group out of the equation, the odds of child molestations in schools would be reduced.  Such a ridiculous comment was greeted by a laugh from Milk.  At a conference, Milk took issue with allegations that homosexual teachers could influence students to become homosexuals: ""If teachers are going to affect you as role models, there'd be a lot of nuns running the streets these days.""  One interesting clip was of President Jimmy Carter visiting Sacramento.  Governor Jerry Brown whispered to him before he left the stage and the President returned asking the crowd to vote against Proposition 6.  Jerry Brown is the Governor of California today.Soon after Proposition 6 went down in defeat, thanks in large part to the efforts of Milk and his supporters, White resigned from the Board of Supervisors.  This decision caught his district by surprise (he had been against Prop 6 although, earlier, he had been the only dissenting vote against a Gay Rights Bill).  Later, however, he wanted to return to the Board.  News footage showed a rally of his supporters to get him reappointed, but Mayor Moscone had other plans.  Incensed he was not going to be reappointed, he climbed into the window of City Hall and assassinated Moscone and Milk.  News footage shows the covered bodies being removed from the building as well a White's capture.  An audio clip of White's confession actually brought sympathy to his case.  The demonstration after the assassinations was peaceful, but the reaction to the ""twinkie defense"" verdict was not.  The vintage footage used in this documentary gave a sense of being there because the news clips were the same as what was seen at the time.  As the title indicates, this documentary not only gives one a perspective on Harvey Milk's life and work, but also on the political-social climate during his brief time in office.

He has temper tantrums, he lacks patience at times, but he calls on ALL of us, gay or straight, as members of the human condition, to make our world a better place.  He calls us to see the links between the oppression of gays, asians, blacks, women, the poor, etc and challenges us to rise up in our own communities and fight for every one of these causes because it is the right thing to do.The film is exquisitely made, using photographs, news reports, radio broadcasts, and interviews with Milk's friends and political cohorts.  It reaches down into you and tears at your heart, it enrages you when White doesn't really get the full brunt of the law, and it inspires you with that most difficult of things... hope.",5,"Amazing.

The picture quality is shockingly great considering that much of the footage comes from random sources, but the greatest prize is all the special features.  Harvey Milk's story is exceedingly inspiring, and for anyone who is casually a fan of his life will no doubt want to devour every bonus available.  Fortunately, Criterion delivered, as they always do, and provided us with hours of great stuff.For those who have not seen this documentary, however, let the bonus content simmer for a while and dive right into the feature presentation.  It is a content rich masterpiece that captures the efforts of one of the world's greatest gay civil rights activists.  It was also made in an important time, when homophobia was especially epic due to the AIDS crisis and the fact that Milk murderer Dan White had been recently released from prison after only a short sentence.  It wouldn't surprise me in the least if this touching documentary lead Mr. White to kill himself.  Not that that was its intention. The film is very neutral and is by no means an object of propaganda.  It simply celebrates the life of a brave man who fought hard, succeeded, and inspired millions around the world.If you are gay, you MUST watch this.  Not having an in-depth understanding of Harvey Milk's life would be like being black and never having heard of Martin Luther King Jr.  He's that important.  But straight people owe it to themselves to watch this film as well.  Anybody can be inspired by brilliant people, and certainly you don't have to be gay to stand up for gay rights.

At that time I was too busy raising my sons and wasn't politically minded at that time of my life. I wanted to learn more about this incident so I saw this movie.Dan Brown (another supervisor) resigned from his position. Family, friends and supporters said he shouldn't have done that and he asked for his job back. When he heard he probably wouldn't be reinstated he killed them. He had a gun and bullets in his pockets. Yet a jury let him get away with pretty much a slap on the hand. He served only five years incarcerated. His defense was he was under pressure and eating too much junk food. The Twinkie Defense. As people said in the film, if he only assassinated Mayor George Moscone instead of also killing Harvey Milk (who was gay), he would have done hard time.One of the faults I suppose of the jury system is that since it is a jury of your peers is that sometimes they will let you get away with a ""hate crime"".
