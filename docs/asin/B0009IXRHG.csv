906453,A23LW79IIQ64FE,B0009IXRHG,"Eric ""Rico""","[53, 53]","This is a great DVD to add to a Johnny cash collection.  This is an A&amp;E program that dates back to 1998 (before Johnny's death).  It features interviews with Rosanne Cash, Tom Petty, Johnny's brother and sister, ect...  There are alot of footage and pictures I have never seen before.  A&amp;E really put alot of effort into this DVD.  The content is mostly his early stuff then they briefly talk about the late 70's and 80's but still very informative.This is a great portrait of Johnny Cash that anyone can enjoy.  I have a learned a few new things about The man in black that I never read about in both his autobiographies.",4,Very Good,1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,630,"['great', 'DVD', 'add', 'Johnny', 'cash', 'collection', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'program', 'back', '1998', 'Johnny', 'death', 'interviews', 'Rosanne', 'Cash', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Johnny', 'brother', 'sister', 'ect', 'are', 'alot', 'footage', 'pictures', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'really', 'put', 'alot', 'effort', 'DVD', 'content', 'mostly', 'early', 'stuff', 'then', 'briefly', 'talk', 'late', '70', '80', 'still', 'very', 'informative.This', 'great', 'portrait', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'have', 'learned', 'few', 'new', 'things', 'man', 'black', 'never', 'read', 'autobiographies']",N/A

Born in Arkansas to a poor environment, his father had to leave Arkansas to find work following the railroads.Johnny close to his brother Jack, who at 14 worked to help support the family, was devastated when his brother was killed in a work related accident.  Injured by the equipment, while working.  Johnny never recovered from this loss.His music saved him from loneliness and when this wasn't sufficient, drugs and alcohol.  He battled these addictions all his adult life.Johnny was a man's man.  He did many visits to prisons and the prisoners could relate to him and loved him and his music.In the early 1950's, Johnny went on the road with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and all recorded under Sun records in Memphis, Tennessee.Later on Johnny wanted to record ""Gospel Music"" but Sun records was against it.  When his contract expired, Columbia was his new recording company and his first Gospel albums were published.  My favorite isThe Gospel Road: A Story of Jesus Told and Sung by Johnny Cash {2LP Gatefold with Booklet}Cash was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. Two years before his death, in 2001, he received the National Medal of the Arts for artistic excellence.",4,"American troubadour of country music,",1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,1325,"['documentary', 'spans', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'birth', '1932', 'renaissance', '1990', 'Born', 'Arkansas', 'poor', 'environment', 'father', 'had', 'leave', 'Arkansas', 'find', 'work', 'following', 'railroads.Johnny', 'close', 'brother', 'Jack', 'who', '14', 'worked', 'help', 'support', 'family', 'was', 'devastated', 'when', 'brother', 'was', 'killed', 'work', 'related', 'accident', 'Injured', 'equipment', 'working', 'Johnny', 'never', 'recovered', 'loss.His', 'music', 'saved', 'loneliness', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'sufficient', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'battled', 'addictions', 'adult', 'life.Johnny', 'was', 'man', 'man', 'did', 'many', 'visits', 'prisons', 'prisoners', 'could', 'relate', 'loved', 'music.In', 'early', '1950', 'Johnny', 'went', 'road', 'Elvis', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'recorded', 'Sun', 'records', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee.Later', 'Johnny', 'wanted', 'record', 'Gospel', 'Music', 'Sun', 'records', 'was', 'When', 'contract', 'expired', 'Columbia', 'was', 'new', 'recording', 'company', 'first', 'Gospel', 'albums', 'were', 'published', 'favorite', 'isThe', 'Gospel', 'Road', 'Story', 'Jesus', 'Told', 'Sung', 'Johnny', 'Cash', '2LP', 'Gatefold', 'Booklet', 'Cash', 'was', 'inducted', 'Country', 'Music', 'Hall', 'Fame', '1980', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', '1992', 'Two', 'years', 'death', '2001', 'received', 'National', 'Medal', 'Arts', 'artistic', 'excellence']",N/A

He showed the strength of character to come back from the lowest depths and be a help to others.  The movie also shows the need for people who care for others to take an active part in their lives.,5,"Much better movie than ""I Walk The Line""",1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,372,"['were', 'able', 'portray', 'life', 'so', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'went', 'showing', 'bad', 'parts', 'still', 'including', 'feelings', 'less', 'fortunate', 'showed', 'strength', 'character', 'come', 'back', 'lowest', 'depths', 'be', 'help', 'others', 'movie', 'also', 'need', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'others', 'take', 'active', 'part', 'lives']",N/A
