1104805,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000VWYJ6S,Grady Harp,"[23, 24]","VITUS is a film from Switzerland that has garnered many accolades and nearly won an Oscar.  And yes, it is that good!  Written by Fredi M. Murer, Peter Luisi, and Lukas B. Suter and directed by Murer, VITUS explores the life of a child genius, a lad who from the age of five is obviously gifted in that he can play Bach et al after only a few months lessons and is able to read books and understand concepts that make his stance in a regular kindergarten class untenable.  But the film is less about the gifts of a child prodigy than it is a story of how a genius child longs for a normal childhood.  It is in the telling of the story that the audience is privileged to discover the joys and trials in a child's view of being extraordinary.Vitus - played at age 6 by Fabrizio Borsani and at age 12 by Teo Gheorghiu - is referred to as a little Mozart by his parents Helen (Julika Jenkins) and Leo (Urs Jucker), and by the family friends who are amazed at Vitus' gift as a pianist.  But as is often the case with gifted children, they are overprotected, not allowed to engage in the normal activities of being a kid.  Vitus finds consolation in his grandfather (a brilliant Bruno Ganz) whose creative energy includes Vitus in his longing to fly and to build complex machines.  While Vitus continues his love for the piano he also takes risks with his beloved grandfather.  Vitus' intelligence serves him well in analyzing the complexities of his father's job and his grandfather's role in that position, and it is his genius that leads the family in a direction no one thought possible.  And of course with every story of an extraordinary young lad adapting to a puzzling world, there is also a love interest: Isabel at age 12 (Kristina Lykowa) is his fun-loving babysitter and at age 19 (Tamara Scarpellini) is the queen of his inexperienced heart and fill a void in Vitus' life that otherwise would be empty.  Fitting all of these subplots together is made magical by Vitus' constant playing of classical music - a feat the young actor is capable of performing on his own!The cast of this film is not only gifted but is also endearing.  Bruno Ganz is a brilliant actor and he is matched by both of the young actors who play Vitus.  The story is tender but avoids bathos. It simply is an uplifting, inspiring, entertaining film.

Vitus finds in his grandfather the creativeness, the irreverence and the breakthrough of any kind of rule or discipline. As a matter of fact his grandfather finds in its free time, an opportunity to innovate, his passion is to fly; on the other hand Vitus' father is a very smart designer and really surprises and even aims the company to get immersed into the financial market; his mother is aware about the unstoppable talent of his child and promotes him.Vitus' passion for the music is just a sample of his multiple skills. But gradually, he will be disposed to materialize the golden dream of his grandfather (thanks to a smart knockout as the nickname of Dr. Wulf , helping at the same his father of a secure bankrupt and returning him the place he deserved in the company.The affective life of this teenager is marvellously carved in relief through two lovable girls. The plot is like a surprises box, that never let you quiet. The film exudes that kind humanity and love for life that we usually are accustomed to watch in previous European films, (such Kolya, The 400 blows or Forbidden games  for instance)The great Bruno Ganz, despite his supporting role, is always welcome every time he appears, he is a real master of the acting, his infinite tenderness and legendary charisma have become one of these unreachable cult actors ( sharing honours with Hopkins, Armin Mller Stahl, Philipe Noiret , Jean Rochefort, Albert Finney  or Peter O ` Toole).On the other hand, both children, virtuosi of the piano are extremely expressive in their roles as well as the rest of the cast.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[0, 0]","First, I'm going to make a list of things I want to see in a movie:- Great acting- A solid marriage- Unpredictability- Relatable characters- Cute kids- Heartwarming plot- Wonderful music- Wise old folks- Fantastic success- Brilliant people doing audacious things- Fulfilled hopes and dreams- Beautiful horses- A happy endingThis wonderful Swiss/German film has everything but the horses!As a result of a rave review from one of you (in Nevada) on my JayFlix.net list, I checked this out of the library. The only actor with whom I am familiar is the great Bruno Ganz (""Bread and Tulips"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" - 2004). I have admired his work for many years. You wouldn't recognize any of the other names, so I won't waste your time. I will say that the little boy who portrays Vitus at age four is cuter than a button and the boy who portrays him later is a piano prot&eacute;g&eacute; in his own right!The story revolves around a young genius. You first meet him when he is four, already reading books and the newspaper. The boy has an IQ of 180, is a piano prot&eacute;g&eacute;, is a mathematical whiz and is deeply unhappy. All he really wants is to be ""normal."" His teachers resent being ridiculed and his classmates resent him for his obvious superiority. His only respite from his demanding life is time spent with his undemanding grandfather (Ganz) in his leaky old woodshop, making boomerangs and fantasizing about flying airplanes.His parents have a solid marriage and the boy is secure in their love, but he clearly sees how much his mother wants him to succeed with his music. His rebellions are par for the course, but also a little bit different from those of the average kid. His father is dealing with the ups and downs of the corporate world while his mother tries to keep the child focused on his piano. Neither parent pays much attention to the boy's other gifts or his frustrations.Things change after the boy falls from a balcony and suffers a head injury. The unpredictable twists and turns had me deeply involved every step of the way!

1104813,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000VWYJ6S,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 1]","""Vitus"" is a Swiss boy, a genius and prodigy at the piano, being propelled to a career as concert pianist by his demanding Swiss and English parents far ahead of his own ability to manage such a protocol. This extraordinary film traces this boy's life ascent from adolescent to dozen-year-old quasi-adult in less than two hours. What is most impressive is the film begins as driven parents pushing the child to adulthood that morphs into a satisfying family drama with fantasy ingredients that keep viewers of all ages involved in what is a very adult tale.As a classical music aficianado, I was drawn to this tale because of its msuical content. It doesn't disappoint in that regard with Vitus playing portions of Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto, Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg variations and a slice of Maurice Ravel's Alborada del Gracioso, among other piano pieces I recognized. The score also includes a snippet of Franz Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1.But this little movie transcends high art and the pain of growing into an artist to become a warm, humane and touching story about the most important things in life: love, family, wealth and poverty, success and failure, maturity, coming along and getting along, and growing up -- all through the actions of a six and 12-year-old genius living what seems like a lifetime in those six years.Vitus's ascent is abetted by a sympathetic grandfather that mentors the young boy, teaching him about life through his art and encouraging him to follow his dreams, whatever they may be. You'll be surprised what some of those dreams -- all realized -- turn out to be! One of them, a set of actions where the boy essentially saves his father's business, requires a bit of attention and will probably go over your kids' heads (and maybe yours.)Neither that nor anything else halts this from being a magnificent film for viewers of all ages and interests, its denouement leaving you as joyful and refreshed as the slow movement of a Mozart piano concerto on a spring morning. I encourage you to rent, buy, download or view ""Vitus"" any other way possible as soon as humanly possible.

It is a terrific family friendly film about a young prodigy (Vitus) who wants to grow up normal and his parents want him to use his incredible gifts and not waste them.  While his mother does come across sometimes as selfish in her desires, I imagine if we put ourselves in her shoes, we might struggle with the same tensions of how to let him grow up 'normal' and also not waste his gifts. Vitus then takes it upon himself to ensure that he will grow up 'normal'.  Through all this tension, he finds a friend in his grandfather who understands him and passes on his love of flying and woodworking, something his mother does not approve.  She goes ballistic one day when she sees Vitus learning how to use a saw because of what it could do to his fingers if he had an accident.

With an I.Q. so off-the-charts it's been classified as ""incalculable,""  Vitus is already such an accomplished pianist that he would give Mozart and Beethoven a run for their money in the musical genius sweepstakes.  Vitus' parents are justifiably proud of their son and understandably intent on affording him every opportunity possible for him to fulfill his rare, God-given potential.  But how is a boy supposed to have a ""normal childhood"" when he's eons ahead of his peers in intelligence and talent and when even his own teachers are intimidated by his knowledge?  Small wonder he's an arrogant, precocious little brat long before he's reached puberty (he's already planning on attending college at age 13).  Yet, at what point does a boy finally rebel against his ""specialness"" and seek the life of a ""normal"" child?  Well, in a shocking turn of events, Vitus comes up with a way of doing just that.""Vitus"" is a superb German film that vividly captures the stress and strain of having an adult brain essentially trapped inside a child's psyche.  But the movie also brings into focus the nonstop struggle the parents go through as they attempt to find a balance between nurturing and cultivating the child's talents, on the one hand, and not making a psychological wreck of him on the other.  And how much of their obsession with the child's gift really just comes down to the glory he reflects back on them as parents?  And whose dreams are they really trying to fulfill through his success anyway, his or their own?Brilliantly written by Peter Luisi, Lukas B. Suter and Fredi M.

Refusing to be controlled by his teachers, his mother and father or his peers, Vitus bonds with his eccentric grandfather who, being in his declining years, acts out a role as a living icon of humble wisdom and noble character for the impressionable young musical prodigy. As the story develops, we see that young Vitus is not just a musical genius, but has a mind capable of out thinking all the adults around him to create the kind of life he wants: which is to be 'normal' and not be treated special.

That doesn't mean he doesn't want to play the piano - actually he loves it - which makes the whole situation more complicated.""Vitus,"" helmed by Swiss veteran director Fredi M. Murer and starring actual 14-year-old pianist Teo Gheorghiu, effectively describes the life of precocious Vitus whose slightly deadpan face actually hides various emotions. The actors are unanimously good, Bruno Ganz in particular as Vitus' grandfather, who represents the wisdom only aged people can provide.Though the film starts brilliantly with and focuses mainly on Vitus' life as young gifted pianist, it also introduces a variety of his talents including stock market in the second half, which, I think is neither necessary nor credible. ""Vitus"" could have been better without some of its subplots, for example, one about his father's job in company, which only prolongs the second half, or romance with his babysitter.""Vitus"" covers the similar territory with ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" (another great film) where a chess prodigy has to make a tough decision to stay what he really is.
