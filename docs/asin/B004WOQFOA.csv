1430868,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B004WOQFOA,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[5, 5]","This is a brand new six part TV series which covers the workings of the Manchester Metropolitan Police in the UK, specifically the Major Incident Team. The main idea behind the series is the interaction between the two overworked female DCs, Rachel Bailey and Janet Scott who are quite different people but who complement each other to great effect. Although they are great friends, fairly regular disagreements are a feature of their relationship. Janet is a very steady, older character in her forties, whilst Rachel is younger and more impetuous and comes up with the inspirational ideas. We learn about the personal lives of the pair of them which adds interest and impacts on their work. This contrasts the series with the likes ofLaw & Order: UK - Series 1-4 [Region 2], where it is all strictly professional and we find out little about the individuals.In the first episode Rachel is seriously upset about being dumped by her married lover, Nick who continues to feature as the series progresses in an increasingly prominent role. Rachel's detection skills were obviously lacking as they had been going out for two years and it had escaped her notice that he was married with kids which seems a tad unlikely. Their first case seems to somewhat mirror Rachel's personal life as it involves a guy cheating on his wife whose girlfriend is found hanged. The various murders investigated by the pair have interesting twists. One involves a possible murder of her spouse by wife and boyfriend, just lacking a body whilst another concerns a serial killer whose activities go back as far as 40 years!All this makes for highly entertaining viewing. It is well acted by the two leads played by Lesley Sharp and Suranne Jones. However, their feisty boss, DI Gill Murray, played by Amelia Bullmore, also has a very key role in the series. The many fans of Scott and Bailey will be pleased to know that an additional series is already planned. You almost groan inwardly when yet another cop series hits the screen, but this one is sufficiently distinctive to make it well worth viewing. If you missed the TV series the DVD includes a short 'Behind the Scenes' bonus.",5,Entertaining New UK Police Series,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2160,"['brand', 'new', 'six', 'part', 'TV', 'series', 'workings', 'Manchester', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'UK', 'specifically', 'Major', 'Incident', 'Team', 'main', 'idea', 'series', 'interaction', 'two', 'overworked', 'female', 'DCs', 'Rachel', 'Bailey', 'Janet', 'Scott', 'who', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'complement', 'other', 'great', 'effect', 'are', 'great', 'friends', 'fairly', 'regular', 'disagreements', 'are', 'feature', 'relationship', 'Janet', 'very', 'steady', 'older', 'character', 'forties', 'whilst', 'Rachel', 'younger', 'more', 'impetuous', 'up', 'inspirational', 'ideas', 'learn', 'personal', 'lives', 'pair', 'interest', 'impacts', 'work', 'series', 'likes', 'ofLaw', 'Order', 'UK', '1-4', '[', 'Region', '2', ']', 'where', 'strictly', 'professional', 'find', 'out', 'little', 'individuals.In', 'first', 'episode', 'Rachel', 'seriously', 'upset', 'being', 'dumped', 'married', 'lover', 'Nick', 'who', 'feature', 'series', 'increasingly', 'prominent', 'role', 'Rachel', 'detection', 'skills', 'were', 'obviously', 'lacking', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'two', 'years', 'had', 'escaped', 'notice', 'was', 'married', 'kids', 'tad', 'unlikely', 'first', 'case', 'somewhat', 'mirror', 'Rachel', 'personal', 'life', 'guy', 'cheating', 'wife', 'girlfriend', 'found', 'hanged', 'various', 'murders', 'investigated', 'pair', 'have', 'interesting', 'twists', 'One', 'possible', 'murder', 'spouse', 'wife', 'boyfriend', 'just', 'lacking', 'body', 'concerns', 'serial', 'killer', 'activities', 'go', 'back', 'as', 'far', '40', 'years', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'viewing', 'well', 'acted', 'two', 'leads', 'played', 'Lesley', 'Sharp', 'Suranne', 'Jones', 'However', 'feisty', 'boss', 'DI', 'Gill', 'Murray', 'played', 'Amelia', 'Bullmore', 'also', 'very', 'key', 'role', 'series', 'many', 'fans', 'Scott', 'Bailey', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'know', 'additional', 'series', 'already', 'planned', 'almost', 'groan', 'inwardly', 'when', 'yet', 'cop', 'series', 'screen', 'one', 'sufficiently', 'distinctive', 'make', 'well', 'viewing', 'missed', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'short', 'Scenes', 'bonus']",Scott & Bailey: Season 1 Regions 2 & 4

Sharp has one of the best speaking voices in acting.  you could listen to her read the phone book.  thus, it is a marvel to see that voice used on bereaved families and suspects in interrogation as well as with potential witnesses.  her partner is a loose cannon.  she has incredible instincts for solving cases, the best in the whole department, but she is personally a complete mess. nowhere is this more evident than the all encompassing fallout from her affair with a married barrister, played by everyone's favorite villain in UK tv, rupert graves.  he is magnificent, as usual, as a complete cad, liar and all around scoundrel.this series is still going strong on uk tv so it proved to be a winning combination for continual renewals. i highly recommend it.",5,another great UK crime series,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,1085,"['i', 'became', 'Lesley', 'Sharp', 'fan', 'two', 'UK', 'series', 'AFTERLIFE', 'BOB', 'AND', 'ROSE', 'was', 'outstanding', 'pictured', 'blonde', 'cover', 'pic', 'shown', 'here', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'older', 'married', 'woman', 'partner', 'brunette', 'pictured', 'also', 'counterpart', 'two', 'make', 'effective', 'team', 'Sharp', 'one', 'best', 'speaking', 'voices', 'acting', 'could', 'listen', 'read', 'phone', 'book', 'thus', 'marvel', 'see', 'voice', 'used', 'bereaved', 'families', 'suspects', 'interrogation', 'as', 'well', 'potential', 'witnesses', 'partner', 'loose', 'cannon', 'incredible', 'instincts', 'solving', 'cases', 'best', 'whole', 'department', 'personally', 'complete', 'mess', 'nowhere', 'more', 'evident', 'encompassing', 'fallout', 'affair', 'married', 'barrister', 'played', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'villain', 'UK', 'tv', 'rupert', 'graves', 'magnificent', 'usual', 'complete', 'cad', 'liar', 'scoundrel.this', 'series', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'uk', 'tv', 'proved', 'be', 'winning', 'combination', 'continual', 'renewals', 'i', 'highly', 'recommend']",Scott & Bailey: Season 1 Regions 2 & 4

As a full blown &#34;Dirty Harry&#34;, &#34;The Shield&#34;, &#34;Kojak&#34;, 60 yr old Man, I'm not afraid to say this show, is GREAT! The 2 lead detectives are tough, funny, complicated, and brilliant and the match for brains of any of the male dominated shows I listed before (and still very much enjoy). Make a note here tho, you CANNOT watch this show on a US/Canada region 1 DVD player. You might be able to watch it on your computer, but better yet, invest $40 in a region free DVD player on Amazon like I did and a whole new world of shows from around the world will be available to you. In addition to a ton of great BBC shows you can't watch in the US unless you have a region free player, you also get access to shows from other countries in Europe that are fantastic and are often 'copied' by US producers (anyone ever heard of &#34;The Killing&#34; on AMC, originally done on Swedish TV?).

1430874,AVQ9T0BC4PCVS,B004WOQFOA,"Pangloss ""soldierblue""","[15, 15]","I just completed watching this series and am very impressed, both with the stories and the acting. The action centers around two detective constables, Janet Scott and Rachel Bailey. They work for the MIT, Major Incident Team and handle and array of vicious murders while dealing with their somewhat tumultuous personal lives. This series is more about police procedure than action and focuses on the characters rather than plot. Their boss, DCI Gill Murray is quite a character and is very well played by Amellia Bullmore. This is one of the better police dramas I have seen in quite awhile and I watch a lot of British police stories. This series is somewhat similar to a show that came out several years ago called ""Murder Investigation Team"" that also focused on two women detectives. Unfortunately it only lasted for two seasons. Let's hope this series lasts much longer.
