Unfortunately, the staging, which consists of a number of panels showing various Swiss type scenes with what looks like choir stalls in front of the panels, simply doesn't work. At best, it adds nothing; at worst it is a distraction. I would rate the singing 5 stars and the staging 2 stars.

818356,A2PYSU9GP1K3GN,B0001Z65O4,Angus W. Grant,"[3, 3]","This DVD is so cheap that is far preferable than owning (the no longer available) 4 CD set as released on Phillips. The slightly boxy acoustic that affects La Scala recordings is not such an issue when you have the visuals to assist. The quality of the musical performance then makes this an essential buy for any Rossini fan.The production is not entirely dreadful and the screen projections would have been far more impressive live than they are through your TV, but is extraordinarily stilted at times. Studer's acting is by far the hammiest and the duet's between her an Merrit could be out of a bad drag queen review. On the other hand how could you direct this monster of a show without putting lost of people on stage to stand and deliver? More work with the principals would have made a huge difference. The biggest issue is that the production is not emotionally involving (intentionally?). The music making demands respect but not affection.The music making is often very exciting and the singing of a high standard. It is not Zancanaro's finest effort. He is not as resonant as on other recordings (I wonder if the technicians had trouble balancing the dark voices with the cutting sound of Merrit and Studer) and he does not make Tell the most sympathetic of characters. In fact he seems somewhat disengaged from proceedings. However I would always walk over hot coals to hear him and there is, as always, much to love.Merritt's timbre is a hard, steely one but what luxury it is to have those high notes pop out one after the other as clean as a whistle. He is such a trooper and the emotional and physical effort he is clearly making overcomes any initial reservations I had. Another reason for watching rather than listening to this recording.I have never made up my mind about Studer in Italian repertoire and this doesn't help. One minute she is mooning about slightly out of pitch and the next she is popping out horrendously difficult passages with ease and a free, ringing tone.The orchestra and chorus are very fine and it is good to have so many shots of the action in he pit. I am very glad to have it in my possession.",3,Miss and Tell,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,2142,"['DVD', 'so', 'cheap', 'far', 'preferable', 'owning', 'no', 'longer', 'available', '4', 'CD', 'set', 'released', 'Phillips', 'slightly', 'boxy', 'acoustic', 'La', 'Scala', 'recordings', 'not', 'such', 'issue', 'when', 'have', 'visuals', 'assist', 'quality', 'musical', 'performance', 'then', 'essential', 'buy', 'Rossini', 'fan.The', 'production', 'not', 'entirely', 'dreadful', 'screen', 'projections', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'impressive', 'live', 'are', 'TV', 'extraordinarily', 'stilted', 'times', 'Studer', 'acting', 'far', 'hammiest', 'duet', 'Merrit', 'could', 'be', 'bad', 'drag', 'queen', 'review', 'other', 'hand', 'how', 'could', 'direct', 'monster', 'show', 'putting', 'lost', 'people', 'stage', 'stand', 'deliver', 'More', 'work', 'principals', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'huge', 'difference', 'biggest', 'issue', 'production', 'not', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'intentionally', 'music', 'making', 'demands', 'respect', 'not', 'affection.The', 'music', 'making', 'often', 'very', 'exciting', 'singing', 'high', 'standard', 'not', 'Zancanaro', 'finest', 'effort', 'not', 'as', 'resonant', 'other', 'recordings', 'wonder', 'technicians', 'had', 'trouble', 'balancing', 'dark', 'voices', 'cutting', 'sound', 'Merrit', 'Studer', 'not', 'make', 'Tell', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'fact', 'somewhat', 'disengaged', 'proceedings', 'However', 'would', 'always', 'walk', 'hot', 'coals', 'hear', 'always', 'much', 'love.Merritt', 'timbre', 'hard', 'steely', 'one', 'what', 'luxury', 'have', 'high', 'notes', 'pop', 'out', 'one', 'other', 'as', 'clean', 'whistle', 'such', 'trooper', 'emotional', 'physical', 'effort', 'clearly', 'making', 'overcomes', 'initial', 'reservations', 'had', 'reason', 'watching', 'rather', 'listening', 'recording.I', 'have', 'never', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'Studer', 'Italian', 'repertoire', ""n't"", 'help', 'One', 'minute', 'mooning', 'about', 'slightly', 'pitch', 'next', 'popping', 'out', 'horrendously', 'difficult', 'passages', 'ease', 'free', 'ringing', 'tone.The', 'orchestra', 'chorus', 'are', 'very', 'fine', 'good', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'shots', 'action', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'have', 'possession']",N/A

I have no other DVD version, so can make no comparisons, but the Singers and Orchestra with Muti at the helm, made it splendid entertainment. This was truly a fine night of music. As to the production, partly it is a matter of what I prefer, partly a weakness in the drama itself as presented (whether or not it is in the original, preserved, or was the design of the group at La Scala). On the first point, to me a good deal of dramatic tension was obviated by the decision to go with a jury box scenic design relying upon movie screens to create the appropriate atmosphere. I don't think it worked at all in the first act, in the second and fourth act it was somewhat less disturbing, and in the third, one of the most famous moments in theater, the apple on the child's head scene, it was little in evidence. The costumes were, presumably, a compromise between going authentic and going contemporary. In most cases they added little but detracted not much. As to dramatic flaws, apart from scenic design, which is a matter of preference, unfortunately they drained the drama from all but that arising from the music and singing itself. I felt pretty much as I would have watching a concert version of the  musical. In the first act, we had little more than a concert, in the second, somewhat more dramatic but no more than would have been created on the concert stage by the key singers turning toward each other when doing their solo's or duet's. The act is stagnant in action so little was lost. The third act, the key scene, with much splendid song and potential drama, was lost the minute William walks nonchalantly into the middle of the Tyrants celebration of his tyranny, with his son at his side, saying essentially, here I am bub, ready for a showdown. Whoosh went all the potential tension of the scene. One can hardly blame William (Zancanaro) from being wooden. Why on earth was he there. Regardless of the original, one is putting on a drama with music and should make the most of the potential in a scene. The fourth act was pretty much like an old vaudeville drama as seen in 1930's and 1940's movies. Poor William, once more, steering his make-believe made to look make-believe boat onto shore in the midst of gigantic waves and roaring storm shown on the big screen behind him is flat as flat can be. Oh, yes, it was Rossini or some other non-French composer, who on  writing a friend, mentioned that he was re- writing one of the acts of his highly successful opera to allow for a ballet because the Parisian audience expected it. I liked the ballet, lithe figures, delightful movements, and totally deadly for the drama.Yet, I recommend this DVD highly, in the apparent absence, at the moment, of viable competitive recorded performances. As I said, whatever the changes which  could be made to improve this version, it is still exciting, primarily due to Rossini, but also to the help he received from Muti and his orchestra, plus Chris Merritt and Cheryl Studer, particularly, but all the other singers as well. This was a 1988 performance but, with my less than super entertainment center equipment, it looked and sounded quite good.",5,"Master Rossini, Fine Orchestra and Singing",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,3215,"['Rossini', 'simply', 'overwhelmed', 'flawed', 'production', 'have', 'other', 'DVD', 'version', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'comparisons', 'Singers', 'Orchestra', 'Muti', 'helm', 'made', 'splendid', 'entertainment', 'was', 'truly', 'fine', 'night', 'music', 'production', 'partly', 'matter', 'what', 'prefer', 'partly', 'weakness', 'drama', 'presented', 'not', 'original', 'preserved', 'was', 'design', 'group', 'La', 'Scala', 'first', 'point', 'good', 'deal', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'was', 'obviated', 'decision', 'go', 'jury', 'box', 'scenic', 'design', 'relying', 'movie', 'screens', 'create', 'appropriate', 'atmosphere', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'first', 'act', 'second', 'fourth', 'act', 'was', 'somewhat', 'less', 'disturbing', 'third', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'moments', 'theater', 'apple', 'child', 'head', 'scene', 'was', 'little', 'evidence', 'costumes', 'were', 'presumably', 'compromise', 'going', 'authentic', 'going', 'contemporary', 'most', 'cases', 'added', 'little', 'detracted', 'not', 'much', 'dramatic', 'flaws', 'apart', 'scenic', 'design', 'matter', 'preference', 'unfortunately', 'drained', 'drama', 'arising', 'music', 'singing', 'felt', 'pretty', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'watching', 'concert', 'version', 'musical', 'first', 'act', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'concert', 'second', 'somewhat', 'more', 'dramatic', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'concert', 'stage', 'key', 'singers', 'turning', 'other', 'when', 'doing', 'solo', 'duet', 'act', 'stagnant', 'action', 'so', 'little', 'was', 'lost', 'third', 'act', 'key', 'scene', 'much', 'splendid', 'song', 'potential', 'drama', 'was', 'lost', 'minute', 'William', 'nonchalantly', 'middle', 'Tyrants', 'celebration', 'tyranny', 'son', 'side', 'saying', 'essentially', 'here', 'am', 'bub', 'ready', 'showdown', 'Whoosh', 'went', 'potential', 'tension', 'scene', 'One', 'can', 'hardly', 'blame', 'William', 'Zancanaro', 'being', 'wooden', 'Why', 'earth', 'was', 'there', 'Regardless', 'original', 'one', 'putting', 'drama', 'music', 'should', 'make', 'most', 'potential', 'scene', 'fourth', 'act', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'old', 'vaudeville', 'drama', 'seen', '1930', '1940', 'movies', 'Poor', 'William', 'once', 'more', 'steering', 'make-believe', 'made', 'look', 'make-believe', 'boat', 'shore', 'midst', 'gigantic', 'waves', 'roaring', 'storm', 'shown', 'big', 'screen', 'flat', 'flat', 'can', 'be', 'Oh', 'yes', 'was', 'Rossini', 'other', 'non-French', 'composer', 'who', 'writing', 'friend', 'mentioned', 'was', 're-', 'writing', 'one', 'acts', 'highly', 'successful', 'opera', 'allow', 'ballet', 'Parisian', 'audience', 'expected', 'liked', 'ballet', 'lithe', 'figures', 'delightful', 'movements', 'totally', 'deadly', 'drama.Yet', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'highly', 'apparent', 'absence', 'moment', 'viable', 'competitive', 'recorded', 'performances', 'said', 'whatever', 'changes', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'improve', 'version', 'still', 'exciting', 'primarily', 'due', 'Rossini', 'also', 'help', 'received', 'Muti', 'orchestra', 'Chris', 'Merritt', 'Cheryl', 'Studer', 'particularly', 'other', 'singers', 'well', 'was', '1988', 'performance', 'less', 'super', 'entertainment', 'center', 'equipment', 'looked', 'sounded', 'quite', 'good']",N/A

This 2 DVD set is from the original RAI television production and the visuals are quite sharp, the sound lifelike. The stage setting itself features a singing area up front that is rather generic but allows for credible movement of the chorus and principals. The background is made of up of three huge projections of appropriately selected video scenes from the Swiss countryside, primarily of forest and mountain views, and although it is occasionally distracting, it is spectacular scenery and contributes to the sylvan mood of the opera.The direction by Riccardo Muti is characteristically top-notch. He is clearly a conductor for whom the Rossini score means a great deal. The Scala orchestra, which appears larger than usual in this production, is very fine. (The famous overture is played brilliantly.) The principals, Americans Cheryl Studer as Matilde and Chris Merritt as Arnoldo, the romantic leads, are world-class. Studer later had vocal troubles, but at the time of this production she sounded to be in good vocal health. Merritt, then at the height of his fame as a Rossini tenor, is thrilling. The other principals include a believably heroic and sonorous Giorgio Zancanaro as William Tell, Luigi Roni as Gessler, the villain, Giorgio Surjan as Gualtiero, and a too-young but vocally effective Franco de Grandis as Melchtal, Arnoldo's father. Tell's two children, Jemmy and Edwige are nicely done by Amelia Felle and Ludicana D'Intino. Ballet sequences are appropriately rustic and the sparkling dancing of prima ballerina Carla Fracci is a real delight.It is wonderful to have the uncut 'Guglielmo Tell,' but it is hard to sit through the whole almost four hours without a break. I broke it up into two evenings' viewing, two acts each evening. There are no extras with the DVD except for English subtitles (which is the default setting).
