She also modifies some reformer moves by using the band.  And wow does this DVD ever work out your lower half!  I didn't get quite the workout for my abs I was hoping for but it still got the job done.  Also modifications for lower intensity were offered which were great when I was just starting to use this DVD...thanks for having that in there.  I would strongly recommend adding the DVD to anyone's home workout routine.,4,Awesome workout!!,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,547,"['use', 'band', 'DVD', 'really', 'workout', 'really', 'monotony', 'basic', 'moves', 'also', 'reformer', 'moves', 'using', 'band', 'wow', 'DVD', 'ever', 'work', 'out', 'lower', 'half', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'quite', 'workout', 'abs', 'was', 'hoping', 'still', 'got', 'job', 'done', 'Also', 'modifications', 'lower', 'intensity', 'were', 'offered', 'were', 'great', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'use', 'DVD', 'thanks', 'having', 'there', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'adding', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'home', 'workout', 'routine']",N/A

I was very disappointed by this video.  Let me start off by saying that for the last 4 months I have been working out 4-5 times per week with Jackie Warner's Workout video, which is pretty intense.  Having said that, perhaps my muscles are really toned and built up already.  But I did not feel ANYTHING with this DVD.  I mean, nothing at all.  The ""band"" that comes with it is ridiculous.  It added no tension at all to the workout for me, in fact it just got in the way.  I used to do the Winsor Pilates on a pretty regular basis a few years ago, so I am familiar with Pilates, although to be honest, I've never gotten very toned from it.  I feel like I need weights and squats and lunges to be toned...which I hate!!!  But seriously...I felt absolutely nothing at all doing this exercise.  It was really surprising to me!  And the instructor's voice is very annoying.  I'm disappointed it didn't work out, because I was really looking forward to it.

1095287,A1VWAY5MMOAEDV,B000UL613E,"Saundra Johnson ""insane lesane""","[2, 2]","I love this DVD.  The one thing I realized while doing this routine is that you must make sure your abs are engaged and everything is controlled.  If that is done, I can see how the abs, butt and thighs are all being worked.  I know I felt it all over just from keeping proper form while performing the exercises.  I also noticed that this routine has the strength, flexibility, toning and stretching elements all wrapped up into one workout so you feel worked out and relaxed also.  I highly recommend this DVD.",5,You will definitely feel this,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,512,"['love', 'DVD', 'one', 'thing', 'realized', 'doing', 'routine', 'must', 'make', 'sure', 'abs', 'are', 'engaged', 'everything', 'controlled', 'done', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'abs', 'butt', 'thighs', 'are', 'being', 'worked', 'know', 'felt', 'over', 'just', 'keeping', 'proper', 'form', 'performing', 'exercises', 'also', 'noticed', 'routine', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'toning', 'stretching', 'elements', 'wrapped', 'up', 'one', 'workout', 'feel', 'worked', 'out', 'relaxed', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A

In this dvd there were a few moves I was not familar with and I felt I would of been able to preform those moves better with a clear explation how to before doing the exercise. I can't tell for sure if these moves made me sore because I was already sore from another workout. But I did feel a burn during the laying leg work. I felt there were some good basic core moves and some good leg exercises but there could of been more reps. There was no cool down and stretching segment so be prepared to go it alone.  The dvd was good but not great. If there were concise instructions and/or demonstrations I would of given it a better review. I am going to continue to use this on my strength training days but for toning alone I don't feel this is strong enough.,3,Good but room for improvement,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,845,"['am', 'not', 'new', 'pilates', 'love', 'pilates', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'book', 'dvd', 'were', 'few', 'moves', 'was', 'not', 'familar', 'felt', 'would', 'been', 'able', 'preform', 'moves', 'better', 'clear', 'explation', 'how', 'doing', 'exercise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'sure', 'moves', 'made', 'sore', 'was', 'already', 'sore', 'workout', 'did', 'feel', 'burn', 'laying', 'leg', 'work', 'felt', 'were', 'good', 'basic', 'core', 'moves', 'good', 'leg', 'exercises', 'could', 'been', 'more', 'reps', 'was', 'cool', 'down', 'stretching', 'segment', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'go', 'alone', 'dvd', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'were', 'concise', 'instructions', 'and/or', 'demonstrations', 'would', 'given', 'better', 'review', 'am', 'going', 'continue', 'use', 'strength', 'training', 'days', 'toning', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'strong', 'enough']",N/A
