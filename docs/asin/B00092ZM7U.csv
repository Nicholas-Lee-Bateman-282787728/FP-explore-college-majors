900533,A1VRVLZG5SQMDI,B00092ZM7U,Alex S,"[0, 0]","I first considered buying this DVD set when it was Amazon's ""TV Deal of the Week"" several weeks ago; I did not do so based ONLY on what I now consider WTF reviews that asserted that the set placed the episodes in a bad order and did not include both parts of the two-part episode entitled ""Rush and Pledge"" and ""Hell Week.""My tremendous love for this Judd Apatow show, which was a hilarious follow-up to the equally brilliant ""Freaks and Geeks,"" and my cynicism regarding claims that Shout Factory deviated from its exceptional track record regarding DVD sets that celebrate what makes the released shows noteworthy prompted getting a set a few weeks after the sale.I will disclose that my ""Undeclared"" set seems to be the standard version that Amazon was selling. All the bonus feature information seems to coincide, and nothing about my set indicates that it was a limited edition.The set does include Shout Factory's fairly standard wonderful booklet with good episode information, great essays, and very funny cast memories of individual episodes.The second disclosure is that I have not watched any episodes from the set but have watched the show recently, and it is as hilarious and relevant as I remember.Consistent with ""Undeclared,"" my memories of my freshman year at college include the stereotypical former hippie poli sci professor who insisted that we call him Larry and virtually everyone on my residence hall floor barging in on a fellow freshman while he was pleasuring himself. This classmate had red hair, and I recall his face becoming the same color as his hair. The ""Facts of Life"" girls and ""Happy Days"" boys never had college experiences like those.Turning to the inaccurate information in other reviews, the episode list in both the booklet and the DVD cases is EXACTLY the same as the viewing order that a review recommended. It is also consistent with the little bit that I watched on the discs.I popped in two DVDs long enough to verify that the set includes both ""Rush and Pledge"" and ""Hell Week."" My only negative remark regarding this is that Shout Factory placed ""Pledge"" on the second disc and ""Hell Week"" on the third. This is a minor ""flaw.""Additionally, some reviews accurately state that the DVD includes the unaired episode ""Full Bluntal Nugety."" I do not think that I have even seen that one in ""Undeclared's"" very limited syndicated run.I do not recall other reviews mentioning that the set includes a second unaired episode entitled ""God Visits."" Any 17-episode show that has two episodes that raised flags at Fox of all networks earns an A from me based on that alone.The bottom line is that my experience with my set is totally contrary to the negative points that I addressed.",5,Awesome Show; Criticism of DVD Set Seeming Unwarranted,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,2719,"['first', 'considered', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'when', 'was', 'Amazon', 'TV', 'Deal', 'Week', 'several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'based', 'ONLY', 'what', 'now', 'consider', 'WTF', 'asserted', 'set', 'placed', 'episodes', 'bad', 'order', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'parts', 'two-part', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Rush', 'Pledge', 'Hell', 'Week', 'tremendous', 'love', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'show', 'was', 'hilarious', 'follow-up', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'cynicism', 'regarding', 'claims', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'deviated', 'exceptional', 'track', 'record', 'regarding', 'DVD', 'sets', 'celebrate', 'released', 'shows', 'noteworthy', 'prompted', 'getting', 'set', 'few', 'weeks', 'sale.I', 'will', 'disclose', 'Undeclared', 'set', 'be', 'standard', 'version', 'Amazon', 'was', 'selling', 'bonus', 'feature', 'information', 'coincide', 'nothing', 'set', 'was', 'limited', 'edition.The', 'set', 'include', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'fairly', 'standard', 'wonderful', 'booklet', 'good', 'episode', 'information', 'great', 'essays', 'very', 'funny', 'cast', 'memories', 'individual', 'episodes.The', 'second', 'disclosure', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'episodes', 'set', 'have', 'watched', 'show', 'recently', 'hilarious', 'relevant', 'remember.Consistent', 'Undeclared', 'memories', 'freshman', 'year', 'college', 'include', 'stereotypical', 'former', 'hippie', 'poli', 'sci', 'professor', 'who', 'insisted', 'call', 'Larry', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'residence', 'hall', 'floor', 'barging', 'fellow', 'freshman', 'was', 'pleasuring', 'classmate', 'had', 'red', 'hair', 'recall', 'face', 'becoming', 'same', 'color', 'hair', 'Facts', 'Life', 'girls', 'Happy', 'Days', 'never', 'had', 'college', 'experiences', 'those.Turning', 'inaccurate', 'information', 'other', 'reviews', 'episode', 'list', 'booklet', 'DVD', 'cases', 'EXACTLY', 'same', 'viewing', 'order', 'review', 'recommended', 'also', 'consistent', 'little', 'bit', 'watched', 'discs.I', 'popped', 'two', 'DVDs', 'long', 'enough', 'verify', 'set', 'Rush', 'Pledge', 'Hell', 'Week', 'only', 'negative', 'remark', 'regarding', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'placed', 'Pledge', 'second', 'disc', 'Hell', 'Week', 'third', 'minor', 'flaw', 'Additionally', 'reviews', 'accurately', 'state', 'DVD', 'unaired', 'episode', 'Full', 'Bluntal', 'Nugety', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'have', 'even', 'seen', 'one', 'Undeclared', 'very', 'limited', 'syndicated', 'run.I', 'do', 'not', 'recall', 'other', 'reviews', 'mentioning', 'set', 'second', 'unaired', 'episode', 'entitled', 'God', 'Visits', '17-episode', 'show', 'two', 'episodes', 'raised', 'flags', 'Fox', 'networks', 'A', 'based', 'alone.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'experience', 'set', 'totally', 'contrary', 'negative', 'points', 'addressed']",N/A
900534,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00092ZM7U,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[37, 47]","First off, I have to credit this show for its accuracy.  I finished my freshmen year of college a few months ago, and I have to say that many of the things that happened in this show either happened to me or someone I knew.  The writers must have really done their homework for this show (or didn't do a lot of homework in college and instead lived out these episodes), and the result is a pitch-perfect and hilarious look at college life.The show is centered around the undeclared Steven Karp (Jay Baruchel), a tall and thin kid (who is actually built very similarly to myself) who was a bit of a geek in high school.  He says the word wicked a lot, has a tendency to talk with his hands, and looks uncomfortable in any situation.  He lives in a suite style dorm, so he has a roommate, a private lounge, and two other people he shares the lounge with.  Lloyd Haythe (Charlie Hunnam), his roommate, is a British pretty boy who is a theater major.  In the room on the other side of the lounge lives spacey music major Marshall Nesbitt (Timm Sharp) and calculating Ron Garner (Seth Rogen).  The four guys become fast friends, yet they never pass up an opportunity to make fun of each other.  Across the hall lives their female companions, Lizzie Exley (Carla Gallo), Rachel Lindquist (Monica Keena), and later Tina Ellroy (Christina Payono).  Lizzie is a somewhat hyperactive girl who always tends to have the upper hand in relationships (her boyfriend Eric, played by Jason Segel, is always afraid that she will dump him, even though he's older than her by at least 10 years).  Rachel, on the other hand, is more subdued.  She is prone to anxiety attacks from being away from home, and she lets it all out by going a little nuts at parties.  Tina, who joins the group later, is a bit of a loser, but she doesn't know it.  She likes to listen to old songs on an endless loop and is ""holding out"" for Lloyd.  Finally, Steven's dad Hal Karp (Louden Wainwright) is a recently divorced wreck who always seems to end up looking cooler than his son.  Lloyd even invites Hal to party with them from time to time.The side characters are also great.  Perry (Jarrett Grode) is sort of the jack-of-all-trades in the dorm, and he really knows how to rub it in.  Books (Samm Levine) is a vindictive frat president who takes out his rage on Steven and his fellow pledges, Lucien (Kevin Rankin) is the floor's goofy RA, Hilary (Amy Poehler) is the head RA who isn't quite right, and Eric is a lovable loser who just can't seem to get things to go his way.The stories and jokes are hilarious.  I especially liked the fraternity episodes.  I didn't rush, but I remember going to frat parties, and all of the brothers were really nice to me and wanted me to pledge.  However, I heard awful things about hell week.  In the episodes, Steven decides to pledge, and is in for a surprise when Books pulls a Jeckyll and Hyde on him.  In another episode, Marshall hooks up with a Japanese girl named Kikuki (Youki Kudoh) who doesn't speak any English.  The two have to communicate using a pair of English/Japanese translaters.  Finally, the guys actually write a detailed script in order to ""spontaneously"" start a game of truth or dare with the girls.One of the most innovative and original things about Undeclared is the way the characters were written.  Unlike every other show, the characters were not written at all before the actors were cast, and the pilot episode was only partially completed prior to casting.  While they always knew that they wanted someone to be a Steven-esque character, no other character was planned.  Then, they hired the actors who, among other things, were good at improv, and wrote the characters around the actors.Improv was a big part of this show.  There were solid scripts, but the actors were pretty much allowed to make up their own lines as they went along, provided they followed the overarching story.  In the extensive extras section, we can watch some of the rehersal footage and see the different lines that were thought up.We are treated to plenty of extras in this set.  Each episode has a commentary track and unaired footage.  There is a director's cut of one episode, a panel discussion with the cast, a script, and a booklet with essays from creator Judd Apatow and actor Jay Baruchel.It's too bad that this show was cancelled so quickly.  Time Magazine named it one of the Top 10 New Shows of 2001, and with good reason.  Sadly, the show was on FOX, the network that unjustly cancelled Firefly, Wonderfalls, Tru Calling, Greg the Bunny, Andy Richter Controls the Universe and so on.  Now that Apatow is making movies, maybe we will get a big-screen version, but it is unlikely.  Anyway, enjoy these 18 episodes from a lost TV gem.",5,My College Experience,1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,4757,"['First', 'have', 'credit', 'show', 'accuracy', 'finished', 'freshmen', 'year', 'college', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'have', 'say', 'many', 'things', 'happened', 'show', 'either', 'happened', 'someone', 'knew', 'writers', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'done', 'homework', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'lot', 'homework', 'college', 'instead', 'lived', 'out', 'episodes', 'result', 'pitch-perfect', 'hilarious', 'look', 'college', 'life.The', 'show', 'centered', 'undeclared', 'Steven', 'Karp', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'tall', 'thin', 'kid', 'who', 'actually', 'built', 'very', 'similarly', 'who', 'was', 'bit', 'geek', 'high', 'school', 'word', 'wicked', 'lot', 'tendency', 'talk', 'hands', 'uncomfortable', 'situation', 'suite', 'style', 'dorm', 'roommate', 'private', 'lounge', 'two', 'other', 'people', 'shares', 'lounge', 'Lloyd', 'Haythe', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'roommate', 'British', 'pretty', 'boy', 'who', 'theater', 'major', 'room', 'other', 'side', 'lounge', 'spacey', 'music', 'major', 'Marshall', 'Nesbitt', 'Timm', 'Sharp', 'calculating', 'Ron', 'Garner', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'four', 'guys', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', 'yet', 'never', 'pass', 'up', 'opportunity', 'make', 'fun', 'other', 'hall', 'female', 'companions', 'Lizzie', 'Exley', 'Carla', 'Gallo', 'Rachel', 'Lindquist', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'later', 'Tina', 'Ellroy', 'Christina', 'Payono', 'Lizzie', 'somewhat', 'hyperactive', 'girl', 'who', 'always', 'have', 'upper', 'hand', 'relationships', 'boyfriend', 'Eric', 'played', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'always', 'afraid', 'will', 'dump', 'even', 'older', 'least', '10', 'years', 'Rachel', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'subdued', 'prone', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'being', 'away', 'home', 'out', 'going', 'little', 'nuts', 'parties', 'Tina', 'who', 'group', 'later', 'bit', 'loser', ""n't"", 'know', 'listen', 'old', 'songs', 'endless', 'loop', 'holding', 'out', 'Lloyd', 'Finally', 'Steven', 'dad', 'Hal', 'Karp', 'Louden', 'Wainwright', 'recently', 'divorced', 'wreck', 'who', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'cooler', 'son', 'Lloyd', 'even', 'Hal', 'party', 'time', 'time.The', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'Perry', 'Jarrett', 'Grode', 'sort', 'jack-of-all-trades', 'dorm', 'really', 'how', 'rub', 'Books', 'Samm', 'Levine', 'vindictive', 'frat', 'president', 'who', 'out', 'rage', 'Steven', 'fellow', 'pledges', 'Lucien', 'Kevin', 'Rankin', 'floor', 'goofy', 'RA', 'Hilary', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'head', 'RA', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'Eric', 'lovable', 'loser', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'things', 'go', 'way.The', 'stories', 'jokes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'liked', 'fraternity', 'did', ""n't"", 'rush', 'remember', 'going', 'frat', 'parties', 'brothers', 'were', 'really', 'nice', 'wanted', 'pledge', 'However', 'heard', 'awful', 'things', 'hell', 'week', 'episodes', 'Steven', 'pledge', 'surprise', 'when', 'Books', 'Jeckyll', 'Hyde', 'episode', 'Marshall', 'up', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'named', 'Kikuki', 'Youki', 'Kudoh', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'two', 'have', 'communicate', 'using', 'pair', 'English/Japanese', 'translaters', 'Finally', 'guys', 'actually', 'write', 'detailed', 'script', 'order', 'spontaneously', 'start', 'game', 'truth', 'dare', 'girls.One', 'most', 'innovative', 'original', 'things', 'Undeclared', 'way', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'other', 'show', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'written', 'actors', 'were', 'cast', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'only', 'partially', 'completed', 'prior', 'casting', 'always', 'knew', 'wanted', 'someone', 'be', 'Steven-esque', 'character', 'other', 'character', 'was', 'planned', 'Then', 'hired', 'actors', 'who', 'other', 'things', 'were', 'good', 'improv', 'wrote', 'characters', 'actors.Improv', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'show', 'were', 'solid', 'scripts', 'actors', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'allowed', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'lines', 'went', 'along', 'provided', 'followed', 'overarching', 'story', 'extensive', 'extras', 'section', 'can', 'watch', 'rehersal', 'footage', 'see', 'different', 'lines', 'were', 'thought', 'up.We', 'are', 'treated', 'plenty', 'extras', 'set', 'episode', 'commentary', 'track', 'unaired', 'footage', 'director', 'cut', 'one', 'episode', 'panel', 'discussion', 'cast', 'script', 'booklet', 'essays', 'creator', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'actor', 'Jay', 'Baruchel.It', 'too', 'bad', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'so', 'quickly', 'Time', 'Magazine', 'named', 'one', 'Top', '10', 'New', 'Shows', '2001', 'good', 'reason', 'Sadly', 'show', 'was', 'FOX', 'network', 'unjustly', 'cancelled', 'Firefly', 'Wonderfalls', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'Greg', 'Bunny', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'Controls', 'Universe', 'so', 'Now', 'Apatow', 'making', 'movies', 'maybe', 'will', 'get', 'big-screen', 'version', 'unlikely', 'Anyway', 'enjoy', '18', 'episodes', 'lost', 'TV', 'gem']",N/A
900535,A3SJ2VSCHZB18,B00092ZM7U,Brian Markowski,"[5, 6]","I remember when Bill Cosby was promoting his then new show ""A Different World"". He said that this would be about what college is ""really"" like, kids waiting to the last minute to write their papers, all nighters, bad roommates...you get the picture. So it was an ultimate disappointment to discover that ""A Different World"" would be nothing more than a semi-romantic comedy about Whitney and  Dwayne Wayne. In fact the show would not have even survived it's first season had it not been sandwiched in between ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Cheers"". What ever became of it's real world  college stories is a mystery, that is until ""Undeclared"" stumbled across them and finally put them on air.Steven Karp, a freshman at a state university in California enters the world of dorms, no money, room parties, frats, and of course college academics. In this tragically short 16 episode series that ran on FOX back in 2001, Steven leaves home for the first time only to discover that his home is right behind him in the form of his Dad who can't seem to let his son go. Steven encounters love, ex-boyfriends, psyho R.A.s, and a really crummy school cafeteria job.Judd Apatow, the creator of ""Freaks and Geeks"" also produced ""Undeclared"". The relationship between the two shows is uncanny, most actors from ""Freaks"" make their way on to the set of ""Undeclared"" and though the writing is a little uneven at first, the series does get it's momentum going and ends it's run as a shinning companion to""Freaks and Geeks"". The DVD is packed with commentary, audition tapes, a ton of extra material that's actually fun to watch and some nifty stuff like a cast and crew Q&A.; So enjoy your 100+ shows of ""A Different World"", a show that could have been so much more, while I hug to death my 16 episodes of ""Undeclared"", a show that was everything I wanted it to be.",5,"TV Finally Gets College Life Right, Then Promptly Cancles It",1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,1840,"['remember', 'when', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'was', 'promoting', 'then', 'new', 'show', 'Different', 'World', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'college', 'really', 'kids', 'waiting', 'last', 'minute', 'write', 'papers', 'nighters', 'bad', 'roommates', 'get', 'picture', 'was', 'ultimate', 'disappointment', 'discover', 'Different', 'World', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'semi-romantic', 'comedy', 'Whitney', 'Dwayne', 'Wayne', 'fact', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'survived', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'sandwiched', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Cheers', 'What', 'ever', 'became', 'real', 'world', 'college', 'stories', 'mystery', 'Undeclared', 'stumbled', 'finally', 'put', 'air.Steven', 'Karp', 'freshman', 'state', 'university', 'California', 'enters', 'world', 'dorms', 'money', 'room', 'parties', 'frats', 'course', 'college', 'academics', 'tragically', 'short', '16', 'episode', 'series', 'ran', 'FOX', 'back', '2001', 'Steven', 'home', 'first', 'time', 'only', 'discover', 'home', 'right', 'form', 'Dad', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'let', 'son', 'go', 'Steven', 'love', 'ex-boyfriends', 'psyho', 'R.A.s', 'really', 'crummy', 'school', 'cafeteria', 'job.Judd', 'Apatow', 'creator', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'also', 'produced', 'Undeclared', 'relationship', 'two', 'shows', 'uncanny', 'most', 'actors', 'Freaks', 'make', 'way', 'set', 'Undeclared', 'writing', 'little', 'uneven', 'first', 'series', 'get', 'momentum', 'going', 'run', 'shinning', 'companion', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'DVD', 'packed', 'commentary', 'audition', 'tapes', 'ton', 'extra', 'material', 'actually', 'fun', 'watch', 'nifty', 'stuff', 'cast', 'crew', 'Q', 'A', 'enjoy', '100+', 'shows', 'A', 'Different', 'World', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'hug', 'death', '16', 'episodes', 'Undeclared', 'show', 'was', 'everything', 'wanted', 'be']",N/A

And it's too bad, because this show really gave a great look at college life.The show centered around Steven Karp (Jay Baruchel) the typical, nervous freshman, looking to reinvent himself in college, and trying to figure out just who he wanted to be. Baruchel is absolutely perfect in this role. His skinny frame helps his appearance of nervousness and apprehension at every new experience he finds in college. I find myself thinking about people I knew in college, and even of myself a little, and seeing pieces of that in Steven. This was a truly great piece of casting.Carla Gallo plays Lizzie Exley, the girl of Steven's dreams who happens to live across the hall. While Lizzie is a little more outgoing than Steven, she also is encountering a number of the same problems Steven faces as she enters college. Her biggest issue is her boyfriend, played to perfection by guest star Jason Segel. His jealousness over her friendship and eventual relationship with Steven is a great plot line, one that helps the show stay not only on the college campus, but off it as well.Monica Keena, who earned distinction as being the first character killed off on Dawson's Creek (Abby Morgan) plays Lizzie's roomate Rachel, the girl who knows she's attractive and uses it to her advantage. Yet at the same time, she can also be the girl next door, much as Lizzie is.Steven's roomates Lloyd (Charlie Hunnam), Ron (Seth Rogen) and Marshall (Timm Sharp) are truly an eclectic bunch. Lloyd is the charming ladies' man from England, who has absolutely no problems finding ladies. Ron is the resident prankster, often teaming with the others to pick on Steven (in a friendly way). Marshall is the lonely guy, looking for a girl, but really only seeing one, Rachel. The four roomates work very well off each other, each bringing something different to the table.Christina Payano stars for part of the season as Tina, Lizzie and Rachel''s other roommate. Her character doesn't get a lot of time to develop, as the cancellation stopped any hope for season two.Legendary folk singer Loudon Wainwright plays Steven's dad, Hal, who breaks the news of his divorce on his son soon after he moves into college. Hal moves close by and eventually starts taking classes on campus, and at one point, even dates one of the RAs in Steven's dorm. He is a constant source of embarrasment for Steven, but at the same time, he is encouraging and supportive of his son.The show featured guest appearances by a number of great actors. Adam Sandler, Allen Covert, Ben Stiller, Fred Willard, Kevin Hart, Amy Poehler, Will Ferrell, David Krumholtz, Samm Levine, Martin Starr, Busy Phillips, Kimberly Stewart and many others made apperances throughout the season. An obvious connection to Freaks and Geeks is made, as Levine, Phillips, Segel, Starr and Rogen were all regulars on Apatow's former show. These guest characters however, are used very well and make for a well rounded ensemble.Possibly the best part about this four disc set is the commentaries. Every single regular cast member sat down for at least one commentary, many did more. Apatow and a number of directors and writers also were featured, as were many of the supporting actors who made guest appearances on the show. Like the Freaks and Geeks set, there is a lot of information in these commentaries, and Shout Factory should be commended for getting all the actors together to do these commentaries.Additionally, there is a Loudon Wainwright concert, a question and answer with cast and crew at the Museum of Television, a script for a second season episode that never existed and audition tapes for the main actors.This truly is a fine set, with great extras. The high quality of the show made for great television and that fact was captured well in this DVD set.",5,Chicken Parmigiana and the Last Boy Scout,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,4528,"['are', 'certain', 'television', 'shows', 'please', 'critics', 'receive', 'praise', 'television', 'industry', 'yet', 'never', 'find', 'big', 'enough', 'fan', 'base', 'become', 'truly', 'popular', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'such', 'show', 'today', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'was', 'fit', 'bill.Undeclared', 'was', 'certainly', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'appreciated', 'audiences', 'watching', 'DVD', 'apparent', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'watching', 'were', 'truly', 'missing', 'out', 'one', 'great', 'looks', 'college', 'life', 'modern', 'television.The', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'man', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'now', 'known', 'better', 'man', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Undeclared', 'became', 'second', 'show', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'last', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'being', 'cancelled', 'too', 'bad', 'show', 'really', 'gave', 'great', 'look', 'college', 'life.The', 'show', 'centered', 'Steven', 'Karp', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'typical', 'nervous', 'freshman', 'looking', 'reinvent', 'college', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'Baruchel', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'role', 'skinny', 'frame', 'appearance', 'nervousness', 'apprehension', 'new', 'experience', 'college', 'find', 'thinking', 'people', 'knew', 'college', 'even', 'little', 'seeing', 'pieces', 'Steven', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'piece', 'casting.Carla', 'Gallo', 'Lizzie', 'Exley', 'girl', 'Steven', 'dreams', 'who', 'live', 'hall', 'Lizzie', 'little', 'more', 'outgoing', 'Steven', 'also', 'encountering', 'number', 'same', 'problems', 'Steven', 'college', 'biggest', 'issue', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'perfection', 'guest', 'star', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'jealousness', 'friendship', 'eventual', 'relationship', 'Steven', 'great', 'plot', 'line', 'one', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'college', 'campus', 'well.Monica', 'Keena', 'who', 'earned', 'distinction', 'being', 'first', 'character', 'killed', 'off', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Abby', 'Morgan', 'Lizzie', 'roomate', 'Rachel', 'girl', 'who', 'attractive', 'advantage', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'much', 'Lizzie', 'is.Steven', 'roomates', 'Lloyd', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'Ron', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Marshall', 'Timm', 'Sharp', 'are', 'truly', 'eclectic', 'bunch', 'Lloyd', 'charming', 'ladies', 'man', 'England', 'who', 'absolutely', 'problems', 'finding', 'ladies', 'Ron', 'resident', 'prankster', 'often', 'teaming', 'others', 'pick', 'Steven', 'friendly', 'way', 'Marshall', 'lonely', 'guy', 'looking', 'girl', 'really', 'only', 'seeing', 'one', 'Rachel', 'four', 'roomates', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'bringing', 'something', 'different', 'table.Christina', 'Payano', 'stars', 'part', 'season', 'Tina', 'Lizzie', 'Rachel', 's', 'other', 'roommate', 'character', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'time', 'develop', 'cancellation', 'stopped', 'hope', 'season', 'two.Legendary', 'folk', 'singer', 'Loudon', 'Wainwright', 'Steven', 'dad', 'Hal', 'who', 'news', 'divorce', 'son', 'soon', 'college', 'Hal', 'close', 'eventually', 'taking', 'classes', 'campus', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'one', 'RAs', 'Steven', 'dorm', 'constant', 'source', 'embarrasment', 'Steven', 'same', 'time', 'encouraging', 'supportive', 'son.The', 'show', 'featured', 'guest', 'appearances', 'number', 'great', 'actors', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'Samm', 'Levine', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'Busy', 'Phillips', 'Kimberly', 'Stewart', 'many', 'others', 'made', 'apperances', 'season', 'obvious', 'connection', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'made', 'Levine', 'Phillips', 'Segel', 'Starr', 'Rogen', 'were', 'regulars', 'Apatow', 'former', 'show', 'guest', 'characters', 'however', 'are', 'used', 'very', 'well', 'make', 'well', 'rounded', 'ensemble.Possibly', 'best', 'part', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'commentaries', 'single', 'regular', 'cast', 'member', 'sat', 'down', 'least', 'one', 'commentary', 'many', 'did', 'more', 'Apatow', 'number', 'directors', 'writers', 'also', 'were', 'featured', 'were', 'many', 'supporting', 'actors', 'who', 'made', 'guest', 'appearances', 'show', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'set', 'lot', 'information', 'commentaries', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'getting', 'actors', 'together', 'do', 'commentaries.Additionally', 'Loudon', 'Wainwright', 'concert', 'question', 'answer', 'cast', 'crew', 'Museum', 'Television', 'script', 'second', 'season', 'episode', 'never', 'existed', 'audition', 'tapes', 'main', 'actors.This', 'truly', 'fine', 'set', 'great', 'extras', 'high', 'quality', 'show', 'made', 'great', 'television', 'fact', 'was', 'captured', 'well', 'DVD', 'set']",N/A

The same people behind this show made FREAKS & GEEKS and that is THE greatest DVD set ever released (the limited edition one at least) so I had high hopes.  When I read about all the bonus features that would be included I got even more excited, but once I got the DVD there were a few glaring problems the biggest of which is that the episodes aren't in the correct order.  If you watch them in the order on the discs then the stories and overall series plot are confused.  Here's the correct order that the episodes should be viewed in:1. Prototype2A. Oh, So You Have a Boyfriend2B. Full Bluntal Nugety (this is actually the original version of episode 2A that the network refused to air.  This version is much better.)3. Eric Visits4.

The Perfect Date16. Hal and Hilary17. Eric's POVThere are also annoying TV-PG ratings in the top corner of some of the beginnings of the episodes.  Don't they put shows on DVD so we don't have to look at logos and commercials?  These two glaring problems knock this release down from a 5 star set to a 4 star one.  But there are still plenty of good things about it.  Besides a great show there are 18 commentaries, deleted scenes on every episode, an hour long Q & A with the cast and crew, auditions, rehearsals, an unproduced script, and a concert by Loudon Wainwright who plays Steven's Dad in the show.

Grifka ""GMan""","[2, 5]","After falling in love with producer Apatow's previous work on Freaks and Geeks, I was thrilled to discover that half of the cast resurfaced in Undeclared. Unfortunately, the quantum leap from a 60 minute fusion of drama and comedy to a more traditional and streamlined 30 minute '18 to 30' target group 30 minute format is painfully obvious.Undeclared is still decent for broadcast TV (whatever that means), but it is far from the exceptional writing, acting, and editing that was Freaks and Geeks. Is it fair to compare the two? Absolutely, especially given that apatow admits he conceived Undeclared as a vehicle for advancing the high school atmosphere of F&G; into a university setting.Alas, the situations and jokes are a bit predictable and forced. There is less 'synergy' from the whole of individual cast members, and most important, the use of music is much less influential and tone setting than that of F&G.;Given that Undeclared lasted a paltry 17 episodes, Apatow and co. still managed to developed a strong core of characters, but in the end, the show is minimally memorable. In the end, Undeclared is just one more dated and cancelled TV show from a specific era that would have benefited from another season. still, we'll never know what could have been....The bonus disc 4 Q&A; session reveals a number of reasons why the show evolved as it did, and Apatow's frustration for the contraints of TV in general, and working with FOX specifically, are acutely obvious. He's a funny guy with a smart approach to low brow humor, and unfortunately his style is too loose, improvisational, and realism based for the small screen.

Jut how many excellent shows have they developed only to cancel over the years?  FOX has demonstrated a wonderful ability to choose great shows to order for broadcast, but a stunning inability to support and develop them.  They are seemingly incapable of nurturing a show.  Their attitude seems to be that if a show isn't an instant and huge hit, can it.  Things seem to have improved a bit under Kevin Reilly, though I remain nervous that DOLLHOUSE, one of the most provocative and interesting shows on TV, might not make it to a second season, largely because it has pulled in only average numbers after being stuck on Friday nights.  FOX has actually developed enough great shows over the years to fill the schedule of two networks, but their ineptness and failure to stick with dozens of fine shows has fostered tremendous fan irritation and ill will.I loved watching UNDECLARED despite being a complete nonfan of Judd Apatow and his cadre of fellow filmmakers.  The only thing he has been associated with that I have loved completely has been FREAKS AND GEEKS.  I should add that I'm especially a nonfan of Seth Rogen, whose box office success is one of the more unfathomable mysteries of the past decade.  So, when I say that I enjoyed UNDECLARED, this is the opinion of someone who disliked THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and KNOCKED UP.I suspect that one of the unsung heroes of both UNDECLARED and FREAKS AND GEEKS is casting director Allison Jones.  Both of these shows feature an amazing number of talented young actors.  Watching either you see an amazing number of actors who have gone on in this decade to have success either in film or on TV.  What this means is that Jones has a great eye for talent.  In the series pilot, for instance, two small roles are filled by Jenna Fischer (who has gotten Emmy nominations for playing Pam on THE OFFICE) and Tom Welling (who has for the past eight years been Clark Kent on SMALLVILLE).  One could cite a huge number of examples of minor characters played by people who later because better known for other roles.  A few would include Kevin Rankin (best known perhaps as Herc on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS), Sarah Jane Morris (BROTHERS AND SISTERS), Alexa Davalos (ANGEL and REUNION), Lizzie Caplan (TRUE BLOOD and currently on PARTY DOWN), David Krumholtz (SERENITY and NUMBERS), Amy Poehler (at about the same time she joined the cast of SNL, but definitely before she was well known), and Felicia Day (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG).  And a huge number of FREAKS AND GEEKS actors appeared on the show.  In addition to Seth Rogen, who was not only one of the main actors on the show but also a major writer, Jason Segal had a recurring role.  And a huge number of people associated with F&G; showed up, including Busy Philipps, Martin Short, Samm Levine, Natasha Melnick (Cindy Sanders, Sam Weir's big crush on F&G;), Mike White, Lizzy Caplan, and many others in either very small roles in each or in more sizable guest cameos, like Ben Stiller.  Now, these aren't by and large major stars, but UNDECLARED nonetheless had a substantial number of quite talented individuals, and this unquestionably contributed to the show's success.I very much enjoyed the core cast for UNDECLARED, most of whom had no connection to FREAKS AND GEEKS.  I even enjoyed Seth Rogen, who I hated in F&G.;  I loved JayBaruchel in the lead role of Stephen Karp (whose dad was played excellently by the funny songwriter Louden Wainwright) and thought that Carla Gallo was really cute and sweet as his first college girlfriend Lizzie.  The rest of the cast was also strong and as a group had great chemistry.  All in all, it easily goes down as one of the best shows about college in the history of TV.  I'm not sure why, but while there have been numerous excellent shows dealing with high school life, there have been astonishingly few dealing with college.  Even truly great shows like BUFFY and VERONICA MARS stumbled somewhat when they hit college.Unfortunately, FOX did what FOX does . . . well, if not best, at least all too frequently.  It killed it.  Over the years the list of shows that FOX has killed off definitely exceeds in quality the list of those that they keep around.  Like I said at the outset, it may be improving under Kevin Reilly.  What he decides to do with the two superb series DOLLHOUSE and TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES will show whether he is breaking with FOX's past or if he will perpetuate the network's tradition of killing off good shows.I watched this via DVDs that I rented from Netflix.  I don't know how to account for this, but the discs that I received duplicated an episode.  ""Truth or Dare"" was on two of the discs, while ""Rush and Pledge"" was on none.  I wouldn't have caught the omission of ""Rush and Pledge"" but for the ""Previously on . . . "" that began the episode ""Hell Week.""  Also, if you compare the play order as the episodes appear on the DVDs with their original broadcast order, they are dramatically different.  Usually this indicates that the network dictated a reordering of the episodes.  But the odd thing is that there are numerous timeline incompatibilities on the DVDs as a result.  Because I was renting rather than buying, I didn't take the time to work through the commentaries.  Perhaps the conflicts are explained there.Speaking of commentaries, UNDECLARED, like FREAKS AND GEEKS, has a vast number of special features.  There are commentaries, deleted scenes, and a bonus disc.  I wish all DVD versions of TV series were so generous.  For instance, I love FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (in fact, much more than either FREAKS AND GEEKS or UNDECLARED), but it is relatively devoid of special features.",4,Yet another in a seemingly endless number

900557,A31M2QHES2IMB,B00092ZM7U,"Steven Scott ""LeChuck""","[3, 4]","So after rediscovering the tragically canceled Freaks & Geeks on disc, I decided to give Undeclared a spin.  I knew I was in for a different kind of show, but I still figured this would be a good follow up series in the Apatow canon.Having said that, no point in continuing to compare these radically different series.  Undeclared is a good show and stands on its own.  It is shot as a half hour show with more emphasis on comedy but flecks of drama mixed in occasionally.  There were some really funny eps in this set, my favorites usually involving Lizzie's long distance boyfriend Eric, played by Jason Segal.  It's a shame he couldn't have been involved more often, but I suppose he made a bigger impact in small doses.The rest of the cast were pretty likable, cast before their characters were written, however there were a few that I could have done without.  I never missed Steven's dad when he was left out of an episode.  And Lizzie and Marshall were particularly uninteresting to me.  Lizzie being a necessary love interest to help Steven's character develop, but I just found her irritating most of the time, and Marshall just not doing much of anything of interest.  Seth Rogen's Ron always had the best lines (and usually had a hand in writing the funniest episodes), and Monica Keena's Rachel was a more entertaining female character, albeit maybe not as fleshed out.The guest stars were occasionally interesting.  I honestly didn't care too much for the big name guests like Sandler, Ferrel and Stiller who were intended to help this fledgling series garner more ratings, and that's exactly what they felt like.  I preferred the more low key guests or the occasional F&G; alum that popped in.The series ends a little abruptly, not because of any fault on the creator's part.  I'm sure this show could have developed into an even better show than it started, if the steady incline of quality as the series went on was any indication.
