1579847,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0090SI1RM,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 12]","While it was never very popular, critically, I remember really liking &#8216;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&#8217;.  It wasn&#8217;t the smartest or the most original (conceptually or in delivery) but it was cute; really cute.  The dialog and gimmick was well balanced and created a fast paced animated adventure that was a breeze to watch, easy and comfortable.  My kids lapped it up like it was candy (pun intended) and my wife and I sat back and enjoyed some mindless entertainment that wasn&#8217;t mind-numbing.The previews for &#8216;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&#8217; made this look like the bigger, better version of the same formula, and I was hooked almost instantly.I had to see this.Despite my clear desire to see this in the theater with my kids, I wound up seeing &#8216;Gravity&#8217; instead.  I made the right call.It isn&#8217;t that &#8216;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&#8217; is bad, because it isn&#8217;t, but it wears out its welcome relatively quickly by thrusting all of its wit at you at once and exhausting its charm to the point where the second half starts to drag by not offering us anything new, improved or exciting.  I love the fact that the film literally picks up EXACTLY where the previous film left off, but the film also literally starts to dig its own whole the minute the opening scene is over.As an obvious homage (and complete rip-off) of &#8216;Jurassic Park&#8217;, &#8216;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&#8217; gives Flint Lockwood a whole new world to explore.  When he is recruited rather suspiciously by the famed inventor (and his personal hero) Chester V, Flint immediately sets out to make a name for himself and earn Chester&#8217;s respect, but that is harder to do than he expected and soon he finds himself face to face with failure, that is, until Chester needs him to locate his food machine.  The problem is that the island Flint once inhabited is now densely populated by living food.  With his gang of misfits in toe (including the hilarious Earl as well as his monkey Steve and his girlfriend Sam), Flint sets off to find his machine only to have Earl&#8217;s true intentions reveal an evil plan Flint must prevent.Yes, the food/animal mashups are fun, and the &#8216;Jurassic Park&#8217; inspirations are, in a way, inspired, but they can&#8217;t carry this film and they are pretty much expected to.  The film is a handful of great ideas strung together with lazy construction.  Even the villainous Chester V (who the film never goes to any length to hide his villainy) feels like something we&#8217;ve seen before, and the admiration on Flint&#8217;s face mixed with the obvious disappointment that comes from realizing his idol is a lunatic felt very much like &#8216;Up&#8217; redux.  But, as I mentioned, my main complaint is that the film exhausts all of its good ideas so early on, to the point where there is nothing left to get excited over.Although I will admit that I laughed at the &#8216;celebrate&#8217; reprise.",3,Cloudy with a chance that food dinosaurs may appear out of nowhere&#8230;,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,3009,"['was', 'never', 'very', 'popular', 'critically', 'remember', 'really', 'liking', '8216', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', '8217', 'wasn', '8217', 'smartest', 'most', 'original', 'conceptually', 'delivery', 'was', 'cute', 'really', 'cute', 'dialog', 'gimmick', 'was', 'well', 'balanced', 'created', 'fast', 'paced', 'animated', 'adventure', 'was', 'breeze', 'watch', 'easy', 'comfortable', 'kids', 'lapped', 'up', 'was', 'candy', 'pun', 'intended', 'wife', 'sat', 'back', 'enjoyed', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'wasn', '8217', 'mind-numbing.The', 'previews', '8216', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', '2', '8217', 'made', 'look', 'bigger', 'better', 'version', 'same', 'formula', 'was', 'hooked', 'almost', 'instantly.I', 'had', 'see', 'this.Despite', 'clear', 'desire', 'see', 'theater', 'kids', 'wound', 'up', 'seeing', '8216', 'Gravity', '8217', 'instead', 'made', 'right', 'call.It', 'isn', '8217', '8216', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', '2', '8217', 'bad', '8217', 't', 'out', 'welcome', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'thrusting', 'wit', 'once', 'exhausting', 'charm', 'point', 'where', 'second', 'half', 'drag', 'not', 'offering', 'anything', 'new', 'improved', 'exciting', 'love', 'fact', 'film', 'literally', 'up', 'EXACTLY', 'where', 'previous', 'film', 'left', 'off', 'film', 'also', 'literally', 'dig', 'own', 'whole', 'minute', 'opening', 'scene', 'obvious', 'homage', 'complete', 'rip-off', '8216', 'Jurassic', 'Park', '8217', '8216', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', '2', '8217', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'explore', 'When', 'recruited', 'rather', 'suspiciously', 'famed', 'inventor', 'personal', 'hero', 'Chester', 'V', 'Flint', 'immediately', 'out', 'make', 'name', 'earn', 'Chester', '8217', 's', 'respect', 'harder', 'do', 'expected', 'soon', 'face', 'face', 'failure', 'Chester', 'locate', 'food', 'machine', 'problem', 'island', 'Flint', 'once', 'inhabited', 'now', 'densely', 'populated', 'living', 'food', 'gang', 'misfits', 'toe', 'including', 'hilarious', 'Earl', 'as', 'well', 'monkey', 'Steve', 'girlfriend', 'Sam', 'Flint', 'find', 'machine', 'only', 'have', 'Earl', '8217', 'true', 'intentions', 'reveal', 'evil', 'plan', 'Flint', 'must', 'prevent.Yes', 'food/animal', 'mashups', 'are', 'fun', '8216', 'Jurassic', 'Park', '8217', 'inspirations', 'are', 'way', 'inspired', 'can', '8217', 'carry', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'expected', 'film', 'handful', 'great', 'ideas', 'strung', 'together', 'lazy', 'construction', 'Even', 'villainous', 'Chester', 'V', 'who', 'film', 'never', 'length', 'hide', 'villainy', 'feels', 'something', '8217', 'seen', 'admiration', 'Flint', '8217', 's', 'face', 'mixed', 'obvious', 'disappointment', 'realizing', 'idol', 'lunatic', 'felt', 'very', 'much', '8216', 'Up', '8217', 'redux', 'mentioned', 'main', 'complaint', 'film', 'good', 'ideas', 'so', 'early', 'point', 'where', 'nothing', 'left', 'get', 'excited', 'will', 'admit', 'laughed', '8216', 'celebrate', '8217', 'reprise']",N/A

I caught the first CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS on television one day when I was just lazing around.  I couldn't turn away.  Hilarious.  A family film that didn't pander down to children; it featured quick, witty dialogue on top of the splashy visuals and sight gags.  Truly a film for the whole family, or just comedy lovers in general like myself.So I got pretty excited about the sequel.  And at times, it didn't disappoint.  There's a definite ""LOST WORLD"" vibe going on in spots, with healthy doses of humor to create a truly unique comedy experience.  And then there's...well, pandering.  Some of it's in the set-up: our returning hero Flint Lockwood is summed by his childhood hero Chester V to help relocate the device that started all the trouble, and put a stop to it once and for all.  Except Chester V has a secret agenda, and he's just using Flint to achieve his master scheme.The returning cast is great, though unfortunately Anna Farris's role is diminished.  We've got Bill Hader, James Caan, Andy Samberg, Benjamin Bratt, and Neil Patrick Harris back for the ride, along with newcomers Will Forte, Kristen Schaal, and Terry Crewes replacing Mr. T. for some reason.  The sight gags are back in abundance (kids will love it), and yes, there's even some of that quick and witty dialogue that helped the original stand out in a world of bland family cartoons.  That being said, the plot is slow to build, and eventually fizzles.  Plus, the climax features some rather dark overtones (was that actually a cannibalism reference?) that, while children probably won't fully understand, seem anachronistic with everything that's come before.  Final verdict: the first film was as much fun for adults as it was for kids (perhaps more so).  The sequel...well, your kids will enjoy.  And you will too, in spots.  But it's not as much fun as the first, it's not as funny as the first overall, and that's a shame.",3,Food fight!,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2057,"['Let', 'get', 'something', 'way', ""'m"", '27-year-old', 'guy', 'kids', 'particular', 'love', 'family', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'most', 'are', 'bad', 'caught', 'first', 'CLOUDY', 'WITH', 'A', 'CHANCE', 'OF', 'MEATBALLS', 'television', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'lazing', 'around', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'away', 'Hilarious', 'A', 'family', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'pander', 'down', 'children', 'featured', 'quick', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'top', 'splashy', 'visuals', 'sight', 'gags', 'Truly', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'just', 'comedy', 'lovers', 'general', 'myself.So', 'got', 'pretty', 'excited', 'sequel', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'definite', 'LOST', 'WORLD', 'vibe', 'going', 'spots', 'healthy', 'doses', 'humor', 'create', 'truly', 'unique', 'comedy', 'experience', 'then', 'well', 'pandering', 'set-up', 'returning', 'hero', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'summed', 'childhood', 'hero', 'Chester', 'V', 'help', 'relocate', 'device', 'started', 'trouble', 'put', 'stop', 'once', 'Chester', 'V', 'secret', 'agenda', 'just', 'using', 'Flint', 'achieve', 'master', 'scheme.The', 'returning', 'cast', 'great', 'though', 'unfortunately', 'Anna', 'Farris', 'role', 'diminished', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'James', 'Caan', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'back', 'ride', 'newcomers', 'Will', 'Forte', 'Kristen', 'Schaal', 'Terry', 'Crewes', 'replacing', 'Mr.', 'T.', 'reason', 'sight', 'gags', 'are', 'back', 'abundance', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'yes', 'even', 'quick', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'helped', 'original', 'stand', 'out', 'world', 'bland', 'family', 'cartoons', 'being', 'said', 'plot', 'slow', 'build', 'eventually', 'fizzles', 'climax', 'rather', 'dark', 'overtones', 'was', 'actually', 'cannibalism', 'reference', 'children', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'seem', 'anachronistic', 'everything', 'come', 'before', 'Final', 'verdict', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'adults', 'was', 'kids', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'sequel', 'well', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'will', 'too', 'spots', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'first', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'overall', 'shame']",N/A

1579888,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B0090SI1RM,FNDNreview,"[11, 17]","In 2009, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was a massive hit for Song Pictures Animation.  The film pitched a unique idea of a secluded island that was deprived of any food - other than nasty, slimy sardines.  Along comes the troublesome Flint Lockwood and his talking monkey, Steve, and suddenly an endless amount of hysterical and excitement ensues.  There was so much excitement that the animated feature went on to gross $243 million worldwide in 2009, quickly prompting the question not if there will be a sequel, but when?  Flash forward four long years, and the adventure of Flint Lockwood and his rag-tag group of friends finally continues - in the highly anticipated sequel, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2.Directed by Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 once again stars the voices of Bill Hader as Flint Lockwood and Anna Faris as Sam Sparks.  After the devastating food storm in the first film, the island of Swallow Falls must abandon their island while a clean-up effort takes place.  However, the clean-up is run by the devious inventor, Chester V (Will Forte) - who desperately wants to acquire Flint's food-making device for his own purposes.  When Flint and his friends return to the island, they discover that Swallow Falls is now inhabited by various forms of food species - most of which appear to be easily aggravated by the new visitors.  The group, including Flint's dad (James Caan), Brent (Andy Samberg), Steve the Monkey (Neil Patrick Harris), Officer Earl (Terry Crews), and Manny (Benjamin Bratt), are out to deactivate Flint's old food device before it wreaks anymore havoc to their home.  Kristen Schaal and Cody Cameron also star in supporting roles.While the first film was based on the book, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs - by Ron Barrett, the film's sequel is not based on the book's sequel.  Instead, Cloudy 2 picks up right where the first film ends, still focusing on the same food machine that went on a food distributing rampage in the first adventure.  Initially, there was fear that this sequel would simply be the same story as the first film, just recycled - with the addition of a few new characters.  And, even though this new flick does introduce a bunch of new characters, the story is anything but recycled and almost revivals the uniqueness of its predecessor.  This new story is incredibly interesting and entertaining, focusing on a group of individuals going to an island full of rampaging creatures - sort of like a food variation of dinosaurs, making this film like an animated version of Jurassic Park.The main character is enjoyable, but Flint Lockwood is a character this is easily overshadowed by his supporting cast.  Most notable in the supporting cast is a monkey that barely speaks more than ten words over the course of the film, but the few words the monkey does utter are well-time and nearly always hilarious.  Like the previous film, Steve the monkey's obsession with mustaches continues, even though gummy bears no longer seem to be an interest since they aren't mention.  Instead, Steve's facial expressions, constantly licking, and interest in cheesy items stand to make for some of the most outlandish and humorous moments of the film.  Along with Steve the monkey, Flint's dad - voiced by the stern sounding James Caan, also serves up a handful of laughs - many of which are interactions with a new group of pickle characters that are quickly comparable to Despicable Me's minions - only green.As usual, the animation is an absolute pleasure to witness, and while the majority of films shot in 3D are a complete waste of money - animated films are usually the exception.  Even though this film is just as enjoyable in 2D, it might be worth the extra few bucks to see this film in 3D.  The colors will simply leap off the screen - especially whenever Flint unleashes his ""party in a box.""  With all of the additions of colorful characters, including the cheeseburger spider, strawberry, and monster taco supreme, every single frame is full of endless adventure of color.Overall, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is just as entertaining as the first film, not to mention quality fun for the whole family.  There really aren't any negative things to say about this film.  It has all the elements to make a successful animated feature:  an interesting lead character, romance, a great supporting cast, and a decent amount of comedy.  There's little doubt that kids will just eat up what Sony is serving with this sequel, and oddly enough, the humor is direct and smart enough that even adults will find themselves chuckling on multiple occasions.  As far as how Cloudy stakes up against the year's previous animated films - well, it's not the best, but it's definitely not the worst.  Without a doubt, there is enough likeability in the Cloudy films that there should be enough fuel in the tank for at least a few more sequels.  Sony clearly has itself a hit and there's little doubt they're going to run with it for several more years to come.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,'Cloudy 2' eye appealing & pleasantly

As in the first showing, the animation is fantastic, and there is laugh-out-loud moments, presenting a delightful comedy for the family. Flint thought he saved the world, when he destroyed his machine that turned water into food, as we watched cheeseburger rain, and spaghetti tornadoes. However, his invention survived, and is now creating food-animals. Flint and his friends, embark on a dangerous mission to battle foodimals, to once again save the world. The colorful characters come to life, and the intriguing story has your attention from start to finish. Adults enjoyed it as much as the children, and the sound effects are awesome. Since I saw so many children enjoy this movie as much as they did, I will be gifting the DVD to friends and family for the holidays. The animation is breath-taking, and many families would find this fun-filled, for quality-time entertainment. There is plenty of action and fantasy in this funny adventure.

But there was a lot of great humor as well. i.e. ""Get back in there tear!"" or the Berry translating Flint.Spoiler: Also, something I felt was overlooked but not a big deal... They were making the one scientist out to be a bad guy, because he wanted to destroy the food animals, and make them, well, food. lol.

1579918,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B0090SI1RM,J. Richardson,"[4, 7]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Four years ago Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs proved to be an unexpected joyride. It was fun, energetic, and undeniably confident. The animation was unique and the story managed to be both care-free and focused at the same time. The characters and the small town they inhabit captivated me unlike any other animated film in recent memory, and the movie quickly became a favorite of mine. Hearing the announcement for a sequel brought out a child-like joy that I haven't felt in quite some time. While I personally didn't feel a sequel was necessary, I wasn't going to argue.As one would expect, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 sees the return of Flint (Bill Hader) and the gang as we ready for another adventure. Picking up just moments after the original left off, the town of Swallow Falls is asked to relocate to San Franjose, California. Chester V (Will Forte) -- legendary inventor and CEO of Live Corp -- has tasked a team of his best and brightest to clean up the ruined town. What everyone doesn't know, however, is that the FLDSMDFR survived the explosion and Chester is out to find it so he can use it for his own personal scheme.In many ways, this sequel improves upon a lot of the things I enjoyed so much about the original. The animation is still fantastic -- if not better -- and the environments are even more vibrant than before. In addition, the whimsical nature of the original is back and there's more than enough comedy to keep you laughing throughout. The food puns are non stop and, in my opinion, that's exactly how it should be. While some did feel a little simple, there were others that were extremely creative. Also, the use of food as a means to set up a joke was astounding. Some were there simply for comedic effect, while others took little jabs at RomCom cliches -- you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.Unfortunately, I found that I walked away with more complaints this time around. For starters, this second serving is extremely formulaic, which makes the film become very predictable within the first fifteen minutes. In my opinion, while the Cloudy 2 may occasionally make fun of movie cliches, it isn't exempt from imitating those found in many animated films. It's very easy to see that Chester is the bad guy and it didn't surprise me at all when Flint was so easily manipulated. He turned on his friends, eventually came to his senses later on, and ended up apologizing. We've seen this formula time and time again, and it was a little disappointing to see it here.Also, there's no denying that the story is more focused this time around and, personally, I think the movie suffered because of it. One of the things I loved so much about the original was that it was so over-the-top and all over the place. You never knew what to expect and this made the comedic scenes -- like the snowball fight -- that much more enjoyable. It had more of a ""I'm going to do what I want because I can and you just have to accept it"" attitude while this sequel is much more tame in comparison. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it was a little unexpected.That's not to say the movie is bad, though. On the contrary, I had a blast even with its predictability. In fact, my sister and I -- 24 and 20, respectively -- were probably the two loudest people in the entire theater. I was giggling from start to finish and there's no doubt I had a goofy grin on my face as well. I love these characters and their world, so seeing them together again was more than enough for me. Also, I thought the foodimals were very creative and Barry is probably one of the cutest characters I've seen a long time.Finally, in my opinion, the voice cast was excellent. With the exception of a few characters, the entire cast from the original returned to reprise their roles. Bill Hader and Anna Faris were, once again, great as Flint and Sam, and I was happy to see that Brent (Andy Samberg) and Flint's father (James Caan) had bigger contributions this time around. Terry Crews replaces Mr. T as Officer Earl and he nailed it. Truthfully, I didn't even know he got replaced until I looked it up prior to writing this review. He was that good. The characters are still unbelievably charming and full of life, and it's all thanks to the great voice acting.Overall Score: 7.8/10 - Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 picks up right where we left off and I was perfectly okay with that. For many, the food puns and whacky humor are going to be a turn off, but that's exactly what I loved so much about the original. While the sequel's story may feel a little too structured in comparison, Cloudy 2 still makes itself worthwhile thanks to its characters, comedy, and beautiful animation.",4,7.8/10 - A true

He becomes a little more than confused and misguided when his inventor/'genius' idol, Chester V who is voiced by Will Forte (Lab Rats, Gravity Falls) gives him a mission where he thinks he will join the elite group of inventors that he only has only fantasized about in the past. Turns out his mission is - to `destroy' - wink, wink - his `FLDSMDFR' (Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator) invention which is about to overrun the world with dangerous, man-eating food!Yup, food! They are the most colorful, creative and hysterical combinations of food that you'll ever see on the big screen that come alive as `animals' and living entities complete with personalities themselves. Their names are creative and their functions are hysterical. Everything from a Hamburger, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Potatoes, Squash, Melons...and so much more all have personalities and a purpose on this island where Flint originally created his food making machine from the first film and his friends and family once lived.The part where your heart-strings are tugged is when his friends and especially his father, Tim Lockwood who is once again voice by the incredible James Caan (Las Vegas, Misery), both rediscover each other in the most unexpected ways. This is where both the kids and the adults in the audience will be able to relate to, with the most real sense of ownership because it's all about family.Now of course there are complications, but Flint wouldn't be where he was for the most supportive, helpful and encouraging band of friends he has. Benjamin Bratt (Law & Order, Miss Congeniality) is back as Manny, Andy Samberg is back as the voice of Brent McHale), Terry Crews (Arrested Development, Scary Movie) is the voice of Earl Devereaux and back as the hysterical funny monkey named Steve, Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, Harold & Kumar) is again lending his voice to this often not-to-sharp monkey.A new character voice of an ape named Barb is voiced sympathetically by Kristen Schaal (Toy Story 3, Shrek The Final Chapter) who learns a valuable lesson about trust and loyalty through the eyes of Flint and his friends. It's a fun, fast paced adventure filled with color and sound.The movie is litered with several puns and play-on-words that it will keep you laughing throughout. A baby Strawberry named ""Barry"" with not only keep you in stiches but will surprise you with some amazing heroics at the end of the film. This is one of those few sequels that stand up to, and in some cases, exceed the original in entertaining you with humor and heart.

So walking into this one didn't leave me wondering for the first 20 minutes what was going on. It also helped that they sort of give you an idea from the start as well.The folks of Swallow Falls have been relocated while a clean up of their food filled city is underway. Hero/inventor Flint Lockwood, the man who created the machine that turned items into food, now works at The Live Corp Company, owned and operated by his hero, Chester V, and responsible for the town's cleanup. There he will work alongside some of he greatest minds in the world creating all sorts of wonderful things. Or so he thinks.One of Flint's first assignments is to return home to not only clean up the problem there but to find his original invention. It seems that it not only has created food from the skies but has also begun turning food into living beings. Not the hamburgers from cows sort but living breathing combinations of food stuffs into new creatures. In so doing Chester V also puts a wedge between Flint and his friends, something we know will eventually be corrected and at which point our unknowing hero will realize was a mistake as he uses them to help save the world. Yes it seems that Chester V actually has evil plans in store for Flint's invention and Flint and the gang must unite to put a stop to said plans.Really the movie boils down to a simple story and that actually works in its favor. Rather than overcomplicate things it makes the movie easy for both kids and inattentive parents to follow. The real treat here is the visual imagery that is on display. The animation is fantastic (even though I'm not a huge CGI animation fan) and the colors on display make you ooo and aahh about once per minute. The combining of food into animals is amazingly inventive and works well within the guidelines of the story.But the true test of how good a kid's film is lies in its ability to not only take us somewhere we've never been before but to make us want to visit it again and again. For myself I found the world presented here one that I'd love to see over and over again. Keeping it fresh will be the hardest part. Keeping it a feast for the eyes the easiest. In the end both kids and adults will find this one a movie worth adding to the collection.",4,A FEAST FOR THE EYES,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,2393,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'first', 'film', 'series', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'more', 'will', 'come', 'did', 'know', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'So', 'walking', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'wondering', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'also', 'helped', 'sort', 'give', 'idea', 'start', 'well.The', 'folks', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'have', 'been', 'relocated', 'clean', 'food', 'filled', 'city', 'underway', 'Hero/inventor', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'man', 'who', 'created', 'machine', 'turned', 'items', 'food', 'now', 'Live', 'Corp', 'Company', 'owned', 'operated', 'hero', 'Chester', 'V', 'responsible', 'town', 'cleanup', 'will', 'work', 'alongside', 'greatest', 'minds', 'world', 'creating', 'sorts', 'wonderful', 'things', 'so', 'thinks.One', 'Flint', 'first', 'assignments', 'return', 'home', 'not', 'only', 'clean', 'up', 'problem', 'there', 'find', 'original', 'invention', 'not', 'only', 'created', 'food', 'skies', 'also', 'begun', 'turning', 'food', 'living', 'beings', 'Not', 'hamburgers', 'cows', 'sort', 'living', 'breathing', 'combinations', 'food', 'stuffs', 'new', 'creatures', 'so', 'doing', 'Chester', 'V', 'also', 'wedge', 'Flint', 'friends', 'something', 'know', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'corrected', 'point', 'unknowing', 'hero', 'will', 'realize', 'was', 'mistake', 'help', 'save', 'world', 'Yes', 'Chester', 'V', 'actually', 'evil', 'plans', 'store', 'Flint', 'invention', 'Flint', 'gang', 'must', 'unite', 'put', 'stop', 'said', 'plans.Really', 'movie', 'down', 'simple', 'story', 'actually', 'favor', 'Rather', 'overcomplicate', 'things', 'movie', 'easy', 'kids', 'inattentive', 'parents', 'follow', 'real', 'treat', 'here', 'visual', 'imagery', 'display', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'CGI', 'animation', 'fan', 'colors', 'display', 'make', 'ooo', 'aahh', 'about', 'once', 'minute', 'combining', 'food', 'animals', 'amazingly', 'inventive', 'well', 'guidelines', 'story.But', 'true', 'test', 'how', 'good', 'kid', 'film', 'ability', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'somewhere', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'before', 'make', 'want', 'visit', 'again', 'again', 'found', 'world', 'presented', 'here', 'one', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'Keeping', 'fresh', 'will', 'be', 'hardest', 'part', 'Keeping', 'feast', 'eyes', 'easiest', 'end', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'movie', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']",N/A
1579937,A3ODENXA668OR,B0090SI1RM,Markus Rexon,"[2, 4]","I think that many people will agree with me when I say that the previous CWACOM film was just a really great film. Pretty much everything about it was great: the great characters, wacky humor that was clean but funny, the pretty vivid colors, and, of course, all the food. That's defiantly a film that is stapled in my animated film collection. And around the time that this film was first released, I heard allot of positive feedback from viewers that said that it lived up fully to the previous CWACOM, probably even better than it's preceeder for some. When it became available for rent on Blu-Ray, I decided to see what it was like myself. I had the chance to watch it twice before I returned it, so I remember the plot details pretty well.Meh, it was alright.I have to say that I was just slightly disappointed with it: I was hoping for something that was faithful to the feel of the original film. But that film feel that helped make the first CWACOM so popular has been replaced with a rather big bash of Hollywood cheese. In other words, it seems like it's one of those films that was made for money. But that doesn't mean that it was a complete loss. Not at all. But the plot and characters are, at times, rather problemic. I can have a long list of problems with this film. I mean, a LONG list. But, for the sake of keeping this review, I'll only go through the film's top three biggest problems. As follows:1. Barb, that monkey...er, ape, really doesn't belong in this film. She's just plain-out freaky. Well, maybe not freaky, but she is very....weird. I mean, all the characters in CWACOM are weird, but in a funny way: but Barb isn't funny at all. She's just awkwardly weird. She really doesn't really do that much in the film, but she appears ALLOT. And most of the time, she is really annoying. And that whole thing about Chester V calling her a monkey and not caring for her much...Eh, that was pointless. I just think that Barb was created for film franchise.2. I really don't like how they introduced all that really advanced technology to the world of CWACOM. In the last film, there was a nice, rustic feeling about everything that made Flint's FLDSMDFR feel like a really cool device. But all that is lost here: now we have realistic holograms, walls that people can walk through, robot suites and just plain from-the-future technology. Nothing about Flint's inventions or any machine of any kind for that matter seem so important anymore. While the previous film seem to give an albeit strange but cool glimpse into the future, this film feels (too much) like the future. This sort of spoiled the movie some for me.3. Allot of the original characters really feel out of touch here. I'm talking about the principal cast in General: Chicken Brent (previously Baby Brent), Earl the policemen, Manny (the camera man), and even to an extent, Sam Sparks. Brent, Earl and Manny feel allot more like secondary characters than they did in the previous film: through the course of the whole movie, they do practically nothing of use and don't have really in-depth dialogue and situations to make them connectable: Chicken Brent seems to be even more of a burden than he was in the previous part (and he is rather annoying for most of the movie), Earl just jumps around and never actually dos much, and Manny....does virtually nothing at all. While in the previous film, they all had a big role to play. Well, maybe not Baby Brent (as he was called at the time), but even he had more to do in that film than this one. All of them just seem to ""be there"" and they have little to do with the story. Sam Sparks had a pretty big role, but same with her: she never really did anything of real importants. She does ALLOT more than some of the characters mentioned before did, but nothing she did really had an effect on the outcome of the film. [SPOILER ALERT] Even in the end, when she was helping the veggie/fruit/plant animals escape from Chester V's base, she couldn't have done it without a LOT of help from Flint, and just to get herself captured again. The only real good guy characters that do anything of importants is Flint and his dad (Tim Lockwood). I actually like how they seemingly enlarged his role from the previous film: he really does allot here, and all he does really flows with the plot, But when he and Flint are the only good guys of real importance to the story, well, that's a problem. I just wish that they could have at least make some of the characters of more importance in the film. Really a weak spot.As I said, I could name allot of problems with this film, but these ones really take the cake. It just feels like the makers expected this film to be successful because the previous one was, and in that they became a little carless in writing and creating it, really bringing down the quality that was so well captured in the previous film.But as I said before, that doesn't mean that it's a poor film not worth watching: why else would I give it three stars? The colors and food (feel weird saying that) here are really vivid and gorgeous, defiantly outdoing that of the first CWACOM. And they look simply stunning in Blu-Ray. MOST of the newly introduced characters are really great and fit right in (like Chester V), the action is witty and exiting, and, of coarse, there is plenty of delicious food. It's not that this is a bad movie: it's just that it could have been better. Probably not a movie that I'd buy, but something that I'd watch and perhaps enjoy. I know that allot of people may like it better than I do. But I still hope that is review was still somewhat helpful to you. :)",3,"Problemic, but none-the-less fun",1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,5630,"['think', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'agree', 'when',

1579951,A24E0EFNJMFII2,B0090SI1RM,munkyhead,"[0, 1]","So I really liked both Cloudy 1 and 2.Some reviewers here just don't understand how creative this movie actually is.how many animated films can you name that has food animals (foodimals)? You can scratch veggietales out of your minds because those characters are just food.Would you ever cross a taco with a crocodile? or a chimpanzee with shrimp? how many people can think up an adorable strawberry as a heroic symbol?You guys all bash on this sequel only because unlike the first film this one has no book.If this story's book never existed would you all be even remotely interested to watch a children's animated film about food falling from the sky? If there was no Cloudy book to begin with I bet you all would love/hate both movies equally.Now for those who say the plot sucked. Why did it suck? How is this plot unlike any other animated film's plot? The beginning is all happy, then there is a problem, characters go on adventure, try to fix problem(s), rescue missions, bad guy destroyed or banished or whatever, etc happily ever after. Name any animated movie that doesn't follow such plot...Also some person said &#34;no character development&#34;...dude this is Cloudy 2 TWO!!! if you want development of characters go watch Cloudy 1. The only new characters were Chester and Barb and all you needed to know was that they were the bad guys.The only other characters were the foodimals and if you wanted a back story to those creatures then I suggest you pay attention to the films you watch.Now jokes: sure some of the jokes were overused and Steve said &#34;Steve&#34; way too many times but do you know who voices Steve?The Legen-wait for it-(thats right)-dary Neil Patrick Harris aka NPH aka Barney Stinson!!! Now NPH, in many of his films and especially his TV series How I Met Your Mother, uses or shall I say overuses many of his jokes over and over but thats what we fans of HIMYM love. We love that consistency and dedication to jokes that should be used over and over. Sure the impact of the jokes in Cloudy 2 were not as good as they are in HIMYM but then again we are talking about a children's animated film not a TV-14 show or PG-13 movie so its difficult to impact teens and adults. &#34;Challenge Accepted&#34;. Plus children nowadays are much smarter and exposed to more grown up terms and jokes so kid jokes like those in Cloudy won't make much of a comedic impact. You can say that they used one or two jokes too many times but if you watch any modern day comedy you will see comedians use the same jokes over and over and over again.Also if you have looked at Cloudy's cast you can see many of them are or were former SNL cast members meaning they have a knack for using and recycling jokes over and over again. Anna Faris is very consistent with her comedies as well. Andy Samberg and his crew the Lonely Island used to be part of the SNL cast. Bill Hader and Will Forte both former SNL cast as well. Plus if you have ever seen Terry Crews in other movies, him as Earl he was basically playing himself as an animated police officer. I mean need I say more? about jokes i meanOne person stated that there were Saturday morning cartoons better than this...are you talking about in this century or back in the 80's - 90's? I would agree if you said in the 80's - 90's but if you are referring to this century's cartoons then your appreciation for creativity and art is so low that I actually pity you for having a brain unable to create anything worth anythingThere are others out here who said they hated the movie but never said an exact reason so I can go ahead and just treat your comments as if they never existed.I'm not trying to persuade you to like this movie but instead of bashing on it blindly maybe take a moment and take into consideration the cast and crew, but also maybe compare it to other great movies that you did like and wonder what the differences are and if there are any similarities. Ask yourself &#34;Why did I like this film but not this one even though they both had...?&#34;A lot of what you like and dislike come from another source that influences you.Take Transformers for example, people liked the first one because it was a classic autobots v. decepticons but once the 2nd one came out people bashed on it because there were no such race as the Primes in the cartoons.Just like how Cloudy 2 has no book. You all scream there is no creativity but the entire thing is very creative because there was no previous ancestor. People are able to accept things they already know easier than things that pop out from thin air.Whats a light bulb? This thing made of see-through material called glass that will have small metal wiring run in the middle that will generate something called electricity to make light similar to that of fire and the Sun. Oh you're crazy it will never work...RightCloudy 2 sucks...Right thats why it has 70% positive reviews on Flixster/Rotten Tomatoes",5,Haters gonna hate,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,4935,"['So',

They&#8217;re typically cute stories for viewers of all ages rife with bright artwork and laced with some sort of life-lesson for good measure.  And such was the reasoning behind Sony Pictures Animation&#8217;s 2009 big screen adaptation of the 1978 children&#8217;s book Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  While the source material was pretty simplistic, Sony managed to scrape quite a memorable and charming tale of what was there.  Perhaps due to a wonderful voice ensemble, layers of humor that appealed to kids and adults alike, unique visuals or some combination of the three- the original Cloudy sort of came out of nowhere and managed to dazzle just about all who encountered it thus explaining how it turned its $100-million budget into $243-mil (gross) worldwide.As is expected in Hollywood, no money-making stone remains unturned and a sequel was all but inevitable and 4-years after the original film, we got Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, which, interestingly opted not to acknowledge the literary sequel (Pickles to Pittsburgh) and instead continue on with the plot, characters and settings established in the first film.The film actually opens with a brief recap of events taking place in the first movie, mainly that Flint Lockwood's (Bill Hader) FLDSMDFR (Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator) was blown up at the conclusion of the first adventure but apparently wasn&#8217;t destroyed in the process.  Buried in mountains of uneaten and mostly gigantic food; the citizens if Swallow Falls, though relieved to be alive, are faced with the daunting task of industrial caliber cleanup.  Fortunately the United Nations, aware of the fact that almost every city on the planet suffered the consequences of Flint&#8217;s invention enlist the aid of revolutionary tech company, Live Corp for the actual cleanup.  Flint is awestruck when he discovers his childhood idol; scientific mogul Chester V (Will Forte) is leading the job personally.  What&#8217;s more- Chester enlists Flint directly to try to track down the rogue food-making machine so as to deactivate it once and for all with a device known as the BS-USB.Lockwood, his girlfriend Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), dad Tim (James Caan), monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris), Baby er I mean Chicken Brent (Andy Samberg), overzealous cop Earl (Terry Crews replacing Mr. T.) and jack-of-all-trades Manny (Benjamin Bratt) travel from their temporary digs in San Franjose back to Swallow Falls which has apparently become overrun by a bizarre race of sentient food/ animal hybrids called, you guessed it: Foodimals.What results is a pretty whimsical adventure/ expedition piece rather reminiscent of the later Jurassic Park films with heards of stampeding &#8220;unnatural&#8221; animals, adorable talking fruits, massive gentle giants and puns aplenty littered throughout a tropical jungle where once civilization existed.  There&#8217;s some good news and bad news in this- The good is that the writers of the sequel had to waste very little time developing their characters this time around as it is a literal continuation of characters (and actors), sets and even circumstances of the first movie.  The bad news is lack of character development nips this piece in its proverbial backside almost constantly to the point that the finished product doesn&#8217;t feel like a solidly constructed story so much as a series of set-ups and plot devices to simply get the viewer to the next marquee moment. Yes, a lot of these marquee moments are clever, witty, creative and often funny, the problem is they come at the expense of the one thing the first film had in abundance: heart.Make no mistake, this film manages to hit all of its marks and at times feels perhaps a bit too reformed and revised for its own good.  Kids will likely be enthralled with the ridiculously lush color pallet and larger-than-life characters and adults, especially those for a penchant for tongue-in-cheek humor & puns will find many opportunities to giggle as well.  In fact that leads me to about my biggest complaint of the piece: when judged on its own merit, it&#8217;s 95-minutes of pretty enjoyable and well-presented CG entertainment but it starts to feel a bit contrived and hollow when compared to the original.On paper all of the pieces for success are present- even some slightly muddled themes of vegetarianism and anti-corporatism and an ending that doesn&#8217;t quite offer the scale of resolve that the premise sets up, it&#8217;s still pretty tricky to come away from this one without a positive vibe and a few good laughs to boot.  And at the end of the day, isn&#8217;t that exactly why we watch these types of movies in the first place?",4,Not Quite as Balanced as the First but Certainly Enjoyable,1391990400,"02 10,

Some of my favorite foods come to life with names like tacodiles, shrimpanzees, cheesespiders and many more. Of course the 3D animation is amazing with great sights, and sounds bringing the magic of this story to life. The foods and vegetables are bigger than life and so exciting to see. One of my favorite scenes is when Berry tries to say Sam and it comes out anything but the name of Sam. Its sounds so funny! I have a lot of favorite foods in this film, but I must admit my ultimate favorite is the fluffy marshmallows. They are a family that is so cute and adorable.In order for Flint and his friends save the world, they need team work, which is one big message in this film. Not only does Flint need the cooperation of his friends to make everything right again but he also learns a valuable lesson in doing so.I like the way the story writers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, writes a great script with such powerful messages that even young kids can understand, enjoy and put into practice in their everyday lives.Other voice talents in this film include James Caan (Tim Lockwood), and Andy Samberg (Brent McHale). Also Will Forte (Chester V) plays a great villain and really makes it where you do not like him at all and wishes he would just go away!I recommend this film for ages 6 to 18. This is a film that the whole family can enjoy. I give it 5 out of 5 stars because it has a great storyline, a great message and the comedy is really funny.See some of your favorite foods come alive in &#8220;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2.&#8221;",5,See some of your favorite foods come alive,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,1648,"['film', 'really', '8217', 'full', 'action', 'comedy', 'fun', 'watch', 'favorite', 'foods', 'come', 'life', 'names', 'tacodiles', 'shrimpanzees', 'cheesespiders', 'many', 'more', 'course', '3D', 'animation', 'amazing', 'great', 'sights', 'bringing', 'magic', 'story', 'life', 'foods', 'vegetables', 'are', 'bigger', 'life', 'so', 'exciting', 'see', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'when', 'Berry', 'say', 'Sam', 'out', 'anything', 'name', 'Sam', 'sounds', 'so', 'funny', 'have', 'lot', 'favorite', 'foods', 'film', 'must', 'admit', 'ultimate', 'favorite', 'fluffy', 'marshmallows', 'are', 'family', 'so', 'cute', 'adorable.In', 'order', 'Flint', 'friends', 'save', 'world', 'need', 'team', 'work', 'one', 'big', 'message', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'Flint', 'need', 'cooperation', 'friends', 'make', 'everything', 'right', 'again', 'also', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'doing', 'so.I', 'way', 'story', 'writers', 'Phil', 'Lord', 'Christopher', 'Miller', 'great', 'script', 'such', 'powerful', 'messages', 'even', 'young', 'kids', 'can', 'understand', 'enjoy', 'put', 'practice', 'everyday', 'lives.Other', 'voice', 'talents', 'film', 'include', 'James', 'Caan', 'Tim', 'Lockwood', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'Brent', 'McHale', 'Also', 'Will', 'Forte', 'Chester', 'V', 'great', 'villain', 'really', 'where', 'do', 'not', 'wishes', 'would', 'just', 'go', 'away', 'recommend', 'film', 'ages', '6', '18', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'give', '5', '5', 'stars', 'great', 'storyline', 'great', 'message', 'comedy', 'really', 'funny.See', 'favorite', 'foods', 'come', 'alive', '8220', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', '2.', '8221']",N/A

Although walking talking food was very creepy to me, it didn't seem to have the same effect on our three year old!
