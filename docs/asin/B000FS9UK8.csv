995065,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FS9UK8,A Customer,"[2, 2]","Basic Instinct 2 is indeed a guilty pleasure. Absolutely trashed by the critics upon its cinematic release a few months ago, the film disappeared pretty quickly, but it's a lot more fun than you might expect, and Sharon Stone as the Machiavellian best-selling crime novelist Catherine Tramell really is a pleasure to watch - although it's pretty obvious the actress is trying to fight the hands of time.Some viewers might consider that Stone is a getting a little too long in the tooth to play this character, but I thought that at forty-eight her age - and her lurid type of sagginess - actually contributed to the authenticity of her character. She spends most of the movie spouting lines loaded with sexual insinuation, casually sitting around her pent-house London apartment in heels, tight skirt and full makeup waiting for Dr. Michael Glass (a very hot David Morrissey) to arrive.The story is convoluted and not that believable and it tries to skewer the original movie whilst also presenting a fresh take on Catherine's murderous escapades. However, it's all good, sordid and garish fun. As the movie begins, Catherine is driving a fast sports car through the deserted streets of London, upon her climax; she crashes it into the river resulting in the death of a major sports star.Roy Washburn (David Thewlis), a Scotland Yard detective with a bad attitude is convinced that Tramell, who managed to swim to the surface, was responsible for the man's death. She's got the best defense attorney her massive wealth can buy, so Washburn calls in top shrink Michael Glass (Morrissey) to run a forensic psychoanalysis that could nail her.Of course, Doctor and subject form an attachment, with Glass becoming as sexually obsessed with Tramell. He's warned by Dr. Milena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) to stay away, but he just can't help himself. As the murder count piles up, Glass becomes increasingly captivated by ""risk addiction"" and we never know for sure who is murdering whom.Sharon Stone is good as Catherine, probably because she knows the part so well, and lets face it - no other actress would dare to play the character. But the real discovery is David Morrissey as Michael Glass. His performance is much better than the film really deserves. He pulls off a multifaceted blend of conceit and scarcely concealed wrath whilst still remaining sympathetic. Thewlis is good too, nabbing all the best lines and sporting a bizarre Welsh accent.One notable aspect of this movie is the slick and polished production design. In fact, the movie reminded me a little of the brilliant mid-eighties Kim Basinger film 9  Weeks, which has many of the same qualities.  Director Michael Caton-Jones has imbued his film a kind of trendy and urban architectural symbolism. Everything is slick and faux designed and London as never looked so fashionable and glamorous.Glass' office is in one of London's new phallic steel-and-glass buildings, and the City's trendiest clubs and most modernized districts provide the bulk of the film's locations. These images are among the film's sharpest elements. The sex scenes are also quite well done - and are surprisingly hot; there's no doubt that Morrissey has the body to bear it all - although perhaps the lovely Ms. Stone shouldn't be showing as much as she does.While Basic Instinct 2 obviously lacks the impact of its prequel, as a sexy and stylish thriller, it's still worth watching - and most importantly - it's entertaining. Although there are many mind-messes, red herrings and elementary guilt transferals involving murderous and closeted obsessions, particularly in the third act, the performances, particularly Morrissey's, ultimately make the film worth sitting through.

Henri ""mainman71""","[1, 3]",Basic Instinct 2 is an intriguing movie that has more depth if you are able to understand the story on some level and how it portrays society. It exposes psychiatry as the fake science that it really is and a strong female character who is guided by her instincts is the chief justice.Sharon Stone does a great job with this character. I don't know anyone else who could have been so believable in this role.This movie didn't go so well in terms of making money in the box office. That just highlights how I see this movie - remember who prints the money you pay your movie tickets with.

Nevertheless, I can't help wondering if people made up their minds without any sense of objectivity. The storyline was certainly not a classic but it was entertaining. Unlike the first one Stone made in 1992, this sequel relied more on a more serious storyline rather than mere sex.I felt it succeeded in showing a more watchable version. Personally, I thought it had just the right blend of spice and drama to captivate an audience. I have seen some rather unkind remarks about Sharon Stone in this film. In my humble opinion she looked fabulous. After all she had been through with ilness etc she deserved a lot of credit. Her acting was good, she looked stunning and her beauty speaks for itself.

995069,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000FS9UK8,Alex Udvary,"[8, 10]","Well the American public is at it again. Every year we seem to get a small handful of movies where the public really goes overboard and declares a movie the worst of all-time. Think back over the last five years or so. We had ""Town & Country"" (remember that one?), ""The Brown Bunny"", ""Swimfan"" they even overhype certain movies and call them masterpieces. It always seems to be one extreme or the other. And this is all happening again with ""Basic Instinct 2"".The film has opened to a rather disappointing box-office. It grossed a little more than three million dollars. It already is scored as one of the worst 250 movies of all time on IMDB.com. And for what? If this is the worst movie you have ever seen, you my friend have made some great cinematic choices. You must be watching Ingmar Bergman and Akiria Kurosawa all day.Is ""Basic Instinct 2"" a bad movie? Well, in a way yes. It's bad in the sense the screenplay and the directing and some of the acting lacks a certain logic, but, it's not an offensively bad movie. In other words, if someone tells you they didn't like it, fine, but, I'm surprised at the violent reaction this film is getting. That is simply uncalled for and is a clear case of people over-reactingI wouldn't want to go over much of the plot for this film because I would rather you see it on your own and discover everything for yourself. So if you're looking for a plot description just give me my unhelpful vote and go on to the next review, because I'm not going to reveal much in way of plot.The story takes place in London where Catherine David Tramell (Sharon Stone) is accused of murder when she and a soccer star get into a car accident. Their car runs over a bridge and into a river. She escapes he doesn't. A cop, Roy Washburn (David Thewlis) knows that Catherine is guilty but doesn't have enough evidence to book her. But in the meantime a doctor, (David Morrissey) is sent to give her an examination to decide whether or not she is mentally sane or not. And from that moment on we are in a nice game of cat and mouse between everyone!As I said the movie had some flaws, I won't deny it, but rather I embrace them. I went along with the movie and tried my hardest to enjoy it. And there are elements to enjoy. The best thing about the movie is Sharon Stone. Her performance in a classic, but more vulgar and explicit, version of a femme fatale. In every scene Stone had my attention. She is both sexy and trashy at the same time.Besides Stone you have some other good actors involved. It was very nice seeing Charlotte Rampling playing another doctor, but sadly she wasn't given much of a part. I wish there were more scenes with her character. And David Thewlis is quite good as well. It's a meaty part that could have gotten lost in the shuffle with another actor but Thewlis makes the part memorable. I'll bet you'll remember his character when you leave the movie.So what exactly is wrong with ""Basic Instinct 2"" then? Well I felt as if the movie was jerking us around a bit too much. Everything was all set-up and very little execution. Near the end of the film it wants to be something of a brainteaser but never really comes to a satisfying conclusion. Does this mean there will be a part 3? I don't know. And one could also agrue, despite my praise for Stone, that the movie is trying too hard to be sexy and alluring. You may have a point but here is where things get a bit confusing. Either you go along with the dialogue and accept it, or you begin to question everything and say it's all implauseable. I'm a pretty good sport so I went along with the film and gave it a fighting chance. Which is more than a lot of other people are doing.So should you go see this movie or not? Granted there are a lot of better movies to watch, especially with many of them coming out on DVD, but if you're looking for a guilty pleasure on a Friday or Saturday night I think ""Basic Instinct 2"" may good a good idea. Because again, if for any reason you'll simply want to see Sharon Stone's performance.Bottom-line: Not bad but not great either. It's a kind of guilty pleasure that requires you to shut off your brain. Has good moments and good actors but the weak script and sloppy directing does get in the way. Still it's up to you if you want to see this.",2,"Go With Your ""Instinct"" On This One",1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,4292,"['Well', 'American', 'public', 'again', 'Every', 'year', 'seem', 'get', 'small', 'handful', 'movies', 'where', 'public', 'really', 'overboard', 'movie', 'worst', 'all-time', 'Think', 'back', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'so', 'had', 'Town', 'Country', 'remember', 'one', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'Swimfan', 'even', 'overhype', 'certain', 'movies', 'call', 'masterpieces', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'extreme', 'other', 'happening', 'again', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', '.The', 'film', 'opened', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'box-office', 'grossed', 'little', 'more', 'three', 'million', 'dollars', 'already', 'scored', 'one', 'worst', '250', 'movies', 'time', 'IMDB.com', 'what', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'friend', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'cinematic', 'choices', 'must', 'be', 'watching', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Akiria', 'Kurosawa', 'day.Is', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'bad', 'movie', 'Well', 'way', 'yes', 'bad', 'sense', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'acting', 'certain', 'logic', 'not', 'offensively', 'bad', 'movie', 'other', 'words', 'someone', 'tells', 'did', ""n't"", 'fine', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'violent', 'reaction', 'film', 'getting', 'simply', 'uncalled', 'clear', 'case', 'people', 'over-reactingI', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'over', 'much', 'plot', 'film', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'own', 'discover', 'everything', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'plot', 'description', 'just', 'give', 'unhelpful', 'vote', 'go', 'next', 'review', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'much', 'way', 'plot.The', 'story', 'place', 'London', 'where', 'Catherine', 'David', 'Tramell', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'accused', 'murder', 'when', 'soccer', 'star', 'get', 'car', 'accident', 'car', 'bridge', 'river', ""n't"", 'cop', 'Roy', 'Washburn', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'Catherine', 'guilty', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'evidence', 'book', 'meantime', 'doctor', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'sent', 'give', 'examination', 'decide', 'not', 'mentally', 'sane', 'not', 'moment', 'are', 'nice', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'everyone', 'said', 'movie', 'had', 'flaws', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'rather', 'embrace', 'went', 'along', 'movie', 'tried', 'hardest', 'enjoy', 'are', 'elements', 'enjoy', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'performance', 'classic', 'more', 'vulgar', 'explicit', 'version', 'femme', 'fatale', 'scene', 'Stone', 'had', 'attention', 'sexy', 'trashy', 'same', 'Stone', 'have', 'other', 'good', 'actors', 'involved', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'playing', 'doctor', 'sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'part', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'scenes', 'character', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'meaty', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'actor', 'Thewlis', 'part', 'memorable', ""'ll"", 'bet', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'character', 'when', 'leave', 'movie.So', 'what', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'then', 'Well', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'jerking', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Everything', 'was', 'set-up', 'very', 'little', 'execution', 'end', 'film', 'be', 'something', 'brainteaser', 'never', 'really', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'mean', 'will', 'be', 'part', '3', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'could', 'also', 'agrue', 'praise', 'Stone', 'movie', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'sexy', 'alluring', 'may', 'have', 'point', 'here', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'confusing', 'go', 'along', 'dialogue', 'accept', 'begin', 'question', 'everything', 'say', 'implauseable', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'good', 'sport', 'went', 'along', 'film', 'gave', 'fighting', 'chance', 'more', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'doing.So', 'should', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'Granted', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'movies', 'watch', 'especially', 'many', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'looking', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'night', 'think', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'may', 'good', 'good', 'idea', 'again', 'reason', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'want', 'see', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'performance.Bottom-line', 'Not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'kind', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'shut', 'off', 'brain', 'Has', 'good', 'moments', 'good', 'actors', 'weak', 'script', 'sloppy', 'directing', 'get', 'way', 'Still', 'up', 'want', 'see']",N/A

Minutella ""mystery buff""","[1, 1]","Yes, the ice pick wielding seductress Catherine Tramell is back, and those hoping for a campy foray into ""Showgirls"" territory are bound to be disappointed. Sadly, despite all the right ingredients, ""Basic instinct 2"" plays it fairly straight. One keeps hoping the movie to cut loose and become hilariously trashy, but it actually tries to tell a solid story, with middling results. Sharon Stone is just fine; one really can't imagine anyone else playing this role, and she's great fun to watch. No one but Stone can throw a wicked look or be as playfully seductive as she can, too bad the script doesn't help her out. The movie becomes a dreary bore whenever Sharon Stone is not onscreen. Among the many problems, the dialogue isn't as ripe and juicy as one would expect from such a potential campfest. David Morrissey, in the Michael Douglas role, is too stiff and bland to carry the weight of a hot male lead, and setting the movie in London doesn't do much good either.

The issue is that her opponents are all so boring, underutilized, and so lacking as actors that it continuously SEEMS as if Catherine is chewing up the scenery but the REAL problem is that they can't even begin to match her Gleeful Hedonistic Sociopathic Ferocity.The secondary problem is that Catherine doesn't have a worthy opponent to spar with and so both she (and we the audience) are bored.The film is nicely shot and the producers had the good sense to stick with the original score.Anyway, Stone's performance in the original film was so amazing that even if she never has another good role again it won't matter as she's already established herself as one of the great actresses of her generation in a career-defining role which may never again be repeated by anyone.",3,BI-2 DOES Suck....

One night, my group got forced to participate in a game where we were supposed go into the woods and search for other campers. For what reason was not explicitly clear to me nor I had any idea what the hell was I in middle of the woods at one o'clock in the morning. Anyhow, I got truly lost and then became fed up before making my way back to the cabin. That's exactly how I felt when I saw Basic Instinct 2. The film brought the worst out of any 21st century film: lot of boring actors and actresses, emotionless expressions, poor scripting, rubbish ending, and a serious lack of purpose. There was plenty of nudity in Basic Instinct 2, but Sharon Stone didn't flash her beaver. Not that it's important anyway. At one point, the psychologist's girlfriend got involved in a very rough sex and then disappeared afterwards without an explanation. Catherine Tramell threw the psychologist in a maze for reasons not clear. In the end, she won as usual. Yet why do I care? Can't she do something more reasonable and calming like...knitting, doing crossword puzzles, or bicycling? I wondered why the movie takes place in London.

995079,A33693RRRFK55Q,B000FS9UK8,"B. Erickson ""boycorrupted""","[5, 9]","People say Sharon Stone ""still"" looks good ""for her age"" in this film.I suppose she does.  She's what, 47, 48?  Way to go.  If that's our single criterion for rating ""Basic Instinct 2,"" hey, four stars - two each for her personal trainer and her Botox therapist.I was a big fan of the original, which, if indisputably preposterous, was at least entertaining.  Stone's commando leg-crossing may have made her a star, but her actual acting performance as the sexy psychotic socialite serial killer Catherine Tramell was what really carried the film.  The fact that she was able to breathe creative life into the corniest dialogue ever hacked up by Joe Ezsterhaus stands as a greater testament to her craft (from the technical point of view) than her critically-acclaimed work in ""Casino.""  And the film itself rocked along, never allowing you to dwell on any of its compounded absurdities for very long before distracting you with another one.To top it off, it was beautifully shot by Paul Verhoeven in a sort of sepia-toned homage to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo.""  If the script was Cinemax B-movie trash, the production was old-Hollywood glamour at its most glamourous.14 years later...enter the sequel.  I'd heard rumors from time to time, but when I actually saw the trailer for ""BI2"" - starring, yes, Sharon Stone, who was already saying a decade ago that she was getting too old to reprise the role - I could scarcely suspend my disbelief.  Still, having enjoyed the original as I did, I figured I'd give it a shot.  The early negative reviews didn't deter me.  Actually they rather encouraged me, considering that they sounded so similar to the critical lampoonings the first film received.Unfortunately, ""BI2"" is barely a ""sequel"" at all.  Sharon Stone is the only player from the first film to condescend to participate in the second - which might've been OK, considering that she really IS the ""brand.""  The problem is, she seems to have completely forgotten how to have fun with the character, and consequently, she's not so much fun to watch anymore.  I (for one) don't blame it on her age - no, she doesn't look exactly the same as she did in 1992, but her performance back then didn't depend on the fact that she was in her 30's.  What's missing is the ""charm,"" oddly enough.  Catherine Tramell is a sociopath, a cold-blooded killer, a ""risk addict;"" but she's also supposed to be charming - so charming, in fact, that you keep forgeting about her fondness for icepicks until she rips one out from beneath the sheets.  But in ""BI2,"" she's become a creature (or caricature) of pure icy malevolence, without the slightest admixture of magnetism to make her tolerable, let alone seductive.  She glares, she growls, she prowls around like a jaded drag queen in her ""monied tramp"" wardrobe - and you simply can't force yourself to give a damn about any of it.  At least, I can't.Of course, the plot once again revolves around every other character in the movie being ineluctably fascinated by her; but her utter lack of charisma reduces the whole thing to a farce.  They all become entangled in her web purely because they're supposed to.  She ""seduces,"" and they ""give in,"" and who cares.  It's all mechanical and contrived.  None of the actors seem to be taking it seriously, or even subtly playing up the joke.  Meanwhile Stone's Tramell's contempt for everyone and everything she encounters is probably the single relatable aspect of her performance.  You get why she considers them to be dull and dispensable; you just can't imagine why they stick around for their punishment.(By the way, it seems a bit of a reach to claim that ""BI2"" is some kind of intended campy masterpiece.  It's a bad movie, and I'm sure everybody involved knew it was going to be a bad movie, but I don't get the impression that they were actually shooting for laughs.  I don't think they knew what they were shooting for.  Then again, the scene in which Catherine wistfully weilds her icepick as if in nostalgic contemplation of prior homicides is admittedly more hilarious than the entire run of ""Scary Movies."")The film is very slickly produced - you know, like a Volkswagen commercial.  It's all polished veneers under krieg lights, set to techno music.  But again, it has absolutely none of the warmth and sensuality of the first ""BI.""  The story takes place in London this time, and the film effectively conveys the feeling of a draft under the door on a rainy day.  Even the ""sex"" scenes (surprisingly few, considering) are bathed in a cold, clinical, bluish-grey ambience that looks like it would be better suited to light bodies in a morgue on ""CSI.""  The obligatory ""full frontal"" nude scene doesn't involve sex at all.  But none of the actors manifest the slightest semblence of sexual chemistry with each other in the first place, so it actually makes sense that the production follows suit.No, I can't say that I recommend ""Basic Instinct 2,"" even for laughs.  It's simply boring.  Too bad for Sharon Stone - this project was clearly all about the ""empowerment"" of getting naked at 48, which is fine, but she should've made sure there was some sort of actual movie there in the background.

NOT!  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat, trying to figure out whodunit ... if Sharon Stone's character didn't.  She is so good in the role of the very lethal, vampy Catherine Trammel that when she brain-washed the psychiatrist, she brainwashed me as well.  A thoroughly convincing performance by one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood.Stone is ageless, and still hot-looking ... stunning, sexy, and beautiful.  I admire her in real life for being a strong, gutsy woman, unafraid to speak her mind and be true to her own beliefs.This movie had a lot of twists and turns so I was never bored; to the contrary, I was on the edge of my seat all through it.  The only flaw I found in the movie was that the psychiatrist seemed rather wimpy, nothing like Michael Douglass in the first BI, but he gave a good performance for the role he was assigned.I would recommend this movie to all my friends.

995082,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000FS9UK8,Boss Fan,"[4, 8]","""Basic Instinct 2"" is not as terrible as some reviews suggest it is, but it is definitely not a great film either.  It's neither good nor bad.  It's nothing.  Literally.  The movie supplies nothing we haven't seen in any dozen random episodes of ""Law and Order"" or mystery movies of the week.  It is dull, drab and typical.  That describes the script, the setting and the performances.Sharon Stone seems to be game to pull out all the stops again, but she's the only one.  As a result, she is way over the top, chewing scenery and over-acting - precisely the way she did in the first film.  The difference is, in the first film, everyone else was in on the joke and just as game for going over the top - as if they knew they were playing characters from some alternate reality where people actually act the way they do and the things that happened to them were actually possible.  And thanks to Joe Eszterhaz's insanely dopey script (the examples of bad dialogue are too many to list), even the things the characters said led us to believe we were watching something from a world the mirrored ours, but actually seemed to walk its way out of a pulp novel from some heavy-breathing author (Catherine Wolf perhaps).Of course, the first ""Basic Instinct"" wasn't all that good either (we just all remember it as being good simply because much of the movie was memorable - brutal ice pick murders, graphic scenes, the infamous ""leg crossing"" scene, lurid script, and nourish direction by Paul Verhoven), and watching it now, it is even more of a howler but, if you were willing to play along, it was at least satisfying in all the elements it promised to supply.  Actually, it delivered and then some.  Which is why it remains fun and watchable, despite moments and dialogue that make you want to burry your head in your lap out of sheer embarrassment for everyone involved (how did they do and say some of that stuff and keep a straight face).This sequel is all the things the original was not.  It does feel of this world, not just because of its setting (a drab London setting that looks more like a back lot), but because director Michael Canton-Jones does nothing with this material that resembles the Hitchcockian techniques that Verhoven used to such great effect.  The characters feel at least slightly real, and the situations are more plausible than much of what occurs in the first film, even though the events and characters in this film may seem to stretch credibility, they don't do so any more than most movies in this genre.  Nothing here is different than most movies of this genre.  This is going-through-the -motions personified.  If this didn't have the words ""basic instinct"" in the title, this film would be completely ignored and debued on cable.It may resemble something closer to reality, but all this is precisely what makes it such a boring procedural.  Despite its flaws, one thing no one can ever accuse the first of film of being was boring or procedural.  So we are left with a mystery thriller like every other.  Which brings us back to exactly why Stone's performance does not belong in this movie.  More accurately, the movie doesn't belong with her performance.""Basic Instinct 2"" is even bland on the soft-core level that most people who figured even if this movie sucks, if nothing else, they'll see some decent sex scenes.  You'd do better to flip on Cinemax after midnight than anteing up for this flick.  The sexiest scene in the film does not even involve Stone, and the scenes that do would not add up to the length (or quality) of any one of the scenes from the first film.  Stone looks good for her age, but it is obvious it has been 14 years since ""Basic"" 1.  The years have been good to her, but then again, so has her plastic surgeon. (Stone would probably say something like, `I've only had my boobs done,' and that's exactly what I'm talking about.  No kidding, Sharon. Did you think after spending countless films baring your breasts we wouldn't notice?  For the record, they looked better before.)The years may have been kind, but she still looks and (even more so) sounds a little foolish running through this territory again.  And this David Morrissey they have paired her up with is as dull as the rest of the film (he fits).  He seems to be a fine actor, but if you're going to call a movie ""Basic Instinct 2,"" you need to remember the fireworks between Michael Douglas and Stone because audiences sure do.  There is nothing suspenseful, dangerous or sexy between these two.Ditto this movie.Would it really have been that hard to make another over-the-top, violent, sexy thriller like the first one?",2,You'd think their 'basic instinct' would have been to - at the very least - entertain.,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,4647,"['Basic', '2', 'not', 'as', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'suggest', 'definitely', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'good', 'bad', 'nothing', 'Literally', 'movie', 'supplies', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'random', 'episodes', 'Law', 'Order', 'mystery', 'movies', 'week', 'dull', 'drab', 'typical', 'script', 'setting', 'performances.Sharon', 'Stone', 'be', 'game', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'again', 'only', 'one', 'result', 'way', 'top', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'over-acting', 'precisely', 'way', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'difference', 'first', 'film', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'joke', 'just', 'game', 'going', 'top', 'knew', 'were', 'playing', 'characters', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'people', 'actually', 'act', 'way', 'do', 'things', 'happened', 'were', 'actually', 'possible', 'thanks', 'Joe', 'Eszterhaz', 'insanely', 'dopey', 'script', 'examples', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'list', 'even', 'things', 'characters', 'said', 'led', 'believe', 'were', 'watching', 'something', 'world', 'mirrored', 'ours', 'actually', 'seemed', 'walk', 'way', 'pulp', 'novel', 'heavy-breathing', 'author', 'Catherine', 'Wolf', 'perhaps', '.Of', 'course', 'first', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'just', 'remember', 'being', 'good', 'simply', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'memorable', 'brutal', 'ice', 'pick', 'murders', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'infamous', 'leg', 'crossing', 'scene', 'lurid', 'script', 'nourish', 'direction', 'Paul', 'Verhoven', 'watching', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'howler', 'were', 'willing', 'play', 'along', 'was', 'least', 'satisfying', 'elements', 'promised', 'supply', 'Actually', 'delivered', 'then', 'Which', 'why', 'fun', 'watchable', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'make', 'want', 'burry', 'head', 'lap', 'sheer', 'embarrassment', 'everyone', 'involved', 'how', 'did', 'do', 'say', 'stuff', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', '.This', 'sequel', 'things', 'original', 'was', 'not', 'feel', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'setting', 'drab', 'London', 'setting', 'more', 'back', 'lot', 'director', 'Michael', 'Canton-Jones', 'nothing', 'material', 'Hitchcockian', 'techniques', 'Verhoven', 'used', 'such', 'great', 'effect', 'characters', 'feel', 'least', 'slightly', 'real', 'situations', 'are', 'more', 'plausible', 'much', 'what', 'first', 'film', 'even', 'events', 'characters', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'more', 'most', 'movies', 'genre', 'Nothing', 'here', 'different', 'most', 'movies', 'genre', 'going-through-the', '-motions', 'personified', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'words', 'basic', 'instinct', 'title', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'ignored', 'debued', 'cable.It', 'may', 'resemble', 'something', 'closer', 'reality', 'precisely', 'what', 'such', 'boring', 'procedural', 'flaws', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'accuse', 'first', 'film', 'being', 'was', 'boring', 'procedural', 'are', 'left', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'other', 'Which', 'back', 'exactly', 'why', 'Stone', 'performance', 'not', 'belong', 'movie', 'More', 'accurately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'belong', 'performance', 'Basic', '2', 'even', 'bland', 'soft-core', 'level', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'figured', 'even', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', ""'ll"", 'see', 'decent', 'sex', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'do', 'better', 'flip', 'Cinemax', 'midnight', 'anteing', 'up', 'flick', 'sexiest', 'scene', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'involve', 'Stone', 'scenes', 'do', 'would', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'length', 'quality', 'one', 'scenes', 'first', 'film', 'Stone', 'good', 'age', 'obvious', 'been', '14', 'years', 'Basic', '1', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'Stone', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'something', ""'ve"", 'only', 'had', 'boobs', 'done', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'kidding', 'Sharon', 'Did', 'think', 'spending', 'countless', 'films', 'baring', 'breasts', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'record', 'looked', 'better', 'years', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'kind', 'still', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'little', 'foolish', 'running', 'territory', 'again', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'have', 'paired', 'up', 'as', 'dull', 'rest', 'film', 'be', 'fine', 'actor', ""'re"", 'going', 'call', 'movie', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'need', 'remember', 'fireworks', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Stone', 'audiences', 'sure', 'do', 'nothing', 'suspenseful', 'dangerous', 'sexy', 'two.Ditto', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'make', 'over-the-top', 'violent', 'sexy', 'thriller', 'first', 'one']",N/A
995083,A39K9GDTIZ0933,B000FS9UK8,Braden Pickering,"[1, 1]","Like any movie, Basic Instinct 2 has its pros and its cons, but because of the high camp factor of the film, it was pretty much branded as a disaster right from the start whether the critics had actually seen it or not. Granted, I just saw it for the first time some four years after its release, but having already heard the negative reviews I was bracing myself for a letdown. Plus I wasn't overly impressed with the first one, which generally is liked. But my first thought after turning it off was, ""Well that wasn't so bad.""That's not to say this is Oscar winning material we're dealing with here, because like I said the over-the-top performances, especially Sharon Stone's, are almost parodies of the characters established in the first film. I honestly don't know how she said some of those hyper-sexual lines with a straight face. Plus the male lead, David Morrissey, was kind of a bore. Not as cheesy as Ms. Stone, but he lacked screen presence and was altogether ""blah."" Definitely not leading man material. I also felt the plot was thin and trying to stretch it over a full 2 hours was a little unnecessary. Especially since nothing does ever end up getting resolved in the end. Without getting specific, it sort of presents to you a number of scenarios that could have happened, and the viewer is left to decide for themselves how it plays out. Some people may like movies set up like that, but I personally find it irritating and a waste of time, and kind of a cop-out on the writers' part. The so-called deleted and uncut scenes are dull and have no bearing on the racy factor. Others have commented on the absence of a certain jacuzzi scene that is nowhere to be found, which even the back of the box says to watch out for. Hmmm...And yet despite all this, oddly enough it held my attention overall. Maybe it was the anticipation of what silly thing would come out of Sharon Stone's mouth next, I don't know. But ultimately it was entertaining once for the novelty factor, though probably undeserving of repeat viewing. Even so, I feel strangely compelled to defend it as I can think of a hundred movies that deserved to be as universally panned as this one was but weren't, so I suppose it comes down to seeing it for yourself for any real insight.

995084,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B000FS9UK8,Brett D. Cullum,"[1, 2]","Yes, the rumors are true.  BASIC INTSTINCT 2 was one of the biggest baddest bombs of 2006, and it's hardly a great movie in the classic sense of the word.  But as for entertaining?  You won't find another movie more fun other than the first one.  Stone chews the scenery like a champ, looking both silly and hot at the same time.  Her fashion is as over-the-top as her icy cum-hither line delivery.  The movie looks stylish, is well photographed, but has plot holes the size of Cleveland to contend with.  It's a campy hoot, and it has a strange appeal relegated to midnight screenings of cult hits.The unrated DVD doesn't add much.  We get some extended scenes that don't reveal anything more, they just go on a little longer (as in 3 seconds here, 2 there).  Most of the TRULY racy footage that was cut out ended up in a promo reel that circulated around the Internet, and should be easily found with a well thought Google search.  Don't be fooled by ""alternate ending"" either - it's the same but Dr. Glass says two lines that indicate he may not be as crazy as we think.Yet the technical presentation is solid, and the movie works well on the home theatre.  Better than it did in theatres, because now you can scream, giggle, and rewind any time you feel like it in the comfort of your own home where people won't know you're watching a 48 year old vixen trying to seduce a dense shrink.

995085,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B000FS9UK8,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[0, 0]","There is something to be said for Michael Caton-Jones' ""Basic Instinct 2"", and that is that one man's trash is another man's treasure.  In this turgid followup to Paul Verhoeven's original (and equally trashy) 1992 psychosexual romp, the icepick-wielding vixen, Catherine Tramell, is back and, as played by Sharon Stone, she's as flippant, horny, and, oh yes, lethal as ever.  And I'm happy to report that Catherine's trailer park sex appeal also remains intact; without an iota of class, she roars through London, decimating all of those unfortunate enough to get in her way.  It was hard, even in the original ""Basic Instinct"", to buy Catherine Tramell as the product of a wealthy, privileged upbringing, so undisguised was her utter, careless wantonness, her frankly stated and (apparently) insatiable appetites.  But that's what makes Catherine so much fun to watch.  A cross between Hannibal Lector and ""Queer As Folk's"" Brian Kinney, she's a twisted, sexed-up, very dangerous camp icon who behaves in much the same way an over-the-top male character might be expected to behave. I know people who are more appalled by her sexual excesses in these films than they are by the sudden bursts of violence. In fact, the violence in ""Basic Instinct 2"" is kept to a minimum, most of it being seen after the actual act has taken place.  The sex, itself, is fairly graphic, although no more than what I would expect from such an undertaking.The plot of ""Basic Instinct 2"" follows Catherine from her old San Francisco stomping grounds to London Towne, at once picturesque and rainy, made all the more atmospheric by the stunningly photographed landmarks.  A soccer hero with whom Catherine is involved, dies in a questionable (and utterly tasteless) auto ""accident"" that opens the film. Drugs are found in the man's system, including one that induces paralysis, and the lead cop (David Thewliss) immediately suspects Catherine of murder.  Sent to criminal psychologist Michael Glass, Catherine wastes no time in weaving a web of lies and sexual intrigue that result in more deaths occurring before the unconvincing finale.The performances aren't bad, given the film's relentless silliness and determined lack of taste.  As stated, Stone has turned Catherine Tramell into a camp icon, a character who is, really, above criticism.  Love her or hate her, she is what she is. And she looks damn good, at age 48, doing what it is that she does so well.  As Glass, the psychologist with a painful past, David Morrissey does what he can with a role that varies wildly, requiring him to veer from stiff-upper-lip Britishness to out-of-his-gourd madman; the fact that his character is not remotely believable cannot be contributed to his lack of skill as an actor.  David Thewliss, as a good cop/bad cop combo starts out bringing a certain level of realism to his character, although once he goes over the top, there's no bringing him back.  And it's good to see Charlotte Rampling, as a colleague of Dr. Glass, back onscreen, even though she frequently looks like a deer caught in the headlights.  She seems unsure whether to maintain a certain dignity that seems to be in line the character she's playing, or to just let go and jump into the hammy fray.  Unfortunately (I think), by choosing the former and playing it safe, her performance is the one element that seems jarringly out of place in this free-for-all thriller.

It did keep the character of Sharon Stone very similar to the first one, a good show of a Borderline/Antisocial mix of personality disorder (cluster B in general). However, the repetative sexual inuendoe's, the overall lack of suspense at times that should have been, and the in general poor script made this almost painful to watch.  The script kept re-hashing itself every 20 minutes with sharon's lines.  The whole risk addiction was poor. Also, this painted a really poor image of psyciatrists, which I'm not a fan of.

There was a few things that I simply HAD to see ... the first reason was that I did enjoy the first film enough to @ least give the sequel a chance, I thought that the film was quite thrilling even the dialouge in the raunchy sex sex scenes were quite funny and how should I put it ... unique. The Second reason was that Roger Ebert's reveiw was quite interesting (he found it to be really bad but he also included that it was alot of fun and recommended people to rent it ... ???) And the third and most important reason was that I simply had to see how Sharon Stone at 47 was going to revive her career by playing sex obsessed woman who is addicted to taking ""Risk's"".I was actually not to dissapointed ... I went into the film very well knowing that it was going to be bad so it would have been very hard to let me down TO much but anyways ... I was actually having a bit of fun there during that first scene with the orgasm in the car that Sharon Stone was giving herself with the drug induced man's finger (the car is going like 120 miles an hour during this time....). I found the rest of the film to be a bit of a drag though. Suprisingly it felt quite slow for a while but I think that it because I got the extended cut which has around 135 minutes of run time. You can tell that the film tries to  propose a few little twist hear and there but they dont make alot of sense. There are a few fun moments in this sequel but overall as I am sure that you guessed it is a complete failure I am not only talking about the film itself but also in the box office.

995092,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000FS9UK8,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 4]","The first ""Basic Instinct"" movie was by no means a masterpiece.  It was a sleazy, glorified skinemax of a mystery with the hammiest of acting, blatant red herrings, and outrageous adult content.  But it was because of how over-the-top that movie was that I actually enjoyed it, and honestly I missed how movies treated sex back in the day: raw, nothing pasteurized.  Now the original producers made sure that the sequel would downplay much of what made the first film so appealing, and hoped that the lone returning actress would be the selling point amidst the largely unknown British cast and crew.""Basic Instinct 2"" is a new verse, same as the first, only in England.  There's a series of crimes occurred that pointed the sensual crime novelist Catherine Tramell (Stone) as the prime suspect, and she's using her feminine wiles to allure an unsuspecting beau of the law into trust confusion; the beau is a psychoanalyst named Dr. Glass (David Morrissey).  Already, the premise made the sequel self-defeating because it's a movie made for those that saw the first movie, and anyone who saw the first film know NEVER to trust Cat Tramell.  And now I'm suppose to go through this same song and dance routine, expecting to be surprised? I'd be a fool to have any kind of doubt, moreso than the characters/preys of this film.  These people made me groan for the fact that they let themselves get messed around by one lowly character; some are not just regular joes, they're professional criminal analysts.  Even when the professionals understood the mind of the criminal, and he know very that Tramell is a pathological liar AND responsible for the crimes, and are suppose to have better judgment on their knowledge, they still let themselves fall pray to Tramell's traps.  I know this movie is suppose to be a psychological thriller, but this is farfetched. Glass is a complete tool on those inane regards, and so I was basically watching how far deep the lead guy will fall prey into the black widow's hands.Maybe people were watching this just to see more of Sharon Stone, and all I can respond to this is...why her?  Why not Julia Roberts or Monica Bellucci in terms of older 40+ women?  Heck, Helen Mirren looked well for her age.  Sharon Stone might be attractive back at her prime, and while I'm not saying she looked bad for her age, she appeared so pale and thin in her reprised role.  Her heavy make-up didn't hide her aging features, and she often has that dead expression.  Even her character's seductive banter doesn't have the same edge as before, but really, all of the sex and violence in this film are tamed.  I was watching the unrated cut, and the graphic content was nowhere near as visceral as the first film.  Although, I will respect Stone for going bare in a couple of scenes; I didn't think she would have the guts.I admit there were a few moments in ""Basic Instinct 2"" that had my heart pounding, but I was turned off for the rest.  Not only was the content downplayed, so was the acting.  Everyone played their characters without any exaggeration, they are so serious that the movie became pretty lifeless.

All I can say is not since Joan Crawford in ""Queen Bee"" have I so enjoyed or even SEEN a strong, gutsy woman in a Hollywood film, a woman daring to be sexy at an age when most people evidently feel women should ""disappear"" (go figure) or rise to mythic, invincible, sassy proportions as a character and thereby wind up being the one you root for most.  But Sharon Stone as ""writer"" Catherine Tramell fills the bill in ""Basic Instinct 2.""  Oh, it's trashy all right!  But in a good way.  When I read the scathing reviews, I knew I had to see it and I wasn't disappointed.What's the plot?  Who cares?  Do the critics really have such a poor sense of humor?  Do they honestly feel Stone was taking herself seriously as she reduces all men to mincemeat or jabbering fools, strutting around in 7 inch heels?  And even if she was, does it matter?  The fact is that Stone delivers as a sassy woman who takes no prisoners although unlike her predecessors in the 40's and 50's like Crawford, she gets raunchy, as do her co-stars.  The raunchiness actually only provides more laughs, such as when Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey), smitten with Stone against his will while trying to ""cure"" her, answers the phone in the buff (which broke up the entire audience).  It's so campy, it fails to be scandalous -- like a bad Jackie Collins novel brought to life.And since when was the first ""Basic Instinct"" a serious film?  Huh?  If anything, it pales in comparison to this one, because whereas the first one actually DID seem to take itself seriously while being as gratuitously raunchy and exploitational as it gets, this one has a little more fun.

And it was Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Trammel, a rich, beautiful psychopath who manipulates and kills for the sheer entertainment of it, that really made the film.Flash forward 14 years, and Basic Instinct 2, the long-awaited sequel, is by far the worst film I've seen this year. It's not that Sharon Stone isn't still sexy, or that she can't act (in fact, I just saw her on the premiere of ""Huff"" last night, and she was beautiful and brilliantly funny). And it's also not that the rest of the cast isn't completely capable. It's just that the script and direction are terrible.Instead of taking the character of Catherine Trammel to the next level, showing how a brilliant female psychopath might have evolved over 14 years into an even more chillingly diabolical woman, the script takes the character and turns her into a combination of a foul-mouthed adolescent and an over-the-hill tramp. In the first film, when Catherine seduced and destroyed the boorish, hapless San Francisco detectives, it was completely believable. But when Catherine's victims in the new film, who are supposed to be some of the most brilliant and accomplished psychiatrists in London, are so easily manipulated by Catherine when she's behaving like a bratty piece of wannabe Eurotrash, it's just completely unbelievable.",1,What a shame!,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,1438,"['loved', 'original', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Sure', 'was', 'trashy', 'was', 'also', 'fun', 'sexy', 'thrilling', 'just', 'totally', 'watchable', 'was', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'performance', 'Catherine', 'Trammel', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'psychopath', 'who', 'kills', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'really', 'made', 'film.Flash', 'forward', '14', 'years', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'long-awaited', 'sequel', 'far', 'worst', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'not', 'Sharon', 'Stone', ""n't"", 'still', 'sexy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'fact', 'just', 'saw', 'premiere', 'Huff', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'beautiful', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'also', 'not', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'completely', 'capable', 'just', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'terrible.Instead', 'taking', 'character', 'Catherine', 'Trammel', 'next', 'level', 'showing', 'how', 'brilliant', 'female', 'psychopath', 'might', 'have', 'evolved', '14', 'years', 'even', 'more', 'chillingly', 'diabolical', 'woman', 'script', 'character', 'combination', 'foul-mouthed', 'adolescent', 'over-the-hill', 'tramp', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'Catherine', 'seduced', 'destroyed', 'boorish', 'hapless', 'San', 'Francisco', 'detectives', 'was', 'completely', 'believable', 'when', 'Catherine', 'victims', 'new', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'most', 'brilliant', 'accomplished', 'psychiatrists', 'London', 'are', 'so', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'Catherine', 'when', 'behaving', 'bratty', 'piece', 'wannabe', 'Eurotrash', 'just', 'completely', 'unbelievable']",N/A

To call it implausible would be akin to calling the Pacific ocean an over-sized pond.  Despite all that, for a select few it is still worthy of a view.In the film we catch up with Catherine Tramell (played once again by Sharon Stone) some 15 or so years after the original BASIC INSTINCT.  This time she is frolicking around in Britain, still causing trouble and still as vindictive, manipulative & sadistic as ever.  Hey, the movie wouldn't be any fun @ all if any of those things had changed, right?Apparently, all of her run-ins with the law in L.A. slipped under the rug insofar as the Brits are concerned.  They make one passing reference that I can remember to BI 1, but that's it.  This allows her to play her mind games - this time with a psychologist who believes himself to be in control.BI 2 is far from a great movie, but then again the pool of people who would be interested in seeing it is fairly slim, anyway.  Normally, you want to see a sequel to a film to watch the characters set out on a new adventure.  In the case of Catherine Tramell, I'd say this one is more for curiousity-seekers than anyone else.In the end, then, I would recommend this DVD for one of the following groups:  (1):  fans of Sharon Stone.  I fall into this group;  Sharon still looks great even though she is pushing 50.  It's nice to see her in what is perhaps one last erotic thriller before she is too old to pull it off.  (2):  Die-hard fans of BI 1.

And especially sequels with returning actors, because they keep you from blotting the whole thing out of your memory.Though it took many years to formulate and approve the whole thing, ""Basic Instinct 2"" ends up being a messy, halfhearted effort that smacks of ""direct to video."" Except, sadly, it wasn't -- instead, it has been one of the most atrocious box office disasters of 2006 thus far. Both creatively and financially.Novelist Catherine Trammell (Sharon Stone, still trying to revive her career) is doing 110 mph while having sex. They splash off a bridge, and her soccer star lover dies. In the aftermath, a court shrink (David Morrisey) tries to determine if she is sane or not -- and ends up with the sultry killer salivating for him as her next victim/lover. Take this as a warning, guys: Practice safe sex. By that, I mean don't date a woman with risk addiction.Then the dead bodies start piling up around London, and it seems likely that Catherine is the culprit. Fascinated by Catherine, Glass soon becomes enmeshed as a murder suspect, and it means trouble for his ex wife and her boyfriend. Like Catherine's prior victims, the unwitting shrink is lured into a game of seduction and death.The plot is too similar to the original for there to be many surprises in ""Basic Instinct 2,"" although it's rather interesting to relocate the action to London. And as this movie starts to wind up with a shrink and a car crash, it seems that it might actually be worth watching while sober.Then it deteriorates into a meandering waffle. Director Michael Caton-Jones obviously doesn't have the slightest idea where he should take this, so the movie just sort of ambles around aimlessly, getting more boring with every new scene. It almost resembles an arty French film.... except those don't have dialogue like ""Don't take it so hard. Even Oedipus didn't see his mother coming."" Ew.Don't expect sexpottiness from Stone in this movie: her performance here consists mainly of posing. Trammel is supposed to be smart, charming and witty -- and Stone shows none of this here. You'd think she'd at least TRY to act in her ""comeback."" Yes, she looks good for her age. But to justify a movie about a sultry killer, the sultry killer has to be more than a pretty picture.And David Morrisey gives a decent but pallid performance. The poor man looks utterly stupefied throughout the movie, and I can only assume that he's wondering how he signed on for this. A few other good actors -- Charlotte Rampling and Indira Varma among them -- appear, but don't really register.""Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction"" should have been light years better than it is, after a decade and a half of work on it.

The most offensive aspect of this too-delinquent 2006 sequel to the 1992 box office hit is that it pretends to be a double-dip psychological thriller as well as yet another did-she-or-didn't-she sex crime story. Personally, I think there was great potential to turn this into a very black comedy about female empowerment, but the irony seems lost on the filmmakers. The net effect of all this heavy lifting in the plot is this enervating feeling that the movie will never end. The overly complicated screenplay by Leora Barish and Henry Bean is not the only culprit here, as Michael Caton-Jones' direction is pedestrian and plodding. Even the explicit sex scenes are captured in a rather clinical manner that generates nothing close to heat.The plot picks up crime novelist Catherine Tramell years (fourteen to be exact) after her San Francisco police troubles. Relocated to London, she gets implicated in the car crash death of her soccer player lover (she, of course, was driving). Enter police psychologist Dr. Michael Glass to assess her mental state, and the sexually oriented dangers from the first movie get recycled in this story. People start to get murdered. Inevitably, Glass gets painted into a corner, while Catherine keeps one step ahead of everyone else. It seems beside the point that Sharon Stone looks great for 47, though there is a surgical aura about her beauty (whether or not this is the case). Her nihilistic character has not been empowered by the intervening years but flattened into a one-note Machiavellian nymphomaniac, all knowing looks and come-ons with nary a trace of humanity. The fun in her performance has been deflated to fit the constant contrivances of the plot turns.She gets no help from her pasty-looking leading man, David Morrissey, who looks and sounds like the younger brother of Liam Neeson. He lacks the charisma and primal instincts to get away with Glass' quicksilver changes in behavior, especially in the sex scenes. The most inspired in-joke is placing the doctor's office in London's phallic-looking Swiss Re building. It seems a shame to recruit two world-class actors in supporting roles only to waste them - David Thewlis plays the suspicious police inspector, and Charlotte Rampling, looking spectacular at sixty (and a lesson in humility for Ms. Stone), as Glass' more seasoned colleague.Suffice it to say that the last five minutes are absurd to the extreme with no sense of viewer satisfaction over the conclusion. The journey from theaters to DVD has been an unsurprisingly fast one, and the disc includes Caton-Jones' rather bored commentary on an alternative track, and there are several deleted scenes all wisely excised. In fact, not enough was excised for my taste. There is also a disposable ten-minute making-of featurette where there is mention (or dare I say, the threat) of a ""Basic Instinct 3"".",1,Desperately Joyless Sequel Misses Its Destiny as a Black Comedy,1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,2920,"['awful', 'stuff', 'not', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'most', 'offensive', 'aspect', 'too-delinquent', '2006', 'sequel', '1992', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'be', 'double-dip', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'as', 'well', 'yet', ""did-she-or-didn't-she"", 'sex', 'crime', 'story', 'Personally', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'potential', 'turn', 'very', 'black', 'comedy', 'female', 'empowerment', 'irony', 'lost', 'filmmakers', 'net', 'effect', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'plot', 'enervating', 'feeling', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'end', 'overly', 'complicated', 'screenplay', 'Leora', 'Barish', 'Henry', 'Bean', 'not', 'only', 'culprit', 'here', 'Michael', 'Caton-Jones', 'direction', 'pedestrian', 'plodding', 'Even', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'captured', 'rather', 'clinical', 'manner', 'nothing', 'close', 'heat.The', 'plot', 'up', 'crime', 'novelist', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'years', 'fourteen', 'be', 'exact', 'San', 'Francisco', 'police', 'troubles', 'Relocated', 'London', 'implicated', 'car', 'crash', 'death', 'soccer', 'player', 'lover', 'course', 'was', 'driving', 'Enter', 'police', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Michael', 'Glass', 'assess', 'mental', 'state', 'sexually', 'oriented', 'dangers', 'first', 'movie', 'get', 'recycled', 'story', 'People', 'start', 'get', 'murdered', 'Inevitably', 'Glass', 'painted', 'corner', 'Catherine', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'everyone', 'else', 'point', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'great', '47', 'surgical', 'aura', 'beauty', 'not', 'case', 'nihilistic', 'character', 'not', 'been', 'empowered', 'intervening', 'years', 'flattened', 'one-note', 'Machiavellian', 'nymphomaniac', 'knowing', 'looks', 'come-ons', 'trace', 'humanity', 'fun', 'performance', 'been', 'deflated', 'fit', 'constant', 'contrivances', 'plot', 'turns.She', 'help', 'pasty-looking', 'leading', 'man', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'who', 'younger', 'brother', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'charisma', 'primal', 'instincts', 'get', 'away', 'Glass', 'quicksilver', 'changes', 'behavior', 'especially', 'sex', 'scenes', 'most', 'inspired', 'in-joke', 'placing', 'doctor', 'office', 'London', 'phallic-looking', 'Swiss', 'Re', 'building', 'shame', 'recruit', 'two', 'world-class', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'only', 'waste', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'suspicious', 'police', 'inspector', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'looking', 'spectacular', 'sixty', 'lesson', 'humility', 'Ms.', 'Stone', 'Glass', 'more', 'seasoned', 'colleague.Suffice', 'say', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'absurd', 'extreme', 'sense', 'viewer', 'satisfaction', 'conclusion', 'journey', 'theaters', 'DVD', 'been', 'unsurprisingly', 'fast', 'one', 'disc', 'Caton-Jones', 'rather', 'bored', 'commentary', 'alternative', 'track', 'are', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'wisely', 'excised', 'fact', 'not', 'enough', 'was', 'excised', 'taste', 'also', 'disposable', 'ten-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'where', 'mention', 'dare', 'say', 'threat', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '3']",N/A

It became apparent during this film that She (Catherine Trammel) morphs herself into these characters in her books. In doing so, Trammel creates the landscape of a playground of misdeeds, greed, lust, avarice, and murder. Is this her way of playing out her own ""basic instincts"" while gathering a collection of din-witted fools that she drags into a world of their own dreams, or personal nightmares. Yes, a third installment would do well if it exposed Trammel's pathology much further. Beyond some of the kinky scenes, this film is a good watch.

995107,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,B000FS9UK8,G. Dowling,"[1, 1]","Okay, I'll admit it, I greatly enjoyed this movie!  I am a fan of Paul Verhoeven's original, which pushed the limits of sex, violence, and it created the definitive femme fatale in Catherine Trammel, once again played with scenery chewing gusto by Sharon Stone, looking fabulous and sexy at 47.  The movie is like thinking-persons junkfood . . .sordid yet beautifully produced with a wonderful cast.  Catherine begins the movie with having sex at 110 miles an hour in an Astin Martin . . .she writhes, laughs, and drives her car at full throttle into the Thames, leaving her young lover strapped into the vehicle, high out of his mind.  This is just the first 10 minutes.  The film is set in London, but not the doggy, overcast London of old, but rather bright, alive, and pinging with sexual energy and excess.  Trammell is evaluated by Dr. Michael Glass (yes, a transparent ode to Michael Douglas), quite dashingly played by David Morrissey.  Trammell has her new target and hijinks ensue as Glass becomes increasingly obsessed with her.  Just as Douglas' Nick Curran in the 1992 original, Dr. Glass is both revolted and aroused by Trammell.  His repression and slow burn anger at the box he must occupy both personally and professionally are brought over the edge by Trammell's complete relaxation with being off the leash.  He takes her on as a patient, having diagnosed her with the Hitchcockian sounding ""Risk Addiction"", and the movie focuses on their subsequent affair as the bodies start piling up around Dr. Glass.The movie revels in its over-the-top shenanigans.  It displays a kind of ramped up reality full of beautiful people, all decked out in high couture.  Stone has the best wardrobe here.  David Thewlis, as a foul-mouthed detective and Charlotte Rampling, as Glass' warm and wise mentor and colleague, and Hugh Dancy (Evening) as a shady tabloid reporter, add much class to the proceedings.  Director Michael Caton-Jones (Rob Roy) films London as a sexy, exciting town . . .full on danger and electricty.  Caton-Jones knows the material is absurd (just as the original), but has a blast creating this alternate reality.  The plot is easy to pull apart . . .example, even when Trammell is released for lack of evidence early on, wouldn't she still be charged with driving under the influence of narcotics?  Vehicular manslaughter?  It's never clear why the police are so convinced she intentionally killed her lover.The best elements of the original are here .  .  . absudly beautiful locations .  . .remember the huge, dramatically lit interrogation room?  Dr. Glass' office, in the Gherkin Building, is so massive, I doubt 5 years salary would pay for a month!  But it gives us beautiful locations, costumes, and people to look at.  Stone is fantastic.  It's a pleaure to see her vamp out again.  The movie need sto be taken for what it is . . .Glossy, big budget entertainment.  Hollywood doesn't produce thrillers like this anymore . . .it's a guilty pulp fiction pleasure.  My big gripe is that the film bears the scars of re-editing.  Several scenes from the trailer are absent.  There's a lot of sex, but there should have been a lot more.  I am hopeful there will be a more definitive ""Uncut"" edition.  It's an easy rental or purchase right now, away from the hype.  The DVD tarsnfer looks fantastic, although spare on special features.  Give it a try . . .it's a fun movie of you go in ready to suspend disbelief.",4,"""Who knows if I'll ever come again . . .""",1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,3441,"['Okay', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'am', 'fan', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'original', 'pushed', 'limits', 'sex', 'violence', 'created', 'definitive', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Catherine', 'Trammel', 'once', 'again', 'played', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'gusto', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'looking', 'fabulous', 'sexy', '47', 'movie', 'thinking-persons', 'junkfood', '.sordid', 'yet', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Catherine', 'movie', 'having', 'sex', '110', 'miles', 'hour', 'Astin', 'Martin', '.she', 'writhes', 'laughs', 'car', 'full', 'throttle', 'Thames', 'leaving', 'young', 'lover', 'strapped', 'vehicle', 'high', 'mind', 'just', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'set', 'London', 'not', 'doggy', 'overcast', 'London', 'old', 'rather', 'bright', 'alive', 'pinging', 'sexual', 'energy', 'excess', 'Trammell', 'evaluated', 'Dr.', 'Michael', 'Glass', 'yes', 'transparent', 'ode', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'quite', 'dashingly', 'played', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'Trammell', 'new', 'target', 'hijinks', 'ensue', 'Glass', 'increasingly', 'obsessed', 'Just', 'Douglas', 'Nick', 'Curran', '1992', 'original', 'Dr.', 'Glass', 'revolted', 'aroused', 'Trammell', 'repression', 'slow', 'burn', 'anger', 'box', 'must', 'occupy', 'personally', 'professionally', 'are', 'brought', 'edge', 'Trammell', 'complete', 'relaxation', 'being', 'off', 'leash', 'patient', 'having', 'diagnosed', 'Hitchcockian', 'sounding', 'Risk', 'Addiction', 'movie', 'subsequent', 'affair', 'bodies', 'start', 'piling', 'up', 'Dr.', 'Glass.The', 'movie', 'revels', 'over-the-top', 'shenanigans', 'kind', 'ramped', 'up', 'reality', 'full', 'beautiful', 'people', 'decked', 'out', 'high', 'couture', 'Stone', 'best', 'wardrobe', 'here', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'foul-mouthed', 'detective', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'Glass', 'warm', 'wise', 'mentor', 'colleague', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Evening', 'shady', 'tabloid', 'reporter', 'add', 'much', 'class', 'proceedings', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Caton-Jones', 'Rob', 'Roy', 'films', 'London', 'sexy', 'exciting', 'town', '.full', 'danger', 'electricty', 'Caton-Jones', 'material', 'absurd', 'just', 'original', 'blast', 'creating', 'alternate', 'reality', 'plot', 'easy', 'pull', 'apart', '.example', 'even', 'when', 'Trammell', 'released', 'lack', 'evidence', 'early', 'would', ""n't"", 'still', 'be', 'charged', 'driving', 'influence', 'narcotics', 'Vehicular', 'manslaughter', 'never', 'clear', 'why', 'police', 'are', 'so', 'convinced', 'intentionally', 'killed', 'lover.The', 'best', 'elements', 'original', 'are', 'here', 'absudly', 'beautiful', 'locations', '.remember', 'huge', 'dramatically', 'lit', 'interrogation', 'room', 'Dr.', 'Glass', 'office', 'Gherkin', 'Building', 'so', 'massive', 'doubt', '5', 'years', 'salary', 'would', 'pay', 'month', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'costumes', 'people', 'look', 'Stone', 'fantastic', 'pleaure', 'see', 'vamp', 'out', 'again', 'movie', 'need', 'sto', 'be', 'taken', 'what', '.Glossy', 'big', 'budget', 'entertainment', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'produce', 'thrillers', 'anymore', '.it', 'guilty', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'pleasure', 'big', 'gripe', 'film', 'scars', 're-editing', 'Several', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'are', 'absent', 'lot', 'sex', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'am', 'hopeful', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'definitive', 'Uncut', 'edition', 'easy', 'rental', 'purchase', 'right', 'now', 'away', 'hype', 'DVD', 'tarsnfer', 'fantastic', 'spare', 'special', 'features', 'Give', 'try', '.it', 'fun', 'movie', 'go', 'ready', 'suspend', 'disbelief']",N/A

He isn't Michael Douglas and a bit of a bore. Trammel seductively and bawdly remarks that he's a man who likes to be in control which turns her on.  But really.  If someone asks you not to smoke in his office?  Is that really a control freak thing?  That's just a matter of courtesy.  Plus, he hadn't been laid in a long time which means he'll be shucking his pants in no time.  Why does Trammel find this a challenge?  Sharon carried the film.  The supporting cast were no help.  Throw her a bone, people!The movie would have been better if the psychiatrist was a hot and sexy woman--like Monica Belucci.  She would also have a chip on her shoulder because, despite her beauty, she knows she's good at her job, and people have to respect that.  Imagine Catherine Trammel trying to top that.  Two gutsy, beautiful women both trying to be in control of the game. It would be challenging and completely seductive.  For a woman to fight a man for control is one thing, but for a woman to go against another woman?  That just adds a higher element of risk and sexual tension.

Her drugged-out boyfriend does not escape the drowning vehichle and Stone's career may never recover from the watery grave that is this boring film. The original Basic Instinct was a first-rate suspense film with a great Cast and made Stone a Star. This poorly written dud gives her little to do but pose seductively - both naked and clothed. The part of Dr Michael Glass could have been a career-making performance but as played by David Morrissey the role degenerates into something boring and not remotely sexy. The convoluted subplots dealing with a crooked Cop, a rival Therapist, a bitter ex-wife, and date-rape drugs add nothing to the film. Curiously, the Bi-sexual part of Catherine Trammell's life has been strangely ignored this time - perhaps a nod to the Bush-era of intolerance.

And they're copies made for the sole purpose of studios cashing in on the original idea. They're usually haphazard and lazy, with only a handful actually being just as good as or better than their predecessor. Basic Instinct 2 is worse than most sequels. My problems with the film are:Sharon Stone--Ms. Sharon Stone just doesn't have it anymore. She is no longer capable of being a good actress. Okay, enough with my comedy attempt, when was she ever a good actress? She's done two good movies her whole career, yet she actually comes off so self-important as if she's had the career of Meryl Streep.  She's not even fit to be compared to Demi Moore. I liked the movie Diabolique, and Sliver was okay, but they weren't good movies. And her acting was only passable in those. Also, even when Sharon Stone was supposed to be really hot, she wasn't. She wasn't the sexiest girl in Basic Instinct. The girl who played Roxy was. I wonder what happened to her?David Morrissey--When I first heard that some guy named Morrissey was playing the lead, I thought they were actually talking about the former lead singer of The Smiths. He would have been 25 times better than this Morrissey. At least we would have had some charisma on screen. D. Morrissey is about as charming and charismatic as a celery stick with no dip. And he has no chemistry at all with Stone. In a sexual thriller or romance, you must have chemistry. I heard about all of the demands Stone made about who her co-star had to be. She said no to Benjamin Bratt, but picked this walking piece of dandruff to be her male lead?The Plot--Next.The sex--Tacky and raunchy; nothing sexy at all about it. In the first one, every sex scene was well done and suspenseful. Will she or won't she pull out the ice pick? There's no lesbianism in the movie either. Some think this was a critique of the Bush-era America. That's just wishful thinking from haters of anything Republican. Isn't it more likely they strayed from girl on girl action because of all the whiners who accused the original film of homophobia because they made the killer bi? Or maybe the producers knew the public wouldn't bite on a lesbian theme when everybody can see that during the MTV Music Awards.Continuity--It would have been nice to at least tell the audience what happened with Mike Douglas's character; but I guess it's easy to forget a lot about the first film when there's been a 15 year gap between movie release dates, and when the one writing the movie wasn't even born 15 years ago.Bottom Line: Stilted acting and storyline.

995116,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000FS9UK8,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[1, 1]","Standing on it's own, BI2 is not a bad movie.  The problem lies in two aspects of the original; one, Michael Douglas' character was already on edge and unstable due to his shady dealings as a cop and his alcoholism.  Two; The famous leg crossing scene, there is nothing like it in BI2, but it's a good thing.  It allows the movie to stand on it's own more instead of relying on a gimmick.If Basic Instinct had never been made, this movie would stand out as a sexy, film noir thriller in which you have no idea who kills who.  Instead, we kind of feel like we're getting more of the same.  The main difference is Catherine Tramell, played again with steely confidence by Sharon Stone, has upped her stakes and decided to mess with the mind of a very stable, very grounded Psychoanalyst Michael Glass, played by David Morrissey (is `Glass' supposed to be euphemism for how fragile this guy is).  Once again she leads him on, manipulates those around him and makes him question everything he never questioned before.  The strange thing is, she meets him only because she is suspected of murder and a psych evaluation is ordered.  Glass is assigned to her.  This shows that her targets are picked on the fly (we know she's done this before) and this time picks a seemingly invulnerable target.  Glass has no vices, no shady past or skeletons in his closet and seems very capable of dealing with someone even as manipulative as Catherine.  However, she finds the weak points in his armor, mostly his `set of rules' and people in his personal life and slowly breaks down his psyche.Morrissey gives a great sliding-down-a-hill-into-the-wood-chipper performance.  There are many points where you can see him slipping away fast and you just want to grab him and say, `Get a hold of yourself, man!'.  David Thewlis is great as the Scotland Yard Detective of questionable ethics.  He plays his role just shy of over the top and gets away with it.  It's almost as if Stone and producers wanted to bring class and sophistication to the whole movie by setting it London.  And it works to a degree.  Stone certainly knows how to play her role, Catherine is bodacious, over the top, gaudy and sporting a potty mouth that would make sailors blush...but we love it.  And thankfully Stone still looks great after all these years at age 47 (with a little help from her Plastic Surgeon).  But it's been too long since the last one and we certainly don't want to see her do this kind of movie again after ANOTHER fourteen years.",3,Better on its own rather than a sequel,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,2506,"['Standing', 'own', 'BI2', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'problem', 'two', 'aspects', 'original', 'one', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'was', 'already', 'edge', 'unstable', 'due', 'shady', 'dealings', 'cop', 'alcoholism', 'Two', 'famous', 'leg', 'crossing', 'scene', 'nothing', 'BI2', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'stand', 'own', 'more', 'instead', 'relying', 'gimmick.If', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'movie', 'would', 'stand', 'out', 'sexy', 'film', 'noir', 'thriller', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'who', 'Instead', 'kind', 'feel', ""'re"", 'getting', 'more', 'same', 'main', 'difference', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'played', 'again', 'steely', 'confidence', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'upped', 'stakes', 'decided', 'mess', 'mind', 'very', 'stable', 'very', 'grounded', 'Psychoanalyst', 'Michael', 'Glass', 'played', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'Glass', 'supposed', 'be', 'euphemism', 'how', 'fragile', 'guy', 'Once', 'again', 'manipulates', 'question', 'everything', 'never', 'questioned', 'strange', 'thing', 'only', 'suspected', 'murder', 'psych', 'evaluation', 'ordered', 'Glass', 'assigned', 'targets', 'are', 'picked', 'fly', 'know', 'done', 'before', 'time', 'seemingly', 'invulnerable', 'target', 'Glass', 'vices', 'shady', 'past', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'very', 'capable', 'dealing', 'someone', 'even', 'as', 'manipulative', 'Catherine', 'However', 'weak', 'points', 'armor', 'mostly', 'set', 'rules', 'people', 'personal', 'life', 'slowly', 'breaks', 'down', 'psyche.Morrissey', 'great', 'sliding-down-a-hill-into-the-wood-chipper', 'performance', 'are', 'many', 'points', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'slipping', 'away', 'fast', 'just', 'want', 'grab', 'say', 'Get', 'hold', 'man', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'great', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Detective', 'questionable', 'ethics', 'role', 'just', 'shy', 'top', 'away', 'almost', 'Stone', 'producers', 'wanted', 'bring', 'class', 'sophistication', 'whole', 'movie', 'setting', 'London', 'degree', 'Stone', 'certainly', 'how', 'play', 'role', 'Catherine', 'bodacious', 'top', 'gaudy', 'sporting', 'potty', 'mouth', 'would', 'make', 'sailors', 'blush', 'love', 'thankfully', 'Stone', 'still', 'great', 'years', 'age', '47', 'little', 'help', 'Plastic', 'Surgeon', 'been', 'too', 'long', 'last', 'one', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'do', 'kind', 'movie', 'again', 'ANOTHER', 'fourteen', 'years']",N/A

Sharon Stone may be 48 but carries herself very well.  I admire her for having the balls to try and pull this one off. And guess what? She kind of does and still has some sex appeal left even at nearly half a decade. Her voice is lower, she has to wear a lot of make-up, but Catherine Tramell is still in there begging to come out. She still looks better than half the stars in Hollywood half her age, and reigns as the ""Queen of Mean"" (maybe even more so after hearing what all she's done after being famous). Catherine's new fixation with auto-erotic asphyxiation is simply a vanity project for Stone which she holds on to very well.As crazy as this sounds, I did have a hard time buying a shrink would fall for her. But then again in the first installment, why would a homicide detective? David Morrisey as Dr. Andrew Glass looks good, but at times would look sort of stiff in some of his frames looking like he was trying to get into character. David does all he can to make sure his character is more subtle than the cocksure Michael Douglas San Francisco detective from the original. It's a more restrained journey, but he's English and a psychologist. In a way it's a nice contrast to the first. I also wondered how in the world did they get Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis? They both turn in their usual fine performances providing exactly what the script demands of them.It very well may be a hoot to call it ""the worst film of the year"" or ""top pick for a Razzie"", but in the final analysis it mildly entertained me and kept my attention on other affairs. ""Basic Instinct 2"" is still a fun adult erotic thriller that is not as great as the first, but not nearly as bad as Stone's turn in the Halle Berry ""Cat Woman"" flick. Because at least there she looks good, and happy to be back on silver screen.

The writer that's trashy and seductive when she wants to be but also classy and charming when she wants to be as well. Oh plus she also may be a killer ""of course if you saw  the first, you know...she is a killer"" and is a master of mind games. Plus her stories are a lot like the murders that are going on.David Morrissey who frightenly sounds exactly like Liam Neeson plays her shrink. She of course plays mind games with him while trying to seduce him at the same time. People that Morrissey's character knows, start to be killed and he suspects that Cathrine is trying to frame him. While he has feelings for her and also doesn't want to think that she's the killer.David Thewis gives one of the better performances in the movie as a detective that wants to nail her....I mean put her behind bars...lol. Sharon Stone proves that she can still play the part at 50 and that she's still hot with a great body too. I hope she doesn't try to prove that every 10 years though. Who needs to see her naked when she's 60, 70, and 80 lol. The acting is decent in the movie and like Roger Ebert said the movie isn't boring. It keeps your attention throughout even if it's not a great movie.It almost even acts as if part one never happened. There's no mention of Michael Douglas at all. It's funny though that Ebert gave The Usual Suspects * 1/2 and never even recommended it for a rental when he gave this the same rating and recommended it for dvd. When of course the Usual Suspects is a much better made film. This movie is still entertaining though with Stone's trashy yet often funny dialogue. No one else could pull off the role as good as her.

995121,A3FGIDFZA4U3O2,B000FS9UK8,"Joan Crawford ""Jon""","[2, 3]","Marketed as an ""Unrated Extended Cut"" of the heavily censored (before theatrical exhibition) BASIC INSTINCT 2, the print of the film on this DVD is actually almost identical to the theatrical print seen back on March 31. There may be a few minor differences, but the seens which allegedly scored the film an NC-17 rating are missing! Although the DVD contains ten deleted scenes, in none of these deleted scenes are the scandalously sexy scenes which were leaked online before the film premiered. Where are they? Talk about false advertising! These missing scenes do the film a huge disservice--by making the story less easy to follow and choppy. On top of that, the director did a further disservice to the film by leaving some of Sharon Stone's best scenes on the cutting room floor (check the deleted scenes for proof). Anyone who has seen the film knows Sharon Stone's over-the-top, great performance is the main attraction of the film and one of the few reasons to watch it!Unfortunately, instead of cutting some of David Morissey's lengthy and sometimes boring scenes, the director chose to cut out more of Sharon, as well as the lesbian subplot angle (there was even a three-some sex scene shot but now missing).What an injustice to a film which could have been a camp masterpiece. The film is now slightly butchered, rather flawed, but Sharon's performance, as well as costumes, set design, and score, are remarkable. What we have now is a flawed camp classic deluxe. Certainly an entertaining film but, as the box office receipts have shown, a film truly loathed by the masses. It has a following, though. You either love it or hate it.

995125,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000FS9UK8,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 4]","The first ""Basic Instinct"" was so cheesy and idiotic, it worked. It was a good, possibly even great, movie that still has fans drooling over the Sharon Stone leg-crossing scene. ""Basic Instinct 2"" has the entire setup for bad sequel...Different writer, different director, different location, and a script that seems to be a reimagining of the original. This movie flopped at the Box Office, got horrible reviews, but Roger Ebert said that it was a movie that would hold your attention. That's true and not just because of the multiple graphic sex scenes. Sharon Stone (who manages to play her character with the same suave charisma she used in the first movie) returns as novelist Catherine Trammel, who has relocated to London. The film opens, fittingly, as Catherine drives down streets at 110 mph; While her passenger um...Uses his hand for something...Anyway...Catherine ends up crashing the car into a river and escapes, but her companion is dead and she's now a murder suspect. Pretty soon, a criminal psychologist named Michael Glass (David Morrissey) comes into the picture and develops an obsession with Catherine. Eventually, they begin having an affair as more people die around her. The movie tries to make it a mystery as to what exactly is going on, but opts to do the same thing the first film did. It pretty much is a virtual remake; Except Michael Douglas was great in the first film and Morrissey is like a 2 on a 10 scale for charisma. The movie is entertaining, if you look at it for just entertainment. As I said, it's cheesy and apparently unmotivated. It's certainly not the worst sequel ever made. Many people will be disappointed, most people will not agree with this review...But, I kinda liked it.GRADE: B-",4,"Not as Good as the First One, But You Can't Beat the Sex Scenes",1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,1734,"['first', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'was', 'so', 'cheesy', 'idiotic', 'worked', 'was', 'good', 'possibly', 'even', 'great', 'movie', 'still', 'fans', 'drooling', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'leg-crossing', 'scene', 'Basic', '2', 'entire', 'setup', 'bad', 'sequel', 'Different', 'writer', 'different', 'director', 'different', 'location', 'script', 'be', 'reimagining', 'original', 'movie', 'flopped', 'Box', 'Office', 'got', 'horrible', 'reviews', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'said', 'was', 'movie', 'would', 'hold', 'attention', 'true', 'not', 'just', 'multiple', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'play', 'character', 'same', 'suave', 'charisma', 'used', 'first', 'movie', 'novelist', 'Catherine', 'Trammel', 'who', 'relocated', 'London', 'film', 'fittingly', 'Catherine', 'down', 'streets', '110', 'mph', 'passenger', 'um', 'hand', 'something', 'Anyway', 'Catherine', 'up', 'crashing', 'car', 'river', 'escapes', 'companion', 'dead', 'now', 'murder', 'suspect', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'criminal', 'psychologist', 'named', 'Michael', 'Glass', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'picture', 'obsession', 'Catherine', 'Eventually', 'begin', 'having', 'affair', 'more', 'people', 'die', 'movie', 'make', 'mystery', 'what', 'exactly', 'going', 'opts', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'pretty', 'much', 'virtual', 'remake', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'film', 'Morrissey', '2', '10', 'scale', 'charisma', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'look', 'just', 'entertainment', 'said', 'cheesy', 'apparently', 'unmotivated', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst', 'sequel', 'ever', 'made', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'agree', 'review', 'kinda', 'liked', 'it.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

After all, the entire movie is fascinatingly ridiculous. Sharon Stone's character from the first film has turned into a tour de force caricature. Yes she is too old to play the role, but as written I cannot think of any other actor who could play it either.The idea that any of the characters would find her so appealing that they would jettison any shred of common sense out of the window is'well' nuts. It is not so much the physical that is unappealing as it is the mental. Her character screams, look at me I am psychotic.Now certainly some of us have been guilty of being seduced by a patently psychotic middle-aged nymphomaniac, but alcohol and late hours not to mention a dimly lit bar are usually involved. To be seduced by such a creature in the sober light of day is pure science fiction.Indeed every character in the movie seems inexplicably smitten in one way or the other by Stone. I can buy one disturbed and naive character, such as the baby faced psychiatrist going nuts over her, but his ex-wife and her lover as well?The movie has other faults as well. There really is not all that much sex and it does drag at times.

The movie was a huge success partly because it had so much controversy surrounding one of its key scenes, plus the sex appeal of the two lead actors guaranteed plenty of people wanting to see these two together on screen, but even without all that, the movie would have still succeeded because the story was so incredibly solid.  The creative forces behind the movie were smart enough to give people more than simply eye-candy, and offered up a twisted murder/mystery that would leave audiences guessing who the villain was until the very end.  After the films gigantic success, everyone knew there would be a sequel to continue the storyline, however all efforts to get this sequel off the ground failed miserably.  That is, until now, after years of struggle to get anything going with this possible franchise, Sharon Stone finally got to make the one sequel she was dying to make, ""Basic Instinct 2"".""Basic Instinct 2"" (originally subtitled 'Risk Addiction') finds novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) living in London, when she runs into legal trouble yet again when one of her lovers dies in a car accident that she was involved in.  With the London police desperately wanting to put Ms. Tramell behind bars, they call in criminal psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to evaluate her.  The question is, can Dr. Glass resist Catherine's sexual advances or will he fall prey to being another one of her victims?Even though Sharon Stone wanted desperately to make this movie, she really should have taken more time in reading the script before going in front of the camera.  The dialogue is not nearly as fluid as that of its predecessor, and the lines they give Sharon to spout as Catherine Tramell are just so stupid, and lack all of the subtle nuances and hints of malice that she had in the first film.  What was great about her character in the first movie, is that you never knew until the very last moment that she was guilty, and she was so seductive with her speech and body language that it was just enjoyable to watch, whereas in this movie she is basically raunchy and crude, with not a single hint of class that she had in the first movie.  The supporting cast is alright, though one does miss Michael Douglas, his character worked much better than David Morrissey's as a pawn in Catherine's web of seduction and murder.Another problem ""Basic Instinct 2"" ran into, was that they tried too hard to top ""Basic Instinct"" in terms of shock value.  The first movie had the infamous 'leg crossing scene', and contained so much sexuality that people were shocked by it.  However, with this movie being made 14 years later, people have been somewhat desensitized to sex, so the scenes are basically run-of-the-mill, and in some instances instead of being provocative, which is what they were going for, the scenes are somewhat disturbing which serves as a more of turn off to the film, rather than creating any interest in the movie.  It's sad to see that after 14 years of trying to get this movie made, and even having Sharon Stone sue the production company to force the movie to get a green-light, a move that should have raised a 'red flag' for her in terms of this movie's quality, this movie still comes off horrible, especially in comparison to its predecessor.  Another problem the movie had, is that since it took so long to make, Sharon is in all honesty just too old to be doing this type of role.  I mean there's no denying that at the age of 47 or 48, whichever she is, Sharon Stone is still sexy, but everyone knows that it's not her natural look anymore, and that there had to have been plenty of surgery to keep her looking the same way she did in the first film.  So really seeing her vamp it up, and doing the types of scenes required in a movie such as this, is somewhat creepy, when you think that this lady is almost 50 years old, a part of you screams out, ""Move on to something more dramatic, and start acting your age"", but that's just me.  You may have a different opinion, and maybe you can get past the age thing, but I still think that even if you could you'll still be disappointed because this film just lacks any kind of substance.""Basic Instinct 2"" is available in both Rated R and Unrated editions, both contain language, drug use, mild violence, and sexuality/nudity.",1,Avoid This Instinct...,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,4550,"['1992', 'director', 'Paul', 'Verhoven', 'captiviated', 'audiences', 'bold', 'in-your-face', 'approach', 'sex', 'murder', 'mystery', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'starring', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'partly', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'one', 'key', 'scenes', 'sex', 'appeal', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'guaranteed', 'plenty', 'people', 'wanting', 'see', 'two', 'together', 'screen', 'even', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'succeeded', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'solid', 'creative', 'forces', 'movie', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'give', 'people', 'more', 'simply', 'eye-candy', 'offered', 'up', 'twisted', 'murder/mystery', 'would', 'leave', 'audiences', 'guessing', 'who', 'villain', 'was', 'very', 'end', 'films', 'gigantic', 'success', 'everyone', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'sequel', 'continue', 'storyline', 'however', 'efforts', 'get', 'sequel', 'ground', 'failed', 'miserably', 'now', 'years', 'struggle', 'get', 'anything', 'going', 'possible', 'franchise', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'finally', 'got', 'make', 'one', 'sequel', 'was', 'dying', 'make', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'Basic', '2', 'originally', 'subtitled', ""'Risk"", 'Addiction', 'finds', 'novelist', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'living', 'London', 'when', 'legal', 'trouble', 'yet', 'again', 'when', 'one', 'lovers', 'dies', 'car', 'accident', 'was', 'involved', 'London', 'police', 'desperately', 'wanting', 'put', 'Ms.', 'Tramell', 'bars', 'call', 'criminal', 'psychiatrist', 'Michael', 'Glass', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'evaluate', 'question', 'can', 'Dr.', 'Glass', 'resist', 'Catherine', 'sexual', 'advances', 'will', 'fall', 'prey', 'being', 'one', 'victims', 'Even', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'wanted', 'desperately', 'make', 'movie', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'time', 'reading', 'script', 'going', 'front', 'camera', 'dialogue', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'fluid', 'predecessor', 'lines', 'give', 'Sharon', 'spout', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'stupid', 'lack', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'hints', 'malice', 'had', 'first', 'film', 'What', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'first', 'movie', 'never', 'knew', 'very', 'last', 'moment', 'was', 'guilty', 'was', 'so', 'seductive', 'speech', 'body', 'language', 'was', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'whereas', 'movie', 'basically', 'raunchy', 'crude', 'not', 'single', 'hint', 'class', 'had', 'first', 'movie', 'supporting', 'cast', 'alright', 'one', 'miss', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'pawn', 'Catherine', 'web', 'seduction', 'murder.Another', 'problem', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'ran', 'was', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'top', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'terms', 'shock', 'value', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'infamous', 'crossing', 'scene', 'contained', 'so', 'much', 'sexuality', 'people', 'were', 'shocked', 'However', 'movie', 'being', 'made', '14', 'years', 'later', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'desensitized', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'basically', 'run-of-the-mill', 'instances', 'instead', 'being', 'provocative', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'scenes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'more', 'turn', 'film', 'rather', 'creating', 'interest', 'movie', 'sad', 'see', '14', 'years', 'trying', 'get', 'movie', 'made', 'even', 'having', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'sue', 'production', 'company', 'force', 'movie', 'get', 'green-light', 'move', 'should', 'have', 'raised', ""'red"", 'flag', 'terms', 'movie', 'quality', 'movie', 'still', 'horrible', 'especially', 'comparison', 'predecessor', 'problem', 'movie', 'had', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'make', 'Sharon', 'honesty', 'just', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'doing', 'type', 'role', 'mean', 'denying', 'age', '47', '48', 'whichever', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'still', 'sexy', 'everyone', 'not', 'natural', 'look', 'anymore', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'surgery', 'keep', 'looking', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'So', 'really', 'seeing', 'vamp', 'up', 'doing', 'types', 'scenes', 'required', 'movie', 'such', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'when', 'think', 'lady', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'old', 'part', 'screams', 'out', 'Move', 'something', 'more', 'dramatic', 'start', 'acting', 'age', 'just', 'may', 'have', 'different', 'opinion', 'maybe', 'can', 'get', 'age', 'thing', 'still', 'think', 'even', 'could', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'just', 'kind', 'substance', 'Basic', '2', 'available', 'Rated', 'R', 'Unrated', 'editions', 'contain', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'mild', 'violence', 'sexuality/nudity']",N/A

995132,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000FS9UK8,K. Driscoll,"[15, 20]","Basic Instinct 2 is directed by Michael Caton-Jones (This Boy's Life, Rob Roy).  The original film was in my eyes a lot better than most even gave it credit for, but that movie was handled by hit or miss Director Paul Verhoeven.  History suggests that Caton-Jones has consistently directed more quality films than Verhoeven. So the sequel, on the surface anyway, doesn't seem like such a bad idea despite it happening so many years later.  There was something incredibly inviting about Sharon Stone's Catherine Trammel in the first movie.  It was edgy and well done, which is a sum combination superior to the individual strengths.  Many have suggested that this is the worst film of 2006 and I try hard to approach a viewing indifferent to such assertions.  After all, people hailed Crash as the best film of 2005 and I didn't buy into that hype.  I'm going with the sheep here though.  Basic Instinct 2 is the worst film of 2006.In a nutshell, we reconvene in London with Catherine Trammel as the film's protagonist.  Catherine is suspected of playing some role in the death of her boyfriend who was apparently drugged before a fatal car crash into the ocean.  After being released from the authorities she decides to hook up with a psychiatrist named Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey).  The mind games, sexual tension and murder ensue.The most important reason this film failed critically and only lasted about two weeks in American theaters is because of Sharon Stone's performance.  It really pains me to say that.  It is easy to target her age her but that is a slightly misguided criticism.  Sharon looks great for her late 40s in my opinion but her performance suggests a lack of confidence in her own ability to be as sexual as Trammel was in 1992.  First of all, it's not an easy task to duplicate that performance in the first place, but Stone's failure might expose her as a one-dimensional actress recycling a role she is no longer capable of delivering.  It's not her looks that are not sexy; it's her attitude and her paper thin performance that lacks the confidence to be even remotely compelling.  I would even propose that her performance affected the confidence of everyone working this film.  It's entirely possible that the success of the movie depended on Sharon Stone almost exclusively.  Being a huge fan of the first movie, I sincerely wanted her to pull it off.  To Stone's credit, the task at hand was a difficult one.Basic Instinct 2 also doesn't contain nearly the edge that the first film did.  That isn't to say it was necessary to do so.  In fact, some aspects of the first film could certainly be deemed gratuitous and this sequel is notably missing the copious amounts of nudity that the first film contained, for better or worse.  Perhaps there was a conscious effort to be less gratuitous and there is of course some merit to that attempt.  But they failed in not being gratuitous as well because the dialogue in this sequel is at times unnecessarily filthy.  In fact, it seemed like someone intentional added sexual references to the end of some sentences just for the hell of it.  The dialogue was also laughably bad at times and the actors of course struggled in delivering some lines convincingly.The other big flaw is the story in general.  It's not horrible, it's just too convoluted and the movie really dragged at times.  To be blunt, it was really boring for the most part and just didn't hook me in.

995135,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000FS9UK8,Kevin Killian,"[3, 6]","Like everybody else in the forum, I heard how rotten BASIC INSTINCT 2 was supposed to be when it hit the theaters last year, and acquiring the DVD seemed like an idiotic thing to do, though who could resist the premise?  That haircut wasn't doing Sharon Stone any favors, though sometimes the asymetrical cut of her fringe was intriguing and when the hairdressers parted it down the middle, it was annoying because she could have looked so much better.  Oh well, she still looked great except for some scenes, like the climax, in which she looked rough as ten miles of badly paved road and leaning her head against Charlotte Rampling's, she still looked like the older woman in too many ways to count.  And yet, and yet, when all is said and done, what a surprise!  In many ways BI2 has turned out to be the best movie of 2006, not the worst!  And it's not only Sharon Stone who makes it good, although her brave, sizzling performance should have gotten her an Oscar nomination, not the Golden Raspberry or whatever it is.  People who hate her just don't see the genius, I understand that much.  Listen, I saw Meryl Streep in PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION and PRADA, and she should have been awarded a place in the Raspberry Hall of Fame.But enough about her, the point is that as Walter Pater told us, all art aspires to the condition of BASIC INSTINCT 2: RISK ADDICTION.  We begin with the ""inward world of thought and feeling, the whirlpool still more rapid, the flame more eager and devouring.""  As the scenario plays out, we see Stone and David Morrissey move from couch (not that modern therapists use couches all that often nowadays) to the Jacuzzi whirlpool where she offers herself to him and then performs an impromptu underwater ballet, her teeth angled upeward, her grin looming larger through the colored water's prism, as though in a magnifying glass, death illuminating her beauty and her macabre eyes and stretched out skin.  This seems to turn him on more and more.  ""There it is, no longer the gradual darkening of the eye, the gradual fading of colour from the wall -- movements of the shore-side, where the water flows down indeed, though in apparent rest -- but the race of the mid-stream, a drift of momentary acts of sight and passion,"" just as Pater predicted when, in the 1860s, he had his strange dream vision of The Renaissance that managed to suggest the ""hard gemlike flame"" with which the eternally lovely and scary Sharon Stone would be burning in the present day.I wouldn't kick David Morrissey out of bed either!  How dare other reviewers suggest judge him inferior to Michael Douglas in any way under the sun, much less in beauty and in the magnificent force of his thrusting assextensions?  I have seen a sight unrivalled in present day cinema and, to top everything off, I was well and thoroughly gobsmacked by the surprise ending to the film.  OK, BASIC INSTINCT part one had Dorothy Malone, but I have it on good authority that she, like Bela Lugosi in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, was then so out of it that she literally did not know she was being filmed and the footage to be used in a movie.  Did anyone else hear that?Finally, for the first time ever in DVD history, the deleted scenes actually contain something worth watching, the scenes in which Catherine Tramell reminisces about a hammock in Napa.Also what's great is the way the makeup people have costumed and pomaded and teased the red hair of David Thewlis to make him exactly resemble our favorite British poet, the one and only Tom Raworth.",5,Film of the Year,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,3533,"['everybody', 'else', 'forum', 'heard', 'how', 'rotten', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', '2', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'when', 'hit', 'theaters', 'last', 'year', 'acquiring', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'idiotic', 'thing', 'do', 'who', 'could', 'resist', 'premise', 'haircut', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'favors', 'sometimes', 'asymetrical', 'cut', 'fringe', 'was', 'intriguing', 'when', 'hairdressers', 'parted', 'down', 'middle', 'was', 'annoying', 'could', 'have', 'looked', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Oh', 'well', 'still', 'looked', 'great', 'scenes', 'climax', 'looked', 'rough', 'ten', 'miles', 'badly', 'paved', 'road', 'leaning', 'head', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'still', 'looked', 'older', 'woman', 'too', 'many', 'ways', 'count', 'yet', 'yet', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'what', 'surprise', 'many', 'ways', 'BI2', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'movie', '2006', 'not', 'worst', 'not', 'only', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'good', 'brave', 'sizzling', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'not', 'Golden', 'Raspberry', 'whatever', 'People', 'who', 'hate', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'genius', 'understand', 'much', 'Listen', 'saw', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'PRAIRIE', 'HOME', 'COMPANION', 'PRADA', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'awarded', 'place', 'Raspberry', 'Hall', 'Fame.But', 'enough', 'point', 'Walter', 'Pater', 'told', 'art', 'condition', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', '2', 'RISK', 'ADDICTION', 'begin', 'inward', 'world', 'thought', 'feeling', 'whirlpool', 'still', 'more', 'rapid', 'flame', 'more', 'eager', 'devouring', 'scenario', 'out', 'see', 'Stone', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'move', 'couch', 'not', 'modern', 'therapists', 'use', 'couches', 'often', 'Jacuzzi', 'whirlpool', 'where', 'then', 'impromptu', 'underwater', 'ballet', 'teeth', 'angled', 'upeward', 'grin', 'looming', 'larger', 'colored', 'water', 'prism', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'death', 'illuminating', 'beauty', 'macabre', 'eyes', 'stretched', 'out', 'skin', 'turn', 'more', 'more', 'no', 'longer', 'gradual', 'darkening', 'eye', 'gradual', 'fading', 'colour', 'wall', 'movements', 'shore-side', 'where', 'water', 'down', 'indeed', 'apparent', 'rest', 'race', 'mid-stream', 'drift', 'momentary', 'acts', 'sight', 'passion', 'just', 'Pater', 'predicted', 'when', '1860s', 'had', 'strange', 'dream', 'vision', 'Renaissance', 'managed', 'suggest', 'hard', 'gemlike', 'flame', 'eternally', 'lovely', 'scary', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'would', 'be', 'burning', 'present', 'day.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'kick', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'bed', 'How', 'dare', 'other', 'reviewers', 'suggest', 'judge', 'inferior', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'way', 'sun', 'much', 'less', 'beauty', 'magnificent', 'force', 'thrusting', 'assextensions', 'have', 'seen', 'sight', 'unrivalled', 'present', 'day', 'cinema', 'top', 'everything', 'was', 'well', 'thoroughly', 'gobsmacked', 'surprise', 'ending', 'film', 'OK', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', 'part', 'one', 'had', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'have', 'good', 'authority', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'PLAN', '9', 'FROM', 'OUTER', 'SPACE', 'was', 'then', 'so', 'literally', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'footage', 'be', 'used', 'movie', 'Did', 'anyone', 'else', 'hear', 'Finally', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'DVD', 'history', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'actually', 'contain', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'scenes', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'hammock', 'Napa.Also', 'what', 'great', 'way', 'makeup', 'people', 'have', 'costumed', 'pomaded', 'teased', 'red', 'hair', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'make', 'exactly', 'resemble', 'favorite', 'British', 'poet', 'one', 'only', 'Tom', 'Raworth']",N/A

He gets even more focused on her when people around him start turning up dead and Catherine is the prime suspect.I should have known what I was in for when there was a gratuitous sex scene in the first five minutes of this mediocre thriller.  That combined with the feral snarl Sharon Stone wears throughout the movie and her character's penchant for age-inappropriate outfits should have warned me what I was getting myself into.  I guess I was being optimistic when I expected more from the same woman who was nominated for an Oscar for her role in Casino.  Then again that was more than 10 years ago.

995138,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FS9UK8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","The reason the original ""Basic Instinct"" stands out in my mind is not because of Sharon Stone's infamous interrogation scene, or the bit with the ice pick under the bed.  I remember it because the 1992 film represented to me the end of an era defined by the O.J. Simpson trial, and today epitomized by the myriad ""C.S.I."" television shows.  ""Basic Instinct"" begins with the murder of Johnny Boz, a rock and roll star who is stabbed with an ice pick in bed after a night of torrid sex.  His girlfriend, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), is a prime suspect but the police are unable to connect her with the crime.  Now, keep in mind that at the murder scene the bed is fairly soaked with at least three different types of bodily fluids, of which one is not going to be the victim's.  A good crime lab and the case is solved, but this was not that type of movie and its sequel is required to be in a similar vein.The problem with making a sequel to ""Basic Instinct"" is that faced by any effort to have lightning strike twice.  You have to do it again but do it differently, a fine line to try and walk.  Actually, the script by Leora Barish (""Desperately Seeking Susan) and Henry Bean (""Internal Affairs"") come up with something that does the job, the only problem is you are not aware of this until the movie is over and you have to rethink everything you have just seen.  This creates a new problem, in that you actually have to watch this movie twice to determine how good it is because nobody is going to be able to judge retroactively if they pulled it off the first time you watch the film.  This is a significant problem because there are people who are not going to want to see ""Basic Instinct 2"" once, let alone twice.You watch this 2006 film knowing that you have take everything Catherine says and does as being part of her plan.  The question is what is the plan.  We are in London and Catherine is out enjoying her only peculiar brand of auto-erotica, when the guy ends up dead.  Inspector Roy Washburn (David Thewlis) does not buy the innocent act and wants her head.  The court orders her to undergo a psychological evaluation by Michael Glass (David Morrissey), who tells the world Catherine is suffering, for lack of a better word, from risk addiction and that things will only get worse.  He means that she will end up dead, but of course it is other people who start ending up corpses, but not until the film requires us to suspend our disbelief to make the plot work.  This is when Catherine becomes Michael's patient.Now, this is wrong on so many levels, but without it the story is not going to work so you have to just shake your head and go on.  Even knowing what she is much better than most, Michael becomes obsessed with her, while she toys with him in just about every way possible.  He is doomed and it is just a question of how Catherine wants to bring him down, although you are right to pay attention to the nagging voice that tells you there has to be more to it than that.  It is just that this guy has no chance against Catherine, even if he has Washburn and super shrink Milena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) on his side.  This is mostly because of the characters and certainly because of the writing, but also because where as Michael Douglas could sort of catch up with Sharon Stone, I never believe that David Morrissey has a chance.Stone looks great, and not just when she is naked, because what stands out in this performance is her eyes (I keep thinking ""shark"" eyes, but that might be underestimating the situation) and the way that makes her dirty talk such an effective sexual come on (it is not easy, but do not try it at home because I do not want to be responsible for disasters of an intimate nature).  I was almost going to round up on ""Basic Instinct 2,"" because I did go back and watch it a second time to see how it reads once you know what is ""really"" going on (and they were right not to go with the alternate ending because the more subtle approach preserves the requisite sense of ambiguity).  On balance, I think the alternative reading works more than it does not, but there are a couple of points where they play it too far the other way to make sure we buy into it the way they want to set up the final revelation.  Given the circumstances of the sequel, the script is certainly ambitious, but without a co-star on the same level as Stone in the final analysis ""Basic Instinct 2"" just cannot carry it off.",3,"They came up with a decent story of the sequel, but Sharon Stone neeeded a stronger co-star",1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,4461,"['reason', 'original', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'out', 'mind', 'not', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'infamous', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'bit', 'ice', 'pick', 'bed', 'remember', '1992', 'film', 'represented', 'end', 'era', 'defined', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'trial', 'today', 'epitomized', 'myriad', 'C.S.I', 'television', 'shows', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'murder', 'Johnny', 'Boz', 'rock', 'roll', 'star', 'who', 'stabbed', 'ice', 'pick', 'bed', 'night', 'torrid', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'prime', 'suspect', 'police', 'are', 'unable', 'connect', 'crime', 'Now', 'keep', 'mind', 'murder', 'scene', 'bed', 'fairly', 'soaked', 'least', 'three', 'different', 'types', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'one', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'victim', 'good', 'crime', 'lab', 'case', 'solved', 'was', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'sequel', 'required', 'be', 'similar', 'vein.The', 'problem', 'making', 'sequel', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'faced', 'effort', 'have', 'lightning', 'strike', 'twice', 'have', 'do', 'again', 'do', 'differently', 'fine', 'line', 'try', 'walk', 'Actually', 'script', 'Leora', 'Barish', 'Desperately', 'Seeking', 'Susan', 'Henry', 'Bean', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'job', 'only', 'problem', 'are', 'not', 'aware', 'movie', 'have', 'rethink', 'everything', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'new', 'problem', 'actually', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'twice', 'determine', 'how', 'good', 'nobody', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'judge', 'retroactively', 'pulled', 'off', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'significant', 'problem', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'want', 'see', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'once', 'let', 'alone', 'twice.You', 'watch', '2006', 'film', 'knowing', 'have', 'take', 'everything', 'Catherine', 'being', 'part', 'plan', 'question', 'what', 'plan', 'are', 'London', 'Catherine', 'out', 'enjoying', 'only', 'peculiar', 'brand', 'auto-erotica', 'when', 'guy', 'up', 'dead', 'Inspector', 'Roy', 'Washburn', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'not', 'buy', 'innocent', 'act', 'head', 'court', 'orders', 'undergo', 'psychological', 'evaluation', 'Michael', 'Glass', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'who', 'world', 'Catherine', 'suffering', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'risk', 'addiction', 'things', 'will', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'course', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'start', 'ending', 'up', 'corpses', 'not', 'film', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'make', 'plot', 'work', 'when', 'Catherine', 'Michael', 'patient.Now', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'story', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'so', 'have', 'just', 'shake', 'head', 'go', 'Even', 'knowing', 'what', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'Michael', 'obsessed', 'just', 'way', 'possible', 'doomed', 'just', 'question', 'how', 'Catherine', 'bring', 'down', 'are', 'right', 'pay', 'attention', 'nagging', 'voice', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'guy', 'chance', 'Catherine', 'even', 'Washburn', 'super', 'shrink', 'Milena', 'Gardosh', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'side', 'mostly', 'characters', 'certainly', 'writing', 'also', 'because', 'where', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'could', 'sort', 'catch', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'never', 'believe', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'chance.Stone', 'great', 'not', 'just', 'when', 'naked', 'what', 'out', 'performance', 'eyes', 'keep', 'thinking', 'shark', 'eyes', 'might', 'be', 'underestimating', 'situation', 'way', 'dirty', 'talk', 'effective', 'sexual', 'come', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'home', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'responsible', 'disasters', 'intimate', 'nature', 'was', 'almost', 'going', 'round', 'up', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'did', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'once', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'were', 'right', 'not', 'go', 'alternate', 'ending', 'more', 'subtle', 'approach', 'requisite', 'sense', 'ambiguity', 'balance', 'think', 'alternative', 'reading', 'more', 'not', 'are', 'couple', 'points', 'where', 'play', 'too', 'far', 'other', 'way', 'make', 'sure', 'buy', 'way', 'want', 'set', 'up', 'final', 'revelation', 'Given', 'circumstances', 'sequel', 'script', 'certainly', 'ambitious', 'co-star', 'same', 'level', 'Stone', 'final', 'analysis', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'off']",N/A

This film is about the most menacing, conniving and manipulating vixen every put forth. Everyone who gets involved with her either dies or gets taken through the ringer. She uses sex as a weapon, and she's always one step ahead of everyone.Sure, Sharon is trying a bit too hard in this film--the excessive hair-flipping is a bit much--but this is totally understandable. The first film was her best performance ever, plus it was the film that put her on the map. In the first film she had a unique, charming quality where should go from the sweetest, condescending seductress to the most evil woman around in the same sentence. Here, we find a much more hardened Catherine Tramell. Is this how Sharon's acting has evolved, or is this how Catherine has evolved as a person 14 years after the original? You be the judge. Regardless, Stone at age 47 is flat-out still hot.The biggest flaw I see in this film--like the first film--is a less-than-sexy, whatever leading man. Sure Michael Douglas is a fine actor, but come on, they could've picked someone much sexier. The same goes for this film, Clive Owen would have been an excellent choice, or even Pierce Brosnan. David Morrissey just doesn't cut it.I also feel shorted because--after seeing the uncut promo reel--there's been a ton of things cut out of the R-rated version. For example, in the reel Sharon is seen with yet another girlfriend hanging out with her in her stunning London flat; what happened to her? They are also shown in a threesome. So, to get the R-rating they had to cut the entire character out? This is why I long for the uncut, unrated version. The film seemed a bit short and rushed in parts, probably because 20 minutes or so were cut out.Overall, I feel the film is fun and entertaining to the end, despite its short-comings. Sharon Stone was forced to carry the film on her own and she does a pretty good job considering, despite critics going to town on the film--they would've no matter who was in it and how good it was. It simply existed so they have to slam it; however, that's what they get for waiting 14 years to make the sequel.",4,"Good, Raunchy Fun!",1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,2223,"['Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'fine', 'campy', 'fun', 'People', 'who', 'see', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'simply', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'film', 'most', 'menacing', 'conniving', 'manipulating', 'vixen', 'put', 'forth', 'Everyone', 'who', 'involved', 'dies', 'taken', 'ringer', 'sex', 'weapon', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'everyone.Sure', 'Sharon', 'trying', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'film', 'excessive', 'hair-flipping', 'bit', 'much', 'totally', 'understandable', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'was', 'film', 'put', 'map', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'unique', 'charming', 'quality', 'where', 'should', 'go', 'sweetest', 'condescending', 'seductress', 'most', 'evil', 'woman', 'same', 'sentence', 'Here', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'hardened', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'how', 'Sharon', 'acting', 'evolved', 'how', 'Catherine', 'evolved', 'person', '14', 'years', 'original', 'be', 'judge', 'Regardless', 'Stone', 'age', '47', 'flat-out', 'still', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'see', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'less-than-sexy', 'leading', 'man', 'Sure', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'fine', 'actor', 'come', 'could', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'someone', 'much', 'sexier', 'same', 'film', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'choice', 'even', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'it.I', 'also', 'feel', 'shorted', 'because', 'seeing', 'uncut', 'promo', 'reel', 'been', 'ton', 'things', 'cut', 'R-rated', 'version', 'example', 'reel', 'Sharon', 'seen', 'yet', 'girlfriend', 'hanging', 'out', 'stunning', 'London', 'flat', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'threesome', 'So', 'get', 'R-rating', 'had', 'cut', 'entire', 'character', 'out', 'why', 'long', 'uncut', 'unrated', 'version', 'film', 'seemed', 'bit', 'short', 'rushed', 'parts', 'probably', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'were', 'cut', 'out.Overall', 'feel', 'film', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'end', 'short-comings', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'was', 'forced', 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'considering', 'critics', 'going', 'town', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'matter', 'who', 'was', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'simply', 'existed', 'so', 'have', 'slam', 'however', 'what', 'get', 'waiting', '14', 'years', 'make', 'sequel']",N/A

I like Sharon Stone, as she's used her fame for good things outside of her acting career, which didn't pan out as successfully as one would have wanted with as much publicity as she has received, as her charity work and efforts speak volumes for her.

She and a football player were in a strange car accident, she survived but the player drowned when the car they were in launched off a bridge and into the Thames.  Catherine is being investigated by the police, and she sets her sights on her court appointed therapist, David Morrissey.  It unfolds into a rather choppy story, as she continues to tease and mislead Morrissey.  The adventures in San Francisco, her old stomping ground and setting for BII, are mentioned, but we never hear exactly what happened with her and Michael Douglas, which lingers in the back of viewers' minds.  The bondage and S & M scenes are a bit on the comical side, and, quite honestly, there is little to nothing sexy about Morrissey.  He's just lucky to be there.  While the first time around we were rather fascinated by Catherine's sociopathic sex appeal, this time it's just not a novelty.  She's evil, we've seen it before, it's just not going to work the second time around.Maybe this movie would have been a good thing if it was recast and not named after the first movie.

What made the first film such a guilty pleasure was Paul Verehoeven's slick direction, the surprisingly clever script, and Michael Douglas in the lead role.  While Sharon Stone is as good (and gorgeous) as she can be in returning to the role of novelist and possible killer Catherine Trammell, the film as a whole is just one big bore.  David Morrissey plays Michael Glass, the psychiatrist assigned to determine Trammell's ""risk addiction"" after her shady involvement in the death of a soccer star in London, and it isn't long before he's drawn into her web of lies, sex, and deception.  Along for the ride are his fellow coleague (Charlotte Rampling), ex-wife (Indira Varma), the inspector after Trammell (David Thewlis), and the dogging reporter (Hugh Dancy) that you just know is going to get what's coming with him.  All these otherwise decent actors manage to do absolutely nothing in their roles, and come off as being as bored and tired as the film's story.  While Basic Instinct 2 does provide a few salacious thrills, the film is predictable, and just when you think that the ending is going to be the film's most redeeming quality, it does just what its star character manages to do: it screws you over.

Gregg,"[3, 6]","Guys - if your wife is somewhat prudish and would never concede to watching a porno with you, or would if they had any kind of halfway decent, plausible plot... This might be your answer.  Sharon Stone's character lives for the thrill and excitement of pushing the envelope - and exudes sexuality.  That's what she does - she's a #1 mind f__ker and she's able to do that because of her overt sexuality.  And yes, the male costar will remind you of Liam Niesam (sp?) - like a younger version... but ladies he's handsome in the buff, so its not just the guys that get the eye candy.  And this actually has a plot and some twists... at the end you're not ""sure"" who really did all that killing.  (Ok, maybe if I saw/remembered the 1st Basic Instinct I'd know - but if I saw that it was so long ago that I don't remember anything other than it being the movie everyone wanted to see because they got a glimpse up her thighs).

995155,A1NU6H938LR7I3,B000FS9UK8,Pieter Dams,"[4, 5]","I've always had a special place in my heart for the first BasicInstinct movie. Back in the early 90s, you didn't have instant internetaccess like you have today. So the easiest way for adolescent males tolook at naked female bodies was to head over to your local video storeand rent any one of the broad selection of outdated low budgetmovies that were available to you. Needless to say those films were notexactly top of the line material. But then came along Basic Instinct, afilm loved by male teens whose hormones were running amok, adultslooking for an exciting thriller, or just curious what all the fuzz wasabout, and film critics alike. Basic Instinct was special because itwas not only sexually provocative (remember the interrogation andbondage scenes) but also had a strong cast, a good storyline, welldeveloped characters, beautiful photography, fast cars and a nicesetting. It was a violent police thriller in which the centralcharacter and main draw was a pantiless femme fatale with a taste forall things extreme and directed by the accomplished Paul Verhoeven, aDutchman famous for making harsh films with a touch of sexualprovocation.Fast forward to Basic Instinct 2. Whereas Catherine Tramell was the most intriguing figure in the first movie, she was surrounded by other equally well developed characters. Nick Kurran was the borderline cop, played by Michael Douglas, who became obsessed with the beautiful and dangerous Tramell, Jeanne Tripplehorn portrayed the jealous co-worker and Leilani Sarelle was Sharon Stone's lesbian love interest, which was pretty revolutionary in early 90s mainstream cinema.The sequel shows Catherine Tramell living in London and that's aboutit. Caught in her web this time around is Kevin Franks, played by Stan Collymore, a boring psychologist whose life is influenced by equally uninteresting women: the sexually unsatisfied ex-wife, a mother figure and mentor and some kind of love interest. I suspect the clich&eacute; London setting and subsequent cast of unknown actors was done for financial reasons. There is not a whole lot to say about the story. The movie starts off with a famous soccer player getting killed while he's making love to Catherine, who is doing 110 miles an hour in downtown London. Tramell is the main suspect and is persued by an overzealous police officer and defended by psychologist Franks who becomes obsessed with his hot patient.The opening scene is immediately the most exciting sexual scene in the whole movie. There is one other where Collymore has sex with his would-be girlfriend but that's a poor reproduction of Michael Douglas letting hissuppressed sexual appetites rage havoc on Jeane Tripplehorn. The othererotic scenes are pretty lame, especially after such extreme opening credits and taking into consideration Catherine Tramell's sexy outfits. Why would anyone want to go see an erotic thriller whose love scenes are tamer than a Britney Spears concert? Stil, Sharon Stone does look as beautiful and seductive as she did in the first film. However, whereas in the early 90s Catherine Tramell wore sexy outfits, made even more exciting because it was obvious she didn't wear anything underneath them, she was still pretty elegantly dressed. Her clothes in the sequel are designed for the sole purpose of turning men on. So all in all, I conclude that director Michael Caton-Jones has pretty much exploited the sexually provocative aspect of the first movie (but not in a very good way, unless the unrated version features a lot of spicy cut scenes) and neglected all of the other aspects that made Paul Verhoeven's film so special. Is it any coincidence he's since gone on to direct the critically acclaimed Blackbook and Basic Instinct 2 was nominated for worst film of 2006?So, if you were an adolescent male in the early 90s, whose sexual fantasies where forever influenced by Miss Tramell or if you just like Sharon Stone, who looks as good as ever, go check this film out, even if it's just for nostalgia's sake. If it's an exciting crime story you're looking for, better go watch one of the other erotic thrillers Basic Instinct paved the way for, like Body of Evidence, Disclosure or Sliver.",2,Not as good as the first one but worth a look,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,4196,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'first', 'BasicInstinct', 'movie', 'Back', 'early', '90s', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'instant', 'internetaccess', 'have', 'today', 'easiest', 'way', 'adolescent', 'males', 'tolook', 'naked', 'female', 'bodies', 'was', 'head', 'local', 'video', 'storeand', 'rent', 'one', 'broad', 'selection', 'outdated', 'low', 'budgetmovies', 'were', 'available', 'Needless', 'say', 'films', 'were', 'notexactly', 'top', 'line', 'material', 'then', 'came', 'along', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'afilm', 'loved', 'male', 'teens', 'hormones', 'were', 'running', 'amok', 'adultslooking', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'just', 'curious', 'what', 'fuzz', 'wasabout', 'film', 'critics', 'alike', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'was', 'special', 'itwas', 'not', 'only', 'sexually', 'provocative', 'remember', 'interrogation', 'andbondage', 'scenes', 'also', 'had', 'strong', 'cast', 'good', 'storyline', 'welldeveloped', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'fast', 'cars', 'nicesetting', 'was', 'violent', 'police', 'thriller', 'centralcharacter', 'main', 'draw', 'was', 'pantiless', 'femme', 'fatale', 'taste', 'forall', 'things', 'extreme', 'directed', 'accomplished', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'aDutchman', 'famous', 'making', 'harsh', 'films', 'touch', 'sexualprovocation.Fast', 'forward', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'Whereas', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'was', 'most', 'intriguing', 'figure', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'surrounded', 'other', 'equally', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'Nick', 'Kurran', 'was', 'borderline', 'cop', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'who', 'became', 'obsessed', 'beautiful', 'dangerous', 'Tramell', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'portrayed', 'jealous', 'co-worker', 'Leilani', 'Sarelle', 'was', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'lesbian', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'pretty', 'revolutionary', 'early', '90s', 'mainstream', 'cinema.The', 'sequel', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'living', 'London', 'aboutit', 'Caught', 'web', 'time', 'around', 'Kevin', 'Franks', 'played', 'Stan', 'Collymore', 'boring', 'psychologist', 'life', 'influenced', 'equally', 'uninteresting', 'women', 'sexually', 'unsatisfied', 'ex-wife', 'mother', 'figure', 'mentor', 'kind', 'love', 'interest', 'suspect', 'clich', 'eacute', 'London', 'setting', 'subsequent', 'cast', 'unknown', 'actors', 'was', 'done', 'financial', 'reasons', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'say', 'story', 'movie', 'famous', 'soccer', 'player', 'getting', 'killed', 'making', 'love', 'Catherine', 'who', 'doing', '110', 'miles', 'hour', 'downtown', 'London', 'Tramell', 'main', 'suspect', 'persued', 'overzealous', 'police', 'officer', 'defended', 'psychologist', 'Franks', 'who', 'obsessed', 'hot', 'patient.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'immediately', 'most', 'exciting', 'sexual', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'one', 'other', 'where', 'Collymore', 'sex', 'would-be', 'girlfriend', 'poor', 'reproduction', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'letting', 'hissuppressed', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'rage', 'havoc', 'Jeane', 'Tripplehorn', 'othererotic', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'lame', 'especially', 'such', 'extreme', 'opening', 'credits', 'taking', 'consideration', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'sexy', 'outfits', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'tamer', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'concert', 'Stil', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'look', 'beautiful', 'seductive', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'However', 'whereas', 'early', '90s', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'wore', 'sexy', 'outfits', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'exciting', 'was', 'obvious', 'did', ""n't"", 'wear', 'anything', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'elegantly', 'dressed', 'clothes', 'sequel', 'are', 'designed', 'sole', 'purpose', 'turning', 'men', 'conclude', 'director', 'Michael', 'Caton-Jones', 'pretty', 'much', 'exploited', 'sexually', 'provocative', 'aspect', 'first', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'unrated', 'version', 'lot', 'spicy', 'cut', 'scenes', 'neglected', 'other', 'aspects', 'made', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'coincidence', 'gone', 'direct', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Blackbook', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'was', 'nominated', 'worst', 'film', '2006', 'So', 'were', 'adolescent', 'male', 'early', '90s', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'where', 'forever', 'influenced', 'Miss', 'Tramell', 'just', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'go', 'check', 'film', 'even', 'just', 'nostalgia', 'sake', 'exciting', 'crime', 'story', ""'re"", 'looking', 'better', 'go', 'watch', 'one', 'other', 'erotic', 'thrillers', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'paved', 'way', 'Body', 'Evidence', 'Disclosure', 'Sliver']",N/A

It was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original, and I found Stone's lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting.A couple of things kept me viewing this DVD.  One was the London setting, which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns.  The other was Sharon Stone's rather plucky performance, and the presence of Charlotte Rampling, who has aged into a different kind of beauty.  Morrisey doesn't even come close to filling Michael Douglas's shoes, and it's hard to feel sorry for him at the end.As with the first movie, you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made.  The basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one.

Crawford,"[3, 3]","I think that a lot of the problem that people have with this film is the dilemma of the sequel:  you want more of the same, but differently.  While the first one is the most sizzling of thrillers, this one is far more about mind games that are subtle and open-ended, unresolved.Stone is Trammel, a total libertine manipulator, who lives to play bizarre and dangerous games.  While she admits many things to her psychiatrist toy, you never know what is true and what is not.  She weaves a web around him with the highest art, quite believable in my view if you approach it as a separate work from the first film - the character has evolved and is into different techniques.  It is more subtle and complex, which was immensely enjoyful for me.  You get new clues to Trammel's psychological makeup that can enter the viewers' imagination, if they are so inclined (and willing to be deceived).At the center of the film is the psychiatrist, whose own life is in crisis.  Coming together with Trammel for him is deadly dangerous - he is at times wanting to help, unethical, naive, and perhaps dangerous in his own way.  His transformation, largely at the hands of Trammel, is frightening and very fun.However, if you want this to be a re-play of the original, you will be disappointed.Recommended.  One of the best sequels I have ever seen.

Stone completely embodies every aspect of Catherine's physical attribute, manipulating the hell out of the freshly divorced psychiatrist... Dr. Milena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) recognizes Glass is falling for Catherine and advises him to remove himself as her therapist...Stone seems to be a strong figure only composed of ""capital sins.""

While Stone may not be an actress for the ages, she is a quite competent actress whose charisma, looks, and acting skills make her perfect for the seductive psychological drama of this film.  Here, Stone again plays Catherine Tramwell, who is ""addicted to thrills"" and loves to commit murder by using sex and seduction to bend others, usually a target male, to her will.  David Morrissey plays her latest ""target"" in this film, as the psychologist who Catherine Tramwell (Stone) targets for seduction and eventual destruction.  Morrissey carries off the role very well, and there is a moral here.  When, as Tramwell's psychologist, he departs from what he knows are the ethical limits of his profession and begins obsessing over her, this begins his path to destruction.  Had he adhered to his ethical boundaries he could have saved himself.  Thus, this film is not merely a psycho-sexual treat: it has a point.I watched this film on Amazon Instant Video on my new Kindle Fire and really enjoyed it.  Other reviewers claim that this version has scenes deleted from it, and I cannot speak to that.  I will say that I enjoyed the film.

The duplicity of the plot is already well known...there are no real surprises. The male lead (David Morrisey) is a limp noodle when compared to Michael Douglas. It is a sequel, and all sequels (except Godfather II) stink, etc. etc.....BUT, in defense of this much-maligned psychological pot boiler, it should be noted that it definitely has its good moments, and is, in the end, rather thought provoking.Sharon Stone plays her signature role with the gusto of a female carnivore devouring its young. Granted, at times her mugging and menacing get a little tiresome, but I can't picture another actress playing the role any better, except (after seeing the movie ""Unfaithful"") maybe Diane Lane. In between the scenery chewing, she generates some serious electricity. Even at 47 years old, her appearance in the hot tub scene will reacquaint you with the ""slow motion"" and ""step"" buttons on your DVD remote. Yes indeed, the magic smile is even effective under water. No one on earth can convey irresistible, compellingly attractive evil more effectively, simply with her eyes, a smile, a look, or a suggestive remark. As Catherine Tramell, she is completely up front about her perverse intentions, there is no sneakiness or guile, and she performs her evil magic right before the eyes of her prey, daring him/her to resist....or so it seems....for this is the second redeeming feature of the movie: the plot, though similar to its first iteration, is actually quite clever and intricately woven.

David Morrisey gives a very flattened performance as the psychiatrist fly in Catherine Trammell's web (who lives in the most phallic building in London, a running visual joke), and Sharon makes the risky (and I think effective) choice of playing her as somewhat weary and hard edged.

Basic Instinct 2 delivers instead a very poor imitation of the original from 14 years ago.Author Catherine Tramell survives her car crashing into the water, but her male companion dies in the process, apparently drugged earlier that evening to be slow, sluggish and have his lungs fail.  In order to figure out if she's a danger to herself or the public, the court appoints a psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to evaluate her.  Soon after, people around him begin to drop like flies.  There are signs that point to Tramell as the killer but the victims also appear to be people the psychiatrist could have killed, for his own personal reasons.You know the film is about to fall apart when the psychiatrist declares that he doesn't socialize with his patients.  Surprise, surprise, guess who breaks his own rule not too long after?  Is there anyone, man or woman, who can resist her?  Apparently, not.Sharon Stone (47) was actually really good as the rich, playgirl author, who never seems to be living in the real world.  She appears to be somewhat loopy and carefree, never serious for even a second, confident that she is the ruler of her existence.  She gets what she wants and people are magnetically seduced by her.  Still, we don't get to know her character very much. We don't get inside her head except when we find out in court what Dr. Glass believes about her personality flaws. She's also given some pretty stupid dialogue.David Morrissey isn't as watchable as Michael Douglas, cop Nick Curran, from the first film.  The electricity between them just isn't there.  I wonder how much better it could have been with Clive Owen instead.  His screen precence is much stronger.  He isn't helped, however, by the film's weakly executed story.David Thewlis, last seen in the third Harry Potter movie as Professor Lupin, also doesn't put in a great performance as the detective with an apparent dirty past, on the trail of Tramell.  Veteran actress Charlotte Rampling also seemed underused as psychiatrist Milena Gardosh, a minor role in the film.  I kept waiting on her character to be a more significant player but that didn't happen.This could have been a better film, if there was more of detective story to it with more intrigue and focus.  Audiences prefer murder mysteries to be more about ""who-dunnit"" with ""a-ha"" moments, rather than just a parade of corpses and a lead character constantly being sexually gratified.  Director Michael Caton-Jones has had better success with The Jackal and Rob Roy.My rating for this film is 2/5 and I wouldn't see it again.",2,Inferior sequel with plenty of stupid dialogue,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,2720,"['Triniman', 'Blog', 'Blogcritics', 'Desicritics.This', 'film', 'will', 'draw', 'lot', 'people', 'looking', 'sexy', 'murder-mystery', 'thriller', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'delivers', 'instead', 'very', 'poor', 'imitation', 'original', '14', 'years', 'ago.Author', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'car', 'crashing', 'water', 'male', 'companion', 'dies', 'process', 'apparently', 'drugged', 'earlier', 'evening', 'be', 'slow', 'sluggish', 'have', 'lungs', 'fail', 'order', 'figure', 'out', 'danger', 'herself', 'public', 'court', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Michael', 'Glass', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'evaluate', 'Soon', 'people', 'begin', 'drop', 'flies', 'are', 'signs', 'point', 'Tramell', 'killer', 'victims', 'also', 'appear', 'be', 'people', 'psychiatrist', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'own', 'personal', 'reasons.You', 'know', 'film', 'fall', 'apart', 'when', 'psychiatrist', ""n't"", 'socialize', 'patients', 'Surprise', 'surprise', 'guess', 'who', 'own', 'rule', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'there', 'anyone', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'resist', 'Apparently', 'not.Sharon', 'Stone', '47', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'rich', 'playgirl', 'author', 'who', 'never', 'be', 'living', 'real', 'world', 'be', 'somewhat', 'loopy', 'carefree', 'never', 'serious', 'even', 'second', 'confident', 'ruler', 'existence', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'magnetically', 'seduced', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'court', 'what', 'Dr.', 'Glass', 'personality', 'flaws', 'also', 'given', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'dialogue.David', 'Morrissey', ""n't"", 'as', 'watchable', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'cop', 'Nick', 'Curran', 'first', 'film', 'electricity', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'instead', 'screen', 'precence', 'much', 'stronger', ""n't"", 'helped', 'however', 'film', 'weakly', 'executed', 'story.David', 'Thewlis', 'last', 'seen', 'third', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'Professor', 'Lupin', 'also', ""n't"", 'put', 'great', 'performance', 'detective', 'apparent', 'dirty', 'past', 'trail', 'Tramell', 'Veteran', 'actress', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'also', 'seemed', 'underused', 'psychiatrist', 'Milena', 'Gardosh', 'minor', 'role', 'film', 'kept', 'waiting', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'significant', 'player', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'detective', 'story', 'more', 'intrigue', 'focus', 'Audiences', 'prefer', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'be', 'more', 'who-dunnit', 'a-ha', 'moments', 'rather', 'just', 'parade', 'corpses', 'lead', 'character', 'constantly', 'being', 'sexually', 'gratified', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Caton-Jones', 'had', 'better', 'success', 'Jackal', 'Rob', 'Roy.My', 'rating', 'film', '2/5', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'again']",N/A

The truth is, she shouldn't have.`Basic Instinct 2' has no sizzling sex appeal of leg-crossing Catherine 14 years ago. She is (I mean Sharon Stone) is still beautiful, posing before David Morrissey's police psychoanalyst who diagnoses her as `being addicted to risk' with his very serious face. In fact, she is seen in the opening scene doing you know what in the car madly driving in the street of London that ends up with a bizarre traffic accident.I know Michael Caton-Jones is trying to set the tone of the entire film. He succeeds, but unintentionally as making it a campy comedy. Sharon Stone does not miss a single chance to change her fancy dresses, posing before the embarrassed and ensnared David Morrissey, delivering such lines as would be imprinted in your memories long after watching the film, about very insightful commentary about Oedipus and the smell of the crime scenes. Seriously, I am greatly impressed with Sharon Stone who can deliver such nonsense without making us bored.Aside from the uncanny ability of Sharon Stone who can be in outrageous character, `Basic Instinct 2' has nothing that would justify making the long-delayed sequel. Murders are shown by the number way; the trauma of the psychiatrist (virtually recycling the same material as the original) is just uninteresting; and the worst is the dearth of sexual thrills surrounding Catherine. Sharon Stone looks sexy, that is good, but few scenes can successfully convey the suggested dangers behind this character.The supports like David Thewlis, Hugh Dancy and Charlotte Rampling are also wasted (especially Dancy who appears and soon goes away). The confusing climax and a `big surprise' (or is it?) is annoying bad, having no impact on us whatever.

I've already seen it five times; and, strange as it may seem, the film actually gets better with each viewing.  What makes the film for me is Sharon Stone.  Even at her age, she till plays the perfect ""wicked lady"" to every man's sexual fantasies.  The viewer can tell that Ms. Stone had fun making this film.  No one could've played the main character better than her.  I know that I've certainly had fun watching her.  It's almost like a moth being drawn to a burning flame.  It can't help itself.  That's the affect that Sharon Stone has on me.  I'm drawn to the burning flame of her character's killing passion, and I can't help myself, just like the men (and women) in the film.",3,This film wasn't as bad as everyone thinks.,1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,857,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'three', 'stars', 'think', '3', '1/2', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'film', 'found', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'five', 'times', 'strange', 'may', 'seem', 'film', 'actually', 'better', 'viewing', 'What', 'film', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Even', 'age', 'till', 'perfect', 'wicked', 'lady', 'man', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'viewer', 'can', 'tell', 'Ms.', 'Stone', 'had', 'fun', 'making', 'film', 'one', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'main', 'character', 'better', 'know', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'had', 'fun', 'watching', 'almost', 'moth', 'being', 'drawn', 'burning', 'flame', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'affect', 'Sharon', 'Stone', ""'m"", 'drawn', 'burning', 'flame', 'character', 'killing', 'passion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'myself', 'just', 'men', 'women', 'film']",N/A

Adams,"[4, 5]","Well, my credentials as a scholarly intellectual will be revoked for this review, but I liked ""Basic 2"" for what it is: two hours of murder mystery and sexual tension with a middle-aged female star who is irresistably lust-provoking, although her character is obviously dangerous and chaotically evil. This is an escape from boredom, and probably a ""guy flick"" all the way. Not quite as good as the original from a decade ago, but not nearly as ""bad"" as many pro critics and reviewers want you to believe. Of course, I just rented the DVD for a day, I didn't blow a wad of dough taking a date to a cinemaplex to see it. Find it on the cheap, and just enjoy it for what was intended to be...titillating entertainment in which Sharon Stone shows all 50-year-old women what they could look like if genetics and and wealth and self-discipline were applied in equal parts. David Thewlis, the werewolf professor in the recent ""Harry Potter"" films, plays a detective here in a supporting role, and he is quite effective.",4,A guilty pleasure for us fans of sexy trash...,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1013,"['Well', 'credentials', 'scholarly', 'intellectual', 'will', 'be', 'revoked', 'review', 'liked', 'Basic', '2', 'what', 'two', 'hours', 'murder', 'mystery', 'sexual', 'tension', 'middle-aged', 'female', 'star', 'who', 'irresistably', 'lust-provoking', 'character', 'obviously', 'dangerous', 'chaotically', 'evil', 'escape', 'boredom', 'probably', 'guy', 'flick', 'way', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'decade', 'ago', 'not', 'nearly', 'bad', 'many', 'pro', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'want', 'believe', 'course', 'just', 'rented', 'DVD', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'wad', 'dough', 'taking', 'date', 'cinemaplex', 'see', 'Find', 'cheap', 'just', 'enjoy', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'titillating', 'entertainment', 'Sharon', 'Stone', '50-year-old', 'women', 'what', 'could', 'look', 'genetics', 'wealth', 'self-discipline', 'were', 'applied', 'equal', 'parts', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'werewolf', 'professor', 'recent', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'detective', 'here', 'supporting', 'role', 'quite', 'effective']",N/A

Not that I don't like Sharon Stone, in fact once in a while she makes good choices like playing unglamorous mother roles like Broken Floweres. From watching this film, I kept wondering what they had done to her face. There must be a ton of foundation layer to her makeup or airbrushing in post-production, 'cause there's hardly any wrinkles that was so noticeable in Broken Flowers. I must say that her daring bra-less shirts and tasteful wardrobes quite striking, more so than the not-so sexy and attractive leading man. I mean there's got to at least 50 actors that have more appeal and bankability than the not wooden and pale looking David Morrissey. I only like him playing the heartbreaking husband in Hilary and Jackie. On another note, I was eager to see the participation of another British Diva Charlotte Rampling(Swimming Pool), but her role is unchallenging and I was expecting some lesbian plotline on her therapist role. The film looks very stylish in terms of the sets and wardrobe and the cinematography is nice too. Sharon Stone was willing to have numerous heavy-duty simulated sex scenes, but they were not as hot as the number she did with Michael Douglas. I was rather disappointed that the script was boring and interlectually unstimulating, and a lack of suspence. Not only do I think Morrissey was miscast, his character shouldn't have taken more screentime than Sharon Stone. If this film had a better script and a more irrestitable male lead who could generate more chemistry with Stone, than this film  could certainly revive her sinking career.....",2,A career-revival movie gone disastrous.,1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,1685,"['Oh', 'yes', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'Risk', 'Addiction', 'doubt', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'wait', 'DVD', 'Not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'fact', 'once', 'while', 'good', 'choices', 'playing', 'unglamorous', 'mother', 'roles', 'Broken', 'Floweres', 'watching', 'film', 'kept', 'wondering', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'face', 'must', 'be', 'ton', 'foundation', 'layer', 'makeup', 'airbrushing', 'post-production', 'hardly', 'wrinkles', 'was', 'so', 'noticeable', 'Broken', 'Flowers', 'must', 'say', 'daring', 'bra-less', 'shirts', 'tasteful', 'wardrobes', 'quite', 'striking', 'more', 'so', 'not-so', 'sexy', 'attractive', 'leading', 'man', 'mean', 'got', 'least', '50', 'actors', 'have', 'more', 'appeal', 'bankability', 'not', 'wooden', 'pale', 'looking', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'only', 'playing', 'heartbreaking', 'husband', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'note', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'participation', 'British', 'Diva', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'role', 'unchallenging', 'was', 'expecting', 'lesbian', 'plotline', 'therapist', 'role', 'film', 'very', 'stylish', 'terms', 'sets', 'wardrobe', 'cinematography', 'nice', 'too', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'was', 'willing', 'have', 'numerous', 'heavy-duty', 'simulated', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'hot', 'number', 'did', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'script', 'was', 'boring', 'interlectually', 'unstimulating', 'lack', 'suspence', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'think', 'Morrissey', 'was', 'miscast', 'character', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'screentime', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'film', 'had', 'better', 'script', 'more', 'irrestitable', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'could', 'generate', 'more', 'chemistry', 'Stone', 'film', 'could', 'certainly', 'revive', 'sinking', 'career', '..']",N/A
