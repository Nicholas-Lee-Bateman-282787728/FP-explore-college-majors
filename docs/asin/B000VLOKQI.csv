They speak in their common spoken language, being free and real, not made for tv for sure.Its very indepth and compelling as far as the storytelling goes and very enjoyable to watch its first run through, Im not so sure on repeat watches because every F--ing song they fade out 1/3 in, I want to see and hear the song!!!!!!!I mean why they do that?  Whats there hurry??  I have all night to see and enjoy this movie, its made for people WHO have no attention spans.....WHO is to blame?!It really pissed me off to see these RARE original song promos made and directed by Kit Lambert and fade out after 25 seconds.....WHY!!!!!!!!!!!Let me redo this as a ""special edition: I will re-insert the songs and let it play out, add a few videos along the way, double the length and it will be a masterpiece movie Milestone for this band....until then......go see ""The Kids are Alright"".",4,Great WHO Film...just wish the songs were complete,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,990,"['couda', 'shouda', 'been', 'version', 'Beatles', 'Anthology.I', 'love', 'fact', 'movie', 'cuss', 'alot', 'speak', 'common', 'spoken', 'language', 'being', 'free', 'real', 'not', 'made', 'tv', 'sure.Its', 'very', 'indepth', 'compelling', 'as', 'far', 'storytelling', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'first', 'run', 'Im', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'repeat', 'watches', 'F', 'ing', 'song', 'fade', 'out', '1/3', 'want', 'see', 'hear', 'song', 'mean', 'why', 'do', 'Whats', 'hurry', 'have', 'night', 'see', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'made', 'people', 'WHO', 'have', 'attention', 'spans', '..WHO', 'blame', 'really', 'pissed', 'off', 'see', 'RARE', 'original', 'song', 'promos', 'made', 'directed', 'Kit', 'Lambert', 'fade', 'out', '25', 'seconds', '..WHY', 'Let', 'redo', 'special', 'edition', 'will', 're-insert', 'songs', 'let', 'play', 'out', 'add', 'few', 'videos', 'way', 'double', 'length', 'will', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'Milestone', 'band', '.until', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'Kids', 'are', 'Alright']",N/A

That would have made this perfect.However, what is here is great. More footage of the Kilburn 1977 show than I thought I'd ever see, to hear how the band supposedly hated the gig/Jeff Stein's footage of that show. We see part of a great, pre-album (almost by a year) version of ""Who Are You"" live at Kilburn, with Moon and Entwistle jamming underneath Pete's guitar. Pete sings the chorus by himself (!), even the ""Who the f ...."" part, and Daltrey later joins in. It's wonderful to see Moon playing drums on a live version (other than the live-in-the-studio take in ""The Kids Are Alright."" The Who, from the clips seen in this DVD, sounded pretty stinking good at Kilburn. Moon actually looks like he was in better shape and less tired than the 1978 Shepperton footage in ""TKAA."" Don't get me wrong, I love the two Shepperton clips in ""TKAA,"" but Moon seems more firey and hits the drums and cymbals faster (and with less effort) on the Kilburn clips. Good footage of Entwistle's crazy fingers on the bass at Kilburn, although  a couple segments don't quite match up with his fingers, but nonetheless, it's great to see 1970s footage of the Ox cuttlng loose on the bass. This happens at the end of ""Dreaming from the Waist"" at Kilburn. Unfortunately, we only see the end of the song, but it's great to see John wailing on four strings.it's also great to see The Who clowning around in the studio while trying to do the backing vocals to ""Pictures of Lily,"" and there's a quick segment of Pete laying down the electric guitar for the track.Clips of the ""Quadrophenia"" and ""Who By Numbers"" tours are awesome, allthough short like the Kilburn gig. We see Pete holding up Keith Moon (or restraining him?) at Pete's mic stand, then Pete and Roger carrying Moon to his drum kit, and then Moonie collapsing.Interesting interviews with Pete and Roger, although much of Pete's is lifted from ""An Ox's Tale"" DVD and the 2004 interview Murray Lerner did for ""The Who Live at the Isle of Wight"" limited theatrical release and special edition DVD version in 2004. The quick segment of Hyde Park in 1994 (or 1996?) was interesting, although no site of David Gilmour.I'm glad they talked to Kenney Jones, who is pretty much bitter-free, at least in the interviews. He really carries the weight of Daltrey's fueding back then, the world's criticisms of him not being Keith Moon, and the 1979 Cincinatti trajedy where 11 Who fans were trampled to death in a stampede for festival (general admsision) seats.Maybe they will eventually put out all of these shows in full, someday soon on DVD. Take a note from Deep Purple and Kiss, please, Roger and Pete, and dump all the archive stuff on us. We are waiting.Thanks for all the great music! Hope to see you on tour again soon .....P.S. The talking heads segments aren't that bad. They're limited (only Noel Gallagher gets on my nerves, acting as if he's bothered to play with The Who at the Royal Albert Hall in 2000 - what the heck? I'll play fourth banana to The Who anyday!), as if the filmmakers started to include them in the beginning, and then kind of abandoned the idea in favor of interviews with Pete, Roger and file interviews of Entwislte, as well as their siblings and parents.

Even Roger Daltrey's singing, which I have found to be an acquired taste, comes through here as eloquent in his old age. The main film recounts the band's storied history, but I found the extras most interesting, especially the four bios of the band members, detailing where they stand in rock history. I really liked the footage of the current two band members recording a new song with Zak Starkey on drums and the bass player from ELP. Quite revealing of their methods.

Most of the footage I had not seen before, though I was disappointed there was no full-song concert footage. As far as content goes, there's not much new. We hear Pete explain for the billionth time why he smashed his guitar. No great revelations there. But what can an avid Who fan expect from such DVDs? If you really like the band, you've exhausted the catalogue. If you are unfamiliar with the Who, this is a good primer. The extra DVD is worth watching, as it gives great footage of all four members individually. For my money, the best Who treatment was the 30 Years of Maximum R & B feature done in 1994, which showed me, for the first time, the spectacular Second Isle of Wight concert footage as well as terrific versions of ""Happy Jack"" and ""Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere.""

1102995,AZJ9R9PC1KX84,B000VLOKQI,Dennis York,"[6, 42]","I am a big fan of the Who and I will for sure someday purchase this DVD. Based upon reviews here,it promises to be very good.I have several other WHO-related DVD's,(Kids...Isle of Wight,etc.)The reason for the ""one-star"" is because I am protesting Pete Townshend's constant sell-out of our precious Who songs for TeeVee show (a lyric from a Townshend song contains the line: ""you might see me on dumb TV"";apparently TV is not dumb enough for you to rake in some more shekels from it,eh,Pete?),theme songs,commercials,Pepsi,etc.etc. ad nauseum. He once said: ""They're MY songs and I can do what I want with them"". While that may be true in the ""technical"" or fiduciary sense,what Pete seems to fail to understand or care about that THOSE SONGS ARE OURS,TOO! We may not have written 'em,but we bought 'em,which in turn made Pete Townshend a very rich man.I feel he is damned disrespectful to us,his fans and to his own songs and their importance. These songs,along with those of other artists and groups from the '60's and '70's were the soundtrack to our lives and,speaking for myself;it's very painful and irritating to hear something like ""My Generation"" being used to hawk swill like Pepsi. Hearing ""Who Are You"" as the theme to a violent,gory crime drama TeeVee show is very sad,IMHO.I believe that Townshend owns the publishing rights to his songs. If that is indeed the case and I am reasonably certain that it is, (if someone knows better,please correct me),then by his sloppy,cynical disregard for his fans feelings about these great songs and his self-admitted awareness of their commercial potential,then perhaps he is not the best caretaker of the legacy of The Who.(Moon,Daltrey,Entwistle and Townshend are the only 'OO that there ever was.) Perhaps Pete Townshend should pay attention to someone like John Densmore who refuses to allow his fellow remaining Doors to ""cash in"" on their greatest songs,(to sell crap on TeeVee).When I get this DVD,it will be a used copy as I do not want to even remotely risk giving Pete Townshend another penny of my hard-earned cash-I've already given him much more than he deserves;the cynical sell-out that he is.",1,tired of townshend's sell-outs,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,2160,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Who', 'will', 'sure', 'someday', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'Based', 'reviews', 'here', 'be', 'very', 'good.I', 'have', 'several', 'other', 'WHO-related', 'DVD', 'Kids', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'etc', 'reason', 'one-star', 'am', 'protesting', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'constant', 'sell-out', 'precious', 'Who', 'songs', 'TeeVee', 'show', 'lyric', 'Townshend', 'song', 'line', 'might', 'see', 'dumb', 'TV', 'apparently', 'TV', 'not', 'dumb', 'enough', 'rake', 'more', 'shekels', 'eh', 'Pete', 'theme', 'songs', 'commercials', 'Pepsi', 'etc.etc', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'once', 'said', ""'re"", 'MY', 'songs', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'technical', 'fiduciary', 'sense', 'what', 'Pete', 'fail', 'understand', 'care', 'THOSE', 'SONGS', 'ARE', 'OURS', 'TOO', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'written', 'bought', 'turn', 'made', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'very', 'rich', 'man.I', 'feel', 'damned', 'disrespectful', 'fans', 'own', 'songs', 'importance', 'songs', 'other', 'artists', 'groups', ""'60"", 'were', 'soundtrack', 'lives', 'speaking', 'very', 'painful', 'irritating', 'hear', 'something', 'Generation', 'being', 'used', 'hawk', 'swill', 'Pepsi', 'Hearing', 'Who', 'Are', 'theme', 'violent', 'gory', 'crime', 'drama', 'TeeVee', 'show', 'very', 'sad', 'IMHO.I', 'believe', 'Townshend', 'publishing', 'rights', 'songs', 'indeed', 'case', 'am', 'reasonably', 'certain', 'someone', 'better', 'please', 'correct', 'then', 'sloppy', 'cynical', 'disregard', 'fans', 'feelings', 'great', 'songs', 'self-admitted', 'awareness', 'commercial', 'potential', 'then', 'perhaps', 'not', 'best', 'caretaker', 'legacy', 'Who', 'Moon', 'Daltrey', 'Entwistle', 'Townshend', 'are', 'only', 'ever', 'was', 'Perhaps', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'should', 'pay', 'attention', 'someone', 'John', 'Densmore', 'who', 'allow', 'fellow', 'remaining', 'Doors', 'cash', 'greatest', 'songs', 'sell', 'crap', 'TeeVee', '.When', 'get', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'copy', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'even', 'remotely', 'risk', 'giving', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'penny', 'hard-earned', 'cash-I', ""'ve"", 'already', 'given', 'much', 'more', 'cynical', 'sell-out']",N/A

1102997,A3IONOAE8EKJH1,B000VLOKQI,"Eric Cartman ""LYJY""","[2, 2]","When I read some of the reviews for this DVD set before actually receiving it and watching it, I was nervous since this has been a long awaited DVD for about two plus years.  I will admit that ""The Kids Are Alright"" is probably better, but this is still one of the best Who DVDs in my opinion.  Just like many of you, I would have loved it if the movie included full songs and I would have loved it even more if the DVD set included the London Colesium and Kilburn gigs in their entirety.  However, another reviewer stated that these two gigs will be released separately in 2008 (hopefully that's true).  In my opinion, the movie itself is extremely well put together.  Yes, many Who fans are already familiar with the story of the band, but in this case, the way the story is presented is fantastic.  If the movie just had straight interviews from Townshend, Daltrey, Entwistle, Moon, Jones, Edge, Sting, Stamp, Vedder, etc. then it would not be as good, but the interview footage mixed with the archival footage make it very interesting after each viewing regardless of whether or not you get to see and hear the whole song.  I will say that the movie itself could have been at least an hour longer if they had elaborated on each segment, but what we do get is excellent in my opinion.  And the archival footage included is brilliant.  Who cares about the packaging?  I read so many reviewers complaints about packaging and I don't get it.  We don't play the packaging on the DVD player.  It's the contents of the DVDs themselves that matter.  The second disc, Six Quick Ones, is also fantastic.  All four films about each band member are great and very well put together.  The segment dedicated to Mods and pop-art is also fantastic, and the segment of Pete, Roger, Zak, Simon, Rabbit, and Lake in the studio recording ""Real Good Looking Boy"" is also great.  I really like the inclusion of the band performing at Railway Hotel (the camera people should've shown less of the people dancing though and more of the band).  The scrapbook is really good too particularly Bill talking about Cincinatti, Pete talking about ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and Shel, Stamp, and Johns talking about the Who's early record contract.  For me, the icing on the cake for the DVD set is the bonus Live in Chicago disc.  Okay, it would have been nice to have a bonus live disc with Moon on drums, but to be fair, Jones does hold his own during the performance.  Plus, there is a better chance of a Who individual disc selling if Moon is on the drums rather than Jones.  Also, even though we don't get the whole concert on this disc, it still is fantastic.  In my opinion, the best performances are Substitute, I Can't Explain, Baba O'Riley, The Punk and the Godfather, My Wife, Sister Disco, Behind Blue Eyes, Music Must Change, 5:15, Pinball Wizard, Long Live Rock, Sparks, How Can You Do It.  Sorry but Drowned doesn't do it for me (Roger should have sung it so Pete could do more on guitar) and I don't care for The Real Me in its edited version.

1103005,A2H4SX356GPXHS,B000VLOKQI,Phil Wernig,"[1, 1]","Considering all that has been written about The Who by music critics, biographers and pop journalists, there is not much left to say about this forceful, inventive and influential English rock aggregate. Thanks to ""Amazing Journey"", however, there are still fresh things to see.The twin DVDs in this set produced by Nigel Sinclair, Bill Curbishley and Robert Rosenberg include ""The Story of The Who"" and ""Six Quick Ones"". These documentaries assemble live performances and recording sessions, archival newsreels, television and movie clips, interviews with the principals, their managers, producers, family, friends, and fellow rock musicians (Sting, The Edge, Eddie Vedder, Noel Gallgher, Steve Jones, and others) from 1964 through 2003.""The Story of The Who"" tracks the band's career from the earliest days of their emergence from among scores of English performers scrambling for attention in the wake of the commercial tsunami known as the ""British Invasion"" of 1964, spearheaded by The Beatles' successful penetration of the American marketplace.The extraordinary thing about this footage is that there is so much of it. That is owed to The Who's first managers, Chris Stamp and Kit Lambert - entertainment industry promoters with no particular ear for pop music - who surveyed the lively London scene in the spring of '64 looking for a promising group to manage and to film in action for a movie. Their selection of The Who - then billing themselves as The High Numbers - for their project proved to be miraculous. Suppose they had picked Herman's Hermits or The Dave Clark Five? They could not have foreseen any more than the band themselves did that The Who would become rock immortals.The hits started coming immediately. ""I Can't Explain"", ""The Kids Are Alright"", ""My Generation"", ""Magic Bus"", ""Happy Jack"", and ""I Can See For Miles"" were chartbusters in Great Britain and the U.S.A. The documentary cameras continued to roll. The Who recorded an advertising jingle for Coca-Cola , which inspired their first concept album ""The Who Sell Out"".One could isolate The Who's four consecutive studio albums ""The Who Sell Out"" (1968), ""Tommy"" (1969), ""Who's Next"" (1971), and ""Quadrophenia"" (1973) to bury in a time capsule with assurance that, when unearthed by archaeologists 2,000 years hence, the vigor, spirit, urges, concerns, and musical vocabulary of the first quarter century of rock 'n roll would be amply represented and potently distilled.The Who were by no means a seamless ensemble. Musically and temperamentally they were more distinguished by their individuality than by their cohesion. The subtraction of any one of their members, though, would have meant a sundering of the whole, a fact sadly demonstrated in 1978 when rambunctious drummer Keith Moon died shortly after the release of ""Who Are You?"", the band's last  hit. Each of the three other band mates ventured solo careers. Roger Daltry struggled to find suitable material for his rugged voice. John Entwhistle harnessed melodic, ostinato-free bass figures with brass sections and his sardonic sense of humor in several albums, but could not sustain commercial viability. Only Pete Townshend possessed sufficient artistry and imagination to craft exciting, affecting songs in his own right.If there had ever been any doubts, it became clear in later years that The Who had been Pete Townshend's band all along. The tensile strength in Townshend's direct, introspective writing embodied thoughtful vulnerability even as his music summoned thunder. The Who wanted their performances to be seen and felt as much as heard. Their decibel level pressurized eardrums and their stage antics - with the windmill guitar chords, the amplifiers pounded for feedback, and the furious destruction of guitars and drum kits - suggested rage shrugging off restraint.The band members were notoriously fractious. In their interviews, Daltry and Townshend are candid about their difficulties in working together, as well as their personal weaknesses, creative failures, and affection for intoxicating substances.""Six Quick Ones"" is designed to be complementary with ""The Story of The Who."" It covers some of the same material, including some of the same interviews and documentary footage. Where the first film presents a chronological history of The Who, the second is organized into six segments (plus bonus material) bringing into focus each of the band's four members, a study of the group's conceptual framework and art school influences, and a recording session that spotlights The Who as constituted in 2003.All writing about music suffers from being naturally unmusical. Its purpose is typically critical, expository, or promotional. Even if it were cast in lyric poetry with inspired phonemes and complex rhythms, it would still be language, absent melodic pitch, timbre, harmony, and sonic dimension. This review of ""Amazing Journey"" can offer only arid sentiment and parched opinion. The DVDs invite the viewer with a thirst for The Who or for the popular music of the '60s and '70s to sip cool draughts straight from the wellspring.",4,The Kids Were Alright,1281744000,"08 14,

Last Christmas it was a gift from my sister.  This box set is 2 dvds.  The first one being the movie Amazing Journey which tells the story of The Who from their childhood right up to the release of Endless Wire.  Townshed and Daltry are interviewd quite a bit through this movie and Townshend talks about how he grew up with the war going on and Roger talks about how he met John Entwhistle and invited him into his band The Detours.  Townshend also talks about his fasination with Meher Baba.  How he looked at him as a spirtual guidence.  There's a good amount of live footage in this movie as well as interviews with managers past and present, other musicians including Sting, The Edge, Steve Jones, Eddie Vedder and Noel Gallagher. I would have liked it better if they talked more about the albums.  Albums from Who's Next up through It's Hard get very little talk and would have liked to hear them elaborate on the albums more.  The only mention of Endless Wire is the very last scene of the movie when on the screen it says in 2006 The Who released Endless Wire.  thier first album in 24 years.  I would have liked to have really heard more about the ideas on the new Who album since I had been waiting forever for them to put out a follow up to It's Hard (see my review for Endless Wire).  Disc 2 is 6 different films titled 6 Quick Ones.  The first 4 focus on the band members individualy.  Who Art You is a film focusing on what Townshend describes as auto destructive art.  And the last one  Who's Back shows them in the studio recording a new song for their Then And Now greatest hits album, Real Good Looking Boy, with Greg Lake on bass.  And as a bonus feature on disc 2 an extreemly old film of them playing at the Railway Hotel when they were called The High Numbers and is the earliest footage known to exist of them on film.

1103008,A8F1ANYMX4H3,B000VLOKQI,Terence Dollard,"[1, 1]","Amazing Journey is candid, frank and sometimes unflattering to the members of the Who.  Townshend and Daltrey are artists, and as such, didn't get in the way of the producers by forcing glossed over accounts of their 45 year career.  Since the death of John Entwistle in 2002, Townshend and Daltrey have stepped back from the egos that fueled years of fueding, and gracefully acknowledged their collective pasts.  As a Who fan, you must buy this.There are 4 mini docs (6 total) that explore the musical contributions of each band member from an academic stand point.  The feature on Keith Moon's drumming is especially enlightening since most people think he was an undisciplined player, with no idea what he was playing.  After watching, you will understand he was probably a savant, besides being self-destructive.  The doc on Daltrey is equally enlightening.The sound quality is amazing, as all tracks have been remastered and actually have audable bass!",5,"The Complete Story, Warts and All",1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,957,"['Amazing', 'Journey', 'candid', 'frank', 'sometimes', 'unflattering', 'members', 'Who', 'Townshend', 'Daltrey', 'are', 'artists', 'such', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'producers', 'forcing', 'glossed', 'accounts', '45', 'year', 'career', 'death', 'John', 'Entwistle', '2002', 'Townshend', 'Daltrey', 'have', 'stepped', 'back', 'egos', 'fueled', 'years', 'fueding', 'gracefully', 'acknowledged', 'collective', 'pasts', 'Who', 'fan', 'must', 'buy', 'are', '4', 'mini', 'docs', '6', 'total', 'explore', 'musical', 'contributions', 'band', 'member', 'academic', 'stand', 'point', 'feature', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'drumming', 'especially', 'enlightening', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'undisciplined', 'player', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'playing', 'watching', 'will', 'understand', 'was', 'probably', 'savant', 'being', 'self-destructive', 'doc', 'Daltrey', 'equally', 'enlightening.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'amazing', 'tracks', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'actually', 'have', 'audable', 'bass']",N/A
