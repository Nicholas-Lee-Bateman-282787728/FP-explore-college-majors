The new owners sucked the life out of the renters, but only when they (the owners) were around. What happened to the newly divorced mother and young son from season one?  They are worth watching.",4,Let Down on Robson Arms 3,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,300,"['Not', 'as', 'good', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'not', 'bad', 'when', 'owners', 'are', ""n't"", 'around', 'Not', 'fan', 'new', 'owners', 'new', 'owners', 'sucked', 'life', 'renters', 'only', 'when', 'owners', 'were', 'around', 'What', 'happened', 'newly', 'divorced', 'mother', 'young', 'son', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'worth', 'watching']",Robson Arms: Season 3

The tenants are a mix of odd but funny characters. Some of the stars of the show are; Gabrielle Miller, Fred Ewanuick, Alisen Down, Zak Santiago, John Cassini & Dave Foley just to name a few.

I would recommend this entire series to Adults.  Maybe not suitable for the entire family.,4,Pretty Good,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,225,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Series', 'Robson', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'like', 'bring', 'new', 'one', 'two', 'season', 'would', 'recommend', 'entire', 'series', 'Adults', 'Maybe', 'not', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family']",Robson Arms: Season 3

Season Three is the last installment of what became for me an addictive series.  I could hardly wait to see what these loons were pulling next, and I was never disappointed.  The plot twists are always surprising, and the humor quotient is right back up to par with Season One.With the conclusion of Season Three, I rushed to the computer to see what else was in store for the residents of Robson Arms, and the answer, sadly, is nada.  Talk about disappointment!If you like to smile and occasionally even guffaw, this talented series is for you.  As I mentioned earlier, it is addictive, but cheaper than hard drugs.  It's also like eating popcorn in that you just can't take one piece and be satisfied.  You must view all three Seasons.The ending is cynical, shocking, and stunningly honest.
